(President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session)\r\nCo-Chair: Mr. Joseph Deiss . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session) \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nHigh-level Plenary Meeting on the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals \r\n \r\nAgenda items 13 and 115 (continued) \r\n \r\nIntegrated and coordinated implementation  \r\nof and follow-up to the outcomes of the major  \r\nUnited Nations conferences and summits in the \r\neconomic, social and related fields  \r\n \r\nFollow-up to the outcome of the Millennium Summit  \r\n \r\n  Draft resolution (A/65/L.1) \r\n \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): I \r\nwish to bring the following matter to the attention of \r\nMember States.  \r\n Members will recall that, in accordance with \r\nAssembly resolution 64/184 of 21 December 2009, it \r\nwas decided that the afternoon meeting,  \r\n “on Monday, 20 September 2010 … will … have \r\n50 speaking slots” and that “[t]he initial list of \r\nspeakers for the High-level Plenary Meeting … \r\nwill be established at a meeting to be scheduled \r\nin the month of May 2010” (resolution 64/184, \r\nannex I, paras. 4 and 6).  \r\n Furthermore, it was also decided that, \r\n “when each category of speakers is organized \r\nfollowing the order resulting from the selection \r\nprocess … the list of speakers for each meeting \r\nwill be rearranged in accordance with the \r\nestablished practice of the General Assembly: \r\n (a) Heads of State will thus be accorded first \r\npriority, followed by Heads of Government; \r\nvice-presidents, crown princes/princesses; \r\nthe highest-ranking official of the Holy See, \r\nin its capacity as observer State, and of \r\nPalestine, in its capacity as observer; \r\nministers; and permanent representatives” \r\n(ibid., para. 7). \r\nIt was also decided that, \r\n  “Without prejudice to other organizations \r\nwhich have observer status in the General \r\nAssembly, a representative of each of the \r\nfollowing may also be included in the list of \r\nspeakers for the plenary meetings of the High-\r\nlevel Plenary Meeting:  \r\n  League of Arab States \r\n  African Union \r\n  European Union \r\n  Organization of the Islamic Conference \r\n  World Conference of Speakers of Parliament of \r\nthe Inter-Parliamentary Union.” (ibid., para. 9) \r\n Those organizations, which have observer status, \r\nare very active and vital in coordinating activities in \r\nthe field of development. With the consent of the \r\nAssembly and without setting a precedent, I would \r\nA/65/PV.4  \r\n \r\n10-54115 2 \r\n \r\ntherefore like to give the floor to these five observers \r\nat the end of this meeting, after representatives of \r\nMember States have spoken. \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): \r\nThe Assembly will now hear an address by His \r\nExcellency Mr. Ivo Josipović, President of the \r\nRepublic of Croatia.  \r\n President Josipović: Ten years ago, a historic \r\nmoment for the United Nations occurred. In adopting \r\nthe Millennium Declaration, 189 Member States took \r\nthe decisive step to address the fundamental problem \r\nof unequal global development. By laying the \r\nfoundation for a more peaceful, prosperous and just \r\nworld, our collective vision was to redress this \r\ninequality and to offer hope to the world. \r\n We clearly committed ourselves to implementing \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) before \r\n2015, by which time we would eradicate hunger and \r\npoverty and address maternal and infant mortality and \r\ndiseases. To that end, we needed to eliminate gender \r\ninequality, create a universal right to primary \r\neducation, and prevent further environmental \r\ndegradation. \r\n The Millennium Declaration, as a road map for \r\nthe twenty-first century, laid the foundation for a \r\nglobal partnership for development. This partnership \r\nwas to be fostered by a spirit of shared responsibility \r\nand solidarity by which the developed world, on its \r\npart, pledged to make available and transfer requisite \r\nknowledge and resources to meet development needs.  \r\n Developing countries resolved themselves to \r\napply assistance in a rational and effective manner so \r\nas to enable their populations to gradually free \r\nthemselves from abject and inhuman conditions of \r\npoverty. Under the Declaration, each Member State \r\nbecame accountable at the national level and assumed \r\ncollectively responsibility at the global level. It is very \r\nclear today that we are witnesses to the fact that these \r\nobligations are increasingly indivisible and \r\ninterdependent.  \r\n Despite significant achievements during 10 years \r\nof implementation, the Secretary-General and others \r\nhave rightly highlighted that, where progress has been \r\nmade, it has been only partial and sporadic. Today’s \r\nmeeting to assess what it will take in the remaining \r\nfive years to achieve the MDGs is taking place in \r\ncompletely new circumstances. Moreover, we must \r\nfactor into our deliberations trends that are seriously \r\nimpeding our efforts. \r\n In today’s world, not one country has escaped the \r\nnegative impact of the global financial and economic \r\ncrisis. This crisis, which has affected us all with such \r\nextraordinary speed, has produced consequences that \r\nwe will have to bear for a significant time to come.  \r\n Moreover, although States are on track globally \r\nto meet the poverty-related MDG targets, poverty \r\nlevels are on the rise, even in countries where poverty \r\nwas not previously prevalent. These signs serve as \r\nimportant warnings not to further derail from our \r\ncollective promises. Even the slightest shortfall in the \r\nimplementation of the MDGs, which enshrine all basic \r\nhuman rights, will mean that we did not succeed. I am \r\nconvinced that this ought not to be the message of this \r\nmeeting. \r\n Over the past two years, especially in the \r\ndeveloped world, substantial efforts have been made \r\ntowards curtailing the decline of national GDPs to \r\ncreate the preconditions for initiating a new cycle of \r\ndevelopment. However, this process is not without \r\nserious social implications. Despite our commitment \r\nunder the MDGs to achieve full and productive \r\nemployment and decent work for all, the current \r\nunemployment trends that are affecting all countries \r\nirrespective of their level of development are being \r\ncontained at an exceptionally slow pace. Furthermore, \r\nsocial stress on populations has not been averted and \r\nstructural reforms at the national level are painful and \r\noften unacceptable to them.  \r\n Despite these circumstances, Croatia remains \r\ncommitted to the full implementation of the MDGs at \r\nthe national and global levels. By virtue of the world’s \r\ncurrent global character, the consequences of falling \r\nshort of the Millennium agenda will impact us all. \r\nCroatia has continued to approach the implementation \r\nof the MDGs with strong resolve despite the \r\ndifficulties that have evolved over the past decade. We \r\nhave prepared two implementation reports, and this \r\nyear we compiled an overview of our achievements to \r\ndate, the summary of which is currently available, \r\nincluding at this meeting. \r\n By way of contributing to the deliberations, I \r\nwould like to highlight the context in which progress \r\nhas been made in Croatia. Like Europe as a whole, \r\nCroatia is contending with multiple economic \r\n A/65/PV.4\r\n \r\n3 10-54115 \r\n \r\ndifficulties that have caused growth and development \r\nrates to decline. It is no longer as simple as it was to \r\nsecure domestic and foreign resources to invest in vital \r\nprojects targeted at education, health, environmental \r\nprotection and employment.  \r\n On its path of transformation, and inspired by \r\nEuropean ideals, Croatia has to date invested \r\nsignificant effort and resources in the implementation \r\nof the MDGs. Driven in particular by global and \r\nEuropean processes, Croatia has been actively dealing \r\nwith numerous environmental protection issues. \r\nCroatia is rich in natural resources including sea, \r\nsurface water, air, forests and soil. We have embarked \r\non numerous reforms in all areas of environmental \r\nprotection. We are certain that these efforts, financed \r\nfrom national resources, are essential preconditions for \r\ncreating a new cycle of sustained development. \r\n As a new sovereign State, Croatia embarked on \r\nits development path as a donor-recipient country. We \r\ndeeply appreciate the valuable efforts by the \r\ninternational community during that period. After only \r\neighteen years, Croatia has graduated and become a \r\ndonor country. \r\n Ahead of us lie new challenges. As all history has \r\nshown, we shall have to deal with them and find ways \r\nto overcome them. Moreover, it is a great imperative of \r\nthese times that we undertake our efforts collectively in \r\na spirit of understanding, tolerance, dialogue and \r\nsolidarity. Therefore, during this High-level Plenary \r\nMeeting, we, as world leaders, must find viable, \r\ndurable and affordable solutions for all. \r\n To conclude, I call upon all of us to make \r\nconstructive efforts over the next few days towards a \r\nsuccessful outcome of this Meeting. If used wisely, \r\nsuch an outcome will lay the foundations for ensuring a \r\nbetter future for all. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): \r\nThe Assembly will now hear an address by His \r\nHighness Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, Amir of \r\nthe State of Qatar.  \r\n Sheikh Al-Thani (spoke in Arabic): I would like \r\nto take this opportunity to congratulate you, Sir, on \r\nyour election to the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-fifth session and wish you every \r\nsuccess in your mission. \r\n I would also like to express our thanks to your \r\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Ali Treki, for his \r\ntireless work in the previous session, and our \r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General, His Excellency \r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon, for his efforts in promoting the role \r\nof the United Nations and the realization of its \r\nobjectives. \r\n We meet today to review progress in achieving \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) at a very \r\ncritical time, when the world economy continues to \r\nsuffer from one of its most severe setbacks since the \r\nDepression of the 1930s. The global economic crisis \r\nhas had a negative impact on the international \r\ncommunity’s efforts towards achievement of the MDGs \r\nin poor developing countries. The reduction of \r\ndevelopment assistance and foreign direct investment \r\nhas adversely affected those countries’ development \r\nprogrammes and policies in general, and the health and \r\neducation sectors and the battle against poverty and \r\nhunger in particular. \r\n We regret to note that the record of achievements \r\nat the global level is uneven. United Nations reports \r\nindicate that, on the one hand, a number of developing \r\ncountries have registered some concrete achievements \r\nin macroeconomic management, resulting in an \r\nincrease in investments and savings; on the other, many \r\ndeveloping countries, particularly in sub-Saharan \r\nAfrica, have yet to realize most of the MDGs. The \r\nnumber of people suffering from poverty exceeded one \r\nbillion in 2009. This should be a matter of concern for \r\neach one of us. \r\n Ultimately, the realization of the MDGs is not \r\nonly necessary for building a better life for millions of \r\npeople but is also essential for international peace and \r\nsecurity. The achievement of all internationally agreed \r\ndevelopment goals depends primarily on the vitality of \r\nour global partnership, which we agreed on at the \r\nMonterrey Conference and reconfirmed at the Doha \r\nConference in December 2008. The leaders of the \r\nGroup of Eight (G8) agreed in 2005 to provide, by \r\n2010, additional aid worth 50 billion dollars, 25 billion \r\nof which would be earmarked for Africa. \r\n They identified new targets for universal access \r\nto treatment of AIDS, universal primary education and \r\nfree basic health care. Again, in 2007, the G8 leaders \r\nreconfirmed their commitment to increase development \r\nassistance and announced an additional 60 billion \r\ndollars to combat AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis.  \r\n The achievement of the MDGs requires that each \r\nof the parties to the partnership carry out its \r\nA/65/PV.4  \r\n \r\n10-54115 4 \r\n \r\nobligations. It requires that developing countries adopt \r\ncomprehensive national strategies, promote good \r\ngovernance, fight corruption, promote sustainable \r\neconomic growth and create an attractive environment \r\nfor foreign direct investment. They are required to act \r\nto engage civil society organizations and the private \r\nsector in such programmes. Furthermore, they should \r\nalso mobilize the necessary financial resources, act to \r\nestablish a clear system for government accountability \r\nand focus on increasing awareness of the importance of \r\nachieving those goals. \r\n In contrast, developed countries should face the \r\nglobal financial crisis and work to achieve the MDGs \r\nthrough mobilizing international resources, undertaking \r\nfurther comprehensive reforms to ensure the stability of \r\nthe international financial system, reducing the \r\ndistortions of international trade, maintaining the \r\ncredibility of their commitments to increase official \r\ndevelopment assistance and issuing timetables for \r\nmonitoring the implementation of their commitments \r\nvis-à-vis developing countries. \r\n The delay in negotiations in the Doha Round, \r\nwhich was scheduled to finish by the end of June 2006, \r\nwas a huge disappointment for developing countries, \r\nwhich have continued to attach great hopes to that \r\nRound. Therefore, countries involved in the \r\nnegotiations ought to focus on establishing a \r\nmultilateral trade system of openness, fairness and \r\nnon-discrimination. \r\n Qatar has realized most of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and is on track to achieve all of \r\nthem before 2015. The State has provided free basic \r\neducational opportunities for different groups in the \r\nsociety without discrimination between males and \r\nfemales. Achieving gender equality and the \r\nempowerment of women has led the State to eliminate \r\ndisparity between the sexes at various stages of their \r\neducation, which in turn has led to an increased rate of \r\nenrolment in favour of girls at all levels of education. \r\nThe State has also eliminated gender disparities in \r\naccess to job opportunities. \r\n In the area of health, Qatar is among the world’s \r\nmost progressive countries in the reduction of child \r\nmortality and the improvement of maternal health, \r\nthanks to the country’s provision of universal free \r\nhealth care for all. Developments such as these in the \r\nareas of health and education are reflected in the State \r\nof Qatar’s ranking among countries with high human \r\ndevelopment, according to United Nations reports on \r\nthat subject. \r\n In this context, Qatar National Vision 2030 \r\nemphasizes four pillars that address all of the MDGs: \r\nThe first is human development, which involves the \r\nestablishment of advanced health and education \r\nsystems that provide the highest quality services and \r\nworkforce growth. The second pillar is social \r\ndevelopment, which involves the development of a fair \r\nand safe society and the promotion of the role of \r\nwomen. The third pillar is economic development, \r\nwhich involves the development of a diversified, \r\ncompetitive and sustainable economy, the optimal \r\nutilization of oil and gas resources, and sound \r\neconomic management. The fourth pillar is \r\nenvironmental development, which involves a balance \r\nbetween immediate needs and the requirements of \r\nenvironmental conservation, for which we have created \r\na special Ministry. In the process of the activation and \r\nelaboration of these pillars, the State of Qatar is \r\ncurrently preparing its first National Development \r\nStrategy (2011-2016). \r\n Qatar is keen to sponsor efforts to promote \r\nparticipation and cooperation for development, \r\nparticularly in relation to combating poverty and \r\ndisseminating the fruits of global growth in a more just \r\nand equitable manner. In this regard, at the Second \r\nSouth Summit in June 2005, the State of Qatar put \r\nforward an initiative to create a fund aimed at \r\ndevelopment in the South that would support \r\nanti-poverty programmes in developing countries, in \r\nparticular the least developed countries, in order help \r\nthem to achieve the MDGs. \r\n Qatar has also stressed its commitment to \r\nallocating the specified percentage of its gross national \r\nincome to development aid, while allocating 15 per \r\ncent thereof to the least developed countries. This aid \r\nis in addition to humanitarian aid and relief assistance \r\nin emergencies and disasters. The volume of Qatari \r\ndevelopment aid and assistance has witnessed a \r\nsignificant increase — in 2009, it reached about  \r\n$382 million, not counting contributions to the various \r\nUnited Nations funds, such as the United Nations \r\nDemocracy Fund. \r\n The State of Qatar has also sought to achieve \r\nglobal partnership through ratification of several \r\ninternational and regional agreements and treaties \r\nconcerning international development issues, as well as \r\n A/65/PV.4\r\n \r\n5 10-54115 \r\n \r\nthrough the adoption of an open trading system and the \r\ncreation of an attractive environment for foreign \r\ninvestment.  \r\n Through Silatech, an institution with a capital of \r\n$100 million that addresses unemployment problems in \r\nthe Middle East and North Africa via programmes \r\naimed at the rehabilitation and training of young \r\npeople in that part of the world, and through Education \r\nAbove All, an institution created by the Qatar \r\nFoundation in 2008 to protect, support and promote the \r\nright to education in areas suffering from or threatened \r\nby crises, conflicts and wars, Qatar has supported \r\nnumerous initiatives for cooperation with developing \r\ncountries designed to set up and implement strategies \r\nthat offer young people decent and productive \r\nemployment. \r\n In the area of combating corruption, we in Qatar \r\nhave taken many important steps to respond to \r\ninternational efforts in that regard. We moved to ratify \r\nthe United Nations Convention against Corruption and \r\nhave taken many steps to put the Convention into \r\neffect, including through the establishment of the \r\nNational Committee for Integrity and Transparency. We \r\nhave acted to ensure that all the Committee’s needs are \r\nmet in order to allow it to carry out its tasks with full \r\nobjectivity and independence. Indeed, in the general \r\nranking of Transparency International, Qatar is ranked \r\nhigh among all countries in the fight against \r\ncorruption, and it has placed first among Arab \r\ncountries. \r\n In the area of international cooperation, the State \r\nof Qatar hosted the Fourth Ministerial Conference of \r\nthe World Trade Organization in 2001, which in turn \r\nresulted in the Doha Round, as well as the South \r\nSummit in 2005 and the International Conference of \r\nNew or Restored Democracies in 2006. \r\n The State of Qatar hosted the first follow-up \r\nconference of the International Conference on Financing \r\nfor Development to Review the Implementation of the \r\nMonterrey Consensus during the period from \r\n30 November to 2 December 2008. At that time, the \r\nConference was considered particularly important \r\nbecause, since the Monterrey Conference in 2002, the \r\ninternational arena had witnessed numerous \r\ndevelopments, challenges and issues that required open \r\ndialogue and innovative solutions. \r\n At the political level, Qatari efforts to bring peace \r\nto Darfur, in coordination with the United Nations-\r\nAfrican Union Joint Chief Mediator have begun to bear \r\nfruit. Two agreements have been signed: a ceasefire \r\nagreement and a framework agreement for peace in \r\nDarfur. Despite the withdrawal of one of the armed \r\nfactions from the Doha meetings, negotiations are still \r\nin full swing and efforts continue to be made to reach a \r\nfinal peace agreement. \r\n In order to support development and \r\nreconstruction efforts in the Darfur region, we \r\nannounced last 23 February the establishment of a bank \r\nfor the development of Darfur with a capital of \r\n$1 billion to be contributed by interested countries and \r\norganizations in order to advance development there. \r\n We are required now more than ever to develop a \r\ncommon vision and search for effective mechanisms to \r\nmobilize energies in order to help poor countries in \r\ntheir efforts to achieve the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): \r\nThe General Assembly will now hear an address by His \r\nMajesty King Mohammed VI, Head of State of the \r\nKingdom of Morocco. \r\n King Mohammed VI (spoke in Arabic): It gives \r\nme great pleasure to attend this High-level Plenary \r\nMeeting of the General Assembly on the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). I should like first to pay \r\ntribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for \r\nensuring that development issues are a top priority in \r\nthe Organization’s programme of action. \r\n Ten years ago we adopted the Millennium \r\nDeclaration (resolution 55/2) as a common consensus \r\nagreement to ensure globally consistent and sustainable \r\nhuman development. The question on everyone’s mind \r\ntoday is: what specific goals have been achieved under \r\nthat historic declaration? In a spirit of responsibility \r\nand frankness, we should use this meeting to pose that \r\nquestion and to make an objective assessment of what \r\nhas been accomplished, and to identify the obstacles \r\nthat need to be overcome in devising the strategies \r\nneeded to achieve the MDGs by 2015. This momentous \r\nchallenge calls for responsibilities to be shouldered \r\ncollectively: not only by our partners among the \r\ndeveloped countries, which have to honour their \r\nobligations with respect to financing development \r\nprojects, but also by the developing nations, which \r\nhave to ensure that the MDGs take centre stage in their \r\nnational policies. \r\nA/65/PV.4  \r\n \r\n10-54115 6 \r\n \r\n This is precisely the course of action that \r\nMorocco has embarked on. In 2005 we launched our \r\nnational initiative for human development. The \r\ninitiative rests on an inclusive, consultation-based \r\napproach, participatory democracy — a system of \r\ngovernance that is founded on close proximity to the \r\ncitizens — as well as on the deep, active involvement \r\nof the actors concerned in the initiative’s projects, \r\nseeking to address shortcomings in social development \r\nefforts by creating jobs and income-generating \r\nactivities. \r\n Thanks to this bold initiative, and to the in-depth \r\nreforms, sectoral plans and major workshops that it has \r\ntriggered, Morocco has made great progress towards \r\nthe accomplishment of the MDGs, in particular with \r\nregard to fighting poverty, precarious conditions and \r\nsocial exclusion, as well as improving people’s living \r\nconditions in both urban and rural areas, especially by \r\nensuring widespread access to electricity and drinking \r\nwater. \r\n Concurrently, a compulsory medical insurance \r\nscheme has been established in our country, along with \r\na health coverage plan to assist the needy and \r\nvulnerable. Furthermore, the Kingdom of Morocco has \r\nmade a sovereign decision with regard to gender \r\nequality in the areas of the family, health, education \r\nand the job market, as well as ensuring enhanced \r\nrepresentation and active participation of women in \r\npolitical institutions and public life. The policy of \r\nmaking primary education available to all has resulted \r\nin 93 per cent of children between 6 and 11 years of \r\nage being enrolled in school. Moreover, in 2008 we \r\nadopted an emergency response plan to speed up \r\nreform of our education and training system. \r\n Given the importance we attach to the \r\nenvironmental dimension in development projects, we \r\nhave been able to take successful measures to protect \r\nthe environment and to combat climate change. \r\nSimilarly, and in order to promote sustainable human \r\ndevelopment through the optimal use of clean and \r\nrenewable energy technologies, we have launched a \r\ngroundbreaking solar energy plan and an integrated \r\nprogramme for wind-power production. Through these \r\ntwo projects, Morocco will be able to generate 42 per \r\ncent of its energy needs from clean, renewable sources \r\nby 2020. \r\n The common commitment we made at the \r\nMillennium Summit has changed the lives of millions \r\nof people who are now enjoying their right to \r\neducation, health care, employment and a dignified \r\nlife. However, can mankind’s conscience remain \r\nindifferent to the plight of the more than 1 billion \r\npeople who continue to suffer from hunger, and to that \r\nof the millions of children who die annually from \r\nmalnutrition, as well as from diseases and epidemics \r\nfor which treatment is both available and affordable? \r\nCertainly not. Such a bitter reality simply cannot be \r\ntolerated. Not only is it inconsistent with the principles \r\nof the revealed religions, of democracy and of \r\ninternational conventions; it also contradicts the lofty \r\nhuman ideals of brotherhood, solidarity and justice. \r\nSadly, this situation is being exploited to foment hatred \r\nand fuel extremism. \r\n To promote a global partnership based on \r\nsolidarity, Morocco has made human development and \r\nthe achievement of the MDGs the core of a practical, \r\ninnovative South-South cooperation policy, especially \r\nwith regard to sister African nations. I believe that a \r\nfirm political commitment made by all countries and \r\nsupported by a global, specific partnership mechanism \r\nwith a clear implementation timetable, provides the \r\nbest guarantee for achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. \r\n At the same time, we need to anticipate potential \r\nproblems, and to start thinking proactively about the \r\nbroad lines of our actions beyond 2015, so as to ensure \r\nthe continuity of our endeavours and to be prepared to \r\nmeet new challenges. We should do this through \r\ncollective action to strengthen the foundations of a \r\nglobal, harmonious, solidarity-based system to promote \r\nsustainable human development in which efficient, \r\nequitable governance should play a key role, so that we \r\nmay offer future generations a dignified life and build a \r\nfuture of peace, stability, progress and prosperity for \r\nall. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Treki) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nThe General Assembly will now hear an address by His \r\nExcellency Mr. Emomali Rahmon, President of the \r\nRepublic of Tajikistan. \r\n President Rahmon (spoke in Tajik; English \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): Ten years \r\nago in this Hall we adopted the Millennium \r\nDeclaration (resolution 55/2), the fundamental \r\ndocument that identified the major directions of the \r\nefforts the international community was to make at the \r\ndawn of a new century. The key importance of the \r\n A/65/PV.4\r\n \r\n7 10-54115 \r\n \r\nDeclaration lies in the fact that it defined a set of \r\npractical objectives and goals aimed at the \r\ndevelopment of each individual, and at meeting the \r\nneeds of the most vulnerable populations, in particular \r\nchildren, to whom the future belongs. \r\n Today, 10 years later, it is of extreme importance \r\nnot only to discuss the progress achieved and identify \r\nthe shortfall in the implementation of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) laid down in the \r\nDeclaration but also to work out specific measures for \r\nfurther accelerating and strengthening efforts towards \r\nthe timely and complete achievement of the MDGs. It \r\nis especially important at present, when already \r\nunsustainable and uneven progress is being \r\nundermined by the food, energy and financial and \r\neconomic crises. \r\n Climate change and its adverse impact, which \r\nappear to be gaining momentum today, confront us \r\nwith additional complex tasks, which are impossible to \r\naddress without concerted joint efforts by the entire \r\ninternational community. Given these new challenges \r\nand the increasing interconnection and interdependence, \r\nwe deem it essential to accelerate the implementation \r\nof the commitments made at the beginning of the new \r\nmillennium. \r\n Tajikistan is one of the eight pilot countries that \r\nwere identified for the implementation of the MDGs. \r\nOur country therefore adopted the National \r\nDevelopment Strategy of the Republic of Tajikistan \r\nuntil 2015. As the country’s major strategic document \r\nthe National Development Strategy identifies priorities \r\nand major directions for Government policy aimed at \r\nachieving sustainable economic growth, easing access \r\nby the population to basic social services reducing and \r\npoverty. That document provides an essentially new \r\napproach towards ensuring of development. It takes \r\ninto account world experience in the preparation and \r\nimplementation of similar strategic documents and \r\nlessons and conclusions gained during previous stages \r\nof our country’s development, and it addresses the \r\ncurrent realities and prospects for development. \r\n Moreover, the National Development Strategy \r\nserves as a basis for all existing and developing \r\nconcepts for the Government and economic sectors, for \r\nthe country’s development strategies and programmes \r\nand for the activities of all governmental managerial \r\nbodies, including the third Midterm Strategy for \r\nPoverty Reduction 2010-2012. As a result of the \r\nimplementation of the measures envisaged by the \r\nNational Development Strategy, we have already \r\nmanaged to considerably reduce poverty in our \r\ncountry. \r\n Currently, about half of the Tajikistan \r\nGovernment budget is channelled to the social sector, \r\npredominantly to education and health care. At the \r\nsame time, I would like to note that the potential for \r\nGovernment financing of the social sector is restricted \r\nby the rate of growth of the real national economy, \r\nwhich has slowed down in recent years due to the \r\nimpact of the global financial and economic crisis, \r\nnatural disasters and artificially created barriers to the \r\nnormal functioning of transport corridors. Today, the \r\nGovernment of Tajikistan is undertaking extra \r\nmeasures with the aim of mitigating the negative \r\nimpact and not to allow social sector funding to be \r\nreduced, as well as to take systematic advantage of its \r\nown potential for economic growth. These measures \r\nwill expand the possibility of funding the social sector \r\nand providing access to basic social services, and will \r\neventually ensure the achievement of all the MDGs. As \r\na result of such measures, for instance, the number of \r\nchildren attending elementary and high school has \r\nincreased, and the quality of social services offered to \r\nthe population has improved. \r\n Among the key factors contributing to the \r\nacceleration of progress in MDG implementation, in \r\naddition to the mobilization of internal resources, is the \r\ncreation of a favourable international environment for \r\nachieving sustainable development. This is especially \r\nimportant at the current stage, when the consequences \r\nof the global financial and economic crisis have not \r\nbeen completely dealt with, and when the necessity of \r\naccelerating reform of the international finance system \r\nis still relevant and of critical importance.  \r\n It is essential that reform of the international \r\nfinance system not only strengthen the system but also \r\nhelp give extra impetus to the reactivation of world \r\ntrade and investment, which are the driving force \r\nbehind world economic development and increased \r\nemployment. Measures must focus on creating \r\nfavourable external conditions and strengthening \r\nglobal partnerships which promote timely and \r\ncomplete achievement of the MDGs. These measures \r\nmust not increase countries’ external debt burden, \r\nwhich remains one of the most serious obstacles to \r\nprogress. \r\nA/65/PV.4  \r\n \r\n10-54115 8 \r\n \r\n Ensuring access to energy for everyone can be a \r\nkey prerequisite for accelerating progress on MDGs \r\nimplementation. We believe that this issue should be \r\ngiven priority alongside the MDGs themselves. In this \r\nregard, we support the initiative to provide universal \r\naccess to modern energy services by 2030. The major \r\nchallenge today is how to ensure access to energy \r\nwhile giving due consideration to the continuing \r\ngrowth of the Earth’s population and to reducing \r\nanthropogenic impacts on climate.  \r\n In our view, these goals do not give rise to a \r\ndilemma; to the contrary, they provide opportunities \r\nfor new cooperation. In this regard, we consider it \r\nessential that reliable and stable access to energy be \r\naccompanied by advocacy for a larger share of \r\nrenewable energy worldwide, for the transfer of new \r\nand advanced technologies for and enhanced energy \r\nefficiency. Comprehensive development of hydropower \r\nengineering, coupled with the use of the potential of \r\nother types of renewable energy such as solar and \r\nwind, would not only enable us to provide access to \r\nenergy but would also contribute to the stability and \r\nefficiency of energy systems and to a considerable \r\ndecrease in harmful emissions into the air. The latter \r\nare key objectives for MDG implementation and for \r\nmitigating the impact of climate change. \r\n Today, Tajikistan, which has enormous \r\nhydropower potential, is continuously increasing its \r\nefforts towards comprehensive development of \r\nhydropower engineering. Currently, a number of small, \r\nmedium and large hydropower stations are under \r\nconstruction in the country. They are intended not only \r\nfor energy generation but also for irrigation, which is \r\nof importance for the entire Central Asian region. In \r\nour view, effective development of our country’s \r\nhydro-energy potential is an important factor that could \r\nhave a multiplier effect on enhancing progress and \r\nensuring success. \r\n Water is a vitally important resource that links all \r\nthe MDGs. Increasing water scarcity and climate \r\nchange, which affects water resources, add growing \r\nurgency to the issues of water delivery to people and to \r\nwater-dependent economic sectors. Lack of access to \r\nsafe drinking water and adequate sanitation, human \r\ndeaths caused by water-borne diseases and unsanitary \r\nconditions, droughts and desertification threaten the \r\nsource of subsistence for a huge number of people on \r\nour planet. The breadth of these and other problems \r\nrelated to water resources was the focus of attention \r\nand discussion among participants at the International \r\nConference on the Midterm Comprehensive Review of \r\nthe Implementation of the International Decade for \r\nAction, “Water for Life”, 2005-2015, held at the \r\ninitiative of Tajikistan in its capital city, Dushanbe, \r\nfrom 8 to 10 June 2010. The Dushanbe Declaration on \r\nWater, the outcome document of the conference, was \r\napproved by the representatives of more than 75 \r\ncountries. It contains a number of recommendations, \r\nincluding the following: to develop adequate policies \r\nand allocate sufficient funds for the water sector; to \r\ngradually and sequentially introduce integrated \r\nmanagement of water resources at the river basin level; \r\nto pay greater attention to issues related to ensuring \r\naccess to safe drinking water and basic sanitation; to \r\ntake measures for adaptation to ongoing global \r\nchanges, including climate change; to improve the \r\nmonitoring system for glaciers and freshwater \r\nresources; more concerted actions by all stakeholders \r\nat all levels with the aim of incorporating the water \r\nissue into national development plans and programmes; \r\nto increase the involvement of women in the decision-\r\nmaking process on water resources; and to increase \r\nfinancing and strengthen cooperation, including the \r\ndevelopment of water diplomacy. We are convinced \r\nthat those recommendations will be a worthy \r\ncontribution to the implementation of the action agenda \r\nfor achieving the MDGs by 2015. \r\n It is necessary to note that the new challenges \r\nemerging in today’s world demand the international \r\ncommunity’s undivided attention. For instance, in \r\nrecent years the disparity in the development of the \r\neconomies of developed and developing countries has \r\nsignificantly increased, hampering the process of \r\nintegration. For that reason, it is necessary to take \r\nmeasures to strengthen the global partnership, with the \r\naim of consolidating the efforts of all members of the \r\ninternational community without exception. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to note that, 10 years \r\nago, the goals set out in the Millennium Declaration \r\nbecame a powerful incentive for all of us. Today, on \r\nthe eve of the last five years remaining for the \r\nachievement of the Goals, I am convinced that the \r\nMDGs can be attained. We must urgently make every \r\neffective and comprehensive effort to that end. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Treki) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nThe General Assembly will now hear an address by His \r\nExcellency Mr. Abdullah Gül, President of the \r\nRepublic of Turkey. \r\n A/65/PV.4\r\n \r\n9 10-54115 \r\n \r\n President Gül: It is a great honour to address this \r\nHigh-level Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly \r\non the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). I \r\nwould like to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \r\nfor his dedication to drawing attention to the global \r\nchallenges of development. His leadership has \r\ncertainly created the much-needed political momentum \r\ntowards the timely achievement of the MDGs. \r\n The Millennium Development Goals have \r\nprovided a solid framework for development in the past \r\ndecade. Global challenges, including the economic and \r\nfinancial crisis and the adverse impacts of climate \r\nchange, have made them even more pertinent today.  \r\n Five years from the deadline, there is an urgent \r\nneed to reaffirm our commitment and strengthen our \r\npartnership in order to meet the Goals on time. Our \r\nefforts should not be limited to Government activities. \r\nWe must also rally non-governmental organizations \r\n(NGOs) and the private sector around a revitalized \r\ndevelopment agenda. We must attach equal importance \r\nto each and every goal. It is also crucial that the MDGs \r\nare dealt with as one holistic package in order to create \r\nsynergies between all the Goals. I therefore believe that \r\nit is important to work along the following guidelines. \r\n Our overarching objective must remain the \r\neradication of poverty and hunger. We need to adopt \r\nstrategies in favour of the poor and vulnerable. \r\nInvestment in agriculture is essential to ensure food \r\nsecurity. We need to make progress on gender equality \r\nand women’s empowerment. There should be more \r\nemphasis on education and health. We need to pursue \r\nenvironmental sustainability with stronger political \r\ncommitment and action. We should acknowledge \r\nmutually reinforcing relations among the notions of \r\ndemocracy, development and security. I should \r\nunderline that these guidelines are drawn from \r\nTurkey’s own experience in development as an \r\nemerging economy. \r\n Turkey is well on its way towards achieving the \r\nMDGs. We have adopted the Goals as our primary \r\nnational development goals and integrated them in our \r\ndevelopment plans. In recent years, we have introduced \r\nambitious and comprehensive social welfare \r\nprogrammes to improve the living standards of \r\nvulnerable segments of our society. Those policies \r\nhave proven to be very effective and sustainable, with \r\nsolid financial resources to support them. \r\n We are on track towards reaching a 100 per cent \r\nrate of primary school enrolment, thanks to direct \r\npayments given to mothers to promote the enrolment of \r\ngirls in school. We have recorded significant progress \r\non maternal and child health by implementing free \r\npre-maternal health check-ups and compulsory \r\nvaccination programmes. With the introduction of a \r\nnew social security system, our citizens now enjoy \r\nuniversal health coverage. \r\n We have also provided extensive scholarship \r\nprogrammes for students of limited financial means, in \r\nall levels of education. We have taken every measure to \r\ncontain HIV and have provided access to treatment for \r\nthose who need it. In recent years, more than 500,000 \r\nnew houses have been built by the State-owned \r\nhousing development administration. Comprehensive \r\nmeasures and important policies have been introduced \r\nfor environmental sustainability.  \r\n As part of our commitment to the MDG agenda, \r\nwe hosted a regional review meeting in Istanbul last \r\nJune, in cooperation with the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme and the United Nations \r\nEconomic Commission for Europe. The conclusions of \r\nthat review provided significant input to this High-\r\nlevel Plenary Meeting. \r\n Turkey stands ready to lend its full support to the \r\nglobal partnership for development. Development \r\nissues now form an integral part of our broad foreign \r\npolicy agenda. As a reliable partner in development, \r\nour focus is particularly on least developed countries \r\n(LDCs). In order to deliver on our pledges to LDCs, in \r\nrecent years we have increased our official \r\ndevelopment assistance. With the contribution of \r\nTurkish NGOs, our overall development assistance \r\nexceeds $1.5 billion annually. \r\n In 2007, as Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime \r\nMinister, I had the pleasure and privilege of hosting in \r\nIstanbul my counterparts from least developed \r\ncountries at the United Nations Ministerial Conference \r\non Least Developed Countries. Once again, we feel \r\nprivileged to host the fourth such United Nations \r\nMinisterial Conference next year. We hope that this \r\nmeeting will generate strong political momentum and \r\nnew partnerships to address the persistent challenges of \r\nLDCs in the next decade. I look forward to the support \r\nof world leaders in that regard. \r\n While we may not have too much time left for \r\nprogress towards the MDGs, we certainly have the will \r\nA/65/PV.4  \r\n \r\n10-54115 10 \r\n \r\nand capacity to achieve them. But we need to act now, \r\nand act swiftly. Let us commit here once again to join \r\nour efforts in reaching our common goals. But let us \r\nnot forget that our partnership and solidarity for \r\ndevelopment must continue beyond 2015. We must \r\ncontinue with a new and enhanced development \r\nagenda. This must be our pledge to future generations. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Treki) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nThe General Assembly will now hear an address by His \r\nExcellency Mr. Choummaly Sayasone, President of the \r\nLao People’s Democratic Republic. \r\n President Sayasone (spoke in Lao; English text \r\nprovided by the delegation): At the outset, I would like \r\nto join other speakers in extending my sincere \r\ncongratulations to His Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss \r\nand His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on their \r\nelections as Co-Chairs of the High-level Plenary \r\nMeeting on the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs). I would also like to thank His Excellency \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon and all United Nations \r\nagencies for extending their utmost efforts in assisting \r\nUnited Nations Member States to attain the MDGs \r\nthroughout the past decade. \r\n Ten years ago in this Assembly Hall, we the \r\nworld leaders adopted our shared commitment to \r\nrealizing the MDGs by 2015. On the whole, important \r\nprogress and outcomes have been achieved in the \r\nimplementation of the MDGs at the global level. \r\nNevertheless, if we take a closer look at the results of \r\nimplementation of the goals at country level, the wide \r\nachievement gap remains unchanged. Moreover, the \r\ngap is ever widening, due to the fact that countries \r\nthroughout the world have encountered daunting \r\nchallenges caused by such crises as climate change and \r\neconomic and financial turmoil, which have also posed \r\nmajor constraints on attaining the MDGs. \r\n Only five years remain for us to prove that we \r\ncan live up to our joint commitment to achieve the \r\nMDGs. Therefore, at this most important gathering we \r\nshould discuss and exchange views on best practices \r\nand good lessons learned so that we may adopt firmer \r\nmeasures with a view to accelerating implementation \r\nso as to achieve the MDGs in the next five years. \r\n In 2003, the Lao Government adopted a national \r\ngrowth and poverty eradication strategy, which was \r\nlater mainstreamed into the sixth five-year National \r\nSocio-Economic Development Plan for the period 2006 \r\nto 2010. By implementing the five-year plans, the Lao \r\nPeople’s Democratic Republic has been able to achieve \r\nsustained economic growth while establishing a strong \r\nfoundation for the country to make important progress \r\ntowards the MDGs.  \r\n Through implementation of the fifth five-year \r\nPlan for 2001 to 2005, we achieved an annual \r\neconomic growth rate of 6.2 per cent. By executing the \r\nsixth Plan for 2006-2010, we expect to attain an annual \r\neconomic growth rate of 7 per cent — a key factor in \r\nreducing the poverty rate from the 48 per cent recorded \r\nin 1990 to 26 per cent in 2009.  \r\n In addition, the social and cultural sectors have \r\nalso achieved satisfactory results, including the \r\nimproved enrolment rate of children in primary school \r\nfrom 58 per cent in 1991 to 84 per cent in 2005. The \r\nmaternal mortality rate dropped from 650 deaths per \r\n100,000 live births in 1995 to 405 in 2005. During the \r\nsame period, the infant mortality rate also went down \r\nfrom 104 per 1,000 live births to 70. Likewise, the \r\nstatus of women in general has risen, as indicated by \r\nthe 25 per cent representation of woman \r\nparliamentarians in the National Assembly. Such \r\nachievements would not have been possible without the \r\nadoption of sound policies and appropriate measures, \r\ncombined with assistance from the international \r\ncommunity. \r\n Despite such laudable achievements, the Lao \r\nPeople’s Democratic Republic still needs to overcome \r\nnumerous challenges. As a vulnerable and least \r\ndeveloped country, it has also been affected by the \r\nfinancial and economic crisis and the impact of climate \r\nchange, which have all posed major constraints on our \r\nachievement of the MDGs. Against this backdrop, we \r\nmust redouble our efforts to mobilize resources from \r\nboth domestic and external sources for advancing some \r\nkey sectors, especially human resource capacity, the \r\neducation system and infrastructure, in particular in \r\nrelation to transportation and communication. \r\n Drawing from the lessons learned throughout the \r\npast 10 years, it is clear that all domestic forces have \r\nplayed a critical part in attaining the MDGs. However, \r\nwithout the valuable support and assistance of the \r\ninternational community, it would have been far more \r\ndifficult for the Lao People’s Democratic Republic to \r\novercome the challenges and achieve the targets set. \r\n On this note, I take this opportunity to express \r\nmy heartfelt thanks and sincere appreciation to the \r\ninternational community, especially to the donor and \r\n A/65/PV.4\r\n \r\n11 10-54115 \r\n \r\nfriendly countries, and international organizations for \r\ntheir continued support and assistance to the Lao \r\nPeople’s Democratic Republic over the years. We hope \r\nthat such invaluable support and cooperation will \r\ncontinue in the future. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Treki) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nThe Assembly will now hear an address by His \r\nExcellency Mr. Bingu Wa Mutharika, President of the \r\nRepublic of Malawi. \r\n President Mutharika: I am glad to say that the \r\nnews of Africa’s progress in the implementation of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) is encouraging. \r\nAfrican Governments are making heroic efforts to meet \r\nthe targets by 2015. \r\n The Millennium Development Goal reports for \r\nAfrican countries show a thorough and realistic \r\nassessment of Africa’s possibility of attaining MDG \r\ntargets by the year 2015, as well as the challenges that \r\nwe are facing in Africa. The 2010 reports also \r\ndemonstrate that many countries are committed to \r\nmeeting the MDGs.  \r\n However, my address is confined to my own \r\ncountry, Malawi. Malawi is confident that we shall \r\nmeet all eight MDGs in varying degrees. This is largely \r\nbecause Malawi has fully embraced the MDGs in the \r\nMalawi Growth and Development Strategy, which is \r\nour main overarching policy for development. It was \r\ndesigned in a manner such that it addresses all the \r\nMDGs. Thus, in implementing our own national \r\nStrategy, we are also implementing all the MDGs.  \r\n The Malawi Growth and Development Strategy \r\nfocuses on nine main priorities. These are agriculture \r\nand food security; irrigation and water development; \r\ntransport and infrastructure development; education, \r\nscience and technology; energy, mining and industrial \r\ndevelopment; integrated rural development; climate \r\nchange, natural resources and environment \r\nmanagement; youth development and empowerment; \r\nand the management of HIV and AIDS. All of these \r\nbear on our ability to implement the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. \r\n I am glad to report that five of the eight Goals \r\nwill definitely be achieved and even surpassed. These \r\nare eradicating extreme poverty; reducing infant \r\nmortality; combating HIV and AIDS, malaria and other \r\ndiseases; ensuring environmental sustainability; and \r\ndeveloping a global partnership for development. \r\nHowever, for the other three goals — universal primary \r\neducation, reducing gender inequality and reducing \r\nmaternal mortality — a more concerted effort will have \r\nto be applied to achieve them. \r\n In the effort to eradicate extreme poverty, \r\nindicators show that the percentage of the poor \r\ndeclined from 15 per cent in 2000 to nearly 9 per cent \r\nin 2009. Notable among the reasons for this progress \r\nhas been the continued targeted Farm Inputs Subsidy \r\nProgramme. We provided 5 billion Malawi kwacha for \r\nthe Malawi Rural Development Fund, which targeted \r\nthe poor. We also established the One Village One \r\nProduct scheme to encourage people to add value to \r\nagricultural products, and we have recently established \r\na 3-billion kwacha Youth Enterprise Development \r\nFund. \r\n The goal of reducing child mortality will be \r\nattained and surpassed. The under-five mortality rate \r\nwas reduced from 189 deaths per 1,000 in 2000 to 122 \r\nin 2009. This goal will be attained as the provision of \r\nhealth services continues to improve in all parts of our \r\ncountry. \r\n With regard to halting HIV and AIDS, malaria, \r\ntuberculosis and other diseases, Malawi will attain \r\nthose objectives. The HIV prevalence rate declined \r\nfrom 24 per cent in 2000 to 12 per cent in 2009. We \r\nhave also reduced other diseases, such as tuberculosis \r\nand malaria, and the trend shows that Malawi will \r\nreverse their incidence by the year 2015. \r\n The goal of ensuring environmental sustainability \r\nis also on course, and the Government is putting in \r\nplace adequate measures so that the country’s land area \r\ncovered by forest will be increased. During the past six \r\nyears, we have planted over half a billion trees as part \r\nof our reforestation programme.  \r\n The number of households with sustainable \r\naccess to improved water resources has been \r\nincreasing, and the MDG target will be surpassed by \r\nabout 20 per cent. The achievement of universal \r\nprimary education will also be made. In Malawi, \r\nprimary school education has been free for more than \r\n10 years, and the net enrolment rate has gone up to \r\nabout 83 per cent. The Government is continuing to \r\nexpand teacher training colleges, constructing \r\nadditional colleges to improve the quality and increase \r\nthe number of qualified teachers in primary schools, \r\nconstructing new classrooms to reduce the pupil-per-\r\nA/65/PV.4  \r\n \r\n10-54115 12 \r\n \r\nclassroom ratio, and scaling up school feeding \r\nprogrammes. \r\n In connection with the Goal of improving \r\nmaternal health, we are now focusing on achieving the \r\ndesired MDG target of 155 deaths per 100,000 live \r\nbirths by 2015. In this regard, the Government is \r\nconstructing and upgrading health facilities to offer \r\nessential health services, particularly focusing on rural \r\nand underserved areas and training health personnel. \r\n Malawi has achieved considerable progress in the \r\npromotion of gender equality and the empowerment of \r\nwomen. More women now hold high positions, such as \r\nthose of the Vice-President of the country, the Attorney \r\nGeneral, heads of important Government institutions, \r\ncabinet positions and ambassadorial positions. Also, \r\nthe number of women among Members of Parliament \r\nmore than doubled in the most recent general election. \r\nThe country is constructing and expanding girls’ \r\nboarding facilities in secondary schools, improving \r\nteacher training and encouraging girls to pursue \r\neducation in fields that have traditionally been \r\ndominated by men, such as science, technology and \r\nmathematics. We are also taking affirmative action to \r\nincrease the number of women in high-level decision-\r\nmaking positions. \r\n In summary, the Malawi Growth and \r\nDevelopment Strategy shows that we are making \r\ncontinuous progress towards achieving the MDGs. \r\nUltimately, the efforts of the Malawi Government, the \r\nprivate sector, development partners and civil society \r\nwill all need to be harnessed to ensure that the progress \r\nthat has already been made is maintained. \r\n For Africa as a whole, we strongly appeal to the \r\nUnited Nations to review the supply side to improve \r\nthe access of ordinary people, especially women and \r\nchildren, to the services envisaged under the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. Most of the Goals \r\ndepend on the availability of more schools, more \r\nhospitals, more rural infrastructure, more boreholes, \r\ndams and wells, more trained teachers, more doctors, \r\nmore nurses, more agronomists and more trained civil \r\nservants. We need teaching and learning materials; we \r\nneed school feeding programmes; we need extensive \r\nimmunization programmes. These need to be produced \r\nas part of the MDG agenda. I said that when I \r\naddressed the General Assembly in 2005, and I have \r\nconstantly said so. I am saying it again. Let us pay \r\nattention to the supply side of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals if they are to be attained by 2015.  \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Treki) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nThe Assembly will now hear an address by His \r\nExcellency Mr. Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov, \r\nPresident of Turkmenistan. \r\n President Berdimuhamedov (spoke in Russian): \r\nOn behalf of the people and Government of \r\nTurkmenistan, I cordially welcome and congratulate \r\nparticipants on the beginning of the sixty-fifth session \r\nof the General Assembly. I wish to congratulate \r\nMr. Joseph Deiss on his election as President of the \r\nAssembly and to express confidence that the Assembly \r\nwill work successfully and fruitfully under his \r\nleadership. I also express our gratitude to Mr. Ali \r\nAbdussalam Treki, President of the Assembly at its \r\nsixty-fourth session, for his effective activity in that \r\npost. \r\n This year our country is preparing to widely \r\ncelebrate a remarkable date — the fifteenth anniversary \r\nof Turkmenistan’s neutrality. It was within the walls of \r\nthe United Nations that our desire to be a neutral, \r\npeaceful, non-aligned country acquired the support of \r\nthe whole international community and became a \r\nreality. Throughout all the years since then \r\nTurkmenistan has remained committed to that choice, \r\nbased on a clear understanding of its role and place in \r\ntoday’s world and the strict fulfilment of its \r\ninternational obligations. From this high rostrum I am \r\naddressing all United Nations Member States and the \r\ncommunity of nations to express gratitude for \r\nproviding support and assistance in implementing our \r\ninternational initiatives.  \r\n For us, neutrality is not just a legal status. It is an \r\nactive position, a full-scale involvement in \r\ninternational processes through peacemaking and \r\nassisting in working out effective models of economic \r\ncooperation. It also includes providing a political \r\nplatform for solving problems, both within the region \r\nand beyond, for the purpose of consolidating peace, \r\nsecurity and creating favourable conditions for \r\nsustainable development and progress. This is the main \r\npurpose and content of our steps and initiatives on the \r\nworld arena.  \r\n Turkmenistan’s approach to contemporary \r\nproblems is based on confidence in the ability of the \r\ninternational community to find the right solutions, to \r\novercome stereotypes, to free itself from the burden of \r\n A/65/PV.4\r\n \r\n13 10-54115 \r\n \r\nstagnant thinking and to attain a new view of prospects \r\nfor global interaction. We call this a strategy of the \r\nfuture, implying the achievement of a broad and stable \r\ninternational consensus on key development issues — \r\npolitical, socio-economic, energy-related and \r\necological matters. \r\n For objective reasons, issues of economic \r\ncooperation are of particular importance for \r\nTurkmenistan. A strategic priority for us in this area is \r\ndiversification of energy routes, provision of a new, \r\nmulti-option pipeline infrastructure. We have started \r\nworking actively in that direction, based on clearly \r\ndefined principles of State policy in this sphere, a \r\nrealistic evaluation of our own resource base and the \r\npossibilities for its long-term exploitation. \r\n Last year, construction of new Turkmenistan-\r\nChina and Turkmenistan-Iran gas pipelines was \r\ncompleted successfully, in cooperation with our \r\npartners. We consider that to be a real contribution to \r\ninternational energy cooperation and an effective \r\nstabilizing factor that will have a positive influence on \r\nthe overall situation and will provide additional \r\nstability to the whole system of political and economic \r\nties on the Asian continent. \r\n Today we are actively working on implementing \r\nanother project — a Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-\r\nPakistan-India gas pipeline. We are convinced that that \r\nis beneficial for all parties involved. The project will \r\npromote an economic upturn, create a large number of \r\nadditional jobs, build social infrastructure and support \r\nand consolidate political stability in the region. \r\n Currently, issues of equal, uninterrupted and \r\nsecure access to energy sources and their means of \r\ntransport have taken on global importance, having an \r\nincreasing impact on the overall situation in the world \r\nand on the nature and the lines of international \r\ncooperation and the level of the engagement of States \r\nand regions in development processes. That requires \r\nraising this issue to the United Nations level, working \r\nout common principles and intelligible regulations \r\ngoverning relations among producers, transit countries \r\nand consumers, under United Nations auspices. \r\n In this connection, Turkmenistan intends to make \r\na statement in the course of the current session, \r\nproposing adoption of an Assembly resolution on the \r\ncreation, under United Nations auspices, of an expert \r\ngroup that would develop an international mechanism \r\nfor a stable energy supply in the world. We understand \r\nthat working on such a mechanism requires from the \r\ninternational community time and effort, responsibility, \r\nflexibility and readiness for sensible compromise, and \r\nthat it call up political, diplomatic, intellectual, \r\nfinancial and organizational resources. However, we \r\nare also convinced that from the standpoint of global \r\nsecurity and stability, the strategic benefits and \r\nadvantages will immeasurably surpass all costs and \r\nexpenses.  \r\n Obviously, in current conditions only the United \r\nNations — with its unique legitimacy, enormous moral \r\nauthority, available legal regulators and extensive \r\nexperience in resolving issues of universal \r\nimportance — is able to give impetus to this process, to \r\nprovide conditions for broad dialogue and act as a \r\nguarantor if agreements are reached. \r\n The world community has an understanding that \r\nthe problem of globally secure and reliable transit for \r\nenergy carriers requires multilateral discussions. In \r\nconfirmation of that, in 2008 the General Assembly \r\nsupported our initiative to launch such a dialogue, \r\nwhich is already being held within various \r\ninternational and regional meetings. We believe that we \r\nneed to move forward and raise it to a fundamentally \r\nnew institutional level. Therefore Turkmenistan \r\nsuggests considering the matter of eventually creating a \r\nspecial body — the United Nations Energy Council. \r\nThe purpose and content of its activity would be to \r\nprovide a political format and organizational \r\nconditions for a systemic, professional discussion of \r\nthe whole range of problems related to energy. With \r\ndue respect, we call on all Member States to formulate \r\ntheir suggestions in light of this initiative. \r\n Ten years ago, in its Declaration, the Millennium \r\nSummit declared all Member States responsible for the \r\ndestiny of the planet. For Turkmenistan, the \r\nMillennium Development Goals have organically fit \r\ninto our own development plans, matched the ideology \r\nand outlook of the reform of the national economy, the \r\nsocial sphere and public relations, and to a large extent \r\nthey have defined the lines of our cooperation on the \r\nworld arena. \r\n Turkmenistan has set a strategic course for active \r\nparticipation in a broad international partnership from \r\nthe position of a peaceful, politically stable, \r\neconomically strong State; for multidimensional \r\nregional cooperation based on the compatibility of \r\ninterests of various countries and support of its own \r\nA/65/PV.4  \r\n \r\n10-54115 14 \r\n \r\nand other large-scale international projects involving \r\ncountries and companies of the region and beyond. \r\n Owing to the geographical characteristics of \r\nCentral Asia and the Caspian Basin, the development \r\nof transport and communications seems promising \r\nhere. Building an extensive modern railway, road and \r\ncommunications network in the region could provide a \r\ngreat impetus to our countries successful participating \r\nin the global economic development. That would \r\nensure an inflow of investment and create the \r\nconditions for effective North-South and East-West \r\ncooperation in the context of the intercontinental \r\neconomic realities in the Eurasian space. \r\n We propose that the United Nations earnestly \r\nconsider the prospects for the development of transport \r\nand communications infrastructure in Central Asia and \r\nthe Caspian Basin. We are ready for close cooperation \r\nin that sphere. We believe it appropriate that \r\nspecialized United Nations bodies, first and foremost \r\nthe Economic Commission for Europe and the \r\nEconomic and Social Commission for Asia and the \r\nPacific, to become actively involved in that task. \r\n Solving the serious ecological problems, first and \r\nforemost, saving the Aral Sea and rehabilitating the \r\nunique natural resources of the Caspian Sea, is a \r\ncrucial factor in achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals in the region. More specifically, \r\nwe believe it necessary to create a special group of \r\ninternational experts, which, in cooperation with the \r\nUnited Nations and its entities, could draw up a \r\ncomprehensive international legal document on saving \r\nthe Aral Sea. That task should be undertaken \r\nimmediately, based on the memorandum of \r\nunderstanding between the United Nations and the \r\nExecutive Committee of the International Fund to Save \r\nthe Aral Sea, signed in Ashgabat on 3 March 2010. \r\n In short, we believe it necessary to create the \r\nopportunity for United Nations specialized bodies to be \r\npresent in the Central Asia region and the Caspian \r\nBasin without delay. We expect the United Nations \r\nEnvironment Programme (UNEP) to actively work \r\nthere first. We propose considering opening a UNEP \r\nregional office in one of the States of the region. \r\nTurkmenistan is ready to provide the necessary \r\ninfrastructure for that. \r\n A critical issue directly linked with the ecosystem \r\nis the use of water resources. More specifically, the \r\nrational use of water in Central Asia is one of the key \r\nfactors having a significant impact on the momentum \r\nfor our countries’ socio-economic development. \r\nTurkmenistan believes that water disputes should be \r\nsettled on the basis of the universally recognized norms \r\nof international law, taking into account the interests of \r\nall countries of the region, with the world community \r\nrepresented by the United Nations and with the active \r\nparticipation of other reliable international \r\norganizations. \r\n Our efforts are aimed at establishing a strong and \r\neffective system of regional security and stability in \r\nCentral Asia and the Caspian Basin, with a \r\ncommitment to peaceful negotiations to settle problems \r\nor disputes. Here, mutual understanding, confidence \r\nand openness, as well as the frank and objective \r\ndiscussion of all topical issues, are crucial. \r\n That, in turn, requires that there be a mechanism \r\nfor regional dialogue and continuing multilateral \r\ncommunication in order to develop mutually \r\nacceptable approaches to certain issues. Such a \r\ndialogue should be held regularly, with a clearly \r\nspecified agenda, and participants should have the \r\nauthority necessary to take decisions. We believe that \r\nthat form of communication is needed today owing to \r\nthe current state of regional development. We propose \r\nestablishing a high-level forum on security, peace and \r\ncooperation in Central Asia and the Caspian Basin to \r\nserve as the political format for such cooperation. The \r\nforum should meet on a regular basis, with each \r\ncountry in the region hosting it in turn. We are ready to \r\norganize its first meeting in Ashgabat within a \r\nreasonable period of time. \r\n This year, international conferences on resolving \r\nthe situation in Afghanistan have been held in London \r\nand Kabul. In general, we are satisfied with the results \r\nof both meetings, and would like to outline our \r\napproaches in the light of the decisions made there. \r\n First, Turkmenistan understands and supports the \r\nefforts of the Afghanistan Administration to resolve the \r\nsituation through talks to establish national unity and \r\nreconciliation. That is in line with our view on the \r\nprospects for development in Afghanistan. We consider \r\nit necessary for the international community to provide \r\ninternational assistance to its Afghan partners. In that \r\nregard, taking into account its neutral status, our \r\ncountry is prepared to hold, under United Nations \r\nauspices, a high-level international meeting on \r\nconfidence-building in Afghanistan and the \r\n A/65/PV.4\r\n \r\n15 10-54115 \r\n \r\ndevelopment of effective State institutions. We are \r\nready to discuss organizing such a meeting with our \r\nAfghan partners, the Special Representative of the \r\nSecretary-General for Afghanistan, other specialized \r\nUnited Nations bodies involved in the Afghanistan \r\nissue and all interested parties. \r\n Secondly, based on our wish to assist the people \r\nof that country in State-building and in line with the \r\noutcomes of the London and Kabul meetings, we offer \r\nour assistance in training Afghan personnel for \r\nmanagement in various fields in Turkmenistan, under \r\nUnited Nations sponsorship and programmes. \r\n Thirdly, we believe that it is crucial to assist \r\nAfghanistan in developing transport infrastructure. Our \r\ncountry proposes building a railway from \r\nTurkmenistan to Afghanistan that extends further into \r\nAfghan territory, with the help of international \r\norganizations, donor countries and international \r\nfinancial institutions. We would welcome the \r\ninternational community’s participation in that project. \r\n Fourthly, we believe that efforts to build a \r\nTurkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India gas pipeline \r\nmust be considerably stepped up. A trans-Afghan \r\npipeline could significantly help to develop \r\nAfghanistan’s economy, resolve major social issues, \r\nincluding in the area of employment, attract investment \r\nand have a positive influence on the political situation \r\nin the country. \r\n Fifthly, Turkmenistan is prepared to consider \r\nincreasing the electric power supply to Afghanistan and \r\nextending its energy infrastructure in order to connect \r\nit to Afghanistan’s network in the future. We invite the \r\ninternational community to consider that proposal at \r\nthe United Nations. \r\n Comprehensive and targeted cooperation with the \r\nUnited Nations Organization is a strategic choice for \r\nTurkmenistan. For us, the United Nations is not just the \r\nmost representative international body. We see it as the \r\nmainstay of the entire current system of global \r\ncooperation, guaranteeing the preservation and \r\nmaintenance of peace and the balance of interests in \r\nthe international arena, and safeguarding the current \r\nsecurity architecture. \r\n Together with the international community, based \r\non the ongoing positive experience of the cooperation, \r\nwisdom and responsibility of all States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations, Turkmenistan will continue to strive to \r\nachieve the lofty goals and ideals of the Organization. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Treki): I would like to \r\nremind speakers that the time limit for statements is \r\nfive minutes. I hope that they will respect that to the \r\nextent that they are able. \r\n(spoke in Arabic) \r\n The General Assembly will now hear an address \r\nby His Excellency Boris Tadić, President of the \r\nRepublic of Serbia.  \r\n President Tadić: I am pleased to be able to \r\naddress this High-Level Plenary Meeting on the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. I would like to thank \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his exemplary \r\nleadership on this crucial issue for the future of our \r\nplanet. \r\n The contemporary world is faced with the \r\nchallenge of global, shared responsibility for the \r\nfulfilment of the Millennium Development Goals. \r\nSince we last met here in 2005, significant if uneven \r\nprogress has been made, despite the setbacks caused by \r\nthe financial and economic crisis, volatile energy and \r\nfood prices, climate change and the loss of \r\nbiodiversity. \r\n As an observer State to the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement and the African Union, the Republic of \r\nSerbia is well aware of the great efforts made by \r\ndeveloping countries to meet their commitments. Our \r\ntraditionally warm ties, together with our long-standing \r\nsolidarity and assistance policies, will continue to \r\nserve as a strong foundation of cooperation with the \r\ndeveloping world. \r\n Meeting the Millennium Development Goals \r\nstands as one of the defining challenges of the twenty-\r\nfirst century. Levelling the economic playing field, in \r\nthe context of globalization, is perhaps the most \r\nimportant contribution developed countries can make. \r\n I am confident that the Republic of Serbia will \r\nmeet all eight Millennium Development Goals by \r\n2015. While they are all interconnected and mutually \r\nreinforcing, I would like to focus my remarks on four \r\nof them and on how we have effectively synergized our \r\nefforts to meet them through Serbia’s poverty reduction \r\nstrategy, itself an integral part of the Serbian \r\nGovernment’s efforts to achieve our central strategic \r\npriority — membership in the European Union. \r\nA/65/PV.4  \r\n \r\n10-54115 16 \r\n \r\n We have committed to across-the-board, \r\nevidence-based policymaking. This has resulted in a \r\nmore efficient use of public funds, combined with \r\ngreater transparency and a successful fight against \r\ncorruption and organized crime. The Serbian \r\nGovernment has also taken measures to ensure that the \r\nprices of basic food items, such as milk, cooking oil, \r\nflour and so on, will never again be manipulated by \r\nspeculators. \r\n In these difficult economic times, we have placed \r\na premium on expanding the social safety net. The \r\nenforcement of equality of opportunity, gender equality \r\nand the empowerment of women and minorities is \r\nbeing emphasized, and we have redoubled our efforts \r\nto ensure that pensions and savings are protected by \r\nmaintaining macroeconomic stability.  \r\n Moreover, significant investments in health care, \r\neducation and family care services have begun to pay \r\noff, with Serbia’s poverty reduction strategy being \r\nleveraged into a progressive recovery plan for jobs and \r\ngrowth, attracting additional foreign direct investment \r\nand modernizing infrastructure. The absolute poverty \r\nrate was reduced by half in just five years. However, \r\nour work is not done yet. Poverty reduction amongst \r\nchildren is still a great challenge. \r\n Integral to our efforts has been ensuring \r\nenvironmental sustainability through innovative \r\nfinancial mechanisms at the national and regional \r\nlevels. A good example of just such an attempt is the \r\nBelgrade Initiative on enhancing subregional \r\ncooperation in the field of climate change. \r\n In my country and throughout South-East Europe, \r\npaying for environmental infrastructure is a very \r\nimportant public policy priority, but it is becoming \r\nmore difficult to cover the costs. In my view, the \r\nsolution is closely linked to broader environmental \r\npolicy reforms, specifically in the setting up of an \r\nefficient and decentralized system of environmental \r\nfinancing and in finding ways to upgrade \r\nenvironmental infrastructure and monitoring systems. \r\n But it is not just about finding ways to pay for \r\nenvironmental sustainability. On a broader, conceptual \r\nlevel, it is about working towards a knowledge-based \r\neconomy. That is why we are working to implement \r\ninventive educational policies and scientific \r\nbreakthroughs and to raise awareness, so that further \r\nenvironmental degradation can be prevented and long-\r\nterm sustainable development achieved. \r\n The only efficient way for mankind to address the \r\nnumerous challenges of modern civilization is through \r\nthe investment of each and every country in science, \r\ninnovation and education, in synergy with politics and \r\neconomy. We are fully committed to continuing to \r\nprioritize our legislative agenda to do so, and we are \r\nwilling, ready and able to assist other States in their \r\nefforts. Solidarity with the developing world is the only \r\nway to save the natural treasures of our planet and \r\nensure health and prosperity for all of humankind. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Treki) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nThe Assembly will now hear an address by His \r\nExcellency Lieutenant-General Mompati Merafhe, \r\nVice-President of the Republic of Botswana.  \r\n Mr. Merafhe (Botswana): Allow me to \r\ncongratulate Mr. Deiss on his election to the presidency \r\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. Let \r\nme also seize this opportunity to thank his predecessor, \r\nMr. Ali Treki, for his leadership of the Assembly at its \r\nsixty-fourth session. I would also like to commend the \r\nSecretary-General, under whose stewardship we have \r\nbeen able to convene for this crucial summit. \r\n Five years ago, we convened here in New York to \r\nreview the progress made on the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) since their adoption in the \r\nyear 2000. That review showed that the enthusiasm and \r\ncommitment displayed by world leaders at the 2000 \r\nMillennium Summit did not translate into the results \r\nwe desired. It is evident that many developing \r\ncountries are lagging behind on most of the targets. In \r\nthis regard, we should renew our pledge and do \r\neverything possible to take our people out of the \r\ndehumanizing conditions of abject poverty and \r\ndeprivation, in line with the Millennium Development \r\nGoals.  \r\n This notwithstanding, I have no doubt in my \r\nmind that all Members remain committed to the cause \r\nof the Millennium Declaration. In the case of \r\nBotswana, we believe in the spirit and thrust of the \r\nDeclaration, that, as a Government, we should \r\nendeavour to eradicate poverty. My President has laid \r\nbefore the nation a road map towards prosperity for all \r\nthat is underpinned by a quest for human development \r\nand dignity. We believe that through the road map, \r\nBotswana can achieve more in terms of improving the \r\nlivelihood of its citizens.  \r\n Our commitment to the Millennium Development \r\nGoals has been amplified in our current National \r\n A/65/PV.4\r\n \r\n17 10-54115 \r\n \r\nDevelopment Plan, which runs from 2010 to 2016. \r\nBotswana has made some progress towards eradicating \r\npoverty, as evidenced by the decline in the percentage \r\nof people living below the poverty bottom line. The \r\npercentage of people living below that line declined \r\nfrom 47 per cent in 1993 to an estimated 23 per cent in \r\n2009. As a Government we firmly believe there is no \r\ntolerable level of poverty. \r\n To this end, different categories of vulnerable \r\ngroups such as those on pensions, destitute persons, \r\norphans and other vulnerable children, as well as \r\nhome-based care patients, have access to food, \r\neducation, subsistence allowance and other basic \r\nnecessities. However, realizing that the fight against \r\npoverty should be sustained, Botswana has adopted a \r\nflexi-programme on poverty eradication that focuses on \r\npromoting broad-based growth for sectors that create \r\nopportunities for sustainable livelihoods. The \r\nprogramme is geared to enhancing human capabilities \r\nof the poor through investing in and strengthening \r\ninstitutions that promote poor people’s participation in \r\nthe growth process. \r\n Botswana continues to commit significant \r\nresources to literacy and skills development of its \r\ncitizens. Consequently, we have achieved universal \r\nprimary education, with more than 95 per cent of the 7- \r\nto 13-year-olds enrolled in primary education by 2007. \r\n My Government has also made notable progress \r\nin the provision of health care for the population. For \r\ninstance, the proportion of mothers who are attended \r\nby qualified health professionals during delivery has \r\nremained at approximately 90 per cent since 1998. In \r\naddition, Botswana continues to make significant \r\ninroads in the fight against the HIV/AIDS pandemic. \r\nSimilarly, 62.7 per cent of people living with HIV and \r\neligible for antiretroviral therapy were on treatment in \r\n2005, while today more than 90 per cent are on \r\nantiretroviral drugs. In 2001, an estimated 40 per cent \r\nof infants born to HIV-positive mothers were infected \r\nwith the virus. That proportion has declined to just \r\n3 per cent. Notwithstanding the progress I have just \r\nalluded to, we continue to face challenges with respect \r\nto maternal and infant mortality. \r\n Water is a scarce commodity in Botswana. \r\nHowever, my Government has been able to provide \r\npotable water to more than 95 per cent of the \r\npopulation since the year 2000. In addition, more than \r\n80 per cent of our people have access to improved \r\nsanitation facilities.  \r\n One of the greatest challenges to humanity is \r\nclimate change. The impact of climate change is \r\nalready being felt around the globe, as shown by the \r\nnever-ending natural calamities bedeviling many parts \r\nof the world. It goes without saying, therefore, that \r\nclimate change, if not adequately and expeditiously \r\naddressed, will continue to impede development \r\nefforts, increase risks to public health, frustrate \r\npoverty-eradication interventions and reverse gains \r\nmade towards achieving the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. \r\n As part of its response, Botswana has established \r\na national climate change committee whose mandate is \r\nto oversee national policies on climate change and the \r\nimplementation of United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change activities. \r\n At the 2000 World Summit we pledged to \r\nstrengthen the United Nations with a view to enhancing \r\nits authority and efficiency, as well as its capacity to \r\neffectively address the full range of challenges of our \r\ntimes. Let us make that possible by providing the \r\nOrganization with the necessary support to respond to \r\ndevelopment challenges in a timely and proactive \r\nmanner. We commend the Secretary-General for \r\nestablishing the Millennium Development Goals \r\nAdvocacy Group of eminent personalities, who will \r\nsupport him in building political will and mobilizing \r\nglobal action to make the MDG summit a turning point \r\nin the collective effort to achieve the goals by 2015.  \r\n I believe that there should be more emphasis on \r\nsupporting groups of countries with special needs such \r\nas middle-income countries, landlocked developing \r\ncountries and small island developing States. On their \r\nown, those countries, or groups of countries, do not \r\npossess enough capacity and resources to mitigate \r\ndisasters and development challenges.  \r\n My delegation looks forward to an action-\r\noriented outcome at the end of this High-level Plenary \r\nMeeting. I believe such an outcome will be adequately \r\nresourced.  \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Treki) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nThe Assembly will now hear an address by His \r\nExcellency Mr. José Ramos-Horta, President of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of Timor-Leste. \r\nA/65/PV.4  \r\n \r\n10-54115 18 \r\n \r\n President Ramos-Horta: In the year 2000, the \r\nworld gathered here for six days in September. We met \r\nto discuss the role of the United Nations system on the \r\ncusp of a new century whose dawn we eyed with hope \r\nand anticipation and made a commitment embodied in \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). \r\n And here today we meet again. My hope for \r\ntoday and coming days is that same genuine will \r\nfostered in September 2000 can be reinvigorated, but \r\nthis time infused with valuable lessons learnt. \r\n While many countries have been guided by the \r\nMDGs to improve social and economic conditions, \r\nthere remains a unique group of countries, fragile \r\nnations and post-conflict nations that have been less \r\nfortunate. Those fragile and post-conflict countries face \r\nunique challenges whose significance was not realized \r\nduring the formulation of the MDGs. At the time, \r\nconcepts such as peacebuilding, State-building and \r\nfragility were not part of the normative international \r\ndiscourse, and therefore an understanding of their \r\nimpact on contextualizing MDG achievement and \r\ntimeframes for that achievement was, regrettably, \r\nabsent. \r\n I am here to say that despite our combined \r\nefforts, we must be realistic and acknowledge now, \r\nhere and today, that fragile and post-conflict States are \r\nthe farthest from meeting the MDGs and most likely \r\nwill not meet them under the time frame the architects \r\nintended. The sooner we all accept this reality, begin to \r\nmake amends and take urgent action, the better. \r\n I deliver this message not just as the Head of \r\nState of my country, Timor-Leste, but as a \r\nrepresentative of a group of fragile and post-conflict \r\nStates, known as the g7+. We advocate a new paradigm \r\nas a means to meeting the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs) by placing peacebuilding and State-\r\nbuilding at the forefront of international engagement. \r\n In my country and in the very corridors of this \r\nbuilding, we fought long and hard for our right to self-\r\ndetermination, with independence regained less than a \r\ndecade ago. In Timor-Leste, now more than at any \r\nother time in our brief history of nationhood, we enjoy \r\na genuine will that has allowed us to adopt and put into \r\naction a reformist agenda tailored to the diverse \r\nhistorical, linguistic, geographic, political and cultural \r\nlandscapes that make up the united Timor-Leste. \r\n To achieve this success, imported ideas were \r\nsubstituted with home-grown ideas; international \r\nexpertise, while welcomed, was contextualized with \r\nlocal innovation; and domestic knowledge was \r\nrecognized, valued and prioritized. The nation \r\nimplemented key peacebuilding and State-building \r\nfunctions, consolidating and reforming the security \r\nsector to foster peace and establishing such institutions \r\nas the Civil Service Commission, the Anti-Corruption \r\nCommission and the National Petroleum Authority for \r\nthe best management of our natural resources, and \r\nforged aggressive reforms in public financial \r\nmanagement and decentralization for better delivery. \r\n We adopted, for the first time, socially \r\ncompassionate policies — pensions for the elderly, \r\ndisabled and veterans — and returned some 150,000 \r\ninternally displaced persons to their homes in less than \r\ntwo years, against all odds. Above all, dialogue \r\nreplaced discord. With this, I am glad to report that, in \r\nTimor-Leste, much progress has been made.  \r\n While, as previously reported, between 1999 and \r\n2006-2007 some $8 billion were allocated by the \r\ninternational community for Timor-Leste, between \r\n2000 and 2006 poverty apparently increased. The \r\n$8 billion allegedly allocated to my country begs the \r\nquestion: why? Since 2007, as our Government took \r\nownership of our resources and responsibilities, it has \r\nbeen able to reverse this trend, making public spending \r\na cornerstone of the efforts to ease the suffering of our \r\nmost vulnerable, to spur economic growth and, above \r\nall, to consolidate a newfound level of stability. \r\n Mr. Merafhe (Botswana), Vice-President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, took the Chair. \r\n I promulgated State budgets that were tripled in \r\nsize and with a targeted spending level of $1.4 billion \r\nsince 2007. I am pleased to report a 9-per cent \r\nreduction in poverty, with the key MDG poverty \r\nindicators significantly improving, and this only in the \r\npast two years. \r\n Averaging three years of consistent double-digit \r\neconomic growth since 2007, Timor-Leste has been \r\ncited as one of the top 10 fastest growing economies in \r\nthe world for 2008 and 2009. Our non-oil per capita \r\nincome has increased significantly; 30 per cent of our \r\ngeneral State budget will be devoted to public health \r\nand basic education over the next 10 years. \r\n A/65/PV.4\r\n \r\n19 10-54115 \r\n \r\n The MDG target for infant mortality and our \r\nunder-five mortality rate has reached its target for \r\n2015, as have the detection and cure of tuberculosis, \r\nwith new targets being set. School enrolment has \r\nincreased from 65 per cent in 2007 to 83 per cent in \r\n2009-2010. In fact, across the board for all MDG \r\nindicators, Timor-Leste shows improvements, some \r\nmajor and some minor. \r\n In addressing the need to fast-track achievement \r\ntowards the MDGs, we have created an innovative \r\nprogramme, to be launched next year. Our MDG \r\nprogramme for sucos — that is, villages — provides \r\ndirect funding to all 442 villages in Timor-Leste, \r\ngiving ownership and responsibility for community \r\nworks and giving Timorese the opportunity not just to \r\nwitness development but to be a part of development. \r\n For a country that regained independence in \r\n2002, are these endeavours enough to overcome the \r\nchallenges of 400 years of occupation and 24 years of \r\nwar and to reverse the effects of decades and centuries \r\nof neglect, and can we now say that the MDGs will be \r\nmet in Timor-Leste by 2015? Our answer is that we \r\nwill have met some, and we could meet most if there \r\nwere a change in the way aid was delivered by the \r\ndonor community. \r\n We must trust in the practices and principles of \r\nthe Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and the \r\nsubsequent Accra Agenda for Action, with ownership \r\nand harmonization at the forefront, guided first by the \r\nprinciples of peacebuilding and State-building, because \r\nwithout peace to secure the lives and livelihoods of our \r\ncitizens and without State capacity to protect and \r\ndeliver vital services, the MDGs will remain a distant \r\ndream for many countries. \r\n When we do this, as in the case of Timor-Leste, \r\nwe demonstrate that we can, together, make significant \r\nprogress. We must now make the collective decision to \r\nmove from fragility to agility, and do so with the same \r\nvigour and effort with which the MDGs were originally \r\nasserted. May God the almighty and the merciful bless \r\nus all. \r\n The Acting Chair: The Assembly will now hear \r\nan address by His Excellency Mr. Nguyen Minh Triet, \r\nPresident of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. \r\n President Nguyen Minh Triet (spoke in \r\nVietnamese; English text provided by delegation): The \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) represent the \r\nstrongest commitment of all Member States to \r\nequitable development, which lays a solid foundation \r\nfor international peace, security and enhanced \r\nmultilateral cooperation. \r\n We are pleased to see the positive results \r\nrecorded thus far, which have helped improve the lives \r\nof hundreds of millions of people, including those in \r\nthe poorest countries. Women and children have \r\nreceived better care and been able to benefit more from \r\nit. The most valuable lesson to be drawn from this is \r\nthat the implementation of the MDGs must be placed at \r\nthe heart of international cooperation and of the \r\ndevelopment strategies of developing countries. Only \r\nby so doing can the international community mobilize \r\nthe required resources via new policies and measures at \r\nthe national and international levels. \r\n We are glad to inform the Assembly that Viet \r\nNam has achieved a number of MDGs ahead of \r\nschedule and is on track to attain the remaining goals \r\nby 2015. Viet Nam’s encouraging achievements — \r\nparticularly in poverty reduction, universal primary \r\neducation, the promotion of gender equality, the \r\nreduction of child mortality, the improvement of \r\nmaternal health and the control of malaria and other \r\npandemics — have won the recognition of the United \r\nNations, international organizations and Member \r\nStates.  \r\n Viet Nam fulfils its commitments by localizing \r\nand mainstreaming the MDGs into strategies, plans and \r\ndevelopment programmes at all levels and by \r\npromoting the participation of its people. The progress \r\nmade is also due to Viet Nam’s comprehensive reforms \r\nand the effective support of the international \r\ncommunity. \r\n Despite those encouraging accomplishments, Viet \r\nNam still faces a range of difficulties. The country’s \r\ninfrastructure is still underdeveloped and the living \r\nstandards of our people remain low, particularly among \r\ncommunities residing in remote and mountainous \r\nregions and areas devastated by the war, as well as \r\namong victims of agent orange/dioxin. \r\n Viet Nam shares the common concern over the \r\nfact that more than 1 billion people are still living in \r\npoverty, the uneven progress made between Goals and \r\namong countries, as well as the possibility that most \r\nregions will not achieve many Goals without further \r\nstrong measures. This unfortunate situation is deeply \r\nrooted in unfair international economic relations in \r\nA/65/PV.4  \r\n \r\n10-54115 20 \r\n \r\nwhich developing countries are forced into \r\ndisadvantageous positions, and in defects in national \r\ndevelopment policies. In addition, over the past \r\n10 years, the implementation of the MDGs has been \r\nnegatively affected by increased unilateralism and the \r\nuse of force, war and tension in parts of the world and, \r\nmost recently, by the global economic and financial \r\ncrises, coupled with the volatility in energy prices, \r\nfood insecurity and the impacts of climate change. \r\n Viet Nam supports the overall solutions and the \r\nspecific measures for each Goal defined in the draft \r\naction agenda to be adopted at this Meeting (A/65/L.1). \r\nIn addition, the Vietnamese delegation wishes to \r\nunderline the following. \r\n First, peace and stability are prerequisites for \r\ndevelopment. Therefore, it is our common \r\nresponsibility to support the peaceful settlement of \r\ninternational disputes, actively seek fair solutions to \r\nconflicts, facilitate peaceful and friendly relations \r\namong nations, and resolutely oppose war and the use \r\nof force. \r\n Secondly, we must continue to expand \r\ncooperation and create favourable international \r\nconditions to assist developing countries in \r\npolicymaking and in strengthening their management \r\ncapacities. In that connection, developed countries \r\nshould deliver on their pledges and commitments, \r\nincluding with regard to maintaining macroeconomic \r\nstability, contributing to the successful conclusion of \r\nthe Doha Round, eliminating unfair trade measures and \r\nincreasing development assistance.  \r\n Viet Nam strongly calls for an end to the \r\neconomic embargo against Cuba.  \r\n Within its capacity, in recent years Viet Nam has \r\nexpanded South-South cooperation with countries in \r\nSouth-East Asia and other regions. \r\n Thirdly, to implement the measures set out at this \r\nMeeting, we should quickly develop international and \r\nnational implementation programmes to sustain \r\nprogress, accomplish all MDGs in all regions, and even \r\nstrive for higher goals.  \r\n The past 10 years have shown us the significance \r\nand feasibility of the MDGs and brought us rich \r\nexperiences. We are now presented with new \r\nopportunities, including the full recognition of the \r\nimportance of multilateral cooperation with the United \r\nNations at the centre. On that basis and with \r\ndetermination, creativity and cooperation, I am \r\nconfident that we will make new progress in our joint \r\nefforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. \r\n The Acting Chair: The General Assembly will \r\nnow hear an address by His Excellency \r\nMr. Hifikepunye Pohamba, President of the Republic \r\nof Namibia. \r\n President Pohamba: I join previous speakers in \r\nthanking the Secretary-General for convening this \r\nHigh-level Plenary Meeting on the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). It is a timely event, \r\ncoming as it does 10 years after the adoption of the \r\nMillennium Declaration and five years before the cut-\r\noff date of 2015, by which the MDGs should be \r\nachieved. \r\n In 2005, a high-level plenary meeting was held \r\nhere at the Headquarters of the United Nations to \r\nreview the progress that Member States were making \r\ntowards achieving the Goals. Today, 10 years after the \r\nadoption of the Millennium Declaration and five years \r\nbefore the target date, it is time to take stock in order to \r\nsee how much we have achieved and how much \r\nremains to be done. \r\n On its part, Namibia recognized from the outset \r\nthat achieving the MDGs would be a daunting task. \r\nHence, we decided to integrate the achievement of the \r\nGoals into our national development programmes and \r\npolicies, such as our five-year national development \r\nplans and Vision 2030. To that end, national targets and \r\nindicators were also developed to monitor progress \r\ntowards the achievement of the goals. \r\n For example, we have expanded the delivery of \r\npublic services and social amenities. Today, the \r\nmajority of our people have access to clear water. \r\nThree quarters of our urban population has access to \r\nelectricity. Many rural communities have been \r\nprovided with electricity through the rural \r\nelectrification programme. However, there has been \r\nless progress with regard to access to sanitation, \r\nparticularly in rural areas.  \r\n Our Government regards the provision of \r\neducation and training to our people as one of its most \r\nimportant national priorities. For that reason, over the \r\nyears we have constantly allocated the largest \r\npercentage of the national budget to the education \r\nsector. Today, our country is on course to achieving the \r\ngoal of providing universal primary education. I am \r\n A/65/PV.4\r\n \r\n21 10-54115 \r\n \r\nhappy to say that Namibia has achieved and in fact \r\nexceeded gender parity with respect to enrolment ratios \r\nfor girls to boys in our schools. \r\n Overall, progress in reducing infant mortality has \r\nbeen rather slow, while in the area of maternal health \r\nprogress has been made with regard to the number of \r\nbirths attended by trained personnel. Maternal \r\nmortality currently stands at 4.9 deaths per 100 live \r\nbirths. Our goal is to reduce that figure and move \r\ncloser to achieving Goals 4 and 5.  \r\n Complications from HIV/AIDS have become the \r\nmain cause of death in our country. However, there has \r\nbeen a significant decline in the number of new \r\ninfections as a result of the ongoing country-wide \r\npublic awareness campaigns. Likewise, although \r\nmalaria is the third main cause of death in our country, \r\nit has been contained through the distribution of free \r\ninsecticide-treated mosquito nets and by the spraying \r\nof household materials. As a result of ongoing \r\ntreatment and awareness campaigns, progress has been \r\nrecorded with regard to successfully treating cases of \r\ntuberculosis, especially during the period since 1996. \r\n Namibia faces a decline in international \r\ndevelopment assistance due to our country’s \r\nclassification as a middle-income country. In the spirit \r\nof the Windhoek Ministerial Declaration on \r\nDevelopment Cooperation with Middle-Income \r\nCountries, which was adopted in August 2008, I appeal \r\nto the Bretton Woods and other international financial \r\ninstitutions to create special mechanisms to enable \r\nmiddle-income countries such as Namibia to access \r\nfinancial resources for development on concessional \r\nterms. \r\n Indeed, there is a need to strengthen the global \r\npartnership for development to promote and facilitate \r\neffective international cooperation and achieve the \r\nMDGs. I would like to further urge our development \r\ncooperation partners to honour the obligations made at \r\nvarious international forums to provide consistent \r\nfinancial and technical support to developing countries. \r\nBy working together, we can achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals by 2015. \r\n The Acting Chair: The General Assembly will \r\nnow hear an address by His Serene Highness Prince \r\nAlbert II, Head of State of the Principality of Monaco. \r\n Prince Albert (spoke in French): Ten years ago \r\nfrom this very rostrum (see A/55/PV.5), I resolutely \r\nmade the commitment before the General Assembly \r\nthat my country would effectively support the \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs), which we set for ourselves when we adopted \r\nthe Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2). In 2000, \r\nwe decisively expressed our active desire for a new era \r\nand together reaffirmed our determination to \r\nimplement the objectives of human dignity in the new \r\nmillennium. We also determined to spare no effort to \r\ncombat poverty, thereby making the world fairer and \r\nmore united in solidarity. \r\n So how can we today justify a woman dying \r\nduring childbirth as a result of the lack adequate care? \r\nHow can we justify a child dying from hunger or \r\npreventable disease when so much technical and \r\nscientific progress is at our disposal? That moral \r\nquandary and the conviction that world peace and \r\nsecurity cannot be achieved without sustainable \r\ndevelopment for all are at the heart of the political \r\ncompact uniting the whole international community, \r\nwhich we have come here today to consider. Five years \r\nfrom a deadline that will constitute a decisive test for \r\nthe Organization, our collective responsibility and the \r\nsurvival of the planet are what is at stake at this crucial \r\njuncture. \r\n There have been some encouraging results, in \r\nparticular in the areas of primary education and \r\ncombating HIV/AIDS, which lead us to believe that the \r\nGoals continue to be realistic. They should prompt us \r\nto redouble our efforts, lest we backslide on the \r\nprogress made. We should courageously reaffirm the \r\nbasic values that guide international relations in our \r\ninterdependent world: liberty, equality, solidarity, \r\ntolerance, respect for nature and shared responsibility. \r\n In that connection, I reaffirm my country’s \r\ncommitment to carry out an international development \r\ncooperation policy based on achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. Monaco’s official development \r\nassistance will therefore reach the target of 0.7 per cent \r\ngross national income by 2015, thereby enabling the \r\nPrincipality of Monaco to join the group of countries \r\nthat have shown the greatest solidarity. Our assistance, \r\nwhich has increased five-fold since 2000, is growing \r\nby 25 per cent annually. Provided entirely on the basis \r\nof grants, Monaco’s assistance is essentially geared \r\ntowards our partners among the least developed \r\ncountries, and targets development projects in the areas \r\nof health, education, the environment and \r\nmicrofinancing. \r\nA/65/PV.4  \r\n \r\n10-54115 22 \r\n \r\n Poverty is unacceptable. It is not intolerable that \r\nnearly 1 billion people are still affected by hunger, that \r\none in four children in the developing world is \r\nunderweight and that almost 1 billion persons lack \r\ndaily access to water. Five years from the 2015 \r\ndeadline, we still have a collective responsibility. We \r\nmust take the opportunity afforded us in this crucial \r\nperiod to find a way to honour our commitments. In \r\nthat regard, I would like to propose making the \r\nPrincipality of Monaco in coming years a special \r\ncentre for promoting the partnership for development \r\nbetween the various public and private stakeholders.  \r\n In addition, beyond our increasing development \r\nefforts, my country will continue to be active on \r\nemergency assistance, especially with regard to \r\nvulnerable groups affected by natural disasters linked \r\nto climate change. \r\n The new millennium has given rise to many \r\nhopes, which have been damped somewhat by the \r\nexplosion of threats pressing on humankind and the \r\nenvironment. During this year devoted to biodiversity \r\nand on the eve of the high-level meeting on that issue, \r\nwe must bear in mind the importance of preserving the \r\nenvironment in which we live. I personally commit \r\nmyself to developing innovative, ethical solutions in \r\nthe areas of biodiversity, climate change and the \r\nsustainable management of water resources.  \r\n More than ever before, we must urgently \r\nmobilize to complete the Rio+20 preparations. \r\nAchieving sustainable development and the MDGs are \r\ninterlinked; we must pursue them synergistically. I am \r\ncertain that the MDGs will not be achieved unless we \r\nbear in mind the concept of sustainability. In that \r\nregard, everyone must be involved in this effort and in \r\nthe decisions taken. Governance should be global, \r\nmultilateral and shared, as espoused by the informal \r\nGlobal Governance Group with which Monaco has \r\nfully associated itself. \r\n As the Indian poet Vikram Seth has written, you \r\nshould never make a child a promise that you cannot or \r\ndo not intend to keep. I am sure that everyone speaking \r\nfrom this rostrum today believes in the urgency of \r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals in the \r\nnext five years. But now is not the time for believing; \r\nnow is the time to act. \r\n The Acting Chair: The General Assembly will \r\nnow hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Mikheil \r\nSaakashvili, President of Georgia. \r\n President Saakashvili: It is a pleasure and a \r\nprivilege to address the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs) review summit this year. As a result of \r\nthe Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2), over the \r\npast decade we have seen significant changes in the \r\nway we approach urgent development needs. Two \r\npillars of this new approach are the introduction of \r\ninnovative financing mechanisms and reliance on the \r\nidea of local ownership.  \r\n First of all, with regard to financing, I think that \r\nthe International Drug Purchase Facility is an excellent \r\nexample of innovation. It could have become just \r\nanother bureaucracy. Instead it has been a spectacular \r\nsuccess that now serves as one of our most efficient \r\ntools in addressing the millennium challenges. Of \r\ncourse we need more money. More money matters. But \r\naid money will not deliver concrete results unless we \r\npay more attention to the essential idea of local \r\nownership.  \r\n If we understand local ownership just as a way of \r\ngiving money to local bureaucrats and then allowing \r\nthem the freedom to spend it, as we have seen in \r\nGeorgia and many other countries throughout the \r\nworld, it would mean giving money to local officials \r\nfor housing with which they would build wonderful \r\nvillas in their native countries or abroad. We have seen \r\nthem given money for education, with which they \r\nwould send their children to the best universities in the \r\nWest or elsewhere, without giving anything to their \r\nown people. They have been given money for health \r\ncare, while hospitals have remained in miserable shape \r\nand people have had no access. However, they would \r\nsend their wives and daughters to give birth in the best \r\nforeign hospitals and enjoy all the other luxuries while \r\nenriching themselves. That is what local ownership \r\nmeans in some countries. \r\n However, the way local ownership should really \r\nbe understood, and as it is understood in the better \r\ncases, is that it inspires and reinforces responsible \r\ngovernance. The Millennium Goals are not only an \r\nexpression of a new global ethics or an absolute \r\neconomic and financial philosophy. The Goals are at \r\nonce global and profoundly local in their political \r\nimportance and impact. They demand local \r\nstakeholders to take political responsibility for success. \r\nCountries simply cannot be stable without reducing \r\npoverty and improving their educational and health \r\ncare systems. \r\n A/65/PV.4\r\n \r\n23 10-54115 \r\n \r\n Nor can the broader world be stable, and we all \r\nknow it. It is not only about terrorism, but also about \r\ntrafficking, illegal immigration and the other scourges \r\nthat no wall can protect us from. We cannot build \r\nwalls; they do not protect. A very smart governor in the \r\nUnited States once said that if he were to build a \r\n50-foot wall, the traffickers would build a 51-foot \r\nladder. We must be smarter, faster, more innovative \r\nand, above all, more united to achieve our goals.  \r\n Yet we face a dilemma when it comes to local \r\nownership that is a modern-day version of the chicken-\r\nand-egg problem. The fight against poverty requires \r\nresponsible and stable local actors. Yet we need to \r\nreduce poverty in order to generate local political \r\nstability. How can we square the circle? It is not \r\nimpossible, but it demands clear vision and dedication. \r\nWith the Assembly’s indulgence, I would like to share \r\nsome of our experiences in Georgia, in the hope that \r\nthese might help to shed light on how to achieve local \r\nownership. \r\n Since 2003, Georgia has made great strides in \r\nfighting poverty, in providing education, employment \r\nand shelter, in improving maternal and child care, in \r\nfighting HIV/AIDS and introducing sustainable \r\nenvironmental practices, which will hopefully help to \r\ninform the work of others, just as we hope to learn \r\nfrom others so we can accelerate our efforts to address \r\nthe MDGs. Our experience has shown that the first \r\nthing we need to develop is a feeling of and capacity \r\nfor local ownership. The essential thing in that regard \r\nis combating corruption.  \r\n Fighting corruption might not be on the official \r\nMDGs list, but all of us know that it is a prerequisite \r\nfor any meaningful progress. It is all about corruption \r\nwhen it comes to starting programmes. When the \r\nMillennium Declaration was signed, Georgia was a \r\nfailed State crippled by decaying infrastructure and \r\nsystemic corruption. Billions of dollars in aid had \r\namounted to essentially next to nothing. Electricity was \r\noff more than it was on. Pension payments rarely made \r\ntheir way to the elderly. Educational opportunities were \r\nallotted based on bribes rather than merit. The vast \r\nmajority of aid enriched those in power, rather than \r\nbenefiting those desperately in need. \r\n The 2003 Rose Revolution dramatically changed \r\nthe playing field. Fighting corruption was the first goal \r\nof my Government, and we implemented radical legal, \r\nlegislative and practical measures needed to confront \r\ncorruption head-on. It is no accident that in the \r\nfollowing years Georgia started to make considerable \r\nprogress towards addressing the MDGs. We have \r\nfought poverty and hunger, both directly and by \r\nproviding employment. That has included focusing on \r\nrapid economic development and job creation, creating \r\na favourable investment climate to attract foreign \r\ndirect investment, reforming the pension system and \r\nexpanding the social network for pensioners and other \r\nsocially vulnerable groups. \r\n In 2003, our poverty rate was more than 42 per \r\ncent. Now it is less than 18 per cent. Extreme \r\npoverty — people living on less than $1.50 per day — \r\nstood at 18 per cent. Now it is less than 6 per cent. The \r\nprogress we have made encourages us to continue our \r\nwork. Of course, when we talk about 6 per cent, it is \r\n6 per cent too much. When we talk about 18 per cent, it \r\nis 18 per cent too much.  \r\n Improving education — another Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goal — is an essential element of our \r\neconomic vision, including leading people out of \r\npoverty. We have expanded universal primary \r\neducation to a 12-year programme. We also have \r\nintroduced new professional training schools to enable \r\npeople to participate in the economy. We have \r\nintroduced an ambitious English language education \r\nprogramme and invited 10,000 teachers who are native \r\nEnglish speakers to our schools in order to ensure that \r\nour next generation will have a world of opportunity \r\nopen to them. We are initiating the construction and \r\noperation of a new world-class technological university \r\nin Batumi, the most wonderful city of the Black Sea. \r\nWe are willing to channel tremendous sums of money \r\nto make that university come into being and work to \r\ncreate the highest world standards for our country and \r\nfor our region. \r\n Again, however, building schools and putting \r\nmoney into programmes is not enough. We must \r\nempower stakeholders in the education system, making \r\nthem feel responsible — in other words, endowing \r\nthem with a sense of local ownership. That is why I am \r\nproud that Georgia was the first post-Soviet country to \r\nintroduce nationwide self-governance of schools.  \r\n Since 2003, Georgia has also been working to \r\nmassively overhaul our health care system to enhance \r\ntransparency in the health insurance and \r\npharmaceutical markets. We also have a comprehensive \r\nHIV/AIDS programme, including programmes that \r\nA/65/PV.4  \r\n \r\n10-54115 24 \r\n \r\ntarget high-risk groups, treatment programmes for \r\nthose in need and education campaigns to slow the \r\nspread of this disease and lessen the social stigma \r\nassociated with it.  \r\n We have also tried to address some of the \r\nsecondary illnesses often related to HIV, including \r\ntuberculosis and hepatitis-B. The establishment of \r\ntuberculosis rooms in primary health care facilities \r\nresulted in daily direct observation of drug intake, \r\nwhich rose from 28 per cent to almost 98 per cent. On \r\nthis and other health care issues, Sandra Elisabeth \r\nRoelofs is taking the lead and following the \r\nprogrammes. She also happens to be my wife. She \r\nworks not only as the director of a foundation but also \r\nas a medical nurse in hospitals who attends deliveries \r\nand cares for other patients. That is why I happen to \r\nknow this subject so well. \r\n Our work is also focused on maternal and child \r\nhealth and includes nationwide initiatives to improve \r\nfamily planning and more comprehensive care for \r\nexpecting mothers and newborns. This is an area in \r\nwhich the private sector has been integrally involved. \r\nWe believe that it will help us to provide sustainable \r\nlong-term solutions for improvement across Georgia. \r\n Georgia was the first country to serve as a pilot \r\nfor the World Health Organization course in modern \r\nevidence-based obstetric and neonatal care, which \r\nresulted in reducing caesarian sections to 10 per cent of \r\nall deliveries and episiotomy rates from 69 per cent to \r\n9 per cent, as well as an increase in partner-attended \r\ndeliveries from 0 per cent to 91 per cent. \r\n We are fortunate that our revolution was driven as \r\nmuch by women reformers as men. As a result, this \r\nnew and vibrant Georgia has created many \r\nopportunities for women and inspired them to \r\nparticipate in the economy and political life. We \r\ncontinue to look for ways to improve gender equality \r\nin Georgian society and encourage women to seek \r\nelective office. We now have more women in \r\nGovernment, Parliament and at every level of public \r\nlife.  \r\n Finally, I would like to say a quick word on \r\nenvironmental sustainability. If there is one lesson that \r\na former Soviet republic should have learned from \r\nSoviet planning, it is that economic growth should \r\nnever come at the expense of the environment. In \r\naddressing Georgia’s economic development, we have \r\nsought to ensure that we do so in accordance with safe \r\nenvironmental practices. In fact, the transformation of \r\nour energy sector was achieved primarily through \r\ninvestment in hydro-power generation, which is a \r\nclean, safe and renewable source of energy. \r\n We do, of course, have one major environmental \r\nconcern at the moment, but it relates to the situation in \r\nRussian-occupied Abkhazia, where, unfortunately, the \r\nGovernment of Georgia currently has no ability to \r\nintervene to preserve the environment. We are greatly \r\nconcerned about the environmental impact of the \r\nresource-stripping occurring in Abkhazia in support of \r\nthe construction of the venues for the 2014 Olympic \r\nGames to be held in the bordering Russian resort of \r\nSochi.  \r\n I would ask our partners to help us carefully \r\nmonitor this situation because, if the MDGs are to be \r\nachieved, we need to avoid black holes of governance. \r\nToday, 20 per cent of Georgia consists of such black \r\nholes. This is why I ask the whole Assembly to support \r\nthe implementation of Georgia’s proposed engagement \r\nstrategy with all the occupied territories, which offers a \r\nvariety of people-to-people programmes. Even if we \r\nhave around 500,000 refugees and internally displaced \r\npersons from these territories and most of those \r\nterritories are virtually devoid of people, we do not \r\nwant any of our remaining citizens there to be left \r\nbehind by development plans. The implementation of \r\nthis strategy will not be possible without the serious \r\ninvolvement of the international community. \r\n Georgia’s success in overcoming the plague of \r\nunderdevelopment would not have been the same \r\nwithout its MDGs programme. The MDGs make it \r\neasier to form partnerships that can address local needs \r\nmore efficiently and effectively. This new mechanism \r\nof international integration is a great tool for \r\ndeveloping countries with responsible and responsive \r\nGovernments. In Georgia, where we saw corruption \r\ndestroying our nation, we were fortunate to still have \r\nfood in our bellies and the ability to organize ourselves \r\nto fight against those who believed that self-enrichment \r\nwas a right of leadership.  \r\n But I am realistic that, in many places, people can \r\nworry only about their own survival and that of their \r\nchildren, leaving them little time to dream of what a \r\nbetter future might look like. So it is vital today to \r\nspeak for those who cannot speak for themselves. \r\nFighting corruption and creating a sense of local \r\nownership are essential for the upcoming last five \r\n A/65/PV.4\r\n \r\n25 10-54115 \r\n \r\nyears of the Millennium Development Goals \r\nprogramme and beyond. \r\n The Acting Chair: The General Assembly will \r\nnow hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Ahmed \r\nAbdallah Sambi, President of the Union of the \r\nComoros. \r\n President Sambi (spoke in French): The efforts \r\nmade by countries individually and collectively to \r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \r\nhave produced progress in many areas. Nevertheless, \r\nmost of the scourges we identified in 2000 have not yet \r\nbeen eliminated. Some have even worsened, expanding \r\nthe scale of the challenges we have to overcome by \r\n2015.  \r\n Like other countries, the Union of the Comoros \r\nhas made remarkable progress on some of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals despite the difficult \r\neconomic and financial situation in which it currently \r\nfinds itself, especially as regards the lack of resources \r\nand, in particular, of an investment budget. That has \r\nled to many other delays in meeting other MDGs.  \r\n We have great hopes with regard to primary \r\neducation and child health. Between 1991 and 2008, \r\nprimary school enrolment rates increased from 63 per \r\ncent to 76 per cent and the percentage of children \r\ncompleting primary education increased from 41 per \r\ncent to 57 per cent. Similarly, between 1991 and 2007, \r\nunder-five child mortality dropped from 130 to 66 per \r\n1,000 live births, while mortality for children under \r\none year of age fell from 86 to 49 per 1,000 live births. \r\nWe very much hope to reach the relevant targets in that \r\nregard with minimal support from our partners. \r\n On the other hand, it will be very difficult for us \r\nto achieve the targets on employment and the \r\nenvironment. My country has experienced too many \r\ndelays in those areas, and our implementation of \r\npolicies and strategies has been hampered by numerous \r\nfinancing and institutional capacity problems. \r\nNevertheless, we will continue to redouble our efforts \r\nto overcome those challenges. \r\n Our planet faces an exceedingly serious situation \r\nfrom climate change, as was noted in Rio de Janeiro \r\n17 years ago. We should therefore take this opportunity \r\nto mobilize in our common desire to act to create a \r\ncleaner and more viable world and to make the \r\nnecessary commitments to put us in a position to save \r\nthe world and, in particular, small island States \r\nthreatened with submersion by rising seas.  \r\n By 2025, sea level rise could lead to the \r\ndisplacement of a large part of my country’s population \r\nand to the destruction of parts of our economic \r\ninfrastructure. Forecasts made in 2003 indicate that \r\nthere will be a decrease in the availability of water \r\nowing to the drying up of 63 out of 75 rivers surveyed \r\nthroughout our islands in 1960. In addition, over the \r\npast 30 years we have experienced annual temperature \r\nincreases of one Celsius degree. That increase has had \r\na negative impact on socio-economic development by \r\nserving to expand the spread of malaria and other \r\ncontagious diseases. There could also be a dramatic \r\nimpact on security and on tourism, which is one of the \r\nsectors on which our country’s economic growth is \r\nbased. \r\n I would like to emphasize that the Union of the \r\nComoros has enormous potential in terms of \r\nhydroelectric, solar, wind and geothermal resources. \r\nFinancial and technical assistance to exploit that \r\nenergy will make it possible for us to participate in the \r\nglobal mitigation effort and to improve the economic \r\nand social well-being of the people of the Comoros. \r\n I believe that the limited progress made in \r\nachieving the MDGs is due in large part to inadequate \r\nfinancing for development. The poorest and most \r\nvulnerable countries often have very limited access to \r\nofficial development assistance. The assessment of the \r\ncosts and needs necessary to achieve the MDGs carried \r\nout in developing countries at the recommendation of \r\nthe 2005 World Summit led those countries to adopt \r\nvery ambitious development plans that were not \r\nfinancially sustainable without appropriate international \r\nassistance. The Union of the Comoros has limited \r\ndomestic resources, and our programmes speed up the \r\nachievement of the MDGs appear unrealistic against that \r\nbackdrop. We are therefore prioritizing our ambitions in \r\nthe context of a programme of action for our \r\ndevelopment strategy that is based on achieving the \r\nMDGs. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to express our great \r\nhope that this summit will be a historic success so that \r\nmultilateralism and international solidarity live on. \r\n The Acting Chair: The General Assembly will \r\nnow hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Gjorge \r\nIvanov, President of the former Yugoslav Republic of \r\nMacedonia. \r\nA/65/PV.4  \r\n \r\n10-54115 26 \r\n \r\n President Ivanov (spoke in Macedonian; English \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): At the \r\noutset, let me take this opportunity to extend my \r\ngratitude to the Secretary-General and to all those \r\ninvolved in the preparation and organization of this \r\nmeeting for their leadership and commitment to keep \r\nus focused on the Millennium Development Goals. I \r\nam honoured to have this opportunity to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly at this moment when we all remain \r\nunited in our desire to build a future with more hope \r\nand a new era of prosperity where everyone will be \r\ngiven a chance to live in dignity. \r\n We live in a time when the world is slowly \r\ncoming out of the global economic crisis. We must not \r\nforget that an economic and financial crisis is always a \r\nhumanitarian crisis as well, because it brings poverty \r\nto many people. The slow progress in the eradication of \r\nextreme poverty is yet another problem, as are \r\nnumerous other challenges such as conflicts, food \r\ninsecurity and increasing inequality among the world’s \r\ncountries and regions.  \r\n We are also experiencing a rapid increase in the \r\nnumber and intensity of natural and human-caused \r\ndisasters. In conditions where climate change is \r\naccelerating, such disasters could result in more \r\ncasualties and greater material damage. Neither \r\ndeveloping nor developed countries are spared the \r\neffects of such disasters. We must therefore take \r\nimmediate action. Strong political will is necessary. We \r\nall know what our countries and international \r\norganizations have already achieved and we are all \r\naware of the future challenges and tasks. However, not \r\nall countries and regions of the world face the same \r\nchallenges. \r\n The region of South-East Europe, to which my \r\ncountry belongs, has made tangible progress in \r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals. I recall \r\nthat, as compared to just 10 years ago, the entire region \r\nhas achieved dramatic success. Ten years ago, when \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals were adopted, our \r\nregion was recovering from a traumatic period. Guided \r\nby the idea of a common future in the European Union \r\n(EU) and NATO, and with the dark period of conflict \r\nstill fresh in our minds, all the countries of the region \r\nhave now begun to move their societies towards \r\nprosperous overall regional cooperation. Everyone in \r\nthe region has been focused on the common goal. This \r\nwas a precondition to focusing on the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals as well, and it is thus that we \r\nachieved certain results. \r\n What are the achievements attained by the \r\nRepublic of Macedonia in meeting the Goals? In areas \r\nsuch as reducing health risks and expanding education, \r\nthe Republic of Macedonia has made significant \r\nprogress. There has also been progress in improving \r\nthe environment. However, we can conclude that in \r\nareas such as poverty and the development partnership, \r\nlittle progress has been made.  \r\n There is a reason that there has been insufficient \r\nprogress in those sectors. For many in this Hall, it may \r\nbe strange to hear that, in part, the reasons for \r\ninadequate development should be sought in actions \r\ntaken by an EU and NATO member State. \r\nUnfortunately, I must tell the Assembly that the \r\neconomic development of the Republic of Macedonia \r\nis being hampered by our immediate neighbour.  \r\n A problem has been imposed on us concerning \r\nthe name of my country. That is not only a political \r\nproblem; it also has serious implications for our \r\neconomic development and for attracting foreign \r\ninvestment, which can directly reduce poverty and \r\nunemployment. Fifteen years after the first trade \r\nembargo by the Hellenic Republic, Macedonia today \r\nfaces a new blockade that is dissimilar to the embargo \r\nof the 1990s, but that has the same consequences.  \r\n It is a fact that Greece is one of the biggest \r\ninvestors in the Republic of Macedonia. But it is also a \r\nfact that the blockades in connection with integration \r\nprocesses indirectly impede our ability to attract other \r\ninvestors and investments. But we are not discouraged. \r\nWe believe that we will soon find a solution with our \r\nneighbour to ensure our European and Euro-Atlantic \r\nfuture, and thus the prosperity of our citizens. We are \r\nindeed ready for that. \r\n The Republic of Macedonia remains committed \r\nto reducing poverty and social exclusion. We therefore \r\nstarted with the preparation of a national strategy for \r\nsocial inclusion. I believe this strategic framework will \r\nhelp us improve social cohesion.  \r\n We give special attention to the Roma community \r\nin the Republic of Macedonia. We have designated the \r\nperiod 2005 to 2015 Roma Inclusion Decade, with the \r\nintention of helping this vulnerable, socially excluded \r\ncommunity on the margins of society to become \r\nintegrated in every social sphere. This is a huge task, \r\n A/65/PV.4\r\n \r\n27 10-54115 \r\n \r\nwhich we are implementing in close cooperation with \r\nUnited Nations agencies. \r\n Today Macedonia can probably boast that it \r\nprovides the best treatment for this vulnerable \r\npopulation, not merely in the region but well beyond. \r\nIn the Republic of Macedonia the Roma population has \r\nits own local self-government, schools, media and \r\neverything that makes for the normal life of a \r\ncommunity. From the independence of the Republic of \r\nMacedonia to the present, the Roma have had their \r\nown representatives in the parliament, the Government \r\nand all areas of State administration. We are ready to \r\nshare our positive experiences and lessons learned with \r\nall. \r\n The key to individual success and social progress \r\nlies in comprehensive education, and therefore both \r\nprimary and secondary school in the Republic of \r\nMacedonia are mandatory. We are increasing the \r\nopportunities for and investment in further education \r\nfor young people every day, and the Republic has \r\nimplemented a project titled “A Computer for Every \r\nStudent”. \r\n We are aware of the synergy of the various \r\nMDGs. Accelerating progress in one area entails doing \r\nthe same for other areas. Such synergy has been \r\nbrought to bear in the Republic of Macedonia in the \r\narea of maternal and child health, resulting in lower \r\nchild mortality. In addition, we are committed to \r\ncombating HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and other serious \r\ndiseases. \r\n However, there are issues that require a global \r\nresponse. The consequences of climate change are \r\nalready a reality. We therefore need to act jointly to \r\nadapt to climate change and for disaster risk reduction.  \r\n In the spirit of cooperation and solidarity, we are \r\noptimistic that the Millennium Development Goals will \r\nbe attained. We will continue to work constructively \r\nand to be fully committed. \r\n The Acting Chair: The General Assembly will \r\nnow hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Jens \r\nStoltenberg, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of \r\nNorway. \r\n Mr. Stoltenberg (Norway): Ten years ago I \r\nsigned the Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2) \r\nhere in New York together with other world leaders. \r\nWe promised to improve the livelihoods of millions of \r\npeople all over the globe. For the first time world \r\nleaders made concrete commitments to reduce poverty \r\nand provide access to education, health and other basic \r\nservices. We have five years to make good on those \r\npromises. \r\n And we have made progress. Hundreds of \r\nmillions have been lifted out of desperate poverty. \r\nMore children than ever before are in school. Millions \r\nof lives have been saved through vaccination and \r\nimproved health services, clean water and better \r\nsanitation. However, we are still lagging in the \r\nachievement of our goals. Our task has been made even \r\nmore challenging by the global financial crisis, the \r\ndramatic effects of climate change and the international \r\nfood crisis. And many countries have defaulted on their \r\npromises. \r\n More than one per cent of Norway’s gross \r\nnational income is allocated to development assistance, \r\nand we are committed to retaining that level. I \r\nencourage other countries to follow our example. Many \r\nhave the capacity to do so, even in difficult economic \r\ntimes. I call on developing countries to mobilize more \r\nof their domestic resources, by broadening their tax \r\nbase, by fighting corruption, by increasing \r\ntransparency and improving accountability. Illicit \r\nfinancial flows from developing countries are \r\nestimated to be more than six times their total annual \r\ndevelopment assistance. This drain on vital resources \r\nfor development must be stopped. \r\n Norway is a staunch supporter of all the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). We have \r\ntaken on special responsibility for the goals of reducing \r\nchild mortality and improving maternal health. These \r\nare the goals that are lagging furthest behind. But they \r\nare within reach if the world makes an extra effort. It is \r\nin our power to save those millions of women and \r\nchildren by 2015 — to save them from dying from \r\neasily preventable causes, simply by providing basic \r\nhealth services, clean water and vaccines, services that \r\nevery child in every developed country receives as a \r\nmatter of routine. That is why Norway has tripled its \r\naid for global health since we met here 10 years ago. \r\n We have worked with a network of global leaders \r\nto develop effective policies for maternal and child \r\nhealth, policies that reward results. Donors and \r\ntaxpayers need to see results from their investments. \r\nPartner countries must do their part. To access new and \r\nadditional resources, they must develop their own \r\nA/65/PV.4  \r\n \r\n10-54115 28 \r\n \r\nhealth systems and deliver basic services to their own \r\ncitizens.  \r\n The health of our populations decides the \r\neconomic health of our nations. Health is a vital driver \r\nof development. I therefore commend the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his leadership in bringing our collective \r\nefforts to a new level. His Global Strategy for Women’s \r\nand Children’s Health deserves our wholehearted \r\nsupport. I call on all countries and leaders gathered \r\nhere this week to support the Strategy with concrete \r\npolitical and financial commitments. \r\n The Millennium Development Goals cannot be \r\nseen in isolation from climate change, armed conflict \r\nand women’s empowerment. All countries will be \r\naffected by climate change. But the most vulnerable — \r\nthe poorest countries and peoples, those who have \r\ncontributed least to the causes of climate change — \r\nwill suffer most.  \r\n It is in regions affected by armed conflict and \r\nviolence that we have made the least progress. And we \r\nknow that the single most important catalyst for change \r\nis women’s empowerment. We must honour our solemn \r\npromises made 10 years ago here in New York, \r\nbuilding on the visions of the United Nations Charter, \r\nin which so much hope is enshrined. \r\n The Acting Chair: The General Assembly will \r\nnow hear an address by His Excellency Tuilaepa \r\nSailele Malielegaoi, Prime Minister, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs and Minister for Finance of the \r\nIndependent State of Samoa. \r\n Mr. Malielegaoi (Samoa): The Millennium \r\nDeclaration (resolution 55/2) is our collective \r\nreaffirmation that all people deserve to live in dignity, \r\nfree from the dehumanizing conditions of extreme \r\npoverty in its many dimensions. The Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) represent a vision of \r\nconcrete and measurable achievement — not mere \r\naspirations of what might be, but tangible outcomes of \r\nwhat should be. Being time-bound, with quantified \r\ntargets, the MDGs respond more to our hopes than our \r\nfears. Such a vision is rooted in the concept of a \r\npeaceful, prosperous and just world for everyone to \r\nlive in and enjoy. \r\n The Millennium Development Goals have been at \r\nthe top of the world’s development agenda for a decade \r\nnow. Today, we take stock of our progress to help us \r\nmake decisions to meet the Goals by the 2015 target \r\ndate. The level of achievement will vary across regions \r\nand among individual countries, but it would be a \r\nmistake at this review to be defensive or to assign \r\nblame for failures if some of the MDG targets are not \r\nyet on track to be met by 2015. After all, this should be \r\nan honest self-assessment to identify the gaps and \r\nobstacles in achieving the goals and the remedial \r\nactions required to hasten meeting them in the time \r\nremaining. \r\n Our choices are limited. Postponing the deadline \r\nto attain the MDG targets must not be an option; if we \r\ndo, we risk assigning more of our people to remain and \r\nslip into destitution. The next five years will be vital. \r\nThey will determine whether the Goals will become \r\ntangible realties for everyone to enjoy, or mere \r\naspirations of what might have been but out of reach \r\nfor the majority of people. \r\n Samoa is committed to achieving the MDGs by \r\n2015. The Goals, by their very nature, are a \r\nrestatement of our own people’s development needs \r\nand hopes. As a Government, we have to respond \r\naccordingly. Our MDGs current scorecard is neither \r\nperfect nor desperate. Indeed, our level of achievement \r\nis substantial, but the true value of the exercise for us \r\nis in pinpointing areas for consolidation and where \r\ngreater effort must focus in the next five years. \r\n Mr. Carrión Mena (Ecuador), Vice-President of \r\nthe General Assembly, took the Chair. \r\n From this point forward, Samoa would need to \r\nwork hard to maintain our current gains and to further \r\nimprove our performance particularly on those goals \r\nwhere our track record to date has not been \r\nsatisfactory. Amongst these is the proportion of the \r\npopulation living below the basic needs poverty line, \r\nparticularly when considered against the gains \r\nachieved in the overall economy through a growth-\r\noriented macroeconomic policy framework.  \r\n Additionally, we need to ensure that there is \r\nexpanded and comprehensive coverage and effective \r\nservice delivery of preventive measures for children’s \r\nhealth through greater community participation. \r\nSimilarly greater emphasis would be placed on further \r\nstrengthening a rights-based approach to facilitate \r\nuniversal access for women to such reproductive health \r\nservices as voluntary family planning, information and \r\ncounselling. \r\n A/65/PV.4\r\n \r\n29 10-54115 \r\n \r\n Samoa recognizes that gender equality, the \r\nempowerment of women and their full enjoyment of all \r\nhuman rights are essential to economic and social \r\ndevelopment, including the achievement of all MDGs. \r\nThe empowerment of women through increased \r\nrepresentation in Parliament will continue be a \r\nchallenge, given existing social structures. However, \r\nwe have set out under MDG 3 the reality of the \r\nsituation of Samoan women. This, as well as the full \r\nrecord of Samoa’s performance over the past 10 years, \r\nis contained in Samoa’s Millennium Development \r\nGoals second progress report for the year 2010. \r\n The global recession and other crises, natural and \r\nman-made, have constrained our efforts, even with the \r\nbest of political will. The aftermath of the tsunami that \r\nstruck Samoa almost a year ago inevitably affected the \r\nprogress of our MDG-linked efforts. However, the \r\nsupport of the international community, particularly \r\nour development partners and friends of Samoa \r\nworldwide, ensured that recovery was not delayed and \r\nthat our MDG work could therefore be brought back on \r\ntrack. We are very grateful. \r\n In a few days’ time, the United Nations will \r\nreview the Mauritius Strategy for the Further \r\nImplementation of the Barbados Programme of Action \r\nafter its first five years. The Mauritius Strategy \r\nprovides a comprehensive blueprint for addressing the \r\nnational and regional sustainable development of small \r\nisland developing States (SIDs) like Samoa. In many \r\nways, the Millennium Development Goals would also \r\nbe considered as a normative framework for SIDs’ \r\ndevelopment targets, and the Mauritius Strategy for \r\nImplementation as providing some of the key inputs for \r\ntheir achievement. \r\n Thus, within the architecture of the different \r\nUnited Nations global frameworks, the Mauritius \r\nStrategy should continue to be a primary vehicle \r\nthrough which the international community must \r\nengage with the small island developing countries in \r\norder to assist them respond effectively to their special \r\nvulnerabilities. The success of the Strategy would \r\nnecessarily support the achievement of the MDGs. \r\n Isolation from the rest of the world is a \r\nvulnerability common to all the Pacific SIDS and \r\nremains a major impediment to the growth of their \r\neconomies. Overcoming this remoteness would \r\nenhance the islands’ resilience to the many challenges \r\nthey face individually and collectively. Infrastructure \r\ndevelopment, particularly in telecommunications, will \r\nprovide the answer to much of the region’s \r\ndevelopment needs across the board in terms of distant \r\neducation, telemedicine, tourism, education, health, \r\nfisheries and agriculture. The availability of such \r\ncritical infrastructure would greatly reduce the digital \r\ndivide and the islands’ isolation, and ensure the \r\nsustainability of their economic development. \r\n Finally, the draft outcome document of our \r\nmeeting should re-energize the resolve of our Member \r\nStates to deliver on their respective commitments and \r\nresponsibilities; if it does not, the success of our global \r\nundertaking for a better future for the world will \r\ncontinue to remain elusive. \r\n The Acting Chair (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by His Excellency \r\nMr. Yves Leterme, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of \r\nBelgium. \r\n Mr. Leterme (Belgium) (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of my country, Belgium, I would like to convey \r\nfour messages that we consider to be essential. \r\n First, we believe that the core objectives of our \r\ncommon efforts for development are and should always \r\nbe human development and poverty eradication. \r\nHuman development is much more than a matter of \r\neconomic growth or environmental policy; it is about \r\nputting people at the centre of development and \r\nhelping them to realize their potential, enhance their \r\nchoices and enjoy the freedom to decide their own \r\nfutures. And poverty is much more than a lack of \r\nincome and material wealth. It is also a factor for \r\nsocial and cultural exclusion and, in practice, prevents \r\nthe enjoyment of fundamental rights. Putting people at \r\nthe centre of development is giving access to education \r\nand to culture in the broad sense. \r\n Our second message today is an alarm bell. The \r\nmajor stumbling-block on the road to achieving the \r\nMDG’s is growing inequality — inequality not only \r\nbetween countries and between North and South, but \r\nalso within countries themselves. There is now plenty \r\nof evidence about growing disparities within a majority \r\nof countries. Unfortunately, reports on the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals often do not reveal this, as the \r\ntargets and indicators have been designed to measure \r\nprogress by means of averages. This can lead to the \r\nparadox whereby a country as a whole progresses, \r\nwhile some population groups — the underprivileged, \r\nA/65/PV.4  \r\n \r\n10-54115 30 \r\n \r\nwomen and rural populations, for instance — are worse \r\noff in relative and even in absolute terms. \r\n Mrs. Graça Mandela-Machel denounced this \r\nwhen she pointed out  \r\n “the obscene gap between those many struggling \r\npoor and the few who are rich. … The ‘first \r\nworld’ also exists in the southern hemisphere. … \r\nThere are rich people in Africa amidst abject \r\npoverty.”  \r\n United Nations reports show how gender \r\ndisparities are at the very heart of the inequality issue: \r\ngender inequality in education, inequality in access to \r\ndecent work and inequality in the benefits of health \r\ncare, along with the alarming fact that in developing \r\ncountries only one out of three rural women receive the \r\nrecommended care during pregnancy. \r\n Thus in our view, dealing with inequalities is the \r\npriority among priorities. This is not only a matter of \r\nfairness; it is also a matter of sound economic \r\nmanagement, for lower inequality tends to be \r\ncorrelated with economic growth that is more durable.  \r\n This leads me to a third message: concrete \r\nprogress towards achieving the Millennium Goals is \r\nnot only a matter of financial means, but is also a \r\nmatter of political will and good governance in each \r\ncountry.  \r\n Policies that succeed in reaching the Millennium \r\nGoals will be policies geared towards inclusive \r\ndevelopment, policies that aim at maximum citizen \r\nparticipation in wealth creation and at creating \r\nopportunities for the poorest populations. That \r\nnecessarily requires accountable, participatory and \r\nefficient governance that enables people to have a say \r\nin the way in which they are governed, in the way \r\ndecisions are made and implemented and in the way \r\nresources are allocated. \r\n To quote the Zambian agronomist and lecturer \r\nTamala Tonga Kambikambi: \r\n “An effective, stable and accountable \r\nGovernment is essential in the fight against \r\npoverty. It should protect human rights, provide \r\nsecurity, promote economic growth and deliver \r\nessential services.” \r\n Finally, my fourth message is a reminder of our \r\ncollective responsibility and of the global partnership \r\nfor which the Millennium Declaration calls. This idea \r\nof global partnership led most donor countries — \r\ndecades ago, it should be said — to commit themselves \r\nto increase their aid volume to 0.7 per cent of their \r\nGDP. In spite of the financial and economic crisis, \r\nBelgium has reconfirmed this target in its 2010 budget.  \r\n Moreover, the solution to global problems we are \r\ndiscussing requires not only global government but \r\nalso global financing. As one of the initiators of the \r\ngroup that considers innovative financing, we work \r\nhard for a broader agreement on the subject, within the \r\nEuropean Union but also on a worldwide scale. \r\n Beyond quantities of aid however, we should, \r\nmore than in the past, look at aid allocation and aid \r\nmodalities. Aid policies should first help countries to \r\ntake their fate into their own hands and make them less \r\ndependent on aid.  \r\n The partnership we desire is one among countries \r\nthat are more aware than they are today of their \r\nresponsibilities and conscious of their duties, with \r\nsome being in a position to help and others realizing \r\nthey can be helped only if the help themselves. \r\n The Acting Chair (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by His Excellency \r\nKlaus Tschütscher, head of Government, Minister for \r\nGeneral Government Affairs, Minister for Finance and \r\nMinister for Family and Equal Opportunity of the \r\nPrincipality of Liechtenstein.  \r\n Mr. Tschütscher (Liechtenstein): Ten years ago \r\nworld leaders gathered in New York and agreed on the \r\nMillennium Declaration (resolution 55/2), one of the \r\nnoblest efforts ever undertaken in the framework of the \r\nUnited Nations. The world’s leaders promised to spare \r\nno effort to free our fellow men, women and children \r\nfrom the abject and dehumanizing conditions of \r\nextreme poverty. \r\n The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are \r\nthe centrepiece of the most broadly supported \r\nmultilateral development campaign in history. They \r\nconstitute the benchmark by which we will measure \r\nsuccess in 2015 and are one of the landmark \r\nachievements of the Organization. The Millennium \r\nDeclaration was complemented by the 2005 World \r\nSummit Outcome (resolution 60/1), which firmly \r\nestablished that development, peace and security, and \r\nhuman rights are interlinked. The activities of the \r\nUnited Nations are based on all three of these equal \r\nand complementary pillars. \r\n A/65/PV.4\r\n \r\n31 10-54115 \r\n \r\n We welcome the adoption of the outcome \r\ndocument (A/65/L.1) later this week as an important \r\nreaffirmation of the international consensus in the field \r\nof development. The constructive and successful \r\nnegotiation process has strengthened the United \r\nNations as the centre of global governance. The \r\noutcome document presents concrete measures that \r\nwill help us achieve each of the MDGs. \r\n All efforts towards realization of the MDGs are \r\nmutually reinforcing because all the Goals are \r\ninterlinked. Unfortunately, some crucial challenges that \r\nwill have to be addressed as a matter of priority have \r\nnot received the required attention in the outcome \r\ndocument. Armed violence and conflict, for example, \r\nare a constant threat to human security and the rule of \r\nlaw and as such represent a major impediment to \r\ndevelopment. Preventing and ending armed violence \r\nand conflict must be at the core of every sustainable \r\ndevelopment effort. That requires, in particular, \r\ndetermined action to eradicate impunity for those who \r\nuse violence against civilians as a tactic of war. \r\n With two thirds of the road to 2015 behind us, we \r\nhave a wealth of experience with factors conducive and \r\ndetrimental to sustainable development. We know that \r\ndevelopment achievements remain fragile if they are \r\nnot supported by serious efforts to strengthen good \r\ngovernance, the rule of law, human rights, gender \r\nequality and an active civil society. \r\n Liechtenstein continues to support such efforts by \r\nprioritizing education projects in its bilateral \r\ndevelopment assistance, with a particular emphasis on \r\nprojects empowering women. We are also keenly aware \r\nof the problem of illicit capital outflows from \r\ndeveloping countries. This problem must be addressed \r\non both the demand and supply sides. \r\n We have been a long-standing supporter of \r\ninitiatives that build good-governance capacities, for \r\nexample through the fight against corruption and the \r\nrecovery of stolen assets that have been transferred \r\nabroad. Liechtenstein fully implements international \r\nstandards against money laundering, as well as \r\ninternationally recognized standards of transparency \r\nand exchange of information in the field of tax \r\ncooperation. \r\n The international partnership for development is \r\nof particular importance for the achievement of all \r\nMDGs. As of today, our official development \r\nassistance (ODA) represents about 0.6 per cent of our \r\ngross national income. We fully recognize the \r\nbenchmark of 0.7 per cent ODA as an internationally \r\nagreed development goal and will continue to do so, \r\ndespite temporary domestic budget constraints as a \r\nconsequence of the financial and economic crisis. \r\n Liechtenstein is particularly committed to \r\naddressing new development challenges in connection \r\nwith climate change. We have signed the Copenhagen \r\nAccord and already set aside the first round of new and \r\nadditional funds to help developing countries address \r\nthese challenges.  \r\n The international partnership for development is \r\nan undertaking that entails collective and individual \r\nresponsibility. A renewed commitment is needed from \r\nall of us to achieve the MDGs by 2015. This gathering \r\nprovides a unique opportunity to do so. We can still \r\nsucceed if we stand united. \r\n The Acting Chair (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by Her Excellency \r\nSheikh Hasina, Prime Minister of the People’s \r\nRepublic of Bangladesh. \r\n Sheikh Hasina (Bangladesh): I am pleased to \r\naddress the High-level Plenary Meeting on the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). I am \r\nparticularly pleased because I was one of the 189 \r\nHeads of State and Government who adopted the \r\nMillennium Declaration and the MDGs during the \r\nUnited Nations Millennium Summit in September \r\n2000. The Millennium Declaration is the Magna Carta \r\nfor a poverty-free world, and I am glad to have been a \r\npart of its adoption. \r\n The MDGs, which aim at facilitating \r\ndevelopment and eradicating poverty, were adopted by \r\nan unprecedented consensus. This consensus was \r\nreinforced by world leaders at the High-level Plenary \r\nMeeting of the sixtieth session of the General \r\nAssembly. The MDGs have given us a benchmark to \r\nmeasure the performance of national Governments, \r\nprivate sectors, civil bodies, development partners, the \r\nUnited Nations and other intergovernmental bodies. \r\nThe benchmark also provides an opportunity for \r\nassessing progress in achieving the internationally \r\nagreed development targets. \r\n During my last tenure as Prime Minister, our \r\nGovernment took steps to mainstream MDGs in our \r\nnational development plans. The aim was to ensure \r\nnational ownership of the MDGs and to demonstrate \r\nA/65/PV.4  \r\n \r\n10-54115 32 \r\n \r\nour commitment to achieving them by the stipulated \r\ndeadline of 2015. The planning and budgeting process \r\nsince 2001 thus sought to achieve the MDGs as part of \r\nour national development.  \r\n During our present tenure, we have set a five-year \r\nplan to achieve the MDG targets as a step towards \r\nmaking Bangladesh a middle-income country and \r\nestablishing a digital Bangladesh by 2021, the golden \r\njubilee year of our independence. We are on our way to \r\nfinally achieving sonar Bangla, or “golden \r\nBangladesh”, as dreamt by my father and the father of \r\nour nation, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.  \r\n However, the world food and energy crises of the \r\npast years, the ensuing global economic recession, \r\nworld trade decline, dismal investments and the impact \r\nof climate change have retarded our pace for achieving \r\nthe MDGs. Yet Bangladesh has been able to achieve \r\nsatisfactory progress with the support of the United \r\nNations system and bilateral and multilateral partners. \r\n Our achievements on MDG 1, on poverty \r\nalleviation; MDG 2, on universal primary education; \r\nand MDG 3, on gender equality and the empowerment \r\nof women, are encouraging and on track. As for \r\nMDG 4, our excellent progress was recognized this \r\nyear by the MDG Awards Committee, the United \r\nNations Millennium Campaign and the United Nations \r\nOffice for Partnerships with the prestigious United \r\nNations award for reducing child mortality. Projections \r\nindicate our success in lifting 12 million people out of \r\npoverty by 2015, thereby reducing poverty by half by \r\nthen, as targeted in MDG 1. \r\n Our success also includes enhancing minimum \r\ndietary energy consumption, net enrolment in primary \r\neducation, gender parity in primary and secondary \r\neducation, reducing child and infant mortality, \r\nimproving immunization coverage, rolling back \r\nmalaria, controlling tuberculosis, low prevalence of \r\nHIV/AIDS, and improved access to safe drinking water \r\nand sanitation. But we are facing difficulties in \r\nachieving other MDGs for lack of resources, such as \r\nthose on the reduction of underweight children, \r\nmaternal mortality and income inequality; the \r\ncompletion of primary education; adult education and \r\nthe ratio of girls to boys in tertiary education; antenatal \r\ncare; the vulnerabilities of women; health for all; the \r\nplanned use of land and urbanization; creativity; \r\nhuman capital and social justice. \r\n A formidable challenge confronting Bangladesh \r\nare erratic and frequently occurring natural disasters \r\ndue to global warming, which are pushing climate \r\nmigrants into our overburdened cities and posing a \r\nthreat to our achievement of MDG 1 by 2015. \r\nEstimates indicate that a 1-metre rise in sea level \r\nwould submerge a quarter of our land mass, displacing \r\n30 million people and making it difficult to sustain a \r\npoverty-free post-2015 era. One in every seven persons \r\nin Bangladesh would be a climate migrant due to the \r\nexcessive greenhouse gas emissions of industrialized \r\ncountries. Sadly, while climate forums debate \r\nadaptation, mitigation, technology transfers, a green \r\nfund, the unfortunate plight of climate migrants is \r\ndeftly sidetracked. I urge the global community to be \r\nsensitive to this emerging challenge and to find \r\ninnovative ways for their rehabilitation. \r\n We deeply appreciate the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport, “Keeping the promise: a forward-looking \r\nreview to promote an agreed action agenda to achieve \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals by 2015” \r\n(A/64/665). The report concludes that the MDG track \r\nrecord is mixed and underlines that, at the global level, \r\nthere exist normative and implementation gaps in terms \r\nof addressing the core development issues. Findings \r\nfrom the recent United Nations Development \r\nProgramme report “What will it take to achieve the \r\nMDGs?”, indicate that the MDGs are achievable when \r\nnationally owned development strategies, policies and \r\nprogrammes are supported by international \r\ndevelopment partners. Bangladesh is in full agreement \r\nwith these findings. \r\n Moreover, Bangladesh is committed to playing a \r\npart in attaining the MDGs by 2015. While the \r\ncountries of the developed world are also committed to \r\ndoing the same, they need to demonstrate their \r\nsincerity by helping to reduce the implementation gap. \r\nClearly, the answer lies in fulfilling their official \r\ndevelopment assistance commitment of 0.7 per cent of \r\ntheir gross national income to developing countries, \r\nand of 0.2 per cent to least developed countries by \r\n2010, as reaffirmed in the Brussels Programme of \r\nAction for the Least Developed Countries. \r\n Meanwhile, with United Nations assistance, \r\nBangladesh has prepared a document entitled “MDG \r\nNeeds Assessment \u0026 Costing Report 2009-2015” for \r\nBangladesh. The report indicates that $22.1 billion will \r\nbe required to attain all MDGs in Bangladesh from \r\n2009 to 2015, implying an outlay of $4.4 billion a year. \r\n A/65/PV.4\r\n \r\n33 10-54115 \r\n \r\nA substantial portion of these funds has to come from \r\ndevelopment partners. These estimates take into \r\naccount global declarations on resource flow to \r\ndeveloping countries, especially the least developed. \r\nThe Monterrey Consensus in particular is a cornerstone \r\nof this ambitious resource budgeting. \r\n Although Bangladesh seeks the external \r\nassistance it needs, its absence has never halted our \r\nprogrammes. We continue with our domestic efforts, as \r\nwe did in the area of sanitation and water supply, \r\nwhere external support fell short by $560 million. \r\n I would like to refer to a seminal comment made \r\nby Ms. Helen Clark, Administrator of the United \r\nNations Development Programme, Chair of the United \r\nNations Development Group and, as the former Prime \r\nMinister of New Zealand, co-signatory of the \r\nMillennium Declaration, who said, “If we are to reach \r\nthe MDGs by 2015, then 2010 must spark five years of \r\naccelerated progress”.  \r\n I agree with Ms. Clark that the global recession, \r\nthe food and fuel crises, the challenges of climate \r\nchange and natural disasters have generally \r\ncomplicated the road to 2015. But they do not make the \r\nMDGs unattainable if we collectively determine and \r\npartner to achieve them. Let us rise and resolve in that \r\nspirit as one community in a globalized world to \r\nachieve all our internationally agreed development \r\ngoals, including the MDGs, thereby serving ourselves, \r\nour progeny and our posterity. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to pledge \r\nBangladesh’s resolve and commitment to the \r\nachievement of the MDGs and beyond. We will \r\nachieve self-sufficiency in food by 2021, but we will \r\ntry to do so earlier. We will ensure 100 per cent net \r\nenrolment at primary school level by 2011, eliminate \r\ngender disparity at all levels of education by 2014, \r\nraise the economic participation of women to 40 per \r\ncent by 2021, reduce maternal mortality by 15 per cent \r\nand infant mortality to 15 per 1,000 live births by \r\n2021, increase life expectancy to 70 years by 2021, \r\nprovide safe drinking water for all by 2011 and \r\nhygienic sanitation by 2013, and achieve a digital \r\nBangladesh for global connectivity by implementing \r\nour national information and communications \r\ntechnology policy by 2021. \r\n The Acting Chair (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nGeneral Assembly will now hear an address by His \r\nExcellency Mr. Mizengo Pinda, Prime Minister of the \r\nUnited Republic of Tanzania. \r\n Mr. Pinda (United Republic of Tanzania): Much \r\nhas happened as we have made national, regional and \r\nglobal efforts to rid the world we share of abject and \r\nunconscionable poverty and to bring decency to the \r\nlives of our fellow human beings. We are here to \r\nrecognize the progress achieved and celebrate the \r\nvaluable partnerships and experiences that have \r\nbrought us this far and that should now form the \r\nbedrock of renewed efforts as we seek to accelerate \r\nprogress based on lessons learned. \r\n It is true that much remains to be done in the five \r\nyears that remain until the target date of 2015, but we \r\ncannot afford to be discouraged. It is true that progress \r\nhas been uneven and that some of the targets will not \r\nbe met unless efforts are significantly stepped up. But \r\nit is also true that the strength and resilience of the \r\nhuman spirit, if fully harnessed, can make the \r\nimpossible possible and the difficult easy. This meeting \r\ntherefore provides us with an opportunity to reaffirm \r\nour commitments and galvanize needed support at all \r\nlevels to ensure that all the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs) are met in all regions of the world by \r\n2015. \r\n My Government believes that the United Nations \r\nis best placed to coordinate and track global \r\ncommitments and efforts to ensure the achievement of \r\nthe MDGs, in particular in those on which we are \r\nlagging behind. We welcome and support the United \r\nNations Strategy on Women’s and Children’s Health \r\nand commend the Secretary-General for his vision and \r\nleadership in the development of the Strategy. \r\n Partnerships lie at the core of the successes \r\nachieved and will determine the level of success we \r\nwill ultimately achieve. Such partnerships include \r\nbilateral and regional partnerships between developed \r\nand developing countries, as well as between \r\ndeveloping countries themselves. They include the \r\nUnited Nations system, as well as partnerships with the \r\ncorporate world and civil society. Without such \r\npartnerships, there is little hope. Let us reaffirm them. \r\n The United Republic of Tanzania reaffirms its \r\ncommitment to achieving the MDGs. Policies \r\nconducive to achievement, including economic and \r\ngovernance reforms, have spurred economic growth \r\naveraging 7 per cent over the past decade, but that is \r\nA/65/PV.4  \r\n \r\n10-54115 34 \r\n \r\nnot enough to achieve all of the MDGs. These policies \r\nwill need to be further strengthened. \r\n Poverty, as measured by the proportion of \r\npopulation earning below $1 a day declined from \r\n38.6 per cent in 1991-1992 to 33.6 per cent in 2006-\r\n2007 for the Tanzania mainland, and from 61 per cent \r\nin 1990 to 49 per cent in 2004 for Zanzibar. This \r\ndecrease does not give us much hope. \r\n In Tanzania, more than 80 per cent of the entire \r\npopulation, which is estimated to be 40 million, live in \r\nrural areas. These 80 per cent depend on agriculture for \r\ntheir livelihoods. If we are to emancipate most Tanzanians \r\nfrom poverty, investments in agriculture are imperative. \r\nIn realizing this fact, the Government has embarked on \r\nthe comprehensive Agriculture First initiative, popularly \r\nknown as Kilimo Kwanza, with the aim of accelerating a \r\ngreen revolution. The Kilimo Kwanza initiative is \r\ncomprised of the training of agriculture extension \r\nofficers; investing in irrigation infrastructure systems and \r\nmechanization, in particular the use of modern \r\ntechnologies including agro-processing; and use inputs \r\nsuch as improved seeds, fertilizers, pesticides and \r\ninsecticides. Furthermore, the initiative aims at addressing \r\nthe critical problem of agricultural financing. \r\n In order to realize these objectives, the \r\nGovernment has continued to increase its budget \r\nallocation to the agricultural sector and to take \r\nmeasures to improve agriculture marketing systems.  \r\n If the Government is to realize the ambitious \r\ngoals enshrined in the Kilimo Kwanza initiative, we \r\nappeal to the institutions of the United Nations, the \r\ninternational community, the private sector and other \r\ndevelopment partners to support our efforts. Given \r\ntimely and predictable support, Tanzania will \r\nundoubtedly realize MDG 1, as we have managed to do \r\nwith regard to MDG 2. We can also do so for the \r\nothers.  \r\n HIV prevalence rates declined from 7 per cent in \r\n2003 to five per cent in 2008 on the Tanzanian \r\nmainland. We are pleased that in Zanzibar the rate has \r\nremained at 0.6 per cent. \r\n Zanzibar has done very well on the issue of \r\nmalaria. The prevalence of malaria shows a drastic \r\ndecreasing trend, from 49.2 per cent in 2000 to 0.8 per \r\ncent in 2009. That outstanding performance puts \r\nZanzibar in the pre-elimination phase. The challenge is \r\nto hold on to this achievement and ensure that Zanzibar \r\nis totally free from malaria, as well as to replicate those \r\nmeasures in mainland Tanzania. The achievements in \r\nZanzibar are a result of key cost-effective interventions \r\nfor prevention — namely, insecticide-treated nets, \r\nindoor residual spraying and intermittent preventive \r\ntreatment in pregnancy — and case management with \r\neffective drugs. \r\n In the area of child mortality, we have made a \r\nlittle progress. Between 1990 and 1999, there was an \r\n11 per cent reduction in under-five mortality rates, \r\nfrom 165 per thousand live births to 147 per thousand \r\nlive births, whereas infant mortality rates increased \r\nfrom 91 to 99 per thousand live births during the same \r\nperiod. Over the past decade, there was a 45 per cent \r\nreduction in the under-five mortality rate and a 49 per \r\ncent reduction in the infant mortality rate. Over the \r\nsame decade, neonatal mortality, which accounts for \r\n50 per cent of infant deaths, decreased by 35 per cent.  \r\n Zanzibar has also made significant progress in the \r\nreduction of under-five and infant mortality. The \r\nunder-five mortality rate dropped from 202 per \r\nthousand live births in 1990 to 101 per thousand in \r\n2004/05, and the infant mortality rate dropped from \r\n120 per thousand live births to 61 per thousand live \r\nbirths in 2005. \r\n Achievements in child health are attributed to health \r\nsector reforms, increased coverage of effective \r\ninterventions, immunization, vitamin A supplementation, \r\nintegrated management of childhood illness, improved \r\nmalaria control through insecticide-treated nets and \r\naccess to effective antimalarial treatment. \r\n We have done well on the education targets. In \r\n1990, the net enrolment ratio in primary education was \r\n54.2 per cent for mainland Tanzania and 50.9 per cent \r\nfor Zanzibar. In 2000, the rates went up to 57.1 per \r\ncent for mainland Tanzania and to 67 per cent for \r\nZanzibar. In 2006, the ratio increased to 94.8 per cent \r\nfor mainland Tanzania and 77 per cent for Zanzibar. \r\nThe net enrolment ratio continued to increase, reaching \r\n95.4 per cent in 2010. \r\n We realized all these results through good \r\npolicies, budgetary increases, comprehensive education \r\nprogrammes and a participatory approach that allows \r\npeople to be in the driver’s seat. These factors have \r\nmade it possible for the Government to expand \r\ncapacities to recruit more teachers and increase \r\neducation materials and classrooms. \r\n A/65/PV.4\r\n \r\n35 10-54115 \r\n \r\n We are committed to do all in our power to \r\naccelerate the implementation of the remaining MDGs \r\nin the next five years. We will strive to do much on our \r\nown, including focusing on economic growth and \r\nsustainable development. But to succeed we count \r\nsignificantly on similarly renewed and expanded \r\ncommitment on the part of our development partners. \r\nWe know what works in achieving the MDGs. With the \r\nrequisite leadership, partnership, commitment and \r\nresources we have the opportunity to keep the \r\nmillennium promise to the world’s people. Let us not \r\nfail them. \r\n The Acting Chair (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by His Excellency \r\nMr. Gilbert Fossoun Houngbo, Prime Minister of the \r\nTogolese Republic. \r\n Mr. Houngbo (Togo) (spoke in French): At the \r\noutset I would like on behalf of the Togolese \r\ndelegation to convey to the Co-Chairs my warm \r\ncongratulations on their election.  \r\n The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \r\nremain and will continue to be relevant for all \r\ndevelopment actors, and all of our efforts should \r\ntherefore be aimed at achieving results, which are the \r\nfoundation of our duty of solidarity for a world \r\ncommitted to peace and justice. \r\n With respect to my country, since 2006 Togo has \r\nprofited from the calm in the political climate to \r\nrelaunch the economic and social development process. \r\nThus my Government adopted its national long-term \r\ndevelopment strategy, which is based on the MDGs, \r\nand that strategy has formed the base for drafting our \r\nPoverty Reduction Strategy Paper. The investment \r\ncosts under the strategy have been estimated at \r\n$7.2 billion between 2006 and 2015. \r\n We have taken measures to improve good \r\ngovernance, we have taken measures to improve the \r\nrule of law, and we have taken measures to foster \r\ntransparent management of public finances, to optimize \r\nmobilization of domestic resources and to reinvest in \r\nsectors that promote growth and in social sectors.  \r\n We have also greatly facilitated access for \r\nfarmers to fertilizers and improved seeds. We have \r\ntaken measures towards better organization of \r\nagricultural producers and the opening of agricultural \r\nareas, among other initiatives. Those measures explain \r\nthe surplus production and economic growth — \r\nmodest, yes, but sustained at more than 3 per cent — \r\nthat Togo has registered despite the world economic \r\nrecession. In fact, I am certain that the growing \r\ncontribution of small farmers to the increase in \r\nproduction, beyond the base level of food security, will \r\nbe one of the principal levers to bring about growth of \r\nthe Togolese economy to at least 7 per cent, so as to \r\nreverse the trend to poverty. \r\n The framework for acceleration of MDG 1 has \r\npermitted us to analyze the obstacles to the \r\nimprovement of agricultural productivity and to \r\npropose solutions for acceleration that have already \r\nbeen proven. For MDG 1 this entails financing needs \r\nof $225 million, whose mobilization will make \r\npossible advances in wealth creation and poverty \r\nreduction in rural areas. We also need to further invest \r\nin infrastructures to continue to provide better access \r\nfor areas of production, create markets and process our \r\nproducts. \r\n In the area of education, the establishment of free \r\nprimary education has enabled us to improve schooling \r\nrates from 74 per cent in 2006 to 87 per cent in 2008. \r\nBut in the long term we cannot focus all our efforts \r\nsolely on primary education. It is important also to \r\ninvest in secondary and higher education — and \r\nespecially in research. \r\n With regard to health, the prevalence of \r\nHIV/AIDS has been cut in half, and care for affected \r\npersons has been improved by improving access to free \r\ntreatment. With respect to infant health, integrated \r\ncampaigns for vaccination and for the distribution of \r\ntreated mosquito nets have enabled us to considerably \r\nreduce infant mortality rates.  \r\n We should therefore like to thank all of our \r\npartners, who, for a number of years in the wake of the \r\nBrussels conference, have been providing us with \r\ncrucial assistance. This progress, which is still \r\ntentative, needs to be consolidated and expanded to \r\nother areas, such as access to drinking water, \r\nsanitation, protection of the environment and \r\nadaptation to climate change. We therefore firmly hope \r\nthat the values of international solidarity and justice, \r\nwithout which the United Nations will never be able to \r\nmeet the many challenges of our time, will prevail at \r\nthis session. \r\n The Acting Chair (spoke in Spanish): I now give \r\nthe floor to His Excellency Mr. Gervais Rufyikiri, \r\nSecond Vice-President of the Republic of Burundi.  \r\nA/65/PV.4  \r\n \r\n10-54115 36 \r\n \r\n Mr. Rufyikiri (Burundi) (spoke in French): The \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs) in Burundi is possible for some targets, but for \r\nothers there is a long road to travel. In order to better \r\nunderstand the progress that has been made and the \r\ndifficulties encountered, I would like to briefly explain \r\nthe sociopolitical conditions that have had a deciding \r\ninfluence on the pace of social and economic \r\ndevelopment in Burundi.  \r\n Burundi is a country in a post-conflict situation. \r\nStarting in 1993 and over the course of a decade, it has \r\nexperienced a serious sociopolitical crisis. Of course, \r\nthat has had a negative impact on development \r\nprogrammes and on the implementation of the MDGs \r\nin particular. However, I would point out that Burundi \r\nhas just reached an historic stage, and I would like to \r\nexpress my satisfaction and that of my Government at \r\nthe fact that the international community and Burundi’s \r\npartners have recognized that there has been progress \r\nin the areas of security, development and democracy.  \r\n In 2005, democratic elections were organized, \r\nputting an end to the period of civil war. The \r\nGovernment that arose from those elections, as soon as \r\nit assumed power, began addressing the issue of the \r\nMDGs and undertook significant efforts to achieve \r\nthem, despite the time lost due to the war.  \r\n As the first five-year mandate has now come to \r\nan end, general elections have just been carried out \r\nsuccessfully, from May to September 2010, in a spirit \r\nof transparency and fairness. The international \r\ncommunity and civil society in Burundi, acting through \r\ntheir observers, have witnessed the determination of \r\nthe people of Burundi to consolidate their \r\nachievements in the areas of peace, democracy and \r\nreconciliation.  \r\n Although Burundi has only just emerged from a \r\nconflict that lasted several years, the Government that \r\nhas led the country over the past five years has spared \r\nno effort to achieve the MDGs on time. The \r\ndetermination and the commitment of President Pierre \r\nNkurunziza and the successes achieved in this area by \r\nBurundi have been welcomed by Burundians and the \r\ninternational community.  \r\n The situation in Burundi with regard to progress \r\nmade in achieving the MDGs shows that some target \r\nareas have seen improvement as a result of the \r\nproactive policies adopted by the Government that took \r\npower following the 2005 elections.  \r\n For example, on MDG 2, Burundi is set to \r\nachieve this Goal, thanks to the measures taken by the \r\nGovernment since 2005 to provide free primary \r\neducation. In particular, we are happy to see that the \r\nnet percentage of children in school has gone from \r\n53 per cent in 1990 to 90 per cent in 2009.  \r\n On MDG 3, Burundi has made significant \r\nprogress in eliminating gender inequalities in primary \r\nas well as secondary education. The objective of \r\ngender parity should, normally speaking, by achieved \r\nby 2015, given that the ratio of girls to boys was \r\nestimated in 2009 to be 0.87 for primary education and \r\n0.72 for secondary education. As to representation in \r\ninstitutions, women currently represent 32 per cent in \r\nthe national assembly, compared to 12 per cent in \r\n1993. I would also point out that women currently \r\naccount for 44 per cent of the senate and 42 per cent in \r\nthe Government. \r\n MDG 6, target 2, concerning the prevalence of \r\nmalaria and tuberculosis, should be achieved by 2015. \r\nOf course, that will involve a lot of effort. A positive \r\ndevelopment in this area is the significant reduction in \r\nthe prevalence of malaria and the number of deaths due \r\nto this illness. This is due in part to the high number of \r\nmosquito nets distributed in 2006.  \r\n On MDG 7, it is very probable that Burundi will \r\nachieve target 2, since significant progress has been \r\nmade with regard to access to clean drinking water, \r\nwhich has increased from 47 per cent in 2000 to 64 per \r\ncent in 2005.  \r\n On MDG 8, Burundi has made significant \r\nprogress, in particular with regard to strengthening \r\ndialogue with its partners and national ownership of its \r\ndevelopment policy, which enabled my country to \r\nreach, in January 2009, the completion point of the \r\nHeavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative and \r\nwitness a progressive increase in the flow of official \r\ndevelopment aid since the 2005 establishment of \r\ndemocratic institutions. \r\n Mr. Deiss (Co-Chair) returned to the Chair. \r\n Burundi is also proud of the progress made with \r\nregard to MDGs 4 and 5, thanks to the presidential \r\ninitiative in 2005 to provide free health care to children \r\nunder five years of age, pregnant women and women in \r\nlabour. This has brought about a fivefold increase in \r\nthe proportion of births attended by health-care \r\npersonnel between 1990 and 2008. \r\n A/65/PV.4\r\n \r\n37 10-54115 \r\n \r\n Significant progress has been made with regard to \r\nthe abovementioned MDG targets, and we do hope to \r\nreach them by 2015. But that is not the case with \r\nothers, in particular the elimination of extreme poverty \r\nand hunger, the reduction of the spread of HIV/AIDS, \r\naccess to sanitation and safe housing, the preservation \r\nof biodiversity of forest zones, the mobilization of \r\nofficial development assistance that is compatible with \r\nthe achievement of the MDGs, and access to markets \r\nand to new information and communications \r\ntechnology.  \r\n Therefore, sufficient resources must be provided \r\nfor us to reach these Goals and targets, the majority of \r\nwhich we are in the process of achieving, and to \r\novercome the challenges. The Government elected this \r\nyear is more determined than ever to make significant \r\nprogress on achieving the MDGs. Among the strategies \r\nplanned is the commitment of the Government to lay \r\nout the guidelines for successive strategic frameworks \r\nfor growth and for the fight against poverty, beginning \r\nwith the second generation of those policies in 2011.  \r\n We urgently call on the international community, \r\nand in particular our partners, to take into account the \r\nneeds of the people of Burundi, who are so eager to \r\nreap the dividends of peace and reconciliation. \r\nBurundians are very much aware of how great these \r\nchallenges are, and they want more than ever to \r\ncontinue to benefit from the many different forms of \r\npolitical and financial support from the international \r\ncommunity. The international community has thus far \r\nshown enormous willingness to help Burundians, and \r\nwe welcome that. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): I \r\nnow give the floor to His Excellency Mr. George \r\nRebelo Chicoti, Secretary of State for External \r\nRelations of the Republic of Angola. \r\n Mr. Chicoti (Angola) (spoke in Portuguese; \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): At the outset, \r\nI would like to welcome the holding of this important \r\nevent, which offers us a unique opportunity once again \r\nto discuss frankly the state of implementation of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals and to launch new \r\nideas to help realize in a more effective manner the \r\ncommitments we have assumed. My delegation \r\nassociates itself with the statement delivered by the \r\nrepresentative of Yemen on behalf of the Group of 77 \r\nand China. \r\n In his report entitled “Keeping the promise: a \r\nforward-looking review to promote an agreed action \r\nagenda to achieve the Millennium Development Goals \r\nby 2015” (A/64/665), the Secretary-General stressed \r\nthat several countries have obtained very positive \r\nresults in the fight against extreme poverty, have \r\nimproved their levels of school attendance, children’s \r\nhealth and access to potable water and HIV/AIDS \r\ntreatment and have made strides in the fight against \r\nmalaria, tuberculosis and tropical diseases. \r\n Nevertheless, 10 years after the adoption of the \r\nMillennium Declaration (resolution 55/2), attainment \r\nof the Millennium Development Goals themselves is \r\nstill far from being a reality. The fight against poverty \r\ncannot be won only with the holding of conferences \r\nand summits to negotiate more commitments to \r\ndevelopment. Overcoming hunger and poverty \r\nprimarily requires that we implement the international \r\ncommitments we have already made, for otherwise we \r\nwould be locking ourselves into an unproductive and \r\nrepetitive cycle. \r\n The international community must ensure that \r\nthese commitments are translated into concrete actions. \r\nNational policies should be supplemented and \r\nsupported by international efforts aimed at creating an \r\noverall environment that is conducive to their \r\nimplementation. Therefore, while we defend the \r\nprinciple of national responsibility, we urge the \r\nstrengthening of regional and global partnerships for \r\ndevelopment. Eradicating extreme poverty continues to \r\nbe a big challenge of our time and represents a major \r\nconcern for the international community. Hence, it \r\nrequires that Governments, civil society and the private \r\nsector join forces as part of a closer and more effective \r\npartnership for development. \r\n Eliminating hunger and poverty, improving the \r\nprovision of public services such as health care and \r\neducation, reducing child mortality, respecting the \r\nenvironment, building adequate infrastructure, \r\neliminating social exclusion in all its forms and \r\nachieving gender equality are ambitious but attainable \r\ngoals. Accordingly, it remains important to include the \r\nMillennium Development Goals in national strategies \r\nfor poverty reduction and in national development \r\nplans. \r\n We attach great importance to this meeting, \r\nbecause we believe that all is not lost. We must act \r\nswiftly and wisely in order to ensure that from this year \r\nA/65/PV.4  \r\n \r\n10-54115 38 \r\n \r\nforward there will be a better dynamic capable of \r\ncontributing to the achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and other internationally agreed \r\ncommitments. \r\n I would like to draw attention to a number \r\ninternational mechanisms already agreed upon, which \r\nhave been applied inconsistently or simply ignored. \r\n First, increasing official development assistance \r\nwould boost economic and social sectors that are \r\nfacing difficulties, leading to improved living \r\nconditions for people. In short, it would create greater \r\nsocial welfare. \r\n Secondly, reform of the international financial \r\narchitecture is now a pressing need, since it is evident \r\nthat the world needs an international financial system \r\nthat is more agile, more dynamic and responsive to the \r\nneeds of developing economies. Also in this \r\nframework, international financial institutions should \r\nplay a greater role. \r\n Thirdly, deregulating international trade, \r\nespecially reducing farm subsidies and eliminating \r\ntrade barriers for agricultural products from developing \r\ncountries, would boost free competition in international \r\nmarkets and would strengthen the agricultural sectors \r\nof developing countries. \r\n Fourthly, increasing investments in agriculture in \r\nAfrica in the context of the Comprehensive Africa \r\nAgriculture Development Programme must not only be \r\nencouraged, but also supplemented with the \r\nconstruction of roads that are necessary to transport \r\ngoods from farms to cities as well as to stimulate the \r\nindustrial sector. \r\n Fifthly, the creation of an integrated microcredit \r\nprogramme for small and medium-sized farms and \r\nother small producers has proved in many countries to \r\nbe an effective means of combating poverty. \r\n And finally, the global partnership for \r\ndevelopment, as called for in Goal 8, and the \r\nbroadening of international cooperation are vital to \r\nachieving the other Goals. \r\n Collectively and individually, all countries that \r\nare combining the efforts of their public and private \r\nsectors should feel obliged to fight tenaciously to \r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals, especially \r\nin African countries where the situation is particularly \r\ndifficult. We are convinced that Africa has potential \r\nand that, once it is supported by the international \r\ncommunity, it will be able to overcome challenges in \r\norder to make possible the economic growth and \r\nsustainable development of the continent. \r\n The right to development, along with other rights, \r\nis enshrined in the United Nations Charter, and we \r\nbelieve that the Millennium Declaration is a vehicle for \r\nthe realization of this principle, for its vision and \r\nprovisions remain pertinent. \r\n Shortly after the war ended in 2002, Angola \r\nstarted a broad national reconstruction and poverty \r\nreduction programme. However, the international \r\neconomic and financial crisis and the adverse effects of \r\nclimate change have seriously affected the economic \r\nperformance of most developing countries, and they \r\nhave not spared the gigantic efforts that Angola had \r\npreviously begun. Nevertheless, Angola has seen \r\nimprovements in all basic MDG indicators. More than \r\n2 million children have been enrolled in primary \r\neducation since 2002. The percentage of children \r\nattending school has risen substantially, by 76 per cent. \r\nChild survival has increased by 20 per cent, and the \r\npercentage of children suffering from malaria has \r\ndropped by 23 per cent. \r\n With respect to health sector commitments, we \r\nhope to reduce the transmission rates of major \r\ninfectious diseases including AIDS, malaria and \r\ntuberculosis by 2015 and to drastically reduce \r\nmortality of children and women. Figures are \r\nbeginning to be encouraging as a result of strong \r\ninvestments in infrastructure, especially hospitals. \r\nBetween 2000 and 2006, more than 250 hospitals were \r\nbuilt throughout the country, resulting in a reduction of \r\nmaternal and infant mortality rates from 1,400 per \r\n100,000 live births in 2001 to 660 per 100,000 live \r\nbirths in 2008. Moreover, in order to eradicate hunger \r\nand poverty, Angola has adopted a national strategy for \r\nfood security for the period 2009-2014, which will \r\nenable us to increase agricultural production in a \r\nsustainable manner. \r\n Fighting hunger and poverty seems to my country \r\nto be a central pillar of harmonious and sustainable \r\ndevelopment. It enables us to ensure respect for human \r\nrights while at the same time providing adequate living \r\nconditions for all citizens. The Republic of Angola \r\nhereby expresses its strong commitment to the \r\nimplementation of the Millennium Declaration through \r\nmechanisms that include the building of human and \r\n A/65/PV.4\r\n \r\n39 10-54115 \r\n \r\ninstitutional capacities, good governance, gender \r\nequality and the continuous improvement of the \r\nsocio-economic conditions of the people. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): \r\nThe Assembly will now hear an address by His \r\nExcellency Mr. George A. Papandreou, Prime Minister \r\nof the Hellenic Republic.  \r\n Mr. Papandreou (Greece): Ten years ago, the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) expressed a \r\nrealization: the realization that we are all in this \r\ntogether. Whatever the problem, wherever it hits, \r\nsooner or later it will affect us all. In our \r\ninterdependent world, there is no problem that can be \r\ndealt with in isolation and no country that is immune to \r\njob losses, environmental disasters, pandemics or the \r\nwhims of the financial markets. We know this well in \r\nEurope, and our Union has created a stronger potential \r\nto deal effectively with many of these challenges. \r\n In Greece, our recent experience has given us real \r\ninsight into how one small country’s problems can \r\nricochet around the world. The Greek people have \r\ntaken unprecedented steps to overcome our fiscal \r\ncrisis. It is a painful process, but we are making real \r\nprogress and delivering on our commitments, and we \r\nwill emerge stronger — with one prerequisite: we \r\ndecided to change. Greece is not a poor country. But \r\ndid we manage our resources, our environment, our \r\nhuman capacity prudently, transparently, equitably, \r\nsustainably? No, we did not. And that is what we are \r\nchallenged to change. \r\n But is that not also the core challenge of our \r\nMillennium Development Goals: to manage our \r\nplanetary resources, our human capacity, our amassed \r\ncapital, our amazing technological advances, our \r\ncommonwealth of knowledge in a much more \r\nresponsible way; to manage our resources in a way that \r\nrespects our natural resources, respects the rights and \r\nneeds of all our people and respects the well-being of \r\nfuture generations?  \r\n In Greece, we are dealing with more than simply \r\na sovereign debt crisis. The world is not dealing simply \r\nwith a financial crisis. We in Greece — and all of us — \r\nface fundamental challenges: to revitalize our \r\ndemocracies and ensure good governance, to redefine \r\nwhat we mean by quality of life, to change our \r\nconsumption patterns in order to stimulate clean, green \r\ngrowth around the world, and to do so in an equitable \r\nmanner. \r\n This is why in Greece we have launched radical \r\nreforms to make our Government more transparent, our \r\ninstitutions more efficient, our economy more \r\ncompetitive and green, and our society more just. We \r\nare delivering these changes with our citizens and not \r\nin spite of them. \r\n But we are also more aware than ever before of \r\nthe need to work together to change our world for the \r\nbetter. Environmental disaster and climate change are \r\nwiping out positive gains made in the economies of so \r\nmany countries and are putting new burdens on the \r\npoor. And this affects us all. There is the example of \r\nwomen. If women are illiterate in parts of the world, \r\nthey will suffer more violence, they will be unable to \r\nplan their families and they will be less likely to \r\ncontain pandemics such as HIV/AIDS or malaria. They \r\nwill bring up children who are more desperate, more \r\nmarginal, more violent. And this, in the end, affects us \r\nall. So even though Greece is facing daunting \r\nchallenges in its economy, we plan to contribute \r\ndevelopment aid in areas such as green growth, health, \r\nhunger, poverty alleviation, women’s rights and \r\nfreedom from violence. \r\n I would like to take the opportunity to \r\ncongratulate the Secretary-General on the appointment \r\nof Michelle Bachelet to the United Nations Entity for \r\nGender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN \r\nWomen). But we need to transcend our national \r\nboundaries and work together for another reason. \r\nAround the world, many of our citizens — I would say, \r\nparticularly our youth — feel disempowered. They \r\nknow that we have the resources to make poverty \r\nhistory, to wipe out illiteracy, to prevent pandemics, to \r\nprotect women and children and to protect biodiversity. \r\nBut they also know that we are not managing our \r\nresources and capabilities to do so effectively. That is \r\nwhy our citizens question our political will to move \r\nforward as a global community. They expect — and \r\nrightly so — political leaders to do more to correct the \r\nimbalances and inequities that the current system of \r\nglobal governance has created. \r\n Underlying our failure to act on our good \r\nintentions is a crisis in governance — democratic \r\ngovernance, global democratic governance. Our \r\nnational institutions lack the capability to deal with \r\nglobal issues. At the same time, the concentration of \r\npower, capital and media has enabled privileged elites \r\nwith vested interests to capture our democratic \r\nprocesses. \r\nA/65/PV.4  \r\n \r\n10-54115 40 \r\n \r\n So we must step up to the challenge to strengthen \r\nour local and global democratic institutions with \r\ngreater urgency and resolve. We must prove that our \r\ndemocracies can protect and empower our citizens and \r\nequalize opportunities, and that the benefits of \r\nglobalization can be fairly and evenly distributed. We \r\nneed to create new tools that will optimize the use of \r\nour resources, change financial incentives and \r\nredistribute wealth. A financial transaction tax, a \r\ncarbon tax or green bonds could be used to fund \r\neducation, health care, green infrastructure and \r\ntechnology, particularly in developing countries. \r\n Instead of national austerity, we ought to be \r\nthinking in terms of global responsibility. Yes, we need \r\nto manage sovereign debt, but we also need to plan for \r\nsocial protection, decent jobs and green growth. Unless \r\nwe join forces to face the challenges ahead, we will all \r\nremain vulnerable to new crises. Either we provide \r\ndirection, vision and action for a sustainable world \r\nsociety, or we will be subject to more conflict, poverty \r\nand suffering. \r\n The Millennium Development Goals have \r\nchallenged us to develop global governance that will \r\nempower our citizens in order to transform the world \r\nof free markets into a world of free people. We will \r\neither have politics of solidarity, or we will have \r\npolitics of fear, xenophobia and scapegoats. Either we \r\nhumanize globalization or globalization itself will \r\nundermine humanity. The choice is clear, and it is time \r\nto act. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): I \r\nnow give the floor to Her Excellency Ms. Reem \r\nIbrahim Al Hashimi, Minister of State of the United \r\nArab Emirates. \r\n Ms. Al Hashimi (United Arab Emirates) (spoke \r\nin Arabic): The United Arab Emirates supports the \r\nMillennium Declaration (resolution 55/2) out of its \r\nconviction that the implementation of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) is a main factor for the \r\nmaintenance of peace and security and the realization \r\nof prosperity throughout the world. Today, we renew \r\nour support for the Declaration and affirm our intention \r\nto continue working to achieve the Goals by the year \r\n2015, as we have pledged.  \r\n The recent prevailing international economic, \r\npolitical and security conditions have demonstrated \r\nhow the interests and concerns of the countries of the \r\nworld are interlinked. The economic crisis and its \r\naftermath proved that no country is safe from its \r\nimpact regardless of its isolation or local economic \r\nconditions. The United Arab Emirates strongly believes \r\nthat success in achieving the MDGs requires an \r\neffective and solid global partnership within the \r\nframework of the agreed recommendations of the \r\nMillennium Declaration and other development \r\nconferences and forums. \r\n While we recognize that the global economic and \r\nfinancial crisis led to recessions in developed donor \r\ncountries, we urge those countries not to withdraw \r\ntheir commitments and to keep working towards \r\nearmarking 0.7 per cent of their gross national income \r\nfor official development assistance (ODA) to \r\ndeveloping countries. We also urge them to take \r\neffective steps to alleviate or cancel the debts of \r\ndeveloping countries and to provide them with new \r\ntechnology to help them build environments conducive \r\nto sustainable development. \r\n In this context, we emphasize the importance of \r\nreforming the international economic, financial and \r\ntrade systems so as to allow developing countries the \r\nopportunity to play an active role and to participate in \r\nthe international market in a just and equitable manner. \r\nAt the same time, we urge developing countries to \r\nadopt economic policies that encourage production and \r\nhelp attract foreign investment. \r\n The United Arab Emirates strove successfully to \r\ncontain the aftermath of the global economic and \r\nfinancial crisis and its impact on our development \r\nachievements so we could honour our commitments \r\nand maintain our foreign aid contributions for \r\ndevelopment. Our success in achieving the MDGs at \r\nthe national level has allowed us to enhance our \r\ncontributions to the global partnership to assist \r\ndeveloping countries in achieving their development \r\ngoals as quickly as possible. \r\n We have exploited our oil revenues to expand and \r\ndiversify sources of national income while, at the same \r\ntime, maintaining a focus on human development in all \r\nfields. In a short period of time, we were able to \r\neradicate poverty, raise the average income per capita, \r\nprovide free universal education at all levels, and \r\nachieve gender equality and women’s empowerment. \r\n At the same time, we are working to ensure the \r\nsustainability of the environment and the realization of \r\na comprehensive national strategy to integrate an \r\nenvironmental vision into all development activities, \r\n A/65/PV.4\r\n \r\n41 10-54115 \r\n \r\nwhile mitigating the effects of climate change and \r\nreducing emissions.  \r\n The United Arab Emirates has adopted a foreign \r\npolicy focused on cooperation and bilateral and \r\ninternational partnerships to achieve development in \r\nother countries. The Emirates is one of the major \r\ndonors in the international partnership for \r\ndevelopment. A number of national institutions make \r\nforeign development contributions that constitute a \r\nhigh percentage of our gross national product and are \r\ndistributed as ODA to approximately 100 developing \r\ncountries around the world. Ninety-five per cent of that \r\nassistance is given as grants, while the rest is \r\ndistributed as concessionary loans. About 80 per cent \r\nof these contributions are directed to major \r\ndevelopment projects in education, health, \r\ninfrastructure and energy in those countries. \r\n For instance, the Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan \r\nFoundation, founded in 2007 by our Head of State, His \r\nHighness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, \r\nprovides relief and development assistance to \r\ndeveloping countries and those affected by natural \r\ndisasters and armed conflicts. It also finances \r\ndevelopment projects, including health and social \r\ncentres, in more than 35 countries in Asia, Africa and \r\nEurope.  \r\n The Dubai Care Initiative founded by His \r\nHighness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashed Al Maktoum, \r\nVice-President and Prime Minister of the United Arab \r\nEmirates and Ruler of Dubai, works to provide primary \r\neducation for 4 million children in 14 developing \r\ncountries to fight poverty, empower citizens, and \r\nachieve development within the framework of \r\nMDG 2.A, on universal primary education. \r\n The United Arab Emirates plays an effective role \r\nin strengthening international assistance, be it in \r\nemergency or long-term cases such as natural disasters \r\nand armed conflicts. In 2009, the United Arab Emirates \r\ndonated approximately $3 billion in humanitarian and \r\ndevelopment assistance, with a special focus on the \r\ncountries most affected by natural disasters and armed \r\nconflicts. \r\n In conclusion, the United Arab Emirates reaffirms \r\nits commitment to continuing to work to realize the \r\nMDGs and to strengthen the international partnership \r\nto implement them by 2015. In this regard, we call for \r\nthe intensification of international efforts to address the \r\nroot causes and challenges that hinder the timely \r\nachievement of the MDGs, and to find effective and \r\npermanent solutions for them all. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): I \r\nnow give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Kamel \r\nMorjane, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Tunisia. \r\n Mr. Morjane (Tunisia) (spoke in Arabic): Let me \r\nsay how pleased I am to take part in this High-level \r\nPlenary Meeting to assess progress in achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) and identify \r\nthe means to attain them on schedule.  \r\n It is widely agreed that development is a \r\nfundamental aspiration of all countries. Guided by our \r\nstrong commitment, we adopted the Millennium \r\nDeclaration, which reflects the aspirations of the \r\npeoples of the world to a better life through the \r\nrealization of a carefully selected series of objectives \r\ndefined by numerical benchmarks and clear \r\ntimeframes. We have agreed to halve the rate of \r\npoverty, promote primary education at the global level, \r\nenhance gender equality, reduce mortality among \r\nchildren and mothers, fight AIDS, ensure sustainable \r\ndevelopment, preserve the environment and build a \r\nglobal partnership for development. \r\n Although many countries have managed over the \r\npast decade to achieve significant progress towards \r\nattaining some of the Millennium Goals, we note that \r\nthe pace of this progress is still slow and has not met \r\nglobal expectations, due to the huge development \r\nchallenges that most countries, particularly those of \r\nAfrica, are facing. Many relevant reports have pointed \r\nto the slowdown of progress due to the acute world \r\neconomic crisis. \r\n Economic projections for African countries that \r\nregister a growth rate below 3 per cent anticipate an \r\nannual growth rate below the required 7 per cent, \r\nwhich is too low to help them realize the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals within the fixed timeframe. The \r\nachievement of the development goals in our African \r\ncontinent will require financing the economy, investing \r\nin the health and education systems, and additional \r\nefforts to fight poverty and ensure early education, \r\nlaying the foundations of a dignified life for African \r\ncitizens. \r\n We are convinced that the establishment of a \r\ngenuine partnership with Africa represents the most \r\nsuitable way to advance development in the continent, \r\nhelp achieve our development goals and bring hope to \r\nA/65/PV.4  \r\n \r\n10-54115 42 \r\n \r\nmillions of Africans. In this regard, we call on the \r\nGroup of Eight and the Group of 20 to renew their \r\ncommitment to the African continent so as to enable it \r\nto attain its development goals. We are also of the view \r\nthat the support extended through North-South \r\ncooperation in the endeavour to meet development \r\ngoals will never outweigh the scope and importance of \r\nSouth-South cooperation in promoting economic and \r\nsocial development in Africa. \r\n Attaining the Millennium Development Goals on \r\nschedule will require us all to work in solidarity and to \r\npool our sustained efforts. In this spirit, allow me to \r\nhighlight the success of the Tunisian national solidarity \r\nexperience in promoting development in poor areas. \r\nOur experience demonstrates the utility and \r\neffectiveness of this policy, which earned international \r\nrecognition through the adoption of resolution 57/265 \r\nendorsing the establishment of the World Solidarity \r\nFund, designed to help poor countries advance their \r\nachievement of the MDGs. \r\n Although my country, Tunisia, is a medium-\r\nincome country with limited natural resources, it has \r\nmanaged through self-reliance to achieve significant \r\neconomic development over the past two decades, \r\nenabling it to enjoy a high ranking in human \r\ndevelopment indicators. \r\n Our national report on the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, prepared jointly by the United \r\nNations and the Tunisian Government, underscores the \r\nprogress achieved by Tunisia with regard to sustainable \r\ndevelopment. This report stresses that the increase in \r\ngross domestic product reached 5 per cent in recent \r\nyears. Owing to the fair distribution of economic \r\ngrowth income, the poverty rate witnessed a sharp \r\ndecline from 60 per cent in 1960 to 7 per cent in the \r\nmid-1990s, and to 3.8 per cent at the current time. \r\nMore important, the report underlines the tremendous \r\nprogress achieved by Tunisia in meeting the remaining \r\nMillennium Development Goals. The report stresses \r\nthat my country will succeed in attaining these goals, if \r\nnot exceeding most, by the year 2015. \r\n Tunisia has pursued sound development policies \r\nbased mainly on reconciling the requirements of an \r\nefficient economy and dynamic social policies to \r\nensure the fundamentals of a decent life. This \r\ncomprehensive development vision arises from the \r\nfirm belief that there is an inextricable link and \r\ninterdependence among all dimensions of development, \r\nand that there is no progress in the absence of \r\neconomic prosperity. Moreover, there can be no \r\nsustainable economy in the absence of social peace and \r\nnational concord. Indeed, comprehensive development \r\nconsecrates social justice and ensures the fair \r\ndistribution of growth dividends in all areas and to all \r\nsectors of the population, while preserving and \r\nenhancing social assets and gains. It also helps to \r\nimprove the living conditions of vulnerable sectors of \r\nthe population with specific needs and to enhance \r\nsolidarity among various national components. \r\n Thanks to this sound policy, and despite the \r\nturbulent international economic climate, our country \r\nhas managed in the aftermath of the unprecedented \r\nfinancial and economic crisis to secure various \r\nachievements and progress in all sectors, and \r\nsucceeded in minimizing the impact of the volatility of \r\nworld markets on the national economy by taking \r\ntimely and appropriate measures to safeguard the \r\ndevelopment process, which continues apace to achieve \r\npositive results. Tunisia has also achieved tremendous \r\nprogress in schooling at all levels and a significant \r\nimprovement in health and demographic indicators, \r\nincluding medical coverage, life expectancy at birth \r\nand the extension of social security. \r\n Among Tunisia’s various achievements, income \r\nhas continued to rise, the poverty rate has witnessed a \r\nsharp decrease and job creation has continued to grow, \r\nthus improving living conditions in different areas, \r\nespecially in rural ones, where genuine progress in \r\nterms of access to electricity and drinking water is \r\nnoticeable. \r\n The world of 2015 will be what we make of it. It \r\nwill be a pure reflection of our common success or \r\ncommon failure to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and afford the means to ensure a \r\ndecent life free of need and anxiety about the future for \r\nall people. In conclusion, I would like to express my \r\nbest wishes for the success of our summit and to thank \r\nall participants for listening. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): I \r\nnow give the floor to His Excellency Mr. R. M. Marty \r\nM. Natalegawa, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the \r\nRepulic of Indonesia. \r\n Mr. Natalegawa (Indonesia): This High-level \r\nPlenary Meeting on the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs) is timely, considering the fast-\r\napproaching 2015 target date. The urgency of this \r\n A/65/PV.4\r\n \r\n43 10-54115 \r\n \r\nMeeting is further accentuated by the turn of events in \r\nthe past years that have stalled efforts on the MDGs. \r\n As highlighted by the Secretary-General earlier, \r\nwhile some parts of the world are well advanced in \r\nmeeting the MDGs, overall implementation is lagging. \r\nWe must ensure that the multifaceted, multidimensional \r\nand interconnected challenges and crises that our world \r\nis facing do not derail our gains towards achieving the \r\nMDGs. This Meeting reminds us that we have to stay \r\nengaged. Indeed, we need to redouble our efforts. \r\nFailure is not an option. \r\n The adoption of the MDGs a decade ago was a \r\ngroundbreaking moment and certainly a major \r\nachievement for the United Nations. The Goals \r\ninspired a rebalancing of the security paradigm to \r\nstrengthen development as a way of realizing freedom \r\nand peace. Since their adoption, the MDGs have been a \r\nbeacon for development policies, guiding development \r\nstrategies at all levels. Central to the successful \r\ntransformation envisioned 10 years ago are the \r\nmobilization of national, regional and international \r\nefforts. Each has vital function to perform in a \r\nmutually reinforcing way.  \r\n First, at the national level, each respective \r\nGovernment needs to create policies and have the fiscal \r\nspace to accelerate and sustain progress. The MDG \r\ntargets also need to be included in our respective \r\nnational development agendas. However, and more \r\nimportantly, a mechanism to monitor progress needs to \r\nbe put in place. Not least, Governments should \r\nencourage all stakeholders — including the private \r\nsector and civil society — to take ownership of the \r\nGoals. \r\n For our part, Indonesia’s commitment to \r\nachieving all MDG targets is strong and unwavering. \r\nWe have embraced all eight MDGs. They are consistent \r\nwith the basic fabric of our national development \r\npolicies and strategies and are an important feature of \r\nIndonesia’s foreign policy. We have made significant \r\nstrides to improve water and sanitation, education and \r\nhealth. In support of the Global Strategy for Women’s \r\nand Children’s Health launched by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, we have also introduced a policy to provide \r\nfree birth care for all mothers. \r\n With regard to climate, we have been \r\nimplementing domestic programmes to reduce \r\nemissions by 26 per cent by 2020 and, with \r\ninternational assistance, to reduce them by 41 per cent. \r\nIntensifying actions to curb deforestation, enhance \r\nreforestation and promote renewable energy is key in \r\nthis regard. \r\n As to some aspects of the MDGs, we are an early \r\nachiever and we hope that further efforts will \r\ncontribute significantly to reducing the maternal \r\nmortality rate and halting and reversing the spread of \r\nHIV/AIDS.  \r\n Secondly, at the regional level, all regional \r\norganizations and initiatives can contribute to \r\nachieving the MDGs by promoting coordination and \r\ncooperation among countries, which should contribute \r\nto the attainment of the Goals by the countries of the \r\nregion. There should be a mechanism to further \r\nmonitor MDG targets. There should be a machinery to \r\naccelerate the closing of remaining gaps.  \r\n We realize that not all countries in our region \r\nhave fully achieved the MDGs. As part of our \r\nresponsibility to ensure success in achieving the MDGs \r\nin our region, Indonesia recently held in Jakarta the \r\nSpecial Ministerial Meeting for the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals Review in Asia and the Pacific: \r\nRun up to 2015. In that regard, I have the honour to \r\ntransmit to the Assembly the declaration of the Jakarta \r\nSpecial Ministerial Meeting on the MDGs as a concrete \r\ncontribution of the countries of Asia and the Pacific to \r\nthis High-level Meeting. \r\n The Ministers recognized that, while Asia and the \r\nPacific as a whole have made progress on some of the \r\nMDGs, there are still gaps between and within \r\ncountries. To address these gaps, the Ministers \r\nresolved, inter alia, to address the extreme poverty of \r\n900 million people residing in the Asia and Pacific \r\nregion. The countries of Asia and the Pacific region \r\nreaffirmed their determination to achieve their \r\ncommitments on social protection, financing and \r\nenvironmental sustainability, not only on the basis of \r\ntheir strong individual convictions, but more \r\nimportantly by engaging in honest partnership with all \r\nstakeholders. \r\n Thirdly, at the global level, genuine global \r\npartnership is imperative. The MDGs are a project for \r\nhumanity. They are not only for the North; they are \r\nalso not only for the South. They are for all \r\nhumankind. The commitments of our development \r\npartners should be fulfilled. Innovative mechanisms for \r\nmobilizing resources should be further explored. \r\nA/65/PV.4  \r\n \r\n10-54115 44 \r\n \r\nSouth-South cooperation and triangular cooperation \r\nshould be further strengthened.  \r\n Ultimately, our long-term objective is to have a \r\nprosperous, peaceful, safe and stable global society. \r\nAchievement of the MDGs by all is an important step \r\ntowards realizing these long-term objectives. However, \r\nmuch remains to be done now and post-2015. \r\nAchieving the MDGs by 2015 must not be our end \r\ngoal. Efforts to build on the MDGs must be continued \r\nbeyond 2015. To this end, we must strengthen our \r\nnational efforts and promote partnership at the global \r\nlevel in support of these efforts. \r\n Mr. Carrión-Mena (Ecuador), Vice-President of \r\nthe General Assembly, took the Chair. \r\n In closing, the promise of creating a global \r\nsociety that is prosperous, peaceful, safe and stable is \r\none that must be fulfilled. And today we have the \r\nopportunity to contribute to fulfilling it. We cannot let \r\nthe opportunity lapse. That objective requires all of us \r\nto work together as part of a global society, for the \r\nbenefit of our people, for the next generations and for \r\nthe sustainability of our planet. \r\n The Acting Chair (spoke in Spanish): I now give \r\nthe floor to Mr. Elmar Maharram oglu Mammadyarov, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of \r\nAzerbaijan. \r\n Mr. Mammadyarov (Azerbaijan): At the outset, I \r\nwould like to join previous speakers in expressing my \r\ndeep gratitude to the Secretary-General, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for this well-organized \r\nHigh-level Plenary Meeting. I am confident that this \r\nMeeting will be an important step forward in the \r\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs) by 2015. \r\n We welcome the report of the Secretary-General \r\nentitled “Keeping the promise: a forward-looking \r\nreview to promote an agreed action agenda to achieve \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals by 2015” \r\n(A/64/665), which reviews the successes, best practices \r\nand lessons learned, obstacles and gaps, and challenges \r\nand opportunities leading to concrete strategies for \r\naction in achieving the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. \r\n Despite the ongoing military occupation of about \r\n20 per cent of the territory of Azerbaijan by our \r\nneighbour, the Republic of Armenia, and the resulting \r\npresence of almost 1 million refugees and forcibly \r\ndisplaced persons in our country, the Government of \r\nAzerbaijan reiterates its strong commitment to fully \r\nand effectively implementing the MDGs by 2015. We \r\nhave completed the progress report on the \r\nimplementation of the MDGs in 2010. Let me now \r\nbriefly share Azerbaijan’s perspective on and \r\nexperience in working to achieve the MDGs. \r\n With respect to Goal 1, on reducing poverty and \r\nextreme poverty, Azerbaijan has demonstrated the \r\npolitical will and has implemented a number of \r\nconsecutive steps to eradicate poverty. Our political \r\nwill was clearly stated in the first State Programme for \r\nPoverty Reduction and Economic Development and is \r\nreflected in the new State Programme for Poverty \r\nReduction and Sustainable Development (2008-2015). \r\nThe main objectives of the latter Programme include, \r\ninter alia, ensuring sustainable economic development, \r\nsignificantly decreasing the number of poor, protecting \r\nvulnerable groups, improving the living conditions of \r\nrefugees and internally displaced persons, improving \r\nand providing equal access for all to health and \r\neducation services, ensuring sustainable management \r\nof the environment, supporting gender equality and so \r\nforth. To this end, through the successful \r\nimplementation of the Programmes we have managed \r\nto reduce the poverty rate from 29.3 per cent in 2005 to \r\n11 per cent in 2010. \r\n We also give high priority to eliminating \r\nunemployment. In this regard, the Government has \r\nlaunched a special State programme for the \r\nimplementation of the employment strategy, reducing \r\nthe unemployment rate from 7.06 per cent in 2005 to \r\n6 per cent in 2009. \r\n Regarding Goal 2, on achieving universal \r\nprimary education, the relevant reforms for improving \r\nthe quality of school education have been launched. \r\nOur education reform strategy for the period 2003-\r\n2013, supported by the World Bank, is focused mainly \r\non reforming general compulsory education. Within \r\nthis framework, we have adopted a new programme for \r\npreschool education. We declared 2009 the Year of \r\nChildren in Azerbaijan to coincide with the twentieth \r\nanniversary of adoption of the Convention on the \r\nRights of the Child. The relevant action plan was \r\nadopted to address the special needs of disadvantaged \r\nand vulnerable children, with particular emphasis on \r\nefforts aimed at promoting children’s rights and \r\nencouraging their talents. \r\n A/65/PV.4\r\n \r\n45 10-54115 \r\n \r\n Regarding Goal 3, on gender equality and \r\nwomen’s empowerment, a coordinated set of \r\nmeasures — such as the adoption and implementation \r\nof a national action plan on women’s affairs, a \r\npresidential decree on a policy for the self-realization \r\nof women, the establishment of a State committee for \r\nfamily, women’s and children’s affairs, and many \r\nothers — have laid a firm legal and institutional \r\nfoundation for the achievement of gender equality, the \r\nprovision of secondary and higher education for \r\nwomen, equality in salaries, and the broad involvement \r\nof women in the decision-making process. There have \r\nbeen increases in women’s representation in Parliament \r\nand Government bodies. \r\n Regarding Goals 4 and 5, on child and maternal \r\nmortality, sustainable progress in this area will depend \r\non poverty reduction and further improvements in \r\naccess to and quality of health services through \r\nprimary health care reform. Azerbaijan is committed to \r\nreducing child and maternal mortality by half by 2015 \r\nand has taken coordinated steps to that end. With the \r\nadoption of State programmes for protecting the health \r\nof mothers and children, a national strategy on \r\nreproductive health, and a State programme for \r\nregional social and economic development for 2004-\r\n2008, our child mortality rate has fallen to 3.1 per cent \r\nin the past five years. \r\n Of all the MDGs, Goal 5 on improving maternal \r\nhealth, with its related targets — reducing maternal \r\nmortality rates by up to three-quarters by 2015 and \r\nachieving universal access to reproductive health \r\ncare — requires additional effort. In practice, the full \r\nrealization of this Goal demands financial resources \r\nand technical assistance that many developing \r\ncountries can hardly afford. \r\n Regarding Goal 6, on HIV/AIDs, malaria and \r\nother diseases, Azerbaijan has so far managed to \r\ncontain the spread of HIV/AIDS and malaria, and has \r\nsucceeded in improving the prevention and cure of \r\ntuberculosis. The national response to HIV/AIDS has \r\nalso been considerably strengthened in recent years, \r\nwith a major reorganization of the National AIDS \r\nCentre. \r\n Regarding Goal 7, on environmental sustainability, \r\nwe have to work on reversing the loss of our forested \r\nareas, and to ensure that environmental concerns are \r\ntaken into account at all levels of policymaking. We \r\nhave announced 2010 as the Year of Ecology and have \r\nadopted various special programmes in the area of \r\nenvironmental protection. \r\n Regarding Goal 8, on developing a global \r\npartnership for development, Azerbaijan is determined \r\nto contribute to the realization of the development \r\ngoals agreed within the United Nations, and is \r\nfostering global cooperation in all spheres, paying \r\nparticular attention to addressing the special needs and \r\nvulnerabilities of developing and least developed \r\ncountries. \r\n We have launched and successfully implemented \r\nseveral regional infrastructure projects that have made \r\na significant contribution to the development of certain \r\nneighbouring countries. Taking into consideration that \r\ninformation and communications technology is viewed \r\nas an important instrument for fostering economic \r\ngrowth and competitiveness and for contributing to \r\npoverty eradication and social inclusion, the \r\nGovernment of Azerbaijan has launched an initiative to \r\njointly build and manage a Trans-Eurasian information \r\nsuperhighway, which is expected to facilitate supplying \r\nthe countries of the region with Internet and \r\ntelecommunications systems, e-information resources \r\nand e-economies. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to express my hope \r\nthat this High-Level Plenary Meeting will contribute \r\nsignificantly to mobilizing the efforts of all Member \r\nStates in achieving the development agenda of the \r\nUnited Nations and creating a better future life for all \r\nof us. \r\n The Acting Chair (spoke in Spanish): I now give \r\nthe floor to His Excellency Mr. Ricardo Patiño Aroca, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, External Commerce and \r\nIntegration of Ecuador, who is, as it happens, my \r\nrespected compatriot. \r\n Mr. Patiño Aroca (Ecuador) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nThree years ago, the President of Ecuador asked us to \r\ndemand more of the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs), to go beyond poverty reduction and to bring \r\nabout social change capable of overcoming inequality. \r\nThen we would not need to speak of goals of human \r\nsubsistence, measurable by market consumption \r\nfigures, but rather of the joy of a dignified life for all \r\nour peoples. With that, we would move beyond social \r\nwell-being, not merely reducing the distances between \r\nhuman groups but also bridging enormous economic, \r\nterritorial, environmental and cultural chasms. We must \r\ngive renewed prominence to collective action, restore \r\nA/65/PV.4  \r\n \r\n10-54115 46 \r\n \r\nthe value of the public arena as the space in which the \r\nactors of our civil societies interact as a function of \r\ntheir collective interests, guaranteeing and ensuring \r\naccess to justice and to all their rights: the rights to \r\nwork, to recreation, to artistic creation and to life lived \r\nwell. \r\n That is also the path that could lead us to finding \r\npeace among our nations. I say this because my \r\ncountry is concerned that social issues are not given \r\nthe central importance they deserve when we consider \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). On the \r\ncontrary, what we have seen increase is one of the \r\npathological aspects of the policy of military spending. \r\nAs a global phenomenon, it now totals $1.531 trillion. \r\nThis represents an increase of 49 per cent since the \r\nstart of the millennium, and constitutes the greatest \r\nobstacle to our achievement of the MDGs. The \r\npersistence of hunger in the world contrasts most \r\nstrongly with this military spending globally, since the \r\nfirst Millennium Development Goal is that of reducing \r\nthe number of poor people in the world. \r\n It is clear that, so long as military spending is \r\ngrowing in most countries, investment in social \r\nspending will not be of prime importance to the \r\nGovernments of many of our societies. That is why my \r\ncountry would exhort everyone to demonstrate the \r\npolitical will to reverse the direction of such policies, \r\nso that we may come here not to present poverty \r\nreports but rather to report on how we have overcome \r\ninequities. If we cannot bring political earnest to \r\nsolving the problem defined as our first global goal — \r\neliminating hunger and extreme poverty — how can we \r\ntackle the other MDGs? \r\n As President Correa said three years ago, we \r\nbelieve that it is possible to act collectively, \r\nconsciously and democratically to take charge of our \r\nlives and organize world society in a different way, \r\nwith a more human face. If we fail to do so, we will \r\ncontinue to live in a world of war, with hundreds of \r\nmillions of hungry people, and with the threat of major \r\nhumanitarian catastrophes caused by climate change. \r\nThat is how we have understood things in Ecuador, and \r\nthat is why we can tell the whole world that we need to \r\nmove beyond the language traditionally used by States \r\nand Governments. How can we believe in countries \r\nthat seem to support and commit themselves to \r\npioneering initiatives such as the MDGs, and that in \r\nfact have not honoured or acted according to them? \r\n In Ecuador, we can cite statistics from the past \r\nthree years to show that we have improved the quality \r\nof life of our people. These statistics attest to the \r\nreduction of poverty during these years from 61 per \r\ncent to 53 per cent in rural areas as a result of a social \r\ninvestment of almost $1.5 billion, double that of the \r\nprevious seven years. Today, we allocate 8.3 per cent \r\nof GDP for these expenditures, compared with 2.8 per \r\ncent previously. We are on track in achieving our goals. \r\n With respect to equality in education, let me note \r\nthat we have doubled our investment in education and \r\nhave made it universal. We have taken action to \r\neliminate illiteracy and have implemented an \r\nintercultural policy by providing teaching materials in \r\nthe original languages of our indigenous peoples. \r\n In the health sphere too we have doubled public \r\ninvestment in recent years, and we have succeeded in \r\nreducing infant morality. It is our hope that we will \r\nachieve the figure of 11.8 deaths per 1,000 live births, \r\nwhich goes beyond the goal of reducing infant \r\nmortality by two thirds compared with 1990. We are \r\nmaking similar progress on maternal health and are \r\nbuilding infrastructure and providing services to \r\npreviously marginalized populations. \r\n There is a lot to say about sustainability of the \r\nenvironment. I would mention the Yasuní-ITT \r\ninitiative, policies for human mobility and the \r\npromotion of worldwide partnerships, through \r\nenhancing multilateralism and regional integration as \r\neffective strategies for making progress on social \r\ndevelopment. Yet we believe that little has been done \r\nto date. \r\n We do not wish merely to attain the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. We want to build societies marked \r\nby development and equity. That will be possible only \r\nif we rebuild the global structures of trade, finance, \r\ntechnological innovation and power structures in such \r\na way that they enable us to foster social development. \r\nThis requires unity among peoples and Governments \r\nwho will be determined to build — completely \r\nindependently — this new international economic and \r\npolitical order. Any other path will lead to failure. \r\n The Acting Chair (spoke in Spanish): I now give \r\nthe floor to His Excellency The Honourable Murray \r\nMcCully, Minister for Foreign Affairs of New Zealand. \r\n Mr. McCully (New Zealand): I welcome the \r\nopportunity to review progress towards the \r\n A/65/PV.4\r\n \r\n47 10-54115 \r\n \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs) and to identify steps we might take that will \r\nimprove progress.  \r\n I come from the South Pacific — a region that \r\naccording to recent reports sits second only to sub-\r\nSaharan Africa in terms of lack of progress towards \r\nachievement of some of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. New Zealand is a small nation of 4.5 million \r\npeople. We have limited resources. We cannot be major \r\nplayers in development assistance on a global scale. \r\nAnd so, we have decided increasingly to deploy our \r\nresources within our region, where they are most \r\nneeded and where we can make a difference.  \r\n Those resources are greatly needed within our \r\nregion. The effects of the global economic crisis have \r\nbeen severe even for the most robust of Pacific States. \r\nBudget support has been required by many. Other \r\nforms of supplementary assistance have also been \r\nrequired. But that is at the easy end of the spectrum. \r\n At the tougher end of the range we have places \r\nlike South Tarawa in Kiribati, with 50,000 people \r\ncrowded onto a narrow atoll with a population density \r\nsimilar to that of downtown Hong Kong, in poor \r\nhousing, frequently with highly polluted water, \r\nminimal sanitation and minimal solid waste disposal, \r\nand with all of the attendant health and humanitarian \r\nchallenges one would expect as a consequence. Given \r\nits position only a couple of metres above sea level, \r\nKiribati is better known in this forum for its climate \r\nchange challenges. But climate change is merely one of \r\nthe challenges confronted by the Government and the \r\npeople of Kiribati. This and other parts of the South \r\nPacific remain at the very lowest end of the register in \r\nrelation to some MDG outcomes. \r\n Some might observe that, given the population \r\nlevels in our region, we are dealing with small \r\nnumbers. These are problems that should lend \r\nthemselves to relatively easy solutions. But they have \r\nnot and they do not. Some will suggest that it is merely \r\na matter of more money being provided, of donors \r\nbeing asked to dig deeper. Despite the effects of the \r\nglobal economic crisis, most nations are digging \r\ndeeper. New Zealand is digging deeper. But more \r\nmoney alone will not solve these problems. We need a \r\nmuch greater focus on aid effectiveness. And we need \r\nto place a much higher premium on donor \r\ncoordination. \r\n On that latter point, New Zealand is a strong \r\nsupporter of the Cairns Compact on Strengthening \r\nDevelopment Coordination in the Pacific, a product of \r\nthe Pacific Forum, which we hope will lead to a \r\nsignificant lift in donor coordination in our region. \r\nAlready we have achieved a high level of coordination \r\nwith our friends and neighbours in Australia in relation \r\nto our shared work within the region. But we have a \r\nlong way to go to achieve better harmonization of \r\nefforts amongst donors generally. \r\n With regard to aid effectiveness, without in any \r\nway diminishing the health and humanitarian \r\nprogrammes that we continue to support, we have \r\ndecided to focus on sustainable economic development, \r\nin particular on the building blocks for sustainable \r\neconomic development in the region. Already we are \r\nsignificant funders of education within the South \r\nPacific. We want to do more of it and do it better, \r\nespecially on basic literacy and numeracy. We are \r\nsubstantially upgrading our efforts in horticulture, \r\nagriculture, fisheries and tourism. In each of these \r\nsectors, Pacific nations have considerable potential for \r\neconomic growth. We are trying to remove the barriers \r\nto trade, so that we can start to correct the major trade \r\nimbalances within the region. And we are giving \r\nserious attention to transport infrastructure, air and sea, \r\nfor these are the essential arteries for tourism and \r\ntrade. \r\n A major feature of all Pacific States is that their \r\neconomies suffer severely because of a dependence \r\nupon electricity generated from imported diesel, \r\nusually at a far greater cost than would be encountered \r\nelsewhere. We are trying to drive a major programme \r\nof investment in renewable energy infrastructure, \r\nespecially solar and wind. This is essential to achieve \r\nboth climate change and economic objectives. \r\n My final point is to echo the sentiment expressed \r\nby other speakers who have called for follow-up \r\nactions to match the fine words we have heard during \r\nthis meeting. I share the optimism of those who believe \r\nwe can make better, faster progress. But it will not be \r\nbecause we have established new committees or new \r\nprocedures, or developed new slogans or new \r\nacronyms. We need to get more practical: to focus on \r\noutcomes, not process. And we need more cooperation \r\nand less duplication. Those are the essential challenges \r\nwe now confront. \r\nA/65/PV.4  \r\n \r\n10-54115 48 \r\n \r\n The Acting Chair (spoke in Spanish): I now give \r\nthe floor to His Excellency Mr. Oldemiro Balói, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of \r\nMozambique. \r\n Mr. Balói (Mozambique): On behalf of the \r\npeople and the Government of the Republic of \r\nMozambique, and on my own behalf, I would like to \r\njoin previous speakers in congratulating the Co-Chairs \r\nof this important High-Level Plenary Meeting of the \r\nsixty-fifth session of the General Assembly. We are \r\nconfident that, under their enlightened and skillful \r\nguidance, our deliberations will be crowned with \r\nsuccess. \r\n Allow me to take this opportunity to reiterate the \r\nimportance of this gathering aimed at reviewing the \r\nprogress, obstacles, challenges and strategies in \r\nstrengthening our collective resolve and partnership for \r\nthe effective realization of the objectives of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). \r\n When Mozambique joined other nations 10 years \r\nago in adopting the Millennium Declaration, the \r\ncountry was aware of the challenges it would face in \r\nmeeting the Goals set therein. Indeed, since the first \r\nyears of its national independence, Mozambique has \r\nbeen engaged in the attainment of some of the Goals \r\nset, which are part of our national development \r\nprogrammes and strategies to fight poverty and \r\npromote economic growth. \r\n At this point in time when, only five years before \r\n2015, we would like to briefly share our evaluation and \r\nfundamentally point out our reflections regarding the \r\npath Mozambique is to take towards meeting the \r\nMDGs, as reflected in the 2010 edition of our national \r\nprogress report, which is available in this Hall. \r\n In this regard, allow me to focus this intervention \r\non MDGs 4 and 5, on reducing child mortality and \r\nimproving maternal health, as we believe that investing \r\nin women and children’s health constitutes an \r\nunequivocal way of investing in social and economic \r\ndevelopment while at the same time meeting the \r\nremaining Millennium Development Goals. \r\n Women and children’s health care indicators have \r\nshown some progress since the adoption of the MDGs \r\nthat is reflected in the reduction of maternal and infant \r\nmortality rates. It is obvious that these indicators show \r\nthe path that our country and our people have yet to \r\ntake in order to meet the objectives defined for our \r\nchildren’s and women’s health care. It is also obvious \r\nthat, for our Government, the issue of women’s and \r\nchildren’s health care goes beyond being simply \r\nMillennium Development Goals, as they constitute \r\npermanent development goals of our country and, \r\nabove all, represent the social justice to which all of \r\nour people aspire. \r\n Our Government’s main focus is to ensure that \r\nwomen in Mozambique give birth without the risk of \r\nfacing death, that each child born is able to grow and \r\nattain his or her full development, and that five years \r\nshould no longer be an unattainable age limit. The \r\ndesire to bear life should not represent a threat and \r\nsorrow for our women. Our experience during these \r\npast years has seen some actions of particular \r\nimportance and great impact in improving health care \r\nand reducing maternal and infant mortality rates. \r\nAmong these actions, we would like to highlight the \r\nfollowing. \r\n First, recognizing the impact of social factors in \r\ncommunity health, we favour the implementation of \r\njoint measures undertaken by various Government \r\nsectors aimed at increasing access to clean water and \r\nbasic sanitation, mainly at the rural community level. \r\n Second, we implement programmes that promote \r\nthe presence of girls at school. We would like to take \r\nthis opportunity to point out that, at this point in time, \r\nMozambique has almost reached parity between boys \r\nand girls at the primary school level. \r\n Third, since the first years of our independence, \r\nwomen and children have had free access to health \r\ncare. This free access has had a great impact on access \r\nto differentiated health care, such as caesarian \r\ndeliveries, for pregnant women, with a major impact on \r\nthe reduction of maternal mortality. \r\n Fourth, throughout the years we have established \r\na strong relationship between the Government and \r\nlocal communities. While guaranteeing families’ \r\ncapacity to adopt basic domestic measures that help in \r\ndealing with conditions that threaten children’s and \r\nwomen’s health, with a focus on the prevention of \r\nmortality due to malaria, respiratory infections and \r\nchildren’s diarrhoea, and in the identification of signs \r\nof danger to pregnant women. Today in Mozambique, \r\nwe have a network of community workers who \r\ngalvanize the communities in adopting domestic \r\npractices for the prevention of diseases as well as for \r\nthe protection of health, particularly that of children. \r\n A/65/PV.4\r\n \r\n49 10-54115 \r\n \r\n Fifth, recognizing the country’s limited number \r\nof doctors, at a very early stage Mozambique took the \r\ninitiative to train non-doctor, middle-level technicians \r\nto offer differentiated surgery care, including \r\ncaesarians for pregnant women with labour \r\ncomplications. \r\n Sixth, the need to increase access to and the use \r\nof health services by women, in particular during \r\npregnancy and labour, led us to invest in the expansion \r\nof the network of health facilities, particularly in the \r\nconstruction of maternity wards as close as possible to \r\ncommunities and, at the same time, to prioritize the \r\ntraining of maternal and infant nurses. It is worth \r\nmentioning here that the lack of human resources in \r\nMozambique constitutes a major challenge for our \r\nGovernment in meeting all of our goals. \r\n Seventh, as an example of success in community \r\nmobilization, we would like to mention the national \r\nmovement that was created through the implementation \r\nof a children’s and women’s presidential health care \r\ninitiative though which, after reflection and \r\nconsultative meetings at the national level, various \r\nsimilar meetings were held at the provincial and local \r\nlevels that contributed to a dramatic increase in the \r\nlevel of awareness of women’s and children’s health. In \r\nthe past couple of years, we have actively participated \r\nin advocacy actions at the global level through our \r\ninvolvement in the activities of the network of global \r\nleaders tackling Millennium Development Goals 4 \r\nand 6. \r\n Although progress has been made, the current \r\ninternational context poses a threat to this trend, as we \r\nhave witnessed in the negative impacts of climate \r\nchange, the food and fuel crisis and, more recently, the \r\nglobal economic and financial crisis. In this regard, and \r\nwith only five years to the target date for achieving the \r\nMDGs, it is now imperative that we all reinvigorate \r\nour engagement to implement the commitments made \r\nin Monterrey. We therefore hope that the draft outcome \r\ndocument of this High-Level Plenary Meeting will \r\nreflect that urgency. Indeed, we expect that the donor \r\ncommunity will ensure sufficient financial support to \r\ndeveloping countries. For our part, we would like to \r\nstress our firm commitment to implementing sound \r\nsocial and macroeconomic policies and good \r\ngovernance and, in the long term, reducing dependence \r\non external aid by increasing national revenue, making \r\nsustainable use of natural resources, improving the \r\ninvestment climate and promoting broad-based \r\neconomic growth. Once again, investing in women’s \r\nand children’s health is investing in the survival of a \r\nnation. We therefore recommit ourselves to continuing \r\nto place health care for women and children at the top \r\nof our development agenda. \r\n Let me conclude by saying that, by fulfilling \r\nthese and other relevant internationally agreed \r\ncommitments, we will be able to successfully address \r\nthe remaining challenges in attaining the social well-\r\nbeing of our people. \r\n The Acting Chair (spoke in Spanish): I now give \r\nthe floor to His Excellency Mr. Urmas Paet, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Estonia. \r\n Mr. Paet (Estonia): The framework of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) represents a \r\nunique global effort and the most significant promise \r\never made to reduce poverty and inequality worldwide. \r\nIn order to keep our promise and provide hope, it is \r\nessential to learn from our past experience. We should \r\nkeep in mind that what worked well in one context may \r\nnot be a success elsewhere.  \r\n To date, the global record is mixed, as pointed out \r\nin the report of the Secretary-General (A/64/665). It \r\ndraws attention to important gains, but also to \r\nsignificant areas where much still remains to be done. \r\nThere has been insufficient progress on gender equality \r\nand the empowerment of women, which is an area that \r\nhas one of the largest multiplier effects on other \r\nMillennium Development Goals.  \r\n As a result of various crises, there are higher \r\nrates of unemployment, malnutrition and hunger. There \r\nare still areas with unacceptably sharp discrepancies. \r\nFor example, while almost all births are attended by \r\nskilled health personnel in developed countries, less \r\nthan half of women in parts of the developing world \r\nreceive such care. \r\n There are also success stories that I would like to \r\ntouch upon. First is the remarkable progress in overall \r\npoverty reduction. More and more children go to \r\nschool, and their health has improved. More people \r\nhave access to clean water, and remarkable success has \r\nbeen achieved in fighting malaria, tuberculosis and \r\nAIDS. No less important is the fact that the MDGs \r\nhave directed more attention to the issue of \r\ndevelopment worldwide. That has influenced \r\ngovernmental spending priorities and aligned \r\nA/65/PV.4  \r\n \r\n10-54115 50 \r\n \r\ndevelopment priorities more closely with poverty \r\nreduction. \r\n I would also like to touch upon the connection \r\nbetween achieving the MDGs and human rights; the \r\ntwo notions are strongly interconnected. Estonia \r\nentrusts the United Nations system with a central role \r\nin supporting national Governments in the achievement \r\nof the MDGs. We also supported that role in the \r\ndiscussions on United Nations system-wide coherence \r\nreform. Estonia warmly welcomes the consensus \r\nreached on that reform a few months ago, which paved \r\nthe way towards a more efficient and coherent United \r\nNations operational system (see resolution 64/289).  \r\n I welcome the historic consensus achieved just a \r\nfew months ago on the establishment of the United \r\nNations Entity for Gender Equality and the \r\nEmpowerment of Women, or UN Women (see \r\nresolution 64/289). I note with satisfaction the Entity’s \r\npositive impact on strengthening the ability of the \r\nUnited Nations to address the gaps in its activities on \r\ngender and to support countries in promoting gender \r\nequality. I would like to congratulate Ms. Michelle \r\nBachelet on her appointment as Under-Secretary-\r\nGeneral for the Entity, and look forward to her strong \r\nleadership in making it fully operational by 1 January \r\n2011. For that purpose, Estonia has already decided to \r\nmake its first contribution to UN Women. \r\n I would like to draw attention to the important \r\nlink between information and communications \r\ntechnology (ICT) and development, as the MDG \r\nframework includes a commitment on access to \r\ntechnologies. Estonia has experienced the relevance of \r\nthat goal in the past 20 years. For us, the development \r\nof ICT has truly been a crucial engine for economic \r\nprogress and modernization. ICT solutions have \r\nprovided better access to information for our citizens. \r\nICT has enabled them to participate at all levels of \r\ndecision-making; it has improved transparency in \r\ngovernance and provided new methods to fight crime \r\nand corruption. Based on that experience, I call for an \r\nadjustment of development paradigms. In today’s \r\nworld, ICT should not be a luxury good, but part of the \r\nbasic infrastructure. That is why ICT networks need to \r\nbe developed in parallel with other infrastructure \r\nprojects, such as roads, ports and energy systems. \r\n With the help of the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme and the Open Society Institute, Estonia has \r\nestablished a special agency to assist Governments in \r\ndeveloping countries with advice on and training in \r\nelectronic governance and the use of ICT in public \r\nservices. Estonian experts are currently advising \r\nGovernments all over the world. In several countries, \r\nwe support the development of an interoperability \r\nnetwork for better governance and for making public \r\nservices more transparent and efficient. We have also \r\nassisted computerization projects aimed at putting \r\ncontemporary ICT systems into use in educational \r\nsystems. \r\n As for education, which is the best engine for \r\ninnovation and growth, I am glad to note that \r\nsignificant progress has been made in sub-Saharan \r\nAfrica, where school enrolment has increased fivefold \r\nsince the 1990s.  \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) returned to the Chair. \r\n Estonia is firmly committed to supporting the \r\nglobal achievement of the MDGs by 2015. Since \r\ninitiating our first development cooperation project in \r\n1998, Estonia has become an international donor. \r\nToday, development cooperation enjoys a steady place \r\non our foreign policy agenda, and its importance is \r\ngrowing year by year. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): I \r\nnow give the floor to Mr. Alexis Thambwe Mwamba, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo. \r\n Mr. Thambwe Mwamba (Democratic Republic \r\nof the Congo) (spoke in French): Allow me to \r\ncongratulate the Co-Chairs on their joint appointment \r\nto preside over this High-level Plenary Meeting, thus \r\ndemonstrating the great importance that the General \r\nAssembly gives to development and the achievement \r\nof the Millennium Development Goals.  \r\n This meeting marks the start of the final \r\ncountdown to the deadline for attaining the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals: only five years remain. That is a \r\nshort time if the pace, slow at best, and the current \r\ntrends continue. However, it will be enough if, from \r\nnow on, we all decide to reverse those trends, \r\nimplement the commitments undertaken and thereby \r\nexpress our international solidarity to achieve the \r\nGoals. \r\n We are convinced that, with the appropriate \r\nmeans to act and sufficient financial resources, the \r\nMillennium Development Goals can be achieved in all \r\ndeveloping countries in general, and in the Democratic \r\n A/65/PV.4\r\n \r\n51 10-54115 \r\n \r\nRepublic of the Congo in particular. We are aware and \r\nwe are convinced that achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals is primarily the responsibility of \r\neach country. It is up to us, therefore, to ensure the \r\nimplementation of appropriate policies and the \r\nmobilization of sufficient support to take us out of \r\npoverty. \r\n We are also aware of the domestic constraints that \r\nhave so far hindered implementation of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and hence sustainable \r\ndevelopment in general. These include the lack of \r\nquality data to indicate progress made and guide \r\ndecision-making, the gap between commitments and \r\npayments of resources pledged within the framework \r\nof the many African initiatives, conflicts and the \r\ncontinuing economic and financial crisis.  \r\n Notwithstanding those obstacles, there is reason \r\nto believe that developing countries as well can \r\nachieve essentially all of the Goals, provided that they \r\nstrengthen their efforts and, in particular, increase \r\nfinancial investment in the public sector and encourage \r\nprivate business. \r\n With respect to the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo, my country, we are working to intensify our \r\nefforts to create an enabling environment and an \r\ninvestment climate favourable to development of the \r\nprivate sector in order to make up investment shortfalls \r\nand attract foreign direct investment, in particular \r\nthrough tax incentives and eliminating red tape. \r\n The Democratic Republic of the Congo has made \r\nnoticeable progress towards achieving some of the \r\nMillennium Goals. That progress includes net \r\nenrolment in primary schools, adult literacy, parity \r\nbetween boys and girls in primary education, and the \r\npolitical empowerment of women. The participation of \r\nwomen in decision-making processes and their \r\nrepresentation in the national parliament have \r\nincreased. Immunization rates for children have \r\nimproved; mortality for children under 5 years of age \r\nhas been reduced and the transmission rate of \r\nHIV/AIDS slowed. Substantial progress has also been \r\nachieved in the fight against tuberculosis, and the \r\nproportion of children sleeping under insecticide-\r\ntreated nets is showing a marked and continuous \r\nincrease.  \r\n The Democratic Republic of the Congo has also \r\nincreased its earnings due to its economic growth \r\nthrough austerity measures, discipline and a civic tax \r\nrequired of everyone. My country is working to reform \r\nthe security and justice sectors and to improve control \r\nwithin its public administration in order to manage \r\nstaffing levels.  \r\n Such good governance efforts have enabled my \r\ncountry to recently achieve the completion point of the \r\nHeavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative. \r\nHowever that work has not yet ended. We must \r\nstrengthen the national statistics system, which since \r\nFebruary 2010 has been governing the generation and \r\nuse of statistics in the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo. We must advance decentralization and promote \r\nland reform. We must work to protect the environment \r\nas the cornerstone of our efforts to protect species and \r\necosystems. \r\n Those efforts will not suffice and enable us to \r\nachieve the Millennium Goals without a global \r\nenvironment that is favourable to achieving \r\ndevelopment. Additionally, with regard to our partners, \r\nboth bilateral and multilateral, each as it is concerned, \r\nwe must secure the necessary changes in attitude. \r\n We recognize the praiseworthy efforts of our \r\ndevelopment partners to improve their assistance to \r\ndeveloping countries. We also acknowledge, as I \r\nmentioned earlier, that implementation of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals lies first of all with us. \r\nBut our international partners must also honour their \r\npledges and support the strategies implemented by the \r\ndeveloping countries. If our partners wish to see our \r\ncountries achieve the Millennium Goals, they will need \r\nto increase official development assistance, as so often \r\npromised. From that standpoint, we recall the \r\nMonterrey Consensus and all the other commitments \r\nmade.  \r\n We must break down barriers that continue to \r\nimpede implementation of an international treaty to \r\nregulate the arms trade, because in countries such as \r\nmine the uncontrolled circulation of those lethal \r\ndevices maintains in our countries and the entire \r\nsubregion an unstable situation that prevents \r\nimplementation of development programmes. \r\n The Democratic Republic of the Congo is a post-\r\nconflict country, where implementation of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals meets with more \r\nchallenges than elsewhere. Clearly it is impossible to \r\nassess today the consequences of the conflict for \r\nimplementation of the Millennium Goals. Thousands of \r\nwomen have been raped and subjected to violence. \r\nA/65/PV.4  \r\n \r\n10-54115 52 \r\n \r\nMillions of children have no possibility of attending \r\nschool because they are constantly on the move to flee \r\nthe war, and people have been forced to abandon their \r\nfields and herds and small-scale or subsistence-level \r\neconomic activities. Thousands of men, women and \r\nchildren have been infected through no fault of their \r\nown with HIV/AIDS and various sexually transmitted \r\ndiseases or suffer from malaria. Many women also die \r\nfrom giving birth in inappropriate conditions.  \r\n Because of all that the Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo requests that it be included among the \r\npriority programmes of development partners, with \r\nmore flexible assistance and financing modalities. We \r\nneed sustained assistance and action to consolidate \r\npeace and security and our national institutions, to train \r\nour armed forces and police, to create jobs for youth, in \r\nparticular to keep them occupied, to strengthen the \r\nState’s capacities to provide quality social services, to \r\nresettle the many displaced people and to accelerate the \r\nstrategy to reduce emissions from deforestation and \r\nforest degradation — REDD-plus — in short, to bring \r\nabout sustainable development and to achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. \r\n In the Democratic Republic of the Congo we \r\nremain convinced that with good international \r\ngovernance and in working together, achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals by 2015 is possible, in \r\norder to eradicate hunger and poverty and put the \r\ndeveloping countries, both individually and \r\ncollectively, on the path to growth and sustainable \r\ndevelopment. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): I \r\nnow call on His Excellency Mr. Hoshyar Zebari, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Iraq. \r\n Mr. Zebari (Iraq) (spoke in Arabic): Allow me \r\nfirst to congratulate you, Sir, on co-chairing this high-\r\nlevel meeting on the follow-up to the implementation \r\nof the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) agreed \r\nupon by our leaders in 2000. We are sure that the \r\nexperience of the Co-Chairs will be a main factor in \r\nthe success of our work in the light of the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the United Nations.  \r\n In the year 2000, our leaders defined the basic \r\ngoals for bringing about sustainable development for \r\nall. That would be accomplished through various \r\nactions to eradicate poverty and hunger, achieve \r\nuniversal primary education, promote gender equality, \r\nreduce child and maternal mortality, fight HIV/AIDS, \r\npreserve the environment and establish a global \r\npartnership. In general, we support the provisions of \r\nthe draft outcome document to be adopted at this \r\nMeeting (see A/65/L.1).  \r\n Certainly, some progress has been made in \r\nachieving the Goals, including with regard to the \r\nelimination of poverty. There has also been progress \r\nwith regard to international cooperation and solidarity \r\nin the achievement of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals — even though, five years from the target date \r\nfor attainment of the MDGs, more than a billion people \r\nare still living in extreme poverty. If significant \r\nprogress is not made during these five remaining years, \r\nthere will be negative consequences for all of our \r\nsocieties, which will create fertile ground for \r\ninstability, terrorism, violence, epidemics and \r\nenvironmental degradation. In our view, the MDGs can \r\nbe achieved with political will, sound policies, \r\nadequate resources, committed efforts and international \r\ncooperation.  \r\n The economic situation in Iraq has improved \r\nsignificantly thanks to the financial, economic and \r\ninvestment legislation adopted by our Government. As \r\na result, personal income and individual purchasing \r\npower and prosperity have increased. The Iraqi \r\nGovernment has prepared an ambitious budget for \r\n2010 not only to provide for reconstruction, but also to \r\nbuild a healthy and strong economy as we move \r\nforward.  \r\n On 4 April, the Iraqi Government launched a \r\nfive-year national development plan for 2010 to 2014. \r\nIt sets out some 2,700 strategic projects in various \r\nareas at an estimating a cost of $168 billion, to develop \r\nthe Iraqi economy and improve the quality of services \r\nprovided to Iraqis. The plan will create around \r\n4 million jobs and will thus contribute to addressing \r\nthe problem of unemployment in Iraq.  \r\n Iraq’s efforts to attain the MDGs include \r\nenhancing the agricultural sector and improving \r\nagricultural products by providing subsidies to farmers. \r\nThis will help to provide more food, reduce extreme \r\npoverty and hunger, increase household income, \r\nimprove nutrition and health care services and reduce \r\nthe level of infant mortality and post-partum maternal \r\nmortality.  \r\n In the area of primary education, we are \r\nrehabilitating and reforming the education sector, after \r\nthe arbitrary war launched by the previous regime \r\n A/65/PV.4\r\n \r\n53 10-54115 \r\n \r\nagainst its neighbours and its people and after the \r\nviolence and destruction that Iraq has experienced \r\nsince the fall of that regime. The rehabilitation effort \r\nhas been extended to all Iraqi provinces, including \r\nrural areas, and a programme to raise social awareness \r\nhas been carried out to warn children not to leave \r\nschool early. Iraq is planning to overcome all obstacles \r\nand restrictions that stand in the way of girls pursuing \r\nprimary, secondary and university education. An \r\nawareness-raising campaign has also been carried out \r\nto address social customs which sometimes prevent \r\ngirls from attaining a university education. Social \r\nprotection measures for women have also been \r\nadopted, including laws that ensure employment \r\nequality between men and women. There are three \r\nwomen Cabinet ministers in Iraq and women \r\nambassadors represent Iraq in important countries. \r\nWomen make up 25 per cent of members of parliament. \r\nThat is the highest proportion of women members of \r\nparliament in the region. \r\n In the area of health, the Ministry of Health has \r\nstrengthened the health care infrastructure and \r\nincreased the number of hospitals, pharmacies, health \r\ncare centres for pregnant women and centres for \r\nchronic and epidemic diseases. Health care training \r\ntakes place in Iraq and abroad with the help of United \r\nNations specialized entities in order to improve \r\nnational capacity, create health care centres and \r\nprovide health care to all citizens, particularly in rural \r\nareas and for poor and young people of both sexes. \r\n Global partnership is seen as the cornerstone of \r\ninternational cooperation. We are currently engaged in \r\ncooperation with the United Nations and its specialized \r\nagencies and programmes as part of our international \r\npartnerships for reconstruction and for building a \r\nliberal economy integrated with other countries in the \r\nregion and worldwide, as well as for improving the \r\nsocial and economic conditions of our people. The \r\nIraqi Government has also adopted significant \r\neconomic measures at the global level and has met its \r\ncommitments to the International Monetary Fund. It \r\nhas concluded bilateral agreements with trading \r\ncreditors to address and adjust the debt it inherited \r\nfrom the previous regime. Iraq has accomplished a lot \r\nin this area and has managed to reduce by 80 per cent \r\nits debts to the Paris Club. We hope that other creditor \r\nStates will act in the same way with a view to reducing \r\nour bilateral debt.  \r\n Finally, development remains primarily a national \r\nresponsibility and can be driven only through national \r\nownership and national leadership. Development takes \r\nits characteristics from national and regional capacities \r\nand specificities, and national resources play a large \r\nrole in designing a country’s development strategy. \r\nThere is no pre-established strategy that can be applied \r\nthroughout all areas of development.  \r\n The next five years will require continued work \r\nby all in order to achieve the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. Iraq hopes that this period will be decisive and \r\nthat it will lead to a qualitative leap in Iraq’s \r\ndevelopment, thus contributing to stability and \r\nprogress in the region. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): I \r\nnow give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Alvin \r\nBernard, Minister of State of the Commonwealth of \r\nDominica. \r\n Mr. Bernard (Dominica): I commence by \r\ncongratulating the Co-Chairs on the effective manner \r\nin which they have been conducting this High-level \r\nPlenary Meeting so far.  \r\n During the first five years of this millennium, \r\nslow but steady progress was being made towards the \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals. \r\nGlobally, there was a reduction in the number of \r\npersons living in extreme poverty and hunger, greater \r\naccess to primary-level education and a reduction in \r\nchild mortality.  \r\n That progress, however, has been stymied, and \r\nsome gains have been reversed as a result of the world \r\nfood crisis in 2006 and the energy crisis of 2007. The \r\nglobal economic and financial crisis in 2008 \r\nexacerbated the situation, with a more pronounced \r\nimpact on small, open and vulnerable economies like \r\nours. These crises brought into sharp focus the \r\ninterconnectivity of the world’s economies. In order to \r\novercome these challenges and to move apace with the \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals, a \r\nglobal approach is required. It is paramount that such a \r\nglobal approach recognize the central role of the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n With only five years left, we need to intensify our \r\nefforts. A good starting point is the fulfilment of the \r\ncommitments made in the Monterrey Consensus of \r\n2002. This must include the reconfiguration of the \r\ninternational financial institutions to take into account \r\nA/65/PV.4  \r\n \r\n10-54115 54 \r\n \r\nthe special needs of developing countries. The \r\ninternational financial institutions must take on the role \r\nof facilitators of development, without preconditions \r\nwhich are too onerous and in most cases alien and \r\nimpractical to the countries where the institutions’ \r\nprescriptions are being applied. \r\n These efforts must complement the Doha \r\nDevelopment Agenda. Developing countries must be \r\ngiven a fair chance to participate in the global trading \r\nsystem. The recognition of the special and differential \r\nstatus of developing countries, especially small island \r\ndeveloping States with small, open and vulnerable \r\neconomies, is critical to their survival in what has \r\nbecome a hostile global trading environment. This will \r\nensure that developing countries have a better chance \r\nto achieve the Millennium Development Goals in a \r\nsustainable manner. \r\n Another area requiring urgent attention is the \r\ncontribution of official development assistance and \r\ntechnology transfer. To date, the contributions of most \r\ndeveloped countries to the achievement of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals have been \r\ncommendable. Their contributions, at both the bilateral \r\nand multilateral levels, have made a significant \r\ncontribution to the realization of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. But as was alluded to earlier, \r\nthere needs to be a greater role for the United Nations \r\nin this process within a framework that is transparent, \r\nequitable and predictable. \r\n In spite of the many challenges, Dominica has \r\nbeen able to make some major achievements in pursuit \r\nof the Millennium Development Goals. We have been \r\nable to make these achievements through sound fiscal \r\npolicy, strong political leadership and the hard work of \r\nour people. The developed countries, especially the \r\nStates members of the European Union, continue to be \r\nreliable partners in our development efforts. Over the \r\npast five years we have seen an unprecedented \r\ncollaboration in the context of South-South \r\ncooperation with China, Cuba, Venezuela and Libya. \r\nThese interventions have been in the areas of social \r\nand physical infrastructure development. These \r\npartnerships have led to a marked decrease in \r\nhousehold poverty in Dominica from 39 per cent in \r\n2002 to 28.8 per cent in 2009. Per capita income has \r\nalso moved, from $11,430 in 2005 to $14,184 in 2008. \r\nIn 2005, we achieved universal secondary education. \r\nThis programme provides equally for boys and girls. \r\n The Caribbean region has been heavily affected \r\nby HIV/AIDS. The efforts by our regional \r\nGovernments to date, in partnership with the Clinton \r\nFoundation, the Pan American Health Organization and \r\nthe Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS \r\n(UNAIDS) are commendable. The education and \r\npublic awareness programmes have brought the issues \r\nof HIV/AIDS to the fore. We look forward to continued \r\nassistance by UNAIDS and other partners in public \r\neducation programmes and the provision of drugs, \r\nwhich will help to improve the quality of life of those \r\nwho are affected. \r\n The prevalence of chronic non-communicable \r\ndiseases is also of concern to us in the Caribbean. \r\nEarlier this year, the States members of the Caribbean \r\nCommunity (CARICOM) sponsored General Assembly \r\nresolution 64/265 to bring international focus to the \r\nincreasing threat of non-communicable diseases. We \r\nlook forward to a high-level meeting during the current \r\nsession, which will provide the framework for \r\ncombating non-communicable diseases. \r\n Dominica has been dubbed the nature island of \r\nthe Caribbean. This is due to prudent environmental \r\npolicies supported by legislation and the well-\r\nestablished practices and traditions of our people. \r\nConsequently, we have been able to protect our water \r\ncatchments, rivers, beaches, forests and marine \r\nreserves and to enjoy the sustainable use of our natural \r\nresources. In that light, the effects of climate change \r\nhave also made us more vulnerable to natural disasters. \r\nThese pose real threats to our ability to continue to \r\nwork towards the achievement of the MDGs. \r\n Since the early 1990s, up to 40 per cent of local \r\nelectricity has been generated from hydro-powered \r\nturbines. This has not only reduced the cost of \r\nelectricity but has also reduced our dependence on \r\nimported fossil fuels. Our target is to ensure that by \r\n2015 we will be able to provide 100 per cent of our \r\nelectricity from renewable sources. Over the past 10 \r\nyears we have been vigorously pursuing the \r\ndevelopment of geothermal energy. In partnership with \r\nthe Government of France, the regional councils of \r\nGuadeloupe and Martinique and the European \r\nCommission, we have been able to complete the first \r\nphase of the project. \r\n The next phase, to determine the quality and \r\nquantity of the resource, will begin shortly. We look \r\nforward to the commercialization phase, when we will \r\n A/65/PV.4\r\n \r\n55 10-54115 \r\n \r\nbe able to generate electricity not only for our domestic \r\nmarket but also for the neighbouring French islands of \r\nMartinique and Guadeloupe. \r\n As I indicated earlier, the achievement of the \r\nMDGs requires global action. It must be underscored \r\nthat such action must be premised on strong global \r\npartnerships, with a central role for the United Nations. \r\nWe must therefore continue to work towards the reform \r\nof the United Nations. Reform of the Security Council \r\nmust be addressed urgently so as to ensure that we can \r\ncreate a more democratic institution which reflects the \r\nrealities of the world today. \r\n Small island developing States must be \r\nrecognized as a special entity within the United \r\nNations system. Our small geographical size and our \r\nsmall and open economies with a narrow economic \r\nbase not only leave us susceptible to the vagaries of the \r\ninternational community but limit our policy options in \r\nresponding to emerging developments. Nonetheless, \r\nthe Commonwealth of Dominica remains committed to \r\nthe achievement of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): I \r\nnow give the floor to Mr. Abubakr Al-Qirbi, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Yemen. \r\n Mr. Al-Qirbi (Yemen): I am pleased to deliver \r\nthis statement on behalf of His Excellency Mr. Ali \r\nAbdullah Saleh, President of the Republic of Yemen \r\nand Chairman of the Group of 77 and China, on this \r\nauspicious occasion.  \r\n Ten years ago, the world joined its forces here at \r\nthe United Nations Headquarters to commit itself to \r\neradicating extreme poverty and hunger, combating \r\ninequalities, ensuring primary education for all, \r\npromoting gender equality and the empowerment of \r\nwomen, strengthening global public health and \r\npromoting sustainable development. To that end, a \r\nglobal partnership for development was established to \r\nharness global solidarity and promote national and \r\ninternational commitment in favour of development.  \r\n The Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2) \r\nand the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \r\nrepresent worthy commitments by the United Nations \r\nand its Member States. With less than five years to go \r\nuntil 2015, today’s High-level Meeting is a timely \r\nopportunity for all of us to highlight effective \r\ndevelopment strategies and initiatives that can serve as \r\nguidelines in our countries and regions, as well as to \r\nreflect on shortcomings and challenges that need to be \r\nurgently overcome.  \r\n Indeed, one of the main goals of this summit is to \r\nscale up the global partnership, to mobilize the \r\nadditional resources urgently needed and to address the \r\nremaining gaps and continuing challenges. It is \r\nincumbent on all of us to ensure that no country falls \r\nshort of the MDGs simply because of lack of resources. \r\nIn this regard, we must be fully committed to assisting \r\nthose countries that are lagging behind, especially the \r\nleast developed countries, the landlocked developing \r\ncountries and the small island developing States, as \r\nwell as Africa. The Group of 77 and China believes \r\nthat a strong global partnership for development should \r\nbe the centrepiece of international cooperation, with a \r\nview to ensuring the timely achievement of the MDGs.  \r\n We also must be committed to fulfilling our \r\nobligations in conformity with international law \r\nthrough taking further concrete collective action to \r\nremove all obstacles to the full realization of the rights \r\nof peoples living under foreign occupation, obstacles \r\nwhich continue to adversely affect their economic and \r\nsocial development and which are incompatible with \r\nthe dignity and worth of the human person and must be \r\ncombated and eliminated.  \r\n The development challenges that we face today \r\nshould not be underestimated. We express deep \r\nconcern over the current multiple interrelated and \r\nmutually exacerbating global crises, in particular the \r\nworld financial and economic crisis, volatile energy \r\nprices and the ongoing concern over food security, as \r\nwell as the challenges posed by climate change, which \r\ncould further undermine the achievements of the \r\ninternationally agreed development goals, including \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. \r\n The ongoing world financial and economic crisis \r\nhas reversed many important development gains in \r\ndeveloping countries and threatens to seriously \r\nundermine the achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals by 2015. Two years after the \r\noutbreak of the global financial crisis, developing \r\ncountries have still not fully recovered from the social \r\nand economic effects of the crisis. \r\n We recognize that all developing countries have \r\nmade significant efforts towards the achievement of the \r\nMDGs. Nevertheless, progress has been uneven from \r\ncountry to country and from Goal to Goal. Despite \r\nA/65/PV.4  \r\n \r\n10-54115 56 \r\n \r\npositive developments, there are still more than \r\n1 billion people living in situations of extreme poverty. \r\nThe Food and Agriculture Organization of the United \r\nNations recently noted a reduction in world hunger, but \r\nthe numbers of malnourished and undernourished \r\nremain staggering. Progress has also been slow in \r\nimproving in improving maternal health and reducing \r\nmaternal mortality. Insufficient advances have been \r\nmade in the area of gender equality and the \r\nempowerment of women. Almost half of the people in \r\ndeveloping countries continue to live without access to \r\nbasic sanitation. Too many people remain jobless or \r\nunderemployed, and more attention needs to be given \r\nto promoting growth and sustainable development. \r\n The Group of 77 and China stress the critical \r\nimportance of official development assistance both as a \r\ncomplement to other sources of financing and as a \r\ncatalyst for development, facilitating the achievement \r\nof national development objectives, including the \r\nMDGs. The global crisis cannot be an excuse for \r\navoiding existing aid commitments. On the contrary, \r\ntoday more than ever, developed countries must meet \r\nand scale up their existing bilateral and multilateral \r\nofficial development assistance and aid targets, in \r\nparticular, the commitment to reach the target of \r\n0.7 per cent of gross national product for official \r\ndevelopment assistance to developing countries by \r\n2015, and to reach the level of at least 0.5 per cent of \r\ngross national product for official development \r\nassistance by 2010, along with the target of 0.15 to \r\n0.2 per cent of gross national product for development \r\nassistance to the least developed countries. \r\n We confirm the importance of the United Nations \r\nMillennium Declaration (resolution 55/2) and \r\nunderscore the continuing relevance of the outcomes of \r\nall major United Nations conferences and summits in \r\nthe economic, social and related fields, as well as of \r\nthe important commitments contained therein. \r\nTogether, they constitute a coherent development \r\nagenda, providing the backbone of international \r\ndevelopment efforts. We stress that the achievements of \r\nthe internationally agreed development goals, \r\nincluding the MDGs, should continue to be the \r\noverarching framework of the development activities \r\nof the United Nations system. \r\n The G-77 and China believe that the United \r\nNations, given its universal membership, legitimacy \r\nand comprehensive mandate, must play a vital role in \r\nthe promotion of international cooperation for \r\ndevelopment and in support of accelerating the \r\nimplementation of internationally agreed development \r\ngoals. We stress the pivotal role of the United Nations \r\nin promoting coherence and coordination in global \r\neconomic governance. We stress the need to increase \r\nthe commitment of the United Nations development \r\nsystem to supporting national efforts to achieve the \r\nMDGs. The United Nations needs to strengthen its \r\ncapabilities and capacities to fully implement its \r\nmandate and to ensure the effective delivery of its \r\ndevelopment activities. \r\n This High-Level Meeting is an important step \r\ntowards accelerating development efforts and \r\nachieving the MDGs, but much more remains to be \r\ndone. The international community must now focus on \r\nimplementing agreed commitments and scaling up the \r\nglobal partnership for development. It is clear that \r\neconomic growth is a critical factor, but that alone \r\ncannot overcome the profound structural problems that \r\nbeset most developing countries. In order to ensure \r\ntheir effectiveness, development strategies must be \r\npursued in the context of a supportive international \r\nenvironment, with global institutions that take full \r\naccount of the needs of developing countries. We have \r\nseen that whatever progress has been made towards \r\nmeeting the MDGs has been possible only through the \r\ncombined efforts of national commitment, effective \r\nprogrammes, resources and international support. In \r\norder to support the national efforts of developing \r\ncountries, scaling up the Goals is critically important to \r\nthe achievement of all MDGs. \r\n The G-77 and China stand ready to do their part \r\nto promote development and foster growth in \r\ndeveloping countries with a view to ensuring the \r\ntimely achievement of the MDGs everywhere. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): I \r\nnow give the floor to His Eminence Cardinal Peter \r\nKodwo Appiah Turkson, President of the Pontifical \r\nCouncil for Justice and Peace of the Holy See. \r\n Cardinal Turkson (Holy See): I have the great \r\nhonour to convey the cordial greetings of His Holiness \r\nPope Benedict XVI to the Co-Chairs and to the Heads \r\nof State and Government assembled here during these \r\ndays to work together towards a world free of the \r\nplague of extreme poverty and to ensure that all \r\nchildren, women and men in every country of the \r\nworld enjoy the conditions necessary to live their lives \r\n A/65/PV.4\r\n \r\n57 10-54115 \r\n \r\nin freedom and dignity. And the Holy Father assures all \r\nparticipants the support of his prayers. \r\n In the year 2000, with the unanimous \r\nendorsement of the Millennium Declaration (resolution \r\n55/2), all Heads of State at the United Nations \r\nacknowledged the international struggle against \r\npoverty, and that it could not be limited to the \r\nmanagement of the great economic variables, such as \r\nfinances and foreign debts, commerce and development \r\naid. Rather, the family of nations appreciated the more \r\nspecifically human aspects of development, such as \r\neradicating hunger, promoting education, providing \r\nhealth care and social services, ensuring equal \r\nopportunities for work, and advocating responsible \r\nstewardship of the environment. \r\n Although many countries are still far from \r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \r\non time, great progress has been made in various ways \r\ntowards halving the number of people living below the \r\nabsolute poverty line. This encourages us all to \r\ndiscover the weaknesses, incongruities and conflicts in \r\nthe programme, to resolve them and so to move on to \r\nattain full success. \r\n Indeed, much still needs to be done to maintain \r\nand strengthen political mobilization through continued \r\neconomic and financial solidarity in order to guarantee \r\nthe availability of resources. In this regard, the Holy \r\nSee emphasizes the importance of strengthening the \r\nglobal partnership for development, which is a \r\nnecessary condition for the achievement of all the other \r\nGoals, and supports the full and integral compliance of \r\nthe Monterrey Consensus and the Doha Declaration on \r\nFinancing for Development. \r\n All Governments, of developed and developing \r\ncountries alike, must accept their responsibility to fight \r\ncorruption, tax evasion and all reprehensible conduct in \r\nthe areas of business and finance. The rule of law and \r\nthe promotion of the right to education, job security \r\nand basic health care must be upheld. \r\n The campaign for development carried out by \r\ninternational agencies has revealed that success is \r\nattributable not so much to economic assistance as it is \r\nto creativity, resourcefulness, commitment and the \r\nsacrifice of countless small actors, such as the plethora \r\nof faith-based organizations. These give life to the \r\nexpression “small is beautiful”, predicted many years \r\nago by economists and strongly inspired by the social \r\nteachings of the Church. \r\n For all of these reasons, population policies that \r\nviolate human dignity do not help the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals achieve their sublime objectives; \r\nstill less do they alleviate poverty. I know the poverty \r\nof deprivation and exclusion, as an African myself. I \r\nhave encountered really poor and destitute people in \r\nmy life and in my ministry as a religious leader, and I \r\nwould like to ask the international community, \r\nespecially the developed countries, not to \r\nunderestimate the resourcefulness of the poor and not \r\nto find them burdensome. If we assure poor countries \r\nof the effective mainframe of Millennium Development \r\nGoal 8, they will assume the shared responsibility and \r\nnational ownership of achieving the other Goals. The \r\nMillennium Development Goals should be used to fight \r\npoverty, not to eliminate the poor. \r\n The inherent and equal dignity, individuality and \r\ntranscendence of each human being must be the \r\nfoundation of each and every policy on development. \r\nIn this regard, on the much-debated issue of maternal \r\nhealth, the Holy See respectfully and fervently invites \r\nthe countries participating in this High-Level Meeting \r\nto provide quality resources for the health care needs \r\nof mothers and their babies, including the unborn. \r\nMoreover, the repeated references in the World Summit \r\nOutcome Document (resolution 60/1) to sexual and \r\nreproductive health and family planning raise deep \r\nconcerns. These are controversial terms, often \r\ninterpreted as including access to abortion and methods \r\nof family planning that are not in accord with natural \r\nlaw, known by reason. \r\n The family of nations has committed itself to \r\nfighting material poverty. This is a key and noble goal \r\nto pursue, but in this effort let us never forget that \r\nmaterial poverty has partners — relational, emotional \r\nand spiritual. The human person must be at the centre \r\nof concern in our quest for development. If everyone’s \r\npolitical, religious and economic rights and freedoms \r\nare respected, we will shift the paradigm from merely \r\ntrying to manage poverty to creating wealth; from \r\nviewing the person as a burden to seeing the person as \r\npart of the solution. It is in this conviction that the \r\nHoly See desires to collaborate with this summit in the \r\nquest for an era of peace, social justice and authentic \r\nand holistic human development. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): I \r\nnow give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Tomáš Dub, \r\nDeputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Czech \r\nRepublic. \r\nA/65/PV.4  \r\n \r\n10-54115 58 \r\n \r\n Mr. Dub (Czech Republic): It is my honour and \r\npleasure to address this High-level Plenary Meeting on \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to review \r\nprogress in the fulfilment of the Millennium \r\nDeclaration, which the Czech Republic fully supports. \r\n We welcome the political will to achieve the \r\nMDGs by 2015, which is to be confirmed at the highest \r\nlevel in a declaration at the end of this summit. \r\nHowever, we are convinced that the major task for the \r\nforthcoming 2010 — 2015 period will be to create \r\nmechanisms that will translate these reconfirmed \r\ncommitments into reality at the local level. \r\n It is also necessary to regularly update all \r\nnational development strategies and plans in the light \r\nof current realistic statistics and lessons learned, and to \r\nintegrate them gradually into national legislative \r\nsystems. We think that all meetings related to the \r\nMDGs up to 2015 should focus especially on the \r\nexchange of best practices in specific areas. \r\n In any case, innovative approaches leading to the \r\nachievement of the MDGs at the national and local \r\nlevels must be designed from the bottom up on the \r\nbasis of country-specific facts and holistic, community-\r\nled approaches. We therefore appreciate ongoing \r\nprojects such as, for example, the United Nations \r\nGlobal Compact and the Millennium Village project, \r\nwhich emphasize the involvement of the private sector \r\nin supporting the MDGs, not only in financial terms, \r\nbut also in terms of ensuring decent working \r\nconditions and respect for human rights within society.  \r\n In addition, non-governmental organizations play \r\nan irreplaceable role on the ground. Their experience is \r\nvery valuable and we should maintain a regular and \r\nopen dialogue with them. \r\n We are convinced that official development \r\nassistance or measures to curb inflation and public debt \r\nare not the only way to eradicate poverty. What is \r\nneeded is a combination of measures encouraging \r\nemployment, fiscal and monetary stabilization with a \r\ncountercyclical effect, the mobilization of domestic \r\nresources and good governance. We believe that these \r\nmeasures, together with concrete mechanisms of \r\nmutual accountability and policy coherence for \r\ndevelopment, are crucial to the sustainable \r\ndevelopment of many countries. We have therefore \r\nidentified these topics as priorities in the new strategies \r\nfor development cooperation and transition policy of \r\nthe Czech Republic. \r\n The transition experience gained by the Czech \r\nRepublic in the recent past gives us a comparative \r\nadvantage in development issues, as it has been \r\nacknowledged even by the Organisation for Economic \r\nCooperation and Development and the European \r\nUnion. Our expertise can help developing countries \r\nwith creating their public sector reform strategies, \r\nbuilding democratic governance and institutions, \r\npromoting the rule of law, and in the fight against tax \r\nevasion, as well as with other fiscal reform matters. \r\n We believe that transition promotion should be an \r\nintegral part of the development assistance provided by \r\nthe international community. The Czech Republic \r\nactively contributes to this objective by its efforts \r\nundertaken especially in Eastern Europe and the \r\nWestern Balkans. \r\n Last but not least, we believe that social \r\ndevelopment is a fundamental prerequisite for \r\nachieving all MDGs. However, we must approach it \r\nfrom a broader perspective, integrating such sectors as \r\nhealth, education, gender equity, water and sanitation, \r\npoverty reduction, nutrition and social protection. \r\n Good governance and respect for human rights \r\nare among the main priorities of the development \r\nagenda of the Czech Republic. We are determined to \r\nadvance and support good governance and the rule of \r\nlaw at all levels, as well as solid democratic \r\ninstitutions responsive to the needs of our people based \r\non the key principles of participation, accountability, \r\nintegrity and transparency. We are convinced that these \r\nare essential not only to the achievement of the MDGs \r\nbut also to sustained, inclusive and equitable \r\ndevelopment in general. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): I \r\nnow give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Sayyid \r\nBadr bin Hamad Al-Busaidi, State Minister of the \r\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs of the Sultanate of Oman. \r\n Mr. Al-Busaidi (Oman): The Millennium Summit \r\nheld in the year 2000 was a milestone in international \r\ncooperation. There, our Heads of State and \r\nGovernment adopted the Millennium Declaration \r\n(resolution 55/2), in which they identified eight \r\ndevelopment goals that, if implemented, would lead to \r\na world with less poverty, hunger and disease, and with \r\ngreater access to health care and education. \r\n Here we are, 10 years later and five years from \r\nthe target date, meeting to undertake a comprehensive \r\n A/65/PV.4\r\n \r\n59 10-54115 \r\n \r\nreview of progress made and to determine what extra \r\nmeasures we could adopt to accelerate action on the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) between now \r\nand 2015. Success in some areas has put many regions \r\non track. Progress continues to be made in poverty \r\nreduction, school enrolment, controlling malaria and \r\nHIV, and the provision of safe water resources in rural \r\nareas. However, there is a danger that many of the \r\nMDG targets may not be met in most regions. \r\n In this time of economic crisis, combating global \r\npoverty, disease and inequality is no easy task. The \r\nnegative impact of natural disasters, epidemics and \r\ncivil unrest serve to make debt-ridden developing \r\ncountries poorer still.  \r\n The MDGs are the most broadly supported, \r\ncomprehensive and specific objectives upon which the \r\nworld has ever agreed. They constitute the most \r\nambitious plan in human history to combat global \r\npoverty and produce sustainable progress in the quality \r\nof life. It is this global participatory approach that is \r\nkey. This summit is invaluable in reviewing the \r\nprogress, achievements and challenges we have faced \r\nover the last decade. It is equally important, however, \r\nto develop a plan for the coming years in order to \r\nensure that these targets do not become empty \r\nidealism.  \r\n Moreover, this initiative does not end in 2015. \r\nAcross the world, progress towards these Goals has \r\nbeen unequal. Politicized aid-giving factionalizes the \r\nglobal community and reduces the MDGs to a cruel \r\ncharade. We call upon all to do what they can to ensure \r\nthat development reaches everyone and everywhere. \r\nGlobal partnership is a key tool and an important \r\napproach. Donors and recipients must work together \r\nwith these aims as their common and unifying goal. \r\n The Sultanate of Oman, under the wise leadership \r\nof His Majesty Sultan Qaboos Bin Said, continues to \r\nachieve positive progress in all of the identified areas \r\nin the context of the MDGs. This has had a tangible \r\neffect on our society and economy. For example, our \r\nmortality rates for infants and children under five per \r\n1,000 live births have fallen by 29 per cent since 1990, \r\nwhile His Majesty’s promotion of women to numerous \r\nleadership positions in our society has provided a \r\nmeritocratic example, founded on the basic principle of \r\nequality. \r\n I would like to put before the Assembly, however, \r\ntwo challenges for consideration. These challenges are \r\nbeing faced both globally and locally and should be taken \r\ninto account in our action plan. Non-communicable \r\ndiseases and road traffic accidents are the cause of almost \r\n60 per cent and 15 per cent, respectively, of premature \r\ndeaths worldwide. I am sure that members will share our \r\nconcern at such figures and our desire to approach these \r\nissues together. \r\n Resolution 64/255 of 2 of March 2010 \r\nproclaimed a Decade of Action for Road Safety. It \r\nacknowledged road safety to be a major public health \r\ncrisis which, if unaddressed, would “hinder progress \r\ntowards the Millennium Development Goals”. Road \r\nsafety has been overlooked as a contributor to the \r\nachievement of the MDGs despite its cross-cutting \r\nimpact upon six of the MDGs and the fact that it has a \r\nkey role to play in alleviating poverty. \r\n The attainment of the MDGs is a realistic aim for \r\nthe future. If politics is the art of the possible, then let \r\nus be clear — achieving the MDGs is possible. But this \r\nis only the case if we foster a more active global \r\ncommunity and a shared humanitarian ethos. To \r\nsucceed in these intentions, we must reflect on the old \r\nsaying, “a stranger is a friend I have not yet met”. Let \r\nus help our friends, let us help strangers and let us help \r\neach other. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): I \r\nnow give the floor to Mr. Max Henderson Hernández, \r\nVice-Minister of Planning of Mexico. \r\n Mr. Hernández (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nTen years ago, world political leaders met at the \r\nHeadquarters of this Organization to express, through \r\nthe Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2), their \r\ncommitment to fighting poverty and hunger and to \r\nimproving the health and educational conditions of the \r\nworld’s most vulnerable groups. \r\n Five years from the deadline established to \r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), \r\nthis Meeting is of the highest relevance because it \r\nallows us to assess the progress achieved and the \r\nchallenges that remain. In particular, it allows us to \r\nreiterate our decisive commitment to achieving the \r\nGoals. \r\n For Mexico, the achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals is a State commitment. Mexico has \r\ntherefore taken decisive action, nationally and \r\ninternationally, to achieve the MDGs, since, even if \r\nthey are concrete goals that help us to organize our \r\nA/65/PV.4  \r\n \r\n10-54115 60 \r\n \r\nefforts, they are only a basic framework and the \r\nminimum necessary to guarantee that our most \r\nvulnerable populations can live better. \r\n We reiterate that the Millennium Development \r\nGoals are an integral part of Mexican social policy. The \r\nsustainable human development focus of the social \r\nprogrammes of the Government of Mexico emphasizes \r\nthe relationship between the economic and social \r\nspheres. To effectively integrate these two spheres and \r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals, Mexico \r\nrelies on a “live better” strategy, with the following \r\nareas for action.  \r\n First is the development of Mexicans’ basic skills \r\nthrough programmes on food, health, education, \r\nhousing and social infrastructure. Second is the \r\nconsolidation of a social protection network so that \r\nMexicans can face diverse contingencies, such as \r\naccidents, diseases or material losses caused by natural \r\ndisasters. Third is the establishment of bridges that \r\nconnect social and economic policies, with the aim of \r\nincreasing Mexicans’ capacities and skills so they can \r\nbe successfully included in economic development. \r\n In this context, Mexico has registered important \r\nadvances in the achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. It is my pleasure to inform the \r\nAssembly that we have achieved the goal set for 2015 \r\nof reducing by half the percentage of people with \r\nincomes lower than $1 a day. Similarly, Mexico has \r\nregistered significant progress in the Goals related to \r\nprimary education for all children and the elimination \r\nof gender inequalities in primary and secondary \r\neducation. \r\n It is my honour to inform the Assembly that, in \r\nthe framework of the International Year of Youth, \r\nMexico hosted the World Youth Conference from 23 to \r\n27 August. Its outcome, the Guanajuato Declaration, \r\nwhich was endorsed by 112 countries, underlines the \r\nimportance of the achievement of the MDGs for young \r\npeople and offers a series of recommendations to \r\naddress comprehensively and transversally the needs of \r\nthat population group. \r\n Furthermore, we in Mexico are fully convinced \r\nthat health is of the utmost importance to every family. \r\nWe also acknowledge the importance for all Mexicans \r\nto be able to receive health services whenever they \r\nneed them. \r\n From the very start of the millennium, Mexico \r\nhas offered public insurance that makes health services \r\navailable to all Mexicans who, for whatever reason, do \r\nnot contribute or have not contributed to the social \r\nsecurity system, recognizing that health is a social \r\nright, not a labour right. By 2012, all Mexicans without \r\nexception will have access to a doctor, medicine and \r\nmedical treatment when needed. That is to say, Mexico \r\nwill achieve universal health coverage, which is a \r\npriority of the social policy of President Felipe \r\nCalderón. Through this mechanism, we are fighting \r\nchild and maternal mortality, offering medical care and \r\nservices to women at risk, starting from the gestational \r\nperiod. In addition, we prevent disease through a \r\nuniversal programme of vaccination for children, \r\nwhich provides more than 98 per cent of children with \r\n15 vaccines, including against pneumococcus and \r\nrotavirus. \r\n Mexico, along with many other nations, has \r\nregistered significant improvements in the treatment of \r\npeople with HIV/AIDS. Today, we guarantee free \r\nuniversal access to antiretroviral medicines for all \r\nMexicans. \r\n The adverse effects of climate change confirm \r\nthat we cannot afford the luxury of doing nothing. The \r\ncosts of not addressing the problem are huge, both in \r\neconomic and human terms, and they negatively affect \r\nthe well-being of present and future generations. \r\nMexico will host the sixteenth Conference of the \r\nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention \r\non Climate Change and the sixth Conference of the \r\nParties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the \r\nKyoto Protocol, from 29 November to 10 December \r\n2010 in Cancún. \r\n Mexico hopes for a successful conference and \r\nwill do everything possible to facilitate and identify \r\nsolutions, but we need other countries to do the same. \r\nWe have begun this task and we have received a very \r\npositive message from the international community \r\nthat we can reach concrete, operational, specific and \r\nambitious results in Cancun. We make an emphatic call \r\nto political leaders around the world to find the \r\npolitical will to enable us to take actions of the needed \r\nscope. \r\n Moreover, to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals it is necessary to move forward in \r\nthe consolidation of the global partnership for \r\ndevelopment. Mexico, a determined promoter of \r\n A/65/PV.4\r\n \r\n61 10-54115 \r\n \r\nmultilateralism in its foreign policy, maintains this goal \r\nas a priority. In this regard, Mexico affirms the \r\nimportance of the agenda set forth in the Monterrey \r\nConsensus of the International Conference on \r\nFinancing for Development, which, in its holistic \r\napproach, enumerates conditions necessary to achieve \r\nthe MDGs. \r\n International cooperation in development must be \r\nmade more effective through better use of human and \r\nfinancial resources and by promoting positive \r\nsynergies among various types of technical and \r\nscientific cooperation, including traditional, triangular \r\nand South-South models of cooperation. Mexico fulfils \r\nits part as a committed partner in plans for South-South \r\ncooperation and triangular cooperation. We are \r\nconvinced that our experience in development can be \r\nuseful to other countries, particularly in the \r\nachievement of the MDGs. \r\n Further, Mexico reiterates that trade can and \r\nshould play an essential role in overcoming poverty \r\nand in the attainment of the well-being of nations. It is \r\ntherefore essential to resist protectionist pressures, \r\nparticularly those that affect developing countries, to \r\nreject all forms of protectionism and to promote \r\ninvestment in trade. \r\n Our country assumes as an obligation its \r\nresponsibility to contribute to a global aid architecture \r\nthat is better coordinated and that better promotes \r\ndevelopment, allowing effective progress towards the \r\nfull and comprehensive attainment of the MDGs. They \r\nare all achievable. \r\n Five years from the deadline, this is without a \r\ndoubt the moment to redouble our efforts and move \r\nforward in building a more unified, inclusive and fair \r\nworld that is humane and respectful of all rights. Let us \r\nput aside doubt and lean into the work of achieving the \r\ngoals that we have set for ourselves. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): \r\nThe Assembly will now hear an address by \r\nMs. Caroline Ziade, deputy chair of the delegation of \r\nthe Lebanese Republic. \r\n Ms. Ziade (Lebanon) (spoke in Arabic): First of \r\nall, I would like to thank the Co-Chairs for their efforts \r\nin this High-level Plenary Meeting on the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). I would also like to thank \r\nthe Secretary-General for his report, “Keeping the \r\npromise: a forward-looking review to promote an \r\nagreed action agenda to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals by 2015” (A/64/665). \r\n Inasmuch as the vital lesson to be learned is that \r\npolitical will is needed to turn words into deeds and \r\nattain the MDGs by 2015, today’s meeting is of \r\nparticular importance. It must be an opportunity to \r\nreaffirm commitments to implement the Goals and to \r\nstrengthen partnerships among Governments, the \r\nprivate sector and specialized financial institutions. \r\n Like other countries, Lebanon has suffered and \r\ncontinues to suffer from the negative repercussions of \r\nclimate change, the food crisis and the world financial \r\ncrisis, as well as from other aspects of globalization, \r\nwhich have widened the gap between the world’s rich \r\nand poor. My country is committed to taking up these \r\nchallenges. In the first half of this year, in cooperation \r\nwith the United Nations Development Programme, we \r\npublished a report on Lebanon’s commitment to the \r\nattainment of the MDGs. The report indicates that, \r\noverall, Lebanon is on track to implement the MDGs \r\nby 2015.  \r\n Let me give a few examples. The report shows that \r\nLebanon has managed to reduce the rate of its citizens \r\nliving in poverty from 27 per cent in 1995 to 8 per cent \r\nin 2004. The number of students who have finished \r\nprimary school rose from 95 per cent in 2001-2002 to \r\n96 per cent in 2005-2006. The report also shows that \r\ngender equality, with respect to the level of education of \r\ngirls, has increased. Still, more effort must be made to \r\nachieve equality in the political decision-making \r\nprocess. The number of women parliamentarians at the \r\nlast elections was no more than six. However, the \r\nnumber of seats won by women in the most recent \r\nmunicipal elections went up slightly, from 1.9 per cent \r\nin 2004 to 4.68 per cent in 2009. \r\n Until 2006, Lebanon had been able to make some \r\nnotable achievements in the area of environmental \r\nsustainability, and according to performance indicators \r\nin that sphere, it ranked thirty-sixth among 133 \r\ncountries, and first among Arab countries. But Israel’s \r\nwar against Lebanon in 2006 had devastating effects on \r\nthe environment and economic and social development. \r\nThat aggression caused large-scale damage, costing \r\nmore than $2 billion. Thousands of homes were \r\ndestroyed, as well as basic infrastructure such as \r\nbridges and roads. The bombing of hydroelectric plants \r\nand fuelling stations created an environmental disaster, \r\nA/65/PV.4  \r\n \r\n10-54115 62 \r\n \r\nincluding an oil spill that spread over 150 kilometres of \r\ncoastline.  \r\n The level of our indebtedness is very high and \r\nplaces a great burden on our treasury. We are trying to \r\nreduce the servicing of public debt through various \r\nmeasures, and we have managed to reduce debt-service \r\ncosts from 18 per cent of GDP in 2000 to 12 per cent in \r\n2008.  \r\n In conclusion, we realize that developing \r\ncountries must make basic structural reforms, build \r\ntheir institutional capacities and develop national \r\nstrategies to revitalize sustainable development and \r\nhelp to eradicate poverty. But we reaffirm that \r\ndeveloped countries should also keep their promises. \r\nThey should provide financial and technical assistance \r\nto help developing countries strengthen their \r\neconomies, so that the promises will not be vain \r\ndreams for the world’s poor, mirages that keep \r\nreceding with every step forward.  \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): In \r\naccordance with resolution 64/184, of 21 December \r\n2009, and decision 65/504, of 20 September 2010, I \r\nnow give the floor to His Excellency Mr. José Manuel \r\nBarroso, President of the European Commission, who \r\nwill speak on behalf of the European Union. \r\n Mr. Barroso (European Union): The new \r\nmillennium brought with it a great vision and a great \r\ngoal — to reduce poverty by half by 2015. Never \r\nbefore has humankind set itself such a daunting task, \r\nnor such a meaningful one. \r\n Extreme poverty is the most challenging global \r\nissue. Our technical progress is mocked when men, \r\nwomen and children are still starving, continue to be \r\nvulnerable to HIV infection, are forced to subsist in \r\ndegraded environments or are unable to exercise the \r\nmost basic of their human rights. It need not be like \r\nthis. We must strengthen our collective resolve to \r\nconfront the social and gender inequalities that lock all \r\ntoo many people into poverty. If developing countries \r\nstand by their priorities and developed countries stand \r\nby their commitments, the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs) will become millennium development \r\nachievements. \r\n The European Union has kept the fight against \r\npoverty high on its agenda. European citizens \r\nthemselves demand this. As the world’s leading donor, \r\naccounting for more than 50 per cent of all \r\ndevelopment aid, the European Union has contributed \r\nto the achievement of the MDGs from the beginning. \r\nMuch has been achieved so far. The European \r\nCommission alone has helped put 9 million more girls \r\nand boys in schools since 2004. We have connected \r\n31 million households to clean drinking water. \r\nHowever, much remains to be done. There is no place \r\nfor complacency. We must increase our efforts to reach \r\nour common objectives over the next five years. \r\n In June of this year, Europe’s leaders agreed an \r\nambitious plan that takes things up a gear. It prioritizes \r\naction on those goals where we have made least \r\nprogress and in those regions and countries that are \r\nmost lagging behind, including those experiencing \r\nconflict, crises and fragility of governance. The plan \r\nalso confirms our commitment to meet the 0.7 per cent \r\ngross national income target by 2015 and to assess \r\nprogress on this every year. My hope is that this will \r\nencourage other donors, including emerging partners, \r\nto step up their own level of ambition. \r\n The European Union stands with countries in \r\ndifficulty. We are a reliable partner, even in times of \r\neconomic downturn. During the food crisis we \r\nprovided €1.5 billion in additional support through a \r\nfood facility and a flexibility instrument reaching \r\n50 countries and benefiting 50 million people. \r\n Today, I have come to the General Assembly to \r\nreaffirm Europe’s commitment to this challenge. I wish \r\nto announce that the European Union is ready to offer \r\nto the most committed and needy countries an MDG \r\ninitiative amounting to €1 billion to make progress on \r\nthose Goals we are furthest from achieving. \r\n We have to produce more effective results, \r\nbecause time is running out. But aid is a catalyst, not a \r\ncure. No country has ever been transformed by aid \r\nalone. That is why it is also important that our partners \r\ntake charge of their own development. That means \r\nmobilizing domestic policies and resources to support \r\nthe MDGs. It also means being fully accountable for \r\ndevelopment results, for the management of aid as well \r\nas domestic budgets, and being totally transparent. \r\n We share the responsibility for ensuring success. \r\nJust as donors should be held accountable, partner \r\ncountries should also be accountable for the results \r\nthey achieve. We owe this to all our fellow human \r\nbeings fighting to survive on a dollar a day. \r\n A/65/PV.4\r\n \r\n63 10-54115 \r\n \r\n We must all act now and in solidarity to make the \r\nMDGs a reality by 2015. But halving poverty will only \r\nsolve half the problem. If we can achieve our goals, an \r\neven greater prize will be within our grasp — the \r\nultimate eradication of all poverty in its various \r\nmanifestations. That is something worth fighting for. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): In \r\naccordance with resolution 64/184, of 21 December \r\n2009, and decision 65/504, of 20 September 2010, I \r\nnow give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Ekmeleddin \r\nIhsanoglu, Secretary General of the Organization of the \r\nIslamic Conference. \r\n Mr. Ihsanoglu (Organization of the Islamic \r\nConference): I am extremely delighted to address this \r\nMeeting. I am equally delighted to note that the major \r\nobjectives of human capital development, which the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) process seeks \r\nto achieve, have considerably inspired the economic \r\ncomponent of the Organization of the Islamic \r\nConference (OIC) 10-year programme of action, which \r\nwill run its full course in 2015. The welfare of the poor \r\nand vulnerable segments of the population of the 57 \r\nOIC member States, most of which are developing \r\ncountries, was foremost in the minds of OIC leaders \r\nwho adopted the programme at the Mecca summit in \r\nDecember 2005. Poverty remains one of the biggest \r\nchallenges to the socio-economic development of \r\ndeveloping countries, especially those in sub-Saharan \r\nAfrica and South Asia.  \r\n The OIC has undertaken a host of initiatives \r\ntowards the attainment of the MDGs through a \r\npartnership with its member States and affiliated \r\ninstitutions. The Organization has always felt an urgent \r\nneed to develop interaction among its member States \r\nby setting up several relevant mechanisms in various \r\nfields for the attainment of goals that are in line with \r\nthe MDGs.  \r\n Given that seven of the eight MDGs are directly \r\nrelated to poverty alleviation — while the eighth calls \r\nfor a global partnership for development — the OIC \r\nIslamic Solidarity Fund for Development provides a \r\n$10 billion financing window that serves as a unique \r\nexample of innovative South-South cooperation. The \r\nFund targets the least developed OIC countries.  \r\n Indeed, of the world’s 50 least developed \r\ncountries today, 22 are OIC member States, 18 of them \r\nin Africa. In addition, 12 OIC member States in Asia \r\nand Africa are landlocked developing countries, while \r\nsix others in Asia, Africa and the Americas are small \r\nisland developing countries. Both those groups face \r\nunique development challenges because of their \r\ngeographical limitations and are in dire need for \r\nscaled-up targeted development assistance if they are \r\nto make progress towards the attainment of the MDGs. \r\n OIC poor countries will benefit from sustained \r\ncapacity-building assistance for poverty alleviation \r\nprojects and investment in the development of trade \r\nand industry, technology transfers, the cancellation of \r\nbilateral and multilateral debt by donor member States \r\nand the promotion of the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment — all of which have been identified as \r\nnecessary steps for poverty alleviation and economic \r\ndevelopment. \r\n At the cultural level, the OIC is working hard to \r\ndisseminate the culture of moderation while combating \r\nextremism and terrorism. The OIC was a pioneer in \r\ncalling for dialogue among civilizations and cultures \r\nand for interfaith dialogue, including launching the \r\nappeal for historic reconciliation between Islam and \r\nChristianity. \r\n In addition to its General Secretariat, the OIC \r\nruns different subsidiary organs and affiliated and \r\nspecialized institutions. In this era of globalization, the \r\nOIC mandates encompass all domains, ranging from \r\npolitics, economics, trade and social and cultural \r\ndevelopment to education, Islamic jurisprudence and \r\nscience and technology.  \r\n The OIC Special Programme for the Development \r\nof Africa is a $12 billion facility aimed at advancing \r\nactivities favouring the poor. The sectoral priorities \r\nunder the Programme are specifically geared towards \r\nattaining the MDGs and promoting economic growth \r\nand regional integration. It focuses, first, on agriculture \r\nfor food security; secondly, water and sanitation; thirdly, \r\ngeneration and distribution of power; fourthly, transport \r\ninfrastructure; fifthly, education and, sixthly, eliminating \r\nmajor communicable diseases. A total of 191 operations \r\nhave been financed in sub-Saharan African countries, \r\nwith a total value of $1.8 billion. \r\n Significantly, the reinvigorated funding mechanisms \r\nunder the OIC Islamic Solidarity Fund have created the \r\ndesired impact in the educational sector. Consequently, \r\nthe three OIC universities in Bangladesh, Niger and \r\nUganda have continued to prepare youth in OIC \r\nmember States for development goals. \r\nA/65/PV.4  \r\n \r\n10-54115 64 \r\n \r\n Let me say at this juncture that the ongoing \r\ncooperation between the OIC and the United States \r\nGovernment on the eradication of polio in affected OIC \r\nmember States has opened up new perspectives for \r\nincreasing international partnership with OIC \r\ncountries. \r\n Similarly, the creation by the OIC of an \r\norganization for the promotion of the welfare of \r\nwomen in OIC countries is complementary to the \r\nongoing series of activities within the OIC to \r\nmainstream women into trade. \r\n Notwithstanding the efforts of OIC in mobilizing \r\nsupport for actions to mitigate the effect of crises, there \r\nis a need for global partnership to address the pertinent \r\nissues raised by the crises. It that regard, I wish to \r\ncommend the participation of three OIC countries in \r\nthe Group of 20 (G-20), which is now preoccupied \r\nwith the reform of the international financial \r\narchitecture. We are of the view that wider consultation \r\nwithin the G-20 is necessary so as to reflect the varied \r\nfinancial systems in the world, particularly considering \r\nthe current mandate of the meeting of central bank \r\ngovernors of OIC countries. \r\n As we continue to concretize our efforts in the \r\nnext five years towards the realization of these \r\nobjectives, let me underscore the OIC’s unwavering \r\ncommitment to the MDGs. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): In \r\naccordance with 64/184, of 21 December 2009, and \r\ndecision 65/64, of 20 September 2010, I now give the \r\nfloor to His Excellency Mr. Anders Johnsson, Secretary \r\nGeneral of the Inter-Parliamentary Union.  \r\n Mr. Johnsson (Inter-Parliamentary Union): I \r\nbring to this Meeting, at this late hour, the greetings of \r\nthe President of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), \r\nMr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, who, as the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly who presided over the adoption of \r\nthe Millennium Declaration in 2000, much regrets that \r\nurgent business prevents him from being with us here \r\ntoday. \r\n A few weeks back, under his leadership, speakers \r\nof parliaments from most countries in the world \r\nconvened in Geneva to attend the third World \r\nConference of Speakers of Parliament. Their \r\nparliamentary summit issued a call for securing global \r\ndemocratic accountability for the common good. We \r\nhave circulated the outcome document, and I commend \r\nit to the Assembly’s attention. It contains several \r\ncommitments to strengthen democracy through \r\nparliaments, including here at the United Nations.  \r\n The speakers of parliament call for an \r\nimaginative leap of faith. They emphatically state that \r\ntoday’s multilateral systems should allow for much \r\ngreater consideration for the feelings and aspirations of \r\npeople everywhere. The speakers call for greater \r\nparliamentary involvement in international cooperation \r\nto help remedy this deficiency and propose actions to \r\nbe taken by parliaments and by the IPU in pursuit of \r\nthis objective. \r\n The speakers’ summit had a dual objective: to \r\ntake stock of progress in developing a parliamentary \r\ndimension to international cooperation, and to assess \r\nparliamentary involvement in support of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). The MDGs, \r\nthe speakers declared, will not be met without an \r\naccompanying sense of accountability. Democracy, \r\nsecurity, development, human rights and gender \r\nequality are inextricably linked. The speakers pledged \r\nto support efforts in parliaments to ensure that the \r\nDevelopment Goals are taken into account in their \r\ndaily work and translated into national programmes \r\nand laws. They encouraged all parliaments, when \r\nexamining draft budgets and bills, to assess their \r\nimpact on the fulfilment of the MDGs. \r\n Women speakers of parliament who met in Bern \r\non the eve of the parliamentary summit called for \r\nstronger efforts at meeting MDGs 4 and 5 and invited \r\nall parliaments to join them in implementing the Bern \r\nInitiative for Global Parliamentary Action on Maternal \r\nand Child Health. \r\n Taking stock of progress, the speakers noted that \r\nmuch work has already been done in parliaments to \r\nlegislate to make the Goals achievable. Where there \r\nhas been less progress is in the area of parliamentary \r\noversight and review of progress. Here, there is scope \r\nfor improvement. It is of course understandable that \r\nofficials, already burdened by elaborate and time-\r\nconsuming MDG reporting requirements, might be \r\ndisinclined to extend the process further by tabling the \r\nreports in parliament. However, the investment is well \r\nworth it. \r\n At the end of the day, none of the Goals will \r\nsucceed unless there is broad political support and \r\nnational ownership. In fact, the only way to forge a \r\ntruly national agenda is by bringing all parties on \r\n A/65/PV.4\r\n \r\n65 10-54115 \r\n \r\nboard. The only place where that can be done is \r\nparliament. In other words, the fulfilment of the MDGs \r\nis also an exercise in democracy. \r\n The work that the IPU and member parliaments \r\nhave carried out in support of the MDGs over several \r\nyears, as well as the recent debate among speakers, \r\ndemonstrate palpable progress on the MDGs — enough \r\nto justify a more upbeat mood than in the past. \r\nAccording to the debates, there is universal support for \r\nthe claim that better oversight of development aid is \r\nessential.  \r\n Additionally, the trade regime must change. \r\nThere is no hope for balanced trading conditions when \r\ndomestic production is still so heavily subsidized in \r\nsome parts of the world.  \r\n Excessive policy conditionality also remains an \r\nissue in many countries. Good governance remains key \r\nto the success of the MDGs, and good governance \r\ncorrelates positively with development results. \r\n Several delegations present in New York these \r\ndays include members of parliament. The IPU \r\nwelcomes this growing practice and encourages other \r\nGovernments to follow suit. We are meeting with them \r\ntomorrow to develop a strategy for ensuring greater \r\nparliamentary involvement and active support for \r\nattaining the MDGs by 2015. As we do so, we will of \r\ncourse look to the Assembly’s outcome document \r\n(A/65/L.1) and to the many reports and comparative \r\nstudies we are ourselves have prepared and circulated \r\nin advance of today’s summit. But more than anything, \r\nwe will want to regenerate that very special moment \r\nwhich existed at the turn of the millennium, an \r\nextraordinary moment when all the world’s leaders \r\ncongregated in New York to make a commitment to \r\nimproving the lives of people everywhere, the very \r\npeople we, as members of parliament, represent. The \r\nIPU has a special place in the declaration they adopted \r\non that occasion (resolution 55/2), and we are happy to \r\nshoulder the responsibility they have placed on us. \r\n Let me end therefore by making a commitment on \r\nbehalf of the IPU. We will redouble our efforts to \r\nmobilize and assist parliaments in doing their part in \r\nattaining the MDGs by 2015. We will also start \r\nworking with them here and now, so that by the time \r\nthey meet five years from now, parliaments will be part \r\nof the process that will set future development goals. \r\nThat will be both a political and a practical way to \r\nstrengthen the role of the United Nations in global \r\ngovernance. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): In \r\naccordance with General Assembly resolution 64/184 \r\nof 21 December 2009 and decision 65/504 of \r\n20 September 2010, I now give the floor to Ms. Sima \r\nBahous, Assistant Secretary General for Social Affairs \r\nof the League of Arab States. \r\n Ms. Bahous (League of Arab States) (spoke in \r\nArabic): At the outset, I should like, on behalf of the \r\nLeague of Arab States and its Secretary General, \r\nMr. Amre Moussa, to express my gratitude to the \r\nUnited Nations and its specialized agencies for their \r\nable efforts to achieve comprehensive and sustainable \r\ndevelopment and for their support for and cooperation \r\nwith Arab States, in particular the less developed \r\namong them, in various areas of development. I would \r\nalso express our appreciation to all our international \r\npartners who are present today at this important High-\r\nlevel Meeting. We hope the Meeting will be an \r\nopportunity to evaluate, objectively and responsibly, \r\nour progress in achieving the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs). We also hope that the Meeting will \r\nclarify the steps we need to take to move forward to \r\nattain the MDGs by the year 2015 — and, beyond \r\n2015, to achieve sustainability, address future \r\nchallenges and guarantee a better life for our peoples.  \r\n The League of Arab States attaches great \r\nimportance to the achievement of the MDGs by 2015. \r\nSince the adoption of the Millennium Declaration \r\n(resolution 55/2), the various mechanisms for joint \r\nArab action, such as Arab ministerial councils and \r\nspecialized Arab organizations, have been establishing \r\nstrategies, plans and programmes that effectively \r\ncontribute towards achieving the MDGs on the Arab \r\nregional and national levels. An example of Arab \r\nleaders’ efforts to achieve comprehensive development \r\nin the Arab region was the Arab Summit held in Riyadh \r\nin 2007, which called for a consultative meeting \r\nfocusing specifically on economic and social \r\ndevelopment issues and aiming directly at improving \r\nthe lives of Arab citizens. Accordingly, the League of \r\nArab States, backed by strong political will, carried out \r\nan assessment of the development situation in the Arab \r\nregion, the level of progress in achieving development \r\ngoals, the difficulties that development processes as a \r\nwhole were confronting and various visions and \r\nprogrammes aimed at accelerating the achievement of \r\nthese goals.  \r\nA/65/PV.4  \r\n \r\n10-54115 66 \r\n \r\n The first Arab Economic, Development and \r\nSocial Summit, which was held in Kuwait in January \r\n2009, reaffirmed the commitment of the Arab region to \r\nthe achievement of the MDGs through the Kuwait \r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action, which outlined \r\na complete vision for setting into motion policies and \r\nprogrammes aimed at social integration, reduction of \r\npoverty and unemployment, improving the levels of \r\nhealth care and education, empowering youth, ensuring \r\nsocial equality and empowering women, including \r\nincreased, effective participation by women in \r\neconomic, political and social life and an invigorated \r\nrole for civil society organizations and the private \r\nsector. These programmes focused on the less \r\ndeveloped Arab States because they are most in need of \r\nhelp in achieving the MDGs by 2015. These \r\nprogrammes are now being implemented on the \r\ninternational and Arab regional levels. \r\n In further pursuit of the efforts of the Arab \r\nSummit in these areas, the second Arab development \r\nsummit will be held in the Arab Republic of Egypt on \r\n19 January 2011 in order in anticipation of 2015 to \r\nassess the situation and evaluate our achievements and \r\nthe difficulties we still confront in the light of new \r\ninternational and regional developments and changes. \r\n In preparation for this High-level Plenary \r\nMeeting on the MDGs, the Secretary General of the \r\nLeague of Arab States, through the Council of Arab \r\nSocial Affairs Ministers, which is one of the \r\nspecialized Arab ministerial councils, and in \r\ncoordination with the Economic and Social \r\nCommission for Western Asia, coordinator of the task \r\nforce on the implementation of the MDGs in the Arab \r\nregion, as well as specialized United Nations \r\norganizations and agencies and members of the task \r\nforce, prepared the third Arab regional report on the \r\nMDGs, for 2010, with particular attention to the effects \r\nthat the international economic crisis has had on \r\nachieving the MDGs.  \r\n This report is being submitted to this Meeting as \r\none of several regional reports. It sets out the situation \r\nof the Arab region in terms of achieving the MDGs. It \r\nemphasizes the interdependence of the MDGs, since \r\ninterdependence is a very important aspect of \r\nstrategizing for their attainment, individually and \r\ncollectively. The report discusses Arab States’ varying \r\nlevels of performance in achieving the Goals, \r\nespecially the less developed among them.  \r\n The report also covers the impact of the \r\ninternational economic crisis on the achievement of the \r\nMDGs, especially in the aftermath of the oil crisis, the \r\nfood crisis and the transformation of the world \r\nfinancial crisis into an economic crisis that has \r\nundermined the ability of Arab developing countries to \r\npreserve what they had achieved with such great effort. \r\nThe report also reaffirms the need to intensify efforts \r\naimed at coordination among States of the region and \r\nto find innovative and complementary solutions to \r\nissues such as employment and investment in human \r\ndevelopment, with an emphasis on skill-building and \r\nthe protection of natural resources in the context of \r\naddressing environmental and climate challenges.  \r\n The Arab report also indicates that poverty has \r\nbeen greatly reduced in most Arab States and that, \r\ncompared to other States, Arab States still have lower \r\nlevels of poverty and a medium rate of income \r\ninequality. However, despite that success, fighting \r\nunemployment and ensuring appropriate employment \r\nremain a major challenge, especially since the Arab \r\nregion has one of the highest youth unemployment \r\nrates in the world. The less developed Arab States are \r\nstill far from achieving their poverty reduction goals.  \r\n Despite the great progress achieved on universal \r\nprimary education and on the improvement of \r\nchildren’s health in the region, there are still some \r\nArab States that are confronting these challenges, \r\nwhich are exacerbated by geographic variations within \r\na single State. Quality of education remains a great \r\nchallenge, as do the empowerment of women and \r\nyouth, maternal health and contagious diseases — all \r\nof which require attention because they have such \r\ncrucial importance in combating poverty and achieving \r\nthe other MDGs.  \r\n In general, the Arab region has made tangible \r\nprogress in achieving the MDGs, but it will be difficult \r\nfor the less developed Arab States to achieve the Goals \r\nby the year 2015, especially in the light of the \r\nchallenges that they continue to confront along with \r\nthe Arab region as a whole. Primary among these \r\nchallenges are poverty, unemployment, gender \r\ninequality and the lack of empowerment of women, as \r\nwell as the Israeli occupation and other strategic and \r\nsecurity threats to the Arab world. Those challenges \r\nand threats prevent Arab States from achieving the \r\nMDGs and impel us to address their root causes, \r\nstrengthen our efforts to end them and strive, in \r\npartnership with the international community, to \r\n A/65/PV.4\r\n \r\n67 10-54115 \r\n \r\nfinance development projects in the less developed \r\nArab States within the set time frame to which we are \r\nall committed.  \r\n In conclusion, I express our gratitude to our \r\npartners in international and regional organizations for \r\nthe considerable cooperation that they have provided \r\nand continue to provide, and for their support for the \r\ninitiatives of the League of Arab States. I underscore \r\nthe importance of providing support and assistance to \r\nthe less developed Arab States in order to help them \r\nachieve the MDGs.  \r\n We would also like to stress the vital importance \r\nof continuing to strive towards attaining the MDGs in  \r\nthe Arab region, incorporating those Goals into \r\nnational development strategies and plans and finding \r\nthe necessary funding mechanisms, in partnership with \r\nArab States and Governments, the private sector, civil \r\nsociety organizations and inter-State partnerships. \r\n We also emphasize the significance of the \r\nongoing cooperation among the League of Arab States, \r\nthe United Nations and international partners in \r\npromoting a global partnership to achieve the MDGs \r\nand to ensure peace, security, stability, progress and \r\nprosperity for the peoples of the Arab region and the \r\nentire world. \r\n  The meeting rose at 10.30 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
