(Switzerland) \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 10 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda items 29 and 119 (continued) \r\n \r\nReport of the Security Council (A/65/2) \r\n \r\nQuestion of equitable representation on and increase \r\nin the membership of the Security Council and \r\nrelated matters \r\n \r\n Mr. Khalfallah (Tunisia): At the outset, allow me \r\nto convey to you, Mr. President, my delegation’s \r\nappreciation for including the item pertaining to the \r\nreform of the Security Council on your list of priorities \r\nduring the current session of the General Assembly. \r\nRest assured that my delegation will spare no effort to \r\nhelp move forward any action aimed at securing a \r\npositive outcome to that process. Tunisia also aligns \r\nitself with the statements made yesterday on behalf of \r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement and the African Group. \r\n First of all, with regard to the report of the \r\nSecurity Council (A/65/2), I would like to thank His \r\nExcellency the Permanent Representative of the United \r\nKingdom and Northern Ireland for presenting this \r\nyear’s Council report. For the majority of Member \r\nStates, in particular those that are not members of the \r\nCouncil, the review of that document by the General \r\nAssembly is the only occasion to assess the Council’s \r\nactivities in depth and to identify measures worth \r\ntaking to improve its methods of work. \r\n My delegation is of the view that there are indeed \r\nimprovements that could be agreed upon regarding the \r\npreparation of the report and that it is high time we \r\ngave up the practice of establishing a compilation of \r\nadopted decisions and resolutions, along with the \r\nrather factual description of the Council’s work. That \r\nwill undoubtedly move us closer to the \r\nrecommendations made by Member States in favour of \r\na more analytical report. In the same vein, the General \r\nAssembly still expects to see special thematic reports, \r\nto be submitted to it periodically by the Security \r\nCouncil, mainly on issues of international interest. \r\n My delegation recognizes the sizeable workload \r\nundertaken by the Security Council during the period \r\nof time covered by the report, particularly as regards \r\nregions facing tensions and instability, whether in \r\nAfrica or in other parts of the world. We also take note \r\nof the field visits by members of the Security Council, \r\nwhich give them a first-hand assessment of situations \r\nthat affect international peace and security and need \r\nurgent action by the Council. The report clearly shows \r\nthat the Council acted with determination in dealing \r\nwith a large number of conflicts around the world. That \r\nwill certainly confirm the Council’s authority in \r\nmaintaining international peace and security. \r\n However, the Council’s efforts continue to fall \r\nshort of our expectations when it comes to the situation \r\nin the Middle East. The frustration caused by the \r\ninability of the Council to get further involved in \r\nsolving the Palestinian issue and honouring its \r\nresponsibility in that regard does not help to remove \r\nthat threat, which looms over the region and damages \r\nthe authority of the Council itself. \r\nA/65/PV.50  \r\n \r\n10-63473 2 \r\n \r\n We are convinced that there remains a long way \r\nto go to make the Council’s work more transparent, \r\nwhich would ensure all delegations a wider access to \r\ninformation, particularly those delegations that have \r\nnational items inscribed on the Council’s agenda. \r\n With regard to the reform of the Security \r\nCouncil, my delegation commends the new stage in the \r\nprocess of intergovernmental negotiations based on \r\nMember States’ proposals, which is organized in an \r\nopen, inclusive and transparent manner and the aim of \r\nwhich is to identify an outcome that enjoys the widest \r\npolitical agreement among Member States. I would like \r\nto express my delegation’s appreciation and thanks to \r\nHis Excellency the Permanent Representative of \r\nAfghanistan for so ably conducting the negotiations \r\nand for the documents that he and his team have \r\nsubmitted to us. \r\n My delegation believes that the Council must \r\nreflect the political and economic reality of today’s \r\nworld. The Council must be equipped with the \r\nnecessary legitimacy in order to act on behalf of the \r\ninternational community as a whole, while fulfilling its \r\nmandate in conformity with the United Nations \r\nCharter. Also, my delegation believes that the final aim \r\nof any reform should be to strengthen equitable \r\nrepresentation within the Council, and, hence, its \r\ncredibility and efficiency. Those objectives can only be \r\nachieved through the Council’s enlargement, notably, \r\nin favour of developing countries. \r\n In that context, Tunisia firmly supports the \r\nAfrican Union’s common position, as expressed in the \r\nEzulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration. We are \r\nconvinced that it is high time for the current situation \r\nto be corrected, as the African continent has been \r\nprevented from occupying a well-deserved seat in the \r\nCouncil. We will support any proposal that gives \r\ndeveloping countries, particularly from Africa, the \r\nplace in the Security Council that is theirs. \r\n In conclusion, we believe that for the Security \r\nCouncil to continue enjoying the trust of all Member \r\nStates and world public opinion, it has to demonstrate \r\nits efficiency in tackling the most difficult issues and \r\nhas, equally, to become more representative of the \r\ninternational community. \r\n Mr. Kit (Malaysia): Allow me at the outset to \r\nalign my delegation with the statement made by the \r\nrepresentative of Egypt on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement, of which Malaysia is a member. \r\n Malaysia takes this opportunity to extend its \r\nappreciation to the Security Council for convening a \r\nspecial meeting of the Council simply to discuss, and \r\nsubsequently adopt, the draft report of the Council to \r\nthe General Assembly, which we now have before us as \r\ndocument A/65/2. We note, however, that the number \r\nof meetings that the Security Council held in this past \r\nreporting period has decreased to 191 meetings from \r\n228 meetings in the previous year, and that compared \r\nto the 205 public meetings in the previous year, only \r\n168 meetings were open this past year to non-Council \r\nmembers. In terms of statistics, that represents a 2 per \r\ncent drop in the ratio of public meetings to total \r\nmeetings held by the Council, meaning that, this past \r\nyear, the Council held more closed meetings than it did \r\nin the previous year. \r\n As we well know, the Council will take decisions \r\nregardless of whether an open meeting or a closed \r\nmeeting has been held. However, for those Member \r\nStates who are not on the Council, an open debate \r\nallows our views also to be aired and heard and \r\nhopefully taken into account in the decision-making \r\nprocess that follows. Thus, for the sake of \r\ninclusiveness, if not transparency, more public \r\nmeetings should be held by the 15-member Council. \r\n Malaysia would also like to express its \r\nappreciation to the past presidencies for the Council \r\nthat have held briefings for interested Member States \r\non the programme of work of the Council. Those \r\nbriefings have been insightful and very much \r\nwelcomed, as they allow other Member States the \r\nopportunity to obtain clarification regarding the \r\npreoccupations of the Council for that particular \r\nmonth. We hope that such briefings will be a \r\npermanent fixture in the working methods of the \r\nCouncil, rather than just a practice carried out at the \r\ndiscretion of the President of the Council. \r\n On 22 April 2010, under the presidency of Japan, \r\nthe Security Council held an open debate on the \r\nimplementation of the note by the President of the \r\nSecurity Council contained in document S/2006/507, in \r\nwhich Malaysia participated (see S/PV.6300). We \r\nrequested then that the transcripts of the closed-door \r\nbriefings by the Special Representatives of the \r\nSecretary-General to the Council be made available to \r\nMember States in the interest of disseminating \r\ninformation. Today, we renew that call, and hope that, \r\nin time, the briefings by the Secretariat to the Council \r\nwill become more transparent to Member States \r\n A/65/PV.50\r\n \r\n3 10-63473 \r\n \r\noutside the Council. After all, Article 24 empowers the \r\nCouncil to act on Member States’ behalf, and it \r\nlogically follows therefore that the principal actors for \r\nwhom the agent acts must be kept within the \r\ninformation loop. \r\n Malaysia remembers a time when the Secretariat \r\nprovided daily briefings to Council members to update \r\nthe Council on what was happening around the world \r\nin terms of international peace and security. We \r\nunderstand that that practice has now been largely \r\ndiscontinued. Even though the advent of information \r\ntechnology means that members of the Council can \r\neasily find out for themselves what the threats to \r\ninternational peace and security of the day are, alerts \r\nprovided by the Secretariat could still prove to be \r\ninvaluable in drawing the attention of the Council to \r\npotential problem hotspots. Therefore, Malaysia would \r\nsuggest that the morning briefings and the discussions \r\nthat used to follow them be reinstated. \r\n When Member States agreed, at the end of the \r\nsixty-second session of the General Assembly, to \r\nestablish intergovernmental negotiations on Security \r\nCouncil reform, Malaysia was one of the countries that \r\nrejoiced about this progressive step forward. The \r\ndiscussions and deliberations on Security Council \r\nreform were moved a step up, from the Open-ended \r\nWorking Group on the Question of Equitable \r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of \r\nthe Security Council and Other Matters Related to the \r\nSecurity Council to the informal plenary of the General \r\nAssembly. It seemed, at the time, that we were getting \r\nsomewhere in the 14-year discourse. \r\n Today, after two years of negotiating in the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations, we seem to have \r\nreached an impasse. We thank the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, His Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss, \r\nfor his initiative in convening an informal meeting of \r\nthe General Assembly to discuss the way forward in \r\nthe negotiations on Security Council reform. We also \r\nthank Ambassador Zahir Tanin for keeping at the \r\nprocess, displaying infinite patience with the way the \r\nprocess has been moving and maintaining a certain \r\nlevel of calmness even under the most intense of \r\npressures. \r\n This past year, Member States have been \r\ninvolved in discussing the composite text, which is \r\nessentially a compilation of all the various viewpoints \r\nregarding Security Council enlargement and \r\nmodalities. We have not been negotiating the text, we \r\nhave simply been reiterating the same positions over \r\nand over again. This is the United Nations, where \r\nresolutions are negotiated all the time. Why should the \r\nreform of the Council be any different from the normal \r\nnegotiation process, where elimination and \r\ncompromise are key? The United Nations Charter is a \r\nman-made document. We should therefore be able to \r\ncome to an agreement to change it for the better when \r\nit threatens to make the Organization irrelevant and \r\nexpendable. \r\n Enough is enough. We need to stop this game of \r\nrhetoric that we have been drawn into in negotiating \r\nthe question of equitable geographical representation \r\non and increase in the membership of the Security \r\nCouncil. The last time that we enlarged the Security \r\nCouncil, in 1965, there were 117 members of the \r\nUnited Nations. Today, we are looking at a family of \r\n192, representing a 64 per cent increase in the total \r\nmembership from 45 years ago, and yet the Security \r\nCouncil has not undergone the same transformation as \r\nthe General Assembly. \r\n The African continent, which counts 53 nations \r\nwithin its regional grouping, remains unrepresented \r\nwithin the permanent membership of the Security \r\nCouncil. The United Nations was meant to correct \r\ninjustice, not propagate it. If that is so, then the steps \r\ntowards ensuring justice must begin at home, here at \r\nUnited Nations Headquarters, by enlarging the Council \r\nto reflect the realities of the day, rather than the glory \r\nof history. Democracy must begin with us, which \r\nmeans that no nation should be able to gainsay the \r\nexpress will of the majority. There should be a practice \r\nof one country, one vote, the way democracy was \r\nmeant to be. \r\n As we turn the page into the second decade of \r\nthis new millennium, we need to display more political \r\nwill and strength to ensure that the United Nations can \r\nchange with the times. We need to be more proactive, \r\nand we need to be more inclusive. My delegation \r\nremains committed to following any road that will lead \r\nus to progress in this fight for equality and justice. We \r\nknow we are not alone in this endeavour. \r\n Ms. Nyamudeza (Zimbabwe): We welcome the \r\nopportunity to participate in this joint debate. My \r\ndelegation aligns itself with the statements made by \r\nSierra Leone on behalf of the African Group and of the \r\nA/65/PV.50  \r\n \r\n10-63473 4 \r\n \r\nrepresentatives of Egypt on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement. \r\n In the recent past, the Security Council has \r\nwitnessed a substantial increase in the range of issues \r\nbrought before it for its consideration. My delegation \r\nwelcomes the role of the Council in the resolution of \r\nconflicts in the world, particularly in Africa. In that \r\nregard, we support the efforts of the Council to \r\nenhance its partnership with the African Union. \r\nRegional organizations, including the African Union, \r\nare increasingly becoming essential building blocks in \r\nglobal security systems. We share the view that \r\nregional organizations are better placed to deal with \r\npeace and security challenges in their respective \r\nregions and should therefore be supported and not \r\nundermined. That should be translated into practice and \r\nnot simply remain easy prose. \r\n The Charter of the United Nations places a \r\nsignificant responsibility on the Security Council for \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security. \r\nThat responsibility gives the Council a far-reaching \r\nimpact on the lives of many people all over the world. \r\nThe ability of the Council to act fairly, effectively and \r\nresponsibly will provide important reassurance for the \r\ninternational community that its concerns in the area of \r\npeace and security are being adequately addressed. We \r\nshare the view that the Council needs to ensure that its \r\ndecisions largely reflect the concerns and aspirations of \r\nthe general membership. In that regard, we call for \r\ndemocratization of the existing order, increased \r\ntransparency in action and the co-option of different \r\nideas, interests and sensitivities. \r\n My delegation views with concern the tendency \r\nof the Council to make decisions on issues that \r\nimpinge on the wider membership of the United \r\nNations without taking into account the views of the \r\nStates concerned. In that regard, we are also concerned \r\nabout the Council’s increased resort to Chapter VII \r\nresolutions and enforcement actions, even on matters \r\nthat are better resolved through multilateral \r\ncooperation. We call on the Council to ensure adequate \r\nopportunity for the views of the wider membership to \r\nbe heard. While we welcome the Council’s efforts to \r\nimprove its openness to non-members of the Council, \r\nwe urge it to increase transparency and \r\ncommunication. We reiterate that true effectiveness on \r\nthe part of the Council, as well as respect for its \r\ndecisions, can be achieved only if the larger \r\nmembership believes that body represents their \r\ninterests. Attempts by some to recover lost imperial \r\nglory through abuse of the Council are repugnant to \r\nmany Members. \r\n The overwhelming majority of Member States \r\nhave expressed their clear preference for \r\ncomprehensive reform of the Security Council. That \r\nthe Council as it is does not represent the current \r\nrealities of the twenty-first century is no longer \r\ndebatable. This debate therefore offers us a timely \r\nopportunity not only to take stock of and monitor our \r\nprogress, but also to state and exchange viewpoints that \r\nmay well facilitate greater understanding of various \r\npositions in our collective efforts to move the process \r\nof reforming the Security Council forward. \r\nZimbabwe’s position is guided by the common African \r\nposition laid out in the Ezulwini Consensus. \r\n My delegation is greatly encouraged by the \r\ngrowing acceptance of and agreement on the need for \r\nexpansion of both the permanent and the non-\r\npermanent categories of the Council’s membership. An \r\nexpanded Council will enjoy fresh perspectives in its \r\ndeliberations and broader alliances in its decision-\r\nmaking, which is, after all, the purpose of our \r\nexercise — to make the Council more representative, \r\nlegitimate and credible. Going forward, Zimbabwe is \r\nof the view that expanding both categories is essential \r\nin order to meet the needs and accommodate the views \r\nof the majority of Member States. It is also essential to \r\nmaintain a balanced ratio between the two categories of \r\nthe Council’s membership. \r\n In that connection, Zimbabwe, like many other \r\nMember States, has consistently advocated for \r\ncomprehensive reform of the Security Council. We \r\nhave underscored time and again the need for the \r\nCouncil to reflect current political realities, with \r\nspecial emphasis on granting developing countries, \r\nparticularly those on the African continent, their long \r\noverdue and deserved representation in both \r\nmembership categories of the Council. In that regard, I \r\nwish to reiterate my country’s support for Africa’s \r\ncontinuing demand for two permanent seats on an \r\nexpanded Council, with the same powers and \r\nprerogatives as those of current members, and five \r\nnon-permanent seats. We feel those are reasonable \r\ndemands, based on the principle of democratic \r\nrepresentation allotted proportionally among the \r\nregions. Such an arrangement would also go some way \r\ntowards redressing the historic abuse to which Africa \r\nhas been subjected. \r\n A/65/PV.50\r\n \r\n5 10-63473 \r\n \r\n It is our firm view that reform of the United \r\nNations without Security Council reform is incomplete. \r\nReforming only the Council’s working methods is also \r\nnot enough, and structural reforms are therefore needed \r\nto complete the process. A less skewed and more \r\nbalanced structure of the Council, coupled with more \r\ndemocratic global governance institutions, is what the \r\ninternational community needs to be able to deliver in \r\nthe important areas of security, economic and social \r\ndevelopment. \r\n It is important that the interests of all countries \r\nand regions related to that sensitive issue be seriously \r\ntaken into account. In that regard, transparency and \r\nconsensus must be the guideposts for our mutual trust \r\nand confidence with regard to the issue. For its part, \r\nZimbabwe is ready to work with other Members in \r\norder to achieve comprehensive reform of the Security \r\nCouncil. \r\n Ms. Shoman (Jordan): Jordan associates itself \r\nwith the statements of the group of five small nations \r\nand the Non-Aligned Movement. We reaffirm the \r\nimportance of interactive dialogue between the \r\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly, and hope \r\nthat this year will pave the way for fruitful discussions \r\npromoting a mandate of Security Council reform, \r\nparticularly with regard to wider membership in the \r\nCouncil. \r\n Jordan attaches great importance to Council \r\nreform and believes that a comprehensive, transparent, \r\ninclusive, balanced mechanism can meet and reflect the \r\nneeds of United Nations Members, especially \r\ndeveloping countries, and would render transparent an \r\nimportant part of the international architecture. \r\n The Council has made noteworthy commitments \r\nand begun to put them into action in order to maintain \r\ninternational peace and security in the most effective \r\nmanner possible and in cooperation with its partners. \r\nThat can be seen in the numerous statements that have \r\nbeen made on the Security Council’s report (A/65/2). \r\nIn that regard, Jordan would like to thank the current \r\npresidency of the Council and to commend the \r\nimprovements proposed by the United Kingdom, which \r\nhave brought deeper understanding to the discussion \r\nand made it more of an exchange of views. \r\n Jordan supports transparent and full discussions \r\nbetween the Security Council and troop-contributing \r\ncountries during preparation of the Council’s annual \r\nreport, and stresses the importance of \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. We also call on the \r\nCouncil to prioritize and strengthen consultations and \r\ndialogue with those countries as part of its efforts to \r\nachieve peace, stability and security. \r\n Mr. Bodini (San Marino): I would like to thank \r\nthe Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom, \r\nAmbassador Sir Mark Lyall Grant, for his introduction \r\nto the report of the Security Council (A/65/2), and the \r\nNigerian mission for its work in preparing the \r\ndocument. \r\n I share your opinion, Mr. President, that we have \r\nreached a point where we must accelerate the process \r\nof reforming the Security Council. It is time to \r\nreconcile our differences. Under the leadership of the \r\nPresident and Ambassador Tanin, we must relaunch the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations, whose outcome must \r\nbe reached through consensus or quasi-consensus in \r\norder to be successful. Security Council reform arrived \r\nat by a fractured General Assembly would be doomed \r\nfrom its inception. It would not have the legitimacy \r\nthat our countries are looking for. I agree with many of \r\nour colleagues that the only possible solution is one of \r\na compromise that can form the greatest common \r\ndenominator among our aspirations. \r\n To reach such a goal, we must agree on interim \r\nreform. Such reform would provide for a reasonable \r\nenlargement of the Council, in which half of the new \r\nseats would be allocated to the two-year non-\r\npermanent category, and half to a new, longer-term \r\nnon-permanent category. In that way we could give \r\ngreater representation to small and medium-sized \r\nStates, as well as to countries that are significant \r\ncontributors to world peace through financial aid, \r\ndemocratic leadership, growing economies and \r\npeacekeeping forces. Those countries rightfully \r\ndeserve to represent us for longer periods in the \r\nCouncil. They would be elected by the General \r\nAssembly and could seek re-election at the end of their \r\nterms. \r\n I believe that the States that would like to run for \r\nthe longer term could, if elected, greatly enhance the \r\nwork of the Security Council. I have no doubt that we \r\nwill re-elect those countries that contribute effectively \r\nduring their tenures to the peace process. \r\n With that kind of reform, we will obtain a \r\nsubstantial enlargement, we will have a more \r\ndemocratic and representative Security Council, we \r\nwill create more transparency, we will enhance the \r\nA/65/PV.50  \r\n \r\n10-63473 6 \r\n \r\nCouncil’s relationship with the General Assembly and \r\nwe will obtain a more equitable representation among \r\ndifferent geographical areas. \r\n Finally, we must move on from the inexcusable \r\n15-year impasse that underlines our inability to reform \r\nour Security Council. \r\n Mr. Borg (Malta): The report of the Security \r\nCouncil for the past 12 months (A/65/2), which we are \r\nconsidering today, indicates in no uncertain terms the \r\ndiverse and complex issues and situations as well as \r\nthe challenges that our Organization is facing. The \r\nreport also shows that much more has to be done in \r\norder to alleviate the often dire situations faced by the \r\npopulations in those countries where conflicts seem to \r\nperpetuate the already unacceptable living conditions, \r\ntension and turmoil compounded by hunger, \r\nmalnutrition and disease. Indeed, it is a recognized fact \r\nthat those conditions and situations are not only \r\nobstructing the economic and social development of \r\nthose countries, but also continue to displace large \r\npopulations and increase poverty, refugees and political \r\ninstability. \r\n Compared to the same period last year, the report \r\nshows that the Security Council has held fewer formal \r\nmeetings, fewer public meetings, fewer consultations \r\nand adopted fewer presidential statements, while \r\nissuing more statements to the press. Moreover, the \r\nSecurity Council adopted fewer resolutions than the \r\nyear before. Whether all those actions reflect on the \r\nreal urgency with which the Security Council \r\nattempted to deal effectively with the growing \r\npreoccupations of the international community with \r\nregard to the various situations that are still unresolved \r\nin Africa, the Middle East, Asia, Europe and Central \r\nAmerica is a matter that perhaps raises some concern \r\namong the United Nations Member States and \r\ntherefore requires further in-depth analysis and \r\nexamination. \r\n My delegation notes that, again this year, no \r\nfewer than 12 countries in Africa have been the focus \r\nof attention of and action by the Security Council. \r\nTwenty-five resolutions were adopted and 12 \r\npresidential statements prepared and/or issued, all \r\nrelating to Africa. My delegation believes that a more \r\nconcerted effort and enhanced action should be \r\nundertaken by the Security Council in addressing the \r\nconflicts and situations that still exist in those \r\ncountries. In that regard, it is important that the \r\nSecurity Council continues to be assisted by all \r\nGovernments and parties concerned in order to ensure \r\nthat the action taken by the Security Council finds a \r\npositive response on the ground. \r\n The role of regional organizations in Africa and \r\nespecially the enhancement of the strategic partnership \r\nbetween the United Nations and the African Union are \r\nto be commended and supported. \r\n Among the important activities undertaken by the \r\nSecurity Council that my delegation wishes to \r\nhighlight are those relating to the missions carried out \r\nby the members of the Council to conflict areas, which \r\nhave provided its members as well as the Governments \r\nof the countries concerned the opportunity to interact \r\nand possibly helped generate the political backing for \r\nimportant decisions by all interlocutors. In that regard, \r\nwe believe that the members of the Security Council \r\nshould review the scope and reach of those missions so \r\nthat visits to other places of conflict could be \r\nundertaken, especially in those situations of which the \r\nUnited Nations Security Council has been seized for \r\nmany years and where no end to such conflicts is in \r\nsight. \r\n One of the issues where the Security Council has \r\nmade a contribution relates to the situation in the \r\nMiddle East, including the Palestinian question. The \r\nfact that the Security Council considers the issue on a \r\nmonthly basis shows in itself that the international \r\ncommunity has still not found the much sought after \r\nsolution. Despite the unstinting efforts of the United \r\nNations Secretary-General and the Quartet, a renewed \r\neffort and a reinvigorated approach is required in the \r\nsearch for a political and durable solution to the \r\nquestion of Palestine and the Middle East conflict. In \r\nthat regard, Security Council members must continue \r\nto enhance their role and their valid contribution by \r\nassisting both the Israelis and the Palestinians, \r\nespecially at a time when direct negotiations, which \r\nhad ushered in new hopes and expectations some \r\nweeks ago, are being severely tested daily, if not \r\nthreatened. My delegation believes that the Security \r\nCouncil has a primordial role in the Middle East \r\nprocess and can and should contribute to a resolution \r\nof the question and bring peace and security to a \r\nregion, which for over 60 years has been a theatre of \r\nconflict, tensions and upheavals. It is important that the \r\nSecurity Council, backed by this General Assembly, \r\nstrengthen its endeavours to resume the peace \r\nnegotiations, which would lead to an independent, \r\n A/65/PV.50\r\n \r\n7 10-63473 \r\n \r\ndemocratic, contiguous and viable Palestinian State \r\nliving side by side in peace and security with Israel. \r\n Another activity referred to in the report and \r\nwhich my delegation would like to endorse is the \r\nholding of meetings of the Council on thematic, \r\ngeneral and other issues focusing on the maintenance \r\nof international peace and security, as well as the \r\nbriefings by the Chairmen of subsidiary bodies of the \r\nSecurity Council. Malta believes that the participation \r\nof the United Nations Member States in those open \r\ndebates enhances transparency and universality in the \r\naccess and involvement on the part of all Member \r\nStates in the consideration of important issues relating \r\nto the maintenance of international peace and security. \r\n My delegation also welcomes the consideration \r\nby the Security Council of cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and regional and subregional \r\norganizations in the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security. In that regard, we welcome the Council’s \r\nexpression of its intention to consider further steps to \r\npromote closer and more operational cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and those organizations in \r\nthe fields of conflict early warning, prevention, \r\npeacemaking, peacekeeping and peacebuilding with a \r\nview to ensuring coherence, synergy and collective \r\neffectiveness in their efforts. \r\n Malta, as a member of the European Union and of \r\nthe United Nations, notes with satisfaction the \r\nparticipation of the High Representative for Foreign \r\nAffairs and Security Policy of the European Union, \r\nMs. Catherine Ashton, who briefed the Council on the \r\ncommitment of the European Union to the active \r\npromotion of peace, security, justice and human rights, \r\nas well as to the protection of the vulnerable and \r\nhelping people to live in safety and dignity. Indeed, the \r\nTreaty of Lisbon has enhanced the collaboration \r\nbetween the European Union and the Security Council \r\nand United Nations membership as a whole, as stated \r\nin the report. \r\n The Security Council endorsed the European \r\nUnion’s support for the efforts of the United Nations in \r\nmaintaining international peace and security, since the \r\ntwo organizations shared common goals and principles, \r\nsuch as the promotion of human rights, the rule of law \r\nand development. My delegation welcomed the \r\nopportunity to participate in the open debate held last \r\nApril on the working methods of the Security Council \r\n(see S/PV.6300). It is a recognized fact that the issues \r\nbefore the Council are not the sole responsibility of \r\nCouncil members and that the increasing threats of \r\ntoday are becoming more global and transnational in \r\nnature. No boundaries exist for such threats. Hence, the \r\nmatters that are brought to the attention of the Council \r\nare matters that call for greater involvement and \r\nengagement by and with the non-members of the \r\nCouncil. \r\n While much more has to be done to reach an \r\noptimum level of transparency, Malta believes that the \r\nmonthly briefings by the new Council Presidents on the \r\nprogramme of work, as well as the increase in detail of \r\nthe Council’s annual report presented to the General \r\nAssembly, have enhanced the relationship between the \r\nmembers of the Council and the wider United Nations \r\nmembership. \r\n Malta encourages Council members to continue \r\nexploring ways to improve the Council’s working \r\nmethods by ensuring enhanced transparency, \r\neffectiveness and interaction with non-members. It is \r\nimportant that all Member States not only feel that they \r\nown the United Nations reform process, including that \r\nof the Security Council, but also continue to assume \r\nthe guardianship of the Organization, of which the \r\nSecurity Council is one of the principal organs. \r\n Malta actively and consistently participates in the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on the reform of the \r\nSecurity Council. Throughout that process Malta has \r\nprojected, in an objective and transparent manner, the \r\nviews and aspirations of a small State as a Member of \r\nthe United Nations. \r\n It is the view of my delegation that any \r\nagreements reached in the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations must form part of a whole package for a \r\nsound, sustainable and long-term reform of the \r\nSecurity Council, in particular with the underlying \r\nprinciple that all five key issues identified in decision \r\n62/557 are inextricably linked and must be considered \r\nas forming part of one package. Any consideration of \r\nany one of those issues must ensure a coherent and \r\ncohesive progression on the other key issues. \r\n My delegation wishes to reiterate its strong \r\nsupport for the Uniting for Consensus group platform, \r\nwhich provides for regular non-permanent seats, \r\nincluding for small and medium-sized States, as well as \r\nlonger-term seats. That represents a step forward and a \r\nmajor compromise from the group’s original 2005 \r\nposition. \r\nA/65/PV.50  \r\n \r\n10-63473 8 \r\n \r\n The Uniting for Consensus platform is the only \r\nproposal on the table so far which would fulfil the \r\naspirations of small States with a population below one \r\nmillion by specifically proposing one non-permanent \r\nseat to be allocated to small States in an enlarged \r\nSecurity Council. That, in the view of my delegation, \r\nwould represent justice for over 40 small Member \r\nStates that are calling for a better response and full \r\nrecognition of their legitimate stand in the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. \r\n We therefore feel that that proposal should be \r\nendorsed by all small States participating in the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations so as not to continue \r\nbeing marginalized or ignored, as well as to secure \r\nbetter opportunities in their legitimate right to serve on \r\nthe Security Council, irrespective of their geographic \r\nlocation or their level of development. \r\n Malta hopes that other groups and countries will \r\nbe able to show the same spirit of flexibility and to \r\ncome forward with positions that can bridge differing \r\nviews. We should all embark on a process that should \r\nbe conducted in an open, transparent and inclusive \r\nmanner and that would lead towards a solution that \r\ncould garner the widest possible acceptance of Member \r\nStates. \r\n For a number of reasons my delegation continues \r\nto have difficulty with the arguments put forward for \r\nexpanding both the permanent and non-permanent \r\ncategories of membership in the Security Council. My \r\ndelegation also disagrees with the claims by a number \r\nof delegations that the expansion in both categories \r\nenjoys the support of a so-called majority of the \r\nmembership. \r\n This is a process led by Member States and \r\nbelongs to Member States, and therefore Malta \r\nreiterates its conviction that the General Assembly, as \r\nthe principal United Nations organ with universal \r\nmembership, is the only legitimate and appropriate \r\nforum to discuss and decide upon the reform of the \r\nSecurity Council. \r\n My delegation looks forward to receiving a \r\nprogramme of work on how and when the forthcoming \r\nnegotiations will be held. We wish to convey our \r\nsupport and cooperation to you, Mr. President, and to \r\nAmbassador Zahir Tanin, for a successful continuation \r\nof our negotiations. \r\n Mr. Elshareef (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): My \r\ndelegation has carefully studied the report of the \r\nSecurity Council before us today (A/65/2) under items \r\n29 and 119, “Report of the Security Council” and \r\n“Question of equitable representation on and increase \r\nin the membership of the Security Council and related \r\nmatters”. \r\n My delegation associates itself with the \r\nstatements delivered at the 48th meeting by the \r\nrepresentative of Sierra Leone on behalf of the African \r\nGroup, and by the representative of Egypt on behalf of \r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). \r\n My country wishes to reiterate Africa’s \r\nestablished position for the allocation of two \r\npermanent seats and five non-permanent seats on the \r\nSecurity Council to Africa, based on the importance of \r\nthe continent, which has 53 Member States. \r\n We wish to express our appreciation for your \r\nefforts, Mr. President, in giving this item the \r\nimportance it deserves by including it on the agenda of \r\nthe current session. We also wish to commend the \r\nefforts of your predecessor, Mr. Treki, who made \r\nconsiderable contributions in the area of Security \r\nCouncil reform. \r\n Regarding the working methods of the Security \r\nCouncil and its decision-making process, we join the \r\nposition expressed by the NAM, which calls for a more \r\ndemocratic and transparent approach and for the \r\ninvolvement of all Member States, especially those \r\nwhose issues are under consideration, so that the \r\nprocess may become more objective and just. \r\n In that respect, my delegation calls for the \r\nabolition of the right of the veto, which, in our view, \r\nruns contrary to the noble principles and purposes of \r\nthe United Nations, which seek equality among States \r\nand respect for sovereignty. \r\n My delegation believes that the Security Council \r\nshould give more importance to cooperation with the \r\nGeneral Assembly, which is the most inclusive and \r\nrepresentative body of the United Nations. The Council \r\nshould consult with the Assembly and take into \r\nconsideration its views regarding its treatment of the \r\ninternational issues that are under consideration. \r\n A/65/PV.50\r\n \r\n9 10-63473 \r\n \r\n We also believe that it is important that the \r\nSecurity Council should not take decisions regarding \r\nissues that do not pose any threat to international peace \r\nand security as defined in Chapter VII of the Charter. \r\n My delegation considers it important that the \r\nSecurity Council cooperate with all Member States in a \r\nmanner that guarantees their rights, in keeping with the \r\nprovisions of the Charter, rather than favouring entities \r\nthat do not enjoy membership in this international \r\nOrganization, at times even being equated with \r\nMember States, which is a flagrant violation of the \r\nCharter. \r\n In conclusion, my delegation wishes to state that \r\nreform of the Security Council is one of the most vital \r\nissues for our international Organization, and it is \r\nindeed high time that its membership be increased and \r\nits working methods and decision-making processes be \r\nimproved, so that the Council truly reflects and \r\nexpresses the positions of all Members of the United \r\nNations, instead of being exploited, as it sometimes is, \r\nby the major Powers to promote their own political \r\nagendas at the expense of the developing nations. \r\n Ms. Kok Li Peng (Singapore): Mу delegation \r\njoins the debate today slightly encouraged by what we \r\nhave seen in the latest annual report of the Security \r\nCouncil (A/65/2). It provides a good overview of the \r\nscope and volume of issues tackled by the Council this \r\npast year and a few other improvements, in particular \r\nthe incorporation of material that reflects the substance \r\nof the Council’s work. As a member of the group of \r\nfive small nations (S-5), Singapore also appreciates the \r\naddition of a section on working methods under \r\nthematic considerations, as opposed to parking the \r\nissue under the “Other matters” section as in previous \r\nreports. We hope that arrangement will hold for future \r\nreports. \r\n We applaud the Council’s evolving practice of \r\nconsulting Member States before the drafting of its \r\nreport, which was introduced by Viet Nam, \r\nsubsequently adopted by Uganda and continued by \r\nNigeria. Such best practices inspire confidence in the \r\nCouncil and build trust between the Council and the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n The next logical step in that process would be for \r\nthe author of the annual report to hold an informal \r\nsession with Member States once the report has been \r\ncompleted to discuss, inter alia, issues, challenges and \r\nquestions that came up in the preparation of the report. \r\nAs Singapore has said before, the intention is not to \r\nfind fault, but to let Member States gain a deeper \r\nunderstanding of the workings of the Council and to \r\nengender buy-in for the Council’s actions. \r\n More interaction between the Council and the \r\nMember States can also help to clarify the type of \r\nanalysis that Member States have repeatedly called for \r\nin each year’s report. Given the tremendous level of \r\nresources channelled to the Council, whether by fiat or \r\nby choice, there is insufficient reciprocity by its \r\nmembers in terms of transparency and effectiveness. It \r\nis not enough for the Council presidency of each month \r\nto share its reflections on the year’s efforts. Concrete \r\nprocedures must be installed for the Council to account \r\nfor its discharge of the solemn responsibilities \r\nentrusted to it under the Charter. \r\n As Singapore believes that interaction promotes \r\neffectiveness in Council work, we would like to \r\ncommend the efforts of the United Kingdom to \r\npromote forward-looking and interactive discussions in \r\nthe Council, such as its horizon-scanning event with \r\nthe Department of Political Affairs. The regular \r\nmonthly open debates are also valuable opportunities \r\nfor candid discussions between Council members and \r\nMember States. \r\n However, we should be mindful of the particular \r\ncharacter of Council work, which is crisis-plagued and \r\nbound by strict deadlines. To have really useful \r\nexchanges, we can do no better than to heed George \r\nWashington, who said: “Let your discourse with men \r\nof business be short and comprehensive.” Hence, we \r\nshould set aside beloved but lengthy rituals of prepared \r\nspeeches and establish proceedings favouring greater \r\nspontaneity and interactivity, because genuine \r\ndiscussions of good quality can enrich the Council’s \r\ndeliberations and outcomes. \r\n On the broader issue of the Council’s working \r\nmethods, we have seen some progress in recent years, \r\nthough clearly more can be done. For instance, \r\nSingapore, along with others of the S-5, was pleased to \r\nsee the recent updating of presidential note 507 \r\n(S/2010/507). However, we remain concerned about \r\nthe lack of a follow-up implementation mechanism. We \r\nwould like to reiterate the suggestions outlined in the \r\nearlier statement by the S-5 on improving the \r\ncomprehensiveness and implementation of presidential \r\nnote 507 (see A/65/PV.48). It would also be helpful to \r\nexpand the annual report’s section on note 507 to \r\nA/65/PV.50  \r\n \r\n10-63473 10 \r\n \r\ninclude some assessment of progress on its \r\nimplementation. \r\n I recall my delegation lamenting in 2008 that we \r\nwere dancing around the same spot on Council reform. \r\nFortunately, there has been a little progress since then. \r\nWe will soon embark on the sixth round of \r\nintergovernmental negotiations, with a compilation text \r\nin hand. However, little headway has been made in \r\nstreamlining the text, let alone embarking on \r\nsubstantive text-based negotiations. As we resume the \r\nnegotiations, we hope that Member States will \r\ndemonstrate greater willingness to find common \r\nground. In that connection, we offer our full support to \r\nAmbassador Zahir Tanin in his continued facilitation of \r\nthat process. \r\n The election of India, Germany and South Africa \r\nhas generated great anticipation about how the Council \r\nwill perform next year. Many of us will be looking to \r\nsee how the Council acts to bring about greater \r\nefficiency in the way it works, how it will further \r\nenhance its interactions with Member States and how it \r\nwill discharge its Charter responsibilities. Some \r\noptimistic delegations also harbour hope for the \r\nstalemate on Council reform to be eased. What is \r\nimportant, both in terms of efforts to improve the \r\nCouncil’s effectiveness and Member States’ efforts in \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations, is to nurse the \r\nmomentum so painstakingly generated and find the \r\npolitical will to take the reforms forward. To \r\nparaphrase the words of a wise man, Мahatmа Gandhi, \r\nwe should be the change that we want to see in the \r\nworld. \r\n Mr. Park In-Kook (Republic of Korea): Thank \r\nyou, Mr. President, for convening this joint debate. I \r\nwould like to take this opportunity to reiterate my \r\ndelegation’s firm conviction that your presidency will \r\nbe successful. \r\n I would like to thank the current President of the \r\nSecurity Council, His Excellency Ambassador Lyall \r\nGrant of the United Kingdom, for his introduction of \r\nthe report of the Security Council (A/65/2). \r\n I wish now to address agenda item 119, on the \r\nquestion of equitable geographical representation on \r\nand increase in the membership of the Security Council \r\nand related matters. \r\n I am pleased to note that significant achievements \r\nhave been made during the past year. Most notably, \r\nunder the stewardship of Ambassador Tanin, we now \r\nhave an inclusive negotiation text, which we hope will \r\nserve as a guide for the next phase of negotiation. \r\n However, we would like to emphasize that any \r\nattempts to modify the current text should be \r\nthoroughly debated and fully agreed by all parties \r\nconcerned. Moreover, the single most important \r\nguideline should be the principle of general agreement \r\nreferred to in resolution 48/26, of 3 December 1993. \r\nEfforts to reform the Security Council should not lead \r\nto divisiveness among Member States, but rather must \r\nmake a contribution to a more cohesive and \r\ncooperative United Nations for all. \r\n In that regard, I would like to point out that while \r\nall other groups have remained stagnant in their \r\npositions, the Uniting for Consensus group has \r\nexercised a great deal of flexibility. I truly hope that \r\nother parties will become more willing to move \r\nforward in a spirit of compromise, so that tangible \r\nprogress can be made in the near future. \r\n Through the five rounds of intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations held thus far, all of us have become more \r\nthan well aware of the basic positions of the major \r\ngroups. Through deliberations, we collectively \r\nidentified the key elements and issues to be \r\nincorporated in the Security Council reform process. \r\nAlso, we came to the realization that all the key issues \r\nare intrinsically intertwined. Therefore, we would like \r\nto emphasize that a comprehensive approach, \r\nconcluded through a single undertaking, is \r\nindispensable. \r\n I would like to take this opportunity to briefly \r\nreiterate my Government’s position on the five key \r\nissues. \r\n First, on the issue of categories of membership, \r\nthe unswerving basic philosophy of my delegation is \r\nthat a more democratic manner of representation will \r\nspur greater accountability and transparency. We firmly \r\nbelieve that that can be secured only through the \r\nperiodic election of Security Council members. \r\nPeriodic elections will provide Member States with \r\nmore opportunities to become Council members, \r\nensuring more equitable representation. Moreover, \r\nthrough elections, the merits and demerits of a Council \r\nmember can be judged in a fair manner, thus \r\n A/65/PV.50\r\n \r\n11 10-63473 \r\n \r\nfacilitating a more transparent member selection \r\nprocess. \r\n On the other hand, reform of membership \r\ncategories that merely promotes one election in which \r\na handful of winners will remain in the Council \r\nindefinitely contradicts not only democratic principles, \r\nbut also disregards the incessantly evolving dynamics \r\nof our changing world. Indeed, during the past few \r\nyears we have witnessed various global challenges that \r\nentailed concerted efforts of diverse new players. \r\nThese times, which are characterized by globalization, \r\ninterdependence and multifaceted challenges, call for a \r\nso-called new multilateralism. Against that backdrop, \r\nthe rigid fixture of permanent membership would \r\nundermine the agility that will be required for the \r\nCouncil to rise to the occasion and meet the challenges \r\nof tomorrow. \r\n Secondly, with regard to the question of the veto, \r\nwe all know that that peculiar mechanism was put into \r\nplace in the aftermath of the Second World War to get \r\nthis institution off and running. In the modern context, \r\nif the continued existence of the veto is deemed \r\nnecessary as a result of the realities of power politics, \r\nthen at the very least that action must be exercised with \r\nutmost restraint, along with timely and adequate \r\nexplanation of the reasons why it is being invoked. \r\n Thirdly, regional representation, while achieving \r\nequitable geographical distribution among regional \r\ngroups, is an important shared objective of the larger \r\nmembership and an integral part of the Security \r\nCouncil reform process. Therefore the substantial \r\nunderrepresentation of certain regions — namely, \r\nAfrica, Asia and Latin America — needs to be rectified \r\nas a priority. While we concede that representation has \r\nto do with more than just ratios, it certainly can be one \r\nclear indicator of where a region stands in terms of \r\nestablishing its presence on the Security Council. \r\n Fourthly, on the issue of size, my delegation \r\nrecognizes that there is wide agreement that expansion \r\nin the size of the Council must be sufficient to improve \r\nthe overall representation of the current membership. \r\nWe are flexible, however, on what constitutes a \r\nreasonable scale of enlargement and will not insist on \r\nspecific numbers. Instead, the final outcome must \r\ndepend on what is a reasonable size for a new Council, \r\none that is not only representative but can also operate \r\nwith functional efficiency. \r\n Finally, with regard to the working methods, \r\nthere have been continual calls for the Council to \r\nimprove its transparency, effectiveness and \r\ninclusiveness. We are well aware of the underlying \r\nlimitations imposed by the ever-increasing workload of \r\nthe Council members and the deluge of new and \r\ndaunting tasks that consume much of their time and \r\nattention. Nonetheless, we believe that consistent and \r\nstructured efforts must be made to enhance the overall \r\ntransparency, accountability and inclusiveness of the \r\nCouncil. That is necessary for reaching any \r\ncomprehensive reform. \r\n Before bringing my remarks to a close, I would \r\nlike to mention that Security Council reform should be \r\na member-driven process, as stipulated in General \r\nAssembly decision 62/557. In that connection I would \r\nlike to echo the remarks made by some other \r\ncolleagues in requesting the presidency to provide \r\nMember States with a road map on the future course of \r\naction. That will help us to better prepare ourselves and \r\nhave more engaged and productive meetings. \r\n Now is the time for all of us to break the \r\ndeadlock and take tangible steps towards a feasible \r\nsolution, rather than reiterating rigid positions. In that \r\nregard, my delegation believes that the intermediary \r\napproach, with the establishment of longer-term seats \r\nin addition to the regular two-year seats, seems to be \r\nthe most practical compromise at the current juncture. \r\nMy delegation is ready to participate actively in earnest \r\ndiscussions on that viable solution, and we hope that \r\nother delegations will be willing to move forward as \r\nwell in the coming months. \r\n Ms. Štiglic (Slovenia): We welcome today’s joint \r\ndebate on the report of the Security Council (A/65/2) \r\nand on the question of equitable geographical \r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of \r\nthe Security Council and related matters, given the \r\nimportant substantive connection between the two. \r\n I would like to express my gratitude to the \r\ncurrent President of the Security Council, the \r\nPermanent Representative of the United Kingdom of \r\nGreat Britain and Northern Ireland, for his introduction \r\nof the annual report of the Security Council, covering \r\nthe period from 1 August 2009 to 31 July 2010. \r\n The Security Council’s annual report is one of the \r\ncentral channels in the relationship between the \r\nCouncil and the General Assembly and provides the \r\nrest of the membership with a valuable account of the \r\nA/65/PV.50  \r\n \r\n10-63473 12 \r\n \r\nwork of the body that has the primary responsibility for \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security. \r\nThis year’s report demonstrates yet again that the \r\ncomplexity, variety and volume of the Council’s \r\nworkload continue to grow. \r\n We appreciate the efforts made in producing the \r\nreport before us, especially those by the delegation of \r\nNigeria as the President of the Security Council for the \r\nmonth of July, and we also welcome a number of \r\nqualitative improvements that have been made in past \r\nyears in the preparation of these annual reports. \r\n The relevance of the report goes well beyond the \r\ndescription of its activities. We therefore encourage \r\nSecurity Council members to continue to strive for \r\nreports that are more analytical and to continue with \r\nthe established practice and engage with Member \r\nStates in an interactive exchange of views on the report \r\nin its preparatory process. \r\n We welcome the improvements in the area of the \r\nCouncil’s working methods. Better working methods \r\nand more transparency towards the wider membership \r\ncan improve the Council’s efficiency, enhance its \r\nlegitimacy and strengthen its role as the body that the \r\nCharter entrusted with the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security. \r\n For many years now, Member States have been \r\nconfronted with an ever-increasing number of Council \r\ndecisions with notable security, legal and financial \r\nimplications for each Member State. The \r\nimplementation of such decisions without participation \r\nin the decision-making requires greater transparency, \r\ninclusiveness and engagement with non-member States \r\non a more regular and frequent basis. We appreciate \r\nand support the initiatives of the Small Five group in \r\nthat regard. \r\n We also support an intensified and more \r\nsystematic consultation process that involves the \r\nSecurity Council, troop and police contributors and the \r\nSecretariat on peacekeeping mandates and operations, \r\nfacilitated in large part by the active engagement of the \r\nCouncil’s working group. We welcome such efforts \r\ndirected towards encouraging transparent and inclusive \r\ndialogue on United Nations peacekeeping, leading to \r\nmobilizing and maintaining the political and \r\noperational support of all stakeholders throughout the \r\nlife cycle of a mission. \r\n Your decision, Mr. President, to choose the theme \r\n“Reaffirming the central role of the United Nations in \r\nglobal governance” for this year’s general debate was a \r\ntimely one, and reform of the Security Council is one \r\nof the crucial elements for strengthening the key role \r\nof the United Nations in global governance. Slovenia \r\nfirmly believes that the reform of the Security Council \r\nis long overdue and necessary. It remains our \r\ncompelling task, and it is widely accepted that no \r\nUnited Nations reform will be complete without the \r\nreform of the Security Council. \r\n Reform needs to address both enlargement of the \r\nmembership and improvement of the working methods. \r\nSlovenia has been active in addressing both issues. \r\n While presiding over the Security Council during \r\nour first membership in the Council, in 1998 and 1999, \r\nSlovenia decided to make the provisional monthly \r\nprogramme of work available on the Internet for the \r\nfirst time. That indeed was a small but important step \r\nin making the work of the Council more transparent. \r\nWe are also pleased that the practice of inviting all \r\nnewly elected members of the Council to observe \r\ninformal consultations during the month before their \r\nterm has become a reality. \r\n Regarding the enlargement of the Security \r\nCouncil, Slovenia’s position is clear: it is not only a \r\nmatter of fairness but also a necessity. A reformed \r\nCouncil needs to better reflect geopolitical realities and \r\nmust be more representative, with its authority and \r\nlegitimacy strengthened. \r\n Slovenia remains convinced that the Council \r\nshould be expanded in the categories of both \r\npermanent and non-permanent members. Particular \r\nattention should be paid to the representation of \r\ncountries from Africa. The enlargement of the Council \r\nshould also increase the possibility for small and \r\nmedium-sized States, which account for the vast \r\nmajority of the United Nations membership, to serve in \r\nthe Council. \r\n Progress was made in the last few rounds of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform in the Assembly’s sixty-fourth session, in \r\nparticular with the presentation of the compilation text \r\nby the Chairman of the negotiations. Many proposals \r\nand models for the Council’s expansion have been \r\nsuggested, including one by Slovenia, and all of them \r\nare well captured in the compilation text. \r\n A/65/PV.50\r\n \r\n13 10-63473 \r\n \r\n Here, I would like to commend the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Afghanistan, Ambassador Zahir \r\nTanin, for his tremendous efforts and impartial \r\nleadership over the past two years, which gave the \r\nCouncil reform negotiations the boost they so urgently \r\nneeded. We welcome his reappointment as Chair of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on Council reform \r\nduring the sixty-fifth session and assure him of our full \r\nsupport as he continues to assist Member States to \r\nnavigate the way through this complex issue in the \r\nmonths ahead. \r\n We all have a stake in this intergovernmental \r\nprocess. We should try to further consolidate the \r\ncompilation text, maintain the momentum generated \r\nand move forward the process of negotiations on the \r\nquestion of equitable representation on and increase in \r\nthe membership of the Security Council. \r\n We appreciate your presence during this \r\ndiscussion, Mr. President, and in particular the \r\nimportance you and your Office attach to the issues \r\ndiscussed today. We are convinced that your \r\nleadership, experience, guidance and wisdom, coupled \r\nwith the necessary political will, good faith and \r\nflexibility among Member States, will bring us to a \r\nsuccessful conclusion of the prolonged debate on the \r\nissue of Security Council reform. \r\n Mr. Gutiérrez (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): I would \r\nlike to express my gratitude to you, Mr. President, for \r\nconsidering the process of Security Council reform a \r\npriority matter to be addressed during the Assembly’s \r\nsixty-fifth session. Likewise, I am pleased that our \r\ncolleague, the Permanent Representative of \r\nAfghanistan, Ambassador Zahir Tanin, will continue to \r\nchair the intergovernmental negotiations in informal \r\nplenary of the Assembly on the question of equitable \r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of \r\nthe Security Council and related matters. I would also \r\nlike to thank Ambassador Sir Mark Lyall Grant, current \r\nPresident of the Council, for his presentation of the \r\nannual report of that body (A/65/2) at the 48th \r\nmeeting. \r\n The annual report of the Security Council, in my \r\ndelegation’s view, could be supplemented and \r\nimproved. More substantial content is needed, in \r\nparticular with respect to the decisions taken, the \r\nprocess that precedes decisions being taken, and their \r\nimplementation. \r\n Likewise, it is important that the report contain \r\ninformation on its working methods. That would allow \r\nus to have a more comprehensive view of the issues \r\naddressed, would avoid a report limited to being \r\nmerely referential or descriptive and, above all, would \r\nprovide us with the proper perspective from which to \r\nobserve the tasks before the Council. Also, self-\r\nevaluation by the Council is a crucial step, which \r\nshould be carried out to determine what kind of new \r\nmeasures should be implemented to enhance its \r\nlegitimacy and the efficiency and effectiveness of its \r\nwork. \r\n It is also of crucial importance to make progress \r\ntowards concrete reform of the Council’s working \r\nmethods in order to make them more transparent and \r\nefficient. To that end, we believe that there should be \r\nmore open meetings and more meetings to update \r\nMembers on the issues under consideration and that \r\nthose meetings should be of a substantive nature and be \r\ncarried out in a timely fashion. It is also of the highest \r\nimportance to consolidate the practice of having the \r\nSecurity Council consult with troop-contributing \r\ncountries before Council deliberations on the pertinent \r\nsubject, as well as that of carrying out regular self-\r\nassessments and reviews of the implementation of the \r\nCouncil’s decisions. \r\n My delegation believes that the open \r\nconsultations held in connection with Security Council \r\nreports prior to their preparation are beneficial. That \r\npractice favours transparency and better coordination \r\nwith the General Assembly, as well as the Council’s \r\nresponsibility to be accountable when listening to and \r\nrespecting the opinions expressed by Member States. \r\nIn that context, we ask that this become a regular \r\npractice. \r\n The Secretary-General’s reports, as well as the \r\npractice of holding open debates on the topics the \r\nCouncil deals with — for example, debates on the \r\nsituation in the Middle East, the reports of the \r\nSecretary-General on peacebuilding in the immediate \r\naftermath of conflicts, and the role of women in \r\npeacebuilding — are all initiatives we commend. For \r\nthat to have real and added value, it should not be just \r\na formal part of the proceedings immediately preceding \r\nthe issuance of presidential statements, or, worse, \r\nwhere the Council’s conclusions are known even \r\nbefore the proceedings are over. Inasmuch as debates \r\nshould reflect the opinion of the Members of the \r\nOrganization when it comes to issues falling under \r\nA/65/PV.50  \r\n \r\n10-63473 14 \r\n \r\ntheir competence, it is vital that the Council consider \r\nall the positions expressed, including the possibility \r\nthat Council members listen to non-member countries \r\nfirst. All of this will demonstrate the Council’s desire \r\nfor openness and inclusiveness, features we believe are \r\nessential to the work of such an important body. \r\n With regard to the process of Security Council \r\nreform, as my delegation indicated at the meeting \r\nconvened by the presidency this past October, we \r\nbelieve that the last five rounds of the negotiating \r\nprocess have produced positive progress, thanks to a \r\nhigh level of participation by the entire membership. In \r\nthis regard, we reiterate our opinion that we are seeing \r\nsome important momentum that we should take \r\nadvantage of in order to arrive at a renewed and \r\nreformed Security Council, with the goal of \r\ntransforming it into a more democratic and \r\nrepresentative body that is also more effective and \r\nefficient. \r\n In spite of the progress made with the \r\nmethodology used up to now, we run the risk of \r\nbecoming mired in the thematic compilation of the \r\nvarious positions expressed. We need to give fresh \r\nimpetus to the negotiations and move towards an \r\ninformally structured drafting exercise that will lead us \r\nto a negotiating text with clear alternatives that can \r\nrely on the support and, above all, the political \r\ncommitment of the membership. \r\n In that regard, my delegation reiterates its request \r\nthat the Chair of the negotiations process or the Office \r\nof the President provide — in the light of what the \r\nmembership has expressed so far — a new basic \r\nnegotiating text that goes beyond the consolidation of \r\npositions and identifies and analyses the options before \r\nus so as to allow us to move on to negotiations aimed \r\nat producing tangible, balanced and representative \r\nresults — always on the basis of the principle that this \r\nmust be an inclusive and transparent process aimed at \r\nswift reform of the Security Council. \r\n Peru reiterates its conviction that, in order to \r\nadapt the Council to new realities, we must add new \r\nmembers, both permanent and non-permanent, while \r\npromoting just and fair regional representation that \r\nalters the current status quo. \r\n With regard to the question of the veto, Peru has \r\nalways held to a position of principle whose ultimate \r\ngoal is the veto’s elimination. However, in the spirit of \r\nbeing constructive and in order not to paralyse the \r\nnegotiating process, my delegation believes that a \r\ncommitment should be made to assess, as a first step, \r\nlimitations on the use of the veto, via an existing \r\nconcept of the rule established in paragraph 3, Article \r\n27, of the Charter. Additionally, Peru believes that it is \r\nimportant to reach a consensus that makes it possible to \r\nset precise limits on the use of the veto, eliminating the \r\npossibility of exercising it in cases of genocide, crimes \r\nagainst humanity and repeated flagrant violations of \r\nhuman rights. \r\n There is a need for us to expeditiously embark \r\nupon a real process of negotiation. The constant \r\nrepetition of our national positions will not get us \r\nanywhere. In a word, if we wish to reform the Council, \r\nas we say unanimously here, we must turn that desire \r\ninto concrete commitments. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I now give the \r\nfloor to the representative of the Bolivarian Republic \r\nof Venezuela on a point of order. \r\n Mr. Moreno Zapata (Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela) (spoke in Spanish): We have asked to speak \r\non a point of order because we noted that when the \r\nPermanent Representative of the Bolivarian Republic \r\nof Venezuela spoke during yesterday morning’s \r\nmeeting, the interpretation from Spanish into English \r\ndid not match what Mr. Jorge Valero was saying. In \r\nthat regard, the Mission of the Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela to the United Nations wishes to lodge a \r\nformal complaint against the Interpretation Service. I \r\nrequest that our complaint be entered into the record of \r\nthis meeting. \r\n Mr. Sial (Pakistan): Thank you for convening \r\ntoday’s important meeting, Mr. President. I would also \r\nlike to thank the Permanent Representative of the \r\nUnited Kingdom, President of the Security Council for \r\nthis month, for presenting the Council’s report (A/65/2) \r\nto the General Assembly. We did, however, note that in \r\nhis statement, the Jammu and Kashmir dispute was not \r\nmentioned in the context of unresolved ongoing \r\nsituations. We understand that this was an inadvertent \r\nomission, as Jammu and Kashmir is one of the oldest \r\ndisputes on the Council’s agenda. \r\n The report of the Security Council is an annual \r\ncompendium of its work, meetings, correspondence \r\nand decisions. Its basic merit is in its procedural \r\naccuracies and its reference value. These attributes \r\ncould be reinforced with a certain level of analytical \r\n A/65/PV.50\r\n \r\n15 10-63473 \r\n \r\nexplanation on the work of the Council and its \r\ndecision-making processes. \r\n The Security Council acts on behalf of the entire \r\nmembership of the United Nations in discharging its \r\nduties as the principal organ responsible for the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. By \r\npresenting its report to the General Assembly, the \r\nSecurity Council offers up its work to be reviewed by \r\nthe entire membership vis-à-vis how efficiently duties \r\nhave been discharged on members’ behalf. In \r\nreviewing the work of the Council, we will focus on \r\ntwo dimensions: first, the effectiveness of the Council \r\nin maintaining international peace and security and, \r\nsecondly, the Council’s ability to reflect the views and \r\ninterests of the widest possible part of the membership. \r\n In the context of effectiveness, our delegation \r\nacknowledges the role of the Security Council in the \r\narea of addressing violent conflicts by efficiently \r\nlaying down peacekeeping mandates and ensuring that \r\nthey are backed up with logistical support. Such work \r\nby the Council has been facilitated by troop-\r\ncontributing countries and the Secretariat. With the \r\ngrowing realization of the importance of peacebuilding \r\nefforts and the gradual but solid consolidation of the \r\nUnited Nations peacebuilding architecture, the Council \r\nis now better equipped to discharge the mandate of \r\npreventing a relapse into conflict. The Council \r\ndeserves our appreciation for its important work in \r\nhandling conflicts through the pragmatic use of \r\npeacekeeping mandates and peacebuilding strategies. \r\n However, the Council needs to recalibrate its \r\nefforts in conflict prevention and more often take \r\nrecourse in the pacific settlement of disputes under \r\nChapter VI of the United Nations Charter. That is \r\nparticularly important in the case of inter-State \r\nconflicts. Major unresolved issues on the Council’s \r\nagenda, including Jammu and Kashmir, have awaited \r\nsettlement for a long time. Even in the case of issues \r\nthat are routinely discussed, such as the question of \r\nPalestine, the Council seems to have abdicated its role \r\nto individual countries or informal groupings. It needs \r\nto redress that to efficiently discharge its responsibility \r\nto maintain international peace and security. \r\n The second dimension is the assessment of the \r\nSecurity Council’s work and transparency. \r\nUnfortunately, in that area the annual report provides \r\nlittle information or analysis, particularly with regard \r\nto its decision-making processes. It is a widely held \r\nview that decisions emanate from a few major players \r\nin closed-door meetings, if not behind the scenes. \r\nAccordingly, such decisions lack transparency and \r\ninclusiveness. Similarly, the Council should fulfil the \r\nCharter requirement of submitting a special report to \r\nthe General Assembly. \r\n To a large extent, the openness and transparency \r\nof the Security Council is related to an improvement in \r\nits working methods. Improving the working methods \r\nof the Council and enhancing its transparency and \r\naccountability are the basic underlying objectives of \r\nthe ongoing reform process. That brings me to the \r\nsecond agenda item of our debate today, that is, the \r\nreform of the Security Council. \r\n In that context, the Prime Minister of Pakistan \r\nmade a statement today in Parliament on the subject of \r\nSecurity Council reform. \r\n  “All Member States, regions and groups of \r\nStates have vital interests in the reform of the \r\nSecurity Council. Achieving a comprehensive and \r\nequitable reform of the Security Council is a \r\nshared objective of the entire membership. \r\n  “We believe that an effective and feasible \r\nreform of the Security Council can only be \r\nachieved through negotiations leading to a \r\nconsensus decision endorsed by the United \r\nNations membership. In this regard, Pakistan \r\nremains constructively engaged in the negotiation \r\nprocess at the United Nations in New York. \r\n  “Our efforts for reform of the Security \r\nCouncil are structured around the following four \r\npillars. One, the reform should be comprehensive. \r\nTwo, it should be based on the principle of \r\nsovereign equality. Three, it should enhance \r\naccountability of the Security Council to the \r\ngeneral membership. And four, reform should \r\nresult in a more united and strengthened United \r\nNations.” \r\n During the recent round of intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on 21 October, which the President \r\nchaired, Member States put forth ideas on the way \r\nforward. Pakistan believes that real progress in the \r\nreform process can be achieved with flexibility and \r\ncompromise. In that context, the Uniting for Consensus \r\ngroup has already shown flexibility by moving from its \r\nposition of 2005 to endorsement of the Italy/Colombia \r\npaper. \r\nA/65/PV.50  \r\n \r\n10-63473 16 \r\n \r\n The Uniting for Consensus proposal allows for \r\nvariable arrangements and different possibilities and \r\noptions, thereby giving prominence to regional \r\nrepresentation as well as the representation of small \r\nStates. That formula reflects a complex global political \r\nconfiguration, which essentially implies the presence \r\nof a few large States, a number of medium-sized States \r\nand a majority of smaller States, and the emergence of \r\nregional organizations, which play an important role in \r\ninternational and regional peace and security. \r\n Our proposal also takes into account the concept \r\nof equitable geographical distribution, as envisaged in \r\nArticle 23 of the Charter. The concept of equitable \r\ngeographical distribution would make little sense if a \r\nseat allocated to a region were to be occupied \r\npermanently by one country. That is why we respect \r\nand understand Africa’s position, as reflected in the \r\nEzulwini Consensus. Africa’s just demand for a \r\npermanent presence in the Council is for the entire \r\nregion. It is therefore different from those that seek a \r\nseat for themselves. Similarly, we support the position \r\nof the Organization of the Islamic Conference \r\ndemanding adequate representation of the Muslim \r\nUmmah in the Security Council. \r\n I will conclude by acknowledging your role as \r\nPresident of the Assembly, Sir, in steering forward the \r\nprocess of Security Council reform. We value your \r\npresence here today and during the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on 21 October 2010. We are certain that \r\nyour close engagement will ensure the Assembly’s \r\noversight of the work of the Security Council, as well \r\nas its ownership of the reform process. \r\n Mr. Koterec (Slovakia): I wish to thank you, \r\nMr. President, for convening this highly relevant joint \r\nannual debate on two critically important items, \r\nnamely, the report (A/65/2) of the Security Council and \r\nthe question of equitable representation on and increase \r\nin the membership of the Security Council. \r\n Discussing those two mutually interrelated items \r\ntogether is essential to strengthening the much desired \r\ncooperation between the General Assembly and the \r\nSecurity Council, as it provides the general \r\nmembership with a unique, once-a-year opportunity to \r\nreview the hard work of the Council over the past \r\n12 months, appreciate its accomplishments and assess \r\nareas where changes would contribute to greater \r\nefficiency and relevance. I believe that, after today’s \r\nexhaustive discussion, we will come to an even better \r\nunderstanding of each other’s views and an even \r\nstronger determination to strengthen our concerted \r\neffort to bring our positions closer if we seriously want \r\nto move forward towards a truly effective, credible and \r\nreliable Security Council. \r\n As for the report before us, I would like first of \r\nall to thank the President of the Security Council for \r\nthe month of November, Ambassador Mark Lyall \r\nGrant, Permanent Representative of the United \r\nKingdom, for his informative presentation of the \r\nreport. I would also like to commend the whole \r\nSecurity Council for the thorough and improved \r\nassessment of its work. We welcome the inclusion of \r\nthematic debates in the report in past years. The \r\nincreasing number of meetings being opened to the \r\nwider membership is particularly noteworthy since it \r\ngives non-members a much appreciated opportunity to \r\nfollow the urgent issues on the Security Council \r\nagenda more closely. Equally, we value the new \r\ninteractive informal talks with Member States during \r\nthe preparatory stages of the report. \r\n We commend the Security Council for providing \r\nus with a highly informative and comprehensive report, \r\nalbeit mainly from a statistical point of view. Having \r\nfirst-hand experience of serving on the Security \r\nCouncil recently, my delegation understands that it is \r\nnot feasible for the Council to compile a thorough \r\npolitical analysis of its proceedings, and we would in \r\nno way want to see its independence threatened. \r\n However, there are few areas where we would \r\nappreciate getting more out of the report. For instance, \r\nthe Council could elaborate more comprehensively on \r\ncross-cutting issues and link thematic topics to specific \r\ncountry situations, especially in those areas where the \r\nSecurity Council encounters the greatest hardship. For \r\nexample, it would be truly helpful to the wider \r\nmembership to understand the rationale behind \r\nSecurity Council decisions and to see in the report the \r\nCouncil’s own assessment of its successes and \r\nshortcomings. We appreciate, though, that the report \r\ncontains information on the working methods and on \r\nthe implementation of the presidential note \r\nS/2006/507. \r\n The issue of the working methods brings me now \r\nto the second item before the Assembly today, that is, \r\nthe pressing question of the reform of the Security \r\nCouncil. Here, I would like first of all to commend His \r\nExcellency Ambassador Zahir Tanin, Permanent \r\n A/65/PV.50\r\n \r\n17 10-63473 \r\n \r\nRepresentative of Afghanistan, for his excellent \r\nleadership skills, tireless efforts and the manner in \r\nwhich he has guided us through our negotiations over \r\nthe past two sessions. We welcome the fact that under \r\nhis able stewardship we have reached a new stage of \r\ntext-based negotiations. We have recently also \r\nwitnessed movements in the positions of some \r\ncountries. My delegation truly believes that, given our \r\nhard work over the past years on this issue, the time is \r\nripe to break the stalemate and start showing the world \r\nsome tangible results. \r\n To achieve that, we appeal to all delegations to \r\nshow further flexibility and political will and start \r\nnarrowing down the wide range of proposals on the \r\ntable. Even though we see merit in all of them, I \r\nreiterate our belief that we need to let go of those \r\nproposals that enjoy the least support, and concentrate \r\non those that stand a solid chance of garnering the \r\nwidest possible agreement. \r\n Since the position of my delegation is well \r\nknown, let me just briefly recap its main elements. \r\nFirst, States capable of assuming global responsibility \r\nfor the maintenance of international peace and security \r\nshould become eligible for filling the posts of new \r\npermanent members of the Security Council, provided \r\nthat the right of the veto is not further extended. To the \r\ncontrary, the veto must also be subjected to a serious \r\nreform as to the scope and the manner it is being \r\napplied. \r\n Secondly, we believe that the intermediate \r\nsolution merits our serious consideration. At this \r\nmoment, the concept lacks clarity and seems to mean \r\ndifferent things to different delegations. But we hear \r\nresounding calls for the notion of a review conference, \r\nwhich would make any new formats temporary. \r\n Thirdly, in order to allow for prospective new \r\npermanent members to truly get settled in their new \r\nroles and prove their capabilities, it is essential that \r\nthey carry out their new responsibilities for at least 10 \r\nto 15 years. If they stand up to that challenge \r\nsuccessfully and earn the trust of the overall United \r\nNations membership, they should go through another \r\ndemocratic election process for a permanent seat. \r\n Fourthly, as for regional representation as such, it \r\nis essential to ensure equitable geographical \r\nrepresentation of posts within the non-permanent \r\ncategory of the Security Council. We believe that some \r\nof the regional groups, including the Group of Eastern \r\nEuropean States, need to be allocated at least one \r\nadditional non-permanent seat. \r\n Fifthly, let me reiterate that in Article 24 of the \r\nCharter, we Member States conferred on the Security \r\nCouncil the primary responsibility for the maintenance \r\nof international peace and security and agreed that the \r\nCouncil would act on our behalf. When deciding on the \r\nsize of the Council, rather than making it ineffectively \r\nlarge for the sake of representation, it is essential that \r\nwe all bear in mind the need to choose its \r\nrepresentatives in such a way that we can fully trust \r\nthem to act on behalf of us all. \r\n As we have stated on numerous previous \r\noccasions, my country’s primary goal in this process is \r\nto ensure a more effective and efficient Security \r\nCouncil that is truly able to act and deal with the \r\nincreasing challenges we all face. Slovakia is therefore \r\nopen to all constructive proposals, and will consider \r\nthem with the utmost level of open-mindedness and \r\nflexibility. \r\n For the sake of protecting the environment, this \r\nstatement will be circulated to all Permanent Missions \r\nvia e-mail. \r\n Mrs. Waffa-Ogoo (Gambia): At the outset, allow \r\nme to thank you, Mr. President, for convening this joint \r\ndebate on agenda items 29 and 119, “Report of the \r\nSecurity Council” and “Question of equitable \r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of \r\nthe Security Council and related matters”. Let me also \r\nthank the Council’s President for the month of \r\nNovember, Sir Mark Lyall Grant, for introducing the \r\nreport of the Security Council (A/65/2). Allow me also \r\nto commend the members of the Council for their work \r\non the maintenance of international peace and security. \r\nI am also grateful to Her Excellency Mrs. Joy Ogwu \r\nfor preparing the first part of the report in her capacity \r\nas President of the Council in the month of July. \r\n It is apparent from the report that conflict \r\nsituations in Africa continue to dominate the agenda of \r\nthe Council. In this regard, my delegation would like to \r\nnote that the continuing engagement of the Council in \r\nAfrica has helped tremendously in solving many of the \r\nconflicts that once raged across the continent. Part of \r\nthat success is attributable to the increasing \r\nengagement of African leaders and institutions with \r\ninternational partners in the search for lasting peace. \r\nWe therefore encourage the Council to continue to \r\nnurture such useful partnerships across Africa. \r\nA/65/PV.50  \r\n \r\n10-63473 18 \r\n \r\n In the period under review, my delegation has \r\nnoted that the increasing involvement of the United \r\nNations Office for West Africa (UNOWA) in \r\npartnership with the Economic Community of West \r\nAfrican States has helped to tackle a lot of conflict and \r\npotential conflict situations across West Africa. We \r\ncommend the Council for encouraging the work of \r\nUNOWA and its regional partners. UNOWA’s \r\ninvolvement in Guinea, Guinea-Bissau and the Niger \r\nare some of the examples whose lessons should be \r\npreserved for conflict resolution and mediation, \r\nespecially in dealing with cross-border issues in West \r\nAfrica. Preventive diplomacy should remain a core tool \r\nof the Council, the Department of Political Affairs, \r\nregional organizations and other international partners. \r\n Allow me to commend the Council for its \r\nengagement with the authorities of Guinea-Bissau. \r\nGuinea-Bissau needs all the support it can garner from \r\nthe international community in order to address some \r\nof its post-conflict development and security \r\nchallenges. Security sector reform, rule of law support \r\nand reconstruction are key areas in which the Council \r\ncan call on the international community to assist \r\nGuinea-Bissau. Effective peacebuilding is a corollary \r\nto long-term stability. \r\n In assessing new threats to international peace \r\nand security, the twin threats of organized crime and \r\nillegal drug trafficking across West Africa should \r\nreceive the constant attention of the Council. The \r\ndividends of the hard-won peace and stability that are \r\nnow being enjoyed across the continent should not be \r\nallowed to dissipate on account of these new threats. \r\nThe subregion of West Africa needs the support of the \r\nUnited Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and \r\nINTERPOL in assessing these threats and fashioning \r\nnew tools and information networks to combat them. \r\n The illicit flow of small arms must also be \r\narrested. Regional efforts to take such weapons out of \r\ncirculation should be supported by the international \r\ncommunity. The Council can do more to encourage \r\ninstitutions to tackle these threats to international peace \r\nand security. \r\n The thematic debates that the Council frequently \r\nholds are an important way of contributing to the \r\ndialogue on critical issues that relate to the mandate of \r\nthe Security Council. Those meetings are useful, but \r\nwe must move increasingly away from the issuing of \r\npresidential statements at the end of debates and \r\ntowards assessing how effectively they contribute to \r\ninforming decisions of the Council. On the whole, we \r\nbelieve the Council’s report could be more analytical \r\nthan it is at present. \r\n We have noted the Council’s efforts at \r\nmodernizing its working methods with a view to \r\nencouraging greater transparency and efficiency. No \r\ndoubt, that is a work in progress. It must continue to \r\ntake place in tandem with addressing the larger \r\nquestion of Security Council reform. Dialogue and \r\ninteraction with troop- and police-contributing \r\ncountries is a commendable feature of the Council’s \r\nwork with non-members. The timely sharing of \r\ninformation on new or ongoing missions can help in \r\nmanaging the planning and development processes for \r\ncontributions. \r\n Another aspect of the Council’s practice that we \r\nconsider very useful is its visiting the countries on its \r\nagenda. We believe this can contribute immensely to \r\nincreasing the awareness of members as to the realities \r\non the ground and help the Council to arrive at \r\ninformed decisions. On many occasions, members are \r\nfar removed from the theatre of conflict and depend \r\nlargely on secondary sources of information to arrive at \r\ndecisions. This is a practice that should continue. \r\n Under agenda item 119, allow me now to address \r\nissues pertaining to the reform of the Security Council. \r\nMy delegation would like to align itself with the \r\nstatements made by the Ambassadors of Sierra Leone \r\nand Egypt on behalf of the African Group and the Non-\r\nAligned Movement, respectively. Ambassador Zahir \r\nTanin of Afghanistan must be commended for the \r\nwonderful work that he is doing in facilitating the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations and for the text that he \r\ncompiled this year. We believe that it is a good starting \r\npoint for our negotiations, as all the elements and \r\npositions have been spelled out. It is our hope that, \r\nnow that we have a text to work with, negotiations will \r\nsoon start in earnest. As a way forward, we need a \r\ntimeline and a workplan to embark on negotiations, \r\nwith a view to concluding them by the end of this \r\nsession. Various positions and viewpoints are very well \r\nknown. What we need now is sincerity and flexibility \r\nas guiding elements to take us forward. \r\n The reform of the Security Council was part of \r\nthe package of reforms agreed in 2000. At that time, \r\nthe Secretary-General reminded us that no reform of \r\nthe United Nations would be complete without the \r\n A/65/PV.50\r\n \r\n19 10-63473 \r\n \r\nreform of the Security Council. Looking at the \r\nCouncil’s agenda, the bulk of countries with situations \r\nunder consideration are in Africa. Africa still continues \r\nto be underrepresented in the permanent category of \r\nmembership, if not unrepresented at all. \r\n The Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte \r\nDeclaration clearly spelled out that our position and \r\ndemands were just and legitimate. In the next round of \r\nnegotiations, we will relentlessly pursue our fair \r\nrepresentation in the Council. Piecemeal reform of the \r\nworking methods and the establishment of ad hoc \r\narrangements cannot be called true reform. \r\n It is critical that Africa be a part of the decision-\r\nmaking processes that affect it. This historical \r\nimbalance needs to be corrected once and for all. We \r\ncannot embark on endless half-hearted negotiations \r\nyear in and year out and expect reform. It is for this \r\nreason that my delegation believes that a definite \r\ntimeline is of the essence. \r\n Mr. Errázuriz (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): I \r\nwould like to thank the representative of the United \r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for his \r\npresentation of the report of the Security Council \r\n(A/65/2), which details the intense activities \r\nundertaken by the Council between 1 August 2009 and \r\n31 July 2010 and which we have read attentively and \r\ntaken due note of. \r\n Chile has supported a comprehensive reform of \r\nthe United Nations that, while reaffirming the \r\nprinciples and values of the Charter, serves to increase \r\nthe credibility and legitimacy of the Organization. That \r\nis particularly pertinent given the main theme chosen \r\nby the President of the Assembly for this session, \r\nnamely, “Reaffirming the central role of the United \r\nNations in global governance”. That is essentially \r\nabout supporting inclusive multilateralism that is \r\ncapable of addressing the multiple challenges we face \r\ntoday, all the while recognizing that development, \r\ninternational security, democracy and human rights are \r\ninterdependent and mutually reinforcing. \r\n The reform of the Security Council constitutes a \r\ncentral element in these efforts. The body responsible \r\nfor international peace and security must be \r\nrepresentative and democratic in order to adequately \r\nreflect the international reality of the twenty-first \r\ncentury. Chile supports a Security Council reform that \r\nwill make it more representative, transparent and \r\nefficient. In order to achieve that, we must move \r\nforward both in increasing its membership with an eye \r\nto balancing appropriate participation for the \r\ndeveloping world — as illustrated by the example of \r\nthe underrepresented regions of Africa and Latin \r\nAmerica and the Caribbean — and in reforming its \r\nworking methods to make them increasingly \r\ntransparent and inclusive. Fortunately, we are seeing \r\nsome progress on the latter. \r\n Chile supports the expansion of the Council in \r\nboth its permanent and non-permanent categories of \r\nmembership, recognizing that there are countries that \r\ncan and should contribute as permanent members to the \r\ntasks that the Council is called on to undertake. The \r\nbilateral support Chile has extended to countries \r\nseeking new permanent seats is well known. Moreover, \r\nallow me to reaffirm once again our historic position \r\nagainst the veto, which we have held since the creation \r\nof the Organization and which stems from the \r\nfundamental value we attach to the principle of the \r\nequality of States and the democratization of \r\ninternational organizations. \r\n There is no doubt that, under the wise guidance \r\nof facilitator Ambassador Zahir Tanin of Afghanistan, \r\nwhom we commend, we are moving in the right \r\ndirection. We must persevere in these efforts while \r\nexploring options and alternatives in a process of \r\nconstructive and pragmatic negotiations aimed at \r\nachieving results that will allow us to move closer to \r\nthe desired reform. \r\n Mr. Ould Hadrami (Mauritania), Vice-President, \r\ntook the Chair. \r\n In conclusion, allow me to reiterate my country’s \r\nwillingness to continue collaborating in building the \r\nconsensus that will allow the achievement of the \r\nnecessary reform of the Security Council, thereby \r\ncontributing to strengthening the Organization. \r\n Mr. Abay (Ethiopia): My delegation would like \r\nto contribute to today’s joint debate by emphasizing the \r\nreform of the Security Council in particular, which is \r\nobviously of paramount importance both to the African \r\ncontinent and my country. Thus, let me first of all \r\nexpress my delegation’s appreciation to the President \r\nof the Assembly for designating the reform of the \r\nSecurity Council as one of his priorities during his \r\npresidency. Let me also take this opportunity to \r\nwelcome the appointment of His Excellency \r\nAmbassador Zahir Tanin to chair the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on the reform of the Security Council. We \r\nA/65/PV.50  \r\n \r\n10-63473 20 \r\n \r\nare confident that, under the President’s guidance and \r\nAmbassador Tanin’s continued effort and leadership, \r\nthis Assembly will be able to move the reform process \r\nforward towards tangible results during this session. \r\n Ethiopia aligns itself fully with the statements \r\ndelivered by the Permanent Representatives of Sierra \r\nLeone and Egypt on behalf of the Group of African \r\nStates and the Non-Aligned Movement, respectively. \r\n Ethiopia has always accorded great importance to \r\nthe reform of the Security Council, as it is central to \r\nthe overall reform of the United Nations system. There \r\nis no doubt that our efforts and dedication to make the \r\nSecurity Council a more democratic, representative, \r\ninclusive and transparent organ of our Organization \r\nwill only be successful if there is demonstrable \r\npolitical commitment by all Member States. \r\n It is our belief that the text-based \r\nintergovernmental negotiations, which were launched \r\nduring the previous session, should be instrumental in \r\nconcretizing and narrowing down our long-held \r\npositions and proposals on the key issues, which are \r\nwell known to us. In that regard, my delegation is of \r\nthe view that a more streamlined and shorter text \r\nwould help us make substantial progress in the reform \r\nprocess, if all of us engage in the negotiations with a \r\nsense of responsibility, fairness and genuine \r\ncommitment. We are confident that our negotiations \r\ncan lead us to real progress by identifying and dwelling \r\non areas of convergence and avoiding overlapping \r\noptions. \r\n Africa’s common position on how the Security \r\nCouncil should be reformed, including all the key \r\nissues, is unambiguous and remains unchanged. The \r\nEzulwini Consensus clearly stated that the Security \r\nCouncil needs to be enlarged in both the permanent and \r\nthe non-permanent categories and calls for no fewer \r\nthan two permanent seats with all the prerogatives and, \r\nof course, responsibilities of permanent membership, \r\nincluding the right of veto, as well as five non-\r\npermanent seats. \r\n Even though Africa is opposed in principle to the \r\nright of veto, we Africans strongly believe that, as long \r\nas it exists and as a matter of justice, it should be \r\nextended to the new permanent members of the \r\nSecurity Council. It should, however, be noted that the \r\nAfrican Union is responsible for the selection and the \r\ncriteria for Africa’s representatives in the Security \r\nCouncil, taking into consideration the representative \r\nnature and capacity of those chosen. \r\n As has been stated on numerous occasions, the \r\nreform of the Security Council is of paramount \r\nsignificance for African countries. That is clearly the \r\ncase, in that, since the adoption of decision 62/557 by \r\nthe General Assembly, Africa has been engaging \r\ngenuinely in intergovernmental negotiations. We \r\nstrongly believe that due consideration should be given \r\nto the aspirations of our continent, as no African State \r\nhas ever been represented in the permanent \r\nmembership category of the Council. That is not mere \r\nrhetoric but rather a well reasoned and pragmatic \r\nargument that should be seen principally from a \r\nhistorical perspective as well as from the perspective of \r\nthe nature of the Council’s agenda items. \r\n It is to be recalled that, during our previous \r\nnegotiations, the call for the expansion of the Security \r\nCouncil in the permanent and non-permanent \r\ncategories has garnered broad support from the \r\nmajority of Member States. In that regard, other \r\noptions advanced by some Member States, particularly \r\nthe enlargement of the Security Council only in the \r\ncategory of non-permanent seats and the creation of a \r\nnew cluster of non-permanent membership, seem to be \r\nidentical in terms of the minimal contributions those \r\nmembers could make in the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security. Hence, my delegation \r\nis of the view that those approaches not only fall short \r\nof bringing about meaningful reform of the Security \r\nCouncil, but also do not guarantee real expansion in \r\nthe permanent category, thus not responding to Africa’s \r\nrightful demands. \r\n In short, Ethiopia feels that, while negotiating on \r\nthe reform of the Security Council, there will be no \r\nneed to restate or reiterate well-known positions. It \r\nshould be unambiguously clear that Africa expects to \r\nbe taken seriously with regard to its position on the \r\nreform of the Council. The intermediary solution \r\ncannot in any way substitute for the long overdue \r\nfundamental reform of the Security Council. \r\n Mr. Benmehidi (Algeria) (spoke in French): First \r\nof all, I would like to thank the President of the \r\nSecurity Council, the Permanent Representative of the \r\nUnited Kingdom, Ambassador Mark Lyall Grant, for \r\npresenting the Security Council’s annual report \r\n(A/65/2). My thanks go also to the other members of \r\nthe Council for their important contributions to the \r\n A/65/PV.50\r\n \r\n21 10-63473 \r\n \r\npreparation of the report. I would also like to mention \r\nin particular the Nigerian delegation, which went to \r\nespecially great lengths in that regard. My delegation \r\naligns itself with the statement made by the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Sierra Leone on behalf of the Group \r\nof African States. \r\n The theme of the present session of the General \r\nAssembly highlights the importance of the relationship \r\nbetween the General Assembly and the Security \r\nCouncil in defining global governance. My delegation \r\nwould like to note that in the Security Council’s report \r\nthe issues concerning peace and security in Africa \r\ncontinue to dominate the majority of the Security \r\nCouncil’s work. In that respect, we note the importance \r\nof enhancing cooperation between the United Nations \r\nand the African Union in terms of peace and security to \r\ngive the African Union the appropriate capacities, \r\nallowing it to successfully conduct missions \r\nestablished on the basis of Security Council mandates. \r\n In addition, Algeria would like to welcome \r\nmeasures taken by the Security Council during the \r\nperiod covered by the report aimed at bolstering the \r\nframework for the struggle against the financing of \r\nterrorism through the adoption of resolution 1904 \r\n(2009), which clearly stipulates that the payment of \r\nransoms to terrorist groups constitutes a form of \r\nfinancing terrorism, which is covered under the \r\nsanctions regime. Moreover, Algeria welcomes the \r\nestablishment, under resolution 1904 (2009) of the \r\nOffice of the Ombudsperson for the Al-Qaida and \r\nTaliban Sanctions Committee, which is an independent \r\nmechanism responsible for improving the regular \r\nprocedure for the inclusion on the Consolidated List by \r\nreviewing inclusions on the List for their compliance \r\nwith the Committee’s rules and procedures. The \r\ncreation of that Office strengthened the principle of the \r\nrule of law within the United Nations. \r\n Algeria reiterates its commitment to Africa’s \r\naspirations, expressed in the common African position \r\nwith regard to Security Council reform, as set forth in \r\nthe Ezulwini Consensus, for the attribution of no less \r\nthan two permanent seats, with all the accompanying \r\nprivileges and rights of that category, including the \r\nright of veto, as well as five additional non-permanent \r\nseats. The two categories of membership are those \r\nstipulated currently by the Charter. A modification to \r\nany of the characteristics of one of those categories \r\nwould, in fact, lead to the creation of a separate, third \r\ncategory, which should only be created if the Member \r\nStates so decide. \r\n Moreover, my delegation notes here its complete \r\nwillingness to work to promote substantial headway in \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform currently under way, within the context of a \r\nprocess that must continue to be transparent and \r\ninclusive and seek the broadest possible political \r\naccord. It is also important to note the comprehensive \r\nnature of Security Council reform and the close link \r\nthat exists among the various themes and elements of \r\nthe reform. \r\n Algeria remains willing to examine with \r\nopenness the negotiation text drawn up by the \r\nfacilitator, the Permanent Representative of \r\nAfghanistan, Ambassador Tanin, whose perseverance I \r\ncommend, while bearing in mind decisions 62/557 and \r\n63/565 of the General Assembly. \r\n In that connection, I would like to say that it is \r\nimportant for Member States to work to define the \r\nguiding principles underpinning reform before \r\nconsidering the merger of positions or proposals, which \r\ncan only be done with the consent of the States \r\nconcerned, as agreed. \r\n Mr. Onemola (Nigeria): The Nigerian delegation \r\nwishes to express its appreciation to the President for \r\nconvening this plenary joint debate on agenda item 29 \r\non the report of the Security Council (A/65/2) and on \r\nagenda item 119 on Security Council reform. We are \r\nalso grateful to the United Kingdom as President of the \r\nSecurity Council for introducing the report. \r\n It is evident from the report before us that the \r\nSecurity Council had a busy and productive session \r\nduring the period under review. However, the focus of \r\nmy delegation’s statement during this joint debate will \r\nnot be on the activities of the Security Council, but on \r\nits reform. \r\n Nigeria attaches the utmost importance to the \r\nreform of the Security Council and welcomes the \r\nefforts, especially over the past two years, geared \r\ntowards moving the process forward. Those efforts \r\nhave been further reinforced by General Assembly \r\ndecision 64/564 of 13 September, which urged Member \r\nStates to continue intergovernmental negotiations on \r\nthe reform immediately during the sixty-fifth session. \r\nA/65/PV.50  \r\n \r\n10-63473 22 \r\n \r\n In that regard, we would like to express our \r\nappreciation to the President for having reappointed \r\nAmbassador Zahir Tanin as Chair of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. We also thank \r\nAmbassador Tanin for transmitting the second \r\nnegotiation text and for the meeting that he convened \r\non 21 October this year to continue the negotiations. \r\n It is the expectation of my delegation that \r\nsubstantial progress will be achieved during the course \r\nof the current session. We believe that the time has \r\ncome for us to achieve concrete results on those \r\nelements with regard to which consensus has emerged \r\nduring the negotiations. Nigeria therefore calls for a \r\nshorter text encompassing the positions and proposals \r\nalready put forward by Member States. Such a text \r\nwould not only provide clarity on the issues, but also \r\ngive direction and guidance. \r\n The current underrepresentation of Africa is a \r\nclear demonstration of the lack of equity that exists in \r\nthe Security Council. A region with 53 United Nations \r\nMember States remains unrepresented in the permanent \r\ncategory of membership in the Council. It has also not \r\nfared any better in the non-permanent seat category, \r\nwhere it has only three seats. \r\n In that regard, we call for that historical injustice \r\nto be redressed, so that, of the approximately 26 seats \r\nproposed by the majority of Member States for the \r\nexpansion of both the permanent and non-permanent \r\ncategories, Africa should be given special \r\nconsideration and afforded at least two representatives \r\nin the permanent category and five in the \r\nnon-permanent category. Other regions such as the \r\nLatin American and Caribbean States, Asia and the \r\nsmall island developing States, currently \r\nunderrepresented in each category, should also be \r\ngiven their due. \r\n Nigeria, therefore, strongly supports the \r\ncomprehensive reform of the Security Council, and we \r\nbelieve that the current negotiation text contains much \r\nthat can help us to achieve our objective. As \r\nstakeholders, we must strive to bridge the apparent \r\ngaps shown by our differing views. The negotiating \r\nprocess should remain open, transparent, and inclusive, \r\nas well as be conducted in a spirit of flexibility, so that \r\nwe can collectively reach a compromise solution. \r\nNigeria stands committed to the swift reform of the \r\nCouncil. \r\n In that context, we would like to reiterate the \r\nfollowing salient points, which tally with those of an \r\noverwhelming majority of Member States. The \r\npreponderance of views and positions expressed by \r\nMember States, including my delegation, is for the \r\nexpansion of the Council in both the permanent and \r\nnon-permanent categories. There is also a strong \r\nconvergence of positions to the effect that there should \r\nbe expansion of the membership of the Council from \r\nits present 15 members to a range in the mid-20s. \r\n Nigeria supports the reform of the Council’s \r\nworking methods, including measures proposed by the \r\nGroup of Five Small Nations on transparency and \r\naccountability. Nigeria also supports an enhanced \r\nrelationship between the General Assembly and the \r\nSecurity Council in accordance with the Charter \r\nprovisions. \r\n On the question of the veto, our preference is for \r\nthe total abolition of the veto. However, if it is not \r\nabolished, it should be extended to all permanent \r\nmembers of the Council. \r\n To conclude, let me reassure all Member States \r\nthat Nigeria will use its presence in the Council to \r\npromote and maintain international peace and security. \r\nWe will carefully protect the mandate given to us and \r\nput it in the service, not only of Africa, but of the \r\ninternational community as a whole. Our efforts in the \r\nCouncil will be characterized by solidarity, \r\ncooperation, commitment and consultation. \r\n We believe that through forthright determination \r\nwe can all stand and muster the desired political will \r\nthat will lead to the achievement of a reformed \r\nSecurity Council in due course. \r\n Mr. Al-Nasser (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): Allow \r\nme, at the outset, to express to the President our \r\nappreciation for his wise leadership of the General \r\nAssembly, including its relationship with the other \r\nbodies of this international Organization, and for the \r\nimportance he attaches to the issue of Security Council \r\nreform. Allow me also to convey our appreciation to \r\nAmbassador Mark Lyall Grant, President of the \r\nSecurity Council for this month, for introducing the \r\nreport of the Council (A/65/2). My delegation also \r\nassociates itself with the statement made by the \r\nPermanent Representative of Egypt on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement. \r\n A/65/PV.50\r\n \r\n23 10-63473 \r\n \r\n The presentation of the report of the Security \r\nCouncil to the General Assembly is an important issue \r\nand is a direct implementation of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, specifically Article 24, paragraph 3, \r\nwhich states that “the Security Council shall submit \r\nannual and, when necessary, special reports to the \r\nGeneral Assembly for its consideration”. \r\n The fact that the submission of that report is \r\nprovided for in the Charter signifies that that issue is at \r\nthe core of the functions and powers of the Security \r\nCouncil and not just a routine procedural matter. It is \r\ntherefore essential that the Assembly stress the need to \r\nupgrade the annual report from a procedural review of \r\nthe Council’s activities and decisions to an analysis and \r\nassessment of the Council’s activities, covering inter \r\nalia the obstacles it faces in carrying out the mandate \r\nentrusted to it by the Charter and its responsibility \r\ntowards the entire United Nations membership. \r\n On the other hand, the symbolic significance of \r\nthe Security Council submitting at least one annual \r\nreport to the General Assembly is that the enduring \r\ncharacteristic of this international Organization, \r\nregardless of political and practical changes, is that the \r\nGeneral Assembly remains the highest and most \r\ninclusive body of the Organization. Other bodies \r\nshould thus coordinate with it in a comprehensive \r\nmanner, and should not infringe on its powers or \r\nmandates. \r\n One of the most important factors for \r\nstrengthening cooperation and coordination between \r\nthe General Assembly and the Security Council is the \r\npermanent and periodic meetings between the \r\nPresidents of those two bodies, which must be \r\nmaintained, enhanced and be made to include \r\ndiscussions of practical issues. \r\n In terms of Security Council reform, we \r\nrecognize that the majority of Member States hope for \r\nan update of the Council as an integral part of the \r\noverall United Nations reform process, which also \r\nincludes the strengthening and revitalization of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. Even with an agreement on the \r\nneed to update the Council, one notes differences in \r\nviews regarding the call for structural amendments or \r\nadjustments to its working methods. That divergence in \r\npositions is logical and not surprising, given that we \r\nare dealing here with 192 countries. But while we \r\nunderstand that divergence, it remains necessary not to \r\noverlook any of the views expressed by Member \r\nStates, regional groups or other groupings. It would \r\nalso be appropriate, in practice, to heed the position of \r\nthe permanent members of the Council. The \r\nconstructive role of the President of the General \r\nAssembly is to create the appropriate conditions for \r\nconsensus. \r\n We appreciate how difficult that endeavour might \r\nbe, but it is only fair to recognize the evolution that has \r\noccurred since the beginning of the reform process in \r\nthe mid-1990s, in particular the fact that the reform \r\nprocess moved from a closed and informal path to an \r\nintergovernmental one during the sixty-third session of \r\nthe General Assembly. In this regard, it would be \r\nuseful to build on what has been achieved, on the one \r\nhand, while, on the other hand, maintaining consensus. \r\n We would therefore like to express our support \r\nfor the President’s reappointment of Ambassador Zahir \r\nTanin as Chairman of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on Security Council reform. We would \r\nlike to express our deep appreciation to him for the \r\ntremendous efforts that he has deployed, and we wish \r\nhim every success. \r\n We stress the need to assign the necessary \r\npriority to that issue during the current session of the \r\nAssembly as well as in the coming session, in \r\naccordance with the outcome of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations at this session. \r\n Mr. Sin Son Ho (Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea): My delegation is very pleased to join with \r\nother delegations in debating Security Council reform. \r\nIn spite of strenuous efforts by Member States to \r\nreform the Security Council in conformity with the \r\nchanged international situation, the debate on reform \r\ncontinues without any tangible result. In particular, \r\nthere is no progress on the issue of ensuring full \r\nrepresentation for developing countries in the Council. \r\n The Security Council continues to be misused by \r\nspecific countries pursuing their own political purposes \r\nand continues to deal with issues beyond its mandate, \r\nthus losing its credibility with Member States. Today’s \r\nrealities prove once again the urgency of the need for \r\nthe international community to reform the Council, \r\nwhich lacks democracy and does not reflect the \r\nunanimous will of Member States. \r\n What is imperative in the reform process is to put \r\nan end to the misuse of the Security Council by \r\nspecific countries and to the Council’s practice of \r\nA/65/PV.50  \r\n \r\n10-63473 24 \r\n \r\nmaking an issue only of situations in developing \r\ncountries, which is unjustifiable and has even led to the \r\nimposition of coercive measures such as sanctions. \r\n In order to ensure non-selectivity and impartiality \r\nin the activities of the Security Council, a mechanism \r\nmust be established to limit the effect of Council \r\nresolutions to those cases where they have been \r\nendorsed by the General Assembly. The Security \r\nCouncil should also make all its meetings public, \r\nabandon its tendency to revert to informal \r\nconsultations, and ensure impartiality in its discussions \r\nby inviting all interested countries and concerned \r\nparties, to all its consultation processes. \r\n With regard to the enlargement of the Security \r\nCouncil, it is important to ensure full representation of \r\nthe member States of the Non-Aligned Movement and \r\nother developing countries, which constitute after all \r\nan overwhelming majority of the United Nations \r\nmembership, and enlarge the non-permanent category \r\nof membership first, a measure on which it would be \r\neasy to agree. \r\n This is what is required by the reality of the \r\nsituation, as proven by the numerous intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on Security Council reform. When the \r\npermanent membership is enlarged, a country such as \r\nJapan, which continues to avoid admitting to, \r\napologizing for and atoning for its past crimes but \r\nresorts instead to resurrecting its old dream of \r\nmilitarism and distorting and beautifying its past \r\nhistory of aggression, should never be allowed to be a \r\npermanent member of the Council. \r\n In conclusion, the delegation of the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea is confident that, under the \r\nable leadership of the President, realistic and \r\ninnovative proposals aimed at reforming the Security \r\nCouncil will be devised during the current session of \r\nthe General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Mottaghi Nejad (Islamic Republic of Iran): \r\nAt the outset, let me express my gratitude to the \r\nPresident of the Assembly for convening this joint \r\ndebate and for paying due attention to Security Council \r\nreform within the agenda of the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-fifth session. My thanks also go to the \r\nPermanent Representative of Afghanistan, Mr. Zahir \r\nTanin, for all his efforts in presiding as the Chair of the \r\ninformal intergovernmental negotiations in the \r\nAssembly on Council reform, and we express our \r\ngratitude to him for accepting that responsibility for \r\nthe year to come. \r\n My delegation associates itself with the statement \r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement delivered earlier \r\nyesterday by the representative of Egypt, but allow me \r\nto delve into a few more points as well. \r\n Last September, the General Assembly, at one of \r\nthe very last meetings of its resumed session (see \r\nA/64/PV.121), decided to continue intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on Security Council reform immediately \r\nin informal plenary meetings of the Assembly, and His \r\nExcellency Mr. Deiss, in a very symbolic gesture, put \r\nthat decision into practice at the very beginning of the \r\nAssembly’s work at this session, before the joint debate \r\non the issue actually took place in plenary meetings. \r\nThat has symbolic importance in the sense that it \r\nshows the priority that the President of the Assembly \r\nattaches to that issue as an extremely important agenda \r\nitem. \r\n Each year, the General Assembly receives and \r\nconsiders the annual report of the Security Council and \r\nexpresses its views and expectations, as an exercise in \r\nadded value, on the work of the Council. We are here \r\ntoday to consider this year’s report of the Security \r\nCouncil (A/65/2) in conjunction with the question of \r\nequitable representation on and increase in the \r\nmembership of the Security Council and related \r\nmatters. The linkage between the report and the reform \r\nprocess represents the basic objective of a \r\ncomprehensive reform of the Council, namely, to make \r\na more democratic, inclusive, equitably representative, \r\ntransparent, effective and accountable Council. \r\n It is expected that the deliberations of the past \r\nfew years have somehow mirrored, in practical terms, \r\nthe work of the Security Council and its report. \r\nHowever, it seems that the pace of that movement has \r\nbeen rather sluggish. \r\n That does not, of course, seek to deny the \r\nvaluable and extensive work done by the delegations \r\nand the Secretariat on this compilation of the Security \r\nCouncil’s undertakings. What is needed perhaps is to \r\nthink about the ways and means of departing from \r\nmere repetition of the reports of previous years in light \r\nof the objectives and key elements of the reform \r\nprocess. \r\n A/65/PV.50\r\n \r\n25 10-63473 \r\n \r\n An assessment of the history of United Nations \r\nreform reveals the fact that only three amendments \r\nhave been made to the United Nations Charter in the \r\npast six decades, and all of them have dealt only with \r\nthe number of seats. The term “reform” has been used, \r\ndespite the fact that the level of change has been far \r\nfrom the necessary real and comprehensive \r\nconstitutional changes to United Nations policies and \r\nprocedures. \r\n Today, that story could be changed by exploring \r\ndeeper levels of reform, where common ground may \r\nconverge and where we could thus engage in an all-\r\ninclusive manner on substantial issues. In planning for \r\nthe realization of such an objective, there are a few \r\npoints worth exploring. \r\n First, this represents a comprehensive approach. \r\nIt is necessary to respond with respect to all aspects of \r\nSecurity Council reform in order to keep all on board, \r\neven if there is a lengthy stretch of time between those \r\naspects that can be achieved in the relatively short run \r\nand those that can be accomplished only in the longer \r\nrun. It is thus reasonable to carry out a comprehensive \r\nstudy of the old as well as the possible new elements \r\nthat would better reflect the realities of the day in \r\nresponse to all of the key issues of Council reform. \r\nNeedless to say, the underrepresentation of developing \r\ncountries, including the Muslim world, in the Council \r\nneeds to be seriously and satisfactorily addressed. \r\n Secondly, on the elimination of the veto power, \r\nan issue that has come up repeatedly in the statements \r\nof many delegations over the past few years, positive \r\nsigns have already emerged where we see that Member \r\nStates are distancing themselves from the veto power. \r\nThat is observable even among the permanent members \r\nof the Security Council. That fact simply demonstrates \r\nthat there is a strong feeling that the veto, and even \r\nmore, the fear of veto, is an unjust and unconstructive \r\ninstrument in the hands of a few Member States that \r\nundermines the effectiveness of the Council and keeps \r\nit from taking meaningful decisions in many ways. \r\nTherefore, the gradual elimination of the veto power is \r\nan aspect that forms an ideal for almost all delegations. \r\nThoughts and further deliberations on that important \r\nsubject could be explored, elaborated and agreed upon \r\nat a later stage, commencing this year. \r\n Thirdly, a pattern of cooperation between the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council is needed. \r\nThat could be elaborated through a careful and detailed \r\ndefinition of each body’s prerogatives, including those \r\nthat encompass common boundaries, which could be \r\naddressed through collaboration between the two \r\nbodies and should be tackled thoroughly. That needs to \r\nbe done in order to avoid the old but continued de facto \r\nproblem of the encroachment by the Council on the \r\nprerogatives of the other main organs of the United \r\nNations. Furthermore, according to Article 13 of the \r\nUnited Nations Charter, the Assembly, as the chief \r\ndeliberative, policy-making and representative organ of \r\nthe United Nations, is primarily entrusted with the task \r\nof the progressive development and codification of \r\ninternational law. Therefore, norm-setting and law-\r\nmaking by the Council runs counter to the letter and \r\nspirit of the United Nations Charter. That problem \r\ncould be evaluated through an analytical assessment by \r\nthe Secretariat in order to enable an appropriate \r\ndistribution of labour between the Assembly and the \r\nCouncil. \r\n Fourthly, to promote the working methods of the \r\nSecurity Council and honour the responsibility of the \r\nCouncil as regards to the rights of non-Council \r\nmembers, a number of measures have already been \r\ntaken that could be charted and elaborated as short-\r\nterm objectives. They include permitting non-Council \r\nmembers to participate in discussions on matters \r\naffecting them and their interests; allowing concerned \r\ncountries the right to brief the Council on their \r\npositions on issues having a direct effect on their \r\nnational interests; providing non-selective notification \r\nof Council meetings and convening regular daily \r\nbriefings; and considering the right of reply for \r\ncountries against whom allegations are raised during \r\ncertain formats of the Council’s meetings. \r\n According to Article 24 of the United Nations \r\nCharter, the Council’s decisions should reflect the \r\nwishes and views of the general membership. For that \r\nreason, the general membership, and particularly the \r\nconcerned countries, should be informed of the \r\nnegotiations on resolutions or statements directly \r\naffecting them. \r\n On the other hand, the Council’s mandate is not \r\nunlimited or above the law. It is bound by the Charter, \r\nand thus the Council should not act against the spirit \r\nand letter of its commitment to exercise its powers in \r\naccordance with the purposes and principles of the \r\nCharter. It should refrain from interfering in the \r\ninternal affairs of Member States and from making \r\ndecisions based on unauthentic information, politically \r\nA/65/PV.50  \r\n \r\n10-63473 26 \r\n \r\nmotivated analysis or the narrow national interest \r\npriorities of some Member States. Such acts would \r\ndefinitely undermine the Council’s credibility and \r\nreputation, damage the legitimacy of its decisions and \r\nharm the trust of Member States in that important \r\norgan of the Organization. \r\n Finally, it is often said that the United Nations is \r\nso consumed with getting the process right that it \r\nneglects the consequences. Today we need to sum up \r\nand streamline the consequences of the working agenda \r\nin order to make the whole process of reform \r\nmeaningful and complete. In fact, no Council reform \r\nwill be successful unless and until all major issues are \r\nappropriately, comprehensively and exclusively \r\naddressed. Every effort should be made to render the \r\nSecurity Council more democratic, representative and \r\naccountable. Let me assure the President of the full \r\ncooperation of my delegation to achieve those short \r\nand long-term objectives. \r\n Mr. Šćepanović (Montenegro): At the outset, let \r\nme express Montenegro’s full support for the \r\nPresident’s initiative to make global governance and \r\nUnited Nations reform a central theme of the \r\nAssembly’s current session. We commend him for his \r\nefforts in that respect and also for the timely \r\norganization of today’s debate on one of the vital issues \r\nof the overall reform of the United Nations system. We \r\nhope that today’s discussion will give fresh impetus to \r\nthe negotiation process on this important subject, \r\nwhich at its core aims to reinstate the United Nations at \r\nthe centre of global governance. \r\n I would like to thank the current President of the \r\nSecurity Council, Ambassador Sir Mark Lyall Grant of \r\nthe United Kingdom, for presenting the report of the \r\nSecurity Council (A/65/2). \r\n Montenegro, the youngest Member of the United \r\nNations, attaches meaningful importance to the issue of \r\nUnited Nations reform, while fully respecting the \r\nimportance of the reform process to all Members of the \r\nOrganization. In that context, we consider reform of \r\nthe Security Council particularly significant, especially \r\nin the light of the belief of a large majority that the \r\nstatus quo will be hard to maintain, since new global \r\nchallenges and realities require new approaches and \r\nresponses that adequately reflect the current state of \r\nworld affairs. \r\n Montenegro sees a valid and legitimate \r\nfoundation for Security Council reform in the \r\nprinciples and purposes of the United Nations Charter, \r\nthe Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2) and in the \r\nrecommendations of the World Summit Outcome \r\n(resolution 60/1). We also welcome the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s determination and proposals in this regard. \r\nSecurity Council reform can be considered a basic \r\nelement of the overall efforts for United Nations \r\nreform so that it may attain wider and more appropriate \r\nrepresentation and increased legitimacy, responsibility, \r\ntransparency and efficiency. In that regard, my country \r\nbelieves it is encouraging that multilateralism again \r\nranks high among the priorities of lead countries in the \r\nworld. \r\n Security Council reform is an ongoing process \r\nthat requires an active role and a flexible approach by \r\nall Member States and regional groups. Montenegro \r\nsupports expanding the membership of the Security \r\nCouncil with the goal of securing equitable \r\nrepresentation of all regional groups as an authentic \r\nreflection of new global circumstances. \r\n My country highly regards this reality, especially \r\nthe current constellation of power, with the aim of \r\nachieving consensus. Consensus itself must incorporate \r\nand recognize the growing role of the immense new \r\nactors alongside the traditional Permanent Five, and \r\nalso the wider emancipation of the larger affiliations of \r\nsmall and medium-sized countries. In particular, the \r\nposition of Africa must be appropriately addressed in \r\nthe future reformed Security Council. \r\n Our Eastern European Group has grown from 11 \r\nto 23 members. Montenegro points to that new reality, \r\nas that Group needs to be more adequately represented \r\nin the Council. And that translates into getting another \r\nnon-permanent seat. Based on its national interests, and \r\nexpressing solidarity with our regional group, \r\nMontenegro stands ready to actively, responsibly and \r\nin good faith support, participate in and contribute to \r\nthe reform process. Our position of accountability can \r\nbe viewed in the light of our own candidature for the \r\nSecurity Council for the term 2026 and 2027. \r\n My country recognizes the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations as a chance for a qualitative deepening of \r\nthe process, as well as an opportunity for small \r\ncountries to voice their opinions and articulate their \r\ninterests. We welcome the negotiation text, which \r\ncontains all of the proposals made by Member States \r\n A/65/PV.50\r\n \r\n27 10-63473 \r\n \r\nsince the process to move forward the text-based \r\nsolution was opened. We take this opportunity to \r\nconvey our appreciation to Ambassador Tanin for the \r\nmanner in which he has been steering and conducting \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations. \r\n However, my delegation would like to stress that \r\nnow that all positions have been incorporated into the \r\ntext, it is time to converge our views and take decisive \r\naction, which must have broad legitimacy. It must be \r\nforeseen that substantive negotiations will soon be \r\nnecessary if further and visible progress is to be \r\nachieved. Therefore, we must remain engaged and join \r\nour efforts in order to find the most suitable modalities \r\nto conduct negotiations, which must have overall \r\nsupport so that we will all be in position to benefit. Let \r\nme assure the Assembly that Montenegro will certainly \r\nbe a constructive and reliable partner along that path. \r\n Mr. Vaz Patto (Portugal): I wish to thank the \r\nPresident for convening this joint debate on the agenda \r\nitems “Report of the Security Council” and “Question \r\nof equitable representation on and increase in the \r\nmembership of the Security Council and related \r\nmatters”. I would also like to express our gratitude to \r\nthe President of the Security Council, Ambassador \r\nLyall Grant, for his introduction of the annual report of \r\nthe Security Council (A/65/2). \r\n The meeting called today by the President bears \r\nupon a matter that is very important to the United \r\nNations membership. The General Assembly is \r\nconsidering the annual report of the Security Council, \r\nthe body entrusted by the United Nations Charter with \r\nthe primary responsibility for the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security. The exercise we are \r\nengaged in is a formal expression of the Council’s \r\naccountability to the Assembly. \r\n It is the duty of the Security Council to submit an \r\nannual report. And it is up to the Assembly — to us — \r\nto receive and consider it. The work of the Council is \r\ncentral to the United Nations agenda. The general \r\nmembership follows its work closely, calling for more \r\ntransparency, openness and interactivity. It is a \r\nrecurrent call, which reflects the interest paid to the \r\nCouncil’s work and its relevance in international \r\naffairs. We must pay tribute to the efforts of many \r\nCouncil members, in particular those non-permanent \r\nmembers who have been pushing this agenda from \r\nwithin the Council as well. \r\n Much has been accomplished, as the Council’s \r\nmore recent practice seems to reflect. And we know \r\nhow difficult it is to change long-established practices. \r\nThe work carried out by the Council’s Informal \r\nWorking Group on Documentation and Other \r\nProcedural Questions in recent years is to be \r\ncommended. In particular, we welcome the work \r\ncarried out and the results obtained during the period \r\nunder consideration today. It represents further \r\nprogress in the right direction, while, as always, the \r\nwork is far from being completed — if it may ever be. \r\n But the work achieved so far is the reflection of \r\nthe debate that has been taking place in the General \r\nAssembly on the reform of working methods. Many \r\nhave contributed to this debate here. Let me commend \r\ntheir efforts by mentioning the relevant work of \r\nLiechtenstein, Singapore, Costa Rica, Jordan and \r\nSwitzerland — the group of five small nations — on \r\nthis concept. \r\n Today, we are addressing accountability. The \r\nlevel of interest of the general membership on that \r\npoint is clearly reflected by the number of speakers \r\nparticipating in this debate. They reflect the importance \r\nattached to the Council’s work and the clear \r\nassumption of the responsibility that is entrusted to us. \r\nWhile some may say that working methods are a matter \r\nfor the Council to consider — a view that we do not \r\nshare — it seems clear that accountability is a duty of \r\nthe Security Council in which the General Assembly \r\nnaturally has a central role to play. In that regard, both \r\norgans can and should do more. \r\n First of all, accountability should be a constant \r\nconcern of the Council and its members. It should not \r\nbe confined to a once-a-year formal exercise such as \r\nthis. The United Nations Charter even suggests a more \r\nactive practice, calling for special reports. \r\n Accountability is also a duty of each Member \r\nState that serves in the Council, acting on behalf of the \r\ngeneral membership as required by the Charter. Here, \r\ntoo, there is room for significant improvements. The \r\nrole of the President of the Security Council in that \r\nregard should be enhanced, giving her or him more \r\nleeway to interact with the larger membership. The \r\nPresidents’ assessments — which Portugal was proud \r\nto push forward with others as a new idea that started \r\nin 1997 — are still part of the annual report, while they \r\nvary in informative contents. They should reflect to a \r\ngreater extent the substance of the views of each \r\nA/65/PV.50  \r\n \r\n10-63473 28 \r\n \r\npresidency on the monthly work of the Council, its \r\nachievements and shortcomings. \r\n For our part, we are ready to assume the \r\nresponsibility to further this work in the General \r\nAssembly and in the Council and to give, with the \r\ncontribution of others, a more concrete meaning to \r\naccountability. \r\n Let me also express Portugal’s sincere thanks to \r\nthe President for having made reform of the Security \r\nCouncil a priority in the agenda of the General \r\nAssembly. I want also to stress the importance of the \r\ndesignation of Ambassador Zahir Tanin to continue his \r\nwork as facilitator of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations as well as of the early launch of the \r\nprocess in this session. I want to express Portugal’s \r\ndeep appreciation for his work last year and for the \r\nresults he led us to achieve. \r\n I want also to stress Portugal’s full commitment \r\nto continuing the work and promptly concluding the \r\nlong-overdue reform of the Security Council, a reform \r\nthat will adequately reflect present-day geopolitical \r\nrealities and the legitimate aspirations of Member \r\nStates and that will garner the agreement of the \r\ninternational community. \r\n Mr. Loulichki (Morocco) (spoke in Arabic): At \r\nthe outset, allow me to voice my satisfaction to be able \r\nto speak under the presidency of Mr. Deiss. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n I would like to thank the Ambassador of the \r\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, \r\nSir Mark Lyall Grant, for his comprehensive \r\npresentation of the annual report of the Security \r\nCouncil (A/65/2) to the General Assembly. \r\n My delegation endorses the statement made by \r\nthe representatives of Egypt and Sierra Leone on behalf \r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement and the Group of \r\nAfrican States, respectively (see A/65/PV.48). \r\n Today’s debate allows us to study two important \r\nissues that are intimately linked with one another: the \r\nannual report and Security Council reform. \r\n On reform, I would like to thank the Ambassador \r\nof Afghanistan, Mr. Zahir Tanin, for his excellent work \r\nas facilitator and to say how pleased we are that he has \r\nbeen reappointed to that function by the current \r\nPresident of the General Assembly. It is not at all an \r\neasy job. \r\n Security Council reform is dictated by profound \r\nchanges in international relations and by the need for \r\nthat important United Nations body to better discharge \r\nits primary responsibility of maintaining international \r\npeace and security. We believe that more equitable \r\nrepresentation of developing countries, from the \r\nAfrican continent and from the Arab and Muslim world \r\nin particular, has become a need that any reform must \r\nintegrate and take into consideration. It is certain that a \r\nSecurity Council that is more representative of the \r\nvarious regions and different cultures will have \r\nenhanced credibility and stronger moral credibility. \r\n Expansion of the Council should be based, \r\nfurthermore, on the fundamental principle of equitable \r\ngeographic representation and on the contribution of \r\npotential members to maintaining international peace \r\nand security and their ability to take a positive role in \r\npreventing conflicts, peacefully settling disputes and \r\nmaintaining and building peace, as well as in relation \r\nto achieving other goals of the United Nations. \r\n We have taken note of the Council’s efforts to \r\nintroduce more effectiveness and transparency into its \r\nworking methods, as well as into its interactions with \r\nMember States that are not members of the Council. \r\nWe commend the serious work carried out to that end \r\nby the delegation of Japan, Chair of the Council’s \r\nInformal Working Group on Documentation and Other \r\nProcedural Questions. \r\n I now turn to the report of the Security Council. \r\nThe report gives us an outline of the various activities \r\nconducted and decisions taken by the Council in \r\ndischarging its mandate. We must note that threats to \r\ninternational peace and security — limited in the past \r\nprimarily to inter-State disputes — have for a number \r\nof years now assumed multiple and complex forms. In \r\nlight of that, the Council must continue to seek \r\ninnovative responses to non-traditional threats that \r\naffect societies at their very core. \r\n With regard to peacekeeping — the Council’s \r\nprincipal instrument for discharging its mandate — it is \r\ncertain that the complexity of current peace missions \r\ninvolves both the establishment or maintenance of \r\npeace and post-conflict peacebuilding. It requires an \r\nintegrated approach that combines the adoption of clear \r\nand workable mandates, deployment of sufficient \r\nmilitary and civil resources and the granting of \r\nadequate financing. The drawing up of strategies for \r\neach mission is a prerequisite for its success. \r\n A/65/PV.50\r\n \r\n29 10-63473 \r\n \r\n During the reporting period, the Council has \r\ncontinued to address the situation in the Middle East, \r\nparticularly the question of Palestine. We followed \r\nwith hope and encouragement the efforts of the United \r\nStates Administration, together with the Palestinian \r\nAuthority’s responsible position supported by the Arab \r\ncountries, that led to the relaunching of direct peace \r\nnegotiations between Israelis and Palestinians on \r\n2 September in Washington. However, the persistence \r\nof the Israeli Government in its illegal settlement \r\npolicy, including in Al-Quds, reduces to zero the \r\nchances of negotiations being resumed, as shown by \r\nthe recent decision of the Israeli Government to build \r\n1,300 new housing units in the eastern part of Al-Quds, \r\nwhich has a majority Palestinian population. \r\n The Kingdom of Morocco, whose King \r\nMohammed VI presides over the Al-Quds Committee, \r\nreiterates its profound concern at the illegal acts by the \r\nIsraeli authorities in eastern Al-Quds with the intention \r\nof altering the demographic composition of the Holy \r\nCity. My country believes that only the establishment \r\nof a Palestinian State on the basis of relevant \r\ninternational legal decisions and the Arab Peace \r\nInitiative, with Al-Quds as its capital, as well as the \r\nwithdrawal of Israel from the other occupied Arab \r\nterritories, will guarantee lasting peace in the region. \r\n We note, as we have in the past, that issues \r\nrelated to the African continent continue, unfortunately, \r\nto occupy a major part of the Council’s agenda. That in \r\nno way diminishes the achievement of several African \r\nStates that, with the help of the Council and the \r\ninternational community, have made commendable \r\nprogress in emerging from crises and conflicts that \r\nhave long plagued them. \r\n We call on the Council to persist in and enhance \r\nits efforts, using approaches tailored to dealing with \r\neach situation on its own merits, to assist the African \r\ncountries concerned in their quest for peace, stability \r\nand development. The Council’s role in providing \r\nsupport and encouragement remains vital in helping the \r\nparties involved in conflict or disputes to seek \r\nsolutions that are politically acceptable by all. \r\nExperience has shown that such solutions are fleeting \r\nor unattainable if requirements that they be reached \r\nrealistically and in a spirit of compromise are not met. \r\n It must be acknowledged that the contribution \r\nand sincere cooperation of neighbouring countries are \r\nindispensable in order to reach lasting solutions to the \r\nconflicts and disputes that hinder the process of the \r\nintegration and development of entire regions in \r\nAfrica. That is even more important when we consider \r\nthe increasing and troubling threat in certain regions of \r\nthe continent, such as the Sahelo-Saharan region, \r\nwhere only an inclusive, concerted approach can \r\nensure the effectiveness and viability of efforts against \r\nthe acts of terrorist groups that undermine the security \r\nof the States of the region. \r\n Morocco has made promoting African issues a \r\npriority of its international agenda. It has spared no \r\neffort in its support for Council initiatives aimed at \r\npeacekeeping and peacebuilding in Africa. I can assure \r\nthe Assembly that the Kingdom of Morocco will \r\nremain steadfast in its commitment to the United \r\nNations for the achievement of the goals for which it \r\nwas created. \r\n The Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on the items under consideration. \r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly takes note of \r\nthe report of the Security Council contained in \r\ndocument A/65/2? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The Acting President: Two representatives have \r\nasked for the floor to exercise the right of reply. May I \r\nremind members that statements in exercise of the right \r\nof reply are limited to 10 minutes for the first \r\nintervention and 5 minutes for the second, and should \r\nbe made by delegations from their seats. \r\n Mr. Kodama (Japan): I am compelled to state \r\nthat Japan cannot accept the allegations made by the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea. \r\n First, Japan firmly believes that the qualifications \r\nof any country for permanent membership in the \r\nSecurity Council should be based on that country’s real \r\ncontribution to the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security. Since joining the United Nations, Japan, \r\nas a nation committed to peace, has been making a \r\nserious effort to meet that standard, contributing \r\nactively and constructively to the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security. \r\n Secondly, regarding the reference by the \r\nrepresentative of the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea to the unfortunate past, my delegation cannot \r\naccept his comment, considering that Japan has been \r\naddressing its past sincerely and consistently since the \r\nend of the Second World War. To that end, for more \r\nA/65/PV.50  \r\n \r\n10-63473 30 \r\n \r\nthan 65 years Japan has consistently dedicated itself to \r\npromoting international peace and prosperity as well as \r\ndemonstrating its respect for democracy and human \r\nrights. Japan stands ready at all times to contribute \r\nactively and constructively to international peace and \r\nsecurity. \r\n Mr. Yun Yong Il (Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea): My delegation would like to exercise its \r\nright of reply concerning the remark made the \r\ndelegation of Japan. \r\n The Japanese delegation says that its Government \r\nhas apologized for past crimes in this international \r\nforum when the issue of past crimes has been raised. \r\nThat argument, however, is aimed simply at avoiding \r\nits responsibility and denouncing the international \r\ncommunity. \r\n As is well known, Japan is the only country in the \r\nworld that has not admitted, apologized or \r\ncompensated for the enormous crimes against humanity \r\ncommitted in the past. During its colonial rule over \r\nKorea, Japan illegally drafted 8.4 million Koreans into \r\nforced labour, killed one million and forced 200,000 \r\nyoung Korean women and girls to serve as sex slaves \r\nfor the Japanese imperial army. \r\n Furthermore, Japan blatantly challenges the \r\ninternational community’s just demand for settlement \r\nof its past crimes. Officials of successive Japanese \r\nGovernments, including its Prime Ministers, continue, \r\nwithout exception, to visit the Yasukuni Shrine, \r\ndedicated to soldiers who died in wartime, particularly \r\nthose killed in the Second World War. Highly placed \r\nright-wing Japanese politicians openly whitewash the \r\ncountry’s criminal wars of aggression as just wars \r\ndesigned to protect and liberate other Asian countries \r\nfrom Western Powers. They even resort to describing \r\nthe systematic sex slavery established for the Japanese \r\nimperial army as deeds perpetrated by individual \r\nbusinessmen and voluntary commercial activity by \r\nprostitutes. \r\n As everyone knows, on 9 April 2009, Japan \r\npublished another middle-school textbook justifying its \r\naggression and colonial rule over Korea and distorting \r\nsuch historical facts as sex slavery and forcible \r\nconscription. That textbook openly describes the \r\nPacific war as the Greater East Asian War, preaching \r\nthe revival of the old spirit of militarism and stating \r\nthat Japan was a victim, unavoidably involved in the \r\nwar as a result of the acts of the Western Powers, \r\nincluding the United States and United Kingdom. \r\nThose are a few examples of how Japan is trying to \r\nconceal its past crimes and evade its responsibilities. \r\n Japan continues to state that the qualifications for \r\npotential new Security Council members will be \r\nevaluated on the basis of their contribution to \r\ninternational activity. That means that Japan has \r\nsufficient such qualifications. Such logic is simply not \r\nunderstandable in our world. A country that denies its \r\npast crimes will commit such crimes again. That is the \r\nlesson we have learned from history. Even today, Japan \r\nis doing its best to claim the Dokdo islets, which are \r\npart of Korean territory. In that regard, my delegation \r\nbelieves that Japan can no longer be allowed to talk \r\nabout a permanent seat on the Security Council. \r\n Mr. Kodama (Japan): Since we have explained \r\nour position on the issues that the delegation of the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea has just raised \r\nhere and also in the Third Committee, we will not \r\nrepeat it now. \r\n However, we cannot accept the baseless \r\nstatement that the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea has made here today, using unseemly \r\nexpressions and vulgar language. It is regrettable that \r\nthe delegation of the Democratic People’s Republic is \r\ntaking advantage of this meeting in order to advance its \r\naccusations against Japan, while all the Member State \r\nis sincerely discussing is the issue of Security Council \r\nreform and the report of the Security Council. \r\n Mr. Yun Yong Il (Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea): The Japanese delegation should take note \r\nthat the crime committed already is the one to be \r\naddressed. A crime once committed does not disappear \r\nby itself with time; it can be thought of as having \r\ndisappeared only once it has been clearly settled. \r\n The Acting President: The General Assembly \r\nhas thus concluded this stage of its consideration of \r\nagenda item 29 and agenda item 119. \r\n \r\nProgramme of work \r\n \r\n The Acting President: I should like to consult \r\nmembers regarding an extension of the work of the \r\nSpecial Political and Decolonization Committee \r\n(Fourth Committee). \r\n Members will recall that at its 2nd plenary \r\nmeeting, on 17 September 2010, the General Assembly \r\napproved the recommendation of the General \r\n A/65/PV.50\r\n \r\n31 10-63473 \r\n \r\nCommittee that the Special Political and \r\nDecolonization Committee (Fourth Committee) should \r\ncomplete its work by Wednesday, 10 November 2010. \r\nHowever, I have been informed by the Chairman of the \r\nSpecial Political and Decolonization Committee \r\n(Fourth Committee) that the Committee was not able to \r\ncomplete its work by Wednesday, 10 November, and \r\nwould need an additional meeting on Monday, \r\n15 November, depending on the availability of \r\nconference services. \r\n May I therefore take it that the General Assembly \r\nagrees to extend the work of the Special Political and \r\nDecolonization Committee (Fourth Committee) for one \r\nadditional meeting? \r\n There being no objection, it is so decided. \r\n  The meeting rose at 1.10 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
