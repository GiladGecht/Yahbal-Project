Clearly, all of the discussions and outcomes of \r\nthese major conferences and summits have been \r\nchannelled to the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs), which have become the international \r\ncommunity’s most comprehensive and powerful action \r\nplan. Just two months ago, in this same venue, world \r\nleaders reaffirmed their commitment to the MDGs and \r\nset out a concrete action plan for achieving those Goals \r\nby 2015. One of the tangible achievements of the \r\nsummit was undoubtedly to raise over $40 billion in \r\nresources over the next five years in order to \r\nstrengthen child and maternal health. \r\n However, from our perspective, another \r\nimportant milestone that our leaders set up was to \r\ndeliver a clear message to the global community about \r\nthe type of economic growth that will lead to poverty \r\neradication and the achievement of the MDGs. We note \r\nthat growth is an important driving force for the \r\nachievement of the MDGs and poverty eradication, but \r\nnot every kind of growth has been as effective as we \r\nexpected. \r\n There are key policies or mechanisms that can \r\ntranslate growth into progress on the MDGs. First, in \r\norder to contribute to poverty eradication and progress \r\non the MDGs, needless to say, growth should be \r\nsustained without any halt or reversal. \r\n Secondly, if growth does not guarantee the \r\nparticipation of the broadest possible spectrum of \r\npeople and excludes marginalized people or regions, it \r\ncannot properly expedite poverty reduction and may \r\nweaken national unity. Therefore, growth should be as \r\ninclusive as possible. \r\nA/65/PV.52  \r\n \r\n10-64830 2 \r\n \r\n Thirdly, growth cannot be a central strategy for \r\nfighting poverty if it does not evenly distribute the \r\nopportunities and gains it offers. As a recent survey \r\nshows, in circumstances where the poverty rate and \r\ngrowth rate are the same, an inequitable society may \r\ntake six times longer to eradicate poverty than a more \r\nequitable society might. That is why world leaders \r\nhave declared that sustained, inclusive and equitable \r\neconomic growth is the key to poverty eradication and \r\nthe achievement of the MDGs. They have sent a clear \r\nmessage that economic growth should enable everyone, \r\nin particular the poor, to participate in and benefit from \r\neconomic opportunities leading to job creation and \r\nincome opportunities, complemented by effective \r\nsocial policies. \r\n Now it is our turn to carry this message forward. \r\nIn this regard, I have the honour and privilege to \r\nintroduce for adoption today the draft resolution \r\ncontained in document A/65/L.12, entitled “Sustained, \r\ninclusive and equitable economic growth for poverty \r\neradication and achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals” on behalf of the 70 sponsors \r\nlisted in the document, including the Government of \r\nthe Republic of Korea. \r\n At this time, I would also like to name the other \r\ncountries that have since signed on as sponsors of the \r\ndraft resolution but are not listed in the text itself. \r\nThose countries are Andorra, Armenia, Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina, Brazil, Croatia, the Dominican Republic, \r\nEl Salvador, Guatemala, Israel, Liechtenstein, \r\nMadagascar, Mexico, Qatar, the Russian Federation, \r\nSerbia, South Africa, Togo and Uzbekistan. \r\n I thank all sponsoring countries for their \r\nunwavering support and cooperation. In particular, I \r\nwould like to express special appreciation to the \r\n12 countries — Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, China, \r\nIndonesia, Japan, the Lao People’s Democratic \r\nRepublic, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, \r\nSingapore, Thailand and Viet Nam — that together \r\ninitiated the draft resolution from scratch and closely \r\ncooperated as needed. \r\n All sponsors share the view that we need to \r\nstrengthen discussion on the economic dimension of \r\ndevelopment in order to complement and create \r\nsynergy with the discussion of the human dimension of \r\ndevelopment. Also, we concur that, in order to translate \r\ninto action our leaders’ declaration on the importance \r\nof sustained, inclusive, equitable growth, we urgently \r\nneed to formulate policy guidelines that aim to \r\nencourage institutions and policies favourable to \r\nsustained growth, maximize the impact of growth on \r\nhealth, education and gender equality, and devise \r\nspecific policies that will necessarily allow the poor to \r\ngain their fair share. \r\n The draft resolution that we are introducing today \r\nis a follow-up to the High-level Plenary Meeting of the \r\nGeneral Assembly on the MDGs and also a procedural \r\nresolution that asks for the facilitation of an active \r\ndiscussion on sustained, inclusive and equitable \r\neconomic growth. In order to do that, the draft seeks to \r\nfacilitate this discussion by inviting Member States to \r\nshare best practices and lessons learned, inviting \r\nregional commissions to facilitate a discussion of this \r\nissue in each region, requesting the Economic and \r\nSocial Council to hold a panel discussion during the \r\n2011 substantive session and, finally, requesting the \r\nSecretary-General to include policy recommendations \r\non this issue in his annual report on the MDGs by \r\n2015. Based on the expected discussion, we will be \r\nable to extract important and detailed policy elements \r\nfor the successful achievement of sustained, inclusive \r\nand equitable economic growth. \r\n Before closing, I would like once again to express \r\nmy deep, sincere gratitude to the many sponsors and \r\nsupporters of the draft resolution. I now call upon the \r\nGeneral Assembly to give its unequivocal support to its \r\nadoption. \r\n Mr. Le Luong Minh (Viet Nam): I have the \r\nhonour to deliver this statement on behalf of the \r\n13 initial sponsors of draft resolution A/65/L.12 on \r\nsustained, inclusive and equitable economic growth for \r\nthe eradication of poverty and the achievement of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), namely, \r\nBrunei Darussalam, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, \r\nJapan, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, \r\nMalaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, the Republic of \r\nKorea, Singapore, Thailand and Viet Nam. \r\n We attach great importance to the achievement of \r\nthe MDGs while promoting regional integration and \r\nnarrowing the development gap. We provided \r\nconstructive inputs based on regional experiences to \r\nthe High-level Plenary Meeting of the General \r\nAssembly with a view to accelerating progress towards \r\nthe MDGs, especially through strengthened global \r\npartnership. \r\n A/65/PV.52\r\n \r\n3 10-64830 \r\n \r\n On the sidelines of the High-level Plenary \r\nMeeting, we — the 13 countries from South-East Asia \r\nand East Asia — hosted a ministerial-level panel \r\ndiscussion on 21 September on “Achieving the MDGs \r\nthrough partnership, sharing experiences and \r\nchallenges in Asia”, chaired by His Excellency \r\nMr. Kasit Piromya, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nThailand, and moderated by Ms. Nila Moeloek, the \r\nIndonesian President’s Special Envoy for the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. Among measures \r\nidentified in the resulting way forward, we agreed that \r\n“emphasis should be placed on reducing poverty \r\nthrough sustained economic growth”. \r\n While recognizing the diversities within and \r\namong countries, including on how to achieve the \r\nMDGs, we are united in the view that economic growth \r\nshould be given higher priority in the discussions on \r\nthe MDGs. Despite slow and fragile global recovery \r\nfrom the worst international financial crisis, the East \r\nAsian economies were among the first to rebound \r\nsoundly and became some of the key drivers of the \r\nglobal economic recovery. \r\n At the same time, we are placing greater \r\nemphasis on the kind of growth that enables everyone \r\nto benefit equally from economic development, with \r\njob creation and social protection measures aiming at \r\nprotecting and empowering people and communities, \r\nthe most vulnerable groups in particular. This is a \r\nlesson learned from the Asian monetary and economic \r\ncrisis that our region experienced in the late 1990s. \r\n Recently, the seventeenth Summit of the \r\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) held \r\nin Hanoi, Viet Nam, on 28 October 2010 adopted the \r\nMaster Plan on ASEAN Connectivity, which \r\nemphasizes that policies for sustained strong growth \r\nwill have to be complemented by targeted interventions \r\nand will require increased investment in basic \r\ninfrastructure, health care and education. Furthermore, \r\nthe thirteenth ASEAN+3 Summit held in Hanoi, \r\nViet Nam, on 29 October 2010 reaffirmed the \r\nimportance of promoting regional economic \r\ncompetitiveness and equitable economic development. \r\n We are pleased that the notion of “sustained, \r\ninclusive and equitable economic growth” was \r\nincluded in the Outcome Document of the United \r\nNations High-level Plenary Meeting on the MDGs \r\n(resolution 65/1), and further encouraged by the \r\nsupport given to draft resolution A/65/L.12 to promote \r\nthe sharing of national experiences and best practices \r\non this subject, taking into account the fact that there is \r\nno one-size-fits-all solution. \r\n We are pleased to announce that the draft \r\nresolution is currently co-sponsored by 75 countries. \r\nWe wish to thank all the sponsors for their constructive \r\nengagement and contributions. We encourage all other \r\nMember States to consider joining the ownership of the \r\ndraft resolution. By initiating the draft resolution, we \r\nhope that useful policy guidelines will be shared, and \r\nwe look forward to the contributions of the regional \r\ncommissions and the Economic and Social Council \r\npanel discussion. We remain fully committed to \r\nsupporting this process with a view to contributing to \r\npoverty eradication and the achievement of the MDGs \r\nwithin the established time frame. \r\n Mr. Al-Shami (Yemen): The Group of 77 and \r\nChina is pleased to participate in this morning’s joint \r\ndebate under the agenda item “Follow-up to the \r\noutcome of the Millennium Summit”. \r\n The Group of 77 and China places a high priority \r\non global public health and the achievement of health-\r\nrelated Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). We \r\nwelcome the significant achievements made in some \r\nareas, but also note that much more needs to be done to \r\nachieve the health-related Goals, as was evident at the \r\nHigh-level Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly \r\nheld in September. \r\n Factors such as poverty, coupled with the effects \r\nof the global food, financial and economic crises, have \r\nseverely hampered the efforts of developing countries \r\nin implementing the internationally agreed development \r\ngoals and commitments, including the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. \r\n Health and poverty are interlinked and are central \r\nto sustainable development, as recognized in the \r\nMinisterial Declaration of the 2009 High-level \r\nSegment of the Economic and Social Council. The \r\nemergence of non-communicable diseases, the \r\nprevalence of which is increasing faster in poor \r\ncountries, highlights the connection between health and \r\npoverty and its impact on social and economic \r\ndevelopment. Thus, the Group of 77 and China will \r\nfocus its statement on the issue of non-communicable \r\ndiseases, one of the main challenges to development in \r\nthe twenty-first century. \r\nA/65/PV.52  \r\n \r\n10-64830 4 \r\n \r\n The Group of 77 and China thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for the transmission of the report of the \r\nDirector-General of the World Health Organization \r\n(WHO) on the global status of non-communicable \r\ndiseases, with a particular focus on the development \r\nchallenges faced by developing countries (see \r\nA/65/362). \r\n We note all the relevant resolutions and decisions \r\nadopted by the World Health Assembly on the \r\nprevention and control of non-communicable diseases. \r\nThe Group of 77 and China support the call for \r\ncontinued implementation of the 2008-2013 Action \r\nPlan for the Global Strategy for the Prevention and \r\nControl of Non-communicable Diseases, the WHO \r\nFramework Convention on Tobacco Control and the \r\nGlobal Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and Health. \r\nWe also recognize the role of the United Nations \r\nsystem, the Bretton Woods institutions, the private \r\nsector and civil society in the promotion of public \r\nhealth at all levels. \r\n The General Assembly’s unanimous adoption on \r\n13 May of resolution 64/265, on the prevention and \r\ncontrol of non-communicable diseases, which was \r\nsubmitted under agenda item 114, “Follow-up to the \r\noutcome of the Millennium Summit”, clearly \r\nunderscored the need for concerted action and \r\ncoordinated responses to this issue. \r\n As the report of the Director-General of WHO \r\ndetails, non-communicable diseases affect countries in \r\nevery region of the world, from the Americas to the \r\nEastern Mediterranean, Europe, South-East Asia and \r\nthe Western Pacific. While we take note of the various \r\nnational and regional initiatives undertaken on the \r\nprevention and control of non-communicable diseases, \r\nthe statistics are daunting and paint a clear picture of \r\nthe great human suffering and the financial toll these \r\ndiseases are exacting on our populations, particularly if \r\nseen from a gender perspective. This fact was noted by \r\nthe Secretary-General in his report entitled “Review of \r\nthe implementation of the Beijing Declaration and \r\nPlatform for Action, the outcomes of the twenty-third \r\nspecial session of the General Assembly and its \r\ncontribution to shaping a gender perspective towards \r\nthe full realization of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals” (E/CN.6/2010/2). \r\n Non-communicable diseases account for an \r\nestimated 35 million deaths every year, including the \r\npremature deaths of an estimated 8 million persons \r\nbefore the age of 60. Over 90 per cent of these \r\npremature deaths occur in developing countries, in \r\nparticular among the poorest and most disadvantaged \r\npopulations. \r\n The World Health Organization predicts that, by \r\n2015, non-communicable diseases will increase by 90 \r\nper cent and will contribute significantly to, among \r\nothers, the increased loss of productivity, slow \r\neconomic growth, rapid rise in health-care costs, \r\noverwhelmed national health systems and an \r\nunprecedented level of poverty if we, the international \r\ncommunity, do not take immediate and concerted \r\naction at the national, regional and global levels to \r\naddress the development challenges posed by these \r\nfactors. \r\n In the African region alone, deaths from \r\nnon-communicable diseases are predicted to increase \r\nby more than 20 per cent by 2015 while, in South-East \r\nAsia and the Western Pacific, non-communicable \r\ndiseases account for an estimated 54 per cent of the \r\n14.7 million annual deaths and over 75 per cent of \r\ndeaths, respectively. \r\n Given the socio-economic impact of non-\r\ncommunicable diseases and its link to health and \r\npoverty, the Group of 77 and China cannot underscore \r\nenough the importance of strengthening international \r\ncooperation in the area of public health. We also urge \r\ndeveloped countries, in accordance with their \r\ncommitments, to meet the agreed target of 0.7 per cent \r\nof gross national product for official development \r\nassistance to enable developing countries to meet their \r\ninternationally agreed development goals. \r\n In the case of global public health, there is an \r\nurgent need for increased and sustained levels of \r\nassistance to, among other things, build the capacity of \r\npublic health systems; to improve access to affordable, \r\nsafe, effective and high-quality medicines; to train, \r\nrecruit and retain skilled public health personnel; and \r\nto develop necessary infrastructure and the transfer of \r\ntechnology if we are to tackle the growing threat of \r\nnon-communicable diseases. \r\n The Group of 77 and China supports the call, in \r\nthe report of the WHO Director-General before us, for \r\nglobal development initiatives to consider the \r\nprevention and control of non-communicable diseases \r\nas one of the priorities to be included as an integral \r\npart of the global development agenda, including \r\nthrough poverty reduction initiatives. \r\n A/65/PV.52\r\n \r\n5 10-64830 \r\n \r\n In conclusion, the Group of 77 and China was \r\npleased to join consensus on resolution 64/265 and its \r\ncall for a high-level meeting of the General Assembly, \r\nwith the participation of heads of State and \r\nGovernment, to be convened in September 2011 to \r\naddress non-communicable diseases and their \r\nsocio-economic impact. We welcome the appointment \r\nof the Permanent Representatives of Jamaica and \r\nLuxembourg as co-facilitators of the informal \r\nconsultations under way on the scope, modalities, \r\nformat and organization of the high-level meeting of \r\nthe General Assembly to be convened in September \r\n2011. \r\n The Group of 77 and China is participating \r\nactively in the consultations and, given the enormity of \r\nthe crisis facing us, looks forward to the adoption of a \r\nresolution that reflects the views of all Member States, \r\nand which will result in a satisfactory, targeted and \r\naction-oriented outcome of the process. \r\n Mr. De Bassompierre (Belgium): I have the \r\nhonour to speak on behalf of the European Union. \r\n Due to the nature of the joint debate today, my \r\nremarks will bear on two different points, the first \r\nbeing on the draft resolution on growth (A/65/L.12) \r\nand the second on non-communicable diseases. \r\n The candidate countries Turkey, Croatia and the \r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia; the countries \r\nof the Stabilization and Association Process and \r\npotential candidates Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina \r\nand Montenegro; as well as Ukraine, the Republic of \r\nMoldova, Armenia and Georgia align themselves with \r\nthis declaration. \r\n The European Union is pleased to co-sponsor the \r\nGeneral Assembly resolution on sustained, inclusive \r\nand equitable economic growth for poverty reduction \r\nand achievement of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs). We would like to take this opportunity \r\nto thank the Republic of Korea and other sponsors for \r\ntaking the initiative of formulating this draft resolution. \r\n Growth plays a particularly important role in our \r\ncommon endeavour to eradicate poverty, achieve the \r\nMDGs and promote sustainable development. \r\nEconomic growth, provided it is socially inclusive, \r\nproduces a much greater effect in terms of poverty \r\nreduction than direct transfer of resources. It can have \r\na multiplier effect through employment creation and \r\nsocial protection. As for development aid, it should act \r\nincreasingly as a catalyst, supporting the efforts of \r\ndeveloping countries to generate growth. Adequate \r\nnational policies that create an environment conducive \r\nto growth play an important role in this respect. \r\n The sustainability of growth is also a major factor \r\nthat we have to take into consideration; hence the vital \r\nimportance of the link established in the MDG \r\noutcome document (resolution 65/1) between, on the \r\none hand, sustained, inclusive and equitable growth, \r\nand on the other, sustainable development in its three \r\neconomic, social and environmental components. \r\n The policy message that the General Assembly is \r\nsending with this draft resolution is an important one. \r\nIt shows the capacity of the United Nations to tackle \r\nthe main issues and challenges of our time. The \r\nEuropean Union looks forward to continuing our \r\ndiscussions on sustained, inclusive and equitable \r\ngrowth. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n I would now like to discuss the note by the \r\nSecretary-General (A/65/362), transmitting the report \r\nof the Director-General of the World Health \r\nOrganization (WHO) on the global status of non-\r\ncommunicable diseases. The candidate countries \r\nTurkey, Croatia and the former Yugoslav Republic of \r\nMacedonia; the countries of the Stabilization and \r\nAssociation Process and potential candidates Bosnia \r\nand Herzegovina and Montenegro; as well as the \r\nRepublic of Moldova and Armenia align themselves \r\nwith this declaration. \r\n Non-communicable diseases represent a \r\nconsiderable and worsening burden on world health, \r\nincluding in low- and medium-income countries. This \r\nhas been made unambiguously clear in the recent \r\nreport of WHO transmitted by the Secretary-General. \r\nThe European Union itself has a high incidence of \r\nnon-communicable diseases — such as cancer, \r\ndiabetes, cardiovascular disease and obesity — that can \r\nbe attributed to the convergence of a number of factors, \r\nincluding smoking, alcohol abuse, unhealthy diets, \r\npollution and physical inactivity. We are convinced that \r\nprevention is vital to easing the growing burden of \r\nnon-communicable diseases, and involves strategies \r\nand mechanisms oriented towards the critical risk \r\nfactors for these diseases, such as lifestyle and \r\nhygiene, as well as general environmental, commercial, \r\neconomic and social factors. \r\nA/65/PV.52  \r\n \r\n10-64830 6 \r\n \r\n Multisectoral integrated approaches are essential \r\nif we wish to tackle these illnesses successfully, given \r\nthat many of them are issues that elude health-care \r\nsystems. We also believe that national health strategies \r\nand strengthened health systems must take non-\r\ncommunicable diseases into account within a broader \r\nframework of efforts to improve health and conditions \r\ngenerally. In this regard, we welcome the commitment \r\nmade at the recent High-level Meeting on the \r\nMillennium Development Goals to improving the \r\nefficiency of health-care systems and giving greater \r\nsupport to interventions and initiatives that are clearly \r\neffective in dealing with increased health challenges, \r\nincluding the growing impact of non-communicable \r\ndiseases. \r\n Next year, the high-level meeting on \r\nnon-communicable diseases will give us an excellent \r\nopportunity to debate these subjects and to focus more \r\nworld public attention on the challenge of \r\nnon-communicable diseases. We are ready to \r\nparticipate actively and constructively in both the \r\nmeeting and its preparation. \r\n Ms. Millard-White (Trinidad and Tobago): The \r\nCaribbean Community (CARICOM) is honoured to \r\ntake part in this joint debate under agenda item 115, \r\n“Follow-up to the outcome of the Millennium \r\nSummit”, and aligns itself with the statement made by \r\nthe representative of Yemen on behalf of the Group of \r\n77 and China. \r\n The issue of global public health is of \r\nfundamental importance to our subregion. CARICOM \r\ncontinues to strive at the national, regional and \r\ninternational levels to ensure the health and well-being \r\nof our citizens. To this end, earlier this year CARICOM \r\nheads of Government approved the establishment of \r\nthe Caribbean Regional Health Agency (CARPHA), \r\nwhich will replace and build on the work of \r\nCARICOM’s existing five regional health institutions. \r\nCARPHA will facilitate a coordinated approach to \r\nregional health issues and prevent duplication of effort \r\nand resources. \r\n One health issue, however, that presents \r\nsignificant social, economic and development \r\nchallenges for our subregion is that of \r\nnon-communicable diseases, in particular \r\ncardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes and chronic \r\nrespiratory diseases. In the Caribbean, the prevalence \r\nand mortality rates of non-communicable diseases are \r\namong the highest in the world, having accounted for \r\n62 per cent of all deaths in the region in 2004, 40 per \r\ncent of which could have been prevented. Even more \r\nalarming is that deaths from these diseases in the \r\nCaribbean are expected to increase to 68 per cent in \r\n2015 if urgent action to address them is not taken. \r\n Non-communicable diseases disproportionately \r\naffect the poorest in our societies, due to their limited \r\nability to lead healthy lifestyles and access affordable \r\nhealth care. There is also sufficient evidence to show \r\nthat non-communicable diseases further contribute to \r\npoverty, due to loss of household income in many cases \r\nand the overwhelming cost of health care associated \r\nwith the treatment of such diseases. \r\n The Caribbean, however, is not alone in facing \r\nthese challenges. CARICOM welcomes the report of \r\nthe Director-General of the World Health Organization \r\n(WHO), transmitted by the Secretary-General’s note \r\ndated 13 September (A/65/362). The report indicates \r\nthat non-communicable diseases account for 60 per \r\ncent of all deaths worldwide, more than 80 per cent of \r\nwhich occur in developing countries, particularly low- \r\nand middle-income countries. WHO also estimates \r\nthat, globally, deaths from non-communicable diseases \r\nare expected to increase by 17 per cent over the next 10 \r\nyears, the greatest increase being expected in Africa. \r\n The fact that a large percentage of all deaths \r\nrelated to non-communicable diseases occur at the \r\nhighest rates in low- and middle-income countries, and \r\nthat they are all preventable, establishes the strong \r\nconnection between addressing these challenges and \r\nthe global development agenda. Further, \r\nnon-communicable diseases are emerging worldwide as \r\na serious macroeconomic and development challenge \r\ndue to loss of productivity, rapidly rising health-care \r\ncosts and links to poverty, as confirmed in the WHO \r\nDirector-General’s report. \r\n No single institution, organization or country has \r\nsufficient resources and capacity to reverse this \r\ngrowing epidemic, which requires concerted global and \r\nintersectoral responses. Consequently, there is a critical \r\nneed for increased political commitment and \r\ninternational collaboration to, inter alia, promote \r\npartnerships for the prevention and control of these \r\ndiseases; monitor them and their determinants at all \r\nlevels; and strengthen health care for persons with \r\nnon-communicable diseases by strengthening health-\r\ncare systems. This is in addition to influencing the \r\n A/65/PV.52\r\n \r\n7 10-64830 \r\n \r\npublic policies of non-health sectors and implementing \r\neffective mechanisms for intersectoral action in such \r\nareas as agriculture, food production, education, \r\nfinance, trade and sport. \r\n It is for these reasons that CARICOM members \r\nbrought the issue to the attention of the General \r\nAssembly in 2009. We are further pleased to have \r\nparticipated in the adoption of resolution 64/265 on the \r\nprevention and control of non-communicable diseases \r\non 13 May. The resolution called for the convening of \r\na high-level meeting of the General Assembly on \r\nnon-communicable diseases, with the participation of \r\nheads of State and Government, to be held in \r\nSeptember 2011. \r\n CARICOM would like to avail itself of this \r\nopportunity to recognize the role of the WHO \r\nthroughout this process and to express its deep \r\nappreciation for the continuous support and technical \r\nassistance provided to Member States thus far, in \r\nparticular by the Organization’s Pan American Health \r\nOrganization office located here in New York. \r\n In addition, we look forward to the positive and \r\nsuccessful outcomes of the regional meetings being \r\nconvened on the issue of non-communicable diseases \r\nin preparation for the September 2011 high-level \r\nmeeting, and anticipate the release of the WHO report, \r\nwhich will provide further valuable information to \r\nguide the process leading up to the high-level meeting \r\nin September 2011. CARICOM also supports the \r\ndevelopment of indicators to monitor the way in which \r\nMember States address this issue, the importance of \r\nwhich has been underscored by WHO. \r\n CARICOM will continue to be fully engaged in \r\nnegotiations currently taking place under the able \r\nleadership of the Permanent Representatives of \r\nJamaica and Luxembourg to determine the scope, \r\nmodalities, format and organization of the high-level \r\nmeeting. \r\n In conclusion, as agreed at the High-level Plenary \r\nMeeting on the Millennium Development Goals in \r\nSeptember 2009, we reiterate our commitment to \r\nundertaking concerted action and a coordinated \r\nresponse at the national, regional and global levels in \r\norder to adequately address the development and other \r\nchallenges caused by non-communicable diseases as \r\nwe work towards a successful high-level meeting of the \r\nGeneral Assembly in 2011. \r\n Mr. Benítez Versón (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nDespite attempts to gloss over current circumstances, \r\nthe global situation, especially since the devastating \r\neffects of the world economic and financial crisis, \r\ncontinues to be extremely complex. No one is surprised \r\nthat the measures adopted to boost growth and world \r\neconomic recovery have not always responded to the \r\nneeds of the poor and the most vulnerable. Quite the \r\nopposite is true; despite the promises made, many \r\ndeveloped countries have resorted to protectionism as \r\npart of their policies created in response to the crisis, to \r\nthe detriment of underdeveloped economies. \r\n The billions of dollars in fiscal stimulus packages \r\napplied hurriedly to rescue banks and other private \r\ncompanies responsible for the crisis contrast with the \r\never-decreasing amount of resources for development, \r\nincluding official development assistance. The current \r\ninternational economic order, plunged into financial \r\nand fiscal chaos caused by years of neoliberal policies, \r\nis deeply unfair and unsustainable and should be \r\nreplaced. \r\n At the High-level Plenary Meeting on the \r\nMillennium Development Goals that took place in \r\nSeptember, it was clearly demonstrated that the \r\nmajority of States will not be able to meet these modest \r\nobjectives. The requests for new and additional \r\nfinancial resources to try to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals in the scant time remaining before \r\n2015 were ignored by rich countries. They did not even \r\nallow a single mention of this situation in the outcome \r\ndocument of the High-level Meeting (resolution 65/1). \r\n If we follow this path, not only will the \r\nMillennium Development Goals go unmet, but other \r\ninternationally agreed development goals will also \r\nelude us. We need radical changes in the patterns of \r\nproduction and consumption of Northern societies and \r\nthe establishment of a new international economic \r\norder on the basis of new development paradigms. That \r\nis the only way to make real progress towards fulfilling \r\nthe targets and goals to which we have committed. In \r\nthis context, the establishment of a new international \r\nfinancial architecture should be a priority of United \r\nNations deliberations. \r\n The aforementioned scenario highlights the need \r\nto strengthen the central role of the United Nations in \r\ninternational affairs. So-called global governance \r\ncannot marginalize the most democratic mechanisms of \r\nthe Organization, nor should certain groups of \r\nA/65/PV.52  \r\n \r\n10-64830 8 \r\n \r\ncountries proclaim themselves the decision-making \r\nnucleus for the majority. The General Assembly, the \r\nbody in which we all participate in equal conditions \r\nand where there is no veto, should be strengthened. We \r\nalso advocate greater coherence in the actions of all \r\nbodies of the United Nations system, in strict respect \r\nfor mandates and the principle of national leadership in \r\nthe field of development assistance. \r\n With respect to the Secretariat and the staff of \r\nfunds and programmes, we need to take urgent \r\nmeasures to end such harmful practices as the fact that \r\na small group of developed countries control the main \r\nmanagement positions in the system’s bodies. \r\nRegarding the work of funds and programmes, we can \r\nno longer postpone the reform of the resident \r\ncoordinator system through decentralization and a \r\nfairer distribution of responsibilities among different \r\nagencies in the field. \r\n Cuba has carried out, before the agreed date, the \r\nmajority of the targets set under the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, despite the unfair and criminal \r\neconomic and financial blockade imposed by the \r\nGovernment of the United States. That blockade is the \r\nmain obstacle to greater development in Cuba and to \r\nraising the standard of living of our population. The \r\nresults achieved by Cuba demonstrate its determination \r\nto continue fostering the achievement of higher \r\nstandards of living and well-being for our population \r\nand channelling our limited resources towards those \r\nareas of greater socio-economic impact. \r\n Achieving human development has always been a \r\npriority for Cuba. In that context, it should be \r\nemphasized that the Human Development Report, \r\npublished annually by the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme, should reflect the concepts and indicators \r\nthat have intergovernmental consensus and acceptance. \r\nThe Human Development Report should abstain from \r\nusing partial and politically biased sources. It should \r\nalso strictly respect resolution 57/264. As that \r\nresolution states, consultations with Member States to \r\ndraw up the Human Development Report should be \r\nbroad, transparent and substantive and should not be \r\nlimited to mere information sessions on how the Report \r\nwas drawn up. If we aspire to maintaining the \r\ncredibility of the Human Development Report, the \r\ncriteria of Member States should be duly respected. \r\n Allow me to conclude by emphasizing that only \r\nwith the participation of all, with genuine political will \r\nto confront the current pressing problems and with a \r\nstrengthened United Nations, a firm defender of \r\ninternational law, will we comply with our \r\nresponsibility to build a better world for future \r\ngenerations. \r\n Mr. Barton (United States of America): The \r\nUnited States would like to commend Member States \r\nfor the success of the September High-level Plenary \r\nMeeting on the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs). Now is the time to work collectively, \r\nbilaterally and at the national level to accelerate \r\nprogress towards achieving the MDGs and other \r\ninternationally agreed development goals. \r\n During his address on 22 September at the MDG \r\nsummit (see A/65/PV.9), President Obama unveiled a \r\nnew United States development strategy that strongly \r\nsupports the full realization of the MDGs and reaffirms \r\nthe commitment of the United States to sustainable \r\ndevelopment and poverty alleviation. \r\n Our strategy is an outcome- and results-based \r\napproach grounded in the fact that sustained and \r\ninclusive economic growth is the surest path to poverty \r\nalleviation and development. It stresses the need to \r\nfoster innovation and deploy new technologies to \r\nconfront global threats, including disease, \r\nundernutrition, climate change and other environmental \r\nchallenges. Our strategy emphasizes country ownership \r\nand national responsibility for development — \r\nprinciples that require accountability both from donors \r\nand partner countries. We are working with our \r\ndevelopment partners, United Nations agencies, \r\ninternational institutions, non-governmental \r\norganizations and the private sector towards those \r\ngoals. \r\n As tangible steps in that regard, the United States \r\nhas introduced major initiatives, including our \r\n$63 billion Global Health Initiative and our \r\n$3.5 billion Feed the Future Initiative. We were also \r\npleased to announce on 5 October a new $4 billion \r\nmulti-year pledge to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, \r\nTuberculosis and Malaria — a 38 per cent increase in \r\nthe United States investment over the preceding three \r\nyears. \r\n We were honoured to join the international \r\ncommunity as it demonstrated its support for maternal \r\nand child health at the 22 September event led by the \r\n A/65/PV.52\r\n \r\n9 10-64830 \r\n \r\nSecretary-General, and we look forward to working \r\nwith our partners to implement the strategy. \r\n Under agenda item 13, “Integrated and \r\ncoordinated implementation of and follow-up to the \r\noutcomes of the major United Nations conferences and \r\nsummits in the economic, social and related fields”, we \r\nsupport the further discussion of best practices and \r\nlessons learned in the pursuit of sustained, inclusive \r\nand equitable economic growth, as highlighted in the \r\nMDG summit outcome document (resolution 65/2). \r\n We look forward to the high-level meeting on \r\nnon-communicable diseases next fall and support a \r\nstrong preparatory process, including a development \r\nand sector-wide approach with a socio-economic \r\nimpact; to tackle the prevention, mitigation and \r\ntreatment of non-communicable diseases. The United \r\nStates is committed to a successful event and focused, \r\ntangible outcomes. \r\n The United States continues to urge full \r\nimplementation of the outcomes of other major United \r\nNations development conferences and summits, \r\nincluding the Millennium Declaration, the \r\nJohannesburg Plan of Implementation, the 2005 World \r\nSummit Outcome, and the Monterrey Consensus and \r\nthe Doha Declaration on Financing for Development. \r\n With appropriate and needed streamlining of its \r\nagenda items, the Economic and Social Council has an \r\nimportant role to play in the follow-up to the outcomes \r\nto major United Nations conferences and summits. The \r\nstrengthening of the annual ministerial review and its \r\nfocus on key thematic issues related to the achievement \r\nof the Millennium Development Goals ensured that the \r\nCouncil played a vital role in the MDG summit. \r\n The United States is pleased to have joined others \r\nthis year in making our national voluntary presentation \r\non gender equality and women’s empowerment and to \r\nhave an opportunity to exchange views, valuable \r\ninformation and experiences with other delegations. \r\n While there has been important progress in the \r\nfollow-up to major conferences and summits, including \r\nthe Millennium Summit, much more needs to be done. \r\nThe United States looks forward to continuing the \r\ndialogue with other Member States on how to achieve \r\nthe ambitious goals we have set for ourselves. \r\n Mr. Rossi (Switzerland) (spoke in French): My \r\nstatement will address agenda item 115, “Follow-up to \r\nthe outcome of the Millennium Summit”. \r\n Switzerland welcomes this opportunity to go back \r\nover the issues of the effectiveness, efficiency and \r\ncoherence of the United Nations development system. \r\n Since the publication in 2006 of the report of the \r\nHigh-level Panel on United Nations System-wide \r\nCoherence (see A/61/583), great progress has been \r\nachieved at both global and national levels in terms of \r\ncoordination and coherence of United Nations \r\ndevelopment operations. For example, we can confirm \r\nthat thanks to the “delivering as one” initiative, United \r\nNations development assistance has become more \r\nrelevant. Indeed, it has been confirmed through the \r\nrecent evaluations conducted by the One United \r\nNations pilot countries that the “delivering as one” \r\napproach is contributing to renewed Government \r\nleadership in United Nations programmes as well as to \r\nthose programmes being better aligned to national \r\npriorities. \r\n That is encouraging. But is it enough? As \r\nshareholders of the United Nations system, can we now \r\nsimply sit back and hope for the best? \r\n Seeking better coherence and coordination is not \r\nenough, nor is it in itself our final objective. We have \r\nto continue to work together to optimize development \r\nactivities through a more efficient and effective United \r\nNations system. To do that, the United Nations \r\noperational system needs to improve the way partner \r\ncapacities are assessed and strengthened, risks are \r\ndetected and managed, and results are monitored and \r\nevaluated. That is why Switzerland will continue to \r\ninsist on the need to strengthen and harmonize \r\nevidence-based programming, monitoring and \r\nevaluation systems within and across agencies. \r\n In that context, my country awaits with \r\nimpatience the upcoming review of the experiences of \r\ncountries that have voluntarily undertaken the reform \r\nprocess. The findings will supplement the experience \r\nof the United Nations operational system in the \r\nnational application of the reform, with a view to the \r\ntriennial comprehensive policy review of operational \r\nactivities for development of the United Nations \r\nsystem in 2012. That will contribute to informed \r\ndecision-making by Member States on how to keep \r\nimproving the United Nations system and the reform \r\nagenda so as to achieve better development results. \r\n The sustained will of Member States is essential \r\nto making this reform a success, but it has to go hand \r\nin hand with complete commitment of United Nations \r\nA/65/PV.52  \r\n \r\n10-64830 10 \r\n \r\nagencies and strong national leadership. As Member \r\nStates, we must continue to encourage and guide the \r\nsystem with coherent and action-oriented messages and \r\ndecisions.  \r\n Switzerland, for its part, hopes that the individual \r\nagencies and the United Nations Development Group \r\n(UNDG) as a whole will continue to improve the \r\nfunctioning of the United Nations country teams. We \r\nbelieve that the role of the resident coordinators is \r\nessential in that regard. Therefore we urge the UNDG \r\nto put in place incentives and selection mechanisms to \r\nensure that the resident coordinators’ positions are \r\ngranted to the most committed and competent staff in \r\nthe United Nations agencies. \r\n Finally, we are pleased that the system-wide \r\ncoherence process has shown impressive institutional \r\nresults, the most prominent of all being the \r\nestablishment of a new United Nations agency for \r\nwomen. In our view, UN Women presents a real \r\nopportunity for the advancement of gender equality \r\nworldwide. We have a shared responsibility to provide \r\nit with the means that enable it to act effectively. It will \r\nfall to the Executive Board to provide it with \r\noutstanding operational and technical guidance to \r\nensure that it is able to pursue its mission and \r\ncontribute to bettering women’s lives. \r\n Mr. Al-Kuwari (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): Qatar \r\nis grateful for the opportunity to speak in the debate on \r\nthis agenda item. \r\n At the outset, Qatar aligns itself with the \r\nstatement made by the representative of Yemen on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China. \r\n The challenge that we all face is how to \r\nimplement the resolutions adopted by the United \r\nNations and how to improve the lives of millions of \r\npeople in the world. We have to concentrate \r\nfundamentally on those most vulnerable to danger and \r\npoverty. We have to unite to fight increasing poverty, \r\nespecially in developing countries. We have to work \r\ntogether to implement the world development \r\nprogramme, including the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs), making progress that we can review \r\nand compare. \r\n Therefore we have to work together to make \r\ncomprehensive economic growth a goal available to \r\nall, especially to the poor, within the framework of the \r\nUnited Nations. We need to concentrate especially on \r\nsustainable development and its main pillars, \r\neconomic, social and environmental. That is our \r\ncommon responsibility, on which the credibility of the \r\nUnited Nations rests. \r\n The Monterrey Consensus that we agreed upon in \r\n2002 in Mexico and reaffirmed in 2008 at the Doha \r\nReview Conference in Qatar points to certain principal \r\nsubjects that must be followed up and implemented. \r\nWe have to study the strategies and practical measures \r\nthat can help us to implement ongoing progress in this \r\nvital sphere. We also have to accelerate progress \r\ntowards achieving the MDGs. We have to strengthen \r\nsustainable growth to enable everyone, including the \r\npoor, to participate in and benefit from economic \r\nopportunities. That should provide job opportunities \r\nand increase incomes. We have to accelerate our efforts \r\nto fight poverty and to achieve the MDGs and enhance \r\nsustainable development. \r\n We have to make use of the international and \r\nnational efforts already made towards international \r\npartnership. That is vital for achieving the progress we \r\nall aspire to in this sixty-fifth session of the General \r\nAssembly. Two months ago we held the High-level \r\nPlenary Meeting on implementation of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, which made clear what we can \r\nachieve globally through opportunities and prospects. \r\n The Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2) \r\nand other documents, including the Monterrey \r\nConsensus, the 2005 Summit Outcome (resolution \r\n60/1) and the Doha Declaration on Financing for \r\nDevelopment (resolution 63/239, annex), have all \r\nurged us to face the main global challenge, which is to \r\ncombat poverty and to make the benefits of \r\ndevelopment available to all. In various parts of the \r\nworld some progress towards the MDGs has been \r\nachieved, but developing countries, including those in \r\nsub-Saharan Africa, have not been able to acquire the \r\nmeans that would allow them to achieve the Goals by \r\n2015. \r\n We have marched two thirds of the way to 2015, \r\nand the path forward to the MDGs has changed. We in \r\nQatar believe that the main engine for achieving the \r\nMDGs will be finding international partnerships and a \r\nnew, innovative mechanism to help people in the fields \r\nof health, education and appropriate and dignified \r\nemployment for all. \r\n The challenges facing us are greater than what \r\nwas expected at the Monterrey Conference. On a daily \r\n A/65/PV.52\r\n \r\n11 10-64830 \r\n \r\nbasis we find new, unexpected challenges that threaten \r\npeace and security, especially in the economic field. \r\nThe most recent financial crisis happened too fast even \r\nfor those who are experienced in dealing with such \r\ncrises. The repercussions of what was called a financial \r\nproblem in the largest industrial country in the world \r\nhave affected all the other countries and led to lower \r\nlevels of productivity and to unemployment. \r\n The progress that had been achieved has been \r\nreversed. The least developed countries are now even \r\nmore vulnerable. The financial transfers to those \r\ncountries have been reduced by half or more in some \r\ncases. Even the income of some of the oil-producing \r\ndeveloping countries has decreased. The fact is that, \r\nbesides the issue of debt alleviation, we can say that \r\nthe amount of real official development assistance \r\n(ODA) has been reduced. The challenge is to respect \r\nthe pledges of the Group of Eight, which seeks to \r\nincrease ODA by $50 billion and to double assistance \r\nto Africa by 2010. \r\n I am pleased to mention that although the State of \r\nQatar is a developing country, it has exceeded 0.7 per \r\ncent in terms of financial, developmental and \r\nhumanitarian assistance. We have established rules and \r\nregulations to help people in the areas of health, the \r\neconomy, the environment and the diversity of income. \r\n Finally, I would like to say that the State of Qatar \r\nhas joined the sponsors of draft resolution A/65/L.12. \r\n Ms. Tan (Singapore): I have the honour to deliver \r\nthis statement on draft resolution A/65/L.12, entitled \r\n“Sustained, inclusive and equitable economic growth \r\nfor poverty eradication and achievement of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals”, tabled under agenda \r\nitem 13. \r\n Singapore is pleased to align itself with the \r\nstatements delivered earlier by Viet Nam on behalf of \r\nthe 13 Member States that first proposed the draft \r\nresolution, and that of the Republic of Korea, on behalf \r\nof the draft resolution’s 88 sponsors. \r\n Through this draft resolution and its \r\nimplementation, we hope to encourage a greater \r\nemphasis and attention and an exchange of experiences \r\nand expertise on the role of economic growth strategies \r\nin efforts to achieve the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs). Why? \r\n First, there are direct and indirect connections \r\nbetween the eight MDGs; progress in one area often \r\nhas a positive effect on others. Similarly, we see a \r\nbasic correlation between sustained, inclusive and \r\nequitable economic growth and each of the MDGs. \r\nGrowth is often an indispensable, though insufficient, \r\ncondition for development. It is what helps generate \r\nthe long-term national resources for achieving the \r\nMDGs. Progress on the MDGs front would in turn help \r\nto promote economic growth. For instance, gender \r\nequality in all spheres, including in education and the \r\nworkforce, could help reduce poverty and drive \r\ngrowth. It is therefore useful for countries, in pursuing \r\ngrowth and the MDGs, to take into account that close, \r\ncomplex and often positive relationship in their \r\nnational development plans and strategies. \r\n That may sound like common sense to most. \r\nHowever, in the real world of scarce resources, \r\ncompartmentalization in policy-making and stovepipe \r\nbureaucracies, countries are sometimes presented with \r\na false choice between those goals. Countries should \r\nnot have to choose, for instance, between \r\nenvironmental sustainability and economic growth. We \r\nneed to work smarter to find complementarities and \r\nachieve both, because there will be no good long-term \r\nprospects for one without the other. \r\n Secondly, we see benefits in greater cross-\r\nregional exchanges of views and expertise on this \r\nissue. The United Nations, with its universal \r\nmembership and the deep expertise and wide reach of \r\nits institutions, is well placed to facilitate this \r\nexchange. And while the food, fuel and financial crises \r\nof recent years have significantly slowed development \r\nefforts, key regions have shown strong improvement in \r\nniche areas. Africa and Latin America have made great \r\nstrides towards education and gender equality. Those \r\nregions offer valuable lessons for Asia. \r\n Countries in Asia would also be keen to \r\nparticipate and offer some of their lessons learned. A \r\nkey message would be the critical need for national \r\nefforts, including pro-growth strategies and supportive \r\nsocial policies aimed at lifting millions out of poverty \r\nand hunger. In Asia, national strategies and regional \r\ncooperation often go hand in hand. Regional \r\nintegration has undoubtedly played an important role in \r\nboosting trade, investment and development. One \r\nexample of that regional approach to collective growth \r\nis the ASEAN Connectivity Initiative. It seeks to close \r\nthe gaps in road and rail links and aviation and \r\nmaritime services in order to allow people, goods and \r\nservices to flow more freely within the region. In then \r\nA/65/PV.52  \r\n \r\n10-64830 12 \r\n \r\nlinking up with the broader East Asian region and \r\ninternational markets, we bring more opportunities for \r\ntrade, investment, tourism and development to our \r\npeople. \r\n Open markets and free trade are linchpins of \r\nAsia’s growth. The region’s belief in the importance of \r\nan open international trading system is undiminished \r\ndespite the fact that the Doha Development Round has \r\nstalled. Countries in Asia have embarked on an \r\nambitious series of free trade negotiations, which will, \r\nhopefully, bring impetus to global trade talks. \r\n On the whole, regional cooperation in the \r\neconomic, social, political and security spheres have \r\nprovided a uniquely enabling environment. This \r\nregional approach to development, particularly within \r\nthe context of South-South cooperation, is one that \r\nother regions may find relevant. \r\n Thirdly, Singapore has worked bilaterally within \r\nthe Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), \r\nwith Japan and Korea and with others outside of Asia. \r\nWe have formed partnerships with various \r\norganizations of the United Nations system, such as the \r\nEconomic and Social Commission for Asia and the \r\nPacific, the United Nations Development Programme, \r\nthe International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the \r\nInternational Maritime Organization, the World Trade \r\nOrganization and the World Intellectual Property \r\nOrganization to provide technical assistance to other \r\ndeveloping countries in macroeconomic and financial \r\nmanagement, urban development, trade and tourism \r\npromotion, port management, human resource \r\ndevelopment, et cetera. \r\n With the adoption of this draft resolution and its \r\nimplementation, Singapore hopes to do more, to learn \r\nfrom other countries and work with them to contribute \r\ntowards the sustained, inclusive and equitable \r\neconomic growth of all countries. \r\n Mr. Savostianov (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): The focused and effective action of health-\r\ncare systems was one of the major tasks of the High-\r\nlevel Plenary Meeting this year. Therefore, in my \r\nstatement, I want to deal with one of the important \r\naspects of this matter, and that is the prevention and \r\ncontrol of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). \r\n In May 2009 the General Assembly adopted a \r\nresolution on this issue (resolution 64/265) for the first \r\ntime. The increasing attention in the United Nations is \r\nfully justified: NCDs are one of the most topical \r\nproblems of global development. Recently we have \r\nseen a trend towards rising rates of sickness and \r\nmortality from non-communicable diseases in the \r\npopulations of all countries. According to World Health \r\nOrganization (WHO) data, cardiovascular disease, \r\ncancer, diabetes and chronic lung disease claim the \r\nlives of 36 million people annually, and of those, 9 \r\nmillion are under the age of 60. The lack of effective \r\nmeasures in that area could result in an increase of \r\nalmost 20 per cent in the incidence of those diseases in \r\ndeveloping countries by the year 2015. Also, a \r\ndecrease in life expectancy and a deterioration in the \r\nquality of life goes along with a growing economic \r\nburden on both States and households. \r\n A direct link has now been proven between the \r\nmost widespread NCDs and living conditions and \r\nlifestyles, in particular the four main risk factors: \r\nsmoking, alcohol consumption, unhealthy diet and lack \r\nof exercise. The possibility of effectively preventing \r\nnon-communicable diseases by controlling those risk \r\nfactors has been clearly established. Therefore, bearing \r\nin mind the entire range of economic, social, gender, \r\nbehavioural, environmental and political aspects of the \r\nproblem, non-communicable diseases can be \r\neffectively fought only with a multisectoral approach. \r\nA solid foundation for collective work in that area is \r\nthe WHO 2008-2013 Action Plan for the Global \r\nStrategy for the Prevention and Control of Non-\r\nCommunicable Diseases. \r\n Resolution 64/265 on prevention and control of \r\nnon-communicable diseases, which calls for a high-\r\nlevel meeting of the General Assembly on the subject \r\nin September 2011, is an important step forward. As \r\none of the sponsors of that resolution, Russia supports \r\nthe initiative for holding a summit and is prepared to \r\nparticipate actively in its preparation. A critical \r\nchallenge is to agree on the thematic scope, the format \r\nand the modalities for the conduct of that event. We \r\ntrust the capable leaders of the negotiating process, the \r\nPermanent Representatives of Luxembourg and \r\nJamaica, to prepare the relevant General Assembly \r\ndraft resolution. The success of the summit in \r\nSeptember 2011 will largely depend on the quality of \r\nthe organization and the fleshing out of the preparatory \r\nprocess. We believe that a leading role must be played \r\nby WHO. We support holding regional consultations \r\nunder WHO auspices in preparation for the summit, \r\nwith the participation of the private sector and non-\r\n A/65/PV.52\r\n \r\n13 10-64830 \r\n \r\ngovernmental organizations, as well as the preparation \r\nof informational and analytical materials and reports, \r\nincluding the first global WHO report on non-\r\ncommunicable diseases. \r\n The first global conference on healthy lifestyles \r\nand NCDs, to be held at the ministerial level in \r\nMoscow from 28 to 30 April 2011, will make an \r\nimportant contribution to advancing the international \r\ndialogue on NCD issues, determining priorities for \r\ncooperative efforts and achieving agreement on \r\nprinciples. In resolution 64/265 the Assembly took note \r\nwith appreciation of that initiative by the Government \r\nof the Russian Federation. The conference will be \r\norganized by the Russian authorities in close \r\ncooperation with WHO. Priority attention will be \r\nfocused on organizing an open, transparent and \r\ninclusive preparatory process in very close \r\ncoordination with WHO and with the broad \r\nparticipation of Member States and international \r\npartners. To that end, preparations for the conference \r\nwill be coordinated by the Russian organizing \r\ncommittee and by the international executive \r\ncommittee, comprised of 22 experts from all regions of \r\nthe world. The regular meeting of that committee will \r\nbe held in Oslo tomorrow, 24 November, on the eve of \r\nthe WHO European consultations on \r\nnon-communicable diseases. \r\n We will need to formulate the goals and issues for \r\nthe Moscow conference and to discuss its agenda, \r\nprogramme of work, format, and the parameters of the \r\nworking and final documents. We anticipate that the \r\nformat of the conference will be a plenary meeting, \r\nworking meetings and a drafting group, with parallel \r\nround tables. A partners forum with the participation of \r\nall interested parties will be organized on the margins. \r\nAt the end of the conference a ministerial declaration \r\nwill be adopted. \r\n Invitations to the Moscow conference on behalf \r\nof the Government of the Russian Federation and the \r\nDirector General of WHO will be sent out at the end of \r\nNovember, once agreed to by the executive committee. \r\nThe invitation will be accompanied by a concept paper, \r\na draft agenda and a draft programme of work for the \r\nconference. We are convinced that the conference will \r\nmake a serious and substantive contribution towards \r\nthe preparation of the United Nations summit on non-\r\ncommunicable diseases, and we invite all countries to \r\nparticipate actively in the Moscow event. \r\n Mr. Wetland (Norway): I will be addressing \r\nagenda item 115 this morning. We know that the global \r\nburden of disease is changing. Non-communicable \r\ndiseases (NCDs) account for almost 90 per cent of the \r\ndisease burden in the European region and for about 60 \r\nper cent of all deaths worldwide. Part of the reason for \r\nthat is that we have been successful in combating \r\ncommunicable diseases, as we have often heard in \r\nrecent years, and part of the reason is that we live \r\nlonger than we did a few decades ago. We have also \r\nexperienced an economic growth that allows more \r\npeople — regrettably — to pursue unhealthy lifestyles. \r\nTobacco consumption, obesity, unhealthy diet, physical \r\ninactivity and alcohol are key contributing factors. \r\n We have increasingly solid data on the situation \r\nof NCDs in poor countries. According to the World \r\nHealth Organization (WHO), mortality from NCDs is \r\ngoing to increase over the next 10 years, most rapidly \r\nin low- and middle-income countries. It is therefore \r\ntimely to address NCDs as a global challenge. \r\n The considerable progress that has been achieved \r\nin global health over the past decade shows that \r\nconcerted efforts produce results. Child mortality is on \r\nthe decline, there is better access to vaccines and life-\r\nsaving antiretrovirals, and the health workforce has \r\nbeen recognized as the most valuable asset of national \r\nhealth systems, not simply an expenditure. However, \r\nseveral of the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs), in particular those that concern women’s and \r\nchildren’s health and well-being, are still far from \r\nbeing reached and require sustained attention and \r\ncommitment. That will be particularly important in the \r\nnext few years as the world enters the final drive to \r\ndeliver on the MDGs by 2015. \r\n In that regard it is important to note that \r\ncommunicable diseases, such as HIV, tuberculosis and \r\nmalaria, and the conditions that cause maternal and \r\nchild mortality still constitute a greater share of the \r\nburden of disease borne by the poorest segments of \r\npopulations. Common communicable diseases and \r\nmalnutrition are still the main causes of high child and \r\nmaternal mortality in the poorest countries. The MDGs \r\nand their focus on poverty must therefore continue to \r\nbe given top priority by the global community, and the \r\nNorwegian Government will certainly do so. \r\n It is therefore essential that we move ahead in a \r\nway that reinforces national and global public health \r\nsystems and that we avoid fragmentation and \r\nA/65/PV.52  \r\n \r\n10-64830 14 \r\n \r\ncompetition for scarce resources. In that regard, there \r\nare useful lessons to be drawn from our experience \r\nwith MDG-related global health initiatives. I would \r\nlike to focus on a few of them in particular. \r\n First, there is the importance of designing \r\ninternational initiatives so that they are driven by \r\ncountries themselves: national Governments must take \r\nthe lead. That is particularly important for NCDs \r\nbecause an effective response requires cross-sectoral \r\naction, including national legislation and regulation. \r\n Secondly, we wish to draw attention to the \r\nimportance of strengthening national health systems to \r\naddress infectious and non-communicable diseases \r\nholistically: external support should contribute \r\nsystematically to strengthening national health systems \r\nand avoid the fragmentation that we see too often in \r\nthe health sector. \r\n Thirdly, global health initiatives have to a large \r\nextent focused on service delivery and individual \r\ninterventions, and much less on prevention. By forcing \r\nus to prioritize health promotion and cross-sectoral \r\naction, action to combat NCDs can add significant \r\nvalue through the resulting strengthening of public \r\nhealth functions and the stewardship role of health \r\nministries. \r\n Fourthly, from the start, Governments must \r\nestablish inclusive partnerships with civil society and \r\nthe private sector. That has been key to success in the \r\nAIDS response and has also been our experience in \r\nNorway regarding NCDs. \r\n Fifthly, it is more true than ever before that \r\nmoney matters — but money alone is not sufficient. \r\nMany countries are in constrained economic situations, \r\nwith public budgets, including those for official \r\ndevelopment assistance, under severe pressure. The \r\nemerging NCD movement is well placed to produce \r\nintegrated plans, with realistic resource needs, that \r\nemphasize value for money and focus on actions that \r\nare needed in that phase. In the years leading up to \r\n2015 we must expand the evidence base needed for \r\ndecision makers; support national leadership and cross-\r\nsectoral capacity; and document what works in \r\ndifferent contexts. \r\n We fully support the WHO Global Strategy for \r\nthe Prevention and Control of NCDs. It provides an \r\nexcellent framework for the work ahead. We encourage \r\nWHO to continue providing evidence and data in \r\npreparation for the High-level Meeting on NCDs in \r\nSeptember next year. Later this week, as part of the \r\npreparations for the meeting, the Norwegian \r\nGovernment is hosting the United Nations Department \r\nof Economic and Social Affairs-WHO regional high-\r\nlevel consultation on NCDs in Oslo. The 53 member \r\nStates of WHO’s European region have been invited to \r\nattend. \r\n Next year’s High-level Meeting offers a key \r\nopportunity to galvanize Member States into action to \r\nreduce premature mortality from NCDs, with particular \r\nfocus on the developmental challenges faced by \r\ndeveloping countries. We look forward to an inclusive \r\nmeeting involving many partners, where we can agree \r\non near-term actions and on a way to ensure that NCDs \r\nin the longer term are aligned with the health MDGs \r\nand can support the strengthening of national health \r\nsystems in an effective and sustained way. \r\n Mr. AlMehaini (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): We \r\nare pleased to be participating in the debate on the \r\nfollow-up to the outcomes of major United Nations \r\nconferences and the High-level Plenary meeting on the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) at the sixty-\r\nfifth session of the General Assembly. We would also \r\nlike to express our support for draft resolution \r\nA/65/L.12 on the follow-up to commitments for the \r\nMDGs, which ratifies the outcome document (A/65/1) \r\nof the High-level Conference held in September on the \r\nMDGs. \r\n We also reiterate our support for the outcome \r\ndocument of the thirty-fourth Annual Meeting of the \r\nMinisters for Foreign Affairs of the Group of 77 and \r\nChina, held here at the United Nations in New York, on \r\naddressing the development challenges facing \r\ndeveloping countries. My delegation would also like to \r\nthank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his \r\ncomprehensive report dealing with both the challenges \r\nand the progress made in keeping promises and the \r\nagreed programme of work for the MDGs in 2015. \r\n At the High-level Summit in September in New \r\nYork, the world’s leaders discussed the implementation \r\nof the MDGs and concluded that progress towards \r\nachieving Goal 1, namely, eliminating poverty and \r\nhunger, is lagging, given that in 2009 there were more \r\nthan one billion people in the world living in poverty \r\nand hunger. We must also step up our efforts to achieve \r\nthe other two MDGs regarding maternal and child \r\nhealth and work together to make the expected \r\n A/65/PV.52\r\n \r\n15 10-64830 \r\n \r\nprogress. The world leaders also identified the \r\nchallenges that the international community has been \r\nfacing during the past few years, such as rises in food \r\nprices, the world financial and economic crisis, and the \r\nfluctuations in energy prices, as well as other problems \r\nthat require all States, especially developed countries, \r\nto honour their commitments to allocate 0.7 per cent of \r\ngross domestic product (GDP) for official development \r\nassistance (ODA). In this context, we would like to pay \r\ntribute to the donor countries that have committed to \r\n0.7 per cent of their GDP for ODA. \r\n Kuwait understands that sustainable development \r\nrequires national development, and, as such, has \r\ndrafted a comprehensive national development \r\nprogramme for the period 2010-2014. The plan aims at \r\nimproving the areas of education, health, human \r\nresources, institutions and infrastructure, among others. \r\nNor have we failed in our international commitments \r\never since we pledged to cooperate with the \r\ninternational community to achieve the lofty MDGs by \r\nthe deadline, Kuwait has increased its contribution, as \r\nwell as increasing its assistance to developing \r\ncountries to 1.31 per cent of our GDP. \r\n In regard to Africa and efforts to combat the \r\nscourges that affect it, particularly increasing disease \r\nand poverty, we have allotted $300 million to the \r\nIslamic Development Bank, as well as another \r\n$100 million for Kuwait’s decent living fund, aimed at \r\nproviding rapid food supplies for the needy and \r\nincreasing harvests and agricultural products, in \r\ncooperation with other similar initiatives. \r\n Aware of the need to diversify and expand \r\nassistance to developing countries, the Emir of Kuwait \r\nhas implemented a support fund for small and medium-\r\nsized enterprises with a capital endowment worth \r\n$2 billion. Five hundred million dollars of its capital \r\nwill be used to create employment opportunities for \r\nArab youth and the fight against poverty. It will also \r\nunderpin the Kuwait Development Fund by focusing \r\non supporting and financing development and \r\ninfrastructure projects in more than 100 countries to \r\nthe tune of some $15 billion. \r\n With regard to reviewing the progress towards \r\nreaching the Millennium Development Goals, we \r\nbelieve that it is still possible to attain the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals by 2015 despite the global \r\nchallenges for the international community. Everyone \r\nwas unanimous in stating that political will, joint \r\naction and respect for the commitments were needed to \r\nachieve the Goals. \r\n Despite the difficulties hampering the efforts of \r\nStates to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, \r\nwe agree with the Secretary-General when he says that \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals are still possible \r\nand achievable, with a view to creating a better world \r\nwhere the gaps resulting from differences and divisions \r\nare narrowed and the prospects for cooperation and \r\npartnership are widened and where peace and security \r\nprevail. \r\n Mr. Quinlan (Australia): My delegation is \r\nhonoured to be a sponsor of the draft resolution in \r\ndocument A/65/L.12 on sustained, inclusive and \r\nequitable economic growth, and we look forward to its \r\nadoption. \r\n This morning, however, I want to comment on the \r\nvital issue of non-communicable diseases. As the \r\nreport transmitted in the Secretary-General’s note \r\n(A/65/362) highlights, the global burden of \r\nnon-communicable diseases constitutes one of the \r\nmajor challenges for development in the twenty-first \r\ncentury, impacting particularly developing countries. \r\nCardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic lung diseases \r\nand diabetes have emerged as major public health \r\nproblems, and the increasing incidence of \r\nnon-communicable diseases among poor and \r\nvulnerable groups is widening health inequalities \r\nwithin and among countries. In Australia’s own \r\nimmediate region, non-communicable diseases are the \r\nleading cause of death in the Pacific island countries, \r\nwhere they account for over 75 per cent of the deaths \r\nevery year. The rate of diabetes, in particular in the \r\ncounties of the Pacific, is among the highest in the \r\nworld. We should all be warned of the dangers of those \r\ndiseases, including diabetes. I should say that I wish I \r\nhad listened to my own doctor. I am a diabetic, and, if I \r\nhad listened to his warnings at a much earlier stage in \r\nmy life, I would not face the prospects that I now face. \r\n The Australian Agency for International \r\nDevelopment is working closely with partner countries \r\nin our region to lower the incidence and impact of non-\r\ncommunicable disease, including through \r\nstrengthening national health systems, scaling up \r\npreventative health and health promotion programmes \r\nand improving access to health services. In Nauru, for \r\nexample, Australia has supported the development of \r\nlegislation to address the risk factors for \r\nA/65/PV.52  \r\n \r\n10-64830 16 \r\n \r\nnon-communicable diseases, including, in particular, \r\nthrough a new tobacco bill; in Samoa, we support a \r\nprogramme of health promotion and disease prevention \r\nat the community and institutional levels; and in \r\nTonga, we are working to reduce the prevalence of \r\nnon-communicable disease risk factors, in particular, \r\nobesity and tobacco use. \r\n Australia is very encouraged that health issues \r\nare being given an increasingly high priority on the \r\nUnited Nations agenda. At the launch of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s Global Strategy on Women’s and Children’s \r\nHealth during the Millennium Development Goals \r\nsummit in September, we committed to scaling up our \r\nefforts to tackle maternal and child health \r\ninternationally (see A/65/PV.9), and we will, in fact, \r\nspend an additional $1.6 billion over the next five \r\nyears to contribute to that project. \r\n In June 2011, 10 years after the United Nations \r\nfirst special session of the General Assembly on \r\nHIV/AIDS, we will gather to review progress and \r\nreaffirm our commitment to achieving universal access \r\nto HIV prevention, treatment, care and support. The \r\nhigh-level meeting on non-communicable diseases in \r\nSeptember will provide a timely opportunity to \r\nconsider how to scale up our actions to prevent and \r\ncontrol non-communicable diseases. \r\n There are many steps that we can take to reduce \r\nthe risk factors and improve access to health care for \r\nthose affected by non-communicable diseases, and it is \r\ncrucial that the challenge be given greater attention in \r\nnational health plans and development strategies. We \r\nmust also recognize the chronic nature of such \r\ndiseases, and that multisectoral efforts will be required \r\nover many years before we see a change in the \r\nincidence of non-communicable diseases. \r\n Australia, for its part, will do what it can to help \r\nreduce the global burden of non-communicable \r\ndiseases. We very much welcome the initiative to hold \r\nthe high-level meeting in September next year, and we \r\nwill continue to play a constructive role in the \r\npreparations for that meeting. \r\n Mr. McLay (New Zealand): I wonder if I might \r\ncrave the President’s indulgence for a moment and \r\nexpress thanks to the many delegations that have \r\nconveyed sympathy and concern to New Zealand at the \r\nplight of the 29 trapped miners. We are grateful for the \r\nthoughts and prayers conveyed to us by many \r\ndelegations at this very difficult time. \r\n On 19 October 2010, this General Assembly \r\nadopted a resolution endorsing the outcome of the \r\nHigh-level Plenary Meeting of the sixty-fifth session of \r\nthe General Assembly on the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs) (resolution 65/1). \r\n Today, we debate the follow-up to that resolution. \r\nIn its statement on 20 September 2010 at that High-\r\nlevel Plenary Meeting, New Zealand expressed the \r\nview that better, faster progress towards the \r\nMillennium Development Goals is achievable (see \r\nA/65/PV.4). We stressed the need to place a higher \r\npremium on outcomes and cooperation. We noted that \r\nmore money alone would not solve all the problems \r\nand that a much greater focus on aid effectiveness was \r\nrequired. We also highlighted the connection between \r\nthe MDGs and sustainable economic development, \r\nwhich is a priority for New Zealand’s own aid \r\nprogramme. \r\n Those points have been well captured within the \r\nMDG outcome document, which was endorsed by the \r\nGeneral Assembly last month. They are critical to \r\nadvancing our commitment to achieving the MDGs \r\nand, as such, I suggest that outcomes, cooperation and \r\naid effectiveness should be central to our debate today. \r\n We are acutely aware that, of the eight MDGs, \r\nMDG 4 and MDG 5 on health and MDG 3 on gender \r\nare the most challenging. I come from the South \r\nPacific — a region that is second only to sub-Saharan \r\nAfrica in terms of the lack of progress towards \r\nachieving the MDGs. While infant and child mortality \r\nrates have improved in most Pacific island countries, \r\nmaternal deaths have increased in Papua New Guinea, \r\nfor instance, and achieving universal access to \r\nreproductive health and gender equality continues to \r\nelude many Pacific island countries. \r\n The MDG High-level Plenary outcome document \r\nsets out very clear steps to guide us in keeping the \r\npromise to achieve the MDGs. For its part, New \r\nZealand intends to work harder on donor coordination, \r\nfor example, through our Cairns Compact engagement, \r\nin order to focus more on results and practical \r\ninterventions that improve economic and social well-\r\nbeing. \r\n Without detracting from any other MDG-related \r\nissues, I should highlight a relevant health and \r\ndevelopment concern that is exercising New Zealand \r\nand our Pacific neighbours, that is, the growing burden \r\nof non-communicable diseases, referred to in two \r\n A/65/PV.52\r\n \r\n17 10-64830 \r\n \r\nparagraphs of the outcome document, namely, \r\nparagraph 73 (k), which calls for strengthening the \r\neffectiveness of health systems and proven \r\ninterventions to address evolving health challenges \r\nsuch as the increased incidence of non-communicable \r\ndiseases; and paragraph 76 (i), which calls for \r\nconcerted action and a coordinated response at the \r\nnational, regional and global levels to adequately \r\naddress the developmental and other challenges posed \r\nby non-communicable diseases, namely, cardiovascular \r\ndiseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases and \r\ndiabetes. In New Zealand, cancer and heart disease are \r\nthe main causes of death, and disparities between \r\nethnic groups are particularly worrying — notably \r\namong our Maori and Pasifika populations. \r\n In the Pacific, more than 70 per cent of deaths are \r\ndue to non-communicable diseases, and rates of \r\nnon-communicable disease-related blindness, disability \r\nand renal failure are also increasing. \r\n In response to the growing burden of non-\r\ncommunicable diseases globally, the New Zealand Aid \r\nProgramme and New Zealand researchers and scientists \r\nhave been working collaboratively with partners to find \r\nsolutions to stem that epidemic and avoid the dire \r\nsocial and economic consequences that can ensue. \r\n Earlier this year, New Zealand co-sponsored the \r\nresolution in which the General Assembly decided to \r\nhold a high-level meeting on the prevention and \r\ncontrol of non-communicable diseases in September \r\n2011. New Zealand is committed to engaging actively \r\nand productively in all the processes relating to that \r\nmeeting, including negotiations on the resolution on \r\nmodalities that are currently under way. \r\n New Zealand stands committed and ready to play \r\nits part in assisting the global community in addressing \r\nthe challenge presented by chronic, non-communicable \r\ndiseases, in addressing the equally chronic and \r\nassociated cycles of debt and illness, and thus, in \r\nachieving more equitable human development. \r\n Mr. Manjeev Singh Puri (India): At the outset, I \r\nwould like to add my voice to the others in extending \r\nour sympathies to New Zealand for the situation of the \r\ntrapped miners. \r\n In addition, our heartfelt condolences go to the \r\nGovernment and people of Cambodia for the \r\nsignificant number of tragic deaths in the stampede that \r\nhas been reported in today’s media. \r\n My delegation wishes to thank the President for \r\norganizing today’s joint debate on agenda items 13, \r\n115 and 120. The issues they deal with are central to \r\nour collective efforts to strengthen the United Nations \r\nsystem and even more relevant for the theme that the \r\nPresident has chosen for the current session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, namely, “Reaffirming the central \r\nrole of the United Nations in global governance”. \r\n India has all along emphasized that sustaining \r\neconomic growth is key for poverty eradication. It is \r\nalso imperative that the fruits of development reach \r\nacross the board and result in inclusive growth and the \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals. \r\n We are, therefore, happy to co-sponsor draft \r\nresolution A/65/L.12, entitled “Sustained, inclusive and \r\nequitable economic growth for poverty eradication and \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals”, \r\nfor adoption by the General Assembly later today. \r\n In that regard, we recognize the crucial role of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council in pushing for a \r\ncomprehensive development agenda at the United \r\nNations through an integrated and coordinated \r\napproach. \r\n We align ourselves with the statement by the \r\nChairperson of the Group of 77 and China on the 2010 \r\nHuman Development report of the World Health \r\nOrganization (WHO), which I will now address. Like \r\nmany other countries, India is also undergoing \r\nepidemiologic transition with the initial high burden of \r\ndisease and mortality owing to infectious diseases \r\ngradually giving way to non-communicable diseases, \r\ninjuries and geriatric problems as the main burden of \r\ndisease. \r\n It is estimated that 42 per cent of all deaths in \r\nIndia today are due to non-communicable diseases, and \r\nwe have lost millions of potentially productive years of \r\nlife, owing to premature deaths caused by \r\ncardiovascular disease in the 35 to 64 year-old age \r\ngroup. That also illustrates the enormity of the \r\nchallenge we face. There is also emerging evidence \r\nthat poor people are particularly vulnerable to \r\nnon-communicable diseases, owing to high rates of \r\nsmoking and tobacco use, occupational risks, and \r\nliving conditions. \r\n The Government of India has accorded very high \r\npriority to health care in our country. Our flagship \r\nNational Rural Health Mission is using innovative and \r\nA/65/PV.52  \r\n \r\n10-64830 18 \r\n \r\ndecentralized approaches to public health with strong \r\ninvolvement of local communities. The Indian Ministry \r\nof Health and Family Welfare has also formulated \r\nvarious national programmes for non-communicable \r\ndiseases, including national programmes for the \r\nprevention and control of diabetes, cardiovascular \r\ndisease and cerebral vascular diseases, as well as the \r\nNational Cancer Control Programme and the National \r\nMental Health Programme. While obviously much is \r\nbeing invested in the prevention and health promotion \r\nside, we need, of course, to tackle the need for \r\naffordable treatment. With non-communicable diseases \r\nbecoming a major issue globally, it is imperative that \r\npolicies with regard to access to safe drugs also ensure \r\ntheir affordability for all. We look forward to the high-\r\nlevel meeting of the General Assembly in September \r\n2011, as it will give us an opportunity to bring global \r\nattention to this important and growing developmental \r\nchallenge. \r\n My delegation also welcomes the report of the \r\nJoint Inspection Unit (JIU) on the selection and \r\nconditions of service of executive heads in the United \r\nNations system organizations. It is a long overdue \r\nevaluation of the legal and institutional framework and \r\npractices followed in the selection and appointment of \r\nsuch senior officials. We are firmly of the view that the \r\nrelevant legislative bodies, whether it be the General \r\nAssembly, in the case of the Secretary-General, or the \r\ngoverning bodies, as in the case of the funds, \r\nprogrammes and specialized agencies, should have a \r\ngreater role in such appointments. My delegation has \r\nrepeatedly voiced our strong support for a greater say \r\non the part of the General Assembly in the process of \r\nselection of the Secretary-General, most recently in the \r\ncontext of our discussion on the revitalization of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n The report of the JIU should give an impetus to \r\nthe discussion among Member States to enhance the \r\nrole of the General Assembly in selection of the \r\nSecretary-General. \r\n The situation is not much different in the case of \r\nexecutive heads of the funds and programmes. The \r\nprocess of consulting the governing bodies must \r\ninvolve real engagement with Member States. We \r\nwould not like to see it reduced to a mere pro forma \r\nexercise, which is, regretfully, the case at present, with \r\nMember States given unrealistically tight time frames \r\nto react to the Secretary-General’s recommendations. \r\nMy delegation believes the JIU has offered useful \r\nrecommendations on the selection and conditions of \r\nservice of executive heads in the United Nations \r\nsystem. It supports the objective of making the process \r\nand system more transparent, effective, and \r\naccountable by involving its principal stakeholders. We \r\nurge Member States to give it careful consideration. \r\n The Acting President: In accordance with \r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 57/32 of 19 November \r\n2002, I now call on the observer of the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union. \r\n Ms. Filip (Inter-Parliamentary Union): The \r\nsubject of today’s joint debate is too vast to be covered \r\nsatisfactorily in a single statement. At the same time, \r\nthis may not be the time and place to recount in any \r\ngreat detail the actual, concrete work that the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union (IPU) is doing in follow-up to \r\nmajor United Nations conferences, much of which we \r\nhave covered in other recent statements or is reflected \r\nin the biennial report of the United Nations Secretary-\r\nGeneral on cooperation between the United Nations, \r\nnational parliaments and the IPU. I will thus focus my \r\nremarks on one issue that, by and large, remains \r\ncritical to the follow-up and implementation of global \r\ncommitments emanating from major United Nations \r\nconferences, namely the issue of national ownership. \r\n Global commitments by definition are binding \r\nprimarily on Governments, but they become tangible \r\nonly when all stakeholders are made to feel involved \r\nand empowered to play their role. That in turn requires \r\nthat national actors comprehend what is at stake, the \r\nvarious ramifications of the commitments taken, the \r\npolicy prescriptions that are embedded in those \r\ncommitments, and the specific actions that must be \r\nundertaken to help Governments make good on their \r\npromises here at the United Nations. Our experience \r\nover the last few years tells us that there must be more \r\nbuy-in at the national level for global commitments to \r\ntake hold. Parliaments provide a case in point on how \r\nnecessary that is and how it can be achieved. \r\n The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), \r\nwhich originated with the Millennium Declaration \r\n(resolution 55/2), are, of course, very high on our \r\nagenda, but the action of the IPU extends to other \r\nissues as well, from HIV and AIDS to the least \r\ndeveloped countries (LDCs), climate change and trade, \r\nto mention a few. To support parliamentary \r\nengagement on those issues, the IPU employs several \r\nmodalities — some well tried and consecrated, others \r\n A/65/PV.52\r\n \r\n19 10-64830 \r\n \r\nmore innovative, which we hope to put to the test in \r\nthe coming years. \r\n There is a growing practice on the part of \r\nMember States to include legislators in national \r\ndelegations to major United Nations conferences and \r\nreviews. On such occasions, we find that there is value \r\nin bringing those members of parliament (MPs) \r\ntogether to exchange ideas and experiences and \r\nidentify avenues for follow-up action within their \r\nparliaments back home. A recent illustration of that \r\nwas a parliamentary meeting at the MDG Summit, \r\nwhere some 70 members of parliament from relevant \r\nselect committees met to examine the Summit outcome \r\ndocument and to compare notes on their own work in \r\nrelation to the MDGs. Similarly, the IPU will be \r\nholding a one-day parliamentary meeting on climate \r\nchange on 6 December in Cancún, building on the \r\npositive and substantive exercise last year in \r\nCopenhagen on the occasion of the fifteenth \r\nConference of the Parties to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change. \r\n Within the IPU’s regular programme of work, \r\nbriefings and panel discussions are held at IPU \r\nconferences and assemblies, where members engage \r\nwith United Nations officials and among themselves in \r\npreparation for or in follow-up to major United Nations \r\nprocesses. A recent example of that is a thematic \r\nsession held last month at the 123rd IPU Assembly in \r\nGeneva within the Committee on United Nations \r\nAffairs and with the participation of the United Nations \r\nHigh Representative for the Least Developed \r\nCountries, which sought to elicit the views of \r\nparliamentarians on their concerns and priorities with \r\nrespect to a new programme of action for the LDCs. \r\nThe outcome of that debate, also circulated here among \r\nUnited Nations Member States, will help inform the \r\nIPU contribution to the process leading up to the \r\nIstanbul Summit next year. \r\n Another modality whereby the IPU seeks to \r\nadvance the implementation of major global \r\ncommitments is directed at enhancing the capacity and \r\ninstitutional mechanisms for parliaments to mainstream \r\nthe outcomes of international conferences and related \r\ncommitments. Earlier this year, for example, the IPU \r\nconducted a comparative study on how parliaments as \r\ninstitutions deal with the MDGs. The results varied \r\ngreatly, from parliaments that have no particular \r\nfollow-up mechanism to parliaments that have set up \r\nspecialized MDG committees or caucuses. One of the \r\nfindings of the study is that huge global agendas, such \r\nas the MDGs, which cut across many policy areas, are \r\nbest pursued through established committees of \r\nparliaments, such as health, education or the \r\nenvironment, and that those committees must be \r\nprovided with the necessary information and expertise. \r\nThe parliamentary committees are a home for the \r\nMDGs, provided that they do not work in isolation \r\nfrom one another. If a specialized committee or caucus \r\nfor the MDGs needs to be established, one of its main \r\nfunctions is precisely to help ensure coherence and \r\ncoordination throughout the parliamentary system \r\nwhen developing an integrated approach to the MDGs. \r\n Another area of particular importance for the IPU \r\nhas to do with the type of role that parliaments can and \r\nshould play in the review of implementation of existing \r\ninternational commitments. When dealing with \r\nnational reviews of progress towards meeting the \r\nMDGs or international commitments in the area of the \r\nLDCs or HIV and AIDS, it is helpful when progress \r\nreports are also placed on the agendas of parliaments. \r\n Perhaps one of the most successful mechanisms \r\nthat we have been able to develop thus far involves the \r\nUnited Nations human rights treaty body system, and \r\nin particular the Convention on the Elimination of All \r\nForms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). In \r\nthat case, the IPU works with the parliaments of the \r\ncountries under review, so that they can take part in the \r\nreview process at the national level, provide input to \r\nthe national report, attend the session of the CEDAW \r\nCommittee and receive the United Nations findings for \r\nfurther consideration and action by the parliament \r\nconcerned. We feel that that exercise is one that can be \r\nreplicated in other areas as well. \r\n In conclusion, from our perspective, another way \r\nto look at the question of follow-up to United Nations \r\nconferences is through the larger prism of how the \r\nUnited Nations as a system engages with national \r\nparliaments and with the IPU. What we have described \r\nnow is just one dimension of a much larger debate that \r\nwe can expect to have in this Hall in just a few weeks’ \r\ntime. Please allow me to take this opportunity to \r\nremind delegations that a draft resolution on \r\ncooperation between the two organizations has been \r\ntabled on the basis of a very substantive report of the \r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations. We invite all \r\ndelegations to consider that report for a more \r\ncomprehensive overview of how we are working to \r\nA/65/PV.52  \r\n \r\n10-64830 20 \r\n \r\nsupport the implementation of global commitments at \r\nboth the policy and the operational levels. \r\n The Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on this agenda item. \r\n The Assembly will now take action on draft \r\nresolution A/65/L.12, entitled “Sustained, inclusive and \r\nequitable economic growth for poverty eradication and \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals”. I \r\ngive the floor to the representative of the Secretariat to \r\nannounce the additional co-sponsors. \r\n Mr. Zhang Saijin (Department for General \r\nAssembly and Conference Management): I should like \r\nto announce that, in addition to the sponsors listed in \r\ndraft resolution A/65/L.12 and those announced by the \r\nrepresentative of the Republic of Korea when he \r\nintroduced the draft resolution, the following countries \r\nhave also become sponsors of A/65/L.12: Guyana, \r\nMontenegro, the Republic of Moldova, San Marino and \r\nUkraine. \r\n The Acting President: May I take it that the \r\nAssembly decides to adopt draft resolution A/65/L.12? \r\n Draft resolution A/65/L.12 was adopted \r\n(resolution 65/10). \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly has thus \r\nconcluded this stage of its consideration of agenda \r\nitems 13, 115 and 120. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 15 (continued) \r\n \r\nCulture of peace \r\n \r\n  Draft resolution A/65/L.8 \r\n \r\n The Acting President: Members will recall that, \r\nat its 32nd and 33rd meetings on 18 October 2010, the \r\nAssembly considered in a joint debate agenda item 14, \r\nentitled “Global agenda for dialogue among \r\ncivilizations”, and agenda item 15, and that at its \r\n34th meeting on 20 October 2010 the General \r\nAssembly adopted resolution 65/5. \r\n I now give the floor to Mr. Mahmood Ali, \r\nMember of Parliament and Chairman of the \r\nParliamentary Standing Committee of the Ministry of \r\nForeign Affairs of Bangladesh, to introduce draft \r\nresolution A/65/L.8. \r\n Mr. Ali (Bangladesh): I take this opportunity to \r\nexpress our sincere condolences to the Government and \r\nthe people of Cambodia for the tragic loss of life in the \r\nstampede on a bridge during the water festival \r\nyesterday. \r\n It is now my privilege to introduce draft \r\nresolution A/65/L.8, entitled “Implementation of the \r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action on a Culture of \r\nPeace”, dated 29 October 2010, at this year’s session \r\non behalf of the sponsors. Since the drafting of the \r\ndraft resolution, the following countries have joined \r\nthe list of sponsors: Afghanistan, Argentina, \r\nAzerbaijan, Bahamas, Belarus, Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina, Burkina Faso, China, Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea, Egypt, El Salvador, \r\nMalaysia, Maldives, Mongolia, Nepal, Peru, Qatar, \r\nRussian Federation, Seychelles, Singapore, Sri Lanka, \r\nSudan, Turkey and Viet Nam. \r\n Since 2001, this draft resolution has been \r\nsubmitted and adopted each year by consensus. That \r\nshows the commitment of the entire global community \r\nto making the world safe for future generations. Here, \r\nlet me quote from the statement delivered by our Prime \r\nMinister, Sheikh Hasina, at this year’s general debate \r\nof the United Nations: \r\n “Our unflinching commitment to peace finds \r\nexpression in our annual flagship Assembly \r\nresolution on the culture of peace. Recent years \r\nhave shown an extraordinary record of \r\nsponsorships because of the reference to \r\nInternational Mother Language Day. Ever since \r\nthe Day was adopted by UNESCO in recognition \r\nof the language martyrs who gave their lives in \r\n1952 for Bangla, their mother tongue, it has been \r\ncelebrated throughout the world with growing \r\nfervour every year.” (A/65/PV.17, p. 17) \r\n Given that backdrop, it is important to continue \r\ndialogue among civilizations and to create a mindset \r\nand environment of tolerance, respect for diversity and \r\ncultural values, since most conflicts and wars begin at \r\nthe level of the heart. It is therefore necessary to \r\nsolidify and strengthen a sense of tolerance and \r\nsensitivity, and a strong relationship between different \r\ncultures, ethnicities, languages and civilizations for the \r\nbetterment of all. In that regard, I would like to \r\nmention Bangladesh’s modest initiative, the \r\nInternational Decade for a Culture of Peace and \r\nNon-violence for the Children of the World (2001-\r\n2010) (resolution 53/25). Bangladesh will continue to \r\nplay a constructive role in that area. \r\n A/65/PV.52\r\n \r\n21 10-64830 \r\n \r\n The culture of peace is a set of values, attitudes, \r\nmodes of behaviour and ways of life that reject \r\nviolence and prevent conflicts through dialogue among \r\nindividuals, groups and nations. We firmly believe that \r\na world order informed by a culture of peace is \r\nconducive to the attainment of our development goals, \r\nincluding the Millennium Development Goals. We see \r\ngreat value in the principles of tolerance, respect for \r\ndiversity, democracy and understanding. Those ideals \r\nwere endorsed by Member States in the 1999 \r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action on a Culture of \r\nPeace (resolution 53/243). Bangladesh had the \r\nprivilege of steering that process. \r\n As we come to the end of the International \r\nDecade for a Culture of Peace, we should start taking \r\nstock of what we have achieved since it began. I \r\nbelieve that that 10-year exercise has had some impact \r\non our psyche in making a peaceful world for all, \r\nespecially for the children of the future, and that in the \r\ndays ahead we should focus on implementation. The \r\nProgramme of Action enjoys universal support. I \r\nsincerely believe that the draft resolution before us will \r\nadvance a culture of peace in eight areas of \r\ncooperation. \r\n One of the areas that should be stressed is that of \r\nraising public awareness and disseminating public \r\ninformation about a culture of peace. The Department \r\nof Public Information should launch a special \r\ninformation strategy for its promotion. For that \r\npurpose, we believe that the Department needs \r\nadequate resources at its disposal. At the national level, \r\nindividual Governments can work to promote a culture \r\nof peace, using both the print and electronic media, in \r\ncollaboration with the relevant ministries. \r\n Proper coordination among the various United \r\nNations agencies is vital. In particular, we welcome the \r\nfact that the UNESCO Executive Board will provide a \r\nspecific budget to that end. We call on the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission (PBC) to reflect a culture \r\nof peace strategy through relevant programmes of \r\naction at the country level. As the coordinator of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement caucus (NAM) on the \r\nCommission, we have raised the subject repeatedly, all \r\nthe more so since the NAM Summits have endorsed it. \r\n We wish to express our profound gratitude to all \r\nthe stakeholders who have contributed, and are \r\ncontributing, to the promotion of a culture of peace. \r\nSpecial thanks go to UNESCO, the lead agency in \r\ncarrying out programmes promoting the idea all over \r\nthe world. Our sincere thanks also go to the non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and members of civil \r\nsociety who are taking the idea of a culture of peace \r\naround the world. We commend the submission of the \r\nCivil Society Report on the Decade for a Culture of \r\nPeace, in particular the role of the Working Group on \r\nthe Culture of Peace at the United Nations. In that \r\nquest, academics and the media also have an important \r\nrole to play. We need to involve young people and \r\nchildren in the process. We should first listen to them \r\nand then take appropriate measures for the betterment \r\nof their lives. \r\n There have been some changes in this year’s draft \r\nresolution on the implementation of the Declaration \r\nand Programme of Action on a Culture of Peace. We \r\nhave added three new preambular paragraphs and one \r\nnew paragraph, as well as amending five other \r\nparagraphs. In the new fourteenth preambular \r\nparagraph, we welcome the summary report of the \r\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural \r\nOrganization High Panel on Peace and Dialogue among \r\nCultures, convened by UNESCO’s Director-General on \r\n18 February, as contained in document A/65/299. In the \r\nnew seventeenth preambular paragraph, we encourage \r\nthe continued and increasing efforts and activities on \r\nthe part of civil society organizations throughout the \r\nworld aimed at advancing the culture of peace as \r\nenvisaged in the Programme of Action on a Culture of \r\nPeace. \r\n Of the five amended paragraphs, paragraph 1 \r\nstates that the objective of the effective implementation \r\nof the Programme of Action on a Culture of Peace is to \r\nstrengthen further the global movement for a culture of \r\npeace following the observance of the International \r\nDecade for a Culture of Peace and Non-violence for \r\nthe Children of the World (2001-2010), and calls on all \r\nconcerned to give renewed attention to that objective. \r\n Amended paragraph 11 welcomes the efforts \r\nundertaken by the United Nations Educational, \r\nScientific and Cultural Organization to continue to \r\nenhance communication and outreach, including \r\nthrough its culture of peace website, along with its \r\nefforts to coordinate and implement its activities to \r\npromote the objectives of the International Decade at \r\nthe regional and global levels. \r\n Immediately after the independence of \r\nBangladesh in 1971, the father of our nation, \r\nA/65/PV.52  \r\n \r\n10-64830 22 \r\n \r\nBangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, pursued a \r\npolicy of friendship towards all and malice towards \r\nnone in the conduct of the country’s international \r\nrelations. That principle has always guided us in our \r\nrelations with countries around the globe, especially \r\nour neighbours. Our peacekeepers are assisting United \r\nNations peacekeeping operations, even at the cost of \r\ntheir lives in difficult terrain in various parts of the \r\nworld in the simple pursuit of peace. They also carry \r\nthe idea of the culture of peace in their hearts and are \r\nputting the idea into action. \r\n As a member of the United Nations \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, we are discharging our \r\nresponsibilities there with those same ideas in mind. \r\nWe believe that a culture of peace holds the key to \r\nsustainable peace in post-conflict societies. Even in \r\nsocieties that are enjoying peace or apparent peace, we \r\nhave to nurture that idea, so that no one can even \r\nconsider violating the peace. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to extend our \r\nprofound gratitude to all the Member States that have \r\nshown their solidarity by co-sponsoring this annual \r\ndraft resolution over the last 10 years. Last year, we \r\nhad as many as 118 sponsors, and I hope this year the \r\nnumber of sponsors will be even higher. The increase \r\nin the number of sponsors in each successive year has \r\nbeen a matter of great encouragement to the delegation \r\nof Bangladesh. \r\n In view of the time constraints, the current draft \r\nresolution was not able to enjoy the endorsement of \r\nmore sponsors. I would request my colleagues from \r\nother Missions to co-sponsor the draft resolution by \r\nproviding their valuable endorsement to it now. \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\ntake action on draft resolution A/65/L.8, entitled \r\n“Implementation of the Declaration and Programme of \r\nAction on a Culture of Peace”. May I take it that the \r\nAssembly decides to adopt draft resolution A/65/L.8? \r\n Draft resolution A/65/L.8 was adopted (resolution \r\n65/11). \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly has thus \r\nconcluded this stage of its consideration of agenda \r\nitem 15. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 73 (continued) \r\n \r\nReport of the International Criminal Court \r\n \r\n  Draft resolution A/65/L.13 \r\n \r\n The Acting President: Members will recall that \r\nthe Assembly heard the debate on this agenda item at \r\nits 39th and 41st meetings on 28 and 29 October 2010, \r\nrespectively. In connection with this item, the \r\nAssembly now has before it a draft resolution issued as \r\ndocument A/65/L.13. \r\n I now give the floor to the representative of the \r\nNetherlands to introduce draft resolution A/65/L.13. \r\n Mr. Schaper (Netherlands): I have the honour to \r\nintroduce under agenda item 73 draft resolution \r\nA/65/L.13, entitled “Report of the International \r\nCriminal Court”. Let me begin by saying that, in \r\naddition to the 85 countries mentioned in document \r\nA/65/L.13, which contains the text of the draft \r\nresolution, the following countries have indicated their \r\nwish to be included as its sponsors: Bangladesh, \r\nBarbados, Botswana, Central African Republic, \r\nDominica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Georgia, \r\nJapan, Mauritius, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, \r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines, Senegal and \r\nUruguay, which brings the total number of sponsors to \r\nexactly 100. \r\n On 28 October 2010, the President of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court, Judge Sang-Hyun Song, \r\npresented the sixth annual report of the International \r\nCriminal Court (ICC) to this body. Subsequently, we \r\nhad a very constructive and in-depth debate, a few \r\nelements of which I would like to mention here. \r\n First, in order to ensure the Court’s success, \r\nuniversal adherence to the Rome Statute of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court remains crucial. We are \r\ntherefore pleased to welcome the countries that have \r\nrecently become a party to the Rome Statute — \r\nBangladesh, Seychelles, Saint Lucia and the Republic \r\nof Moldova. The addition of those new parties brings \r\nthe total number of States that have ratified or acceded \r\nto the Rome Statute to 114. It is our sincere hope that \r\nothers will join soon. \r\n Secondly, the debate on 28 and 29 October made \r\nit clear once again that the establishment of the Court \r\nwas the most significant development of the last \r\ndecade in our long and ongoing struggle to eradicate \r\nimpunity, a struggle that still continues. Considerable \r\n A/65/PV.52\r\n \r\n23 10-64830 \r\n \r\nattention was given to the landmark event of this year, \r\nthe Review Conference of the Rome Statute, which \r\nwas held from 31 May to 11 June in Kampala. The \r\nmain outcome of the Conference was the adoption of \r\namendments to the Rome Statute that sought to define \r\nthe crime of aggression and establish conditions under \r\nwhich the Court could exercise jurisdiction with \r\nrespect to that crime. The participation of the \r\nSecretary-General, who convened and opened the \r\nConference, and several high-level United Nations \r\nofficials served as a powerful reminder of the strong \r\nconnection between the United Nations and the Court. \r\n Thirdly, the International Criminal Court’s annual \r\nreport and the debate in the General Assembly \r\nunderlined the role of the Court in our common efforts \r\nto build an international community characterized, not \r\nonly by the rule of law and respect for human rights, \r\nbut also by peace and security. Sustainable peace \r\ncannot be achieved if perpetrators of the most serious \r\ncrimes are not brought to justice. Peace and justice are \r\ncomplementary and both are necessary. \r\n The fourth element I would like to highlight is a \r\nfact that the President of the ICC drew attention to, \r\nnamely, that, despite the recent successful arrest of an \r\naccused, the situation with respect to the outstanding \r\narrest warrants is deeply troubling. The Court is \r\ncompletely reliant on State cooperation in the \r\nenforcement of its orders and decisions. If States do \r\nnot provide the cooperation necessary for the Court’s \r\nfunctioning in accordance with their legal obligations, \r\nit will not be able to fulfil its mandate, and impunity \r\nwill continue to flourish. \r\n The cooperation of States, international \r\norganizations and civil society is essential to the \r\nCourt’s functioning, not only in relation to the arrest \r\nand surrender of accused persons, but also in relation \r\nto the provision of evidence, the protection and \r\nrelocation of victims and witnesses, and the \r\nenforcement of sentences. We are therefore pleased \r\nthat the United Nations has continued over the past \r\nyear to assist the Court in its endeavours through \r\nimplementation of the Relationship Agreement. We \r\nalso welcome the assistance provided so far by States \r\nparties and non-States parties and call on all States to \r\ncontinue to support the Court’s efforts in that respect. \r\n Last but not least, it was stressed during the \r\ndebate that the hallmark of the Court is its \r\nindependence and its judicial nature. At the same time, \r\nthat judicial institution operates within a political \r\nworld, and it needs States to cooperate with it while \r\nalso respecting, protecting and enhancing its judicial \r\nindependence. \r\n The draft resolution before us serves three main \r\nobjectives. First, the draft resolution serves to provide \r\npolitical support for the International Criminal Court as \r\nan organization, for its mandate and aims, and for the \r\nwork it is carrying out. Secondly, it serves to underline \r\nthe importance of the relationship between the Court \r\nand the United Nations on the basis of the Relationship \r\nAgreement, as both the United Nations and the Court \r\nhave a central role in enhancing the system of \r\ninternational criminal justice. Finally, the draft \r\nresolution serves to remind States and international and \r\nregional organizations of the need to cooperate with \r\nthe Court in carrying out its tasks. \r\n The Netherlands hopes that the draft resolution \r\nwill be adopted by consensus and that it will lead to \r\neven greater support for the International Criminal \r\nCourt in the fight against impunity and in its attempts \r\nto hold perpetrators of very serious crimes accountable \r\nfor their actions. \r\n The Acting President: We shall now proceed to \r\nconsider draft resolution A/65/L.13, entitled “Report of \r\nthe International Criminal Court”. Before giving the \r\nfloor to speakers in explanation of vote before the vote, \r\nmay I remind delegations that explanations of vote are \r\nlimited to 10 minutes and should be made by \r\ndelegations from their seats. \r\n Mr. Ajawin (Sudan): My delegation would like \r\nto take this opportunity to dissociate itself from draft \r\nresolution A/65/L.13 on the report of the International \r\nCriminal Court (ICC) for the following reasons. \r\n Principally, the Sudan is not a member of the \r\nRome Statute and I would therefore like to remind this \r\nbody of the provisions of the 1969 Vienna Convention \r\non the Law of Treaties, which clearly exempts States \r\nthat are not party to an international treaty from being \r\nbound by legal obligations under that treaty. Having \r\ncarefully studied the sixth annual report of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court, which covers the period \r\nfrom 1 August 2009 to 31 July 2010 (A/65/313) and on \r\nwhich the proposed draft resolution is based, my \r\ndelegation was greatly disappointed at the distorted \r\ninformation regarding my country contained in that \r\nreport. \r\nA/65/PV.52  \r\n \r\n10-64830 24 \r\n \r\n We believe those unfounded allegations are \r\nbaseless, lack strong legal justification and must \r\ntherefore be seen as politically motivated. However, it \r\nis precisely the International Criminal Court’s \r\npartiality and its politicization and double standards \r\nunder the guise of administering international justice \r\nthat have made my country adamant in refusing to \r\ncooperate with the Court. \r\n The referral of the case of Darfur by the Security \r\nCouncil to the Court was heavily influenced by \r\npolitical considerations on the part of some countries \r\nand not based on legal reasoning. The Security Council \r\nis a political organ, and it will be fit to refer cases to \r\nany relevant international legal institutions only when \r\nit has been reformed and its composition is truly \r\nreflective of the four corners of the world, based on \r\nequitable geographical representation, which include \r\ngranting Africa two permanent seats with all the \r\nprivileges that come with being a permanent member. \r\n The Sudan played an instrumental role in the \r\ninitial drafting of the Rome Statute, which eventually \r\nled to the formation of the International Criminal \r\nCourt, and the adoption of the Rome Statute in 1998. \r\nThe behaviour and practices of the International \r\nCriminal Court to date are contrary to the principles, \r\nobjectives and spirit on which the Court was founded. \r\nIt is to be recalled that, during the early stages of \r\nestablishment of the Court, my country sounded the \r\nalarm about the possible politicization of legal issues \r\nby the Court and voiced concern that the relationship \r\nbetween the Court and the Security Council, in \r\naccordance with article 13 (b) of the Rome Statute, \r\ncould be used and monopolized by some countries as a \r\nTrojan horse in order to advance their own political \r\ninterests, with the possibility of violating the norms \r\nand customs of international law. \r\n Today, our predictions, made after the initial \r\ndrafting of what became the Rome Statute, have come \r\ntrue. The selectivity of justice and the double standards \r\nshown by the Court in respect of Africa have generated \r\ncondemnation from the highest political organ of a \r\nleading regional organization. The Organization of the \r\nIslamic Conference, the Arab League and the African \r\nunion have issued statements and resolutions \r\ncondemning the Court and its Pre-Trial Chamber for \r\nissuing the so-called arrest warrant. Decision \r\n245 (XIII) of the Assembly of the African Union \r\nexplicitly and unequivocally states in paragraph 10 that \r\nAfrican Union member States \r\n “shall not cooperate pursuant to the provisions of \r\nArticle 98 of the Rome Statute of the ICC relating \r\nto immunities, for the arrest and surrender of \r\nPresident Omar El Bashir of the Sudan”. \r\nIt has created the perception that the Court is not a \r\nneutral institution legally speaking, but is indeed \r\nheavily politicized, which therefore politicizes the \r\nconcept of justice as well. Without a shadow of a \r\ndoubt, that politicization of the concept of justice will \r\neventually lead to the militarization of international \r\nrelations and disregard for multilateralism, along with \r\nthe erosion of the commitment to the United Nations \r\nCharter and the cardinal principles of international law. \r\n The targeting of some African heads of State and \r\nother African officials entitled to jurisdictional \r\nimmunity is an affront to the sovereign equality of \r\nAfrican States. That affront will lead to injustice and \r\nundue harassment of African dignitaries and will \r\nconstrain the capability and competence of African \r\nStates to act as subjects of international law with \r\ninternational legal personalities that enable them to \r\nconduct foreign affairs and participate in international \r\naffairs. \r\n It is of imperative importance to note that the \r\nInternational Court of Justice has, in some instances, \r\nreaffirmed the rights of diplomatic immunity as a \r\ncardinal principle of customary international law. \r\nNevertheless, the Court is of the contrary view with \r\nregard to the immunity of heads of State, which is \r\nevident in last year’s report of the International \r\nCriminal Court (A/64/356), in which the Court stated \r\nthat the status of the President of the Republic of the \r\nSudan, His Excellency Omar Hassan Ahmad Al-Bashir, \r\n“as Head of a State not party to the Rome Statute had \r\nno effect on the Court’s exercise of jurisdiction” \r\n(para. 15). That statement contradicts the provisions of \r\narticle 98, paragraph 1, of the Rome Statute, which \r\nstates that \r\n “The Court may not proceed with a request for \r\nsurrender or assistance which would require the \r\nrequested State to act inconsistently with its \r\nobligations under international law with respect \r\nto the State or diplomatic immunity of a person or \r\nproperty of a third State, unless the Court can \r\nfirst obtain the cooperation of that third State for \r\nthe waiver of the immunity.” \r\nThe Court has also blatantly ignored the sovereignty of \r\nthe Sudanese State by acting unilaterally to waive the \r\n A/65/PV.52\r\n \r\n25 10-64830 \r\n \r\nPresident’s immunity before seeking the consent of that \r\nState, as required under article 98 of the Rome Statute. \r\n The statement by the Court regarding the exercise \r\nof its jurisdiction upon an acting head of State without \r\nobtaining cooperation from the State concerned clearly \r\ndemonstrates the excessive and abusive powers vested \r\nin the Prosecutor of the Court. The ICC Prosecutor has \r\nbecome a law unto himself and even an interpreter of \r\nthe provisions of the Rome Statute according to his \r\nown wishes, without due consideration for the norms \r\nand practices of international law, peace and security. \r\n It is precisely because of that unchecked power of \r\nthe Prosecutor that the ICC is in danger of substituting \r\nthe tyranny of Government for the rule of judges. \r\n The Acting President: We have heard the only \r\nspeaker in explanation of vote before the vote. The \r\nAssembly will now take a decision on draft resolution \r\nA/65/L.13. May I take it that the Assembly decides to \r\nadopt draft resolution A/65/L.13? \r\n Draft resolution A/65/L.13 was adopted \r\n(resolution 65/12). \r\n The Acting President: May I take it that it is the \r\nwish of the General Assembly to conclude its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 73? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n \r\nProgramme of work \r\n \r\n The Acting President: I should like to consult \r\nmembers regarding an extension for the work of the \r\nSecond Committee. Members will recall that, at its 2nd  \r\n \r\n \r\nplenary meeting on 17 September 2010, the General \r\nAssembly approved the recommendation of the \r\nGeneral Committee that the Second Committee would \r\ncomplete its work by Tuesday, 23 November 2010. \r\nHowever, the President of the General Assembly has \r\nbeen informed by the Chairperson of the Second \r\nCommittee that the Committee will not be able to \r\nfinish its work by today, 23 November 2010. It is my \r\nunderstanding that the Committee will need to meet \r\nuntil Wednesday, 1 December 2010. May I therefore \r\ntake it that the General Assembly agrees to extend the \r\nwork of the Second Committee until Wednesday, 1 \r\nDecember 2010? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The Acting President: I would also like to \r\ninform members that the consideration of agenda \r\nitem 117, “Implementation of the resolutions of the \r\nUnited Nations”, and agenda item 118, “Revitalization \r\nof the work of the General Assembly”, scheduled for \r\nThursday, 2 December 2010, has been postponed to \r\nMonday, 6 December 2010. \r\n I also wish to remind delegations that they are \r\ninvited to complete the survey of conference services \r\nin order to improve the quality of services provided by \r\nthe Department for General Assembly and Conference \r\nManagement. The survey may be accessed until \r\nMonday, 13 December 2010 from a number of United \r\nNations websites, including the General Assembly \r\nwebsite. More information in this regard can be found \r\nin the United Nations Journal. \r\n  The meeting rose at 12.50 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
