(Switzerland) \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 37 (continued) \r\n \r\nQuestion of Palestine \r\n \r\n  Report of the Committee on the Exercise of the \r\nInalienable Rights of the Palestinian People \r\n(A/65/35) \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/65/380 and \r\nA/65/380/Add.1) \r\n \r\n  Draft resolutions (A/65/L.14, A/65/L.15, \r\nA/65/L.16, A/65/L.17 and A/65/L.24) \r\n \r\n Mr. Mashabane (South Africa): We wish to \r\nthank the Secretary-General for his report on the \r\npeaceful settlement of the question of Palestine \r\n(A/65/380 and A/65/380/Add.1), which confirms \r\nassertions that peace is indeed elusive and remains a \r\ndistant dream for the people of Palestine. We hope that \r\ntoday’s debate will generate and consolidate \r\nmomentum for a peaceful resolution to the question of \r\nPalestine. \r\n My delegation associates itself with the statement \r\nmade yesterday afternoon by the representative of \r\nEgypt on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement. \r\n Yesterday, we pledged our solidarity with the \r\nstruggle of the Palestinian people when we \r\ncommemorated the International Day of Solidarity with \r\nthe Palestinian People. In his message of solidarity, the \r\nPresident of the Republic of South Africa, Mr. Jacob \r\nZuma, reaffirmed South Africa’s commitment to the \r\nPalestinian people in their struggle for liberation and \r\nself-determination. \r\n At the beginning of this session of the General \r\nAssembly, world leaders travelled from far and wide to \r\naffirm the centrality of the United Nations in \r\ndeliberating and resolving world affairs. Leaders also \r\nconfirmed the centrality of the Organization in the \r\npeaceful resolution of disputes. As a beneficiary of the \r\nhard work of the international community, South Africa \r\ncould not agree more with that assertion. \r\n We therefore call on the United Nations to \r\nleverage its legitimacy and unity of effort to accelerate \r\nattempts to deliver the people of Palestine from the \r\ninhuman occupation by Israel. We also hope that \r\nduring this session the United Nations will reflect \r\nconcretely on the effectiveness of its collective efforts \r\ntowards the resolution of the question of Palestine. \r\nSouth Africa has always stood steadfastly in support of \r\nthe right of the Palestinian people to a State of their \r\nown, consistent with the call for the creation of a \r\nPalestinian State that coexists peacefully alongside \r\nIsrael on the basis of the 1967 borders and with East \r\nJerusalem as its capital. We firmly believe that this is \r\nthe only sustainable solution to the conflict. \r\n We have consistently supported a peaceful \r\nsolution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, in line with \r\nthe will of the international community as expressed in \r\nnumerous peace initiatives, such as the Road Map and \r\nthe Arab Peace Initiative, and including Security \r\nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973), 465 \r\n(1980), 681 (1990), 1397 (2002), 1515 (2003) and \r\nA/65/PV.54  \r\n \r\n10-65877 2 \r\n \r\n1860 (2009). We call on Israel to respect the spirit of \r\nthese resolutions and abide by the prescripts of all \r\nother international legal instruments. The failure to do \r\nso, as has been the case for many years, amounts to \r\nviolation of international law. Despite all those \r\ninitiatives, Israel has freely continued its occupation of \r\nPalestinian territory, thus deliberately undermining the \r\ncredibility of the United Nations. \r\n When direct talks between Israel and Palestine \r\nbegan in September, we all hoped that they would lead \r\nto meaningful progress that would result in lasting \r\npeace and the creation of a viable Palestinian State. \r\nHowever, Israel’s failure to renew the moratorium on \r\nthe building of illegal settlements in the occupied \r\nterritories has created an obstacle to that progress. \r\nSouth Africa views the halting of settlement \r\nconstruction as a commitment already agreed to by \r\nIsrael during previous peace negotiations, including the \r\nAnnapolis Middle East Peace Conference in November \r\n2007, in which South Africa participated. \r\n We note with grave concern Israel’s show of \r\ncontempt for the peace process, as demonstrated by the \r\ncontinuation of settlement construction and its \r\nannouncement of plans to build more settlements in the \r\nWest Bank. By continuing with such settlements, Israel \r\nexpedites the alteration of the demographic \r\ncomposition, legal status and landscape of occupied \r\nPalestinian territories, including East Jerusalem. In \r\norder to salvage the peace process, we call on Israel to \r\nhalt the building of settlements, as this will \r\ndemonstrate its serious intention to bring about a \r\npeaceful solution to the Palestinian question. We also \r\nsupport the mediation efforts by the Arab world, and by \r\nEgypt in particular, to achieve reconciliation between \r\nFatah and Hamas and intra-Palestinian unity. It is our \r\nfirm belief that a united Palestine will better serve the \r\ninterests of the Palestinian people. \r\n South Africa is encouraged by the steady progress \r\nin the Palestinian Authority’s State-building agenda, in \r\naccordance with Prime Minister Fayyad’s strategy. In \r\nthat regard, we appreciate the efforts of the \r\ninternational donor community in support of the \r\nstrategy. We also call on other stakeholders to provide \r\nsupport for the implementation and sustainability of \r\nthat initiative. With regard to security, we welcome the \r\ninternational community’s efforts to improve the \r\ncapacity of the Palestinian security institutions. \r\n The promulgation of a decision by Israeli \r\nauthorities in June to ease the blockade of Gaza by \r\nallowing unrestricted entry for all items except those \r\non a published list of military and dual-use items has \r\nnot positively altered the situation, as construction \r\nmaterials, which are mainly classified as dual-use, are \r\nwhat is most needed for the reconstruction of Gaza. \r\nThe blockade of Gaza has adversely affected the \r\neconomic life of Palestinians, as their export activities \r\nhave been seriously curtailed. \r\n Consequently, these acts in Gaza and other \r\noccupied territories contribute directly to increasing \r\nunemployment and poverty, thereby having an impact \r\non the full enjoyment of social and economic \r\nfreedoms. In addition, we also condemn the uprooting \r\nof olive trees and the theft of agricultural equipment by \r\nIsraeli settlers, which are critical to the Palestinian \r\neconomy. \r\n Three million dollars has been pledged for \r\nprojects in Gaza through the India, Brazil and South \r\nAfrica (IBSA) mechanism. IBSA-proposed projects \r\nwill positively contribute to the socio-economic \r\ndevelopment of the people of Palestine, especially \r\nthose in Gaza. \r\n On the humanitarian front, we appeal to Israel to \r\nease entry into Gaza, especially for humanitarian \r\nagencies, including the United Nations Relief and \r\nWorks Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East \r\nand the United Nations Development Programme. In \r\nthat regard, we are pleased by the humanitarian \r\ncommunity’s finalization of the 2011 consolidated \r\nappeal, which will be presented in Brussels on \r\n30 November. \r\n In conclusion, we call on the parties to desist \r\nfrom unilateral actions that have the potential to \r\njeopardize the negotiations, and to focus instead on \r\nconfidence-building measures conducive to the \r\nresumption of peace negotiations. We also extend our \r\nsupport to the peace process and urge the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, including the Quartet and other countries’ \r\ninstitutions, to continue to encourage the parties to go \r\nback to the negotiating table. More important, we call \r\non the parties to demonstrate the necessary political \r\nwill to find a solution. The parties should never forget \r\nthat peace is in the interest of the most downtrodden, \r\nincluding women and children. \r\n A/65/PV.54\r\n \r\n3 10-65877 \r\n \r\n Mrs. Viotti (Brazil): It is most appropriate that \r\nthe General Assembly discuss the question of \r\nPalestine, given the importance of the issue for the \r\ninternational community as a whole, especially at this \r\ncrucial juncture in the peace process. The end of the \r\nIsraeli moratorium on settlements in September put to \r\nthe test, early and severely, the fragile start to direct \r\nnegotiations between Israelis and Palestinians. The \r\nfailure to extend the moratorium on settlement \r\nactivities in the occupied Palestinian territories and the \r\nreported construction that has occurred since made it \r\nvery difficult for negotiations to resume, as such \r\nactivity is destroying the feasibility of a two-State \r\nsolution. It is not reasonable to expect the Palestinians \r\nto keep negotiating as reality on the ground is \r\ndeeply — and, some fear, irreversibly — altered. This \r\nis particularly worrisome when it comes to East \r\nJerusalem and small- and medium-sized settlements \r\ndeep in the West Bank. In the current circumstances, \r\ntherefore, a complete halt to settlement activity by \r\nIsrael is not only a legal obligation but also a necessary \r\ncondition for negotiations to continue and to have a \r\nchance at succeeding. \r\n Brazil commends the efforts made by the United \r\nStates and a number of other stakeholders to revive \r\ndirect negotiations. We also commend the admirable \r\npatience shown by the Palestinians. We hope that Israel \r\nwill seize this opportunity and create the conditions \r\nnecessary for negotiations to resume, if for no other \r\nreason than simply because, contrary to what some \r\nmay think, the status quo is truly unsustainable. The \r\nstatus quo is also dangerous, as it plays into the hands \r\nof radical groups from both sides that seek to \r\nundermine the peace process. \r\n We firmly condemn all acts of violence from all \r\nquarters; but condemnation is not enough. Israel must \r\nnot tolerate, and must actively prosecute, settlers \r\ninvolved in attacks against, or harassment of, \r\nPalestinians. Rocket fire from Gaza into southern Israel \r\nmust stop, and Israeli forces must not react \r\ndisproportionately. \r\n On its part, the Palestinian Authority must \r\ncontinue to make progress in maintaining law and \r\norder in the areas under its jurisdiction. Breaking the \r\nold pattern of conflict is key to preventing both the \r\nresumption of armed conflict between Israel and Gaza \r\nand the intensification of street violence in the West \r\nBank and East Jerusalem. \r\n In fulfilling the vision of a democratic and viable \r\nPalestinian State, Palestinians should continue to \r\naddress two key challenges, namely, overcoming their \r\ninternal divisions and enhancing democratic \r\ngovernance. We call on all Palestinian groups to \r\nrebuild unity, without which statehood will be \r\nexceedingly difficult to achieve. We also praise, and \r\nextend our full support for, Prime Minister Salam \r\nFayyad’s sustained efforts to build a democratic and \r\neffective Palestinian State throughout the territories. \r\nAmong other measures, Israel must actively support \r\nsuch an endeavour by transferring more territory to the \r\nAuthority’s control and further easing restrictions on \r\nmovement in the West Bank. \r\n The humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip \r\ncontinues to be a source of grave concern. The easing \r\nof the blockade is welcome, but access to basic goods \r\nclearly remains insufficient. It is deeply disturbing to \r\nacknowledge once again that not enough progress has \r\nbeen made to restore the freedom of movement for \r\npeople and goods. Fully lifting the blockade, without \r\nprejudice to legitimate Israeli security concerns, is vital \r\nto allow life in Gaza to return to normal and \r\nreconstruction to take place. \r\n On our part, as much as we can, we will continue \r\nto provide help to alleviate the suffering of the \r\nPalestinian people. Apart from our bilateral \r\ncooperation, we are engaged in a project under the \r\nIndia, Brazil and South Africa (IBSA) forum for the \r\npartial reconstruction of the Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza, \r\nwith resources allocated from the IBSA fund. \r\n It is not too late to reverse the current deadlock \r\nand begin to move in earnest towards the end of the \r\nIsraeli occupation and the realization of the vision of \r\ntwo States living side by side in peace and security \r\nwithin internationally recognized borders. Success, \r\nhowever, requires statesmanship, political courage and \r\ntrue attachment to sustainable peace. Leaders on both \r\nsides, especially in Israel, the stronger party, must rise \r\nto the challenge. Their prize will be unfading \r\nrecognition of their exceptional achievement, not only \r\nby their fellow citizens but also by the entire \r\ninternational community. \r\n Mr. Loulichki (Morocco) (spoke in Arabic): At \r\nthe outset, I would like to thank you, Sir, for convening \r\nthis important meeting on developments over the past \r\nfew years concerning the issue of Palestine. I would \r\nalso like to congratulate Ambassador Abdou Salam \r\nA/65/PV.54  \r\n \r\n10-65877 4 \r\n \r\nDiallo, Permanent Representative of Senegal, on his \r\nelection to the chairmanship of the Committee on the \r\nExercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian \r\nPeople, who succeeded Mr. Paul Badji, who lent \r\nexcellent services vis-à-vis the question of Palestine \r\nduring his chairmanship of the Committee. \r\n Each year on 29 November, the United Nations \r\ncommemorates the Day of Solidarity with the \r\nPalestinian People, during which the international \r\ncommunity recalls the inalienable rights and the \r\naspirations of the Palestinian people to establish a \r\nviable independent State, with East Jerusalem as its \r\ncapital, on the land that has been occupied by Israel \r\nsince 1967. \r\n The Palestinian people are exasperated by the fact \r\nthat the years continue to pass with no prospects on the \r\nhorizon for achieving status as a national entity. \r\nPalestine has been occupied for decades, during which \r\nit has suffered aggression, tragedy and destruction. It is \r\ntired of waiting — and of waiting for negotiations that \r\nbegin only to be stopped, and that are resumed only to \r\nbe postponed. It is time to implement resolutions of \r\ninternational legitimacy, which have followed one after \r\nanother with no real impact on the ground for millions \r\nof Palestinians. Finally, Palestine awaits the \r\nimplementation of international initiatives and \r\ncommitments that include all the necessary elements \r\nfor a comprehensive and just peace based on the \r\nconsensus of the international community as a whole. \r\n As we evaluate developments on the Palestinian \r\nquestion, we note the continuing flagrant \r\ncontradictions between the efforts of the international \r\ncommunity to resume peace negotiations and \r\ndevelopments on the ground through which Israel, the \r\noccupying Power, seeks to impose a de facto reality \r\nthat continues to hinder the peace process. \r\n Based on its principled position on peace as a \r\nstrategic choice, in the context of the Arab Peace \r\nInitiative and as supported by United Nations \r\nresolutions and other terms of reference, the Kingdom \r\nof Morocco has supported the positive and dynamic \r\ninitiative launched by President Obama to encourage \r\nthe Palestinian side to participate in indirect talks in \r\nMarch. The direct talks held in Washington in \r\nSeptember under the auspices of the United States were \r\nnotable for the good faith shown on the Arab side \r\naimed at taking advantage of the occasion to move \r\ntowards peace. Morocco appreciates President Obama’s \r\ncontinuing efforts to put the peace process back on \r\ntrack. We also appreciate the President’s statement to \r\nthe General Assembly in September on the rights of the \r\nPalestinian people, especially their right to the \r\nestablishment of an independent State within a \r\ndefinitive time frame (see A/65/PV.11). At the same \r\ntime, we support all international parties who share this \r\nopinion and who seek to translate that vision into \r\nreality. \r\n Palestine’s attitude throughout the process has \r\ndemonstrated courage, practicality and persistence and \r\nhas shown that it is a real and serious partner in the \r\npeace process, in spite of the continuing frustration and \r\nsuffering of the Palestinian people. Through the Arab \r\nPeace Initiative, Arab States have shown that they \r\nsupport the aspirations of the people of the region and \r\nof the international community to live in peace, \r\nsecurity and stability. Arab States have also shouldered \r\ntheir responsibility towards present and future \r\ngenerations and the international community. \r\n In spite of this courageous Arab initiative and all \r\nthe efforts of the international community, Israel \r\ncontinues its practices and policies aimed at imposing a \r\nfait accompli and pre-empting the results of the \r\nnegotiations, which runs counter to its obligations and \r\nthe seriousness required vis-à-vis the two-State \r\nsolution. It has continued its illegal settlement policies \r\nin the occupied Palestinian territories, including East \r\nJerusalem, in an attempt to annex more land by force. \r\nTo that end, just days after the Arab side agreed to \r\nindirect negotiations, Israeli authorities announced \r\ntheir decision to build 1,600 housing units in East \r\nJerusalem. Israel also decided to build another 1,300 \r\nunits in East Jerusalem and issued new legislation \r\nspecifying new conditions for withdrawing from \r\noccupied East Jerusalem and the Syrian Golan. \r\n With regard to Jerusalem, which is an important \r\naspect of the Palestinian question, Israel has continued \r\nits policies of Judaization, annexation and deportation \r\nof the population of the Holy City, which include the \r\nconfiscation and destruction of property. It has also \r\ncontinued its policy of provocation with regard to \r\nMuslim and Christian holy sites, including the Al-Aqsa \r\nMosque and its environs. It has also attacked other \r\nholy sites, including the Al-Haram Al-Ibrahimi and \r\nsites in Bethlehem, as part of a policy aimed at \r\nincreasing tension and religious incitement. \r\n A/65/PV.54\r\n \r\n5 10-65877 \r\n \r\n The Kingdom of Morocco, including its leader, \r\nHis Majesty Mohammed VI, who chairs the Al-Quds \r\nCommittee, reaffirms its solidarity with the Palestinian \r\npeople in their quest to create a national State. \r\nMoreover, Morocco condemns all acts against the \r\nspecial status of the Holy City. In that regard, I would \r\nlike to reiterate our call for the establishment of an \r\ninternational alliance comprised of all those who desire \r\npeace, coexistence and tolerance, with a view to \r\npreserving Jerusalem as a symbol of peace and the \r\ncradle of monotheistic religions. \r\n With regard to the Gaza Strip, the grave \r\nhumanitarian situation there demands that the Israeli \r\nauthorities immediately lift the illegal blockade and \r\nallow the free movement of goods in and out of Gaza, \r\npermanently, unconditionally and without restrictions, \r\nin keeping with international humanitarian law and the \r\nrelevant international resolutions. While we appreciate \r\nthe efforts of the United Nations Relief and Works \r\nAgency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East in that \r\nconnection, we would like to underscore the mandate \r\ngiven to the Agency by the General Assembly in \r\nresolution 302 (IV) of 1949 to provide assistance to \r\nPalestinian refugees until the issue is settled in a \r\nsatisfactory and lasting manner. \r\n His Majesty Mohammed VI underscored the \r\nsignificance of the cause of peace in the Middle East in \r\nhis message to the World Economic Forum on the \r\nMiddle East and North Africa in October, where he \r\nsaid that \r\n “The road to peace in the Middle East has to be \r\nthrough a two-State solution that guarantees the \r\nestablishment of an independent Palestinian State, \r\nwith Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital, living in \r\npeace and security alongside the State of Israel, \r\nin accordance with international legitimacy. This \r\ngoal should be achieved through direct \r\nnegotiation, without any obduracy, escalation or \r\nunilateral, illegitimate measures.” \r\n His Majesty the King therefore sent out a \r\nmessage of hope and prudence to restart serious \r\nnegotiations, saying that he urged the parties \r\n “to engage in serious negotiations according to \r\nthe wishes of the international community. That is \r\nthe right way to achieve security for all peoples \r\nin the region and to put an end to violence and \r\nextremism, which are fuelling instability, \r\nweakening opportunities for economic and social \r\ndevelopment and undermining the region’s status \r\nand clout with respect to international \r\ncooperation.” \r\n Mr. Wetland (Norway): Every year, we seem to \r\nreach a critical juncture in the Middle East. And every \r\nyear, in retrospect, we end up with a missed \r\nopportunity. However, Norway wants to underline that \r\n2011 could represent an important crossroads in the \r\npeace process. \r\n A Palestinian State structure is emerging, \r\nscheduled for completion by August next year. The \r\none-year timeline for the direct negotiations will expire \r\nat around the same time. Those two tracks — the State-\r\nbuilding track and the political track — are set to \r\nconverge in the two-State solution. We may finally see \r\nthe day when the independent Palestinian State \r\nemerges. \r\n The bottom-up track — the State-building \r\nprocess — has been successful. Under the leadership of \r\nPrime Minister Salam Fayyad, increasingly robust \r\nPalestinian institutions are in place. The Palestinian \r\nAuthority is cutting spending and bringing deficits \r\ndown. Dependency on foreign aid is decreasing at a \r\nsteady rate, and transparency and accountability \r\ncontinue to replace corruption and nepotism. There is a \r\ngrowing sense of security and the rule of law in \r\nPalestinian communities in the West Bank. On all \r\nfronts Palestinian society is evolving, and among \r\nPalestinians there is a growing sense that the changes \r\ntaking place today hold promise for a better tomorrow. \r\n The process is so successful that the World Bank \r\nstated, in its report to the donor community in \r\nSeptember this year, that the Palestinian Authority is \r\nnow “well-positioned for the establishment of a State \r\nat any point in the near future”. \r\n At the same time, direct negotiations launched in \r\nSeptember this year with the goal of reaching a \r\nsettlement of the conflict within one year, have stalled \r\nover Israel’s decision to let the partial moratorium on \r\nsettlement activity in the occupied territory expire. The \r\nlack of progress at the negotiating table has led some \r\nPalestinians to question the viability of negotiations \r\nand to contemplate alternative paths to the two-State \r\nsolution. Norway firmly believes that there is no \r\nalternative to negotiations, but, if we wish to restore \r\nthe confidence of Palestinians in the political process, \r\nthe situation on the ground must improve. That \r\nincludes the ending of settlement activity in East \r\nA/65/PV.54  \r\n \r\n10-65877 6 \r\n \r\nJerusalem and the West Bank, in accordance with Road \r\nMap obligations. It also includes efforts by Israel to \r\nstrengthen economic development and improve \r\neconomic growth and living standards in the occupied \r\nterritories. \r\n The donor community has done its utmost to \r\nhonour its commitments to the Palestinian State-\r\nbuilding process, despite the challenges caused by the \r\nglobal financial downturn. As Chair of the Ad Hoc \r\nLiaison Committee, Norway can confirm the donor \r\ncommunity’s determination to help the Palestinian \r\nState-building process past the finishing line in 2011. \r\nBut at the same time, we must sound a word of \r\nwarning: continued financial support for Palestinian \r\ninstitutions depends on a credible political process. \r\nWithout a political horizon and a clear timeline, it \r\nbecomes increasingly hard to justify high levels of \r\ncontributions. \r\n As we look to 2011, we can rest assured that the \r\nefforts to build Palestinian institutions and to prepare \r\nfor statehood will continue as planned. And the \r\ntimeline for the completion of negotiations by \r\nSeptember next year is there. In other words: 2011 \r\nshould be the year when the conflict is resolved and the \r\nPalestinian State is established. \r\n Mr. Falamarzi (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): I \r\nwould like to begin by commending the Committee on \r\nthe Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian \r\nPeople for its efforts to shed light on the suffering of \r\nthe Palestinian people resulting from the unjust \r\npractices of the Israeli authorities. I would also like to \r\nthank Mr. Paul Badji for conducting the work of that \r\nCommittee. My delegation also associates itself with \r\nthe statement delivered by the representative of Egypt \r\non behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement. \r\n Despite the vigorous efforts of the international \r\ncommunity, including through the Quartet and the \r\ncountries which sponsor the peace process, to push that \r\nprocess forward, which led to indirect then direct \r\nnegotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians, the \r\nintransigence of Israel and its building of settlements, \r\ndespite international appeals to the contrary, have \r\nprevented any progress being made to date. The Arab \r\ncountries have shown their desire for peace by creating \r\na propitious climate for peace negotiations. But this \r\nwill not continue indefinitely. \r\n Qatar sent a message, on behalf of the Arab \r\ncountries, in September 2009 to the American \r\nmediator, asking for guarantees from Israel so that the \r\nArabs could maintain that position. However, one year \r\nlater, the world sees the radical position taken by \r\nIsrael, which is retreating from its internationally \r\nagreed commitments and impeding the negotiations, as \r\nwe have seen lately. The Israeli Government continues \r\nits illegal settlement policy in the occupied Palestinian \r\nterritory and the Syrian Golan, in defiance of the call \r\nby the Ministerial Committee of the Arab Peace \r\nInitiative at their last meeting in Sirte, Libya. \r\n There is international consensus that the \r\nPalestinian question should be settled through a two-\r\nState solution, whereby the two States would coexist \r\npeacefully. However, the expansion by Israel of \r\nsettlements, especially around East Jerusalem, \r\nundermines the two-State solution based on the 1967 \r\nborders and threatens the contiguity of the Palestinian \r\nterritory as an essential element of the proposed State. \r\nThe so-called natural growth of Israeli settlements is \r\nnot acceptable; it is contrary to international law. The \r\ninternational community should not be deceived by the \r\nso-called temporary freeze on settlement activities; all \r\nsettlements on territories occupied since 1967 should \r\nbe dismantled, in accordance with the relevant United \r\nNations resolutions. A comprehensive, just and lasting \r\npeace in the Middle East can only be established \r\nthrough the implementation of the land-for-peace \r\nprinciple, the relevant United Nations resolutions and \r\nthe Arab Peace Initiative. \r\n The State of Qatar rejects the illegal practices \r\nbeing carried out by Israel in occupied East Jerusalem \r\nin its attempt to change the Arab identity of the city, its \r\nlegal status and religious character. We repeat that all \r\nsuch attempts are null and void. The international \r\ncommunity should express its rejection of the attempts \r\nby the Israeli Government to prejudice Muslim and \r\nChristian religious sites in order to Judaize the city. \r\nSuch attempts are in contravention of the commitments \r\nof Israel under international law and relevant United \r\nNations resolutions and undermine a potential peaceful \r\nsolution. \r\n Israel’s insistence on carrying out such illegal \r\nactivities against the Palestinians is incompatible with \r\nthe behaviour of the civilized world. Israel is thereby \r\ndistancing itself from being a constructive member of \r\nthe international community and severing its relations \r\nwith peace-loving nations in the Middle East. If the \r\nleaders of Israel have any true vision, they will see that \r\nending the occupation would serve the security, \r\n A/65/PV.54\r\n \r\n7 10-65877 \r\n \r\neconomic and social interests of all peoples, including \r\nthe Israelis. The non-implementation by Israel of \r\nUnited Nations resolutions undermines trust in the \r\ninternational community and in this Organization, \r\nwhile implementation would show its genuine will to \r\nreach a just and comprehensive settlement of the \r\nPalestinian question, the crux of the Middle East crisis. \r\nIt has become ever more important that the United \r\nNations help the Palestinian people determine their fate \r\nand live in an independent State, with Jerusalem as its \r\ncapital. \r\n Mr. Al-Abri (Oman) (spoke in Arabic): On \r\nbehalf of the delegation of Oman, I would like to \r\nexpress our appreciation and gratitude to you, Sir, for \r\nhaving organized this special meeting to consider the \r\nquestion of Palestine and the situation in the Middle \r\nEast. Through you, my delegation expresses its \r\ngratitude to Mr. Abdou Salam Diallo, the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Senegal, whom we congratulate upon \r\nhis election as Chair of the Committee on the Exercise \r\nof the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People; we \r\nalso thank him for having introduced the report of that \r\nCommittee (A/65/35). I would like, in that regard, to \r\ncommend the great efforts made by the members of \r\nthat Committee in favour of the Palestinian people and \r\ntheir just cause. I would also like to welcome the \r\ncomprehensive statement made by the Chair of that \r\nCommittee on the question of Palestine and the \r\nsituation in the Middle East. \r\n With your permission, Mr. President, I should \r\nlike to address both agenda items, the “Question of \r\nPalestine” and the “Situation in the Middle East”, at \r\nthe same time. There is no doubt that this meeting is of \r\nparticular importance, as we are gathered here today to \r\nseek a solution to the difficult question of occupied \r\nPalestine, which we have been addressing now for \r\nsome 60 years. In that time, the situation of the \r\nPalestinian people has continued to deteriorate as a \r\nresult of the systematic actions carried out by Israel, \r\nthe occupying Power. We cannot remain silent in the \r\nface of such a situation, in which violence, killings, \r\ndisplacements and destruction, including the \r\ndestruction of essential infrastructure, continue. In \r\nspite of all of that, the Palestinian people remain strong \r\nand steadfast and continue to seek the opportunity to \r\nenjoy their legitimate rights and establish an \r\nindependent Palestinian State, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif \r\nas its capital. \r\n We are very concerned by the catastrophic \r\nsituation in the occupied Palestinian territories and the \r\nblockade against the Gaza Strip. The inhuman, illegal \r\nand barbaric aggression and actions carried out by the \r\nIsraeli State continue in the form of actions such as the \r\nconfiscation of identity cards and the forced eviction of \r\nPalestinian people, with a view to Judaizing Al-Quds \r\nAl-Sharif and all other holy sites of Palestine. \r\n Yesterday was the thirty-third anniversary of the \r\nInternational Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian \r\nPeople, who call on the international community to be \r\nallowed to enjoy their fundamental and inalienable \r\nrights. It was also the sixty-third anniversary of the \r\nadoption by the United Nations of resolution 181 (II) \r\non the partitioning of the Palestinian territory. Today, \r\nthe Palestinian people continue to be denied their \r\nlegitimate rights — to national sovereignty, to self-\r\ndetermination and to establish an independent State on \r\ntheir land. This situation has produced more than \r\n4 million Palestinian refugees, who now live in \r\ndifficult conditions, exiled in diaspora. \r\n It has always been here, in this international \r\nforum, that the Palestinian people have sought \r\nprotection against arbitrary, inhuman and illegal Israeli \r\nactions. It is therefore incumbent upon the international \r\ncommunity to take a strong and serious position \r\nagainst those actions and abuses, including last year’s \r\nwar in the Gaza Strip and the attacks against the \r\nfreedom flotilla, which was carrying only humanitarian \r\nsupplies and sought only to lift the unjust blockade \r\nagainst the Gaza Strip, not to mention the other \r\nflagrant violations of human rights. Israel has thus \r\nshown the whole world that it is not in favour of peace. \r\n The international community must exert greater \r\npressure on Israel, insisting that it cease those actions \r\nand policies and that it engage seriously in negotiations \r\nbased on relevant terms of reference which includes the \r\nprinciple of land for peace, Security Council \r\nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), and the Arab \r\nPeace Initiative. \r\n The delegation of Oman welcomed the adoption \r\nby the General Assembly of resolution 64/10 on \r\n5 November 2009 on the follow-up to the report of the \r\nUnited Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza \r\nConflict and the adoption of the recommendations \r\ncontained in that report. Today, we insist once again on \r\nthe need to follow up on those recommendations and to \r\nensure that they are fully implemented by all main \r\nA/65/PV.54  \r\n \r\n10-65877 8 \r\n \r\norgans of the Organization, primarily the Security \r\nCouncil. \r\n As it has done in the past, my delegation \r\nunderscores the need to find a solution to the chronic \r\nconflict in the Middle East. And while the Sultanate of \r\nOman supports the peace process led by the United \r\nStates, we nonetheless fear that Israeli policy remains \r\nobscure and confused, and fails to meet its \r\nresponsibilities and the requirements of peace. \r\nEstablishing a sovereign, independent and viable \r\nPalestinian State, with East Jerusalem as its capital, \r\nmeans that Israel must withdraw from all occupied \r\nArab territories, including the Syrian Golan and parts \r\nof southern Lebanon, to the pre-June 1967 borders. \r\n The Government of the Sultanate of Oman \r\nwelcomes the active role of the friendly United States \r\nand the positive position taken in statements by \r\nPresident Barack Obama in favour of finding a solution \r\nto the Middle East conflict and the establishment of a \r\nsovereign Palestinian State, which would live side by \r\nside with the State of Israel and which would, within \r\none year, become an official Member of the United \r\nNations. That is why we insist here on the need to \r\nbuild on the momentum to seize this historic \r\nopportunity to create a true partnership for peace and \r\nsecurity with Arab countries. \r\n The Sultanate of Oman has always welcomed the \r\npeace process, seeing discussion, dialogue and \r\nnegotiation as the natural and civilized way to resolve \r\nthe conflict. We therefore urge all of the parties to \r\nadopt a positive and effective attitude in order to solve \r\nthe dangerous conflict in the Middle East. Thus we are \r\nasking for the Security Council to shoulder its \r\nresponsibilities, along with the international Quartet, to \r\nmake a greater effort to reach a just and comprehensive \r\nsolution to the Arab-Israeli conflict on all tracks, \r\naccording to relevant international resolutions, the \r\nprinciple of land for peace and the Arab Peace \r\nInitiative, in order to achieve the creation of an \r\nindependent Palestinian State on Palestinian land \r\noccupied since 1967, living peacefully side by side \r\nwith Israel within internationally recognized borders. \r\n Mr. Pham Vinh Quang (Viet Nam): First of all, I \r\nwould like to thank you, Mr. President, for convening \r\nthis important meeting. Allow me to convey the most \r\nheartfelt greetings of the Government and the people of \r\nViet Nam to the people of Palestine and the Palestinian \r\nNational Authority on the occasion of the International \r\nDay of Solidarity with the Palestinian People. \r\n Viet Nam aligns itself with the statement \r\ndelivered by Egypt at the 53rd meeting on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement. \r\n After more than 60 years, the question of \r\nPalestine remains unresolved. The Palestinian people \r\nhave continued to be displaced from their homeland \r\nand live in a dire situation due to the blockade imposed \r\nby Israel. The blockade has caused the deterioration of \r\nsocio-economic conditions, including widespread \r\npoverty, unemployment and declining health. It is truly \r\nheartrending to witness that grave deterioration, which \r\nrampantly infringes on the rights of Palestinian people \r\non the ground, including the right to self-determination \r\nand the right to freedom, and creates a cross-border \r\ninflux of refugees. \r\n Despite increased international efforts, the peace \r\ntalks between Israel and Palestine are at an impasse \r\nand face more difficulties, due to Israel’s refusal to \r\nextend a 10-month settlement moratorium on settler \r\nhomes in occupied East Jerusalem, which goes against \r\ninternational law and the Quartet’s efforts. \r\n For decades, the Middle East has seen many wars \r\nand much bloodshed instead of peace, security and \r\nprosperous development. Continued violence will only \r\nmake the peoples — Palestinian and Israeli alike — \r\nshed more blood. It is time to stop it. There is no \r\nalternative to a comprehensive, just and lasting peace \r\nsettlement and the exercise of the right to self-\r\ndetermination by the Palestinian people, resulting in \r\nthe creation of an independent and viable State of \r\nPalestine, living side by side with the State of Israel in \r\npeace and security, on the basis of the relevant United \r\nNations resolutions and the principle of land for peace. \r\nBoth parties should exercise maximum restraint and \r\ntake concrete steps towards that end. \r\n We strongly urge Israel to cease all military \r\nactivities and abide by international law, including \r\ninternational humanitarian and human rights law. It \r\nmust promptly remove restrictions on the movement of \r\npersons, humanitarian aid and commercial goods and \r\nthe business activities of Palestinians. We urge Israel to \r\ncreate every safe condition for the return of refugees, \r\nto renew the moratorium on the construction of \r\nsettlements, and to release Palestinian prisoners. \r\n A/65/PV.54\r\n \r\n9 10-65877 \r\n \r\n It is also incumbent upon the Palestinian \r\nAuthority, for its part, to take effective actions to bring \r\nan end to violence, including the firing of rockets into \r\nIsrael’s territory. We call upon Palestinian factions to \r\npromote national reconciliation and rally behind the \r\nPalestinian National Authority for a national unity \r\nGovernment with a view to realizing the legitimate \r\nPalestinian national aspirations. \r\n Viet Nam has been closely following the \r\ndevelopment of the peace process in the Middle East. \r\nWe strongly believe that the continued support and \r\nrenewed efforts by the Quartet, the League of Arab \r\nStates, regional countries and the United Nations are \r\ncrucial for moving forward the Israeli–Palestinian \r\nnegotiations on all core issues. We call for intensified \r\nefforts by the international community, in particular the \r\nSecurity Council and the Quartet, to address the current \r\npolitical and humanitarian crisis. \r\n During that process, the international community \r\nmust abide by the principles of objectivity, neutrality \r\nand impartiality, giving equal attention and \r\nconsideration to the legitimate concerns and demands \r\nof both sides, based on internationally recognized \r\nguidelines such as the Road Map, the Annapolis \r\nprocess outcome, the principle of land for peace, the \r\nArab Peace Initiative and relevant Security Council \r\nresolutions, including recent resolutions 1850 (2008) \r\nand 1860 (2009). In that connection, we support the \r\nholding of an international conference in Moscow to \r\nexpedite a resumption of the peace process. \r\n We also commend the role and tremendous work \r\nof United Nations agencies, especially the United \r\nNations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine \r\nRefugees in the Near East (UNRWA), in delivering \r\nhumanitarian programmes and emergency assistance to \r\nthe Palestinian people. We wish to emphasize the need \r\nto ensure safe conditions and unhindered humanitarian \r\noperations for staff members of United Nations \r\nagencies and UNRWA. \r\n We call upon all donors to continue to make the \r\nmost generous efforts possible to meet the Agency’s \r\nanticipated needs. We applaud the role of non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, civil society and peace \r\ngroups in the struggle to defend Palestinian national \r\nand human rights, and we encourage them to continue \r\ntheir positive work. \r\n To conclude, I wish to reaffirm the consistent \r\nsupport of the Government and the people of Viet Nam \r\nfor a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the \r\nMiddle East and for the right of the Palestinian people \r\nto exercise self-determination and sovereignty in their \r\nindependent State of Palestine. We are firmly \r\nconvinced that the just cause of the Palestinian people \r\nwill eventually succeed. \r\n Mr. Almansoor (Bahrain) (spoke in Arabic): On \r\nthe occasion of the International Day of Solidarity with \r\nthe Palestinian People, my delegation expresses its \r\nsolidarity with the steadfast people of Palestine in their \r\ntireless pursuit and strong resolve to realize their \r\nnational aspirations and to defend their inalienable \r\nrights. \r\n My delegation associates itself with the statement \r\nmade yesterday by the representative of Egypt on \r\nbehalf of Non-Aligned Movement. \r\n My delegation thanks the Chairman and members \r\nof the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable \r\nRights of the Palestinian People for their invaluable \r\nreport (A/65/35), which reveals what has been \r\nhappening in the occupied Palestinian territories since \r\n1967 and shows the efforts still being made to put an \r\nend to the Israeli occupation and to establish an \r\nindependent and sovereign Palestinian State with its \r\ncapital in East Jerusalem. \r\n We also appreciate the Committee’s monitoring \r\nof the situation and the political developments, and the \r\nimplementation of the Committee’s programme of \r\ninternational meetings and conferences. That includes \r\nthe international meeting of the Committee on 12 and \r\n13 February 2010, which engaged parliamentarians of \r\nthe Mediterranean region and beyond in support of the \r\ntwo-State solution, the United Nations Seminar on \r\nAssistance to the Palestinian People, held in Vienna on \r\n24 and 25 March, and the United Nations African \r\nMeeting on the Question of Palestine, held in Rabat on \r\n1 and 2 July, as well as other meetings and seminars. \r\n My delegation also thanks the Department of \r\nPublic Information for its implementation of the \r\nspecial information programme of the question of \r\nPalestine to raise the awareness of the international \r\ncommunity on the question of Palestine, pursuant to \r\nresolution 64/18. \r\n When we carefully consider the report of the \r\nCommittee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of \r\nthe Palestinian People, our concern over the \r\ndeteriorating situation in the occupied Palestinian \r\nA/65/PV.54  \r\n \r\n10-65877 10 \r\n \r\nterritory increases because, as described by the \r\nCommittee in its report, conditions on the ground are \r\nstill dire as a result of the Israeli forces’ daily military \r\nraids and arrests all over the West Bank. \r\n The Committee describes the situation in Gaza as \r\neven more bleak. More than 1.5 million people are still \r\nsuffering from the Israeli attacks of December 2008 to \r\nJanuary 2009. They still suffer a severe lack of basic \r\nservices and commodities, such as clean water, because \r\nof the economic effects of the blockade. The report \r\nincludes many serious details, but in fact they are \r\nmerely examples indicative of wider practices that are \r\ncovered in the report of the United Nations Fact-\r\nFinding Mission on the Gaza Conflict (A/HRC/12/48), \r\nendorsed by the General Assembly in its resolution \r\n64/10 of 5 November 2009. \r\n The establishment of settlements in the occupied \r\nPalestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, is \r\ninternationally condemned as a violation of \r\ninternational law, according to the sixth paragraph of \r\narticle 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, paragraph \r\n120 of the Advisory Opinion of the International Court \r\nof Justice on the construction of a wall in the occupied \r\nPalestinian territory, and other General Assembly \r\nresolutions on the subject. Nevertheless, Israel \r\ncontinues its illegal settlement activities in the West \r\nBank, including East Jerusalem, as confirmed by the \r\nreport of the Committee on the Exercise of the \r\nInalienable Rights of the Palestinian People. \r\n The primary purpose of Israel’s actions is to \r\ncreate a new reality on the ground in an attempt to \r\nobliterate Arab and Islamic sites in Jerusalem and to \r\naffect the legal status of the city. Those measures are \r\nillegal, according to international law, including \r\nSecurity Council resolutions 446 (1979), 476 (1980) \r\nand 478 (1980), in which the Council reiterates its \r\ninsistence that all administrative and legislative \r\nmeasures are null and void, that they represent an \r\nattempt to change the character and status of \r\nJerusalem, and that they should be cancelled. \r\n In that regard, the report of the United Nations \r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights on the \r\nimplementation of its resolution S-9/1 (A/HRC/12/37) \r\nstates that the settlement activity in the West Bank \r\namounts to violation of numerous humanitarian law \r\nprovisions, including article 55 of The Hague \r\nRegulations and article 49 of the Fourth Geneva \r\nConvention, whereby the occupying Power should not \r\ntransfer its own population to the territories it occupies. \r\n The report of the Committee on the Exercise of \r\nthe Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People \r\nmentions that during the reporting period violence by \r\nIsraeli settlers against Palestinians included physical \r\nassaults, harassment, intimidation, setting fire to \r\nagricultural land, uprooting or destroying olive trees \r\nand grapevines, throwing stones at vehicles and \r\nhouses, vandalizing mosques, killing livestock, \r\nshooting at civilians in open areas and, as mentioned in \r\nparagraph 37, blocking access to schools. \r\n The Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable \r\nRights of the Palestinian People expressed its concern \r\nover the settlement activity in occupied East Jerusalem \r\nand at actions intended to displace residents from the \r\ncity through the demolition of houses and the \r\ncancellation of residency permits. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral also expressed his concern about the \r\ndemolition of houses and the construction of \r\nsettlements (see A/65/380), and according to his \r\ncomments, the situation in East Jerusalem remains \r\ntense, adversely affecting the peace process. The \r\nsettlement activities and the construction of the \r\nseparation wall contravene the advisory opinion of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, the Road Map and the \r\ntwo-State solution. \r\n In his report in document A/65/331, the Special \r\nRapporteur on the situation of human rights in the \r\nPalestinian territories occupied since 1967 states that \r\nthe right to self-determination is the central right \r\nunderpinning all other human rights. He refers to the \r\noppressiveness of Israel’s occupation over more than \r\n43 years, as evident in the range of Israeli violations of \r\nthe Fourth Geneva Convention and of applicable \r\ninternational human rights law, as well as its defiance \r\nof the International Court of Justice and of numerous \r\nresolutions and decisions of the General Assembly and \r\nthe Security Council. \r\n Reaching a just and peaceful settlement of the \r\nMiddle East question is necessary to end the suffering \r\nof the Palestinian people and to establish peace and \r\nstability in the region. Peace will not be achieved \r\nthrough aggression, State terrorism and the building of \r\nnew illegal settlements. A lasting and comprehensive \r\npeace in Palestine will be established only by \r\nupholding justice and ending discrimination and the \r\n A/65/PV.54\r\n \r\n11 10-65877 \r\n \r\noccupation of Palestine and the other occupied Arab \r\nterritories. \r\n Mr. Jomaa (Tunisia) (spoke in Arabic): Since \r\n1978, in implementation of General Assembly \r\nresolution 32/40 B of 1977, we have celebrated the \r\nInternational Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian \r\nPeople, which is very symbolic and demonstrates broad \r\ninternational support for a people suffering under \r\noccupation and unable to enjoy its simple fundamental \r\nrights. The Day is also an opportunity for the \r\ninternational community to be mindful of its \r\nresponsibility and resolve with regard to the ongoing \r\nsuffering of the Palestinian people that is caused by the \r\nactions and practices of the occupier, Israel, in defiance \r\nof international resolutions, decisions, agreements and \r\nthe terms of reference of the peace process in the \r\nMiddle East. \r\n Today, we meet to consider the question of \r\nPalestine at a time when we thought that the peace \r\nprocess might create new momentum in the region and \r\npave the way for measures that would generate some \r\npositive developments for millions of Palestinians and \r\nwould ensure a final resolution of the Palestinian-\r\nIsraeli conflict. \r\n Since September the peace process, led by the \r\nUnited States, has been welcomed and supported by the \r\ninternational community. There has been agreement in \r\nprinciple on a timetable for direct negotiations to lay \r\nthe foundations for discussing the core issues for a \r\nfinal settlement. Thus we cherished the hope of seeing \r\na beginning to the end of the conflict. \r\n Unfortunately, however, Israel, by refusing to \r\nextend the moratorium on settlements and by going \r\neven further in approving the construction of more \r\nhousing units, has created further tension and \r\nundermined the basis for trust, thus destroying the hope \r\nof establishing peace in the region. That situation \r\nrequires a resolute and immediate reaction by all \r\nparties. \r\n Negotiations towards any kind of peace require \r\nprimarily the goodwill of the parties and their \r\ncompliance with their obligations. International bodies \r\nagree that Israeli activities in the Palestinian territories \r\nthreaten the resumption of the peace process and \r\nviolate the basic principles of international law, \r\ninternational humanitarian law and the major \r\ninstruments and terms of reference regarding the peace \r\nprocess, in particular the Arab Peace Initiative. \r\n We are deeply concerned about Israel’s persistent \r\nviolations and its ongoing excesses with regard to \r\nhuman rights and international humanitarian law. We \r\nall hope that there will be improvement on the ground \r\nto alleviate Palestinian suffering and build enough trust \r\nfor the negotiations process to resume. Despite the \r\ncontinuous calls of the Quartet and the appeals of the \r\ninternational community, Israel continues its \r\nsettlements and the expulsion of Palestinians. It has \r\ntaken measures, including the destruction of their \r\nhomes and restrictions on the freedom of movement of \r\npersons and goods, that have served to millions of \r\npeople of basic commodities and necessities of life and \r\nof humanitarian assistance, not to mention its \r\nJudaization of Al-Quds Al-Sharif and changing its \r\ndemographic character. \r\n Therefore, we would like to underscore the need \r\nto put an end to those Israeli actions against, and \r\ncollective punishment of, the fraternal Palestinian \r\npeople. If the international community wants to truly \r\nand seriously reach a solution that puts an end to the \r\nconflict and establishes peace, security and stability in \r\nthe region, immediate measures must be taken. \r\n Once again, from this rostrum, we reaffirm our \r\nprincipled position, which is to support the Palestinian \r\npeople in their noble cause to regain their legitimate \r\nrights and to establish their independent State on their \r\nland. Once again, we emphasize that for Tunisia, the \r\nquestion of Palestine is in particular a priority political \r\nissue. We have always approached the issue with great \r\ncare and respect because the right to dignity and a \r\nhomeland is a question of natural law, as the President \r\nof Tunisia has underscored for many years. \r\n Tunisia has always contributed to respect for and \r\ncompliance with the decisions and resolutions and \r\nnoble principles of the international community and to \r\ninternational legitimacy. Once again, we call on the \r\nvarious influential parties, in particular the Quartet, to \r\nput more pressure on Israel to change its policy and \r\nstop the settlements and the Judaization of Al-Quds, in \r\nrespect for the relevant international instruments for \r\nthe peace process. We call on the international \r\ncommunity to take effective and prompt steps to find a \r\njust, comprehensive and lasting solution on the basis of \r\ninternational instruments and resolutions, the terms of \r\nreference for peace and the Arab Peace Initiative. \r\n The situation in the occupied Palestinian \r\nterritories is critical and cannot continue as it is. The \r\nA/65/PV.54  \r\n \r\n10-65877 12 \r\n \r\noccupying Power cannot persist in constantly flouting \r\nthe international will that demands peace for the \r\nMiddle East. Steps must be taken promptly to improve \r\nthe daily life of millions of Palestinians so that they \r\ncan enjoy the most basic rights under international law. \r\nAlso, we must all work together to give the peace \r\nprocess new impetus and continue the momentum for \r\npeace. We must stop making hollow promises and \r\nraising false hopes. We should take specific steps on \r\nthe ground, in particular putting a complete end to \r\nsettlement activities, lifting the blockade on Gaza and \r\nprotecting Al-Quds Al-Sharif until a true climate of \r\ntrust for serious negotiations can be established and a \r\njust, lasting and comprehensive solution for the \r\nconflict can materialize. The situation requires a \r\nresolute common position and firm efforts in order to \r\nstop what has been happening. \r\n Tunisia underscores the need to support dialogue \r\nand negotiations. At the same time, we must not return \r\nto tension and stalemate, so that the peace, stability and \r\nsecurity in the region that we all seek can be achieved. \r\n In conclusion, I once again call on Israel to put an \r\nend to its occupation of the Syrian Golan and the \r\nremaining Lebanese territories, in accordance with \r\ninternational law. We also underscore that Tunisia will \r\ncontinue its efforts to bring to a successful conclusion \r\nall peace efforts and initiatives in order to once and for \r\nall resolve all aspects of the Arab-Israeli conflict and to \r\nestablish lasting peace, stability and security in the \r\nregion. \r\n Mr. Ismail (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): My \r\ndelegation would like to express its gratitude and \r\nappreciation to the Committee on the Exercise of the \r\nInalienable Rights of the Palestinian People and its \r\noutgoing Chairman, Mr. Paul Badji. My delegation \r\ncommends the Committee’s report (A/65/35) and calls \r\nfor its implementation. I would also like to commend \r\nthe report of the Special Committee to Investigate \r\nIsraeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the \r\nPalestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied \r\nTerritories (see A/65/327) and the recommendations set \r\nout therein. In that connection, my delegation would \r\nlike to pay tribute to the Member States that make up \r\nthat tripartite Committee — Sri Lanka, Malaysia and \r\nSenegal — and we request that Israel cooperate \r\nimmediately with that Committee. \r\n Despite all international and regional efforts, \r\nIsrael, the occupying Power, continues to violate the \r\nrights of the Palestinian people, including their right to \r\nself-determination and to establish a sovereign State \r\nwithin the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its \r\ncapital, in accordance with international law and the \r\nUnited Nations resolutions that Israel constantly flouts \r\nand disregards. \r\n Moreover, Israel pursues its illegal and inhumane \r\npractices, which violate Palestinian human rights and \r\ninternational law. That has been emphasized in a \r\nnumber of international reports, including, most \r\nrecently, the report of Richard Falk, Special Rapporteur \r\non the situation of human rights in the Palestinian \r\nterritories occupied since 1967 (see A/65/331); the \r\nreport of the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on \r\nthe Gaza Conflict (A/HRC/12/48); the reports of the \r\nHuman Rights Council (A/65/53 and Corr.1 and \r\nA/65/53/Add.1), recently considered by the General \r\nAssembly (see A/65/PV.42 and A/65/PV.43); the report \r\nof the Human Rights Council on its twelfth special \r\nsession (A/64/53/Add.1) in connection with which the \r\nGeneral Assembly adopted resolution 64/10; the report \r\nof the Secretary-General on the peaceful settlement of \r\nthe question of Palestine (A/65/380 and Add.1); and, \r\nlastly, the report of the Committee on the Exercise of \r\nthe Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, which \r\nthe Assembly is now considering. \r\n In addition to those reports, the United Nations \r\nhas adopted a number of resolutions calling on Israel to \r\nwithdraw from the occupied Arab territories, including \r\nthe Syrian Golan Heights. In that regard, we note that \r\nthe Israeli legislation requiring a referendum before \r\ntroops can be withdrawn from the Syrian Golan \r\nHeights and Jerusalem runs counter to Security \r\nCouncil resolutions 497 (1981) and 476 (1980). We \r\ncall on Israel to fully withdraw from the Syrian Golan, \r\nto the 1967 lines. We also call on Israel to withdraw \r\nfrom the occupied Lebanese territories: the Shaba’a \r\nfarms, the Kfar Shuba Hills and Al-Ghajar village. \r\n My delegation once again condemns the practices \r\nof the Israeli occupying Power that defy the \r\ninternational will and threaten international and \r\nregional peace and security. We call on the people and \r\nGovernments of the world to support the Palestinian \r\npeople in their fight against the Israeli occupying \r\nPower and the blockade imposed on the Gaza Strip, \r\nwhich prevents the flow of international humanitarian \r\naid to that area and destroys its economy and social \r\nfabric. Israel’s blockade on Gaza is one of the worst \r\nforms of collective punishment. We call for an \r\n A/65/PV.54\r\n \r\n13 10-65877 \r\n \r\nimmediate end to the blockade and for opening the \r\ncrossing points so that people are allowed access to aid \r\nand food supplies and medication for the women, \r\nchildren and the elderly who are ill. \r\n The report of the Commissioner-General of the \r\nUnited Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine \r\nRefugees in the Near East (UNRWA) (A/65/13) \r\nreviewed the effects of the blockade imposed on the \r\nPalestinian people, which has prevented humanitarian \r\naid and all major projects assisting the Palestinians and \r\nhas paralysed life in Gaza. Israel also attacked the \r\nfreedom flotilla, and UNRWA facilities and staff were \r\nnot spared in those attacks. The situation in the \r\noccupied Palestinian territories is simply intolerable. \r\n Talk of settling the conflict in the Middle East \r\npeacefully will remain a dream until Israel is willing to \r\nstop its practices and violations of human rights and \r\nrespect the international will in that regard, abide by \r\nlaws and stop its attacks on the innocent people of \r\nPalestine, which we see on television throughout the \r\nworld. As long as Israel is allowed to continue the \r\nblockade, the suffering will continue. \r\n We firmly support the Palestinian position, and \r\nwe call for an end of all settlement activity and the \r\nresumption of dialogue on the basis of the relevant \r\nSecurity Council resolutions, the Madrid terms of \r\nreference and the Arab Peace Initiative. We also call on \r\nIsrael to stop the destruction of civilian homes in the \r\nPalestinian territories and to end its illegal settlement \r\nactivities. \r\n To conclude, we must say that in this the \r\ncredibility of the United Nations is at stake, and we are \r\nat a crossroads. It is time to assume our historic \r\nresponsibility and put an end to Israel’s occupation of \r\nthe Palestinian territories that it has occupied since \r\n1967 and to see the Palestinian people establish their \r\nown independent, sovereign State on their land. \r\n Mr. Kohona (Sri Lanka): I would like to thank \r\nyou, Mr. President, for giving me this opportunity to \r\naddress the Assembly this morning. \r\n My delegation associates itself with the position \r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement, as articulated by the \r\nPermanent Representative of Egypt at the \r\n53rd meeting. \r\n Each year, 29 November engenders mixed \r\nfeelings in us. On the one hand, it gives us hope that \r\nwe will be able to see the State of Palestine become a \r\nreality, as envisaged in the historic resolution 181 (II) \r\nof 29 November 1947. On the other, many of us are \r\ndisappointed that the inalienable rights of the \r\nPalestinian people, including their right to self-\r\ndetermination, national independence and statehood, \r\nstill remain unaccomplished despite many efforts of the \r\ninternational community. \r\n Sri Lanka’s position with regard to the \r\ninalienable rights of the Palestinian people remains \r\nconsistent. We reaffirm our unequivocal support for the \r\ntwo-State solution. \r\n Permit me to convey the message of my \r\nPresident, His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa, on the \r\noccasion of the International Day of Solidarity with the \r\nPalestinian People. \r\n  “On this important occasion to \r\ncommemorate the International Day of Solidarity \r\nwith the Palestinian People, I wish to renew, on \r\nbehalf of my Government and the people of Sri \r\nLanka, our sincere and unwavering support for \r\nthe just struggle of the Palestinian people to \r\nachieve their inalienable rights, including their \r\nright to statehood. \r\n  “I have personally associated myself with \r\nthe Palestinian cause for over 30 years, and it is \r\nmy conviction that the Palestinians have been \r\ndenied their basic rights for far too long. It is in \r\nthe mutual benefit of both Israel and Palestine \r\nthat the proximity talks should recommence \r\nwithout further delay. We therefore take this \r\nopportunity to earnestly request the utmost \r\nrestraint and the cessation of all provocations so \r\nas to ensure the re-establishment of trust and \r\nconfidence among all parties. It is hoped that the \r\nparties will continue to demonstrate leadership \r\nand political courage and keep the door to peace \r\nopen. The dream of the people of the region and \r\nall people of the world is peace. \r\n  “It is peace in Palestine that can pave the \r\nway for a stable and peaceful Middle Eastern \r\nregion. It is by securing the inalienable rights of \r\nthe Palestinian people, including the \r\nestablishment of an independent, self-sustaining \r\nState of Palestine consistent with a negotiated \r\ncomprehensive solution, that peace and security \r\nin the region can be ensured. \r\nA/65/PV.54  \r\n \r\n10-65877 14 \r\n \r\n  “It is the continuing hope of Sri Lanka that \r\nthis day will arrive soon.” \r\n Sri Lanka remains deeply concerned and \r\ndisturbed at the disappointing conditions in Gaza and \r\nthe occupied territories, including East Jerusalem. We \r\nearnestly hope that both the Israeli and the Palestinian \r\nleaders will take bold measures to reinvigorate the \r\nstalled peace proximity talks. We regret the termination \r\nof the moratorium on settlement construction. Over the \r\nyears, both sides have suffered the loss of valuable \r\nhuman lives and material resources, but the Palestinian \r\nlosses and suffering have been particularly harrowing. \r\n In Sri Lanka, we are fully cognizant of the fact \r\nthat senseless violence can only destabilize societies \r\nand unleash hatred and hostilities. Regulations and \r\npolicies that restrict the freedom of movement of the \r\nPalestinians in the occupied territories, illegal \r\nintrusions into Palestinian lands, the destruction of \r\ntheir private property and agricultural lands, and \r\nrestrictions on access to fishing and other livelihood \r\nactivities can only create more tension and bitterness \r\nand push back the possibility of realizing a durable \r\npeace. \r\n We therefore urge both parties to exercise the \r\nutmost restraint in order to create an environment \r\nconducive to building mutual trust and understanding. \r\nFor that to happen, we strongly believe that Israel must \r\nend the occupation and immediately withdraw to the \r\n1967 borders, freeze all illegal settlement activities, \r\nand cease the construction of the separation wall. There \r\nshould also be guarantees to Israel that its legitimate \r\nsecurity concerns are not at stake. \r\n I take this opportunity to commend the work that \r\nhas been carried out by the United Nations Relief and \r\nWorks Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East \r\nto assist millions of Palestinian people in need during \r\nall these years amid multiple difficulties. We \r\nemphasize the need to further ease the restrictions on \r\nthe flow of goods to Gaza in order to expedite the \r\nreturn to normalcy. We appreciate the ongoing efforts \r\nof international donors, regional organizations and \r\nUnited Nations agencies to alleviate the suffering of \r\ninnocent civilians and to provide protection for them. \r\n It is Sri Lanka’s firm hope that all Palestinian \r\npeople will rally behind the Palestinian Authority to \r\nbuild and enhance the democratic institutions of \r\nPalestine, which is a necessary precondition for a \r\nstrong, viable and independent future State of \r\nPalestine. It is also our hope that Israel will flourish, \r\nuphold democratic values, and gain the increased \r\nrecognition and friendship of its neighbours. \r\n Let me quote Mahatma Gandhi when he said: \r\n“The future depends on what we do in the present”. \r\n Mr. Puri (India): Thank you, Mr. President, for \r\nconvening this discussion on the question of Palestine \r\nat the General Assembly. Yesterday, we marked the \r\nInternational Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian \r\nPeople, a day that allows all of us to underline our \r\nsupport for the people of Palestine in their quest for \r\npeace and justice. \r\n The support for the Palestinian cause has been \r\ncentral to India’s foreign policy, even before we \r\nachieved independence in 1947. Starting with our vote \r\nagainst the partition of Palestine and through India’s \r\nrecognition of the Palestine Liberation Organization in \r\n1974 as the sole and legitimate representative of the \r\nPalestinian people and our recognition of the State of \r\nPalestine in 1988, India has consistently stood by the \r\nPalestinian people. \r\n I draw the Assembly’s attention to the message of \r\nour Prime Minister, Mr. Manmohan Singh, dated 15 \r\nNovember 2010, on the occasion of the International \r\nDay of Solidarity with the Palestinian People. He \r\nreiterated India’s unwavering support for the \r\nPalestinian people’s struggle for a sovereign, \r\nindependent, viable and united State of Palestine, with \r\nEast Jerusalem as its capital, living within secure and \r\nrecognized borders, side by side and at peace with \r\nIsrael, as endorsed in the Arab Peace Initiative, the \r\nQuartet Road Map and the relevant Security Council \r\nresolutions. \r\n India’s solidarity with Palestine’s struggle for the \r\nrealization of its fundamental rights is a matter of faith \r\nfor us and enjoys national consensus in India. India has \r\nalways supported and will continue to support the \r\nPalestinian people in their pursuit of the legitimate \r\ngoals and quest for development, based on dignity and \r\nself-reliance. \r\n Towards that objective, India extended further \r\nbudgetary support of $10 million to the Palestine \r\nNational Authority earlier this year, in addition to a \r\nsimilar contribution last year, to assist in their work of \r\nreconstruction and development. India has also \r\ncontinued to support the United Nations Relief and \r\n A/65/PV.54\r\n \r\n15 10-65877 \r\n \r\nWorks Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East \r\nthrough its annual contribution of $1 million. \r\n India welcomes the direct talks between Israel \r\nand Palestine, and reiterates its full support for efforts \r\nto achieve a durable, comprehensive and just \r\nsettlement. We sincerely hope that the talks and \r\nnegotiations will lead to a comprehensive peace \r\nprocess for the final resolution of the Middle East \r\nconflict. \r\n We remain convinced that lasting peace in the \r\nregion will contribute to global stability and prosperity. \r\n Mr. Escalona Ojeda (Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela) (spoke in Spanish): My delegation aligns \r\nitself with the statement made by Ambassador Maged \r\nAbdelaziz, Permanent Representative of the Arab \r\nRepublic of Egypt, on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement. \r\n On many occasions, the Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela has firmly stated that the search for a just \r\nsolution to the question of Palestine, without further \r\ndelay, is vital to creating a climate of peace in the \r\nMiddle East region. That solution will be truly credible \r\nupon the establishment of an independent, viable and \r\nterritorially contiguous Palestinian State, with East \r\nJerusalem as its capital. \r\n However, we cannot hope to achieve a real, just \r\nand balanced peace if the occupying Power, the State \r\nof Israel, does not make sincere efforts to that end. On \r\nthe contrary, the entire international community has \r\nwitnessed the systematic action of the Israeli \r\nGovernment to disregard in practice the Oslo Accords \r\nand all the initiatives that have emerged. Each time that \r\nthose initiatives open up prospects for peace, direct \r\ntalks between the authorities of that country and those \r\nof Palestine end up being interrupted. \r\n The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela vigorously \r\nappeals to the relevant organs of the United Nations to \r\ncompel the State of Israel to fully comply with United \r\nNations resolutions, in particular Security Council \r\nresolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973), 1397 (2002) and \r\n1515 (2003). The actions of multilateral bodies has \r\nbeen limited to words and more words, while the most \r\nbasic rights of the Palestinian people are being \r\nviolated. It is time for resolute action. \r\n History itself relates the rise and fall of so many \r\nsavage forms of domination, whose foundations, rooted \r\nin immorality and barbarity, have collapsed. Thus, it is \r\nnot surprising that the Israeli acts of aggression against \r\nthe Palestinian people, such as the criminal blockade \r\nagainst the Gaza Strip, Operation Cast Lead and the \r\nattack on the humanitarian freedom flotilla, are the \r\nclear expression of the current imperialist hegemony. \r\nAlthough those actions have been condemned by this \r\nOrganization, my country is deeply concerned about \r\nthe impunity of the Government of Israel in carrying \r\nout similar violations of human dignity and the \r\npassivity of the international community towards such \r\nserious issues. \r\n At such a crucial time for defining new standards \r\nin all areas of life and human thought, it is our \r\nresponsibility, as Member States of this Organization, \r\nto contribute decisively to a better and fairer world. \r\nThat is incompatible with the ongoing violations of \r\ninternational humanitarian law and the human rights of \r\nmen, women and children committed by the State of \r\nIsrael. \r\n Not all the agreements and resolutions adopted on \r\nthat subject have been just and fair. For example, under \r\nthe Oslo Accords, signed in 1993, Israel strengthened \r\nits control over 78 per cent of the territory originally \r\noccupied by the Palestinians. That situation is very \r\ndifferent from the one that prevailed in 1948, when the \r\nState of Israel was established on territory equivalent \r\nto 22 per cent of that area. A just and fair solution for \r\nPalestine must take account of its territorial structure \r\nof 1967. \r\n Allow me to underscore the fact that my country \r\nbecame a full member of the Committee on the \r\nExercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian \r\nPeople by decision of the General Assembly at the \r\n115th meeting of the sixty-fourth session on \r\n7 September of this year. That action testifies to a more \r\nactive commitment to the cause of that brave people, \r\nwhose resilience and courage serve as an example to \r\nall peoples of the world and a source of inspiration for \r\nthe exercise of the right to self-determination. \r\n To conclude, allow me to quote our President, \r\nHugo Chávez Frías, on the observance of the \r\nInternational Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian \r\nPeople yesterday: \r\n  “Here, once again, is the proof of our \r\nvibrant and active solidarity with the Palestinian \r\ncause and with a great people who wish to have a \r\nhomeland.” \r\nA/65/PV.54  \r\n \r\n10-65877 16 \r\n \r\n Mr. Benmehidi (Algeria): My delegation aligns \r\nitself with the statement made by the representative of \r\nEgypt on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement. \r\n The ongoing developments in the occupied \r\nPalestinian territory point to the continued violation of \r\nthe rights of the Palestinian people and the worsening \r\nof the situation as a result, inter alia, of Israel’s \r\nacceleration of its illegal settlement activities, \r\naccompanied by the escalating violence of settlers, \r\nhome demolitions, forced evictions and the ongoing \r\nconstruction of the separation wall, despite the \r\nadvisory opinion of the International Court of Justice. \r\n Despite recent efforts to revitalize the peace \r\nprocess, Israel continues to carry out its illegal actions \r\nin the occupied Palestinian territory, including East \r\nJerusalem, altering the physical, legal and institutional \r\nstructure of the occupied territory. Those measures are \r\nintended to achieve the annexation of the Palestinian \r\nterritory by bringing about long-term demographic \r\nchanges, removing traces of Palestinian heritage and \r\nstrengthening the Israeli presence in the West Bank and \r\nEast Jerusalem. \r\n Moreover, the situation in Gaza remains \r\ndisturbing from the perspective of human rights and \r\ninternational law. The Palestinians have continued to \r\nbe collectively punished through the isolation of the \r\n1.5 million residents of Gaza for several years now; \r\nthey are denied the right to study at West Bank \r\nuniversities and to maintain normal social contact with \r\nfamily members. Exports from the Strip have been \r\nprohibited, as has the flow of goods and people, even \r\nin life-and-death situations. In that regard, my \r\ndelegation underlines the necessity for an immediate \r\nlifting by Israel of its illegal blockade and the opening \r\nof all crossing points to Gaza, in accordance with \r\nSecurity Council resolution 1860 (2009), General \r\nAssembly resolution ES-10/18 and other relevant \r\nUnited Nations resolutions. \r\n Similarly, the imprisonment of about 10,000 \r\nPalestinians in Israeli jails, where ill-treatment and \r\ntorture are widely used, is a matter of serious concern \r\nfor my country. The international community cannot \r\ncontinue to ignore that scandalous affront to \r\ninternational humanitarian law and must adopt a clear \r\nand urgent stand for the immediate release of that \r\nillegally detained group of people, which includes \r\nchildren and women. \r\n The Israelis’ unlawful actions on the ground \r\nprovide the starkest evidence of the contrast between \r\nits actions and its professed participation in the peace \r\nprocess. That clearly demonstrates that Israel is not on \r\nthe path to peace and that the only goal pursued by the \r\nIsraeli policy seems to be undermining any future \r\nprospects for a peaceful settlement. \r\n Despite the call of all United Nations resolutions \r\nfor the withdrawal of Israel from the occupied \r\nterritories, the occupying Power continues its policy of \r\nexpansionism with impunity, while showing disdain for \r\nthe international community. We call on the \r\ninternational community, in particular the Security \r\nCouncil, to halt the brutal practices of the Israeli \r\nGovernment through the implementation of its \r\nresolutions and the adoption of measures to protect the \r\nPalestinian population and to ensure that such \r\npractices, which further worsen the living conditions of \r\nthe Palestinian people, are not repeated. \r\n It is the responsibility of the Security Council to \r\nexercise its prerogative to put an end to that culture of \r\nimpunity by taking the action needed to ensure respect \r\nfor and compliance with the ruling of the International \r\nCourt of Justice, the Fourth Geneva Convention and \r\nthe relevant United Nations resolutions. \r\n A complete cessation of all settlement activities \r\nand human rights violations is clearly a prerequisite for \r\ncreating a more stable environment conducive to a \r\ngenuine peace process, so as to achieve the goal of the \r\ntwo-State solution. Negotiations remain imperative for \r\nachieving a mutually agreed solution based on two \r\nStates, in accordance with Security Council resolutions \r\n242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and the principles contained \r\nin the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative. \r\n Algeria reiterates that any negotiated outcome \r\nbetween the parties must result in the emergence of an \r\nindependent, democratic and viable Palestinian State, \r\nwith Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital, in accordance \r\nwith international law and the relevant United Nations \r\nresolutions. \r\n Mr. Mohamed (Maldives): Yesterday, this \r\nAssembly marked the International Day of Solidarity \r\nwith the Palestinian People. Today, the Government \r\nand the people of the Maldives wish to reiterate our \r\nsteadfast solidarity with our Palestinian brothers and \r\nsisters in their efforts to realize their right to self-\r\ndetermination. \r\n A/65/PV.54\r\n \r\n17 10-65877 \r\n \r\n My delegation appreciates the work carried out \r\nby the Secretary-General, in accordance with General \r\nAssembly resolution 64/19. The Maldives welcomes \r\nthe work of all those Governments that contributed to \r\nhis report (A/65/380 and Add.1). \r\n It is with great concern and disappointment that \r\nwe note the continued suffering of the people of \r\nPalestine. They have been denied their right to self-\r\ndetermination and their right to live in peace and \r\nfreedom in their own independent State for far too \r\nlong. While recognizing the rights of Palestinians, we \r\nalso appreciate and support the right of the people of \r\nIsrael to live in peace and security alongside an \r\nindependent and sovereign State of Palestine. \r\n The situation in Palestine and the Middle East has \r\nbeen an item on the United Nations agenda for 63 years \r\nnow. During that time, the General Assembly, the \r\nCommission on Human Rights, the Human Rights \r\nCouncil and the Security Council have adopted dozens \r\nof resolutions. However, it is regrettable that the \r\nprinciples, recommendations and decisions contained \r\nin those documents have not produced a solution. \r\n My delegation strongly urges both sides to put an \r\nend to the ongoing violence and to return to the \r\nnegotiating table to broker a peaceful solution. The \r\nMaldives also calls on Israel to observe international \r\nhumanitarian and human rights laws and to end \r\npractices that have been deemed to involve the torture \r\nand inhumane treatment of Palestinian prisoners. We \r\nalso call for the release of all innocent Palestinian \r\ncivilians who remain in their custody. Moreover, we \r\nalso urge Hamas to observe international humanitarian \r\nand human rights laws by allowing humanitarian \r\nworkers access to the captured Israeli soldier Gilad \r\nShalit. \r\n As many have done here today and yesterday, we \r\nwish to draw attention to the human rights tragedy in \r\nGaza, and state once again that encroachments on \r\nhuman rights will continue to hinder the peace process, \r\nas that only strengthens hate and mistrust. As the \r\nIsraeli blockade enters its fourth year, we note that the \r\nsituation for all Palestinians in Gaza has worsened. \r\nEven the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for \r\nPalestine Refugees in the Near East finds it difficult to \r\ncope with the situation in Gaza. While many \r\ndelegations welcome efforts to ease the blockade, the \r\nMaldives condemns the blockade itself and calls on \r\nIsrael to bring an end to it. \r\n Israeli settlements provide another issue of \r\nconcern. The Maldives recognizes the Israeli right to \r\nhousing, but, at the same time, the rights of \r\nPalestinians should not be trampled. Therefore, the \r\nMaldives calls on Israel to freeze the expansion of all \r\nsettlements in the occupied territories. \r\n The note verbale dated 20 July 2010 from the \r\nPermanent Mission of Israel to the United Nations, \r\ncontained in the Secretary-General’s report, states that: \r\n  “Despite significant efforts made on the part \r\nof the Government of Israel in the past year to \r\nrenew negotiations with the Palestinian Authority \r\nand to foster conditions for economic growth and \r\ndevelopment, Palestinian terrorism continued and \r\nremains an alarming reality.” (A/65/380, para. 4) \r\n The Maldives condemns all forms of terrorism in \r\nthe strongest terms, and wishes to underscore that a \r\npeaceful and sustainable solution will be the result of a \r\npeaceful process, as many self-determination \r\nmovements in history can attest. My delegation does \r\nnot believe that violence can provide a real end to the \r\noccupation or meaningfully contribute to a two-State \r\nsolution. Therefore, the Maldives calls on all \r\nstakeholders to avoid violence and to embrace dialogue \r\nand empathy. \r\n In conclusion, the Maldives does not wish to see \r\nanother generation of Palestinians grow up under the \r\nyoke established by the occupation and the blockade, \r\nwhich perpetuates the extreme poverty and depravity \r\nwitnessed over the past 63 years. \r\n We continue our call for all sides to return to the \r\npeace talks in order to resolve their differences, and we \r\nurge all countries to support the pillars that will \r\nprovide an enduring solution to the conflict for the \r\npeople of that region. We believe that dialogue and \r\nconstructive engagement serve the cause of peace \r\nbetter than ostracism and isolation. Violence will never \r\nbring peace to the Middle East. Instead, it will create \r\nmore violence, shed more blood and increase hatred on \r\nboth sides. \r\n Ms. Gini (Bangladesh): Let me begin by \r\nthanking you, Mr. President, for organizing this \r\nimportant meeting on the occasion of the observance of \r\nthe International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian \r\nPeople. We wish to reaffirm our full solidarity with the \r\nPalestinian people and our unwavering support for \r\ntheir legitimate struggle for self-determination. \r\nA/65/PV.54  \r\n \r\n10-65877 18 \r\n \r\nBangladesh stands firm in its position on the Arab-\r\nIsraeli conflict in support of achieving a just, lasting \r\nand comprehensive peace in the Middle East. \r\n The Bangladesh delegation aligns itself with the \r\nstatement made by the representative of the Arab \r\nRepublic of Egypt on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement. Given the importance of the matter, we \r\nwould, however, like to highlight some points of \r\nparticular concern to us. \r\n The Palestinian issue has always been a serious \r\nconcern for Bangladesh. Our Prime Minister, Sheikh \r\nHasina, on the Day of Solidarity expressed our \r\nunwavering support for and solidarity with the \r\nPalestinian people in their just and legitimate struggle \r\nfor the right of self-determination and statehood. \r\n Bangladesh reiterates its long-standing position \r\nthat the continued occupation of Palestine is the root \r\ncause of violence, unrest and destabilization in the \r\nregion. The people of Palestine have been under illegal \r\noccupation for more than five decades. Their \r\nfundamental rights to self-determination and a \r\nsovereign State remain unrealized. The situation in the \r\noccupied territories continues to be one of despair. \r\nMillions are living in refugee camps in abject poverty \r\nand face hunger, disease and malnutrition. Bangladesh \r\nis deeply concerned over the continued suffering of the \r\nPalestinian people and the deteriorating humanitarian \r\nsituation in the occupied territories. \r\n Israel has continued to violate international \r\nhumanitarian law by systematically committing human \r\nrights violations against the Palestinian people. The \r\nsituation in the occupied Palestinian territory, including \r\nEast Jerusalem, remains critical, as indiscriminate \r\nclosures enforced by Israel impede the access of \r\nhumanitarian assistance to the occupied territories, \r\nhalting commercial activities and causing the loss of \r\nthousands of jobs. It has not only restricted access to \r\nthe basic necessities of life, but is also destroying the \r\nsocial fabric of the Palestinian people by causing \r\nwidespread displacement. We therefore demand the \r\nimmediate withdrawal of all restrictions on the \r\nmovement of Palestinian civilians. \r\n Bangladesh stands firm in its constitutional \r\ncommitment of support to the poorest people around \r\nthe world, and has consistently supported the righteous \r\ncause of the self-determination of the Palestinian \r\npeople. We condemn the attacks on the Palestinian \r\npeople in Gaza and the West Bank and the deaths of \r\ninnocent Palestinians, including women and children. \r\nNo verdict can justify the killings of innocent civilians \r\nor the breach of international humanitarian law and \r\nhuman rights standards. \r\n Bangladesh believes that the continued expansion \r\nof Israeli settlements in the occupied territories and the \r\nconstruction of the separation wall threaten to derail \r\nthe ongoing peace negotiations. With the unhindered \r\nconstruction of the wall in disregard for the advisory \r\nopinion of the International Court of Justice, the \r\noccupied territories are increasingly being fragmented \r\ninto smaller parts, which will seriously affect the \r\nviability of a sovereign, stable, peaceful and \r\nindependent Palestinian State. \r\n My delegation draws attention to the fact that \r\nIsrael, as a signatory to the relevant provisions of the \r\nFourth Geneva Convention, which stipulates the \r\nresponsibilities of an occupying Power, cannot legally \r\nor morally absolve itself of its responsibilities to \r\nguarantee the basic human rights of the people under \r\nits occupation. The General Assembly and the Security \r\nCouncil, in the resolutions they have adopted over the \r\nyears, have reconfirmed Israel’s obligation to ensure \r\nthe basic human rights of the Palestinian people. \r\nBangladesh believes that only the full and sincere \r\nimplementation of the relevant General Assembly and \r\nSecurity Council resolutions can resolve the \r\nPalestinian crisis. \r\n Bangladesh wants to see Palestine as a sovereign \r\nState, with recognized borders, living side by side in \r\npeace with Israel. In that regard, we welcome the \r\nmultilateral initiatives, particularly the relevant \r\nSecurity Council resolutions, the Arab peace plan and \r\nthe efforts of the Quartet. The greatest challenge to \r\npeace in the Middle East is the absence of an \r\nenvironment conducive to trust and confidence. We \r\nhope that the parties involved will demonstrate \r\nsincerity in transforming the two-State solution into a \r\nreality. \r\n One day after the International Day of Solidarity \r\nwith the Palestinian People, we call on the \r\ninternational community to take resolute steps to \r\nalleviate the plight of our Palestinian brethren, revive \r\nthe peace process and enable the global values of \r\nmutual respect, human rights, the harmonious \r\ncoexistence of nations and the peaceful resolution of \r\ndisputes to prevail in the Middle East. \r\n A/65/PV.54\r\n \r\n19 10-65877 \r\n \r\n In closing, we would like to underscore that \r\nIsrael’s activities in the occupied territories remain a \r\nmatter of grave concern to us. We express our full \r\nsolidarity with the Palestinian people and reiterate our \r\nsteadfast support for their legitimate and inalienable \r\nright to a sovereign and independent State, with \r\nJerusalem as its capital. \r\n Mr. Ali (Malaysia): My delegation wishes to \r\nalign itself with the statement made earlier in the \r\ndebate by the representative of Egypt on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement. \r\n The resumption of direct negotiations between \r\nPalestine and Israel in September was indeed a \r\nlaudable initiative undertaken by the parties concerned, \r\nas well as other regional and international players, \r\nincluding the United States and the other members of \r\nthe Quartet. However, we were disheartened when that \r\ncourageous undertaking faced a bleak impasse, with no \r\nclear sight of progress. \r\n Israel’s illegal policies and inhumane practices, \r\nwhich continue with impunity, detract from the effort \r\nto realize the aspiration of creating two sovereign \r\nStates living side by side in peace. Israel’s \r\nintransigence is evident from the following. \r\n First is the continuation and expansion of illegal \r\nsettlement activities in the West Bank, including East \r\nJerusalem, with the recent plans to construct more than \r\n1,500 settlement units in parts of East Jerusalem and \r\n800 units in the Ariel settlement in the West Bank. \r\n Second is the forced eviction of the Palestinian \r\npeople; the demolition of their homes and other \r\ninfrastructures, such as places of worship; the \r\nconfiscation of Palestinian lands, including through the \r\nbuilding of the illegal separation wall, which, to date, \r\ncontinues to be built despite the advisory opinion of \r\nthe International Court of Justice to stop its \r\nconstruction; and the revocation of the residency rights \r\nof Palestinian Jerusalemites. \r\n Third are the incidents of violence towards and \r\nattacks on Palestinian civilians, Palestinian property, \r\nagricultural land and crops, as well as Muslim and \r\nChristian places of worship and holy sites, by extremist \r\nIsraeli settlers. Such provocative and brutal acts \r\ncontinue unabated. \r\n Fourth is the imprisonment in Israel of thousands \r\nof Palestinians, including Palestinian women and \r\nchildren, who have been subjected to ill-treatment and \r\ntorture by the Israeli authorities. \r\n Fifth is the imposition of measures that constitute \r\na form of collective punishment, which is strictly \r\nforbidden under international humanitarian law. Such \r\nmeasures include the illegal blockade of Gaza, which \r\nhas restricted the passage of essential goods and \r\nconstruction materials to the vulnerable group, the \r\nhundreds of checkpoints and roadblocks and the permit \r\nsystem, as well as other obstacles that violate the \r\nPalestinians’ right to freedom of movement. \r\n Sixth is the new legislation approved by the \r\nIsraeli parliament last Monday, which requires a two-\r\nthirds majority or a referendum on any potential land-\r\nfor-peace agreement. \r\n It is obvious that such exploitation is not only \r\nillegal and immoral, but also counterproductive to the \r\naim of achieving a genuine and lasting peace. Israel \r\ncannot cloud the eyes of the international community \r\nby simply enumerating actions undertaken to lessen the \r\nsufferings of the Palestinians. \r\n Instead, Israel must heed the high expectations of \r\nthe international community to end this long-standing \r\nconflict by improving the situation on the ground, \r\nstopping the construction of illegal settlements, lifting \r\nthe blockade in Gaza, addressing humanitarian needs \r\nand improving the atmosphere for negotiation, among \r\nother things. In that connection, we call on the United \r\nStates and the other members of the Quartet to \r\npersuade Israel to stop its intransigence, particularly \r\nthe construction of settlements in the occupied \r\nPalestinian territory, including East Jerusalem. That \r\nsaid, Malaysia believes that the achievement of \r\npolitical unity among Palestinians is equally important \r\nto moving the peace process forward and \r\nreconstructing the Gaza Strip. \r\n Yesterday, we also marked the International Day \r\nof Solidarity with the Palestinian People. I wish to take \r\nthis opportunity to pay tribute to all Palestinians who \r\nhave suffered in their just struggle to live in freedom \r\nand in dignity in a State they can call their own. The \r\npeople of Palestine can count on Malaysia’s \r\nunwavering support in their efforts to create an \r\nindependent and sovereign State of Palestine, with East \r\nJerusalem as its capital. \r\n Mr. Rivard (Canada): While the situation on the \r\nground has remained largely calm since the Gaza \r\nA/65/PV.54  \r\n \r\n10-65877 20 \r\n \r\nconflict, there continue to be sporadic rocket attacks on \r\nIsrael emanating from Gaza, which we strongly \r\ncondemn as designed to ensure the failure of the \r\nUnited States-led peace talks. It is important that these \r\nspoiler elements not be given the opportunity to derail \r\nthe chance for peace. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n If the peace talks are to succeed, it is urgent that \r\nthe parties take a risk for peace. This is not easy to do \r\nin a part of the world where mistrust is deeply rooted \r\nand the dangers are very real. But without genuine \r\nleadership and a vision for a better tomorrow, we know \r\nwhat the future will hold — unending violence and \r\nbloodshed on both sides. Every effort should be made \r\nto ensure that this does not occur. \r\n It is important to note that the Palestinian \r\nAuthority has made real progress in its reforms, which \r\nwe applaud. However, much remains to be done. That \r\nis why Canada’s assistance is focused clearly on the \r\nsecurity and justice sectors. At the same time, the \r\nGovernment of Israel must fulfil its commitments on \r\nsettlements and on the access and movement of people \r\nand goods. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n Canada continues to recognize the important role \r\nof the United Nations and its Member States in \r\nsupporting the peace process. United Nations agencies \r\nremain at the forefront of providing assistance to those \r\nin need in the region. However, Canada remains \r\nconcerned about the number of United Nations \r\nresolutions that single out Israel, as well as the \r\ndisproportionate focus placed on the Middle East. Now \r\nmore than ever, we strongly believe that the efforts of \r\nthe United Nations and its Member States should \r\ncomplement efforts towards ensuring that peace talks \r\nbegin again and that a climate for success is created. \r\n Once again, Canada urges the parties to do \r\nwhatever it takes to return to direct negotiations. There \r\nis simply no other reasonable option. \r\n Mrs. Rubiales de Chamorro (Nicaragua) (spoke \r\nin Spanish): At the outset, my delegation would like to \r\nassociate itself with the statement made by the \r\ndelegation of Egypt as Chair of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement. \r\n Once again, we meet this year to observe the \r\nInternational Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian \r\nPeople. After 63 years, Israel is still rejecting peace \r\nand the establishment of a sovereign, independent State \r\nof Palestine. On a daily basis, the international \r\ncommunity witnesses the look of terror in the eyes of \r\nPalestinian children and the images of Palestinian \r\nfarmers clinging to an olive tree as they are expelled \r\nfrom their lands and the homes they sacrificed so much \r\nto build. We also bear witness to the pain of mothers \r\nwho cannot watch their children grow up because they \r\nare either assassinated or imprisoned. \r\n The supposed deadlock of the peace negotiations \r\nfor over a month now is just the most recent evidence \r\nthat achieving peace is not Israel’s true intention. In \r\norder to ensure the complete failure of the negotiations, \r\nthe Israeli Parliament recently enacted a law, presented \r\nby the Government, requiring that the withdrawal of \r\nthe Israeli army from occupied territories be submitted \r\nto a referendum. \r\n For years now, the most reactionary Israeli voices \r\nhave declared that the only solution is permanent war. \r\nSuccessive Governments have successfully carried out \r\nthis policy through a murderous occupation, a \r\ngenocidal blockade and the collective torture of an \r\nentire people. The military industry is today the most \r\nlucrative industry in Israel. \r\n Israel has always had the economic and military \r\ncapacity to pursue its policy of permanent war thanks \r\nto a crucial accomplice that has supplied it with war \r\nmateriel that it used to kill more than 1,500 \r\nPalestinians between December 2008 and January 2009 \r\nand to murder, in cold blood and in international \r\nwaters, nine innocent people participating in the \r\nfreedom flotilla. Above all, that nation is complicit in \r\ngranting Israel impunity, particularly in the Security \r\nCouncil, where it now threatens to veto any attempt to \r\nissue a unilateral declaration of an independent \r\nPalestinian State. \r\n Peace in the Middle East does not just involve \r\nresolving the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. It must also \r\nnecessarily include the situations in Lebanon and \r\nSyria, which also have occupied territories. \r\nFurthermore, it must include all countries of the region. \r\nIt will also be crucial to eliminate all nuclear weapons \r\nfrom the Middle East. This means that Israel must \r\naccept nuclear disarmament and become a party to the \r\nrelevant international conventions. It will not be \r\npossible to achieve a climate of trust until that \r\nhappens. \r\n A/65/PV.54\r\n \r\n21 10-65877 \r\n \r\n Nicaragua would like once again to reiterate its \r\nfirm condemnation of Israel’s occupation of the \r\nPalestinian territories, the Syrian Golan Heights and \r\nLebanese territory, and of the criminal blockade \r\nagainst the Palestinian people, and demands that Israel \r\ncomply with all Security Council and General \r\nAssembly resolutions. \r\n The supposed relaxation of the blockade of the \r\nGaza Strip is a mere cosmetic measure to deflect \r\ninternational attention. The ongoing construction of \r\nIsraeli settlements in the occupied territories and the \r\nrefusal to dismantle existing settlements are nothing \r\nless than a mockery of the peace process aimed at \r\nimposing conditions on the negotiations and changing \r\nthe demographic and religious composition of these \r\nterritories. \r\n Nicaragua and Palestine are celebrating 30 years \r\nof diplomatic ties, and a number of different events \r\nhave been planned in our country in this respect. Some \r\nof these activities include the reactivation of the \r\nNicaraguan Palestinian community association and the \r\nestablishment of a committee for solidarity with the \r\nPalestinian people. Similarly, Commander Daniel \r\nOrtega, President of Nicaragua, recently received in \r\nour country the survivors of the freedom flotilla and \r\ngave the keys to the city to Palestinian revolutionary \r\nLeila Khaled. \r\n On the occasion of this year’s International Day \r\nof Solidarity with the Palestinian People, the \r\nGovernment and people of Nicaragua request that those \r\ncountries that have not yet done so transform their \r\nexpressions of support and solidarity into a concrete \r\nact — recognition of the Palestinian State. \r\n Nicaragua would also like to take this opportunity \r\nto express its firm support for the General Assembly’s \r\ntaking a stand on the issue of recognition of a free and \r\nsovereign Palestinian State, as it should have done \r\nmore than 60 years ago. That is an obligation, and it \r\nshould be a priority for the Assembly to honour the \r\npurposes and objectives of this Organization as \r\nconceived by those who crafted its Charter. \r\n Mr. Cabactulan (Philippines): As we \r\ncommemorated the International Day of Solidarity with \r\nthe Palestinian People yesterday, I wish to join you, \r\nSir, and others in congratulating the Palestinian people \r\non that auspicious day. \r\n The question of Palestine is one of the most \r\nsensitive and long-running issues on the agenda of the \r\nUnited Nations. It impinges on the overall issues of \r\ndurable peace and development in the Middle East. \r\nDespite years of debate and substantial energy and \r\nresources spent, the resolution of this problem remains \r\nelusive. And since it has become a permanent fixture \r\non the United Nations agenda, there is a danger that we \r\nsometimes deal with it more as a ritual, thereby losing \r\nthe freshness and urgency it truly deserves. \r\n The Philippines shares with the Palestinian \r\npeople their legitimate aspirations to achieving justice, \r\npeace and freedom. In the General Assembly’s regular \r\ndebates on the subject, the Philippines has consistently \r\nsupported the Palestinians’ quest for self-rule and self-\r\ndetermination, as well as the establishment of a \r\nPalestinian homeland. The Philippines has also \r\nrepeatedly expressed its support for the complete and \r\nunconditional lifting of the blockade imposed by the \r\nState of Israel on the occupied Palestinian territories, \r\nespecially Gaza. We find the embargo \r\ncounterproductive; it serves only to collectively punish \r\nhapless civilians, particularly women and children. \r\n The Philippines welcomes the resumption of the \r\nprotracted talks between the Palestinian Authority and \r\nthe State of Israel, and is hopeful that, despite the \r\nobstacles and hurdles on the road ahead, a \r\nbreakthrough can be achieved in due time. More work \r\nand sacrifice, however, are still needed. The \r\nPhilippines urges both parties to work together to forge \r\na lasting peace. The international community’s \r\nassistance is, of course, more important than ever. Only \r\nwith the establishment of an independent and viable \r\nPalestinian State, living side by side in peace and \r\nsecurity with its neighbours, will the Palestinian people \r\ntruly attain their rightful place in the community of \r\nnations. \r\n Let us not lose sight of the fact that we all have a \r\nstake in the peaceful settlement of the question of \r\nPalestine. It may still be on our agenda next year, and \r\nmaybe in years to come, but it should inspire us to \r\nwork even harder and not to allow hopelessness and \r\ninaction to set in. The Philippines stands ready to \r\ncooperate and work together with like-minded Member \r\nStates to find a good answer to the question of \r\nPalestine, not just for its significance for the stability \r\nand progress of the Middle East, but also for the \r\nbenefit of the entire world. \r\nA/65/PV.54  \r\n \r\n10-65877 22 \r\n \r\n Mr. Sipangule (Zambia): Allow me to \r\ncongratulate you, Mr. President, on the professional \r\nmanner in which you have conducted these \r\nproceedings. We thank you for organizing this \r\nimportant meeting. \r\n My delegation wishes to align itself with the \r\nstatement on the question of Palestine delivered by the \r\nrepresentative of the Arab Republic of Egypt on behalf \r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement. \r\n We meet today after the commemoration \r\nyesterday of the International Day of Solidarity with \r\nthe Palestinian People, 16 years after the promulgation \r\nof a peace accord aimed at establishing a Palestinian \r\nState existing in peace side by side with the State of \r\nIsrael. Since then, there have been many efforts by the \r\ninternational community, including the United Nations, \r\nto find a lasting solution to the problem of the question \r\nof Palestine. My delegation would like to see continue \r\nthe peaceful negotiations that once gave so much hope. \r\n It is in light of the prevailing situation that the \r\nZambian delegation wishes to reiterate its belief in and \r\nsupport for the inalienable right of the Palestinian \r\npeople to a State of their own in full and secure \r\nboundaries and sovereignty, and in peaceful \r\ncoexistence with the State of Israel. As a country that \r\nmaintains mutually beneficial relations with both Israel \r\nand the Palestinian National Authority, my delegation \r\nurges the two parties to seize the momentum signalled \r\nby the renewed commitment of the Quartet to engaging \r\nin honest negotiations leading to a solution. \r\n The Palestinians and Israelis need the support of \r\nthe Security Council, the Middle East Quartet and the \r\ninternational community at large to bring them to the \r\nnegotiating table. In order that these objectives may be \r\nachieved, my delegation wishes to urge all the parties \r\nto adhere to the tenets of international and \r\nhumanitarian law, as well as to all resolutions of the \r\nGeneral Assembly concerning the matter. \r\n Zambia recognizes the important work of the \r\nUnited Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine \r\nRefugees in the Near East (UNRWA) in the West Bank, \r\nGaza and all the occupied Palestinian territories. We \r\nwish to add our voice to the many others calling for \r\nIsrael’s cooperation and increased United Nations \r\nsupport for UNRWA to facilitate the smooth execution \r\nof its mandate. As all in this Hall are aware, the work \r\nof UNRWA in Palestine is the lifeblood of the people \r\nin all the occupied territories. \r\n As in the past, at the end of this debate my \r\ndelegation would like again to reaffirm its commitment \r\nto all efforts leading to a mutually acceptable \r\nnegotiated solution to the Israeli and Palestinian \r\nconflict. In this regard, Zambia will maintain its past \r\nvoting pattern on the draft resolutions on the agenda \r\nitems before us. \r\n The President (spoke in French): The \r\nrepresentative of the Syrian Arab Republic asked to \r\nspeak in exercise of the right of reply. However, due to \r\ntechnical difficulties, I propose that he postpone his \r\nstatement until the next meeting. \r\n  The meeting rose at 12.30 pm. \r\n \r\n"
