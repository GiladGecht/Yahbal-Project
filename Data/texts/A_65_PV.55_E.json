(Switzerland) \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 37 (continued) \r\n \r\nQuestion of Palestine \r\n \r\n  Report of the Committee on the Exercise of the \r\nInalienable Rights of the Palestinian People \r\n(A/65/35) \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/65/380 and \r\nA/65/380/Add.1) \r\n \r\n  Draft resolutions (A/65/L.14, A/65/L.15, \r\nA/65/L.16, A/65/L.17 and A/65/L.24) \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): Members will \r\nrecall that at the end of this morning’s meeting I \r\nannounced that we would begin our meeting this \r\nafternoon with a statement by the representative of the \r\nSyrian Arab Republic in exercise of the right of reply. \r\nBefore giving him the floor, I remind him that \r\nstatements in exercise of the right of reply are limited \r\nto 10 minutes and should be made by delegations from \r\ntheir seats.  \r\n I now give the floor to the representative of the \r\nSyrian Arab Republic to speak in exercise of the right \r\nof reply. \r\n Mr. Ja’afari (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in \r\nFrench): Before I address the substance of my \r\nstatement, I express the hope that such technical \r\nproblems will never again recur under your presidency.  \r\n(spoke in Arabic)  \r\n Allow me at the outset to read some titles of \r\narticles published recently in the Israeli press. These \r\narticles are a direct response from the Israeli press \r\nitself to the erroneous allegations put forward by the \r\nIsraeli representative against my country.  \r\n The first article was published by the Israeli \r\nnewspaper Ha’aretz on 24 November. In the article, \r\none can read the following:  \r\n “The referendum concerning the occupied Golan \r\nand East Jerusalem is one further insult to the \r\ninternational community and significantly \r\nchanges Israel’s commitment to respecting \r\nresolutions of international legitimacy.”  \r\n The second article, which appeared in the Israeli \r\npaper Israel Today on 25 November, states:  \r\n “The Israeli Government is attempting to \r\nundemocratically prevent by law the signing of a \r\npeace agreement with Syria and the achievement \r\nof reconciliation with Palestine with regard to \r\nJerusalem.” \r\n The third article, which was published on \r\n28 November, that is, two days ago, in Ha’aretz, is \r\nentitled “We Israelis, Sons of the Chosen People, will \r\ndecide the fate of another people living for generations \r\nunder occupation. This is Israeli insolence in its most \r\nhateful form”. These are comments that were made in \r\nHa’aretz; they are not my words. In that article, one \r\ncan also read:  \r\nA/65/PV.55  \r\n \r\n10-66016 2 \r\n \r\n “Under Israeli democracy in its clearest form, the \r\npeople as a whole will decide the question of \r\nsettling the conflict but not the question of \r\nsettlements or the questions of annexation, war or \r\nconflict.” \r\nHere again, we see Israeli attempts to mislead us.  \r\n As a result, the Israelis legislate the settlement of \r\nthe conflict with a view to deferring the settlement date \r\nagain and again. The Israelis should have asked the \r\nfollowing questions of their Government: Where are \r\nyou taking us? Where are we headed? The settlements \r\nwill continue to be built, the occupation is deepening \r\nand becoming further rooted, but what will happen \r\nafter that? \r\n Israeli State terrorism is clear and documented by \r\na number of international institutions, which have \r\nassembled a black record of massacres, crimes, \r\naggressions and occupation of Arab territories \r\nextending back more than 60 years. As such, Israel \r\nexcels at State terrorism, carrying out the most \r\natrocious crimes against civilians in Palestine, the \r\nGolan, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt, Tunisia and the Sudan.  \r\n Undoubtedly, we all remember what happened in \r\nQana, Jenin, Nablus, Gaza, Bahr el-Baqar, Deir Yassin \r\nand al-Quneitra. Israeli State terrorism has not even \r\nspared the representatives of the United Nations, from \r\nthe killing of the mediator Count Bernadotte to the \r\ncrimes committed against peacekeepers serving in the \r\nUnited Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, and \r\nultimately the destruction of the headquarters of the \r\nUnited Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine \r\nRefugees in the Near East in Gaza in 2008 and the \r\nkilling of the peace activists this year. We cannot list \r\nhere all Israel’s practices throughout its history, such as \r\nwar crimes, genocide and ethnic cleansing.  \r\n Perhaps Israel can deceive and lead some to \r\nbelieve its lies for some time, but it cannot do so \r\nforever, because its racist aggressive policies are now \r\nwell known and have been condemned by the majority \r\nof the States in the world. The word “Israel” has \r\nbecome synonymous with such words as “aggression”, \r\n“killing”, “racism”, “occupation”, “terrorism” and \r\n“assassination”. The most recent assassination took \r\nplace in Dubai, as everyone knows.  \r\n Israel will need a great deal of forgiveness and \r\npardon from its victims. Israel needs to be more \r\nintrospective and must be accountable for terrorist \r\ncrimes committed for decades by successive \r\nGovernments before the international community, \r\nofficials and civilians alike, can think about stopping \r\ntheir condemnation of it. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I would like to \r\ninform members that, upon request of the author, the \r\nAssembly will take a decision on draft resolution \r\nA/65/L.24, entitled “The one-State solution”, at a later \r\ndate. I would also like to inform members that action \r\nwill be taken on draft resolutions A/65/L.14 through \r\nA/65/L.17 immediately after consideration of agenda \r\nitem 36, “The situation in the Middle East”.  \r\n The General Assembly has thus concluded this \r\nstage of its consideration of agenda item 37. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 36 \r\n \r\nThe situation in the Middle East  \r\n \r\n  Reports of the Secretary-General (A/65/379, \r\nA/65/380 and A/65/380/Add.1) \r\n \r\n  Draft resolutions (A/65/L.18 and A/65/L.19)  \r\n  \r\n The President (spoke in French): I give the floor \r\nto the representative of Egypt to introduce draft \r\nresolutions A/65/L.18 and A/65/L.19. \r\n Mr. Abdelaziz (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nGeneral Assembly is today taking up agenda item 36, \r\n“The situation in the Middle East”, emphasizing its \r\ninherent role in addressing the conflict and constant \r\ntension in the Middle East resulting from Israel’s \r\nillegal occupation of Arab occupied territories since \r\n1967, and its refusal to accept the will of the \r\ninternational community and to implement relevant \r\nUnited Nations resolutions and the rules of \r\ninternational law and international humanitarian law, \r\ndespite all regional and international efforts to reach a \r\nnegotiated solution allowing for a lasting, \r\ncomprehensive and just peaceful settlement of the \r\nquestion of Palestine, the core of the conflict. \r\n Undoubtedly, the Middle East is now passing \r\nthrough an extremely dangerous phase as a result of the \r\nintransigent positions of the Israeli Government. Lately \r\nwe have witnessed an increase in Israeli violations of \r\ninternational law, reflected by the illegal expansion of \r\nsettlements, particularly in and around East Jerusalem, \r\nespecially with the end of the so-called moratorium on \r\nsettlements. Israel has done this despite calls by all \r\nstakeholders, including the United Nations, the \r\n A/65/PV.55\r\n \r\n3 10-66016 \r\n \r\ninternational Quartet and the European Union, for it to \r\ndesist.  \r\n Israel’s violations of international law, human \r\nrights law and international humanitarian law have \r\nbeen increasing, as manifested by many practices, such \r\nas the detention of 10,000 Palestinians in Israeli jails \r\nand detention facilities without any legal grounds; the \r\ncontinued construction of the racist separation wall, in \r\ndefiance of the advisory opinion of the International \r\nCourt of Justice; the tight siege of the Gaza Strip, \r\ncontrary to Security Council resolution 1860 (2009) \r\nand General Assembly resolution ES-10/18; the \r\nbarriers and checkpoints in the West Bank; the Jewish \r\nloyalty oath instituted by the Israeli Cabinet to isolate \r\nthe Arab-Israel population in Israel; the recent Knesset \r\nlegislation setting stringent new conditions on any \r\nwithdrawal from the occupied Arab territories annexed \r\nto Israel except through a referendum or the approval \r\nof a two-third majority of the Knesset; and many other \r\nviolations that time will not permit us to list. \r\n What is especially disappointing is the fact that \r\nall of those violations are linked to Israel’s deliberate \r\nquest to undermine all attempts to resume the direct \r\nnegotiations that were agreed and endorsed by the \r\nPalestinian side, indicating its unwillingness to reach a \r\npeaceful settlement. That refusal will have dire \r\nconsequences not only for the Israelis and Palestinians, \r\nbut for the whole region and indeed the world.  \r\n In the light of those violations, the international \r\ncommunity, represented by the General Assembly, is \r\ncalled on today more than ever to provide political \r\nsupport to efforts aimed at resuming the negotiating \r\nprocess, to emphasize the illegality of settlement \r\nbuilding and the acquisition of others’ territory by \r\nforce, and to compel Israel to fulfil its commitments \r\nand to enter into serious negotiations on the six core \r\nissues of the Palestinian track. We must call on Israel \r\nto work towards a just, lasting, comprehensive and \r\npeaceful solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict on all \r\ntracks, on the basis of the principle of land for peace, \r\nthe Arab Peace Initiative, the Road Map and relevant \r\nUnited Nations resolutions.  \r\n By the same token, the international community, \r\nrepresented by the General Assembly, must also stress \r\nand reaffirm the illegality of all measures taken or to \r\nbe taken by Israel to alter the legal status or the facts \r\non the ground in the occupied Syrian Golan, and that \r\nall those and other measures, including the most recent \r\nbill before the Israeli Parliament, are illegal and \r\ntherefore null and void because they represent a clear \r\nviolation of all pertinent United Nations resolutions. \r\nThe General Assembly should also demand that Israel \r\nfully comply with Security Council resolution 497 \r\n(1981) and fully withdraw from the occupied Syrian \r\nGolan to the borders of 4 June 1967, in accordance \r\nwith Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 \r\n(1973). \r\n In order to express the international community’s \r\nrejection of Israel’s ongoing occupation and illegal \r\npractices in the occupied Arab territories and to \r\nconfront the grave deterioration in the peace process, I \r\nam pleased to present to the General Assembly under \r\nagenda item 36, “The situation in the Middle East”, \r\ntwo draft resolutions, one on Jerusalem (A/65/L.18) \r\nand the other on the Syrian Golan (A/65/L.19).  \r\n The first draft resolution, on Jerusalem, reaffirms \r\nthat the relevant General Assembly and Security \r\nCouncil resolutions remain the main terms of reference \r\nfor the special status of occupied East Jerusalem, and \r\nagain confirms the renunciation and repudiation of all \r\nlegislative and administrative measures and actions \r\ntaken by Israel to alter the character and legal status of \r\nthe city. It also affirms that any just and comprehensive \r\nsolution to the question of Jerusalem should include \r\ninternationally guaranteed provisions to ensure the \r\nfreedom of religion and of conscience of its \r\ninhabitants. That freedom is restricted by settlement \r\nactivity and by Israeli settlers, unlawful attempts by \r\nIsrael to impose a Jewish character on the city, \r\nviolations of the right of the Palestinians to have access \r\nto places of worship, repeated aggressions against the \r\nAl-Aqsa Mosque compound and threats to its \r\nstructures, and the excavation in the old city of \r\nJerusalem, including in and around the holy places. \r\n The second draft resolution, on the occupied \r\nSyrian Golan, recalls Security Council resolution 497 \r\n(1981) and underlines the deep concern of the General \r\nAssembly about Israel’s continued non-compliance \r\nwith its implementation. It also confirms the \r\napplicability of The Hague Convention of 1907 and the \r\nFourth Geneva Convention of 1949 to the Syrian \r\nterritory occupied since 1967 and the illegitimacy of \r\nboth the decision to apply Israeli laws in that territory \r\nand the settlement activities there. The draft resolution \r\nalso renews calls upon Israel to withdraw fully from \r\nthe occupied Syrian Golan to the borders of 4 June \r\n1967 and to respect previous pledges in that regard. \r\nA/65/PV.55  \r\n \r\n10-66016 4 \r\n \r\n The sponsors of the two draft resolutions believe \r\nthat it is high time for the international community to \r\ndeal with the question of the Middle East \r\ncomprehensively. The peoples of the region, who \r\ncontinue to suffer the scourge of war and aggression, \r\naspire to achieve peace, stability and coexistence. \r\nThese cannot be achieved without Israel’s political will \r\nand serious commitment to fully withdraw from all \r\noccupied Palestinian and Arab territories, based on the \r\nprinciple of land for peace, the rules of international \r\nlaw, the Arab Peace Initiative and the Road Map, and \r\non the basis of all terms of reference stated in the \r\nMadrid principles and relevant Security Council and \r\nGeneral Assembly resolutions. \r\n To that end, the sponsors look forward to the \r\nsupport of all States members of the General Assembly \r\nand their votes in favour of the two draft resolutions in \r\nsupport of the important goals that they enunciate, in \r\norder to reaffirm the steadfast international will to \r\nachieve the set goals and to uphold the lofty purposes \r\nand principles of the Charter. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I would like to \r\nremind members that we have many speakers on our \r\nlist. I therefore suggest that speakers shorten their \r\nstatements and distribute their full texts in the Hall. If \r\ntime permits, I would like us to take action on the draft \r\nresolutions today. If we cannot, we will have to meet \r\ntomorrow morning at 10 a.m. \r\n Mr. Ja’afari (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in \r\nArabic): First of all, I would like to align our \r\ndelegation with the statement made by our colleague \r\nthe representative of Egypt on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement. I would also like to thank \r\nhim for introducing draft resolutions A/65/L.18 on \r\nJerusalem and A/65/L.19 on the Syrian Golan. \r\n How long will the General Assembly continue to \r\nconsider the agenda item on the situation in the Middle \r\nEast? The General Assembly began its consideration of \r\nthis item in 1970 at its twenty-fifth session. It has \r\nconsidered it every year since, without making any \r\ntangible progress. How long will the General Assembly \r\nat each and every session call on Israel, the occupying \r\nPower, to put an end to its occupation of the Arab \r\nterritories, stating that any steps taken by Israel in the \r\noccupied Arab territories to impose its jurisdiction, \r\nadministration and laws in the Syrian Golan or \r\nJerusalem have absolutely no legality and are null and \r\nvoid. \r\n Is it not high time for the General Assembly to \r\nplay the part it is given in the Charter by ensuring the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, \r\nespecially given the fact that the Security Council has \r\nfailed to ensure implementation of its unanimously \r\nadopted resolutions, including resolution 476 (1980) on \r\noccupied Jerusalem and resolution 497 (1981) on the \r\noccupied Syrian Golan? These two resolutions reject \r\nthe provocative and unilateral decisions of the \r\noccupying Israeli authorities to annex Jerusalem and \r\nthe occupied Golan and determine that they were \r\nillegal and null and void. Is the international \r\ncommunity not aware that Israel is flouting \r\ninternational law and humanitarian and ethical \r\nprinciples? Over 1,000 resolutions have been adopted \r\nby the United Nations system and agencies over the \r\npast 40 years. \r\n Today once again, we find ourselves considering \r\nthis same agenda item on the situation in the Middle \r\nEast. It is a very dangerous moment, and the chances \r\nof war seem to be trumping the chances for peace due \r\nto increasing Israeli aggression and an unprecedented \r\nlevel of settlement construction. Most recently, last \r\nmonth Israel decided to build more than 1,300 housing \r\nunits in East Jerusalem with a view to undermining all \r\nArab, regional and worldwide hopes for achieving a \r\njust and comprehensive peace in the Middle East at the \r\nvery moment when the entire world is working to \r\nachieve that peace, declaring that peace is an absolute \r\nprerequisite for achieving regional and international \r\nsecurity and stability. \r\n The world is absolutely shocked at Israel’s \r\nongoing talk of war. Israel continues its belligerent \r\npractices, pursues its Jewish settlement construction, \r\nprofanes holy sites, has imposed a blockade on Gaza \r\nand is threatening to evict millions of Palestinians from \r\ntheir land. Such behaviour is discriminatory, racist and \r\nbased on archaic political ideologies that call for \r\nreligious and ethnic cleansing in order to give life to \r\nthe mirage of Israeli Judaism. \r\n Israel continues to pursue such practices as the \r\nbuilding of the racist separation wall and is moving \r\nahead with the Judaization of Jerusalem. It is also \r\nmaking decisions based on racism, the most recent \r\nbeing the Jewish loyalty oath to be taken by non-Jews. \r\nAnd they call this a democracy. \r\n All of these laws reflect the racism of Israel and \r\nrepresent the very antithesis of all calls of the \r\n A/65/PV.55\r\n \r\n5 10-66016 \r\n \r\ninternational community for freedom and equality in \r\nthe twenty-first century. These laws also expose the \r\nfalsehood of the claim that Israel is an oasis of \r\ndemocracy in the Middle East. Israel wants to create a \r\nnew form of democracy — a racist, colonialist, \r\nexpansionist, occupying and aggressive democracy. \r\n Syria and the Arab States have adopted peace as a \r\nstrategic option. We adopted the Arab Peace Initiative \r\nin 2002 at the Arab summit in Beirut. The Initiative \r\nentails everything that peace implies: recognition of \r\nArab rights, recuperation of land, Israel’s withdrawal \r\nfrom all occupied Arab territories to the borders of \r\n4 June 1967, the establishment of an independent \r\nPalestinian State, with its capital in East Jerusalem, and \r\nthe return of Palestinian refugees, in accordance with \r\nresolution 194 (III) of 1948. \r\n Now, what has been the Israeli response to the \r\nArab Peace Initiative? Israeli’s response has been to \r\nsimply ignore the appeals, to invade the West Bank and \r\nto perpetrate massacres in Jenin and Nablus in 2002. \r\nIsrael has continued its expansionist settlement \r\npolicies, seizing more territory and resources. Not \r\ncontent with what it had already done, Israel waged its \r\nbarbaric aggression against Lebanon in 2006 and \r\nagainst Gaza in 2008. It then attacked the freedom \r\nflotilla carrying humanitarian assistance to Gaza, \r\nkilling nine political activists. \r\n The Israeli occupation of the Syrian Golan is part \r\nand parcel of its very dark policy. Israel still refuses to \r\nreturn the occupied Syrian Golan to its motherland of \r\nSyria. It refuses to comply with international legality, \r\nparticularly Security Council resolution 497 (1981). \r\nJust a few days ago, the Israeli Knesset promulgated a \r\nlaw calling for a referendum on its eventual withdrawal \r\nfrom Syrian Golan and occupied East Jerusalem.  \r\n These actions have been taken with respect to \r\nterritories where Israel has no right to make decisions. \r\nThey are a violation of international law and a rebuff to \r\nthe political will and position of the international \r\ncommunity, which has decided unanimously in two \r\nSecurity Council resolutions that Jerusalem and the \r\nSyrian Golan are occupied Arab territories. The \r\ninternational community has also decreed that the \r\nIsraeli decisions to annex those two territories are null \r\nand void. The Israeli position has been rejected and \r\ncannot alter the fact that the Syrian Golan is occupied \r\nterritory. This is non-negotiable, and the 4 June 1967 \r\nborders of the Syrian Golan must be restored. This is a \r\nprerequisite for peace. \r\n There are some who still harbour the illusion that \r\nthe current Israeli Government is truly seeking peace. \r\nOn the basis of that belief, Israel has been granted \r\nfavours, known as packages, but it pursues it \r\nrepression and terrorizing of Syrian citizens. It has \r\nimprisoned citizens of the Golan, seized land and built \r\nmore settlements; it has pillaged the Golan’s resources, \r\ndistorted its history and planted mines there. There is \r\nalso the question of the Israeli theft of water. The \r\nSyrian Foreign Minister recently sent two identical \r\nletters to the Presidents of the Security Council and the \r\nGeneral Assembly (A/65/542) regarding Israel’s theft \r\nof the water of Mas’adah Lake in the Golan, leading to \r\nthe loss of approximately $20 million worth of \r\nresources. \r\n I reconfirm from this rostrum that Syria has a \r\nsovereign right to the occupied Syrian Golan up to the \r\nborders of 4 June 1967. This right is neither negotiable \r\nnor subject to bartering. Peace must be based on that \r\nright. Syria reconfirms that this is a prerequisite for the \r\nachievement of peace. We are not merely calling on \r\nIsrael to make what it calls painful concessions. This is \r\npurely and simply a matter of a right that has been \r\nusurped and land that must be returned. The people of \r\nSyria and the Arab countries are truly committed to a \r\njust and comprehensive peace as a strategic option, \r\nalong with everything that implies, including the \r\ncomplete restitution of rights and the full return of \r\noccupied territories.  \r\n However, it is not possible for us to ignore reality \r\nand legitimate questions about the future. It would be \r\nillogical and inadmissible for us, as Arabs, to continue \r\nto manifest our true desire for peace when Israel is the \r\nparty occupying our territories. Israel is the party \r\ncommitting aggression against our peoples and our \r\nrights and continuing to threaten to unleash war. Thus \r\nwe, along with the international community, would ask \r\nthe following question: Can a State that was founded \r\non illegal occupation and the continual murders of \r\nnative Palestinian citizens; that has committed \r\nmassacres in Lebanon, the West Bank, Gaza, the Syrian \r\nGolan and elsewhere; and that has undertaken acts of \r\nState terror that have overwhelmed several regions, act \r\nin favour of peace? Can a State whose successive \r\nGovernments have publicly and privately prevented the \r\nachievement of a settlement through the peace process \r\nbe a full partner in the peace process, particularly when \r\nA/65/PV.55  \r\n \r\n10-66016 6 \r\n \r\nthe Head of that State represents one of the most \r\nextremist Governments in the history of that country? \r\nThere is an even more important question to be asked \r\nand answered within this forum. How long will Israel \r\nplace itself above the law? How long will Israel \r\ncontinue to act with impunity, pursue its aggressive \r\npractices and persevere on that path? \r\n We believe that, today more than ever, the \r\ninternational community must take concrete measures \r\nto deal with Israel’s horrific actions and compel it to \r\nput an end to its aggressive practices, halt its \r\nsettlement construction, lift the blockade against the \r\nPalestinian people in the Gaza Strip, end to its \r\noccupation of the occupied Arab territories, and \r\nwithdraw to the borders of 4 June 1967.  \r\n Mr. Benítez Versón (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nCuba fully supports and will vote in favour of the draft \r\nresolutions (A/65/L.18 and A/65/L.19) introduced by \r\nthe representative of Egypt.  \r\n The unstable situation in the Middle East — \r\ncharacterized by the expansion of Israeli settlements in \r\nthe West Bank, the ongoing construction of the \r\nseparation wall in the occupied Palestinian territory, \r\nthe complex situation in Lebanon and the occupation of \r\nthe Syrian Golan, inter alia — is a reality that affects \r\nnot only the region but the entire international \r\ncommunity. \r\n Israel’s disregard for international law and its \r\nongoing illegal occupation of Palestinian territories and \r\nother Arab territories remain the primary obstacles to \r\nachieving a just, lasting and comprehensive peace in \r\nthe region. Cuba reiterates its grave concern over the \r\nfurther deterioration of the situation in the occupied \r\nPalestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, \r\nparticularly as a result of Israel’s excessive use of force \r\nagainst the Palestinian civilian population and its many \r\nother illegal policies and practices, such as the \r\ninhumane and destructive measures of collective \r\npunishment against the civilian Palestinian population, \r\nincluding the blockade of Gaza. \r\n Cuba reiterates its appeal to the international \r\ncommunity to compel the Israeli authorities \r\nimmediately to lift the cruel and illegal blockade of the \r\nPalestinian people in the Gaza Strip, open the border \r\ncrossings and allow the free circulation of goods from \r\nand into the Gaza Strip. Humanitarian access must be \r\nguaranteed on a regular basis and in compliance with \r\nlegal obligations pursuant to the Fourth Geneva \r\nConvention and relevant United Nations resolutions. \r\n Cuba reiterates its deep regret over the \r\nPalestinian people’s ongoing suffering during the more \r\nthan 40 years of brutal Israeli military occupation of \r\ntheir land, and due to the continued denial of their \r\nfundamental human rights, including the right to self-\r\ndetermination and the right of the Palestinian refugees \r\nto return to their land. \r\n The international community’s efforts, including \r\nUnited Nations actions to continue the peace \r\nnegotiations for a just, peaceful and lasting solution to \r\nthe Palestinian question, remain unsuccessful. The \r\nIsraeli authorities — in clear rejection of international \r\nlaw and open disregard for the resolutions of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, the Human Rights Council and the \r\nSecurity Council — have pursued their aggressive \r\npolicies in the region. We call for the immediate \r\ncessation of Israeli settlement activities in the occupied \r\nPalestinian territories, including in East Jerusalem. \r\nEnding these practices is an absolute prerequisite for \r\nachieving a peace agreement. \r\n Cuba reaffirms that any measures or actions taken \r\nor to be taken by Israel, the occupying Power, in an \r\nattempt to alter the legal, physical or demographic \r\nstatus or the institutional structure of the occupied \r\nSyrian Golan, as well as measures to apply its \r\njurisdiction and administration there, are null and void \r\nand without legal effect.  \r\n We reiterate that all these measures and actions, \r\nincluding the construction and extension of Israeli \r\nsettlements in the Syrian Golan since 1967, are clear \r\nviolations of international law, international \r\nagreements and the resolutions and Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations. Cuba calls on Israel to abide by \r\nSecurity Council resolution 497 (1981) and to \r\nwithdraw fully from the occupied Syrian Golan to the \r\nborders existing prior to 4 June 1967. \r\n Cuba reaffirms its support for the Middle East \r\npeace process on the basis of the Arab Peace Initiative \r\nand the Road Map and the formula of land for peace. \r\nWe reject attempts to modify the mandate of the peace \r\nprocess, as well as unilateral Israeli measures and \r\nstrategies aimed at imposing an illegal unilateral \r\nsolution. \r\n The Palestinian people have the inalienable right \r\nto establish an independent and sovereign State with \r\n A/65/PV.55\r\n \r\n7 10-66016 \r\n \r\nEast Jerusalem as its capital. We demand the \r\nunconditional return of all Arab territory occupied in \r\nJune 1967. That is the only way to achieve a just and \r\nlasting peace for all the peoples of the region. \r\n Mr. AlJarallah (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): At \r\nthe outset, my delegation would like to express its \r\nappreciation for Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s \r\nsincere efforts to revive the peace process in the \r\nMiddle East. We were grateful for yesterday’s \r\nopportunity to reaffirm our support and solidarity for \r\nour Palestinian brothers during the commemoration of \r\nthe International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian \r\nPeople. \r\n The Middle East continues to suffer from \r\ninstability owing to the occupation of Arab land by \r\nIsrael and its actions against Palestinians, including \r\nkilling and displacement, which is dragging the region \r\ninto conflict and war. Our debate here is the result of \r\nIsrael’s continuing disregard for the will of the \r\ninternational community, its resolutions and various \r\ninternational efforts, including the Arab Peace \r\nInitiative of 2002, that are aimed at achieving a just \r\npeace and real security and stability in the region. \r\nFurthermore, as set out by President Barack Obama in \r\nhis statement to this session of the General Assembly \r\n(see A/65/PV.11), the United States has called for \r\ndirect negotiations between the Palestinian Authority \r\nand Israel for one year, leading to an end to much of \r\nthe Arab-Israeli conflict through the declaration of a \r\nfully sovereign Palestinian State. \r\n Israel’s actions and its violations of the rights of \r\nthe besieged Palestinian people in Gaza, whom they \r\nprevent from getting the basic resources needed to \r\nsustain life and to whom they refuse all humanitarian \r\nassistance, are further evidence of Israel’s continuing \r\nviolation of international laws and norms and \r\nhumanitarian principles. The situation in the occupied \r\nPalestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, is at a \r\ndangerous stage and will pose a threat to international \r\npeace and security if we cannot arrive at a just solution \r\nbased on the implementation of the relevant Security \r\nCouncil resolutions — in particular resolutions 242 \r\n(1967), 338 (1973), 1397 (2002), 1515 (2003) and \r\n1860 (2009) — and the land-for-peace formula. \r\n In the same vein, with regard to the \r\nimplementation of Security Council resolution 497 \r\n(1981), my country calls on Israel to withdraw from \r\nthe occupied Syrian Golan and to return to the 4 June \r\n1967 line. We reiterate that Israel’s occupation of parts \r\nof sisterly Syria is a serious obstacle to achieving \r\npeace and security in the Middle East. The State of \r\nKuwait also renews its commitment to stand by \r\nLebanon and to support its efforts to safeguard its \r\nstability and security. We call on Israel to cease its \r\nconstant violations of Lebanese land and air space, \r\nimplement Security Council resolution 1701 (2006) \r\nand withdraw completely from occupied Lebanese \r\nterritory. \r\n International efforts are continuing to find a \r\nsolution to the Arab-Israeli conflict and achieve peace \r\nand security in the Middle East. Yet Israel’s continued \r\nprevarication and intransigence continue to impede \r\nthose efforts, including efforts by the United States to \r\nrestart negotiations between Palestine and Israel, by \r\ninsisting on extremist policies that defy the will of the \r\ninternational community. Its most recent such action \r\nwas the decision to resume building illegal settlements \r\nin occupied Palestine. \r\n Efforts by various Israeli Governments to \r\ndisassociate themselves from peace negotiations with \r\nArab countries have created a sense of frustration and \r\npessimism in every country of the world. The \r\ninternational community faces a great challenge today, \r\nnamely, compelling Israel to implement the relevant \r\ninternational resolutions, cease its illegal settlement \r\nactivity on Palestinian territory and move forward with \r\nthe peace process in order to reach an agreement that \r\nprovides for the establishment of an independent \r\nPalestinian State and for Israel’s complete withdrawal \r\nfrom all occupied Arab territories. \r\n Mr. Almansoor (Bahrain) (spoke in Arabic): My \r\ndelegation would like to thank the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of the sisterly country of Egypt for \r\nintroducing the two draft resolutions before the \r\nAssembly, on Jerusalem (A/65/L.18) and the occupied \r\nSyrian Golan (A/65/L.19). \r\n As a result of Israel’s illegal occupation of Arab \r\nterritory since 1967, year in and year out since the \r\ntwenty-fifth session, in 1970, the General Assembly \r\nhas considered an agenda item on the situation in the \r\nMiddle East. During every session since, the Assembly \r\nhas called on Israel to end its occupation of Arab land \r\nand accept the will of the international community by \r\nimplementing the relevant international laws and \r\nUnited Nations resolutions. \r\nA/65/PV.55  \r\n \r\n10-66016 8 \r\n \r\n The Middle East is at a very dangerous \r\ncrossroads and faces considerable challenges. A \r\ncomprehensive and just peace is still unattainable \r\nowing to Israel’s intransigence in dealing with the \r\npeaceful route that Arabs have embraced; but it has \r\nnevertheless become an urgent requirement for \r\nmaintaining international peace and security. \r\nNevertheless, Israel still treats this option with \r\ncontempt, believing that such behaviour will gain it \r\nmore power and more time. \r\n Israel’s continued building of settlements makes \r\nthe situation even worse. It recently announced its \r\ndecision to build 1,360 new housing units in East \r\nJerusalem — a decision that runs counter to numerous \r\nUnited Nations resolutions condemning the building of \r\nsettlements in the occupied territories and emphasizing \r\nthe invalidity of acquiring or annexing land by force, \r\nincluding Security Council resolutions 446 (1979), 476 \r\n(1980) and 478 (1980). These flagrant practices run \r\ncounter to article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention \r\nand article 55 of The Hague Regulations concerning \r\nthe Laws and Customs of War on Land. They also \r\nillustrate Israel’s disregard for the peace process, \r\nwhose resumption we all hope for in order to achieve a \r\nnegotiated settlement on the basis of two States living \r\nside by side within the pre-1967 borders. \r\n There is no doubt that the Israeli Government is \r\ncontinuing with its intransigent positions and \r\nprovocations, which are more evident when new \r\nnegotiations loom on the horizon. All of those actions \r\nreflect the fact that Israel is not seriously committed to \r\nachieving a just and permanent solution to the question \r\nof Palestine, which remains the crux of the Arab-Israeli \r\nconflict. \r\n Given Israel’s position, the General Assembly is \r\ncalled upon today to provide the necessary support for \r\nthe Middle East political process in order to revive \r\npeace negotiations. More than ever before, the \r\nAssembly is also called upon to exercise its cardinal \r\nprinciples in support of the peace process and to force \r\nIsrael to honour its international commitments with a \r\nview to achieving a just, comprehensive and permanent \r\nsolution to all aspects of the Arab-Israeli conflict on all \r\ntracks on the basis of Security Council and General \r\nAssembly resolutions and in conformity with the Arab \r\nPeace Initiative, the principle of land for peace, the \r\nRoad Map and other relevant international decisions. \r\n At each of its sessions, the General Assembly has \r\ncalled upon Israel, the occupying Power, to end its \r\noccupation of Arab territories. The Assembly has also \r\nemphasized that the measures taken by Israel in the \r\nWest Bank, particularly in occupied Jerusalem, as well \r\nas in the occupied Syrian Golan, are illegal, and thus \r\nnull and void. The resolutions adopted annually by the \r\nAssembly as well as the Security Council’s own \r\nresolutions — in particular resolution 478 (1980), on \r\noccupied Jerusalem, and resolution 497 (1981), on the \r\noccupied Syrian Golan — all focus on the impact of \r\nIsrael’s illegal action. Those two Security Council \r\nresolutions also rejected Israel’s unilateral decisions to \r\nannex Jerusalem and the Golan, determining that such \r\ndecisions were null and void and lacking international \r\nlegal basis. \r\n It is clear that the illegal settlement policy \r\npursued by Israel in the occupied Palestinian \r\nterritories, including East Jerusalem, which is based on \r\nthe pretext of natural growth, is both unwarranted and \r\nunjustifiable and runs counter to international law and \r\nUnited Nations resolutions.  \r\n It is absolutely clear that Israel’s policies — \r\nwhich include blockading the Palestinian people, \r\nstorming places of worship, collective punishment, the \r\nscorched earth policy and the construction of the racist \r\nseparation wall — constitute flagrant violations of \r\ninternational law. They complicate the situation on the \r\nground while at the same time revealing an attempt to \r\nimpose a fait accompli in order to improve Israel’s \r\nposition in any future negotiations on a final settlement \r\nof the conflict. Moreover, those policies risk \r\nhampering negotiations towards the comprehensive, \r\njust and lasting peace to which we all aspire.  \r\n In order for just, comprehensive and lasting peace \r\nto prevail in the Middle East, the Kingdom of Bahrain \r\nonce again calls on Israel to withdraw completely from \r\nthe occupied Syrian Golan to the border of 4 June \r\n1967, in implementation of Security Council resolution \r\n497 (1981), which asserts the illegality of Israel’s \r\nimposition of its laws and settlements there. Israel’s \r\ncontinued occupation of Syrian Arab territory \r\nconstitutes a genuine obstacle to the achievement of \r\npeace in the Middle East. \r\n With regard to Lebanon, the Kingdom of Bahrain \r\ncalls upon Israel to halt its continued violations of \r\nLebanon’s land and air space and to implement \r\nSecurity Council resolution 1701 (2006) and fully \r\n A/65/PV.55\r\n \r\n9 10-66016 \r\n \r\nwithdraw from the occupied Lebanese territory in \r\nSheba’a farms and Al-Ghajar village. Bahrain \r\nemphasizes the need to preserve Lebanon’s unity, \r\nterritorial integrity and political independence.  \r\n We call upon the international community and the \r\nQuartet to make every diplomatic effort to give new \r\nimpetus to the peace process in order to achieve a just, \r\ncomprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East. \r\n Mr. Cabactulan (Philippines): At the outset, the \r\nPhilippines commends you, Mr. President, for giving \r\npriority to the discussion on the situation in the Middle \r\nEast. In our highly interdependent world, the situation \r\nin the Middle East cannot be overlooked, even by \r\ngeographically distant countries like mine. As a major \r\nsource of oil and a big market for services for many \r\ncountries, including the Philippines, the stability and \r\nprogress of the Middle East is essential for world peace \r\nand security. More than 2 million of my country’s men \r\nand women live and work in the Middle East. The \r\nPhilippine Government therefore attaches great \r\nimportance to the security and safety of every Filipino \r\ncitizen in that region. \r\n The Philippines is a strong advocate and \r\nsupporter of the Middle East peace process, and we \r\naim to contribute in any way we can. The Philippines \r\nhas always supported the establishment of a free and \r\nindependent Palestinian State. The Philippines has for \r\nmany years joined the global clamour for the \r\nestablishment of a Palestinian homeland to help \r\nalleviate the dire situation of the Palestinian people. In \r\nthat regard, the Philippines sees merit in the two-State \r\nsolution for peace proposed by our partners. We hope \r\nthat both Israel and Palestine will join hands to achieve \r\na meaningful, long-lasting and durable solution to the \r\nproblem. \r\n The Philippines is cognizant of the fact that \r\nbringing stability and long-lasting peace to the Middle \r\nEast is easier said than done. Despite huge investments \r\nin energy, time and resources, a solution to the Middle \r\nEast problem remains elusive. Past failures, however, \r\nshould be seen as the foundation for future success. We \r\nshould not halt our quest to find the right solution to \r\nthe predicaments that plague the region. \r\n One concrete measure in laying a solid \r\nfoundation for peace and stability in the region would \r\nbe the creation of a Middle East zone free of nuclear \r\nweapons and other weapons of mass destruction. It \r\nmay be recalled that a proposal was agreed upon at the \r\n1995 Review and Extension Conference of the Parties \r\nto the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \r\nWeapons (NPT) via the 1995 resolution on the Middle \r\nEast. That proposals was recently reaffirmed by the \r\n2010 NPT Review Conference, specifically in part IV \r\nof the section on conclusions and recommendations for \r\nfollow-on actions of the Final Document \r\n(NPT/CONF.2010/50 (Vol. I)), entitled “The Middle \r\nEast, particularly implementation of the 1995 \r\nresolution on the Middle East”.  \r\n The Philippines views the outcome of the 2010 \r\nNPT Review Conference as a significant contribution \r\nto the Middle East peace process. In that context, I \r\nwish to highlight some of the vital elements agreed \r\nupon that need urgent attention and action. First, we \r\nmust convene an international conference in 2012 on \r\nthe establishment of a Middle East zone free of nuclear \r\nweapons and other weapons of mass destruction. \r\nSecondly, we must appoint a facilitator with a full \r\nmandate to support the implementation of the 1995 \r\nresolution by conducting consultations with States in \r\nthe region and making preparations for the 2012 \r\nconference. Thirdly, we must designate a host \r\nGovernment for the 2012 conference. Lastly, the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency and the \r\nOrganization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons \r\nshould play a key role in the preparations for the 2012 \r\nconference. \r\n The Secretary-General and the three depositary \r\nStates of the NPT should be moving with dispatch to \r\nimplement the actions expected of them in last May’s \r\nNPT Review Conference Final Document, with \r\nspecific reference to the 1995 resolution on the Middle \r\nEast. The year 2012 is fast approaching.  \r\n The other part of the foundation rests on the \r\ncommitment of the countries in the region to respect \r\neach other’s rights to exist, to live free from the threat \r\nof destruction and annihilation and to live in peace \r\nwith their neighbours. Through these steps and other \r\nconfidence-building measures, we can start laying the \r\ngroundwork for the peaceful and stable Middle East \r\nthat all Member States desire. \r\n The steps that I have just enumerated present \r\nenormous challenges. But I am afraid that, if \r\nsomething is not done quickly, the countries of the \r\nregion are bound to repeat a cycle of conflict and strife \r\nthat will eventually destabilize the whole world. What \r\nis needed is a change in thinking and attitude and the \r\nA/65/PV.55  \r\n \r\n10-66016 10 \r\n \r\ndevelopment of greater trust and understanding. Such \r\ntrust and confidence between erstwhile enemies will \r\nneed to be built patiently. Indeed, it will take time, \r\nenergy and resources, as well as goodwill and \r\ncommitment to sustainable peace. \r\n The 2012 conference is one such concrete step. It \r\npresents a rare chance to show the seriousness and \r\ngoodwill of stakeholders. I strongly encourage the \r\ncountries in the region and the three depositary States \r\nof the 1995 resolution on the Middle East to participate \r\nand strive to achieve a meaningful outcome. Not only \r\nis it important that they attend, but they must go to the \r\nconference with an open mind and heart. The \r\nconference will be a fresh start for all. Let us seize the \r\nopportunity. The 2012 conference could be an \r\nimportant step towards finding a viable solution to the \r\nsituation in the Middle East. \r\n Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): The international community is still focused \r\non the Middle East but, despite its efforts, the \r\nPalestinian-Israeli peace process is still stagnating. The \r\nsituation concerns us greatly.  \r\n This past year has demonstrated that if the \r\nchronic mutual distrust of the parties is not dealt with \r\nand if there is no clear understanding of the fact that \r\nthere is simply no alternative to strict compliance with \r\nthe international legal basis for a Middle East \r\nsettlement, then we will be faced with a situation in \r\nwhich hopes for peace in the region wither. As a \r\nmember of the Quartet of international mediators, the \r\nRussian Federation is actively trying to overcome the \r\ncurrent protracted pause in the Palestinian-Israeli \r\nnegotiations, which has had a negative impact on the \r\nregion and feeds the various radical and extremist \r\nforces that are not at all interested in a resumption of \r\nthe peace process. It is important that all parties \r\ndemonstrate restraint and not indulge in violence.  \r\n We cannot accept unilateral acts in advance of a \r\nsettlement. They cast a pall on the momentum for a \r\nresumption of the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations. It is \r\nperfectly clear that unilateral actions cancel out the \r\nefforts made by the international community to create a \r\nviable Palestinian State with territorial integrity and \r\nliving side by side in peace, security and cooperation \r\nwith the State of Israel. What we have to do is find a \r\nmutually acceptable formula that would allow for the \r\nresumption of direct talks and ensure that they proceed \r\nsuccessfully. A policy of fait accompli is not \r\nacceptable.  \r\n We categorically reject the settlement policy of \r\nIsrael. We believe that the acquisition of territory by \r\nforce is inadmissible. This is one of the fundamental \r\nprinciples of contemporary international relations. The \r\nkey to establishing the right climate for negotiations is \r\nan Israeli moratorium on settlements, without arbitrary \r\ntimeframes or geographical limits.  \r\n The overall situation becomes gloomier when we \r\nsee the flare-ups of tension around Gaza. We are \r\nconcerned by the frequent rocket attacks on southern \r\nIsrael. They cause civilian suffering and must end. On \r\nthe other hand, we also call for an urgent humanitarian \r\neffort to improve the social and economic situation of \r\nthe Palestinian people. More effort must be made to lift \r\nthe blockade on Gaza. The international community \r\nmust help the Palestinian leadership in its efforts to \r\nestablish security and order, reform its law \r\nenforcement structures and thwart all forms of \r\nterrorism. As a practical contribution in that direction, \r\nthe Russian Government decided to provide a  \r\n$10 million financial contribution in humanitarian \r\nassistance for the Palestinian National Authority. The \r\nquestion of Palestinian unity is also crucial. It is central \r\nto ensuring progress in the negotiations. The Russian \r\nFederation, together with regional partners, in \r\nparticular Egypt, is seeking to resolve this matter.  \r\n Overall, we welcome the Israeli decision to \r\nwithdraw troops from the northern part of the village of \r\nAl-Ghajar, and we look forward to them doing so. Yet, \r\nwe note that other steps are necessary to achieve a final \r\nsettlement. This is a difficult situation and the \r\ninternational community must be more involved. The \r\nQuartet can certainly be helpful, and it has proven its \r\nvalue. We also attach particular importance to \r\ninteraction between the Quartet and the League of Arab \r\nStates. We would like to confirm that our proposal for a \r\nMoscow conference on the Middle East still stands. If \r\nthe direct substantive talks between Palestinians and \r\nIsraelis become more sustainable, that would create the \r\nnecessary preconditions for convening the conference.  \r\n The international mediators and all interested \r\nparties must now urge the Israelis and Palestinians to \r\nresume dialogue as a way of achieving our common \r\ngoal of establishing an independent and viable \r\nPalestinian State with territorial integrity coexisting in \r\npeace and security with Israel. The international legal \r\n A/65/PV.55\r\n \r\n11 10-66016 \r\n \r\ngroundwork for that exists, namely, the numerous \r\nSecurity Council resolutions, the Madrid principles, the \r\nRoad Map and the Arab Peace Initiative. As Russian \r\nPresident Dmitry Medvedev said in his message to \r\nMahmoud Abbas, President of the Palestinian \r\nAuthority, on the occasion of the International Day of \r\nSolidarity with the Palestinian People, achieving that \r\ngoal would help to stabilize the region and promote \r\npeaceful coexistence and mutually beneficial \r\ncooperation among all countries and peoples. \r\n Mr. Andrabi (Pakistan): I wish to thank you, \r\nMr. President, for arranging this important meeting, \r\nwhich is the annual reaffirmation by the General \r\nAssembly of its commitment to the legitimate struggle \r\nand inalienable rights of the Palestinian people. This \r\nmeeting coincides with the International Day of \r\nSolidarity with the Palestinian People, which was \r\nobserved yesterday. The Day reminds us that the \r\npeaceful settlement of the question of Palestine has \r\nremained one of the major challenges for the \r\ninternational community for the past six decades.  \r\n As we are now into the seventh decade of our \r\ncollective failure to meet that challenge, prospects for a \r\nfinal settlement are still elusive. The collective voice of \r\npeace and compassion emanating from various quarters \r\nat the United Nations continues to be ignored. Such \r\nopen defiance of the international community \r\ndiminishes the prospects of peace and prolongs the \r\nsuffering of Palestinians living under occupation.  \r\n One institution in the United Nations that has \r\nheld aloft the cause of peace in the Middle East is the \r\nCommittee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of \r\nthe Palestinian People. Yesterday, we were briefed on \r\nits annual report (A/65/35). We greatly value the work \r\nof the Committee under the able leadership of the \r\nPermanent Representative of Senegal, Ambassador \r\nAbdou Salam Diallo. We also thank its Rapporteur, \r\nAmbassador Saviour Borg of Malta, for his invaluable \r\ncontributions. \r\n The resumption of direct negotiations between \r\nIsraelis and the Palestinians in September this year had \r\nrekindled hopes for all of us for sustainable peace in \r\nthe Middle East and a permanent political settlement of \r\nthe Israeli-Palestinian question. But I fear our hopes \r\nand optimism appear to be short-lived, as the window \r\nof opportunity for meaningful and sustained \r\nnegotiations is once again closing. \r\n Settlement activity by Israel in the occupied \r\nPalestinian territory is the major hurdle to a long-term \r\nsustainable political process. Settlement activity is a \r\nmajor provocation, violates international law, vitiates \r\nthe atmosphere conducive to negotiations and mutes \r\nvoices calling for peace and compassion. For us, the \r\nmost disquieting aspect of settlement activity is the \r\nongoing effort to remove traces of Palestinian heritage \r\nby altering the status of centuries-old mosques, \r\ncemeteries and churches. That effort is endemic in East \r\nJerusalem, Hebron and Bethlehem. It is being done in \r\nthe name of creating new housing spaces or \r\ncommissioning other types of buildings. East \r\nJerusalem is witnessing renewed settlement activity in \r\nthe neighbourhoods of Ramot and Pisgat Ze’ev.  \r\n Violence by the settlers against their Palestinian \r\nneighbours is a regrettable corollary of this activity. \r\nIsrael must stop this illegality. It must also end its \r\ncalculated ambiguity on settlements in the West Bank, \r\nwith a categorical renunciation of any new project. \r\nUntil Israel renounces the construction of new housing \r\nand commercial projects in occupied territory, \r\nsettlement activity will continue to derail the \r\nnegotiations and cast its ugly shadow on the peace \r\nprocess. \r\n Any meaningful and viable negotiating process \r\nmust run in parallel with improvements in the lives of \r\nthe Palestinian people. Millions of Palestinians in the \r\noccupied territories currently live under the shadow of \r\ncheckpoints, roadblocks, military siege and separation \r\nwalls. Recent measures taken by the Israeli authorities \r\nto ease restrictions on movement in the West Bank and \r\nimprove access to Gaza offer some hope. Such \r\nmeasures must be sustained by a deeper political \r\ncommitment to improving livelihoods in Palestine \r\nthrough respect for human rights, freedom of \r\nmovement and the unrestricted flow of trade. \r\n The delegation of Pakistan wishes to take this \r\nopportunity to call upon the international community to \r\nincrease its assistance to Palestinian authorities, \r\nespecially in connection with plans for building State \r\ninstitutions. Many independent studies, including the \r\nWorld Bank’s Economic Monitoring Report, have \r\npraised Palestinian authorities for their efforts in \r\ninstitution-building and the delivery of public services. \r\nThe World Bank and the International Monetary Fund \r\nhave projected an 8 per cent growth rate in the West \r\nBank and Gaza. The economic boom and \r\nentrepreneurship, both of which reflect the resilience of \r\nA/65/PV.55  \r\n \r\n10-66016 12 \r\n \r\nthe people of Palestine, can also be a solid edifice for \r\nPalestinian Statehood. It holds immense promise for \r\nlasting peace in the region and must be complemented \r\nby generous development assistance. \r\n We would also urge Member States to address the \r\nfinancial challenges faced by the United Nations Relief \r\nand Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near \r\nEast (UNRWA). Despite its financial constraints, \r\ncaused by unprecedented floods this year, Pakistan will \r\ncontinue to provide all possible support to UNRWA \r\nand the Palestinian Authority. \r\n The international community must act to rekindle \r\nthe hopes of peace through a meaningful negotiating \r\nprocess. As stated by the Permanent Representative of \r\nEgypt on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement, we \r\nmust remain united in our demand that Israel respect its \r\nlegal obligation as an occupying Power. We believe \r\nthat a lasting settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict \r\ncannot be achieved without addressing the root cause \r\nof Israeli occupation of Arab territory. The solution \r\ntherefore requires the complete withdrawal of Israel \r\nfrom the occupied Palestinian territories, including \r\nEast Jerusalem, and all other occupied Arab territories, \r\nincluding the Syrian Golan and South Lebanon. \r\n We also look forward to a substantive and \r\nobjective investigation by the Secretary-General’s \r\nPanel of Inquiry on the freedom flotilla incident of \r\n31 May. The Panel must diligently pursue the matter. \r\nJustice must prevail and those affected must be duly \r\ncompensated. \r\n Pakistan shares the collective objective of the \r\ninternational community for an independent, sovereign \r\nand viable State of Palestine, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif \r\nas its capital, living side by side and in peace with all \r\nits neighbours. We support lasting peace for all the \r\ninhabitants of the Middle East, irrespective of religion, \r\nethnicity or nationality. Peace has eluded the region for \r\nfar too long. Peace cannot elude the region forever. \r\n Mr. Seger (Switzerland) (spoke in French): \r\nSwitzerland wishes to speak on several items — first, \r\nwith regard to the peace process. \r\n The continuation of settlement activity in the \r\noccupied Palestinian territory, including East \r\nJerusalem, violates international law and undermines \r\nthe peace negotiations. We once again call upon Israel \r\nto immediately cease all illegal activities and to \r\ncomply with its international obligations. Negotiations \r\nmust be promptly resumed so that priority can be given \r\nto identifying mutually acceptable arrangements on \r\nborders and security. The Geneva initiative offers \r\nsolutions in those two areas that fully respect the \r\ninterests of Israel and a Palestinian State, which we \r\nonce again call for. \r\n Secondly, with regard to inter-Palestinian \r\nreconciliation, restoring Palestinian unity is essential \r\nfor the completion of the peace process and the \r\nreconstruction of Gaza. Switzerland calls on the parties \r\nconcerned to redouble their efforts to rapidly reach a \r\nreconciliation agreement. Establishing an electoral \r\ntimetable must be at the heart of such an agreement. \r\n Thirdly, with regard to Israel’s restrictions on the \r\nmovement of goods and people in the occupied \r\nPalestinian territory, the restrictions in Gaza are clearly \r\ndisproportionate to the military advantage sought. They \r\nare therefore illegal. There are other solutions for \r\npreserving the security interests of Israel.  \r\n It is also imperative that economic and \r\ncommercial exchanges and the movement of people \r\nbetween Gaza and the West Bank, including East \r\nJerusalem, be restored and that the private sector in \r\nGaza be able to export to foreign markets. In that \r\ncontext, we note with interest the recent Israeli \r\nannouncement that it will soon allow regular exports of \r\ngoods from Gaza. All stakeholders concerned must \r\nwork to implement Security Council resolution 1860 \r\n(2009) as soon as possible.  \r\n To help improve the situation, in June we \r\nproposed an access regime that meets both the needs of \r\nthe civilian population in Gaza and the security needs \r\nof Israel. This proposed regime can be adapted for \r\naccess by sea. \r\n To continue denying or tolerating this \r\nunacceptable policy of restrictions, whose negative \r\neffects in political, security and humanitarian terms are \r\nglaring, is not a viable option. The continuous \r\ndeterioration of the situation in Gaza can only \r\nexacerbate the risk of escalating violence and serious \r\nviolations of international humanitarian law. \r\n Finally, Switzerland wishes to express its concern \r\nover the rising tension in Lebanon. It believes that the \r\ninterests of justice and stability can be harmonized and \r\ncalls on the stakeholders to exercise restraint. Each \r\nvictim has a right to justice; impunity is not an option. \r\n A/65/PV.55\r\n \r\n13 10-66016 \r\n \r\n The Special Tribunal for Lebanon contributes to \r\nthat objective. It is, however, important to emphasize \r\nthat the presumption of innocence applies to each \r\ndefendant as long as he or she has not been found \r\nguilty. \r\n Mr. Al-Nasser (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I would like to express my thanks to you, \r\nMr. President, for convening meetings on this agenda \r\nitem, namely, the situation in the Middle East, \r\nincluding the question of Palestine. \r\n Despite serious efforts on the part of the \r\ninternational community, including the international \r\nQuartet and other supportive States, which have sought \r\nto press ahead with the peace process and gave rise \r\ninitially to indirect negotiations and later to the \r\nlaunching of direct negotiations between the Israelis \r\nand the Palestinians, the intransigence of the Israeli \r\nside, Israel’s persistence in constructing settlements \r\nand its disregard for international appeals to stop the \r\nconstruction of settlements, at least as a goodwill \r\ngesture to boost the negotiating process, have \r\nfrustrated all efforts and no tangible achievements have \r\nbeen arrived at thus far. \r\n The Arab States have demonstrated their serious \r\ndesire for peace and have provided an atmosphere \r\nconducive to peace negotiations, but that will not \r\ncontinue ad infinitum.  \r\n It is quite clear that Israel’s military occupation is \r\nthe main reason for the problem, although it will not \r\nprovide security for Israel. On the contrary, it is the \r\nworst violation of human rights against a defenceless \r\nand persecuted people and is being used as a pretext to \r\ncombat violence and terrorism, but, in fact, it is one of \r\nthe reasons for terrorism.  \r\n The pretext of using excessive military force in \r\nthe name of ensuring the security of Israel is false and \r\npointless, as the struggle of people for liberation from \r\nforeign occupation is a legitimate right and cannot be \r\nequated with military aggression by the occupier. The \r\nIsraeli authorities persist in perpetrating numerous \r\nhuman rights violations against the Arab population \r\ninside the so-called Green Line and continue their \r\nchallenges to and defiance of the international \r\nconsensus by expanding the illegal settlements with a \r\nview to annexing de facto more Palestinian territory. \r\n That constitutes a blow to international mediation \r\nefforts, particularly those on the part of the Quartet. \r\nThe State of Qatar believes that solving the question of \r\nPalestine should be through a two-State solution, with \r\nthe two States living side by side in peace. Qatar is of \r\nthe view that Israeli Government attempts to expand \r\nsettlements, particularly around East Jerusalem, thwart \r\nthe achievement of a two-State solution on the basis of \r\nthe 1967 borders. \r\n The settlements in East Jerusalem threaten the \r\ncontiguity of the Palestinian land, a main pillar of the \r\nestablishment of the Palestinian State. The Israeli \r\nGovernment has tried to justify the expansion of \r\nsettlements by referring to the so-called natural growth \r\nof settlements. We completely reject that concept. \r\nSettlement activity is illegal and the so-called growth \r\nis not natural. \r\n Israeli public policy encourages settlements in the \r\noccupied Palestinian territory, particularly in East \r\nJerusalem, through Government bonuses and incentives \r\nto encourage the transfer of Israeli civilians to \r\nPalestinian territory, in contradiction to international \r\nlaw. \r\n We must also mention continued Israeli violations \r\nof Lebanese sovereignty and refer to Security Council \r\nresolution 1701 (2006), as well as to the Israeli \r\noccupation of Lebanese territory and the Syrian Golan. \r\nWe would like to reassert the invalidity of Israel’s \r\ndecision to annex the Golan and the need to return it to \r\nSyria, as well as to return the remaining Lebanese \r\nterritories to Lebanon. \r\n We also wish to re-emphasize the need for a \r\ncomplete Israeli pull-out from the occupied Syrian \r\nGolan to the 4 June 1967 borders. The international \r\ncommunity has to impose steady pressure on Israel so \r\nas to ensure respect for Security Council resolution 497 \r\n(1981), which rejects Israel’s decision to annex the \r\nSyrian Golan and considers it null and void. Three \r\ndecades later, that resolution is still awaiting its \r\nimplementation by Israel. \r\n In that connection, I would like to refer to the \r\ndecision taken by the Council of the League of Arab \r\nStates entitled “Occupied Syrian Arab Golan”, adopted \r\nat the Arab Summit at Doha on 30 March 2009. It \r\nemphasizes the need to return the occupied Syrian \r\nGolan to Syria for the sake of achieving a lasting and \r\ncomprehensive peace in the Middle East. \r\n For stability to prevail in Lebanon, Security \r\nCouncil resolution 1701 (2006) must be respected and \r\nA/65/PV.55  \r\n \r\n10-66016 14 \r\n \r\nimplemented by all parties, with no discrimination or \r\nselectivity. Constant Israeli flights over Lebanon \r\nconstitute the most significant violations of that \r\nresolution, in addition to its continued occupation of \r\nthe Shebaa Farms and the Al-Ghajar village. \r\n That threatens the credibility of the United \r\nNations Interim Force in Lebanon, as well as the \r\nability of the Lebanese Government to extend its \r\nsovereignty over its territory. On the other hand, in \r\norder to guarantee the establishment of peace, security \r\nand stability, we emphasize the need to make the \r\nMiddle East a zone free of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction, without exception.  \r\n We would like to emphasize our categorical \r\nrejection of the illegal measures taken by Israel in \r\noccupied East Jerusalem and its attempts to alter the \r\nArab identity of the city, its demographics, its legal \r\nstatus and its religious character. All these attempts are \r\nnull and void and have no legal effect.  \r\n The international community is duty-bound to \r\nexpress its rejection of the Israeli Government’s \r\nattempts to adversely affect Christian and Islamic holy \r\nsites, to demolish homes and evict the Arab population, \r\nand to confiscate their identification papers with a view \r\nto Judaizing the city. Those attempts run counter to \r\nIsrael’s obligations as the occupying Power under \r\ninternational law and run counter to relevant United \r\nNations resolutions, and threaten any chance of a \r\npeaceful solution to the question of Palestine and the \r\nArab-Israeli conflict. In addition, they torpedo \r\ninternational efforts carried out by the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations. \r\n The achievement of a just, lasting and \r\ncomprehensive peace in the Middle East region can \r\nonly be based on the principle of land for peace, the \r\nterms of reference represented in relevant United \r\nNations resolutions and the Arab Peace Initiative. \r\n Therefore, the Israeli Government has to refrain \r\nfrom taking extremist positions and from exploiting the \r\nArab side’s sincere intention to find a way to end the \r\nMiddle East crisis. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to emphasize the need \r\nto involve all factions of the Palestinian people in \r\nefforts to bring about the success of peace efforts. Our \r\nPalestinian brothers have to try seriously to foster \r\nnational unity in a manner that serves the interests of \r\nthe Palestinian people while safeguarding the \r\ngeographic and political unity of the Palestinian land. \r\nWe wish to address proud expressions of our esteem to \r\nour Palestinian brothers for their steadfast stand against \r\noccupation, injustice and persecution. \r\n Mr. Apakan (Turkey): We are once again at a \r\npivotal moment in the Middle East. There are two \r\npaths ahead. One is towards a bright future, the other \r\ntowards more of the same. Much will depend on which \r\npath is taken. History will not judge lightly those who \r\npay lip service to peace but act to perpetuate conflict. \r\n Turkey welcomed the resumption of direct \r\nnegotiations between Israel and the Palestinian \r\nAuthority back in September. Since then, we have been \r\ndeeply concerned that no tangible progress has been \r\npossible. Turkey continues to support efforts to ensure \r\na resumption of the direct negotiations. We are \r\ncognizant of the inherent difficulties, but too much \r\ntime, energy and political capital have been invested in \r\nthat process to let it fail now. \r\n On the other hand, negotiations cannot \r\nrealistically continue in good faith as long as the \r\nrampant illegal settlement activity continues \r\nunchecked, potentially undermining the whole notion \r\nof a two-State solution. Turkey, like countless other \r\nnations, calls on Israel to adhere to its Road Map \r\nobligations and cease and desist from all settlement \r\nactivity, including in East Jerusalem. The patience and \r\nthe will of the international community on that score \r\nshould not be tested. Ultimately, there will have to be \r\nconsequences. The Security Council and the Quartet \r\ncannot remain silent forever. \r\n At this point, let me underline that the status of \r\nJerusalem is one of the core issues of the peace \r\nprocess, along with borders and refugees, and is \r\nsubject to final status negotiations. We therefore \r\nreiterate the importance of preserving the status as well \r\nas the social, cultural and religious fabric of Jerusalem \r\nand call on Israel to refrain from any provocative acts \r\nin the city. \r\n On the other hand, the unlawful blockade on \r\nGaza has to end. The relevant Security Council \r\nresolutions must be implemented without delay. How \r\ncan we effectively combat the spread of extremism in \r\nthe Middle East while the unjust and inhumane \r\ncollective punishment of a civilian population \r\ncontinues in Gaza? The Security Council has stated \r\nclearly that the situation in Gaza is unsustainable, and \r\nyet it continues. Like the settlement issue, that \r\n A/65/PV.55\r\n \r\n15 10-66016 \r\n \r\ncontinuation raises issues of credibility for the \r\ninternational community and the United Nations. \r\n With the hope that direct negotiations, once \r\nresumed, can make rapid progress, it is also important \r\nto continue to uphold the basic framework for peace, as \r\nembodied in the relevant Security Council resolutions, \r\nthe Madrid terms of reference, the Arab Peace \r\nInitiative and the Road Map obligations. It is clear that \r\nthere is an international consensus on those \r\nfundamental parameters: a comprehensive peace based \r\non two States — Israel and an independent, democratic \r\nand viable Palestinian State — living side by side in \r\npeace and security, with agreed borders based on those \r\nof 1967, Jerusalem as the capital of both States and a \r\njust settlement for refugees. The reaffirmation of those \r\nelements will serve to bring about a timely solution \r\nthat addresses the concerns of all. \r\n On the other hand, all the issues in the region are \r\ninterlinked, and that is why a comprehensive peace is \r\nnecessary in order to ensure that stability prevails in \r\nthe region. Therefore, meaningful progress on the \r\nSyrian and Lebanese tracks will be crucial as well. In \r\nthat regard, we call for the full implementation of all \r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions. \r\n In order for there to be popular support for direct \r\nnegotiations and ultimately for the realization of a two-\r\nState solution, the conditions of occupation have to be \r\neased and a positive environment created on the \r\nground, one that allows for the State-building exercise \r\nin Palestine to make progress. \r\n We welcome the World Bank’s pronouncement \r\nthat, at the current pace and performance, the \r\nPalestinian Authority is well-positioned for the \r\nestablishment of a State at any point in the near future. \r\nIn order for the Palestinian Authority to become \r\neconomically viable, obstacles to private sector \r\ndevelopment and sustainable growth have to be lifted. \r\nPalestinians need to be able to use more of their land. \r\nThey also have to enjoy their fundamental rights and \r\nfreedoms. \r\n In short, as the basis for a State is rolled out, the \r\nmeasures of occupation must be rolled back. In the \r\nmeantime, the considerable progress already made by \r\nthe Palestinian Authority in State-building must \r\ncontinue to be supported by the international \r\ncommunity. \r\n Developments in Lebanon are also crucial to \r\npeace and security in the region. Turkey attaches great \r\nimportance to maintaining the political independence, \r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon, and we \r\nsupport the efforts of the Government. Turkey has been \r\nconcerned about rising tensions. As evidenced by \r\nPrime Minister Erdoğan’s visit to Lebanon last week, \r\nwe will continue to work to help promote calm.  \r\n The Special Tribunal for Lebanon is an \r\nindependent body established by the Council at the \r\nrequest of Lebanon. Its work is of a legal nature and \r\nshould not be used to further political agendas. The \r\nhard-won internal peace and stability in Lebanon and \r\nthe rule of law must be preserved and respected by all. \r\nTurkey will continue to play its part in a bilateral and \r\nregional context aimed at defusing existing tensions.  \r\n Six months have passed since Israel attacked an \r\ninternational humanitarian aid convoy on the high seas, \r\nkilling nine civilians and wounding many others. \r\nTurkey continues to cooperate fully with the Panel of \r\nInquiry established by the Secretary-General in \r\naccordance with the Security Council presidential \r\nstatement of 1 June 2010 (S/PRST/2010/9). After \r\nhaving received the Turkish interim report, the Panel \r\nsubmitted its first progress report to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in mid-September. However, four months after \r\nthe establishment of the Panel, Israel has yet to present \r\nits findings. Meanwhile, the International Independent \r\nFact-Finding Mission formed by the Human Rights \r\nCouncil has issued its report (A/HRC/15/21), which \r\ncontains alarming findings, compelling legal arguments \r\nand striking conclusions. We continue to expect Israel \r\nto live up to its responsibilities, acknowledge its \r\nmistakes and act accordingly. \r\n In conclusion, let me emphasize our conviction \r\nthat the Israeli-Palestinian conflict lies at the heart of \r\nall of the problems in the Middle East and that, as \r\nsuch, the current pause in direct negotiations between \r\nthe parties cannot last forever. There is no acceptable \r\nalternative to a just and comprehensive settlement. The \r\nstatus quo is not viable. The relative security that \r\nprevails cannot be taken for granted. Uncertainty \r\nbreeds instability, and time is running out. The people \r\nof the region need leadership, not brinksmanship. The \r\ntime to act is now. \r\n Mr. Hardeep Singh Puri (India): Please allow \r\nme, at the outset, to express our sincere appreciation \r\nfor the scheduling of this discussion on an important \r\nA/65/PV.55  \r\n \r\n10-66016 16 \r\n \r\nsubject that demands our collective attention — the \r\nsituation in West Asia, a region of great importance and \r\nconcern to the entire international community. \r\n Being part of our extended neighbourhood, the \r\nWest Asia region is of vital interest to India. The region \r\nis home to nearly 5 million Indians, and is an important \r\nsource for meeting India’s energy needs and a region \r\nwith which we have deep and intricate ties. \r\n We share the perception that the conflict in West \r\nAsia is essentially political in nature and cannot be \r\nresolved by force. In line with our support for Security \r\nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), India \r\nsupports a negotiated solution that results in a \r\nsovereign, independent, viable and united State of \r\nPalestine, living within secure and recognized borders, \r\nside by side with and at peace with Israel, as endorsed \r\nby the Quartet Road Map and Security Council \r\nresolutions 1397 (2002) and 1515 (2003). \r\n India has supported the Arab Peace Initiative, \r\nwhich calls for the withdrawal of Israel to pre-1967 \r\nborders, the recognition of Israel and the establishment \r\nof the State of Palestine with East Jerusalem as its \r\ncapital. India is aware that genuine peace in the region \r\nalso requires the resolution of other issues on the \r\nremaining tracks of the Middle East peace process, \r\nincluding the restoration of other Arab lands that \r\nremain under occupation. Progress on the Lebanese \r\nand Syrian tracks of the peace process is important for \r\nachieving comprehensive and durable peace in the \r\nregion. \r\n India welcomes the direct talks between Israel \r\nand Palestine and reiterates its full support for efforts \r\nto achieve a durable, comprehensive and just \r\nsettlement. We sincerely hope that the talks and \r\nnegotiations will lead to a comprehensive peace \r\nprocess for a final resolution of the Middle East \r\nconflict. \r\n Given the complexity of the task, unprecedented \r\ndetermination, goodwill and the capacity to offer and \r\naccept compromises and concessions are needed on all \r\nsides. We sincerely hope that wisdom will prevail and \r\nthat, in the resolution of conflicts and differences, \r\ndialogue will triumph over confrontation. \r\n Prince Zeid Ra’ad Zeid Al-Hussein (Jordan) \r\n(spoke in Arabic): While this meeting is being held, \r\ninternational efforts are being intensified to establish \r\nthe necessary environment for the resumption of direct \r\nnegotiations between Israelis and Palestinians with a \r\nview to reaching a two-State solution that includes an \r\nindependent State of Palestine with the 4 June 1967 \r\nborders and East Jerusalem as its capital, living in \r\npeace and security with the State of Israel. We in \r\nJordan support those efforts, and we call upon Israel to \r\nreciprocate, so that direct negotiations can resume at \r\nthe earliest possible date and deal with all final status \r\nissues, including Jerusalem, refugees, security and \r\nborders. That perspective necessitates the de facto \r\ncessation of all unilateral and condemned Israeli \r\nactions in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, \r\nparticularly the settlement activities carried out by two \r\nIsraeli organizations Ateret Cohanim and Elad, whose \r\nactivities constitute violations of the rules of \r\ninternational law and international humanitarian law \r\nand relevant United Nations resolutions, and violations \r\nof Israel’s obligations as the occupying Power. \r\n The international community should shoulder its \r\nresponsibility by compelling Israel to cease \r\nimmediately and once and for all of those violations \r\naimed at imposing faits accomplis, which have been \r\nrejected and threaten the chances for peace. Jordan \r\ncalls upon the international community to ensure that \r\nno irresponsible actions are taken that could undermine \r\nthe chances for resuming direct negotiations between \r\nthe two sides. \r\n The Arab and Islamic States, which constitute \r\nmore than one third of the membership of the United \r\nNations, have expressed their collective commitment to \r\nthe pursuit of peace by adhering to the Arab Peace \r\nInitiative, adopted at the Beirut summit conference in \r\n2002, which constitutes the basis for dealing with all \r\naspects of the Arab-Israeli conflict.  \r\n Today, we call upon everyone to take the historic \r\nopportunity provided by this initiative to end the \r\nconflict and establish a just and comprehensive peace \r\non the basis of two States, end the occupation of \r\nLebanese and Syrian territory and achieve international \r\nsecurity and stability for all countries and peoples of \r\nthe region.  \r\n The achievement of peace necessitates radical \r\nchange in the tragic situation in which the Palestinian \r\npeople have been living, especially in the Gaza Strip. \r\nWe call upon the international community to stand by \r\nthe Palestinian people and provide them with \r\nhumanitarian assistance, end their humanitarian \r\nsuffering and move immediately and effectively to \r\n A/65/PV.55\r\n \r\n17 10-66016 \r\n \r\nmake sure that Israel abides by resolution 1860 (2009) \r\nand lifts the blockade imposed on the Gaza Strip. We in \r\nJordan will spare no effort in continuing to provide all \r\nkinds of support to our Palestinian brothers or in \r\ndrawing attention to their deep suffering. \r\n Mr. Wang Min (China) (spoke in Chinese): The \r\nCommittee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of \r\nthe Palestinian People met yesterday to commemorate \r\nthe International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian \r\nPeople. China’s Premier Wen Jiabao sent a message to \r\nthe meeting in which he reiterated China’s firm support \r\nfor the people of Palestine in their just cause for \r\nnational independence.  \r\n At present, the situation in the Middle East \r\nremains complicated and volatile. The question of the \r\nMiddle East not only affects the overall situation of the \r\nregion, but also has a bearing on the peace and stability \r\nof the world.  \r\n The question of Palestine is the crux of the \r\nquestion of the Middle East. All peoples of the region, \r\nincluding the peoples of Palestine and Israel, are in \r\nfavour of efforts to achieve a political solution to the \r\nquestion of Palestine, which will contribute to lasting \r\npeace and stability in the Middle East region.  \r\n China has always firmly supported the \r\nPalestinians in their just cause to restore their \r\nlegitimate national rights and has always advocated for \r\nthe settlement of the differences between Palestine and \r\nIsrael through dialogue and negotiation and on the \r\nbasis of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations, \r\nthe principle of land for peace, the Arab Peace \r\nInitiative and the Road Map for peace in the Middle \r\nEast, with the ultimate purpose of creating an \r\nindependent State of Palestine, with Palestine and \r\nIsrael living in peace with each other.  \r\n In early September, direct talks were relaunched \r\nbetween Palestine and Israel, which offered a new and \r\nimportant opportunity for a political settlement of the \r\nquestion of Palestine. China had hoped that the talks \r\nwould be able to continue and yield substantive results \r\nat an early date. Regrettably, however, as a result of \r\nIsrael’s resettlement activities, the talks were brought \r\nto a complete standstill in less than a month, which has \r\ncaused widespread concern and anxiety in the \r\ninternational community.  \r\n The resumption of the talks will not come about \r\neasily. All the parties should treasure this opportunity \r\nin the overall interest of achieving peace, stability and \r\ndevelopment of the Middle East region. Constructive \r\nmeasures should be taken and interference avoided, so \r\nthat the talks can move forward without interruption. \r\nWe call upon Israel to cease immediately all its \r\nsettlement activities and the construction of the \r\nseparation wall on occupied Palestinian territory, \r\nincluding the West Bank and East Jerusalem. \r\n At present, the humanitarian situation in the \r\noccupied Palestinian territories remains grave and the \r\nplight of the Palestinian people continues to worsen. \r\nThat is neither conducive to regional stability nor \r\nconducive to creating the proper conditions for the \r\nresumption of talks between the Palestinians and the \r\nIsraelis. We hope that the parties concerned will \r\nimplement the relevant resolutions of the United \r\nNations in good faith and that the Israelis will \r\ncompletely lift the blockade of Gaza at an early date, \r\nso that the people of the Gaza Strip will regain the \r\nnecessary space for a normal and dignified existence, \r\nwith employment and development opportunities. The \r\ninternational community should continue to play close \r\nattention to the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip \r\nand provide more assistance and support to the \r\nPalestinian people.  \r\n China is concerned about the continued existence \r\nof internal division among Palestinians and hopes that \r\nthe Palestinian parties will place the overall interest of \r\ntheir people above anything else and settle their \r\ndifferences through dialogue and consultation, so as to \r\nachieve reconciliation and unity in a joint effort to \r\ncreate an independent State of Palestine and bring \r\npeace, stability and development to its people. \r\n The Syria and Lebanon tracks are important parts \r\nof the peace process in the Middle East. A \r\ncomprehensive settlement of the situation in the \r\nMiddle East is impossible without progress on those \r\ntwo tracks. China firmly supports Syria and Lebanon in \r\ntheir just cause to safeguard their national sovereignty, \r\nindependence and territorial integrity and recover their \r\noccupied territories. China supports the Arab States in \r\ntheir initiative aimed at achieving comprehensive and \r\nlasting peace in the region.  \r\n As a permanent member of the Security Council \r\nand a responsible major Power, China has contributed \r\npositively to the peace process in the Middle East by \r\nworking in its own way to promote peace and \r\nnegotiations, including by providing financial and \r\nA/65/PV.55  \r\n \r\n10-66016 18 \r\n \r\nhumanitarian assistance within its capacity. China \r\nappreciates the untiring efforts of the international \r\ncommunity over the years to bring about peace for the \r\nbenefit of Israel, the Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon \r\nand is ready to join other parties in working to bring \r\nabout a lasting, comprehensive and just peace in the \r\nMiddle East region at an early date. \r\n Mr. Quinlan (Australia): As we all know, the \r\nMiddle East has been subject to conflict for far too \r\nlong. For too long, the peoples of that region have been \r\nunable to lead their lives in anything that even vaguely \r\napproaches peace and security. That should be an \r\nunbearable judgment on all of us.  \r\n Any lasting peace, of course, can only be brought \r\nabout through peaceful means. A just and enduring \r\npeace between Israel and the Palestinians must be \r\npredicated on a two-State solution: a viable and secure \r\nState for the Palestinians and a secure State for Israel, \r\nwithin defined borders. To achieve that, a great deal \r\nmust be done, of course. There have already been \r\nunnecessary delays. Israel’s decision in September not \r\nto extend its settlement moratorium did not help the \r\npeace process. We are encouraged by reports that Israel \r\nis considering a further moratorium on settlement \r\nconstruction in the West Bank, and we urge it to do so. \r\nA freeze on settlement activity would unquestionably \r\nassist peace efforts. \r\n Australia’s own strong position remains that \r\nIsrael and the Palestinians need to meet their respective \r\nobligations under the Road Map. We commend the \r\nefforts by the United States in that regard. We urge all \r\nparties to begin negotiations as soon as possible and to \r\naddress final status issues, including the status of \r\nJerusalem and settlements. We call on all parties not to \r\nundertake any unilateral actions that seek to prejudge \r\nthe outcome of those negotiations. The positive \r\nengagement of the broader international community, \r\nincluding the Quartet members and the countries of the \r\nregion, is also essential. That is why Australia \r\nparticularly welcomed the Arab Peace Initiative as a \r\nvery constructive contribution towards a \r\ncomprehensive peace. \r\n At the same time, Australia unambiguously \r\nsupports Israel’s sovereign right to exist within secure \r\nand internationally recognized boundaries. We support \r\nIsrael’s right to self-defence, including in the face of \r\nHamas rocket attacks into southern Israel. Terrorism \r\nshould simply be condemned wherever it occurs. It is \r\nunfortunate that not everyone in this Hall always does \r\nso.  \r\n However, our support for the principle of self-\r\ndefence in no way alters our continuing, very \r\nfundamental concern about the humanitarian situation \r\nof the people of Gaza. While we recognize the steps \r\nthat Israel has taken recently to ease its restrictions on \r\ngoods entering Gaza, it must do more to help increase \r\nthe flow of necessary goods and supplies. We have \r\nspoken elsewhere of our concern that schools in Gaza \r\nhave not been able to open and that there are United \r\nNations organizations still facing difficulties in getting \r\ngoods into Gaza for their work. The situation in Gaza \r\nremains serious. It must be addressed. We again call on \r\nthe parties to act urgently to alleviate what is an \r\nunacceptable humanitarian situation.  \r\n We support those who are standing strongly \r\nagainst those who offer only the false hope of \r\nconfrontation, violence and terrorism. The continuing \r\nrejection by Hamas of the Quartet principles and its \r\nrefusal to recognize Israel are major obstacles to peace. \r\nWe call on Hamas to release Gilad Shalit \r\nunconditionally and without delay. \r\n One way Australia has been demonstrating its \r\ncommitment is through the development and \r\nhumanitarian assistance that we give to the Palestinian \r\nterritories — around $150 million in the past few \r\nyears. On the humanitarian side, a long-standing part \r\nof Australia’s contribution to peace has been through \r\nthe United Nations Relief and Works Agency, to which \r\nwe have provided around $90 million since 2001. The \r\nAustralian Foreign Minister will visit the region in the \r\ncoming weeks, and he will have more to say about \r\nAustralia’s ongoing strong support to the agency.  \r\n Briefly, with regard to Lebanon, we are \r\nconcerned at recent rhetoric. We remain firm in our \r\nsupport for the sovereignty, the political independence \r\nand the unity of the Lebanese State and its people. The \r\nindependence of the Special Tribunal for Lebanon as \r\nan international judicial instrument needs to be \r\nrespected. It should be allowed to complete its work. \r\nWe reiterate our call for Hizbullah to disarm in \r\naccordance with Security Council resolution 1559 \r\n(2004). We welcome Israel’s in-principle announcement to \r\nwithdraw from the northern part of Al-Ghajar. We call \r\nfor the full implementation of resolution 1701 (2006) \r\nby all sides. There must be an end to the smuggling of \r\narms.  \r\n A/65/PV.55\r\n \r\n19 10-66016 \r\n \r\n In conclusion, Australia — like all of us — \r\nrecognizes that the path towards peace will inevitably \r\nbe very hard. It will require strong political leadership \r\nand, above all, courage and vision. It is very easy to be \r\nglib when people speak of a historic opportunity. \r\nGlibness and cynicism unfortunately often make \r\nhistory, but they do not make progress. We have a \r\nchance now for progress. Compromise is essential on \r\nboth sides, as well as genuine, not ritualized, support \r\nfrom the broader international community.  \r\n When this item is debated again next year, my \r\ndelegation looks forward to there being two principal \r\nspeakers: the State of Israel and the State of Palestine. \r\nAs my Foreign Minister said here in the general debate \r\nthis year, all Member States should welcome the \r\nprospect of both an Israel and a Palestinian State at the \r\nsixty-sixth session of the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Khazaee (Islamic Republic of Iran): The \r\nnewly released reports on the question of Palestine, \r\nparticularly the report of the Committee on the \r\nExercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian \r\nPeople (A/65/35), once again bear witness to the \r\nunfortunate reality that, in the period under \r\nconsideration, the Israeli regime has continued with its \r\ncrimes against the defenceless Palestinian people and \r\nhas been systematically altering the Palestinian land \r\nthrough unlawful policies and practices. It is evident \r\nthat such a regime cannot be a righteous and trusted \r\npartner in negotiations for a peace agreement. \r\n The arrogant and occupying Powers have made \r\nuse of all their force, distortion and violence over the \r\npast decades in order to establish their control. They \r\nare trying to make the Middle East a platform for their \r\nexpansionist policies for other regions of the world. \r\nThey are not satisfied with anything less than bending \r\nthe region to their will. \r\n In that respect, I have to make it clear that in the \r\nhistory of the existence of the Zionist regime, there has \r\nbeen nothing but crimes: the killing of men, women \r\nand children in Palestine, the use of banned weapons \r\nand the stockpiling of nuclear weapons, indiscriminate \r\nassassinations, attacks on civilians and aid convoys in \r\ninternational waters, and war crimes in Lebanon and \r\nPalestine. All those ugly acts have become routine \r\naffairs for the occupying regime. \r\n The arrogant and occupying Powers have long \r\nattempted to create divisions in the Middle East region. \r\nThey want to divide peoples composed of varied \r\nreligions and denominations that have lived together in \r\nharmony and coexistence. They want to harm brotherly \r\nrelations among nations and peoples, such as the \r\nfriendly relations that so happily exist among the \r\nLebanese, Syrian, Iranian and other nations and \r\npeoples in the region. \r\n In Lebanon, we find that the sinful hand of \r\ntreachery assassinated the former Prime Minister, a \r\nrespected person, and then we see how news is \r\nfabricated to direct accusations at other respected \r\ngroups and leaders in an effort to sow seeds of division. \r\n Creating sectarian sensitivity and denominational \r\ntension and division is a well-known tactic. The \r\nenemies of humanity did not and do not want the \r\npeople of the region to be united, independent and \r\ndeveloped. However, the region’s nations know well \r\nthat the symbols of might are unity and solidarity. \r\n The only way to solve the Palestinian issue and \r\nestablish peace rooted in the region is to admit the \r\nsovereign right of Palestine and to end the occupation. \r\nThe Palestinian people should be allowed to freely \r\nexpress their opinions regarding their future. There is \r\nno doubt that the Palestinian people can exercise their \r\nnational sovereignty themselves. \r\n In November last year, the General Assembly \r\nadopted resolution 64/10 on the follow-up to the report \r\nof the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the \r\nGaza Conflict. But no concrete action has been taken \r\nto bring to justice the Israeli perpetrators of the crimes \r\nreported in the Goldstone report (A/HRC/12/48). \r\n The question remains, when and where impunity \r\nfor the criminals will end. The time has come for the \r\nUnited Nations to prove that it is an effective \r\norganization representing the will of the people of the \r\nworld. Rather than recognizing occupation, the United \r\nNations should recognize the legitimacy and right of \r\nthe Palestinian people to exercise their sovereignty and \r\nshould bring the criminals to justice. \r\n Those are prerequisites to lasting stability in the \r\nMiddle East. Trust and confidence, together with the \r\nactive engagement of the international community, is \r\nthe only way forward to peace. \r\n Mr. Kodama (Japan): Thank you very much, \r\nMr. President, for giving us the opportunity to address \r\nthe situation in the Middle East in the General \r\nAssembly. \r\nA/65/PV.55  \r\n \r\n10-66016 20 \r\n \r\n The United Nations has been addressing the \r\nsituation in the Middle East since the Organization was \r\nfounded. It is not easy, but we believe achieving peace \r\nbetween Israel and its neighbours is one of the most \r\nimportant challenges we face today. Japan is convinced \r\nthat progress towards a comprehensive peace in the \r\nMiddle East will ease tension in the region and \r\ncontribute to further prosperity. \r\n Japan supports a two-State solution in which \r\nIsrael and a future independent Palestinian State live \r\nside by side in peace and security. Japan remains \r\nconvinced that a two-State solution achieved through \r\nsincere negotiations is the only way to achieve durable \r\nlong-term peace. We strongly encourage both parties to \r\ncontinue the direct negotiations that started at the \r\nbeginning of September. We support the United States \r\nefforts to restart the negotiations. \r\n The two parties must abide by their obligations \r\nunder previous agreements, most importantly the Road \r\nMap. We call on Israel — as we have done on so many \r\nprevious occasions — to freeze its settlement activities \r\nin the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. We \r\nstrongly urge it to extend the settlement freeze. Any \r\nstep that could prejudice the final status negotiations \r\nshould not be taken.  \r\n At the same time, we call upon the Palestinian \r\nAuthority to continue its efforts to improve security \r\nand fulfil its commitment to cease violence and work \r\nagainst incitement. \r\n Japan strongly supports the State-building efforts \r\nof the Palestinian Authority under the leadership of \r\nPresident Abbas and Prime Minister Fayyad. During \r\nhis visit to Japan last week, Japanese leaders expressed \r\nto Prime Minister Fayyad our continued commitment \r\nto assist the Palestinians. We are providing \r\napproximately $100 million in assistance during the \r\ncurrent fiscal year. \r\n Japan will continue to advance the “corridor for \r\npeace and prosperity” initiative with a view to building \r\nan agro-industrial park in Jericho by the end of 2012. \r\nJapan is also considering working together with East \r\nAsian countries to assist Palestinian State-building \r\nefforts. \r\n Japan supports the vision that the borders under \r\nthe two-State solution should be defined through \r\nnegotiations and be based on the 1967 lines, with \r\nmutually agreed swaps, in a way that will achieve the \r\npeaceful coexistence of a viable Palestinian State and \r\nIsrael, both with secure and recognized borders. \r\n The final status of Jerusalem should be resolved \r\nthrough negotiations in a way that reconciles the \r\npositions of both parties on their future capital. Japan \r\nstresses that it will not recognize any act that may \r\nprejudge the final status of Jerusalem, including Israeli \r\nannexation of East Jerusalem. We express deep concern \r\nabout acts that change the existing conditions of East \r\nJerusalem, such as the demolition of Palestinian \r\nhouses. \r\n The Palestinian refugee issue should be resolved \r\nthrough negotiations between the parties concerned.  \r\n Japan appreciates and commends the activities of \r\nthe United Nations Relief and Works Agency for \r\nPalestinian Refugees in the Near East. Japan has \r\ndecided to make a contribution of $10 million, in \r\naddition to the regular contributions we have made so \r\nfar. \r\n With regard to the Gaza Strip, the measures taken \r\nby Israel to ease the blockade is a positive step, but \r\nJapan remains concerned about the humanitarian \r\nsituation there. We stress the importance of further \r\neasing the blockade while preventing the inflow of \r\nweapons into the Gaza Strip. \r\n Japan welcomes Israel’s easing of restrictions on \r\nmovement and access in the West Bank, which has \r\ncontributed to the development of the Palestinian \r\neconomy, and hopes that Israel will further ease such \r\nrestrictions. \r\n Japan has recently made clear its stance on peace \r\nin the Middle East, as I have just elaborated in a policy \r\npaper. In addition to the assistance we provide to the \r\nPalestinians, we have also invited promising Israeli and \r\nPalestinian youths to spend time together in Japan as \r\npart of a confidence-building measure. \r\n Regarding Lebanon, we reaffirm our support for \r\nthe sovereignty, territorial integrity, unity and political \r\nindependence of Lebanon and the full implementation \r\nof all relevant Security Council resolutions. We are \r\nalarmed by some of the statements made within \r\nLebanon about the present situation, and we call on all \r\nparties to act responsibly. We strongly support the work \r\nof the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon for the \r\nfull implementation of resolution 1701 (2006) and in \r\nmaintaining calm in its area of operation. We also \r\nfirmly support the work of the Special Tribunal for \r\n A/65/PV.55\r\n \r\n21 10-66016 \r\n \r\nLebanon, an independent international judicial body. \r\nThe Tribunal should continue to carry out its mandate \r\nwithout any interference, which will contribute to \r\nending impunity. We also look forward to early \r\nresumption of talks on the Lebanese and Syrian tracks. \r\n In conclusion, we would like to reiterate our call \r\non both parties to make the difficult decisions now to \r\nadvance peace. We believe that waiting may create \r\ncircumstances that will make it more difficult to \r\nachieve peace. Japan will continue to make its efforts \r\nto realize a just and comprehensive peace in the region \r\nbased on the relevant Security Council resolutions, the \r\nMadrid principles, the Road Map, the agreements \r\npreviously reached by the parties and the Arab Peace \r\nInitiative. \r\n The President (spoke in French): We have heard \r\nthe last speaker in the debate on this agenda item.  \r\n I would like to inform members that the \r\nAssembly will take action on draft resolutions \r\nA/65/L.18 and L.19, under agenda item 36, after taking \r\naction on draft resolutions A/65/L.14 through L.17, \r\nunder agenda item 37. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 37 \r\n \r\nQuestion of Palestine (continued) \r\n \r\n  Draft resolutions A/65/L.14, A/65/L.15, \r\nA/65/L.16 and A/65/L.17 \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): Members will \r\nrecall that the Assembly held a debate on this item at \r\nits 53rd and 54th plenary meetings, on 29 and \r\n30 November.  \r\n Before the Assembly takes action on the draft \r\nresolutions one by one, I remind members that they \r\nwill have an opportunity to explain their votes on all \r\nfour draft resolutions before and after action is taken \r\non all of them. \r\n The Assembly will now proceed to take action on \r\ndraft resolutions A/65/L.14 through A/65/L.17.  \r\n We turn first to draft resolution A/65/L.14, \r\nentitled “Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable \r\nRights of the Palestinian People”.

Our position has \r\nnot changed precisely because the one-sided language \r\nand one-sided narrative of those resolutions remains \r\nthe same. Indeed, they are completely divorced from \r\nreality. Let me give three examples. \r\n The first concerns resolution 65/16, entitled \r\n“Peaceful settlement of the question of Palestine”. \r\nHow can we adopt a resolution about a peaceful \r\nsettlement of the question of Palestine that calls on \r\nonly one side to make compromises? How can we \r\nadopt a resolution about a peaceful settlement that \r\nneglects to mention the fundamental security threats \r\nthat stand in the way of that peaceful settlement, such \r\nas the fact that 1 million Israeli civilians live in daily \r\nfear of rocket attacks from the Gaza Strip, the constant \r\narms smuggling to the Gaza Strip and so on. \r\n The resolution before us says nothing about \r\nHamas violence towards Israeli citizens or against its \r\npeople or against United Nations personnel and \r\nfacilities. \r\n How can we talk about a peaceful settlement in a \r\nresolution that does not mention that Corporal Gilad \r\nShalit has been held captive by Hamas for the last four \r\nand a half years, his whereabouts unknown and his \r\nrights denied? Why is there no reference to the positive \r\ndevelopments that have taken place over the past year? \r\n This resolution, for example, says nothing about \r\nthe measures enacted by Israel to promote economic \r\nactivity for the Palestinians. Despite legitimate security \r\nconcerns and continued terrorism, Israel has removed \r\nhundreds of roadblocks and checkpoints in the West \r\nBank. According to the International Monetary Fund, \r\nthat helped to spur economic growth of 9 per cent in \r\nthe area during the first half of 2010. The resolution \r\nignores the fact that as of June 2010, Israel allows \r\nentry of all goods into Gaza, except for dual-use items \r\nthat can be used for military purposes. \r\n Those are only a few examples of the many \r\negregious flaws in that resolution. \r\n I turn now to resolutions 65/13 through 65/15, \r\nwhich refer to the many United Nations bodies \r\ndedicated to the Palestinian issue. The disproportionate \r\nnumber of entities focused on that issue reflects a clear \r\nmisallocation of United Nations resources, given the \r\nmany important challenges facing the Organization. \r\n Israel believes that Member States should focus \r\non supporting entities that provide real support for the \r\nPalestinian people, instead of continuously using \r\nUnited Nations bodies to perpetuate and politicize its \r\nagenda. \r\n For all those reasons and others, Israel voted \r\nagainst these resolutions. \r\n A/65/PV.55\r\n \r\n25 10-66016 \r\n \r\n Mr. Erdman (United States of America): With \r\nrespect to the situation in the Middle East, the United \r\nStates is working vigorously towards a comprehensive \r\nArab-Israeli peace, resulting in two States, Israel and \r\nPalestine, living side by side in peace and security. In \r\nthat context, we are disheartened to be presented with \r\nunbalanced resolutions that place demands on Israel \r\nbut fail to acknowledge the obligations and difficult \r\nsteps required of both sides.  \r\n The resolutions under today’s agenda items, in \r\ncombination with 13 other draft resolutions that will \r\ncome before the General Assembly once again this \r\nyear, clearly illustrate a pattern of institutional bias \r\ndirected at one Member State of the United Nations. \r\nThat pattern is unlike that of the General Assembly in \r\nits handling of any other issue. These resolutions are \r\nbiased, wasteful and redundant, and do nothing to \r\nadvance the peaceful resolution of the Arab-Israeli \r\nconflict that we all seek.  \r\n Let me again highlight three annual resolutions \r\nthat renew the mandate of United Nations bodies \r\nestablished more than a generation ago and that \r\nperpetuate this institutional bias.  \r\n The resources expended by the Division for \r\nPalestinian Rights of the Secretariat, the Committee on \r\nthe Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian \r\nPeople and the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli \r\nPractices Affecting the Human Rights of the \r\nPalestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied \r\nTerritories should be directed towards more pressing \r\nissues, including direct assistance to Palestinians. We \r\nreiterate our call for all Member States to review \r\nseriously how, if at all, the continued existence of those \r\nbodies actually contributes to a solution to the Arab-\r\nIsraeli conflict.  \r\n The draft resolutions related to the Arab-Israeli \r\nconflict that the Assembly will be consider in the \r\ncoming weeks presuppose the outcome of permanent \r\nstatus negotiations, making it that much more difficult \r\nfor the parties to resolve them. Those issues properly \r\nbelong in bilateral negotiations between the Israelis \r\nand the Palestinians.  \r\n The United States is committed to working with \r\nthe parties to achieve a comprehensive Arab-Israeli \r\npeace, including a two-State solution to the Israeli-\r\nPalestinian conflict. We believe that through good-faith \r\nnegotiations, the parties can mutually agree on an \r\noutcome that ends the conflict and reconciles the \r\nPalestinians’ goal of an independent and viable State \r\nbased on the 1967 lines, with agreed territorial swaps, \r\nand the Israeli goal of a Jewish State with secure and \r\nrecognized borders that reflect subsequent \r\ndevelopments and meet Israeli security requirements. \r\n Those who want a Palestinian State should do all \r\nthey can to support the parties’ efforts to bring about a \r\njust and lasting peace and should do nothing to hinder \r\nthem. Again, the United States sees no contradiction \r\nwhatsoever between support for the Palestinian people \r\nand support for Israel. \r\n The United States recently announced an \r\nadditional $150 million in direct assistance to the \r\nPalestinian Authority, bringing our total direct budget \r\nsupport for the year to $225 million. In addition, the \r\nUnited States remains the largest single donor to the \r\nUnited Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine \r\nRefugees in the Near East, having contributed \r\n$237.8 million to date in 2010. \r\n It is impossible to see how support for the \r\nresolutions before us today contributes to a just, lasting \r\nand comprehensive peace. We cannot support these \r\nresolutions, but we will remain focused on direct \r\nnegotiations — the only means by which the parties \r\nwill be able to conclude an agreement to achieve \r\nPalestinian aspirations for sovereignty while ensuring \r\nthe long-term security of Israel. \r\n The President (spoke in French): We have heard \r\nthe last speaker in explanation of vote after the voting. \r\n The General Assembly has thus concluded this \r\nstage of its consideration of agenda item 37.  \r\n \r\nAgenda item 36 (continued) \r\n \r\n  The situation in the Middle East \r\n \r\n  Draft resolutions (A/65/L.18 and A/65/L.19) \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): Members will \r\nrecall that the Assembly held a debate on this item \r\nearlier in today’s plenary meeting. \r\n The General Assembly will now take decisions on \r\ndraft resolutions A/65/L.18 and A/65/L.19. \r\n The Assembly will first take a decision on draft \r\nresolution A/65/L.18.

I give the floor to the representative of \r\nthe Secretariat. \r\n Mr. Botnaru (Department for General Assembly \r\nand Conference Management): Since the introduction \r\nof draft resolution A/65/L.19, the Plurinational State of \r\nBolivia and Maldives have become sponsors. \r\n The President (spoke in French): The General \r\nAssembly will now take a decision on draft resolution \r\nA/65/L.19.

Before giving the floor to \r\nthose speakers, may I remind delegations that \r\nexplanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes and \r\nshould be made by delegations from their seats.  \r\n Mrs. Dunlop (Brazil) (spoke in Spanish): I have \r\nthe honour to speak on behalf of the delegations of \r\nArgentina and Brazil on the situation in the Middle \r\nEast. I wish in particular to explain the votes of the \r\ndelegations of Argentina and Brazil on resolution \r\n65/18, on the Syrian Golan, which the General \r\nAssembly has just adopted.  \r\n Argentina and Brazil voted in favour of that \r\nresolution because we believe that its essential aspect \r\nis linked to the illicit nature of the acquisition of \r\nterritory by force. Article 4, paragraph 2, of the United \r\nNations Charter prohibits the threat or use of force \r\nagainst the territorial integrity of a State. That is a \r\nstandard of international law.  \r\n At the same time, I wish to clarify the position of \r\nour delegations with regard to paragraph 6 of the \r\nresolution. Our vote does not prejudge the contents of \r\nthat paragraph, in particular the reference to “the line \r\nof 4 June 1967”.  \r\n Argentina and Brazil believe that it is important \r\nto make progress in the search for a solution in the \r\nSyrian-Israeli track in the Middle East conflict in a \r\nmanner that will put an end to the occupation of the \r\nGolan Heights. That is why on this occasion, once \r\nagain, on behalf of the Governments of Argentina and \r\nBrazil, I wish to urge the authorities of Israel and Syria \r\nto resume negotiations in order to find a definitive \r\nsolution to the Syrian Golan situation, in accordance \r\nwith Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 \r\n(1973) and the principle of land for peace. \r\n Mr. Ja’afari (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in \r\nArabic): My delegation expresses its deep appreciation \r\nand gratitude to the General Assembly, which since \r\n1981 has continuously voted in the majority for peace, \r\njustice and law and which has now adopted resolution \r\n65/18, entitled “The Syrian Golan”, as well as the other \r\nresolutions relating to the question of Palestine and the \r\nsituation in the Middle East. \r\n The continuing response of the international \r\ncommunity in support of these resolutions shows the \r\nadherence of Member States to the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter and their \r\nrejection of foreign occupation, backing thereby our \r\nlegitimate right to recover our territory occupied by \r\nIsrael for more than 40 years.  \r\n Voting for these resolutions by the overwhelming \r\nmajority of the Member States sends a clear \r\ninternational message to Israel to the effect that \r\noccupation, assassination, expansionist and aggressive \r\npolicies, the construction of settlements, the imposition \r\nof faits accomplis and annexation of the territories of \r\nothers by force are all rejected practices that violate the \r\nCharter as well as the Fourth Geneva Convention of \r\n1949.  \r\n For those reasons, those practices have been \r\ncondemned by the international community. The world \r\nsays with one voice that comprehensive and just peace \r\ncan be achieved by going back to the terms of \r\nreference, including the resolutions that have just been \r\nA/65/PV.55  \r\n \r\n10-66016 28 \r\n \r\nvoted upon. That presupposes the need for an Israeli \r\npartner in order to achieve peace, which is not the case \r\nright now. It also means the return of all occupied Arab \r\nterritories, including the Golan and Jerusalem, to the \r\nlines of 4 June 1967, and the establishment of an \r\nindependent Palestine with Al-Quds as its capital, \r\nbecause the continuation of occupation runs counter to \r\npeace and requires exhausting all means to terminate \r\nthat occupation.  \r\n Israel’s provocative actions of late, particularly \r\nwith regard to conducting a so-called plebiscite on the \r\ndestiny of the Golan and Jerusalem, are completely \r\nrejected and internationally deplored. Moreover, they \r\nare illegal. Nor do they change the fact that the Golan \r\nis an occupied Syrian territory and is thus \r\nnon-negotiable. The recovery of the Golan in full to the \r\n4 June 1967 line is the only basis for establishing \r\npeace.  \r\n Once again, I reiterate my country’s thanks to all \r\nthe States that sponsored the draft resolution entitled \r\n“The Syrian Golan”. I wish also to express our \r\ngratitude to those who voted in favour of it.  \r\n By the same token, I would like to reiterate my \r\ncountry’s call for achieving just and comprehensive \r\npeace on the basis of resolutions of international \r\nlegitimacy, particularly Security Council resolutions \r\n242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 497 (1981), as well as the \r\nprinciple of land for peace and the Arab Peace \r\nInitiative. I also wish to assert Syria’s insistence, more \r\nthan ever, on liberating the Golan to the line of 4 June \r\n1967, purging it of settlements and terminating Israeli \r\noccupation by all means guaranteed under international \r\nlaw, under the aegis of which we are meeting here. \r\n Once again, we would like to emphasize that \r\nSyria’s calls for peace do not mean concessions to be \r\nmade by Israel and pronounced by it as painful. Rather, \r\nthese are usurped rights and lands that must be returned \r\nin full to their original owners. This is the meaning of a \r\ngenuine, just and comprehensive peace around which \r\nthere is international unanimity. \r\n Mr. Salsabili (Islamic Republic of Iran): I wish \r\nto put on record here in the Assembly that my \r\ndelegation, in the spirit of solidarity with the \r\nPalestinian people and cause, and with other peoples \r\nunder occupation, voted in favour of all the resolutions \r\njust adopted — resolutions 65/13, 65/14, 65/15 and \r\n65/16 — under agenda item 37, “The question of \r\nPalestine”, and also resolutions 65/17 and 65/18, under \r\nagenda item 36, “The situation in the Middle East”. \r\n Nevertheless, I would like to express my \r\ndelegation’s reservations on those parts of the \r\nresolutions that might be construed as recognition of \r\nthe Israeli regime.  \r\n The President (spoke in French): I now give the \r\nfloor to the observer of Palestine. \r\n Mr. Mansour (Palestine): I would like to begin \r\nby expressing to you, Mr. President, the deepest \r\nappreciation for the patience and principled \r\ncommitment to justice in our region that you have \r\ndemonstrated yesterday, during the International Day \r\nof Solidarity with the Palestinian People, and today, by \r\nbeing with us in both the morning and afternoon \r\nmeetings of the Assembly. The delegation of Palestine \r\nwould like to put on record our deepest appreciation \r\nfor such a principled position. \r\n We would also like to express our gratitude and \r\nthanks to all countries that sponsored the resolutions \r\nrelated to the question of Palestine and to the situation \r\nin the Middle East, and to all those who voted in \r\nfavour. \r\n We believe that the results of the voting serve as \r\na clear demonstration of where the international \r\ncommunity stands on the issue of justice as it relates to \r\nthe question of Palestine. We are very grateful for that \r\nsupport. It gives our people additional strength to \r\ncontinue their struggle to end occupation and, \r\nhopefully, to actualize the dream of all of us. President \r\nBarack Obama so accurately articulated that dream in \r\nSeptember (see A/65/PV.11) when he said that maybe \r\nnext year, around this time, a new State will be joining \r\nthe United Nations. \r\n Some people think these resolutions, when they \r\nare adopted by such an overwhelming majority, are \r\none-sided. The entire international community and \r\nhuge blocs of nations — the Non-Aligned Movement, \r\nthe Organization of the Islamic Conference, the Arab \r\nGroup, the European Union, the African Group, the \r\nCaribbean Community — in short, everywhere one \r\nlooks, there is a huge number of countries that voted in \r\nfavour. Are all of those people pushing an agenda with \r\na one-sided viewpoint? I do not believe so. I think that \r\nassertion is ridiculous, and I do not believe that anyone \r\ncan take it seriously.  \r\n A/65/PV.55\r\n \r\n29 10-66016 \r\n \r\n With regard to the issue of asking one side to \r\nmake concessions, I think we, the Palestinian people, \r\nmade historic concessions in 1974, when we accepted \r\nthe notion of the two-State solution. We legislated that \r\nin our proclamation of independence in 1988. \r\n I think that when the Arab nations adopted the \r\nArab Peace Initiative — which calls for the total \r\nwithdrawal of Israel from all the areas it occupied in \r\n1967 and for the independent State of Palestine, with \r\nEast Jerusalem as its capital, in exchange for the \r\nnormalization of relations with the State of Israel — \r\nwe made painful concessions, while the other side is \r\nnot even accepting small concessions as are reflected \r\nin a resolution that is so balanced, such as the one on \r\npeaceful settlement. \r\n The last comment I want to make is: what is the \r\nvalue of these resolutions? These resolutions uphold \r\ninternational law, and that is the biggest help that can  \r\n \r\nbe provided to a serious negotiation process leading to \r\npeace between us and the Israelis. That is the value of \r\nthese resolutions, and if some think we are not in the \r\nbusiness of upholding international law in the United \r\nNations, I would like them to explain to me and to all \r\nof us what kind of business, then, we are engaged in. I \r\nthink that upholding international law is a huge \r\ncontribution to any peace process and to the success of \r\nthat process. \r\n We thank you again, Mr. President, and would \r\nlike to say that it has been a very inspiring two days for \r\nus, the Palestinian people. I am sure that this will help \r\nus to accomplish our objectives as soon as possible. \r\n The President (spoke in French): The General \r\nAssembly has thus concluded this stage of its \r\nconsideration of agenda items 36. \r\n The meeting rose at 6.10 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\n"
