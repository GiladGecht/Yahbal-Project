(Switzerland) \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda items 117 and 118 \r\n \r\nImplementation of the resolutions of the  \r\nUnited Nations \r\n \r\nRevitalization of the work of the General Assembly \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): The \r\nrevitalization of the work of the General Assembly is \r\nan important topic that has now been on the agenda for \r\nseveral sessions. In that context, I thank Their \r\nExcellencies Ambassadors Sanja Štiglic and Jorge \r\nArgüello for their effective work as co-Chairs of the \r\nAd Hoc Working Group on the Revitalization of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at the sixty-fourth session. Their \r\nefforts led to the adoption of the Working Group’s \r\nreport (A/64/903) and of resolution 64/301. Those \r\ndocuments will be useful to our discussion today. \r\n On several occasions since the opening of this \r\nsession, I have restated my vision of a strong General \r\nAssembly that serves as the preeminent forum for \r\nglobal debate. I have noted with satisfaction that that \r\nvision is shared by many. The holding of informal \r\ndebates before and after the Group of Twenty (G-20) \r\nSummit, which happened on 16 and 22 November and \r\nsought build a bridge between the G-20 and the \r\nGeneral Assembly, is one way of reaffirming the \r\ncentral role of our Organization in global governance. \r\n Another element, which is just as important, is \r\nthat of ensuring that our Organization is equipped to \r\nmeet the challenges it faces and undertake the \r\nnecessary reform. Revitalizing the work of the General \r\nAssembly is part of that effort. \r\n Progress has already been made in a number of \r\nareas. For example, the practice of electing the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at least three \r\nmonths before he takes office allows him better to \r\nprepare himself for the role. Similarly, the prerogative \r\nof the President to organize informal thematic debates \r\nis an effective way to involve the General Assembly in \r\nmatters of global debate and to ensure an effective \r\nworking relationship with other players in the arena of \r\nglobal governance. \r\n Since assuming my functions as President, I have \r\nalso had regular interactions with all the successive \r\nPresidents of the Security Council for this year and the \r\nPresident of the Economic and Social Council. But, as \r\nnoted in the draft resolution introduced for discussion \r\ntoday, progress still needs to be made in a great number \r\nof areas, from the procedure for the nomination of the \r\nSecretary-General to the working methods of the \r\nAssembly. \r\n The importance of these issues should not be \r\nunderestimated. An overloaded agenda risks \r\nundermining the quality of the debate. The \r\norganization of too many high-level meetings, for \r\nexample, dilutes the attention given to each individual \r\none. In that context, I followed with great interest the \r\nefforts undertaken by the Second Committee to \r\nrationalize its agenda. I am convinced that that \r\napproach is an example to be followed for the General \r\nAssembly.  \r\nA/65/PV.56  \r\n \r\n10-67395 2 \r\n \r\n This initiative is in the Assembly’s hands. I \r\nexpect today’s debate to lead to a clear willingness to \r\nmove forward on initiatives to be taken to revitalize the \r\nAssembly, which will give useful signposts to the new \r\nAd Hoc Working Group on Revitalization of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, the Chairs of which, Ambassadors \r\nDalius Čekuolis and Camillo Gonsalves, have agreed \r\nto steer the Group’s work. I thank them most \r\nparticularly and assure them of my support in their \r\nwork.  \r\n Mr. Grauls (Belgium) (spoke in French): I have \r\nthe honour to speak on behalf of the European Union. \r\nThe candidate countries Turkey, Croatia and the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia; countries of the \r\nStabilization and Association Process and potential \r\ncandidates Albania, Montenegro and Serbia; countries \r\nof the European Free Trade Association and members \r\nof the European Economic Area Liechtenstein and \r\nNorway, as well as the Republic of Moldova, Armenia \r\nand Georgia, endorse this statement. \r\n Mr. President, the European Union first of all \r\nthanks your predecessor, Mr. Ali Treki, President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. We also \r\nthank Ms. Sanja Štiglic and Mr. Jorge Argüello, the \r\nPermanent Representatives of Slovenia and Argentina, \r\nrespectively, for their work as Co-Chairs of the Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group on the Revitalization of the General \r\nAssembly. The European Union also thanks you,  \r\nMr. President, for the prompt appointment of the \r\nPermanent Representative of the Republic of \r\nLithuania, Mr. Dalius Čekuolis, and the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, \r\nMr. Camillo Gonsalves, as Co-Chairs of the Working \r\nGroup.  \r\n Mr. President, you devoted your statement \r\nopening the general debate of the sixty-fifth session to \r\nrestoring the central role of the United Nations and the \r\nGeneral Assembly in global governance (see \r\nA/65/PV.11). In your opening address, you stressed \r\nthat too often public opinion views the General \r\nAssembly as a powerless forum, with no real impact. \r\nYou voiced the hope that the sixty-fifth session would \r\nshow that the Assembly is capable of making a \r\ndifference. The European Union shares your frank \r\nassessment of the situation.  \r\n Nevertheless, the change that you call for, Sir, \r\ncannot be achieved without effort. The General \r\nAssembly will prove the skeptics wrong and return to \r\nthe heart of global governance only if the Member \r\nStates affirm their willingness to review their habits \r\nand working methods in order to focus fully on the \r\nquestions that concern public opinion and the \r\ninternational community as a whole.  \r\n That exercise will require difficult choices in \r\nrevising the Assembly’s priorities and working \r\nmethods, particularly in terms of rationalizing and \r\nreducing the number of resolutions. Those efforts \r\nshould nevertheless allow us to devote ourselves more \r\nto substantive political debates on emerging issues on \r\nwhich the United Nations — and the General Assembly \r\nin particular — are called to take action. \r\n Mr. President, the European Union stands \r\nresolutely at your side in your efforts to revitalize the \r\nGeneral Assembly and reaffirms its support for \r\neffective multilateralism, of which the United Nations \r\nis a central actor. The Lisbon Treaty, which entered \r\ninto force one year ago, further stresses that aspect. \r\nBolstering the United Nations therefore remains one of \r\nthe European Union’s principal priorities.  \r\n The European Union is convinced that the \r\nGeneral Assembly, as one of the main bodies of the \r\nUnited Nations, should demonstrate its relevance by \r\nconcentrating on issues that are in the interest of the \r\nMember States, the international community as a \r\nwhole and public opinion.  \r\n The European Union has always believed that it \r\nis vital to develop specific initiatives designed to \r\nimprove the Assembly’s performance. That is why we \r\nnote with satisfaction the fact that the latest report of \r\nthe Ad Hoc Working Group on the Revitalization of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, as called for by resolution 64/301, \r\nincludes an in-depth review of the inventory table of \r\nall the relevant proposals on this subject, as well as on \r\nthe status of their implementation.  \r\n The debate on the working methods of the \r\nSecond Committee, which took place at the opening at \r\nthe Committee’s work during the sixty-fifth session, is \r\nanother example of concrete progress that the \r\nEuropean Union welcomes. That initiative should be \r\nextended to the other Committees. \r\n In conclusion, the European Union wants to stress \r\nthe fundamental role played by the Ad Hoc Working \r\nGroup on the Revitalization of the General Assembly \r\nand will continue to engage in a pragmatic manner in \r\nthe work of the Working Group. In that context, the \r\n A/65/PV.56\r\n \r\n3 10-67395 \r\n \r\nEuropean Union is pleased to contribute to the crafting \r\nof a plan of work. \r\n Mr. Le Luong Minh (Viet Nam): I have the \r\nhonour to speak on behalf of the 10 States members of \r\nthe Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN): \r\nBrunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, the Lao \r\nPeople’s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Myanmar, \r\nthe Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Viet Nam.  \r\n ASEAN is consistent in its view that the General \r\nAssembly is the primary policymaking and \r\nrepresentative body of the United Nations. It \r\nrecognizes the role of the General Assembly in \r\naddressing issues of international peace and security in \r\naccordance with the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nTherefore, ASEAN underlines the imperative of \r\nrevitalizing the work of the Organization with a view \r\nto further enhancing the role, authority, effectiveness \r\nand efficiency of the General Assembly. That requires \r\nthe commitment and political will of all Member States \r\nand should be conducted in a comprehensive, inclusive \r\nand transparent manner.  \r\n In that regard, ASEAN joins the call for the full \r\nimplementation of resolution 64/301, adopted on  \r\n13 September 2010, on the revitalization of the work of \r\nthe General Assembly. ASEAN appreciates the efforts \r\nof the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Revitalization of \r\nthe General Assembly that resulted in its report \r\ncontained in document A/64/903, of 8 September 2010.  \r\n ASEAN cannot emphasize enough the vital \r\nimportance of information flow, cooperation and \r\ncoordination among the principle organs of the United \r\nNations. ASEAN therefore encourages, inter alia, the \r\ncontinued holding of periodic meetings between the \r\nPresidents of the General Assembly, the Security \r\nCouncil and the Economic and Social Council, as well \r\nas of informal meetings of the Security Council \r\nPresident with all Member States before the \r\npreparation of Council’s annual report, as has been the \r\ncase in 2008, 2009 and 2010. We support efforts to \r\npromote positive, effective and balanced working \r\nrelationships among the principal organs of the United \r\nNations, especially between the Security Council and \r\nthe General Assembly, as set out in Article 24 of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations, so as to ensure the \r\neffective discharge of their respective mandates, duties \r\nand functions. \r\n The strengthening of the Office of the President \r\nof the General Assembly remains essential to the \r\nprocess of revitalization. That includes, among other \r\nthings, the strengthening of its institutional memory, \r\nadequate budgetary allocation in accordance with \r\nexisting procedures, and the provision of appropriate \r\nprotocol and security services and office space for the \r\nPresident, within existing resources. In that connection, \r\nASEAN believes it necessary to ensure both the \r\nsufficient provision and efficient use of financial and \r\nhuman resources for the Office in order to improve its \r\nsubstantive work. \r\n The selection and appointment of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral is yet another issue of great interest and deep \r\nconcern to the international community. ASEAN’s \r\nview is that that issue should be addressed in a \r\ncomprehensive and transparent way that includes all \r\nMember States, with due regard to regional rotation \r\nand gender equality. \r\n ASEAN urges Member States to strictly observe \r\nArticle 97 of the Charter, as well as provisions of \r\nAssembly resolutions 11(I) of 24 January 1946 and \r\n51/241 of 31 July 1997, concerning the role of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, in appointing the Secretary-General \r\nupon the recommendation of the Security Council. \r\nFurthermore, we encourage the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly to consult with Member States to \r\nidentify and endorse potential candidates, then forward \r\nthe results to the Security Council. \r\n The General Assembly should assume a more \r\nproactive role in dealing with issues of common \r\nconcern to the international community, including \r\ninternational peace and security and the economy, as \r\nwell as issues relating to the new peacebuilding \r\narchitecture, which has made immense contributions to \r\nthe purposes and principles of the Charter and the goals \r\nof the Organization. \r\n We welcome the General Assembly’s initiative in \r\nconvening timely and relevant meetings in response to \r\nthe global crisis, such as the Conference on the World \r\nFinancial and Economic Crisis and Its Impact on \r\nDevelopment, in June 2009. ASEAN encourages the \r\nAssembly to further build on those practices. \r\n In today’s world of multi-stakeholder interaction, \r\nit is essential that the General Assembly’s role and \r\nauthority be revitalized to contribute to strengthening \r\nthe United Nations’ legitimate and universal \r\nrepresentation in global governance. ASEAN is \r\ncommitted to working actively and constructively with \r\nall other partners towards that end. \r\nA/65/PV.56  \r\n \r\n10-67395 4 \r\n \r\n Mr. Benmehidi (Algeria): I have the honour to \r\nspeak on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement \r\n(NAM). \r\n At the outset, the Non-Aligned Movement \r\ncongratulates His Excellency Ambassador Camillo \r\nGonsalves, Permanent Representative of Saint Vincent \r\nand the Grenadines, and His Excellency Ambassador \r\nDalius Čekuolis, Permanent Representative of the \r\nRepublic of Lithuania, upon their appointment as \r\nco-Chairs of the Ad Hoc Working Group of the \r\nRevitalization of the General Assembly during the \r\nsixty-fifth session. Allow me also to express the \r\ngratitude of the members of the Movement to Her \r\nExcellency Ambassador Sanja Štiglic, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Slovenia, and His Excellency \r\nAmbassador Jorge Argüello, Permanent Representative \r\nof Argentina, for their excellent work in co-chairing the \r\nAd Hoc Working Group during the sixty-fourth \r\nsession. \r\n The Non-Aligned Movement reiterates the \r\nimportance of the revitalization of the General \r\nAssembly and the validity and relevance of its \r\nprincipled position with regard to that process. The \r\nMovement underlines that the revitalization process is \r\nof a political nature aimed mainly at strengthening the \r\nrole of the General Assembly as the chief deliberative \r\npolicymaking and representative organ of the United \r\nNations and its position in the wider United Nations \r\nsystem. The process should therefore be conducted in \r\nan inclusive, transparent and efficient manner. \r\n The Non-Aligned Movement emphasizes the need \r\nfor Member States to fully respect the functions and \r\npowers of each principal organ of the United Nations, \r\nin particular the General Assembly, and to maintain a \r\nbalance among those organs within their respective \r\nCharter-based functions and powers. In that regard, the \r\nSecurity Council must fully observe all Charter \r\nprovisions and all General Assembly resolutions that \r\nclarify the Council’s relationship with the Assembly \r\nand with other principal organs. \r\n Once again, NAM expresses its concern, raised \r\nduring previous sessions, about the continuous attempt \r\nof the Security Council to encroach on powers and \r\nprerogatives of the General Assembly. Article 24 of the \r\nCharter does not provide the Security Council with the \r\ncompetence to address issues that fall within the \r\nfunctions and powers of the General Assembly and the \r\nEconomic and Social Council. \r\n The General Assembly, as the policymaking \r\norgan of the Organization, has the authority and the \r\nessential role for drawing the framework, setting the \r\nprinciples and identifying the objectives for the wider \r\nUnited Nations system, in its numerous organs, \r\nagencies and programmes.  \r\n The General Assembly should maintain its role \r\nand mandate in setting the priorities of the United \r\nNations in considering all budgetary and administrative \r\nissues and reforms, including its absolute authority to \r\nallocate and reallocate financial and human resources \r\nand in the appointment of senior officials in the \r\nSecretariat, in accordance with the Charter and relevant \r\nAssembly resolutions. In that regard, the prerogatives \r\nof the Assembly as the chief oversight organ of the \r\nOrganization, including for the management and \r\nprocurement of peacekeeping operations, must be \r\nrespected.  \r\n The Non-Aligned Movement, while expressing its \r\nreadiness to continue to support all ongoing efforts to \r\nstrengthen the central role and authority of the General \r\nAssembly, wishes to state that it will oppose any \r\napproach that seeks to undermine or minimize the \r\nAssembly’s achievements or diminish its current role \r\nand functions, or that raises questions about its \r\nrelevance and credibility. \r\n The Non-Aligned Movement welcomes the \r\nadoption of resolution 64/301 in September, by which \r\nthe General Assembly, inter alia, established the Ad \r\nHoc Working Group to discuss, during the current \r\nsession, issues related to the revitalization of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and to assess in particular the status \r\nof the implementation of the Assembly’s previous \r\nresolutions on this matter.  \r\n The Movement reiterates the validity and \r\nrelevance of all its positions and reaffirms its \r\nwillingness to contribute effectively and constructively \r\nto the activities of the Working Group in order to \r\nidentify ways and means to strengthen the role and \r\nauthority of the General Assembly. A thorough \r\nevaluation of the status of implementation of Assembly \r\nresolutions and a clear identification of the underlying \r\ncauses behind any lack of implementation are of the \r\nutmost importance in order to progressively eliminate \r\nthe constraints that still prevent the process of \r\nrevitalization of the Assembly from achieving all its \r\npotential. \r\n A/65/PV.56\r\n \r\n5 10-67395 \r\n \r\n It is obvious that, while the prerogatives of the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly have not changed, \r\nhis or her role and activities have drastically evolved \r\nover the years, both in adapting to the growing \r\nactivities and initiatives of the Assembly and in \r\nperforming official and protocol functions and making \r\nthe Assembly’s work more visible. It is the \r\nMovement’s view that that increase in the workload \r\nshould be matched with the necessary human and \r\nfinancial resources. \r\n The Movement recalls, in that regard, that \r\nresolution 64/301 requests the Secretary-General to \r\nsubmit proposals in the context of the proposed \r\nprogramme budget for the biennium 2012-2013 to \r\nreview the budget allocation to the Office of the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly, and emphasizes the \r\nimportance of ensuring the effectiveness of the Office \r\nof the President, including through strengthening its \r\ninstitutional memory. While noting with appreciation \r\nthe progress already achieved in that regard, we are of \r\nthe view that a particular effort should be devoted to \r\nthe implementation of the already existing resolutions \r\non this matter as well as to identifying, during the \r\nupcoming discussions in the Working Group, ways and \r\nmeans to pursue this objective progressively and with \r\ndetermination. \r\n NAM reaffirms the need for the selection of the \r\nSecretary-General to be more transparent and inclusive \r\nof all Member States so as to allow the General \r\nAssembly to participate effectively and efficiently in \r\nthe selection and appointment of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, in conformity with the United Nations \r\nCharter. \r\n NAM is of the view that, in full compliance with \r\nArticle 97 of the Charter, one useful step to strengthen \r\nthe Assembly’s role in the selection process is to \r\nencourage it to consult with Member States in order to \r\nidentify and to endorse candidates. A formal \r\npresentation before the Assembly of candidatures for \r\nthe position of Secretary-General will undoubtedly \r\nallow for effective and useful interaction with Member \r\nStates. The President of the General Assembly could, \r\nfor that purpose, convene a meeting of the Assembly \r\nfor an exchange of views and dialogue with all \r\ncandidates. The outcome of the consultations, \r\nincluding a possible endorsement of candidates, would \r\nthen be forwarded to the Security Council. \r\n NAM is aware also that that mechanism, when \r\nadopted, will require a transitional period and might \r\nnot be immediately applicable to the next process of \r\nselection and appointment of the Secretary-General.  \r\n In conclusion, the Non-Aligned Movement \r\nreaffirms that a reinvigorated General Assembly, fully \r\nexerting its role and authority in a more responsive \r\nenvironment, would significantly contribute to \r\nstrengthening the wider United Nations system and to \r\nthe improvement of international governance and the \r\nenhancement of multilateralism. NAM is ready to \r\ncooperate and to engage with other delegations in \r\nfruitful and constructive discussion in a \r\ncomprehensive, thorough and transparent manner on \r\nthis agenda item. \r\n Mr. Abdelaziz (Egypt): At the outset, \r\nMr. President, I would like to express Egypt’s \r\nappreciation for your decision to include the \r\nrevitalization of the work of the General Assembly in \r\nthe main priorities and as an essential element of the \r\nAssembly’s theme at its sixty-fifth session, \r\n\"Reaffirming the central role of the United Nations in \r\nglobal governance\". \r\n I take this opportunity to also thank Her \r\nExcellency Ambassador Sanja Štiglic, the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Slovenia, and His Excellency \r\nAmbassador Jorge Argüello, the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Argentina, for their excellent work \r\nand dedication in co-chairing the Ad Hoc Working \r\nGroup on the Revitalization of the General Assembly \r\nduring the sixty-fourth session, and to pledge full \r\nsupport for the newly appointed co-Chairs of the Ad \r\nHoc Working Group for the sixty-fifth session, His \r\nExcellency Ambassador Dalius Čekuolis, the \r\nPermanent Representative of Lithuania, and His \r\nExcellency Ambassador Camillo Gonsalves, the \r\nPermanent Representative of Saint Vincent and the \r\nGrenadines, in pushing the process of revitalization of \r\nthe work of the General Assembly forward. \r\n I would like to associate Egypt with the statement \r\nmade by His Excellency the Permanent Representative \r\nof Algeria on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement, \r\nand to highlight some additional remarks Egypt deems \r\nnecessary for the success of the process of revitalizing \r\nthe General Assembly. \r\n Since 1993, Member States have adopted by \r\nconsensus more than 16 consecutive resolutions \r\ncontaining specific agreed measures aimed at \r\nA/65/PV.56  \r\n \r\n10-67395 6 \r\n \r\nimproving and enhancing the work of the General \r\nAssembly as the chief deliberative, policymaking and \r\nrepresentative principal organ of the United Nations \r\nand at strengthening its role in the process of standard-\r\nsetting and the codification of international law. \r\n Unfortunately, those agreed measures have not \r\nbeen implemented. Furthermore, we have failed to \r\nachieve the main objectives set in the relevant \r\nparagraphs of the Millennium Declaration (resolution \r\n55/2) and the 2005 World Summit Outcome (resolution \r\n60/1). No concrete results have been achieved on this \r\nimportant topic thus far. That is mainly due to the lack \r\nof political will to ensure that the General Assembly \r\nplays its leading role in strict observance of the \r\ndelicate balance established by the Charter among all \r\nprincipal organs, in particular as concerns the Security \r\nCouncil. \r\n Therefore, Egypt believes that the first and \r\ncrucial step to carry forward the process of the \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly would be to \r\nfocus on the honest implementation of all previous \r\nresolutions adopted by consensus on this matter and on \r\nnew proposals adopted during the current session. In \r\nthat regard, and in accordance with paragraph 3 of \r\nresolution 64/301, we expect the Ad Hoc Working \r\nGroup to conduct a thorough evaluation of the status of \r\nimplementation of previous resolutions, and the \r\nSecretary-General to submit an update on the status of \r\nimplementation of all those resolutions, as well as \r\nspecific proposals to ensure their full implementation. \r\n The relationship between the General Assembly \r\nand the Security Council should centre on the \r\napplication by both organs of their respective \r\nmandates. Unfortunately, the Security Council \r\ncontinues to encroach on the role and functions of the \r\nGeneral Assembly in many aspects. On the other hand, \r\nthe Assembly does not, and sometimes cannot, fully \r\nexercise its responsibilities enshrined in the Charter. \r\n The General Assembly should actively undertake \r\nits role and respond to emerging situations that \r\nendanger international peace and security, as stipulated \r\nin Articles 10 to 14 and 35 of the United Nations \r\nCharter, and should use the procedures set out in \r\nrules 7, 8, 9 and 10 of the rules of procedure of the \r\nAssembly, which enable swift and urgent action by the \r\nAssembly, bearing in mind that the Security Council \r\nhas the primary responsibility for the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security.  \r\n The adoption of resolution 63/301, on the \r\nsituation in Honduras, and of resolutions 64/10 and \r\n64/254, on the follow-up to the report of the United \r\nNations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict, are \r\nclear illustrations of the ability of the General \r\nAssembly to take the lead in issues related to \r\nmaintaining international peace and security without \r\nencroaching on the competence of the Security \r\nCouncil. This trend on the part of the General \r\nAssembly and its President should be encouraged and \r\neven developed, particularly when the Security Council \r\nfails to address cases involving genocide, ethnic \r\ncleansing, crimes against humanity, grave violations of \r\ninternational humanitarian law and the cessation of \r\nhostilities between belligerent parties, in fulfilment of \r\nits primary responsibility and in accordance with \r\nparagraphs 138 and 139 of the 2005 World Summit \r\nOutcome. \r\n The reform of the Security Council is imperative, \r\nat the same time, in order to make it more democratic \r\nthrough enlargement and the total elimination of the \r\nveto, starting with cases of major crimes. Achieving \r\nthat objective will solidify the commitment of the \r\nCouncil’s permanent members, including the new \r\npermanent members, and of all members of the General \r\nAssembly to protect peoples from such heinous crimes. \r\n Egypt stresses that the General Assembly remains \r\nthe principle organ to conduct reviews of subsidiary \r\nbodies, including the Human Rights Council and the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, in accordance with its \r\nrelevant resolutions. On 29 October the Assembly \r\nconcluded the process of the review of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission with a consensus (see \r\nA/65/PV.41), and Egypt stresses that the result of the \r\nreview process of the Human Rights Council should \r\nalso be adopted by consensus.  \r\n The General Assembly should also increase its \r\ninteraction with civil society and non-governmental \r\norganizations and the private sector on relevant issues. \r\nIn that regard, Egypt appreciates the steps taken by the \r\nPresident of the Assembly at its sixty-fourth session in \r\nconvening thematic debates on topics including water, \r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation and peacekeeping \r\noperations, which also contributed positively to public \r\nawareness of the Assembly and to its visibility. We also \r\ncommend you, Mr. President, for continuing that \r\npractice, starting with a thematic debate on disaster \r\nrisk reduction in February 2011, which will be \r\nfollowed by other debates on strengthening the central \r\n A/65/PV.56\r\n \r\n7 10-67395 \r\n \r\nrole of the United Nations in global governance and \r\nother issues. \r\n Ensuring the effectiveness of the Office of the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly is also essential for \r\nimproving the role and the authority of the Assembly, \r\nincluding through enhancing the institutional memory \r\nof the Office. In that regard, we look forward to the \r\nSecretary-General’s report to be submitted in the \r\ncontext of the proposed programme budget for the \r\nbiennium 2012-2013, to review the budget allocation to \r\nthe President’s Office so that the General Assembly \r\nmay take a decision ensuring that the financial and \r\nhuman resources allocated to the Office match the \r\nexpanded workload of the Assembly.  \r\n The process of the selection and appointment of \r\nthe Secretary-General is becoming less transparent and \r\nless inclusive over time. Article 97 of the Charter is \r\nclear in stating that “the Secretary-General shall be \r\nappointed by the General Assembly upon the \r\nrecommendation of the Security Council”. However, \r\nthe Security Council — in particular the permanent \r\nmembers — has assumed too much power over the \r\nyears in this matter, which is considered one of the \r\nmany aspects of its encroachment on the prerogatives \r\nof the Assembly.  \r\n Moreover, it has been proved that resolution \r\n11 (1) of 1946 has shortcomings in addressing the \r\ngrowing concern of Member States. For that reason, \r\nthere is an urgent need for a genuine improvement in \r\nthe current process through the honest implementation \r\nof the relevant provisions of Assembly resolutions \r\n51/241 and 60/286. That will allow the Assembly to be \r\nmore involved at early stages of the selection process \r\nwhen identifying candidates for this key post. The veto \r\nshould not be used in the selection of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. \r\n On the other hand, the report of the Joint \r\nInspection Unit on selection and conditions of service \r\nof executive heads in the United Nations system \r\norganizations, contained in document JIU/REP/2009/8, \r\nshould constitute a solid basis for discussion among \r\nMember States, within the framework of the Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group on the Revitalization of the General \r\nAssembly, about ways to enhance the Assembly’s role \r\nin the selection of the Secretary-General. \r\n Our focus should not be directed only towards \r\nprocedures and working methods but rather towards \r\nsubstantive measures. Therefore, the best way to \r\nenhance and promote multilateralism is to revitalize the \r\nGeneral Assembly by identifying and implementing \r\nfurther measures to enhance its role, authority, \r\neffectiveness and efficiency, consistently building on \r\nprevious resolutions and the progress made during past \r\nsessions. As the credibility of the United Nations and \r\nits capacity to fulfil its responsibilities is increasingly \r\nlinked to the ability of the General Assembly to \r\nexercise its institutional prerogatives, Egypt stresses \r\nthe urgent need for strong political will in support of \r\ninternational good governance based on equality, \r\ntransparency and accountability. \r\n Mr. Delgado Sánchez (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nMy delegation fully supports the statement made by the \r\nrepresentative of Algeria on behalf of the Movement of \r\nNon-Aligned Countries. We would like to add a few \r\ncomments in our national capacity. \r\n First, we welcome the commendable efforts of \r\nthe co-chairmanship of the Ad Hoc Working Group on \r\nthe Revitalization of the General Assembly during the \r\nsixty-fourth session, the report of the Working Group \r\nin document A/64/903, and the adoption of resolution \r\n64/301. We also congratulate the Ambassadors of \r\nLithuania and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines for \r\nassuming the co-chairmanship during the sixty-fifth \r\nsession, and we assure them of our full cooperation and \r\nhelp. \r\n The revitalization of the General Assembly is a \r\nkey element for the true reform of the United Nations. \r\nUntil the Assembly fully exercises its functions and \r\npowers, we cannot be satisfied with our work. We \r\ncannot speak of an organization that responds to the \r\ncurrent state of international relations unless we turn \r\nthe Assembly into the centre of discussion and \r\nmultilateral work.  \r\n The main problem in revitalizing the work of the \r\nGeneral Assembly is the lack of political will on the \r\npart of certain States that want to impose their narrow \r\npolitical interests over the majority democratic \r\nviewpoint of the international community. That is why \r\nthe revitalization of the Assembly is not a technical \r\nmatter, as some would have us believe, but an \r\nessentially political matter.  \r\n That is the key to raising such important issues as \r\nthe non-implementation of many General Assembly \r\nresolutions, which, although they collectively represent \r\na significant body of standards, remain inert in many \r\ncases. That situation also applies to the many \r\nA/65/PV.56  \r\n \r\n10-67395 8 \r\n \r\nresolutions on the revitalization of the Assembly, \r\nwhich have likewise seen limited implementation.  \r\n Special attention should be paid to the \r\nimplementation of resolutions and recommendations \r\nconcerning the election of the Secretary-General and to \r\nthe search for practical measures to ensure their \r\nenforcement. As we have said on other occasions, the \r\nwork of revitalizing the General Assembly cannot be \r\nlimited to speeches. The Assembly enjoys all the legal \r\nprerogatives to take action. We hope that in the course \r\nof this year the Ad Hoc Working Group will adopt a \r\nbroad and flexible working agenda, enabling us to \r\nachieve concrete results. \r\n We have to guarantee the appropriate balance \r\namong the principle organs of the United Nations, in \r\naccordance with its Charter. We are particularly \r\nconcerned by the frequent attempts by the Security \r\nCouncil to establish legal standards and definitions, \r\noverlooking the fact that according to Article 13 of the \r\nCharter it is the exclusive responsibility of the \r\nAssembly to encourage the progressive development of \r\ninternational law and its codification. Those dangerous \r\ntrends and attempts to broaden the Security Council’s \r\nagenda beyond its jurisdiction must be halted \r\nimmediately, because, among other reasons, they are \r\nclear violations of the United Nations Charter.  \r\n The General Assembly is the principle \r\ndeliberative, policymaking and most representative \r\nbody of the United Nations. It enjoys legitimacy and \r\nprestige due to its broad membership and democratic \r\ncharacter as the ultimate expression of the sovereign \r\nequality of States. The revitalization of its work is an \r\nissue of the utmost importance. \r\n Only a body with the characteristics of the \r\nGeneral Assembly can face up to today’s global \r\nproblems, which require more than the limited \r\ncapacities of any one State or even group of States, no \r\nmatter how strong they may believe themselves to be. \r\nGlobal problems call for global solutions, with the \r\nparticipation of everyone. If we fail in this, the price \r\ncould be the very existence of humankind. The General \r\nAssembly is the only body that can orchestrate such \r\nefforts. \r\n Mr. Hardeep Singh Puri (India): I am honoured \r\nto address the General Assembly on behalf of India at \r\ntoday’s joint debate. We believe that the issue of the \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly has assumed \r\nparticular significance in recent years. My delegation \r\nwas therefore encouraged by the theme chosen by you, \r\nMr. President, for the general debate at the sixty-fifth \r\nsession of the General Assembly in September this \r\nyear, namely, “Reaffirming the central role of the \r\nUnited Nations in global governance”. Indeed, we \r\nwould like to place on record our appreciation for that. \r\nWe also welcome your personal attention to matters of \r\nbadly needed institutional reform, in particular the \r\nreform of the Security Council and the revitalization of \r\nthe work of the General Assembly. \r\n The starting point of my delegation’s position on \r\nthe issue of revitalizing the General Assembly is the \r\nfirm belief that this will be possible only when the \r\nAssembly’s position as the chief deliberative, \r\npolicymaking and representative organ of the United \r\nNations is respected in both letter and spirit. The \r\nGeneral Assembly should take the lead in setting the \r\nglobal agenda and restoring the centrality of the United \r\nNations in formulating multilateral approaches to \r\nresolving transnational issues. This was the role \r\nintended for the Assembly under Article 10 of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations — that it discuss any \r\nquestions or matters within the scope of the present \r\nCharter or relating to the powers and functions of any \r\norgans provided for in the Charter, that is to say: the \r\nSecurity Council, the Economic and Social Council, \r\nthe Trusteeship Council and the International Court of \r\nJustice, as well as the Secretariat. \r\n My delegation participated actively in the \r\ndeliberations of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the \r\nRevitalization of the General Assembly at the sixty-\r\nfourth session. We provided a number of inputs at the \r\nmeetings held during the past session. Those inputs \r\nwere provided in a spirit of constructive engagement, \r\nand we are pleased that they were taken on board in the \r\nnegotiations leading to the adoption of resolution \r\n64/301. \r\n I am happy to place on record our appreciation \r\nfor the good work done by the co-Chairs of the Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group last year, Ambassadors Sanja Štiglic, \r\nof Slovenia, and Jorge Argüello, of Argentina. Equally, \r\nI would like to place on record my delegation’s \r\nappreciation for the work done by the Algerian \r\ndelegation as the Non-Aligned Movement chair on this \r\nissue, as well as for the other negotiating partners who \r\nworked in a spirit of cooperation. \r\n While we are generally happy that resolution \r\n64/301 has been able to highlight some of the \r\n A/65/PV.56\r\n \r\n9 10-67395 \r\n \r\nimportant steps required on our collective journey \r\ntowards a revitalized General Assembly, we firmly \r\nbelieve that we still have some distance to travel. \r\n Let me place on record my delegation’s resolve to \r\ncontinue to actively participate in the deliberations on \r\nthis issue in the current session. We are enthused by the \r\nfact that you, Mr. President, have chosen two \r\noutstanding and distinguished colleagues of mine, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Camillo Gonsalves, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, \r\nand His Excellency Mr. Dalius Čekuolis, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of the Republic of Lithuania, to \r\nco-chair this year’s Ad Hoc Working Group. They can \r\ncount on the Indian delegation as they go about their \r\nimportant task. \r\n Without prejudging the proceedings of the Ad \r\nHoc Working Group, which should start soon, I would \r\nlike to place on record the Indian delegation’s \r\nconsidered views on some important aspects of the \r\nissue of the revitalization of the General Assembly. \r\nFirst of all, it is critical that we establish a proper \r\nrelationship of respect for the respective mandates of \r\nthe General Assembly and the Security Council, in the \r\nspirit of the Charter. Here, it is particularly important \r\nthat the Council not encroach upon the mandate of the \r\nGeneral Assembly by making extremely wide and \r\npermissive interpretations of what constitutes a threat \r\nto international peace and security, a breach of the \r\npeace, an act of aggression or a situation in which it \r\ncan take action under Chapter VII of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n As we prepare to rejoin the Security Council after \r\na hiatus of 19 years, it is clear that the Council’s \r\nagenda is, to say the least, overburdened because it has \r\nanointed itself with the responsibility for dealing with \r\nissues that, although seemingly important, leave it with \r\nless time to deal with the real hotspots that constitute \r\nthe real threats to international peace and security. The \r\nbalance between the General Assembly and the Council \r\nis only one of the dimensions of what needs to be \r\naddressed. We propose to raise these issues in the Ad \r\nHoc Working Group. \r\n The Assembly must have a greater say in the \r\nprocess of selecting the Secretary-General. The \r\ncontinued circumscription of the Assembly’s role and \r\nresponsibilities in the process of the selection and \r\nappointment of the Secretary-General needs to change, \r\nin the interests of the United Nations system in general \r\nand the Assembly’s prerogatives in particular. As it was \r\nthe General Assembly that limited its own role, it will \r\nhave to be the Assembly that claws back its rightful \r\nplace in the process of selecting the Secretary-General. \r\n The Assembly and the other entities that form \r\npart of the United Nations system must reflect \r\ndiplomatic best practices in their day-to-day \r\nfunctioning. They have a lot to learn from Member \r\nStates in that regard. \r\n In conclusion, let me re-emphasize the need to \r\ndiscuss substantive measures that would strengthen the \r\nrole of General Assembly as the most representative \r\nand chief deliberative, legislative and policymaking \r\nbody at the disposal of the international community. \r\nThe General Assembly can expect India’s constructive \r\nsupport and participation in those efforts. \r\n Mrs. Dunlop (Brazil): At the outset, allow me to \r\nexpress our gratitude to Ambassadors Sanja Štiglic of \r\nSlovenia and Jorge Argüello of Argentina for their \r\ndiligent work at the helm of the Ad Hoc Working \r\nGroup on the Revitalization of the General Assembly \r\nduring the sixty-fourth session. Under their wise \r\nleadership, the General Assembly adopted resolution \r\n64/301, which represents an important step towards the \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly. We welcome its \r\nprovisions, especially in relation to the role of the \r\nGeneral Assembly in the process of the selection and \r\nappointment of the Secretary-General, the \r\nstrengthening of the institutional arrangements for the \r\nOffice of the President of the General Assembly and \r\nthe proposal to review the working methods of the \r\nplenary and the Main Committees. \r\n I would also like to extend a warm welcome to \r\nAmbassadors Camillo Gonsalves, of Saint Vincent and \r\nthe Grenadines, and Dalius Čekuolis, of Lithuania, as \r\nthe co-Chairs of the Working Group on the \r\nRevitalization of the General Assembly during the \r\npresent session. I pledge my delegation’s full support \r\nto them. \r\n As the most representative decision-making body \r\nof the United Nations, the General Assembly is the \r\nnatural political forum for the consideration of all \r\nrelevant issues on the international agenda. Its \r\nlegitimacy, drawn from the universal nature of its \r\nmembership and its democratic status, also confers \r\nupon the General Assembly a central role in overseeing \r\nthe implementation of the mandates accorded by \r\nMember States and the United Nations system. In our \r\nA/65/PV.56  \r\n \r\n10-67395 10 \r\n \r\nendeavours to improve and strengthen the multilateral \r\nsystem, it is vital to ensure the vigour, efficacy and \r\nrelevance of the work of the General Assembly. \r\n Brazil believes that the principal organs of the \r\nUnited Nations should work in close coordination and \r\nin a mutually reinforcing and integrated manner. \r\nFocusing solely on individual bodies and their \r\nfunctions and duties will not suffice. It is necessary to \r\npromote better coordination and collaboration among \r\nthem, in full compliance with the letter and the spirit of \r\nthe Charter. \r\n As we have previously noted, the Security \r\nCouncil’s work needs to be complemented by actions \r\nby the General Assembly, the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil and the Peacebuilding Commission in order \r\nfor the system to be fully effective. The General \r\nAssembly itself should do more to meet the global \r\nchallenges that beset the international community. The \r\nneed to improve the functioning of the governing \r\nbodies of the United Nations system is therefore \r\nincreasingly clear. It is crucial that the different \r\ngovernance entities of the system function not only in \r\nan integrated but also in a complementary manner. \r\n Enhancing the direct interaction between Member \r\nStates and the Secretariat should also be at the \r\nforefront of the process of the revitalization of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. More frequent and direct dialogue \r\nbetween the Assembly and internal system-wide \r\ncoordination mechanisms, such as the Chief Executives \r\nBoard, would be an important step in that direction. \r\n The role of the General Assembly in the process \r\nof selecting and appointing the Secretary-General \r\nshould reflect its position as the main governing body \r\nof the United Nations. We must build on existing \r\nresolutions in order to enhance the current procedure. \r\nThe full membership should have an opportunity to \r\nmeet and interact with prospective candidates in a \r\nstructured manner, prior to endorsement. \r\n Also, we would strongly support more in-depth \r\nconsideration of the role of the General Assembly with \r\nrespect to the procedures for selecting, appointing and \r\nconfirming the heads of major specialized agencies, \r\nfunds and programmes, with a view to ensuring greater \r\ntransparency and enhancing the participation of \r\nMember States. We believe that more balanced \r\nregional representation and rotation across senior \r\npositions within the United Nations system could be \r\nconsidered in the interest of the whole membership. \r\n Mr. Tashibayev (Kazakhstan): First of all, let me \r\nthank you, Mr. President, for organizing this joint \r\ndebate, which gives Member States an opportunity to \r\nreaffirm their commitment to strengthen the United \r\nNations with a view to enhancing its authority, \r\nefficiency and capacity to address effectively the full \r\nrange of global challenges through one of its key \r\ndeliberative and policymaking organs, namely, the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n In an ever increasingly complex world, with the \r\nescalating proliferation of pressing issues of an \r\nunprecedented nature, it is all the more imperative to \r\nrevitalize the role and authority of this body through \r\nthe political will and commitment of all Member States \r\nto enable it to perform optimally and to fully exercise \r\nthe power granted to it in the United Nations Charter. \r\nThe revitalization of the General Assembly is a core \r\nelement of the entire reform process of the United \r\nNations, which, in turn, would lead to the reform of its \r\nother main bodies and their working methods. \r\n Notwithstanding the equal division of functions \r\nof the three principal organs, as reflected in the United \r\nNations Charter, there continues to be debate about \r\ntheir relative powers based on different interpretations \r\nof the respective provisions described in the Charter. \r\n The costs of delay in strengthening the General \r\nAssembly are extremely high. On the other hand, \r\novercoming differences does not entail the same high \r\ntoll, and can be easily achieved through strong \r\ncollective political determination on the part of \r\nMember States. \r\n Kazakhstan takes note of measures to improve \r\nthe efficiency of the General Assembly. We wish to \r\nhighlight the work done thus far by the two co-Chairs, \r\nthe Permanent Representatives of Slovenia and \r\nArgentina. We are grateful for their detailed analysis of \r\nthe status of existing resolutions and decisions on \r\nrevitalizing the Assembly. \r\n Member States need to examine the General \r\nAssembly’s inadequate performance and offer a \r\nconstructive strategy for delivering results. \r\n A sound and professionally competent Secretariat \r\nis a sine qua non for implementing the \r\nrecommendations for revitalizing the General \r\nAssembly. It must therefore be staffed with the most \r\nqualified personnel to perform the multifarious tasks \r\ndemanded of it efficiently and effectively. \r\n A/65/PV.56\r\n \r\n11 10-67395 \r\n \r\n We commend the positive initiative of the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly to meet periodically \r\nwith the Presidents of the Security Council and the \r\nEconomic and Social Council, with a view to ensuring \r\nincreased cooperation, coordination and synergy in the \r\nwork of the three key organs. We would also like to \r\nacknowledge the proactive stance taken in recent years \r\nby former Presidents of the General Assembly in \r\naddressing critical global issues through thematic \r\ndebates and informal plenary meetings. We expect that \r\nthe President of the sixty-fifth session will lead \r\nconstructive intergovernmental negotiations on the \r\nreform of the Security Council, which is one of the \r\nmost vital issues in the process of reforming the entire \r\nOrganization. \r\n Other welcome measures include Main \r\nCommittees’ use of interactive debates, panel \r\ndiscussions and question periods to enhance informal \r\nand in-depth deliberations and bring together experts \r\nfrom various fields. These have enabled a dynamic and \r\ncandid exchange of views between heads of \r\ndepartments and offices, representatives of the \r\nSecretary-General and special rapporteurs, thereby \r\nenriching the decision-making processes of the Main \r\nCommittees. However, we are of the view that those \r\ninitiatives should not replace reforms aimed, first and \r\nforemost, at strengthening the authority of the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n My delegation has repeatedly voiced strong \r\nsupport for a greater role for the General Assembly — \r\nthrough debates among Member States — in the \r\nprocess of selecting the Secretary-General, as well as \r\nfor the establishment of a procedure to require \r\ncandidates to present their views before the entire \r\nAssembly. \r\n In June 2010, Member States welcomed the \r\nPresident’s proposal to the Ad Hoc Working Group on \r\nthe Revitalization of the General Assembly on \r\nstrengthening the institutional memory of his Office. \r\nDuring a thematic meeting held on 18 June, \r\nKazakhstan supported the President’s proposal to \r\nreview the budgetary allocation for that purpose — \r\nincluding a regular budget for staffing, protocol, safety \r\nand security and other pertinent requirements — and to \r\nconsider establishing a trust fund. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n We need to continue to analyse the reasons that \r\nthe resolutions that have been adopted on the \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly have not been \r\nimplemented. Resolution 64/301, which has just been \r\nadopted, is the second substantive resolution on the \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly in the span of a \r\nfew years. It addresses most of the issues that we have \r\ntaken up and includes our conclusions. In adopting that \r\ndocument, we welcomed the tenacity and expertise of \r\nthe co-Chairs and the goodwill of the many delegations \r\nthat made the resolution possible. \r\n We need to raise the profile of the work of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. We must continue to look into the \r\nreasons for the seeming lack of interest in the work of \r\nthe Assembly on the part of the public by proposing \r\ncooperation with major media outlets and by using \r\nmodern communication technologies.  \r\n(spoke in English) \r\nWe endorse and call for enhancing public awareness of \r\nthe work and decisions of the Assembly through \r\nintensive mass media outreach, supported by greater \r\ndocumentation and new technologies. Of equal priority \r\nare the General Assembly’s relationship with the \r\nSecretariat and the need to focus on devising voting \r\nand balloting options and processes that are more time-\r\neffective, reliable, efficient and secure. \r\n My delegation would like to conclude by \r\nexpressing its hope that concrete and significant \r\nprogress on revitalizing the General Assembly will be \r\nachieved during the sixty-fifth session. \r\n Mrs. Kolontai (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): \r\nRevitalizing the work of the General Assembly \r\ncontinues to be a relevant issue and a priority for the \r\ndelegation of the Republic of Belarus. Our common \r\nefforts are geared towards strengthening the role and \r\nstatus of the General Assembly as the main \r\ndeliberative, guiding and representative body of the \r\nUnited Nations. We believe that it is necessary to focus \r\non creating conditions conducive to enhancing the \r\neffectiveness of the General Assembly and bringing its \r\nmandate into line with the requirements of the times \r\nand the international situation. \r\n The delegation of Belarus welcomes the report \r\n(A/64/903) of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the \r\nRevitalization of the General Assembly and the \r\noutcomes of the Group’s work during the sixty-fourth \r\nsession. We believe that, in order to take advantage of \r\nthe progress made in past years, we must define new \r\napproaches during this session to strengthen the role, \r\nA/65/PV.56  \r\n \r\n10-67395 12 \r\n \r\nauthority, efficiency and effectiveness of the Assembly \r\non the basis, among other things, of the resolutions that \r\nhave been adopted and the assessments of their \r\nimplementation. \r\n We share the view set out in the Group’s report \r\nthat the revitalization of the work of the General \r\nAssembly is primarily a political issue that requires \r\nMember States to show the necessary will to make the \r\nanticipated changes. We wish to note the important role \r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement in the negotiating \r\nprocess on the revitalization of the Assembly’s work \r\nand the development of constructive decisions.  \r\n In general, efforts in recent years to enhance the \r\nwork of the General Assembly are starting to bear fruit. \r\nThematic debates and interactive dialogues of the \r\nAssembly are held regularly on current international \r\nissues that are of particular relevance to Member \r\nStates. The delegation of Belarus welcomes the timely \r\ncirculation by the President of the Assembly at its \r\nsixty-fifth session of a list of debates to be held in the \r\ncontext of this session. In our opinion, that practice \r\nshould be retained in the future. Moreover, we believe \r\nthat it would be useful for the President to hold \r\nconsultations with Member States on the selection of \r\ntopics to be considered.  \r\n Significant attention has begun to be paid to \r\nimproving the working relationship with other \r\nprincipal bodies, including the Security Council and \r\nthe Secretariat. Monthly meetings are held with the \r\nparticipation of the President of the Assembly and the \r\nrotating presidency of the Security Council, during \r\nwhich the President of the Assembly regularly briefs \r\nmembers of the Organization. The periodic briefings \r\nby the Secretary-General on his work in the context of \r\ninformal plenary meetings are proof of the enhanced \r\nwork of the General Assembly and the importance of \r\nits role and status.  \r\n The activities of the President and of the \r\nAssembly itself are now more transparent and receive \r\nmore attention in countries’ mass media. Among other \r\nthings, increased transparency has facilitated the \r\norganization of meetings between the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and regional groups, which has \r\nfacilitated exchanges of opinion on the priority issues \r\nof the sixty-fifth session, its working methods and the \r\ninteraction between Member States and the President \r\nand his Office. We believe that that practice should be \r\ndeveloped in the future.   \r\n However, much still remains to be done. The \r\ndelegation of Belarus supports further strengthening \r\nthe role of the President, improving the working \r\nmethods of the Assembly and the mechanisms for \r\nselecting the Secretary-General and modernizing the \r\nvoting system, thereby ensuring effectiveness and \r\ntransparency in the work of the Assembly. We support \r\nfurther analysis and review of the implementation of \r\nthe resolutions on the revitalization of the work of the \r\nGeneral Assembly in order to identify and focus on \r\nelements that continue to hamper our work. \r\n The Republic of Belarus considers the activities \r\nof the Special Committee on the Charter of the United \r\nNations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the \r\nOrganization to be an important tool for the \r\nrevitalization of the work of the General Assembly and \r\nthe reform of the United Nations. We firmly believe \r\nthat, as a universal and democratic forum, the \r\nCommittee should be at the centre of activities related \r\nto the legal aspects of United Nations reform. The \r\ndelegation of Belarus believes that it is now high time \r\nto ensure the substantive content of the work of the \r\nCommittee in order to improve its effectiveness and \r\nmeet Member States’ expectations, namely, ensuring \r\nthe legal elements of the revitalization of the work of \r\nthe General Assembly and United Nations reform as a \r\nwhole. \r\n The delegation of Belarus is consistent in its \r\nposition that strengthening the role of the General \r\nAssembly should in no way infringe upon the role and \r\npowers of the Security Council and the other principle \r\norgans of the United Nations. Strengthening that role is \r\na logical step in the development and democratization \r\nof the United Nations. Improving the functional \r\ninteraction between the Security Council, the \r\nEconomic and Social Council and the General \r\nAssembly and preventing the duplication of work will \r\ncertainly have a positive impact on the efforts of the \r\nUnited Nations to give effect to its main principles and \r\npurposes. \r\n Many delegations have today underscored the \r\nprogress made towards revitalizing the work on the \r\nGeneral Assembly. That is certainly a positive element. \r\nMany Member States have also expressed their \r\nreadiness to continue to work jointly on the issue. All \r\nthat gives us hope that we are on the right track. At the \r\nsame time, we must not waste time. We believe that \r\nonly the joint energetic and effective efforts of Member \r\nStates will help us to achieve, on the basis of the \r\n A/65/PV.56\r\n \r\n13 10-67395 \r\n \r\nUnited Nations Charter, the goal of strengthening the \r\nrole and status of the General Assembly and, thereby, \r\nthat of the entire Organization. \r\n Mr. Ang (Singapore): Darwin’s law of natural \r\nselection, commonly known as the survival of the \r\nfittest, emphasized the need for constant adaptation and \r\nevolution by species to suit the changing environment \r\nor face the possibility of elimination and extinction. \r\nThe General Assembly, too, must endeavour to \r\ndemonstrate its relevance and adapt to changes and \r\nchallenges in the global environment. \r\n The world faced many global challenges last year. \r\nAmong others, the economic crisis and the influenza A \r\n(H1N1) pandemic were acute examples of how dangers \r\ntoday have a global reach and impact. Even as the \r\nUnited Nations debates whether it has a role to play in \r\ndealing with those crises, it is telling that the delivery \r\nof the General Assembly’s core expertise — \r\ndevelopment assistance — has yet to achieve real \r\neffectiveness. The Least Developed Countries Report \r\n2010 of the United Nations Conference on Trade and \r\nDevelopment, which was just published on  \r\n25 November, showed that the number of least \r\ndeveloped countries had doubled over the past 30 \r\nyears, with 421 million people living below the poverty \r\nline in 2007. That is a sober reminder that the United \r\nNations must do better to meet long-standing and new \r\nchallenges, as they affect the struggle of the United \r\nNations to find its role in providing global governance \r\nand leadership. The reform and strengthening of the \r\nGeneral Assembly cannot be more timely or urgent.  \r\n We must remember that we are the United \r\nNations. United means that all 192 Member States are \r\nbound by common goals and a shared vision of peace \r\nand security, sustainable development and human \r\nrights, which make up the three pillars of the United \r\nNations. The General Assembly should not create \r\nartificial divisions between “them” and “us”, whether \r\nbased on region or development status. We need to \r\nconstantly remind ourselves of the need to work \r\ntowards the common goals we set out to achieve in the \r\nfirst place. We need to continually repeat to ourselves \r\nthe necessity for prospering thy neighbour. The recent \r\nglobal economic crisis and A (H1N1) pandemic are \r\nstark reminders that we live in an increasingly \r\ninterconnected and interdependent world. \r\n The word “nations” means that the General \r\nAssembly provides a level playing field for all Member \r\nStates. It places large countries alongside, and on equal \r\nterms with, small and medium-sized ones. The beauty \r\nof universal multilateralism lies in giving each nation \r\nan equal voice. That right to an equal voice must be \r\npreserved. “United Nations” therefore means that all \r\nnations, regardless of size, must pull together in \r\nsolidarity at all times. In delivering his report on the \r\nwork of the Organization (A/65/1) in September, the \r\nSecretary-General said that “the soul of global \r\ngovernance” is “a collective stand, principled and \r\npragmatic, against forces that would divide us” \r\n(A/65/PV.11, p. 1). Regardless of which other organizations \r\nor institutions we belong to, we must continue to proudly \r\nwear our badges as Member States of the United \r\nNations, and remember the reasons that first made us \r\npart of it. \r\n In order to be effective, resolutions passed by the \r\nOrganization need teeth, and the General Assembly \r\nmust be empowered to ensure their implementation. \r\nEach year, we gather together and spend many hours \r\nseeking consensus, which means the lowest common \r\ndenominator among us; and each year, we go around in \r\ncircles discussing the same issues with little progress. \r\nThat cannot be the aim of our work. Resolutions should \r\nhave clear action plans and realistic timelines. Most \r\nimportant, there needs to be a responsible commitment \r\nto action on the part of all Member States. The \r\nAssembly’s agenda should also be reviewed and \r\nrefreshed regularly to ensure its continued relevance. \r\nMember States should regularly review resolutions that \r\nare traditionally introduced in the Assembly, to ensure \r\nthat the items they address are of continued relevance \r\nand importance. \r\n There has been much talk here about cooperation \r\nwith other bodies such as regional communities, \r\nassociations and organizations. However, we should \r\nfirst consider whether the United Nations is a valuable \r\npartner for such organizations before we think of \r\nstrengthening partnerships with them. We need to get \r\nour own house in order. The General Assembly must \r\nadd value and concentrate on issues in which it \r\npossesses comparative advantages. This would result in \r\ngreater efficiency in the multilateral process, including \r\nat the United Nations itself. \r\n While we are on the topic of reform, we cannot \r\nignore that the heart of reform lies in strengthening the \r\nrelationship between the General Assembly and the \r\nSecurity Council. My delegation has stressed on many \r\noccasions the need for decision-making to be inclusive, \r\nA/65/PV.56  \r\n \r\n10-67395 14 \r\n \r\nparticipatory and representative of all Member States. \r\nThat is the value of the Assembly, where we are all \r\nequals. Under the Charter, the Security Council is part \r\nof the United Nations and is bound to work towards its \r\ngoals. The Council is neither supernumerary to the \r\nUnited Nations nor a body standing in isolated \r\nsplendour apart from it. In order to more effectively \r\nachieve its goals and its duties to Member States, it \r\nmust be transparent and inclusive, with early and \r\nincreased consultation with, and the participation of, \r\nall Member States. Better cooperation between the \r\nCouncil and the Assembly will strengthen our \r\ncapacities and improve the delivery of United Nations \r\nservices to people in need. \r\n In tune with the theme for this year, it is my \r\ndelegation’s hope that the General Assembly will \r\ncontinue to remain a strong voice in global governance \r\nfor many years to come. In the fight for the survival of \r\nthe fittest, the Assembly must go from strength to \r\nstrength and become a truly indispensable global \r\ninstitution of the twenty-first century. \r\n Mr. Sumi (Japan): At the outset, allow me to \r\nexpress my gratitude to His Excellency Ambassador \r\nJoseph Deiss, President of the General Assembly, for \r\nconvening today’s meeting to discuss one of the most \r\ncrucial tasks on the Assembly’s agenda, namely, the \r\nrevitalization of its work. I also wish to thank the \r\nco-Chairs of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the \r\nRevitalization of the General Assembly at the previous \r\nsession, Ms. Sanja Štiglic and Mr. Jorge Argüello, the \r\nPermanent Representatives of Slovenia and Argentina, \r\nfor their excellent report contained in document \r\nA/64/903 and their work on resolution 64/301. I also \r\nextend a warm welcome to the now co-Chairs of this \r\nprocess, Mr. Dalius Čekuolis and Mr. Camillo \r\nGonsalves, the Permanent Representatives of Lithuania \r\nand Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, with whom I \r\nintend to cooperate closely in order to move forward \r\nour work on the most pressing issues. \r\n The General Assembly, where all Member States \r\nparticipate, is the most representative organ of the \r\nUnited Nations. Except under the circumstances \r\ndescribed in Article 12, paragraph 1, of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations, the General Assembly is \r\nempowered to address all issues and questions that fall \r\nunder the responsibilities assigned to it by the Charter. \r\nJapan has devoted serious effort to advancing the \r\nprocess of revitalizing the Assembly and continues to \r\ncontribute to the activities directed to that end. \r\n It is our firm hope that the relationship between \r\nthe General Assembly and the other principal organs of \r\nthe United Nations — the Security Council and the \r\nEconomic and Social Council — and mutual \r\ncoordination between them will be further enhanced \r\nand strengthened as the revitalization process goes \r\nforward. \r\n Japan greatly appreciates the submission of \r\nannual reports by the Security Council to the General \r\nAssembly and the regular consultations between the \r\nPresidents of the Council and the Assembly. We \r\nwelcomed this year’s report of the Council (A/65/2), \r\nprepared by Nigeria, and commended that country’s \r\nefforts to interact with non-Council members in the \r\nreport’s preparation. As urged in resolution 64/301, \r\nsuch interaction has taken place more often in recent \r\nyears. In addition, this year’s report was prepared in \r\nline with the Council President’s note (S/2010/507) on \r\nthat body’s working methods. \r\n In selecting the Secretary-General, the United \r\nNations Charter clearly provides distinct roles and \r\nresponsibilities for the Council and the Assembly. In \r\nthat context, we should focus our discussions on the \r\nrole of the Assembly in ensuring the transparency of \r\nthe process and taking into account past Assembly \r\nresolutions and existing practices. In that regard, Japan \r\nwould like to recall paragraph 60 of resolution 51/241, \r\nwhich states: \r\n  “Without prejudice to the prerogatives of \r\nthe Security Council, the President of the General \r\nAssembly may consult with Member States to \r\nidentify potential candidates endorsed by a \r\nMember State and, upon informing all Member \r\nStates of the results, may forward those results to \r\nthe Security Council.” \r\n In addition, in paragraph 20 of resolution 60/286, \r\nthe General Assembly \r\n  “Also encourage[d] formal presentation of \r\ncandidatures for the position of Secretary-General \r\nin a manner that allow[ed] sufficient time for \r\ninteraction with Member States, and request[ed] \r\ncandidates to present their views to all States \r\nmembers of the General Assembly”. \r\nIn following up on resolution 64/301, it would be \r\nuseful to take stock of past experiences with regard to \r\nthe implementation of those General Assembly \r\nresolutions in order to facilitate our discussion.  \r\n A/65/PV.56\r\n \r\n15 10-67395 \r\n \r\n We are well aware of the necessity of \r\nstrengthening the institutional memory of the Office of \r\nthe President of the General Assembly and have \r\nwelcomed the efforts deployed by the current and past \r\nPresidents of the General Assembly to reinforce the \r\nrole and functions of the President and the Office. \r\nRecognizing the importance of the issue, Japan is \r\nprepared to join in further discussions as to how to \r\nrealize that objective in an efficient and cost-effective \r\nmanner within the proposed programme budget for the \r\nbiennium 2012-2013. \r\n At the sixty-fourth session of the General \r\nAssembly, we also discussed strategies that the \r\nAssembly could apply to raise public awareness \r\nconcerning its activities. Possible ideas were presented, \r\nsuch as strengthening the relationship with the \r\nDepartment of Public Information or the United \r\nNations Correspondents Association. However, it is \r\nJapan’s position that the most critical way to enhance \r\nthe visibility of the General Assembly is for it to work \r\neffectively towards addressing the world’s challenges. \r\nAt the same time, we need to provide the press with \r\naccurate information on topics of interest to it. As we \r\nare all aware, the President of the Security Council \r\nparticipates in press stakeouts after almost every \r\nconsultation. Accordingly, in order to raise the profile \r\nof the work of the General Assembly, the President of \r\nthe Assembly, the Chairs of the Main Committees and \r\nother interested parties, such as the facilitators of \r\nparticular events or resolutions, should perhaps be \r\nencouraged to address the press at stakeouts more \r\nfrequently and hold more frequent press conferences. \r\n Looking forward to constructive and fruitful \r\ndiscussions in the Ad Hoc Working Group meetings to \r\nbe convened by the co-facilitators, my delegation \r\nreiterates its commitment to contributing to the \r\nrevitalization of the work of the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Mashabane (South Africa): Our delegation \r\naligns itself with the statement delivered by the \r\nPermanent Representative of Algeria, who spoke in his \r\ncapacity as coordinator of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement’s working group on the revitalization of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n South Africa joins other delegations in expressing \r\nsincere gratitude to the Ambassadors of Slovenia and \r\nArgentina, who so ably facilitated the work of the Ad \r\nHoc Working Group on the Revitalization of the \r\nGeneral Assembly during the sixty-fourth session. \r\nTheir patient leadership made it possible for the \r\nWorking Group to adopt a substantive resolution on the \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly during that \r\nsession. \r\n Similarly, my delegation further wishes to convey \r\nits congratulations to the Permanent Representatives of \r\nLithuania and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines on \r\ntheir appointment as co-Chairs of the Ad Hoc Working \r\nGroup on the Revitalization of the General Assembly \r\nfor the sixty-fifth session. \r\n South Africa will continue to participate actively \r\nin the deliberations of the Working Group, with the aim \r\nof making the General Assembly more democratic, \r\ntransparent and responsive. My delegation will also \r\nwork with the President in an effort to ensure that the \r\nAd Hoc Working Group delivers concrete results. \r\n The President has set as the theme for our work at \r\nthis sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly \r\n“Reaffirming the central role of the United Nations in \r\nglobal governance”. As our Minister of International \r\nRelations and Cooperation, Ms. Nkoana-Mashabane, \r\nsaid in her statement during the general debate in \r\nSeptember 2010, our delegation  \r\n “supports the choice of this theme, and we wish \r\nto reiterate our belief in the centrality of the \r\nUnited Nations and the system of multilateralism.  \r\n  “Despite the challenges that face humanity \r\nin the twenty-first century, the relevance of the \r\nUnited Nations as a multilateral mechanism \r\nthrough which a myriad of complex world affairs \r\ncan be administered and resolved cannot be \r\noveremphasized” (A/65/PV.17, p. 26). \r\n It is our view that the  full reform of the United \r\nNations cannot be achieved without the proper and \r\neffective revitalization of the General Assembly. This \r\nbody is the chief deliberative, policymaking and \r\nrepresentative organ of the United Nations and fulfils a \r\ncritical role in the codification of international law. It is \r\nhere where the principle of the sovereign equality of \r\nStates, on which the United Nations was founded, finds \r\nits clearest expression. \r\n The General Assembly is the only universally \r\nrepresentative body in the world and it therefore has \r\nthe specific responsibility of addressing the challenges \r\nwe face. In our work to revitalize this body, our aim \r\nshould be to ensure the effectiveness of the General \r\nAssembly in representing the world’s population and in \r\nA/65/PV.56  \r\n \r\n10-67395 16 \r\n \r\naddressing their needs, especially those of the most \r\nvulnerable.  \r\n That is also true with regard to the role of the \r\nGeneral Assembly in the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security. There have been several occasions \r\nover the past years where the General Assembly has \r\nacted promptly in matters of international peace and \r\nsecurity. We would urge the Assembly to remain \r\nvigilant in these matters and to act when the Security \r\nCouncil fails, which can be done without the Assembly \r\nusurping the mandate of the Council. \r\n If we are going to be successful in reasserting the \r\ncentral role of the United Nations, meaningful reform \r\nof the Organization, including the Security Council, \r\nhas to be introduced as a matter of urgency. We \r\ntherefore call on this body to ensure that the reform \r\nhappens sooner than later. \r\n Turning to the report (A/64/903) of the Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group, my delegation was pleased that the \r\nsixty-fourth session of the General Assembly was able \r\nto adopt the report of the Working Group along with \r\nresolution 64/301, earlier this year. We were \r\nparticularly pleased that the resolution is the first \r\nsubstantive resolution on the revitalization of the \r\nGeneral Assembly in almost five years. \r\n The resolution adopted in September addresses \r\nseveral areas of importance, namely, the role and \r\nauthority of the General Assembly, the role of the \r\nGeneral Assembly in the selection and appointment of \r\nthe Secretary-General, the strengthening of the \r\ninstitutional memory of the Office of the President of \r\nthe General Assembly, and the working methods of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. We can accelerate the revitalization \r\nof the Assembly by redoubling our efforts to \r\nimplement the many important recommendations \r\ncontained in the resolution in all four of those \r\ncategories. \r\n South Africa emphasizes that the General \r\nAssembly has a central role to play in the appointment \r\nof the Secretary-General. We urge Security Council \r\nmembers to implement the recommendations we \r\nadopted in resolution 64/301, especially the decision to \r\nallow the General Assembly sufficient time and \r\nopportunity to engage with all the candidates being \r\nconsidered by the Security Council in its selection \r\nprocess.  \r\n With regard to the forthcoming session of the Ad \r\nHoc Working Group, we reiterate the call made by the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement that the work schedule of the \r\nWorking Group needs to allow enough time for \r\ninteractive discussion on the issues before it so that it \r\ncan conclude its work in a timely manner. That will \r\nallow the Working Group to move its agenda forward \r\nand be in a position to adopt a substantial report and a \r\nsubstantive resolution at the conclusion of its work. \r\nSuch a resolution must move the revitalization process \r\nforward by adopting positions that are concrete and \r\npractical. \r\n In our view, one area that can be improved upon, \r\nin addition to the four categories addressed in \r\nresolution 64/301, is the review of the implementation \r\nof General Assembly resolutions. We have noted \r\nimprovements with regard to the reporting on the \r\nimplementation of resolutions, and we will work with \r\nour partners in the Working Group to look at ways of \r\nfurther improving the implementation of resolutions \r\nand the review of agenda items in the sixty-fifth \r\nsession. \r\n In conclusion, we believe that the General \r\nAssembly has not always leveraged its strengths in \r\nservice of the people we represent. It is therefore my \r\ndelegation’s aim, in collaborating with our partners in \r\nthe Ad Hoc Working Group, to identify areas where the \r\nwork of the General Assembly can be improved upon \r\nand made more effective. \r\n Mr. Park Chul-min (Republic of Korea): Let me \r\nbegin by thanking you, Mr. President, for convening \r\nthis debate and for providing the membership with an \r\nopportunity to consider the revitalization of the \r\nGeneral Assembly during the sixty-fifth session. \r\n I would also like to congratulate the new \r\nco-Chairs, Ambassador Dalius Čekuolis, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of the Republic of Lithuania, and \r\nAmbassador Camillo Gonsalves, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. \r\n At the same time, I would like to express our \r\ngratitude to the two outgoing co-Chairs of the Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group, Ambassador Sanja Štiglic, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Slovenia, and Ambassador Jorge \r\nArgüello, Permanent Representative of Argentina, for \r\ntheir excellent work during the past session. \r\n The 2004 High-level Panel on Threats, \r\nChallenges and Changes concluded that the General \r\n A/65/PV.56\r\n \r\n17 10-67395 \r\n \r\nAssembly had lost its vitality and often failed to focus \r\neffectively on the most compelling issues of the day. \r\nWe should note, however, that the 2005 World Summit \r\nOutcome Document (resolution 60/1) acknowledged \r\nthe central position of the General Assembly as the \r\nchief deliberative, policymaking and representative \r\norgan of the United Nations. Indeed, my delegation \r\nbelieves that the General Assembly should be \r\nrevitalized, so that it can properly play its intended \r\nrole, as acknowledged in the 2005 World Summit \r\nOutcome Document. \r\n First, my delegation shares the view that more \r\nefforts are required to thoroughly review existing \r\nresolutions. Every year many resolutions are adopted, \r\nbut many of them are not substantially different from \r\nprevious resolutions. Many texts have not been \r\nsignificantly revised in decades. Therefore, we should \r\nexamine what has been achieved so far and what \r\nremains to be done. \r\n In that regard, the inventory chart developed at \r\nthe sixty-second and sixty-third sessions would be a \r\ngood base from which to start. My delegation believes \r\nthat, by updating the chart on a regular basis, we would \r\nbe able to easily identify areas that need further \r\nimplementation. \r\n Furthermore, the possibility of further \r\nbiennialization, triennialization, clustering and \r\nelimination of items on the agenda of the General \r\nAssembly should be explored in detail. \r\n Secondly, my delegation supports the idea of \r\norganizing the General Assembly agenda around a \r\nnumber of thematic issues with a view towards more \r\nin-depth discussions. Thematic debates should focus on \r\nthe most pressing contemporary challenges to the \r\npublic interest and should produce more action-\r\noriented results. \r\n Furthermore, we would like to encourage the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly to work closely \r\nwith Member States to decide specific themes and set \r\nthe calendar of thematic debates in a more transparent \r\nand effective manner. We would also like to suggest \r\nthat the General Assembly should undertake a review \r\nprocess examining past thematic debates so as to \r\nevaluate how much value has been added so far. That \r\nwould provide us with a guide in preparing the future \r\nthematic debates in a more streamlined and productive \r\nmanner. \r\n Thirdly, my delegation welcomes the actions to \r\nstrengthen the authority and functionality of the \r\nGeneral Assembly by strengthening its \r\ninterrelationships with other principal United Nations \r\norgans, such as the Security Council and the Economic \r\nand Social Council. \r\n To that end, the General Assembly needs to \r\ncoordinate the agendas and thematic debate items of all \r\nUnited Nations organs through regular and \r\ninstitutionalized consultations. That would make the \r\nGeneral Assembly a more meaningful venue for \r\ndiscussion and also enhance organizational synergy by \r\navoiding the duplication and repetition of discussions. \r\n In that connection, we would like to encourage \r\nthe President of the General Assembly to meet \r\nperiodically with the Secretary-General, the Presidents \r\nof the Security Council and the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil, and the Chairs of the Main Committees and \r\nthen share the outcomes of those interactions with \r\nMember States. In that regard, we support the practical \r\ninitiative of the Secretary-General to provide timely \r\nbriefings for the General Assembly on his activities \r\nand the work of the United Nations. \r\n Fourthly, having held the presidency of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-sixth session, the \r\nRepublic of Korea has a particular interest in \r\nstrengthening the role and authority of the Office of the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly. My delegation \r\nbelieves that ensuring the effectiveness of the Office, \r\nincluding through the strengthening of its institutional \r\nmemory, is important, particularly given the short term \r\nof the President of the General Assembly and the \r\nlimited number of long-term staff. \r\n My delegation therefore supports the idea of the \r\nincumbent President submitting a report to the \r\nPresident-elect, including specific recommendations \r\nand lessons learned during the previous session. \r\n In conclusion, my delegation wishes to stress that \r\nthe revitalization of the work of the General Assembly \r\nshould be a continuous and action-oriented process. \r\nMy delegation looks forward to tangible results from \r\nthe Ad Hoc Working Group on the Revitalization of the \r\nGeneral Assembly during the current session, and I \r\nassure you, Mr. President, of our full cooperation and \r\nsupport for the successful completion of that \r\nendeavour. \r\nA/65/PV.56  \r\n \r\n10-67395 18 \r\n \r\n Mr. Haroon (Pakistan): I wish to felicitate \r\nMr. Dalius Čekuolis, Permanent Representative of the \r\nRepublic of Lithuania, and Mr. Camillo Gonsalves, \r\nPermanent Representative of Saint Vincent and the \r\nGrenadines, for their appointment as co-Chairs of the \r\nAd Hoc Working Group on the Revitalization of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. We assure them of our fullest \r\ncooperation in achieving our shared objectives. \r\n As the principal deliberative, policymaking, \r\nnorm-setting and only truly universal and democratic \r\nbody of the United Nations, the General Assembly’s \r\nstatus should be unquestioned. It is, however, an \r\nabiding irony that the only universal principal organ of \r\nthe United Nations that can be regarded the world \r\nparliament is engaged in a seemingly endless exercise \r\nto have its status recognized adequately. The realities \r\non the ground being what they are, we would be doing \r\na disservice to the General Assembly by downplaying \r\nthe problem or by thinking that lip service is a \r\nsubstitute for concrete action. \r\n What emerges, inter alia, from the deliberations \r\nof the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Revitalization of \r\nthe General Assembly is that a number of resolutions \r\nrelated to the revitalization of the General Assembly \r\nhave been implemented, since their implementation \r\nrequired either one-time action or merely procedural \r\nadjustments. That should not, however, lull us into \r\nbelieving that some momentous progress has been \r\nmade. Polemics and palliatives notwithstanding, the \r\nfact remains that the General Assembly does not enjoy \r\nits rightful place in the scheme of things. \r\n At the same time, the Assembly is quite content \r\nwith the pro forma exercise of the Ad Hoc Working \r\nGroup’s deliberations, which culminate in an annual \r\nresolution, while practical progress remains elusive. \r\nThat brings us to the heart of the matter, which is that, \r\nin the absence of genuine political will, General \r\nAssembly revitalization will continue to be an exercise \r\nreplete with clichés, while offering little in terms of \r\nsubstance. One cannot help discern a perennial \r\nperceptual gap, if not a chasm, between different \r\nstakeholders. While the General Assembly rightly \r\ncomplains of erosion in its status and power, the \r\nSecurity Council evidently feels that the General \r\nAssembly should not impinge upon its domain.  \r\n Some issues that fall entirely within the General \r\nAssembly’s domain have now been taken up by the \r\nSecurity Council. Some feel that the General Assembly \r\nshould conform to a corporate model of productivity \r\nand efficiency in order to be considered a worthwhile \r\norganization. Needless to say, that is not why the \r\nUnited Nations was formed or conceived. Differences \r\nin perception and difficulties notwithstanding, the \r\nGeneral Assembly alone offers a forum whose \r\ndeliberations can boast of being of universal character. \r\nIn today’s highly interconnected and interdependent \r\nworld it is all the more necessary to strengthen the \r\nGeneral Assembly and ensure that participation in this \r\nbody is equitable and across the board. \r\n With regard to the implementation of resolutions \r\nrelated to revitalization, the Ad Hoc Working Group \r\nshould concentrate on areas that require action. There \r\nshould be a special unit in the Office of the President \r\nof the General Assembly to assess the status of the \r\nimplementation of the various resolutions in the \r\nintersessional period. \r\n The much vaunted rationalization of the General \r\nAssembly’s work should be approached with caution. \r\nThe General Assembly’s agenda should remain open to \r\nthe  insertion of new items and new thoughts. Divisive \r\nand arbitrary concepts like the sunset clause should be \r\neschewed and removed. In any event, no item should \r\nbe considered for deletion from an agenda without the \r\nexpress agreement of concerned States. \r\n As for the selection of the Secretary-General, \r\nthere is a need to find a middle road between the \r\nGeneral Assembly’s desire to have a greater role and \r\nthe requirements of Article 97 of the United Nations \r\nCharter. We must remember that whoever makes the \r\nappointment ultimately should be sure that the person \r\nconcerned will reflect on what is being put before him. \r\n On the question of strengthening the Office of the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly, we have noted with \r\ninterest, Sir, the recommendations given by your \r\npredecessor, Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki. It would be \r\nbeneficial if those issues were examined by a group \r\nconsisting of the outgoing, incumbent and future \r\nGeneral Assembly Presidents. In any event, the \r\nPresident of the premier United Nations organ should \r\nnot be handicapped by inadequate budgetary and \r\nhuman resources. At the same time, strengthening the \r\ninstitutional memory of the Office of the President of \r\nthe General Assembly should not unduly constrain \r\nflexibility in the selection of staff by the incoming \r\nPresident of the General Assembly. \r\n A/65/PV.56\r\n \r\n19 10-67395 \r\n \r\n In conclusion, I would like to stress that General \r\nAssembly revitalization should be a high priority for \r\nmembers of the General Assembly in general and \r\ndeveloping countries, including my own, in particular. \r\nWe are convinced that a balanced relationship between \r\nthe various organs of the United Nations will enable us \r\nto move beyond procedural wrangling and tackle the \r\nvexing questions that beset humanity, including peace \r\nand security, disarmament, development, poverty \r\nalleviation, disease control, climate change and the \r\nmany other issues that daunt the world today and make \r\nus believe that it will never change. \r\n Mrs. Morgan Sotomayor (Mexico) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): Mexico welcomes the report of the Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group on the Revitalization of the General \r\nAssembly (A/64/903) and notes the excellent work of \r\nthe co-Chairs, Permanent Representatives Ms. Sanja \r\nŠtiglic of Slovenia and Mr. Jorge Argüello of \r\nArgentina. Similarly, my delegation welcomes the \r\nadoption of resolution 64/301 in September, in which \r\nwe established the Ad Hoc Working Group on the \r\nRevitalization of the General Assembly for the sixty-\r\nfifth session of the Assembly. We congratulate \r\nMr. Camillo Gonsalves, Permanent Representative of \r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Mr. Dalius \r\nČekuolis, Permanent Representative of Lithuania, on \r\ntheir appointment as co-Chairs for the current session. \r\n Mexico devotes special attention to strengthening \r\nthe General Assembly as the universal body par \r\nexcellence and the main forum for the adoption of \r\ninternational standards. It is certain that revitalizing \r\nand strengthening this body require the political will of \r\nMember States as well as their commitment to produce \r\nsubstantive results in the short term. My delegation \r\nnotes that there has been progress made in that area. It \r\nis disturbing, however, that important issues remain \r\nunresolved in the area of revitalizing and strengthening \r\nthe General Assembly. The important contribution, \r\nprovided by the co-Chairs in their report (A/63/959) on \r\nthe implementation status of the resolutions in that area \r\nhas not been used at all. In that respect we support the \r\ninitiative to carry out a comprehensive review of the \r\ninventory so as to identify, first of all, the provisions \r\nthat have been implemented with respect to the \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly and, secondly, \r\nthose awaiting implementation, including the reasons \r\nwhy they have not been implemented. That should be \r\ndone in order to avoid further delay in actions aimed at \r\nenhancing the role of this important United Nations \r\norgan. \r\n Mexico believes that it is important that the \r\nagenda of the General Assembly reflect the priorities of \r\nthe international community. Rationalizing  the agenda \r\nitems of the General Assembly would make it easier to \r\ndistribute the workload more efficiently, both in the \r\nplenary and the Main Committees. That goal can be \r\nachieved only if it is agreed to by the General \r\nAssembly as a whole, because it requires that Member \r\nStates express their willingness to reduce appropriately \r\nthe number of items that are dealt with in this forum. \r\n We reiterate our view that one of the most \r\nfeasible ways to achieve that goal would be to address \r\nagenda items every two or three years, and it would \r\nseem worthwhile therefore to continue that exercise. \r\nThat approach would of course also depend on the will \r\nof the membership as a whole. \r\n It is also important to continue analyzing \r\ninnovative proposals to improve the manual voting \r\nmethod within the Organization so as to ensure that the \r\nprocess is always reliable and credible and that the \r\nvote remains confidential. Another aspect we must \r\ncontinue to work on in order to move forward \r\ndecisively is the relationship between the General \r\nAssembly and the other principal organs of the United \r\nNations. Greater and more efficient interaction and \r\ncoordination among the General Assembly, the \r\nSecurity Council and the Economic and Social Council \r\nis needed, especially in areas that affect international \r\npeace and security. \r\n With respect to the selection and appointment of \r\nthe Secretary-General, my delegation feels that the \r\nprocess should be carried out more openly, more \r\ntransparently and with the full and active participation \r\nof Member States. However, the reality that the \r\nSecurity Council holds the power with respect to the \r\nimportant decision of selecting a candidate for that post \r\nand that the General Assembly simply sanctions that \r\ndecision must be acknowledged. Pursuant to Article 97 \r\nof the Charter and relevant resolutions adopted in that \r\narea, the appointment of the Secretary-General falls to \r\nthe General Assembly, which takes that decision after \r\nlistening to the recommendation of the Security \r\nCouncil. \r\n To fully comply with that decision, the General \r\nAssembly must have prior and extensive knowledge of \r\nall of the candidates with respect to their professional \r\nA/65/PV.56  \r\n \r\n10-67395 20 \r\n \r\nexperience, depth of knowledge and commitment, as \r\nwell as their vision of the United Nations and what it \r\nrepresents. Unfortunately, that has not been the \r\npractice. Paragraph 14 of resolution 64/301 states that \r\nthe Ad Hoc Working Group at the sixty-fifth session \r\nshould continue its consideration of the revitalization \r\nof the role of the General Assembly in the selection \r\nand appointment of the Secretary-General. Mexico \r\nbelieves that it is important to achieve swift, clear and \r\nconcrete progress in that regard, which is one of the \r\nmain reasons for the establishment of the Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group. \r\n My delegation is prepared to continue to \r\ncooperate in the Ad Hoc Working Group on the \r\nRevitalization of the General Assembly, with a view to \r\nfocusing further on elements that strengthen the most \r\nrepresentative and universal organ that we the Member \r\nStates have. That would promote a broader and more \r\nconstructive dialogue that would enable the \r\nOrganization to respond in a more effective and \r\nlegitimate manner to the global challenges facing the \r\ninternational community today. \r\n Mr. Simanjuntak (Indonesia): Allow me to \r\ndeliver this statement on behalf of the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Indonesia, Ambassador Hasan Kleib. \r\n Our deliberations today are relevant and in sync \r\nwith the theme of the current session, “Reaffirming the \r\ncentral role of the United Nations in global \r\ngovernance”, which my delegation endorses. \r\n My delegation wishes to align itself with the \r\nstatements made earlier by the Ambassador of Algeria, \r\nas Non-Aligned Movement coordinator on this issue, \r\nand by the Ambassador of Viet Nam, on behalf of the \r\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations. \r\n Indonesia would like to welcome the recent \r\nappointment of Ambassador Dalius Čekuolis of \r\nLithuania and Ambassador Camillo Gonsalves of Saint \r\nVincent and the Grenadines as co-Chairs of the Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group on the Revitalization of the General \r\nAssembly at the sixty-fifth session. We congratulate \r\nthem on their appointment and stand ready to \r\nresolutely assist them in their undertaking. \r\n Our endeavour to revitalize the work of the \r\nGeneral Assembly has spanned a period of more than \r\ntwo decades. We should build upon the achievements \r\nand make progress based on the constructive \r\ncompromises we have made to reach consensus on the \r\nmany converging issues concerning the Assembly’s \r\nreinvigoration. \r\n In that regard, we would like to commend the \r\nwork of the previous co-Chairs of the Ad Hoc Working \r\nGroup, the Permanent Representatives of Argentina \r\nand Slovenia, for successfully steering the dynamic \r\nprocess in the Working Group that led to the adoption \r\nof resolution 64/301. That reflects the zeal of Member \r\nStates to continue to underscore the gravity of the \r\nreform process of the General Assembly, a critical \r\nprincipal organ of the United Nations. The resolution \r\nhighlights elements that are important to further \r\nadvancing the work of the Ad Hoc Working Group \r\nduring this session. We should focus on those elements \r\nat this session. \r\n First, it is vital to carry out the mandate of the \r\nWorking Group, which in particular has been referred \r\nto as undertaking a comprehensive review of the \r\ninventory contained in the annex to the report of the Ad \r\nHoc Working Group submitted at the sixty-third \r\nsession (A/63/959). The inventory charts annexed to \r\nthe annual reports of the Working Group have been a \r\nvery useful tool, which we should continue to use. We \r\nshould also continue our work to translate into action \r\nthe many resolutions and decisions that have been \r\nagreed on the subject of the Assembly’s revitalization. \r\n Secondly, the Working Group has a mandate to \r\nidentify further ways to enhance the role, authority, \r\neffectiveness and efficiency of the Assembly, inter alia \r\nby building on previous resolutions and evaluating the \r\nstatus of their implementation. It should be ensured \r\nthat all agreed resolutions in this area are implemented. \r\nWhere they have not been fulfilled, the Working Group \r\nshould further identify gaps, with a view to finding \r\nways and means to address the challenges and \r\nobstacles to their implementation. \r\n Thirdly, Indonesia welcomes the positive intent \r\nof the resolution that requests the Secretary-General to \r\nsubmit proposals in the context of the proposed \r\nprogramme budget for the biennium 2012-2013, to \r\nreview the budget allocation for the Office of the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly in accordance with \r\nexisting procedures. That is in line with the efforts to \r\nstrengthen the institutional memory and function of the \r\nOffice of the President by providing it with separate \r\nand dedicated resources. \r\n Fourthly, the report emphasizes the importance of \r\nbalance among the principal organs, in particular \r\n A/65/PV.56\r\n \r\n21 10-67395 \r\n \r\nbetween the Assembly and the Security Council. It also \r\npoints out that the discussion on the relationship \r\nbetween the two organs can be considered in the \r\ncontext of intergovernmental negotiations on Security \r\nCouncil reform in informal plenary meetings of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. That recommendation is very \r\nrealistic and sensible. As the issue of the relationship \r\nbetween those two important organs has been dealt \r\nwith as one of key issues in the debate on Security \r\nCouncil reform, the Ad Hoc Working Group on the \r\nRevitalization of the General Assembly could focus on \r\nother important issues before it. \r\n Lastly, the report touches upon the issue of the \r\nappointment of Secretaries-General. We recognize that \r\nthe Assembly has an instrumental role in making the \r\nprocess of selection transparent, inclusive and open for \r\nconsultation by the wider membership. While the \r\nexisting selection process has produced distinguished \r\nand commendable Secretaries-General, that does not \r\nmean that the process itself is perfect. In giving effect \r\nto democratic principles, there is always room for \r\nimprovement. Without prejudice to Article 97 of the \r\nUnited Nations Charter, we share the views on the need \r\nfor substantive interaction by candidates with the \r\nAssembly, in which due regard will continue to be \r\ngiven to regional rotation. \r\n In conclusion, let me assure you, Mr. President, \r\nthat Indonesia, for its part, is committed to continuing \r\nto work constructively with all delegations in our \r\ncommon efforts to enhance the role, authority, \r\neffectiveness and efficiency of the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Loulichki (Morocco) (spoke in French): At \r\nthe outset, my delegation would like to commend the \r\nefforts undertaken by Mr. Jorge Argüello, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Argentina, and Ms. Sanja Štiglic, \r\nPermanent Representative of Slovenia, in their capacity \r\nas co-Chairs of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the \r\nRevitalization of the General Assembly. I would also \r\nlike to take this opportunity to thank their successors, \r\nAmbassador Dalius Čekuolis, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Lithuania, and Ambassador Camillo \r\nGonsalves, Permanent Representative of Saint Vincent \r\nand the Grenadines.  \r\n My delegation associates itself with the statement \r\nmade by the Permanent Representative of Algeria on \r\nbehalf of the Non-Aligned Movement. \r\n Today’s debate has a central place in the reform \r\nof the United Nations. It addresses the major \r\nchallenges before us, namely, the balance between the \r\ndifferent United Nations organs, their roles, the \r\nresponsibility and efficiency of the General Assembly \r\nin the context of its fundamental mission and the \r\nmodernization of its working methods.  \r\n The General Assembly has a central role to play \r\nas the main deliberative organ, with particular \r\nresponsibility for steering the Organization, developing \r\ninternational cooperation on economic, social, cultural \r\nand educational matters and establishing norms and \r\ncodifying international law. Over the past 20 years, the \r\nAssembly has adopted various measures to strengthen \r\nits role and its authority, as well as that of its President. \r\nWe welcome those developments.  \r\n The General Assembly has also devoted itself to \r\nrefocusing its work in order to better respond to current \r\nand future challenges facing it, namely, strengthening \r\ninternational peace and security, combating terrorism, \r\nstrengthening the means to prevent crises and combat \r\ntheir recurrence, and preventing the destruction of the \r\nenvironment and its biodiversity. The resolutions \r\nadopted to date by the General Assembly have allowed \r\nus to make some progress towards the revitalization of \r\nthe General Assembly. However, a great deal remains \r\nto be done. \r\n Improving the practices and working methods of \r\nthe Main Committees, strengthening the role and \r\ninstitutional memory of the Office of the President of \r\nthe General Assembly, consolidating the role and \r\nauthority of the President and further rationalizing the \r\nagenda of the General Assembly are strategic \r\nobjectives on which we must continue to work to make \r\nthe Organization’s primary deliberative body strong, \r\ncredible, effective and up to the task of meeting the \r\nnew challenges of the twenty-first century. In that \r\npursuit, we should of course fully respect the \r\nprovisions of the Charter and the balance between the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council as the \r\nbody with the primary responsibility for the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. \r\n While strengthening the role and impact of the \r\nGeneral Assembly calls for structural and \r\norganizational measures, it will also require that the \r\ndecisions of summits and special sessions are \r\nimplemented effectively, beginning with those relating \r\nto the Millennium Development Goals and the Middle \r\nEast. \r\nA/65/PV.56  \r\n \r\n10-67395 22 \r\n \r\n Greater efforts need to be made in the area of \r\nrationalization in order to bridge gaps, avoid \r\nduplication and strengthen the effectiveness of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, while bearing in mind the need to \r\nminimize the financial burden on developing countries. \r\nMy country remains convinced that under your \r\nleadership this year, Mr. President, which you have \r\nfocused on the overarching theme of international good \r\ngovernance, Member States will continue to devote \r\ngreater effort to advancing the process of revitalization. \r\n We must not lose sight of the fact that, through \r\nthe revitalization of the General Assembly and the \r\nreform of the Security Council, the international \r\ncommunity hopes to re-establish and strengthen \r\nconfidence in multilateralism, which is the only \r\nframework capable of ensuring that the legitimate \r\ninterests and aspirations of all of the Member States of \r\nthe United Nations are taken into account in an \r\ninclusive, differentiated and balanced way. \r\n Mr. Salsabili (Islamic Republic of Iran): I should \r\nlike to express my gratitude to you, Mr. President, for \r\naccording due attention to the longstanding and \r\nimportant issue of revitalizing the General Assembly \r\nby placing it at the core of the agenda for the \r\nAssembly’s work at its sixty-fifth session. \r\n While my delegation associates itself with the \r\nstatement delivered by the Permanent Representative \r\nof Algeria on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement, I \r\nshould also like to elaborate on a few points in greater \r\ndepth.  \r\n The fact that a great number of United Nations \r\nresolutions deal with the revitalization of the role and \r\nauthority of the General Assembly clearly demonstrates \r\nthe importance that the general membership attaches to \r\nenhancing the role and authority of this organ. We \r\nshould therefore redouble our efforts to explore \r\nconcrete ways and means to fully realize the functions \r\nand powers of the General Assembly as stipulated in \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. \r\n With regard to the relationship between the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the other principal organs of the \r\nUnited Nations, the particular relationship between the \r\nAssembly and the Security Council has been a matter \r\nof extensive debate, especially in the context of the \r\nvarious efforts to reform the United Nations over many \r\nyears. A good number of General Assembly resolutions \r\nset out certain criteria to clarify the relationship \r\nbetween these two important principal organs of the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n The Charter of the United Nations itself confers \r\nimportant functions and responsibilities on both \r\norgans. However, we have seen a constant and \r\nprogressive encroachment by the Security Council \r\nupon the functions, powers and prerogatives of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and other organs, in areas ranging \r\nfrom legislation and administrative issues to budgetary \r\nmatters. In that respect, forming a study group to \r\nengage on all aspects of this issue could be considered \r\nas a positive step towards understanding and \r\naddressing the concerns of Member States. Of \r\nparticular relevance here are the practices of the \r\nSecurity Council of setting norms, making laws and \r\nestablishing definitions in areas beyond its \r\ncompetence. Let me recall paragraph 1, Article 13, of \r\nthe Charter, in which the General Assembly, as the sole \r\nuniversal and representative organ comprising all \r\nMember States of the United Nations, is tasked with \r\nthe progressive development of international law and \r\nits codification. \r\n During the previous session, the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly submitted a valuable report on \r\nstrengthening the institutional memory of his Office. \r\nWhile we emphasize that the institutional memory of \r\nhis Office has a profound link with other substantial \r\nissues at hand, it is noticeable and quite alarming that \r\nthe budget of that Office has not increased since \r\n1998 — a period during which the budget of the United \r\nNations increased three-fold. While any voluntary \r\nfunds for correcting this budget situation would be \r\nappreciated, the need for funding to be predictable and \r\nsustainable and the need to preserve the impartiality of \r\nthe Office oblige us to ask that a greater proportion of \r\nthe regular budget be dedicated to the Office. \r\n According to Article 10 of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, the Assembly may discuss any \r\nquestions within the scope of the Charter or relating to \r\nthe powers and functions of any organs provided for in \r\nthe Charter. Since the process of selecting and \r\nappointing the Secretary-General is not outside the \r\nscope of the Charter, it can be raised and discussed in \r\nthe Assembly as one of this body’s basic roles. \r\n The appointment of the Secretary-General, which \r\nis supposed to be approved by the authority or \r\nagreement of the General Assembly, should be \r\narranged through a process or a systematic series of \r\n A/65/PV.56\r\n \r\n23 10-67395 \r\n \r\nactions. In our view, the great majority of the Members \r\nof the Organization share a strong will to articulate and \r\nimprove the selection procedure of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral through granting the General Assembly a more \r\nmeaningful and determining role. \r\n Paragraphs 56 to 61 of resolution 51/241 \r\nprescribed a set of provisions that, if implemented, \r\nwould strengthen the role of the General Assembly in \r\nthe selection of the Secretary-General. In particular, \r\nparagraph 56 reaffirms the need for the process to be \r\nmade more transparent. In fact, that is a major matter \r\nfor the entire international community, which regards \r\nthe Secretary-General as its highest representative. His \r\nlegitimacy and credibility should therefore be based on \r\nthe widest support of its members. \r\n Finally, as part of the comprehensive reform of \r\nthe United Nations, the revitalization of the General \r\nAssembly is a dynamic and continuous process. We \r\nshould remain committed and constructive throughout \r\nthis ongoing exercise, with a view to strengthening the \r\nrole and authority of the Assembly as the chief \r\ndeliberative, policymaking and representative organ of \r\nthe United Nations. \r\n Mr. Dabbashi (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke \r\nin Arabic): At the outset, I wish to align myself with \r\nthe statement delivered earlier by the representative of \r\nAlgeria on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement on \r\nthe functions and matters assigned to the General \r\nAssembly under the Charter. I also wish to emphasize \r\nthe need for the General Assembly to fully carry out its \r\nmandate. We should all work together to put a halt to \r\nthe Security Council’s encroachment on the mandate of \r\nthe General Assembly, and even enhance that mandate. \r\n Unfortunately, we have seen how the end of the \r\nCold War has served as justification for the Security \r\nCouncil to encroach upon the mandate of the General \r\nAssembly and to marginalize its role in important \r\nmatters, such as the selection of the Secretary-General, \r\nthe admission of new members and other matters \r\nrelating to the maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity. That is unacceptable in the light of the \r\nincreasing changes in the international scene in all \r\nareas. \r\n We welcome the establishment of the Ad hoc \r\nWorking Group on the Revitalization of the General \r\nAssembly. We believe it should focus on considering \r\nways to implement General Assembly resolutions and \r\nend the encroachment on its mandate and functions. \r\nThe Assembly’s functions should be enhanced and \r\nexpanded so that it is the main body to adopt \r\ninternational resolutions. The resolutions of the \r\nGeneral Assembly should be binding on all Member \r\nStates and all organs of the United Nations, including \r\nthe Security Council, which should ultimately serve as \r\na tool for the implementation of the Assembly’s \r\nresolutions. General Assembly resolutions are the most \r\nlegitimate resolutions in the United Nations system \r\nbecause the Assembly is the most representative body. \r\nIt is therefore a world parliament of sorts, and should \r\nbe the supreme legislative body to which all States \r\nsubmit. \r\n The Articles of the Charter that limit the \r\nfunctions of the General Assembly should be changed \r\nso that the Assembly is not held hostage to decisions \r\nadopted by the Security Council on certain issues. \r\nSubjecting the will of 192 States to the decisions of the \r\nfive permanent members of the Security Council is a \r\nsituation that should not be allowed to continue. That is \r\nthe only way of maintaining international peace and \r\nsecurity. \r\n In conclusion, Libya, which was honoured to \r\npreside over the previous session of the General \r\nAssembly, feels that there is an urgent need to support \r\nthe Office of the President of the General Assembly, \r\nboth in terms of financial and human resources \r\nsupport. Given the various financial obligations of the \r\npast few years, the current resources are insufficient to \r\ncover the expenses of the Office. The State presiding \r\nover the General Assembly therefore finds itself \r\nfinancing the activities of the General Assembly. In \r\nshort, we should increase the financial and human \r\nresources devoted to the Office of the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n Mr. Valero Briceño (Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela) (spoke in Spanish): My delegation aligns \r\nitself with the statement made by the representative of \r\nAlgeria on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement. \r\n The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela also \r\nwelcomes the appointments of Ambassador Camillo \r\nGonsalves, Permanent Representative of Saint Vincent \r\nand the Grenadines, and Ambassador Dalius Čekuolis, \r\nPermanent Representative of the Republic of \r\nLithuania, as the new co-Chairs of the Ad hoc Working \r\nGroup on the Revitalization of the General Assembly. \r\nAllow me also to acknowledge the work done by \r\nAmbassador Sanja Štiglic, Permanent Representative \r\nA/65/PV.56  \r\n \r\n10-67395 24 \r\n \r\nof Slovenia, and Ambassador Jorge Arguëllo, \r\nPermanent Representative of Argentina, as co-Chairs of \r\nthe Group during the sixty-fourth session. \r\n The previous session revealed the full validity \r\nand importance of the issues dealt with by the Working \r\nGroup. Those include the selection and appointment of \r\nthe Secretary-General, the role and authority of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, budgetary matters, the relationship \r\nbetween the General Assembly and the other organs of \r\nthe United Nations and improving the Assembly’s \r\nworking methods. Those issues, which continue to be \r\npart of the Group’s deliberations during the sixty-fifth \r\nsession, should be addressed in a comprehensive \r\nmanner. \r\n The selection and appointment of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral is a fundamental matter in terms of the \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly. A few \r\nproposals were made on this issue during the previous \r\nsession. My delegation would like to emphasize the \r\nresponsibility that the General Assembly should have \r\nin that regard. Venezuela believes that the monopoly \r\nexercised by the Security Council in electing the \r\nSecretary-General is an anti-democratic practice that \r\ndoes not enable effective participation by the General \r\nAssembly in the decision-making process. The \r\nselection process must be inclusive and transparent and \r\ninvolve the General Assembly at every stage of the \r\nprocess. \r\n Likewise, my delegation would like to emphasize \r\nthe need for the Secretariat to act in accordance with \r\nthe terms  of the Charter and the Assembly’s rules of \r\nprocedure and on the basis of what is agreed and \r\nadopted by Member States. That would guarantee \r\ncredibility and legitimacy for the Organization, but \r\nalso for the Secretary-General as he carries out his \r\nfunctions. \r\n Complaints have been raised in the Working \r\nGroup on various occasions with regard to the need to \r\nhalt the harmful trend of the Security Council \r\nencroaching upon issues that are solely within the \r\npurview of the General Assembly, thereby minimizing \r\nthe role of the Assembly relative to that of the Council. \r\nNot everything that happens in the world is a threat to \r\ninternational peace and security, and not everything \r\nshould be handled and controlled by the Security \r\nCouncil.  \r\n Skewed perspectives lead to skewed responses. \r\nOnly the General Assembly can devise comprehensive \r\napproaches to situations that deserve much more than \r\njust responses divorced from reality as it is experienced \r\non the ground.  \r\n Strengthening the General Assembly requires \r\nenabling it to fully exercise its powers in the area of \r\ninternational peace and security as set out in Articles \r\n10 through 14 of the United Nations Charter. The \r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela welcomes the \r\nprogress achieved by resolution 64/301, adopted in \r\nSeptember of last year. We are prepared to expand the \r\nGroup’s work, especially with regard to the \r\nimplementation of the resolutions that have been \r\nadopted. We can only vote effectively if we analyze the \r\ntrue causes that have hampered their implementation \r\nand if those responsible for the lack of implementation \r\nmeet their responsibilities and commitments with a \r\nview to success in genuinely strengthening the General \r\nAssembly.  \r\n The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela once again \r\npledges its full cooperation and willingness to work \r\nwith the President and the two co-facilitators. \r\n Mr. Feleke (Ethiopia): As “Reaffirming the \r\ncentral role of the United Nations in global \r\ngovernance” is the theme of the sixty-fifth session of \r\nthe General Assembly, my delegation would like to \r\ntake this opportunity once again to emphasize the need \r\nto revitalize the role and authority of the General \r\nAssembly in addressing the multidimensional \r\nchallenges that the global community faces today. In \r\nthat connection, Mr. President, Ethiopia fully supports \r\nthe timely and appropriate reaffirmation of the central \r\nrole of the United Nations and the priorities set for this \r\nsession under your presidency. \r\n My delegation aligns itself fully with the \r\nstatement delivered by the Permanent Representative \r\nof Algeria on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement. \r\n Ethiopia strongly believes that there is a shared \r\nsense of purpose and expectation among Member \r\nStates that the General Assembly will be revitalized to \r\nassume, as it should, its rightful responsibility as the \r\nchief deliberative, policymaking and representative \r\norgan of the United Nations. Enhancing the role of the \r\nGeneral Assembly is a matter of urgent and paramount \r\nimportance if the Organization is to tackle global \r\nchallenges such as poverty, climate change, conflict \r\nand other pressing concerns facing the international \r\ncommunity. \r\n A/65/PV.56\r\n \r\n25 10-67395 \r\n \r\n We also believe that the role and authority of the \r\nGeneral Assembly in setting norms across the United \r\nNations system, in accordance with the provisions of \r\nthe United Nations Charter, has to be preserved and \r\nenhanced. In that regard, the growing encroachment of \r\nthe Security Council upon the purview of the General \r\nAssembly is a concern for many States, including \r\nmine. It is obvious that this undesirable trend in the \r\nSecurity Council derives from progressively redefining \r\nthe scope and nature of threats to international peace \r\nand security. It is high time that we reverse that trend \r\nand restore the General Assembly to its rightful place, \r\nenabling it to address issues that fall within its domain. \r\n Moreover, the role of the General Assembly in \r\nthe process of selecting the Secretary-General is not in \r\nkeeping with the status of the General Assembly. There \r\nis a widely held view that the process does not offer \r\nsufficient opportunity for the majority of the \r\nmembership to select the Secretary-General. My \r\ndelegation is therefore of the view that undertaking a \r\ncomprehensive review of the Assembly’s role in that \r\nprocess is timely and appropriate. \r\n As the issue of the revitalization of the General \r\nAssembly is a political process, the commitment of all \r\nMember States and, more important, engaging political \r\nwill at the highest levels are critically important to \r\nachieving our desired goal as a matter of priority. In \r\nthat respect, in order to bring about tangible progress \r\nin moving the Assembly’s revitalization process \r\nforward, it is important to focus on urgent and specific \r\nissues, including an assessment of the status of \r\nimplementation of past General Assembly resolutions \r\non revitalization. Also, a priority must be to streamline  \r\nthe Assembly’s agenda to focus on the most pressing \r\nissues and those of the greatest relevance to the \r\nmembership and the international community. \r\n The holding of thematic debates on issues of \r\ninternational significance and interest to the United \r\nNations should continue in the course of this session. \r\nMy delegation is of the view that, in order to avoid \r\noverlapping and duplication of discussions across the \r\nOrganization, emerging issues, including the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, should \r\ndeserve our utmost attention in setting the agenda. As \r\nhas been stated by Member States on numerous \r\noccasions, when thematic debates lead to the adoption \r\nof resolutions, ideas proposed by Member States \r\nduring thematic discussions need to be incorporated \r\nproperly in the resolutions. \r\n In conclusion, my delegation would like to \r\nunderline that improving the working methods of the \r\nAssembly with a view to strengthening its role remains \r\nan urgent priority. The effective and efficient \r\nimplementation of the Charter-mandated functions and \r\nresponsibilities of the General Assembly has a direct \r\nbearing on its relevance and credibility. Due \r\nconsideration should therefore be accorded to \r\nimproving the methods whereby the Assembly \r\nconducts its business. \r\n The President (spoke in French): We have heard \r\nthe last speaker in this debate. The Assembly has thus \r\nconcluded this stage of its consideration of agenda \r\nitems 117 and 118. \r\n  The meeting rose at 12.40 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\n"
