(Switzerland) \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nReports of the Sixth Committee \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): This afternoon \r\nthe General Assembly will consider the reports of the \r\nSixth Committee on agenda items 75 to 86, 107, 118, \r\n130, 140 and 161. \r\n I request the Rapporteur of the Sixth Committee, \r\nMrs. Glenna Cabello de Daboin of the Bolivarian \r\nRepublic of Venezuela, to introduce in one intervention \r\nthe reports of the Committee that are before the \r\nAssembly. \r\n Mrs. Cabello de Daboin (Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela), Rapporteur of the Sixth Committee (spoke \r\nin Spanish): I have the honour today to present the \r\nreports of the Sixth Committee on its work during the \r\nsixty-fifth session of the General Assembly. \r\n The Assembly allocated to the Committee \r\n15 substantive and 3 procedural agenda items. Except \r\nfor that which relates to the election of officers, all \r\nthose agenda items fall under three of the headings \r\ncorresponding to the priorities of the Organization, \r\nnamely: “Promotion of justice and international law”, \r\n“Drug control, crime prevention and combating \r\ninternational terrorism in all its forms and \r\nmanifestations”, and “Organizational, administrative \r\nand other matters”. I will introduce the reports of the \r\nSixth Committee on the various items in the order in \r\nwhich they fall under those three headings.  \r\n I will begin with the first heading, “Promotion of \r\njustice and international law”, under which the Sixth \r\nCommittee considered 12 items and adopted 15 draft \r\nresolutions. \r\n The Sixth Committee considered agenda item 75, \r\n“Responsibility of States for internationally wrongful \r\nacts”. The relevant Committee report is contained in \r\ndocument A/65/463, and the draft resolution \r\nrecommended to the General Assembly for adoption is \r\nreproduced in paragraph 9 thereof. \r\n Under the terms of the draft resolution, the \r\nGeneral Assembly would acknowledge the importance \r\nof, and commend once again to the attention of \r\nGovernments, the articles on responsibility of States \r\nfor internationally wrongful acts, without prejudice to \r\nthe question of their future adoption or other \r\nappropriate action. The Assembly would request the \r\nSecretary-General to invite Governments to submit \r\nwritten comments on any future action regarding the \r\narticles. It would also request the Secretary-General to \r\nupdate once again the compilation of decisions of \r\ninternational courts, tribunals and other international \r\nbodies related to the articles and to invite Governments \r\nto submit information on their practice in that regard. It \r\nwould further request the Secretary-General to submit \r\nthat material well in advance of its sixty-eighth \r\nsession. \r\n Finally, the General Assembly would decide to \r\ninclude in the provisional agenda of its sixty-eighth \r\nsession the item entitled “Responsibility of States for \r\ninternationally wrongful acts”. It would also further \r\nA/65/PV.57  \r\n \r\n10-67401 2 \r\n \r\nexamine, with a view to taking a decision, within the \r\nframework of a working group of the Sixth Committee, \r\nthe question of a convention on responsibility of States \r\nfor internationally wrongful acts or other appropriate \r\naction on the basis of the articles. \r\n The Sixth Committee also considered agenda \r\nitem 76, “Criminal accountability of United Nations \r\nofficials and experts on mission”. Its report is \r\ncontained in document A/65/464, and the draft \r\nresolution recommended to the General Assembly is \r\nreproduced in paragraph 7 thereof.  \r\n Under the terms of the draft resolution, the \r\nAssembly would reiterate the content of resolutions \r\n62/63, 63/119 and 64/110 concerning in particular the \r\nmeasures envisaged therein, in order to ensure the \r\ncriminal accountability of United Nations officials and \r\nexperts on mission, while preserving the reporting \r\nmechanisms provided for in those resolutions. \r\n The report on agenda item 77, “Report of the \r\nUnited Nations Commission on International Trade \r\nLaw on the work of its forty-third session”, is \r\ncontained in document A/65/465. The Sixth Committee \r\nrecommended four draft resolutions for adoption by the \r\nGeneral Assembly, which are reproduced in paragraph \r\n13 of the report.  \r\n Under the terms of draft resolution I, the General \r\nAssembly would, among others things, endorse the \r\nefforts and initiatives of the Commission, as the core \r\nlegal body within the United Nations system in the \r\nfield of international trade law. Draft resolution II \r\npertains to the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations \r\nCommission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) \r\nas revised in 2010. Draft resolution III pertains to the \r\nUNCITRAL Legislative Guide on Secured \r\nTransactions: Supplement on Security Rights in \r\nIntellectual Property. Finally, draft resolution IV \r\npertains to part three of the UNCITRAL Legislative \r\nGuide on Insolvency Law, on the treatment of \r\nenterprise groups in insolvency. \r\n The report on agenda item 78, “United Nations \r\nProgramme of Assistance in the Teaching, Study, \r\nDissemination and Wider Appreciation of International \r\nLaw”, is to be found in document A/65/466, and the \r\ndraft resolution recommended to the General Assembly \r\nfor adoption is reproduced in paragraph 8 thereof.  \r\n Under the terms of the draft resolution, the \r\nAssembly would reaffirm that the Programme \r\nconstitutes a core activity of the United Nations and \r\nthat there is an increasing demand for international law \r\ntraining. It would commend the efforts by the \r\nCodification Division of the Office of Legal Affairs to \r\nrevitalize the Programme to better respond to the needs \r\nof the international community, particularly with \r\nregard to the International Law Fellowship Programme, \r\nthe regional courses in international law and the \r\nAudiovisual Library of International Law. It would \r\nexpress its appreciation to the Republic of Korea and \r\nthe Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia for \r\nhosting regional courses in international law in Seoul \r\nin 2010 and in Addis Ababa in 2011.  \r\n The Assembly would reiterate its authorization \r\nfor the Secretary-General to carry out those activities \r\nin 2011, express concern over the reduction in the \r\nprogramme budget for fellowships, and further request \r\nthe Secretary-General to provide the necessary \r\nresources to the programme budget in 2011 as well as \r\nfor the next and future bienniums to ensure the \r\ncontinued effectiveness and further development of the \r\nProgramme, in particular the regional courses in \r\ninternational law and the Audiovisual Library of \r\nInternational Law. \r\n In addition, the Assembly would decide to \r\ninclude in the provisional agenda of its sixty-sixth \r\nsession an item entitled “United Nations Programme of \r\nAssistance in the Teaching, Study, Dissemination and \r\nWider Appreciation of International Law” and would \r\nrequest the Secretary-General to report to the Assembly \r\nat its sixty-sixth session on the implementation of the \r\nProgramme during 2011 and to include information \r\nwith regard to the provision of the necessary resources \r\nto the programme budget. \r\n The report on agenda item 79, “Report of the \r\nInternational Law Commission on the work of its sixty-\r\nsecond session”, is contained in document A/65/467, \r\nand the draft resolution recommended to the General \r\nAssembly for adoption is reproduced in paragraph 8 of \r\nthe report. \r\n The Assembly would, inter alia, invite \r\nGovernments to submit to the secretariat of the \r\nCommission, by 31 January 2011, observations on the \r\nentire set of draft guidelines constituting the Guide to \r\nPractice on Reservations to Treaties, provisionally \r\nadopted by the Commission at its sixty-second session, \r\nwith a view to finalizing the Guide at the sixty-third \r\nsession. It would once again draw the attention of \r\n A/65/PV.57\r\n \r\n3 10-67401 \r\n \r\nGovernments to the importance for the International \r\nLaw Commission of having their comments and \r\nobservations by 1 January 2011 on the draft articles \r\nand commentaries on the topic “Responsibility of \r\ninternational organizations” adopted on first reading by \r\nthe Commission at its sixty-first session. The Assembly \r\nwould invite the International Law Commission to give \r\npriority to its consideration of the topics “Immunity of \r\nState officials from foreign criminal jurisdiction” and \r\n“The obligation to extradite or prosecute (aut dedere \r\naut judicare)”. \r\n The report of the Sixth Committee on agenda \r\nitem 80, “Diplomatic protection”, is contained in \r\ndocument A/65/468, and the draft resolution \r\nrecommended to the General Assembly for adoption is \r\nreproduced in paragraph 9 thereof.  \r\n Under the terms of the draft resolution, the \r\nGeneral Assembly would commend once again the \r\narticles on diplomatic protection to the attention of \r\nGovernments and invite them to submit in writing to \r\nthe Secretary-General any further comments, including \r\ncomments concerning the recommendation by the \r\nInternational Law Commission to elaborate a \r\nconvention on the basis of the articles.  \r\n In addition, the Assembly would decide to \r\ninclude in the provisional agenda of its sixty-eighth \r\nsession an item entitled “Diplomatic protection” and, \r\nwithin the framework of a working group of the Sixth \r\nCommittee and in the light of the comments of \r\nGovernments, as well as views expressed in the \r\ndebates held at the sixty-second and sixty-fifth sessions \r\nof the General Assembly, to examine in more depth the \r\nquestion of a convention on diplomatic protection, or \r\nany other appropriate action, on the basis of the above-\r\nmentioned articles, and to also identify any difference \r\nof opinion on the articles. \r\n The report on agenda item 81, “Consideration of \r\nprevention of transboundary harm from hazardous \r\nactivities and allocation of loss in the case of such \r\nharm”, is contained in document A/65/469, and the \r\ndraft resolution recommended to the General Assembly \r\nfor adoption is reproduced in paragraph 7 thereof. By \r\nits terms, the Assembly would, inter alia, decide to \r\nrevert to this item at its sixty-eighth session. \r\n The report on agenda item 82, “Status of the \r\nProtocols Additional to the Geneva Conventions of \r\n1949 and relating to the protection of victims of armed \r\nconflicts”, is contained in document A/65/470, and the \r\ndraft resolution recommended to the General Assembly \r\nfor adoption is reproduced in its paragraph 7. \r\n The report on agenda item 83, “Consideration of \r\neffective measures to enhance the protection, security \r\nand safety of diplomatic and consular missions and \r\nrepresentatives”, is contained in document A/65/471, \r\nand the draft resolution recommended to the General \r\nAssembly for adoption is reproduced in paragraph 7 \r\nthereof. \r\n The report on agenda item 84, “Report of the \r\nSpecial Committee on the Charter of the United \r\nNations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the \r\nOrganization”, is contained in document A/65/472, and \r\nthe draft resolution recommended to the General \r\nAssembly for adoption is reproduced in paragraph 10 \r\nthereof.  \r\n Under the terms of the draft resolution, the \r\nAssembly would, inter alia, request the Special \r\nCommittee to continue its consideration of all \r\nproposals concerning the question of the maintenance \r\nof international peace and security and to continue to \r\nconsider, on a priority basis, the question of the \r\nimplementation of the provisions of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations related to assistance to third States \r\naffected by the application of sanctions, and ways and \r\nmeans of improving the Committee’s working methods \r\nand enhancing its efficiency. \r\n The report on agenda item 85, “The rule of law at \r\nthe national and international levels”, is contained in \r\ndocument A/65/473, and the draft resolution \r\nrecommended to the General Assembly for adoption is \r\nreproduced in its paragraph 7.  \r\n Under the terms of that draft resolution, the \r\nAssembly would, inter alia, call for enhancing dialogue \r\namong all stakeholders with a view to placing national \r\nperspectives at the centre of rule of law assistance in \r\norder to strengthen national ownership; request the \r\nSecretary-General to submit, in a timely manner, his \r\nnext annual report on United Nations rule of law \r\nactivities; and decide to convene a high-level meeting \r\nof the General Assembly on the rule of law at the \r\nnational and international levels during the high-level \r\nsegment of its sixty-seventh session, the modalities of \r\nwhich would be finalized during its sixty-sixth session. \r\n The report on agenda item 86, “The scope and \r\napplication of the principle of universal jurisdiction”, \r\nis contained in document A/65/474.  \r\nA/65/PV.57  \r\n \r\n10-67401 4 \r\n \r\n Under the draft resolution recommended for \r\nadoption, which is reproduced in paragraph 6 of the \r\nreport, the General Assembly would decide that the \r\nSixth Committee should continue its consideration of \r\nthe matter, without prejudice to the consideration of \r\nthis topic and related issues in other forums of the \r\nUnited Nations, and for that purpose would decide to \r\nestablish, at its sixty-sixth session, a working group of \r\nthe Sixth Committee to undertake a thorough \r\ndiscussion of the scope and application of universal \r\njurisdiction.  \r\n The Assembly would also invite Member States \r\nand relevant observers, as appropriate, to submit \r\ninformation and observations on the issue, including, \r\nwhere appropriate, information on the relevant \r\napplicable international treaties, their domestic legal \r\nrules and judicial practice, and would request the \r\nSecretary-General to submit to the General Assembly, \r\nat its sixty-sixth session, a report based on such \r\ninformation and observations. \r\n The Sixth Committee adopted the 15 draft \r\nresolutions under this first heading without a vote, and \r\nit is my hope that the General Assembly will be in a \r\nposition to do the same. \r\n I shall now turn to the heading “Drug control, \r\ncrime prevention and combating international terrorism \r\nin all its forms and manifestations”. \r\n The Sixth Committee considered agenda item \r\n107, “Measures to eliminate international terrorism”, \r\nunder this heading. The relevant report is contained in \r\ndocument A/65/475, and the draft resolution \r\nrecommended to the General Assembly for adoption is \r\nreproduced in paragraph 11 thereof. Should the \r\nAssembly adopt the draft resolution, it would, inter \r\nalia, request the Ad Hoc Committee established by \r\nAssembly resolution 51/210 to report to the Assembly \r\nduring the current session in the event of the \r\ncompletion of the draft comprehensive convention on \r\ninternational terrorism. \r\n The Sixth Committee adopted the draft resolution \r\nwithout a vote, and it is my hope that the Assembly \r\nwill be able to do the same. As in the past, it is \r\nenvisaged that the item in question will remain on the \r\nagenda of the General Assembly. \r\n Under the third and final heading, \r\n“Organizational, administrative and other matters”, the \r\nSixth Committee considered two substantive and two \r\nprocedural issues. I will begin with the substantive \r\nissues. \r\n The report on agenda item 140, “Administration \r\nof justice at the United Nations”, is contained in \r\ndocument A/65/478. It reproduces, in paragraph 10, a \r\ndraft decision whereby the General Assembly would \r\ndecide that the consideration of the outstanding legal \r\naspects of the item, including the question of effective \r\nremedies for non-staff personnel, as well as the code of \r\nconduct for the judges of the United Nations Dispute \r\nTribunal and the United Nations Appeals Tribunal, \r\nshould be continued during its sixty-sixth session in the \r\nframework of a working group of the Sixth Committee. \r\n The report on agenda item 161, “Report of the \r\nCommittee on Relations with the Host Country”, is \r\ncontained in document A/65/479, and the draft \r\nresolution recommended to the General Assembly for \r\nadoption appears in paragraph 8 of the report. \r\n The two procedural items considered by the Sixth \r\nCommittee under the third heading are agenda item \r\n118, “Revitalization of the work of the General \r\nAssembly”, and agenda item 130, “Programme \r\nplanning”. \r\n The report under agenda item 118, containing the \r\nprovisional programme of work of the Sixth \r\nCommittee during the sixty-sixth session, is to be \r\nfound in document A/65/476, and the draft decision by \r\nwhich the General Assembly would take note of the \r\nprovisional programme of work is reproduced in \r\nparagraph 7 of the report. The report on agenda item \r\n130 is contained in document A/65/477, and no further \r\naction by the General Assembly is recommended. \r\n The draft decisions and the draft resolution \r\nrelating to the agenda items under this third heading \r\nwere also adopted by the Sixth Committee without a \r\nvote, and once again it is my hope that the General \r\nAssembly will be in a position to do the same. \r\n Finally, I wish to inform the Assembly that there \r\nis no report in respect of agenda item 5, “Election of \r\nthe officers of the Main Committees”. Consistent with \r\nprevious practice, the election of the officers of the \r\nSixth Committee for the sixty-sixth session will be \r\ntaken up at a later stage in the course of the current \r\nsession. \r\n This concludes my introduction of the reports of \r\nthe Sixth Committee. Let me take this opportunity to \r\nexpress my gratitude to the Chairperson of the Sixth \r\n A/65/PV.57\r\n \r\n5 10-67401 \r\n \r\nCommittee, the Permanent Representative of Monaco, \r\nHer Excellency Ambassador Isabelle Picco, for her \r\nhard work and commendable leadership provided to the \r\nCommittee. My gratitude goes as well as to the other \r\nmembers of the Bureau — Mr. Reta Alemu Nega of \r\nEthiopia, Mr. Chull-joo Park of the Republic of Korea \r\nand Ms. Eva Šurkova of Slovakia — for their \r\ncooperation and the support they gave me as \r\nRapporteur. I also wish to thank all the delegates and \r\ncolleagues for their valuable contributions to the \r\nsuccess of the session. \r\n Finally, I would like to express my gratitude and \r\nappreciation to the secretariat of the Committee, \r\nensured by the Codification Division of the Office of \r\nLegal Affairs, for its efficient and valuable support and \r\nfor the competent and professional advice provided \r\nthroughout the session. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I thank the \r\nRapporteur of the Sixth Committee. \r\n If there is no proposal under rule 66 of the rules \r\nof procedure, I shall take it that the General Assembly \r\ndecides not to discuss the reports of the Sixth \r\nCommittee that are before the Assembly today. \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President (spoke in French): Statements will \r\ntherefore be limited to explanations of vote. The \r\npositions of delegations regarding the recommendations \r\nof the Sixth Committee have been made clear during \r\nthe work of the Committee and are reflected in the \r\nrelevant official records. \r\n May I remind members that under paragraph 7 of \r\ndecision 34/401, the General Assembly agreed that: \r\n  “When the same draft resolution is \r\nconsidered in a Main Committee and in plenary \r\nmeeting, a delegation should, as far as possible, \r\nexplain its vote only once, that is, either in the \r\nCommittee or in plenary meeting, unless that \r\ndelegation’s vote in plenary meeting is different \r\nfrom its vote in the Committee.” \r\n May I remind delegations that explanations of \r\nvote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by \r\ndelegations from their seats. \r\n Before we begin to take action on the \r\nrecommendations contained in the reports of the Sixth \r\nCommittee, I should like to advise representatives that \r\nwe are going to take decisions in the same manner as \r\nwas done in the Committee unless the Secretariat is \r\nnotified otherwise in advance. I therefore hope that we \r\nmay proceed to adopt without a vote those \r\nrecommendations that were adopted without a vote in \r\nthe Committee. \r\n Members are reminded that additional sponsors \r\nare no longer accepted now that draft resolutions and \r\ndecisions have been adopted by the Committee. Any \r\nclarification about sponsorship should be addressed to \r\nthe Secretary of the Committee. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 75 \r\n \r\nResponsibility of States for internationally \r\nwrongful acts \r\n \r\n  Report of the Sixth Committee (A/65/463) \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): The Assembly \r\nhas before it a draft resolution recommended by the \r\nSixth Committee in paragraph 9 of its report.
