(President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session)\r\nCo-Chair: Mr. Joseph Deiss . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session) \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 9.05 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nHigh-level Plenary Meeting on the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals \r\n \r\nAgenda items 13 and 115 (continued) \r\n \r\nIntegrated and coordinated implementation of and \r\nfollow-up to the outcomes of the major United \r\nNations conferences and summits in the economic, \r\nsocial and related fields \r\n \r\nFollow-up to the outcome of the Millennium Summit \r\n \r\n  Draft resolution (A/65/L.1) \r\n \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): I \r\nwish to remind members about the length of \r\nstatements. Members will recall that, in accordance \r\nwith Assembly resolution 64/184 of 21 December \r\n2009, the list of speakers has been drawn up based on a \r\ntime limit of five minutes per statement. I therefore \r\nrequest speakers to observe that limit out of respect for \r\nall who will speak after them so that everyone can \r\nenjoy the same conditions. I thank everyone for their \r\nunderstanding and discipline. \r\n The General Assembly will now hear an address \r\nby His Excellency Mr. Dimitris Christofias, President \r\nof the Republic of Cyprus. \r\n President Christofias: It is a great pleasure to \r\nparticipate in this High-level Meeting, which has a \r\nmost noble aim. Ambitious and far-reaching as they \r\nmay be, the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \r\ncertainly deserve our fullest attention and dedication. \r\nNations small and big should assume their shared \r\nresponsibilities and ensure that all the MDGs are met \r\non time. \r\n In fact, over the first 10 years we have spoken a \r\nlot but not done enough. In the five years that remain, \r\nwe must intensify our efforts to make up lost ground. \r\nFor our part, although Cyprus is a small country with \r\nlimited resources, we are doing everything possible to \r\nimplement the commitments we have undertaken, \r\nmobilizing additional and innovative sources of \r\nfinancing. CyprusAid, the development cooperation \r\nservice of the Republic, aims for an efficient and well-\r\ntargeted allocation of assistance to maximize the \r\nbenefits to partner countries. \r\n One of the objectives is to strive towards \r\nuniversal access to social services and social \r\nprotection, and to reduce inequalities. In this regard, \r\nwe are working with our European Union (EU) and \r\nUnited Nations partners, as well as with numerous local \r\nand international non-governmental organizations. We \r\nchannel our development assistance more specifically \r\nto health care areas, such as the construction of clinics \r\nand donation of ambulances. We also direct it to \r\neducation, tourism-related services and infrastructure, \r\nsuch as bridge construction and public works. In the \r\nfuture, we will have to devote more attention to \r\nenvironmental problems created by climate change. \r\n Lacking a project implementation mechanism for \r\nthe time being, Cyprus pursues development projects \r\nA/65/PV.5  \r\n \r\n10-54298 2 \r\n \r\nvia delegated cooperation — that is, in close \r\ncollaboration with our EU partners and development \r\nagencies. The projects implemented or planned thus far \r\nare aimed exclusively at the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. \r\n The European Union and its member States play a \r\ncrucial role in enabling developing countries to achieve \r\nMDGs 4 and 5, concerning child mortality and \r\nmaternal health, respectively. In this context, I would \r\nlike to note our contribution to MDG 6 — on AIDS — \r\nthrough our support of the International Drug Purchase \r\nFacility, which is an innovative mechanism for \r\nfinancing development. \r\n I assure Members from this rostrum that I will do \r\neverything I can to ensure that Cyprus continues to be \r\nan active regional and global player in this collective \r\neffort of ours. Before concluding, let me reiterate what \r\nI said yesterday. If we want to effectively and \r\nsubstantially touch on the problems of poverty and \r\ngender inequality, we must fight to achieve a more just \r\ndistribution of global wealth. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): \r\nThe Assembly will now hear an address by Her \r\nExcellency Ms. Tarja Halonen, President of the \r\nRepublic of Finland. \r\n President Halonen: The Millennium Declaration \r\n(resolution 55/2) is based on the idea that peace and \r\nsecurity, development and respect of human rights are \r\ninterlinked and mutually reinforcing. This trinity is still \r\ntrue. \r\n A democratic State that respects human rights and \r\nthe rule of law and applies good governance and social \r\njustice provides a solid foundation for the aspirations \r\nof its citizens. The activities of non-governmental \r\norganizations have been and are crucial to the \r\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs), and we also need the work of business life. \r\n There is strong evidence that our common efforts \r\nhave brought about results. The Goals have become an \r\nintegral part of developing countries’ own national \r\ndevelopment strategies. Many examples demonstrate \r\nthat the Goals played had an important role in national \r\npoverty reduction. \r\n Finland is fully committed to the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. We will continue to increase \r\nfunding for development cooperation, which will reach \r\n0.58 per cent of our gross national income next year, \r\nthereby keeping us on track to reach the 0.7 per cent \r\nlevel by 2015. Our support is increasingly directed to \r\nAfrica. We encourage other countries to do the same. \r\n The Millennium Development Goals are a part of \r\na broad development agenda. It includes the mutually \r\nreinforcing objectives of ensuring respect for and the \r\npromotion and protection of all human rights and of \r\nstrengthening democracy and the rule of law. \r\n The empowerment of women is crucial to \r\nachieving the Millennium Goals, but we need the \r\ncommitment and contribution of women and men alike. \r\nRecent declines in maternal mortality show that we can \r\nmake a difference. A rights-based approach is \r\nparticularly important in promoting maternal health \r\nand the reproductive rights of women. This scarf on my \r\nshoulders tells of the strong movement of women and \r\nmen who support that approach. Finland welcomes and \r\nstrongly supports the newly established UN Women, \r\nwhich will promote gender equality worldwide and \r\nacross the United Nations system. \r\n Efforts to eradicate poverty and improve the lives \r\nof all people need to be based on economic, social and \r\necological sustainability. Special attention must be \r\ngiven to indigenous peoples and ethnic minorities, \r\nwhich are often subject to discrimination. The rights of \r\npersons with disabilities must be made visible and \r\naddressed in activities related to the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals at all levels. \r\n In 2004, we decided that globalization should \r\nalso be reformed, because only fair globalization could \r\nbe a positive force for all the peoples of the world. We \r\nmust create conditions for sustainable economic \r\ngrowth leading to decent jobs. This is essential for \r\nreducing poverty. \r\n There is a strong link between climate issues and \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. Progress in work \r\nrelated to climate change benefits our efforts to achieve \r\nthe MDGs. We also need to protect biodiversity and \r\necosystems, which contribute to efficient, long-term \r\nadaptation to climate change. Finland is looking \r\nforward to a fruitful high-level event on biodiversity, to \r\nbe held tomorrow. \r\n The Secretary-General has set up a High-level \r\nPanel on Global Sustainability to formulate a new \r\nvision for sustainable growth and prosperity. I am \r\nhonoured to co-chair the Panel, together with President \r\nJacob Zuma of South Africa. After the first meeting of \r\n A/65/PV.5\r\n \r\n3 10-54298 \r\n \r\nthe Panel on Sunday, I could tell, even in the very short \r\ntime we had, that the Panel is determined to put \r\nforward new ideas in order to meet the challenge. \r\n We in Finland strongly believe that the \r\nMillennium Development Goals can be achieved. A \r\nstrong multilateral system is a vital key to this end. The \r\nGoals can be achieved only through cooperation and \r\nequal participation. Developed and developing \r\ncountries alike must be able to participate in and be \r\ncommitted to global decision-making. \r\n Finally, 10 years ago, I had the honour to chair \r\nthe United Nations Millennium Summit with former \r\nPresident Sam Nujoma of Namibia. I remember well \r\nthe enthusiastic spirit at that meeting. Let us keep that \r\nspirit in our hearts and turn the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals into the life of the people. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): \r\nThe Assembly will now hear an address by His \r\nExcellency Mr. Pál Schmitt, President of the Republic \r\nof Hungary. \r\n President Schmitt: As we all know, lasting peace \r\ncannot be achieved unless large population groups find \r\nways in which to break out of poverty. Every single \r\nindividual on Earth has both the potential and the right \r\nto live a decent life. This is a collective challenge. \r\nTherefore, collective thinking and multifaceted actions \r\nare needed in order to meet the diverse, yet closely \r\ninterconnected set of goals lying ahead of us. \r\n Hungary strongly advocates a holistic approach to \r\nattaining the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). \r\nConsciously targeted policies are required to reach the \r\nGoals on which we are lagging behind, and full policy \r\ncoherence is needed in order to accelerate the process. \r\n While emphasizing that all MDGs are equally \r\nimportant and interrelated, Hungary believes that \r\neradicating extreme poverty and hunger would \r\nsignificantly contribute to the fulfilment of the other \r\nGoals. A comprehensive approach to food security is \r\nessential, and we are of the view that sustainable \r\nagricultural development based on local resources, \r\nopportunities and ecological aspects is a vital element \r\nof this. \r\n As recent MDG progress reviews have revealed, \r\nrural communities in particular suffer from a lack of \r\ndevelopment. We feel that an emphasis on rural \r\ndevelopment and improvement of rural living \r\nconditions can contribute to the reduction of urban \r\nmigration and therefore help reduce the build-up of \r\nslums. \r\n The security of water supplies, proper water \r\nmanagement, access to clean water and sanitation are \r\ncore elements of the overarching priorities of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. Hungary is \r\ncommitted to further sharing its experiences in this \r\nfield with its partners. Let me point out in this regard \r\nthat water will also be one of the main themes of the \r\nforthcoming Hungarian presidency of the Council of \r\nthe European Union in the first half of the coming year. \r\n Hungary is convinced that there can be no \r\nsustainable development without improving capacity in \r\nhuman resources. Education empowers individuals \r\nwith the skills and knowledge they need to shape the \r\nfuture, protect our limited resources and participate in \r\nbuilding more peaceful societies. Education, especially \r\nfor women and girls living in poverty, not only \r\nprovides opportunities for a better future, but is also a \r\nkey for survival. Economic growth and political \r\ndemocracy are also held back unless women participate \r\non an equal footing with men. Access to inclusive, \r\nfunctional and quality education, corresponding to the \r\nneeds of our rapidly changing world, is also essential.  \r\n But the importance of physical education should \r\nnot be neglected either. My insistence and \r\ndetermination on this subject will certainly be \r\nunderstood when considerate is recalled that I am \r\nprobably the only Head of State in this Hall who is \r\nactually an Olympic champion. Sport is not only \r\nbeneficial to health, but it also teaches discipline, \r\ndetermination, fellowship and respect for each other.  \r\n Similarly, special attention needs to be attributed \r\nto multilingual education, including learning in one’s \r\nmother tongue, both at the level of communities and \r\namong individuals. Coherent and sustainable policies \r\nare needed in order to implement these priorities, as \r\nthis is an area where results become tangible only in \r\nthe long run. \r\n Meeting global health challenges is also a \r\npriority, since the development of human resources \r\nrelies largely on the improvement of the health sector, \r\nextensive access to health care and increasing of the \r\nlocal capacities of national health systems. Hungary \r\ncan contribute to this process by offering its experience \r\nin building national health care networks, \r\nimplementing infant vaccination systems and sharing \r\nA/65/PV.5  \r\n \r\n10-54298 4 \r\n \r\nits professional knowledge and new technological \r\ndevelopments in the field of medical devices.  \r\n With regard to one particular area — maternal \r\nhealth — I would like to draw attention to the unique \r\nHungarian system of health visitors network covering \r\nthe entire country, under which specialized nurses \r\nregularly visit pregnant women and mothers with \r\nnewborn babies, even in the smallest communities. We \r\nare ready to share our experiences in this field with our \r\ndevelopment partners, and in this way contribute to \r\nprogress in maternal and infant health-related MDGs. \r\n Benefiting from the results and opportunities of \r\nscientific progress and new technologies is a crucial \r\ncomponent of achieving our development goals. Many \r\ndeveloping countries have obtained remarkable results \r\nin this field. Since 2003, Hungary has organized the \r\nbiennial World Science Forum, a unique global \r\ninitiative in that domain, which gives a strategic \r\nperspective to the linkages between science and \r\ndevelopment, with a particular focus on the needs of \r\nthe most vulnerable countries. \r\n Development is a partnership. It is our future \r\nwhich is at stake now. Therefore, it is our common \r\nresponsibility to make every effort to accomplish our \r\ncommitments. We strive not only for an efficient, \r\neconomically well-functioning international system, \r\nbut also for a harmonious, dignified and human world. \r\nLet us work together for a sustainable future. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): \r\nThe Assembly will now hear an address by His \r\nExcellency Mr. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, President of \r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran. \r\n President Ahmadinejad (spoke in Farsi; English \r\ntext provided by the delegation): I praise Almighty God \r\nfor granting me the opportunity to attend this \r\ngathering. \r\n Throughout the ages, humankind has aspired to \r\nlead a prosperous life full of beauty, serenity, amity \r\nand moral and spiritual perfection. We have had \r\nthousands of years of somewhat bitter and sweet \r\nexperience, along with abundant opportunities to build \r\na better future, in conformity with the true dignity of \r\nhumankind and as the most gracious creation of God \r\ndeserves. \r\n The most serious problems of the past millennia \r\nwere derived from inhumane and infected credos, \r\naccompanied by unfair and cruel management. In fact, \r\nthe undemocratic and unjust governance structures of \r\nthe international economic and political decision-\r\nmaking bodies are the reasons for most of the plights \r\nthat humankind is confronting today. Greedy liberal \r\ncapitalism and transnational corporations have caused \r\nthe suffering of countless women, men and children in \r\nmany countries.  \r\n The first decade of the current millennium, \r\nalthough designated by the General Assembly as the \r\nInternational Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-\r\nviolence for the Children of the World, was \r\nunfortunately marred by war, occupation, carnage, \r\nadventurism and intimidation. Fundamental reform of \r\nthis undemocratic and unjust system is essential if we \r\nwish to create a fair and open one. \r\n The world needs a comprehensive and, of course, \r\njust and humane order in which the rights of all are \r\npreserved and peace and security safeguarded. The \r\nformation and functioning of this new order would \r\nrequire two decisive factors: a theoretical basis and \r\nessential structures and managerial methods. \r\n It is my firm belief that, in the new millennium, \r\nwe need to revert to the divine mindset, to the true \r\nnature for which man was created and, indeed, to just \r\nand fair governance. A divine mindset based on the \r\nperfectionist and justice-seeking nature of humankind \r\nand on a monotheistic worldview is in fact the very \r\nheavenly mindset that makes man’s blissful talents \r\nblossom. Such a mindset should be humankind’s \r\nguiding principle to ensure a prosperous social life, \r\nliberating its economic, cultural and political outlook \r\nfrom egoism, hegemonic tendencies and envy. \r\nMeanwhile, just and fair governance based on a divine \r\nmindset is a critical guarantor for the realization of \r\njustice, love and security in society. \r\n Peoples and nations seek their eminence, dreams \r\nand aspirations in developing amicable relations and \r\nfair cooperation, and find their identity through \r\ncoexistence with others. Those who have not felt \r\njustice within their souls and are unable to control their \r\nrage and selfish desires; those who do not feel \r\ncompassionate towards others; those who are not \r\nmoved when people’s rights are breached and \r\nwidespread carnage is unleashed; and those who are \r\nmindful only of their own interests and their selfish, \r\nsectarian and materialistic pleasures cannot uphold \r\njustice or bring about prosperity. \r\n A/65/PV.5\r\n \r\n5 10-54298 \r\n \r\n The third millennium ought to be a time for \r\npursuing a new order based on pure and righteous \r\ngovernance throughout the world and in the centres of \r\npower. \r\n Now that the discriminatory order of capitalism \r\nand hegemonic approaches are facing defeat and \r\nnearing their end, all-out participation in upholding \r\njustice and prosperous interrelations is essential. All \r\nshould participate in a coordinated effort to establish \r\ncompetent governance in the centres of world power \r\nand to secure serenity, welfare, friendship and \r\nsustainable peace and security. \r\n Since this great ideal is attainable only through \r\nthe participation of all nations and States, I wish to \r\npropose that the second decade of this century be \r\ndesignated by the United Nations as a decade for joint \r\nglobal governance, and request all heads of State, \r\nthinkers and global reformers, through consultation and \r\nempathy, to spare no effort in practical planning for the \r\nrealization of this noble goal. \r\n Undoubtedly, this is the prelude to the bright \r\ndestiny of humankind promised by God, all the \r\nprophets, the righteous and the saints, which will occur \r\nwith the resurrection of the promised one, along with \r\nthe Jesus. Let us join hands and make the third \r\nmillennium an era in which all good deeds and beauties \r\nprevail and justice is upheld. Let us please God by \r\nfounding compassionate coexistence throughout the \r\nworld. \r\n Peace be upon the promised one who will bring \r\njustice. Peace be upon all good-hearted people and \r\njustice-seekers. Peace be upon those who have love for \r\nhumankind in their hearts and the dream of \r\nhumankind’s progress and eminence in their minds. \r\nPeace be upon the millennium of freedom, \r\nrighteousness and beauty. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): \r\nThe Assembly will now hear an address by His \r\nExcellency Mr. Edward Natapei, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Vanuatu. \r\n Mr. Natapei (Vanuatu): The leaders of the Pacific \r\nIslands Forum remain concerned about the pace of our \r\nprogress towards achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). Despite steady progress \r\ntowards achieving the MDGs and improved levels of \r\nhuman development, many of our countries that are \r\nsmall island developing States (SIDS) are struggling to \r\nachieve the Goals. The Pacific’s progress towards \r\nachievement of the MDGs and consequently improved \r\nlevels of human development has been uneven. While \r\ngains have been made, there remain threats to such \r\nprogress due to the inherent vulnerability of SIDS, as \r\narticulated in the Barbados Programme of Action and \r\nthe Mauritius Strategy for its Further Implementation. \r\n The increasing vulnerability of Pacific Island \r\ncountries to threats and challenges has been \r\nhighlighted by the impact of the global economic, \r\nfinancial, fuel and food crises, and compounded by the \r\ncurrent and impending impact of climate change, as \r\nwell as our inherently limited capacity to cope. \r\n At the same time, the challenges of poverty and \r\nhardship, food security, affordable and sustainable \r\nenergy, isolation, limited economies of scale, the \r\nglobal recession and climate change are all interrelated \r\nand cannot be effectively tackled on their own, or by us \r\nalone. \r\n In underscoring the Pacific leaders’ commitment \r\nto accelerating progress towards achieving the MDGs \r\nby 2015, the Port Vila Declaration on Accelerating \r\nProgress on the Achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals was adopted by Pacific Forum \r\nleaders at their recent meeting in Vanuatu. The Port \r\nVila Declaration recognizes that the MDGs are \r\nextremely important, as is the incremental path taken \r\ntowards those Goals. This path should recognize and \r\naccommodate the special circumstances and challenges \r\nwe face in the Pacific. \r\n However, without concerted action and \r\ncommitment, the Port Vila Declaration will not likely \r\nsucceed. In this context, the Pacific region calls for \r\ngreater investment by Governments and their \r\ndevelopment partners alike in sustainable and inclusive \r\ndevelopment approaches; the scaling-up of investment \r\nin gender equality and the empowerment of women and \r\nthe most vulnerable in our communities, including \r\ninvestment in technology and infrastructure in all \r\naspects of development and development processes; \r\nmore systematic approaches to involving the non-\r\ngovernmental sector in the planning and \r\nimplementation of national and regional development \r\npriorities based on their comparative expertise; \r\ninvestment in data and information management \r\nsystems; improved understanding and ability to address \r\nour vulnerabilities; and improved coordination of \r\nefforts towards achieving the MDGs. \r\nA/65/PV.5  \r\n \r\n10-54298 6 \r\n \r\n Despite a number of challenges facing the Pacific \r\nregion, there exist strong signs of potential and success \r\nin the progress made to achieve the MDGs. These \r\nwindows of opportunity highlight the importance of \r\nlocalizing the MDGs in national and regional plans and \r\nprogrammes, and building up the collaboration \r\nbetween the whole of Government and the non-\r\ngovernmental sector in the areas of greatest need for \r\nthe Pacific island peoples. The coordinated support of \r\nour development partners in this respect is also a \r\ncritical ingredient. \r\n I draw attention to the progress made by the \r\nPacific region on MDG 2, on achieving universal \r\nprimary education. The primary education systems of \r\nthe Pacific region are characterized by high enrolment, \r\nwith six countries currently displaying net enrolment \r\nratios of over 90 per cent. At present, five Pacific \r\nisland countries are on track to achieve the MDG 2 \r\ntarget, with a further six countries having made \r\nsignificant progress. Equally, all Pacific island \r\ncountries are expected to meet the goal of gender \r\nequality in education by 2015.  \r\n Many Pacific countries have also localized the \r\nglobal indicators by amending them to suit local \r\ncircumstances and priorities. In some cases, additional \r\ndevelopment goals in the context of the MDGs have \r\nbeen included and indicators changed to make them \r\nmore relevant. \r\n With this level of progress, we are under no \r\nillusion about the enormous scale of the task ahead of \r\nus as sovereign nations and as a region with its own \r\nunique challenges and circumstances. Much work \r\nneeds to be done to accelerate sustainable progress, in \r\nparticular to make economic growth more inclusive \r\nand sustainable, strengthen social protections and \r\nreduce persistent gender gaps, ensure financial \r\ninclusion, extend regional cooperation and – of \r\nparticular importance to the Pacific region – boost \r\ntechnical cooperation and development assistance. That \r\nsaid, both the acceleration and the sustainability of \r\nprogress must be pursued together through approaches \r\nthat factor in exchange rate differences, progress \r\namong Pacific countries and their various levels of \r\nvulnerability. \r\n To this end, the Pacific region remains resolute in \r\nits commitments under the Millennium Declaration and \r\ncalls on its neighbours in this global village, \r\nGovernments and development partners alike, to share \r\nin our efforts as we strive to achieve livelihoods for our \r\npeoples and our communities and, most of all, for our \r\nfuture. \r\n At the national level, my country, Vanuatu, has \r\nsome positive MDG results to report. For the past \r\n10 years our Government, with development partner \r\nsupport, has made major achievements in developing \r\nand implementing its national strategy for \r\ndevelopment, which is focused on economic growth for \r\nall, through prudent macroeconomic policies and fiscal \r\ncontrols, providing basic services, transport and \r\ncommunications to every community in Vanuatu, and \r\nin the area of legislative reform. \r\n All policies and strategies within each sector are \r\nlinked in order to achieve the national vision of an \r\neducated, safe, healthy and wealthy Vanuatu. This has \r\nresulted in many communities — including some of the \r\nmost remote — recording impressive successes. The \r\nimplementation of fee-free primary education has seen \r\nenrolment increase by 20 per cent from 2005 to 2010, \r\nwith primary school gross enrolment at approximately \r\n95 per cent in 2010. \r\n In health, there have been a number of significant \r\nachievements related to staffing levels, suitably trained \r\npersonnel, equipment and facilities, and disease \r\ntreatment. For example, the incidence of malaria \r\ndecreased from 198 per 1,000 people in 1990 to 13 per \r\n1,000 people in 2009. The rate now is almost 15 times \r\nless than it was in 1990 - a major achievement. Health \r\nprofessionals are now resourced to work in \r\ncommunities to identify and treat the major diseases \r\nmalaria and tuberculosis. Ironically, these increased \r\nefforts have resulted in some increases in the MDG \r\nindicators for these diseases. The incidence and death \r\nrates are in fact unchanged, but what has changed is \r\nour ability to diagnose and treat these major threats to \r\nhealth. \r\n My Government acknowledges the contributions \r\nof those who have partnered with us in our \r\ndevelopment efforts, resulting in gains that they are \r\nable to report on. The contribution and participation of \r\nnon-governmental organizations (NGOs) in our \r\ncollective and ongoing efforts towards sustainable \r\ndevelopment in Vanuatu must also be acknowledged. \r\nThey have made their influence felt. From debt relief \r\nand disease to good governance and human rights, the \r\nglobal NGO revolution — a revolution experienced in \r\nVanuatu and the Pacific — has helped move the global \r\n A/65/PV.5\r\n \r\n7 10-54298 \r\n \r\nagenda and given new life and new meaning to the idea \r\nof an international community. \r\n It is my belief that, with strong political \r\nleadership at all levels, backed by evidence-based and \r\nwell-targeted interventions and adequate resources and \r\ncoupled with strengthened partnerships, the MDGs can \r\nbe met. \r\n I am pleased to report further that Vanuatu’s \r\nsecond MDG progress report has just been completed. \r\nIt is based on currently available data and reflects the \r\nviews of many stakeholders from different \r\nbackgrounds and areas of interest and expertise. The \r\nreport highlights a number of interventions that could \r\nhelp to accelerate progress towards reaching our goals \r\nby 2015. We are grateful for the support provided by \r\nthe United Nations Development Programme to MDG \r\nmonitoring in Vanuatu through assistance provided in \r\nmainstreaming MDGs into sectoral development plans \r\nand policies and in the drafting of the report. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): \r\nThe Assembly will now hear an address by Her \r\nExcellency Mrs. Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, President of the \r\nRepublic of Liberia. \r\n President Johnson-Sirleaf: We are here because \r\nwe share a fundamental belief that poverty, illiteracy, \r\ndisease and inequality do not belong in the twenty-first \r\ncentury. We share a common purpose: to eradicate \r\nthese ills for the benefit of all. And we share a common \r\ntool to achieve this: the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs). \r\n The MDGs are universal, but their impact will be \r\ngreatest in the world’s poorest nations, mainly those in \r\nsub-Saharan Africa, like my own country, Liberia. But \r\nit is also in Africa that we have seen the difference the \r\nMDGs have been making. They have mobilized the \r\ninternational community, donor countries and \r\nGovernments around a common set of targets. \r\n We have made progress. Eleven low-income \r\nAfrican countries are among the 20 top performers. \r\nHowever, it is clear that the continent still has far to \r\ngo; yet I know that if we intensify our focus and \r\nefforts, we will ultimately achieve them. \r\n My message is this: As we renew our resolve in \r\n2010, we must recognize the need for inclusive \r\neconomic growth. We need rapid, stable and sustained \r\ngrowth that creates jobs, especially for young people \r\nand in sectors that benefit the poor and increase \r\nopportunities for women. \r\n The Goals are global, but their impact is local. \r\nEach country has a distinct context and a unique vision \r\nof development. We must therefore take stock, listen to \r\nour people and choose the path that will bring to life \r\nthe vision of the MDGs. \r\n In Liberia, we are implementing the Goals in a \r\nmore challenging context. As we embark upon the \r\nprocess of rebuilding and renewal, we have focused on \r\nnational reconciliation, rebuilding our governance \r\nsystems and institutions, and reforming our security \r\nand rule of law sectors. In spite of our unique \r\nchallenges, we have remained committed to the MDGs. \r\nOur progress so far bears the fruits of that \r\ncommitment. \r\n Liberia has made appreciable progress, especially \r\non MDG 3, on gender equality and women’s \r\nempowerment; MDG 4, on infant mortality, MDG 6, on \r\nHIV/AIDS and tuberculosis; MDG 7, on access to \r\nclean drinking water and sanitation; and MDG 8, on a \r\nglobal partnership for development. We have shown \r\nthat, with improved coordination, appropriate policies \r\nand strong development partnerships, Liberia has the \r\npotential to progress rapidly on several of the MDGs. \r\n Despite that progress, a substantial effort is \r\nneeded to advance poverty reduction, achieve universal \r\nprimary education, reduce maternal mortality and \r\nensure access to sanitation. In that regard, we face \r\nhuge challenges in the areas of infrastructure, capital \r\nand human resources. We understand the \r\ninterdependence and synergies among the MDGs, yet \r\nour challenging environment makes it difficult to \r\naccord equal priority to all the Goals. It is therefore \r\nimportant that we focus on a subset of goals that are \r\nachievable. \r\n As we move forward, we will focus on universal \r\nprimary education, child and maternal mortality, and \r\npoverty reduction through a modernized and linked \r\nagriculture sector. In that regard, our global \r\npartnerships, with which we have had great success, \r\nmust go beyond aid to support enhancement in trade \r\nthrough the removal of trade barriers. That will break \r\nthe link between aid and the MDGs.  \r\n Investing in agriculture, small-scale enterprises \r\nand infrastructure will help progress across all the \r\nMDGs. We are working especially hard to develop \r\nA/65/PV.5  \r\n \r\n10-54298 8 \r\n \r\nsmall and medium-sized enterprises because they have \r\nthe greatest impact on employment. To enhance the \r\nproductivity of the economy and sustain progress \r\ntowards the MDGs, we must invest in human capacity \r\nand strengthen public and private institutions.  \r\n One of the key drivers of success in Liberia is \r\nthat our policies reflect our people’s priorities in such a \r\nway that each step is nationally recognized and owned. \r\nCombined with our efforts to rebuild security, control \r\ncorruption and provide quality public services, those \r\nmeasures will ensure that our long-term development \r\ngoal is aligned with the MDGs and with our vision for \r\na prosperous and independent Liberia. \r\n As leaders, we intend to renew our effort to look \r\nbeyond 2015 to how we can consolidate, protect and \r\naccelerate the progress. The Goals are our means to an \r\nend and to a more educated, resourceful, prosperous \r\nand empowered people.  \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): \r\nThe Assembly will now hear an address by His \r\nExcellency Mr. Danilo Türk, President of the Republic \r\nof Slovenia. \r\n President Türk: Amid turmoil and action, there \r\ncomes a moment for reflection and thought, and such a \r\nmoment is now. Slovenia is grateful to Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for his initiative and \r\nindefatigable work in the preparation of this much-\r\nneeded and welcome summit. We are grateful to all \r\nDevelopment partner who were involved in the process \r\nof its preparation and, above all, to those who work \r\nday by day for the implementation of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals with a great sense of commitment. \r\n Sometimes critics say that the targets set by the \r\nMillennium Development Goals are arbitrary and \r\nunrealistic. Such a point of view is erroneous and \r\ndevoid of an understanding of the history that gave rise \r\nto the Millennium Development Goals. Let me just \r\nrecall the basic facts of that history. \r\n Two and a half decades ago, the General \r\nAssembly adopted the Declaration on the Right to \r\nDevelopment (resolution 41/128, annex), a seminal \r\ndocument that expressed high moral aspirations to \r\nfairness in development. The General Assembly called \r\nfor development that benefits all and allows human \r\npotential to be expressed to the full. In the Declaration, \r\nwe find the notion that the full realization of human \r\nrights is possible only through economic and social \r\ndevelopment. \r\n But what is development? Here I come to the \r\nsecond historical point. The United Nations provided \r\nthe answer through a series of global conferences, held \r\nin the 1990s, which thoroughly examined the pertinent \r\naspects, from the economic and environmental to the \r\nsocial and gender dimensions of development, and \r\ndefined specific action plans for each of those aspects. \r\nAll that work was the basis for the formulation of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals and their specific, \r\nquantifiable targets. Those targets are neither arbitrary \r\nnor unrealistic. They are the result of solid work, real \r\nexperience and mature policymaking. \r\n Realism, ambition, high moral expectation and \r\nmethodical sophistication have driven the process from \r\nits beginning, and they should continue to guide our \r\nwork today and in the future. That is necessary because \r\nof the intrinsic importance of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals to humankind. Moreover, I \r\nemphasize very strongly that it is necessary to \r\nunderstand that the Millennium Development Goals \r\nrepresent a critical test of the vitality of the United \r\nNations and multilateralism today. \r\n As we look at the level of achievement today, we \r\nsee a mixed story — to use a term familiar from recent \r\nUnited Nations documents. But a mixed story is also a \r\nstory of success, or at least of partial success. Some \r\nparts of the world, including most recently in Africa, \r\nhave experienced relatively high, and in some cases \r\neven very high growth rates. In the global North, where \r\ngrowth had been high in the past, we see the \r\nphenomenon of saturated economies and the need to \r\nmeasure development by factors unrelated to growth in \r\nthe gross national product. \r\n However, we have to be focused, and we have to \r\nbe focused on poverty-stricken parts of the world \r\nwhere we do see gradual improvement. It is significant \r\nthat in many parts of the developing world longevity \r\nhas risen and the incidence of AIDS has declined. \r\nLevels of primary school enrolment have improved, \r\nand new information technologies have provided \r\nadditional opportunities for education. \r\n While the list of successes is significant, \r\nimportant policy challenges remain. First and foremost, \r\ncountry ownership and leadership in policy design and \r\nimplementation has to be respected. Internationally \r\norganized budget support and official development \r\n A/65/PV.5\r\n \r\n9 10-54298 \r\n \r\nassistance can be made most effective on that basis — \r\nthat is, on the basis of national ownership and \r\nleadership.  \r\n Policymaking — any policymaking — requires a \r\ncareful definition of priorities. The Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals provide a useful methodological \r\nframework for that purpose and a bold yet realistic \r\ntime horizon. Obviously, it is for the national \r\nGovernments to set the priorities for their respective \r\ncountries. They are the ones to decide on the needed \r\nmeasures to ensure better food security and basic \r\nhealth care for the population. They are the ones \r\nresponsible for the allocation of resources to improve \r\nthe availability of safe water and improved sanitation, \r\nas explained by, among others, Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, \r\nthe President of Liberia, in the commentary she just \r\ngave. The national Governments are the ones to set the \r\ntargets for primary education and for the development \r\nof comprehensive educational systems that will enable \r\npeople, in particular women and girls, to enjoy \r\nadequate opportunities for education, including higher \r\neducation. \r\n Governments bear the primary responsibility for \r\nall basic policies. But they have to be supported by \r\neffective international cooperation. In a globalized \r\nworld the effectiveness of international cooperation has \r\nto grow. Official development assistance, while \r\ntemporarily weakened by the recent recession, has to \r\nbe strengthened. The international financial institutions \r\nhave to be modernized. This task includes the much-\r\nneeded revision of quotas within the International \r\nMonetary Fund. Multilateral trade negotiations need to \r\nbe restarted and protectionist barriers removed, \r\neventually. Special attention in development financing \r\nand support has to be given to the least developed \r\namong developing countries. \r\n Let me in conclusion mention just one other \r\npoint. Yesterday, at the beginning of this summit, we \r\nheard the leaders of the World Bank, the International \r\nMonetary Fund and the World Trade Organization, who \r\nspoke about policy lending and targeting of investment, \r\nabout financing in macroeconomic stability and about \r\nthe benefits flowing from the global trading system. \r\nHowever, some fundamental questions remain open. \r\nThe conclusion of Doha Round trade negotiations is \r\nnot yet assured. Lending policies need to be constantly \r\nadapted to the implementation of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. Global economic governance will \r\nbe a critically important factor in the of achievement of \r\nthe Goals. Let us therefore encourage the key \r\ninstitutions of global economic governance to live up \r\nto the legitimate expectations of our era and of the \r\nmillions of people who depend on the effectiveness of \r\ntheir work. That is the concluding point I wish to \r\nmake. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): \r\nThe Assembly will now hear an address by His \r\nExcellency Mr. Tillman Thomas, Prime Minister and \r\nMinister of National Security, Information and Legal \r\nAffairs of Grenada. \r\n Mr. Thomas (Grenada): In an address to the \r\nEuropean Union, United Nations Secretary-General \r\nBan Ki-moon reminded the world that the Millennium \r\nDeclaration represents the most important promise ever \r\nmade to the world’s most vulnerable people — a \r\npromise, he added, that must be kept. Today, I am \r\nhonoured to be among the leaders striving to keep that \r\npromise. \r\n In the year 2000, Grenada was among the \r\nMember States of the United Nations who adopted the \r\nMillennium Declaration. However, our ability to fully \r\ndeliver on our commitments was affected by a number \r\nof economic and environmental shocks. These included \r\ntwo hurricanes, one of which destroyed 90 per cent of \r\nour country’s economy, with damages estimated at over \r\n212 per cent of our gross domestic product. Despite \r\nour steady recovery, the advent of the global economic \r\ncrisis has further delayed our progress in achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). \r\n Since the signing of the Declaration, there have \r\nbeen many initiatives to address the human \r\ndevelopment needs of our country. The thrust of \r\nGrenada’s 2000 budget, under the theme “Growth, \r\nEquity and People’s Participation in the New \r\nMillennium”, initiated a number of programmes aimed \r\nat improving and monitoring living conditions. \r\n A poverty assessment for the year 1998 indicated \r\nthat 32.1 per cent of our people were living below the \r\npoverty line. Ten years later, in 2008, that figure had \r\nincreased to 37.7 per cent, reflecting to some extent the \r\n212 per cent damage to our economy. Those results \r\nhave further informed our Government’s policies and \r\nplans for investment in the social sector and for \r\nmainstreaming the MDGs into its national development \r\nframework.  \r\nA/65/PV.5  \r\n \r\n10-54298 10 \r\n \r\n Grenada views the MDGs as an integral tool for \r\nmeasuring national performance. The Government \r\ncontinues to implement a number of safety-net \r\nprogrammes aimed at improving the living conditions \r\nof our people. We expect these programmes to greatly \r\nassist in our plans to eradicate poverty and hunger. \r\n The importance of education in eradicating \r\npoverty is well known. I am happy to report that \r\nGrenada has fully achieved the Goal of universal \r\nprimary education and is on the way to achieving \r\nuniversal secondary education. It is our plan that by \r\n2011 we will reach this target. Despite our limited \r\nresources we have also made significant strides in \r\nimproving the literacy of our people through the \r\nintroduction of a community-based literacy programme. \r\n With regard to the promotion of gender equality \r\nand the empowerment of women, Grenada has partially \r\nachieved this Goal. Gender parity exists at all levels in \r\nour education system. The records reveal that our \r\nfemales have been consistently outperforming our \r\nmales during the last decade. Grenada has also actively \r\npromoted the removal of disparities in income and \r\noccupational opportunities for women at all levels and \r\nin every sector of our economy. \r\n In the area of child mortality, Grenada has made \r\nconsiderable progress. We have reduced child mortality \r\nby 53 per cent in the period from 2006 to 2009 for \r\ninfants under the age of five. Over the past 10 to \r\n15 years, we have been able to maintain an average \r\nimmunization rate of 95 per cent. We have also made \r\nsignificant strides in maternal health care. Women are \r\nprovided with professional prenatal care by \r\nobstetricians at our national network of health clinics. \r\n Grenada continues its efforts to combat \r\nHIV/AIDS, with funding from the World Bank and the \r\nClinton Foundation. Our various initiatives have \r\nrecorded positive results. In the area of mother-to-child \r\ntransmission, we have seen a marked reduction in the \r\nnumber of babies born with HIV. With the advent of \r\nthe introduction of free medication, there has been a \r\nreduction in morbidity and mortality. I note, however, \r\nthat the current economic difficulties threaten the \r\nsustainability of these achievements. Despite these \r\nachievements, there has been an increase in the \r\nincidence of new HIV cases. It means, therefore, that \r\nfunding is required to continue our efforts in \r\ncombating this deadly disease, and we call for such \r\nsupport. \r\n At the same time, non-communicable diseases are \r\nat worrying levels, with 16.2 per cent of the population \r\naffected. Grenada supports the call for a high-level \r\nmeeting by the United Nations on non-communicable \r\ndiseases. \r\n Grenada is strongly committed to integrating the \r\nprinciples of sustainable development into our \r\ncountry’s policies and programmes. That is reflected in \r\nour national environmental policy and management \r\nstrategy, our draft management and sustainable \r\ndevelopment bill and the institutionalization of our \r\nSustainable Development Council. \r\n This week is important for the review of the \r\nprogress of the MDGs, as well as, for us small island \r\ndeveloping States, for the review of the Mauritius \r\nStrategy for Implementation and for the High-level \r\nBiodiversity Meeting. This week also marks the start of \r\nthe twentieth anniversary of the founding of the \r\nAlliance of Small Island States (AOSIS). As Chair of \r\nAOSIS, Grenada wishes to thank all the partners who \r\nhave supported the Alliance in the past and are now \r\ncommitted to enhancing that support.  \r\n In order for Grenada to realize all of the MDGs \r\nby 2015, there is a dire need for us to build global \r\npartnerships.  \r\n Grenada is considered a middle-income country \r\nwith a high level of human development. The 2009 \r\nHuman Development Report ranked Grenada seventy-\r\nfourth of 182 countries. While this rating highlights \r\ndevelopment progress made in Grenada, it tends to \r\nmask its specific, multidimensional vulnerabilities as a \r\nsmall island developing State. Grenada had just joined \r\nother United Nations Member States in becoming a \r\nsignatory to the Millennium Declaration when the \r\nterrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 occurred. The \r\nsubsequent decline in tourism revenue, coupled with \r\nthe passing of Hurricane Ivan in 2004, left a regressive \r\nmark on our economic situation. Less than a year later, \r\nanother hurricane — Emily — struck our island, \r\nworsening previous damage and slowing our recovery \r\nefforts. \r\n Despite these challenges, Grenada has made \r\nprogress as a result of factors that enhance our \r\nresilience: our strong and consistent investment in the \r\nsocial sector, our tradition of democratic governance, \r\nour vibrant community-based organizations and the \r\ninvolvement in social development by non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, our ability to mobilize \r\n A/65/PV.5\r\n \r\n11 10-54298 \r\n \r\nresources, the resilience of our people, our pursuit of \r\nsound economic management, and our participation in \r\nmultilateralism. \r\n Our Government remains steadfastly committed \r\nto achieving the Millennium Development Goals. \r\nThere is much to be achieved in Grenada and in the \r\nwhole world, where the impact of the MDGs must be \r\nfelt. \r\n In conclusion, Grenada calls on the United \r\nNations to assist developing countries in strengthening \r\nthe institutional capacity necessary for mainstreaming \r\nand monitoring the MDGs. Drawing on this support \r\nand our best efforts, we will be closer to achieving \r\nthese Millennium Development Goals by 2015. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): \r\nThe Assembly will now hear an address by Her \r\nExcellency Ms. Angela Merkel, Chancellor of the \r\nFederal Republic of Germany. \r\n Ms. Merkel (Germany) (spoke in German; \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): The United \r\nNations Millennium Declaration of 2000 has given \r\ninternational development policy a qualitatively new \r\nbasis and a new legitimacy. It was a ground-breaking \r\nstrategic decision that placed the much touted global \r\ndevelopment partnership on one common basis. It has \r\nshown that we can fight poverty, disease and hunger \r\nsuccessfully only through a new partnership between \r\ndonor and recipient countries and with a clear \r\ndefinition of goals.  \r\n Supported by universal principles, the \r\nDeclaration is the framework for how we shape \r\nglobalization equitably, in the spirit of the United \r\nNations human rights charter. It sets out four areas in \r\nwhich action must be taken: peace and security, \r\npoverty reduction, protection of the environment, and \r\npromotion of human rights, democracy and good \r\ngovernance.  \r\n The Millennium Development Goals spell out \r\nthese areas in concrete terms. Some Goals are \r\nquantitative. They represent the central international \r\nreference for development policy. The German Federal \r\nGovernment has also based its development policy on \r\nthese Goals, thus strengthening the collective effort of \r\nall. \r\n Sustainable progress on development requires \r\nthat all four challenges be tackled, as they are mutually \r\ndependent. I am firmly convinced, therefore, that the \r\nDeclaration and the Millennium Development Goals \r\nmust not be interpreted as a kind of menu from which \r\none can chose what one likes best. For we know this is \r\ntrue all over the world: there is no development \r\nwithout security and no security without development. \r\nDevelopment policy measures cannot be effective \r\nwithout security, and in turn peacekeeping efforts will \r\nlead to nothing if there are no development prospects. \r\nThis shows how right former Secretary-General Kofi \r\nAnnan was when he called development policy an \r\ninvestment in a secure future. \r\n Most importantly, however, sustainable \r\ndevelopment and economic and social progress are \r\ninconceivable without good governance and respect for \r\nhuman rights. However, let us be honest: that sounds \r\nsimple in theory, but it is more difficult to translate the \r\ntheory into practice and to draw the necessary practical \r\nconsequences from it.  \r\n Ten years ago, the international community \r\nadopted the right goals. Unfortunately, today we have \r\nto admit that in all probability we will not achieve all \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals by 2015. But the \r\nGoals remain valid and must be implemented \r\nrigorously. As I see it, this should be the central \r\ncommitment of this summit, ten years after adoption of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. \r\n Noticeable progress has been made on certain \r\nindividual Millennium Development Goals. For \r\nexample, some progress has been made on basic \r\neducation, gender equality and combating hunger and \r\npoverty. However, hunger and malnutrition still prevail \r\nat an unacceptably high level. Even though 100 million \r\nfewer people have suffered from hunger this year, the \r\nnumber who still suffer from hunger, malnutrition and \r\npoverty in the world today is unacceptably high. We \r\nstill see considerable differences, both in the \r\nachievement of individual Goals and in achievements \r\nin reaching Goals in different regions. In parts of sub-\r\nSaharan Africa in particular there are still serious gaps. \r\nThe global economic and financial crisis made the \r\nprospects even worse for these vulnerable regions.  \r\n We need to ask ourselves, indeed, what we must \r\nand can do to make greater progress. There is no doubt \r\nthat we must further improve the effectiveness of \r\ndevelopment policy instruments. For me, the solution \r\nis obvious. We need more results orientation. In this \r\nregard, as I see it, results-based financing is a \r\npromising approach.  \r\nA/65/PV.5  \r\n \r\n10-54298 12 \r\n \r\n In all of my talks on the margins of this \r\nconference, I have quite often discussed this with our \r\npartners, and I must say that my remarks have met with \r\ngreat approval. A clear results orientation can be \r\ncombined with greater leeway for national policies. \r\nThis allows for better accommodation of the relevant \r\ncountry’s particularities. \r\n There is one thing that it is important that we all \r\naccept. The primary responsibility for development lies \r\nwith the Governments of the developing countries. It is \r\nin their hands to determine whether aid can be \r\neffective. For that reason, support for good governance \r\nis as important as aid itself. \r\n Looking at today’s emerging economies, we see \r\nthat development policy can ultimately be successful \r\nonly if there are national stewardship and national \r\nimplementation of the process. That also applies to \r\nmobilizing the necessary resources. The funding of \r\nofficial development assistance can, apart from \r\nemergency situations, be only a contribution to \r\nnational resources and never a substitute for them. \r\nDevelopment aid cannot continue indefinitely. What is \r\nimportant is therefore to use limited resources as \r\neffectively as possible. This can work only through \r\ngood governance that taps a country’s economic \r\npotential. \r\n The countries themselves must promote the \r\ndevelopment of a market economy, the setting-up and \r\nexpansion of small and medium-sized enterprises and \r\nthe strengthening of rural areas. There are, after all, an \r\nencouraging number of good projects. For without self-\r\nsustaining economic growth, developing countries will \r\nfind the road out of poverty and hunger far too steep to \r\ntravel. Without sustainable growth, the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals cannot be achieved; indeed, not \r\neven the current level of progress can be maintained. \r\n That is why Germany sees its role in development \r\ncooperation as a responsible supporter of countries’ \r\nown efforts within a broad-based partnership. We in \r\nGermany know where our strengths lie, but we are also \r\nonly too aware of our limitations. It is obvious that \r\nglobal problems call for global efforts. One example \r\nthat is actually working well is the Global Fund to \r\nFight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, a multilateral \r\ninstrument that has proven itself. The help of the Fund \r\nreaches people directly. Germany is the third-largest \r\ndonor, and I will work to ensure that Germany \r\ncontinues to support the Fund and promote efforts to \r\nimprove global health at a high level. \r\n The implementation of the Millennium \r\nDeclaration and the achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals depend on effective international \r\norganizations. That effectiveness is what people all \r\nover the world use as a yardstick for the United \r\nNations. It is up to us, the States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations, to make the Organization fit to meet \r\nthe challenges of the twenty-first century. Germany \r\nwill therefore continue to work resolutely for United \r\nNations reform. \r\n For the Federal Republic of Germany, the United \r\nNations, given its universality and consequent \r\nlegitimacy, is the central forum for international \r\ncooperation. Germany is the third-largest contributor to \r\nthe United Nations budget. We are also third among \r\ndonors of development aid. Even during the financial \r\ncrisis, we have not reduced our aid budget and we \r\ncontinue to strive to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent \r\nof official development assistance as a percentage of \r\ngross national income. \r\n We see ourselves as a reliable partner of the \r\nUnited Nations, convinced that understanding among \r\nnations can succeed only if cooperation is based on \r\nequality and equal rights for all countries. With this in \r\nmind, let me reaffirm Germany’s commitment and \r\nGermany’s responsibility as part of the collective \r\nresponsibility of the international community. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): \r\nThe Assembly will now hear an address by His \r\nExcellency Mr. Robert G. Mugabe, President of the \r\nRepublic of Zimbabwe. \r\n President Mugabe: I wish to thank the President \r\nof the General Assembly and Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon for convening this very important Meeting. It \r\nwill be recalled that we gathered in this Assembly in \r\nthe year 2000 and agreed on a set of social and \r\nhumanitarian deliverables that we appropriately called \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). We then \r\nset out separately and collectively as Member States to \r\nachieve our targets.  \r\n We now meet, five years before the target year \r\n2015, to review the state of implementation of those \r\nGoals, share experiences, identify obstacles and \r\npossibly chart a course of accelerated action to achieve \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. \r\n A/65/PV.5\r\n \r\n13 10-54298 \r\n \r\n While there is reason to celebrate the progress \r\nattained in some areas, the challenges that remain are \r\nserious and many. The recent economic and financial \r\ncrisis wreaked havoc on our previously confident \r\nmarch towards 2015. Resources dwindled, priorities \r\nhad to be rearranged, and for many of us in the \r\ndeveloping world, sources of support were reduced or \r\neven completely lost. Yet we remain determined, even \r\nin these circumstances, to achieve the MDGs in \r\nparticular, and other internationally agreed commitments \r\nin general. \r\n From the onset, Zimbabwe has demonstrated \r\nunwavering commitment towards the implementation \r\nof the MDGs. We set up an MDG steering committee \r\nin 2000 to track and report progress on \r\nimplementation. We initially prioritized Goals 1, 3 \r\nand 6 — Goal 1 being that to eradicate extreme poverty \r\nand hunger, Goal 3 to promote gender equality and \r\nempower women, and Goal 6 to combat HIV/AIDS, \r\nmalaria and other diseases – which we viewed as \r\ncritical to the achievement of all other Goals.  \r\n Even as our economy suffered from illegal \r\nsanctions imposed on the country by our detractors, we \r\ncontinued to deploy and direct a substantial part of our \r\nresources towards the achievement of the targets we \r\nhad set ourselves. Indeed, we find it very disturbing \r\nand regrettable that, after we all had agreed to work \r\ntowards the improvement of the lives of our citizens, \r\nsome countries should deliberately work to negate our \r\nown efforts in that direction by insisting on sanctions \r\nagainst Zimbabwe. I believe that, as we sit here today \r\nand rededicate ourselves to the achievement of the \r\nMDGs in the timeframe we set ourselves, this noble \r\neffort on our part will not reach fruition unless all of us \r\nwalk our talk. \r\n Our MDGs steering committee has produced \r\nthree reports since its formation. The reports show that \r\nwe have registered mixed results. Despite our best \r\nefforts, we fell short of our targets because of the \r\nillegal and debilitating sanctions imposed, to which I \r\nhave already referred, that have caused the incidence of \r\npoverty in Zimbabwe to remain quite high. \r\n As a result of these punitive measures and despite \r\nour turnaround economic plan, the Government of \r\nZimbabwe has been prevented from making a positive \r\ndifference in the lives of the poor, the hungry, the sick \r\nand the destitute among its citizens. This is regrettable \r\nbecause Zimbabwe has a stable economic and political \r\nenvironment. We have the resources, and, with the \r\nright kind of support from the international community, \r\nwe have the potential to improve the lives of our \r\npeople. \r\n Zimbabwe’s commitment to the education of its \r\npeople is well known. Since independence in 1980, \r\nthere has been a massive expansion in primary, \r\nsecondary and tertiary education. Much investment has \r\ngone into human capital development. Relevant \r\npolicies, including the early childhood development \r\npolicy, have ensured that net enrolment in schools \r\nremains high. As members may be aware, Sir, \r\naccording to recent UNESCO reports, Zimbabwe has \r\nthe highest literacy rate in Africa. \r\n I am also pleased to inform the Assembly that \r\nZimbabwe is set to reach the gender parity target in \r\nboth primary and secondary school enrolment. In \r\naddition, the country has made strides in attaining \r\ngender parity in enrolment and completion rates in \r\ntertiary education. We have signed and ratified a \r\nnumber of international and regional gender \r\ninstruments and promulgated national policies and laws \r\non gender. \r\n While we are lagging behind in regard to equal \r\nparticipation in decision-making in all sectors, we hope \r\nto make real progress in this regard by 2015. There has \r\nbeen a slight increase in the number of women \r\nparliamentarians from 14 per cent in 1990-1995, but it \r\nis still below the 2015 target of 30 per cent.  \r\n Regarding Goal 6, combat HIV/AIDS, malaria \r\nand other diseases, my country has registered \r\nsignificant progress in lowering the HIV/AIDS \r\nprevalence rate. The estimated prevalence rate in \r\npeople 15-49 years old was 23.7 per cent in 2001. This \r\nrate dropped to 18.1 per cent in 2005 and declined \r\nfurther to 14.3 percent in 2009. We hope that it will \r\ncontinue to decline. The improvement was achieved \r\ndespite lack of support from the international \r\ncommunity, and at a time when even such issues as \r\nHIV/AIDS were politicized and mixed with agendas of \r\nregime change. \r\n My Government greatly appreciates the \r\nassistance it is now receiving from the Global Fund \r\nand other agencies. We remain concerned about the \r\nincidence of HIV/AIDS in our country and hope that it \r\nwill continue to decline significantly as the \r\nGovernment strengthens prevention efforts. \r\nA/65/PV.5  \r\n \r\n10-54298 14 \r\n \r\n We are worried about the limited progress we \r\nhave made in the area of environmental sustainability. \r\nThe impact of climate change, as evidenced by \r\nrecurrent droughts, flooding, unreliable and \r\nunpredictable rainfall seasons, has wreaked havoc on \r\nthe lives of our people, most of whom depend on \r\nagriculture for a living. \r\n In addition, efforts by Government to provide \r\nclean water, decent sanitation and shelter for both \r\nurban and rural dwellers, have suffered as a result of \r\nthe illegal sanctions imposed on Zimbabwe by some \r\nWestern countries. We applaud those in the \r\ninternational community who have responded to our \r\nappeal for assistance to address urgent challenges in \r\nthis area. \r\n Zimbabwe remains convinced that the MDG \r\ntargets are achievable. What is needed is political \r\ncommitment, particularly on the part of developed \r\ncountries. There is a need to ensure that commitments \r\nalready made are not weakened, even in the light of \r\nnew demands. Aid delivery and coordination \r\nmechanisms must not be hampered by political biases \r\nand preferences. \r\n Let us keep the promise we made 10 years ago. \r\nLet us all strive to make 2015 a watershed year, a year \r\nwhen poverty, hunger, disease and other ills which are \r\nimpediments to a better quality of life can be \r\ncompletely prevented. Let us henceforth forge a wide-\r\nranging global partnership to make the world a better \r\nplace for all its peoples, now and in the future. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): \r\nThe Assembly will now hear an address by His \r\nExcellency Mr. Danny Foure, Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of Seychelles. \r\n Mr. Foure (Seychelles): As 2015 approaches, we \r\ncannot afford to be complacent in our efforts to fulfil \r\nthe promise of the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs). While we assess the success of our efforts so \r\nfar, I would like to invite a discussion on the concept \r\nof development itself. It is our understanding of this \r\nconcept which will also define how successful we are \r\nin actually improving the lives of our citizens. \r\n Development implies progress. It implies \r\nimprovement in all spheres of life. Recent events \r\naround the world have shown that there is no perfect \r\nmodel that can guarantee development. There is no \r\n“one-size-fits-all” solution to the challenges of \r\nensuring progress. \r\n In fact, we are at a point in history where we \r\nmust ask the question: what conditions can truly make \r\nany one country sustainable? Part of the answer lies in \r\nthe fact that no country will truly be sustainable unless \r\nwe can also ensure that our planet is sustainable. The \r\nMillennium Development Goals play a critical role in \r\nsetting us on the path towards sustainability as \r\ncountries. This will still prove fruitless unless we can \r\nalso ensure the conditions for sustainability at the \r\nglobal level. \r\n We commend the formation of the High-level \r\nPanel on Global Sustainability, co-chaired by President \r\nTarja Halonen of Finland and President Jacob Zuma of \r\nSouth Africa. \r\n While we take stock of our individual \r\nachievements, we must also address the systemic issues \r\nthat will allow countries to not only reach the targets \r\nset but also improve on them. \r\n I will take a moment to use Seychelles as an \r\nexample of what a State can achieve through \r\ncommitment to people-centred development. However, \r\nour achievements are also situated within the question \r\nof what has to be done to ensure that our progress is \r\nsustained. \r\n Seychelles is well on the way towards achieving \r\nthe targets laid out in the MDGs. But Seychelles today \r\nfaces a development paradox. As from the early 1990s, \r\nour rapid progress, coupled with our small population \r\nof 85,000, has meant that we have exceeded the gross \r\ndomestic product (GDP) per capita criteria required to \r\nbenefit from development assistance and affordable \r\ncredit. \r\n To sustain our development, Seychelles borrowed \r\nheavily at commercial rates, which led to a debt crisis \r\nthat culminated in 2008, when we approached the \r\nInternational Monetary Fund for assistance. With the \r\nhelp of our partners, we have survived the crisis and \r\nbrought our indebtedness down to a sustainable level. \r\nIt is important to note that a large number of small \r\nisland developing States currently have debt-to-GDP \r\nratios well in excess of 100 per cent. As stated by the \r\nPresident of the World Bank in this forum, 70 per cent \r\nof the world’s poor live in middle-income countries. \r\n We are faced with the question of how to finance \r\nthe next phase of our development. Small island States \r\n A/65/PV.5\r\n \r\n15 10-54298 \r\n \r\nare too developed to benefit from the concessions \r\noffered to least developed countries and are not \r\ndeveloped enough to benefit from the advantages of \r\nfirst-world status. In this middle-income trap, there is \r\nunfortunately a sense that there is no way up. The \r\nstatus quo becomes the best-case scenario, and \r\nregression is a real possibility. \r\n We are determined to succeed despite these \r\nconstraints. I am pleased to inform this summit that \r\nSeychelles will be engaging with the United Nations \r\nsystem in order to enter into commitments on MDG-\r\nPlus targets. We are making these commitments for the \r\nbenefit of our citizens, but also to reset the challenge of \r\ndevelopment.  \r\n To make development sustainable, small island \r\ndeveloping States need access to a wide range of \r\ndevelopment mechanisms. Most small island States are \r\nconsidered to be middle-income countries, but it is \r\nstartling to note that their vulnerabilities correspond \r\nmore closely to those of least developed countries. \r\n In an increasingly interconnected world, the \r\nmarginalization of small island developing States is on \r\nthe rise, and we need the global development \r\narchitecture to recognize this. We need to have formal \r\nrecognition of small island developing States as a \r\ndevelopment category by the United Nations system \r\nand the Bretton Woods institutions. \r\n We are making the commitment to MDG-Plus \r\nwith a focus on the sectors that we consider to be \r\nvulnerable. We need to continue to ensure that our \r\npopulation has access to quality education and health \r\ncare. Progress depends on an educated and healthy \r\npopulation. Despite our achievements in the health \r\nsector, we are concerned that we do not have the \r\nnecessary resources to properly tackle HIV/AIDS. Our \r\ndata at the national level on vulnerable groups are still \r\nunsatisfactory. We remain ineligible to access the \r\nGlobal Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, \r\nas do other island States facing similar constraints. \r\n We have a duty to ensure that we can make \r\nsustainable development a reality for the next \r\ngeneration. This is the true challenge of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. For the way forward, \r\nallow me to note a few considerations that we should \r\nactively discuss and put forward as critical factors for \r\nthe future of development. \r\n First, I congratulate the Secretary-General on his \r\nleadership to find new and innovative financing \r\nmechanisms. In these times of austerity, we have heard \r\ntoo much about the difficulty or reluctance of \r\ncountries, corporations and individuals to meet \r\ncommitments on financing for development. The \r\nsustainability of our planet depends on our being able \r\nto bridge this gap. \r\n Sustainability also depends on our ability to \r\nmobilize green financing to make environmentally \r\nfriendly technology available to those for whom the \r\nlatest technology remains financially prohibitive. Small \r\nislands, for example, have great access to renewable \r\nsources of energy but have no means of tapping into \r\nthe technology that is necessary to harness these \r\nresources. \r\n Climate change is of grave concern to all island \r\nStates. As much of the funding allocated to climate \r\nchange adaptation is directed through traditional \r\nofficial development assistance channels, many \r\nmiddle-income small island developing States are \r\nagain excluded. We need to ensure that financing to \r\nadapt to climate change is properly channelled and is \r\nno longer dependent on the existing inadequate \r\narrangements. \r\n Secondly, allow me to mention the important role \r\nthat needs to be played by regional groupings in \r\ncollaboration with the international community, led by \r\nthe United Nations system. Regional groupings can \r\nplay a strong development role by mobilizing funding \r\nand creating integration parameters that recognize \r\ncultural and geographical specificities. \r\n In Africa, we have also seen the positive role that \r\nregional organizations can play in enhancing peace and \r\nsecurity — critical conditions for development. In the \r\nAfrican region, the worsening instability in Somalia \r\nreminds us that, in certain situations, we cannot even \r\nbegin to set development targets without first \r\nestablishing peace and security. In the meantime, the \r\nshadow of terrorism and the threat of piracy continue \r\nto place a strain on the ability of neighbouring States to \r\npursue development. The scale of the problem calls for \r\nall organizations to commit more time and resources to \r\nthis problem. \r\n Finally, I think it is important that we view \r\ndevelopment through a lens that is devoid of ideology \r\nand assumptions. Ideas do not need to be owned by \r\nanybody for them to be successful. Development is \r\nA/65/PV.5  \r\n \r\n10-54298 16 \r\n \r\nabout people. Let us ensure that people are at the \r\ncentre of everything we do. We are all united by the \r\nMillennium Development Goals because we share the \r\ndesire to improve the lives of our peoples. \r\n Despite the challenges, we remain optimistic. The \r\nworld financial crisis has not dampened our resolve — \r\nrather, it has made us more determined to truly create \r\nthe conditions for a sustainable world. We say today \r\nonce again that we will achieve our goals, not only as \r\nindividual countries, but as citizens of the world. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): I \r\nnow give the floor to Mr. Makhdoom Shah Mehmood \r\nQureshi, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Pakistan. \r\n Mr. Qureshi (Pakistan): The Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) symbolize our collective \r\nresolve to create a better world that ensures a better \r\nquality of life for our peoples. We are therefore happy \r\nto see the MDGs at the forefront of the global \r\ndevelopment agenda and policy debate. With only five \r\nyears to go to achieve what we pledged at the \r\nMillennium Summit, this important High-level Plenary \r\nMeeting provides us with a good and timely \r\nopportunity to take stock of where we stand in \r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals and to \r\nexplore ways and means to accelerate progress towards \r\ntheir achievement. \r\n Pakistan has produced three Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals reports. A fourth report was \r\npublished last month. The latest MDG report for 2010 \r\npresents a frank and forthright account of where we \r\nstand in realizing the MDGs. The short- to medium-\r\nterm prospects for achieving the Goals are less than \r\npromising. Until a few years ago, we were on track to \r\nachieve a number of MDGs and targets. However, the \r\nnegative fallout from the security challenges posed by \r\nthe ongoing fight against terrorism has severely \r\naffected the economy. The unprecedented floods that \r\nhit my country in late July, causing massive losses to \r\ncrops, dwellings, livestock, services, and industrial and \r\ncommunications infrastructure have changed almost \r\neverything. Rehabilitation and reconstruction in the \r\naffected areas will need billions of dollars and will \r\naffect our economic recovery and achievement of the \r\nMDGs. \r\n Notwithstanding the economic difficulties, the \r\nMDGs remain a centrepiece of our democratic \r\nGovernment’s development efforts. They are an \r\nintegral part of our medium-term development \r\nframework. Our strategy rests on the following seven \r\npillars. \r\n First, we need good economic management based \r\non a pro-poor growth strategy relying on better fiscal \r\nand monetary discipline. Second, we must improve \r\ngovernance by consolidating democracy and ensuring \r\nthe people’s participation in decision-making at all \r\nlevels as a means both of delivering better \r\ndevelopment results and of ensuring social and \r\neconomic justice. Third, we must achieve high and \r\nbroad-based economic growth, focusing particularly on \r\nthe rural economy, while maintaining macroeconomic \r\nstability. In our view, agriculture holds the key to all \r\nefforts aimed at poverty alleviation. \r\n Fourth, we must invest in and building human \r\ncapital to ensure effective delivery of basic social \r\nservices. Fifth, we must bring the poor and vulnerable \r\ninto the mainstream of development by augmenting \r\ntargeted interventions and expanding social safety nets. \r\nSixth, we must focus on the empowerment of women \r\nand minorities and improve access to quality health \r\ncare and education. Seventh, we must pursue peace and \r\nforge close bilateral and regional economic \r\npartnerships with a view to sharing and leveraging our \r\ngeographic location at the crossroads of three vital \r\nregions: South, Central and West Asia. \r\n The initiatives aimed at achieving these \r\nobjectives include the following. Under the Benazir \r\nIncome Support Programme, female-headed poor \r\nhouseholds are eligible for small cash transfers to meet \r\nbasic needs. More than 3 million households are \r\nbenefiting from this scheme. A new employment \r\ncommission has been established for the creation of \r\nnew jobs in the public and private sectors. A new \r\neducation policy and reforms programme is geared to \r\nskill development aimed at the active and productive \r\nparticipation of youth in the development process. The \r\nempowerment of women has been identified by the \r\nGovernment as one of its top priorities. Considerable \r\nprogress has been made in reducing maternal mortality \r\nand controlling diseases. However, we still have a long \r\nway to go. Ensuring environmental sustainability is a \r\nhigh priority, but we will require greater support from \r\nthe international community to meet this challenge. \r\n We are committed to the attainment of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals and keen to work with \r\nthe international community to turn the challenges into \r\nopportunities. We are conscious of our responsibility \r\n A/65/PV.5\r\n \r\n17 10-54298 \r\n \r\nand are determined to create a more prosperous, \r\npeaceful and harmonious world for our future \r\ngenerations. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): I \r\nnow give the floor to Mr. Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Cuba. \r\n Mr. Rodríguez Parrilla (Cuba) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): In Cuba, the goals identified in the \r\nMillennium Declaration (resolution 55/2) have been \r\nalmost totally achieved, and in some cases \r\nconsiderably exceeded. Our commitment goes beyond \r\nour national borders and has enabled us to contribute to \r\nthe social development of other third-world nations. \r\nThis is the direct result of a revolution whose top \r\npriority is the well-being of its people in a climate of \r\nequity and social justice. It is the fruit of the society we \r\nare building, based on solidarity. It is also a success \r\nachieved despite the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial blockade imposed on the Cuban people by the \r\nUnited States Government for more than half a century. \r\n We are encouraged and pleased by the high \r\nsuccess rates attained by the Bolivarian revolution in \r\nVenezuela, thanks to profound social policies \r\ndeveloped by President Chávez and despite attempts to \r\ndestabilize that sister nation, which continues to fight \r\nand move on. Similarly, we feel great satisfaction at \r\nthe significant results shown by Bolivia, Nicaragua and \r\nEcuador, thanks to the commitment and actions of their \r\nGovernments. The States members of the Caribbean \r\nCommunity have also made progress; the level of \r\nsolidarity-based cooperation and integration among the \r\ncountries of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of \r\nOur America has been a positive factor in this regard. \r\nThe Government of President Lula in Brazil has also \r\nbeen able to achieve tangible and praiseworthy results \r\nin the social field. \r\n However, that progress has not been dependent \r\non international assistance from developed countries, \r\nwhich is almost non-existent, or on any positive change \r\nin the global economic order, which continues to be an \r\nextremely unjust, exploitive system that benefits rich \r\ncountries. \r\n The facts speak for themselves. Unfair trade \r\ncontinues; official development assistance (ODA) has \r\ncontracted in real terms; technology transfer remains \r\nvery limited and highly conditional; access for the \r\nexports of developing countries to the markets of the \r\nadvanced economies remains restricted; foreign debt is \r\nbeing repaid, but continues to grow; and financial \r\nderegulation and corruption in developed countries \r\nhave caused a global crisis with especially negative \r\nconsequences for developing economies. \r\n Consequently, and shamefully, the number of \r\npersons living in extreme poverty increased by some \r\n36 million between 1990 and 2005. The number of \r\npeople suffering from hunger throughout the world \r\nincreased from 842 million in the period 1990-1992 to \r\na record 1.02 billion in the year 2009, while 2 billion \r\npersons suffer from nutritional deficiency. In \r\nsub-Saharan Africa and some regions of Asia, poverty \r\nand hunger are at such high levels that it is very \r\ndifficult to reduce them. \r\n We must therefore ask ourselves: What kind of \r\ninternational cooperation are we talking about when we \r\nare not even remotely able to meet the commitment of \r\ndedicating 0.7 per cent of the gross national income of \r\ndeveloped countries to ODA, while those same \r\ncountries are mainly responsible for a global military \r\nbudget that amounts to the horrifying figure of \r\n$1.4 trillion, or 2.4 per cent of the world’s gross \r\ndomestic product? What kind of development goals are \r\nwe discussing when, due to the absence of political \r\nwill on the part of developed countries, it is not even \r\npossible to reach substantial commitments to reduce \r\ngreenhouse gas emissions that jeopardize the climactic \r\nbalance of our planet and represent the most significant \r\nthreat to the very survival of our species? \r\n Can we ignore the worsening of the food and \r\nwater crisis in the face of an international demographic \r\nboom? \r\n How can we speak of development and wonder if \r\nthe modest goals of the year 2000 have been met \r\nwithout remembering that, during the Millennium \r\nSummit, we also made a commitment to peace? What \r\nkind of hope can we have to meet the MDGS by the \r\nyear 2015 when, as Fidel Castro has warned, there is \r\nan increasing possibility of a military aggression \r\nagainst Iran that would cause millions of deaths, affect \r\nthe lives of billions of people and increase global \r\nhunger and poverty? \r\n What has happened to the commitment to total \r\nnuclear disarmament, other than the scam of reducing \r\nit to nothing more than non-proliferation? What is the \r\nrationale behind the storage and ongoing development \r\nof 25,000 nuclear warheads whose power could \r\nmagnify the destruction caused in Hiroshima and \r\nA/65/PV.5  \r\n \r\n10-54298 18 \r\n \r\nNagasaki by a factor of 440,000? What would be the \r\nconsequences of a nuclear conflict, whether local or \r\nregional, for life on the planet? \r\n The lack of solutions to the most serious \r\ndevelopment problems and the suffering of billions of \r\npeople living in poverty and underdevelopment will \r\nalso affect industrialized societies — as it is already \r\ndoing — where unemployment and brutal migration \r\npolicies are on the rise. This problem will come \r\nknocking at all of our doors, be it through uncontrolled \r\nand unmanageable migration flows, by means of \r\ndiseases and epidemics arising from conflicts \r\ngenerated by poverty and hunger, or as a result of \r\nevents that are today unforeseeable. \r\n The United Nations will betray its very essence if \r\nit does not recognize this reality and act now. We \r\nstrongly believe that, in order to ensure the survival of \r\nour species, a new international economic and political \r\norder will have to be built on the basis of the principles \r\nof solidarity, social justice, equity and respect for the \r\nrights of peoples and every individual. If we work \r\ntogether, that is still possible. To achieve it, Cuba will \r\ndo the impossible.  \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): I \r\nnow give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Sergey \r\nLavrov, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Russian \r\nFederation. \r\n Mr. Lavrov (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): Russia is committed to international \r\ndevelopment cooperation and ready to intensify \r\nconstructive interaction with a wide range of partners, \r\nincluding private sector and civil society, to ensure the \r\ntimely achievement of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs). We believe that the sustainable social \r\nand economic development of all countries of the \r\nworld is a crucial element of any modern collective \r\nsecurity system. \r\n The United Nations is a unique mechanism for \r\nthe harmonization of interests of various countries and \r\nthe main international forum for adopting coordinated \r\ndecisions on development issues. Regional organizations \r\nand informal international groupings are concerned, \r\nincluding the Group of Eight and the Group of 20, are \r\nalso called upon to pursue their efforts in this area in \r\naccordance with the standards of economic and \r\nhumanitarian cooperation within the framework of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil. \r\n Over the past five years, the international \r\ncommunity has achieved certain positive results. \r\nNevertheless, recently published reports on the MDGs \r\nhave shown uneven progress in the implementation of \r\nindividual Goals as well as regional discrepancies. \r\nUnfortunately, a significant delay has been noted with \r\nrespect to the Goals and targets related to universal \r\nprimary education, the reduction in child and maternal \r\nmortality, and the reduction of greenhouse gas \r\nemissions. The challenges are being felt most acutely \r\nin Africa. \r\n Clearly, the primary responsibility for achieving \r\nthe MDGs rests with national Governments, yet it is \r\nobvious that radical improvement in the social and \r\neconomic situation of the most vulnerable developing \r\ncountries will be possible only with the coordinated \r\nsupport of the entire international community. \r\n To that end, Russia has consistently increased its \r\ncontribution to development cooperation. In 2008, \r\nRussian aid to developing countries totalled \r\n$220 million and, in 2009, about $800 million. That \r\ndoes not take into account the cancellation of billions \r\nof dollars in debt. \r\n Naturally, we attach particular importance to \r\nassisting the Commonwealth of Independent States \r\n(CIS) region. During the global crisis, Russia issued \r\npreferential loans and grants exceeding $4.6 billion to \r\nCIS countries in need. We initiated the creation of the \r\nAnti-Crisis Fund of the Eurasian Economic \r\nCommunity (EurAsEC) with an initial $10 billion, \r\n$7.5 billion of which was contributed by the Russian \r\nFederation. \r\n We call on all Member States to support the draft \r\nresolution on cooperation between the United Nations \r\nand EurAsEC to be submitted for consideration by the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. We intend \r\nto continue to pursue these efforts in support of the \r\ncountries of the CIS and developing countries in other \r\nregions, first and foremost in Africa. \r\n In our globalized and interdependent world, \r\nfailure to address the needs of low-income countries \r\nincreases the risks to the entire global economy, \r\nundermines stability and security in most regions of the \r\nworld, and increases the danger of the spread of \r\nterrorism, infectious diseases and uncontrolled \r\nmigration. \r\n A/65/PV.5\r\n \r\n19 10-54298 \r\n \r\n To counter these threats more effectively, Russia \r\nis ready, together with other countries, to more \r\nefficiently engage its scientific capacities and advanced \r\ntechnologies, in particular information and \r\ncommunication technologies, as a powerful tool to \r\nbridge the gap between the developed and developing \r\ncountries and thus promote global development. \r\n Recently, we have witnessed yet again the \r\ntremendous damage that can be inflicted on \r\ndevelopment by natural and man-made disasters. \r\nEarthquakes, floods, wildfires, tsunamis, industrial and \r\ninfrastructure breakdowns not only claim thousands of \r\nhuman lives, but consume enormous resources to repair \r\nthe damage, thus diverting resources from development \r\ngoals. Clearly, increased preparedness for such \r\ndisasters is costly, but it is considerably less expensive \r\nthan the cost of recovery and rehabilitation. \r\n That is why we believe it important to \r\nqualitatively improve the coordination of our joint \r\nactions to ensure a wider use of modern technologies to \r\nrespond to natural and man-made disasters and to \r\ndevelop mechanisms for the application of such \r\ntechnologies in the interest of the international \r\ncommunity. In fact, this might become a new, \r\npromising form of development cooperation. In that \r\nconnection, I recall the initiative launched by President \r\nDmitry Medvedev to establish an environmental risks \r\ninsurance fund. We invite all our partners to elaborate \r\non this initiative. \r\n In our interdependent world, the development \r\nagenda is closely interlinked with security issues. At \r\ntimes, in order to pursue the objectives enshrined in the \r\nUnited Nations Charter, the international community is \r\nforced to resort to such tools as economic sanctions. \r\nHowever, there has long been a consensus on the need \r\nto respect the so-called humanitarian limits of \r\nsanctions and to prevent their negative impact on the \r\ncivilian population and social and economic \r\ndevelopment. We note that the Security Council has \r\nsought in recent years to be strictly guided by precisely \r\nthis understanding. \r\n At the same time, we cannot help but express our \r\nserious concern with the persisting practice of \r\nunilateral coercive measures imposed in a voluntaristic \r\nor reckless manner by certain States against certain \r\ndeveloping States, in excess of the provisions of the \r\nUnited Nations Charter and the decisions of the \r\nSecurity Council. We are convinced that such practices \r\nrun counter to the efforts to achieve the MDGs and \r\nmust be brought to an end. \r\n It is in the interest of all countries without \r\nexception to eradicate poverty and overcome \r\nunderdevelopment. A poor person cannot be free. The \r\nability to provide decent social and economic living \r\nstandards is one of the key attributes of a democratic \r\nState. These issues were thoroughly discussed at the \r\nrecent Global Policy Forum on democracy standards \r\nheld recently in Yaroslavl. In his address to the Forum, \r\nPresident Dmitry Medvedev spoke in favour of \r\ndeveloping a universal understanding of such standards \r\nin order to help establish a positive, unifying agenda of \r\nmodern international relations.  \r\n We invite all stakeholders to work together, and \r\nhope that this summit will promote more active and \r\ncohesive efforts by Governments, international \r\nfinancial and trade institutions, the business \r\ncommunity and non-governmental organizations to \r\nensure that the MDGs are met on time. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): \r\nThe Assembly will now hear an address by His \r\nExcellency Mr. Arvin Boolell, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs, Regional Integration and International Trade of \r\nthe Republic of Mauritius.  \r\n Mr. Boolell (Mauritius): The timely realization of \r\nthe targets of the Millennium Development Goals is the \r\ncherished dream of all of us. Unfortunately, in the light \r\nof current trends, it is evident that we may not achieve \r\nthem by the set date if the pledges made and \r\ncommitments undertaken in this respect remain \r\nunfulfilled and unimplemented. It is also important to \r\nadd that, if donor aid is to flow to poverty-stricken \r\ncountries, it is imperative for the latter to provide a \r\nstable environment conducive to development \r\nsupported by transparent and accountable \r\nGovernments. The achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals requires a holistic approach with \r\nthe engagement of Governments, civil societies, non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, charitable institutions, \r\nfoundations and the private sector. \r\n As far as Mauritius is concerned, I can sound a \r\npositive note because the Millennium Development \r\nGoals status report that we have just completed \r\nconfirms that significant progress has been achieved on \r\nmost of the targets, in spite of the global economic \r\nmeltdown and the financial, fuel and food crises. These \r\naccomplishments have been made possible largely to \r\nA/65/PV.5  \r\n \r\n10-54298 20 \r\n \r\nthe sustained efforts and good policy mix undertaken \r\nby our Government since 2006, with the support and \r\nassistance of development partners. \r\n With a view to maintaining a welfare State since \r\nindependence in 1968, we have invested heavily in and \r\nplaced great emphasis on the social welfare, education \r\nand health sectors. Mauritius provides free primary and \r\nsecondary schooling, free health care, free bus \r\ntransport to students and elderly citizens, and a \r\nuniversal pension to the elderly. It spends 58 per cent \r\nof its national budget on community and social \r\nservices. \r\n The objective of primary schooling for all \r\nchildren in Mauritius has been achieved, as the net \r\nenrolment rate in primary education is 97 per cent. \r\nMauritian citizens have free medical and surgical \r\ntreatment. Antenatal and post-natal care is provided to \r\nall women free of charge, and 99 per cent of births are \r\nattended by skilled health personnel. \r\n Mauritius is also among the countries on the \r\nAfrican continent with the lowest infant and maternal \r\nmortality rates. The economic empowerment of women \r\nhas seen a further improvement between 2005 and \r\n2010 with non-collateral-based access to finance for \r\nentrepreneurship. Indeed, a larger number of women \r\nentrepreneurs are now in business with sustainable \r\nincome. There is also noticeable progress in placing \r\nwomen at higher levels of decision-making in the \r\npublic sector and the judiciary. The private sector has \r\nyet to follow suit in this respect. \r\n The elimination of extreme poverty has been a \r\ntop priority for the Government, particularly since \r\n2006, with the setting-up of an empowerment \r\nprogramme with the capacity to act without the \r\nrigidities of the normal state bureaucracy, and an \r\nintegrated approach to the rehabilitation of the social \r\ncapital of poor families. The various projects under the \r\nempowerment programme are producing concrete \r\nresults.  \r\n The Government has set up a special ministry, the \r\nMinistry of Social Integration, to cater to the needs of \r\nthe poor and vulnerable and to wage war on poverty. \r\nFurthermore, a number of programmes are currently \r\nbeing implemented under the aegis of the National \r\nEmpowerment Foundation to widen the circle of \r\nopportunities for the poor, assist the vulnerable groups \r\nand eradicate poverty. These programmes adopt a \r\npolicy of empowerment and rather than give handouts \r\nto the poor. \r\n As a small island developing State, Mauritius \r\nfaces several inherent constraints, such as its small \r\nsize, geographical isolation and limited resources. It is \r\nalso prone to the vagaries of natural disasters and the \r\nimpact of climate change. However, in spite of these \r\nconstraints, Mauritius has already attained major \r\ntargets in the area of environmental protection. The \r\ncountry has taken several initiatives, such as the \r\nMaurice Ile Durable project, aimed at improving the \r\nquality of the environment and paving the way towards \r\nsustainable development. Our Government is indeed \r\nconscious of the need to ensure economic and social \r\ndevelopment without compromising the quality of life \r\nof future generations. \r\n If we are able to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals by 2015, we may consider that we \r\nhave made a major breakthrough. However, it will not \r\nbe an end in itself. We would need to sustain it and, for \r\nthat matter, the most important goal would be \r\nsustainable development. In this context, the successful \r\nconclusion of the Doha Development Round at the \r\nearliest possible date and aid for trade financing for \r\ndevelopment are crucial. Since one size does not fit all, \r\nI need not recall the vulnerability of small island \r\ndeveloping States or that due consideration for special \r\nand differential treatment therefore has to be taken.  \r\n In June 2009, the Conference on the World \r\nFinancial and Economic Crisis and Its Impact on \r\nDevelopment established an ad hoc open-ended \r\nworking group of the General Assembly, which \r\ninstitutionalized the continuing role of the United \r\nNations in addressing the economic crisis. It is \r\nimportant for the Ad Hoc Open-ended Working Group \r\nto remain focused on issues of concern to developing \r\ncountries, such as remittances of migrant workers, \r\nlabour migration, international cooperation in \r\nrestricting sovereign debt, concession flows and grants, \r\nwhether through the operation of a global fund or \r\ndevelopment Special Drawing Rights, and the reform \r\nof Bretton Woods institutions. \r\n Finally, I should like to reaffirm that Mauritius \r\nremains committed to meeting the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals by 2015. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): I \r\nnow give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Jean-Marie \r\n A/65/PV.5\r\n \r\n21 10-54298 \r\n \r\nEhouzou, Special Envoy of the President of the \r\nRepublic of Benin. \r\n Mr. Ehouzou (Benin) (spoke in French): Our \r\ncivilization is going through a deep crisis. Indeed, at \r\nthe start of the third millennium, extreme poverty has \r\nreached a level more horrifying than at any other time \r\nin the history of humanity. The statistics on the \r\ndifferences and inequalities that characterize our planet \r\nare alarming. \r\n Today, there are over 1.8 billion human beings \r\nwho live in extreme insecurity and destitution, on less \r\nthan $1 a day. Forty years ago, 400 million people \r\nsuffered from permanent chronic malnutrition; today, \r\ntheir number is estimated to be 854 million. This \r\nsituation is unacceptable, especially in a world that has \r\nsufficient levels of production, resources and \r\nknowledge to put an end to such tragedies and their \r\nconsequences. \r\n Despite all the efforts made by most of the \r\npoorest States, those countries continue to face many \r\ndifficulties because of poorly adapted policies imposed \r\nhere and there by certain international institutions. \r\nThose difficulties are aggravated today by climate \r\nchange and the various international crises related to \r\nthe disorder of unbridled capitalism, including the food \r\ncrisis.  \r\n About two decades after the fall of the Berlin \r\nwall, a new wall has been built. It is an economic wall \r\nand symbolizes the gap between the developed North \r\nand the impoverished South, and everything indicates \r\nthat no one seems concerned about it. However, its \r\ncontinuation could sow the seeds of destructive conflict \r\nfor our entire system.  \r\n We can bring down that wall if we have the will \r\nto do so, because all of us here, many as we are, know \r\nthat the means exist to do so. To accomplish that, \r\npriorities must simply be redefined and meaning and \r\nconcrete substance given to the fairness and necessary \r\nsolidarity that should exist among peoples, especially \r\nin a time of crisis. \r\n An analysis of the report assessing the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) (A/64/665) \r\nshows that in many countries, significant progress has \r\nbeen made in many areas and that the necessary \r\nresources and expertise to achieve the Goals exist. In \r\nBenin, my country, several assessments of the extent to \r\nwhich the Millennium Goals have been achieved have \r\nshown that it will be difficult to reach most of the \r\nMDGs in the country by 2015 if the current trends \r\ncontinue. \r\n However, the progress made in the areas of \r\neducation, health care and the empowerment of women \r\nthrough microfinancing stems from the quality of the \r\nprogrammes established in many sectors and the \r\nconsiderable support of technical and financial partners \r\nbut above all from the great involvement of grass-roots \r\ncommunities that only ask to be supported. \r\n In that regard, I wish to underscore that the \r\nSecretary-General acknowledged the importance and \r\neffectiveness of a Songhai project being tested in my \r\ncountry, Benin, after having seen it himself. The \r\nproject emphasizes the development of agricultural \r\nentrepreneurship. The Secretary-General strongly \r\nrecommended disseminating and repeating that \r\nexperiment both in Benin and in other countries \r\nbecause of its great potential for food security and \r\nrational management of the environment. \r\n  Mr. Osman (Sudan), Vice-President of the General \r\nAssembly, took the Chair. \r\n \r\n However, in the current international economic \r\ncrisis, the major challenge continues to be the \r\nmobilization of resources to accelerate progress \r\ntowards achieving the MDGs by 2015. Like many \r\nother countries, in concrete terms, Benin can achieve \r\nall the Goals that it endorsed in 2000 only by \r\nmobilizing three times the public resources currently \r\nallotted to the education and rural development sectors. \r\n Words and declarations have no meaning if they \r\nare not followed up with robust action. Our many \r\nconferences often conclude in declarations that echo \r\nour good intentions and promises. Benin expresses the \r\nkeen desire to see them translated into concrete action. \r\nThat will help to enhance multilateralism. \r\n Benin also desires the poor countries to make \r\ngreater effort in terms of governance, improving public \r\npolicies, strengthening ownership and making better \r\nuse of the resources made available to them. That is the \r\nonly way that we will be able to achieve the Goals we \r\nset by 2015. \r\n With respect to institutions for financing for \r\ndevelopment, primarily those of the so-called Bretton \r\nWoods era, they must at last realize that the criteria of \r\nconvergence, conditionality and other remedies that \r\nthey administer to fragile countries only aggravate the \r\nA/65/PV.5  \r\n \r\n10-54298 22 \r\n \r\nplight of the most vulnerable populations of those \r\ncountries. \r\n Poverty is not inevitable. Therefore it is up to us \r\nto strive together to stop it becoming a weapon of mass \r\ndestruction for humanity. It is in all our interests, and I \r\nam firmly convinced that, with a little more political \r\nwill, we can achieve that. \r\n The Acting Chair (spoke in Arabic): I now give \r\nthe floor to His Excellency Mr. John Silk, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of the Marshall Islands. \r\n Mr. Silk (Marshall Islands): When the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) came to life \r\nthrough the Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2), \r\nthe Government of the Republic of the Marshall \r\nIslands and the international community made a lasting \r\npromise to the Marshallese people to take all necessary \r\naction to reach basic social development goals. \r\n While we can report some positive progress, \r\nmuch remains to be done both by the Marshall Islands \r\nGovernment and by our international partners. We can \r\nexpect the international community to boost its \r\nresponsiveness only if we are willing to undertake \r\nimproved efforts at home. I am pleased to announce \r\nthat the Marshall Islands Cabinet has endorsed efforts \r\ntowards a new national development plan that directly \r\nembeds progress on the MDGs in national strategies. \r\n I can point to positive progress towards reaching \r\ntwo key MDG targets in the Marshall Islands: we have \r\nimproved access to basic education for all and we have \r\nsteadily improved maternal health and child welfare. \r\nHowever, these bright beacons are clouded by serious \r\nbarriers to reaching other MDG targets. While we have \r\navoided dire poverty, indicators suggest that general \r\nhardship and hunger are worsening, not improving. We \r\nare not on track to providing decent work and full \r\nemployment. While we have made some advances on \r\ngender issues, violence against girls and women \r\nremains a serious problem. Serious improvements need \r\nto be made towards addressing HIV, malaria and other \r\nillnesses. \r\n We are restrained by political inaction on the \r\nMauritius Strategy — the focus of global, island-\r\nspecific efforts. Our private sector is woefully \r\nunderdeveloped, and we remain reliant on foreign \r\nassistance. As a low-lying nation, we must build \r\nimmediate and far greater intersections between our \r\nsocial development efforts and strategies to address \r\nclimate change. \r\n Rather than witness the global community tear \r\nitself apart fighting over the amount of financing — \r\nand more resources are needed — we first need to \r\nfocus our efforts on seriously boosting the \r\neffectiveness of the rich opportunities already afforded \r\nus. Honest, real and outcome-oriented discussions are \r\nneeded among donors and recipients on creative and \r\nimmediate strategies for aid effectiveness and \r\ncoordination. From the perspective of a small island \r\nnation, the myriad of unconnected aid opportunities are \r\nat best a confusing patchwork attempt, leaving a tragic \r\ngap between the intentions of donors and delivery to \r\nlocal communities. \r\n A very obvious suggestion would be to build \r\nbetter bridges among the Mauritius Strategy, the island-\r\nfocused development strategy and the MDGs. In so \r\ndoing, the international community could consider \r\nmoving towards defining a formal category of \r\nvulnerable island nations, as well as developing precise \r\ngoals and benchmarks within the Mauritius Strategy to \r\nmeasure international progress. \r\n The Marshall Islands is a large ocean State. Our \r\ntuna fisheries resources represent the primary pathway \r\nto economic development, but the key stocks have been \r\npushed beyond sustainable levels. We will be able to \r\nadvance towards key MDGs and to transform our \r\neconomy only if our political partners implement \r\ncommitments towards both curbing unsustainable \r\nfishing levels and helping us to achieve our own \r\nfisheries development aspirations. Right now, we \r\nrealize very limited benefits. Only about one penny \r\nfrom a can of Pacific tuna comes to us. Here, I can \r\noffer another simple suggestion: regional and global \r\nfisheries discussions need to be far better integrated \r\nwithin broader development processes, and specific \r\ndevelopment strategies need to be identified. \r\n Finally, we must improve our own domestic \r\ncommitment. The MDGs can not be a “set it and forget \r\nit” exercise. And today I can announce our need for \r\nassistance in assembling an MDG acceleration team as \r\na component of our national planning efforts to assist \r\nin further Government ownership and integration of the \r\nMDGs. This small team will not only assist with \r\nplanning, but will also work across agencies to pursue \r\nimmediate, practical action. For example, several \r\nGovernment offices have already integrated MDG \r\n A/65/PV.5\r\n \r\n23 10-54298 \r\n \r\ntargets into agency planning and performance \r\nbudgeting. This welcome effort should be scaled up. \r\nWe need to sit with our partners and examine how our \r\nexisting assistance and development pathways can best \r\naddress the MDGs and identify means for measurable \r\nprogress. \r\n The impact of climate change threatens to unravel \r\nwhatever progress we have made and will make \r\ntowards the MDGs. Our Government has recently \r\nendorsed a climate change road map, with concrete \r\nstrategies to cut our own emissions and achieve a \r\nclimate-resilient future. With international assistance, \r\nwe must work in lockstep on efforts to address both our \r\ncore social development under the MDGs and also \r\nclimate adaptation. \r\n Today I can announce our Government’s renewed \r\nattention and commitment towards a global effort in \r\nachieving the MDGs. I can only hope that the rest of \r\nthe international community, and in particular our \r\nclosest partners, will join us in turning words into \r\nreality.  \r\n The Acting Chair (spoke in Arabic): I now give \r\nthe floor to His Excellency Mr. Pastor Micha Ondo \r\nBile, Minister for Foreign Affairs and International \r\nCooperation and Francophonie of the Republic of \r\nEquatorial Guinea.  \r\n Mr. Micha Ondo Bile (Equatorial Guinea) \r\n(spoke in Spanish): It is a great honour for me to \r\naddress this High-level Meeting, representing His \r\nExcellency Mr. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea, who, \r\ndue to many important and high-level State \r\nresponsibilities, is unable to personally attend this \r\nimportant event. On his behalf, I extend our most \r\nsincere congratulations to the Co-Chairs and to the \r\nother members of the Bureau.  \r\n Our presence at this meeting reaffirms Equatorial \r\nGuinea’s commitment to multilateralism as a whole \r\nand to the principles and purposes of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations. In that context, and on behalf of the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea and his \r\nGovernment, I convey my warmest and most sincere \r\ncongratulations to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and \r\nagain commend his hard work and leadership in the \r\nservice of humanity, and in particular his efforts to \r\npromote sustainable development in the broadest sense. \r\n This High-level Meeting devoted specifically to \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) is an \r\nexcellent opportunity for all of us to lend new \r\nmomentum to the attainment of those Goals. Moreover, \r\nwe believe that this High-level Meeting provides us \r\nwith an opportunity to chart the course to be followed \r\nand to draw up a realistic road map or programme of \r\naction with specific methodologies to accelerate \r\nprogress in order to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals by 2015. \r\n The report of the Secretary-General (A/64/665) \r\nonce more stresses that the goals and targets set out in \r\nthe Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2) have not \r\nyet been achieved to the extent we all would desire and \r\nthat most countries, in particular the developing \r\ncountries and the least developed countries, remain \r\nmarginalized in the world economy and are impacted \r\nby extreme poverty. \r\n Progress towards achievement of the Millennium \r\nGoals has always been eroded by a series of negative \r\nfactors that include a reduction in flows of official \r\ndevelopment assistance, serious structural obstacles, \r\nthe declining price of commodities and, in some \r\ncountries, violent conflicts and post-conflict situations, \r\nnatural disasters — and the list goes on. In addition, \r\nthe world recession has further obstructed the path to \r\n2015. Indeed, the events that have taken place and the \r\ndelays that we have encountered since the Millennium \r\nDeclaration was adopted in 2000 mean that we must \r\nachieve consensus among all countries regarding the \r\nchallenges and fundamental priorities for action, and \r\nthat consensus must then be turned into collective \r\naction.  \r\n The Republic of Equatorial Guinea understands \r\nthat in the context of implementing the Millennium \r\nDeclaration, a series of decisions must be taken that \r\ncommit and encourage all States to meet the \r\ncommitments collectively entered into in the year \r\n2000, when for the first time consideration was given \r\nto achieving the Millennium Goals. It is thus a question \r\nof standard-setting, of measures and reforms that \r\nshould guide all States, provided the necessary political \r\nwill can be mobilized on the part of all countries \r\nmaking up the international community. All partners \r\ninvolved must also be fully committed to the fight for \r\nthe cause of development.  \r\n For the Republic of Equatorial Guinea, the \r\nMillennium Development Goals are a serious \r\nA/65/PV.5  \r\n \r\n10-54298 24 \r\n \r\ncommitment to sustainable development. For this \r\nreason, the Government of my country has taken a \r\nseries of economic, legislative, legal and administrative \r\nmeasures to give effect to the Millennium Declaration. \r\n Over the last 10 years, the economic performance \r\nof Equatorial Guinea has been particularly exceptional, \r\nthanks to the discovery and processing of major oil \r\nreserves. This situation implies our economy’s \r\ndependence on oil and thus its fragility.  \r\n According to estimates in a study of poverty in \r\nour country, some two thirds of the population continue \r\nto suffer penury. To mitigate the impact of poverty and \r\nrespond to the Millennium Declaration, the \r\nGovernment the Republic of Equatorial Guinea \r\nembarked on a long-term process of development \r\nstrategy planning, which has led to the holding of two \r\nnational economic conferences. The second of these \r\nconferences was held in November 2007, in the context \r\nof which our Government established strategic \r\nguidelines and priorities that constitute and underpin \r\nthe Plan for Social and Economic Development and \r\nPoverty Reduction in Equatorial Guinea by the Year \r\n2020. \r\n The view of sustainable development adopted by \r\nour Government is centred on 2020, which implies the \r\nachievement of the Millennium Goals through \r\nincreased efforts on our part, the broadening of revenue \r\nsources and the training of human resources in order to \r\nachieve appropriate growth levels for a competitive \r\neconomy that is able to eradicate poverty and hunger. \r\nThat is as set forth in the current plan of action for the \r\ndevelopment of Equatorial Guinea by 2020, drafted by \r\nour Government, as mentioned, in 2007. \r\n Instruments such as the Fund for Social \r\nDevelopment, adopted by the Government of \r\nEquatorial Guinea in 2006 with the diligent assistance \r\nof the United States Agency for International \r\nDevelopment (USAID), are important strategic inputs \r\ndesigned to help our country to achieve the Millennium \r\nGoals. The Fund is intended to improve social services \r\nprovided by the Government for the benefit of the \r\npopulation to facilitate their access to basic public \r\nservices of appropriate quality and which guarantee \r\nsustainable human development and a well-protected \r\nenvironment. \r\n The principal objective of the Fund is to develop \r\nthe capacities of ministries and institutions in the social \r\nsector and to train Equatorial Guinea’s human \r\nresources in the methods and procedures as well as in \r\nthe drafting, management, implementation, follow-up \r\nand evaluation of social programmes and projects. \r\n Financing for this Fund comes from the \r\nGovernment’s own resources, and $15 million have \r\nbeen made available by USAID for technical \r\nassistance. The Government has undertaken to allocate \r\na further sum of $72 million for the first five-year \r\nphase of execution of concrete projects, which \r\nrepresents 0.8 per cent of the gross domestic product, \r\naccording to International Monetary Fund statistics. \r\n My Government has donated substantial sums to \r\ncontribute to the development of actions designed to \r\npromote sustainable human development. To name just \r\na few, there is the $3 million contribution to UNESCO \r\nto underwrite the Prize for Research in the Life \r\nSciences, and to the African Union a contribution for \r\nsetting up the African Observatory for Science, \r\nTechnology and Innovation. To those we would add \r\nother financial contributions made in recent years to \r\nboth the Secretary-General and United Nations \r\nagencies and entities to bolster their endeavours around \r\nthe world. \r\n Those measures bear witness to my country’s \r\nfirm commitment to achieving the Millennium Goals \r\nand in particular to fully complying with the objectives \r\nestablished in the most recent international conferences \r\nin the social, economic and related fields. The \r\nexamination by those conferences of the integrated and \r\ncoordinated implementation of the results is the \r\nprincipal object of this High-level Meeting taking place \r\nwithin the framework of the sixty-fifth session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n The cause of development and above all the fight \r\nagainst the poverty and hunger that assault in the world \r\ntoday can be promoted only through broad, deep and \r\nsustained international cooperation among all States, \r\nwith the firm commitment and support of the organs \r\nand agencies of the United Nations, and including the \r\nprivate sector and civil society.  \r\n In our view, the objectives set out in the \r\nMillennium Declaration can be achieved by 2015. \r\nHowever, that requires that, starting now, we break \r\nfrom the routine, that we dramatically accelerate and \r\nintensify our actions and our commitment. To achieve \r\nthe Millennium Goals, it is absolutely essential that we \r\nhave greater solidarity within the diversity that exists \r\n A/65/PV.5\r\n \r\n25 10-54298 \r\n \r\nbetween all States, whatever their size, and institutions \r\nthat comprise the international community.  \r\n The Acting Chair (spoke in Arabic): I now give \r\nthe floor to His Excellency Mr. Sergei Martynov, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Belarus. \r\n Mr. Martynov (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): \r\nYesterday and this morning a great many opinions have \r\nbeen voiced from this rostrum, including those related \r\nto such important issues as who was at fault and what \r\nhas been the major impediment to progress for States \r\nof the world in achieving the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs).  \r\n Those who single out the financial and economic \r\ncrisis as the primary reason for feeble and fragmented \r\nprogress and limitation are quite right. One cannot but \r\nagree also with those who link those failures with the \r\nunwillingness of the great Powers to cooperate with \r\nother States on equal terms in order to overcome a \r\nwide array of new global threats and challenges. \r\n In these circumstances, a no less important \r\nquestion arises: what is to be done? From our \r\nviewpoint, the situation requires tighter multilateral \r\napproaches, including agreed measures to strengthen \r\nthe global partnership for development — Goal 8. \r\nOtherwise, the lack of tangible progress towards \r\nachieving the Goals will not be overcome.  \r\n I emphasize here that a comparatively new \r\ninstrument among the United Nations tools — a policy \r\nof global partnerships, actively advocated by the \r\nRepublic of Belarus — has been ever more clearly \r\nproving its effectiveness and advantages in addressing \r\nthe most acute international problems. The most \r\nconvincing and recent example is a global partnership \r\nagainst slavery and human trafficking, which was \r\ninitiated by Belarus five years ago and has been \r\nsuccessfully taking shape at the United Nations. It \r\nrecently found expression in resolution 64/293, a \r\nconsensus resolution of the General Assembly adopting \r\nthe United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat \r\nTrafficking in Persons. \r\n Another positive example is that the international \r\ncommunity, coordinated by the United Nations, \r\nmanaged not only to adopt the United Nations Global \r\nCounter-Terrorism Strategy (resolution 60/288 and \r\nannex) but also within that framework to take a number \r\nof balanced and result-oriented steps that have already \r\nproved effective. And for a number of years now we \r\nhave had every reason to commend the combined \r\nefforts of States within the framework of the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development. \r\n On the other hand, in cases where real partnership \r\nrelations have not been achieved we observe the \r\npursuit of short-term benefits and a disregard for the \r\ninterests of others. On that basis, as we know from \r\nexperience, in such situations it is impossible in \r\nprinciple to achieve decisive progress. That has been \r\nproved convincingly by the results - or rather by lack \r\nof the results — of the most recent United Nations \r\nClimate Change Conference in Copenhagen. \r\n For the same reason we still have a long way to \r\ngo to successfully conclude the Doha Round of \r\nmultilateral trade negotiations. Moreover, developed \r\ncountries are clearly hardening their positions and \r\nimposing protectionist measures in international trade. \r\nIn current crisis conditions, that most painfully affects \r\ndeveloping countries and middle-income countries with \r\nopen economies. Clearly, this is not partnership. \r\n The failure to establish genuine partnership \r\nrelations means that we are not yet in a position to \r\nprogress toward solving the problem of global energy \r\nsecurity, turning advanced energy technologies into an \r\nasset and a driving engine of progress for all States. \r\nBelarus has consistently advocated such an approach. \r\n Efforts to overcome the economic and financial \r\ncrisis have yielded mixed yet illustrative results. There \r\nhave been clear successes specifically in those fields \r\nwhere real partnership, flexibility and mutual \r\nunderstanding have been forged — for example, \r\nprogress in interaction with international financial \r\ninstitutions. At the same time, the international \r\ncommunity has yet to make progress on agreed \r\napproaches to stimulating national economies. The \r\nreason is the difference in attitudes of the key players \r\nto meeting the crucial goals in this post-crisis period. \r\n Global partnerships justify their value not only by \r\nvirtue of the depth and diversity of the problems to be \r\nresolved. Today their mechanisms are timely and \r\nefficient because they serve as a component of \r\neffective global governance, towards which the entire \r\nsystem of international relations is now moving. \r\n It is encouraging that by establishing global \r\npartnerships in deed, and not only in name, the United \r\nNations elevates its status and authority as an \r\norganization capable of playing the role of an \r\nA/65/PV.5  \r\n \r\n10-54298 26 \r\n \r\ninstitution for effective global governance. I stress that \r\ngood governance at such a level demands looking to \r\nthe future and pondering future challenges, even \r\nthough they have not historically figured prominently \r\nenough in international relations. Foreseeing and \r\nidentifying the problems in a timely way, before they \r\nbecome full-blown, and uniting partners for their \r\nsuccessful solution guarantees a reliable and \r\nprosperous future. \r\n Belarus would like to suggest a promising idea, \r\nthe foundation of which, we believe, should be laid \r\ndown today. This idea can be identified as “Help \r\nFuture Generations Prosper”. It is directly related to \r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals. The \r\nessence of our proposal is to establish a new global \r\npartnership for defending and promoting the interests \r\nof youth. \r\n Analysis of the implementation of the MDGs has \r\nled us to the unambiguous conclusion: it is more \r\nimportant than ever to activate efforts in the sectors \r\nthat directly or indirectly affect the prosperity of future \r\ngenerations. Their needs should be a priority in \r\nworking to achieve the MDGs and in general in the \r\nwork of the General Assembly and its Main \r\nCommittees. This is particularly relevant since youth is \r\nhaving an ever greater impact on society and is \r\nbecoming its most creative sector in all parts of the \r\nworld without exception. \r\n In our view, the United Nations could play a key \r\nrole in identifying specific mechanisms to support \r\ntalented young people and train young managers of a \r\nnew type. It is also necessary to assist in preventing the \r\nthreats that are common for young generations in many \r\ncountries, such as drugs, alcohol, violence and shirking \r\ncivic responsibilities. The role of the United Nations in \r\nthis aspect of our comprehensive idea would at first be \r\nat least to hold a General Assembly thematic debate to \r\ndiscuss global good practices in fighting the social \r\nalienation of the youth. \r\n Global partnership is an effective mechanism for \r\nmutual understanding, ensuring results. Building our \r\ncommon future, we all need to be sympathetic partners \r\nin order not to share the fate of the tower of Babel. \r\n An indicative road map of the specific proposals \r\nof Belarus will be circulated as an attachment to the \r\ntext of my statement. \r\n The Acting Chair (spoke in Arabic): I now give \r\nthe floor to His Excellency The Honourable Peter \r\nShanel Agovaka, Minister for Foreign Affairs and \r\nExternal Trade of the Solomon Islands. \r\n Mr. Agovaka (Solomon Islands): This occasion \r\nprovides us the opportunity to gauge our collective \r\nprogress in achieving the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs).  \r\n Ten years ago, when in this Assembly we \r\ncommitted to creating a better future for our \r\npopulations, we did not foresee the number of crises \r\nthat have emerged along the way. Since then, we have \r\nexperienced food, financial, energy and climate change \r\ncrises, testing and reversing the MDG gains made in \r\nearlier years. Moving forward to the remaining five \r\nyears will require us to examine mechanisms to ensure \r\nthat adequate resources have targeted MDG \r\nbenchmarks. \r\n Progress in Solomon Islands has been mixed and \r\nuneven. Our scorecards on the MDGs show some \r\nimprovement, though we are generally off-track, \r\noverall, in achieving all our goals. There are domestic \r\ndisparities in progress, especially between the formal \r\nand informal sectors of our society. Focus on the \r\nformal sector by our partners has seen slower progress \r\nin rural areas, where 80 per cent of the population \r\nresides. Climate change has seen our population \r\nmaking compromises and is creating pockets of \r\npoverty in various locations throughout the country. If \r\nwe are to address this crisis alone, we will need new \r\nand additional resources and would appreciate transfers \r\nof technology. \r\n Solomon Islands is on its own in implementing \r\nthe Brussels Programme of Action, which is supposed \r\nto be the vehicle for achieving the MDGs. Our \r\nvulnerability and special situation have been \r\noverlooked by partners adopting a one-size-fits-all \r\napproach through regional frameworks. There is a need \r\nto realign our approaches and link them to national \r\ndevelopment priorities to enhance national ownership \r\nand long-term sustainability. \r\n The recent broadening of cooperation between \r\nPacific small island developing States (SIDS) and the \r\nwider United Nations membership is slowly paying off. \r\nBilaterally, cooperation is allowing for policy space \r\nand flexibility in the implementation of the respective \r\ndevelopment strategies of Pacific SIDS. Italy and \r\nAustria have provided an excellent model for \r\n A/65/PV.5\r\n \r\n27 10-54298 \r\n \r\ncooperation, and all, including Turkey, continue to \r\nsupport our rural renewable energy programme. \r\n Investment in education remains a cross-cutting \r\nissue that allows populations to enhance their \r\neconomic productivity towards achieving all MDGs. \r\nOur partner Cuba continues to train our future doctors, \r\nfor which we remain grateful. Papua New Guinea, our \r\nclose neighbour, continues to provide a range of \r\nscholarships for our students. My Government is \r\nequally pleased to record a new partner, Portugal, in \r\nsupporting our education system. Taiwan, our multi-\r\nsectoral partner, along with our traditional partners, \r\nNew Zealand, the European Union and Australia, has \r\nsupported our free primary education. However, the \r\ndispersed populations scattered throughout the islands \r\nhave seen slow progress. Australia and other \r\ndevelopment partners have invested in eradicating \r\nmalaria, and it is our hope that in the remaining five \r\nyears that the programme will spread nationwide. \r\n In looking ahead, the world needs to identify \r\nconcepts that will accelerate the pace of MDG \r\nachievements. The MDG debt swap proposed a few \r\nyears ago needs to be reviewed as we begin the final \r\nfive years of our time-bound commitments. The \r\nconcept involves developing countries using domestic \r\ncapital to invest in the MDGs in return for payment of \r\ndebt to partners. Carbon-neutral initiatives must be \r\nexternally supported. Solomon Islands is in the process \r\nof joining the International Renewable Energy Agency. \r\n The Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2) \r\nunderscores the relevance of all major United Nations \r\nconferences, including the Mauritius Strategy review \r\nand the forthcoming least developed countries \r\nconference. The political declaration of the small \r\nisland developing States calls for a special category for \r\nsmall island developing States within the wider United \r\nNations system, which we support. Equally important \r\nis the Fourth United Nations Conference on the Least \r\nDeveloped Countries, scheduled for May 2011, which \r\nwill undertake a similar exercise of reviewing the \r\nimplementation of the Brussels Programme of Action \r\nfor the most vulnerable populations represented at the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n Many of the issues raised are global in nature and \r\nneed global solutions. There needs to be a global \r\noutreach with national deliverables. First, our \r\ncollective effort to remove agricultural trade barriers \r\nvia the World Trade Organization Doha talks, in order \r\nto have a fair and just trading system, is a must. \r\nSecondly, a legally binding climate change agreement \r\nwithin the United Nations Framework Convention on \r\nClimate Change (UNFCCC) and a second commitment \r\nperiod under the Kyoto Protocol are also essential. We \r\nwould like to see all partners outside the UNFCCC \r\nprocess play their role in contributing to the health of \r\nour atmosphere, including Taiwan as an observer. \r\n Thirdly, the implementation of a negotiated \r\ndeclaration on the MDGs should be adopted at this \r\nHigh-level Plenary Meeting on the MDGs. The draft \r\ndeclaration we have before us is not a series of good \r\nintentions but a declaration of concrete action that will \r\nneed vigorous implementation. \r\n I would like to close by stating that there are \r\nenough financial resources, technology and good will \r\nto realize our goals. The world needs new collaboration \r\nand alliances with new initiatives, which Solomon \r\nIslands is committed to honouring. \r\n The Acting Chair (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by Mr. José Maria \r\nNeves, Prime Minister of the Republic of Cape Verde. \r\n Mr. Neves (Cape Verde) (spoke in Portuguese; \r\nEnglish interpretation provided by the delegation): It is \r\nwith satisfaction and pride that I address this Assembly \r\nto present the investments, commitments and results of \r\nCape Verde in the achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs).  \r\n Cape Verdeans share a vision for the future: a \r\nmodern, competitive country with social cohesion and \r\na healthy environmental. We have a strategy to \r\ntransform the country into an international services \r\ncentre. We are acting to transform our comparative \r\nadvantages into sources of competitive advantages in \r\norder to accelerate the pace of economic growth and \r\nemployment generation, to ensure the best possible \r\nincome for families, and to combat poverty and all \r\nforms of social exclusion.  \r\n We are modernizing our infrastructure, \r\ndeveloping human capital, investing strongly in people \r\nand promoting the private sector. As a result of good \r\ngovernance and the consolidation of global \r\npartnerships, the country has added consistent gains to \r\nits process of development. Great advances have been \r\nmade in various sectors: education, health, the \r\nempowerment of women and strengthening of civil \r\nA/65/PV.5  \r\n \r\n10-54298 28 \r\n \r\nsociety, demonstrating the Government’s strong \r\npolitical commitment to reducing poverty. \r\n Cape Verde is on course to achieve all the \r\nMillennium Development Goals by 2015. Our growth \r\nand poverty reduction strategy integrates an approach \r\nthat cuts across gender, with the purpose of responding \r\nto the challenges faced by the population’s most \r\nvulnerable group — the women of Cape Verde. There \r\nis no development without gender equality and equity. \r\nOur strategy aims at empowering women in rural areas \r\nand creating employment for mothers who are heads of \r\npoor households. We are making ongoing efforts to \r\nadopt policy measures that ensure gender equality and \r\nequity. With respect to the participation of women in \r\npolitics, while only 15 per cent of members of \r\nParliament are women, Cape Verde now has parity \r\nwithin its Government. Of the 14 Ministers, eight are \r\nwomen. \r\n In the area of health, we have seen an increase in \r\nlife expectancy and a reduction in maternal and infant \r\nmortality. Today, 98 per cent of births take place in \r\nhospitals with specialized assistance. The HIV/AIDS \r\nprevalence rate is 0.8 per cent. \r\n We are investing strongly in education and \r\nprofessional training. People are our only natural \r\nresource, and we have to train and transform them into \r\nstrategic resources for development. The education rate \r\nis 96 per cent, and Cape Verde has achieved gender \r\nparity in primary and secondary education. We are also \r\ninvesting in social security in order to universalize \r\ndecent housing for all. In information technology, \r\ncommunications, renewable energy, water supply, \r\nagriculture and the food industry, I believe we have \r\nmade significant progress, especially in the past few \r\nyears, though we still have enormous challenges ahead \r\nof us. We are poor in terms of traditional natural \r\nresources, with barely 10 per cent of our land can be \r\ndeveloped. Cape Verde remains vulnerable, both \r\nenvironmentally and economically, and is subject to the \r\nnegative effects of climate change. Our archipelagic \r\nsituation requires enormous resources for infrastructure \r\ndevelopment.  \r\n We are at a critical moment in the life of our \r\ncountry. We are taking off, and we need to harness all \r\nour energies to achieve a radical transformation of our \r\nislands. We have shown that development is possible if \r\nwe have a vision, appropriate strategies, political will, \r\nfreedoms, democracy and good sense. Now more than \r\never, we need partnerships to help us take a leap \r\nforward and build our future. \r\n The Acting Chair (spoke in Arabic): I now give \r\nthe floor to His Excellency Mr. Ratu Inoke Kubuabola, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, International Cooperation \r\nand Civil Aviation of the Republic of Fiji. \r\n Mr. Kubuabola (Fiji): At the outset, may I, on \r\nbehalf of the peoples and Government of Fiji, take this \r\nopportunity to thank the Secretary-General for his \r\nforesight in proposing, and this Assembly for \r\nendorsing the convening of this high-level Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) progress review summit. \r\nFrom the survey of our collective progress made thus \r\nfar, and as we look forward to 2015, it is now apparent \r\nthat the bright spots of progress differ from one \r\ncountry to another. \r\n With respect to the status of its success in \r\nmeeting the MDGs, Fiji has made progress towards \r\nachieving all eight Goals. Our second report indicates \r\nthat we are on track to achieve five of the eight by \r\n2015. These include MDG 2, on universal primary \r\neducation; MDG 4, on reduced child mortality; MDG \r\n5, on reduced maternal mortality; MDG 7, on ensuring \r\nenvironmental sustainability; and MDG 8, on \r\ndeveloping a global partnership for development. \r\n The report also suggests that achieving three of \r\nthe Goals — MDG 1, on the eradication of extreme \r\npoverty and hunger; MDG 3, on the promotion of \r\ngender equality and women’s empowerment; and MDG \r\n6, on combating HIV/AIDS and other diseases — will \r\nbe a major challenge. The Government is fully \r\ncommitted and positive that these Goals will be \r\nrealized. \r\n While MDG 2 has already been effectively \r\nachieved in Fiji through strong and effective education \r\npolicies, of critical concern to us is the eradication of \r\nextreme poverty under MDG 1. We have identified a \r\nnumber of factors that have contributed to Fiji’s \r\nconstraints in making steady progress in this area. They \r\ninclude the global financial crisis; volatile global oil \r\nprices, which have led to inflationary pressures, thus \r\nreducing real incomes and pushing those at the \r\nthreshold of poverty into poverty; unresolved political \r\nchallenges, which have had a negative effect on \r\ninvestment, exports and employment growth, thus \r\ncontributing to poverty; and unproductive use of land \r\nresources. \r\n A/65/PV.5\r\n \r\n29 10-54298 \r\n \r\n While the first two factors are effectively beyond \r\nthe control of a small island economy like ours, we are \r\nable to control the last two. Accordingly, the \r\nGovernment has embarked upon an economic and \r\nsocio-political reform agenda as the foundation of its \r\nsustainable development framework, particularly in the \r\narea of good governance. Fiji has made significant \r\nefforts to strengthen this aspect by developing a culture \r\nof sustainable and democratic good governance that \r\nwill come to represent the dominant political thinking \r\nand behaviour of the people of Fiji. The aim is to \r\ncreate a Government structure that is truly \r\nparticipatory, consensus-oriented, accountable and \r\ntransparent, and that follows the rule of law. It ensures \r\nthat corruption will be minimized, the views of \r\nminorities taken into account, and the voices of \r\nsociety’s most vulnerable heard.  \r\n Land reform initiatives are also being \r\nimplemented to ensure the meaningful and maximal \r\nexploitation of our abundant resources. Additionally, \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals have been \r\nintegrated into the People’s Charter, our strategic \r\nframework for change and road map to ensure the \r\nsuccessful implementation and achievement of MDG \r\ntargets. \r\n For the remaining five years, Fiji is convinced \r\nthat addressing these challenges truly calls for \r\ninnovative approaches, matched by appropriate \r\ninstitutions, committed programmes, justice and equity \r\nin sharing resources, and above all, a stronger and \r\ncommitted global partnership. In this connection, the \r\nGovernment of Fiji is committed to undertaking a \r\ncomprehensive national analysis of progress in MDG \r\nimplementation, developing national breakthrough \r\naction plans for MDG acceleration, revisiting its \r\npolicies for mainstreaming and integrating MDGs into \r\nthe national development plan, formulating efficient \r\ndomestic resource management for achieving the \r\nMDGs, and conducting regular monitoring and \r\nassessment of MDG progress. \r\n In conclusion, the Secretary-General was right in \r\nsaying that the inability to achieve the MDG targets \r\nwould be an unacceptable failure from both the moral \r\nand the practical standpoints. Back in the year 2000, \r\nFiji committed itself to achieving the MDGs, and we \r\ncontinue to hold true to this commitment. As a \r\nGovernment, we know that any benefits accruing from \r\nour success will directly affect our own people. The \r\nleaders of the world foresaw that 10 years ago and we \r\nare committed to making it a reality. \r\n The Acting Chair (spoke in Arabic): I now give \r\nthe floor to His Excellency Mr. Kalombo T. Mwansa, \r\nMinister of Defence and Special Envoy of the \r\nPresident of Zambia. \r\n Mr. Mwansa (Zambia): With only five years \r\nremaining before the year set for achieving the MDGs, \r\nwe have taken stock of where we are. Zambia has made \r\nsignificant progress in improving the macroeconomic \r\nenvironment, leading to a sustained economic growth \r\nof 6.1 per cent over the past five years. Furthermore, \r\nthe country has put into place development \r\nframeworks, such as the Poverty Reduction Strategy \r\nPaper (PRSP) and the National Five-Year Strategic \r\nDevelopment Plan (2007-2011), which provide \r\nperiodic monitoring of MDG indicators, as part of its \r\ncommitment to the achievement of MDGs. \r\n Efforts have also been made in implementing pro-\r\npoor interventions. These include increasing farmer \r\ninput support in the form of fertilizer and seed from \r\n200,000 beneficiaries to more than 800,000. It is \r\nnoteworthy that food production has increased over the \r\nyears and the food security situation has improved, \r\nmaking the prospect of reducing hunger bright.  \r\n Furthermore, accelerating rural development is \r\nprime on our development agenda. We are improving \r\nthe state of our feeder roads, thereby enhancing service \r\ndelivery and access to markets for our rural population. \r\nThese interventions are reinforced by addressing \r\nhuman resource deficiencies in rural areas. In 2009 \r\nalone, we recruited a total of 1,610 frontline medical \r\npersonnel and also embarked on improving the work \r\nenvironment for health workers by, among other \r\nthings, implementing the rural retention scheme and \r\nbuilding houses for rural health workers. Consequently, \r\nthe staff head-count increased from 24,407 in 2008 to \r\n27,524 in 2009. \r\n We believe that these measures will significantly \r\ncontribute to meeting the MDGs related to the \r\nreduction of child mortality, improving maternal \r\nmortality, and combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other \r\nmajor diseases. We are determined to vigorously \r\nmaintain these initiatives so that our potential to meet \r\nhealth-related MDGs remains on course. \r\n With regard to achieving universal primary \r\neducation, similar strategies as to those being \r\nA/65/PV.5  \r\n \r\n10-54298 30 \r\n \r\nimplemented in the health sector are being pursued. \r\nBetween 2005 and 2009, my Government has recruited \r\nand deployed over 25,000 teachers, and, between 2008 \r\nand 2010, close to 6,000 basic school classrooms were \r\nbuilt. These measures target the infrastructure and \r\nhuman resource deficits in rural areas. Most of the \r\ntargets under this MDG continue to be on track. I am \r\npleased to report that Zambia is set to meet this MDG. \r\n Zambia is tirelessly addressing gender-related \r\nimbalances through affirmative action and programmes \r\nsuch as scholarships for assisting girls to excel at basic, \r\nsecondary and university education levels. In addition, \r\nZambia has established the Citizens’ Economic \r\nEmpowerment Fund with a view to empowering as \r\nmany rural women as possible. In this regard, Zambia \r\nwelcomes the establishment of the United Nations \r\nEntity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of \r\nWomen, (UN Women), the new United Nations entity \r\nfor promoting gender equality and the empowerment of \r\nwomen.  \r\n The positive economic growth that Zambia \r\ncontinues to enjoy has been made possible with support \r\nfrom our cooperating partners. Besides the debt relief \r\naccessed in 2004 after having reached the halfway \r\ncompletion point, we received a total of $798 million \r\nfrom external partners through various donor-support \r\nmechanisms. In 2008, this amount was increased to \r\n$856 million and is suspected expected to further \r\nincrease before the end of 2010. \r\n Zambia continues to engage positively with its \r\ncooperating partners through a number of modalities \r\nfor dialogue, which are proving good platforms for \r\nattracting development assistance while ensuring that \r\nZambia’s debt position is within sustainable levels. \r\n Zambia still faces challenges in meeting MDG 7, \r\n“Ensure Environmental Sustainability”, due to high \r\npoverty levels and lack of alternative sources of \r\nlivelihood for poor people. This has resulted in most of \r\nour deprived putting pressure on environmental \r\nresources. Nevertheless, policies and programmes are \r\nbeing formulated to support and promote sustainable \r\nenvironmental management. \r\n As I conclude, I would like to say that the \r\ncommitment to ensuring the attainment of MDG 8, \r\n“Develop a Global Partnership for Development”, is \r\ncritical if the overall Millennium Development Goals \r\nare to be attained. Most the interventions that support \r\nthe attainment of the Goals depend on not only on a \r\ngood national supportive  environment, but also on the \r\nsustained and adequate financial inflows. We allude to \r\nthe commitments made at the G8 Gleneagles Summit \r\nto increase aid to Africa. I therefore call upon \r\ncooperating partners to honour their pledges and also \r\nto ensure a balanced distribution of official \r\ndevelopment assistance. \r\n The Acting Chair (spoke in Arabic): I now give \r\nthe floor to Her Excellency Mrs. Carolyn Rodrigues-\r\nBirkett, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Guyana. \r\n Mrs. Rodrigues-Birkett (Guyana): Ten years \r\nago, world leaders committed pledged to “spare no \r\neffort” to assure the achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). It was a promise that \r\nresonated with people everywhere. Today, we ask \r\nourselves: why for so many has this promise remained \r\nunfulfilled? \r\n Why is our common quest to achieve these Goals \r\nso far off- track? Where are the resources that were \r\npledged? In a world of increasing prosperity, \r\nexpanding knowledge and growing interdependence, \r\nwhy should hunger, disease and deprivation remain the \r\nlot of millions, indeed billions, of people? \r\n These questions deserve answers. All countries, \r\nrich or poor, of whatever political, economic, \r\nideological or other orientation, can make a difference \r\nto the fate of these teeming millions if we work \r\ntogether in genuine partnership. Indeed, it is imperative \r\nthat we do so. \r\n Guyana has adopted a progressive and integrated \r\napproach. Prudent management of macroeconomic and \r\nfiscal policy and the prioritizing of social and \r\ninfrastructural development have allowed us to make \r\nsignificant progress on several of the MDGs, and to \r\nweather the worst impacts of the financial and food \r\ncrises. We have witnessed significant achievements in \r\neducation, the environment, gender equality, poverty \r\neradication, and health, in particular, in reversing the \r\ntrend in mother-to-child transmission of HIV. \r\n Guyana has moved a step further by developing a \r\nlow-carbon development strategy to place our economy \r\non a low-carbon trajectory. Last November, a \r\nmemorandum of understanding was signed with \r\nNorway to implement a national-scale model for \r\ndeploying forests to address climate change without \r\ncompromising sovereignty or national development \r\npriorities. It will help to finance critical \r\n A/65/PV.5\r\n \r\n31 10-54298 \r\n \r\ntransformational infrastructure and low-carbon \r\nbusiness initiatives, and advance Guyana’s long-\r\nstanding commitment to people-centred development \r\nthrough greater investment in the social sector. It \r\nrepresents a model of partnership between developing \r\nand developed countries to advance common \r\ndevelopment and environmental objectives. Despite the \r\nprogress we have made at the national level, we cannot \r\nbe complacent, as serious challenges remain. \r\n At the global level the evidence points to \r\nimportant successes, but also to significant \r\nshortcomings. The overarching lesson made clear by \r\nthe evidence before us is that with adequate resources, \r\nthe right policies and actions at all levels and renewed \r\npolitical commitment, the MDGs remain eminently \r\nachievable. As the report of the Secretary-General \r\nmakes clear: \r\n  “The shortfalls in progress towards the \r\nMillennium Development Goals are not because \r\nthey are unreachable or because the time is too \r\nshort, but rather because of unmet commitments, \r\ninadequate resources, lack of focus and \r\naccountability, and insufficient interest in \r\nsustainable development.” (A/64/665, para. 116)  \r\n Several pervasive challenges remain that require \r\na global response. Action is needed to strengthen the \r\nsystems of global governance in order to create a more \r\nequitable, representative and effective multilateral \r\nsystem; to reform and modernize the international \r\nfinancial institutions to better enable them to respond \r\nto and prevent financial and economic emergencies; to \r\nstrengthen the capabilities and capacities of the United \r\nNations to discharge its mandates more effectively and \r\nefficiently; and to address shortcomings of the \r\ninternational trading system. We see the need for \r\ndetermined efforts to increase agricultural production \r\nand productivity, to counter the increased incidence of \r\ncommunicable diseases, and to address the overriding \r\nthreat posed by climate change. \r\n It is imperative that we direct increased attention \r\nto addressing the factors at the domestic and \r\ninternational levels that perpetuate poverty and \r\ninequality. It is clear that a global system premised on \r\nsignificant inequalities is unsustainable. Persistent \r\ninequality within and between countries and deep-\r\nseated deprivation undermine peace and security, the \r\nenjoyment of all human rights and the efficacy of \r\ndevelopment efforts, especially for the most vulnerable \r\nsegments of populations in all countries. \r\n In this regard, it is appropriate to recall the clear \r\nunderstanding of the Millennium Declaration \r\n(resolution 55/2) that there would be increased direct \r\nsupport for the efforts of developing countries to \r\nfacilitate the achievement of the MDGs. This \r\nunderstanding remains fundamental to the kinds of \r\npartnerships necessary to assure achievement of the \r\nMDGs. While fluctuating financial, political and \r\neconomic fortunes invariably impact the timeliness of \r\ndelivery, they should not diminish our commitment to \r\nthe poor, especially in times of crisis, or reduce the \r\ndetermination to work in partnership. \r\n This Meeting can be deemed a success only if, by \r\nits conclusion, we recommit to ensuring that the MDGs \r\ncan be achieved in every country. It represents, \r\narguably, our last best opportunity to provide a turning \r\npoint in accelerating progress in the achievement of the \r\nMDGs. Let us together — Governments, civil society, \r\nthe private sector and all other actors — ensure that the \r\nsolemn declarations made and promises undertaken \r\nindeed translate into meaningful improvements for the \r\npeoples of the world. Let us not be found wanting. \r\n The Acting Chair (spoke in Arabic): I now give \r\nthe floor to His Excellency Mr. Lucien Marie Noël \r\nBembamba, Minister of Finance of Burkina Faso.  \r\n Mr. Bembamba (Burkina Faso) (spoke in \r\nFrench): At the outset, let me, on behalf of my \r\ndelegation, congratulate Mr. Deiss on his election to \r\npreside over the sixty-fifth session of the General \r\nAssembly, and express in particular our satisfaction at \r\nseeing him preside over this important meeting. I also \r\nconvey our gratitude to the Secretary-General for his \r\nsteadfast readiness to defend the ideals of the United \r\nNations. \r\n The Millennium Summit of September 2000 \r\nsparked great hope, because the heads of State and \r\nGovernment who met there proposed an ambitious yet \r\nrealistic global development policy aimed at achieving \r\nby 2015 the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), \r\nwhich serve as useful yardsticks for measuring the vast \r\nchasm between the world in which we live and the \r\nworld we seek. Ten years after their adoption, results \r\non their implementation are mixed.  \r\n In Burkina Faso, despite the many challenges to \r\neconomic expansion, progress has been made in \r\nA/65/PV.5  \r\n \r\n10-54298 32 \r\n \r\nfighting poverty. The most meaningful progress has \r\nbeen in the area of access to drinking water, where the \r\npercentage of the population with access to potable \r\nwater has risen from 43.1 per cent in 1994 to nearly \r\n80 per cent in 2010. Similarly, with respect to \r\neducation and health care, encouraging results have \r\nbeen achieved, in particular with respect to net \r\nenrolment rates, infant and maternal mortality rates, \r\nand above all the prevalence rate of HIV/AIDS, which \r\nstabilized at around 1.6 per cent in 2008, as compared \r\nto 7.17 per cent in 1997, while free retroviral drugs \r\nhave been available since 1 January. \r\n Nevertheless, major challenges persist with \r\nrespect to gender equality, improving the health care \r\nsystem, education and adult literacy, and protecting the \r\nenvironment. Burkina Faso’s achievement of the \r\nMDGs could also be further undermined by the effects \r\nof the financial crisis and climate change, which has \r\nhad certain visible effects, including flooding. \r\n If we are to win the battle to achieve the MDGs, \r\nwe shall require synergistic action and robust political \r\nwill. It is high time that we send new signs of \r\ncommitment and will. Burkina Faso for its part wishes \r\nto reaffirm here what we believe to be fundamental in \r\nthe battle to achieve the MDGs. First, the MDGs must \r\nbe viewed as rights of our peoples. Secondly, the \r\nMDGs must more than ever be an integral part of \r\nglobal development strategies and taken systematically \r\ninto account in policies and programmes, serving as a \r\nframe of reference and space for dialogue with our \r\ndevelopment partners, be they the international \r\nfinancial institutions and organizations or civil society. \r\nThirdly, policies to mobilize resources for the MDGs \r\nmust draw on innovative pillars to accelerate the \r\nprocess. \r\n Finally, the struggle to attain the MDGs must \r\ninvolve all nations, without any exception. \r\n With respect to expectations, the shortfall in \r\nfinancial resources is a major constraint in achieving \r\nthe MDGs. That is why we are taking this opportunity \r\nto urge donors to work to ensure the success of \r\nongoing discussions, especially on replenishment, with \r\nthe International Development Association and the \r\nWorld Bank Group, as well as with the African \r\nDevelopment Fund and the African Development Bank \r\nGroup. \r\n Likewise, we reaffirm our earnest hope for \r\nimproved market access in a more equitable \r\ninternational trade environment. We have always \r\nfirmly believed that equitable trade is needed if we are \r\nto accelerate economic growth, in particular for low-\r\nincome countries, and if we are to generate substantial \r\nresources to fund their development and help them to \r\nattain the MDGs. \r\n In this period of globalization, all peoples must \r\nparticipate in the international community’s efforts to \r\nattain the MDGs. That is why Burkina Faso hopes that \r\nthe Republic of China, Taiwan, will be a full-fledged \r\npartner in the implementation of the MDGs. \r\n Together, we need to work in greater solidarity to \r\nattain the MDGs and to join together in building a \r\nbetter world for all the peoples of our planet. \r\n The Acting Chair (spoke in Arabic): I now give \r\nthe floor to Her Excellency Ms. Amira El Fadal, \r\nMinister of Welfare and Social Security of the \r\nRepublic of the Sudan. \r\n Ms. El Fadal (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): I wish at \r\nthe outset, on behalf of my delegation and on my own \r\naccount, to thank the organizers of this important event \r\nfor their efforts in convening this High-level Plenary \r\nMeeting on the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs) and in promoting an agreed programme of \r\naction from now through 2015, the deadline for the \r\nattainment of the MDGs, which is now less than five \r\nyears away. We meet today to forge effective policies \r\nand constructive initiatives to face the increasingly \r\ndaunting challenges and to build on what we have \r\nalready achieved on the implementation of the MDGs. \r\n There is no doubt that today’s international \r\neconomic, financial and trade situation is an obstacle to \r\ndevelopment in developing countries, in particular the \r\nleast developed among them, and poses a genuine \r\nthreat to their peoples. That is true for a number of \r\nreasons, such as decreasing official development \r\nassistance (ODA), unfair international trade conditions, \r\nrestrictions on developing country exports to world \r\nmarkets and low commodity prices, as well as the \r\nheavy burden of external debt and the negative impact \r\nof globalization. In addition to those challenges, \r\nhunger, disease and internal strife are additional \r\nchallenges to those societies and to the wider \r\ninternational community. That is why the level of \r\nattainment of the MDGs will continue to fall short of \r\nthe aspirations of the African continent. \r\n A/65/PV.5\r\n \r\n33 10-54298 \r\n \r\n The international community must recognize that \r\nrapidly growing challenges and their negative \r\nconsequences demand collective efforts under the \r\nleadership of a capable and effective international \r\norganization such as the United Nations, which devises \r\ncreative initiatives that can help us face those \r\nchallenges. \r\n My country has made great efforts to attain the \r\nMDGs. We have made considerable progress in \r\ncarrying out projects benefiting marginalized sectors of \r\nour society, with a view to easing poverty and \r\nimproving education and health care — in particular \r\nmaternal and child health and combating disease. \r\n On poverty, the Sudan has implemented a series \r\nof five-year plans aimed at achieving economic and \r\nsocial development and alleviating poverty. We have \r\nset up a supreme council to monitor the preparation \r\nand implementation of a national anti-poverty strategy, \r\nchaired by His Excellency the President of the \r\nRepublic. We have increased expenditures on the poor \r\nto 9 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) as of \r\n2009. We have allocated 12 per cent of commercial \r\nbank credits to microfinancing. The zakat charity \r\nmechanism has contributed through an interdependent \r\npoverty-alleviation project for poor families valued at \r\nmore than $200 million annually. \r\n The Sudan has also experienced positive \r\ndevelopments in the field of education as part of an \r\nofficial national policy and strategy, in particular by \r\nproviding free compulsory education for all children, \r\nespecially girls. On the empowerment of women, we \r\nhave forged a national strategy to promote and \r\nempower women in all sectors of society. In 2005 we \r\nadopted a national plan on violence against women, \r\nand within the Ministry of Justice we have established \r\na special unit to combat violence against women and \r\nchildren. In 2006, within the Ministry of the Interior, \r\nwe established a unit to protect families and children. \r\nWe attach exceptional priority to our 2008 national \r\nstrategy on female circumcision. We have amended the \r\npenal code to include adequate protection for women \r\nduring armed conflict. \r\n Also, we have allocated 25 per cent of seats in \r\nthe national legislative council and in state legislative \r\ncouncils to women. The number of women \r\nparliamentarians has reached 300. Moreover, the State \r\nhas adopted policies and measures to support child \r\nhealth and to provide free health care to all children \r\nunder five. In 2010 these efforts culminated in our \r\nratification of the Federal Child Act. The State has \r\ngiven high priority to reproductive health and has \r\nestablished a national plan in that regard. It is now \r\nimplementing a road map to reduce maternal mortality. \r\n In the sphere of environmental sustainability, we \r\nhave ratified all regional and international agreements, \r\nprotocols and programmes on environmental protection \r\nand have adopted a strategy for the supply of drinking \r\nwater and sanitation. \r\n We reaffirm the great importance of official \r\ndevelopment assistance as a complementary \r\ndevelopment tool. The global crisis should not be used \r\nas an excuse to reduce the ODA pledged by developed \r\ncountries. As a country emerging from internal \r\nconflict, the Sudan achieved a great deal with the \r\nsignature of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. But \r\nit has received very little of the support pledged to it at \r\nthe first and second Oslo donors conferences, and it \r\nhas been relying on its own national efforts to \r\nimplement its development plans. \r\n We reaffirm the importance of the United Nations \r\nin leading all efforts to attain the MDGs. We bear a \r\ncollective responsibility to make the Organization \r\neffective, universal and inclusive as it effectively \r\naddresses the whole range of world problems and \r\nissues, including those related to development. We \r\ntherefore look forward to deepening our multilateral \r\ninternational cooperation and to giving priority to \r\ncollective interests rather than selfish narrow interests, \r\nfor the sake of creating an international environment \r\nconducive to sustainable environmental cooperation. \r\n In conclusion, allow me to add that the Sudan is \r\ncoming to an extremely important and critical phase in \r\nits history — the referendum to be held in three and a \r\nhalf months. We need the support and welcome efforts \r\nof the United Nations in order to strengthen our choice \r\nof voluntary unity and to preserve the Sudan as a \r\nunified, safe and stable country that enjoys peace, \r\namity, cooperation, brotherhood and solidarity. \r\n The Acting Chair (spoke in Arabic): I now give \r\nthe floor to His Excellency Mr. Daniele Bodini, chair \r\nof the delegation of the Republic of San Marino. \r\n Mr. Bodini (San Marino): At the outset, let me \r\ncommend the tireless efforts of the Secretary-General \r\nin pushing forward the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs), as well as the sincere interest of Presidents \r\nA/65/PV.5  \r\n \r\n10-54298 34 \r\n \r\nTreki and Deiss in pursuing this agenda. I also would \r\nlike to commend the Permanent Representatives of \r\nSenegal and Denmark for guiding the negotiations on \r\nthe draft outcome document (A/65/L.1). \r\n Ten years ago, our heads of State and \r\nGovernment from countries small and large, \r\ndeveloping and developed, from the North and the \r\nSouth, agreed upon the Millennium Development \r\nGoals, to be achieved by 2015 — a bold but much \r\nneeded undertaking. Today, two-thirds of the way \r\nalong this journey, we are here to assess our own \r\nperformances in fulfilling these fundamental \r\nhumanitarian needs. The excellent report of the \r\nSecretary-General (A/64/665) underlines that in some \r\nareas we have succeeded, but that in others we are still \r\nlagging behind. Much more has to be accomplished in \r\nthe next five years. I am certain that no one in this Hall \r\nor anywhere else believes that the MDGs should not be \r\nachieved. \r\n During the past few years, unexpected economic \r\nand financial world upheavals, as well as major natural \r\ncatastrophes, derailed the process started 10 years ago. \r\nTogether, today in this same Hall, we are reasserting \r\nour commitment to the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. Obviously, lasting success will depend on \r\nsustainable worldwide economic growth.  \r\n To reach our goals, we have to provide \r\nappropriate jobs to the hundreds of millions of \r\nunemployed or underemployed, especially the young. \r\nThey will be the new, steady and enthusiastic engine to \r\npropel forward our world economy. I am convinced \r\nthat the new generations will create a world of social \r\nand economic stability, not only in the developing \r\ncountries, but also in the developed ones. This \r\nreinvigorated economy will propel the MDG effort as \r\nwell. \r\n We must correct our world financial system so \r\nthat the rewards of our collective work can continue to \r\ngrow and maintain a steady and safe value. The \r\nuncertainty created in the past few years by \r\nunregulated, speculative financial behaviour has \r\nhampered the economic and social stability of so many \r\nof our countries and unfortunately derailed progress \r\ntowards achieving the Millennium Development Goals. \r\nWe must also encourage a stronger public-private \r\npartnership in every sector of our global alliance to \r\nhelp employ all our world citizens. \r\n In conclusion, San Marino, a proud Member of \r\nthe United Nations and the General Assembly, is \r\ngrateful for the renewed commitment of so many \r\ncountries to continue on the right path towards \r\nreaching our Millennium Development Goals. \r\n The Acting Chair (spoke in Arabic): I now give \r\nthe floor to His Excellency Mr. Jorge Valero Briceño, \r\nchair of the delegation of the Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela. \r\n Mr. Valero Briceño (Venezuela) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): Ten years after the World Summit at which \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals were approved, the \r\nresults are disappointing. The fulfilment of the Goals is \r\nseriously threatened. Most developed countries have \r\nnot fulfilled the commitment of allocating 0.7 per cent \r\nof their gross national income to official development \r\nassistance. The global economic and financial crisis of \r\ncapitalism of recent years has created more poverty, \r\nmore inequality and more injustice.  \r\n The financial economy exercises hegemony over \r\nthe world and increases the accumulation of billions of \r\ndollars without creating any good. It is the economy of \r\nthe casino. It has subjugated States and seeks to \r\ndestroy the public sphere and to privatize everything, \r\nfrom public services to war. \r\n Market totalitarianism prevents the exercise of \r\nhuman rights and the right to development. In this \r\ncontext, there is no right to work or health care; there \r\nis only labour market adjustments and private \r\ncompanies that provide health insurance. There is also \r\nno right to food, which depends on the international \r\nmarket that has turned food into objects of speculation \r\nthrough futures transactions. \r\n The reduction in social spending has affected the \r\nability of States to ensure the economic, social and \r\ncultural rights of their peoples. Even in developed \r\ncountries, the most vulnerable sectors cannot escape \r\nthe heinous effects of the capitalist crisis, caused by \r\nfinancial speculators with the complicity of the world’s \r\nmost powerful Governments and the Bretton Woods \r\ninstitutions. \r\n The Bolivarian revolution, under the leadership \r\nof President Hugo Chávez Frías, promotes an \r\nalternative model of development that is humanist and \r\neffects deep structural changes in favour of the poor \r\nand the excluded. Although our country has not \r\nescaped the negative effects of the crisis of capitalism, \r\n A/65/PV.5\r\n \r\n35 10-54298 \r\n \r\nsocial investment has increased, and today Venezuelans \r\nincreasingly enjoy improved living conditions. Social \r\ninvestment has become a national strategy to achieve \r\nsovereign and comprehensive development, and thus to \r\nattain the Millennium Development Goals. Sixty per \r\ncent of total tax revenue between 1999 and 2009 has \r\nbeen earmarked for social investment. As a result, we \r\nare moving towards a universal social security system. \r\n Social missions, in favour of the most excluded \r\nsectors of society, have enabled Venezuela to achieve \r\nsocial inclusion quickly and on a large scale. The \r\npoverty rate fell from 49 per cent in 1998 to 24 per \r\ncent at the end of 2009. And during the same period \r\nextreme poverty fell dramatically, from 29.8 per cent to \r\n7.2 per cent. \r\n The Economic Commission for Latin America \r\nand the Caribbean has recognized that Venezuela is the \r\ncountry that has reduced inequality the most in the \r\nregion. The unemployment rate in Venezuela fell from \r\n15 per cent in 1998, before the start of the \r\nrevolutionary Government headed by President Chávez \r\nFrías, to 6.6 per cent in 2009. \r\n The promotion of gender equality and greater \r\ninvolvement of women in economic and social matters \r\nin Venezuela has already been achieved. State policies \r\nfoster the training and equal participation of women in \r\npublic life. Here is an important fact: four of the five \r\nbranches of public power in Venezuela are chaired by \r\nwomen — the legislative, electoral, judicial and moral. \r\n By 2001 Venezuela had already reached the target \r\non access to safe drinking water. And in 2005 \r\nVenezuela met the target in waste water collection.  \r\n In our country, we are advancing in the \r\nuniversalization of rights related to identity, food, \r\nhealth, education and employment. In 2005, UNESCO \r\ndeclared Venezuela to be an illiteracy-free country, \r\nthanks to plans carried out in cooperation with our \r\nbrothers in Cuba. And recently, the same United \r\nNations agency declared that Venezuela was among the \r\nfive countries in the world with greatest access to \r\nuniversity education. Furthermore, before 2015 \r\nVenezuela will achieve, among other milestones, the \r\nuniversalization of primary education, a reduction in \r\nthe child mortality rate, a reduction in the maternal \r\nmortality rate and a reduction in the spread of \r\nHIV/AIDS, and it will roll back the incidence of \r\nmalaria and dengue fever. \r\n In Venezuela, we are moving towards a high-\r\nquality democracy focused solely on the interests, \r\nneeds and hopes of our people: a participatory and \r\nactive democracy where political freedoms are truly \r\nexercised and where the benefits of development are \r\nenjoyed. \r\n The Bolivarian Government promotes Latin \r\nAmerican and Caribbean integration, based on the \r\nprinciples of cooperation, solidarity and \r\ncomplementarity. The Bolivarian Alliance for the \r\nPeoples of Our America — Peoples’ Trade Agreement \r\n(ALBA-TCP) and Petrocaribe are contributing to the \r\neradication of poverty and to overcoming inequality \r\nand unemployment in our region. Hence, Venezuela \r\nsupports brother of the continent in achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. \r\n Venezuela has regained full control of its natural \r\nresources. In Venezuela, all basic services are \r\nconsidered to be human rights. Our country’s \r\nresources, managed in a sovereign manner, have \r\nallowed for the creation of the Bank of the South and \r\nthe Bank of ALBA. State policies have become tools to \r\npromote independent and autonomous development, \r\nwithout the tyranny of the World Bank and the \r\nInternational Monetary Fund. In place of neo-liberal \r\nglobalization, we propose the globalization of justice \r\nand equity. In place of the looting and subjection of \r\ncountries, we propose fair trade and a world in which \r\nwe all win, through solidarity and partnership. \r\n Under the leadership of President Hugo Chávez \r\nFrías, Venezuela has met most of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. Within the framework of the full \r\nexercise of sovereignty and self-determination, we \r\nhave opted for the Venezuelan route to socialism in \r\norder to create a society where justice, equality and \r\nsolidarity reign, with full enjoyment of human rights \r\nand democratic freedoms. \r\n Our Bolivarian revolution is geared towards the \r\nfull realization of social, economic and cultural \r\nguarantees, fully consistent with the words of our \r\nliberator, Simón Bolívar, who, at the Congress of \r\nAngostura in 1819, stated that “the most perfect system \r\nof Government is that which results in the greatest \r\npossible measure of happiness, the greatest social \r\nsecurity and the greatest political stability”. \r\n  The meeting rose at 1.10 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
