(Switzerland) \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 9 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nHigh-level plenary meeting as a contribution to the \r\n2010 International Year of Biodiversity \r\n \r\nAgenda item 20 \r\n \r\nSustainable development \r\n \r\n (f) Convention on Biological Diversity \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): I declare open \r\nthe one-day high-level plenary meeting as a \r\ncontribution to the 2010 International Year of \r\nBiodiversity, held in accordance with resolution 64/203 \r\nof 21 December 2009 and decisions 64/555 of 15 April \r\n2010 and 64/567 of 13 September 2010.  \r\n Biodiversity is at the very heart of life. In \r\ndeclaring 2010 the International Year of Biodiversity, \r\nthe General Assembly launched an appeal to celebrate \r\nlife on Earth and the value of biodiversity. The \r\nInternational Year of Biodiversity is an invitation to act \r\nthis year and in the years to come to safeguard the \r\nbiodiversity of life on Earth. I am very pleased that, at \r\nthis beginning of the sixty-fifth session, we are holding \r\na meeting of the General Assembly as a contribution to \r\nthe International Year of Biodiversity, and I welcome \r\neveryone most sincerely.  \r\n Throughout time, biodiversity has been essential \r\nto human existence, but it is often difficult to grasp its \r\nimportance, and particularly of the risks run by losing \r\nit. And yet, we are nourished by plants and animals, \r\nand insects carry out pollination and are an essential \r\nlink in the food chain. Rain water becomes drinking \r\nwater due to a process of filtering through the soil. The \r\noxygen that we breathe is the product of the \r\nphotosynthesis of algae and green plants.  \r\n Today, biodiversity is declining throughout the \r\nworld, and humankind’s activities are to a large extent \r\nresponsible. Climate change is further worsening the \r\nproblem. Moreover, the deterioration of many vital \r\nservices rendered by ecosystems jeopardizes the \r\nprogress accomplished towards achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. Indeed, while we are \r\nall threatened by a decline in biodiversity, the \r\nconsequences will be even more onerous for the \r\npoorest among us. Many areas rich in biodiversity are \r\nin developing countries, the people of which are \r\nparticularly dependent on agriculture, fishing and \r\nforestry for their subsistence.  \r\n It is heartening to note that the international \r\ncommunity is mobilizing to deal with this threat. The \r\nadoption in 2002 of the 2010 biodiversity target was an \r\nimportant milestone. That target, which was also \r\nincorporated into the Millennium Development Goal \r\non environment, has not been achieved, but many \r\nStates that have been inspired by it to take specific \r\nmeasures to protect biodiversity. Furthermore, myriad \r\ninitiatives are aimed at better reconciling biodiversity \r\nand economics and at assessing the economic value of \r\nservices provided by ecosystems.  \r\n A better awareness of the cost of the loss of \r\nbiodiversity is essential if our actions to protect \r\nbiodiversity are to be more effective. It is essential for \r\ncompanies to understand the benefits of biodiversity \r\nA/65/PV.7  \r\n \r\n10-54515 2 \r\n \r\nand move towards modes of production that are more \r\nenvironmentally friendly and towards a green \r\neconomy. We need to persevere in our efforts. \r\n Quite recently, last June in Busan in the Republic \r\nof Korea, the international community decided to \r\nestablish an intergovernmental science-policy platform \r\naimed at filling the gap between scientific knowledge \r\non the deterioration of the natural environment and the \r\nactions of Governments. That was a major \r\nbreakthrough towards organizing a consistent and \r\neffective multilateral response to the loss of \r\nbiodiversity. Next month in Nagoya, Japan, the tenth \r\nmeeting of the Conference of the Parties to the \r\nConvention on Biodiversity will be held. A new \r\nstrategic plan for the Convention will be adopted there. \r\nIt is my hope that our discussions today at this high-\r\nlevel meeting will make a useful contribution to the \r\nnegotiations to be undertaken in Nagoya in order to \r\nensure that the new plan will be exhaustive, ambitious \r\nand feasible. \r\n Preserving biodiversity is inseparable from the \r\nfight against poverty, improving health, prosperity and \r\nsecurity of present and future generations, as well as \r\nfrom the fight against climate change. Preserving \r\nbiodiversity is not a luxury; it is a duty. \r\n I now give the floor to His Excellency Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon.  \r\n The Secretary-General: I commend the General \r\nAssembly for convening this high-level meeting. \r\nConserving the planet’s species and habitats, and the \r\ngoods and services they provide, is central to \r\nsustainable development and the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. This year is not only the \r\nInternational Year of Biodiversity; it is also the \r\ndeadline by which the international community had \r\npledged to substantially reduce the rate of biodiversity \r\nloss. The 2010 target will not be met. Indeed, as we see \r\nfrom the third edition of Global Biodiversity Outlook, \r\nissued by the Convention on Biological Diversity, the \r\nglobal decline in biodiversity is accelerating. Science \r\ntells us that our actions have pushed extinctions up to \r\n1,000 times the natural background rate.  \r\n The reason is simple: human activities — yours, \r\nmine and everyone’s. The main causes include \r\ndeforestation, changes in habitat and land degradation. \r\nThe growing impact of climate change is compounding \r\nthe problem.  \r\n As with most emergencies, those hardest hit are \r\nthe poor. We have all heard of the web of life. The way \r\nwe live threatens to trap us in a web of death. Too \r\nmany people still fail to grasp the implications of this \r\ndestruction. They do not see why we need to preserve \r\nan obscure frog here or an endangered owl there. Many \r\nstill think that the Earth is ours to use as we like. \r\n This argument betrays a woeful ignorance of the \r\nimportance of ecosystems to our well-being as a \r\nspecies, to climate regulation, to water supplies and to \r\nfood security. In this International Year, we need to \r\ndemonstrate the concrete benefits of investing in \r\nbiodiversity. Ecosystem services are directly linked to \r\nthe bottom line. They are our natural capital. We need \r\nto show that protecting ecosystems can help us achieve \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals and build \r\nresilience to climate change.  \r\n All over the world, ecosystem services are a \r\nmassive undervalued subsidy provided by the \r\nenvironment. When we lose these services through \r\nmismanagement, crops fail, profits drop, people \r\nbecome poorer and economies suffer. Let us think of \r\nthe human cost of deforestation in countries such as \r\nHaiti and Ethiopia or the dust-bowl in this country in \r\nthe 1930s.  \r\n Last year’s financial crisis was a wake-up call to \r\nGovernments on the perils of failing to oversee and \r\nregulate complex relationships that affect us all. The \r\nbiodiversity crisis is no different. We are bankrupting \r\nour natural economy. We need to fashion a rescue \r\npackage before it is too late.  \r\n Next month, 193 parties to the Convention on \r\nBiological Diversity will meet in Nagoya, Japan. They \r\nwill adopt a new strategic plan on biodiversity and a \r\n2050 biodiversity vision. This overarching \r\ninternational biodiversity framework is the result of a \r\ncomprehensive and inclusive two-year process. It calls \r\nfor concrete national targets before the United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development 2012, the \r\nengagement of all stake-holders and the inclusion of \r\nbiodiversity considerations across all sectors of our \r\nsociety. It includes the means of implementation, as \r\nwell as monitoring and evaluation mechanisms. It will \r\naddress the important issues of access to genetic \r\nresources and the equitable sharing of the benefits \r\nderived from them.  \r\n It is a solid plan on paper, but it will need \r\nleadership to bring it to life, not just from \r\n A/65/PV.7\r\n \r\n3 10-54515 \r\n \r\nenvironmental ministers but from finance and planning \r\nministers, economic production and transport \r\nministers, and health and social welfare ministers. \r\nMoreover, we must stop thinking of environmental \r\nprotection as a cost. It is an investment that goes hand \r\nin hand with the other investments that heads of State \r\nand Government must make to consolidate economic \r\ngrowth and human well-being in their countries. \r\nMaintaining and restoring our natural infrastructure \r\ncan provide economic gains worth trillions of dollars \r\neach year. Allowing it to decline is like throwing \r\nmoney out of the window.  \r\n I urge all leaders present today to commit to \r\nreducing biodiversity loss. That will be their legacy \r\nand their gift to generations to come. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I thank the \r\nSecretary-General for his statement. \r\n I now give the floor to His Excellency \r\nMr. Abdullah Alsaidi, Permanent Representative of \r\nYemen to the United Nations. \r\n Mr. Alsaidi (Yemen): I have the distinct honour \r\nand privilege to address the General Assembly on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China.  \r\n This is the first time in the history of the United \r\nNations that the issue of biodiversity is being \r\naddressed at the level of heads of State and \r\nGovernment. Our meeting today provides not only a \r\nunique opportunity to highlight the challenges we face, \r\nbut also the opportunity that managing the resources of \r\nbiodiversity offers, in particular as it relates to \r\neradicating poverty and improving the livelihood of \r\nmillions of people. Biodiversity is a key element of \r\ndevelopment.  \r\n As the natural wealth of the poor, biodiversity is \r\ncritical to developing countries. The poorest and most \r\nvulnerable in developing countries depend on \r\nbiodiversity for a range of services — from health and \r\nnutrition to serving as a safety-net when faced with \r\nclimate variability and natural disaster — and even for \r\ntheir livelihoods. At the same time, developing \r\ncountries are a treasure trove of biodiversity and home \r\nto some of the rarest and most unique species that in \r\nturn hold valuable genetic resources. Today, species are \r\ndisappearing at up to 1,000 times the natural \r\nbackground rate of extinction, undermining nature’s \r\nability to provide us with the good services we so \r\ngreatly depend on.  \r\n It is the poor of the world who will suffer the \r\nmost if we do not stop the loss of our biological \r\nresources, since the poor depend disproportionately on \r\nbiodiversity for their day-to-day livelihoods. Continued \r\nbiodiversity loss, including through unsustainable use, \r\nthreatens to increase poverty and undermine \r\ndevelopment. Biodiversity can no longer be seen as an \r\nissue separate from efforts to tackle poverty and \r\nimprove the health, wealth and security of present and \r\nfuture generations. This can happen only if we finally \r\ngive biodiversity the priority it deserves.  \r\n Now more than ever, the Group of 77 and China \r\ncalls for the urgent implementation of the three \r\nobjectives of the United Nations Convention on \r\nBiological Diversity in a mutually supportive manner. \r\nIndeed, the conservation of biological diversity cannot \r\nbe achieved without the sustainable use and fair and \r\nequitable sharing of the benefits arising from genetic \r\nresources. Not only are all three pillars of the \r\nConvention important to the development of \r\ndeveloping countries, but they also provide important \r\ntools in our fight against poverty. To that end, an \r\neffective international framework must be in place to \r\nensure enhanced implementation of the three objectives \r\nof the main multilateral instrument on this matter, the \r\nConvention on Biological Diversity. These objectives \r\nare conservation, the sustainable use, and the fair, \r\nequitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of \r\nbiodiversity.  \r\n We must strengthen global partnerships and \r\ninternational commitment to ensure that owners of \r\nbiodiversity resources and the traditional knowledge \r\nassociated with them, which are mainly the developing \r\ncountries, receive the benefits arising from the use of \r\nthose resources. Furthermore, developing countries \r\nwill not achieve the Millennium Development Goals \r\nwithout addressing, along with the developed \r\ncountries, the international threat to biodiversity, in \r\nparticular the misappropriation of genetic resources \r\nand biopiracy.  \r\n To this end, the adoption of the protocol on \r\naccess and benefit sharing at the next meeting of the \r\nConference of the Parties to the Convention on \r\nBiological Diversity, to be held next month in Nagoya, \r\nJapan, is of strategic importance. The adoption of the \r\nprotocol will be key to the success of the new \r\nbiodiversity strategic plan for 2011-2020 to be adopted \r\nin Nagoya. This new biodiversity vision for 2050 and \r\nA/65/PV.7  \r\n \r\n10-54515 4 \r\n \r\nthe 2020 biodiversity target require the urgent \r\nmobilization of new and additional financial resources.  \r\n The success of the Aichi Nagoya summit will be \r\nthe best gift to this year’s celebration of the \r\nInternational Year of Biodiversity and a good omen for \r\nthe success of the United Nations decade on \r\nbiodiversity. However, the challenges of the continued \r\nloss of biodiversity, compounded by climate change, \r\nrequire the full engagement of all stakeholders, as well \r\nas the active engagement of all Governments without \r\nexception. The Group of 77 and China would like to \r\nreiterate its call on the sole remaining country that has \r\nyet to accede to the United Nations Convention on \r\nBiological Diversity to do so as soon as possible. \r\nIndeed, universal participation in the Convention on \r\nlife on Earth is an idea whose time has indeed come. \r\n The Convention on Biological Diversity will hold \r\nits tenth Conference of the Parties in Nagoya next \r\nOctober. The Group of 77 and China takes this \r\nopportunity to underscore the need for great \r\nmobilization and political will so that we will be able \r\nto adopt the protocol on access and benefit sharing and \r\nensure that the post-2010 targets are able to be met \r\nthrough new, additional and sufficient financial \r\nresources and the transfer of technology to developing \r\ncountries.  \r\n At the Nagoya Conference, parties are expected \r\nto boost the implementation of the Convention. The \r\nsuccess of our ongoing commitment to the cause of \r\nbiodiversity will rest upon ensuring a balanced and \r\neffective outcome in Nagoya that will provide the tools \r\nfor addressing the challenges facing biodiversity. In \r\nthis regard, agreement in two broad areas — the \r\nsuccessful conclusion of negotiations on the protocol \r\non access and benefit sharing, and the successful \r\nconclusion of the discussion on the post-2010 strategic \r\nplan of the Convention and a resource mobilization \r\nstrategy — is key to leading to a successful \r\nimplementation of the Convention. The level of \r\nambition in establishing targets for reducing \r\nbiodiversity loss in this plan should be matched by \r\nequal targets for the means to implement such \r\ncommitments. \r\n The Group of 77 and China is committed to \r\nfinalizing the draft multi-year plan of action for South-\r\nSouth cooperation on biodiversity for development, as \r\nmandated by the ninth Conference of Parties, and calls \r\non all parties to demonstrate commitment and support \r\nfor its adoption at the tenth meeting of the Parties to \r\nthe Convention. In this context, we welcome the \r\nconvening of the First South-South Cooperation Forum \r\non Biodiversity for Development to be held in Nagoya, \r\nJapan, on 17 October 2010. We also express our \r\nappreciation to the Convention secretariat for \r\nestablishing a strategic partnership with the Group of \r\n77 and for its support in elaborating the multi-year plan \r\nof action, which provides a unique opportunity to \r\nenhance the solidarity and global cohesion of the \r\nGroup in support of the new biodiversity strategy.  \r\n More than ever, the establishment of a global \r\nalliance for protecting life on Earth is required. This \r\nunique event offers us a unique opportunity as leaders \r\nof the world to provide leadership and to lead by \r\nexample for the benefit of life on Earth. The Group of \r\n77 and China is fully committed to playing its role and \r\ncalls on its partners, as well as the United Nations \r\nsystem, to support the new biodiversity strategy for the \r\nnext decade so as to ensure that our children will \r\ncontinue to benefit from the vital services provided by \r\nour planet. \r\n Finally, the Group of 77 and China looks forward \r\nto the successful outcome of the Nagoya meeting and \r\nreiterates that the post-2010 strategic plan, along with a \r\nstrategy for resource mobilization and a new \r\ninternational regime on access to genetic resources and \r\nthe fair and equitable sharing of the benefits from their \r\nuse, are indivisible components of an improved global \r\npolicy framework for biodiversity policy that \r\nconserves biodiversity, uses its components \r\nsustainably, and ensures that the benefits from the use \r\nof the genetic resources of our planet are shared \r\nequitably.  \r\n The President (spoke in French): I now give the \r\nfloor to Her Excellency Ms. Izabella Teixeira, Minister \r\nof the Environment of Brazil. \r\n Ms. Teixeira (Brazil): In 2006, Brazil hosted the \r\neighth Conference of the Parties to the Convention on \r\nBiological Diversity. For us, that initiative was steeped \r\nin political and symbolic meaning, given the enormous \r\nresponsibility Brazil has towards biodiversity. As a \r\nmegadiverse country, Brazil is aware of the strategic \r\nvalue of biodiversity and of the attention and urgency \r\nwe should dedicate to it. Most scientists, politicians, \r\nbusiness people and civil society understand the role of \r\nbiodiversity as the basis for sustainability. For no other \r\npurpose did the General Assembly adopt resolution \r\n A/65/PV.7\r\n \r\n5 10-54515 \r\n \r\n62/203, declaring 2010 the International Year of \r\nBiodiversity, and for no other reason do we meet here \r\ntoday.  \r\n This is definitely the time to transform our words \r\nand political discussions into action. We should pave \r\nthe way for a more sustainable society, since what we \r\nhave at present is quite a disturbing picture. We have \r\nbeen unable to reduce the rate or speed of the loss of \r\nbiodiversity, as called for in the 2002 Johannesburg \r\nPlan of Implementation. Not only has there been an \r\nabsence of relevant signs of a reduction in biodiversity \r\nloss, but indicators portray a growing deterioration of \r\nbiodiversity worldwide. \r\n One of the key messages of the 2005 Millennium \r\nEcosystem Assessment was that, over the past century, \r\ncertain economic sectors have benefited from the \r\nconversion of natural ecosystems and the exploitation \r\nof biodiversity. But these gains have been achieved at \r\nthe cost of increasing losses to biodiversity, the \r\ndegradation of ecosystem services, and an increase in \r\nand spread of poverty. We need strong and determined \r\nresponses and political will to change this scenario, in \r\nparticular in the run-up to the United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development 2012. The \r\nconservation and sustainable use of biological \r\nresources are crucial not only to ensuring continued \r\nbenefits to local and indigenous communities, but also \r\nto creating opportunities for sustainable development \r\nand poverty eradication for all. \r\n Brazil is doing its part. According to the latest \r\nedition of Global Biodiversity Outlook, Brazil is one of \r\nthe few countries to have contributed to clearing up \r\nthis picture. Under President Lula’s leadership, Brazil \r\nhas achieved significant results. We have created the \r\ngreatest number of new protected areas in recent years \r\nand have managed to reduce to historical lows \r\ndeforestation rates in the Amazon region. But much \r\nremains to be done. \r\n I should highlight the important outcome we \r\nreached in South Korea for the establishment of the \r\nintergovernmental science-policy platform on \r\nbiodiversity and ecosystem services. By creating \r\nadequate links between science, policymaking and \r\ncapacity-building through the provision of credible and \r\nrelevant information on biodiversity ecosystem \r\nservices, the platform will improve our understanding \r\nof the need for immediate action against the loss of \r\nbiodiversity, as well as of the consequences of inaction.  \r\n The lasting success of our efforts will rest on \r\ndecisions to be taken at the tenth meeting of the \r\nConference of the Parties to the Convention on \r\nBiological Diversity in Nagoya. We have been \r\nnegotiating a protocol on access and benefit sharing \r\nthat will be fundamental to overcoming the \r\nimplementation deficit of the Convention and to \r\ncombating biopiracy. We have been discussing a new \r\nstrategic plan for the period post-2010 and a new \r\nstrategy for resource mobilization. A central part of our \r\nfuture efforts must include support for national agendas \r\nto reach targets on biodiversity, ensuring country \r\nownership and supported by predictable, additional and \r\nsufficient resources and technology. These three \r\nelements — the protocol on access and benefit sharing, \r\nthe strategic plan and the new strategy for resource \r\nmobilization — are part of an indivisible package for \r\nthe tenth meeting of the Conference. They should be \r\nconsidered, discussed and negotiated with the attention \r\nand urgency that the matter deserves. \r\n If there is one reason for discussing the issue of \r\nbiodiversity at a high level, as we are doing here today, \r\nit should be to rescue the spirit of the United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development, which led to \r\nsuch significant results as the adoption of the \r\nConvention on Biological Diversity. I call on all to \r\nrenew that same sentiment of commitment, political \r\nwill, and ethical-moral responsibility for the well-being \r\nof current and future generations.  \r\n We need a deal in Nagoya. The news from \r\nMontreal was a sign that we are quite far from a deal. \r\nSome countries are not fully committed to an \r\nagreement on access and benefit sharing. At this high-\r\nlevel meeting, we should raise the profile of \r\nbiodiversity and galvanize the political will and \r\nengagement of all countries in support of this call for \r\naction. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I now give the \r\nfloor to His Excellency Mr. Norbert Roettgen, Federal \r\nMinister for the Environment, Nature Conservation and \r\nNuclear Safety of Germany. \r\n Mr. Roettgen (Germany): In this International \r\nYear of Biodiversity, the loss of species and habitats is \r\ncontinuing at a dramatic pace. Second by second, \r\nminute by minute, we are destroying the natural \r\nfoundations of our lives. During the time of my speech \r\nalone, the equivalent of 170 football fields will have \r\nbeen deforested. More than 900 tons of fish will have \r\nA/65/PV.7  \r\n \r\n10-54515 6 \r\n \r\nbeen taken from the world’s oceans. One more species \r\nmight even have vanished from our planet forever.  \r\n And we let it happen. We let it happen even \r\nthough we value these plants and animals as part of our \r\nworld, and even though we know that biological \r\ndiversity is vital to feeding humans. Biological \r\ndiversity is the foundation of our very own survival. \r\nEvery day, without a second thought, we use numerous \r\nservices provided by nature and thus by biodiversity — \r\nclean air and water, fertile soils, pollinating insects, \r\nnatural coastal protection, and carbon dioxide storage \r\nin forests, wetlands, soils and the seas. Conserving \r\nbiological diversity is not a luxury; it is a necessary \r\ninsurance and an investment in our future and our \r\nlives.  \r\n The conservation of biological diversity does not \r\nyet receive the same amount of attention as the issue of \r\nclimate change, but attention is a precondition for \r\npolitical action. Conserving biological diversity \r\nworldwide requires committed and long-term action. \r\nAnd it requires cooperation among the international \r\ncommunity.  \r\n At today’s high-level meeting, let us send a signal \r\nand make a global pact for biological diversity. Let us \r\ndo so by recognizing the value of biological diversity \r\nfor human well-being and for the global economy and \r\nby integrating it into our economic policies, \r\ninstruments and accounting; by massively reducing our \r\necological footprint and restructuring production, trade \r\nand consumption; by making greater use of biological \r\ndiversity as a basis for sustainable innovations, and \r\nensuring equitable sharing of the benefits resulting \r\nfrom the use of genetic resources; by strengthening the \r\nglobal network of protected areas, especially those at \r\nsea, to give nature the space to retreat; by improving \r\nthe knowledge of biological diversity and making it \r\navailable to political decision-makers in a suitable \r\nform; and, not least, by strengthening the financial \r\nfoundations for tackling these challenges at the \r\nnational and international levels. \r\n In the framework of our presidency of the ninth \r\nmeeting of the Conference of the Parties to the \r\nConvention on Biological Diversity, we have striven \r\ntogether with all our partners actively to promote this \r\nprocess. Most recently in Geneva, in an unprecedented \r\nmeeting with the previous and future presidencies of \r\nthe Conference of the Parties, we adopted a call for \r\naction addressed to the participants here today. In the \r\nspirit of that call for action, let us lay the foundations \r\nhere in New York and at the upcoming tenth meeting \r\nConference of the Parties to halt the loss of biological \r\ndiversity in the coming decade. Let us follow the path \r\nof biodiversity — a path lined with forests and oceans \r\nand the most diverse and vibrant life forms our planet \r\nhas to offer for our joy and for our children’s survival. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I now give the \r\nfloor to His Excellency Mr. Seiji Maehara, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of Japan. \r\n Mr. Maehara (Japan) (spoke in Japanese; \r\nEnglish interpretation provided by the delegation): On \r\nthe occasion of this important meeting today, I express \r\nmy heartfelt appreciation to you, Sir, for your \r\nleadership.  \r\n At present many species on Earth, which has \r\nsustained life for more than four billion years, are \r\ndying out and biodiversity is being lost at an \r\nunprecedented rate. Currently, swathes of forest \r\nequivalent to one-third of the area of Japan are \r\nvanishing from Earth every year. If the destruction of \r\nthe ecosystem continues at this pace, in the near future \r\nmankind could lose most of nature’s bounty for all \r\neternity. If that should happen, we will not be able to \r\npass on the blessings of nature to future generations. \r\nAs this year marks the International Year of \r\nBiodiversity, we should understand that the loss of \r\nbiodiversity has been caused by none other than human \r\nactivities. We now need to be aware that we must take \r\nnew action and change our behaviour so as to halt this \r\nloss. \r\n In October, Japan will host the tenth meeting of \r\nthe Conference of the Parties to the Convention on \r\nBiological Diversity in Nagoya city, Aichi prefecture, \r\naimed at achieving a global agreement on launching \r\nnew actions. One of the main objectives of the \r\nConference is to set global targets for 2020 and 2050 \r\nas common guidelines for formulating national \r\nstrategies. It is important that we paint a clear picture \r\nof the concerted action to be taken over the next 10 \r\nyears so that coming generations will be able to enjoy \r\nthe blessings of nature.  \r\n At the tenth meeting of the Conference, we will \r\nalso negotiate with a view to reaching agreement on a \r\nnew international regime in the area of access and \r\nbenefit sharing as related to genetic resources, as well \r\nas on international rules with regard to living modified \r\norganisms. In particular, negotiations on access and \r\n A/65/PV.7\r\n \r\n7 10-54515 \r\n \r\nbenefit sharing could be affected by the differing \r\ninterests of the users and suppliers of genetic \r\nresources. However, if the parties can agree on a new \r\nregime, it could be an epoch-making agreement to \r\nfacilitate the flow of funds for habitat conservation, \r\nand thus contribute to the benefit of the entire planet. \r\nJapan will do its utmost as Chair to ensure that \r\nagreements are reached on these issues at the meeting, \r\nand we request the support of all parties concerned. \r\n Japan will contribute to global efforts, acting on \r\nits own innovative initiative. First, Japan proposes the \r\nadoption of a resolution on a United Nations decade of \r\nbiodiversity at this session of the General Assembly. \r\nThe resolution would call for the promotion of \r\nconcerted action over the next 10 years, not only \r\nwithin the framework of the Convention, but also \r\nthroughout the entire United Nations system. Japan \r\nwill also strive for the adoption at this session of a \r\nresolution on the intergovernmental science-policy \r\nplatform on biodiversity and ecosystem services. Once \r\nestablished, the platform is expected to provide a \r\nscientific basis for biodiversity conservation policies \r\nand to lead to a broad understanding of the importance \r\nof such policies. \r\n Japan will also lead international efforts in \r\npromoting conservation and the sustainable use of the \r\nnatural environment in regions that have been created \r\nthrough such human activities as agriculture, forestry \r\nand fisheries. Japan will propose this approach, which \r\nwe refer to as the Satoyama initiative, at the tenth \r\nmeeting of the Conference of the Parties to the \r\nConvention on Biological Diversity, with a view to \r\nenabling the experiences and practices developed in \r\ndifferent regions of the world to be shared \r\ninternationally. Japan will put to good use its expertise \r\nand experience in supporting other countries.  \r\n In addition, Japan intends to propose assistance \r\nmeasures to support developing countries in the steady \r\nformulation and implementation of national strategies, \r\nif a global common target is agreed upon at meeting of \r\nthe Conference. In consultation with other countries, \r\nJapan will consider appropriate measures that will \r\nexploit its knowledge and technologies. \r\n Japan has long valued living in harmony with \r\nnature through the ingenious utilization of nature’s \r\nabundant gifts in our daily lives and activities. As the \r\nEarth and humankind are in crisis caused by the loss of \r\nbiodiversity, we are urged to address the root cause by \r\nmaking our lifestyles and behaviour more harmonious \r\nwith nature. By taking advantage of our experience in \r\nliving with nature, Japan is committed to being at the \r\nforefront of the global action to be initiated at the \r\nConference of the Parties to the Convention on \r\nBiological Diversity. I looking forward to seeing all \r\npresent here again and to engaging in discussions with \r\nthem at that meeting, which will be held under the \r\ntheme “Living in harmony with nature”.  \r\n The President (spoke in French): I now give the \r\nfloor to His Excellency José Manuel Barroso, President \r\nof the European Commission, who will speak on behalf \r\nof the European Union. \r\n Mr. Barroso (European Union): On behalf of the \r\nEuropean Union, I have the honour to speak today in \r\nthis meeting, which is a very important, unique and \r\nwelcome opportunity to celebrate the International \r\nYear of Biodiversity. It is also perhaps one of the last \r\nopportunities to exchange views before the Nagoya \r\nmeeting, at which important decisions will be taken to \r\nset the course of global biodiversity policy and action \r\nfor the next decade. \r\n It is significant that our meeting today should \r\ncoincide with the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs) summit. Biodiversity and the ecosystem \r\nservices it provides cut across many of the MDGs, and \r\nnot just one. Our ability to end poverty and hunger and \r\nimprove child and maternal health depends on the \r\nlong-term availability of the fresh water, food, \r\nmedicine and raw materials that nature provides. This \r\ncomprehensive and holistic approach makes it also \r\nclear that the €1-billion MDG initiative I announced \r\nhere two days ago can also benefit biodiversity. It is \r\nalso clear that we will not be able to mitigate climate \r\nchange or adapt to its impacts, or to prevent \r\ndesertification and land degradation, if we do not \r\nprotect our ecosystems and biodiversity. And yet, \r\ndespite these interlinkages, we have collectively failed \r\nto reach our 2010 biodiversity target. Instead, we \r\ncontinue to lose biodiversity worldwide at an \r\nunprecedented rate. \r\n We are standing at a crossroads. Either we take \r\nconcerted action to reverse biodiversity loss as soon as \r\npossible, or we compromise our own future and that of \r\ngenerations not yet born. Nagoya is our chance to turn \r\nthe situation around. It is our chance to make decisions \r\nthat will strengthen the implementation of the \r\nConvention’s three key objectives.  \r\nA/65/PV.7  \r\n \r\n10-54515 8 \r\n \r\n First, it is important that we adopt a new and \r\neffective strategic plan that encourages collective \r\naction and is supported by all those who use \r\nbiodiversity and whose activities have an impact on it. \r\nThis plan must be sufficiently ambitious to force all \r\nparties to the Convention to raise their game, to tackle \r\nthe key drivers of biodiversity loss, and to prevent \r\necological tipping points from being reached. \r\n Secondly, it is important that we finally conclude \r\nnegotiations on the protocol on access and benefit \r\nsharing, as we have pledged to do on several occasions. \r\nThe protocol should ensure transparency, legal \r\ncertainty and predictability for those seeking access to \r\ngenetic resources, as well as the fair and equitable \r\nsharing of the benefits derived from them. I am \r\nreassured by the spirit of collaboration and partnership \r\nexhibited during the negotiations in Montreal in recent \r\ndays. However, hard work is still ahead of us if we are \r\nto find answers to the unresolved questions. Agreeing \r\non a meaningful protocol will require the full political \r\ncommitment of all parties and the willingness to \r\ncompromise. \r\n Thirdly, it is important that we agree on how best \r\nto build capacity and mobilize resources — scientific, \r\ntechnological, human and financial — to enable all \r\nparties to implement their commitments under the \r\nConvention. The European Union has committed, as \r\npart of its 2020 biodiversity target, to step up its \r\ncontribution to averting global biodiversity loss. From \r\n2002 to 2008, we provided more than $1 billion \r\nannually for global biodiversity. In addition, European \r\nUnion member States contributed significantly to the \r\nrecent replenishment of the Global Environment \r\nFacility, of which $1.2 billion is earmarked for \r\nbiodiversity. That represents a 28 per cent increase \r\ncompared to the last replenishment.  \r\n Of course, there are other ways beyond new and \r\nadditional public finance to further enhance the \r\nimplementation of our commitments under the  \r\n \r\nConvention. We need to explore all options, including \r\nthe reform, elimination and reorientation of subsidies \r\nharmful to biodiversity, and private funding such as \r\npayments for ecosystem services and other market-\r\nbased instruments. The European Union is prepared to \r\nwork together with all parties to improve and ensure \r\nlong-term sustainable support for implementation. But \r\nit is also our view that this responsibility should be \r\nshared by all parties. Indeed, increased efforts are \r\nneeded on the part of all of us to ensure that \r\nbiodiversity objectives are given sufficient priority in \r\nGovernment plans and programmes.  \r\n The messages in the international study on the \r\neconomics of ecosystems and biodiversity are clear. \r\nValuing biodiversity and ecosystem services should \r\ncome naturally. After all, investing in biodiversity is \r\nnot a luxury; it is a sound investment that can bring \r\nmultiple benefits. \r\n Let me conclude by saying that the European \r\nUnion welcomes the decision reached in the Republic \r\nof Korea last June on the need to establish an \r\nintergovernmental science-policy platform on \r\nbiodiversity and ecosystem services. We look forward \r\nto a positive decision by the General Assembly before \r\nthe end of the year on establishing this important \r\nplatform in 2011. \r\n The President (spoke in French): We have heard \r\nthe last speaker for this meeting.  \r\n Before adjourning this meeting, I remind \r\nrepresentatives that the thematic panel “The way \r\nforward in achieving the three objectives of the \r\nConvention on Biological Diversity and the \r\ninternationally agreed biodiversity goals and targets” \r\nwill take place, immediately following this plenary \r\nmeeting, in Conference Room 2 of the North Lawn \r\nBuilding. \r\n I wish all participants a most productive panel \r\ndiscussion. \r\n The meeting rose at 10 a.m. \r\n"
