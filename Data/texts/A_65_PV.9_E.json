(President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session)\r\nCo-Chair: Mr. Joseph Deiss . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session) \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 3.25 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nHigh-level Plenary Meeting on the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals \r\n \r\nAgenda items 13 and 115 (continued) \r\n \r\nIntegrated and coordinated implementation of and \r\nfollow-up to the outcomes of the major United \r\nNations conferences and summits in the economic, \r\nsocial and related fields \r\n \r\nFollow-up to the outcome of the Millennium Summit \r\n \r\n  Draft resolution (A/65/L.1) \r\n \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Treki) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nThe General Assembly will now hear an address by His \r\nExcellency Mr. Alan García Pérez, President of the \r\nRepublic of Peru. \r\n President García Pérez (spoke in Spanish): Our \r\ncountry, Peru, is proud to appear before this Assembly \r\nto share the important advances and achievements we \r\nhave made towards the Goals established 10 years ago \r\nin the Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2). They \r\nhave been sustainable advances, attained within a \r\ndemocratic system, a system that strengthens \r\ninstitutions in the face of political self-interest and that \r\nrecognizes the strength of the global economy, seizing \r\nits opportunities instead of opposing it, and engaging \r\nwith the world rather than trusting in insular \r\ndevelopment supported by unsustainable subsidies. \r\n The United Nations has thus performed the role \r\nof planner and organizer of goals, bringing order to the \r\nsocial work done by our Governments. That is why we \r\nmust congratulate it and encourage it to continue in \r\nthat work and in publicly monitoring its performance \r\nbefore our public opinion and before our peoples. \r\n In Peru, the noble Goals set forth by the United \r\nNations have been incorporated as priorities into the \r\nnational agenda. They have guided various specific \r\npublic policies and focused social programmes — such \r\nas “Together”, our direct monetary support programme \r\nfor the poorest; “Building Peru”, our programme to \r\nprovide jobs through social works; our “Water for All” \r\nand rural electrification programmes; and our “Own \r\nRoof” programme — in which representatives of the \r\nState and society as a whole have participated. Those \r\nwere programmes established in order to ensure that \r\nthe benefits of economic growth are distributed among \r\nall Peruvians. \r\n But the best anti-poverty programme has been \r\nour creation of 2.1 million jobs in four years and the \r\ninvestment of the largest part of the State’s income in \r\ninfrastructure work. We have undertaken 130,000 \r\ninfrastructure projects so far, all to benefit the poor. \r\nThese include road, electric light and potable water \r\nprojects, all productive works, as opposed to opting for \r\nthe easy but unsustainable approach of current \r\nexpenditures, public salaries and subsidies. \r\n It is, of course, also our responsibility to speak of \r\npending challenges and to reaffirm our commitment \r\nA/65/PV.9  \r\n \r\n10-54527 2 \r\n \r\nand desire to continue to make progress in achieving \r\ngoals that can overcome social gaps. We must also \r\npromote new and more ambitious targets that we can \r\nalso achieve by 2015.  \r\n In recent years, we have proven that our societies \r\nand Governments can organize themselves around \r\nthose social goals. We can make use of the years \r\nremaining until 2015 to incorporate new and more \r\nambitious goals, such as early detection of cancer, the \r\nreduction of transportation accidents that result in \r\nmillions of victims every year around the world, and \r\nthe reduction of per capita expenditure on weapons and \r\nthe military. \r\n Few countries can boast of having grown, on \r\naverage, 6.5 per cent in the last five years, even in an \r\nera of crisis, let alone that that growth has taken place \r\nin the social sphere, in keeping with our country’s \r\nnational interest in focusing on promoting more jobs \r\nand reducing poverty. In 2009, the worst year of the \r\ncrisis, Peru’s economic activity grew by 1 per cent and \r\nemployment by 2 per cent, and poverty was also \r\nreduced by 2 per cent. For this year, we hope for 8 per \r\ncent growth in the economy and infrastructure, which \r\nwill contribute to reducing poverty and destitution.  \r\n Peru has made, and continues to make, progress, \r\ndespite contractions due to difficulties in the developed \r\neconomies and the cutbacks in international \r\ndevelopment assistance. We continue to make progress \r\nbecause of our investments in infrastructure and our \r\npublic anti-poverty policies, organized around the \r\nMillennium Goals. \r\n In terms of the Goal of eradicating extreme \r\npoverty and hunger, Peru has achieved a rate of \r\ncompliance of 99 per cent, as recognized in the United \r\nNations report on compliance with the Goals. It has \r\nachieved the Target of reducing by half the percentage \r\nof individuals living under the extreme poverty line. In \r\n2003, 24 per cent of the population was in that group. \r\nBy 2008, that figure had gone down to 12.6 per cent, \r\nand by 2009 to 11.5 per cent. In 2001, our country had \r\nan overall poverty rate of 54.4 per cent; in 2004, it was \r\nstill at 48 per cent.  \r\n Today, thanks to the strength of the national \r\neconomy, that figure has fallen to 34 per cent, which \r\nmeans that there has been a 14 per cent reduction in \r\nfive years. It also means that more than 3.5 million \r\nPeruvians have emerged from poverty. The United \r\nNations report certifies that Peru has achieved 78 per \r\ncent of its objectives. We trust that by 2011 we will \r\nachieve our goal of 30 per cent, and our efforts will \r\ncontinue. When we celebrate the bicentenary of our \r\nindependence in 2021, we hope to have achieved the \r\ngoal of lowering the poverty rate to less than 10 per \r\ncent of our country’s population. \r\n In the past four years, the public sector has \r\ninvested $24 billion in more than 130,000 projects, \r\ntripling public investment in infrastructure, schools, \r\nhealth centres, roads linking remote towns and the \r\nbasic services of potable water and electricity for the \r\npoorest. But that public investment has been supported \r\nand augmented through private investment of more \r\nthan $74 billion. More than 2 million jobs have been \r\ncreated, largely in the formal economy.   \r\n In terms of access to water and sanitation \r\nservices, I can say that in the last five years the public \r\nsector in Peru has benefited 4 million Peruvians who \r\npreviously had little or no potable water. It has also \r\nbuilt sewers for 3 million. If we continue at the same \r\npace, in the next 10 years we will be able to close the \r\ngap between those who have potable water and those \r\nwho do not. \r\n Furthermore, through our “Light for All” \r\nprogramme, we have benefited 3 million Peruvians in \r\nmore than 7,000 towns that did not have electricity \r\nbefore, and we are continuing to work on adding \r\nanother 5,000 towns. Next year, 12,000 towns will be \r\nconnected to electrical power and 80 per cent of homes \r\nin Peru will have electricity.  \r\n Thus with water and light, more schools and \r\nmore electrical and highway infrastructure projects, we \r\nwill have built a more equitable country and will have \r\nensured more rights for all. Only in this way will more \r\nPeruvians become part of the democratic life of Peru. \r\n With regard to universal primary education, I can \r\nsay that in Peru that Goal has largely been achieved. In \r\nthe last 10 years, enrolment in primary schools grew \r\nfrom 90 to 97.6 per cent, and the net rate of attendance \r\nwent from 90 to 94 per cent. We are now thinking of \r\nestablishing compulsory universal secondary \r\neducation, with direct support for the poorest families.  \r\n We have also reduced illiteracy to 5 per cent of \r\nthe population. We began with 14 per cent of Peruvians \r\nbeing illiterate. After adding 1.4 million citizens to the \r\nranks of the literate, we believe that by next year the \r\nilliteracy rate will have dropped to below 4 per cent, \r\n A/65/PV.9\r\n \r\n3 10-54527 \r\n \r\nand Peru will thus be a country free of illiteracy by \r\n2011. \r\n With regard to promoting gender equality and the \r\nempowerment of women, it is worth highlighting the \r\ngreater participation of women in education. I am \r\nproud to say that women’s participation is now 10 per \r\ncent greater than that of men in secondary and higher \r\neducation. Women’s participation in the labour market \r\nand in the political life of the country has also \r\nincreased, especially in the legislative branch, where \r\nthe proportion of seats occupied by women in Congress \r\nwent from 14 per cent to 29 per cent today.  \r\n Concerning Goals 4, 5 and 6 — to reduce \r\nmortality for children under five, to improve maternal \r\nhealth, and to fight AIDS, malaria and other \r\ndiseases — what we have achieved so far is positive, \r\nalthough not sufficient.  \r\n Chronic infant malnutrition was reduced from \r\n25.4 per cent to 18.3 per cent in the last five years, and \r\nthe proportion of children with weight deficiencies or \r\ngeneral malnutrition dropped from 7.1 per cent to \r\n4.2 per cent in 2009. Infant mortality — those under \r\none year of age — was reduced from 33 per thousand \r\nin 2003 to 18 per thousand in 2008. Orderly \r\nprogrammes have been instituted to eliminate parasites, \r\nreplace wood-burning kitchens with modern kitchens \r\nand replace latrines in order to reduce gastrointestinal \r\ninfections and bronchopulmonary illnesses, which are \r\nbehind malnutrition in children. Mortality among \r\nchildren under five years of age has also been reduced, \r\nfrom 92 cases per every thousand born in 1990 to \r\n31 per thousand in 2008. That means that we have \r\nachieved the Goal set for 2015.  \r\n Maternal mortality dropped from 265 cases per \r\n100,000 births in the base year 1990 to 103 cases \r\ntoday, which means that the Goal set has been \r\nachieved. The percentage of births assisted by \r\nspecialized health personnel has increased from 59 per \r\ncent in 2000 to 82 per cent in 2009.  \r\n Expanding the vaccination campaigns for \r\nchildren and adults has enabled us, according to the \r\nWorld Health Organization, to eradicate measles and \r\nrubella and reduce yellow fever and hepatitis B, thus \r\nimproving the life expectancy of the population.  \r\n The morbidity rates for malaria and tuberculosis \r\nhave also been reduced, but not sufficiently. We now \r\nhave cases that are resistant to an array of drugs, so the \r\nGovernment will have to expend greater efforts in that \r\narea. \r\n We have started a new system of compulsory \r\nuniversal health insurance, which includes all service \r\nproviders in order to provide insurance coverage for \r\n90 per cent of illnesses, medicine and surgery. \r\nCoverage includes various types of cancers and other \r\ndiseases that were previously not covered. In these five \r\nyears, we have been able to provide cataract surgery \r\nfree of cost for 120,000 cases, and early detection of \r\nthe more frequent cancers has been doubled.  \r\n Those achievements have been made possible by \r\nthe investments of the State and the public sector. \r\nHowever, we must recognize the important role played \r\nby international cooperation of institutions and \r\ncountries, which has been essential. It has allowed us \r\nto reach the most remote areas with social projects in \r\norder achieve the Millennium Goals.  \r\n Today, we propose that the Assembly make use of \r\nthe lessons learned and of what has already been \r\nachieved to set for ourselves bigger and more \r\nambitious objectives for 2015: the early detection of \r\nand cure for intrauterine, prostate and gastrointestinal \r\ncancer, which would allow us to save three million \r\nlives in the next four years; the eradication of cataracts \r\nthrough surgery at a very low cost, which would allow \r\nthe elderly to get their sight back in the next four years; \r\nand the reduction of transit accidents in urban areas, \r\nwhich is the easiest goal because it is a matter of \r\nregulations, which would allow us to save from death \r\nand disability two of every 6,000 people in the next \r\nfour years.  \r\n We know that there are still many concerns and \r\nchallenges that demand greater social investment, with \r\nmore social programmes involving monetary transfers. \r\nWe can succeed in that, fulfilling the Millennium \r\nGoals, but above all fulfilling the great goals of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and of the United Nations: to live in \r\npeace and defeat the build-up of arms — the worst \r\nenemy of the Millennium Goals and the worst scourge \r\nof the poor — ensuring that our countries free \r\nthemselves from the ominous obligation to buy \r\nweapons and from the tragedy of enormous military \r\nexpenditures, which prevent the development of our \r\ncountries. \r\n Living in peace, reducing the arms build-up and \r\nensuring that people who produce the weapons stop \r\nproducing them — the time has come to make these \r\nA/65/PV.9  \r\n \r\n10-54527 4 \r\n \r\nconsiderations a supreme goal of our peoples in this \r\nMillennium. Weapons only bring confrontation, \r\nscourges and misery to our peoples.  \r\n We come before the world to say that we have \r\nmade a great deal of progress, but much remains to be \r\ndone. We will continue to do this work within \r\ndemocracy, realism and freedom. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Treki) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nThe General Assembly will now hear an address by the \r\nChair of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Haris Silajdžić. \r\n Mr. Silajdžić: It is an honour to participate in \r\nthis High-level Meeting on the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). Allow me to express my \r\ngratitude to Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki for having ably \r\npresided over the General Assembly during the past \r\nyear and to congratulate Mr. Joseph Deiss on being \r\nelected President of the Assembly at its sixty-fifth \r\nsession. \r\n Ten years ago, the Governments of the world \r\nagreed to ensure a new vision in order to change \r\nreality, creating a crucial platform for global \r\ncooperation in the twenty-first century. At that historic \r\nmoment, by the adoption of the Millennium \r\nDeclaration (resolution 55/2), the key challenges that \r\nhumanity faced were set out and concrete measures \r\nwere defined for assessing progress in attaining the \r\ninterrelated goals and tasks associated with \r\ndevelopment, governance, peace, security and human \r\nrights. \r\n Our gathering here today presents an opportunity \r\nto answer two important questions. The first is: “What \r\nis the status of the progress made toward fulfilling the \r\ncommitments we assumed at the Millennium Summit?” \r\nAnd the second is: “Can we be satisfied with what we \r\nhave achieved?” \r\n To be sure, the results achieved so far are not to \r\nbe underestimated, but they are still far from \r\nsatisfactory. Moreover, the results achieved are being \r\ncompromised by the new challenges and problems we \r\nare facing: economic crises, conflicts, the effects of \r\nclimate change and other global issues. \r\n Bosnia and Herzegovina is fully committed to the \r\nattainment of the Millennium Development Goals. As a \r\ncountry that recently suffered major devastation from \r\nwar and thereafter received significant international \r\nsupport for reconstruction, Bosnia and Herzegovina \r\nnow invests in efforts to achieve sustainability and to \r\nfully assume its own responsibilities. \r\n In order to overcome current problems and create \r\nconditions for improving social circumstances, various \r\nactivities are being implemented and planned in Bosnia \r\nand Herzegovina. The Bosnia and Herzegovina \r\nNational Human Development Report on the \r\nMillennium Development Goals included quantitative \r\nestimates on MDG achievement by 2015. We also \r\nestablished a framework for defining long-term \r\nstrategic priorities, as well as a framework for \r\nharmonizing the Millennium Development Goals with \r\nthe social programmes of the European Union. Our \r\nNational Human Development Report focuses on MDG \r\npriorities of high importance for Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina, especially poverty reduction, \r\ndevelopment humanization and development support \r\nenhancement. \r\n In 2003, Bosnia and Herzegovina incorporated \r\nMDG indicators into its first Medium-Term \r\nDevelopment Strategy 2004-2007. The achievement of \r\nthe MDGs in Bosnia and Herzegovina thus became a \r\nvital part of the development strategy and its \r\nimplementation. The final report on the implementation \r\nof the measures planned in the action plans indicates \r\nthat the progress in the achievement of MDGs was \r\nmade in that medium-term period. \r\n In this regard, we have developed two strategic \r\ndocuments: the Bosnia and Herzegovina 2010-2013 \r\nDevelopment Strategy and the Bosnia and Herzegovina \r\nSocial Inclusion Strategy. These documents have now \r\nbeen finalized and are to be adopted. The purpose of \r\nthe two strategies is to provide for a more stable, \r\nefficient and competitive economy; to reduce poverty; \r\nand to achieve social inclusion in Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina as well as integration into the European \r\nUnion. \r\n Both strategies have been drafted with the full \r\nparticipation of all levels of Government and of the \r\ncivil society sector. The goals and priorities of the \r\nstrategies are in line with the MDGs. The \r\nimplementation of these strategies will be of great \r\nimportance for our future progress towards achieving \r\nthe MDGs. \r\n The Bosnia and Herzegovina 2010-2014 \r\nEmployment Strategy is currently in the consideration \r\nof public comments phase. We have also adopted the \r\nDecent Work Country Programme 2008-2010 \r\n A/65/PV.9\r\n \r\n5 10-54527 \r\n \r\ndocument, which defines a set of policies targeted at \r\nmitigating problems in the field of employment. \r\n With regard to solving social issues related to \r\npossible consequences of the energy sector reforms, \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina adopted the Social Action \r\nPlan on the Memorandum of Understanding on Social \r\nIssues in the Context of the Energy Community. The \r\ngoal of this Plan is to ensure the protection of our most \r\nvulnerable citizens in the event of increases in the price \r\nof electric power and to provide adequate measures for \r\nthe protection and care of a possible surplus of \r\nemployees in this sector. \r\n In addition to these measures, the Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina disability policy created basic conditions \r\nfor creating solutions aimed at ensuring a higher level \r\nof social inclusion for this especially vulnerable group \r\nand enabling it to gain access, among other things, to \r\nthe labour market. \r\n The Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina \r\nadopted the decision on the ratification of the \r\nConvention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, \r\nwhile the State Ministry of Human Rights and \r\nRefugees is working on establishing a council for \r\npersons with disabilities. \r\n A project aimed at strengthening the system of \r\nchildren’s social protection and social inclusion is \r\ncurrently being implemented in Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina. It aims to create a model of integrated \r\nchild social protection through multisectoral \r\ncooperation. With the support of Save the Children \r\nUK, we are also currently implementing a project on \r\nthe standardization of services in the field of child \r\nprotection. These two projects will greatly contribute \r\nto harmonizing regulations and improving practice in \r\nthe field of social and child protection. \r\n A war of aggression was waged against Bosnia \r\nand Herzegovina from 1992 to 1995, resulting in \r\ngenocide and mass ethnic cleansing and destruction. \r\nOnly a fraction of the refugees and displaced persons \r\nwho were forcibly expelled from their homes have \r\nreturned, and they feel that their basic rights are still \r\nbeing violated. That remains a huge and difficult \r\nchallenge that must be addressed. \r\n On the basis of a series of international \r\nconventions and declarations, of the Law on the \r\nProtection of the Rights of Persons Belonging to \r\nNational Minorities, adopted in 2003 at the State level, \r\nand of the document on the Decade of Roma Inclusion \r\n2005-2015, Bosnia and Herzegovina developed an \r\nAction Plan on the Educational Needs of the Roma, \r\nwho represent the biggest national minority in Bosnia \r\nand Herzegovina. However, for various reasons, the \r\nresults are not satisfactory, and much still remains to be \r\ndone, particularly in the areas of education and \r\nemployment of Roma. \r\n The Millennium Development Goals reflect the \r\nessence of all the activities to which the United \r\nNations is committed. It is, therefore, vital for Bosnia \r\nand Herzegovina to maintain the current positive trend \r\nby including these Goals in our policies and strategies. \r\nWe are fully determined to continue working with our \r\npartners in the international community in order to \r\nstrengthen local self-responsibility and stimulate long-\r\nterm development on the path to full membership in \r\nthe European Union. \r\n Bosnia and Herzegovina is a country rich in \r\nhuman and natural resources, especially in water, \r\nagricultural resources and renewable energy. We have \r\nnot yet been able to fully realize our country’s potential \r\nbecause our dysfunctional ethnoterritorial arrangements \r\nhinder our efforts and prevent us from progressing at \r\nthe desired pace. In addition, we are currently \r\nwitnessing an escalation of open calls for secession of \r\none part of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which has a \r\ndestabilizing effect on the entire region. In order to be \r\nable to fully utilize our potential, Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina needs to carry out constitutional reforms \r\nthat will create a single economic space and make our \r\nGovernment functional and rational, so that it can meet \r\nthe needs of our citizens. The support of the \r\ninternational community in this reform process is \r\nessential. \r\n In conclusion, in order to make real progress, it is \r\nnecessary to improve the quality of support and \r\ncoordination among donors, including both financial \r\nand technical support, to ensure full support by United \r\nNations organizations and to strengthen partnerships \r\namong the public and private sectors and civil society. \r\nIf these things are done, I am hopeful that we can \r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Treki) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nThe Assembly will now hear an address by His \r\nExcellency Mr. Batbold Sukhbaatar, Prime Minister of \r\nMongolia. \r\nA/65/PV.9  \r\n \r\n10-54527 6 \r\n \r\n Mr. Sukhbaatar: Over the past three days we \r\nhave discussed what has been achieved and what needs \r\nto be done to bridge the gaps to ensure a full and \r\ntimely achievement of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs). Several messages, in my view, came \r\nthrough loud and clear in our discussion. With \r\nadequate resources, renewed commitment and \r\nintensified collective action, the MDGs can and must \r\nbe achieved. It is encouraging that this shared \r\nconclusion represents the main thrust of the draft \r\noutcome document entitled “Keeping the promise: \r\nunited to achieve the Millennium Development Goals” \r\n(A/65/L.1), to be adopted shortly by this Summit. My \r\nGovernment aligns itself fully with this document and \r\nstands ready to do its part. \r\n It goes without saying that our journey ahead will \r\nnot be smooth or easy. The world has already been \r\ngrappling with multiple and interrelated crises, \r\nincluding the financial and economic crisis, volatile \r\nenergy and food prices and ongoing concerns over food \r\nsecurity, as well as the increasing challenges posed by \r\nclimate change. Their combined effects have reversed \r\nhard-earned development gains, thus heightening \r\nvulnerabilities and inequalities in many developing \r\ncountries. \r\n To withstand these and other emerging challenges \r\nrequires an effective and enhanced global partnership \r\nfor development that recognizes national ownership \r\nand leadership, a partnership that delivers on \r\ncommitments already made, including those made at \r\nMonterrey and Doha, a partnership that takes into \r\naccount the special needs of and challenges faced by \r\nvulnerable countries, including landlocked developing \r\ncountries. In addition, concerted efforts in other areas \r\nof Goal 8 ought to be vigorously pursued at the \r\ninternational level, including further reform of the \r\ninternational financial institutions, early conclusion of \r\nthe Doha Round with a comprehensive and \r\ndevelopment-oriented outcome, strengthened regional \r\nintegration and trade and sustainable debt-relief \r\nmeasures for developing countries, especially at times \r\nof multiple crises. \r\n As the past decade of MDG implementation \r\nefforts around the world seems to reveal, sustained \r\neconomic growth per se is not sufficient. It must also \r\nenable everyone, in particular the poor, to participate in \r\nand benefit from economic opportunities and must lead \r\nto job creation and be complemented by effective \r\nsocial policy. Mongolia, for one, is endeavouring to \r\nimplement such a policy with a view to ensuring full \r\nimplementation of its MDGs. \r\n Recently my Government concluded, via its third \r\nnational report on MDGs, a thorough analysis of our \r\nprogress and set its priorities for the next five years \r\nand beyond. The report found that 66 per cent of our \r\nMDGs are on track. I am pleased to note that Mongolia \r\nsucceeded early in achieving such targets as the ratio of \r\ngirls to boys in secondary schools, the percentage of \r\nchildren covered by basic immunizations and the \r\nreduction of infant and under-five mortality rates. The \r\noverall progress we have made is the result of \r\nmainstreaming MDGs into our long-term development \r\npolicy document and budgetary framework, and \r\nestablishing a single government agency responsible \r\nfor coordinating the implementation of MDGs and \r\ncreating a broad database for their assessment. \r\n Nonetheless, the report also sends a warning \r\nsignal that the achievement of other targets is slow or \r\nregressing. The most challenging among these are \r\npoverty reduction, gender equality and environmental \r\nsustainability. To effectively address these challenges \r\nand ensure that economic growth benefits every one of \r\nMongolia’s citizens, my Government is taking a host of \r\npolicy measures. Let me cite here some of the most \r\npertinent ones. \r\n Boosting productive employment, especially \r\namong youth, through supporting job creation in \r\nlabour-intensive industries is a high priority. There are \r\na number of industries such as mining and road \r\nconstruction where the labour market has potential \r\nabsorptive capacity for young people with a set of \r\ntechnical skills. Last month, my Government took an \r\nimportant decision to channel more investment, \r\nstarting this fall, into vocational schools to provide \r\ntraining for thousands of rural young people to prepare \r\nthem for jobs in these industries. \r\n In promoting the equitable distribution of income \r\nand opportunities to more effectively reach those in \r\nneed, my Government will pay special attention to \r\nimproving the targeting of government interventions \r\naimed at strengthening health systems, providing better \r\neducational opportunities, generating employment, \r\nsupporting nutrition and enhancing social protection, \r\nincluding through conditional cash transfers. \r\n Investment in rural development is crucial for \r\nsustaining the livelihood of some 40 per cent of the \r\npopulation that lives off nomadic livestock-breeding, a \r\n A/65/PV.9\r\n \r\n7 10-54527 \r\n \r\nhighly climate- and weather-sensitive activity. Just this \r\npast winter, harsh weather constituted a natural disaster \r\nthat exacted a heavy toll on thousands of herders, \r\nleaving them without sources of income. This disaster \r\nhas critically exposed the country’s economic and \r\necological vulnerability and has directly affected the \r\nimplementation of the MDGs. \r\n Financing these policies will be a formidable \r\ntask. My Government will continue working with our \r\ndevelopment partners and seeking their assistance, \r\nespecially to offset our vulnerability to external shocks \r\nand the disadvantages of our landlocked location. \r\nDomestic resource mobilization will, however, be \r\ncrucial. We therefore set up a human development \r\nfund, whereby revenues and royalties from the mining \r\nindustry will be pooled to support health, education \r\nand other social services, in addition to our efforts to \r\npromote economic diversification. The recently passed \r\nfiscal stability law is another tool that we will use to \r\nmanage the revenue inflows from our mining wealth in \r\na transparent and responsible way to mobilize \r\nresources for combating poverty. \r\n Serious problems of land degradation, especially \r\ndesertification and overgrazing, deforestation and \r\nillegal logging, water scarcity, loss of biodiversity and \r\nurban air pollution are causes for concern. The impact \r\nof climate change on land conditions in Mongolia is \r\nunmistakable. Desertification has affected more than \r\n70 per cent of our land. Water scarcity is a growing \r\nproblem and, when coupled with natural disasters, it \r\ndirectly threatens the human security of those affected. \r\nAs a result of our firm commitment to combating the \r\nimpacts of environmental degradation, especially \r\ndesertification, my Government held a special meeting \r\nin the Gobi Desert late last month. \r\n The challenges in meeting the MDGs are many, \r\nso building enduring partnerships is essential for their \r\neffective implementation. This should involve local \r\nGovernments, the national Government, the private \r\nsector and civil society at home, and our international \r\ndevelopment partners, both bilateral and multilateral. \r\nOnly by working together — while holding ourselves \r\nmutually accountable — will we be able to deliver \r\ntangible and sustainable results. And let me conclude \r\nwhere I began, my Government stands ready to do its \r\npart to achieve these results. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Treki) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nThe Assembly will now hear an address by His \r\nExcellency Mr. Wen Jiabao, Premier of the State \r\nCouncil of the People’s Republic of China. \r\n Mr. Wen Jiabao (China) (spoke in Chinese): \r\nWorld leaders at the United Nations Millennium \r\nSummit made a solemn commitment to make the right \r\nto development a reality for everyone and free the \r\nentire human race from hunger and poverty. The \r\nprogress towards the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs) over the past decade has been uneven in \r\ndifferent regions and fields. Many countries have yet to \r\nmake visible headway in improving the health of \r\nwomen and children, achieving gender equality and \r\nprotecting the environment. A considerable number of \r\ndeveloping countries have been hit hard by the global \r\nfinancial crisis, natural disasters and volatilities in the \r\nfood and energy markets. And the global population \r\nliving in hunger has increased. Achieving the MDGs \r\ntherefore remains a long and uphill journey. \r\n China, an active and sustained supporter of the \r\nUnited Nations initiative, has made tireless efforts to \r\nreach the MDGs. Since 1978, the number of Chinese \r\nliving in absolute poverty has been reduced by over \r\n200 million, accounting for 75 per cent of the total \r\npopulation lifted out of poverty in developing \r\ncountries. At the same time, we are keenly aware that \r\nChina is a country with a large population and a weak \r\neconomic foundation. We are confronted with the \r\nproblem of imbalances in development and we have \r\ntens of millions of people living in poverty. We will \r\nfurther step up poverty alleviation through \r\ndevelopment and we are confident that the MDGs will \r\nbe achieved as scheduled in China. \r\n Over the years, the Chinese Government has \r\nprovided sincere and selfless assistance in multiple \r\nforms to other developing countries to the best of the \r\ncountry’s ability. We will further strengthen and \r\nimprove foreign assistance and contribute our due \r\nshare to the early achievement of the MDGs \r\nthroughout the world. \r\n First, let me address the issue of helping to \r\nimprove the livelihood of people in developing \r\ncountries. In the coming five years, China will take the \r\nfollowing steps in support of better livelihoods for \r\npeople in other developing countries: we will build 200 \r\nschools, dispatch 3,000 medical experts, train 5,000 \r\nlocal medical personnel and provide medical \r\nequipment and medicine to 100 hospitals, build 200 \r\nclean energy and environmental protection projects, \r\nA/65/PV.9  \r\n \r\n10-54527 8 \r\n \r\nand increase assistance to small island developing \r\nStates in disaster prevention and mitigation to help \r\nbuild up their capacity in countering climate change. \r\nHere, I would like to announce that China will, within \r\nthe next three years, donate US$14 million to the \r\nGlobal Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. \r\n Secondly, with regard to reducing and cancelling \r\nthe debts of the least developed countries (LDCs), by \r\nthe end of 2009, the Chinese Government had \r\ncancelled debts worth 25.6 billion RMB yuan owed by \r\n50 heavily indebted poor countries and least developed \r\ncountries. We will cancel their debts associated with \r\nthe outstanding governmental interest-free loans that \r\nmature in 2010. \r\n Thirdly, with regard to deepening financial \r\ncooperation with developing countries, China has \r\nprovided $10 billion in concessional loans to African \r\ncountries and $15 billion of credit support to some \r\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) \r\ncountries to help them counter the international \r\nfinancial crisis. We have committed to contributing \r\nUS$50 billion to the International Monetary Fund \r\nresources increase with an explicit request that the \r\nfunds be used, first and foremost, to help LDCs. China \r\nwill continue to extend a certain scale of financing \r\nsupport to developing countries in the form of \r\nconcessional loans and preferential export buyer’s \r\ncredit.  \r\n Fourthly, with regard to broadening economic and \r\ntrade ties with developing countries, China has made a \r\ncommitment to phase in zero-tariff treatment to \r\nproducts listed under 95 per cent of all tariff items \r\nfrom relevant LDCs. Since July 2010, we have given \r\nzero-tariff treatment to the exports from 33 LDCs \r\nunder more than 4,700 tariff items, covering the vast \r\nmajority of the products from these countries. In the \r\nfuture, we will give zero-tariff treatment to more \r\nproducts and let more countries benefit from this \r\narrangement. We will continue to encourage Chinese \r\ncompanies to expand investment in developing \r\ncountries.  \r\n Fifthly, with regard to strengthening agricultural \r\ncooperation with developing countries, in the next five \r\nyears, China will dispatch 3,000 agricultural experts \r\nand technical staff, provide 5,000 agriculture-related \r\ntraining opportunities in China and enhance, on a \r\npriority basis, cooperation with other developing \r\ncountries in agricultural planning, hybrid rice, \r\naquaculture, farmland water conservancy and \r\nagricultural machinery.  \r\n Sixthly, with regard to helping developing \r\ncountries develop human resources, in the next five \r\nyears, China will train another 80,000 professionals in \r\nvarious fields for developing countries. We will \r\nincrease the number of scholarships and mid-career \r\nMaster’s degree programmes for people from \r\ndeveloping countries and provide training opportunities \r\nin China to 3,000 school principals and teachers. \r\n Since July this year, in order to support Pakistan’s \r\nefforts in fighting floods and rebuilding the country, \r\nChina has decided to provide it with 320 million RMB \r\nyuan of humanitarian assistance and has sent a relief \r\nteam to the disaster-stricken areas. I wish to take this \r\nopportunity to announce that China will, on top of its \r\npledged assistance, provide an additional $200 million \r\nto assist Pakistan. \r\n The next five years will be crucial to achieving \r\nthe MDGs. The international community must, with a \r\ngreater sense of urgency and responsibility, take \r\ndecisive steps in the following areas to achieve \r\ncommon progress. In identifying work priorities, the \r\ninternational community should give high priority to \r\nhelping Africa to eliminate poverty and achieve \r\ndevelopment and to increasing support to the least \r\ndeveloped countries. Developing countries should \r\nconsider poverty eradication through development a \r\ncentral task and continue to strengthen national \r\ndevelopment capacities. Developed countries must \r\nhonour their commitments in good faith, raise the \r\nofficial development assistance share of their gross \r\nnational income to 0.7 per cent at an early date, and \r\nprovide long-term, stable and predictable financial \r\nassistance to developing countries. Assistance should \r\nbe selfless and have no strings attached. \r\n To improve implementation mechanisms, the \r\nUnited Nations should continue to play a central role in \r\ninternational development cooperation. It is important \r\nto establish an MDG assessment mechanism at an early \r\ndate and to strengthen international cooperation and \r\ncoordination. In order to establish sustainable peace, \r\nall countries and nations should relinquish past \r\ngrievances, resolve disputes by peaceful means, and \r\ncreate conditions for peaceful development. \r\n The adoption of the Millennium Declaration \r\n(resolution 55/2) brought light to people suffering from \r\npoverty around the world. Let us work more diligently \r\n A/65/PV.9\r\n \r\n9 10-54527 \r\n \r\nand strengthen cooperation in order to attain the \r\nMillennium Development Goals on schedule and to \r\nsupport the development and progress of all \r\nhumankind.  \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Treki) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nThe Assembly will now hear an address by His \r\nExcellency Mr. Lars Løkke Rasmussen, Prime Minister \r\nof the Kingdom of Denmark. \r\n Mr. Rasmussen (Denmark): The Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) are critical to our global \r\neffort to meet the challenges posed by poverty, disease \r\nand conflict. Since their adoption 10 years ago, the \r\nworld has undergone significant changes, yet the Goals \r\nare as important as ever. Despite the emergence of a \r\nnew global landscape, they remain a common reference \r\npoint for our joint effort to create a better tomorrow for \r\nthe poorest and most vulnerable. \r\n At this High-level Plenary Meeting, we have \r\nreaffirmed our resolve to meet and achieve the MDGs \r\nby 2015. This is a strong message following a period of \r\nglobal crisis that has affected all of us. We have \r\nlearned that business as usual is no longer good \r\nenough. And this lesson is just as relevant when it \r\ncomes to the fulfilment of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. Luckily, we now know what \r\nworks and what does not work. Therefore, we must all \r\nfocus on implementation during the remaining five \r\nyears. \r\n The private sector is instrumental to creating \r\nsustainable economic growth and employment. Without \r\nprivate sector-driven growth, we will not be successful \r\nin eradicating poverty or mobilizing the necessary \r\ndomestic resources for education, health and other \r\nsocial services. We must ensure that the benefits of \r\ngrowth reach the poor and that they generate freedom \r\nand opportunities for individuals to change their lives. \r\nThis is particularly important in Africa. \r\n In 2008, Denmark established the Africa \r\nCommission with the participation of African leaders \r\nand key stakeholders. The Commission underlined the \r\nimportance of growth and employment, particularly for \r\nyoung people, who represent a huge untapped resource. \r\nBased on the work of the Commission, Denmark is \r\ndoubling its support for private sector development in \r\nAfrica. To move this agenda forward, I was honoured \r\nto co-sponsor an event on inclusive growth and \r\nemployment in Africa this morning with the President \r\nof Liberia and the Prime Minister of Tanzania. Our \r\ngeographic and economic points of departure may be \r\ndifferent, but we see eye to eye on the importance of \r\ninclusive economic growth that generates employment. \r\n The international community must also \r\nacknowledge that conflict is a barrier to development. \r\nIn many areas affected by conflict, achieving long-term \r\ndevelopment and economic growth remains a distant \r\ngoal, full of barriers and risks of setback.  \r\n We are sending a clear message at this summit – \r\nwomen are agents of development. Equality and equal \r\nopportunities for women are a vital engine for \r\neconomic and social development. There is no chance \r\nwhatsoever of achieving the MDGs without a \r\nstrengthened focus on women’s empowerment. If \r\nwomen are to make use of their full potential, they \r\nmust be able to decide freely if and when they want \r\nchildren,  and they must have access to health services \r\nwhen giving birth. Denmark supports developing \r\ncountries in their realization of women’s sexual and \r\nreproductive health and rights.  \r\n Mr. Deiss, Co-Chair, took the Chair. \r\n Developing countries must take responsibility for \r\ntheir own development. I am pleased that many \r\ndeveloping countries have turned the MDGs into \r\nnational targets. At the same time, donor countries \r\nmust live up to their commitments. Denmark is one of \r\nonly five countries in the world that exceeds the target \r\nof 0.7 per cent of their gross national income for \r\nofficial development assistance.  \r\n We will continue to work to ensure that our aid \r\nachieves results and makes a difference. This requires \r\nfocus and a willingness to prioritize our development \r\ncooperation. Our global partnership is constantly \r\nevolving. New actors are emerging. We are seeing \r\nincreased South-South cooperation and increased \r\npublic-private collaboration. And we have witnessed \r\nhow private foundations have shown the way on \r\nimportant development issues. We must ensure that all \r\nof these efforts are directed towards the same goal — \r\nthe achievement of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. \r\n We have gained valuable experience over the past \r\n10 years. The challenge has been clearly defined. We \r\nnow have five years left. We have to do it right and we \r\nhave to start today. Denmark stands ready to do its \r\npart. \r\nA/65/PV.9  \r\n \r\n10-54527 10 \r\n \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): \r\nThe Assembly will now hear an address by His \r\nExcellency Mr. Alik L. Alik, Vice President of the \r\nFederated States of Micronesia \r\n Mr. Alik (Federated States of Micronesia): I am \r\ndeeply honoured to share with the Assembly today the \r\nexperience of my country in pursuit of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). This is a story of \r\nachievements as well as challenges for my country, the \r\nFederated States of Micronesia. During the 2000 \r\nMillennium Summit, we committed ourselves to \r\nestablishing a new global partnership to reduce \r\nextreme poverty and hunger, to improve the quality of \r\neducation and health, to pursue gender equality and to \r\npromote environmental integrity and sustainability, \r\namong other tasks. Five years later, that commitment to \r\nthe MDGs was reaffirmed. \r\n The MDGs have become the framework \r\ndocument guiding concrete measures undertaken by \r\ncountries in different parts of the globe. The ambitious \r\nexpectation is that by 2015 millions of people will rise \r\nout of hunger and extreme poverty and have access to \r\nbetter educational opportunities, safe water, sanitation \r\nand health care and treatment. While achievements \r\nhave been made in various sectors, the recent global \r\nfinancial and economic crises have imposed enormous \r\nimpediments to meeting the targets and indicators. \r\n I am happy to report that the alarming population \r\ngrowth rate of my country was reduced during the \r\n1990s by almost 50 per cent and is now maintained at \r\n3.28 per cent annually. But we cannot take full \r\nsatisfaction in this one index alone. We know only too \r\nwell that we need to do better in terms of per capita \r\nincome generation and human development. \r\nEmployment and income are at the very heart of \r\npoverty reduction. The creation of job opportunities \r\nwill require policy reforms. The establishment of a \r\nregulatory environment conducive to trade and private \r\nsector development is also important. Our policy is to \r\nstreamline the size of Government; in so doing, we are \r\ntaking care to ensure that essential services are not \r\nadversely impacted in a wholesale manner.  \r\n While we are grateful to our development \r\npartners and friends for their support and cooperation \r\nover the years, we realize that we must face reality and \r\nchart our own course. With our economy \r\noverwhelmingly dominated by a large public sector, a \r\nmajor part of the challenge to our efforts to meet the \r\nMDGs is the reduction in our resources of traditional \r\nbilateral assistance. In this respect, I underscore the \r\nimportance of the international community honouring \r\nits commitment to provide 0.7 per cent of gross \r\nnational income for official development assistance. \r\n Micronesia has a special partnership agreement \r\nwith the United States that is enshrined in a treaty \r\ncalled the Compact of Free Association. The treaty \r\nincludes an economic package upon which we pin high \r\nhopes to stimulate our efforts towards the attainment of \r\nthe MDGs through improvement in the health and \r\neducation sectors. \r\n Despite our best efforts, economic activity in \r\nMicronesia since the amended Compact went into \r\neffect in 2004 has been unsteady and sporadic. For \r\nexample, real gross domestic product (GDP) recovered \r\nfrom a decline of 3.4 per cent in previous years to a \r\npositive 1.6 per cent growth between 2004 and 2005. \r\nThat brief positive growth was again followed by a \r\ndecline in the ensuing years until 2009, when GDP \r\nslightly recovered with a 0.4 per cent growth. That \r\nmodest growth in GDP is further offset by three \r\nobservable trends: sluggishness in real per capita \r\nincome, reduction in employment and increase in out-\r\nmigration. \r\n Applying the definition or criteria of the MDGs, \r\nit is estimated that 30 per cent of our population live \r\nbelow the national poverty line. It seems unlikely that \r\nmy country will halve this proportion by 2015. I am \r\npleased to note that, consistent with our strategic \r\ndevelopment plan, addressing poverty through job \r\ncreation remains part of our long-term national \r\nobjective. In addition, a poverty alleviation strategy \r\nwould be needed in order to reverse the ongoing \r\nprocess of out-migration and the potential adverse \r\nimpact of the expansion of the informal economic \r\nsector. \r\n In education, I am pleased to report that we are \r\nachieving high enrolment rates at the primary school \r\nlevel. Gross and net enrolment is over 90 per cent. The \r\nnear parity between girls and boys in elementary \r\nschools and the higher levels of enrolment of girls in \r\nhigh schools are important achievements in my \r\ncountry. The literacy rate for persons 15 to 24 years old \r\nis over 90 per cent, and is slightly higher for females \r\nthan for males. My Government is committed to \r\nplacing high priority on further improving the quality \r\nof education in the coming years. It is for this reason, \r\n A/65/PV.9\r\n \r\n11 10-54527 \r\n \r\namong others, that we need to direct significant \r\nattention to the remaining 5 per cent of our children \r\nwho are still outside our education system.  \r\n I believe that the increased access to education \r\nhas helped to considerably narrow the gender gap. \r\nHowever, more efforts are needed to increase the \r\nparticipation of women in the labour force. \r\nImprovements in women’s health are a priority, \r\nincluding better access to reproductive health care and \r\nreducing the prevalence of non-communicable \r\ndiseases, notably in our outer islands. \r\n I believe that the ratification of the Convention \r\non the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination \r\nagainst Women has certainly helped to raise the profile \r\nof women in our island communities. We have taken \r\nother initiatives to address issues relating to women’s \r\npolitical representation, maternity leave and domestic \r\nviolence. Legislation creating a national commission \r\non the status of women was also recently introduced in \r\nour national congress. \r\n The challenges to achieving the MDGs in the \r\nhealth sector are in the areas of child mortality and \r\nimproving maternal health. It is urgent to address both \r\nareas effectively. In my country, reducing child \r\nmortality has been a long-standing priority, and we are \r\non track to achieve MDG 4. That effort will be further \r\nbolstered with targeted interventions in the primary \r\nhealth care system and in communities. It is necessary \r\nto increase the number of pregnant women who receive \r\nadequate prenatal care and to reduce post-neonatal \r\ndeaths by improving living conditions. The Federated \r\nStates of Micronesia is also on track to achieve the \r\nmaternal mortality rate target. However, more attention \r\nneeds to be given to universal access to reproductive \r\nhealth services, especially in areas where the \r\npopulation is widely dispersed. \r\n The prevention of HIV/AIDS is a national \r\npriority, and a national strategic plan to address the \r\nissue has been prepared. Programmes operate at both \r\nthe national and the state levels, and focus has been \r\ngiven to prevention, community-based planning and \r\ncare for persons living with HIV/AIDS. We have also \r\nfocused on reducing the number of cases of \r\ntuberculosis, diabetes, heart disease and cancer. A \r\ncomprehensive and coordinated non-communicable \r\ndisease programme is ongoing. More awareness is \r\nnecessary to reduce behavioural risk factors, such as \r\ntobacco use, alcohol abuse and lack of physical \r\nactivity. \r\n I have highlighted our achievements and \r\nchallenges, but there is a far larger challenge that \r\nwould render all our achievements irrelevant. We \r\ncannot meaningfully talk about the MDGs unless the \r\ninternational community addresses the real danger that \r\nMicronesia and other small island developing States \r\nwill disappear because of the adverse impacts of \r\nclimate change. In short, we are the least responsible \r\nbut most vulnerable. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Treki) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nThe Assembly will now hear an address by His \r\nExcellency Mr. Nick Clegg, Deputy Prime Minister of \r\nthe United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern \r\nIreland. \r\n Mr. Clegg (United Kingdom): It is an honour for \r\nme to address the General Assembly today for the first \r\ntime as Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. \r\nIt is a privilege to be here to discuss how, together, we \r\ncan reach the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \r\nand make the necessary commitments towards \r\neradicating the problems that blight the world we \r\nshare: poverty, hunger, disease and the degradation of \r\nour natural environment. \r\n This week, we are reviewing the progress, \r\nassessing the obstacles and agreeing a framework for \r\naction to meet our targets. Those are the technocratic \r\nterms in which Governments must necessarily trade, \r\nbut let us be clear. Behind the officialese of summits \r\nlies our single, common purpose to uphold the dignity \r\nand security that is the right of every person in every \r\npart of the world. \r\n In the end, development is about freedom. It is \r\nabout freedom from hunger and disease; freedom from \r\nignorance; and freedom from poverty. Development \r\nmeans ensuring that every person has the freedom to \r\ntake their own life into their own hands and determine \r\ntheir own fate. The past decade has seen some \r\nimportant progress. That progress has, however, been \r\nuneven and, on a number of our Goals, we remain \r\nsignificantly off track. So, my message today from the \r\nUnited Kingdom Government is that we will keep our \r\npromises and we expect the rest of the international \r\ncommunity to do the same. For our part, the new \r\ncoalition Government has committed to reaching \r\n0.7 per cent of gross national income devoted to aid \r\nfrom 2013 — a pledge that we will enshrine in law. \r\nA/65/PV.9  \r\n \r\n10-54527 12 \r\n \r\nThat aid will be targeted in ways that we know will \r\nmake the biggest difference. \r\n I am pleased to announce today that the United \r\nKingdom will be stepping up our efforts to combat \r\nmalaria. In Africa, a child dies from that easily \r\npreventable disease every 45 seconds. So we will make \r\nmore money available and ensure that we get more for \r\nour money, with the aim of halving malaria-related \r\ndeaths in 10 of the worst affected countries. \r\n The United Kingdom Government is also proud \r\nto be boosting our contribution to the international \r\ndrive on maternal and infant health, spearheaded by the \r\nSecretary-General. Our new commitments will save the \r\nlives of 50,000 mothers and a quarter of a million \r\nbabies by 2015. \r\n The United Kingdom makes such commitments at \r\na time of significant difficulty in our domestic \r\neconomy. The new Government has inherited a £156-\r\nbillion budget deficit, so increasing our international \r\naid budget is not an uncontroversial decision. Some \r\ncritics have questioned that decision, asking why, at a \r\ntime when people at home are making sacrifices in \r\ntheir pay and their pensions, we are increasing aid for \r\npeople in other countries.  \r\n But we make that choice because we recognize \r\nthat the promises that the United Kingdom has made \r\nmust hold in the bad times as well as the good, and that \r\nthey are even more important now than they were \r\nbefore; because we understand that, while we are \r\nexperiencing hardship on our shores, it does not \r\ncompare to the abject pain and destitution of others; \r\nbecause we take seriously the fact that the new \r\ncoalition Government is the last Government able to \r\ndeliver on our country’s promises in time for the 2015 \r\nMDG deadline; and because we know that doing so is \r\nin our own, enlightened self-interest. \r\n When the world is more prosperous, the United \r\nKingdom will be more prosperous. Growth in the \r\ndeveloping world means new partners with which to \r\ntrade and new sources of global growth. Equally, when \r\nthe world is less secure, the United Kingdom is less \r\nsecure within it. \r\n Climate change does not somehow stop at our \r\nborders. When pandemics occur, we are not immune. \r\nAnd when poverty and poor education fuel the growth \r\nof global terrorism, our society bears the scars too. \r\n Twenty-two of the 34 countries furthest from \r\nreaching the MDGs are in the midst of or emerging \r\nfrom violent conflict. These are fragile spaces, such as \r\nAfghanistan, where hate can proliferate and terrorist \r\nattacks can be planned, where organized criminals can \r\nharvest the drugs that ravage our streets, and where \r\nfamilies are persecuted, displaced and pushed to seek \r\nrefuge with us.  So we do not see the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals just as optimistic targets for \r\nfaraway lands. They are not simply charity, nor are \r\nthey pure altruism. They are also the key to lasting \r\nsafety and future prosperity for the people of the \r\nUnited Kingdom and, of course, for people right across \r\nthe globe. \r\n We welcome the General Assembly’s agreement \r\nto annually review the progress made against the \r\ncommitments agreed at this summit. The United \r\nKingdom will stand up to that test, and today I call on \r\nothers to show equal resolve. The Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals must be a priority for each and \r\nevery nation represented in this Hall. Developed \r\nnations must honour their commitments, and \r\ndeveloping nations must understand that they will not \r\nreceive a blank cheque.  \r\n Developing countries and donors must work \r\ntogether as equal partners towards securing our \r\ncommon interest. They will be expected to administer \r\naid in ways that are accountable, transparent and \r\nresponsible, creating the conditions for economic \r\ngrowth and job creation; prioritizing national budgets \r\non health, infrastructure, education and basic services; \r\nmanaging natural resources, particularly biodiversity, \r\nin an environmentally sustainable way; and improving \r\nthe lives of women and girls — empowering them, \r\neducating them, and ensuring healthy mothers can raise \r\nstrong children. There can be no doubt that women and \r\ngirls hold the key to greater prosperity for their \r\nfamilies, their communities and their nations, too. \r\n If we each step up, we can meet the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. We can liberate millions of people \r\nfrom daily suffering, and give them the resources to \r\ntake control of their lives and their destinies. May \r\nfuture generations look back and say that they inherited \r\na better world because, at this critical moment, at this \r\ndifficult moment, we did not shrink from our \r\nresponsibilities. Let them say that we rose to the \r\nchallenge and that we kept our promise. \r\n A/65/PV.9\r\n \r\n13 10-54527 \r\n \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): \r\nThe Assembly will now hear an address by His \r\nExcellency Mr. Barack Obama, President of the United \r\nStates of America. \r\n President Obama: In the Charter of this United \r\nNations, our countries pledged to work for the \r\npromotion of the economic and social advancement of \r\nall peoples. In the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights, we recognized the inherent dignity and rights \r\nof every individual, including the right to a decent \r\nstandard of living. And a decade ago, at the dawn of a \r\nnew millennium, we set concrete goals to free our \r\nfellow men, women and children from the injustice of \r\nextreme poverty. \r\n Those are the standards that we set, and today we \r\nmust ask: Are we living up to our mutual \r\nresponsibilities? With our economies struggling, so \r\nmany people out of work and so many families barely \r\ngetting by, I suspect that some in wealthier countries \r\nmay ask, “Why a summit on development”? The \r\nanswer is simple. In our global economy, progress in \r\neven the poorest countries can advance the prosperity \r\nand security of people far beyond their borders, \r\nincluding my fellow Americans. \r\n When a child dies from a preventable disease, it \r\nshocks all of our consciences. When a girl is deprived \r\nof an education or her mother is denied equal rights, it \r\nundermines the prosperity of their nation. When a \r\nyoung entrepreneur cannot start a new business, it \r\nstymies the creation of new jobs and markets not only \r\nin that entrepreneur’s country, but also in our own. \r\nWhen millions of fathers cannot provide for their \r\nfamilies, it feeds the despair that can fuel instability \r\nand violent extremism. When a disease goes \r\nunchecked, it can endanger the health of millions \r\naround the world. \r\n So let us put to rest the old myth that \r\ndevelopment is mere charity that does not serve our \r\ninterests. Let us reject the cynicism that says certain \r\ncountries are condemned to perpetual poverty, for the \r\npast half-century has witnessed more gains in human \r\ndevelopment than at any time in history. A disease that \r\nhad ravaged generations, smallpox, was eradicated. \r\nHealth care has reached the far corners of the world, \r\nsaving the lives of millions. From Latin America to \r\nAfrica and Asia, developing nations have transformed \r\ninto leaders in the global economy. \r\n Nor can anyone deny the progress that has been \r\nmade towards achieving certain Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). The doors of education \r\nhave been opened to tens of millions of children — \r\nboys and girls. New cases of HIV/AIDS, malaria and \r\ntuberculosis are down. Access to clean drinking water \r\nis up. Around the world, hundreds of millions of people \r\nhave been lifted out of extreme poverty. That is all for \r\nthe good, and it is a testimony to the extraordinary \r\nwork that has been done both within countries and by \r\nthe international community. \r\n Yet we must also face the fact that progress \r\ntowards other Goals that were set has not come nearly \r\nfast enough for the hundreds of thousands of women \r\nwho lose their lives every year simply giving birth; for \r\nthe millions of children who die from the agony of \r\nmalnutrition; and for the nearly 1 billion people who \r\nendure the misery of chronic hunger. \r\n That is the reality that we must face. If the \r\ninternational community just keeps doing the same \r\nthings the same way, we may make some modest \r\nprogress here and there but we will miss many \r\nDevelopment Goals. That is the truth. With 10 years \r\ndown and just five years before our development \r\ntargets are due, we must do better. \r\n Now, I know that helping communities and \r\ncountries realize a better future is not easy. I have seen \r\nit in my own life. I saw it in my mother as she worked \r\nto lift up the rural poor from Indonesia to Pakistan. I \r\nsaw it on the streets of Chicago, where I worked as a \r\ncommunity organizer trying to build up \r\nunderdeveloped neighbourhoods in this country. It is \r\nhard work, but I know progress is possible. \r\n As President, I have made it clear that the United \r\nStates will do our part. My National Security Strategy \r\nrecognizes development not only as a moral \r\nimperative, but as a strategic and economic imperative. \r\nSecretary of State Clinton is leading a review to \r\nstrengthen and better coordinate our diplomacy and our \r\ndevelopment efforts. We have re-engaged with \r\nmultilateral development institutions, and we are \r\nrebuilding the United States Agency for International \r\nDevelopment as the world’s premier development \r\nagency. In short, we are making sure that the United \r\nStates will be a global leader in international \r\ndevelopment in the twenty-first century. \r\n However, we also recognize that the old ways \r\nwill not suffice. That is why, in Ghana last year, I \r\nA/65/PV.9  \r\n \r\n10-54527 14 \r\n \r\ncalled for a new approach to development that \r\nunleashes transformational change and allows more \r\npeople to take control of their own destiny. After all, no \r\ncountry wants to be dependent on another. No proud \r\nleader in this Hall wants to ask for aid. No family \r\nwants to be beholden to the assistance of others. \r\n To pursue that vision, my Administration \r\nconducted a comprehensive review of America’s \r\ndevelopment programmes. We listened to leaders in \r\nGovernment, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), \r\ncivil society, the private sector, philanthropy, Congress \r\nand our many international partners. And today, I am \r\nannouncing our new United States Global \r\nDevelopment Policy — the first of its kind by an \r\nAmerican Administration. It is rooted in America’s \r\nenduring commitment to the dignity and potential of \r\nevery human being, and it outlines our new approach \r\nand the new thinking that will guide our overall \r\ndevelopment efforts, including the plan that I promised \r\nlast year and that my Administration has delivered to \r\npursue the Millennium Development Goals. Put simply, \r\nthe United States is changing the way we do business. \r\n First, we are changing how we define \r\ndevelopment. For too long, we have measured our \r\nefforts by the dollars that we spent and the food and \r\nmedicines that we delivered. But aid alone is not \r\ndevelopment. Development is helping nations to \r\nactually develop — moving from poverty to prosperity. \r\nAnd we need more than just aid to unleash that change. \r\nWe need to harness all the tools at our disposal — from \r\nour diplomacy to our trade policies to our investment \r\npolicies. \r\n Secondly, we are changing how we view the \r\nultimate goal of development. Our focus on assistance \r\nhas saved lives in the short term, but it has not always \r\nimproved those societies over the long term. Consider \r\nthe millions of people who have relied on food \r\nassistance for decades. That is not development; that is \r\ndependence, and it is a cycle that we need to break. \r\nInstead of just managing poverty, we have to offer \r\nnations and peoples a path out of poverty. \r\n Now, let me be clear. The United States of \r\nAmerica has been and will remain the global leader in \r\nproviding assistance. We will not abandon those who \r\ndepend on us for life-saving help, whether it is food or \r\nmedicine. We will keep our promises and honour our \r\ncommitments. In fact, my Administration has increased \r\nassistance to the least developed countries. We are \r\nworking with partners to finally eradicate polio. We are \r\nbuilding on the good efforts of my predecessor to \r\ncontinue to increase funds to fight HIV/AIDS, \r\nincreasing those funds to record levels — and that \r\nincludes strengthening our commitment to the Global \r\nFund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. And we \r\nwill lead in times of crisis, as we have done since the \r\nearthquake in Haiti and the floods in Pakistan. \r\n But the purpose of development — what is \r\nneeded most right now — is creating the conditions \r\nwhere assistance is no longer needed. So we will seek \r\npartners that want to build their own capacity to \r\nprovide for their people. We will seek development that \r\nis sustainable. And building in part on the lessons of \r\nthe Millennium Challenge Corporation, which has \r\nhelped countries such as El Salvador to build rural \r\nroads and raise the incomes of its people, we will \r\ninvest in the capacity of countries that are proving their \r\ncommitment to development. \r\n Remembering the lessons of the green revolution, \r\nwe are expanding scientific collaboration with other \r\ncountries and investing in game-changing science and \r\ntechnology to help spark historic leaps in development. \r\nFor example, instead of just treating HIV/AIDS, we \r\nhave invested in pioneering research to finally develop \r\na way to help millions of women actually prevent \r\nthemselves from being infected in the first place. \r\nInstead of simply handing out food, our food security \r\ninitiative is helping countries such as Guatemala, \r\nRwanda and Bangladesh to develop their agriculture, \r\nimprove crop yields and help farmers get their products \r\nto market. Instead of simply delivering medicine, our \r\nGlobal Health Initiative is also helping countries such \r\nas Mali and Nepal to build stronger health systems and \r\nbetter deliver care.  \r\n And with financial and technical assistance, we \r\nwill help developing countries embrace the clean \r\nenergy technologies they need to adapt to climate \r\nchange and pursue low-carbon growth. In other words, \r\nwe are making it clear that we will partner with \r\ncountries that are willing to take the lead because the \r\ndays when their development was dictated by foreign \r\ncapitals must come to an end. \r\n Now, this brings me to a third pillar of our new \r\napproach. To unleash transformational change, we are \r\nputting a new emphasis on the most powerful force the \r\nworld has ever known for eradicating poverty and \r\ncreating opportunity. It is the force that turned South \r\n A/65/PV.9\r\n \r\n15 10-54527 \r\n \r\nKorea from a recipient of aid to a donor of aid. It is the \r\nforce that has raised living standards from Brazil to \r\nIndia. And it is the force that has allowed emerging \r\nAfrican countries like Ethiopia, Malawi and \r\nMozambique to defy the odds and make real progress \r\ntowards achieving the Millennium Development Goals, \r\neven as some of their neighbours — such as Côte \r\nd’Ivoire — have lagged. \r\n The force I am speaking about is broad-based \r\neconomic growth. Now every nation will pursue its \r\nown path to prosperity, but decades of experience tell \r\nus that there are certain ingredients upon which \r\nsustainable growth and lasting development depend. \r\nWe know that countries are more likely to prosper \r\nwhen they encourage entrepreneurship, when they \r\ninvest in their infrastructure, and when they expand \r\ntrade and welcome investment. So we will partner with \r\ncountries like Sierra Leone to create business \r\nenvironments that are attractive to investment and do \r\nnot scare it away. We will work to break down barriers \r\nto regional trade and urge nations to open their markets \r\nto developing countries. We will keep pushing for a \r\nDoha Round that is ambitious and balanced, and that \r\nworks not just for major emerging economies, but for \r\nall economies. \r\n We also know that countries are more likely to \r\nprosper when Governments are accountable to their \r\npeople. So we are leading a global effort to combat \r\ncorruption, which in many places is the single greatest \r\nbarrier to prosperity and which is a profound violation \r\nof human rights. That is why we now require oil, gas \r\nand mining companies that raise capital in the United \r\nStates to disclose all payments they make to foreign \r\nGovernments, and it is why I urged the Group of \r\nTwenty to put corruption on its agenda and make it \r\nharder for corrupt officials to steal from their own \r\npeople and stifle their nation’s development. \r\n The United States will focus our development \r\nefforts on countries like Tanzania that promote good \r\ngovernance and democracy, the rule of law and equal \r\nadministration of justice, transparent institutions with \r\nstrong civil societies and respect for human rights. \r\nBecause over the long run, democracy and economic \r\ngrowth go hand in hand. \r\n We will reach out to countries making transitions \r\nfrom authoritarianism to democracy and from war to \r\npeace. The people of Liberia, for example, have shown \r\nthat even after years of war, great progress can be \r\nachieved. And as others show the courage to put war \r\nbehind them — including, we hope, in the Sudan — \r\nthe United States will stand with those that seek to \r\nbuild and sustain peace. \r\n We also know that countries are more likely to \r\nprosper when they tap the talents of all their people. \r\nThat is why we are investing in the health, education \r\nand rights of women and working to empower the next \r\ngeneration of women entrepreneurs and leaders. \r\nBecause when mothers and daughters have access to \r\nopportunity, that is when economies grow; that is when \r\ngovernance improves. \r\n And it is why we are partnering with young \r\npeople, who in many developing countries make up \r\nmore than half the population. We are expanding \r\neducational exchanges, like the one that brought my \r\nfather here to America from Kenya. And we are \r\nhelping young entrepreneurs succeed in a global \r\neconomy. As the final pillar of our new approach, we \r\nwill insist on more responsibility — from ourselves \r\nand from others. We insist on mutual accountability. \r\nFor our part, we will work with Congress to better \r\nmatch our investments with the priorities of our partner \r\ncountries. Guided by the evidence, we will invest in \r\nprogrammes that work; we will end those that do not. \r\nWe need to be big-hearted but also hard-headed in our \r\napproach to development. \r\n To my fellow donor nations, I say: Let us honour \r\nour respective commitments. Let us resolve to put an \r\nend to hollow promises that are not kept. Let us \r\ncommit to the same transparency that we expect from \r\nothers. Let us move beyond the old, narrow debate \r\nover how much money we are spending and instead let \r\nus focus on results — whether we are actually making \r\nimprovements in people’s lives. \r\n Now, to developing countries I say: This must be \r\nyour moment of responsibility as well. We want you to \r\nprosper and succeed. It is not only in your interest; it is \r\nin our interests. We want to help you realize your \r\naspirations as nations and the individuals in each of \r\nyour countries. But there is no substitute for your \r\nleadership. Only you and your people can make the \r\ntough choices that will unleash the dynamism of your \r\ncountry. Only you can make the sustainable \r\ninvestments that improve the health and well-being of \r\nyour people. Only you can deliver your nations to a \r\nmore prosperous and just future. We can be partners, \r\nbut ultimately you have to take the lead. \r\nA/65/PV.9  \r\n \r\n10-54527 16 \r\n \r\n Finally, let me say this. No one nation can do \r\neverything everywhere and still do it well. To meet our \r\ngoals, we must be more selective and focus our efforts \r\nwhere we have the best partners and where we can \r\nhave the greatest impact. And just as this work cannot \r\nbe done by any one Government, it cannot be the work \r\nof Governments alone. In fact, foundations, the private \r\nsector and NGOs are making historic commitments that \r\nhave redefined what is possible. \r\n And this gives us the opportunity to forge a new \r\ndivision of labour for development in the twenty-first \r\ncentury. It is a division of labour where, instead of so \r\nmuch duplication and inefficiency, Governments, \r\nmultilaterals and NGOs are all working together. We \r\neach do the piece that we do best — as we are doing, \r\nfor example, in support of Ghana’s food security plan, \r\nwhich will help more farmers get more goods to market \r\nand earn more money to support their families. \r\n That is the progress that is possible. Together, we \r\ncan collaborate in ways unimaginable just a few years \r\nago. Together, we can realize the future that none of us \r\ncan achieve alone. Together, we can deliver historic \r\nleaps in development. We can do this, but only if we \r\nmove forward with the seriousness and sense of \r\ncommon purpose that this moment demands. \r\n We need development that offers a path out of \r\npoverty for that child who deserves better; \r\ndevelopment that builds the capacity of countries to \r\ndeliver the health care and education that their people \r\nneed; development that unleashes broader prosperity \r\nand builds the next generation of entrepreneurs and \r\nemerging economies; development rooted in shared \r\nresponsibility, mutual accountability and, most of all, \r\nconcrete results that pull communities and countries \r\nfrom poverty to prosperity. These are the elements of \r\nAmerica’s new approach. This is the work that we can \r\ndo together. And this can be our plan, not simply for \r\nmeeting our Millennium Development Goals, but for \r\nexceeding them and then sustaining them for \r\ngenerations to come. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): \r\nThe Assembly will now hear an address by His \r\nExcellency Mr. Naoto Kan, Prime Minister of Japan. \r\n Mr. Kan (Japan) (spoke in Japanese; English \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): It is an \r\nhonour for me to address the General Assembly, \r\nrepresenting my country, Japan. \r\n Ten years have passed since the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) were launched here at the \r\nUnited Nations. We came together under one \r\nobjective — the attainment of the MDGs — and we \r\nhave worked together to fight poverty. During this \r\ndecade, we have achieved remarkable victories. The \r\nunder-five child mortality rate has been decreased by \r\nmore than 3.7 million child deaths per year, as \r\ncompared with 1990. An additional 37 million children \r\nhave come to enjoy the benefits of primary education. I \r\nwould like, at the outset, to express my respect for the \r\nefforts of those who committed themselves to \r\nachieving these outcomes. \r\n Such advances notwithstanding, the challenge of \r\nachieving the Goals is not yet won. Today, in order to \r\naddress areas where progress has been particularly \r\nslow, I will announce concrete promises in the field of \r\nhealth, including maternal and child health, as well as \r\nin the field of education, including basic education. I \r\ncall this initiative the Kan commitment. \r\n Last June, on becoming Prime Minister, I made a \r\npledge to the people of Japan that I would achieve a \r\nsociety in which human suffering was reduced to a \r\nminimum. I believe that the role of political leaders is \r\nto minimize, to the extent possible, sources of misery \r\nsuch as disease, poverty and conflict. In other words, \r\ntheir role is to establish a society in which human \r\nsuffering is reduced to a minimum. I have long held \r\nthat belief, and I think that it resonates with the \r\nphilosophy behind the MDGs. Only when such a \r\nsociety is realized can each and every individual find \r\nhis or her own way of life and take on challenges for \r\nthe fulfilment of personal dreams. \r\n My first promise based on this philosophy is that \r\nJapan will make contributions in the field of health in \r\norder to protect people’s lives. First of all, let me touch \r\nupon the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and \r\nMalaria, which Japan helped to found. \r\n Earlier this month, I visited the Global Fund’s \r\nphoto exhibition, “Access to Life”, which was held in \r\nJapan. When I was Minister of Health and Welfare, I \r\nacknowledged for the first time the responsibility of \r\nthe Government concerning the issue of HIV/AIDS \r\ninfection caused by contaminated blood products. I \r\napologized to all patients and reached a settlement. \r\nThat experience made me even more powerfully \r\ninterested in issues associated with various diseases, \r\nincluding HIV/AIDS.  \r\n A/65/PV.9\r\n \r\n17 10-54527 \r\n \r\n The recent photo exhibition gave me an \r\nopportunity to renew my awareness that in Asia, \r\nAfrica, South America and many other places in the \r\nworld a large number of people affected by AIDS are \r\nstill losing their lives. At the same time, I should also \r\nnote that, thanks to the development of new medicines, \r\nadequate treatment can prevent mother-to-child \r\ntransmission of HIV, as well as return many people \r\nliving with HIV to society.  \r\n The Global Fund has been playing an outstanding \r\nrole, and I would like to pay sincere tribute to it. I \r\nhereby promise that, at the third replenishment \r\nconference, scheduled for next month, Japan will \r\nannounce its intention to make contributions \r\namounting to $800 million in the coming years. \r\n Another major cause for concern is the fact that \r\nthe number of deaths among children under the age of \r\nfive remains high and that the reductions achieved to \r\ndate in the mortality rate for infants and pregnant \r\nwomen are still far short of the targets set in the \r\nMDGs. We need to exert additional drastic efforts. \r\nJapan will provide assistance, in the amount of \r\n$5 billion over five years beginning in 2011, to \r\ncontribute to the achievement of the health-related \r\nMDGs. We make this contribution in order to save the \r\nlives of 680,000 mothers and 11.3 million children, in \r\ncooperation with other partners. Specifically, Japan \r\nwill provide intensive assistance centred on three \r\npillars: maternal and child health, three major \r\ninfectious diseases and measures to address global \r\nthreats such as new influenza viruses.  \r\n At the same time, Japan will propose an \r\nassistance model in maternal and child health that will \r\ngive people in need access to appropriate preventive \r\nservices and medical care. I call that model \r\nEMBRACE — which stands for Ensure Mothers and \r\nBabies Regular Access to Care — virtually to embrace \r\nmothers and children. This model aims to deliver a \r\nsequence of health services, including prenatal care \r\nwith routine examinations and neonatal care at \r\nfacilities with quality equipment and human resources, \r\nimproved access to hospitals and the provision of \r\nimmunizations. This is an approach to ensure a \r\ncontinuum of care from pregnancy to post-delivery. I \r\nemphasized the importance of this model at the \r\nMuskoka Summit of the Group of Eight, and obtained \r\nthe endorsement of participating countries. I now take \r\nthis opportunity to call once again on developing \r\ncountries to adopt this model, and on donors and \r\ninternational organizations to make concerted efforts to \r\nimplement optimal assistance measures in maternal and \r\nchild health.  \r\n I am convinced that Japan’s world-class medical \r\nservices and leading technologies will also contribute \r\nto the solution of health issues. For instance, a \r\nJapanese company that plays a leadership role in my \r\ncountry’s business community has provided tens of \r\nmillions of long-lasting insecticide-treated nets to \r\nAfrican countries. This product has its roots in Japan’s \r\ntraditional life wisdom. A cutting-edge technology has \r\nmade it possible for the anti-insect effect to be long-\r\nlasting. That has made an immeasurable contribution in \r\nthe struggle to eradicate malaria. As that example \r\ndemonstrates, the role to be played by civil society, \r\nincluding the private sector and non-governmental \r\norganizations, is very significant. I fully support such \r\nendeavours on the part of civil society, now and in the \r\nfuture.  \r\n For its part, education, in conjunction with good \r\nhealth, provides the basis for participation in society. It \r\nis a cause of great dismay that in the world today there \r\nare many children who are forced into hard labour or \r\nare deprived of opportunities to receive an education \r\ndue to poverty and conflict. Without a proper \r\neducation, young people cannot realize their potential \r\nor take an active part in their society. They lose hope \r\nand, in turn, society loses dynamism.  \r\n Japan will provide $3.5 billion in assistance over \r\nfive years beginning in 2011, so as to contribute to the \r\nachievement of the education-related MDGs and to \r\nprovide an education to all the children of the world, \r\nincluding those who have been marginalized and those \r\nliving in conflict areas. To that end, Japan will \r\ncooperate with developing countries and other partners. \r\nThis assistance will provide a quality education \r\nenvironment for at least 7 million children. Japan will \r\nalso pay careful attention to post-primary education, \r\nnamely, secondary education, vocational training and \r\ntertiary education. Assistance for education leads to the \r\ncreation of jobs and social vitality, which I consider \r\nessential. \r\n Japan therefore proposes a basic education \r\nassistance model which encourages coordinated efforts \r\namong schools, communities and Governments for the \r\ncomprehensive improvement of the learning \r\nenvironment in such areas as quality of teachers, \r\nschool management, treatment of girls and disabled \r\nA/65/PV.9  \r\n \r\n10-54527 18 \r\n \r\nstudents, nutrition, sanitation and child physical \r\nfitness. I call this model “School for All”, and I am \r\nconfident that the introduction of this model in \r\ndeveloping countries will lead to the diffusion of \r\nsustainable education. I call on donor countries and \r\ninternational organizations to work together to support \r\nchildren around the world in accordance with this \r\nmodel. Japan will definitely be standing at the \r\nforefront of such efforts. \r\n Japan attaches importance to assistance in the \r\nfield of health and education because it can serve as a \r\nbasis for developing countries to achieve sustained \r\ndevelopment. From that perspective, achieving the \r\nMDGs with an emphasis on these two fields is crucial. \r\nWe must make the utmost effort to this end.  \r\n It is important to follow up on this High-level \r\nPlenary Meeting. With that in mind, my country \r\nproposes to hold an international conference in Japan \r\nnext year in order to strengthen coordination among a \r\nbroad range of stakeholders, not only Governments but \r\nalso international organizations and non-governmental \r\norganizations.  \r\n Today, I have announced the Kan commitment, \r\nwhich consists of concrete measures that Japan will \r\ntake, particularly in the fields of health and education. \r\nThis is our promise to the next generation, who bear \r\nthe world’s hopes for the future. The MDGs are the \r\npromises that our generation must keep to future \r\ngenerations. The path to their achievement overlaps \r\nwith the path towards a society in which human \r\nsuffering is reduced to a minimum. The Goals are \r\ninterrelated, and much more needs to be done. \r\nHowever, little time remains. We, the Member States, \r\nneed to renew our commitment to achieve the MDGs \r\nby 2015 and take action. Let us work together towards \r\nachieving this critical aim. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): I \r\nnow give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Han Seung-\r\nsoo, Presidential Envoy of the Republic of Korea and \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth \r\nsession. \r\n Mr. Han Seung-soo (Republic of Korea): We are \r\ngathered here today at a moment well past the midway \r\npoint in our journey to achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) by the 2015 target date. \r\nThe past decade has witnessed impressive progress \r\ntowards meeting the Goals. However, we must \r\ncontinue to address the unmet and under-met targets \r\nacross sectors, countries and regions, so that we can \r\nbreak with the destiny syndrome: “where you live \r\ndetermines how you live”. \r\n To keep our promise to achieve the MDG targets \r\nby 2015, it will be critical to secure adequate, \r\nconsistent and predictable financial resources for \r\ndevelopment. Donor countries must honour their long-\r\nstanding promises and deliver on their commitments. \r\nAt the same time, development financing has to be \r\nbroad-based, going beyond official development \r\nassistance (ODA), as we agreed at the United Nations \r\nInternational Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment in Monterrey, Mexico, in 2002, a \r\nconference I had the honour of hosting in my capacity \r\nas President of the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth \r\nsession. \r\n Financing the MDGs has to start at home, too. We \r\nneed to raise and allocate more domestic resources and \r\nrevenues through improved tax systems and financing \r\nmechanisms. Innovative financing mechanisms also \r\nhave much to offer to scale up existing resources. For \r\nits part, the Republic of Korea is taking concrete steps \r\nto fulfil its commitment to increase the volume of ODA \r\nto 0.25 per cent of its gross national income, about $3 \r\nmillion, by 2015. We are also utilizing innovative \r\nfinancing mechanisms to increase our support to health \r\nsectors. \r\n Of equal importance is the effective use of \r\ndevelopment resources. The call for more development \r\nresources needs to go hand in hand with the effort to \r\nimprove the quality and effectiveness of development \r\nassistance through enhanced national ownership, \r\nalignment, harmonization, managing for results and \r\nmutual accountability. \r\n Following the High-level Forums on Aid \r\nEffectiveness held in Rome, Paris and Accra, Korea \r\nwill host the fourth such meeting, in Busan, Korea, \r\nnext year. At that fourth High-level Forum, we will \r\nassess the relevance of the principles on aid \r\neffectiveness, based on hard data and on close \r\nmonitoring of those principles. However, our \r\ndiscussion will not stop there. We need to go even \r\nfurther, moving beyond the aid effectiveness agenda at \r\nthe Forum. Indeed, we have to broaden our concept of \r\ndevelopment cooperation to focus more on \r\ndevelopment itself. What ultimately matters is not the \r\neffectiveness of aid, but rather the development results \r\nit brings about. \r\n A/65/PV.9\r\n \r\n19 10-54527 \r\n \r\n We strongly support the Secretary-General’s view \r\nexpressed in his report, “Keeping the Promise” \r\n(A/64/665), that the intricately interwoven nature of \r\nthe MDGs calls for a holistic approach to development. \r\nImprovement in one sector will carry the momentum \r\nover to other closely related Goals. For instance, Korea \r\nfully understands the far-reaching impact of health and \r\neducation on development, based on its own \r\ndevelopment experiences. Similarly, gender equality \r\nand women’s empowerment will have a multiplier \r\neffect for development.  \r\n While these MDG targets are pivotal to \r\ndevelopment, their progress has been mostly \r\ndisappointing. To partake in the global efforts to \r\nremedy these shortfalls, we have recently joined the \r\nMuskoka Initiative on Maternal, Newborn and Child \r\nHealth. In a similar vein, we welcome and support the \r\nSecretary-General’s Global Strategy for Women’s and \r\nChildren’s Health. In addition, Korea has been a solid \r\nsupporter of the International Drug Purchase Facility \r\n(UNITAID) and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, \r\nTuberculosis and Malaria. I am also pleased to \r\nannounce that this year Korea became a new supporter \r\nof the GAVI Alliance — formerly known as the Global \r\nAlliance for Vaccines and Immunization — which \r\nfocuses on improving rates of child mortality through \r\nvaccination for those under five years old. Korea will \r\nbe the first Asian country to participate in the GAVI \r\nAlliance.  \r\n Another area where we are strengthening our \r\ndevelopment cooperation is addressing environmental \r\ndegradation and climate change, on which the future of \r\nhumanity so critically depends. Korea has been \r\nimplementing the East Asia Climate Partnership to \r\nsupport the efforts of Asia Pacific countries to address \r\nthe challenges posed by climate change. We have also \r\nlaunched a low-carbon green growth initiative to \r\ncontribute to the promotion of green industries, which \r\nwill be integral to realizing inclusive and equitable \r\ngrowth. In order to promote low-carbon green growth \r\nand to share our experience with developing and \r\nemerging economies, the Global Green Growth \r\nInstitute was established in Korea three months ago. \r\n Our action plans need to be further focused on the \r\nregions falling behind on progress. Most of the sub-\r\nSaharan African countries and the least developed \r\ncountries are seriously off track on most of the MDG \r\ntargets. While Asia remains the focus of Korea’s \r\ndevelopment cooperation, we are increasing our \r\nsupport to Africa and to least developed countries in \r\nother regions. In this regard, we are implementing a \r\nKorea-Africa initiative as a multi-year programme for \r\npartnership with African countries. The least developed \r\ncountries continue to be prominent development \r\npartners with Korea. Thus, about 50 per cent of \r\nKorea’s bilateral assistance has been allocated to low-\r\nincome countries, including the least developed \r\ncountries. \r\n By investing in the MDGs, we invest in global \r\neconomic growth. The growth we harness, however, \r\nmust be inclusive and equitable. Sustainable \r\nachievement of poverty eradication comes only when \r\nwe obtain inclusive and equitable growth, where \r\npeople across every sphere of society are allowed to \r\nparticipate in the process of development and equitably \r\nenjoy the benefits of growth. \r\n Achieving the MDGs cannot be seen as an end in \r\nitself. Our work does not stop at achieving the MDGs. \r\nWe must aim at sustaining them in the long run. It is in \r\nthis context that, at the forthcoming Group of Twenty \r\n(G 20) summit in Seoul in November, we will \r\ndeliberate on the ways to ensure development through \r\nsustainable growth. We will utilize our comparative \r\nadvantage as a group of major global economies by \r\nconcentrating on laying the foundations for growth, \r\nsuch as infrastructure, investment, trade, human \r\nresources development and financial inclusion. Thus, \r\nthe G 20 will focus on increasing the sustainability of \r\ngrowth by enhancing the capacity of developing \r\ncountries and by securing resilience in times of \r\nfinancial and economic crisis. This will in turn further \r\ncontribute to a sustained achievement of the MDGs. \r\n The road ahead will likely be more difficult than \r\nthe road already travelled. But with the renewed \r\nresolution forged today, I am confident that we will \r\nturn our global visions into reality as we chart our path \r\nto 2015. Korea, for its part, remains very much \r\ncommitted to serving in a leadership role in bridging \r\nthe gap between the developed and developing \r\ncountries. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): I \r\nnow give the floor to His Excellency Mr. S.M. Krishna, \r\nMinister for External Affairs of India. \r\n Mr. Krishna (India): I am honoured to be present \r\nat this august gathering and to speak on the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), an aspiration that so \r\nfittingly captures the global vision and promise for \r\nA/65/PV.9  \r\n \r\n10-54527 20 \r\n \r\nhumanity in the twenty-first century. Allow me to \r\nbegin by thanking you, Mr. Co-Chair, for your \r\nstewardship, guidance and support of the expansive \r\ndevelopment agenda of the United Nations, including \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. \r\n In his message on United Nations Public Service \r\nDay five years ago, our Prime Minister, Mr. Manmohan \r\nSingh, said: \r\n  “The Millennium Development Goals that \r\nwe have set for ourselves cannot be met unless \r\nGovernments are proactive. No Government in \r\nany civilized society can ignore the basic needs \r\nof people. The goal of the development process \r\nmust be to include every last member of our \r\nsociety in that process.” \r\n As we take stock of the MDGs, we note that the \r\nworld as a whole has made substantial gains but that \r\nthe progress is uneven and falls short of expectations. \r\nThis is particularly visible in the so-called forgotten \r\nMDGs, the MDGs that deal with women and children’s \r\nhealth. We are therefore happy that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has set out a Global Strategy for Women’s and \r\nChildren’s Health. \r\n Natural disasters have also taken a toll on MDG \r\nachievement. The death and destruction in Haiti and \r\nPakistan have been on an unprecedented scale. As a \r\nfellow developing country that has itself seen a huge \r\nimpact from such disasters, we responded, duty-bound \r\nin solidarity, to assist the Governments and people in \r\nthe affected countries to the best of our ability and in \r\nkeeping with their priorities. \r\n A growing concern is the impact of climate \r\nchange on vulnerable communities and regions in our \r\ncountry. Rain-fed agriculture accounts for 60 per cent \r\nof crop area in India. Climate change has aggravated \r\nthe situation in traditionally drought- and flood-prone \r\nregions in the country. The National Rural Employment \r\nGuarantee Scheme was designed to provide relief to \r\naffected farming communities in the country. We in \r\nIndia are alive to the challenges of climate change, and \r\nremain committed to mounting appropriate national \r\nand regional responses. Our national action plan on \r\nclimate change will increase the share of clean and \r\nrenewable energy in our energy mix, increase energy \r\nefficiency across the economy and expand our forest \r\ncover. \r\n With just five years to go until the MDG target \r\nyear, and given our record of mixed success, it is \r\nimperative that we significantly step up our individual \r\nand collective commitments and efforts for the \r\nrealization of the MDGs. \r\n Our collective efforts have certainly borne fruit \r\ntowards the goal of poverty eradication at the global \r\nlevel. But more than 60 million people slipped back \r\ninto poverty in 2009 following the economic and \r\nfinancial crisis of 2008. This has certainly had a \r\nregressive impact on the MDGs. \r\n It is, therefore, important that we ensure that \r\nglobal economic recovery is durable, balanced and \r\nsustainable. This is also critical for achieving the \r\nMDGs and for us to be able to effectively address the \r\nchallenges of food and energy security, climate change \r\nand natural disasters. As far as India is concerned, our \r\neconomy has shown resilience and is expected to grow \r\nby 8.5 per cent in 2010-2011, and by over 9 per cent in \r\n2011-2012. \r\n The Millennium Development Goals Report \r\n2010, published by the United Nations, notes that \r\nIndia’s efforts on poverty reduction have been a major \r\ncontributor to a reduction in global poverty levels; \r\nsome 188 million people in India will be out of poverty \r\nby 2015. We need, however, to be cognizant of the fact \r\nthat the largest concentration of poor in the world \r\nremains in India and South Asia. The long distance we \r\nstill have to travel to put poverty behind us in India \r\nshould not be underestimated. \r\n Our efforts, therefore, are aimed at pushing push \r\nfor growth while ensuring that the fruits of growth \r\nreach out across our society. That is what we call \r\ninclusive growth. This indeed is the main objective of \r\nIndia’s ambitious socio-economic development \r\nprogrammes. \r\n The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural \r\nEmployment Guarantee Act, with an annual budget of \r\n$8 billion, is the largest cash for work poverty \r\nalleviation programme in the world and has benefited \r\n50 million rural households in India thus far. \r\n By law, all Indian children aged 6 to 14 years \r\nmust now receive free education. Sarva Shiksha \r\nAbhiyan, a universal elementary education programme \r\nwith an annual budget of $3 billion, has dramatically \r\nincreased primary school enrolment. To ensure that \r\nchildren remain in school, and that this also benefits \r\n A/65/PV.9\r\n \r\n21 10-54527 \r\n \r\nthem nutritionally, we also run the largest school lunch \r\nprogramme in the world. This is being supplemented \r\nby Saakshar Bharat, a special programme focused on \r\nfemale literacy launched in 2009.  \r\n Enormous strides have been made in the \r\nempowerment of women. India has embarked on \r\nperhaps the most ambitious affirmative action initiative \r\never by mandating that one third of all elected \r\npositions in local government be reserved for women. \r\nWe are striving to raise this figure even higher. More \r\nthan a million women representatives already hold \r\nelected positions in India. Legislation to extend the \r\nreservation of seats in parliament is under \r\nconsideration. \r\n India faces enormous challenges in the areas of \r\nwomen’s and children’s health. The Government of \r\nIndia adopted a multi-pronged strategy under the \r\nNational Rural Health Mission in 2005 to provide rural \r\narea health care that is accessible, affordable, \r\naccountable, effective and reliable. This Mission is \r\nfully focused on improving our standing on maternal \r\nand child health indicators. Under the umbrella of this \r\nMission, recently, in order to accelerate progress, new \r\ninitiatives have been identified, namely, the name-\r\nbased tracking of pregnant women, a maternal death \r\nreview, an adolescent reproductive and sexual health \r\nprogramme, differential planning and an annual health \r\nsurvey.  \r\n Janani Suraksha Yojana, our dedicated safe \r\nmotherhood programme, has so far benefited 28 \r\nmillion women. As a result of ongoing efforts, the \r\nmaternal mortality rate in India has come down from \r\n301 per 100,000 live births during the period 2001-\r\n2003 to 254 during the period 2004-2006, a decline of \r\n47 points over a period of three years. Though we are \r\nstill some distance away from the target of 109 by \r\n2015, given the rate of decline in the past and \r\ncomprehensive efforts being made across the country, \r\nit appears that India is on the right track with regard to \r\nMDG 5. We are also trying to take similar strides on \r\nthe infant mortality rate. \r\n India has made notable progress on combating \r\nHIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases. The HIV \r\nepidemic has reached a plateau in India, and we now \r\nhave the prevalence rate down to 0.34 per cent. \r\n India has made valuable use of technology to \r\nbring the benefits of development to our people. \r\nTeledensity in India has increased from 0.67 per cent in \r\n1991 to 37 per cent in 2009. Our innovative and low-\r\ncost technology solutions in the field of information \r\ntechnology and telecommunication have brought about \r\ndevelopment benefits, not just in India, but also to \r\npeople in Africa, Latin America and elsewhere. \r\n In August 2010, we launched the second phase of \r\nthe Pan-African e-network project. The network project \r\nwill link all 53 countries in Africa with centres of \r\nexcellence in India for telemedicine and tele-education \r\nservices. More than 1,700 students from African \r\ncountries have already registered with Indian \r\nuniversities for various courses, and regular \r\ntelemedical consultations have started between African \r\ndoctors and Indian specialists. \r\n The lack of progress on building a robust global \r\npartnership needs to be urgently addressed. Unmet \r\nfinancial commitments by developed country partners \r\nhave widened the financing for development gap. We \r\ncall upon them to fulfil the commitment made long ago \r\nto devote 0.7 per cent of gross national income to \r\nofficial development assistance. Equally urgent is the \r\nneed to transfer technology and undertake capacity-\r\nbuilding in developing countries.  \r\n The quantum leap in South-South cooperation has \r\nsignificantly complemented global resources targeted \r\nat the development agenda, but it cannot be a substitute \r\nfor North-South cooperation. We are happy that India’s \r\ndevelopment partnership with countries in the South \r\ntoday goes beyond technical cooperation. Our annual \r\noutlay on concessional lending and grants is well over \r\n$1 billion and covers countries in our region, in Africa \r\nand beyond. In addition, $5 billion has been extended \r\nin lines of credit since 2003. We are committed to \r\ndoing more in the coming years with our partners in \r\nthe South and to stepping up our support to South-\r\nSouth cooperation, both on the development side and \r\nin support of humanitarian needs. \r\n India is seized of the MDG challenges that lie \r\nahead of us. Our commitment remains resolute. Our \r\nnational goal of inclusive growth and the larger idea of \r\na more humane and just global society that underlines \r\nthe Millennium Declaration will continue to inspire us \r\nto work untiringly to achieve the MDGs by 2015. \r\n In the final march towards the attainment of the \r\nMDGs, let us be inspired by the belief of Mahatma \r\nGandhi in the limitless potential of human \r\nachievement. He said that “a small body of determined \r\nspirits fired by an unquenchable faith in their mission \r\nA/65/PV.9  \r\n \r\n10-54527 22 \r\n \r\ncan alter the course of history”. That should be the \r\ndriving force for nations around the world. To that we \r\ndedicate ourselves. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Treki) (spoke in Arabic): I \r\nnow give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Xavier Espot \r\nMiró, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Institutional \r\nRelations of the Principality of Andorra. \r\n Mr. Espot Miró (Andorra) (spoke in Catalan; \r\nFrench text provided by the delegation): We are here in \r\nNew York today in the same Hall where we met \r\n10 years ago, when all Member States made promises \r\nin the form of concrete goals to combat poverty and \r\nwork on behalf of the world’s most vulnerable people. \r\nAt that time, we spoke of global solidarity rising above \r\nnational interests. We also spoke of fair globalization \r\nas a cornerstone for peace and security.  \r\n Today we face promises that may not be able to \r\nbe met. If we are optimistic, we may note some \r\nprogress, even if it has been unequal. People who have \r\nfallen victim to violent conflict and those most \r\nvulnerable to natural disasters have once again \r\nremained on the sidelines of development. World Bank \r\nstatistics show that in recent years the number of \r\npeople in extreme poverty has fallen by 28 per cent. \r\nThat decrease was concentrated mainly in Eastern Asia, \r\nwhile the regions of Western Asia and sub-Saharan \r\nAfrica saw movement in the opposite direction.  \r\n The situation is critical when we talk about \r\nhunger and malnutrition. We must not forget today that \r\nbillions of people are victims of hunger — an alarming \r\nfigure. The current financial crisis has only served to \r\nexacerbate the situation, in particular in sub-Saharan \r\nAfrica, where salaries have fallen and prices for staples \r\ncontinue to rise.  \r\n In the area of education, the 2010 Education for \r\nAll Global Monitoring Report, published by UNESCO, \r\nreveals that much headway has been made in the past \r\n10 years. Nonetheless, there are still 72 million \r\nchildren in the world who do not receive schooling. \r\n With regard to gender equality, we welcome the \r\ncreation of the United Nations Entity for Gender \r\nEquality and the Empowerment of Women (UN \r\nWomen). I hope that this new tool will make it possible \r\nto improve women’s participation in the political and \r\neconomic spheres. \r\n In the area of health, we have not yet resolved the \r\nproblem of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. At the same time, \r\n80 per cent of diseases are the result of pollution and \r\nshortages of water. Every day, more than 5,000 \r\nchildren under the age of five die due to water that is \r\nnot safe to drink. The right to drinking water is a \r\nfundamental right. We hope that, in line with the \r\nfundamental right to water and sanitation, we will be \r\nable to step up efforts to guarantee better access to \r\ndrinking water. \r\n We have indeed made progress, but the results are \r\nrelative and still fall far short of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. Moreover, collective security, the \r\nfight against terrorism, financial stability and the issue \r\nof commodity prices can be added to the list of \r\nobjectives. We all recognize that, year after year, we \r\nare becoming increasingly dependent upon each other. \r\nWe know that shared prosperity translates into shared \r\nsecurity. Why is it so difficult to make available the \r\nresources required to achieve the Goals?  \r\n In Andorra, the achievement of the MDGs is \r\nendorsed and respected by the entire society. Moreover, \r\nwe engage in cooperation so that the Goals can be \r\nachieved throughout the world, while at the same time \r\ntaking into account the situation of our own country. \r\nOur Development Cooperation Service, which I have \r\nthe honour to lead, was established in 2001. Today, the \r\nMinistry for Foreign Affairs and Institutional Relations \r\nallocates 23 per cent of its financial resources to \r\ndevelopment cooperation. Andorra’s development aid \r\nplan, which governs our cooperation, takes into \r\naccount the Millennium Development Goals, which are \r\nincluded as priority areas for our cooperation. Andorra \r\npromotes solidarity among human beings at both the \r\ncommunity and the Government levels. Andorran \r\nassociations are also making their contribution to \r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals. \r\n We have entered the home stretch of a race that \r\nwill conclude in five years. We face difficulties that are \r\nmore serious than expected. The efforts we have made \r\nto date have not been sufficient. The word “crisis” in \r\nChinese is made up of two characters. One means \r\ndanger and the other means opportunity.  \r\n We must try to get back on track. This requires all \r\nStates to be able to carry out their own development \r\npolicies adapted to their needs. Accordingly, the role of \r\nthe United Nations and all of its specialized agencies is \r\ncrucial. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to express my \r\nGovernment’s support for the draft outcome document \r\n A/65/PV.9\r\n \r\n23 10-54527 \r\n \r\nof this Meeting (A/65/L.1). We hope that each one of \r\nus will find the ways and means to achieve a multiplier \r\neffect and reverse the current trends. We are convinced \r\nthat we can make the most of this. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Treki) (spoke in Arabic): I \r\nnow give the floor to the His Excellency Mr. Hugo \r\nRoger Martínez Bonilla, Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nthe Republic of El Salvador. \r\n Mr. Martínez Bonilla (El Salvador) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): In fulfilment of the commitments entered \r\ninto with respect to the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs), it is a priority for El Salvador to \r\ncomply with the Goals’ indicators.  \r\n We know that it is possible to achieve the Goals \r\nif they are fully addressed through public economic \r\nand social policies that promote the inclusion in the \r\ndevelopment process of all citizens as their advocates \r\nand beneficiaries, especially the more vulnerable \r\nsectors.  \r\n In this regard, the model of economic growth \r\nwith social inclusion which President Carlos Mauricio \r\nFunes Cartagena has launched emphasizes, among \r\nother things, the strengthening of personal and social \r\ncapacities, access to basic public goods, the rebuilding \r\nof the social fabric and the creation of employment \r\nopportunities.  \r\n The elimination of poverty and hunger, the \r\nachievement of universal primary education and the \r\nimprovement of the health of the population are some \r\nof the key elements in the national five-year plan that \r\nwe are promoting in El Salvador. Furthermore, \r\nPresident Funes has proposed that these development \r\ninitiatives be taken to a regional level in Central \r\nAmerica through a social compact which will make it \r\npossible to improve the standard of living and the \r\ndevelopment of our peoples and to turn us into a more \r\nprosperous and inclusive region in the concert of \r\nnations. \r\n We are pleased with the recognition made by \r\nPresident Obama of the efforts being made by El \r\nSalvador and other countries in striving to achieve the \r\nMDGs. Efforts aimed at eradicating poverty mainly \r\nrequire investments in basic education, sanitation, the \r\nsupply of drinking water, decent housing, food supply \r\nand adequate infrastructure for a population that is \r\nrapidly growing. We also want to create jobs for the \r\ngrowing number of young people joining the labour \r\nforce at a time when unemployment becomes a threat, \r\nespecially in urban areas.  \r\n Even though this was an extraordinary year, \r\ngiven the global economic crisis, the problems in terms \r\nof security and the high exposure to natural disasters, \r\nwe were able, through measures implemented during \r\nthis period, to make some considerable gains, which \r\ndeserve mention. For example, I would underline the \r\nlaunching of a real estate guarantee fund; agricultural \r\nkits for small producers; delivery of land titles; a \r\nprogramme of temporary income support; the \r\nimplementation of a rural communities solidarity \r\nprogramme, which has reached 100 extremely poor \r\nmunicipalities and delivered health and education \r\nvouchers to 106,000 families; the issuing of universal \r\nbasic pensions, starting in November 2009, to 7,000 \r\nadults over 70 years old in 32 municipalities suffering \r\nsevere extreme poverty. These actions are all steps \r\ntaken in support of MDG 1.   \r\n With respect to MDG 2, we can mention the \r\nexpansion of the coverage of the school food \r\nprogramme, which serves on the national level almost \r\n5,000 schools and which benefits more than 1,330,000 \r\nstudents.  \r\n With respect to other MDGs, we note the \r\nissuance of unemployment certificates, beginning in \r\nFebruary 2010, which guarantee workers who have \r\nbeen laid off six months of health care services and the \r\nregional provision of essential medicines to health \r\nunits. Similarly, the elimination of the fee required for \r\naccess to the public health system contributed to a \r\n40 per cent increase in the demand for health services. \r\n The Government of El Salvador has been \r\ndeveloping a thorough reform of its health system \r\nwhich during decades had been abandoned. This \r\nreform is motivated by the recognition that health is a \r\npublic good and a fundamental human right, which the \r\nState must therefore guarantee to all its population. We \r\nwill continue to create spaces for the active social \r\nparticipation of all sectors, particularly those which \r\nhave been traditionally excluded. This step, which was \r\nannounced this week by President Funes, will take \r\nhealth to the homes of Salvadorans and will open up \r\njob opportunities for 14,000 health professionals. \r\n Another of the most relevant examples of this \r\ninclusive policy which takes human rights into account \r\nis the national response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic led \r\nby the Government of El Salvador, with the decisive \r\nA/65/PV.9  \r\n \r\n10-54527 24 \r\n \r\nsupport of the Joint United Nations Programme on \r\nHIV/AIDS and other technical and financial \r\ncooperation agencies, in order to work on the country’s \r\npolicy in the promotion, prevention, early detection, \r\nfollow-up and treatment of sexually transmitted \r\ninfections and diseases as well as of HIV/AIDS. The \r\nGovernment has thus committed itself to undertaking \r\nrelevant measures and actions to achieve the targets \r\nproposed in the MDGs. In this framework, the \r\nawareness of the population concerning a reduction in \r\nstigma and discrimination, the reduction of mother-to-\r\nchild transmission, the free and mass HIV testing and \r\naccess to antiretroviral therapy, also free of cost, by \r\npersons who need it are placing the country on the \r\nright path to achieve MDG 6. \r\n In emphasizing these results, I would like to say \r\nthat experience shows us that in order for these policies \r\nto be effective, they must include a gender perspective \r\nas well as one of social inclusion while making \r\ndeliberate efforts to offer incentives to civil society \r\ninstitutions to participate with the strategies that \r\naddress the basic needs of the population.  \r\n To this end, we promote the participation of the \r\nyoung population, communities, schools and \r\nnon-governmental organizations, among other \r\nstakeholders, in the delivery of promotion and \r\nprevention programmes to reduce health risks, to \r\nprevent dropping out of school, to expand the coverage \r\nof services, and to contribute to the prevention of harm \r\nor risky behaviour. \r\n Another measure was the devising of social \r\nprogrammes as part of a universal protection system, \r\nwhich gave rise to policies that promoted broad \r\ncoverage and inclusiveness. For example, we \r\neliminated voluntary quotas in hospitals and started the \r\nmass distribution of free medicines as part of the \r\nnational health system. In the area of preventive \r\nmedicine, the Government trebled the use of vaccines. \r\nWe also doubled the investment in vaccines by \r\nintroducing the pneumonia vaccine. Similarly, during \r\nPresident Funes’s administration we will have brought \r\ninto the health system thousands of women employed \r\nas domestic workers, who are mostly single mothers \r\nand heads of household.  \r\n In the area of education, the Government \r\nimplemented the most ambitious programme of \r\nassistance to low-income families ever carried out in \r\nEl Salvador. The school kit includes uniforms, shoes \r\nand school supplies for students attending public \r\nschool. This major programme was designed so as  not \r\nonly to assist families but also to promote employment. \r\nMore than 40,000 artisans, family businesses, \r\nmicroenterprises and cooperatives participated in the \r\nsewing of uniforms and the manufacture of shoes as \r\nwell as distributing raw materials and products. \r\n To strengthen aid to the neediest areas of the \r\ncountry, we extended the solidarity initiative for rural \r\ncommunities to cover the 100 poorest municipalities. \r\nMoreover, in the 32 poorest municipalities in the rural \r\nzones, we initiated the universal basic pension for \r\npersons over 70 years of age without means, who had \r\nnever before received Government help. \r\n Given the threat of the exponential growth of \r\nurban poverty as a result of the global financial crisis, \r\nurban solidarity communities were created, which \r\nincluded two pilot programmes. One is the temporary \r\nincome aid programme, which consists of a stipend of \r\n$100 per month for unemployed youth and women \r\nheads of household, in exchange for which the \r\nrecipients offer four days of productive community \r\nwork and attend a day of job training.  Four hundred \r\ntwenty thousand agricultural kits, with seeds and \r\nfertilizer, have been distributed to small rural \r\nproducers who cultivate up to 0.7 hectares of land for \r\ntheir own consumption to help them with their family \r\nfinances. \r\n While recognizing that each country must take \r\nresponsibility for its own development agenda, we are \r\nalso convinced that — because it is a commitment on \r\nthe part of the international community — all national \r\nefforts must be supported and complemented by the \r\nsolidarity and cooperation of the international \r\ncommunity. In this context we commend and we share \r\nthe vision of the Secretary-General, who recently \r\nstated that the priority for the next five years must be \r\nto increase assistance to projects that can yield the best \r\nresults. We therefore support the establishment and \r\nmaintenance of a global alliance for development that \r\nis united and generous and takes into account the \r\ncapacities, resources and limitations — and above all, \r\nthe commitment — of each Government towards \r\nmeeting the MDGs as criteria to support the flow of \r\nassistance needed to achieve those Goals.  \r\n El Salvador shares the vision that all Member \r\nStates will attain, through achieving the MDGs, better \r\n A/65/PV.9\r\n \r\n25 10-54527 \r\n \r\nstandards of living for their peoples, but above all for \r\nthe most vulnerable groups.  \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Treki) (spoke in Arabic): I \r\nnow give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Kevin Rudd, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Australia. \r\n Mr. Rudd (Australia): As nations we have a \r\nresponsibility to do that which we say we will do — a \r\nresponsibility to keep our promises to fellow Member \r\nStates and a responsibility to turn our commitments, \r\nsolemnly given in this great Hall, into concrete actions \r\nthat change the lives of the poorest of the poor across \r\nthe world. A decade ago, we, the nations of the world, \r\nassembled here to offer the world’s poor a fairer share \r\nin the world’s future. A decade later we gather once \r\nagain to take stock and to celebrate that which we have \r\ndone, but also honestly to admit where we have failed. \r\n I want to begin with a story of two children. The \r\nfirst is about a young girl I met on Monday, here in \r\nNew York. Her name is Nthabiseng. She was born in \r\nSoweto. Nthabiseng is a beautiful little girl with the \r\nbrightest of smiles. She is 12 years old. But when she \r\nwas seven, her mother died. Normally, that would have \r\nconsigned her to a life of poverty. But Nthabiseng was \r\ndetermined to get an education. She said, “When \r\nchildren are stopped from going to school, they are \r\nlosing their future and they are losing their tomorrow.” \r\nNow she is doing very well in school and has a very \r\nbright future. Children like Nthabiseng will benefit \r\nfrom the United Nations One Goal programme, which \r\nseeks to make education a reality for all the children in \r\nthe world, not just some. \r\n The second story is of a young boy who has never \r\nbeen to New York. He too lost his mother — she died \r\ngiving birth to him. His family ekes out a living in the \r\nslums of one of the world’s developing mega-cities, not \r\nfar from the skyscrapers of its booming financial \r\ndistrict. This little boy’s days are spent not in school \r\nbut in the traffic of the city, begging for spare change \r\nat car windows when cars stop at the lights. We have \r\nall seen him in our travels. I have not given him a \r\nname. He has thousands of names. And right now, he is \r\nwithout hope. \r\n Why do I tell these stories? Because they are the \r\nhuman faces of what happens when the world acts with \r\ncompassion — and when it does not. The first story \r\ninspires us to further action. The second should make \r\nus determined to act for all. \r\n At the turn of the millennium we, the States \r\nMembers of the United Nations, made a compact with \r\none another. We said we would put our shoulders to the \r\nwheel to lift a billion people out of poverty. And we \r\nsaid we should be measured by these Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) in 2015: to halve poverty \r\nand hunger, to give every girl and boy the chance of a \r\ngood education, to make big cuts in the number of \r\nwomen dying in childbirth and children dying from \r\neasily preventable diseases, to promote gender equality \r\nand empower women, to combat HIV/AIDS, to ensure \r\nglobal sustainability and to develop a global \r\npartnership for development. \r\n Ten years on, it is time to reflect on the report \r\ncard of our progress. The truth is we are not yet on \r\ntrack to register even the barest of passing marks. \r\nSuccesses in some areas — poverty reduction and \r\nschool enrolment — must be weighed against failures \r\nin other areas, including maternal health and child \r\nnutrition. \r\n Our failures have attracted vocal critics — those \r\nwho say that international aid does not work, that it is \r\nwasted that it is poorly managed, that there is just no \r\npoint. This is not Australia’s view. Our view is that the \r\nrichest among us have a profound responsibility to help \r\nthe poorest members of the human family out of \r\npoverty. Poverty is degrading. Poverty is \r\ndehumanizing. Poverty destroys human dignity. \r\n As the Secretary-General reminded us in his \r\nreport “Keeping the promise” (A/64/665), the MDGs \r\nare an expression of basic human rights, the rights of \r\neveryone to good health, education and shelter. I \r\nbelieve that these truths are in fact self-evident. But for \r\nthose who doubt that there is any self-evident truth in \r\nthis concept of social justice we should consider the \r\nfollowing.  \r\n Eliminating extreme poverty boosts global \r\ngrowth for all. It grows the global cake. It grows trade \r\nand investment. It grows jobs. It acts against political \r\nand religious extremism and radicalization. It builds \r\npeace. It enhances stability. And it reduces dangerous, \r\nirregular movements of people around the world. In \r\nother words, eliminating extreme poverty is good for \r\nthe entire human family, and it is good for all nations. \r\n As members of the family of nations, we cannot \r\nstand idly by while 70 million children are unable to \r\nattend school. We cannot stand idly by when hundreds \r\nof thousands of women die in childbirth — an \r\nA/65/PV.9  \r\n \r\n10-54527 26 \r\n \r\nestimated 358,000 in the year before last. Nor can we \r\nstand idly by while infectious diseases cut a \r\ndevastating swath through the communities of the poor. \r\nThe chilling fact is that more than half of the 800 \r\nmillion people in the least developed countries of the \r\nworld are still living in extreme poverty. \r\n Let us be honest. Donor countries have made \r\ncommitments that they have not honoured. For \r\nexample, less than half of the funding pledged to \r\nAfrica five years ago in the Gleneagles declaration of \r\nthe Group of Eight has been delivered. The answer is \r\nnot to push our commitments even further into the \r\nfuture, nor is it simply to sweep it all quietly under the \r\ninternational carpet. The answer is to do that which we \r\nsay that we will do: to honour our commitments, even \r\nwhen the global economic environment is hard, \r\nbecause for the poorest of the poor, it is even harder. \r\nThis is what Australia seeks to do. \r\n Several years ago, halfway to the 2015 deadline, \r\nwe in Australia saw that our efforts were not sufficient. \r\nWe realized that we had to do much more. By 2015, on \r\ncurrent projections, our aid budget will double, just as \r\nit doubled between 2005 and 2010. That will make \r\nAustralia the fastest-growing donor country in the \r\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and \r\nDevelopment. We have maintained our commitment, \r\nincluding a 200 per cent increase in aid to Africa alone, \r\ndespite the impacts of the financial crisis. \r\n The Australian Government, under Prime \r\nMinister Gillard, puts the MDGs at the heart of our aid \r\nprogramme, and, as Australia’s aid programme doubles \r\nover the next five years, we will increase our support \r\nto the least developed countries through the MDGs. \r\n Today I am committing Australia to work towards \r\nproviding 0.15 per cent of our gross national income in \r\naid to the least developed countries, in line with \r\ninternational targets. Across our entire overseas \r\ndevelopment assistance programme, Australia expects \r\nbetween now and 2015 to allocate A$5 billion to \r\neducation, A$1.6 billion to women’s and children’s \r\nhealth, A$1.8 billion to food security, and A$1.2 billion \r\nto action on climate-change adaptation and mitigation \r\nin developing countries, including the 39 small island \r\ndeveloping States that are the most exposed to, but the \r\nleast responsible for, that great threat to our planet — \r\nclimate change. \r\n Australia will also work to open world markets to \r\nleast developed countries in order to enable private \r\ncommerce, trade and investment to help lift these \r\ncountries out of poverty. All that is made possible by \r\nnecessary governance measures to provide transparency \r\nand accountability. Those elements are the necessary \r\nstepping stones to development. \r\n I began with a story of two children, one with \r\nopportunities and one without. The Australian people \r\nby instinct want to see that all the little ones of the \r\nworld are given a fair go. Through their generous \r\nprivate donations and through the official aid \r\nprogramme paid for by taxes, Australians want to \r\nprovide opportunities for all the peoples of the world to \r\nlive a decent life. Australian non-governmental \r\norganizations (NGOs) are active across the world — \r\nNGOs including World Vision, Oxfam, Caritas, \r\nChildFund, Plan International, the Red Cross and the \r\nOaktree Foundation. \r\n Let me conclude by quoting a third child — this \r\ntime a young Australian, a 10-year-old girl who wrote \r\nto me with the following: \r\n  “I think kids in other countries have the \r\nsame rights as kids here — yes, that’s right. Kids \r\neverywhere should have the same things we \r\nhave — like good teachers, doctors, houses and \r\nclean water.” \r\n The Governments of the world cannot let down \r\nthe children of the world. If we want to reform this \r\ngreat institution — these United Nations, this \r\nparliament of humankind — we should not begin with \r\nanother grand plan. We should simply begin by doing \r\nthat which we say we will do. We in Australia want to \r\ndo just that. We want to play our part in bringing these \r\nMillennium Development Goals into reality, to make a \r\nfundamental difference to the world’s poor, and to \r\nmake a fundamental difference to the future of all \r\nhumankind. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Treki) (spoke in Arabic): I \r\nnow give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Mourad \r\nMedelci, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the People’s \r\nDemocratic Republic of Algeria. \r\n Mr. Medelci (Algeria) (spoke in Arabic): Our \r\nmeeting today is an excellent opportunity to evaluate \r\nthe efforts to implement the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs). At the same time, it allows us to note \r\nthe obstacles that hamper their achievement, to learn \r\nlessons and to renew commitments as part of our future \r\nwork. \r\n A/65/PV.9\r\n \r\n27 10-54527 \r\n \r\n Today, although we can express satisfaction at the \r\nprogress made by some countries in the five years \r\nsince the first evaluation meeting and five years before \r\nthe 2015 deadline, we must also note that many \r\ncountries are not going to achieve the Goals. Further \r\ncomplicating matters is the slowdown resulting from \r\nthe food, climate and economic crises from which \r\nAfrican countries, in particular, have suffered — \r\ncountries that have made considerable efforts to \r\nimplement the MDGs.  \r\n It is therefore not surprising that the most recent \r\nAfrican Union Summit, in Kampala, focused its work \r\non the MDGs, especially maternal and child health. \r\nNonetheless, the people of Africa are responsible for \r\ntheir own development, as the New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development has affirmed. However, that \r\nresponsibility should be shared with and supported by \r\nthe international community. \r\n In that context, all considerations concerning our \r\nfuture actions should, in my view, keep in mind two \r\nkey points. First, the eradication of poverty and hunger \r\nis the main MDG and broadly determines the \r\nimplementation of the rest of the Goals, and secondly, \r\nthe crucial need to overcome poverty and hunger in the \r\nworld puts the mobilization of resources, particularly \r\nfinancial resources, at the core of any action aimed at \r\nimplementing the MDGs.  \r\n These key points have led me to propose the \r\nfollowing ideas for our action in future, as part of the \r\nefforts to improve the performance of developing \r\ncountries in achieving the MDGs. \r\n First, the flow of official development assistance \r\n(ODA) must double to bring it into line with \r\ninternational commitments, particularly those made by \r\nthe Group of Eight. For many countries ODA plays a \r\nkey role in poverty reduction. Secondly, we need to \r\nmove towards a delay on debt for struggling \r\ndeveloping countries in order to complement those \r\nmultilateral and bilateral initiatives already adopted to \r\ncancel or mitigate the debt burden for the poorest and \r\nleast developed countries. Thirdly, we should \r\nencourage industrialized countries to increase their \r\nforeign direct investment in the poorest countries. And \r\nfourthly, we should improve access to developed \r\ncountries’ markets for developing countries’ exports. \r\n As far as Algeria is concerned, we are firmly \r\ncommitted to achieving the MDGs by putting \r\neconomic and social development at the heart of the \r\nnew investment programme for 2010 to 2014. Today, \r\nwe can state that my country — which has just \r\npresented its second national report on progress \r\ntowards implementing the MDGs — has already \r\nachieved several Goals, particularly in the areas of \r\nfighting poverty and of education. That is why our \r\npoverty levels have dropped, from 7.1 per cent in the \r\n1990s to 5 per cent in 2009, and why more than a \r\nmillion housing units were built during the five-year \r\nperiod from 2005 to 2009, in large part to help abolish \r\nsubstandard housing. In the area of education, the \r\nschool enrolment rate for six-year-olds has risen from \r\n93 per cent in 1999 to 96.97 per cent in 2009. \r\n The challenges we face today demand that we all \r\nincrease our efforts to do better, and faster. More than \r\never, that requires of us self-reliance through solidarity, \r\nthrough developing everybody’s capacities, and \r\nthrough partnership for the poorest and most \r\nunderprivileged. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Treki) (spoke in Arabic): I \r\nnow give the floor to Her Excellency Ms. Márcia \r\nHelena Carvalho Lopes, Minister for Social \r\nDevelopment and the Fight Against Hunger of the \r\nFederative Republic of Brazil. \r\n Ms. Lopes (Brazil) (spoke in Portuguese; \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): It is an \r\nhonour to represent President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva \r\nat this meeting of great global interest. After seven and \r\na half years of President Lula’s Government, Brazil has \r\nconsolidated a model for fairer and more equitable \r\neconomic growth, with social participation and \r\ninclusion. We are thus repaying our immense debt to \r\nthe Brazilian people and achieving excellent results in \r\nseeking to meet the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs). \r\n In spite of the sectorial advances in some \r\ncountries, it seems clear that if the current trends are \r\nmaintained, we will not achieve all the MDGs by 2015. \r\nIt is up to this meeting, therefore, to identify the \r\nnecessary and urgent strategies to accelerate the \r\ninternational community’s efforts to meet the Goals. \r\nHowever, Brazil considers that meeting the MDGs will \r\nnot be possible without the allocation of significant \r\nadditional financial resources in a stable and \r\npredictable manner, particularly to the poorest \r\ncountries. \r\n Few developed countries have fulfilled the \r\nestablished agreements to promote development, in \r\nA/65/PV.9  \r\n \r\n10-54527 28 \r\n \r\nparticular their commitment to allocate 0.7 per cent of \r\ntheir gross national income to official development \r\nassistance. Brazil firmly believes that all countries \r\nmust fulfil their international obligations.  \r\n It is our understanding that international \r\ncooperation must be accompanied by substantive \r\nreform of the international economic system, including \r\nin the area of governance. We also consider it \r\nnecessary to overcome the obstacles presented by \r\nagricultural subsidies and tariffs, restrictive patents and \r\nunsustainable debt. \r\n Brazil’s progress is the result of a combination of \r\nstructured, nationwide social policies that enjoy the \r\nactive participation of civil society. We set a goal for \r\nourselves, more ambitious than the Goal established in \r\n2000, to eradicate hunger and to reduce extreme \r\npoverty by three fourths by 2015. That goal was \r\nreached in 2007 and surpassed in 2008, when the \r\npercentage of the population living in extreme poverty \r\ndropped to 4.8 per cent — less than one fifth of the \r\n1990 level of 25.6 per cent. In 2008, we also reduced \r\nour country’s historical inequality, with Brazil’s Gini \r\nindex reached 0.544, its lowest level ever. \r\n The Lula Government put in place a wide-ranging \r\nsocial protection system that reaches 70 million people \r\nevery month. The Family Stipend programme today \r\nbenefits 12.6 million families, guaranteeing income \r\nupon their meeting conditions in the areas of education, \r\nmaternal and child health, and avoidance of child \r\nlabour. \r\n We are implementing the Unified Social \r\nAssistance System and the National System of Food \r\nand Nutritional Security. The minimum wage has been \r\nsignificantly increased, improving the income of \r\nworkers, retirees and pensioners. The internal market \r\nwas expanded through employment and income-\r\ngenerating policies, even during the recent \r\ninternational financial crisis. The promotion of policies \r\naimed at ensuring decent work for all and racial \r\nequality have also been priority issues. \r\n With regard to education, 95 per cent of Brazilian \r\nchildren are in school, and the conditions attached to \r\nthe Family Stipend have increased the time that they \r\nremain there. In terms of gender equality and the \r\nempowerment of women, the indicators for education \r\nare positive. In the labour force, the wage gap between \r\nmen and women has been shrinking in the last five \r\nyears. However, high levels of violence against women \r\ncontinue to pose a challenge. In light of that, Brazil is \r\nfully committed to the Unite to End of Violence against \r\nWomen campaign. \r\n Brazil has constantly improved the largest unified \r\nuniversal and free public health system, the “SUS”. We \r\nwill have the opportunity to share our experiences with \r\nother countries in two international conferences that \r\nBrazil will host: the first, this coming December, on \r\nuniversal social security systems, and the second, in \r\nOctober of 2011, on the social determinants of health. \r\n An important result in the area of health has been \r\nthe 58 per cent decrease in the mortality rate of \r\nchildren under the age of five, meeting the Goal before \r\nthe deadline. Addressing maternal mortality is a major \r\nchallenge for the Brazilian Government. In spite of a \r\ndecrease since 1990, it is still high in Brazil, thus \r\nrequiring more targeted policies. \r\n Over the past few years, there has been a \r\ndecrease in Brazil in the incidence of tuberculosis and \r\nof deaths resulting from that disease, as well as a \r\ndecrease in the incidence of malaria in the Amazon \r\nregion. The Brazilian Government, with the \r\nparticipation of civil society, implements free and \r\nuniversal programmes of information dissemination \r\nregarding HIV/AIDS. It distributes preventive \r\nmaterials and ensures access to anti-retroviral drugs to \r\naround 220,000 people. The incidence of HIV/AIDS in \r\nchildren has fallen drastically as a result of actions \r\nadopted in Brazil to reduce vertical transmission of \r\nHIV. \r\n Regarding MDG 7, Brazil has reduced \r\ndeforestation levels in the Amazon and established a \r\nsystem to monitor the deforestation in the cerrado — \r\nthe Brazilian savanna. Forty-five per cent of our \r\ninternal energy supply comes from renewable sources. \r\nOur levels of carbon dioxide emissions originating \r\nfrom fossil fuels are at half the global average. \r\n Brazil has achieved its goal of halving the \r\nproportion of the population without access to safe \r\ndrinking water in urban areas. Sixty-six per cent of this \r\npopulation today has adequate living conditions, as \r\nopposed to 51 per cent in 1992. \r\n Brazil is increasingly contributing to the global \r\npartnership for development, sharing successful \r\nexperiences and deepening cooperation through a \r\nSouth-South perspective. Between 2003 and 2009, the \r\nBrazilian Government concluded over 400 cooperation \r\n A/65/PV.9\r\n \r\n29 10-54527 \r\n \r\nagreements with other developing countries. We \r\ngranted $1.25 billion in debt relief to those countries. \r\n Since the launch of the global Action against \r\nHunger and Poverty and the creation of the pilot, \r\nBrazil has actively participated in innovative financing \r\nmechanisms, including through significant financial \r\ncontributions. \r\n No country should be allowed to fall short of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals because of lack of \r\nfinancial resources. Any country’s inability to achieve \r\nits national goals is also our responsibility. There are \r\nmany challenges still ahead of us, but Brazil remains \r\ncommitted to promoting the achievement of all the \r\nMDGs and to ensuring a more just world for all women \r\nand men. We can all do better. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): \r\nThe Assembly will now hear an address by \r\nMr. Muhammad Mumuni, Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nand Regional Integration of the Republic of Ghana. \r\n Mr. Mumuni (Ghana): At the turn of the century, \r\nin September 2000, Ghana, along with 189 Member \r\nStates of this august Organization, adopted the \r\nMillennium Declaration (resolution 55/2) that laid out \r\nthe vision for a world of common values and renewed \r\ndetermination to achieve peace and a decent standard \r\nof living for every man, woman and child. The eight \r\ngoals that emanated from the Millennium Declaration \r\nwere expected to generate unprecedented and \r\ncoordinated action within the United Nations system, \r\nincluding the Bretton Woods institutions, and within \r\nthe wider donor community. \r\n Ghana has since mainstreamed the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) into its medium-term \r\ndevelopment policy frameworks: the Ghana Poverty \r\nReduction Strategy I, 2003-2005, and the Growth and \r\nPoverty Reduction Strategy II, 2006-2009. The two \r\npolicy frameworks focused on macroeconomic \r\nstability, gainful employment, human resource \r\ndevelopment, the provision of basic services, the \r\nvulnerable and the excluded. Other areas included good \r\ngovernance, continued macroeconomic stability, \r\nprivate sector competitiveness and civic responsibility. \r\n Ghana’s development agenda has been focused on \r\ngrowth and poverty reduction, with the MDGs being \r\nadopted as the minimum requirements for socio-\r\neconomic development. It was estimated that the total \r\nresources needed to implement the Growth and Poverty \r\nReduction Strategy II over the period 2006-2009 was \r\n$8.06 billion, with considerable proportions of these \r\nfunds allocated towards the implementation of MDG-\r\nrelated programmes and projects. \r\n Achieving the MDGs is no mean task. For Ghana, \r\nhalving the proportion of people below the poverty line \r\nalone will require an annual investment expenditure of \r\napproximately $1.9 billion over the period 2005-2015. \r\nIn addition, the country also needs to address critical \r\ninfrastructure gaps, especially in energy, information \r\nand communications technology, rural roads, water and \r\nsanitation, low productivity in agriculture, and \r\nimproving business and investment climate. \r\n Although poverty levels have declined, inequality \r\nexists between and within regions and districts, \r\ntogether with other challenges. The country continues \r\nto depend on primary commodity exports such as cocoa \r\nand gold with limited diversification or processing, and \r\nnow there is concern that the discovery of oil may \r\naggravate the situation. Ghana is also vulnerable to \r\nexternal shocks arising from commodity price \r\nvolatility, as well as challenges posed by climate \r\nchange manifested through high temperatures, sea-\r\nlevel rise, droughts and floods, which affect \r\nagricultural output with repercussions for other sectors \r\nof the economy. \r\n Despite these constraints, Ghana continues to \r\nstrive towards achieving the MDGs. Ghana’s current \r\nsocio-economic development agenda is to attain \r\nmiddle-income status by 2020 within a decentralized \r\ndemocratic environment. This is being pursued \r\nsimultaneously with the adoption of a social protection \r\npolicy aimed at empowering the vulnerable and the \r\nexcluded, especially women, to contribute to and also \r\nshare in the benefits of economic growth. To \r\nunderscore Ghana’s commitment to the attainment of \r\nthe MDGs, the 2010-2013 Medium Term Development \r\nPolicy Framework — the successor to the Growth and \r\nPoverty Reduction Strategy II — has also harmonized \r\nnational development priorities with the MDGs. \r\n The Government continues to work aggressively \r\ntowards improving and sustaining macroeconomic \r\nstability, enhancing the nation’s competitiveness in \r\nindustry and service sectors, and achieving agricultural \r\nmodernization, infrastructural transformation, human \r\nresources development and transparency and \r\naccountability. The Parliament of Ghana also does its \r\nbit through its Committee on Poverty and the MDGs by \r\nA/65/PV.9  \r\n \r\n10-54527 30 \r\n \r\nsensitizing ministries, departments and agencies to \r\nmake provision in their budget proposals to support \r\nMDG and other pro-poor programmes. \r\n We are approximately four and a half years from \r\nthe 2015 target date for achieving the MDGs, and \r\nGhana’s progress is encouraging. According to a report \r\nreleased by the British Overseas Development \r\nInstitute, an international think tank, Ghana is firmly \r\non track to achieve MDG 1, halving poverty, MDG 2, \r\nachieving universal basic education, and part of MDG \r\n3, ensuring gender parity especially at the primary \r\nschool level, before the target date 2015. The report \r\nfurther states that “Ghana outperformed all other \r\ncountries around the world by reducing hunger across \r\nits population by nearly three-quarters, from 34 per \r\ncent to 9 per cent between 1990 and 2004. The report \r\npoints out that Ghana is on course to be the first \r\nAfrican country to achieve MDG 1, halving poverty \r\nand hunger by 2015. \r\n Significant progress has been made towards \r\nachieving the MDG 4 target, reducing both infant and \r\nunder-five mortality rates by two thirds by 2015, and it \r\nis possible for Ghana to achieve that target if we scale \r\nup efforts and sustain the child survival interventions \r\nwhich brought about the current improvement. Despite \r\nheightened efforts over the years, the maternal \r\nmortality rate is still unacceptably high, currently \r\nstanding at 451 deaths per 100,000 live births, which \r\nmeans that Ghana is unlikely to attain the target of \r\nreducing the maternal mortality ratio by three quarters \r\nby 2015, despite improvements in maternal health care \r\nover the past 20 years. \r\n HIV/AIDS prevalence, which is covered by \r\nMDG 6, in Ghana fell from 3.2 per cent in 2006 to \r\n2.2 per cent in 2008 but the challenge to meet the 2015 \r\ntarget of halting and reversing the spread of the \r\nepidemic remains daunting though not insurmountable. \r\nA great deal needs to be done in terms of educational \r\ncampaigns and other HIV/AIDS programmes to \r\npromote significant behavioural change. \r\n The incidence of malaria remains a serious public \r\nhealth concern. It is still considered a leading cause of \r\nmortality and morbidity particularly among pregnant \r\nwomen and children aged under five. \r\n Ghana is also on track to achieve the MDG 7 \r\ntarget of reducing by half the proportion of people \r\nwithout access to improved water before 2015. \r\nHowever, critical challenges exist in providing access \r\nto improved sanitation and reducing the proportion of \r\nthe urban population living in slum areas. Although \r\naccess to improved sanitation has been increasing, \r\nGhana is unlikely to achieve the targets unless extra \r\neffort is made to accelerate the pace of policy \r\nimplementation. \r\n With respect to MDG 8, what is of essence is the \r\npolitical will to fulfil pledges already made. The \r\nsuccess stories in a number of developing countries \r\nshow that rapid progress towards achieving the MDGs \r\nis still possible when sound national development \r\npolicies are supported effectively by development \r\npartners and the international community with \r\nadequate financial and technical assistance. Existing \r\ninternational commitments can extend these success \r\nstories and facilitate achievement of the MDGs. \r\nApproximately two years ago, it was said that meeting \r\nthe MDGs, especially reducing poverty by one half by \r\n2015, would require raising the annual flow of official \r\ndevelopment assistance to poor countries by at least \r\n$50 or $60 billion above the prevailing level. We are \r\nmindful of the adverse consequences unleashed by the \r\nglobal financial, oil and food crises on major \r\neconomies, but $60 billion is a sum that definitely \r\npales by comparison with the domestic bailouts and \r\nother response measures adopted by the advanced \r\neconomies in the wake of the crises at home. \r\n This notwithstanding, the supportive environment \r\nfor achieving the MDGs remains strong in Ghana, and \r\nI believe this is also true in many other developing \r\ncountries. Besides the direct poverty reduction \r\nexpenditures, the Government is also implementing \r\npolicies and programmes that have high potential to \r\nsupport wealth creation and sustainable poverty \r\nreduction. For instance, in Ghana today, social \r\nprotection programmes such as the Livelihood \r\nEmpowerment Against Poverty project, which supports \r\nextremely poor households with monthly cash \r\ntransfers. The improved National Health Insurance \r\nScheme ensures quality access to health care for all at \r\naffordable or no cost. The enhanced capitation grant \r\nguarantees every child of school-going age the right to \r\nfree basic education. The supply of free exercise books \r\nand school uniforms to deprived communities \r\nencourages school attendance and ensures retention. \r\nAnd the expansion of the School Feeding Programme \r\nenhances school enrolment and improves the \r\nnutritional and health status of children. \r\n A/65/PV.9\r\n \r\n31 10-54527 \r\n \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Treki) (spoke in Arabic): I \r\nnow give the floor to His Excellency Mr. João Gomes \r\nCravinho, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and \r\nCooperation of the Portuguese Republic. \r\n Mr. Cravinho (Portugal): On behalf of my \r\nGovernment, allow me to thank you, Mr. Co-Chair, for \r\nconvening this summit on the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. It is essential that we seize this \r\nmoment to strengthen international cooperation and \r\ngalvanize action towards the implementation of the \r\ncommitments that we agreed upon ten years ago. \r\n In the aftermath of this High-level Plenary \r\nMeeting, Portugal will be hosting a ministerial meeting \r\non the mobilization of financial resources for the least \r\ndeveloped countries, in Lisbon on 2 and 3 October \r\n2010. This will be an opportunity to come back to the \r\nmain issues of this summit, to put at the core of our \r\nattention the vulnerabilities and the needs of the least \r\ndeveloped countries, and to assess the best ways in \r\nwhich we can collectively help to address them.  \r\n We must reinforce the principle of ownership and \r\nreaffirm clearly that each country is primarily \r\nresponsible for its own economic and social \r\ndevelopment. But at the same time, we must redouble \r\nefforts to generate appropriate international support \r\nmechanisms. \r\n Ten years ago, in an atmosphere of confidence \r\nand growth, the common concern for the development \r\nand dignity of all peoples in the world led to the \r\naffirmation of a shared and global commitment, the \r\nMillennium Declaration. For the past 10 years, the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) have \r\nrepresented a shared agenda, involving the mutual \r\nresponsibility and accountability of developed and \r\ndeveloping countries, guided in their policies by their \r\ncommitments to the MDGs. The political and policy \r\nrelevance of this agenda is unquestionable, and it is \r\nimperative that the MDGs remain a reference \r\nframework, thus allowing for measuring and tracking \r\nresults. \r\n Where do we stand in 2010? I believe that we can \r\nrefer both to results and to shortcomings. There has \r\nbeen significant progress by many countries, including \r\nin Africa, in many areas, but much still remains to be \r\ndone by all parties if the Goals are to be attained by \r\n2015. \r\n The world has changed dramatically since the \r\nMillennium Declaration was adopted, and the forces of \r\nchange have accelerated with the financial crisis that \r\nwe have experienced in the past couple of years. The \r\ngeostrategic balance and the development paradigm are \r\nnow very different from what we faced 10 years ago \r\nwhen we adopted the MDGs. Developed economies are \r\nstruggling with growth and deficits while, all over, \r\nemerging economies are influencing the world \r\neconomy and playing an increasing role at the global \r\nlevel. Clearly, we now live in a multi-polar world, \r\nalthough our institutional frameworks and even our \r\nlanguage and mindsets still remain to be updated to this \r\nreality.  \r\n In this new international context, a much greater \r\nrole must be taken on by organizations of regional \r\nintegration in the emerging global governance \r\narchitecture. These organizations constitute the best \r\nframework in which to voice concerns and put forward \r\nproposals that reflect different experiences and \r\nparticular ways of facing the challenges ahead of us. \r\nThe complexity of the world obliges us to test new \r\nconcepts for action and to take advantage of diversity.  \r\n The clear North-South divide in which the old \r\ndevelopment paradigm was embedded is now no longer \r\nso evident. The sooner we adapt to this reality, the \r\nbetter we will collectively manage the many global \r\nchallenges that stand before us. \r\n In the next five years, we must also address new \r\nand global challenges, such as the increased impact of \r\nclimate change, the financial and economic crisis and \r\nfood security. New geopolitical tensions in different \r\nregions are conditioning the development of hundreds \r\nof millions of people. These have become critical for \r\nthe MDGs and for the post-2015 agenda. While some \r\nof these challenges call for a longer-term involvement, \r\nwe cannot afford to postpone action. \r\n First, on climate change: its impacts, particularly \r\non the most vulnerable countries, such as the least \r\ndeveloped countries and small island developing \r\nStates, are increasingly evident. Every day, the \r\nnegative effects of climate change claim thousands of \r\nhuman lives and important livelihood stocks. The very \r\nexistence of some island States is even threatened. \r\nBuilding resilience and reducing vulnerabilities to \r\nclimate change effects is therefore vital. \r\n Portugal is strongly involved in the global effort \r\non renewable energies, and we believe that low-carbon \r\nA/65/PV.9  \r\n \r\n10-54527 32 \r\n \r\ndevelopment strategies are a key feature of sustainable \r\ngrowth and will significantly contribute to attaining the \r\nMDGs. To this end, Portugal remains committed to \r\ndeveloping a competitive, knowledge-based, inclusive \r\nand eco-efficient global economy, contributing to the \r\nimplementation of adaptation and mitigation actions, in \r\nparticular in small island developing States, least \r\ndeveloped countries and on the African continent, in \r\nthe framework of the fast start financing that was \r\nagreed upon in Copenhagen. \r\n Another important challenge is the financial and \r\neconomic crisis and its impact and consequences, \r\nespecially, but not only, for the least developed \r\ncountries. The effects of this are of various types, from \r\ntrade to investment and financing. Nevertheless, I \r\nwould like to particularly highlight the deep structural \r\nchanges that affect the way we look upon economic \r\ngrowth and development over the next few decades. It \r\nis evident that a new paradigm for our global economy \r\nis needed, and such a paradigm cannot be dissociated \r\nfrom greater justice and equity in the use of resources \r\nand in the distribution of wealth.  \r\n In this context, the MDGs constitute an essential \r\nframework for our common future. This must remain \r\nuppermost in our minds as we all strive to reach the \r\nMDG targets by 2015, and that is why mobilizing \r\nfinancial resources, domestic or external, traditional or \r\ninnovative, is essential at this stage. \r\n While keeping our aid pledges and working for \r\nincreased quantity and quality of official development \r\nassistance, Portugal supports the ongoing work on \r\ninnovative sources of financing, and we join our voice \r\nto others before us in calling for the creation of a new \r\ntax on financial transactions, a tax allocated to \r\ndevelopment, including the fight against climate \r\nchange. \r\n My final word goes to the role of the emerging \r\neconomies and new actors in cooperation in achieving \r\nthe MDGs by 2015. Due to its own historic experience, \r\nPortugal is particularly well-positioned to understand \r\nthe spirit of solidarity that should guide cooperation \r\nwith developing countries. The current aid architecture \r\nis evolving, quite rightly, to incorporate the \r\ncontributions and opportunities that arise from the \r\ninvolvement of emerging economies. We stand ready to \r\nengage in a constructive dialogue with them, open to \r\nthe concerns of the poorest countries. Let me assure \r\nyou that Portugal continues to be fully committed to \r\nthe MDGs. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): I \r\nnow give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Jorge Lara \r\nCastro, Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of the \r\nRepublic of Paraguay. \r\n Mr. Lara Castro (Paraguay) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nToday’s world is truly in a process of transition \r\ntowards a new world order. Global change is \r\naccelerating, and the financial, energy, social and \r\nenvironmental crises have revealed the contradictions, \r\nconflicts and strategic interests of the great Powers, as \r\nwell as the weaknesses of dependent countries and \r\ncountries of intermediate development. There is talk of \r\nstrategic alliances at various levels within these \r\ninterdependent relationships and of failed States.  \r\n Paraguay is among those nation States that, over \r\nthe course of history, have fallen prey to various \r\nfactors that made them vulnerable, given their \r\ngeographic situation and historical experiences. As a \r\nlandlocked State, Paraguay has been weakened by a \r\nhistoric model of socio-economic development based \r\non the looting of its natural and strategic resources and \r\nadministered through relations of structural \r\ndependence.  \r\n Our country has one of the largest freshwater \r\nreserves, the Guaraní aquifer, and many other valuable \r\nwater resources that we share with our neighbours. \r\nThese strategic resources require genuine energy \r\nintegration to foster capacities to produce clean and \r\nrenewable energy on a fair and equitable basis for all.  \r\n Paraguay’s goal is to focus on sustainable \r\ndevelopment that will meet our present needs without \r\ncompromising the resources available of future \r\ngenerations. Paraguay believes that sustainable human \r\ndevelopment is possible to the extent that the planet \r\nitself is sustainable. Living in harmony with Mother \r\nEarth must be an imperative for all peoples and a \r\nhistoric responsibility towards future generations.  \r\n At the international level, globalization poses a \r\nchallenge to countries like Paraguay, and all the more \r\nso in a world of unequal relationships where developed \r\neconomies weigh heavily on developing economies. \r\nThis situation, at the dawn of the twenty-first century, \r\nentails various responsibilities but only one common \r\nobjective — that of sharing the effort to uphold the \r\nhumanity of our peoples.  \r\n A/65/PV.9\r\n \r\n33 10-54527 \r\n \r\n For Paraguay, which has been a Member of this \r\nOrganization from the outset, and in particular for the \r\ncurrent Government of President Fernando Lugo, the \r\nprinciples and purpose of maintaining international \r\npeace and security, established in the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, are crucial. We are certain that only an \r\neffective multilateral discussion of such problems as \r\nthe fight against poverty, pandemics, terrorism, \r\ninternational organized crime and inequalities among \r\nnations, as well as the growing threat of the loss of \r\ncultural identities and other global threats, such as \r\nclimate change, will enable us to design and implement \r\nan agenda to promote these important goals.  \r\n It is therefore politically important for global \r\nleaders to heighten their awareness of the need to \r\naddress these challenges and commitments. A key \r\ncomponent and catalyst for the renewed United Nations \r\nagenda are the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs), which we adopted 10 years ago as a synthesis \r\nof all the proposals made at our high-level summits of \r\nthe 1990s. Through these Goals, we salvaged and \r\nrenewed the commitments, values and principles of our \r\nUnited Nations. Meeting the Millennium Development \r\nGoals and implementing the necessary actions to do so \r\nwill require, first, cooperation, solidarity and \r\nintegration; secondly, international social justice; and \r\nthirdly, human rights and democracy.  \r\n Thus, the Millennium Development Goals recall \r\nthe commitments made both at the level of our \r\nGovernments as well as within the United Nations \r\ndevelopment system. It is thus, too, that we conclude \r\nthat declarations are not sufficient, but that we must \r\nfurther define these commitments on the basis of \r\nspecific responsibilities and give them substance. \r\n The noble Millennium Development Goals \r\nrepresent the broadest consensus ever achieved by \r\nhumankind on how to improve the quality of life of the \r\ncitizens of the world over a short period of time. Today, \r\nthat time is shorter than ever, as we are now counting \r\ndown the days. Only 1,825 remain.  \r\n Paraguay reaffirms its commitment to continuing \r\nto strive to meet the established Goals. By shouldering \r\nits responsibility for the MDGs, our Government has \r\nworked in a participatory manner with representatives \r\nof the public sector, the private sector and civil society \r\nin developing a draft public policy on social \r\ndevelopment for the period 2010-2020. The 2020 plan, \r\nknown as “Paraguay for All”, provides the guiding \r\nframework of our current Government’s social policies, \r\nand is based on four main elements.  \r\n The first concerns universal access to social \r\ngoods and services provided by the State, and is \r\nfounded on the recognition of the peoples’ right to \r\nuniversal access to quality social goods and services. \r\nThe second element addresses the poor, excluded and \r\nvulnerable population, whose access to universal social \r\nservices has diminished. In designing specific policies, \r\nwe seek to progressively ensure greater equality in \r\naccess to social services. The third element provides \r\nfor an inclusive development model that encourages \r\nsocial and economic equity among the population. The \r\nfinal element is aimed at strengthening institutions and \r\nimproving the effectiveness of social investment.  \r\n With regard to the progress made and challenges \r\nencountered in meeting the Millennium Development \r\nGoals in Paraguay, next year we will celebrate our \r\nbicentennial. We hope to celebrate that important event \r\nwith a significant reduction in the level of extreme \r\npoverty, pursuant to prior commitments made by our \r\ncountry’s previous representatives.  \r\n However, as a result of the State’s lengthy \r\nperiods of delinquency, we have accrued a significant \r\nsocial deficit in Paraguay. In Paraguay, we refer to \r\nalmost two and a half decades — the 1980s, 1990s and \r\npart of the first decade of the twenty-first century — as \r\nlost decades. Our gross domestic product decreased \r\nduring that time and social policy was more a matter of \r\nrhetoric than of real action on the ground. As a result, \r\nour attainment of the Goals has been delayed. \r\n Both Government and civil society have \r\nunderstood the validity of the arguments favouring \r\nmore and better social investment to eradicate poverty. \r\nThe underpinning ethical argument is that the \r\nuniversalization of human rights must constitute the \r\nbedrock of a nation that seeks to ensure equity and \r\nequality for its citizens. The political argument is that \r\nsocial investment is an instrument to promote social \r\ncohesion and democratic governance. Finally, the \r\neconomic argument is that social investment is a \r\npowerful tool for economic and productive growth in \r\nthe medium and the long terms. It is therefore \r\nimportant for developed countries to cooperate with \r\ndeveloping countries through innovative financing \r\nmechanisms. \r\n While the MDGs are more than the work of \r\nGovernments, we are convinced that by 2013, when \r\nA/65/PV.9  \r\n \r\n10-54527 34 \r\n \r\nour Government will have completed its mandate, we \r\nwill have brought change to Paraguay as it becomes a \r\nmore prosperous, equitable and sustainable country \r\nwith a comprehensive social policy focused on \r\nterritorial coverage and enshrined in a stronger, \r\ninstitutionalized and transparent public administration \r\nthat responds to needs and demands without exception. \r\n The change to which we are committed will \r\ninclude people living in poverty in the development \r\nprocess in order to improve their quality of life, \r\ngenerate comprehensive development, promote and \r\nbuild capacity to facilitate access to employment, \r\neradicate illiteracy, and guarantee food security and \r\nuniversal access to health care, primary schooling, safe \r\nwater and basic sanitation. In turn, as a priority matter, \r\nwe shall establish mechanisms to guarantee the rights \r\nof children, adolescents and indigenous peoples.  \r\n With respect to education, our explicit \r\ncommitment is to achieve an illiteracy rate of only \r\n1.9 per cent by 2013. We shall complete the process \r\nlaunched at the advent of democracy in Paraguay in the \r\nfield of access to education, and in the coming years \r\nwe will focus on improving the quality of education.  \r\n In the area of gender equality and empowerment \r\nof women, we can say that there have been highs and \r\nlows. We have almost achieved gender equality in \r\nbasic and secondary education, but with respect to the \r\nlabour market and women in political positions, there \r\nis still room for improvement in order to achieve \r\ngreater equality between men and women. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss): I am sorry, but \r\nspeeches are timed to be five minutes. You have \r\nspoken for 15 minutes now, and there are many other \r\ninterventions. \r\n Mr. Castro (Paraguay): I will finish in two \r\nminutes. \r\n(spoke in Spanish) \r\n In the context of our Government’s programme, \r\ncivil society organizations are crucial in supporting the \r\npolicies of structural reform and promoting social \r\nconditions that will guarantee fundamental rights \r\nthrough the dovetailing of the Government’s work with \r\ncivil society. \r\n With respect to the environment, at the upcoming \r\nsixteenth Conference of the Parties to the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change to \r\ntake place in Cancún, Mexico, our negotiators will \r\nagain, as they did Copenhagen, undertake the urgent \r\nand overdue mission of making real change for the \r\nfuture of humankind. \r\n To conclude, we wish to emphasize that by 2013, \r\nthe Government of President Fernando Lugo Méndez, \r\nthrough the public policy for social development \r\nknown as 2020 Plan: Paraguay for All, to which I \r\nreferred to at the start of my statement, has committed \r\nto deploying its greatest efforts to meet and overcome \r\nour historic challenges and to fulfil our commitments \r\nmade at the Millennium Summit. Having learned from \r\nthe errors of the past and now building on present \r\nachievements, we firmly believe that we are sowing \r\nfertile fields so that our future generations will inherit \r\na better world.  \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Treki): May I remind \r\nspeakers that statements should not exceed five \r\nminutes. We have too many speakers on our list. \r\n(spoke in Arabic) \r\n I now give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Paul \r\nBadji, Permanent Representative of the Republic of \r\nSenegal. \r\n Mr. Badji (Senegal) (spoke in French): Assessing \r\nthe progress made in implementing the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) reminds us once again \r\nthat our ambitious mission to build a world free of the \r\nscourges of poverty and famine has not yet been \r\naccomplished. In the unusual current circumstances, \r\nwhere the combined effects of the recent crises \r\ncontinue to burden the economies of developing \r\ncountries and our States’ capacities, this assessment \r\nrecalls us to our duty to act as soon as possible in the \r\nfinal stretch towards 2015. It is not too late to \r\ntransform the act of faith symbolized by the MDGs \r\ninto positive and tangible results that will benefit all, \r\nincluding the wealthy countries.  \r\n My country remains committed to that path and \r\nintends to pursue bold reforms and the implementation \r\nof necessary policies to improve the daily living \r\nconditions of its people, in particular the most \r\nvulnerable groups. \r\n That is why Senegal has made progress in such \r\nareas as the fight against malnutrition, education, \r\ncombating HIV and other infectious diseases, access to \r\ndrinking water and sanitation, the empowerment of \r\nwomen and gender equality. However, the context of \r\n A/65/PV.9\r\n \r\n35 10-54527 \r\n \r\nthe global crises could further compromise these \r\nachievements and have a negative impact on attaining \r\nthe goals. In other words, many challenges remain \r\ndespite the non-negligible achievements made. Thus, in \r\nSenegal we have undertaken to refocus our efforts and \r\nprioritize the path to success. This has led the \r\nGovernment to pursue three areas for priority \r\nintervention in order to promote development while \r\nbearing in mind new challenges. \r\n The first priority is to pursue lasting economic \r\ngrowth. It is clear that while we must strive to meet \r\nsocial demands, we must also invest in growth in order \r\nto facilitate young people’s access to employment and \r\nenable a fairer distribution of income and services, \r\nincluding to those most socially disadvantaged. We \r\nhave therefore designed our strategy and economic \r\ndevelopment guidelines for the long term, focusing in \r\nparticular on investment in human resources, high-\r\nquality major infrastructure and the promotion of a \r\nclimate conducive to unleashing private initiative. We \r\nseek to consolidate growth in order to accelerate the \r\ncreation of wealth and sustainable jobs, particularly for \r\nwomen and young people, and to strengthen the bases \r\nof long-term development, supported by a far-sighted \r\npolicy of good governance and the rule of law. \r\n Our second priority is to develop and modernize \r\nagriculture in order to eliminate the vulnerability and \r\nlack of stability that afflict the millions of individuals \r\nwho work in that sector. Since three-fourths of the \r\npopulation depends on this sector, increased \r\ninvestments will be crucial to raising productivity, \r\nwinning the fight against hunger and food security, and \r\nmaintaining employment in rural areas, thus ensuring \r\nfarmers a permanent livelihood and limiting their \r\nexodus. \r\n Our major agricultural programme for food and \r\nabundance, known as Goana — which was launched in \r\n2008 and for which we, following the success of \r\nprevious years, have started the third phase of its \r\nimplementation — reflects our desire to foster a rural \r\nrevolution. It will make agriculture a lever for the \r\neconomic promotion of farmers, in particular through \r\ntheir unionization and the establishment of rural banks, \r\nwhich will enable them to access credit and financing. \r\n Our third priority involves the acceleration and \r\nexpansion of the provision of basic social services, \r\neducation, and, above all, health care, with a particular \r\nfocus on strengthening health care systems and \r\nuniversal access to health care services. This is a \r\nprerequisite to meeting the challenge of eradicating \r\ninfectious diseases and achieving the Goals of reducing \r\nmaternal and child mortality rates, as well as \r\nimproving the food and nutrition situation. \r\n Here, I solemnly commend the excellent initiative \r\nof the Secretary-General, who had the ingenious idea \r\nof submitting to us the Global Strategy for Women’s \r\nand Children’s Health. The Strategy will certainly be \r\nan important benchmark for our collective effort to \r\ninspire the future work of States as we round this final \r\nbend. \r\n Clearly, we have no option but to work together \r\nto maintain our positive achievements and, above all, \r\nto overcome the difficulties through the pooled, \r\nconcerted and unified efforts of the international \r\ncommunity as a whole, underpinned by a global agenda \r\nin which each person can play his or her own role. \r\n It goes without saying that in this exercise, the \r\nsupport of wealthy countries and respect for \r\ncommitments undertaken in the context of various \r\npartnerships will be critical to removing the obstacles \r\nthat hamper the achievement of the MDGs. In this \r\ngreat endeavour, Senegal is more determined than ever \r\nto work with all its partners for the achievement of the \r\nbetter world to which we are so looking forward. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Treki) (spoke in Arabic): We \r\nshall now hear brief reports of the Chairs of the round \r\ntables. \r\n We begin with the Co-Chair of round table 1, Her \r\nExcellency Sheikh Hasina, Prime Minister of the \r\nPeople’s Republic of Bangladesh. \r\n Sheikh Hasina (Bangladesh): We concluded the \r\ndeliberations of round table 1 on 20 September. At the \r\noutset, I would like to thank the heads of delegations, \r\ncivil society, experts and academia for their invaluable \r\ncontribution to our discussion. The round table was a \r\nhuge success. Before summarizing our deliberations, I \r\nwould also ask Member States to set a new goal for the \r\nimplementation of what we have decided in our \r\ndeliberations. \r\n We agree that the achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), and in particular the \r\neradication of poverty, hunger and malnutrition and the \r\npromotion of gender equality, is essential to our \r\neconomic and social development efforts. Concrete \r\nnational and international actions and investments are \r\nA/65/PV.9  \r\n \r\n10-54527 36 \r\n \r\nneeded to accelerate progress towards achieving the \r\nGoals and to strengthen global partnerships for \r\ndevelopment. \r\n Member States commit to pursuing gender-\r\nsensitive policies for inclusive and equitable economic \r\ngrowth and sustainable development. Priority attention \r\nmust be given to alleviating the adverse effects on the \r\npoor, especially women, of the multiple global crises \r\nand the challenge of climate change. \r\n Actions must be comprehensive and enhance \r\nnational ownership of development processes. We \r\ncommit to mobilizing private and public sector \r\nresources, scaling-up good practices and strengthening \r\nnational and local capacity for service delivery and \r\ninfrastructure development. Such actions should be \r\nsupported by increased development assistance and \r\nreinforced by gender-sensitive monitoring and \r\naccountability mechanisms at the national level. \r\n We recognize that the promotion of gender \r\nequality and women’s human rights is a key driver for \r\nachieving all MDGs and has a multiplier effect across \r\nall sectors. We commit to the elimination of \r\ndiscrimination and violence against women, the full \r\nand equal participation of women at all levels of \r\ndecision-making processes, and the accelerated \r\nimplementation of gender-responsive laws and \r\npolicies. \r\n We agree that broad-based employment policies \r\nfor full and productive employment and decent work \r\nfor all are central to our responses. Priority attention \r\nshould focus on promoting job-intensive recovery. This \r\nwill require targeted labour market support and skills \r\ndevelopment, including programmes that enhance the \r\nfull and equal participation of women in the formal \r\neconomy. Ensuring universal access to social services \r\nand comprehensive systems of social protection at the \r\nnational level is critical to reducing poverty, hunger \r\nand inequality. Innovative and inclusive financial \r\nservices, such as microfinancing and microcredit, must \r\nbe made available to the poor, especially women. \r\n We resolve to pay much greater attention to \r\nimproving agricultural productivity and ensuring food \r\nand nutrition security in developing countries, \r\nespecially for those living in extreme poverty and \r\nhunger. Coordinated responses to the food crisis should \r\nfocus on addressing food price volatility and on \r\nadopting measures encouraging greater resilience to \r\nshocks. At the global and national levels, efforts must \r\nbe redoubled to achieve greater investment in \r\nagriculture. We must invest in smallholder agriculture \r\nthrough improved infrastructure, better access to \r\nmarkets, imports, financial services, skills, technology \r\nand reserves. It is critical to ensure that women and \r\nmarginalized groups have full and equal access to land \r\nand property. \r\n Since this is a summary statement, I will not add \r\nany further points here. What I will emphasize is the \r\nrealization of what we have resolved. Let us make \r\npoverty and gender inequality history. To that end, we \r\nmust make history today by adopting the \r\nrecommendations of round table 1 in the outcome \r\ndocument of the plenary. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): I \r\nnow give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Gert \r\nRosenthal, Permanent Representative of Guatemala to \r\nthe United Nations, who will make a presentation on \r\nbehalf of the Co-Chair of round table 2. \r\n Mr. Rosenthal (Guatemala) (spoke in Spanish): I \r\nhave the honour to present, on behalf of the President \r\nof Guatemala and the Prime Minister of Kuwait, some \r\nof the highlights of the discussions in round table 2 on \r\nmeeting the goals of health and education. The \r\nnumerous statements covered diverse points of view \r\nand issues, and no attempt has been made to \r\ndistinguish areas that gave rise to agreement from \r\nthose that did not. \r\n First, it was underscored that education and \r\nhealth go hand in hand. For instance, it is said that a \r\none-year increase in women’s education translates into \r\nan almost 10-per cent drop in infant mortality.  \r\n Second, noting that education and health are \r\ncentral to poverty reduction and to achieving all the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), most \r\nspeakers stressed that those two sectors must be closely \r\ncoordinated in national development plans.  \r\n Third, it was emphasized that inequities in health \r\nand education are a barrier to attaining the MDGs. It \r\nwas therefore felt that improving access to quality \r\neducation and health services — especially for women \r\nand girls, the residents of rural and remote areas, the \r\nvulnerable and poorest populations, and persons with \r\ndisabilities — is crucial to overcoming disparities \r\nwithin countries. \r\n Fourth, since improvements in health depend on \r\nmulti-pronged strategies, many speakers expressed \r\n A/65/PV.9\r\n \r\n37 10-54527 \r\n \r\ntheir commitment to strengthening health systems; \r\nimproving access to good health care and quality, \r\ncommunity-based sanitation interventions; increasing \r\naccess to clean water and sanitation; and expanding \r\nimmunization coverage. \r\n Fifth, in general, speakers made it clear that \r\nimportant progress has been made towards achieving \r\nuniversal primary education, stressing that many \r\ncountries have passed the 90-per cent enrolment \r\nthreshold. It must also be recognized, however, that \r\nmore attention must be paid to expanding access to all \r\nlevels of education, from early childhood to higher \r\nlevels, particularly for girls, and to improving the \r\nquality of education, including by improving teacher \r\ntraining. \r\n Sixth, one point frequently raised was the need to \r\nincrease funding for reducing maternal, child and \r\nnewborn mortality, and for achieving universal \r\nreproductive health by 2015, including by expanding \r\naccess to family planning, emergency obstetric care \r\nand skilled birth attendants. The Secretary-General’s \r\nGlobal Strategy for Women’s and Children’s Health \r\nwas warmly welcomed. \r\n Seventh, it was suggested that partnerships are \r\nthe way forward, and that we must continue working \r\ntogether, mobilizing stakeholders at all levels and \r\nacross sectors in order to align with and support \r\nGovernment-led processes, to develop and implement \r\ncomprehensive national health and education plans. \r\n It was also widely recognized that mobilizing \r\nsufficient resources remains a challenge. National and \r\ninternational financial commitments must be honoured, \r\ndespite the current financial crisis. The need to meet \r\nthe Abuja targets for health, to support large-scale \r\ninitiatives such as Muskoka and Education for All, and \r\nto explore innovative financing mechanisms was \r\nfrequently mentioned. Several delegations called for \r\nthe replenishment of the Global Fund. \r\n Lastly, the announcement of specific commitments \r\nover the next five years was welcomed. These include \r\nthe World Bank’s pledge to devote more than $600 \r\nmillion to maternal and child health, plus an additional \r\n$750 million to education, as well as Germany’s offer \r\nto provide €400 million to combat maternal and child \r\nmortality. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Treki) (spoke in Arabic): I \r\nnow give the floor to Her Excellency Mrs. Etta Banda, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Malawi, \r\nwho will make a statement on behalf of the Co-Chair \r\nof round table 3. \r\n Mrs. Banda (Malawi): I present to members the \r\nsummary of discussions held at the summit’s round \r\ntable 3, entitled “Promoting sustainable development”. \r\n Member States acknowledged the interdependence \r\nof the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and \r\naffirmed that achieving them would demand a more \r\nbalanced and coherent approach that integrates the \r\neconomic, social and environmental dimensions of \r\nsustainable development. We reiterate that eradicating \r\npoverty and enhancing the quality of life for the \r\npoorest and most vulnerable remains the overarching \r\ndevelopment objective. \r\n Sustainable development is the answer to the \r\nMDGs. Social, economic and environmental policies \r\nneed to be better integrated, including through a green \r\neconomy approach. Linkages between environment and \r\ndevelopment are therefore critical and must be \r\nstrengthened in preparation for the United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development in 2012.  \r\n National ownership of the Development Goals is \r\ncrucial, and a commitment to improved governance \r\nessential to more effectively promoting integrated \r\ndevelopment planning, ensuring broad participation \r\namong major stakeholders, and strengthening \r\ninstitutions and national capacities to more effectively \r\ndeliver services. Greater attention should be given to \r\nnational sustainable development strategies to promote \r\ntransformation towards sustainable development. \r\n Water plays a central role in ensuring increased \r\nfood production to combat hunger, reduce mortality, \r\nfacilitate education and promote gender equality and \r\nthe empowerment of women. Member States \r\nacknowledged the importance of the supply side to \r\nprogress in implementing the MDGs, and agreed that it \r\nmust be adequately addressed if all is to go well. \r\nMember States committed to enhancing water access \r\nand affordability and to improving sanitation services. \r\nIntegrated water resources management is central to \r\nensuring sustainable and equitable access to safe \r\ndrinking water and basic sanitation. \r\n We resolved to pay greater attention to \r\nsustainable urbanization. Cities must become \r\nenvironmentally sustainable, socially responsible and \r\neconomically productive. Improving the lives of slum-\r\nA/65/PV.9  \r\n \r\n10-54527 38 \r\n \r\ndwellers is essential to achieving the MDGs. We \r\ntherefore commit to addressing the most fundamental \r\nrights of slum-dwellers, including access to water and \r\nsanitation, adequate shelter, nutrition, health care and \r\neducation. \r\n We underscore the urgent need for investment in \r\nour ecological infrastructure, including ecosystems and \r\nbiodiversity, taking into account the importance of \r\nnatural resources, including forests, in combating \r\nclimate change. We welcome the progress in \r\nintegrating the ecosystem approach, biodiversity and \r\nwater resources to ensure environmental sustainability. \r\nWe also welcome support for the incorporation of \r\nsustainable forest management into national \r\ndevelopment plans through fiscal and non-fiscal \r\nincentives to Governments. \r\n We reaffirm that strong global partnership and the \r\nsupport of the donor community and development \r\ninstitutions are vital to progress in achieving the \r\nMDGs. Such support should be mobilized to promote \r\nthe transfer of skills, improve national capacities to \r\ndeliver services, and facilitate technology transfer. \r\nInternational support should be based on priorities \r\nidentified at the national level. The improved \r\ncoordination of existing initiatives is crucial at all \r\nlevels. \r\n Finally, we recognize the importance of peace \r\nand stability as essential preconditions for sustainable \r\ndevelopment and the improvement of the quality of life \r\nfor all. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): \r\nThe Assembly will now hear an address by the Co-\r\nChair of round table 4, Her Excellency Ms. Tarja \r\nHalonen, President of the Republic of Finland. \r\n President Halonen: It is an honour to present, on \r\nbehalf of His Excellency Mr. Danilo Türk, President of \r\nSlovenia, and myself, a summary of the rich \r\ndiscussions on emerging issues and evolving \r\napproaches. I also convey our warm thanks to all the \r\nparticipants. \r\n First, regarding climate change, participants \r\nshared the view that the transition to a green economy \r\nwith high growth and reduced greenhouse gas \r\nemissions is both necessary and feasible. Several \r\nparticipants welcomed the launch of the High-level \r\nPanel on Global Sustainability in that regard. \r\n Several participants stressed that adaptation and \r\nmitigation will require additional financial assistance, \r\nbeyond existing official development assistance \r\ncommitments, sharing technological know-how and \r\nbuilding institutional capacity. It was noted that public \r\nfinancing is not enough to cover adaptation and \r\nmitigation needs, but the contribution of the business \r\nsector, as well as non-governmental organizations, is \r\nrequired. \r\n The urgent need to increase access to modern and \r\nsustainable energy services was highlighted. \r\n Secondly, a more comprehensive approach to the \r\nglobal financial and economic crisis was called for. \r\nWith a fragile and uneven recovery and the threat of an \r\nunprecedented global jobs crisis, participants called for \r\na rethink of the current economic development \r\nparadigm. The immediate challenge is to implement \r\nappropriate policies to cement the recovery, strengthen \r\nresilience against future shocks, and gradually \r\nwithdraw stimulus policies. \r\n A long-term solution to the crisis will require \r\naddressing its root causes, including reviewing \r\nregulatory oversight, continuing the ongoing reform of \r\nthe financial and economic system, and placing job \r\ncreation and decent work at the heart of \r\nmacroeconomic policies.  \r\n Providing basic social protection floors is an \r\nimportant element in combating poverty and growing \r\ninequalities within countries. While emerging from the \r\ncrisis may take time, job creation is an immediate and \r\ncritically important task. The need to fully tap the \r\npotential of civil society and the private sector, \r\nespecially in providing innovative solutions, was \r\nstressed. \r\n Thirdly, the importance of food security has very \r\noften been underestimated. Medium- and long-term \r\ninvestment needs to be scaled up to feed a growing \r\nworld population and to improve rural livelihoods. \r\nSuch investment should focus on smallholder farmers, \r\nparticularly women, to enable them to build profitable \r\nbusinesses and to promote access to nutritious food for \r\nthe most vulnerable. \r\n There are also other major emerging issues, such \r\nas enhancing accountability on all sides and increasing \r\npolicy coherence, which require our urgent collective \r\nattention. \r\n A/65/PV.9\r\n \r\n39 10-54527 \r\n \r\n The human and social dimensions of policy \r\nchoices and indices are easily forgotten. For example, \r\neconomic growth helps people best if it increases jobs. \r\n Other issues emphasized include the nexus \r\nbetween conflict and development, energy systems and \r\nenergy access, cross-border movements of people \r\nseeking jobs and a better life, and the importance of \r\nexploring innovative sources of financing while \r\nhonouring official development assistance commitments. \r\nAlso, the fact that preventing and responding early to \r\nconflict is less expensive, and more human, than crisis \r\nmanagement, was mentioned many times. \r\n In summary, the overall sense of the round table \r\nwas that there is an urgent need for a new development \r\nparadigm, with environmental sustainability and social \r\ninclusion at its centre. A true partnership and a \r\ncoordinated approach are needed among all \r\nstakeholders: Governments, civil society, research and \r\nacademia, and the private sector. There was a broadly \r\nheld view that the United Nations has a key role to play \r\nin a rapidly changing and interdependent world with \r\nmany evolving challenges that call for global \r\nresponses. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Treki) (spoke in Arabic): I \r\nnow give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Winston \r\nBaldwin Spencer, Prime Minister of Antigua and \r\nBarbuda, Co-Chair of round table 5. \r\n Mr. Spencer (Antigua and Barbuda): I am \r\nhonoured to present a summary of the discussion in \r\nround table 5, on addressing the needs of the most \r\nvulnerable. \r\n It was observed that the promotion and protection \r\nof human rights is a prerequisite for the achievement of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). We must \r\nspare no effort to advance equality and non-\r\ndiscrimination with regard to gender, age, disability, \r\nethnicity, geographic location and HIV/AIDS status. It \r\nwas noted that to answer the question of who the most \r\nvulnerable are, and what the causes of their \r\nvulnerability are, we need more disaggregated data. \r\n The representatives of small island developing \r\nStates and landlocked countries pointed out their \r\nspecial vulnerability to climate change, natural \r\ndisasters and high energy and transportation costs. To \r\nfight climate change, more investment should be made \r\nin mitigation and adaptation mechanisms, reducing \r\ndependency on fossil fuels and increasing investment \r\nin renewable energies. \r\n The international community is urged to assist \r\nvulnerable countries, least developed countries, \r\nlandlocked developing countries and small island \r\ndeveloping States in addressing their specific needs \r\nand development challenges. Urgent action must focus \r\non effective aid and trade policies, the fulfilment of all \r\nofficial development assistance commitments and \r\nfurther mobilization of financial resources for \r\ndevelopment, including capacity-building and \r\ntechnology transfer. Countries in conflict and post-\r\nconflict situations are especially vulnerable, and are in \r\nneed of renewed focus on peacebuilding, including \r\nconsolidation of State institutions and assistance to \r\ninternally displaced people and refugees. \r\n Member States recognize that ensuring equitable \r\naccess to economic opportunities and social services \r\nfor the poor and those in vulnerable situations is vital \r\nfor the achievement of the MDGs. We should devote \r\nadequate resources to tackling basic sources of \r\nvulnerability, such as lack of access to adequate \r\nnutrition, education, skills training, health services and \r\ndecent jobs. More efforts are needed to ensure access \r\nto financial services, including microfinancing, credit \r\nand insurance for all, especially those in vulnerable \r\nsituations. \r\n Governments also underscore that comprehensive \r\nsystems of social protection are essential to reducing \r\ninequality and vulnerability, to achieving development \r\ngoals and to shielding those most vulnerable in times \r\nof economic crisis. Some also noted that conditional \r\nand unconditional cash transfers can be effective in \r\nreducing vulnerability. More international cooperation \r\nis needed to support policies and programmes aimed at \r\nreducing the vulnerability of people living with \r\nHIV/AIDS, through prevention, treatment, care and \r\nsupport strategies, including special efforts to address \r\nstigmatization and discrimination. \r\n Vulnerable groups, especially women and \r\nminorities, should be empowered and represented in \r\nnational parliaments and included in the development \r\nprocess. Vulnerability in the context of peace \r\nnegotiations was also noted. The special needs of \r\nPalestinian refugees merit special attention. \r\n In conclusion, we all agree that, without \r\naddressing the special needs of the most vulnerable \r\ncountries and people, the MDGs cannot be achieved. \r\nA/65/PV.9  \r\n \r\n10-54527 40 \r\n \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): I \r\nnow give the floor to Her Excellency Mrs. Tiina \r\nIntelmann, Permanent Representative of the Republic \r\nof Estonia, who will make a presentation on behalf of \r\nthe Co-Chair of round table 6. \r\n Mrs. Intelmann (Estonia): On behalf of the \r\nPresident of Estonia, Co-Chair of round table 6, I am \r\npleased to provide a summary of the round table \r\ndiscussions on widening and strengthening partnerships. \r\n It was acknowledged that progress has been made \r\nin achieving the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs), especially in the area of reducing extreme \r\npoverty. However, it was also acknowledged that the \r\nrecent global climate and food crisis has had an \r\nadverse impact on development. Effective partnerships \r\nare now more crucial to achieving the MDGs, and there \r\nwas commitment to enhancing the global partnership \r\nfor development and accelerating efforts to deliver and \r\nfully implement existing commitments, as called for in \r\nMDG 8. \r\n It was emphasized that responsibility lies with \r\nboth developed and developing countries. Developed \r\ncountries were called on to support development by \r\nmeeting their commitments, as set by the Gleneagles \r\nmeeting of the Group of 8, the United Nations targets \r\nof 0.7 per cent of gross national income (GNI) by 2015 \r\nand 0.5 per cent of GNI by 2010, with clear and \r\naccountable timelines. In addition to traditional \r\ndevelopment cooperation, the increasing importance of \r\nSouth-South cooperation was stressed, and the fact that \r\ndevelopment has become more globalized was \r\nwelcomed. In this sense, the role of civil society and \r\nthe private sector, through greater investment, \r\nnon-governmental organizations and local communities, \r\nwas acknowledged. Participants emphasized that \r\nincreasing the effectiveness and quality of aid, \r\nincluding reducing the fragmentation of aid, in \r\naccordance with the Paris Declaration and the Accra \r\nAgenda, was most essential. \r\n Ultimately, Governments are responsible for their \r\nown development. National strategies and leadership, \r\neffective policies for reaching the poorest, increased \r\ndomestic revenues, promoting growth and \r\nstrengthening capacity-building were mentioned as \r\ncritical to development. \r\n The call was made to treat development as a \r\nhuman right for all. The role of women, with an equal \r\nvoice and under equal conditions, was also mentioned \r\nas essential for long-term development. Another \r\nprecondition for effective aid and development was a \r\nstable and secure environment. Therefore, the rule of \r\nlaw, the fight against crime, corruption, terrorism and \r\ntrafficking in illegal drugs, weapons and human beings \r\nwere presented as most essential if we are to have \r\naccountable and effective institutions. \r\n A fair and equitable multilateral trading system \r\nremains critical to strengthening the global partnership \r\nfor development by ensuring market access through \r\nfull and unconditional, duty-free and quota-free \r\ntreatment for exports originating in least developed \r\ncountries. The timely and development-oriented \r\nconclusion of the Doha Round of trade negotiations \r\nwould be essential.  \r\n It was recognized that many countries are in debt \r\ndistress and that debt initiatives must be expanded \r\nbeyond the poorest countries and strengthened to strive \r\nfor more broadly applicable sovereign debt work-out \r\nmechanisms. The special needs of small island \r\ndeveloping States and least developed countries were \r\nrecognized, especially their vulnerability to external \r\nshocks, for example natural disasters, and to the \r\nnegative effects of climate change.  \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): \r\nThe General Assembly will now turn to draft resolution \r\nA/65/L.1, entitled “Keeping the promise: united to \r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals”. We shall \r\nnow proceed to consider the draft resolution. \r\n In connection with draft resolution A/65/L.1, I \r\nwish to put on record the following statement of \r\nfinancial implications, in accordance with rule 153 of \r\nthe rules of procedure of the General Assembly. Under \r\nthe terms of the draft resolution’s operative paragraph, \r\nthe General Assembly would adopt the outcome \r\ndocument of the High-level Plenary Meeting of the \r\nsixty-fifth session of the General Assembly on the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. \r\n In paragraph 77 (p) of the draft outcome \r\ndocument, heads of State and Government would \r\ncommit themselves to accelerating progress in order to \r\nachieve Goal 7, including through working towards a \r\nsuccessful United Nations conference on sustainable \r\ndevelopment in 2012. \r\n Further, in paragraph 79 of the draft outcome \r\ndocument, heads of State and Government would \r\nrequest the President of the sixty-eighth session of the \r\n A/65/PV.9\r\n \r\n41 10-54527 \r\n \r\nGeneral Assembly to organize a special event in 2013 \r\nto follow up on efforts made towards achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. \r\n At the present time, there is no clarity on the \r\nscope, modalities, format and organization of the \r\nUnited Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment in 2012 and the special event in 2013 \r\nwhich could enable the Secretariat to determine the full \r\npotential financial implications for the biennium 2012-\r\n2013. Once the General Assembly takes a specific \r\ndecision at a later stage regarding the scope, \r\nmodalities, format and organization of the United \r\nNations Conference on Sustainable Development and \r\nthe special event, the Secretary-General would at that \r\ntime submit statements of programme budget \r\nimplications to the General Assembly. \r\n The General Assembly will now take a decision \r\non draft resolution A/65/L.1, entitled, “Keeping the \r\npromise: united to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals”. May I take it that the Assembly \r\nwishes to adopt the draft resolution? \r\n Draft resolution A/65/L.1 was adopted (resolution \r\n65/1). \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): I \r\ncongratulate members on having adopted resolution \r\n65/1. \r\n I should like to express sincere appreciation to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki, President of \r\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session and \r\nCo-Chair of this High-level Plenary Meeting, for his \r\nextraordinary efforts to make this Meeting a \r\nresounding success. He deserves a round of applause. \r\n My appreciation is also extended to Ambassador \r\nCarsten Staur of Denmark and Ambassador Paul Badji \r\nof Senegal, who have so ably and patiently conducted \r\nthe discussions and complex negotiations in the \r\ninformal consultations on draft resolution A/65/L.1, \r\nand to all Member States for their valuable \r\ncontributions to the successful completion of the \r\noutcome document. \r\n I will reserve my substantive remarks for the \r\nclosing of the meeting. \r\n I now yield the floor to His Excellency Mr. Ali \r\nAbdussalam Treki, President of the General Assembly \r\nat its sixty-fourth session and Co-Chair of the High-\r\nlevel Plenary Meeting. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Treki) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nThese past three days have shown a common spirit in \r\nthe international community to meet the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) by 2015. Many of you, \r\ncolleagues, have spoken of the progress you have made \r\nand the challenges that still confront you. But all of \r\nyou agree that achieving the MDGs by 2015 is possible \r\nif we are committed to do so.  \r\n The agreement which we adopted today as \r\nresolution 65/1 captures this commitment and the \r\nresolve of all members to achieve the Goals. It was the \r\nresult of consensus, inclusiveness and openness and is \r\nan expression of the global partnership that is \r\nhighlighted in MDG 8. It conveys the sense of urgency \r\nthat only five years remain, and it outlines an agenda \r\nfor action with specific ideas to ensure the \r\nimplementation of our commitments to attain the \r\nGoals. \r\n This agreement recognizes that national \r\nownership and responsibility for establishing priorities \r\nand the strategies needed to achieve them is the \r\nfoundation of development. It is also highlights, \r\nthroughout the resolution, that inclusive and equitable \r\ngrowth and the promotion of trade and investment are \r\nnecessary for reaching the MDGs and sustaining \r\npoverty reduction. It recognizes women as important \r\nagents of development and that gender equality and the \r\nempowerment of women have a multiplier impact on \r\nall the Goals. \r\n It focuses on smallholder agriculture as an \r\nimportant basis for countries to develop the \r\ninfrastructure to feed their own populations and for the \r\npoor to lift themselves out of poverty. It goes beyond \r\nthe specific Goals on health and calls for the \r\nstrengthening of health systems to deliver equitable, \r\naccessible and high-quality health care services to all. \r\nIt also recognizes the special needs of Africa in \r\nachieving the MDGs, as well as those of least \r\ndeveloped countries elsewhere. \r\n I would like to thank you all for your support and \r\nfor your commitment to reaching this agreement before \r\nthe start of the summit. We should be proud of this \r\nachievement; we need to use it as a common platform \r\nfrom which to strive to achieve all the MDGs by 2015. \r\n I cannot fail to express, on behalf of all \r\nparticipants, my thanks and appreciation to His \r\nExcellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon as well as \r\nto members of the Secretariat and all of those working \r\nA/65/PV.9  \r\n \r\n10-54527 42 \r\n \r\nwith it for the support that they have provided \r\nthroughout our efforts to achieve these goals. \r\n In closing, I should like to express our \r\nappreciation to the President of the General Assembly \r\nfor the efforts that he has made. I wish him every \r\nsuccess in his future endeavours. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): I \r\nnow give the floor to the Secretary-General of the \r\nUnited Nations, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon. \r\n The Secretary-General (spoke in French): My \r\ncongratulations go to you all. This summit has laid a \r\nsolid foundation for the progress we need in our quest \r\nto achieve the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs) by the internationally agreed deadline of \r\n2015. Through the participation of a large number of \r\nheads of State or Government and leaders from civil \r\nsociety, the private sector and the philanthropic \r\ncommunity, this event has galvanized worldwide \r\nattention. The summit outcome document (resolution \r\n65/1) sends a clear sign that you remain committed to \r\nthe Goals even in a difficult international environment. \r\n Special thanks go to His Excellency Mr. Ali \r\nAbdussalam Treki, President of the General Assembly \r\nat its sixty-fourth session, His Excellency Mr. Joseph \r\nDeiss, President of the General Assembly at its sixty-\r\nfifth session, and the Co-Chairs of the round tables. I \r\nalso commend the organizers and participants of the \r\nmore than 80 side events, which added great vibrancy \r\nto the summit. \r\n The two co-facilitators — Ambassador Staur of \r\nDenmark and Ambassador Badji of Senegal — worked \r\ntirelessly over the past few months to reach agreement \r\non the summit outcome document. \r\n Last but not least, I would like to express my \r\ndeepest appreciation to the members of the MDG \r\nAdvocacy Group. Their participation has brought a \r\nnew level of hope to the MDG Action Agenda. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\nThat Agenda gives us a road map for dramatically \r\naccelerating MDG progress. Many of you have already \r\ncommitted to launching new initiatives. Others have \r\npledged to do so in the near future. I am very \r\nencouraged to note that many Member States used this \r\nsummit to announce concrete support. \r\n All the key issues and ideas have been on the \r\ntable, were part of the discussion and are now part of \r\nthe outcome document. Jobs, and especially green jobs, \r\ninclusive and sustainable development, the need for a \r\nsuccessful Doha Trade Round outcome, smallholder \r\nfarming, food and nutrition security, inclusive financial \r\nservices, women’s health and empowerment, a \r\nrejuvenated global partnership: all of this and more is \r\nwhere it should be: at the forefront of our attention as \r\nwe ready ourselves for the push that begins now — this \r\nvery minute. \r\n In the past, we have seen that when the spotlights \r\nare switched off, world attention quickly moves on to \r\nother issues. With only five years left, we cannot let \r\nthat happen. Between now and 2015, we must make \r\nsure that promises made became promises kept. The \r\nconsequences of doing otherwise are profound: death, \r\nillness, despair, needless suffering and lost \r\nopportunities for millions upon millions of people. We \r\nmust hold each other accountable. The United Nations \r\nsystem and I personally will do our utmost to promote \r\naccountability on all sides. \r\n The MDGs were never meant to be a one-way \r\nstreet: something that rich countries do for poor ones. \r\nQuite the contrary. Our longstanding work for \r\ndevelopment in general has always been based on \r\nglobal solidarity, on a shared interest, a powerful sense \r\nof community and linked fates in an interconnected \r\nworld. \r\n Much of our focus has been on 2015. In a rapidly \r\nchanging international environment, we must also look \r\nahead beyond the deadline for the Goals. And so, in \r\nresponse to your request in the outcome document, I \r\nintend to initiate a process that will result in a post-\r\n2015 framework for the development work of the \r\nUnited Nations. I ask that all of you also consider the \r\nlong term even as you intensify your efforts to achieve \r\nthe goals in the next five years. \r\n Thank you again for your role in making this \r\nsummit a great success. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): I \r\nthank the Secretary-General for his statement. \r\n We shall now continue with the remaining \r\nspeakers for the High-level Plenary Meeting. \r\n Given the lateness of the hour, I kindly remind \r\nspeakers to respect the time limit that has been agreed. \r\n A/65/PV.9\r\n \r\n43 10-54527 \r\n \r\n I now give the floor to the observer of the \r\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and \r\nDevelopment. \r\n Mr. Boucher (Organization for Economic \r\nCooperation and Development): With five years to go, \r\nwith famine and poverty still rampant, we face a \r\ndefining moment for development. Can we learn from \r\nthe past, from both our successes and our failures, and \r\nimprove on our historic commitment to achieve \r\nsubstantial progress by 2015? \r\n Over the past decade, hundreds of millions of \r\npeople have emerged from poverty to build new lives \r\nbased on their own energy and enterprise. But gains \r\nhave been uneven within and across borders. Too many \r\nmothers and children still die during childbirth. Fragile \r\nand conflict-ridden States have yet to achieve a single \r\nMillennium Development Goal. In parts of Africa, \r\n15 per cent of the children die under the age of five and \r\nonly one out of three children attends secondary \r\nschool. These children deserve a chance. Their parents \r\ndeserve the tools to give their children a decent future. \r\n At this moment, the economic crisis, the threat of \r\nclimate change and the volatility of food prices \r\ncompound the challenge. If we are to achieve our goals \r\nby 2015, we urgently need to intensify our efforts. We \r\nneed to ask: What can we do better? What can we do \r\ndifferently? \r\n First, we need to concert our efforts to provide \r\nnew economic opportunities. Everyone has a stake in \r\nthe lives of the poorest among us; everyone benefits \r\nfrom their enrichment. At the Organization for \r\nEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD), we \r\npledge to welcome to our discussions all those who \r\nwant to enlist economic forces on the side of the poor. \r\nTo do that, developing countries must maintain the \r\npace and scope of their far-reaching political and \r\neconomic reforms that have created millions of \r\nopportunities for trade, jobs and enterprise. Developed \r\ncountries must complement those efforts with stronger \r\naction in key areas such as taxation, combating illicit \r\ncapital flows, keeping markets open and moving \r\nforward on multilateral trade liberalization for \r\ndevelopment. \r\n Each of us can build on our own experience and \r\nthe experience of fellow countries in terms of what \r\nworks and what does not. This approach forms the core \r\nof the OECD raison d’être: sharing best practices \r\namong all who want to identify and implement better \r\npolicies for better lives. We should pay particular \r\nattention to critical areas like investment and trade and \r\nmobilizing domestic resources, advancing gender \r\nequality, educating girls and achieving environmentally \r\nsound growth. \r\n Secondly, technical cooperation and financial \r\nassistance will continue to play a vital role in meeting \r\nthe needs of the poorest of the poor and helping \r\nGovernments create the infrastructure, education and \r\nsystems that people need to better their lives. It is vital \r\nthat developed countries meet their aid targets. We \r\ncannot backslide on commitments at this critical \r\njuncture. We have highlighted some recent slippage, \r\nbut we also note that assistance from developed \r\ncountries has grown by 55 per cent over the last \r\n10 years. South-South cooperation is also a vital factor \r\nnow in development. \r\n Thirdly, we need to ensure the coherence of our \r\nefforts. In a rapidly changing international landscape, \r\nnew donors, philanthropic organizations and innovative \r\nfinance are playing a growing role. That is good. But \r\nas the global aid system grows more fragmented and \r\ncomplex, we urgently need to improve the coherence of \r\nall the different programmes and policies. The OECD \r\nhas been leading in this regard through the Paris \r\nDeclaration on Aid Effectiveness and the Accra Agenda \r\nfor Action. In Korea next year, we can turn the OECD’s \r\nfourth High-Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness into a \r\nkey platform to deliver on Millennium Goal 8, on \r\nbuilding a global partnership for development. \r\n We also can improve the effectiveness of both \r\ndomestic and private investment by putting in place \r\ncomprehensive systems to prevent, detect and punish \r\ncorruption, which steals from the poor and victimizes \r\nthe most vulnerable. The OECD will continue to lead \r\nin this effort as well. \r\n The financial and economic crisis should not \r\ndivert us from our aid commitments or our \r\ncommitments to sound policy reforms. At the OECD \r\nwe feel a special responsibility towards the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, which were born out of our 1996 \r\nInternational Development Goals, which were meant to \r\ncrystallize international aid commitments into \r\ndevelopment objectives that could be measured and \r\nmonitored. And measurement and monitoring is, \r\nprecisely, one of our central responsibilities.  \r\n But beyond that, we are committed to a broad \r\nrange of efforts, with a broad range of partners, to \r\nA/65/PV.9  \r\n \r\n10-54527 44 \r\n \r\ndistil and promote international best practices and to \r\nsupport effective policy based on the experience of our \r\ncurrent membership and that of the broader community \r\nof nations. We will work with partners to integrate the \r\ndevelopment agenda into all aspects of our work — for \r\nexample, as we look at finance flows, taxation, private \r\nsector development, governance and gender issues. \r\n Only with better coordination, better assistance \r\nand better policy joined together can we progress \r\ntowards achieving the Goals by 2015 and honour our \r\ncommitment to the world’s poorest, who struggle so \r\nhard to make their lives better. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): I \r\nnow give the floor to the observer of the International \r\nOrganization for Migration. \r\n Mr. Swing (International Organization for \r\nMigration): When the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs) were conceived 10 years ago, there was no \r\nmention of migration. And I think that this in itself \r\ntells a story, because at that point migration was not yet \r\non the global scene. In fact, there were only \r\n150 million migrants at that time.  \r\n Today, at the 10-year mark, there are more people \r\non the move than at any other time in recorded history: \r\n214 million international migrants, including \r\n12 million refugees, and 740 million internal \r\nmigrants — in other words, a total of one billion \r\npeople on the move, or roughly one in every seven \r\nhuman beings. \r\n Migration cuts across most, if not all, of the \r\nMDGs. Let me share several examples.  \r\n One example is migrant remittances, which touch \r\nMDGs 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6. Migrant remittances — in other \r\nwords, the money sent home — help reduce poverty. \r\nMigrant remittances provide families in countries of \r\norigin with additional, often vital, income. Migrant \r\nremittances are directly linked to the achievement of \r\nending poverty and hunger — MDG 1. The official \r\nremittance flows to developing countries last year was \r\n$316 billion. That is twice the totality of overseas \r\ndevelopment aid. It is roughly equal to the annual \r\nforeign direct investment and it is equal to the gross \r\ndomestic product (GDP) of several industrialized \r\nnations. For at least a dozen countries, migrant \r\nremittances represent 30 per cent of annual GDP. \r\n There is another type of remittance called “social \r\nremittances”. In other words, in addition to the money \r\nthat comes back, there are also skills, knowledge and \r\nexperience. These foster innovation, trigger learning \r\nprocesses, build networks and facilitate the transfer of \r\nknowledge and technology to countries of origin. \r\n The second example is the feminization of \r\nmigration, which touches directly MDG 3. Women are \r\nincreasingly migrating independently of family, or as \r\nthe breadwinner, thereby playing a part in MDG 3 — \r\npromoting gender equality and the empowerment of \r\nwomen. Nearly half of the world’s migrants today are \r\nwomen. Female migration is challenging gender \r\nstereotypes and leading to greater independence. \r\nHowever, migration can also pose obstacles to the \r\nachievement of gender equality. Women face an entire \r\nset of issues: vulnerability along the path to their new \r\nlife and trafficking and smuggling of female migrants, \r\nas well as the lack of access to health or legal services. \r\n The third example is environmental \r\nsustainability. MDG 7 can serve as an adaptation \r\nstrategy for communities vulnerable to the effects of \r\nenvironmental degradation. In several countries, \r\nmigrants are using the savings and skills they have \r\nacquired abroad to address environmental degradation \r\nin their homeland. \r\n The final example is migration partnerships, \r\nwhich addresses MDG 8. The development of \r\npartnerships through diaspora communities across the \r\nglobe is fostering development in their home countries \r\nthrough investments and knowledge and technology \r\ntransfers. Partnership is pivotal to developing more \r\naccessible formal channels for remittance transfers and \r\nbeneficial trade linkages. \r\n Let me conclude quickly. Migration is one of \r\nhumankind’s oldest freedoms. Migration has long been \r\nthe individual’s poverty reduction strategy. Migration \r\nis a powerful demonstration of a person’s right to \r\ndevelopment. Migration will continue to influence and \r\nshape development prospects and the MDGs in the \r\nyears ahead. However, we will need to work closely \r\ntogether to mitigate the potential negative effects of \r\nmigration on development, and we will need to work \r\ntogether to realize migration’s full potential — the \r\npotential to advance human development and the \r\nMDGs. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French) I \r\nnow give the floor to the observer of the International \r\nFederation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.  \r\n A/65/PV.9\r\n \r\n45 10-54527 \r\n \r\n Mr. Gelete (International Federation of Red \r\nCross and Red Crescent Societies): In the interest of \r\ntime I will be reading only a few paragraphs of my \r\npresentation, and the full text will be circulated \r\ntomorrow. \r\n The International Federation of Red Cross and \r\nRed Crescent Societies and its 186 member national \r\nsocieties are fully committed to contribute effectively \r\ntowards the achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. The International Federation, its \r\nmember national societies and community-based \r\nvolunteers are a unique bridge between Governments, \r\ncivil society and vulnerable people. With their skills, \r\ncompassion and unrivalled local knowledge, Red Cross \r\nand Red Crescent volunteers can reach and transform \r\nthe lives of those most in need, especially those facing \r\ndiscrimination and living on the margins of society. \r\n I have been visiting many national societies and \r\ntalking to their dedicated staff and volunteers. I have \r\nwitnessed the strength of their commitment to the \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals, \r\nand I have seen the important work done at the \r\ncommunity level. We have delivered on these \r\ncommitments within our mandate, experience and \r\nexpertise, and we will continue to do so. \r\n We will continue to strive to achieve excellence \r\nin our well-known role as the world’s leading actor in \r\nhumanitarian action and disaster response. In 2009 \r\nalone, the Red Cross and Red Crescent reached \r\n13.5 million people in 113 countries with our disaster \r\npreparedness and risk reduction programmes. From \r\nexperience, we believe that the professional estimate \r\nthat one dollar spent on risk reduction saves four \r\ndollars in response is true. We will also continue to \r\nbuild on our strengths in established community \r\nservice delivery, and we resolve to do more to promote \r\ndevelopment at the community level by preventing and \r\nreducing the underlying causes of vulnerability. \r\n Our world is changing continuously, and we face \r\nmany entwined challenges. Food insecurity, disasters, \r\nclimate change, poverty and rapid urbanization are \r\ntoday’s major humanitarian challenges, which are also \r\nimpacted by today’s social and economic challenges.  \r\n On the positive side, minds and attitudes are also \r\nchanging. Communication and information technology \r\nis having a great influence, especially on the way \r\nyoung people think and go about doing things, as we \r\nlearn from our young volunteers. By utilizing the \r\npower of communication and information technology \r\nwe can change minds and attitudes and thus overcome \r\nsome of the intractable barriers to progress, including \r\nthose that are social, cultural and behavioural. Young \r\npeople are leading the changes in their communities, \r\nand we need to empower them. \r\n Last but not least, I would like to take this \r\nopportunity to extend our heartfelt thanks and \r\nappreciation for Member States’ continued support and \r\nconfidence in the work of the staff and volunteers of \r\nthe International Red Cross and Red Crescent \r\nMovement around the world. We attach great \r\nimportance to this unique and distinctive relationship \r\nbetween the components of the International Red Cross \r\nand Red Crescent Movement and States. At the same \r\ntime, we emphasize that our commitment to our \r\nfundamental principles, including independence, \r\nneutrality and impartiality, provides the best available \r\nmeans to gain the confidence of all in order to have \r\naccess to those in need. \r\n We also attach great importance to our \r\npartnerships with other humanitarian actors, including \r\nthe United Nations and other international \r\norganizations, non-governmental organizations and \r\ncivil society, as well as with the private sector. Such \r\npartnerships are essential to address effectively the \r\nneeds of vulnerable people worldwide, in the spirit of \r\nworking together for humanity. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): I \r\nnow give the floor to the observer of the International \r\nOlympic Committee. \r\n Ms. El Moutawakel (International Olympic \r\nCommittee): On behalf of the International Olympic \r\nCommittee (IOC), I thank the General Assembly and \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for giving the IOC the \r\nopportunity to contribute more effectively, through \r\nsports, to the important work of the United Nations as a \r\nPermanent Observer. The Assembly’s decision to grant \r\nobserver status to our organization was a resounding \r\nacknowledgement by Member States and the \r\ninternational community as a whole of the positive \r\npower of sports. The additional recognition of sports in \r\nthe Outcome Document of this summit (resolution \r\n65/1) is another cause for our appreciation and \r\ninspiration. \r\n I am here today to contribute to the discussion on \r\nthe role of sports in achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). We are now just five \r\nA/65/PV.9  \r\n \r\n10-54527 46 \r\n \r\nyears away from the deadline set by the United Nations \r\nfor achieving the Goals. Time is short and the list of \r\nneeds is still long. The International Olympic \r\nCommittee shares the Assembly’s sense of urgency. \r\nMany of the Committee’s development projects are \r\nclosely aligned with the MDGs. We are working hard \r\nto eradicate poverty and extreme hunger by using \r\nsports to support community development and school \r\nfood programmes in Africa and Asia. \r\n In May, the International Olympic Committee \r\nopened the first Olympic Youth Development Centre in \r\nZambia. This innovative project addresses community \r\nneeds by combining sports with education and health-\r\ncare programmes. We are working to achieve universal \r\nprimary education by collaborating with UNESCO and \r\nother relevant partners to provide education to children \r\nand also to youth of disadvantaged communities. We \r\nare supporting values-based education in Africa, in \r\nAsia, in Latin America, in the Caribbean islands and \r\nalso in Oceania. \r\n The International Olympic Committee is also \r\nusing sports to promote gender equality and the \r\nempowerment of women and girls. In this regard, we \r\ncongratulate the United Nations for its decision to \r\nestablish the entity UN Women. We look forward to \r\nworking closely with the organization as soon as it is \r\nup and running. The goal of gender equality in and \r\nthrough sports is included in the Olympic Charter, the \r\nOlympic Movement’s guiding document. With the \r\naddition of more women’s events to the Olympic \r\nprogramme, women will participate in every sport at \r\nthe next Olympic Games, to be held in London in \r\n2012. \r\n The International Olympic Committee is \r\ncontributing, to the fight against HIV/AIDS and \r\nmalaria, as well as other, non-communicable diseases, \r\nthrough extensive education programmes in partnership \r\nwith the Joint United Nations Programme on \r\nHIV/AIDS, the World Health Organization, the \r\nInternational Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement \r\nand other partners from civil society. \r\n We are also working to ensure environmental \r\nsustainability by making sustainability an integral part \r\nof the planning process for the Olympic Games and \r\nother sports activities. In 1994 International Olympic \r\nCommittee adopted the environment as the third pillar \r\nof the Olympic Movement, alongside sports and \r\nculture. The Committee is proud to be part of a global \r\npartnership for development.  \r\n The Olympic Movement is composed of the \r\nInternational Olympic Committee, the International \r\nand National Sport Federations and the 205 National \r\nOlympic Committees. They are all using the power of \r\nsports to promote the MDGs in countries across the \r\nworld and they cooperate to that end with all sectors, \r\nincluding Governments, United Nations agencies, \r\nfunds and programmes, non-governmental organizations, \r\nthe business community and civil society at large. \r\n While we indeed are doing our best, we are fully \r\naware that more must and can be done. All of us in \r\nsports can and must do more. This is a clarion call to \r\nsports organizations and to the billions of sportspersons \r\nand their supporters and fans throughout the world to \r\nplay their part fully. \r\n As it has done for more than a century now, the \r\nInternational Olympic Committee, and the Olympic \r\nMovement at large, will continue to look for new ways \r\nto use the power of sports to bring people together, to \r\ninspire them to be the best they can be, to encourage \r\nhealthy lifestyles, to foster peace, to promote values-\r\nbased education — in short, to make better citizens of \r\nour youth and the world a better place for all of us. \r\n Sport cannot solve all of the world’s problems, \r\nbut it can help this honourable institution in its mission \r\nto serve and to save humanity. I thank the Assembly for \r\nadvancing the causes of peace, development and \r\nhuman rights throughout the world. Thank you for \r\nrecognizing the importance of sports in achieving the \r\nMDGs and for giving sports the opportunity to \r\ncontribute to this noble agenda. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): I \r\nnow give the floor to the observer for the International \r\nInstitute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance.  \r\n Mr. Helgesen (International Institute for \r\nDemocracy and Electoral Assistance): The Millennium \r\nDeclaration (resolution 55/2) affirms that the United \r\nNations will spare no effort to promote democracy. For \r\nthe International Institute for Democracy and Electoral \r\nAssistance International (IDEA), as the only \r\nintergovernmental organization with a specific mandate \r\nto support democracy worldwide, it is significant that \r\nthis world body draws the link between democracy and \r\ndevelopment. \r\n A/65/PV.9\r\n \r\n47 10-54527 \r\n \r\n The rationale for that link is evident. For \r\ndemocracy to be genuinely sustainable, it must be \r\nowned and led by those whose development is at stake. \r\nProfound development, like democracy, can only be \r\ndriven from within and below. For that to happen there \r\nis a need for open, inclusive, accountable structures for \r\nparticipation in society. \r\n Democracy serves the cause of development \r\nbecause it reinforces the social contract between \r\ncitizens and decision-makers. It provides for the \r\nnecessary democratic ownership of the development \r\nprocess. A critical but often weak link in ensuring \r\ndemocratic ownership is certain key political actors, \r\nnotably political parties and parliaments. Too often \r\nthey fail in their responsibility to capture citizens’ \r\nneeds and aspirations and transform them into policies \r\nthat can deliver on development. Too often they fail in \r\ntheir responsibility to hold the executive to account. \r\nAnd too often the international community fails in its \r\nresponsibility to support the strengthening of such \r\ndemocratic accountability processes through existing \r\ndevelopment cooperation frameworks. \r\n If the next years of efforts to attain the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) are to be \r\nmore successful, sustaining aid levels is not enough. \r\nGetting out of the global economic crisis is also not \r\nenough. If development is to be truly nationally owned, \r\nit requires more responsive national democratic \r\npolitics. Responsive politics must include increased \r\npolitical participation of women. One of the intolerable \r\ndemocratic deficits worldwide that is also a barrier to \r\nhuman development is the continuing gross under-\r\nrepresentation of women in politics. Fifteen years after \r\nfrom the Beijing target of 30 per cent representation by \r\nwomen in parliaments, only 24 parliaments worldwide \r\nhave reached that target. \r\n Democratic principles of participation, inclusion, \r\nregular free and fair elections and an independent \r\njudiciary are more likely to bring about development \r\ngains than other systems of governance. Democratic \r\nparticipation supports development in three ways. \r\nFirst, elections empower people to articulate their \r\ninterests. In elections governments will be held \r\naccountable if they do not attend to the needs of the \r\npoor. Secondly, democracy requires freedom of speech \r\nand association and thus facilitates transfer of \r\ninformation to the Government about the needs, \r\naspirations and preferences of the poor. Thirdly, \r\ndemocratic Governments are more efficient in \r\nproviding public goods such as education, health care, \r\njob training, a clean environment and, most critically, \r\nthe rule of law. That is why democracy is the most \r\ndesired and desirable form of governance. Democracy \r\nis good for development. The opposite is also true: \r\ndevelopment is good for democracy. \r\n In International IDEA’s experience it is critically \r\nimportant to support the integrity of electoral \r\nprocesses, the centrality of parliaments and political \r\nparties, and the effectiveness of sector-specific \r\ndemocratic dialogue for making sure that democracy \r\ndelivers on key areas of human development such as \r\nhealth, education or community security. \r\n Our work also shows that the rich democracy-\r\nbuilding experiences from the global South can \r\ncontribute to a better understanding of the relationship \r\nbetween the quality of democracy over time and \r\ncountry-level performance on the MDGs. \r\n In conclusion, I reiterate International IDEA’s \r\ncommitment to contributing to the achievement of the \r\nMDGs, in partnership with national, regional and \r\nglobal actors and to deepen our strategic partnership \r\nwith the United Nations in that endeavour. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): I \r\nnow give the floor to the observer of the International \r\nOrganization of la Francophonie. \r\n Mr. Benessahraoui (International Organization \r\nof la Francophonie) (spoke in French): Since \r\nSeptember 2000, the International Organization of la \r\nFrancophonie (OIF) has made the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) the guiding principle of \r\nthe actions of all its missions. Since then it has \r\ncontributed, to the extent that its means allow, to \r\nachieving the Goals with an approach that provides \r\nadded value and effective solidarity. That approach is \r\nbased on assisting member countries, including \r\nthrough sharing its rich wealth of experiences and good \r\npractices displayed in all four corners of our world. \r\n In working to achieve the MDGs, the OIF is \r\nworking at the same time for the emergence of a \r\nsustainable institutional and political context based on \r\na tripartite solidarity: solidarity among States, \r\nespecially between the North and the South, solidarity \r\namong current generations within States, and solidarity \r\neverywhere towards future generations.  \r\n All told, the approach of la Francophonie is part \r\nof a vision that takes into account the world’s diversity. \r\nA/65/PV.9  \r\n \r\n10-54527 48 \r\n \r\nIt is based on a dialogue of cultures and recognizes that \r\nculture is a crucial component of human development \r\nand represents a source of identity, innovation and \r\ncreativity for individuals and communities. It is also a \r\nfactor for reconciliation and social cohesion.  \r\n There has been progress in terms of \r\nimplementing several MDGs in the francophone sphere \r\nand elsewhere in the developing world. Some countries \r\nare on the right path to achieve at least some of the \r\nMDGs by the 2015 deadline. However, it must be \r\nnoted that despite efforts made and the tangible \r\nprogress noted, achieving the MDGs remains out of \r\nreach in many regions, particularly in Africa. The road \r\nbefore us is long if we are to ensure that every single \r\nchild in the human family enjoys his fundamental right \r\nto education and health care.  \r\n Much remains to be done, be it with regard to \r\neducation and health care for all or to eradicating \r\npoverty; whether it concerns gender equality or, more \r\nbroadly, the emergence of a more fertile global \r\npartnership that is more resolutely based in solidarity, \r\nwith renewed planetary governance that is fairer and \r\nmore democratic.  \r\n More than ever, these worrying observations \r\nrequire the collective, focused and ongoing attention of \r\nthe international community in order to renew and \r\nincrease the global efforts being made in terms of \r\nofficial development assistance, and to find and \r\nmobilize additional resources and innovative financing \r\ncommensurate with a challenge that imperils the very \r\nsurvival of an entire branch of the human family.  \r\n Finally, the review of the MDGs two-thirds of the \r\nway to their deadline highlights the need to find ways \r\nand means to improve synchronization of actions, \r\ntargets and goals, and to adapt them to the diversity of \r\nsituations and developments. With these improvements, \r\nand by taking into consideration cultural factors and \r\naccess to energy, the MDGs must continue to be a \r\nvector for and a common thread of the renewed \r\ncommitment of the international community to \r\ncombating poverty and giving specific and measurable \r\nmeaning to solidarity with the most disadvantaged.  \r\n The renewal of the international commitment, \r\nwhich la Francophonie vigorously urges, is particularly \r\nnecessary because the multifaceted financial, \r\neconomic, energy and food crisis that has shaken the \r\nworld for the past three years threatens to destroy the \r\nachievements that have been made since 2000. The \r\ncrisis also threatens to destroy the praiseworthy efforts \r\nof the less developed countries, which will suffer, still \r\nmore than others, the effects of the crisis. \r\n On the other hand, the environmental crisis, \r\nwhich will certainly and irreversibly exacerbate \r\nclimate change and the erosion of biodiversity, is \r\nanother source of concern, whose multiple impacts will \r\nultimately result, if nothing serious is done \r\neverywhere, in the unfair aggravation of poverty, in \r\nparticular in developing countries. This worrisome \r\ncontext therefore requires more commitment and more \r\nboldness in consolidating governance, both at the \r\nnational and the international levels. \r\n The emergence of global governance is \r\nnecessary; the need for regulation is more urgent and \r\nimperative than ever. While the establishment of the \r\nGroup of Twenty can be considered to be progress with \r\nrespect to the Group of Eight, much remains to be done \r\nto strengthen cooperation on the rules governing the \r\nworld economy, allowing everyone to become active \r\npartners in an improved form of shared Government. \r\n In a word, we must ensure that all our efforts \r\nconverge for managed globalization designed to \r\nsustainably inaugurate an era of responsibility and \r\nshared prosperity. As our Secretary General, Mr. Abdou \r\nDiouf, has affirmed,  \r\n “by calling on the international community to \r\nimplement its commitments, la Francophonie also \r\nshows its own determination to work along these \r\nlines, as has been proved already by the desire of \r\nits Heads of State and Government to address this \r\nquestion at the thirteenth summit of la \r\nFrancophonie, which will take place next 22 to 24 \r\nOctober in Montreux, Switzerland”. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): I \r\nnow give the floor to the observer of the International \r\nUnion for the Conservation of Nature. \r\n Ms. Marton-Lefèvre (International Union for the \r\nConservation of Nature): I have the privilege of \r\nrepresenting the world’s oldest and largest international \r\nconservation network, and speak on behalf of its 1,200 \r\nmembers — big and small, sovereign States and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations — which are all united by \r\na common vision of a just world that values and \r\nconserves nature. \r\n At the turn of the millennium, world leaders \r\nmade an unprecedented commitment to ensuring \r\n A/65/PV.9\r\n \r\n49 10-54527 \r\n \r\nenvironmental sustainability and to making sustainable \r\ndevelopment an overarching framework for all \r\ndevelopment efforts. Participants may ask themselves \r\nwhat could possibly be the connection between a \r\nnature conservation organization and the global quest \r\nfor economic growth and social progress that are \r\nenshrined in the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs). \r\n The International Union for the Conservation of \r\nNature (IUCN) has been working on the development \r\nparadigm for many years, especially since our 1980 \r\nWorld Conservation Strategy, which stressed the \r\ninterdependence of conservation and development, thus \r\nbeing the first to give currency to the term “sustainable \r\ndevelopment”. \r\n The concept is now commonplace, but it seems as \r\nthough, 10 years after nearly 200 nations agreed to \r\nintegrate environmental sustainability into all major \r\npolicy decisions, we are still trying to make the case \r\nfor it rather than getting on with the actual task at \r\nhand. IUCN echoes the concerns of many in this Hall \r\nthat, despite progress made in some areas and in some \r\nregions, the achievement of MDG 7 — and the MDGs \r\noverall — may be compromised. \r\n We have five years to make a difference. \r\nGroundbreaking research and practical experience on \r\nthe ground tell us that the key to not just one but \r\nseveral MDGs may well be found in rethinking the \r\nrelationship between biodiversity, ecosystems — or \r\nsimply what nature provides — and human well-being. \r\n Food security and the livelihoods of the poor \r\ndirectly depend on functioning ecosystems like forests, \r\nmangroves and coastal areas. Global water and \r\nsanitation targets can be achieved only by sustaining \r\necosystems that ensure the supply of clear, safe water, \r\nwhilst improved management of local watersheds can \r\nreduce child deaths from water-borne diseases.  \r\n By providing sustainable energy alternatives we \r\ncan reduce the time that children, especially girls, \r\nspend collecting firewood instead of studying. \r\nEmpowering women to manage natural resources \r\nsustainably can contribute to improving food safety \r\nand security, as would alleviating the hardships of \r\nother vulnerable groups, especially children and \r\nindigenous peoples. \r\n Climate change, recognized as a threat and \r\nchallenge for achieving development, is closely linked \r\nto the need for robust ecosystems. By acknowledging \r\nthe role of healthy nature in extreme events such as \r\ndroughts and floods, we improve our resilience and \r\ncapacity to adapt to climate change. In other words, \r\ninvesting in nature is investing in development and, at \r\nthe same time, investing in the achievement of the \r\nMDGs. \r\n The landmark study entitled “The Economics of \r\nEcosystems and Biodiversity” has gone a long way in \r\nhelping us understand the contribution of nature to our \r\nwell-being and put it in language that is understood by \r\neconomists, business people, politicians and citizens \r\nworldwide. For example, tropical forests that provide \r\nlivelihoods for over 1 billion of the world’s poorest \r\npeople are being lost at an alarming rate. In addition, \r\ndeforestation accounts for about 17 per cent of \r\ngreenhouse gas emissions, and halting deforestation \r\nwould save some $3.7 trillion in terms of avoided \r\ngreenhouse gas emissions. Fish provides the main \r\nsource of protein for more than one-sixth of humanity. \r\nBy redirecting the financial flows that currently drive \r\nmost commercially valuable fish stocks to \r\noverexploitation, we could improve the performance of \r\nglobal fisheries by an estimated $50 billion annually. \r\n“The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity” has \r\nmany, many more examples of this type. \r\n The achievement of the MDGs requires \r\nrefocusing and redoubling efforts made by \r\nGovernments and other actors, including civil society \r\nand the private sector. The opportunity is not lost, but a \r\ndifferent approach, in which environmental \r\nsustainability is at the heart of development efforts, is \r\ndesperately needed if we are to meet our commitments \r\nin five years’ time. Let us bring to the world a renewed \r\nleadership to realize sustainable development — for \r\npeople, for nature and for the planet, our unique home. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): I \r\nnow give the floor to the observer of the Asian \r\nDevelopment Bank. \r\n Mr. Kuroda (Asian Development Bank): The \r\nAsian and Pacific region encompasses nearly three-\r\nfifths of humankind. No global effort to achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) will succeed \r\nunless our region succeeds. \r\n With more than 500 million people having \r\novercome poverty since 1990, the region’s target for \r\nreducing extreme income poverty is in sight. However, \r\nas home to two-thirds of the world’s poor, it still faces \r\nA/65/PV.9  \r\n \r\n10-54527 50 \r\n \r\nenormous challenges. Almost 2 billion people in the \r\nregion still live without basic sanitation, and nearly \r\nhalf a billion without safe drinking water. Infant \r\nmortality in some countries is more than 10 times \r\nhigher than in developed nations. In South Asia, \r\nilliteracy rates are among the highest in the world, \r\nslum-dwellers comprise 40 per cent of the urban \r\npopulation, and women are still deprived of the \r\nbenefits of growth. \r\n The region’s environment faces daunting threats, \r\nincluding a decline in forest cover and the steady rise \r\nof greenhouse gas emissions. Recent catastrophic \r\nfloods that have brought misery to millions highlight \r\nthe need for stronger measures to counter climate-\r\nrelated vulnerabilities and better adapt to climate \r\nchange. \r\n The MDGs represent a global compact to \r\neradicate these deprivations and threats, and we must \r\nall do our part. National Governments must make \r\ngrowth more inclusive. They must provide better \r\naccess to basic services and engage the private sector, \r\ncivil society, and communities in order to help ensure \r\nbetter service delivery. They must expand basic \r\ninfrastructure to provide access to electricity, roads and \r\nother essential services so that the poor can access \r\nhealth care, education and economic opportunities. And \r\nthey must move quickly towards low-carbon growth. \r\n At the regional level, traditional donors and \r\nnewly emerging ones alike can do more to help their \r\nless-developed neighbours. Expanding regional \r\ncooperation in the areas of trade, investment, \r\nknowledge and technology can also help bridge gaps in \r\nresources and capacities. While the region overall is \r\nprogressing, many countries within Asia and the \r\nPacific are falling behind. Linking those worse-off \r\ncountries to larger subregional and regional markets \r\nwill spur faster growth, create economic opportunities \r\nand facilitate the sharing of regional resources, such as \r\nenergy and water. \r\n The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is \r\ncommitted to strengthening regional and global \r\npartnerships to achieve the MDGs. We are increasing \r\nour support for roads, electricity, water, sanitation and \r\neducation. We have established dedicated funds to \r\npromote environmentally sustainable growth and tackle \r\nclimate change. Our financing for clean energy has \r\ngrown to more than $1 billion a year, and we plan to \r\ndouble that to more than $2 billion per year by 2013. \r\nADB’s projects in the areas of water and sanitation \r\nhave benefited more than 130 million people in the \r\npast five years, and we plan to further increase our \r\noperations. Our school improvement projects are \r\nexpected to benefit more than 22 million students in \r\nthe next three years, and we also intend to scale up our \r\nassistance for education, which is one of our core areas \r\nof operation. \r\n The Asian and Pacific region represents the \r\nworld’s best help for achieving the MDGs, but it \r\ncannot do it alone. The international community must, \r\nabove all, live up to the commitment of the historic \r\nMillennium Declaration of 2000 (resolution 55/2). The \r\nDeclaration promised a better life to millions of poor \r\npeople in the Asian and Pacific region and across the \r\nglobe. Our collective action today can make that \r\npromise a reality. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): I \r\nnow give the floor to the observer of the Sovereign \r\nMilitary Order of Malta. \r\n Mr. Shafer (Sovereign Military Order of Malta): \r\nThe Sovereign Hospitaller Military Order of Malta \r\nappreciates the opportunity to address this High-level \r\nPlenary Meeting, and I shall be very brief. The Order \r\nwould also like to congratulate the Secretary-General \r\nand the President of the General Assembly on their \r\nwise guidance in organizing this important high-level \r\nevent and for bringing the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs) directly into the spotlight that shines on \r\nthe United Nations every September. \r\n The Order has continued to pledge and strengthen \r\nour cooperation with the United Nations on these \r\nissues, particularly in the fields of humanitarian \r\nassistance and sustainable development, and we \r\nreiterate that pledge today. The Order considers the \r\nMillennium Development Goals to be an example of \r\nthe preferential option for the poor that we firmly \r\nbelieve in. Combating poverty, disease and suffering, \r\nregardless of race, religion or nationality, has been at \r\nthe heart of the Order’s activities for 900 years. The \r\nOrder’s 13,000 members, 80,000 permanent volunteers \r\nand professional medical staff, and 20,000 doctors, \r\nnurses and stretcher-bearers make up an exceptional \r\nnetwork working in 120 countries. \r\n With respect to Goal 1, the Order is saddened by \r\nthe dire situation of more than 1 billion people living \r\nin extreme poverty and hunger and by the inequities \r\nbetween and within countries. This is a scandal to \r\n A/65/PV.9\r\n \r\n51 10-54527 \r\n \r\nhumankind and one of the most significant challenges \r\nfacing the world today. Extreme poverty and hunger \r\nare the cause, symptoms and effects of the issues the \r\nMDGs address, and progress on this Goal is most \r\ncrucial. \r\n I would also like to state that, in our view, Goals \r\n4, 5 and 6 are interconnected on every level. Failure on \r\nany one of them is likely to endanger progress on \r\nothers. It is an inexcusable reality that five diseases — \r\npneumonia, diarrhoea, malaria, measles and \r\nHIV/AIDS — account for half the deaths of children \r\nunder five. Low-cost prevention and treatment could \r\nsave most of these children. \r\n I should also point, however, to bright spots. The \r\nOrder’s Holy Family Maternity Hospital in Bethlehem \r\nwill soon be delivering its 50,000th baby. In the 20 \r\nyears since its first delivery, the Holy Family Hospital \r\nhas gone from 1,000 births annually to more than \r\n4,000. It is the only hospital of its kind in the West \r\nBank. Its intensive care unit is the only one in the \r\nentire region. The hospital has facilitated Israeli-\r\nPalestinian cooperation in the medical field, and the \r\nPalestinian Ministry of Health has designated the Holy \r\nFamily Hospital as a training centre for young doctors. \r\n We also immediately expanded our hospital in the \r\nNorth of Haiti when the horrible earthquake occurred. \r\nWe added more than 400 beds, and helicopters brought \r\nmany of the worst injured people there from Port-au-\r\nPrince. Our planes left Cologne the day after the \r\nearthquake and landed, bringing German and Swiss \r\ndoctors and supplies for 50,000 people. I should like to \r\nconclude by saying that without peace the development \r\nof peoples will never come about just as without \r\ndevelopment there will never be peace. And I \r\ncongratulate you all for bringing these issues before us \r\ntoday. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): I \r\nnow give the floor to the observer of the Partners in \r\nPopulation and Development. \r\n Mr. Rao (Partners in Population and \r\nDevelopment): Thank you very much, Sir, for giving \r\nme the opportunity to make a few comments on behalf \r\nof the Partners in Population and Development (PPD) \r\nat this landmark High-level Plenary Meeting. Because \r\nof time constraints, I will not read out the whole of my \r\nprepared statement. \r\n As an intergovernmental organization of \r\n24 developing countries committed to the promotion of \r\nSouth-South cooperation in the field of population and \r\ndevelopment, PPD has been actively promoting the \r\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs) and the goals of the International Conference \r\non Population and Development (ICPD), especially in \r\nits member countries. A number of international \r\norganizations and foundations, including the United \r\nNations Population Fund (UNFPA), continue to support \r\nthe activities of PPD, and, on this occasion, the PPD \r\nwould like to put on record its appreciation for the \r\nFund’s continued collaboration and support. \r\n Partners in Population and Development \r\nrecognizes that all the MDGs are interlinked, thereby \r\nfacilitating an integrated and comprehensive approach \r\nto achieving the goals, as many have noted. Bearing in \r\nmind that it is a networking and partnership institution, \r\nPPD is, in line with its mandate, encouraging and \r\nsupporting activities in the programme priority areas \r\nsubstantive areas by focusing on capacity-building \r\nthrough training, knowledge-sharing through \r\ndocumenting and disseminating innovative practices in \r\npopulation and reproductive health, information \r\nexchange, and advocacy for population, reproductive \r\nhealth and development. \r\n Partners in Population and Development would \r\nlike to draw attention, as others have done at this \r\nMeeting, to the slow rate of progress in such areas as \r\nimproving maternal and reproductive health and \r\nreducing maternal mortality, MDG 5, and advancing \r\ngender equality and the empowerment of women and \r\ngirls, MDG 3. At the same time, PPD notes with great \r\nsatisfaction the renewed interest shown by Member \r\nStates in maternal health and family planning as \r\nevidenced by the discussions at the last meeting of the \r\nGroup of Eight in Canada and at the African Union \r\nSummit, which took place in July of this year in \r\nKampala. Likewise, the Secretary-General’s Global \r\nStrategy on Women’s and Children’s Health is most \r\ntimely and should be commended. Given that maternal \r\nmortality rates are still high, however, a concerted \r\neffort is required if accelerated progress on the relevant \r\nGoal is to be achieved by 2015. In this regard, PPD \r\nwould like to reiterate the recommendations contained \r\nin the outcome document on family planning, \r\nemergency obstetric care and related services. \r\nHowever, PPD notes with deep concern that the \r\nfunding for family planning is lower today than it was \r\nA/65/PV.9  \r\n \r\n10-54527 52 \r\n \r\nin 1995. As UNFPA has cautioned, if that trend is not \r\nreversed, it will have serious implications for \r\ncountries’ abilities to address unmet needs for family \r\nplanning and reproductive health. Urgent action is \r\nrequired in this regard. \r\n In the context of achieving the MDGs and the \r\nICPD goals, the role of South-South cooperation needs \r\nto be highlighted. The Ministerial Meeting of the high-\r\nlevel segment of the Economic and Social Council in \r\nJuly of this year highlighted the growing importance of \r\nSouth-South cooperation and noted that it currently \r\naccounts for around 10 per cent of all development \r\ncooperation. \r\n Partners in Population and Development have \r\nbeen doing their part since 1994, when it was \r\nestablished at the time of the ICPD in Cairo. PPD \r\nexperience indicates that first-rate technical \r\ncapabilities exist in the population and reproductive \r\nhealth field in many developing countries and greater \r\nefforts should be made to fully capitalize on such \r\ncapabilities through South-South and triangular \r\ncooperation. For example, the Governments of Egypt, \r\nMorocco and India have offered long-term fellowships \r\nand China and South Africa are offering short-term \r\nfellowships to train population, family planning and \r\nhealth experts. The Government of Bangladesh \r\ncontinues to host and support the secretariat of the PPD \r\nin Dhaka. In addition, PPD member countries have \r\nbuilt a network of world-class institutions that can \r\nprovide a whole range of training, research and \r\ntechnical support opportunities. \r\n In closing, PPD would like to express its fervent \r\nhope that the great potential that exists for South-South \r\ncooperation in many developing countries will be \r\nutilized and play an enhanced and critical role in \r\ncontributing to the achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals by 2015, and, indeed, to \r\nsustainable development and international cooperation. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): I \r\nnow give the floor to the observer of the Parliamentary \r\nAssembly of the Mediterranean. \r\n Mr. Amoruso (Parliamentary Assembly of the \r\nMediterranean) (spoke in Italian; English text provided \r\nby the delegation): It is with great pride that the \r\nParliamentary Assembly of the Mediterranean (PAM) \r\nparticipates today in the High-level Plenary Meeting on \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), \r\nexercising for the first time its observer status, which it \r\nobtained last December at the sixty-fourth session of \r\nthe General Assembly. Established in 2006 after some \r\n20 years of collaboration among the countries \r\nbordering the Mediterranean Sea, under the aegis of the \r\nInter-Parliamentary Union, the Parliamentary Assembly \r\nof the Mediterranean now has 25 member parliaments \r\nfrom around the Mediterranean, whose joint hope for \r\nthe Mediterranean is to improve the quality of life for \r\nsome, to preserve a way of living for others, and to \r\nensure the peaceful coexistence of all in a region that is \r\nprosperous and stable. \r\n Security-related political concerns and economic, \r\nsocial and environmental issues are crucial for our \r\nAssembly, which has placed the human dimension at \r\nthe heart of its concerns. Achieving the MDGs is a \r\nglobal endeavour bolstered by one of the most \r\nambitious programmes developed by humanity, to \r\nwhich the parliamentarians of the Mediterranean have \r\ndecided to devote their steadfast dedication. The \r\nvarious aspects of poverty and suffering can be clearly \r\nseen in our region. Within the region, there are widely \r\ndiffering levels of development, which could threaten \r\nregional stability and trigger population shifts or \r\nconflict. The region must therefore step up its efforts in \r\nsupport of the attainment of the eight MDGs.  \r\n Ten years after the Millennium Summit, a great \r\ndeal of progress has been seen in our region. But it \r\nvaries widely across the region, and a great deal more \r\neffort is still needed. While official development \r\nassistance to the Mediterranean countries has increased \r\nconsiderably, it remains inadequate. And some \r\ncountries seem unlikely to be able to achieve the Goals \r\nset for 2015 unless additional efforts are made. \r\n The economic crisis, which is often invoked as an \r\nexcuse, cannot be taken as a valid justification for \r\nfailing to seize the opportunity before us to help the \r\npoorest populations on the required scale and eradicate \r\nextreme poverty. \r\n The American economist Jeffrey Sachs recently \r\nhighlighted the gaps that must be bridged to attain the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. I would like to focus \r\non one of them that is still of great concern in our \r\nregion: access to drinking water and basic sanitation. \r\nJust to mention one figure, the Mediterranean accounts \r\nfor 60 per cent of the world’s water-poor populations, \r\nwith access to less than one thousand cubic metres per \r\nperson per year. Water management here has a \r\nsignificant impact on life, health, agriculture, energy \r\n A/65/PV.9\r\n \r\n53 10-54527 \r\n \r\nproduction, transportation and, hence, on the economy, \r\nthe environment and biodiversity. \r\n Mindful that our region must seriously address \r\nthe problem of collective water management, the \r\nParliamentary Assembly resolved in 2008 to publish an \r\nannual report on water in the Mediterranean. Its \r\nresolution on water was adopted unanimously in 2009 \r\nat its meeting in Istanbul. It specifically requires \r\nmember Parliaments to take action to ensure as soon as \r\npossible that the right of access to water by all may be \r\nrecognized as an essential human right. \r\n We are very proud to note that last July the \r\nGeneral Assembly adopted resolution 64/292, declaring \r\nthat the right to safe and clean drinking water and \r\nsanitation is a human right that is essential for the full \r\nenjoyment of the right to life. The PAM congratulates \r\nthe General Assembly on this historic decision, which \r\nmakes it possible to complete one stage leading to the \r\nattainment of the Millennium Goals. \r\n However, this stage is only theoretical and PAM’s \r\nconcerns remain unchanged. By emphasizing water and \r\naccess to clean water today, I am solemnly requesting \r\nin the name of the Parliamentarians of the \r\nMediterranean that this historic resolution not be \r\nallowed to remain a dead letter, but will, rather, lead to \r\nthe establishment of tangible rights, making it possible \r\nfor several hundreds of millions of people to truly \r\nimprove their living conditions. The Goals provide us \r\nwith a unique opportunity to achieve this ambition by \r\n2015. \r\n We, as Parliamentarians, are ready to use all our \r\npowers to legislate, oversee our executives and vote on \r\nbudgets to ensure that this is achieved in our region, \r\nthereby underpinning the efforts being deployed by the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): I \r\nnow give the floor to the observer of the \r\nCommonwealth Secretariat. \r\n Mr. Smith (Commonwealth Secretariat): The \r\nCommonwealth is honoured to make a statement at this \r\nHigh-level United Nations General Assembly Meeting \r\nto review the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). \r\n The Commonwealth is a voluntary association of \r\n54 countries on five continents. We account for a third \r\nof the world’s population, a quarter of its countries and \r\na fifth of its trade. We are rich and poor, large and \r\nsmall — diverse countries with varied peoples aspiring \r\nto the shared goals of freedoms and rights which \r\nemanate from and underpin development and \r\ndemocracy. \r\n And with our membership containing 16 least \r\ndeveloped countries, 19 countries in sub-Saharan \r\nAfrica, 32 small States, the achieving of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals is an imperative for all \r\nCommonwealth citizens. \r\n The Commonwealth’s commitment to the MDGs \r\nis deep. The MDGs embody the fundamental rights \r\nwhich underpin our association. They provide an \r\nessential guiding light for the Commonwealth’s work \r\namong its members. \r\n Since 2000, when the international community \r\nembarked on this unique human endeavour, many \r\ncountries in the Commonwealth have made significant \r\nprogress. The incidence of tuberculosis has fallen in \r\nmost Commonwealth developing States, rates of \r\nprimary education have risen significantly in a large \r\nnumber of Commonwealth countries, especially in \r\nsub-Saharan Africa. Two thirds of Commonwealth \r\ndeveloping countries have already eliminated gender \r\ndisparities in primary and secondary education. \r\n However, it is also clear that looking across the \r\nCommonwealth as a whole, much remains to be done. \r\nTo illustrate: there are 20 million people in the \r\nCommonwealth living with HIV. In addition, two thirds \r\nof all maternal deaths take place in Commonwealth \r\ncountries. \r\n Time is now short to attain the MDGs. Current \r\ncircumstances demand now more than ever that the \r\nflame that was lit in 2000 be kept alive. We must now \r\nredouble our efforts to ensure that the MDGs are \r\nachieved and that this takes place within the agreed \r\ntimeframe. \r\n In the Commonwealth, our Heads of Government \r\nand Ministers, especially those in health, education and \r\nwomen’s affairs, have looked hard at the challenges \r\nour countries face in meeting the MDGs. They have \r\nhighlighted the need for action in a number of areas, \r\nfour of which I will now specifically draw attention to \r\nand which are also reflected in the outcome document. \r\n First, there is a need for increased levels of \r\ndevelopment finance. With global pressure on \r\ndevelopment budgets, there is urgent need for the \r\nglobal community and its members to consider and \r\nA/65/PV.9  \r\n \r\n10-54527 54 \r\n \r\nimplement new, innovative mechanisms for generating \r\ndevelopment finance. \r\n Secondly, a new emphasis is needed on the role \r\nof women in development. Both Commonwealth health \r\nministers and women’s affairs ministers stressed the \r\nurgency of addressing shortcomings in maternal health \r\nprovision. More midwives are desperately needed. But \r\nwomen are also important economic agents. As the \r\nwomen’s affairs ministers have emphasized, they need \r\nnew and innovative ways to be supported as wealth \r\ncreators if the MDGs are to be met. \r\n Thirdly, trade is well recognized as essential to \r\nsupport economic growth and promote poverty \r\nreduction. The will must be found to deliver a fair, \r\ndevelopment-oriented conclusion to the DOHA \r\nDevelopment Round. Regional and other trading \r\narrangements must be pursued and concluded on bases \r\nthat strengthen productive capacity and improve access \r\nto markets, especially for women, youth entrepreneurs \r\nand small business owners. \r\n Fourthly, new and innovative partnerships are \r\nessential to delivering the MDGs. In the \r\nCommonwealth, we champion the linking together of \r\nour governmental, business and civil society networks. \r\nThis is a model with global relevance. Our technical \r\ncooperation work is built on sharing best practice and \r\nsouth-south cooperation. These provide a new basis for \r\nsustainable development cooperation. \r\n In its work on the MDGs, the Commonwealth and \r\nits Secretariat are guided by the recognition that \r\ndemocracy and development are interdependent. \r\nDemocracy at the national and local level promotes the \r\ntransparency and accountability essential to efficient \r\nand effective delivery of public services and the \r\neconomic growth which reduces poverty. We strongly \r\nbelieve that achieving the MDGs requires the full \r\nengagement of all citizens, for both “people \r\nownership” of these objectives and “country \r\nownership” are essential. \r\n We acknowledge and support the commitment of \r\nthe United Nations Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-\r\nmoon, the United Nations as an organization, and so \r\nmany millions across the globe to maintaining the hope \r\nthat inspired the MDGs in 2000. We trust that this \r\nmeeting and the outcome document will serve to \r\ngalvanize the global community, and particularly those \r\nmost able to do so, into providing the human, technical \r\nand financial resources necessary to the task ahead \r\nwhich is assuring the attainment of the MDGs. \r\n The overarching goal that is still within our grasp \r\nis nothing less than saving present and future \r\ngenerations of the world’s people from wasted lives. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): I \r\nnow give the floor to the observer of the Common \r\nFund for Commodities. \r\n Mr. Mchumo (Common Fund for Commodities): \r\nIt is a great honour for the Common Fund for \r\nCommodities (CFC), and for myself, to address this \r\nmeeting to present the perspective of the Common \r\nFund with regard to the achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs).  \r\n By its very creation, the core business of the \r\nCommon Fund for Commodities is essentially to \r\ncombat poverty in developing countries by ensuring \r\ngreater productivity, increased income, and enhanced \r\nexport earnings from commodities, which constitute \r\nthe base of the economies of the majority of the \r\ndeveloping countries. The CFC undertakes projects on \r\ncommodity diversification and value addition, disease \r\nand pest control for higher productivity, and other \r\ncommodity development measures. Our main mandate \r\nis to enhance the socio-economic development of \r\ncommodity producers, giving priority to assisting \r\nsmall-holder commodity producers. The projects \r\nfinanced by the Common Fund, therefore, are aligned \r\nto make a tangible contribution to the attainment of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). \r\n Currently, three quarters of the world’s extremely \r\npoor, estimated to be about 800 million people, live in \r\nrural areas and depend on commodities and \r\ncommodity-related jobs for their livelihoods. \r\nCommodities are central for the economies of \r\ndeveloping countries, being a major source of income, \r\nemployment, trade and Government revenues. Of a \r\ntotal of 141 developing countries, 95 depend on \r\ncommodities for at least 50 per cent of their export \r\nearnings, and approximately half the countries in \r\nAfrica derive over 80 per cent of their merchandise \r\nexport income from commodities.  \r\n Considering that backdrop — where many \r\ndeveloping countries, especially the most vulnerable, \r\nare heavily dependent on commodities — one cannot \r\neffectively address the implementation of the MDGs \r\n A/65/PV.9\r\n \r\n55 10-54527 \r\n \r\nand combat poverty without taking into account the \r\nimperative of commodity development. \r\n Although in the context of the MDGs \r\ncommodities are particularly important for attaining \r\nGoal 1 — to eradicate poverty and hunger — they have \r\na cross-cutting relevance, affecting many of the agreed \r\nMDG targets. Goal 8 — to develop a global \r\npartnership for development — is another with regard \r\nto the targets addressing the needs of least developed \r\ncountries (LDCs) and developing an open, rule-based, \r\npredictable, non-discriminatory trading system. \r\nStatistics from the United Nations Conference on Trade \r\nand Development show that about 80 per cent of the \r\nagreed exports of LDCs are comprised of commodities \r\nand that for landlocked developing countries, that \r\nnumber is 70 per cent. \r\n A fairer international system for commodities \r\ntrade would result in more opportunities for poor \r\nfarmers and thus directly influence the socio-economic \r\nconditions in many of the world’s poorest countries. \r\nMarket barriers and volatile commodity prices have led \r\nmany producers in developing countries to abandon \r\ntheir farms and migrate to urban areas to look for new \r\neconomic opportunities. That creates pressure on urban \r\nareas, particularly in basic services like health, \r\neducation, drinking water and housing.  \r\n Women constitute a significant majority of the \r\nworkforce involved in commodity production. \r\nImplementing commodity measures therefore has a \r\nsignificant effect on promoting gender equality and \r\nempowering women, which is Goal 3, and that is why \r\nthe gender dimension is an integral part in the appraisal \r\nprocess of CFC projects.  \r\n Commodities also have an indirect impact on \r\nsocial development, especially in education and health. \r\nMaintaining sustainable and productive commodity \r\nsystems provides farmers and their families with food \r\nsecurity and cash income and effects the general health \r\nand education of the family. Raising the incomes of \r\ncommodity growers and ensuring that those incomes \r\nare predictable could promote rural social development \r\nin general, because farmers will be more likely to send \r\ntheir children to school. That would contribute to the \r\nimplementation of Goal 2 — universal primary \r\neducation. It would also guarantee that children are \r\nbetter nourished, thus facilitating the reduction of child \r\nmortality, as set under Goal 4.  \r\n Furthermore, it cannot be overemphasized that \r\nexport commodities are the main source of \r\nGovernment revenues in developing countries, \r\nproviding a major source of public resources to finance \r\nsocial policies. \r\n In order to implement the MDGs, the following \r\nissues should be taken into account: first, the supply \r\ncapacity limitations under which commodity producers \r\noperate, including infrastructure issues; second, the \r\nlack of diversification in commodity production; third, \r\nthe effective participation of producers, especially \r\nsmall-holders; fourth, appropriate instruments for \r\ntackling fluctuation in commodity prices; fifth, an \r\ninternational enabling environment, including an \r\nequitable, predictable and rule-based international \r\ntrade system; sixth, effective mobilization of capital \r\nand increased public spending in order to assist \r\ncommodity producers; and finally, additional resources \r\nin international official development assistance, \r\nespecially targeting the commodity sector. \r\n Finally, as repeatedly stated, commodities have a \r\nmultifaceted dimension and a cross-cutting impact that \r\nin general permeate all the targets set in the MDGs. It \r\nis necessary to make commodities a growth factor and \r\nto unlock the potential which is embedded in rich \r\nnatural and human resources.  \r\n Through its Five-Year Action Plan, the Common \r\nFund for Commodities provides a modest contribution \r\nto the achievement of the MDGs, but the challenge is \r\ngreater than the resources available. More resources \r\nneed to be committed in commodity development \r\nassistance by the international community.  \r\n We at the CFC are at a crossroads, as our member \r\ncountries are now discussing the future of the \r\norganization. In line with the General Assembly’s \r\nresolution on commodities (resolution 64/192), adopted \r\nin December 2009, we hope that we will be given \r\nenough resources to continue making a modest impact \r\nin international development and the achievements of \r\nthe MDGs towards 2015 and beyond. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): I \r\nnow give the floor to Mrs. Melinda French Gates, \r\nCo-Chair and Trustee of the Bill and Melinda Gates \r\nFoundation. \r\n Mrs. Gates (Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation): \r\nI am honoured to join the Assembly at the conclusion \r\nof this critical dialogue among world leaders about \r\nA/65/PV.9  \r\n \r\n10-54527 56 \r\n \r\nwhat I believe is one of the most urgent challenges \r\nfacing the world today: how to accelerate the progress \r\ntoward the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).  \r\n Over the past week I have heard some people say \r\nwe will never meet the MDGs. Sometimes, our \r\nimpatience with the way the world is leads us to be \r\npessimistic about our ability to change it. But at the \r\nBill and Melinda Gates Foundation, we believe we can \r\nbe very impatient with the way the world is and very \r\noptimistic that we will change it. The MDGs \r\nthemselves embody this impatient optimism. They \r\nrecognize how much there is to be done, while at the \r\nsame time signalling the scale and scope of the world’s \r\nambition. \r\n One reason I am optimistic is the progress I have \r\nseen in the 10 years since the MDGs were agreed to as \r\npart of the historic Millennium Declaration (resolution \r\n55/2). The world is not called on to conjure progress \r\nfrom a void. Instead, it is called on to learn from very \r\nreal progress on nearly all the MDGs, to expand it and \r\nto speed it up.  \r\n One refrain I hear is that we are off track on \r\nmany of the Goals. That statement is technically \r\naccurate. Not every country will meet every Goal, and \r\nthere is a risk that some of the Goals will not be met. \r\nBut that binary outlook — with total success on one \r\nside and total failure on the other and people on both \r\nsides blaming each other — obscures the extraordinary \r\nprogress driven by extraordinary people across the \r\nglobe. \r\n Take the MDG for child mortality. The goal is a \r\ntwo-thirds reduction, and we may not reach it by 2015. \r\nBut have we failed when 4 million children who would \r\nhave died in 1990 will survive in 2010? Have we failed \r\nwhen we have reduced polio, a crippling childhood \r\ndisease, by 99 per cent in the past 20 years? \r\n Another complaint I hear a lot is that progress is \r\nnot spread evenly. Some people dismiss the fact that \r\n1.3 billion people have lifted themselves out of poverty \r\nby pointing out that most of them live in China and \r\nIndia, not in African countries. I believe that when \r\npoor people lift themselves out of poverty, we ought to \r\ncelebrate, no matter where they come from. Bill and I \r\nstarted our foundation because we believe that all lives \r\nhave equal value, and I am not comfortable comparing \r\none person’s suffering to that of another.  \r\n While it is true that some countries are reducing \r\npoverty more quickly than others — and some, sadly, \r\nhave moved backwards — eight African countries have \r\nalready achieved the Goal on poverty reduction, and \r\nseveral more are on schedule to do so by 2015. Across \r\nnearly every Goal, there are inspiring examples of even \r\nthe poorest countries making dramatic improvements \r\nin short periods of time. \r\n The task ahead is to learn what the most \r\nsuccessful countries are doing right, so that we can \r\nspread their best practices. In difficult economic times, \r\nit is imperative that we increase support for effective \r\ninterventions that provide maximum value for \r\nmoney — and not shift even bigger burdens to the \r\npoorest by cutting back on development spending. \r\n Recently, we have seen some of these proven, \r\ncost-effective approaches gaining momentum, for \r\nexample, agricultural development. More than three \r\nquarters of the poor people in the world depend on \r\nfarming for their food and income, which is why \r\nagriculture is such an effective weapon against hunger \r\nand poverty. The Gates Foundation is supporting \r\npartners like the Alliance for a Green Revolution in \r\nAfrica to work with donors and developing countries to \r\ncreate new agricultural opportunities for small farmers. \r\nThe Group of Eight (G8) and Group of 20 countries \r\nincreased their commitments to agriculture last year, \r\nand many developing country Governments, especially \r\nin Africa, have followed up with spending increases of \r\ntheir own. \r\n To take another example, women’s and children’s \r\nhealth, we know that investments in women and \r\nchildren generate huge returns. A healthy mother who \r\ncan give her children a healthy start in life has a \r\ntremendous ripple effect on development. Earlier \r\ntoday, the Secretary-General launched the Global \r\nStrategy for Women’s and Children’s Health, which \r\nbuilds on the financial commitments made at the G8 \r\nmeeting in Canada this summer.  \r\n Along with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and \r\nDeputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, I was proud to \r\nannounce that the Gates Foundation has formed a \r\npartnership with the United States Agency for \r\nInternational Development, the United Kingdom \r\nDepartment for International Development and the \r\nAustralian Government Overseas Aid Program to \r\ncoordinate our efforts on the ground in poor countries. \r\n A/65/PV.9\r\n \r\n57 10-54527 \r\n \r\nThe synergy will help all of us make a bigger \r\ndifference in the lives of more women and children. \r\n So I am impatient. I am impatient because the \r\nworld is not getting better fast enough, or for enough \r\npeople. But I am also optimistic. I am optimistic \r\nbecause there are proven and affordable ways to \r\ndecrease hunger and poverty, to help mothers and their \r\nbabies thrive, and to make rapid progress on all the \r\nMDGs. \r\n And I am optimistic about one more thing. I am \r\noptimistic that our impatience will lead us all to be \r\nmore motivated, not less. I am optimistic that our sense \r\nof urgency will inspire us to work together, not to \r\nisolate ourselves. For if we are motivated, if we are \r\ninspired, if we work together, then we can meet again \r\nin five years to celebrate achievements that few of us \r\nmight have dared to imagine. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): I \r\nnow give the floor to Mr. Rajat Kumar Gupta, \r\nChairman of the International Chamber of Commerce. \r\n Mr. Gupta (International Chamber of \r\nCommerce): As Chairman of the International Chamber \r\nof Commerce (ICC), it gives me great pleasure to \r\nspeak on behalf of the global business community and \r\nthe International Chamber.  \r\n When I spoke five years ago in the General \r\nAssembly (see A/60/PV.3), the role of business in the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) was just \r\nemerging. Now we have many successes. For example, \r\nwe stand here today knowing that we have made a \r\ndramatic impact in saving mothers and children from \r\nmalaria. In the past 10 years, we have saved nearly \r\nthree quarters of a million children across Africa. \r\nTechnological solutions were made available through \r\nlong-lasting insecticide-treated nets, and Governments \r\nprovided additional financing through the World Bank \r\nand the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and \r\nMalaria.  \r\n But what was critical to the success was a \r\nprivate-sector approach scale up efforts to achieve \r\nuniversal coverage by 2010, employing a war-room \r\ntype strategy to meet that Goal through better supply \r\nchain planning, improved logistics, innovative \r\nfinancing approaches, and more. If that attitude is \r\nmaintained through 2015, we can save an additional \r\nthree million lives. Those gains are truly critical \r\nbecause success has a multiplier effect in making \r\nAfrica a successful destination for investment and \r\neconomic growth. \r\n Business does need to step up through innovative \r\npartnerships, co-investment and direct financial \r\ncontributions. I have spent much of my life in a \r\ndialogue among business, government and civil \r\nsociety, and I speak to this Assembly today as a true \r\nbeliever in the ideal that when all three work together \r\nin public-private partnerships, our world does work \r\nbetter. \r\n In 2006, for example, Nestle began working with \r\nlocal communities in India, Pakistan and Africa on \r\nwater efficiency. That partnership has expanded \r\nthrough the World Bank’s International Finance \r\nCorporation, McKinsey and Company and a number of \r\nother companies. They are now working with \r\nGovernments to solve the water problem, watershed by \r\nwatershed. Those partnerships bring results for society \r\nby expanding community access to water and \r\nimproving both quality and efficiency. \r\n To capture and encourage the benefits of \r\nincreased private-sector investment, Governments and \r\ndevelopment agencies need to work much more \r\ndirectly with business to identify investment \r\nimpediments and remedies and to enhance the capacity \r\nto create business-enabling environments. However, \r\nmistrust and misunderstanding sometimes prevent us \r\nfrom working together more often in those types of \r\nendeavours. When that happens, we all lose: business \r\nloses opportunity and government loses credibility, but \r\nsociety loses most of all. We must overcome this \r\nmistrust, and I commit, as Chair of the ICC, that I will \r\nadvocate among our hundreds of thousands of \r\nmembers to increase our contribution to the \r\nachievement of the MDGs. \r\n Public-private partnerships will get us closer to \r\nthe MDGs, but economic growth, entrepreneurship and \r\njob creation are absolutely fundamental. Global trade \r\nand investment are the engines to move hundreds of \r\nmillions of people out of poverty and to achieve the \r\nMDGs — which is why the Governments need to \r\ncreate this enabling environment. The biggest lesson \r\nfrom emerging economies and less developed countries \r\nis that the greatest source of development has been \r\nbusiness, enterprise creation, productivity growth and \r\njob creation. \r\n In the most underdeveloped economies, the aid \r\nand innovative financing provided by the rich countries \r\nA/65/PV.9  \r\n \r\n10-54527 58 \r\n \r\ncan create a minimum threshold required for the \r\nprivate sector to truly prosper. And in every country, \r\nleaders like those gathered here set the framework for \r\nlocal entrepreneurship: for setting up businesses, for \r\nclosing them down, for formalizing national \r\neconomies, and so on. Further, Governments set the \r\nframework for national competitiveness, for how to \r\nprotect workers, enforce contracts and protect \r\nintellectual property and for other initiatives. \r\n That is why it is important for Governments to \r\ncreate a level playing field: to create an enabling \r\nenvironment for enterprises of all sizes and sectors to \r\ndevelop, to create jobs and to pursue technological \r\ninnovation and cooperation. Economic growth and our \r\nambitions for the eradication of poverty depend upon \r\nthe energy and drive of business and commerce. We at \r\nICC are committed to trade, investment and job \r\ncreation, and we should resist the urges of \r\nprotectionism in these challenging economic times.  \r\n Now let me talk about a topic that is often not \r\nlinked to the MDGs but is critically important. The \r\nworld is undergoing the largest wave of urban growth \r\nin history. As of 2008, more than half of the world’s \r\npopulation was living in towns and cities. By 2030 that \r\nnumber will swell to almost 5 billion, with urban \r\ngrowth concentrated in Africa and Asia. While mega-\r\ncities have captured much public attention, most of the \r\nnew growth will occur in smaller towns and cities, \r\nwhich have fewer resources with which to respond to \r\nthe magnitude of the change. \r\n Poverty is now growing faster in urban areas than \r\nin rural areas. One billion people live in urban slums, \r\nwhich are typically overcrowded, polluted and \r\ndangerous and lack the basic services such as clean \r\nwater and sanitation. The MDGs cannot be achieved \r\nwithout solving the smart-urbanization problem.  \r\n Addressing the challenges of meeting the MDGs \r\nby 2015 will require concerted efforts and partnerships \r\nby all actors in society. My message to Governments is \r\nthat they cannot hope for development without \r\nbusiness, but business needs Governments to be \r\nsuccessful. Whenever we see evidence of the private \r\nsector driving development, in every single case the \r\nGovernment got the conditions right. Governments, \r\nand Governments alone, get to set those conditions that \r\nenable business to grow and, in turn, societies to \r\nprosper. \r\n I would urge Government leaders to have higher \r\nexpectation of what business can deliver. We must \r\nbring innovative approaches to education, health, \r\nmunicipal services, and so on. Such approaches could \r\ninclude the normal business incentives for the private \r\nsector to rapidly ramp up and provide much needed \r\ncapacity in all such fields. That may sound like \r\naspirations aimed too high, but I believe that \r\ndevelopment that fails to leverage the best of business \r\nis development aimed too low. \r\n In summary, I believe that the success of the \r\nMDGs is possible and that public-private partnerships \r\nare part of that success. But we cannot forget that our \r\ngreatest chance of achieving the MDGs will be through \r\neconomic growth, which requires us to fundamentally \r\naddress access to education, universal health care, \r\nenvironmentally responsible growth and the challenges \r\nof urbanization. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): I \r\nnow give the floor to Ms. Zhou Lu, who will speak for \r\nFriendship across Frontiers. \r\n Ms. Zhou Lu (Friendship across Frontiers): The \r\nco-founder of the London School of Economics, \r\nGeorge Bernard Shaw, once said that progress is \r\nimpossible without change, and those who cannot \r\nchange their minds cannot change anything. We are \r\nhere today. That is the best proof of progress that \r\nreflects far more change than just the change of minds.   \r\n Not so long ago, the prevalent notion of business \r\nwas that the only social responsibility of business is to \r\nmake profits. Yet today, business leaders from many \r\ndeveloping countries, such as my country, China, have \r\nshown that true sustainable value does not come from \r\nprofits but from making a real difference. We all \r\nrealize that Governments alone cannot tackle many of \r\nthe problems that we face today. The collaboration and \r\ncommitment of the private sector and civil society, \r\nworking in partnership with Governments, are \r\nindispensable to achieve the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs) — a collaboration based on solidarity, \r\nnot charity. \r\n That is why we are here today with the \r\ncommitment to address the challenges of the MDGs \r\nand to do so collaboratively with all concerned \r\nstakeholders — Governments, business and non-\r\ngovernmental partners — and to do it in a way that \r\nensures national ownership and the empowerment of \r\nthe poor. \r\n A/65/PV.9\r\n \r\n59 10-54527 \r\n \r\n We need to commit to mobilizing the requisite \r\nresources and to using them effectively and to \r\nenhancing South-South cooperation. We know the gaps \r\nand we know what works and what does not. We know \r\nthat a fairer trading system and private investment are \r\nessential, not just external aid. We cannot wait. It is \r\ntime to join efforts, to partner and to collaborate.  \r\n It is time for the private sector and civil society to \r\nexplore new forms of multi-stakeholder partnerships \r\nthat are focused on investing in the underprivileged. \r\nThis important event is an opportunity to invite the \r\nprivate sector to develop business models and \r\nstrategies for achieving the MDGs, using the rigours of \r\nthe market place, its management expertise and its \r\nlogistic systems to move beyond corporate social \r\nresponsibility to create a shared value for all \r\nstakeholders. \r\n Since we all recognize that the MDGs are a \r\nresponsibility for all citizens, we should encourage all \r\ncitizens and civil society to create a culture of personal \r\nresponsibility and encourage social innovation to \r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals. \r\n I urge participants, in their different roles, to be \r\nmore innovative in considering new forms of \r\npartnerships for the achievement of the MDGs. I come \r\nfrom China, the world’s workshop, and I am proud of \r\nwhat we have achieved with hard work, ingenuity and \r\nexpanding partnerships. Some 700 years ago, a group \r\nof Venetians left their homeland and headed for the \r\nEast. It took them 24 years to return to their homeland, \r\nand Marco Polo said “I have not told half what I saw”. \r\nToday we have many more resources than previously. \r\nTherefore, we need to repeat that endeavour and come \r\nform every corner of the world and work with each \r\nother. There is a wealth of promise and potential that \r\ncan benefit us all in our endeavours to lift people from \r\npoverty.  \r\n The world is so interconnected. What happens in \r\none part ripples and affects another part, and we need \r\nto keep that in mind in our efforts and our promise to \r\nachieve the MDGs and, as the Secretary-General said, \r\nmake it happen. \r\n The Co-Chair (Mr. Deiss) (spoke in French): I \r\nnow come to the final remarks of the President of the \r\nsixty-fifth session of the General Assembly, for which I \r\nhave chosen the title “We will do more to achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals”.  \r\n Our High-level Meeting is coming to an end. By \r\nadopting the final document (resolution 65/1), we have \r\nreaffirmed that keeping the promise made in the year \r\n2000 and achieving the Millennium Development \r\nGoals is a moral duty. It is an essential contribution to \r\nglobal peace, security and prosperity. We are \r\ndetermined to fulfil that duty. \r\n That message is clear to all participants, and I \r\nhave heard it from all participants. I welcome the many \r\nnew proposals and commitments that were made \r\nduring our debate, commitments to increase official \r\ndevelopment assistance, to develop innovative \r\nfinancing and, in particular, to mobilize domestic \r\nresources. \r\n However, it is not financial resources that make \r\nthe difference. It is important that the policies \r\nimplemented at the international and national levels \r\npromote development, through opening of markets, \r\nimproving governance and giving priority in national \r\nbudgets to public spending to promote the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. \r\n What matters now is that our words be followed \r\nby action and that they have concrete results for the \r\nmillions of men, women and children living in poverty. \r\nWe will have to closely monitor the implementation of \r\nour commitments. The annual reports of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral will allow us to measure the results. The \r\nGeneral Assembly will play its role, in particular \r\nthrough a special event to take place in 2013. \r\n That is how we will show that we are trustworthy \r\npartners, credible and responsible. That is essential, \r\nand I said so in my statement at the opening of this \r\nPlenary Meeting. If we want to succeed, we must work \r\ntogether. The commitment of both donors and \r\nrecipients is needed, as an authentic partnership. That \r\npartnership should extend to civil society and the \r\nprivate sector. \r\n In that regard, I am impressed by the strong \r\ncommitment of civil society and private sector partners \r\nto the Millennium Development Goals. Over \r\n150 events have been organized here in New York by \r\nthe partners. A broad range of questions fundamental to \r\ndevelopment have been addressed. That profusion of \r\nevents facilitated the exchange of lessons learned and \r\ngood practices and strengthened partnerships. We are \r\nstronger as we continue. \r\nA/65/PV.9  \r\n \r\n10-54527 60 \r\n \r\n Formation of partnerships between the public \r\nsector and the private sector is a powerful tool for \r\ndevelopment. The roles of both those actors are \r\ncomplementary. Governments must establish the \r\nconditions that will allow the private sector to \r\ninnovate, invest and create jobs. That is the condition \r\nfor lasting success. It is heartening to note that today \r\ncompanies are exploring innovative models that are \r\nbetter adapted to meeting the needs of the poor. \r\n This afternoon I attended the launch of one \r\nexample of a broad partnership, the Global Strategy for \r\nWomen’s and Children’s Health, entitled “Every \r\nwoman, every child”. At the initiative of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, the Global Strategy is united around the same \r\ngoal and includes not only the 192 United Nations \r\nMember States, but also representatives of civil \r\nsociety, the private sector and foundations. Such \r\ninitiatives are encouraging. I take this opportunity to \r\nthank all of those who have made a commitment to the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, and I hope that others \r\nwill follow their example. \r\n We have five years more to prove our \r\ndetermination. But if we want to strengthen our \r\nprogress, we must make a greater investment in  \r\n \r\ndisaster prevention and risk reduction. An earthquake \r\nin Haiti, forest fires in Russia, floods in Pakistan — \r\nunfortunately, that list is not exhaustive. This year, the \r\nenormous human, social, economic and environmental \r\ncost of natural disasters has been demonstrated far too \r\noften. Real success will be achieved only if \r\ndevelopment is sustainable and if our economic \r\nstructures are respectful of humanity and its \r\nenvironment. \r\n After these three days of debate, I remain \r\noptimistic. We will achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. Ladies and gentlemen, I am \r\ncounting on you. \r\n Before adjourning this meeting, I wish to remind \r\nmembers that the closing meeting of the High-level \r\nPlenary Meeting as a contribution to the 2010 \r\nInternational Year of Biodiversity will take place \r\nimmediately after the adjournment of this meeting in \r\nthis Hall. \r\n I declare closed the High-level Plenary Meeting \r\nof the sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly. \r\n The meeting rose at 10.05 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n"
