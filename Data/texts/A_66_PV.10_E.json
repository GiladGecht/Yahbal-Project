(Qatar) \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 6.10 p.m.  \r\n \r\n \r\nHigh-level Meeting of the General Assembly on the \r\nPrevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases \r\n \r\nAgenda item 117 (continued) \r\n \r\nFollow-up to the outcome of the Millennium Summit \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): In accordance \r\nwith resolution 31/3, of 18 October 1976, I now give \r\nthe floor to the observer of the Commonwealth \r\nSecretariat. \r\n Ms. Anie (Commonwealth Secretariat): The \r\nCommonwealth Secretariat is honoured to make a \r\nstatement at this High-level Meeting of the General \r\nAssembly on the Prevention and Control of \r\nNon-communicable Diseases. Commonwealth heads of \r\nGovernment called for the United Nations to host such \r\na summit when they last met, in Trinidad and Tobago \r\nin 2009. We are pleased that this call to action has \r\ncontributed to the momentum behind this meeting \r\ntoday. \r\n The Commonwealth family comprises 54 countries \r\non five continents. We account for a third of the \r\nworld’s population, a quarter of its countries and a fifth \r\nof its trade. We are a family of varied countries — rich \r\nand poor, large and small, but all aspiring to the shared \r\nprinciples of overcoming poverty, ignorance and \r\ndisease, raising standards of living and achieving a \r\nmore equitable society.  \r\n Of the estimated 19.5 million deaths in the \r\nCommonwealth in 2008, 9.3 million were due to \r\nnon-communicable diseases (NCDs), including mental \r\nand blood disorders and oral diseases. In comparison, \r\n44 per cent of deaths were caused by communicable \r\ndiseases and maternal, perinatal and nutritional \r\nconditions, and 9 per cent resulted from injuries, \r\nincluding road traffic fatalities. One third of the deaths \r\nfrom NCDs occurred before the age of 60 years.  \r\n The Commonwealth is greatly and adversely \r\naffected by the double burden of communicable and \r\nnon-communicable diseases alike. Within our 54 member \r\ncountries, 65 per cent of our 2.4 billion citizens are \r\naffected by HIV. We acknowledge the increasing \r\npressure placed upon already overstretched health \r\nsystems from this double burden of disease and, \r\ntherefore, the need for a comprehensive and integrated \r\nresponse.  \r\n The Commonwealth acknowledges the link \r\nbetween NCDs and poverty and, furthermore, the threat \r\nthis epidemic poses to sustainable development. We are \r\ncognizant that unless there is a high-level commitment \r\nto responding to the NCD epidemic, the gains that \r\nCommonwealth members have made towards \r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals will be \r\nthreatened. For that reason, this high-level event is \r\nparticularly timely.  \r\n The Commonwealth itself has confirmed its \r\ncommitment to respond to the NCD epidemic and \r\nincrease the ability of countries to respond to the \r\nemerging health crisis. In that regard, Commonwealth \r\nheads of Government, in their 2009 statement on \r\ncommonwealth action to combat non-communicable \r\nA/66/PV.10  \r\n \r\n11-50686 2 \r\n \r\ndiseases, noted with concern that the poorest people are \r\nthe most vulnerable to the impacts of these diseases. \r\nThat statement has since been operationalized into the \r\nCommonwealth road map on NCDs, which outlines \r\nactivities for the Commonwealth Secretariat to pursue, \r\nincluding developing advocacy strategies, informing \r\nand influencing global thinking, disseminating \r\nknowledge about best practices, building capacity and \r\ninstitutional strengthening. \r\n The Commonwealth Secretariat chose \r\n“Non-communicable diseases: a priority for the \r\nCommonwealth” as the theme for the 2011 \r\nCommonwealth health ministers’ meting. Furthermore, \r\nthe theme for the 2012 meeting will be focused on the \r\nlinkages between non-communicable and \r\ncommunicable diseases. \r\n Mr. Cazeau (Haiti), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n Young people are an important area of focus. As \r\n60 per cent of its citizens are under 30 years of age, the \r\nCommonwealth has a strong focus on young people. \r\nEncouraging meaningful youth engagement and \r\nparticipation is central to the Commonwealth Plan of \r\nAction for Youth Empowerment.  \r\n The Commonwealth, furthermore, continues to \r\ndraw attention to the gender dimensions of NCDs, \r\nspecifically by recognizing the different prevalence \r\nrates of the major risk factors and diseases between \r\nmen and women. Importantly, too, it is often women \r\nand girls who act as principal caregivers for household \r\nmembers who became unwell. The burden of care has \r\nsignificant socio-economic implications for them and \r\ntheir families. The theme of the Commonwealth for \r\n2011, “Women as agents of change”, was chosen in \r\nrecognition of women’s contribution to society and \r\nemphasizes the fact that when they prosper, their \r\ncommunities also prosper. \r\n We are pleased by the examples of good practice \r\nemerging in the Commonwealth. We commend the \r\nresponse of the various regions and their leadership on \r\nNCDs. In particular, we note the pioneering holding of \r\nthe Regional Summit of Heads of Government of the \r\nCaribbean Community on Chronic Non-Communicable \r\nDiseases, in 2007. We commend the work of civil \r\nsociety, which has informed and empowered others to \r\nbetter prevent and control NCDs throughout the world. \r\nThe Commonwealth fully supports the global \r\ncommunity’s efforts and commitments towards \r\npreventing and controlling the spread of NCDs. We \r\nwill continue to work with member countries and \r\npartners across all sectors to ensure an accelerated, \r\nmultisectoral and evidence-based response to the \r\nepidemic. We further commit to deepening \r\nCommonwealth efforts beyond this event.  \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): In \r\naccordance with resolution 64/124, of 16 December \r\n2009, I now give the floor to the observer of the \r\nParliamentary Assembly of the Mediterranean. \r\n Mr. Amoruso (Parliamentary Assembly of the \r\nMediterranean) (spoke in Italian; English text provided \r\nby the delegation): It is an honour to take part in this \r\nHigh-level Meeting on the Prevention and Control of \r\nNon-communicable Diseases on behalf of the \r\nParliamentary Assembly of the Mediterranean (PAM), \r\nand to share with the General Assembly the tangible \r\nresults achieved in this field by our unique network of \r\nparliamentarians in the Mediterranean. \r\n As many General Assembly members know, the \r\nParliamentary Assembly was established in 2006 to \r\nbring together parliamentarians from the \r\nMediterranean region. We are an inter-State \r\norganization comprised of 26 member States and \r\nresulting from the maturation of a regional political \r\nprocess initiated within the Inter-Parliamentary Union. \r\n After having addressed the High-level Meeting \r\non the Millennium Development Goals one year ago, \r\non 22 September 2010 (see A/65/PV.9), I am proud to \r\nagain have the unique opportunity to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly on behalf of parliamentarians from \r\nthe northern and southern shores of mare nostrum. This \r\nis a symbol of our unity in making another decisive \r\nstep towards the goals set for 2015, which is a priority \r\nthat constantly leads our actions. \r\n As highlighted by the Regional Office for the \r\nEastern Mediterranean of the World Health \r\nOrganization (WHO) and as shown in the statistics for \r\nthe rest of the Mediterranean region, the burden of \r\nnon-communicable diseases (NCDs) on the public \r\nhealth services of Mediterranean countries calls for \r\nimmediate and coordinated action at the regional and \r\ninternational levels. \r\n We, the parliamentarians of the Mediterranean, \r\nwish to take full advantage of this High-level Meeting \r\nto call for concerted action in monitoring, mobilizing \r\nappropriate resources and strengthening capacities to \r\npursue the fight against these threats to life and \r\n A/66/PV.10\r\n \r\n3 11-50686 \r\n \r\nsocio-economic development. We are doing so in what \r\nis a decisive time for our region and in line with the \r\nGlobal Strategy for the Prevention and Control of \r\nNon-communicable Diseases, endorsed by the World \r\nHealth Assembly in 2000, and its related Action Plan, \r\nadopted in 2008 by WHO and Member States. \r\n The Parliamentary Assembly of the Mediterranean \r\nhas mobilized its unique multisectoral network in the \r\nMediterranean to support United Nations action, in \r\ncoordination with Member States, as well as with other \r\ninternational and regional bodies. PAM has strongly \r\nsupported and welcomed the inauguration of the WHO \r\nMediterranean Centre for Health Risk Reduction in \r\nTunisia in July 2010. We intend to continue to assist \r\nthe Centre in promoting interregional cooperation, \r\nnotably by strengthening public health capacities to \r\ntackle the growing burden of NCDs in the \r\nMediterranean. \r\n In close cooperation with the United Nations \r\nsystem and a wide range of partners, the Parliamentary \r\nAssembly of the Mediterranean is already mobilizing \r\nits network, using a multisectoral approach to create a \r\npool of high-level members of Parliament, experts and \r\nnon-governmental organization representatives in the \r\nregion to address specific issues in line with the \r\npriorities on the international agenda.  \r\n An example of such efforts was the most recent \r\nmeeting of PAM’s panel on economic issues, held at \r\nthe United Nations Office at Geneva in May, in close \r\ncooperation with the Inter-Agency Cluster on Trade \r\nand Productive Capacity. We wish to assure General \r\nAssembly members today that this network will fully \r\ncontribute to implementing the actions proposed in the \r\nPolitical Declaration (A/66/2, annex) adopted at the \r\nHigh-level Meeting. \r\n On behalf of PAM, I wish to solemnly assure the \r\nAssembly that our unique Mediterranean network of \r\nparliamentarians remains ready to use its capacity to \r\nlegislate, oversee our executives and vote on budgets \r\nso as to ensure that the United Nations agenda on \r\nNCDs is implemented as a top priority in our region. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I \r\ndeclare closed the High-level Meeting of the General \r\nAssembly on the Prevention and Control of \r\nNon-communicable Diseases. \r\n The General Assembly has thus concluded this \r\nstage of its consideration of agenda item 117. \r\n  The meeting rose at 6.30 p.m. \r\n"
