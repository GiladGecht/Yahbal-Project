(Qatar) \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 9.05 a.m.  \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 110 \r\n \r\nReport of the Secretary-General on the work of the \r\nOrganization (A/66/1) \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): In accordance \r\nwith the decision taken at its 2nd plenary meeting, held \r\non 16 September 2011, the General Assembly will hear \r\na presentation by the Secretary-General of his annual \r\nreport on the work of the Organization, under agenda \r\nitem 110. I give the floor to the Secretary-General. \r\n The Secretary-General: Late next month a child \r\nwill be born — the 7 billionth citizen of our planet \r\nEarth. Let us assume this child is a girl. Most likely, \r\nshe will be poor. She may, or may not, grow up to be \r\nhealthy and strong. If she is especially lucky, she will \r\nbe educated and go out into the world, full of hopes \r\nand dreams. Beyond that, we know only one thing with \r\ncertainty: she will enter a world of vast and \r\nunpredictable change — environmental, economic, \r\ngeopolitical, technological and demographic. \r\n The world’s population has tripled since the \r\nUnited Nations was created. And our numbers keep \r\ngrowing, as do the pressures on land, energy, food and \r\nwater. The global economic crisis continues to shake \r\nbusinesses, Governments and families around the \r\nworld. Joblessness is rising. Social inequalities grow \r\nwider. Too many people live in fear.  \r\n The United Nations exists to serve those in whose \r\nname it was conceived: “We the peoples”. During the \r\npast five years as United Nations Secretary-General, I \r\nhave travelled the world to meet people where they \r\nlive, to hear their hopes and fears. Two weeks ago I \r\nvisited Kiribati and the Solomon Islands. Villagers told \r\nme of their fear of climate change. Rising seas are \r\nwashing into their homes. One day, they may be swept \r\naway entirely. \r\n A young girl named Tamauri mustered her \r\ncourage to speak. “What will become of us?” she \r\nasked. “What can the United Nations do for us?” \r\nToday, I pose her question to all of you — heads of \r\nState and Government and leaders of the world. What \r\ncan we do? How can we help these people find greater \r\npeace, prosperity and justice in a world of crises? \r\n As I reflect on my time in office during the past \r\nfive years, I am full of passionate conviction — \r\nunshakable faith in the enduring importance of this \r\nnoble United Nations. Today, I would like to share with \r\nthe Assembly my perspective on the way ahead. As I \r\nsee it, we have five imperatives, five generational \r\nopportunities to shape the world of tomorrow by the \r\ndecisions we make today.  \r\n The first and greatest of these is sustainable \r\ndevelopment — the imperative of the twenty-first \r\ncentury. Saving our planet, lifting people out of \r\npoverty and advancing economic growth — those are \r\none and the same fight. We must connect the dots \r\nbetween climate change, water scarcity, energy \r\nshortages, global health, the food crisis and women’s \r\nempowerment. Solutions to one problem must be \r\nsolutions for all. Rio+20 must succeed. We must make \r\nA/66/PV.11  \r\n \r\n11-50692 2 \r\n \r\nprogress on climate change. We cannot burn our way to \r\nthe future. We cannot pretend the danger does not exist \r\nor dismiss it because it affects someone else. \r\n Today, I call on those gathered here to reach a \r\nbinding climate change agreement, one with more \r\nambitious national and global emissions targets. And \r\nwe need action on the ground, now, on cutting \r\nemissions and on adaptation. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n Energy is key — key to our planet and our way of \r\nlife. That is why we have launched a new pioneering \r\ninitiative entitled “Sustainable energy for all”. \r\n We must invest in human potential, specifically in \r\neducation and in the health of women and children. \r\nDevelopment cannot be called sustainable unless it is \r\nequitable and benefits all. \r\n We must step up our efforts to achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) and go even \r\nfurther. Today, I call upon the Assembly to take a larger \r\nview, to think beyond the horizon of 2015. Let us \r\ndecide on a new generation of sustainable development \r\ngoals that will succeed the MDGs, and let us agree on \r\nways to make them real. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n We have a second great opportunity before us, \r\nnamely, prevention. \r\n This year, the United Nations peacekeeping \r\nbudget will total $8 billion. Consider the savings if we \r\nact before conflicts erupt, by deploying political \r\nmediation missions, for example, rather than troops. \r\nWe know how to do this. Our record proves it — in \r\nGuinea, Kenya, Kyrgyzstan. \r\n To prevent violations of human rights, we must \r\nwork for the rule of law and stand against impunity. We \r\nhave carved out new dimensions for the responsibility \r\nto protect, and we will continue. To prevent runaway \r\ndamage from natural disasters, we must work for better \r\ndisaster-risk reduction and preparedness.  \r\n Let us remember: development is ultimately the \r\nbest prevention. Today, I ask for your support. Let us \r\ncommit the resources required. Let us raise prevention \r\nfrom an abstract concept to a core operating principle \r\nacross the spectrum of our work. \r\n There is a third imperative: building a safer and \r\nmore secure world — our core responsibility at the \r\nUnited Nations. This year we were sorely tested.  \r\n In Côte d’Ivoire, we stood firm for democracy \r\nand human rights. Working closely with our regional \r\npartners, we made a difference in the lives of millions \r\nof people. In Afghanistan and Iraq, we will carry out \r\nour missions with determination and commitment to \r\nthe people of these proud nations. \r\n In Darfur, we continue to save lives and help \r\nkeep peace under difficult conditions. Our success \r\ndemands the cooperation and full support of the \r\ninternational community, the parties on the ground and \r\nthe Sudanese Government. In the Sudan, the parties to \r\nthe Comprehensive Peace Agreement must work \r\ntogether to prevent conflict and settle outstanding \r\nissues. \r\n In the Middle East, we must break the stalemate. \r\nWe have long agreed that Palestinians deserve a State. \r\nIsrael needs security. Both want peace. We pledge our \r\nunrelenting efforts to help achieve that peace through a \r\nnegotiated settlement. \r\n We must be innovative in maximizing the unique \r\nforce for good that is United Nations peacekeeping. We \r\nare pioneering new approaches. We have strengthened \r\nour field support and reconfigured the architecture of \r\npeacekeeping operations. In places like the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo and Sierra Leone, we are \r\nbuilding peace by advancing civil society, promoting \r\nthe rule of law and creating institutions of honest and \r\neffective governance. \r\n Today we are capable of more rapid and effective \r\nresponse than ever before, and we will so continue. We \r\nremain the world’s first emergency responders — in \r\nPakistan, Haiti and elsewhere. It is essential that we \r\ncontinue to build on our most innovative and effective \r\ntool for humanitarian relief — the Central Emergency \r\nResponse Fund, also known as CERF. \r\n Famine in Somalia continues to spread. I appeal \r\nto the Assembly: help save the children of the Horn of \r\nAfrica. \r\n As we learned in Fukushima and elsewhere, \r\nnuclear accidents do not respect national borders. We \r\nneed global action. We need strong international safety \r\nstandards to prevent future disasters. \r\n A/66/PV.11\r\n \r\n3 11-50692 \r\n \r\n Let us keep pushing on disarmament and \r\nnon-proliferation. Let us fulfil the dream: a world free \r\nof nuclear weapons. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n The fourth imperative is to support nations in \r\ntransition. \r\n The extraordinary events that have taken place \r\nthis year in North Africa and the Middle East have \r\nbeen a source of inspiration. Let us make sure that the \r\nArab Spring becomes a song of hope for all. In Libya, \r\nwe are deploying a new United Nations support \r\nmission to assist the Libyan authorities in forming a \r\nnew Government and a new legal order, which is the \r\ndesire of the Libyan people. The current situation in \r\nSyria is of particular concern. For six months now, we \r\nhave been seeing an escalation of violence and \r\nrepression. The Government has repeatedly promised \r\nto adopt reforms and listen to the people. It has done \r\nnothing of the sort. Now is the time for action. The \r\nviolence must end.  \r\n Others are also counting on us. A country \r\nemerging from war puts its autocratic regime behind it, \r\nbrings its people out of poverty and turns towards new \r\nprosperity. The United Nations must assist such a \r\ncountry as it embarks upon the right path. Most likely \r\nit will have to help that country set up legal machinery \r\nand public services, organize elections, or write a new \r\nconstitution.  \r\n Today, our task is to consolidate such progress \r\nand put in practice what we have learned from our \r\nexperiences. The growing difficulty is most clearly \r\nseen in what we are doing to assist South Sudan set up \r\nfunctioning State structures after decades of conflict. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n Fifth and finally, we can dramatically advance \r\nour efforts in every sphere with, and working for, \r\nwomen and young people.  \r\n Women hold up more than half the sky and \r\nrepresent much of the world’s unrealized potential. \r\nThey are the educators. They raise the children, and \r\nthey hold families together. Increasingly, women drive \r\neconomies. They are natural leaders. We need their full \r\nengagement — in Government, business and civil \r\nsociety. And this year, for the first time, we have \r\nUN-Women, our own unique and powerful engine for \r\ndynamic change. \r\n I am especially pleased to see so many women at \r\nthis year’s session of the Assembly. I welcome in \r\nparticular President Dilma Rousseff of Brazil, the first \r\nwoman in United Nations history to open the general \r\ndebate. We can be proud of the number of women \r\nleaders we have at the United Nations, and we will \r\ncontinue our policy of promoting women at all levels \r\nof the Organization. \r\n We will focus on the new generation. Young \r\npeople are more than our future; they are also our \r\npresent, both in numbers and in how they drive \r\npolitical and social change. We must find new ways to \r\ncreate decent jobs and opportunities for them around \r\nthe world. \r\n These are extraordinary challenges, and we \r\ncannot respond in ordinary ways. We need one thing \r\nabove all else: solidarity. That begins with the obvious: \r\nwithout resources, we cannot deliver.  \r\n Today, I ask the Governments that have \r\ntraditionally borne the lion’s share of the costs not to \r\nflag in their generosity. Budgets are tight. Yet we also \r\nknow that investing through the United Nations is \r\nsmart policy. Sharing burdens makes the load lighter. \r\nScaling back is no answer. To the rising Powers among \r\nyou, whose dynamism increasingly drives the global \r\neconomy, I say that with power comes responsibility. \r\nFor all, I ask that you give what you can — expertise, \r\npeacekeepers, helicopters. Never underestimate the \r\npower of your leadership. Again and again, I have seen \r\nhow the smallest nations make some of the largest \r\ncontributions to our work. \r\n Governments cannot do the job alone. To deliver \r\nfor those in need, we must broaden our base and extend \r\nour reach. We must harness the full power of \r\npartnership across the Organization. Our successes in \r\nthe fight against malaria show the way. We see the \r\ntransformative power of partnership in our Every \r\nWoman, Every Child initiative, with funding \r\ncommitments of more than $40 billion — four times \r\nthe annual United Nations budget. When we combine \r\nthe unparalleled convening authority and technical \r\nresources of the United Nations with the various \r\nstrengths of Governments, the private sector and civil \r\nsociety, we are a formidable force for good. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n Finally, we must change with the times. At this \r\ntime of budgetary austerity, we must do more with less. \r\nA/66/PV.11  \r\n \r\n11-50692 4 \r\n \r\nWe must better invest taxpayers’ money, eliminate \r\nwaste and avoid duplication by delivering as one. \r\nAccountability and transparency remain our \r\nwatchwords.  \r\n We are accountable to the Member States, yet we \r\ncannot become more efficient without their strong and \r\nconsistent support. We must streamline the budget \r\nprocess and help the United Nations to undertake the \r\nnecessary measures so that no nation must act on its \r\nown. We must maintain our efforts to build a more \r\nmodern and mobile workforce — a United Nations that \r\nis faster and more flexible; a United Nations that \r\ninnovates and draws on the power of social networks \r\nand new technologies; a United Nations that helps \r\nsolve real problems in real time. \r\n Lastly, let us do everything we can to protect \r\nUnited Nations staff. We have lost so many lives; the \r\nUnited Nations has become an easy target. Today let us \r\nremember with gratitude those who serve with such \r\ndedication in so many dangerous places. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n Here in this great Hall, the shrinking islands in \r\nthe Pacific may seem far away. Yet I hear that young \r\ngirl’s plea as clearly as if she were next to me. Perhaps \r\nthat is because, 60 years ago, I was that child. The \r\nUnited Nations is the answer now, as it was then. \r\nStanding here today, I hear many millions of other \r\nyoung boys and girls asking for our help, looking for \r\nhope. “We the peoples”, 7 billion, now look to us, the \r\nworld’s leaders. They need solutions. They demand \r\nleadership. They want us to act, to act with \r\ncompassion, courage and conviction; to act in concert, \r\nnations united at the United Nations. \r\n Let us carry on this journey together. I thank \r\nthose gathered here very much for their leadership and \r\ncommitment. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I thank the \r\nSecretary-General for his presentation. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 8 \r\n \r\nGeneral debate \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): It is indeed an \r\nhonour for me to welcome participants to the general \r\ndebate of the sixty-sixth session of the General \r\nAssembly. I would like to express my sincere gratitude \r\nfor members’ active participation in the High-level \r\nMeetings over the past two days. I would also like to \r\ntake this opportunity to thank the Secretary-General, \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his outstanding \r\nleadership of the United Nations and for his initiative \r\nin organizing a number of important high-level events \r\nthis week. I wish everyone great success in these \r\nimportant discussions. \r\n Let there be no doubt that 2011 is a year of new \r\nhorizons. A look around the Hall today shows just that: \r\nnew faces and new friends. To everyone I say welcome \r\nto the global family. New friends and old, we will work \r\ntogether to ensure that the shifts taking place across the \r\nglobe result in stable and prosperous democracies, \r\ncontinued growth and development, and the protection \r\nand promotion of human rights in the interest of all the \r\ncitizens of the world. \r\n We also welcome the newest Member State, \r\nSouth Sudan, to the United Nations. In doing so, it \r\nmust be acknowledged that the issue of Palestine will \r\nbe particularly crucial and will receive great attention \r\nthis session. I look forward to working with all \r\nMember States for the attainment of a just, \r\ncomprehensive and negotiated peace settlement in the \r\nMiddle East, based on a two-State solution. I am fully \r\ncommitted to proceeding in a transparent, impartial \r\nmanner and in keeping with the expressed will of the \r\ncollective membership of the United Nations. Fairness \r\nand justice will be key pillars of any sustainable \r\npolitical endeavour. \r\n Addressing the critical issues on the agenda of \r\nthe Assembly’s sixty-sixth session will require political \r\nwill, open dialogue, close collaboration and consensus-\r\nbuilding. For that reason, I am deeply and fully \r\ncommitted to working with each Member State, as well \r\nas with all major stakeholders, to build bridges for a \r\nunited global partnership.  \r\n In carrying out our joint responsibilities, I place \r\ngreat value in South-South and triangular cooperation, \r\nas well as on dialogue among civilizations and \r\nadvancing the culture of peace. I intend to accord the \r\nmost vulnerable countries the support they so need and \r\ndeserve. Let us therefore always bear in mind the need \r\nfor just and fair solutions that are based on the \r\npurposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. \r\n In meeting the expectations of the world, it is our \r\nresponsibility to remain thoughtful and focused on our \r\nobjectives. Therefore, I have identified four key areas \r\nto help frame our work during this session: the \r\n A/66/PV.11\r\n \r\n5 11-50692 \r\n \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes, United Nations reform \r\nand revitalization, improving disaster prevention and \r\nresponse, and sustainable development and global \r\nprosperity.  \r\n With regard to United Nations reform and \r\nrevitalization, we must continue our efforts throughout \r\nthis session to revitalize the General Assembly to \r\nensure its rightful place as the centre of global \r\ndecision-making. We must make it more efficient and \r\nable to respond quickly to emerging situations of \r\nglobal concern. I am fully committed to strengthening \r\nprevious efforts and to making further progress on \r\nreforming the Security Council, based on the collective \r\nwill of the Member States. \r\n On improving disaster prevention and response, I \r\nam deeply conscious of the tragic food and \r\nhumanitarian crisis gripping Somalia. At this session I \r\nwill be fully committed to focusing the Assembly’s \r\nattention on that humanitarian crisis. I will count on \r\nthe support and attention of Member States in order to \r\nimprove our response to humanitarian disasters. And I \r\nwill work closely with Member States to further \r\nimprove prevention capacity and reduce risk and \r\nincrease invulnerability with respect to natural hazards. \r\n In working towards sustainable development and \r\nglobal prosperity as the world population approaches \r\n7 billion next month, our efforts will become ever more \r\npressing. This year, a number of major global \r\nconferences related to sustainable development will \r\ntake place. They will focus on issues such as climate \r\nchange and desertification, poverty eradication, and \r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals. I urge \r\nthe leaders of the world to find consensus and to take \r\nstrong and urgent action to ensure fruitful outcomes to \r\nthese important meetings. I remain committed to \r\nsupporting those discussions in any way that I can.  \r\n The theme before us today is “The role of \r\nmediation in the settlement of disputes”. The United \r\nNations role in promoting international peace and \r\nsecurity is foremost among its founding principles. \r\nFrom the very beginning, mediation has been a key \r\ntool for the peaceful settlement of disputes, with a \r\nspecific reference to it in the United Nations Charter. \r\n In today’s world, the need to find peaceful means \r\nto resolve disputes has assumed greater relevancy and \r\nbecome more urgent than ever, and that is why I \r\nproposed this theme for the general debate. I look \r\nforward to hearing of the valuable views and \r\nexperiences of the Member States. Such views and \r\nexperiences will be useful in the deliberations of the \r\nGeneral Assembly in the coming year. \r\n I am also pleased that this issue is being dealt \r\nwith by the Security Council, which tomorrow will \r\nhold a special meeting on preventive diplomacy. It is \r\nclear that the United Nations provides legitimacy and \r\noperational breadth and dimensions to mediation \r\nefforts.  \r\n I am pleased to note that in the preceding session, \r\nthe Assembly adopted its first-ever resolution on \r\nmediation (resolution 65/283). With that resolution the \r\nAssembly took an important step in affirming support \r\nfor strengthening mediation as a vital tool for conflict \r\nprevention and resolution. Member States also \r\ncommitted to strengthening the visibility of that matter. \r\n It is of the utmost importance that Member States \r\nengage actively in the implementation of that \r\nresolution and in future activities of the General \r\nAssembly in the field of mediation. I also welcome and \r\nappreciate the recent developments in that context \r\nwithin the United Nations system. \r\n It is my intention to accord high priority to \r\nmediation throughout this session, to galvanize that \r\ntheme and operationalize it for a genuine multilateral \r\ncapacity, with the support of Member States. I will do \r\nso in a transparent and interactive manner, by ensuring \r\nclose coordination with the Secretary-General, Member \r\nStates and other relevant actors. \r\n It is significant that the world’s leaders are \r\ngathered here today on the International Day of Peace, \r\nwhich is dedicated to achieving the ideals of peace \r\nwithin and among all nations and peoples. Let us join \r\ntogether, in the spirit of cooperation and partnership, to \r\nensure peace, prosperity and dignity for all of \r\nhumankind. I look forward to very successful debate \r\nand deliberations. \r\n Before giving the floor to the first speaker for this \r\nmorning, I would like to remind Member States that \r\nthe list of speakers for the general debate has been \r\nestablished on the agreed basis that statements should \r\nbe no longer than 15 minutes, so as to enable all \r\nspeakers to be heard at any given meeting. Within this \r\ntime frame, I would like to appeal to speakers to \r\ndeliver their statements at a normal speed so that \r\ninterpretation into the six official United Nations \r\nlanguages may be properly provided. \r\nA/66/PV.11  \r\n \r\n11-50692 6 \r\n \r\n I would also like to draw members’ attention to \r\nthe decision taken by the General Assembly at previous \r\nsessions, namely, that the practice of expressing \r\ncongratulations inside the Hall after a speech has been \r\ndelivered is strongly discouraged. In that connection, \r\nafter delivering their statements, speakers are invited to \r\nexit the Hall through Room GA-200, located behind \r\nthe podium, before returning to their seats. \r\n May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to \r\nproceed in the manner I have described, during the \r\ngeneral debate of the sixty-sixth session? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): Finally, I \r\nshould like to draw the attention of members to the fact \r\nthat during the general debate, official photographs of \r\nall the speakers are taken by the Department of Public \r\nInformation. Members interested in obtaining photographs \r\nare requested to contact the Photo Library of the United \r\nNations. \r\n \r\nAddress by Ms. Dilma Rousseff, President of the \r\nFederative Republic of Brazil \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the \r\nFederative Republic of Brazil. \r\n Ms. Dilma Rousseff, President of the Federative \r\nRepublic of Brazil, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations Her Excellency Ms. Dilma \r\nRousseff, President of the Federative Republic of \r\nBrazil, and to invite her to address the Assembly. \r\n President Rousseff (spoke in Portuguese; \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): For the very \r\nfirst time in the history of the United Nations, a female \r\nvoice is opening the general debate. It is the voice of \r\ndemocracy and equality that reverberates from a forum \r\nthat is committed to being the most representative in \r\nthe world. It is with a sense of personal humility, but \r\nwith justifiable pride as a woman, that I greet this \r\nhistoric moment.  \r\n I share this emotion with more than half of the \r\nhuman beings on this planet, who, like me, were born \r\nwomen and who, with a sense of purposeful \r\ndetermination, are now taking the place in the world \r\nthey rightly deserve. I am certain that this will be the \r\ncentury of women. In the Portuguese language, words \r\nsuch as life, soul and hope are feminine nouns. Two \r\nother words in Portuguese that are especially dear to \r\nme are also feminine, namely, courage and sincerity. \r\nAnd it is in a spirit of courage and sincerity that I wish \r\nto address the General Assembly today.  \r\n The world is experiencing an extremely delicate \r\nperiod, one that at the same time offers us a major \r\nhistoric opportunity. We face an economic crisis that, if \r\nnot overcome, could become a source of serious \r\npolitical and social disruption, an unprecedented \r\nupheaval capable of causing serious imbalances in \r\nrelationships between people and nations. More than \r\never before, the fate of the world is in the hands of its \r\nrulers and leaders, with no exceptions. Either we \r\ncombine our efforts and emerge victorious together, or \r\nwe will all emerge defeated. It is now less important to \r\nknow or decide who caused the situation we are \r\nfacing — because, after all, that is clear enough by \r\nnow. What does matter is that we start finding \r\ncollective, speedy and genuine solutions. \r\n The current crisis is too serious to be managed by \r\na few countries. Their Governments and central banks \r\nstill have the greatest responsibility in implementing \r\nthe process. Yet, since all countries suffer the \r\nconsequences, all are entitled to participate in their \r\nsolutions. It is not because of a lack of financial \r\nresources that the leaders of developed countries have \r\nnot yet found a solution to the crisis. Rather, if I may \r\nput it this way, it is due to a lack of political resources \r\nand, at times, of clear ideas. There is a part of the \r\nworld that has not yet found a balance between \r\nappropriate fiscal adjustments and correct and precise \r\nfiscal stimuli conducive to demand and growth. They \r\nhave been caught in a trap that does not distinguish \r\nbetween partisan interests and the legitimate interests \r\nof society. The challenge posed by the crisis entails \r\nreplacing outdated theories that belong to an old world \r\nwith new proposals crafted for a new world. \r\n While many Governments are shrinking, \r\nunemployment, the bitterest face of the crisis, is \r\ngrowing. There are already 205 million unemployed \r\npeople in the world, of whom 44 million are in Europe \r\nand 14 million in the United States. Tackling this \r\nscourge and preventing it from spreading to other \r\nregions of the planet is vitally important. We women \r\nknow better than anyone that unemployment is not just \r\na statistic; it affects our families, children and \r\n A/66/PV.11\r\n \r\n7 11-50692 \r\n \r\nhusbands. It takes away hope and leaves a trail of \r\nviolence and pain. \r\n It is quite telling that it is the President of an \r\nemerging country, a country experiencing almost full \r\nemployment, who has come here today to speak in such \r\nstark terms of a tragedy that has mainly hit developed \r\ncountries. \r\n Like other emerging countries, Brazil has thus far \r\nbeen less affected by the global crisis. But we know \r\nthat our ability to withstand the crisis is not unlimited. \r\nWe are willing and able to help those countries that are \r\nalready facing an acute crisis, while there is still time. \r\nA new kind of cooperation between emerging and \r\ndeveloped countries is an historic opportunity to \r\nredefine, with solidarity and responsibility, the \r\ncommitments that govern international relations. \r\n The world of today faces a crisis that is at once of \r\neconomics, governance and political coordination. \r\nThere will not be a return to confidence and growth \r\nuntil we intensity coordination efforts among United \r\nNations Member States and other multilateral \r\ninstitutions, including the Group of Twenty, the \r\nInternational Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and \r\nother organs.  \r\n The United Nations and those organizations must \r\nact urgently to send clear signals of political cohesion \r\nand macroeconomic coordination. For example, fiscal \r\nand monetary policies should be submitted to mutual \r\nassessment in such a way as to ultimately prevent \r\nundesirable effects on other countries, thus avoiding \r\ndefensive reactions that in turn lead to a vicious circle.  \r\n The solution to the debt problem should be \r\ncombined with economic growth. There are obvious \r\nsigns that several advanced economies are on the \r\nthreshold of recession, which will significantly hamper \r\nresolution of their fiscal problems. \r\n It is clear that the priority for the world economy \r\nat this moment should be to solve the problems of \r\nthose countries that are facing a sovereign debt crisis \r\nand reversing the current recession scenario. The most \r\ndeveloped countries must establish coordinated \r\npolicies to stimulate economies that have been \r\nextremely weakened by the crisis. Countries with \r\nemerging economies can help in that effort. Countries \r\nwith a high surplus should strengthen their domestic \r\nmarkets and, as appropriate, make their foreign \r\nexchange rate policies more flexible in such a way that \r\ncontributes to the eventual rebalancing of global \r\ndemand.  \r\n Deepening the regulation of the financial system \r\nand controlling that inexhaustible source of instability \r\nis a pressing need. Controls must be imposed on the \r\nforeign-exchange war by adopting floating foreign-\r\nexchange regimes. The task at hand is about preventing \r\nthe manipulation of foreign exchange that occurs not \r\nonly through excessively expansionist monetary \r\npolicies but also through an artificially fixed foreign \r\nexchange.  \r\n Without a doubt, the reform of multilateral \r\nfinancial institutions should continue, thus increasing \r\nthe participation of emerging countries, which, as \r\ndriving forces, are responsible for the growth of the \r\nworld’s economy. We should fight protectionism and \r\nall forms of commercial manipulation. They do \r\nincrease competitiveness, but in a spurious, fraudulent \r\nfashion. \r\n Brazil is doing its homework. With sacrifices, but \r\nat the same time with a sense of insightfulness, we \r\nhave kept Government spending under strict control, to \r\nthe point of generating a sizable surplus in Government \r\naccounts while ensuring that those steps will not \r\ncompromise the success of our social policies or the \r\npace of our investment and growth. We are also taking \r\nadditional precautions to buttress our ability to \r\nwithstand the crisis by strengthening our domestic \r\nmarket with income distribution and technological \r\ninnovation policies. \r\n For at least three years now, Brazil has reiterated — \r\ntime and again, from this very podium — that we must \r\nall tackle the causes, and not only the consequences, of \r\nglobal instability. We have emphasized time and again \r\nthe interrelations among development, peace and \r\nsecurity. We have often underscored that development \r\npolicies should be increasingly coupled with the \r\nSecurity Council’s strategies in the pursuit of \r\nsustainable peace.  \r\n That is how we have acted as part of our \r\ncommitments to Haiti and to Guinea-Bissau. As a \r\nleading country in the United Nations Stabilization \r\nMission in Haiti, Brazil has since 2004 undertaken \r\nhumanitarian projects that integrate security and \r\ndevelopment. With deep respect for Haitian \r\nsovereignty, Brazil is proud to assist in the \r\nconsolidation of democracy in that country. \r\nA/66/PV.11  \r\n \r\n11-50692 8 \r\n \r\n We are in a position to provide a solidarity-based \r\ncontribution to brotherly countries in the developing \r\nworld in matters such as food security, agricultural \r\ntechnology, generation of clean and renewable energy \r\nand the fight against hunger and poverty. \r\n Since late 2010, we have witnessed a series of \r\ngrass-roots demonstrations that have come to be known \r\nas the Arab Spring. Brazil is the adopted homeland of \r\nmany immigrants from that part of the world. \r\nBrazilians sympathize with the pursuit of an ideal that \r\nbelongs to no culture in particular, because it is by \r\ndefinition universal: freedom. \r\n The nations united here today must find a \r\nlegitimate and effective way to aid those societies that \r\ncry out for reform — without, however, depriving their \r\ncitizens of a lead role in the process. We strongly \r\nrepudiate the brutal crack down episodes that victimize \r\ncivilian populations. We remain convinced that for the \r\ninternational community, resort to force must always \r\nbe the last alternative.  \r\n The quest for peace and security in the world \r\ncannot be limited to interventions in extreme situations \r\nonly. We support the Secretary-General in his efforts to \r\nengage the United Nations in conflict prevention by \r\ntirelessly exercising diplomacy and promoting \r\ndevelopment. The world of today suffers from the \r\npainful consequences of interventions that have \r\nworsened existing conflicts. That has allowed terrorism \r\nto creep into areas where it previously did not exist, \r\nthus generating new cycles of violence and multiplying \r\nthe number of civilian victims. \r\n Much is said about the responsibility to protect, \r\nyet little is said about responsibility while protecting. \r\nThese are concepts that we must develop and mature \r\ntogether. To that end, the role of the Security Council is \r\ncritical, and the more legitimate its decisions are, the \r\nmore appropriate that role will be. And the Council’s \r\nvery legitimacy increasingly depends upon its reform.  \r\n With each passing year, a solution to the lack of \r\nrepresentativeness in the Security Council becomes an \r\never more urgent need, which in turn erodes its \r\nefficacy. Former Assembly President Joseph Deiss \r\nreminded me of an impressive fact, namely, that the \r\ndebate on the proposed reform of the Security Council \r\nis now entering its eighteenth year.  \r\n We can delay no longer. The world needs a \r\nSecurity Council that reflects contemporary realities, a \r\nCouncil that will incorporate new permanent and \r\nnon-permanent members, especially those representing \r\ndeveloping countries. \r\n Brazil is ready to take on its responsibilities as a \r\npermanent member of the Council. We have lived in \r\npeace with our neighbours for more than 140 years and \r\nhave fostered successful integration and cooperation \r\nprocesses with them. Our Constitution expressly states \r\nour commitment to abstain from the use of nuclear \r\nenergy for non-peaceful purposes. I am proud to say \r\nthat Brazil is a driver of peace, stability and prosperity \r\nin the region and even beyond it. \r\n In the Human Rights Council, we have drawn \r\ninspiration from our own history of endeavour as a \r\nnation. We desire for other countries what we desire for \r\nourselves. Authoritarianism, xenophobia, poverty, \r\ncapital punishment and discrimination are all sources \r\nof human rights violations. We know that violations \r\noccur in every country, without exception. We must \r\nrecognize this reality, and we must accept criticism. We \r\nwill ultimately benefit from criticism, and we should \r\npointedly criticize flagrant violations wherever they \r\noccur. \r\n I welcome South Sudan to our family of nations. \r\nBrazil is ready to cooperate with the youngest Member \r\nof the United Nations and to contribute to its sovereign \r\ndevelopment.  \r\n I regret, however, that from this podium I am still \r\nunable to welcome Palestine into full membership of \r\nthe Organization. Brazil has recognized the Palestinian \r\nState as defined by the 1967 borders, in accordance \r\nwith United Nations resolutions. Like most countries in \r\nthe Assembly, we believe that the time has come for \r\nPalestine to be represented as a full Member in this \r\nforum. \r\n The recognition of the Palestinian people’s \r\nlegitimate right to sovereignty and self-rule expands \r\nthe possibilities and prospects for a lasting peace in the \r\nMiddle East. Only a free and sovereign Palestine can \r\nrespond to Israel’s legitimate desire for peace with its \r\nneighbours, security within its borders and political \r\nstability in its region. I come from a country where \r\ndescendents of Arabs and Jews are compatriots and live \r\ntogether in harmony, which is as it should be. \r\n Brazil advocates for a global, comprehensive and \r\nambitious agreement within the framework of the \r\nUnited Nations to fight climate change. To achieve \r\n A/66/PV.11\r\n \r\n9 11-50692 \r\n \r\nthis, countries must shoulder their respective \r\nresponsibilities. Brazil submitted a concrete, voluntary \r\nand significant proposal for reducing greenhouse gas \r\nemissions during the 2009 United Nations Climate \r\nChange Conference in Copenhagen. We hope to be able \r\nto make progress at the upcoming meeting in Durban \r\nby supporting developing countries in their efforts to \r\nreduce emissions, and at the same time ensuring that \r\ndeveloped countries fulfil their obligations, beyond \r\n2012, on the basis of new targets under the Kyoto \r\nProtocol.  \r\n Brazil will have the honour of hosting the United \r\nNations Conference on Sustainable Development — \r\nRio+20 — in June of 2012. Along with Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon, I reiterate our invitation to all \r\nheads of State and Government to join us at that \r\nConference next year. \r\n Brazil has learned that fighting poverty is the best \r\ndevelopment policy, and that a genuine human rights \r\npolicy must ultimately be based on reducing \r\ninequalities and discrimination between and among \r\nregions, people and genders. Brazil has made political, \r\neconomic and social progress without compromising \r\nany of its democratic freedoms. We have met almost all \r\nof the Millennium Development Goals before 2015. \r\nForty million Brazilian men and women have come up \r\nout of poverty and been lifted into the middle class. I \r\nam fully confident that we will achieve our goal of \r\neradicating extreme poverty in Brazil by the end of my \r\nterm in office. \r\n In my country, women have been vital to the task \r\nof overcoming social inequalities. Our income \r\ndistribution programmes place mothers as the central \r\nfigures in the scheme. It is they who manage the \r\nresources that allow families to invest in the health and \r\neducation of their children. Yet my country, like every \r\nother nation, still has to do much more when it comes \r\nto valuing women and asserting their status. In that \r\nregard, I would like to congratulate the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for making women a priority during his tenure \r\nat the head of the United Nations. I particularly \r\nwelcome the creation of UN-Women and the \r\nappointment of its Executive Director, Ms. Michelle \r\nBachelet. \r\n Besides speaking on behalf of my own beloved \r\ncountry, I feel that when I stand up here I am \r\nrepresenting all the women of the world — the \r\nanonymous women, those who starve and cannot feed \r\ntheir children, those who are suffering from illnesses \r\nand cannot get treatment, those who are victims of \r\nviolence or who are discriminated against at work, in \r\nsociety and in their family life, and those who labour at \r\nhome to bring up future generations. I add my voice to \r\nthose of the women who have dared to struggle, to take \r\npart in political and professional life, and who have \r\nthus gained the spheres of power that allow me to stand \r\nhere today. \r\n As a woman who was the victim of torture while \r\nin prison, I am all too aware of how important values \r\nsuch as democracy, justice, human rights and freedom \r\nare to all of us. It is my hope that these values will \r\ncontinue to inspire the work of this house of nations, \r\nwhere I am honoured to open the general debate of the \r\nsixty-sixth session of the General Assembly. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of \r\nthe Federative Republic of Brazil for the statement she \r\nhas just made. \r\n Ms. Dilma Rousseff, President of the Federative \r\nRepublic of Brazil, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Barack Obama, President of the \r\nUnited States of America \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the United \r\nStates of America. \r\n Mr. Barack Obama, President of the United States \r\nof America, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Barack Obama, President \r\nof the United States of America, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly. \r\n President Obama: It is a great honour for me to \r\nbe here today. I would like to talk to the General \r\nAssembly about a subject that is at the heart of the \r\nUnited Nations — the pursuit of peace in an imperfect \r\nworld. \r\n War and conflict have been with us since the \r\nbeginning of civilization. But in the first part of the \r\ntwentieth century, the advance of modern weaponry led \r\nto death on a staggering scale. It was that killing that \r\nA/66/PV.11  \r\n \r\n11-50692 10 \r\n \r\ncompelled the founders of this body to build an \r\ninstitution that was focused not just on ending one war, \r\nbut on averting others; a union of sovereign States that \r\nwould seek to prevent conflict while also addressing its \r\ncauses. \r\n No American did more to pursue that objective \r\nthan President Franklin Roosevelt. He knew that a \r\nvictory in war was not enough. As he said at one of the \r\nvery first meetings on the founding of the United \r\nNations, “We have got to make not merely peace, but a \r\npeace that will last”. \r\n The men and women who built this institution \r\nunderstood that peace is more than the absence of war. \r\nA lasting peace — for nations and individuals — \r\ndepends upon a sense of justice and opportunity; of \r\ndignity and freedom. It depends upon struggle and \r\nsacrifice; on compromise and on a sense of common \r\nhumanity. \r\n One delegate to the San Francisco Conference, \r\nwhich led to the creation of the United Nations, put it \r\nwell: \r\n “Many people have talked as if all we had to do \r\nto get peace was to say loudly and frequently that \r\nwe loved peace and hated war. Now we have \r\nlearned that no matter how much we love peace \r\nand hate war, we cannot avoid having war \r\nbrought upon us if there are convulsions in other \r\nparts of the world”. \r\n The fact is, peace is hard, but our people demand \r\nit. Over nearly seven decades, even as the United \r\nNations helped avert a third world war, we still live in \r\na world scarred by conflict and plagued by poverty. \r\nEven as we proclaim our love for peace and hatred of \r\nwar, there are still convulsions in our world that \r\nendanger us all. \r\n I took office at a time of two wars for the United \r\nStates. Moreover, the violent extremists who drew us \r\ninto war in the first place — Osama bin Laden and his \r\nAl-Qaida organization — remained at large. Today, we \r\nhave set a new direction. \r\n At the end of this year, America’s military \r\noperation in Iraq will be over. We will have a normal \r\nrelationship with a sovereign nation that is a member \r\nof the community of nations. That equal partnership \r\nwill be strengthened by our support for Iraq — for its \r\nGovernment and its security forces, for its people and \r\ntheir aspirations. \r\n As we end the war in Iraq, the United States and \r\nour coalition partners have begun a transition in \r\nAfghanistan. Between now and 2014, an increasingly \r\ncapable Afghan Government and security forces will \r\nstep forward to take responsibility for the future of \r\ntheir country. As they do, we are drawing down our \r\nown forces, while building an enduring partnership \r\nwith the Afghan people. \r\n So let there be no doubt: the tide of war is \r\nreceding. When I took office, roughly 180,000 Americans \r\nwere serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. By the end of \r\nthis year, that number will be cut in half, and it will \r\ncontinue to decline. This is critical for the sovereignty \r\nof Iraq and Afghanistan, and to the strength of the \r\nUnited States as we build our nation at home. \r\n Moreover, we are poised to end these wars from a \r\nposition of strength. Ten years ago, there was an open \r\nwound and twisted steel; a broken heart in the centre of \r\nthis city. Today, as a new tower is rising at Ground \r\nZero, it symbolizes New York’s renewal, even as \r\nAl-Qaida is under more pressure than ever before. Its \r\nleadership has been degraded. Osama bin Laden, a man \r\nwho murdered thousands of people from dozens of \r\ncountries, will never endanger the peace of the world \r\nagain. \r\n Yes, this has been a difficult decade. But today \r\nwe stand at a crossroads of history, with the chance to \r\nmove decisively in the direction of peace. To do so we \r\nmust return to the wisdom of those who created this \r\ninstitution.  \r\n The founding Charter of United Nations calls \r\nupon us, to unite our strength to maintain international \r\npeace and security. Article 1 of the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights reminds us that, “All \r\nhuman beings are born free and equal in dignity and in \r\nrights”. Those bedrock beliefs — in the responsibility \r\nof States and the rights of men and women — must be \r\nour guide. \r\n In that effort, we have reason to hope. This year \r\nhas been a time of extraordinary transformation. More \r\nnations have stepped forward to maintain international \r\npeace and security. More individuals are claiming their \r\nuniversal right to live in freedom and dignity. \r\n Think about it. One year ago, when we met here \r\nin New York, the prospect of a successful referendum \r\nin South Sudan was in doubt. But the international \r\ncommunity overcame old divisions to support the \r\n A/66/PV.11\r\n \r\n11 11-50692 \r\n \r\nagreement that had been negotiated to give South \r\nSudan self-determination. Last summer, as a new flag \r\nwent up in Juba, former soldiers laid down their arms, \r\nmen and women wept with joy and children finally \r\nknew the promise of looking to a future that they will \r\nshape. \r\n One year ago, the people of Côte d’Ivoire \r\napproached a landmark election. When the incumbent \r\nlost and refused to respect the results, the world \r\nrefused to look the other way. United Nations \r\npeacekeepers were harassed, but they did not leave \r\ntheir posts. The Security Council, led by the United \r\nStates, Nigeria and France, came together to support \r\nthe will of the people. Côte d’Ivoire is now governed \r\nby the man who was elected to lead. \r\n One year ago, the hopes of the people of Tunisia \r\nwere suppressed. But they chose the dignity of \r\npeaceful protest over the rule of an iron fist. A vendor \r\nlit a spark that took his own life, but ignited a \r\nmovement. In the face of a crackdown, students spelled \r\nout the word freedom. The balance of fear shifted from \r\nthe ruler to those whom he ruled. Now the people of \r\nTunisia are preparing for elections that will move them \r\none step closer to the democracy that they deserve. \r\n One year ago, Egypt had known one President for \r\nnearly 30 years. But for 18 days, the eyes of the world \r\nwere glued to Tahrir Square, where Egyptians from all \r\nwalks of life — men and women, young and old, \r\nMuslim and Christian — demanded their universal \r\nrights. We saw in those protesters the moral force of \r\nnon-violence that has lit the world from Delhi to \r\nWarsaw, from Selma to South Africa — and we knew \r\nthat change had come to Egypt and to the Arab world. \r\n One year ago, the people of Libya were ruled by \r\nthe world’s longest-serving dictator. But faced with \r\nbullets and bombs and a dictator who threatened to \r\nhunt them down like rats, they showed relentless \r\nbravery. We will never forget the words of the Libyan \r\nwho stood up in those early days of the revolution and \r\nsaid, “Our words are free now”. It is a feeling one \r\ncannot explain. Day after day, in the face of bullets and \r\nbombs, the Libyan people refused to give back that \r\nfreedom. And when they were threatened by the kind \r\nof mass atrocity that often went unchallenged in the \r\npast century, the United Nations lived up to its Charter. \r\nThe Security Council authorized all necessary \r\nmeasures to prevent a massacre. The Arab League \r\ncalled for that effort. Arab nations joined a NATO-led \r\ncoalition that halted Al-Qadhafi’s forces in their tracks. \r\n In the months that followed, the will of the \r\ncoalition proved unbreakable, and the will of the \r\nLibyan people could not be denied. Forty-two years of \r\ntyranny were ended in six months. From Tripoli to \r\nMisurata to Benghazi — today, Libya is free. \r\nYesterday, the leaders of a new Libya took their \r\nrightful place beside us, and this week the United \r\nStates is reopening our embassy in Tripoli. \r\n This is how the international community is \r\nsupposed to work — nations standing together for the \r\nsake of peace and security, and individuals claiming \r\ntheir rights. Now, all of us have a responsibility to \r\nsupport the new Libya and the new Libyan \r\nGovernment as they confront the challenge of turning \r\nthis moment of promise into a just and lasting peace \r\nfor all Libyans. \r\n So this has been a remarkable year. The \r\nAl-Qadhafi regime is over. Gbagbo, Ben Ali and \r\nMubarak are no longer in power. Osama bin Laden is \r\ngone, and the idea that change could come only \r\nthrough violence has been buried with him. Something \r\nis happening in our world. The way things have been is \r\nnot the way that they will be. The humiliating grip of \r\ncorruption and tyranny is being pried open. Dictators \r\nare on notice. Technology is putting power into the \r\nhands of the people. Youth are delivering a powerful \r\nrebuke to dictatorship and rejecting the lie that some \r\nraces, some peoples, some religions and some \r\nethnicities do not desire democracy. The promise \r\nwritten down on paper — “all human beings are born \r\nfree and equal in dignity and rights” — is closer at \r\nhand. \r\n But let us remember: Peace is hard. Peace is hard. \r\nProgress can be reversed. Prosperity comes slowly. \r\nSocieties can split apart. The measure of our success \r\nmust be whether people can live in sustained freedom, \r\ndignity and security. And the United Nations and its \r\nMember States must do their part to support those \r\nbasic aspirations. And we have more work to do. \r\n In Iran, we have seen a Government that refuses \r\nto recognize the rights of its own people. As we meet \r\nhere today, men, women and children are being \r\ntortured, detained and murdered by the Syrian regime. \r\nThousands have been killed, many during the holy time \r\nof Ramadan. Thousands more have poured across \r\nSyria’s borders. The Syrian people have shown dignity \r\nA/66/PV.11  \r\n \r\n11-50692 12 \r\n \r\nand courage in their pursuit of justice, protesting \r\npeacefully, standing silently in the streets and dying for \r\nthe same values that this institution is supposed to \r\nstand for. And the question for us is clear: Will we \r\nstand with the Syrian people or with their oppressors? \r\n Already, the United States has imposed strong \r\nsanctions on Syria’s leaders. We supported a transfer of \r\npower that would be responsive to the Syrian people. \r\nAnd many of our allies have joined in this effort. But \r\nfor the sake of Syria — and the peace and security of \r\nthe world — we must speak with one voice. There is \r\nno excuse for inaction. Now is the time for the Security \r\nCouncil to sanction the Syrian regime and to stand with \r\nthe Syrian people. \r\n Throughout the region, we will have to respond \r\nto the calls for change. In Yemen, men, women and \r\nchildren gather by the thousands in towns and city \r\nsquares every day with the hope that their \r\ndetermination and spilled blood will prevail over a \r\ncorrupt system. America supports those aspirations. We \r\nmust work with Yemen’s neighbours and our partners \r\naround the world to seek a path that allows for a \r\npeaceful transition of power from President Saleh, and \r\na movement to free and fair elections as soon as \r\npossible. \r\n In Bahrain, steps have been taken towards reform \r\nand accountability. We are pleased with that, but more \r\nis required. America is a close friend of Bahrain, and \r\nwe will continue to call on the Government and the \r\nmain opposition bloc — al-Wifaq — to pursue a \r\nmeaningful dialogue that brings peaceful change that is \r\nresponsive to the people. We believe the patriotism that \r\nbinds Bahrainis together must be more powerful than \r\nthe sectarian forces that would tear them apart. It will \r\nbe hard, but it is possible. \r\n We believe that each nation must chart its own \r\ncourse to fulfil the aspirations of its people. America \r\ndoes not expect to agree with every party or person \r\nwho expresses themselves politically, but we will \r\nalways stand up for the universal rights that were \r\nembraced by this Assembly. Those rights depend on \r\nelections that are free and fair, governance that is \r\ntransparent and accountable, respect for the rights of \r\nwomen and minorities, and justice that is equal and \r\nfair. That is what our people deserve. Those are the \r\nelements of peace that can last. \r\n Moreover, the United States will continue to \r\nsupport, with greater trade and investment, those \r\nnations that transition to democracy, so that freedom is \r\nfollowed by opportunity. We will pursue deeper \r\nengagement with Governments, but also with civil \r\nsociety — students and entrepreneurs, political parties \r\nand the press. We have banned those who abuse human \r\nrights from travelling to our country and we have \r\nsanctioned those who trample on human rights abroad. \r\nAnd we will always serve as a voice for those who \r\nhave been silenced. \r\n Now, I know, particularly this week, that for \r\nmany in this Hall, there is one issue that stands as a test \r\nof these principles and a test of American foreign \r\npolicy, and that is the conflict between the Israelis and \r\nthe Palestinians. \r\n One year ago, I stood at this podium and I called \r\nfor an independent Palestine. I believed then, and I \r\nbelieve now, that the Palestinian people deserve a State \r\nof their own, but what I also said is that a genuine \r\npeace can be realized only between the Israelis and the \r\nPalestinians themselves. One year later, despite \r\nextensive efforts by America and others, the parties \r\nhave not bridged their differences. Faced with this \r\nstalemate, I put forward a new basis for negotiations in \r\nMay of this year. That basis is clear. It is well known to \r\nall of us here. Israelis must know that any agreement \r\nprovides assurances for their security. Palestinians \r\ndeserve to know the territorial basis of their State. \r\n I know that many are frustrated by the lack of \r\nprogress; I assure them that I am too. But the question \r\nis not the goal that we seek. The question is: How do \r\nwe reach that goal? And I am convinced that there is no \r\nshortcut to the end of a conflict that has endured for \r\ndecades. Peace is hard work. Peace will not come \r\nthrough statements and resolutions at the United \r\nNations. If it were that easy, it would have been \r\naccomplished by now. Ultimately, it is the Israelis and \r\nthe Palestinians who must live side by side. Ultimately, \r\nit is the Israelis and the Palestinians — not us — who \r\nmust reach agreement on the issues that divide them: \r\non borders and on security, on refugees and on \r\nJerusalem. \r\n Ultimately, peace depends upon compromise \r\namong people who must live together long after our \r\nspeeches are over, long after our votes have been \r\ntallied. That is the lesson of Northern Ireland, where \r\nancient antagonists bridged their differences. That is \r\nthe lesson of the Sudan, where a negotiated settlement \r\nled to an independent State. And that is and will be the \r\n A/66/PV.11\r\n \r\n13 11-50692 \r\n \r\npath to a Palestinian State — negotiations between the \r\nparties. \r\n We seek a future where Palestinians live in a \r\nsovereign State of their own, with no limit to what they \r\ncan achieve. There is no question that the Palestinians \r\nhave seen that vision delayed for too long. It is \r\nprecisely because we believe so strongly in the \r\naspirations of the Palestinian people that America has \r\ninvested so much time and so much effort in the \r\nbuilding of a Palestinian State and in the negotiations \r\nthat can deliver a Palestinian State. \r\n But understand this as well: America’s \r\ncommitment to Israel’s security is unshakeable. Our \r\nfriendship with Israel is deep and enduring. And so we \r\nbelieve that any lasting peace must acknowledge the \r\nvery real security concerns that Israel faces every \r\nsingle day. \r\n Let us be honest with ourselves: Israel is \r\nsurrounded by neighbours that have waged repeated \r\nwars against it. Israel’s citizens have been killed by \r\nrockets fired at their houses and suicide bombs on their \r\nbuses. Israel’s children come of age knowing that \r\nthroughout the region other children are taught to hate \r\nthem. Israel, a small country of less than 8 million \r\npeople, looks out at a world where leaders of much \r\nlarger nations threaten to wipe it off of the map. The \r\nJewish people carry the burden of centuries of exile \r\nand persecution and fresh memories of knowing that \r\n6 million people were killed simply because of who \r\nthey are. Those are facts. They cannot be denied. \r\n The Jewish people have forged a successful State \r\nin their historic homeland. Israel deserves recognition. \r\nIt deserves normal relations with its neighbours. And \r\nfriends of the Palestinians do them no favours by \r\nignoring that truth, just as friends of Israel must \r\nrecognize the need to pursue a two-State solution with \r\na secure Israel next to an independent Palestine. \r\n That is the truth. Each side has legitimate \r\naspirations, and that is part of what makes peace so \r\nhard. And the deadlock will be broken only when each \r\nside learns to stand in the other’s shoes and each side \r\ncan see the world through the other’s eyes. That is \r\nwhat we should be encouraging. That is what we \r\nshould be promoting. \r\n This body — founded as it was out of the ashes \r\nof war and genocide, and dedicated as it is to the \r\ndignity of every single person — must recognize the \r\nreality that is lived by the Palestinians and the Israelis \r\nalike. The measure of our actions must always be \r\nwhether they advance the right of Israeli and \r\nPalestinian children to live lives of peace and security \r\nand dignity and opportunity. And we will succeed in \r\nthat effort only if we can encourage the parties to sit \r\ndown, to listen to each other and to understand each \r\nother’s hopes and each other’s fears. That is the project \r\nto which America is committed. There are no shortcuts. \r\nAnd that is what the United Nations should be focused \r\non in the weeks and months to come. \r\n Even as we confront these challenges of conflict \r\nand revolution, we must also recognize — and we must \r\nalso remind ourselves — that peace is not just the \r\nabsence of war. True peace depends on creating the \r\nopportunity that makes life worth living. And to do \r\nthat, we must confront the common enemies of \r\nhumanity: nuclear weapons and poverty, ignorance and \r\ndisease. Those forces corrode the possibility of lasting \r\npeace and together we are called upon to confront \r\nthem. \r\n To lift the spectre of mass destruction, we must \r\ncome together to pursue the peace and security of a \r\nworld without nuclear weapons. Over the past two \r\nyears, we have begun to walk down that path. Since \r\nour Nuclear Security Summit in Washington, D.C., \r\nnearly 50 nations have taken steps to secure nuclear \r\nmaterials from terrorists and smugglers. Next March, a \r\nsummit in Seoul will advance our efforts to lock down \r\nall of them. The New START Treaty between the \r\nUnited States and Russia will cut our deployed arsenals \r\nto the lowest level in half a century, and our nations are \r\npursuing talks on how to achieve even deeper \r\nreductions. America will continue to work for a ban on \r\nthe testing of nuclear weapons and the production of \r\nfissile material needed to make them. \r\n And so we have begun to move in the right \r\ndirection. And the United States is committed to \r\nmeeting our obligations. But even as we meet our \r\nobligations, we have strengthened the treaties and \r\ninstitutions that help stop the spread of those weapons. \r\nAnd to do so, we must continue to hold accountable \r\nthose nations that flout them. \r\n The Iranian Government cannot demonstrate that \r\nits programme is peaceful. It has not met its obligations \r\nand it rejects offers that would provide it with peaceful \r\nnuclear power. North Korea has yet to take concrete \r\nsteps towards abandoning its weapons and continues \r\nA/66/PV.11  \r\n \r\n11-50692 14 \r\n \r\nbelligerent action against the South. There is a future \r\nof greater opportunity for the people of those nations if \r\ntheir Governments meet their international obligations. \r\nBut if they continue down a path that is outside \r\ninternational law, they must be met with greater \r\npressure and isolation. That is what our commitment to \r\npeace and security demands. \r\n To bring prosperity to our people, we must \r\npromote the growth that creates opportunity. In this \r\neffort, let us not forget that we have made enormous \r\nprogress over the past several decades. Closed societies \r\ngave way to open markets. Innovation and \r\nentrepreneurship have transformed the way we live and \r\nthe things that we do. Emerging economies from Asia \r\nto the Americas have lifted hundreds of millions of \r\npeople from poverty. It is an extraordinary \r\nachievement.  \r\n And yet, three years ago, we were confronted \r\nwith the worst financial crisis in eight decades. And \r\nthat crisis proved a fact that has become clearer with \r\neach passing year. Our fates are interconnected. In a \r\nglobal economy, nations will rise or fall together. \r\n Today, we confront the challenges that have \r\nfollowed on the heels of that crisis. Around the world \r\nrecovery is still fragile. Markets remain volatile. Too \r\nmany people are out of work. Too many others are \r\nstruggling just to get by. We acted together to avert a \r\ndepression in 2009. We must take urgent and \r\ncoordinated action once more. \r\n Here in the United States, I have announced a \r\nplan to put Americans back to work and jump-start our \r\neconomy, at the same time as I am committed to \r\nsubstantially reducing our deficits over time. \r\n We stand with our European allies as they \r\nreshape their institutions and address their own fiscal \r\nchallenges. For other countries, leaders face a different \r\nchallenge as they shift their economy towards more \r\nself-reliance, boosting domestic demand while slowing \r\ninflation. So we will work with emerging economies \r\nthat have rebounded strongly so that rising standards of \r\nliving create new markets that promote global growth. \r\nThat is what our commitment to prosperity demands. \r\n To combat the poverty that punishes our children, \r\nwe must act on the belief that freedom from want is a \r\nbasic human right. The United States has made it a \r\nfocus of our engagement abroad to help people to feed \r\nthemselves. And today, as drought and conflict have \r\nbrought famine to the Horn of Africa, our conscience \r\ncalls on us to act. Together, we must continue to \r\nprovide assistance and support organizations that can \r\nreach those in need. And together, we must insist on \r\nunrestricted humanitarian access so that we can save \r\nthe lives of thousands of men and women and children. \r\nOur common humanity is at stake. Let us show that the \r\nlife of a child in Somalia is as precious as any other. \r\nThat is what our commitment to our fellow human \r\nbeings demands. \r\n To stop disease that spreads across borders, we \r\nmust strengthen our system of public health. We will \r\ncontinue the fight against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and \r\nmalaria. We will focus on the health of mothers and of \r\nchildren. And we must come together to prevent and \r\ndetect and fight every kind of biological danger — \r\nwhether it is a pandemic like H1N1 or a terrorist threat \r\nor a treatable disease. \r\n This week, America signed an agreement with the \r\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) to affirm our \r\ncommitment to meeting that challenge. And today, I \r\nurge all nations to join us in meeting the WHO goal of \r\nmaking sure all nations have core capacities to address \r\npublic health emergencies in place by 2012. That is \r\nwhat our commitment to the health of our people \r\ndemands. \r\n To preserve our planet, we must not put off action \r\nthat climate change demands. We have to tap the power \r\nof science to save those resources that are scarce. And \r\ntogether, we must continue our work to build on the \r\nprogress made in Copenhagen and Cancún, so that all \r\nthe major economies represented here today follow \r\nthrough on the commitments that were made. Together, \r\nwe must work to transform the energy that powers our \r\neconomies and support others as they move down that \r\npath. That is what our commitment to the next \r\ngeneration demands. \r\n To make sure our societies reach their potential, \r\nwe must allow our citizens to reach theirs. No country \r\ncan afford the corruption that plagues the world like a \r\ncancer. Together, we must harness the power of open \r\nsocieties and open economies. That is why we have \r\npartnered with countries across the globe to launch a \r\nnew partnership on open Government that helps ensure \r\naccountability and helps to empower citizens. No \r\ncountry should deny people their rights to freedom of \r\nspeech and freedom of religion, but also no country \r\nshould deny people their rights because of whom they \r\n A/66/PV.11\r\n \r\n15 11-50692 \r\n \r\nlove, which is why we must stand up for the rights of \r\ngays and lesbians everywhere. \r\n No country can realize its potential if half its \r\npopulation cannot reach theirs. This week, the United \r\nStates signed a new declaration on women’s \r\nparticipation. Next year, we should each announce the \r\nsteps we are taking to break down the economic and \r\npolitical barriers that stand in the way of women and \r\ngirls. That is what our commitment to human progress \r\ndemands. \r\n I know there is no straight line to that progress, \r\nno single path to success. We come from different \r\ncultures, and carry with us different histories. But let \r\nus never forget that even as we gather here as Heads of \r\ndifferent Governments, we represent citizens who share \r\nthe same basic aspirations to live with dignity and \r\nfreedom, to get an education and pursue opportunity, to \r\nlove our families and love and worship our God, to live \r\nin the kind of peace that makes life worth living. \r\n It is the nature of our imperfect world that we are \r\nforced to learn these lessons over and over again. \r\nConflict and repression will endure so long as some \r\npeople refuse to do unto others as we would have them \r\ndo unto us. Yet that is precisely why we have built \r\ninstitutions like this — to bind our fates together, to \r\nhelp us recognize ourselves in each other — because \r\nthose who came before us believed that peace is \r\npreferable to war, and freedom is preferable to \r\nsuppression, and prosperity is preferable to poverty. \r\nThat is the message that comes not from capitals, but \r\nfrom citizens, from our people. \r\n When the cornerstone of this very building was \r\nput in place, President Truman came here to New York \r\nand said, “The United Nations is essentially an \r\nexpression of the moral nature of man’s aspirations” — \r\nthe moral nature of man’s aspirations. As we live in a \r\nworld that is changing at a breathtaking pace, that is a \r\nlesson that we must never forget. \r\n Peace is hard, but we know that it is possible. So, \r\ntogether, let us be resolved to see that it is defined by \r\nour hopes and not by our fears. Together, let us make \r\npeace — but a peace, most importantly, that will last. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the United \r\nStates of America for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Barack Obama, President of the United States \r\nof America, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by His Highness Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa \r\nAl-Thani, Amir of the State of Qatar \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the Amir of the State of \r\nQatar. \r\n His Highness Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa \r\nAl-Thani, Amir of the State of Qatar, was escorted \r\ninto the General Assembly Hall. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations His Highness Sheikh Hamad bin \r\nKhalifa Al-Thani, Amir of the State of Qatar, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly. \r\n Sheikh Al-Thani (spoke in Arabic): It gives me \r\ngreat pleasure to address the General Assembly of the \r\nUnited Nations this year, at a time when its President is \r\na son of the State of Qatar, His Excellency Mr. Nassir \r\nAbdulaziz Al-Nasser. I take this opportunity to \r\ncongratulate him on his election and to wish him every \r\nsuccess in his mission. I would also like to express my \r\nthanks to his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Joseph \r\nDeiss, for his hard work during his presidency of the \r\nprevious session. Let me also congratulate His \r\nExcellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon for the trust that all \r\nMember States expressed in him by reappointing him \r\nas Secretary-General of the United Nations for a \r\nsecond term. \r\n I come to the Assembly from a region brimming \r\nwith great expectations and hopes that is navigating \r\nthrough strong currents, a region whose peoples are \r\ncalling for reform so that they can achieve their goals, \r\nassume their responsibilities and take their place in the \r\npartnership of the future of humankind, with all of its \r\nchallenges and prospects. \r\n We have been aware of our role from the very \r\nbeginning and we have acted within its parameters. We \r\nare for the promotion of dialogue among cultures and \r\ncivilizations. We are for strengthening and consolidating \r\nrelations among peoples. We are for the consolidation \r\nof rapprochement among Powers on the basis of the \r\nprinciples of right and justice and within the \r\nframework of rightful cooperation. That cooperation \r\nmust be governed by the principles, laws and \r\nA/66/PV.11  \r\n \r\n11-50692 16 \r\n \r\ninternational charters and covenants that have been \r\ndeveloped by humankind over the centuries to ensure a \r\nbetter future for the world. \r\n All members of the Assembly are aware that the \r\nblossoming of the Arab Spring — with all that it \r\nrepresents in Arab and human history — has presented \r\neveryone with heavy responsibilities that they have to \r\nassume, as well as positions that they have to take. We \r\nwere among those who made a choice. On the one \r\nhand, we have always had a clear policy with regard to \r\nthe rules that govern our Arab, regional and \r\ninternational relations. Those rules are based on \r\nunderstanding, reconciliation and harmony among \r\npeoples and nations. On the other hand, like others, we \r\nhave been unable to turn a deaf ear or a blind eye to the \r\ncalls of the wounded seeking help from near and far \r\nagainst an entrenched oppression and injustice. \r\n For our part, we exhausted each and every means, \r\nuntil the only option left for us was to hear and \r\nsympathize, and to watch and help. We knew that this \r\nwas not a solution, but rather an emergency situation in \r\nthe context of one of the most critical issues in the \r\nArab world today, by which I mean the issue of \r\nchange. \r\n We know that our principled choices are stable \r\nand strong. We also know that our subsequent response \r\nto the prevailing situation stems from urgency, and that \r\nit is a situation that needs to be settled on the basis of \r\nthe rules and laws that govern international relations in \r\nthe contemporary world. It is a situation that should \r\nshift responsibilities from States acting individually to \r\nan international community acting in accordance with \r\nits rules and laws. \r\n We have already expressed our views here, \r\nduring previous sessions of the Assembly, that the \r\nUnited Nations system needs to evolve in a manner \r\nconsistent with the situations that reflect the realities of \r\na new world. That world is not one linked with \r\ninterests alone, but one where it is imperative to have \r\nan agreement that confirms the principles that govern \r\ncivilized behaviour, while simultaneously preserving \r\nthe unity of those interests. \r\n The major problems in the Middle East region are \r\nthe question of Palestine and the continued Israeli \r\noccupation of Arab territories in the West Bank, the \r\nGolan Heights and the Shaba’a farmlands in southern \r\nLebanon, in addition to the threat of war and the \r\nstrangulating Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip. \r\n For over four decades, all peace efforts that have \r\nbeen deployed have resulted in failures to reach a just \r\nsettlement that would ensure a lasting and \r\ncomprehensive peace in the region. This is because of \r\nIsrael’s intransigent position, which seems to be that its \r\nmilitary might enable it to guarantee peace and \r\nsecurity, and its insistence to play for time and to use \r\nthe negotiations to preserve the status quo by \r\ncontinuing Jewish settlement. \r\n Faced with this stalemate in the Palestinian cause, \r\nthe continued suffering of the Palestinian people under \r\noccupation and persistent violations of their human and \r\nnational rights, we urge all Member States of the \r\nUnited Nations to listen to the voice of right. We urge \r\nthem to respond to the Palestinians’ legitimate request \r\nfor a Palestinian State that will become a full-fledged \r\nmember of the United Nations, on an equal footing \r\nwith all other Member States. This will pave the way \r\nfor the realization of peace in our region.  \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank Sheikh Hamad \r\nbin Khalifa Al-Thani, Amir of the State of Qatar, for \r\nthe statement he has just made. I also wish to thank His \r\nHighness very much for his warm compliments. I hope \r\nthat I will live up to his expectations and be worthy of \r\nhis trust. \r\n Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, Amir of the \r\nState of Qatar, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.  \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Felipe Calderón Hinojosa, President \r\nof the United Mexican States \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): The General \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe United Mexican States. \r\n Mr. Felipe Calderón Hinojosa, President of the \r\nUnited Mexican States, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Felipe Calderón \r\nHinojosa, President of the United Mexican States, and \r\nto invite him to address the Assembly.  \r\n President Calderón Hinojosa (spoke in Spanish): It \r\nis an honour for me to participate in this session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. We have heard extremely \r\nsignificant speeches, which have, deservedly, captured \r\n A/66/PV.11\r\n \r\n17 11-50692 \r\n \r\nthe attention of the Assembly. However, as I speak in \r\nthis lofty forum of the international community, I \r\nwould like to lay out Mexico’s views, a country that, as \r\none of the founding States of the United Nations, has \r\nactively contributed to ensuring that the Organization \r\nonce again plays its role in promoting peace, justice, \r\nsecurity, equity and sustainable development among \r\nnations.  \r\n The world faces major challenges, about which \r\nwe have spoken today. We have talked about terrorism, \r\nwar, peace, climate change and poverty. We know that \r\nwe are afflicted by other problems, such as the global \r\neconomic crisis. I would like to refer to just a few of \r\nthem now, as I am aware that our duty is to strengthen \r\nthe United Nations, to make it less bureaucratic and to \r\nonce again turn this into an Organization that is able to \r\ntackle the pressing challenges of our time. Faced with \r\nthis reality, Mexico is shouldering its international \r\nresponsibilities firmly and with determination. \r\n I would now like to refer to the problem that I \r\nthink today most afflicts the poorest people in the \r\nworld. More than 1 billion people, on every continent, \r\nare living on less than $1.25 a day. This is the problem \r\nof poverty. Over the past five years, the price of food \r\nhas risen by more than 50 per cent. Over the past \r\n12 months, the average increase has been 26 per cent. \r\nThis means that the poorest families, who allocate most \r\nof their income to food, have sunk even deeper into \r\npoverty.  \r\n This is why poverty has increased around the \r\nworld. This is why we once again see famine in the \r\nHorn of Africa, in various nations on that continent, in \r\nAsia and in Latin America. This is why, in addition to \r\nthe democratic awakening of certain nations, we have \r\nseen many people suffering from hunger who have \r\ntaken to the streets. Hunger is what has, in many cases, \r\nawakened their awareness of democracy.  \r\n Why the hike in food prices? That is the first \r\nquestion we must ask ourselves. It is partly because \r\ndeveloping countries have grown rapidly, and that is a \r\ngood thing. China, India and many others have reached \r\ngrowth rates that allow their people to have greater \r\naccess to food. What is left to do is to develop the \r\nnecessary technology to increase our capacity to \r\nproduce food. \r\n Secondly, drought and climate change have been \r\nother contributing factors. We have not truly realized \r\nthat climate change is a serious threat to humankind as \r\na whole. In particular, climate change is behind the \r\ndrought that has restricted food production in recent \r\nyears.  \r\n Thirdly, there is financial speculation and \r\nspeculation on the financial markets. Let me point to \r\none bit of data. In 1987, financial agents and \r\ncompanies bought just 7 per cent of food on the world \r\nmarkets. Today, more than 30 per cent of sales of corn \r\nand wheat in the world are made by financial \r\ncompanies. Why do they want corn and wheat? Is it to \r\ntrade them on various markets or to distribute them to \r\ncertain regions? Of course not. Trade companies and \r\ndistributors buy 70 per cent of wheat and corn, but the \r\nremaining 30 per cent is bought by financial firms with \r\none specific purpose in mind, namely, speculation. We \r\nsee how they buy and sell the rights to food with the \r\nsole intent of driving up market prices, when thousands \r\nof children are dying of hunger across the various \r\ncontinents.  \r\n I am someone who believes in markets, economic \r\nfreedom and enterprise. But I also know that the time \r\nhas come for restrictions to be imposed on unbridled \r\nmarkets, which are also behind world hunger. \r\n The second challenge that I would like to refer to \r\nis drug trafficking and international organized crime. \r\nEveryone is surprised by the dozens, hundreds and \r\neven thousands of deaths caused by repressive \r\nauthoritarian regimes, and of course, we also repudiate \r\nthese. However, we also have to be aware that \r\norganized crime today is killing more people — and \r\nmore young people — than all of the current dictatorial \r\nregimes put together. Today, thousands of people — \r\ntens of thousands of people in Latin America, in \r\nparticular between Mexico and the Andes — are dying \r\nbecause of criminals. I greet with affection and respect \r\nmy colleagues from Central and Latin America who are \r\nhere today. \r\n Today, the world faces the challenge of \r\nunscrupulous criminals who have no respect for \r\nborders and who do grave harm to the citizens of many \r\nnations. The power of crime is stronger than many \r\nGovernments, although assuredly not ours. This stems \r\nfrom two fundamental factors, namely, the exorbitant \r\nprofits that flow from drug trafficking and unlimited \r\naccess to the purchase of powerful weapons.  \r\n With respect to weapons, why do criminals have \r\nunrestricted access to AK-47s, R-15s and grenade \r\nlaunchers? In my view, having fiercely fought \r\nA/66/PV.11  \r\n \r\n11-50692 18 \r\n \r\ncriminals and having seized 120,000 weapons in five \r\nyears, the answer can be summed up in a single word, \r\nprofits — the runaway profits of an arms industry that \r\nsees in every war, whether a civil war in some distant \r\ncountry or a battle among criminals, an opportunity to \r\nsell ever more weapons.  \r\n It is urgent for us to put in place serious controls \r\nin countries that produce and sell high-power \r\nweaponry, so as to prevent them from filling the \r\narsenals of organized crime. The United Nations has its \r\nwork cut out for it in that regard. The United Nations \r\nmust continue to promote the draft international arms \r\ntrade treaty and to prevent weapons from being \r\ndiverted towards activities that are banned by \r\ninternational law. \r\n Moreover, organized crime feeds off the \r\nastronomical profits produced by the illegal sale of \r\ndrugs around the world. Unfortunately, the demand for \r\ndrugs in those markets continues to increase. We must \r\nrecognize that so long as there are drug consumers \r\nprepared to pay tens of billions of dollars to maintain \r\ntheir addictions or preferences, that market will remain \r\nthe primary financial support for criminal activity.  \r\n Mexico is doing its part to energetically fight \r\ncrime in all its manifestations. Today more than ever, \r\nhowever, drug-consuming countries must undertake \r\neffective efforts to radically reduce demand. It may be \r\nargued that this is impossible and that the demand for \r\ndrugs is continuing to rise, as is the case here in the \r\nUnited States, where nearly 30 per cent of young \r\npeople use drugs, and in other parts of the world. \r\n What is the solution? I can honestly say that even \r\nif those countries are unable or unwilling to reduce \r\ntheir demand for drugs, or if they are resigned to the \r\nfact that it will continue to rise, they still have a moral \r\nobligation to reduce the huge profits that drug \r\ntraffickers obtain from that black market. \r\n It would be best to reduce demand, but failing \r\nthat, reduce profits. Drug-consuming nations have the \r\nobligation to find a way to cut that source of endless \r\neconomic gain, and to seek every possible solution, \r\nincluding alternative markets that would prevent drug \r\ntrafficking from being the source of violence and \r\ndeath, especially in Latin America and the Caribbean \r\nand various African countries. \r\n The third challenge to which I would like to refer \r\nis climate change. Along with Mexico, my Central \r\nAmerican and Caribbean colleagues are experiencing \r\never more violent hurricanes that destroy the homes of \r\nthe poor and cut short many lives. Ironically, just a few \r\nweeks ago, one of those tropical hurricanes that was \r\nheaded for our Caribbean coast landed instead on the \r\nstreets of Manhattan. There are still some who are \r\nsurprised that there are hurricanes in New York, \r\nunprecedented droughts in Texas and never before seen \r\nfloods in Pakistan or Mexico or Colombia or \r\nGuatemala. Even with all this, they still do not accept \r\nthe fact of global warming.  \r\n I can proudly state that we have made progress \r\nand that Mexico has done its part in moving towards a \r\nsolution to this problem. We organized the sixteenth \r\nConference of the Parties to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change, in Cancún, \r\nwhere important agreements were reached. For \r\nexample, for the first time, nations agreed within the \r\nframework of a binding United Nations instrument to \r\nestablish a global limit on the rise in temperature of \r\nour planet — of no more than 2° centigrade by the end \r\nof this century.  \r\n We also agreed to establish the Green Fund, to \r\nsupport developing countries in their mitigation and \r\nadaptation efforts.  \r\n In addition, we created a mechanism for \r\ntechnology transfer that incorporates methods for \r\nreducing emissions caused by deforestation and soil \r\ndegradation, which will allow the poorest countries to \r\ncontribute to reducing global warming by preserving \r\ntheir forests and jungles. In Mexico, more than \r\n12 million people in indigenous communities, who \r\nmake their living from jungles and forests and who \r\nhave had no choice but to destroy them, today use their \r\nwoodlands in a sustainable way and are paid by the rest \r\nof society for the environmental service that their trees \r\nprovide. \r\n With the approach of the seventeenth Conference \r\nof the Parties, in Durban, we fear that without \r\nsufficient political leadership and commitment to its \r\nown Convention by the United Nations, we may lose \r\npart of what we have achieved in the battle against \r\nclimate change. We must advance within the Kyoto \r\nProtocol, keeping in mind that the provisions of annex 1 \r\nexpire next year. What will happen with our \r\nenvironmental obligations in the light of the failure of \r\nthe most relevant nations to take action? \r\n A/66/PV.11\r\n \r\n19 11-50692 \r\n \r\n The best way to fight climate change is to break \r\nwith the false argument that we must choose between \r\neconomic growth and combating climate change. They \r\nare in fact perfectly compatible. Through actions that \r\nbuild sustainable development, we can simultaneously \r\nreduce poverty and climate change. \r\n Finally, another challenge is the social basis for \r\nreducing poverty and marginalization. In Mexico we \r\nestablished a programme for transferring money to the \r\npoorest of our population, with incentives for mothers \r\nwho take their children to school or health clinics. The \r\nprogramme offers an average of $80 monthly to the \r\nbottom fourth of Mexico’s poorest families, benefiting \r\nmore than 30 million people and reducing extreme \r\npoverty in our country by nearly 50 per cent between \r\n1995 and 2010.  \r\n Recently, we have focused on guaranteeing the \r\nhealth of all Mexicans. In five years, we have added \r\n2,000 new hospitals and clinics, reconstructed \r\n2,000 more and introduced a national health policy that \r\nalready covers more than 100,000 people. This allows \r\nMexico to proudly state today in the United Nations \r\nthat this year we will achieve universal health \r\ninsurance, covering doctors, medicines, treatment and \r\nhospitalization for any Mexican who needs them. That \r\nachievement, of which we are proud, confirms the fact \r\nthat Mexico has already achieved almost all the \r\nMillennium Development Goals to which it committed \r\nitself. \r\n Finally, I should now like to discuss a crucial \r\nissue that has to do with the transformation and \r\nmodernization of the United Nations. The conflict in \r\nthe Middle East is a matter that has clearly tested the \r\ncapacity of the Organization. We are particularly \r\nconcerned about the stalemate in negotiations between \r\nIsrael and the Palestinian National Authority. The \r\nUnited Nations bears the responsibility for making a \r\nconstructive contribution to the peaceful resolution of \r\nthis conflict — one that makes possible the existence \r\nof two States, reaffirms the recognition of Israel’s right \r\nto exist and makes the establishment of a Palestinian \r\nState a reality. Of course, we must bear in mind that \r\nthis must be a genuine, viable and negotiated solution \r\nin which legitimate and balanced mediation plays a \r\nfundamental role. Such a solution must also be \r\npolitically and economically viable and enable Israel \r\nand Palestine to truly exist side by side in peace, so \r\nthat new generations of Israelis and Palestinians can \r\ntruly know what it is to live together without hatred or \r\nviolence. \r\n We should also remember that no solution can be \r\nfound while either of the sides, explicitly or implicitly, \r\ndesires the annihilation of the other. In addition, we \r\nmust make progress on compliance with United \r\nNations resolutions in order to put an end to policies \r\nthat we all know are contrary to international law. \r\n It is also vital that we move forward together in \r\ntransforming and modernizing the Organization. It is \r\nan excellent thing that the United Nations building is \r\nbeing renovated; now we need to modernize the \r\nOrganization at its core. It must not fail in its \r\ncommitment to history and humankind. It is time that \r\nall Member States play our parts in ensuring that the \r\nOrganization has the strength and viability that it \r\nneeds, and that it lacks. There have been many \r\noccasions, for instance, when the United Nations has \r\nbeen paralysed by the tyranny of consensus, where a \r\nminority is able to defeat a large majority. Consensus \r\nmust no longer be seen as the veto power of the \r\nobstinate; rather it should be understood as the \r\npossibility of building shared and genuinely legitimate \r\nsolutions that reflect the will of the majority. \r\n Keeping the United Nations relevant also \r\nnecessarily implies the reform of the Security Council, \r\nwhose rules of participation have not been revised in \r\nmore than 40 years. Mexico seeks a total reform that \r\nimproves representation for all Council members while \r\nat the same time preserving the Council’s capacity to \r\ntake action and promoting its members’ accountability. \r\nWe cannot allow the chief supranational body to \r\nbecome a decision-making centre for the few.  \r\n Mexico reaffirms its confidence in the United \r\nNations as a forum that represents the diversity and \r\nplurality of human beings. Mexico also reiterates that it \r\nwill continue to be a strategic ally of the Organization \r\nin the struggle for peace, the war against hunger and \r\nthe struggle for security and the progress of all peoples \r\nof the world. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of \r\nthe United Mexican States for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\n Mr. Felipe Calderón Hinojosa, President of the \r\nUnited Mexican States, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\nA/66/PV.11  \r\n \r\n11-50692 20 \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Nursultan Nazarbayev, President of \r\nthe Republic of Kazakhstan \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the \r\nRepublic of Kazakhstan. \r\n Mr. Nursultan Nazarbayev, President of the \r\nRepublic of Kazakhstan, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Nursultan \r\nNazarbayev, President of the Republic of Kazakhstan, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Nazarbayev (spoke in Russian): I \r\nwould like, on behalf of the Republic of Kazakhstan \r\nand on my own behalf, to congratulate Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon on his re-election to his high and \r\nresponsible office. I should also like to congratulate the \r\nAmbassador of Qatar, Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, \r\non his election to the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-sixth session. The Republic of \r\nKazakhstan also congratulates the newest Member of \r\nthe community of nations, the Republic of South \r\nSudan, on gaining its independence. \r\n This year, our country celebrates the twentieth \r\nanniversary of its independence. During this entire \r\ntime, Kazakhstan has faithfully complied with the \r\nletter and spirit of the United Nations Charter. First, we \r\nclosed the Semipalatinsk nuclear test site, the largest in \r\nthe world, thereby becoming one of the world’s first \r\nnew non-nuclear States. This represents an enormous \r\ncontribution on the part of my country to global peace \r\nand stability. \r\n Secondly, we succeeded in convening the \r\nConference on Interaction and Confidence-Building \r\nMeasures in Asia (CICA), which I proposed 19 years \r\nago in this forum. Today it includes participants from \r\n29 countries, representing nearly half the world’s \r\npopulation. Last year, Kazakhstan became the first \r\ncountry from the Commonwealth of Independent States \r\nto chair the Organization for Security and Cooperation \r\nin Europe (OSCE), injecting new energy into every \r\narea of its work. We also succeeded in holding an \r\nOSCE summit in our capital, Astana, the first in \r\n11 years. The adoption of the Astana Declaration has \r\nhelped to strengthen the OSCE and its efforts to create \r\na cooperative and indivisible security community \r\nacross the Euro-Atlantic and Eurasian regions. \r\nKazakhstan has also called for the establishment of a \r\nsingle platform for cooperative Eurasian security by \r\ncombining the capabilities of the OSCE and CICA over \r\nthe long term. \r\n This year, Kazakhstan assumed an important \r\nduty, the chairmanship of the Organization of Islamic \r\nCooperation (OIC). We have focused our chairmanship’s \r\nefforts on strengthening international and regional \r\nsecurity; continuing dialogue between the Islamic \r\nworld and the West; combating Islamophobia; and \r\nenhancing programmes promoting the non-proliferation \r\nof weapons of mass destruction. The most recent test \r\nfor the OIC was the humanitarian crisis in Somalia. In \r\nthat regard, we succeeded in raising $350 million for \r\nprogrammes designed to deliver food, medical supplies \r\nand economic restoration to Somalia. \r\n Thirdly, 140 ethnic groups and 40 religious \r\ndenominations live in our society in peace and \r\nharmony. Astana regularly hosts congresses of leaders \r\nof world and traditional religions. We have offered to \r\nhold such forums under the auspices of the United \r\nNations, and they have stabilized the region. That \r\nrepresents our contribution to the global dialogue on \r\nconfidence-building in the world. \r\n Fourthly, our country has demonstrated a \r\ncommitment to the Millennium Development Goals. \r\nFollowing the break-up of the Soviet Union, we have \r\nbeen able to move to the forefront in terms of the pace \r\nof reform and economic growth. In the past two \r\ndecades, we have posted a 14-fold increase in per \r\ncapita gross domestic product, from about $700 to \r\nabout $10,000. \r\n Fifthly, Kazakhstan has called for the adoption of \r\na global energy and environment strategy and has put \r\nforward an ambitious “green bridge” environmental \r\ninitiative. We plan to bring these ideas to the United \r\nNations Conference on Sustainable Development, to be \r\nheld in Rio de Janeiro next year. \r\n The world is entering one of the most critical \r\nperiods in its history. Humanity has harnessed powerful \r\nsources of energy but is powerless against the forces of \r\nnature. Enclaves of poverty and destitution are \r\nemerging, even in the wealthiest and better-off \r\ncountries. It is becoming harder and harder to contain \r\noutbreaks involving ethnic and religious intolerance, \r\neven in societies with well-established traditions of \r\ntolerance. \r\n A/66/PV.11\r\n \r\n21 11-50692 \r\n \r\n In today’s inclusive information age, there are no \r\nreliable means of protection against electronic \r\nextremism. Ten years ago, the whole world came \r\ntogether in the face of the terrible tragedy of 9/11. Yet \r\nno conclusive lessons have been learned from it, and \r\nthe resurgence of international terrorism is evident in \r\nvarious parts of the world. These are the main \r\nchallenges of the new century. \r\n In that context, I would like to draw the attention \r\nof participants in this political discussion to the \r\nfollowing. \r\n First, we have to address issues related to global \r\nnuclear safety and security. We call for the start of the \r\ndrafting of a universal declaration on a nuclear-\r\nweapon-free world. We have high hopes for the \r\nNuclear Security Summit, scheduled to be held in \r\nSeoul in 2012. It is necessary to expand the legal \r\nframework for, and increase international control by \r\nthe United Nations and the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency, compliance by all countries with their \r\nobligations in the area of non-proliferation. \r\n We welcome the Treaty between the United States \r\nof America and the Russian Federation on Measures \r\nfor the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic \r\nOffensive Arms. We consider it important that all \r\nStates that make up the Nuclear Club join that process. \r\n Today the world faces a paradoxical situation: \r\nsome are allowed to possess and upgrade nuclear \r\nweapons, while others are strictly forbidden to be \r\nengaged even in research and development. This is \r\nunjust, disproportionate and unfair. The relevant \r\nprovisions of international law must thus be reviewed. \r\nThe idea is to strengthen the responsibility of all \r\nStates, especially nuclear-weapon States, to reduce \r\nnuclear weapons and gradually destroy their stockpiles. \r\n Today there are no clear legal assurances to \r\nnon-nuclear States by nuclear-weapon Powers. In this \r\nimportant dimension, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \r\nof Nuclear Weapons does not work. At this stage, \r\nnuclear weapons are not a deterrent but a catalyst of an \r\narms race. \r\n In the twenty-first century, general curbs on the \r\narms race can be effectively provided only by a \r\ncollegial body with broad powers such as the Security \r\nCouncil. I also propose that we issue a collective \r\nappeal on the part of the international community to de \r\nfacto nuclear-weapon States to renounce their \r\nambitions and to accede to comprehensive treaties. \r\n Secondly, the increasing globalization of \r\neconomic processes requires a paradigm shift in the \r\neconomic component of the work of the United \r\nNations. The raison d’être of global mechanisms for \r\ncurrency, trade and economic regulation should be the \r\nforecasting of global crises and the elimination of their \r\ncauses. \r\n It is generally agreed today that the current global \r\ncrisis was caused by deficiencies in the global financial \r\nsystem. However, to date no significant steps to \r\naddress its flaws have been taken. Procrastination in \r\ntackling this issue will result in new and violent \r\nmanifestations of the crisis and a surge of regional and \r\nglobal instability. \r\n It is important to establish an effective global \r\neconomic governance mechanism, with clear powers \r\nand lines of accountability involving all institutions \r\nand actors, an effective global reserve currency and \r\ntight control over speculative capital. In this context, a \r\npact on global regulation would seem quite relevant. \r\n The prevention of global hunger and the growing \r\nscarcity of water are other important issues. \r\n Thirdly, information space is a sphere that is as \r\nimportant to the future of humanity as mineral \r\nresources, air, the aquatic world and outer space. Yet \r\ntoday not a single international convention or \r\nmultilateral treaty governs information processes. Is \r\nthat not the reason why, in practical terms, most hacker \r\nattacks on banks, businesses, Government institutions, \r\nthe military and even nuclear facilities have been able \r\nto be carried out with impunity? \r\n I consider it important to establish an \r\ninternational legal framework for global information \r\nspace. The resolution on nine elements of a global \r\nculture of cybersecurity (resolution 57/239), adopted \r\nby the General Assembly in 2002, could serve as a \r\nbasis for such efforts. \r\n Fourthly, the new world order is taking shape \r\nagainst the backdrop of increasing conflicts. It is quite \r\nsignificant that today the world’s total military \r\nspending is growing twice as fast as it did during the \r\ncold war — by 6 per cent a year, reaching $1.5 trillion. \r\nIn this regard, my initiative to establish a United \r\nNations peacekeeping fund, which I put forward for the \r\nfirst time 19 years ago, has become even more \r\nA/66/PV.11  \r\n \r\n11-50692 22 \r\n \r\nrelevant. This would involve each State Member of the \r\nUnited Nations allotting 1 per cent of its military \r\nbudget for that purpose. I urge the international \r\ncommunity to consider this idea once again and take \r\nthe required action. \r\n Sixty-six years ago, the United Nations was \r\nfounded as an organization based on the principle of \r\nthe sovereign equality of all its Members. However, \r\none cannot but notice how today the principle of \r\nnational sovereignty and territorial integrity is being \r\neroded. That could undermine trust between nations. \r\nToday it is essential to upgrade the norms of \r\ninternational law concerning the national sovereignty \r\nof States and, taking into account new realities, clearly \r\ndefine the bounds beyond which the involvement of the \r\ninternational community in the settlement of internal \r\nconflicts is warranted. \r\n Global peace will be enhanced only if the United \r\nNations works more closely with regional security \r\narrangements. With respect to the Eurasian region, \r\nthese are the Conference on Interaction and \r\nConfidence-building Measures in Asia, the Shanghai \r\nCooperation Organization and the Collective Security \r\nTreaty Organization. It is important to ensure that the \r\ncomposition and the work of the Security Council \r\nadequately reflect the structure of the modern world. At \r\nthe same time, the veto mechanism will guarantee that \r\nthe decisions that are adopted are balanced and \r\neffective. \r\n Kazakhstan has announced its candidacy for a \r\nnon-permanent seat in the Security Council for 2017-\r\n2018. We count on the support of the international \r\ncommunity in this respect. \r\n The complex question of Palestine has been \r\nactively discussed these days. Kazakhstan supports the \r\ncreation of a Palestinian State. A difficult issue, \r\nhowever, has been placed on the scales of history; \r\nPresident Obama spoke about this. For the long-\r\nsuffering Palestinian people, like the Israeli people, the \r\nnegotiating process has been ongoing for more than \r\n50 years. Without independence and their own State, \r\nthe Palestinians will not be able to achieve sustainable \r\npeace in the Middle East. \r\n Each new era in the history of humanity gives \r\nrise to formidable challenges. Today, the most \r\nimportant task is to successfully navigate the complex \r\nglobal transformations of the twenty-first century. \r\nTrust and unity among all nations will be a pillar of an \r\nequitable new world order. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of \r\nthe Republic of Kazakhstan for the statement he has \r\njust made. \r\n Mr. Nursultan Nazarbayev, President of the \r\nRepublic of Kazakhstan, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Nicolas Sarkozy, President of the \r\nFrench Republic  \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the French \r\nRepublic. \r\n Mr. Nicolas Sarkozy, President of the French \r\nRepublic, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Nicolas \r\nSarkozy, President of the French Republic, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Sarkozy (spoke in French): When we \r\nmet in this very place in September last year, who \r\namong us could have imagined that in barely one year \r\nthe world, already shaken by an unprecedented \r\neconomic crisis, would undergo such change? Within a \r\nfew months, the Arab Spring gave rise to immense \r\nhope. \r\n The Arab peoples, too long crushed by \r\noppression, were able to raise their heads and claimed \r\nthe right to be free at last. They fought back against the \r\nviolence and brutality with their bare hands. To those \r\nwho proclaimed that the Arab Muslim world was by \r\nnature hostile to democracy and human rights, the \r\nyoung Arabs produced the most cogent denial. \r\n We do not have the right to disappoint the hope of \r\nthe Arab peoples. We do not have the right to destroy \r\ntheir dreams. For shattering the dreams of those \r\npeoples would vindicate the fanatics who have not \r\nstopped pitting Islam against the West by stirring up \r\nhatred and violence everywhere. \r\n That appeal for justice shook the world, and the \r\nworld cannot respond to that call for justice by \r\nperpetuating an injustice. That miraculous spring of the \r\n A/66/PV.11\r\n \r\n23 11-50692 \r\n \r\nArab peoples imposes on us the moral and political \r\nobligation at last to find a solution to the Middle East \r\nconflict. We cannot wait any longer. The method used \r\nto date — I weigh my words carefully — has failed. So \r\nwe must change the method. \r\n We must stop believing that a single country — \r\nwhether the largest or a small group of countries — can \r\nresolve so complex a problem. Too many large actors \r\nhave been sidelined for our efforts to succeed. I mean \r\nthat no one can believe that the peace process can \r\nsucceed without Europe, without all the permanent \r\nmembers of the Security Council and without the Arab \r\nStates that have already chosen peace. A collective \r\napproach has become indispensable in order to create \r\ntrust and to provide guarantees to each of the parties. \r\n Peace will indeed be made by the Israelis and the \r\nPalestinians, and by no one else. No one can expect to \r\nimpose it on them. But we must help them.  \r\n The method no longer works. Let us together \r\nacknowledge that setting preconditions for negotiation \r\nis to condemn ourselves to failure. Preconditions are \r\nthe opposite of negotiation. If we wish to enter into \r\nnegotiation, which is the only possible path for peace, \r\nthere must be no preconditions. \r\n Let us change the method. All the elements of a \r\nsolution are known — the Madrid Conference of 1991, \r\nPresident Obama’s speech of 19 May, the Road Map, \r\nthe Arab Peace Initiative and the parameters agreed by \r\nthe European Union. So, let us stop endlessly \r\ndiscussing the parameters and allow negotiation to \r\nbegin in line with a concrete and ambitious timetable. \r\nSixty years without one centimetre’s progress — does \r\nthat not compel us to change the method and time \r\nframe to one month to resume discussions, six months \r\nto reach agreement on borders and security, and one \r\nyear to reach a definitive settlement? \r\n As of this autumn, France proposes hosting a \r\ndonor conference so that the Palestinians can complete \r\nthe construction of their future State. France wishes to \r\nsay that we must not immediately seek the perfect \r\nsolution, because there are no perfect solutions. Let us \r\nchoose the path of compromise, which is neither \r\nrenunciation nor repudiation, but which allows us to \r\nmove forward, step by step. \r\n Thus, for 60 years the Palestinians have been \r\nwaiting for their State. Has the time not come to give \r\nthem hope? For 60 years, Israel has suffered from not \r\nbeing able to live in peace. For 60 years, the question \r\nof the peaceful coexistence of the two peoples — \r\nPalestinian and Israeli — has continued to fester. We \r\ncan no longer wait to take the path of peace. Let us put \r\nourselves in the place of the Palestinians. Is it not \r\nlegitimate that they claim their State? Of course it is. \r\nAnd who does not see that creating a democratic, \r\nviable and peaceful Palestinian State would be, for \r\nIsrael, the best guarantee of its security? \r\n Let us put ourselves in the place of the Israelis. Is \r\nit not legitimate that, after 60 years of war and attacks, \r\nthey demand guarantees of that peace, so long awaited? \r\nOf course it is. I say that forcefully. If anyone \r\nanywhere in the world were to threaten the existence of \r\nIsrael, France would immediately and wholeheartedly \r\nstand alongside Israel. Threats made against a State \r\nMember of the United Nations are unacceptable, and \r\nthey will not be accepted. \r\n Today, we are facing a very difficult choice. Each \r\nof us knows — and let us stop with hypocrisy and one-\r\noff diplomacy — that full recognition of the status of a \r\nState Member of the United Nations cannot be attained \r\nat once. The first reason for that is the lack of trust \r\nbetween the main parties. But let us tell the truth: who \r\ncan doubt that a veto in the Security Council will \r\nengender a cycle of violence in the Middle East? Who \r\ncan doubt that? \r\n Must we therefore exclude an intermediate stage? \r\nWhy not envisage offering Palestine the status of \r\nUnited Nations Observer State? That would be an \r\nimportant step forward. After 60 years of immobility, \r\nwhich has paved the way for extremists, we would be \r\ngiving hope to the Palestinians by making progress \r\ntowards final status. \r\n To show their determined commitment to a \r\nnegotiated peace, the Palestinian authorities should, as \r\npart of that approach, reaffirm Israel’s right to exist \r\nand to its security. They should commit to avoiding \r\nusing this new status to resort to actions that are \r\nincompatible with the pursuit of negotiations. \r\n We have but one alternative — immobility and \r\nnegotiations that go nowhere or an intermediate \r\nsolution that would give hope to the Palestinians with \r\nthe status of an Observer State.  \r\n In parallel, Israel must observe the same restraint. \r\nIt must abstain from any actions that would prejudge \r\nthe final status.  \r\nA/66/PV.11  \r\n \r\n11-50692 24 \r\n \r\n The ultimate goal must be mutual recognition of \r\ntwo nation-States for two peoples established on the \r\nbasis of the 1967 lines with agreed and equivalent \r\nexchanges of land.  \r\n The General Assembly, which has a power to do \r\nso, should decide to move ahead, leave behind the fatal \r\ntrap of paralysis, missed appointments and short-lived \r\nattempts to relaunch the process. Let us change our \r\napproach. Let us change our state of mind. Each should \r\ntry to understand the reasoning, sufferings and fears of \r\nthe other. Each must open its eyes and be ready to \r\nmake concessions. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to say to the \r\nPalestinian people with the deep and sincere friendship \r\nI hold for them: “Think of the Israeli mothers grieving \r\nfor their family members killed in terrorist attacks. \r\nThey feel the same pain as the Palestinian mothers \r\nconfronted with the brutal death of one of theirs”. \r\n I would like to say to the Israeli people with the \r\ndeep and sincere friendship I hold for them: “Listen to \r\nwhat the young people of the Arab Spring are saying: \r\n‘Long live freedom!’ They are not crying ‘Down with \r\nIsrael’. You cannot remain immobile when this wind of \r\nfreedom and democracy is blowing in your region”. \r\n I say with deep and sincere friendship for these \r\ntwo peoples who have suffered so much that the time \r\nhas come to build peace for the children of Palestine \r\nand for the children of Israel. But it would be a great \r\nshame if the General Assembly did not seize the \r\nopportunity of the reawakening of the Arab peoples to \r\ndemocracy to settle a problem that brings unhappiness \r\nto these two peoples, who are in any event condemned \r\nto live alongside each other. If we take a compromise \r\nsolution, we will rebuild trust and we will give people \r\nhope. \r\n I say that with the utmost gravity to the \r\nrepresentatives of all nations. We must assume an \r\nhistoric responsibility. It is the General Assembly of \r\nthe United Nations that must keep this appointment \r\nwith History. \r\n Let us reassure Israel and give hope to the \r\nPalestinian people. The solution is on the table. Let us \r\ntake this compromise solution over deadlock. Deadlock \r\nmight satisfy everyone here, but it will create violence, \r\nbitterness and opposition that will imperil the \r\nresurgence of the Arab peoples. To that, France says \r\nthat the tragedy must cease for a simple reason: it has \r\ngone on for too long. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of \r\nthe French Republic for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Nicolas Sarkozy, President of the French \r\nRepublic, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Ms. Cristina Fernández, President of the \r\nArgentine Republic \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the \r\nArgentine Republic. \r\n Ms. Cristina Fernández, President of the \r\nArgentine Republic, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations Her Excellency Ms. Cristina \r\nFernández, President of the Argentine Republic, and to \r\ninvite her to address the Assembly. \r\n President Fernández (spoke in Spanish): Exactly \r\neight years ago, in this same context and from this \r\nsame rostrum, the President of my country, Néstor \r\nCarlos Kirchner, addressed the Assembly, four years \r\nafter having assumed the presidency of the Argentine \r\nRepublic with only 22 per cent of the vote. Given the \r\nsituation of the Argentine Republic — which had fallen \r\ninto default in 2001, where about a quarter of the \r\npopulation was unemployed and levels of destitution \r\nand poverty had exceeded 50 per cent — he stated that \r\nthe multilateral credit institutions needed reform, \r\nparticularly the International Monetary Fund, as did the \r\npolitical bodies of this honourable Organization. \r\n President Kirchner made five speeches to the \r\nGeneral Assembly, and I have made four. This is my \r\nfourth statement as President of the Republic. In each \r\nof our addresses we have made the same calls to a \r\nworld that has changed significantly since 2003, when \r\nthe Argentine Republic was cast as a black sheep gone \r\nastray and which found itself in default because of a \r\ncontinued failure to fulfil its obligations. In reality, we \r\nwere victims, used as guinea pigs in the experiments of \r\nthe 1990s and neoliberal policies. \r\n A/66/PV.11\r\n \r\n25 11-50692 \r\n \r\n Much has happened since then, when Argentina \r\ndefaulted on the largest debt — at least, so far — in the \r\nhistory of humanity, $160 billion. Over the past eight \r\nyears, Argentina has restructured its debt, reducing it \r\nfrom 160 per cent to less than 30 per cent of gross \r\ndomestic product (GDP). The rates of poverty and \r\nindigence have been reduced to single digits, and we \r\nmust continue that fight. Our unemployment rate is \r\namong the lowest, and we have completed the most \r\nsignificant cycle of economic growth in our 200 years \r\nof history. \r\n Among the emerging countries of our region, \r\nLatin America, Argentina has had the leading growth \r\nrate and is regularly paying its debt without turning to \r\ncapital markets. I am not going to list all of the \r\nnumbers, but they are very compelling. In 2003, we \r\nspent 2 per cent of GDP on education and 5 per cent on \r\ndebt payments. Today, Argentina devotes 6.47 per cent \r\nof its GDP to education and spends 2 per cent to debt \r\npayment. \r\n The situation in the world is quite different. Many \r\nregions and countries have severe problems. Argentina \r\ndoes not pretend to be a model or an example for \r\nanyone, but we do wish to reaffirm the need to \r\nformulate clear rules with regard to the transfer of \r\ncapital in the area of financial speculation. Many \r\nspeakers before me, and doubtless many more to come \r\nwill do the same, have complained about financial \r\ncommodity speculation, especially in the food sector. \r\n When we compare the growth of global financial \r\nstocks to global GDP — what all of the citizens and \r\nbusinesses of the world produce in goods and services — it \r\nbecomes clear why we are facing a world where \r\nspeculation is out of control, careening from one side \r\nto the other and from one country or region to another, \r\naffecting currencies, economies and the daily lives of \r\ncitizens, destroying jobs and preventing people from \r\nobtaining a dignified education and health care. \r\n If we look at the relationship between global \r\nGDP and financial stocks in the 1980s, we see that it \r\nwas a one-to-one relationship. There was a financial \r\nstock that was exactly equal to the goods and services \r\nbeing produced by the world. From the 1990s, figures \r\nskyrocketed. In 2008 total financial stocks, total \r\nfinancial activity in the world, reached 3.6 times the \r\nglobal GDP. This meant a tremendous gap between \r\nwhat we produce and what is in what I call the “enter \r\nkey” economy. I call it that because, if we go looking \r\nfor these shares, they are mere keystrokes transferring \r\nnumbers from one place to another, from one currency \r\nto another, producing unparalleled market volatility \r\nand recurrent crises whereby exchanges go up and \r\ndown on a daily basis. This not only destroys \r\nthousands of jobs but also generates immense profits \r\nthat someone is pocketing. \r\n We would like to reiterate once again, in the light \r\nof our own experience — and I reiterate once again \r\nthat I do not want to set up a model — the need for \r\nmultilateral credit organizations to work extremely \r\nhard on regulating the global movement of capital and \r\nfinancial speculation. If this does not happen, it will be \r\nimpossible to achieve that ever elusive market stability, \r\nand as a result, the economies of both emerging \r\ncountries, which have been sustaining the growth of \r\nthe global economic activity, and developed countries \r\nalike will be overwhelmed. \r\n It is crucial that this message be understood, \r\nbecause today we may see speculation on food; \r\nyesterday, it was on oil, and tomorrow, it could be on \r\nlittle candies, if that would be profitable and beneficial \r\nto the moving of this capital, which gets transferred \r\nfrom one side of the world to the other without any \r\ncontrol or regulation whatsoever. \r\n Here I must say that, as a member of the Group of \r\n20 at the London meeting — when it was decided to \r\ninject an enormous amount of financial resources into \r\nthe financial sector that was experiencing problems — \r\nI maintained that it was necessary to guarantee that \r\nthose resources being injected into the financial world \r\ncould later return to the real economy, the concrete \r\neconomy, to be able to generate employment, products \r\nand services.  \r\n Unfortunately, we continue to find ourselves in \r\nthe same situation, because other than the changes that \r\nI would describe as purely cosmetic, we have gone no \r\nfurther with the necessary regulation. \r\n Moreover, the credit ratings agencies — which \r\nbear a great deal of the responsibility for much of what \r\nhas happened — rate Argentina, for example, as a \r\nmarginal economy. Until very recently, they \r\ncategorized economies on the brink of default higher \r\nthan that of Argentina. Therefore, transparent \r\nregulation of the ratings agencies is needed, as they \r\nbear a great responsibility for the crisis we are \r\ncurrently seeing in various regions — which will, of \r\ncourse, have an impact on all countries. \r\nA/66/PV.11  \r\n \r\n11-50692 26 \r\n \r\n It is regrettable that we have been asking for the \r\nreform, reorganization and modification of the \r\nmultilateral credit bodies for so long now. Indeed, we \r\nbelieve that this task should already have been begun, \r\nalready formulated, in order to avoid precisely what we \r\nare experiencing now. For some people it is just a \r\nmatter of numbers on the stock market, but for others \r\nthey signal the destruction of the hopes of a lifetime. \r\n As I was saying to a colleague the other day \r\nduring a visit to Europe, economic crises always end \r\nup impacting the political system. There cannot be a \r\nserious economic crisis, in which millions of people \r\nfall into poverty and lose their jobs, homes, education \r\nand health, without that also signalling profound \r\npolitical transformation. And when such political \r\ntransformation results in further serious economic \r\ncrises, the result is experiences that I will not go into \r\nnow. Totalitarianism often came out of crises. The \r\ntwentieth century produced crises that were not \r\nadequately solved by political means. \r\n I call once again for the reform of this important \r\nOrganization, which represents multilateralism — \r\nsomething we have always consistently defended. We \r\nneed a more pluralistic and diverse world, and to make \r\npolitical bodies such as the United Nations, and \r\ncrucially the Security Council, more democratic. \r\n We do not agree on the need to expand the \r\nnumber of permanent members; on the contrary, we \r\nbelieve that the permanent member category should be \r\neliminated. The right to veto also should be eliminated, \r\nas it really prevents the Security Council from carrying \r\nout the true functions that it had in the bipolar world in \r\nwhich it was originally conceived. At that time, the \r\nright to veto was necessary, because in that bipolar \r\nworld, with the fear of a nuclear holocaust, that right \r\ngave to Council members the balance necessary to \r\nensure the security of humankind. Today, that balance \r\nis broken. Permanent seats and the right to veto are not \r\nabout defending security or universal stability; rather, \r\nthey are often about the position of Council members \r\nexercising their right. \r\n In my most recent statement before the Assembly \r\n(see A/65/PV.14), I believe I concluded by expressing \r\nmy hope that this year Palestine would be become the \r\n194th Member of the concert of the United Nations. \r\nMy country, Argentina, like most South American \r\nnations, has recognized the State of Palestine.  \r\n I sincerely believe that blocking the entry of \r\nPalestine could perhaps be seen by some as benefiting \r\nthe State of Israel. But allow me to say to Assembly \r\nmembers, on the authority we have as a country that \r\nhas suffered from the scourge of international \r\nterrorism, that to prevent Palestine from becoming a \r\nmember of this Assembly means to continue providing \r\nalibis to those who engage in international terrorism \r\nand who in that repudiation find precisely one of the \r\nfalse arguments they use to justify their crimes.  \r\n I believe that the non-inclusion of Palestine this \r\nyear, far from providing greater security and stability \r\nin the world, will bring about greater insecurity and \r\nconditions that are utterly unfavourable to what should \r\nbe the prestige of a body that should represent the \r\ninterests of all citizens of the world. \r\n For that reason, I ask that God will enlighten \r\nthose who must make this historic and structural \r\ndecision of global significance so that greater balance \r\ncan be achieved and so that this year Palestine will be \r\nable to take its seat number 194. I am sure that if we \r\nsucceed in that endeavour we will help to create a \r\nworld that is not only safer, but more just. \r\n I would like to make another point, one linked to \r\nthe situation that we have been describing, with regard \r\nto what is shown by the injustice of certain \r\ncountries — five, to be exact — on the Security \r\nCouncil having veto rights. Once again, we have come \r\nto the heart of the United Nations to raise an issue that \r\nis just as vital, and not only to Argentines.  \r\n The question of sovereignty over the Malvinas \r\nIslands is also a trial by fire for this body in terms of \r\nwhether it is possible for it to comply with a policy that \r\nis essentially multilateral and under which all members \r\nare obliged to accept the resolutions of this Assembly.  \r\n Ten General Assembly resolutions have invited \r\nthe United Kingdom and my country to sit down to \r\nnegotiate and discuss our sovereignty. Bear in mind \r\nthat Argentina is not asking for those resolutions to be \r\nimplemented in terms of recognizing sovereignty. No, \r\nit is simply asking for compliance with some of the \r\nprovisions of the 10 United Nations resolutions on the \r\nmatter.  \r\n Perhaps we could also list the 29 resolutions of \r\nthe Special Political and Decolonization Committee \r\nand the 11 resolutions and 8 declarations of the \r\nOrganization of American States, as well as the \r\n A/66/PV.11\r\n \r\n27 11-50692 \r\n \r\nresolutions of various forums — Ibero-American \r\nforums, the Union of South American Nations, the \r\nCommon Market of the South, meetings of the Arab \r\nand African countries — and the entire world. Through \r\nsuch resolutions and declarations, all of them have \r\nbeen demanding that this issue be addressed. The \r\nUnited Kingdom has systematically refused to do so \r\nand has obviously used its status as a veto-wielding \r\nmember of the Security Council to that end.  \r\n The year 2013 will mark the passage of 180 years \r\nsince the Argentines were expelled by force of arms \r\nfrom our Malvinas Islands. Next year will mark \r\n30 years since an incident — which the United \r\nKingdom took advantage of — that was committed by \r\nthe most terrible dictatorship in memory, of which we \r\nArgentines were ourselves victims.  \r\n I am proud to be the Government that has set an \r\nexample for the world in terms of human rights and the \r\nprosecution of those responsible for committing crimes \r\nand acts of genocide. That is why I believe that \r\nfocusing on that incident is nothing other than one of \r\nthe many excuses given to justify non-compliance with \r\nUnited Nations resolutions. What is worse, I ask all of \r\nthose who see themselves in the mirror of a future \r\nworld in which natural resources will be necessary, to \r\nsee how our natural resources, our fisheries and our \r\npetroleum resources, are being stolen and illegally \r\nseized by those who have no right to do so. Obviously, \r\nI do not feel it necessary to emphasize the fact that no \r\none can lay claim to an overseas territory that is more \r\nthan 14,000 kilometres away. That is clearly an illegal \r\noccupation. \r\n Once again, we call upon the United Kingdom to \r\ncomply with the resolutions of the United Nations. \r\nRecently, there have been genuine provocations, \r\nincluding missile tests in May and July, which were \r\ndenounced before the International Maritime \r\nOrganization, which also suffered one of those attacks. \r\nOnce again, I reiterate to this Assembly and to the \r\nUnited Kingdom Argentina’s interest in dialogue. It is \r\ntrue that much time has passed, however. We state \r\nhere, before this Assembly, that we will wait for a \r\nreasonable period of time, but if nothing transpires, we \r\nwill be forced to begin reviewing the provisional \r\nunderstandings that are still in effect. We emphasize in \r\nparticular that the question of sovereignty must be \r\nincluded in those understandings.  \r\n Members may ask what I am referring to here. It \r\nis the joint statement and exchange of letters of 14 July \r\n1999 on resuming a regular weekly LAN Chile flight \r\nbetween Punta Arenas and the Malvinas Islands with \r\ntwo monthly stopovers, one in each direction, in Río \r\nGallegos. \r\n Argentina has no intention of exacerbating the \r\nsituation for any party, but it is also fair that this \r\nAssembly and the United Kingdom be aware that there \r\nmust be compliance with the resolutions. We cannot \r\nwait 180 years, or 30 years, just as Palestine cannot be \r\nmaking pilgrimages over the decades to find a place in \r\nthe world. Still less can the Argentines wait to reclaim \r\nthe territory that legitimately belongs to us.  \r\n I cannot conclude without referring to an issue \r\nthat has been mentioned in all of the statements that \r\nPresident Kirchner and I have delivered here since \r\n2003. A few moments ago, when I spoke of the \r\nquestion of Palestine, my authority to do so — if \r\nindeed it gives us authority, as such — is derived from \r\nthe fact that we are one of the only two countries in the \r\nAmericas that have been the target of international \r\nterrorism.  \r\n This happened on two occasions. In 1992, there \r\nwas the explosion at the Israeli Embassy in Buenos \r\nAires, and in 1994, there was the blast at the Argentine \r\nIsraelite Mutual Association (AMIA), which is one of \r\nthe most important mutual associations in Argentina. I \r\nstress not that it is a Jewish association, but that it is an \r\nArgentine association. This was an attack on Argentina.  \r\n I am demanding, on the basis of the requirements \r\nof Argentine justice, that the Islamic Republic of Iran \r\nsubmit to the legal authority and in particular allow for \r\nthose who have been accused of some level of \r\nparticipation in the AMIA attack to be brought to \r\njustice.  \r\n Last year, we proposed here that if they did not \r\ntrust our country’s justice system, we could take the \r\napproach that was taken for the Lockerbie case: we \r\ncould choose a court from a third country, by mutual \r\nagreement, in order for that court to be able to provide \r\nthe only thing that we are demanding — that is, justice. \r\nWe insist on this because it is a universal demand. It \r\ndoes not have to do with political positions. This word, \r\njustice, is in the Talmud, the Bible and the Koran, and, \r\nfor those who do not believe in anything, I am sure it is \r\nin their country’s constitution.  \r\nA/66/PV.11  \r\n \r\n11-50692 28 \r\n \r\n The Government of Argentina received, on \r\n16 July, a message from the Foreign Ministry of Iran \r\nstating that it intended to cooperate in initiating a \r\nconstructive dialogue with Argentina in order to help \r\nus get at the truth with respect to the brutal attack \r\nagainst the Argentine Israelite Mutual Association of \r\n18 July 1994. The message that we received from Iran, \r\nalthough signifying a change of attitude on the part of \r\nthe Government, does not satisfy our demands, which, \r\nas I said quite clearly, are for justice.  \r\n However, it is an offer of dialogue that Argentina \r\ncannot and must not reject. We are here calling for \r\ndialogue with the United Kingdom and dialogue among \r\nall the parties that make up this body. My country does \r\nthis on the basis of its commitment to fulfilling its \r\nobligation to resolve controversies through peaceful \r\nmeans. This attitude has characterized our country \r\nthroughout our history. This means that in one sense, \r\nArgentina must put aside the requirements arising from \r\nour national justice system with respect to prosecuting \r\nthe presumed perpetrators of these attacks. In another \r\nsense, we cannot do this, as this is up to judges and \r\npublic prosecutors.  \r\n What we would like to say, however, is that we \r\nthink that this dialogue must be constructive. It must be \r\na sincere dialogue and must achieve results in order to \r\nbe credible and therefore not be understood as just a \r\ndelay tactic or a distraction. \r\n I will conclude my statement. Sometimes, I think \r\nof everything that has happened to Argentines. These \r\nthings have happened to many countries at various \r\ntimes, but they have all happened to us, in our country, \r\nduring our history. We have had the worst economic \r\nand social disaster in living memory. We still have \r\ntoday a Power exercising a colonial influence in our \r\ncountry. International terrorism has twice made us the \r\ntarget of its attacks. So, if we think of it, it is as if all of \r\nthe problems and all of the tragedies and miseries of \r\nthis world decided to focus on one single country.  \r\n Our capacity to recover, in terms of the economy, \r\nour tireless and never-ending fight to recover what is \r\nours, our never-ending demand for justice for the \r\nvictims of the attacks, and the strength that we have \r\ndrawn from all of these tragedies give me the \r\nconfidence and certainty that this is the path we have \r\nchosen: that of achieving growth along with social \r\ninclusion for our fellow citizens. It is the path of \r\nensuring that there is unlimited respect for human \r\nrights, with trials carried out for the sake of \r\nremembrance, truth and justice. It is the path that \r\nensures that today, as the President of all Argentines, I \r\ncan be accompanied here by family members of \r\nvictims of the AMIA attack. They have confidence that \r\nthe Government will continue to do what it has always \r\ndone, which is to defend the values of truth and justice.  \r\n That is what gives me great hope that God will \r\nshed light on the path of all those who have to make \r\ndecisions, not with a view to elections but with a view \r\nto the destiny of the world in upcoming decades. That \r\nis why I would like to greet everyone today who has \r\ntaken the floor or who will take the floor and thank the \r\nentire Assembly for the support that they have each \r\ngiven, in all of these causes, to my country, the \r\nArgentine Republic.  \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of \r\nthe Argentine Republic for the statement she has just \r\nmade. \r\n Ms. Cristina Fernández, President of the \r\nArgentine Republic, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.  \r\n \r\nAddress by General Michel Sleiman, President of the \r\nLebanese Republic \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the \r\nLebanese Republic. \r\n General Michel Sleiman, President of the \r\nLebanese Republic, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations His Excellency General Michel \r\nSleiman, President of the Lebanese Republic, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.  \r\n President Sleiman (spoke in Arabic): First of all, \r\nI would like to congratulate you, Sir, on your election \r\nas President of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth \r\nsession, especially since you represent a brotherly \r\ncountry that has constantly shown solidarity with \r\nLebanon and has played a key role in advancing \r\nagreement and mutual understanding in the Doha \r\nAgreement and in Lebanon’s reconstruction. I do this \r\nhoping that our deliberations will contribute to \r\n A/66/PV.11\r\n \r\n29 11-50692 \r\n \r\nshedding light on rightful causes and buttressing the \r\nlogic of justice. \r\n This year’s General Assembly is held in a context \r\ndominated by major Arab developments and the \r\nrightful Palestinian endeavour for the State of Palestine \r\nto be recognized and to obtain full membership in the \r\nUnited Nations. In addition, there are other issues such \r\nas the persistent tensions on the Korean peninsula, \r\nnatural disasters that threaten different parts of the \r\nworld and the persistence of the phenomenon of \r\nterrorism as we commemorate the tenth anniversary of \r\nthe 11 September attacks, which we strongly condemn. \r\n I stand before the General Assembly today as the \r\nrepresentative of a country that since its inception has \r\ncarried the message of freedom, concord and \r\nmoderation. Lebanon strives to consecrate and \r\nconsolidate that message, in spite of the challenges and \r\nthreats, both in the East and the West, to models of \r\ncoexistence and cultural diversity. In accordance with \r\nits Constitution, Lebanon is “a parliamentary \r\ndemocratic republic based on respect for civil liberties, \r\nespecially the freedom of opinion and belief”. \r\nMoreover, “[t]he people are the source of authority and \r\nsovereignty; they shall exercise these powers through \r\nthe constitutional institutions”.  \r\n Indeed, Lebanon has committed itself to those \r\nprinciples, to the devolution of power and to the \r\nparticipation of all religious communities in the \r\nmanagement of public affairs, in spite of the wars and \r\naggression it has suffered over decades. Moreover, \r\nLebanon has always been committed to respecting \r\nlegitimate international decisions and resolutions, \r\nincluding those of the Special Tribunal for Lebanon, as \r\nthe ministerial statements of the successive Lebanese \r\nCabinets have asserted. \r\n Over the past months, the Arab region has \r\nwitnessed events and mass popular movements calling \r\nfor freedom, democracy and the establishment of the \r\nrule of law, rejecting authoritarianism, favouritism and \r\ncorruption. Lebanese intellectuals, members of the \r\nmedia and activists have championed and laboured for \r\nevery movement of reawakening in the Levant, to \r\nmake the region a beacon of revitalization. Along with \r\nthem, Lebanon welcomes any peaceful approach or \r\nmeans to achieve reform, to consecrate the principles \r\nof democracy, justice and modernity and to preserve \r\nhuman dignity and fundamental freedoms.  \r\n Only through those principles and systems can \r\nsecurity and peace for all segments of our societies be \r\nachieved and an environment conducive to sound \r\nhuman development be ensured. We must respond to \r\nthe recent upwellings and changes in the Arab world in \r\nsuch a way that they serve its common good, foster its \r\nprogress and dignity and prevent it from veering \r\ntowards extremism, chaos, fragmentation and religious \r\nor sectarian division. \r\n At the same time, it must be brought to the \r\nattention of the international community that the wave \r\nof popular protest that has arisen in some Arab \r\ncountries cannot be perceived as stemming simply \r\nfrom demands to improve living conditions. Therefore, \r\nallocating funds to support economic and social \r\ndevelopment in Arab countries undergoing transition is \r\nnot by itself sufficient to promote democracy, \r\nmoderation and openness. Indeed, means should be \r\nexplored to dispel feelings of injustice and oppression \r\nrankling in the hearts of Arab peoples, who have been \r\nmarginalized for decades, their development and \r\ngrowth impeded by Israeli practices and threats, on one \r\nhand, and by their exclusion from the tide of modernity \r\nand globalization, on the other.  \r\n Any such approaches require serious, determined \r\nefforts — within the framework of an integrated \r\nprocess — to impose a just and comprehensive solution \r\nto all aspects of the conflict in the Middle East, based \r\non international resolutions, the Madrid terms of \r\nreference and the Arab Peace Initiative in all its \r\nprovisions. That would lay the foundation for a broader \r\ndialogue and understanding between the East and the \r\nWest and among civilizations, cultures and religions. \r\nSuch an understanding is historically overdue, after \r\ndecades marked by feelings of injustice and hostility, \r\ndestructive wars and missed opportunities. \r\n In that connection, it is important to underscore \r\nthe right and just Palestinian effort to earn full \r\nrecognition of the State of Palestine and for its full \r\nmembership in the United Nations, in accordance with \r\nthe right to self-determination. Lebanon will work for \r\nthe success of those efforts, with the coordination and \r\ncooperation of brotherly and friendly countries. \r\nHowever, recognition of the Palestinian State and its \r\naccession to the United Nations, though greatly \r\nimportant, would neither restore full rights to the \r\nPalestinians nor represent a final solution to the \r\nPalestinian question. \r\nA/66/PV.11  \r\n \r\n11-50692 30 \r\n \r\n Until a final and just political solution to the \r\nquestion of Palestine is reached — one guaranteeing \r\nthe Palestinian refugees’ right of return — the United \r\nNations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine \r\nRefugees in the Near East (UNRWA) remains \r\nresponsible for the relief of Palestinian refugees, in \r\ncooperation with the host countries. Along with our \r\nPalestinian brothers, Lebanon rejects any form of \r\npermanent settlement of those refugees. For that reason \r\nthe UNRWA budget must be constantly maintained. \r\nThe Agency must not be merged with other United \r\nNations bodies, which would weaken its capacity. \r\n In another context, Lebanon has recognized the \r\nLibyan National Transitional Council, and it expects \r\nLibyan officials, with whom it is communicating for \r\nthis purpose, to uncover the fate of Imam Musa al-Sadr \r\nand his two companions, who were made to disappear \r\nin Libya during an official visit in 1978. \r\n A few days ago, Lebanon hosted the Second \r\nMeeting of States Parties to the Convention on Cluster \r\nMunitions, which concluded with the 2011 Beirut \r\nDeclaration. That was a defining moment in the \r\nimplementation of the Convention. Humanitarian \r\nconsiderations are at the heart of international concern \r\nabout cluster munitions. The Meeting highlighted the \r\nterrible human fallout of those weapons, which were \r\nused heavily by Israel during its aggression of July \r\n2006. To this day, those weapons threaten civilians on \r\ntheir farmlands and innocent children at play in open \r\nfields in South Lebanon.  \r\n Israel should be condemned for its use of those \r\nweapons, and appropriate compensation should be \r\ndemanded for the extensive property damage and harm \r\nto people it has caused Lebanon with those weapons. \r\nIsrael should compensate as well for the overall \r\ndamage caused by its repeated aggression against \r\nLebanon, including damage caused by the oil slick that \r\nresulted from the Israeli bombardment of the Jiyeh \r\nPower Station in the summer of 2006. \r\n On the fifth anniversary of the adoption of \r\nSecurity Council resolution 1701 (2006), Lebanon \r\nreiterates its commitment to persevere in implementing \r\nthat resolution. Lebanon calls once again on the \r\ninternational community to bring pressure to bear on \r\nIsrael to abide by all its provisions. Those provisions \r\nrequire Israel to halt its daily violations of Lebanese \r\nsovereignty and to withdraw immediately from \r\nLebanese territories that it still occupies in the northern \r\npart of Al-Ghajar village, the Shaba’a farms and the \r\nhills of Kfar Shouba. Furthermore, Israel must cease its \r\npersistent threats against Lebanon and its infrastructure \r\nand its endeavours to destabilize the country through \r\nits spying networks and recruitment of agents. \r\nMeanwhile, we maintain our right to liberate or \r\nretrieve all of our occupied territories through all \r\nlegitimate available means. \r\n On the other hand, we emphasize that we strongly \r\nuphold our full sovereign and economic rights over our \r\nterritorial waters and exclusive economic zone and our \r\nfreedom to exploit our natural resources, be they on \r\nland or in the deep sea, free from any designs or \r\nthreats.  \r\n We have addressed to the Secretary-General an \r\nextensive correspondence setting out the boundaries of \r\nour territorial waters and the legitimacy of our \r\nterritorial rights. Specifically, we laid out the \r\ngeographic coordinates of the southern and south-\r\nwestern borders of Lebanon’s exclusive economic \r\nzone. We raised particular objections to Israeli \r\nviolations and aggression that violate those rights. \r\nFurthermore, as we warned against any initiative to \r\nexploit the resources of the disputed maritime zones, \r\nwe asked the Secretary-General to take all measures he \r\ndeems appropriate to avoid any conflict. \r\n I would like to take this opportunity to commend \r\nthe crucial role in south Lebanon of the United Nations \r\nInterim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) carried out in \r\ncoordination and full cooperation with the Lebanese \r\nArmy. I would also like to commend the dedication of \r\nUNIFIL commanders and staff in carrying out the \r\nmission they have been entrusted with, as well as the \r\nimmense sacrifices they have made in the service of \r\npeace. \r\n While we thank those countries that have \r\ncontributed military personnel and material for their \r\ncontinued commitment, in spite of the challenges they \r\nhave encountered, we also firmly condemn the terrorist \r\nattacks in recent months on international forces, \r\nparticularly the French and Italian battalions. We are \r\nworking earnestly to pursue the perpetrators and bring \r\nthem to justice and to prevent any recurrence of such \r\nincidents. \r\n The United Nations has played an ever-growing \r\nrole in maintaining international peace and security and \r\nin intervening to resolve disputes in many troubled \r\nregions of the world. So far, however, it has been \r\n A/66/PV.11\r\n \r\n31 11-50692 \r\n \r\nunable to show effectiveness in the Middle East, where \r\ngrave dangers still threaten international peace and \r\nsecurity as a result of Israel’s ongoing defiance of \r\nresolutions of international legitimacy; its unacceptable \r\nrejection of the basic conditions required for peace; \r\nand its persistence in conducting abusive practices in \r\nGaza and the occupied territories, such as the illegal \r\nconstruction of settlements and violations of human \r\nrights. \r\n This demands that negotiations on reform of the \r\nSecurity Council come to fruition, so that the Council \r\ncan be brought more into line with the new geopolitical \r\nsituation and be capable of ensuring the \r\nimplementation of its binding resolutions. \r\n In conclusion, as we celebrate the centenary of \r\nInternational Women’s Day this year, we must take \r\ngreater advantage of the potential and talents of half of \r\nhumankind, rather than merely seeking to enshrine \r\ngender equality in principle. Women are making an \r\nenormous contribution to raising and educating the \r\nyounger generation, promoting peace, reducing \r\npoverty, hunger, disease and environmental \r\ndegradation, and promoting sustainable development \r\nopportunities. \r\n Mr. Ramgoolam (Mauritius), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair. \r\n The general debate in the Assembly is an \r\noccasion for all of us to renew the vows we made in \r\n1945 in order to address the challenges and crises \r\nfacing us — by working through institutions of \r\ninternational legitimacy and agreed collective \r\nsolutions, in conformity with the basic principles of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations, its resolutions and the \r\nprovisions of international law, provided that they are \r\nbased on the spirit of justice and avoid double \r\nstandards. History has taught us that this choice is the \r\none and only reasonable solution. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the \r\nLebanese Republic for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Michel Sleiman, President of the Lebanese \r\nRepublic, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Lee Myung-bak, President of the \r\nRepublic of Korea \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nKorea. \r\n Mr. Lee Myung-bak, President of the Republic of \r\nKorea, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Lee Myung-bak, President \r\nof the Republic of Korea, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly. \r\n President Lee Myung-bak (spoke in Korean; \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): I would like \r\nto begin by extending my sincere congratulations to \r\nAmbassador Al-Nasser on his assumption of the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth \r\nsession. I have every confidence that under his able \r\nleadership this session will be guided to a fruitful \r\nconclusion. \r\n May I also take this opportunity to extend my \r\nwarmest congratulations to Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon on his re-election as Secretary-General of the \r\nUnited Nations, with unanimous support from Member \r\nStates, and to thank him for the great commitment and \r\ndevotion he has shown over the past five years to \r\nachieving the vision of a responsible United Nations. I \r\nhave no doubt that in his second term he will make an \r\neven greater contribution to creating a stronger United \r\nNations for a better world. \r\n This year marks the twentieth anniversary of the \r\nRepublic of Korea’s membership in the United \r\nNations. It would be no exaggeration to say that the \r\nRepublic of Korea came into the world with the United \r\nNations and grew up along with the Organization. It \r\nwas under United Nations auspices that the democratic \r\nGovernment of the Republic of Korea was established \r\nin 1948. Through a General Assembly resolution (195 \r\n(III)), the Government of the Republic of Korea gained \r\ninternational recognition as the only lawful \r\nGovernment on the Korean peninsula. When the \r\nKorean War broke out two years later, United Nations \r\nforces played a decisive role in defending the country. \r\nIn the aftermath of the war and during the years of \r\nnational reconstruction, the United Nations provided us \r\nwith generous economic assistance and the concept of \r\nA/66/PV.11  \r\n \r\n11-50692 32 \r\n \r\nuniversal human rights, thus promoting progress on \r\nboth the economic and democratic fronts. \r\n In spite of such special historic ties between the \r\nUnited Nations and the Republic of Korea, it was only \r\nwith the end of the Cold War, in 1991, more than \r\n40 years later, that the Republic of Korea was admitted \r\nto the United Nations. For the past 20 years, the \r\nRepublic of Korea has made every effort to realize the \r\ncauses and values of the United Nations. We have \r\nplayed an active role in various areas of international \r\ncooperation, including the global fight against poverty, \r\nsustainable development, the promotion of human \r\nrights and democracy, and the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security. \r\n The Republic of Korea began its journey as one \r\nof the poorest countries in the world, engulfed in war \r\nand poverty, and has managed to achieve remarkable \r\nsuccess on both the economic and democratic fronts. It \r\nmay therefore be rightly said that the Republic of \r\nKorea is an exemplary international success story, fully \r\nembracing and reflecting the values espoused by the \r\nUnited Nations, be they those relating to democracy, \r\nhuman rights or development. \r\n Now the Republic of Korea wishes to give back \r\nto the international community even more than it has \r\nreceived. We stand ready to extend a helping hand to \r\nthose in need, providing them with appropriate support \r\nand care. We are keen to cooperate closely with the \r\nUnited Nations and to play a constructive role in \r\ncombating the various challenges facing the \r\ninternational community. \r\n Maintaining international peace and security is \r\nthe fundamental responsibility of the United Nations. \r\nFor the past 60 years, the United Nations has made \r\nevery effort to prevent war and armed conflict in the \r\ninternational arena. Furthermore, it has provided varied \r\nand creative means for maintaining sustainable peace \r\nin dangerous parts of the world, from preventive \r\ndiplomacy and peacekeeping to post-conflict \r\npeacebuilding. The most striking example may be in \r\nthe advancement of United Nations peacekeeping \r\noperations. There has been an increase in demand for \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations since the end \r\nof the Cold War. As a result, not only has there been an \r\nincrease in the number of personnel, but the work of \r\nthe operations has also become more diverse and \r\nmultifaceted, extending beyond the monitoring of \r\nceasefires to assisting in nation-building. \r\n Peacekeeping operations offer great hope for \r\nmillions of those who suffer in the midst of war and \r\nnatural disasters. The Republic of Korea is proud to \r\nparticipate in 10 United Nations peacekeeping \r\nmissions, including those in Haiti and Lebanon. \r\n Today, while still struggling with conventional \r\nsecurity threats, the international community faces new \r\ntypes of security threats, such as the spread of weapons \r\nof mass destruction (WMDs) and the threat of \r\nterrorism. The international community must \r\nstrengthen its non-proliferation regime in order to \r\nprevent the proliferation of nuclear, biological and \r\nchemical weapons and long-range missiles. \r\n Furthermore, the threat of transnational terrorism \r\nhas emerged as a serious security issue that requires \r\nconcerted effort from the international community, in \r\nparticular since the attacks of 9/11. The Republic of \r\nKorea stands firmly against, and condemns all forms \r\nand manifestations of, terrorism. Terrorism, a vicious \r\nmeans to achieve political objectives by taking \r\ninnocent civilian lives, cannot be justified under any \r\ncircumstances. The international community must \r\nreaffirm its determination to eradicate terrorism and \r\nstep up its collective counter-terrorism efforts. \r\n The greatest threat of all, perhaps, emanates from \r\nnuclear terrorism. International cooperation is now \r\nneeded more than ever to prevent it. Following the first \r\nNuclear Security Summit in Washington, D.C., last \r\nyear, the second such summit will be held in Seoul in \r\nMarch 2012. The Republic of Korea is making every \r\neffort to ensure that the Summit will constitute a \r\nvaluable opportunity for the international community \r\nto build a more solid system of international \r\ncooperation, which is necessary to prevent nuclear \r\nterrorism. \r\n This year, the international community has \r\nwitnessed a wave of dramatic changes sweeping across \r\nNorth Africa and the Middle East. The democratic \r\nmovement that began in Tunisia, which then swiftly \r\nspread to Egypt and Libya, has proved that democracy \r\nis a universal value of humankind that transcends \r\nregion and culture. At this very moment, the people of \r\nSyria and Yemen are taking great risks to hold aloft the \r\ntorch of freedom and democracy. \r\n Democracy is a vehicle that unites the basic \r\nvalues of humankind, such as freedom and equality, \r\nhuman rights and the rule of law. The people’s demand \r\nfor democracy is their legitimate right. The \r\n A/66/PV.11\r\n \r\n33 11-50692 \r\n \r\ninternational community and the United Nations must \r\ndo all they can to protect these people from persecution \r\nand human rights abuses. \r\n United Nations efforts have played a great role in \r\nthe recent democratic progress in Africa. The United \r\nNations facilitated the birth of the Republic of South \r\nSudan through peaceful referendum, and played a \r\ncrucial role in the progress of democracy in Côte \r\nd’Ivoire by realizing the transfer of power. \r\n Nevertheless, as history has only too clearly \r\nshown, building democracy is no easy task. It is \r\nimportant that fledgling economies in many parts of \r\nthe world become sustainable and robust. Above all, it \r\nis essential that these nations form stable Governments \r\nthrough elections and achieve economic development. \r\nThe United Nations must be there for them. \r\n Democracy constitutes a foundation for \r\nsustainable national development. For the Republic of \r\nKorea, economic growth and democratization have \r\nbeen achieved in a mutually reinforcing manner.  \r\n In the twenty-first century, in this age of \r\nglobalization and communication revolution, the tide \r\nof democratization is unstoppable regardless of a \r\nnation’s economic standing.  \r\n I believe that a vibrant economy will push \r\nforward economic growth in all corners of the world. \r\nTo assist developing nations pursue both democracy \r\nand economic growth is indeed the role of the United \r\nNations. \r\n The market economy and democracy have \r\nenabled humankind to fulfil the desire for a better life, \r\nalong with the values of freedom and individual \r\nhappiness. However, the growing gap between rich and \r\npoor, which unfortunately accompanies today’s highly \r\ndeveloped market economy, calls for self-reflection \r\nvis-à-vis the capitalist system and greater public \r\nresponsibility. \r\n The growing gap between developed and \r\ndeveloping countries should not only be addressed as a \r\npoverty issue, but should also be understood as a \r\npotential destabilizing element to international peace. \r\nFurthermore, this inequality stands against the global \r\nvision of achieving common prosperity for all \r\nhumankind. \r\n It is only when members of the international \r\ncommunity share each other’s burden and work \r\ntogether in a mutually complementary manner towards \r\na common goal that the eco-systemic development of \r\nthe world can be achieved. Developed nations must \r\nhelp developing countries to maximize their capacity \r\nso that they can achieve economic growth and \r\ndevelopment on their own. To that end, it is important \r\nto foster a global atmosphere that is conducive to \r\nsupporting the development of trade, investment, \r\nfinance and human resources in developing countries. \r\n International aid must focus on, and provide \r\nsupport to, areas that form the basis of economic \r\ndevelopment in developing countries, such as \r\ninfrastructure and trade-related capacity building. At \r\nthe same time, efforts must be made to strengthen the \r\nrole of multilateral organizations, including the \r\nInternational Monetary Fund and the World Bank, in \r\ndevelopment assistance. Such efforts should be \r\ngrounded in the sincere belief that the growth of \r\ndeveloping countries will provide a valuable growth \r\nengine for all, including developed countries, by \r\nexpanding global demand as a whole. \r\n Through the global financial crisis in 2008, we \r\nhave come to realize once again that we live in a highly \r\ninterconnected world. A financial crisis that started in \r\none place became global in an instant. No country was \r\nspared from the bitter sting of economic crisis. In the \r\nface of the crisis, the Group of Twenty (G-20), a \r\nmechanism that brings together both developed and \r\ndeveloping nations, was created.  \r\n The Seoul Development Consensus for Shared \r\nGrowth, which was adopted last year at the G-20 Seoul \r\nSummit, and the G-20 multi-year action plan outline \r\nspecific measures to realize growth that embraces \r\ndeveloping countries as partners. As a member of the \r\nG-20, the Republic of Korea will faithfully and \r\nactively implement those measures. \r\n The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), \r\nchampioned by the United Nations, constitute another \r\nimportant agenda that pursues shared growth between \r\ndeveloped and developing nations. The Government of \r\nthe Republic of Korea will be an active participant in \r\ninternational development cooperation as pursued by \r\nthe MDGs. We will faithfully implement our plan to \r\ndouble our current level of official development \r\nassistance by 2015 and, drawing wisdom from our past \r\nexperience, will assist developing countries in ways to \r\nbuild capacity to achieve genuine growth on their own. \r\nA/66/PV.11  \r\n \r\n11-50692 34 \r\n \r\n I hope that the fourth High-Level Forum on Aid \r\nEffectiveness to be held in Busan in November this \r\nyear will provide a valuable opportunity to set a new \r\nglobal cooperation paradigm and partnership to \r\neffectively address new changes and challenges in \r\ninternational development cooperation. \r\n The cost of reckless economic growth that \r\nignores environmental warnings will be beyond \r\nimagination. The rise in the Earth’s temperature due to \r\ngreenhouse gas emissions has caused abnormal \r\nclimatic phenomena. Ecosystem damage due to the \r\ngreenhouse effect is causing enormous economic \r\ndamage in various parts of the world. \r\n To protect our environment and promote growth \r\nat the same time, we must use less fossil fuel and more \r\nrenewable energy, while promoting the safer use of \r\nnuclear energy. Green technology devoted to meeting \r\nthese goals will create more jobs for people and will \r\nenable us to attain sustainable economic growth in \r\ndecades to come. \r\n Having designated “green growth” as a national \r\ngrowth paradigm in 2008, the Republic of Korea has \r\nbeen actively pursuing this goal. The Republic of \r\nKorea was the first country in the world to introduce \r\nthe Framework Act on Low Carbon, Green Growth. We \r\nare also investing 2 per cent of our national gross \r\ndevelopment product in green sectors every year. \r\n Another important development was the launch \r\nof the Global Green Growth Institute, which was \r\nfounded by the Republic of Korea along with like-\r\nminded countries. The aim of the Institute is to share \r\ncutting-edge green technology and experience with \r\ndeveloping countries. In so doing, developing countries \r\nwill be able to join in the global green growth \r\nmovement and attain economic growth and \r\nenvironmental protection together as one global \r\ncommunity. \r\n The United Nations shall have a more important \r\nrole than ever to play in restoring the equilibrium in \r\nthe global ecosystem and promoting shared growth in \r\nthe international community. In this regard, I welcome \r\nthe inclusion of “Green economy in the context of \r\nsustainable development and poverty eradication” as a \r\nmain theme of the 2012 United Nations Conference on \r\nSustainable Development. I look forward to the \r\nConference producing a solid vision and action plan \r\ntowards economically, socially and environmentally \r\nsustainable development. \r\n The North Korean nuclear threat poses significant \r\nchallenges to peace on the Korean peninsula, North-\r\nEast Asia and beyond. Over the past 20 years, the \r\nRepublic of Korea has made consistent diplomatic \r\nefforts, in cooperation with the international \r\ncommunity, to achieve the denuclearization of the \r\nKorean peninsula and will continue to do so. \r\n In the twenty-first century, we must first work \r\ntogether if we wish to attain peace and prosperity. This \r\nis a historical trend in which the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea must take part. It is my hope to see \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea enjoy \r\npeace and prosperity by becoming a responsible \r\nmember of the international community. When the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea chooses the \r\npath to mutual benefit and common prosperity, we will \r\nbe ready to assist in that endeavour along with the \r\ninternational community. I sincerely hope that this will \r\ntransform the Korean peninsula from a place of conflict \r\nand strife into a bedrock of peace in North-East Asia \r\nand the world. \r\n Today, humankind faces a range of unprecedented \r\ntransnational challenges that require closer \r\ninternational cooperation than ever before. At this \r\nhistoric moment, the United Nations will have a greater \r\nresponsibility and role to play. \r\n Over the 60 years since the establishment of the \r\nUnited Nations, the dynamics of international relations \r\nhave been fundamentally and structurally transformed. \r\nTo meet the new demands of the times and address the \r\ndiverse challenges of the future, the United Nations \r\nshould constantly strive to renew and reinvent itself. In \r\nparticular, the Security Council should be reformed to \r\nbecome more democratic and accountable in order to \r\nfulfil its mandate of maintaining international peace \r\nand security. The Republic of Korea has been actively \r\nparticipating in discussions on Security Council \r\nreform. We will continue to contribute constructively \r\nto those discussions in the future. \r\n With the spirit of the Charter of the United \r\nNations always in our hearts, the Republic of Korea \r\nwill continue to actively cooperate with the \r\nOrganization to create a greater United Nations in \r\ntimes of change. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Korea for the statement he has just made. \r\n A/66/PV.11\r\n \r\n35 11-50692 \r\n \r\n Mr. Lee Myung-bak, President of the Republic of \r\nKorea, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nEquatorial Guinea. \r\n Mr. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, President \r\nof the Republic of Equatorial Guinea, was \r\nescorted into the General Assembly Hall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Teodoro Obiang Nguema \r\nMbasogo, President of the Republic of Equatorial \r\nGuinea, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Obiang Nguema Mbasogo (spoke in \r\nSpanish): I participate in this debate of the General \r\nAssembly in our dual position as President in Office of \r\nthe African Union and President of the Republic of \r\nEquatorial Guinea. I do so in the full conviction that \r\nthe passage of years and the experience accumulated in \r\nthe 66 years of the life of this world Organization will \r\ninspire the international community morally and united \r\nin social and political solidarity around universal \r\nnorms and principles in order to address any threat or \r\nsituation that may affect the planet. \r\n Mr. Boolell (Mauritius), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n With this conviction in mind, I should like to \r\ncongratulate His Excellency Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz \r\nAl-Nasser, Permanent Representative of Qatar, on his \r\nrecent election as President of the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-sixth session. He represents an ancient culture \r\nthat has contributed much to the development of \r\nhumankind, and hails from a peaceful country that \r\ndemonstrates solidarity and contributes to the \r\nmaintenance of peace, stability and development in the \r\nworld. We are certain, that under his leadership, the \r\nUnited Nations will be able to solve the serious \r\nproblems affecting our countries. \r\n We would also like to congratulate the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, on his \r\nre-election to the helm of this world Organization, in \r\nrecognition of the work that he has done over the past \r\nfive years despite the various political, economic and \r\nsocial crises that our planet has faced and is continuing \r\nto face. \r\n On the basis of that conviction, the United \r\nNations, given the current trend whereby it is being \r\nconverted into a club for the powerful, must \r\nreconfigure itself so that it can resume its place as the \r\nmost representative and equitable organization in the \r\nworld — one in which those whose problems it is \r\nendeavouring to resolve can participate and have their \r\nvoices heard. That would ensure the democratization of \r\nall of the organs of this universal institution. \r\n With respect to peace and security, Africa, which \r\nis witnessing various fratricidal conflicts caused, in \r\nmost cases, by internal and external factors and by \r\nthird parties, has firmly stated that it is in favour of the \r\npeaceful resolution of conflicts, wherever they may be \r\ntaking place, through dialogue, mediation and \r\nnegotiation. \r\n Africa, a continent whose countries and peoples \r\nhave been exploited for centuries by foreign Powers, \r\ntoday is experiencing a new iteration of \r\nneocolonialism, involving the intervention of forces on \r\nthe basis of humanitarian principles and democratic \r\nfreedoms. In this connection, Africa must bring to the \r\nfore its international political personality so that the \r\nAfrican Union is respected, moving beyond internal \r\ndifferences caused by unspoken interests. \r\n Intervention by force, internal or external, has \r\nnever provided a lasting solution to conflicts since the \r\ncreation of the United Nations, as has been seen in the \r\nvarious conflicts that have taken place in the past \r\n50 years. Unfortunately, we can see that the United \r\nNations is being used dishonestly, under the pretext of \r\nhumanitarian interventions, when in fact those \r\ninterventions have served only to further violate the \r\nhuman rights of the peoples affected. The use of force \r\nin a conflict is not a unifying factor but rather one of \r\ndivision and destruction.  \r\n The African Union recognizes the victory of the \r\nNational Transitional Council of Libya in its fight \r\nagainst totalitarianism and recommends that its \r\nGovernment undertake a programme of transition \r\naimed at the holding of free and transparent elections, \r\nensuring their legitimacy through the participation of \r\nall of the groups that constitute the community of \r\nLibyan people. \r\nA/66/PV.11  \r\n \r\n11-50692 36 \r\n \r\n With regard to the situation in Tunisia and Egypt, \r\nwe also call on their Governments to adopt the legal \r\nand administrative structures necessary for democratic \r\nprocesses and State institutions.  \r\n I should like to take this opportunity to \r\ncongratulate the State of South Sudan on its accession \r\nto membership of the United Nations and to express \r\nour wish that the peoples of the Sudan and of South \r\nSudan will live in peace and harmony with all of their \r\nneighbours and with the international community. \r\n Today’s world is suffering from an economic and \r\nfinancial crisis whose consequences are unpredictable. \r\nIt is the result of the irrationality of the current \r\npolitical, economic and social world order, which has \r\nmoved away from the social and humanitarian \r\nprinciples of equality, justice and fairness. \r\n In the political realm, we cannot transplant the \r\ncultural values of a country or a group of countries to \r\nothers simply because the world, and policies \r\nthemselves, are becoming increasingly globalized. \r\nRather, we must promote dialogue and coexistence \r\namong cultures and civilizations, because, if we do not \r\ndo so, the principle of the self-determination of peoples \r\nwill automatically disappear. \r\n It is true that democracy is a noble principle and \r\napplies to any cultural value that is practiced and \r\naccepted by peoples. To say otherwise would be to \r\nbetray the spirit of democracy that must develop in \r\nconsonance with the cultures of respective peoples. \r\n On the economic front, the social dimension of \r\npeoples must manifest in the form of productive \r\nactivities that benefit humankind. In that context, we \r\ncannot see any justification for the barriers, blockages \r\nand discrimination that we see in current economic, \r\nscientific and technical exchanges among nations, \r\nwhich only perpetuates the impoverishment of some \r\nand the ever-increasing enrichment of others. \r\n Indeed, the level of participation of the African \r\ncontinent in world markets is ridiculous, not even \r\ntopping 1 per cent despite its economic and human \r\npotential, which studies have described as representing \r\nthe future salvation of humankind. Africa calls on the \r\ndeveloped countries to show solidarity and help us to \r\ndevelop our economy so as to become an integral part \r\nof this planet.  \r\n Africa is not asking for a handout. Africa requires \r\na level of economic and technological support that \r\nwould enable it to process its vast resources, which, \r\nwhile contributing to accelerating its development, \r\nwould also have an effect on the economic stability of \r\nits partners. All of this requires profound changes in \r\nthe way in which we think about the current system \r\nand a readjustment of the methods and procedures used \r\nin international economic trade. \r\n The social order is determined by the political \r\nand economic order, but the political cannot develop \r\nproperly unless the economic does as well. In that \r\nrespect, Africa is making great efforts to develop its \r\nnational democracies, and many African States have \r\nadapted their political, legal and administrative \r\nstructures to the basic requirements of democracy. \r\n Nevertheless, in order to translate theory into \r\npractice, certain basic requirements must be met that \r\nmeet the material needs of humankind. Thus many \r\ncountries failed in this respect. Instead of their plans \r\ncoming to fruition, they became engulfed in fratricidal \r\nconflicts because they did not meet such basic needs.  \r\n Moreover, the African continent is facing, in \r\naddition to the economic crisis, the devastating effects \r\nof climate change, natural disasters, drought, famine \r\nand communicable diseases, which claim millions of \r\nvictims. In that respect, the African Union recently \r\norganized a donors conference to support victims in the \r\nHorn of Africa, with Somalia being one of the \r\ncountries most affected. The African Union has \r\nhonoured its commitment to tackle this emergency. \r\nHowever, the helping hand of the international \r\ncommunity is still needed. \r\n We believe that developed countries whose \r\nindustries are responsible for atmospheric warming \r\nshould meet their commitments under the Kyoto \r\nProtocol and compensate developing countries for the \r\ndamage and harm resulting from the effects of \r\natmospheric warming. \r\n The groups at greatest disadvantage in this crisis \r\nare women, children and young people. However, \r\nyoung people without physical, intellectual and moral \r\ndevelopment cannot take up the mantle from the \r\ncurrent generation to ensure the future of nations. \r\nHence there is a need to provide the necessary moral \r\nand material assistance to young people to ensure the \r\ndevelopment of the continent in the future. \r\n In that regard, the African Union Summit held in \r\nSipopo, Equatorial Guinea, adopted a programme for \r\n A/66/PV.11\r\n \r\n37 11-50692 \r\n \r\npromoting the employment of women and young \r\npeople and the fight against underemployment, as well \r\nas to provide professional and academic training. This \r\nprogramme needs the support of the international \r\ncommunity. \r\n In my own country, the Republic of Equatorial \r\nGuinea, we are committed to the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals set for 2015. During the national \r\neconomic conference held in 2009 to plan for the \r\nrational use of our oil resources and others, the \r\nGovernment adopted a national economic development \r\nprogramme, with the aim of ensuring that Equatorial \r\nGuinea joins the ranks of emerging economies by \r\n2020. \r\n In parallel to this programme, the Government is \r\ncarrying out political, legal and administrative reforms \r\nin order to optimize the development of democracy and \r\nensure control, transparency, good economic and \r\npolitical management and guarantee maximum respect \r\nfor human rights. \r\n The political environment in my country is \r\noptimal for promoting peace, stability and \r\nreconciliation among all political forces, who work \r\ntogether in harmony with a unified set of consensual \r\npolitical criteria. \r\n Finally, Equatorial Guinea is participating in \r\nthese discussions with a good measure of optimism, \r\nbased on our belief that, contrary to the selfishness that \r\nprevents many States from joining their efforts to \r\ntackle the problems facing our world, what we are \r\nseeing every day is a growing awareness and \r\ninternational moral determination that the United \r\nNations should be a veritable centre for the unity and \r\ncohesion of the international community. \r\n Indeed, while Africa was isolated in the past, \r\ntoday the groups of countries who trust in Africa, its \r\nStates and the contribution they can make to the global \r\ndevelopment continue to grow. We wish the sixty-sixth \r\nsession of the General Assembly every success. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President and Head of \r\nState of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, President \r\nand Head of State of the Republic of Equatorial \r\nGuinea, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.  \r\nAddress by His Majesty King Abdullah II Bin \r\nAl Hussein, Head of State of the Hashemite Kingdom \r\nof Jordan  \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will hear \r\nan address by the Head of State of the Hashemite \r\nKingdom of Jordan. \r\n His Majesty King Abdullah II Bin Al Hussein, \r\nHead of State of the Hashemite Kingdom of \r\nJordan, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Majesty King Abdullah II Bin Al Hussein, \r\nHead of State of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly.  \r\n King Abdullah: It is an honour to return once \r\nagain to this historic setting. May I warmly \r\ncongratulate His Excellency Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz \r\nAl-Nasser. Jordanians well remember his distinguished \r\ntenure as Qatar’s Ambassador to Jordan. I also express \r\nmy warm congratulations to the Secretary-General on \r\nhis election to a second term. \r\n This year, in my region and everywhere in the \r\nworld, leaders are being asked to listen and to act; to \r\nsolve today’s serious global crises in the economy, the \r\nenvironment, and peace; to uphold the equal dignity of \r\nall persons and, as provided for in the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, the equal rights of our nations; to \r\ncreate more inclusive political and economic life, \r\nespecially including young people; and to prove that \r\nglobal justice, by peaceful process of law, is more than \r\nwords: it is achievable, and achievable now. \r\n The challenge has come to my region, and \r\nhistoric transformations are under way. This year, we \r\nhave witnessed vast changes, both orderly transitions \r\nand tumultuous events with a high price in bloodshed \r\nand loss. But those of us who have welcomed and \r\nchampioned reform are hopeful. We believe that the \r\nArab Spring can be an opportunity to institutionalize \r\npositive change — change that is necessary for a \r\nstrong, secure and prosperous future. We can build on \r\nthe pioneering achievements of Arab-Islamic \r\ncivilization, with its core values of compassion, \r\nresponsibility, tolerance and respect for others. \r\n For my country, these opportunities are opening \r\nthe door to a major revitalization of our reform effort. \r\nWe want it to be an inclusive, national effort that can \r\nA/66/PV.11  \r\n \r\n11-50692 38 \r\n \r\nreach our goal of parliamentary Government. The \r\nirreversible democratic change we seek means more \r\nthan establishing new structures. It means embedding a \r\nway of life: the active responsibility of participating in \r\npolitical parties; creating political, economic and social \r\nplatforms; and working with others to realize the future \r\nour people need. It also means building reform right \r\ninto reform, including the rule of law, justice and the \r\nrights and freedoms of democratic political life. \r\n Early on, Jordan began a review of the \r\ncornerstone of our political life, the Constitution. \r\nParliament is currently putting the final touches on \r\namendments for ratification by both chambers. Among \r\nthese key provisions are an independent constitutional \r\ncourt and an independent elections commission. \r\n We in Jordan are also working with our partners \r\nto address another global danger, namely, the immense \r\nnegative impact of regional conflict. The central — the \r\nsingle greatest driver of division and instability — is \r\nthe Palestinian-Israeli conflict.  \r\n We are today at a dangerous impasse. The \r\nopportunities of a year ago to move talks forward to a \r\nclear-cut endgame failed to gain momentum. \r\nNegotiations have come to a halt. Frustrations are at a \r\npeak. Even as we speak, Israeli settlement activity is \r\nongoing, despite every ruling of international law and \r\nin the face of strong international protest.  \r\n We are seeing settlement activity in Jerusalem, \r\nalthough that is one of the key final status issues that \r\ncan only be resolved through negotiations. It is a global \r\nconcern. In my great-grandfather’s words, a sacred \r\nchain binds Muslims around the world to that holy city. \r\nI cannot overstate the crisis that would arise from harm \r\nto the holy sites of any faith or from efforts to \r\nannihilate the Arab character of East Jerusalem. \r\n A two-State solution that ends the conflict by \r\nmeeting the needs of both sides is, and can be, the only \r\nsecure and lasting peace. A solution comprised of two \r\nStates — a sovereign, independent and viable Palestine \r\nand Israel, accepted and secure — is the core of all \r\nmajor international proposals, including the Arab Peace \r\nInitiative.  \r\n All are agreed that negotiations must go forward, \r\nand soon, resolving the final status of all four key \r\nissues — borders, Jerusalem, refugees and settlements. \r\nOnly then will the conflict cease to be a flashpoint for \r\nglobal violence, and people on both sides will be able \r\nto get on with their future in peace. \r\n President Obama recognized that strategic \r\nimperative when he set the parameters for a solution on \r\n19 May. The Arabs viewed these parameters positively. \r\nIsrael built settlements. The Quartet, the European \r\nUnion, President Sarkozy and other representatives of \r\nthe international community have put workable ideas \r\non the table. The Arab States welcomed them. Israel \r\nbuilt settlements. That is where we find ourselves \r\ntoday.  \r\n We cannot teach the next generation respect for \r\nlaw and mutual acceptance if they see law and \r\ncompromise repeatedly fail. Yet we must uphold the \r\nlaw, or civilization falls. We cannot teach the value of \r\npeaceful process if peaceful process repeatedly fails. \r\nYet we must uphold peaceful process, or humankind is \r\nlost.  \r\n In this impasse, Jordan and the Arab States are \r\nholding fast to our principles of peace and law. We \r\nhave come here ─ to the house of nations ─ to seek the \r\njustice of nations. \r\n We will continue to strongly support the \r\ninalienable right of the Palestinian people to Statehood, \r\nin fulfilment of their aspirations, in accordance with \r\nUnited Nations resolutions and within a comprehensive \r\nand just settlement, including the resolution of all final \r\nstatus issues. It is their right to seek it here, in the \r\nhome of nations, the United Nations. That we must all \r\nsupport. \r\n We seek a new and vigorous international push, \r\nwith concrete steps toward the endgame. We seek not \r\nwords, not process, but a decisive end to conflict and a \r\nnew beginning in peace — the peace that comes from \r\nreal Statehood. We seek recognized rights for \r\nPalestinians — the rights that allow people to look \r\nforward in dignity and hope. We seek a peace that \r\nbrings real security for Israelis — who will put aside \r\ntheir fortress mentality and achieve acceptance in their \r\nneighbourhood and the world. \r\n Men and women everywhere share basic \r\nconcerns — a better life for themselves and their \r\nfamilies, security to plan for the future, a say in how \r\nsociety is organized and rights they can depend on. For \r\ntoo many, these hopes have been unanswered. But a \r\nnew era is beginning in my region, with new \r\n A/66/PV.11\r\n \r\n39 11-50692 \r\n \r\nopportunities to move forward in democracy, security \r\nand peace. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Head of State of the \r\nHashemite Kingdom of Jordan for the statement he has \r\njust made. \r\n His Majesty King Abdullah II Bin Al Hussein, \r\nHead of State of the Hashemite Kingdom of \r\nJordan, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Ms. Tarja Halonen, President of the \r\nRepublic of Finland \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nFinland. \r\n Ms. Halonen, President of the Republic of \r\nFinland, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations Her Excellency Ms. Tarja Halonen, President \r\nof the Republic of Finland, and to invite her to address \r\nthe Assembly. \r\n President Halonen: Let me start by \r\ncongratulating both the President and the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on their elections.  \r\n We live in an era of integration and \r\ninterconnection. No country can solve all the \r\nchallenges it faces on its own. Every country should be \r\npart of the solution. Common responses are needed \r\nmore than ever. Accordingly, the importance of the \r\nUnited Nations has grown.  \r\n The United Nations, or as I like to call it — the \r\nG-193 — has been a success story. The guiding \r\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter — peace and \r\nsecurity, human rights and development — have served \r\nus well for decades.  \r\n The Millennium Development Goals are more \r\nrecent examples of the global reach of the United \r\nNations. These Goals have inspired Governments to \r\nintroduce measures that are saving lives every single \r\nday.  \r\n The United Nations has also been at the forefront \r\nof support for the empowerment of women. The United \r\nNations Entity for Gender Equality and the \r\nEmpowerment of Women gives women and girls an \r\neven stronger and more unified voice. I have truly \r\nenjoyed hearing so many speakers today underlining \r\nthat important trend.  \r\n Globalization has contributed to substantial \r\neconomic growth. However, fruits of that growth have \r\nnot been equally distributed between and within \r\nnations. That is wrong, and it is not sustainable. It is \r\nour duty to provide a sustainable future for our planet \r\nand its people. Sustainability, in brief, is about a \r\nresilient planet that supports the needs of all people \r\nworldwide.  \r\n We, the world community, have accomplished a \r\nlot since we adopted the Millennium Declaration \r\n(resolution 55/2) and the Millennium Development \r\nGoals 11 years ago. Both of them have proved to be \r\neffective tools in the eradication of extreme poverty.  \r\n But the work must continue with enhanced \r\ndetermination. We must respect the interdependence of \r\nthe three dimensions of sustainable development — the \r\nsocial, economic and ecological. If even one of these \r\ndimensions is neglected, development cannot be \r\nsustainable.  \r\n Recent events in Northern Africa and the Middle \r\nEast have once again emphasized that development, \r\nhuman rights and peace and security are interlinked. \r\nEveryone must be able to enjoy civil and political as \r\nwell as economic, social and cultural rights. \r\n I am pleased to chair the High-level Panel on \r\nGlobal Sustainability together with President Zuma of \r\nSouth Africa. We will deliver our recommendations \r\ntowards the end of this year. The goal of the Panel is to \r\neradicate poverty and reduce inequality, make growth \r\ninclusive, and production and consumption more \r\nsustainable, while combating climate change and \r\nrespecting the range of other planetary boundaries. We \r\nare fully convinced that the eradication of poverty and \r\nsustainable development are interlinked and can be \r\nreached together. It is really one fight. \r\n The Panel is building bridges between economy, \r\necology and social justice. The empowerment of \r\nwomen and youth is vital for our goal. It is necessary \r\nto put into use all human resources for the development \r\nof our societies. \r\n We have not only discussed setting the goals but \r\nalso how to reach them. I believe that expanding \r\nA/66/PV.11  \r\n \r\n11-50692 40 \r\n \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) into \r\nsustainable development goals around the year 2015 \r\ncould help the world community to continue its fight \r\nagainst poverty and enhance sustainable development. \r\n In today’s world, there are far too many conflicts. \r\nAs they often take place within countries, they are \r\nespecially dangerous for civilians. These asymmetrical \r\nconflicts usually arise from injustice, violations of \r\nhuman rights and discrimination against minorities.  \r\n The President has chosen a very important theme \r\nfor the general debate, namely mediation. The peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes, conflict prevention and \r\nmediation are at the very heart of the United Nations. \r\nMediation has to be used at every stage of conflict. We \r\nneed to enhance the capabilities of the United Nations \r\nin this field. Training and guidance are pivotal. \r\nWomen’s participation and grass-roots activities and \r\nthe work of non-governmental organizations are also \r\nvital for our efforts if we want to win. \r\n On the initiative of Finland and Turkey, the \r\nGeneral Assembly unanimously adopted a resolution \r\non mediation in June of this year (resolution 65/283). \r\nAs has been mentioned today, this is the very first \r\nresolution on this theme in the history of the United \r\nNations. The resolution aims at strengthening the role \r\nof the United Nations in mediation. I would like to \r\nthank the Member States for their excellent support to \r\nthis process. Let us continue our common efforts also \r\nduring the sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly. \r\nWe are ready for that. \r\n Peace processes need to be more inclusive. I wish \r\nto stress the importance of the full and effective \r\nparticipation of women in all stages of peace processes. \r\nThe record is far from impressive at the moment, as the \r\nnumber of women around the negotiation tables \r\ncontinues to be strikingly low. I welcome the efforts by \r\nUN-Women to change the situation, and I call upon us \r\nall to make a commitment to involve more women in \r\nthis work. \r\n Finland, my own country, is a strong supporter of \r\nthe United Nations, in word and deed. We contribute \r\nmore than our share to peacekeeping, to development \r\naid and to the promotion of human rights around the \r\nworld. Finland wishes to continue to carry its \r\nresponsibilities, with the Assembly’s support, in the \r\nSecurity Council for the term 2013-2014. Our \r\ncommitment, our capacity to serve on the Council and \r\nour record speak for us. \r\n Finland warmly welcomes the Republic of South \r\nSudan as the 193rd Member State of the United \r\nNations. The implementation of the Comprehensive \r\nPeace Agreement has been a testimony to the \r\nimportance of mediation and regional leadership. I \r\ncommend the efforts of President Mbeki and his Panel \r\nto find solutions to outstanding issues between the \r\nSudan and South Sudan. \r\n The dramatic and rapidly evolving situation in the \r\nArab world has been at the centre of the attention of \r\nthe international community. Women and men have \r\nmarched together for a better future. It is important that \r\nthey continue to participate side by side in also \r\nbuilding a democratic society. Democracy cannot be \r\nachieved without full participation of women too. \r\n As we welcome the new Libya into the world \r\ncommunity, Finland commends the National \r\nTransitional Council for underlining the need to \r\ncontinue building a sense of national unity, \r\nreconciliation and an inclusive political system with \r\nrespect for equal civil rights and freedom of \r\nexpression. Finland gives its full support to the \r\ntransition, reflecting the aspirations of Libyan people. \r\nWe are ready to support the building of democratic \r\nsociety based on the rule of law and respect for human \r\nrights, including the fulfilment of the human rights of \r\nwomen. The United Nations should play a central role \r\nin coordinating the international community’s \r\ncontribution. We very much welcome the United \r\nNations Support Mission in Libya. \r\n Reaching a solution to the Middle East conflict is \r\nmore pressing than ever. The Palestinians have a right \r\nto their own State, Palestine. The international \r\ncommunity gathered here in the General Assembly \r\nmust show that it is united in its message to the parties. \r\nWe need the urgent resumption of negotiations that will \r\nlead, within an agreed on time frame, to a two-State \r\nsolution, with the State of Israel and an independent, \r\ndemocratic, contiguous and viable State of Palestine \r\nliving side by side in peace and security. There is no \r\ntime to waste. \r\n I have had an opportunity to lead Finland’s \r\ndelegation to the General Assembly since 1995. We \r\nhave witnessed a remarkable widening of our common \r\nglobal agenda. Today’s decisions will affect not only us \r\nbut also future generations. Change is necessary for the \r\nsurvival of humankind. I am confident that the United \r\n A/66/PV.11\r\n \r\n41 11-50692 \r\n \r\nNations is the sole universal forum to respond to the \r\nchallenges that the world is facing. \r\n I wish those gathered here all the best for the \r\nfuture.  \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Finland for the statement she has just made. \r\n Ms. Tarja Halonen, President of the Republic of \r\nFinland, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Juan Manuel Santos Calderón, President \r\nof the Republic of Colombia \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nColombia. \r\n Mr. Juan Manuel Santos Calderón, President of \r\nthe Republic of Colombia, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Juan Manuel Santos \r\nCalderón, President of the Republic of Colombia, and \r\nto invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Santos Calderón (spoke in Spanish): \r\nDuring the past year we have witnessed events and \r\npopular uprisings that are changing the face of the \r\nplanet, both politically and economically. As President \r\nof a country that firmly believes in multilateralism, I \r\ncome to the General Assembly today to emphasize how \r\nimportant it is for the United Nations to assume the \r\nfundamental role that belongs to it in the face of such \r\ncrises. Crises in and of themselves are neither good nor \r\nbad; their results depend on how we manage them. \r\nThey can often become genuine opportunities.  \r\n The political transformations we are seeing in \r\nNorth Africa and in the Middle East, for example, if \r\nthey lead to a strengthening of democracy and the rule \r\nof law in the affected countries, can be a factor in \r\nglobal stability. What the peoples request, what the \r\npeoples seek, is freedom, respect for their rights, the \r\nability to choose their leaders and democracy. The duty \r\nof the international community is to support them. If \r\nwe do not, if we turn our back on them, we may see a \r\nprotracted period of civil wars and conflict, which we \r\nshould avoid at all cost. \r\n Therefore, we must commit ourselves to \r\nstrengthening and applying the methods of peaceful \r\nconflict resolution described in Chapter VI of the \r\nUnited Nations Charter. The more efficient we are in \r\nthe use of preventive diplomacy, the less need there \r\nwill be for intervention.  \r\n We should advocate effective mediation with \r\nconviction, mediation that does not seek the leading \r\nrole but one that is given the time and tools required to \r\nestablish trust and to reach solutions that are \r\nadvantageous to all parties. \r\n I am pleased to be able to affirm today that \r\nColombia does not just believe in mediation and \r\npeaceful solutions; we have successfully put them into \r\npractice. My Government succeeded in normalizing \r\nrelations with two countries: Venezuela and Ecuador. \r\nWe did this on the basis of conciliation and respectful, \r\ndirect dialogue. \r\n The former President of Argentina, Mr. Néstor \r\nKirchner, then Secretary General of the Union of South \r\nAmerican Nations, lent his good offices to the \r\nrapprochement between Venezuela and Colombia. His \r\nmanagement was extremely effective, a great legacy he \r\nleft to our region. \r\n In Latin America we have learned that \r\nGovernments and States may have differing, even at \r\ntimes opposing, political concepts, but that this does \r\nnot mean they cannot live together and cooperate in \r\npeace. We have also made important contributions to \r\nthe search for dialogue, negotiation and mediation in \r\nour region. Honduras is an example of that effort. \r\nVenezuela and Colombia joined forces to support the \r\nHonduran parties in their reconciliation through \r\ndialogue and rebuilding trust. This succeeded in \r\nbringing Honduras back into the Union of South \r\nAmerican Nations. \r\n What I have said so far can also be applied to \r\nlong-standing conflicts, such as that between Israel and \r\nPalestine. Advances can be achieved if, and only if, \r\ndirect dialogue and effective mediation are employed. \r\nAlong with the rest of the international community, we \r\nare concerned by the suspension of peace negotiations, \r\nand we urge — in fact, we implore — both parties to \r\nreturn to the negotiating table as soon as possible. That \r\nis the only — I repeat, the only — path that leads to \r\nwhat we all wish to see: two States living in peace and \r\nsecurity. \r\nA/66/PV.11  \r\n \r\n11-50692 42 \r\n \r\n On a positive note, we can offer as an example of \r\nappropriate cooperation and negotiation the efforts that \r\nled to the creation of the Republic of South Sudan, the \r\nmost recent Member of the United Nations, to which \r\nwe give the most effusive welcome. \r\n As a current member of the Security Council, \r\nColombia has brought to the agenda the situation of \r\nHaiti, a country struck by natural phenomena and \r\naffected by unacceptable poverty. The solution there \r\nmust remain a priority for all of us. Peace in Haiti will \r\nbe the fruit not just of peacekeeping operations, but of \r\nthe empowerment of Haitians themselves in handling \r\ntheir own problems and solutions, with sufficient \r\ninternational support for their economic and social \r\ndevelopment. \r\n By virtue of its place as the country with the \r\ngreatest biodiversity per square kilometre in the world, \r\nwhich makes it highly vulnerable, Colombia is \r\ncommitted to measures that mitigate the effects of \r\nclimate change and enable us to adapt to them. \r\n We are participating in the preparations for the \r\nupcoming United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, Rio+20, which will take place in July \r\n2012, with a proposal we have been developing in \r\nconsultation with other countries. We believe that one \r\nof the main results of Rio+20 should be the \r\nestablishment of a set of sustainable development goals \r\nbased on the agenda that was approved in the first \r\nconference and echoing the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. \r\n The guiding principles were established in Rio in \r\n1992, and an implementation plan was agreed on in \r\nJohannesburg in 2002. Today, 20 years later, we need \r\nto define a set of goals that allow us to measure \r\nachievements, identify shortcomings and determine the \r\nopportunities for advancement. The planet and its \r\nfuture demand that we work with goals, with specific \r\nindicators of results that ensure the efficacy of our \r\nefforts. \r\n A year ago I said that thanks to advances in \r\neconomic and social security, Colombia was at the \r\nthreshold of a new dawn. Today I can state with \r\nrealism and well-founded optimism that the first rays \r\nof that new dawn are beginning to warm us and light \r\nour way. \r\n My Government is one of national unity, in which \r\nthe main political parties have converged around the \r\nfundamental objectives of the nation. This unity has \r\nafforded us a significant measure of governability and \r\nhas enabled us to have historic laws and reforms \r\napproved in our Congress that will help us to have a \r\nmore prosperous and safer nation, one that is more \r\nequitable and more egalitarian. \r\n Among the initiatives that have been approved, I \r\nwish to point to a law concerning victims and the \r\nreturn of land that guarantees that the State and society \r\nwork to make reparations and to return stolen lands to \r\nhundreds of thousands of farmers affected by the \r\nviolence of the past several decades. We are paying a \r\nmoral debt to the victims. This is the first time in the \r\nhistory of the world that this is happening before the \r\nend of an internal armed conflict. We have decided that \r\njustice, truth and reparations must not have to wait.  \r\n It is worth pointing out that Secretary-General \r\nBan-Ki Moon joined us in Bogotá the day that law was \r\npassed. He emphasized the advance it represented and \r\noffered the assistance of the United Nations in ensuring \r\nits proper application.  \r\n Also thanks to the governability guaranteed by \r\nour new national unity, we were able to establish a \r\nmore equitable distribution of resources originating \r\nfrom oil and mining to ensure that they reach our \r\nneediest population and regions. \r\n In addition, at this time of global financial and \r\neconomic volatility, we have introduced into our \r\nConstitution the element of fiscal sustainability, and \r\nhave enacted a law to ensure that the State maintains \r\ndiscipline in its management of public finances. Such \r\nresponsible initiatives have increased investor \r\nconfidence, had a positive impact on our country’s risk \r\nrating and will lead to a more stable economic future in \r\nwhich we believe we will be able to focus on reducing \r\nunemployment and poverty, my Government’s two \r\nmain priorities. \r\n Colombia, to a degree unlike any other country in \r\nthe world, has had to deal with the global drug \r\nproblem. We have had much success, but a great many \r\nchallenges remain. We know how terrorists benefit \r\nfrom drug-trafficking, and there can be no doubt that \r\ndrugs and terrorism threaten democracies and the rule \r\nof law. Colombia will continue to combat these \r\nscourges, because for us they represent a national \r\nsecurity problem. We are actively cooperating in the \r\nregion, and will continue to do so, to combat \r\ntransnational crime. We can only succeed if we \r\n A/66/PV.11\r\n \r\n43 11-50692 \r\n \r\ncooperate and work together in this struggle, which \r\naffects every country equally. \r\n A year ago, from this rostrum (see A/65/PV.15), I \r\nsaid that we should call the decade that was then just \r\nbeginning the decade of Latin America and the \r\nCaribbean. I reaffirm that prediction now. Our region is \r\nan area of political and economic stability that is firmly \r\ndetermined to move forward with social policy. We \r\nhave both the capability and the willingness to provide \r\nthe world with solutions in the areas of the \r\nenvironment, water, energy, food and labour. But our \r\nregion cannot grow or progress in isolation. We want to \r\nadvance hand in hand with the world, sharing the \r\nprinciples of respect and tolerance. We welcome \r\nprogress in prosperity wherever it occurs in the world. \r\n That is why I would like to conclude by calling \r\non the nations of the world and on the Organization \r\nthat brings us together here to continue to work \r\ntogether to make use of the peaceful means at our \r\ndisposal, with a new goal: to turn the crises we are \r\nexperiencing today into opportunities for a better \r\ntomorrow. The future, as has always been the case, \r\ndepends on us. With determination and positive \r\nleadership, we can convert these storms into winds \r\nfavourable to the whole of humankind. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of Colombia \r\nfor the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Juan Manuel Santos Calderón, President of \r\nthe Republic of Colombia, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, President \r\nand Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the \r\nFederal Republic of Nigeria \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President and Commander-in-\r\nChief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of \r\nNigeria. \r\n His Excellency Mr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, \r\nPresident and Commander-in-Chief of the \r\nFederal Republic of Nigeria, was escorted into \r\nthe General Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, \r\nPresident and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed \r\nForces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly. \r\n President Jonathan: On behalf of the \r\nGovernment and people of Nigeria, I would like to \r\ncongratulate the President on his election as the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth \r\nsession. I have no doubt that under his able leadership \r\nthe work of the session will be brought to a successful \r\nconclusion. I should also like to acknowledge the \r\nexcellent work done by his predecessor, His Excellency \r\nMr. Joseph Deiss, who guided the affairs of the sixty-\r\nfifth session with consummate skill and commitment. \r\n I must also take this opportunity to extend my \r\nwarmest felicitations to Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon on his well-deserved re-election, a tribute to \r\nhis leadership and vision. He deserves our appreciation \r\nfor the good work he is doing on our behalf. \r\n I also welcome the newest member of the \r\nOrganization, the Republic of South Sudan. I am \r\nconfident that South Sudan will bring a unique \r\nperspective to the work of the United Nations and \r\nenrich our collective experience. \r\n Despite our initial optimism, the peace dividend \r\nwe had hoped would accrue following the end of the \r\nCold War is yet to materialize. On the contrary, the \r\nworld of the twenty-first century in which we live is \r\nbecoming ever more precarious, unpredictable and \r\ncertainly more dangerous — perhaps more than at any \r\nother time in history. The increasing use of terror in \r\nvarious regions of the world as a form of political \r\naction poses a serious threat to international peace and \r\nsecurity. We must win the war against terror because it \r\ninfringes on the fundamental right of all peoples to life \r\nand to live in safety from fear. \r\n Over the past few months, we in Nigeria have \r\nfaced an upsurge in terrorist attacks in parts of our \r\ncountry. Only recently, the United Nations building in \r\nAbuja housing several United Nations agencies was the \r\ntarget of an atrocious terrorist attack that left several \r\ndead. On behalf of the Government and people of \r\nNigeria, I would like to convey my sincere \r\ncondolences to the families of the victims and to the \r\nentire United Nations family for this barbaric and \r\nheinous attack on those who have dedicated their lives \r\nto helping others. As the United States and the rest of \r\nthe world commemorate the tenth anniversary of the \r\nattacks of 9/11, we are reminded of the international \r\nA/66/PV.11  \r\n \r\n11-50692 44 \r\n \r\ndimension of terrorism and the imperative of a \r\nconcerted global response to combat this scourge. \r\n For us in Nigeria, terrorist acts, rather than \r\nintimidating us, will only help to strengthen our \r\nresolve to develop appropriate national strategies and \r\nto collaborate even more closely with the international \r\ncommunity in the fight against this menace. As part of \r\nNigeria’s efforts to fight terrorism, on 3 June, I signed \r\ninto law a terrorism bill and an anti-money-laundering \r\nprohibition amendment act. The new laws not only \r\noutline measures for preventing and combating acts of \r\nterrorism, but also prohibit the financing of terrorism \r\nand laundering of the proceeds of crime. Nigeria will \r\ncontinue to work with the United Nations and other \r\npartners in this global fight. \r\n To that end, Nigeria is working closely with the \r\nCounter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force and the \r\nCounter-Terrorism Executive Directorate, as well as \r\nwith relevant international bodies and friendly \r\ncountries, in order to sharpen our response \r\nmechanisms. In that connection, the Counter-Terrorism \r\nImplementation Task Force will launch its first project \r\nin Abuja in November, which will be aimed at \r\npreventing conflict and countering the appeal of \r\nterrorism to youth through education and dialogue. In \r\naddition, Nigeria is a member of a new global body, the \r\nGlobal Counterterrorism Forum, launched to galvanize \r\nand help pull our efforts together to fight this scourge \r\nin all its ramifications. We pledge to continue to work \r\nwith all stakeholders as we enlarge and intensify our \r\npartnerships. \r\n When I stood before the Assembly last year, I \r\nmade a solemn pledge that Nigeria would conduct free \r\nand credible elections in the second quarter of this \r\nyear. I am glad to report that last April we indeed \r\nconducted what have been adjudged to be credible and \r\ntransparent general elections. Let me take this \r\nopportunity to thank the United Nations and all the \r\nother organizations, nations and individuals that helped \r\nus to achieve that feat. The elections are now behind \r\nus, and the Government that I head is well on course to \r\nimplement our programmes of transformation — a \r\nstrategic plan for the delivery of the dividends of \r\ndemocracy to citizens and for preparing our country for \r\nthe challenges of the future. Indeed, all across my \r\ncountry, there is a renewed sense of optimism and self-\r\nbelief in our ability to recreate a new Nigeria on the \r\nprinciples of personal freedoms, democracy, good \r\ngovernance and the rule of law. \r\n Permit me to identify with the theme of this \r\nyear’s debate of engaging the role of mediation in the \r\npeaceful resolution of conflicts in the world. The \r\nAssembly will recall that Nigeria was in the forefront \r\nof the campaign to promote this theme when, as the \r\nPresident of the Security Council in July 2010, my \r\ncountry adopted the use of preventive diplomacy to \r\nresolve armed conflicts across the world. This theme is \r\napt and could not have come at a better time, when \r\narmed conflicts are increasingly taking a greater part of \r\nthe time and resources of the United Nations. \r\n For too long, the international community has \r\nfocused too little attention on mediation and preventive \r\ndiplomacy, and far too much effort and resources on \r\nthe military aspects of peace and security. Yet measures \r\nto address the root cause of conflict, including dialogue \r\nand mediation, can be far more effective as a means for \r\nachieving sustainable peace and stability. \r\n I believe that cultivating peace and fulfilling the \r\naims of Chapter VI of the United Nations Charter \r\nrequire early identification and appropriate \r\nintervention in conflict situations in order to build \r\nconfidence and trust and to preclude the eruption of \r\nviolence between opposing parties. As I see it, our goal \r\nshould always be to present the peaceful alternative as \r\na less costly and effective way of achieving political \r\nand social objectives. I also believe that, in addition to \r\nother traditional tools of preventive diplomacy, \r\ndemocracy and good governance can be particularly \r\nimportant in building a just, equitable and inclusive \r\nsociety. By focusing on mediation as a tool for conflict \r\nprevention, we are able to address the real triggers of \r\nconflict, without which we cannot achieve sustainable \r\nsolutions. \r\n However, for the world to move from a culture of \r\nresponse after conflict to that of a culture of \r\nprevention, the international community must muster \r\nthe political will to promote preventive diplomacy, in \r\nparticular through mediation. This will necessarily \r\nentail rededicating greater human and financial \r\nresources to institutions and mechanisms that already \r\nexist, within and outside the United Nations system, \r\nfor conflict prevention and resolution. \r\n Going forward, I would like to propose the \r\nestablishment, under the Secretary-General’s Office, of \r\na conflict mediation commission, to be charged, among \r\nother things, with collating information on conflict \r\nsituations across the world, identifying the dramatis \r\n A/66/PV.11\r\n \r\n45 11-50692 \r\n \r\npersonae and developing appropriate strategies for \r\ninitiating the resolution of such conflicts. The \r\ncommission would also develop rules of engagement, \r\nincluding sanctions that would apply to those who may \r\nobstruct efforts to resolve conflicts peacefully. \r\n This naturally brings me to the issue of \r\ntrafficking in small arms and light weapons. If the idea \r\nof resolving conflicts through mediation is to succeed, \r\nthen the problem of trafficking in small arms and light \r\nweapons must be frontally tackled. The proliferation of \r\nsmall arms and light weapons is particularly \r\nworrisome, due to their easy accessibility and \r\navailability to unauthorized persons and groups, who in \r\nturn have used these arms to create instability and \r\ninsecurity in most of the countries of the developing \r\nworld. Even worse, the proliferation of these weapons \r\nhas proved handy in the hands of terrorists. \r\n This explains our commitment to, and \r\npreoccupation with, the actualization of an arms trade \r\ntreaty that robustly addresses the illicit trade in small \r\narms and light weapons, which, as we all know, are \r\namong the major causes of destabilization and conflict \r\nin Africa. The danger of the proliferation of, and illicit \r\ntrade in, small arms and light weapons informed \r\nNigeria’s decision to sponsor resolution 61/89, of 2006, \r\nthe principal objective being to provide a legally \r\nbinding international instrument for the trade in \r\nconventional arms. We will continue to support all \r\ninitiatives towards the realization of an arms trade \r\ntreaty in 2012. I call on all Member States to join in \r\nthis endeavour. \r\n The increasing rate of piracy and other maritime \r\ncrimes, with their attendant damaging effects on \r\nsecurity, trade and economic activities in the Gulf of \r\nGuinea and other locations, calls for coordinated \r\nregional and global approaches. In this respect, I would \r\nlike to express support for the proposal of the \r\nSecretary-General to deploy a United Nations \r\nassessment mission to study the situation in the Gulf of \r\nGuinea and explore possible options for United \r\nNations support and action. Our expectation is that a \r\npositive outcome from such a strategy will benefit not \r\nonly our subregion but the larger international \r\ncommunity as well. I am already consulting with other \r\nleaders in our subregion to boost this initiative. \r\n The United Nations strategy for gender equality \r\nand women’s empowerment, especially through the \r\ncreation of UN-Women, deserves commendation and \r\nsupport. Nigeria’s support for UN-Women, to which \r\nwe have made substantial contributions, reflects our \r\ndesire to harness the potential of women in the task of \r\nnation-building. \r\n Our national action plan on gender equality and \r\nwomen’s empowerment places strong emphasis on \r\nwomen’s effective participation in politics and \r\nadequate representation in public office. I am indeed \r\nproud to announce to the Assembly that more than \r\n30 per cent of my Cabinet is made up of women. Let \r\nme also commend the Executive Board of UN-Women \r\non the successful take-off of the entity. UN-Women can \r\nbe assured of Nigeria’s strong support. \r\n This year, the prevention of non-communicable \r\ndiseases was one of the issues slated for discussion at a \r\nHigh-level Meeting. Only three months ago, I attended \r\nthe High-level Meeting on AIDS, where I pledged \r\nNigeria’s commitment to health care, as part of our \r\ncountry’s human capital development agenda. My \r\nGovernment is intensifying efforts to improve national \r\nhealth-care delivery by allocating substantial resources \r\nto primary health care. We look forward to a \r\nproductive outcome to the High-level Meeting on the \r\nPrevention and Control of Non-communicable \r\nDiseases at the end of that meeting.  \r\n In the same vein, I welcome discussions at the \r\nHigh-level Meeting on desertification and land \r\ndegradation, as these issues continue to pose \r\nchallenges to our development efforts. That is why \r\nNigeria strongly supports the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change and the \r\nConvention on Biological Diversity, including \r\nstrategies and best practices to address this challenge. \r\n In order to demonstrate our commitment to \r\nhuman rights, Nigeria recently ratified the Convention \r\non the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and acceded \r\nto four other international human rights instruments, \r\nincluding the Optional Protocol to the Convention \r\nagainst Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading \r\nTreatment or Punishment.  \r\n In addition, this year, my Government passed into \r\nlaw the National Human Rights Commission \r\nAmendment Act, the Legal Aid Council Amendment \r\nAct and the Freedom of Information Act. Nigeria will \r\ncontinue to accord the highest priority to human rights \r\nissues, as they speak directly to the dignity and \r\ninalienable rights of humankind. \r\nA/66/PV.11  \r\n \r\n11-50692 46 \r\n \r\n We in West Africa are passing through an exciting \r\nseason of democratic rebirth. Before the end of 2011, \r\nelections will have been held in six countries in West \r\nAfrica. Those elections will set the respective countries \r\nalong the path of political stability, progress, good \r\ngovernance and sustainable development — some of \r\nthe benefits of which we have begun to experience. \r\nThe progress we have made would not have been \r\npossible without the support of the United Nations. \r\n The resolution of the conflict in Côte d’Ivoire is a \r\ncase in point. I consider the inauguration of President \r\nOuattara a success not just for Côte d’Ivoire but also \r\nfor the international community, which spoke with one \r\nvoice and acted in concert in support of the Ivorian \r\npeople. The end of that crisis must be seen by all as the \r\nbeginning of our journey towards the consolidation of \r\ndemocratic culture and good governance in Africa. \r\nHaving put that crisis behind us, the international \r\ncommunity must now provide robust assistance to the \r\ncountry as it embarks on the tasks of post-conflict \r\nreconstruction and national reconciliation. \r\n The struggle for self-governance and majority \r\nrule in Africa started in the 1940s; and by 1957 Ghana \r\nhad gained independence. Today, all African States \r\nhave achieved self-determination and majority rule. \r\nThose are no small achievements. But we still have \r\nmuch work to do. A great deal of the work that remains \r\nis to build viable and capable States in Africa on the \r\nprinciples of popular participation, the rule of law and \r\nrespect for human rights, as we pledged to do in the \r\nConstitutive Act of the African Union. Nigeria believes \r\nthat those values must remain at the core of governance \r\nin Africa if we are ever to achieve the goals of stability, \r\nsecurity and development. \r\n As Nigeria is approaching the end of its tenure on \r\nthe Security Council, I would like to express my \r\ncountry’s deep appreciation for the opportunity to serve \r\nin that important organ. In the course of our \r\nstewardship, the Council had the courage to reach \r\nmany difficult decisions that resulted in positive \r\ndevelopments around the world. We are proud to be \r\nassociated with those decisions. I would like to urge \r\nthe Council to continue its important work in the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.  \r\n In spite of the Council’s many successes, it is our \r\nbelief that that important organ would benefit from the \r\nvigour and fresh perspectives that only a revamped \r\nCouncil accommodating changing global political \r\nrealities can provide. I urge the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly to set up clear criteria for the reform \r\nof the Security Council in line with the demand of the \r\nmajority of the world. A reformed Security Council is \r\nthe only way to demonstrate that all nations have an \r\nequal stake in the United Nations. Nigeria looks \r\nforward to the prospect of membership in a reformed \r\nSecurity Council. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President and \r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the \r\nFederal Republic of Nigeria for the statement he has \r\njust made. \r\n Mr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, President and \r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the \r\nFederal Republic of Nigeria, was escorted from \r\nthe General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Toomas Hendrik Ilves, President \r\nof Estonia \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The General Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the \r\nRepublic of Estonia. \r\n Mr. Toomas Hendrik Ilves, President of the \r\nRepublic of Estonia, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Toomas Hendrik Ilves, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Estonia, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly. \r\n President Ilves: I would first of all like to \r\ncongratulate Ambassador Al-Nasser on assuming the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly.  \r\n The twentieth anniversary this year of the \r\nrestoration of Estonia’s independence, not surprisingly, \r\ncoincides with our twentieth year of membership in the \r\nUnited Nations and our participation in the General \r\nAssembly. Given where we were then, in 1991 — a \r\npoor and beleaguered country, brutalized by a half-\r\ncentury of thuggish Soviet, then Nazi, and then again \r\nSoviet occupation — our transformation in one \r\ngeneration to a modern, technologically cutting-edge \r\nEuropean democracy is a testament to what a \r\ncommitted people can do. It is, as well, a challenge to \r\nthose who find excuses for not implementing \r\n A/66/PV.11\r\n \r\n47 11-50692 \r\n \r\ndemocracy, for not eliminating corruption and for \r\ncontinuing to brutalize their citizens. \r\n Today, 20 years after the bumbling coup and \r\nensuing crumbling of that rusty edifice of \r\ntotalitarianism, the Soviet Union, we again smell in the \r\nair the hope of liberty and democracy — this time in \r\nthe Middle East and North Africa. Again people have \r\ncome together and said, “Enough!” — of the lies, the \r\ncorruption and the 3 a.m. knock on the door by the \r\ndull-brained goons of the secret police. People want to \r\nbe able to speak their minds and to run their own lives, \r\nfree of harassment, or worse, by the authorities. In a \r\nword, people want democracy. They want, too, the \r\nfoundations of democracy: respect for human rights, \r\nthe rule of law and the freedom of speech and \r\nassembly. \r\n With those hopes in the hearts of so many people \r\nin this year of otherwise dismal and tawdry news, \r\nEstonia welcomes — indeed wholeheartedly \r\nencourages — the United Nations to move forward on \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s decision to focus \r\nduring his second term on democracy and human \r\nrights. Estonia welcomes that decision because, \r\nfrankly, the results of the democracy movements of a \r\ngeneration ago have not even come close to what we \r\nhoped for at the time. Most of the people who lived \r\nunder undemocratic rule two decades ago continue to \r\ndo so today. Of what was the Soviet Union then, only \r\nEstonia, Latvia and Lithuania have earned the \r\ndesignation “free” in Freedom House’s annual report \r\ncard on the rule of law, respect for fundamental \r\nfreedoms and free and fair elections. That, I submit, is \r\na poor result. \r\n Each country and each situation is of course \r\ndifferent. No textbook rules can tell us how to make \r\ndemocracy work or how to build a prosperous society. \r\nA few basic tenets and lessons, however, hold across \r\nnations, experiences and cultures. The United Nations \r\nown Universal Declaration of Human Rights — a \r\ndocument everyone here is obliged to adhere to — \r\nafter all, is based on the premise of common truths held \r\nby all. \r\n Democracy, as I said, is not only about voting and \r\nfree and fair elections, vital though they are for any \r\nfree and democratic society. Respect for human rights \r\nand the rule of law constitute the cornerstones of an \r\nopen society. If one cannot speak their mind or be \r\nguaranteed a fair trial if arrested, it matters little that \r\nthey can go to the polling booth. Rights and freedoms \r\nbelong to each and every person. They are not the \r\nprivilege of a select few with the money, the guns or \r\nthe power. \r\n For Estonia, it is of fundamental importance that \r\nthe North African and Middle Eastern revolutions have \r\nbeen popular reactions to sustained violations of \r\nhuman rights, corruption and injustice. The revolutions \r\nconfirm the universal aspiration to realize one’s human \r\nrights. They show once again, as throughout history, \r\nthat people naturally want to be free from fear and \r\nrepression. Notice I said people, not “men”. As long \r\nago as 2,500 years ago, Aristotle noted that where “the \r\nstate of women is bad, almost half of human life is \r\nspoilt”. This is no less true today and will remain so. \r\nThe ongoing revolutions could not have occurred and \r\ncannot succeed without women.  \r\n It is a profound source of concern to Estonia to \r\nnotice that, while women are welcome to protest \r\nagainst corrupt regimes, they are not always welcome \r\nto participate in the political process. Estonia therefore \r\nplaces great hopes on the United Nations new gender \r\nentity, UN-Women, and will continue to insist that the \r\nUnited Nations as a whole do its part globally by \r\nstanding up for women’s rights. We also expect that \r\nUN-Women will play an active role in helping to take \r\nthe principles of Security Council resolution 1325 \r\n(2000) on women and peace and security from paper to \r\nreality. \r\n For as long as we have lived as a free nation, \r\nEstonia has always protected and promoted human \r\nrights and fundamental freedoms at home and abroad. \r\nOur candidature to the Human Rights Council is a \r\nlogical consequence of our work, but it is certainly not \r\nthe culmination as we continue to live up to our \r\nnational and international obligations. \r\n Once again, ongoing events underline the need \r\nfor us to focus on the protection of civilians from \r\natrocities. Even in the democratic part of my continent, \r\nthe political project we today call the European Union \r\nwas a reaction to mass murder and war. The very \r\nhistory of Europe motivates us to take preventive steps \r\nto avoid any repetition of such crimes. Therefore, it is \r\nvital that we develop common practices and the \r\ncapacity to implement the principle of the \r\nresponsibility to protect. Protecting civilians from \r\natrocities, dear colleagues, is not just about protection. \r\nA/66/PV.11  \r\n \r\n11-50692 48 \r\n \r\nIt also means bringing the perpetrators of crimes and \r\natrocities against civilians to justice.  \r\n International law, in particular the International \r\nCriminal Court, and the understanding that justice will \r\nbe done, no matter how long it takes, are the tools we \r\npossess to prevent the worst human rights violations. \r\nThe rule of law and respect for international law are \r\nwhat will help ravaged and victimized societies to \r\nregain their dignity and rebuild their communities. The \r\ncommon efforts of the international community, the \r\nInternational Criminal Court and its States parties \r\nremain a priority for my country. \r\n While focusing on the pertinent issues of the \r\npresent, we must not shy away from addressing the \r\nunresolved issues of the recent past. Afghanistan is one \r\nof those. Establishing lasting security there remains a \r\nkey objective for Estonia. To reach that objective, we \r\nmust focus on assisting Afghan efforts to further \r\ndevelop good governance and the rule of law. Along \r\nwith human rights, these are the crucial elements of a \r\nsustainable society. We believe that we must all remain \r\ncommitted as long as is necessary to reach this goal. To \r\nthat end, Estonia will continue to support the access of \r\nAfghans, in particular women and children, to health \r\ncare and education through its development \r\ncooperation projects. \r\n Georgia is another country that continues to \r\nrequire our attention. The 2008 war ended with the \r\nviolation of Georgian territorial integrity, which is a \r\nfundamental violation of international law that remains \r\nunresolved to this day. The fundamental principles of \r\ninternational law must be followed by all members of \r\nthe international community and not just the small, \r\nwho have no other recourse. Additionally, we should \r\ncontinue to support the Geneva talks. The United \r\nNations involvement is of the utmost importance and \r\nmust continue in the future. \r\n Here today in the United Nations, our attention is \r\nalso focused on Israel and Palestine. A viable two-State \r\nsolution must take into consideration the legitimate \r\nconcerns of both sides for their well-being, safety and \r\nprosperity. \r\n Another security- and human rights-related topic \r\nis the Internet, especially these days, when it has come \r\nto play such an important role in democratization by \r\nenabling political discussion and mobilizing popular \r\nmovements. The Internet has grown beyond all \r\nexpectations since people began to use it regularly \r\nsome 20 years ago. Its global, ipso facto cross-border \r\nnature allows users the world over to access \r\ninformation and ideas, to communicate with each other \r\nand to learn. Estonia firmly believes that States should \r\nensure that their people can freely seek, receive and \r\nimpart information and ideas and have access to the \r\nInternet. In fact, Estonia believes that, in this \r\ntechnological age, unimpeded access to the Internet is a \r\nhuman right. \r\n A transparent Government and administration, a \r\nliberal economic environment and a strong educational \r\nsystem all have contributed to Estonia’s success. \r\nEstonia’s development over the past 20 years is proof \r\nthat information and communications technology can \r\nbe a springboard to success for all States. We are quite \r\nwilling to continue to share our experience, especially \r\nin increasing transparency and openness in \r\nGovernment, with other countries. \r\n The Internet, however, poses many dangers as \r\nwell. Increasingly disruptive cyberthreats and attacks \r\nthat can seriously harm entire communities and, \r\nindeed, cause harm to countless individuals, are a new \r\ndanger that we face. The large-scale cyberattacks \r\nagainst Estonia in 2007 created a new awareness \r\namong our people. The steps Estonia has taken towards \r\na more secure Internet, however, do not restrict our \r\npeople’s freedoms. In fact, Freedom House’s global \r\nassessment of Freedom on the Net 2011 rated Estonia \r\nas the freest in the world, demonstrating that a proper \r\nbalance between rights and security can be found \r\nwithout compromising either. \r\n We also bear responsibility for the environment \r\nwe live in. It was no accident that the democratic \r\nrevolutions of Central and Eastern Europe were \r\naccompanied, and indeed often instigated, by \r\nenvironmental movements. Citizens had become fed up \r\nwith the totalitarian system’s abuse of nature and \r\ndisregard for human beings. Ignoring the state of its \r\ncitizens’ health and surroundings, the totalitarian State \r\nexposed itself to be what it was — a self-serving clique \r\nhell-bent on maintaining its power, no matter what the \r\ncost to its people, no matter what pain and suffering \r\nensued. \r\n Today, the challenge we face is global. It is \r\nclimate change. Estonia’s 2010 national security \r\nconcept states that climate change is also a security \r\nissue and can have a destabilizing effect. Estonia \r\nalready has decided to contribute to the fast-track \r\n A/66/PV.11\r\n \r\n49 11-50692 \r\n \r\nfinancing of efforts to combat climate change. We \r\nbelieve that sustainable development and the green \r\neconomy need a global approach, as exemplified by \r\npreparations for the United Nations Conference on \r\nSustainable Development next year.  \r\n One already evident consequence of climate \r\nchange is an increase in the number of people who \r\nneed clean water and food. Estonia will continue to \r\nincrease its contribution to the United Nations \r\nhumanitarian system. \r\n While the world’s humanitarian needs grow, we \r\nrequire increased coordination and strict scrutiny of the \r\nreal needs of aid recipients. As donor Governments, we \r\nare doubly accountable, first to those who require \r\nassistance; but we are also accountable to our \r\ntaxpayers for the effective use of every Euro cent. If \r\nour taxpayers believe that Government is spending tax \r\nmoney unwisely or ineffectively, they will vote for a \r\nGovernment that cares less for foreign assistance \r\nexpenditures. In these days of ever greater financial \r\ndifficulty in donor countries themselves, this is not an \r\nobservation to be ignored. \r\n The many times I have addressed the General \r\nAssembly, I have deliberated on the nature of the \r\nUnited Nations and the need for reform. The United \r\nNations needs to change as the world around us \r\nchanges. System-wide coherence, delivering as one, \r\nand revitalization of the General Assembly are steps in \r\nthe right direction.  \r\n We welcome these changes, yet at the same time \r\nEstonia sincerely hopes that the same spirit will prevail \r\nin reform of the Security Council. If nations are not \r\ngiven a fair and equitable voice, proportional and \r\nappropriate to its role in today’s world — not the world \r\nof 1945 — we will find that the Organization has ever \r\nless credibility. I propose that we adopt a new attitude \r\nof openness to new developments in order to make sure \r\nthat the United Nations as a whole can better deliver on \r\nthe undoubtedly important issues for which it is \r\nresponsible. \r\n In conclusion, let me say that history did not end \r\n20 years ago with the re-emergence of democratic \r\nnations in Central and Eastern Europe. Nor will history \r\nend with the Arab Spring. Democracy, freedom, human \r\nrights, the rule of law and sustainable development all \r\nrequire constant and consistent support and protection. \r\n The world faces challenges, new and old. We face \r\nthem daily. Today, as we commemorate the victims of \r\nthe 9/11 terrorist attack ten years ago here in New \r\nYork, we recognize how much the world has changed \r\nsince the United Nations was founded 66 years ago. We \r\nmust address and act upon these new challenges. It is \r\nwe, the United Nations, who need to keep pace with \r\nchanges and developments in the world we live in to \r\nprotect and promote universal values across the globe. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of Estonia for \r\nthe statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Toomas Hendrik Ilves, President of the \r\nRepublic of Estonia, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.  \r\n \r\nAddress by Her Excellency Ms. Micheline Calmy-\r\nRey, President of the Swiss Confederation  \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will hear \r\nan address by the President of the Swiss Confederation. \r\n Ms. Micheline Calmy-Rey, President of the Swiss \r\nConfederation, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations Her Excellency Ms. Micheline Calmy-Rey, \r\nPresident of the Swiss Confederation, and to invite her \r\nto address the Assembly. \r\n President Calmy-Rey (spoke in French): How \r\ncan we shape development policy that is of benefit to \r\nall? The per capita gross domestic product of \r\nSwitzerland is 130 times higher than that of a country \r\nsuch as Mozambique. Why do the poorest countries \r\nbenefit so little from globalization, and what can we do \r\nto change this? One-quarter of the world’s population \r\nconsumes three-quarters of the available raw materials. \r\nHow can we ensure that nearly 7 billion individuals \r\nhave enough water, food and energy at affordable \r\nprices? And what happened to equity and social justice \r\nin the twenty-first century? \r\n It is up to us together to find the answers to these \r\nquestions. That will require us to have a sense of \r\nresponsibility and to be ready to reflect together on \r\nnorms, values and priorities. \r\n More than any other international organization, \r\nthe United Nations has the potential and the necessary \r\nA/66/PV.11  \r\n \r\n11-50692 50 \r\n \r\nconditions to support States in these efforts. Since its \r\nfounding, the United Nations has developed into a \r\ndense institutional network. International governance \r\nremains fragmented and inefficient. Governance \r\nstructures need to be strengthened if the United \r\nNations is to succeed as the driving force towards \r\nsustainable development. \r\n Events in the Arab world have been a reminder \r\nthat democracy and sustainable development go hand \r\nin hand. Indeed, it was ultimately the lack of political \r\nfreedom, combined with injustice and a lack of \r\neconomic prospects, that unleashed the fundamental \r\nchanges that have so surprised us. Many nations are \r\nfacing difficult changes today and the fact that \r\nrelations among States and between the region and the \r\nrest of the world need to be based on new principles. \r\nThis is a challenge to the countries themselves and to \r\nthe new social groups driving the change: youth, \r\nwomen, the emerging middle classes and civil society \r\nas a whole. But it is also a challenge to the countries \r\nand Governments of the region, as well as for us all as \r\nMembers of the United Nations. \r\n We must do our best to ensure that effective aid is \r\nprovided quickly to the victims of unrest and violence. \r\nWe must ensure that security and the rule of law are \r\nstrengthened. We must contribute to inclusive political \r\ndialogue, promoting national reconciliation and \r\nlegitimate efforts to create new constitutions. We must \r\nextend the authority of State institutions and restore \r\npublic services. We must help to protect the human \r\nrights of all and support transitional justice. We must \r\nalso support immediate economic recovery measures. \r\nOnly through such a wide-ranging programme, backed \r\nby an international community in which each member \r\nis ready to make a constructive contribution, will it be \r\npossible to create more favourable conditions for \r\nsustainable development. \r\n I note with regret that the spirit of optimism \r\nborne of the Arab Spring has not breathed new life into \r\nthe Middle East peace process. We remember the \r\nwords of President Obama before the General \r\nAssembly a year ago well — words that encouraged us \r\nto hope for change. For a few minutes, we dreamed \r\ntogether of  \r\n “the young girl in Gaza who wants to have no \r\nceiling on her dreams or the young boy in Sderot \r\nwho wants to sleep without the nightmare of \r\nrocket fire” (A/65/PV.11, p. 12).  \r\nWe entertained the hope that, together with Palestine \r\nand Israel, we could succeed in reaching an agreement \r\nthat would allow us to welcome a new Member to the \r\nUnited Nations — a sovereign and independent \r\nPalestine, living side by side in peace with Israel. \r\n Somberly, we note instead that the past year has \r\nbeen a year of deadlock with no progress but \r\nstagnation, and even a hardening of positions. For \r\nmore than 60 years, the international community has \r\nfailed to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The \r\nso-called peace process has replaced peace. In order to \r\nreturn peace to the centre of the stage, influential \r\npeople on both sides have attempted to implement a \r\ntangible and lasting vision. We gave them our support \r\nand facilitated a model agreement. The Geneva \r\ninitiative is today a consolidated, detailed proposal \r\ncompatible with internationally accepted parameters, \r\nincluding the Arab Peace Initiative. It remains at the \r\ndisposal of the decision-makers, as well as of the \r\npopulations whose right it is to demand peace. \r\n Preventing future wars was the goal of the \r\nfounding of the United Nations. Today, it remains \r\namong the noblest objectives of this Organization. The \r\npast two decades have shown that the international \r\ncommunity has every interest in finding ways to \r\nstrengthen its efforts in the area of mediation. Indeed, \r\nit is in a negotiated solution rather than military victory \r\nthat a lasting solution will be found for the majority of \r\nconflicts.  \r\n The Security Council plays an important role in \r\nthe prevention of conflicts. Switzerland would \r\nwelcome a stronger and more lasting commitment to \r\npreventive diplomacy on the part of the Security \r\nCouncil. If the Security Council is to be able to make a \r\nworthwhile contribution to peace and security, it must \r\nadapt to new realities and reflect the new political \r\nbalance of power of the twenty-first century. I should \r\nalso like it to be more transparent and open and to \r\nfulfil its duty of remaining accountable to the Member \r\nStates.  \r\n Ultimately, the decisions of the Security Council \r\nhave a direct impact on all States in ways that are \r\nlegally binding. That is why Switzerland advocates, \r\nalong with its partners in the so-called small five \r\ngroup, improvement of the Council’s working methods. \r\nThe small five’s proposals are practical and concrete. \r\nThey can be implemented immediately without any \r\nneed to amend the United Nations Charter.  \r\n A/66/PV.11\r\n \r\n51 11-50692 \r\n \r\n However, the United Nations will be truly \r\nstrengthened only if those countries that rightly insist \r\non having greater participation also show themselves \r\nready to accept greater responsibility for the \r\nOrganization’s proper functioning and its financial \r\nsituation. \r\n The United Nations is unique in being the only \r\nOrganization that offers all the countries of the world \r\nthe opportunity to join together to address the whole \r\nrange of international challenges to peace and security, \r\nranging from the protection of human rights to \r\nsustainable development. Switzerland is ready to \r\ncontribute, and we look forward to working together  \r\n \r\nwith the new President of the General Assembly, \r\nMr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, whom I congratulate \r\non his election and offer the full support of my country \r\nduring this sixty-sixth session of the Assembly. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Swiss \r\nConfederation for the statement she has just made. \r\n Ms. Micheline Calmy-Rey, President of the Swiss \r\nConfederation, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.  \r\n  The meeting rose at 2.55 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
