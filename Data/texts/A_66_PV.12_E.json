(Qatar) \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 3.15 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Porfirio Lobo Sosa, President of the \r\nRepublic of Honduras \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Honduras. \r\n Mr. Porfirio Lobo Sosa, President of the Republic \r\nof Honduras, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Porfirio Lobo Sosa, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Honduras, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly. \r\n President Lobo Sosa (spoke in Spanish): For \r\nHonduras, it is a source of great satisfaction to \r\nparticipate in this important session of the General \r\nAssembly. On behalf of the Honduran people, I should \r\nlike at the outset to express our great pleasure at the \r\nre-appointment of Mr. Ban Ki-moon for another term \r\nas Secretary-General. I also wish to convey to the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth \r\nsession, Mr. Joseph Deiss, my greatest respect for the \r\ncontribution he made to this global forum through the \r\nfruitful work achieved under his leadership. We also \r\ncongratulate Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser upon his \r\nelection as President of the General Assembly. \r\n I congratulate the State of South Sudan on having \r\nbecome the newest Member of the United Nations. \r\n It is also timely to reaffirm my decisive \r\ncommitment as a leader to this Organization, which \r\nrepresents the best forum for addressing and resolving \r\nthe problems facing the world in the quest for the \r\ncommon welfare of humankind based on the principles \r\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. I \r\nreaffirm our commitment to the Universal Declaration \r\nof Human Rights, and in particular to the principle that \r\nwe are all free and equal in dignity and rights. This \r\nconcept includes peoples and nations alike. Over and \r\nabove geopolitical interests, the self-determination of \r\npeoples is inviolable and inalienable. All peoples have \r\nthe right to their own territory, cultural identity and \r\ntraditions. \r\n In this context, my Government has recognized \r\nPalestine as a State and endorses its legitimate \r\naspiration to become a full member in the concert of \r\nnations. Full security for the State of Israel and full \r\ninternational recognition for Palestine are essential \r\nconditions for a comprehensive negotiated two-State \r\nsolution providing for strong and lasting peace through \r\nmutual understanding. If we want peace, we must \r\nrecall that peace is based on respect not only for human \r\nrights, but also for the rights of peoples and nations. \r\n With regard to my country, Honduras, I must say \r\nthat the political crises it suffered and the coup d’état \r\nof 28 June 2009 led to a deterioration in the human \r\nrights situation. Overcoming it is one of our highest \r\npriorities. Since I took office in January 2010, my task \r\nhas been to build unity and reconciliation among the \r\nHonduran people through peacebuilding founded on \r\nsocial justice. That process of reconciliation and \r\nA/66/PV.12  \r\n \r\n11-50702 2 \r\n \r\ndemocracy-building in our country has enjoyed the \r\nconstructive support of the international community as \r\na whole.  \r\n I take this opportunity to express my particular \r\nthanks for the mediation efforts of Presidents Juan \r\nManuel Santos Calderón of Colombia and Hugo \r\nChávez Frías of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, \r\nwhich led to the signing of the Cartagena Agreement, \r\nwhich in turn facilitated the return of Honduras to the \r\nOrganization of American States.  \r\n We have demonstrated by our actions that there is \r\nno State policy to violate human rights in Honduras; on \r\nthe contrary, we work every day to promote a culture \r\nof respect for human rights based on ongoing dialogue \r\nwith all sectors of society, with special attention to \r\nthose sectors that have generally been deprived of the \r\nright to participate. We are building a participatory \r\ndemocracy, derived from the principle that all social \r\ngroups have the full and legitimate right to take part in \r\nour history.  \r\n We have a secretariat for justice and human rights \r\nto advise on relevant policies. With the participation of \r\ncivil society organizations, the secretariat is \r\nenthusiastically working on developing our country’s \r\nfirst public human rights policy and a national action \r\nplan on human rights. It is also following the \r\nrecommendations made by the Human Rights Council \r\nto Honduras during the Universal Periodic Review. In \r\nline with those aspirations, in July our Truth and \r\nReconciliation Commission — having worked in \r\nabsolute legitimacy and transparency — completed its \r\nfully independent mandate and presented the people of \r\nHonduras with its report and recommendations so as to \r\nensure that such things never happen again and to \r\nfoment reconciliation within the Honduran family. We \r\nare taking the necessary steps to implement those \r\nrecommendations.  \r\n At the same time, faced with the global crisis that \r\nresulted from serious problems in developed \r\neconomies, we have met with trade unions, \r\nentrepreneurs, workers, farmers, civil society and \r\npolitical parties to reach an overall national agreement \r\nthat will enable us to face the challenges that the crisis \r\ncreated in our country. Our Honduran response has \r\nbeen to propose a social pact to establish conditions \r\npropitious for economic growth, employment, \r\nappropriate remuneration and productivity. The \r\nnational plan for the next 28 years is under way. We are \r\nempowering our citizens. The optimum Government \r\nwe can shape is comprised of a people who themselves \r\nwant to develop within a framework of equitable \r\neconomic growth. \r\n Alongside that overall national agreement, all \r\nsectors and stakeholders in the field of education are \r\nreaching agreement on wide-reaching educational \r\nreform in Honduras to propel a dynamic education \r\nadministration guaranteeing equal opportunity for all, \r\nespecially those who have the least. \r\n In the social sphere, we have a family assistance \r\nprogramme with conditional monetary benefits. More \r\nthan 400,000 families have received such payments, \r\nand by 2013 we hope to reach 600,000 families, \r\nrepresenting 50 per cent of families in Honduras. The \r\ncondition is that children go to school and that parents \r\nattend child-nutrition programmes.  \r\n In September 2010, along with President Johnson \r\nToribiong of Palau, we called upon heads of State of \r\nUnited Nations Member States to save sharks, stop the \r\ntraffic in shark fins and put an end to global \r\noverfishing of the species. I repeat that plea with the \r\nsame passion today.  \r\n Although our country does not contribute much \r\nto greenhouse gas emissions, we have signed many \r\ninternational treaties and conventions that aim to \r\nguarantee the planet’s security and climate for its \r\ninhabitants in the context of the clean development \r\nmechanism under the Kyoto Protocol. Beyond those \r\nimportant conventions, today we will sign the \r\nRotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent \r\nProcedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and \r\nPesticides in International Trade.  \r\n Honduras reiterates its strong approval of all \r\nmeasures to protect and conserve natural resources and \r\nthe environment, based on the principles agreed upon \r\n20 years ago. We ask the States Member of the United \r\nNations to renew those past commitments and to draw \r\nup national policies so that we can build our capacities \r\nand establish mechanisms that respond to the needs of \r\nthe population. \r\n Although it is not enough in itself, my \r\nGovernment has made significant progress in \r\npromoting the just historical claims, rights and profile \r\nof indigenous peoples and people of African descent. \r\nIn accordance with the Durban Declaration and Plan of \r\nAction, we have adopted public policies to work \r\n A/66/PV.12\r\n \r\n3 11-50702 \r\n \r\ntowards those commitments. Among them I would \r\nmention our ratification of the International \r\nConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial \r\nDiscrimination, the institution of an African Heritage \r\nMonth in Honduras, and the creation and inauguration \r\nof a Ministry of Indigenous Peoples and People of \r\nAfrican Descent.  \r\n I note that the United Nations, through General \r\nAssembly resolution 64/169, proclaimed 2011 the \r\nInternational Year for People of African Descent. In \r\nthat context, civil society members of African descent, \r\nin cooperation with the Organization for Ethnic \r\nCommunity Development convened and celebrated the \r\nFirst World Summit of People of African Descent in \r\nAugust, amply supported by my Government, other \r\nGovernments, international partners and United \r\nNations system bodies. One of my Government’s \r\naspirations is to complete our constitutional reform to \r\ndefine Honduras as a multi-ethnic, multicultural \r\ncountry.  \r\n My Government joins its voice to those of \r\nmillions of people of African descent in calling for the \r\nUnited Nations to institute a decade for people of \r\nAfrican descent beginning in 2012, create a \r\ndevelopment fund for people of African descent, and \r\nestablish a permanent forum for peoples of African \r\ndescent within the United Nations. \r\n Before concluding, I would like to raise an issue \r\nthat is one of the greatest and most important \r\nchallenges that our region faces: citizen insecurity. The \r\nmost recent analysis carried out by the United Nations \r\nOffice on Drugs and Crime, the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme and the World Bank show \r\nthat Central America has become the region in the \r\nworld with the highest levels of violence and organized \r\ncrime. Their economic impact has escalated in the past \r\ndecade to reach, in the case of Honduras, a level close \r\nto 10 per cent of our gross domestic product.  \r\n Violence and transnational organized crime, \r\nprimarily evident in the commission of crimes such as \r\ndrug trafficking, kidnapping, murder, money and asset \r\nlaundering, people trafficking, arms trafficking, the \r\ncommercial sexual exploitation of women and minors, \r\namong other crimes, are a serious threat to our \r\npossibilities to create well-being. Without security, \r\nthere is no economic growth or development. \r\n The evidence shows that many of those crimes, \r\nfrom the organized crime and lack of security to which \r\nthey give rise and that prevail in our societies, have \r\ntheir roots in the use and trafficking of drugs. Owing to \r\ntheir very nature and to the sums of money involved, \r\nthey have a serious impact on our societies and add to \r\nthe erosion of our system of values. They steal our \r\nyoung people, destroy conviviality and community life \r\nand create parallel economic systems that are true \r\nenclaves of crime, violence and degradation.  \r\n Today, the countries of the region invest huge \r\namounts of money in combating the production and \r\ntrafficking of drugs. However, practically the only \r\ninstances in which the production and trafficking of \r\ndrugs significantly drop in a region occur as a result of \r\na change in routes or production being in other areas. \r\nGiven that demand in developing countries has not \r\ndecreased, the strategy that we follow in the region \r\ntoday, in the best case scenario, has only a partial and \r\nlimited impact on the trafficking, transport and use of \r\ndrugs.  \r\n For that reason, we note that, first of all, a pilot \r\nproject that we have put to the United Nations should \r\nbe launched to strengthen the capacity for the \r\ninvestigation and trial of organized crime in Honduras. \r\nSecondly, we need to gather together all the strategies \r\nthat were discussed at the International Conference in \r\nSupport of the Central America Security Strategy on \r\n22 and 23 June in Guatemala. We should also point out, \r\nand it must be reaffirmed, that consumer countries \r\nmust act bravely and resolutely in order to reduce or \r\neliminate the use of and the trade in drugs because we \r\nmust realize that without that, it will be very difficult \r\nfor our societies to end the scourge. We must succeed \r\nin aligning our strategies so as to end the drug scourge \r\nand organized crime.  \r\n I would like to end by expressing my best wishes \r\nfor this sixty-sixth session to meet the expectations of \r\nall Member States, which, I am sure, are founded on \r\nthe principle of the sovereign equality of States.  \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Honduras for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Porfirio Lobo Sosa, President of the Republic \r\nof Honduras, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nA/66/PV.12  \r\n \r\n11-50702 4 \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Viktor Yanukovych, President  \r\nof Ukraine \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of Ukraine. \r\n Mr. Viktor Yanukovych, President of Ukraine, was \r\nescorted into the General Assembly Hall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Viktor Yanukovych, \r\nPresident of Ukraine, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly. \r\n President Yanukovych (spoke in Ukrainian; \r\nEnglish interpretation provided by the delegation): I \r\nsincerely congratulate His Excellency Mr. Nassir \r\nAbdulaziz Al-Nasser on his election to the post of \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth \r\nsession. I am convinced that his considerable \r\nexperience will contribute to the achievement of \r\nsignificant results on behalf of States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations and the entire Organization. \r\n This year, the great family of States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations was enriched by a new 193rd Member. On \r\nbehalf of Ukraine, I would like to express our support \r\nfor the Government and people of South Sudan in the \r\nprocess of State-building, and to assure them of \r\nUkraine’s readiness to develop equal and mutually \r\nbeneficial cooperation with a new member of the \r\ninternational community. \r\n This is a special session given the number of high-\r\nlevel meetings devoted to issues of a global scale — \r\nnuclear safety and security, the prevention of \r\nnon-communicable diseases, desertification and land \r\ndegradation, racism and discrimination. \r\n During this session, the delegation of Ukraine has \r\nactively participated in discussions on the issues that \r\nare most topical for our State — nuclear security and \r\ndisease control. With regard to the theme of the general \r\ndebate, “The role of mediation in the settlement of \r\ndisputes”, I note that the issue of preventing armed \r\nconflict, and the loss of human lives and the suffering \r\ntriggered by them, was one of the cornerstones of \r\nUkraine’s first membership, as an independent State, of \r\nthe Security Council in 2000-2001. \r\n Preventive diplomacy and mediation at the \r\nregional and international levels, from the frozen \r\nconflicts in the post-Soviet space to a peaceful \r\nsettlement in the Middle East and the restoration of \r\nstability in North Africa, remain an integral part of \r\nUkraine’s foreign policy. We pursue that policy in the \r\nUnited Nations Peacebuilding Commission, and will \r\ncontinue to do so during Ukraine’s presidency of the \r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in \r\n2013. \r\n Regrettably, conflict prevention efforts are often \r\nnot effective enough, and conflict settlement takes too \r\nlong. Our main duty in such cases is to save lives and \r\nto alleviate the fate of civilians who find themselves in \r\ndanger. Ukraine will always provide help to those who \r\nsuffer. In addition to humanitarian efforts, we are ready \r\nto support all constructive international peace \r\ninitiatives and preventive measures. \r\n We believe that, in armed confrontations, top \r\npriority must be given to respect for human rights, first \r\nof all by ensuring the safety of civilians. Guided by \r\nthis principle, Ukraine was among the first to carry out \r\na humanitarian mission in Libya at the beginning of \r\nthis year. The Ukrainian amphibious landing ship \r\nKonstantin Olshansky was used to evacuate almost \r\n200 citizens of 20 nationalities, more than half of them \r\nwomen and children, from the conflict zone. \r\n Ukraine has just celebrated the twentieth \r\nanniversary of its independence. Today, we are \r\nassessing the road we have travelled and rethinking \r\nsome important moments in our modern history in \r\norder to find effective solutions to the issues that have \r\nremained unresolved for many years. It is precisely for \r\nthat purpose that I have initiated sweeping reforms in \r\nthe country, aimed at social and economic \r\ntransformations and at further strengthening the \r\ndemocratic system and the rule of law in Ukraine.  \r\n The foundations of all reform processes in \r\nUkraine are the fundamental democratic values that \r\nUkrainians share with other Europeans. That is why the \r\nguiding principles we have determined for the \r\nmodernization of the country are directly related to the \r\nambitious objectives contained in the future \r\nAssociation Agreement between Ukraine and the \r\nEuropean Union. \r\n The twentieth anniversary of our independence is \r\nonly an instant in historical terms, yet the roots of our \r\nstatehood can be traced back thousands of years. Since \r\nancient times, Ukraine has been developing a European \r\nspirit and culture, while cherishing the traditions of \r\ntolerance and inter-ethnic and intercultural harmony in \r\n A/66/PV.12\r\n \r\n5 11-50702 \r\n \r\nour society. We believe that straightforward and frank \r\ndialogue based on universal values is the only way to \r\nfind a common language in each country and in \r\ninternational relations alike. \r\n Ukraine’s position on the need to uphold human \r\nrights at all times and everywhere as the highest value \r\nhas always been crystal clear. Examples of that \r\ncommitment are seen in Ukraine’s activities during its \r\ntwo terms of membership in the Human Rights Council \r\nfrom June 2006 to June 2011. We will not lessen our \r\nattention to this subject and are planning to rejoin the \r\nCouncil in 2018. \r\n As Chair of the Committee of Ministers of the \r\nCouncil of Europe from May to November this year, \r\nUkraine is focused on the issues of children’s rights, \r\nthe development of local self-governance and the rule \r\nof law. We are convinced that the rule of law and \r\nrespect for human rights, as the bases for building a \r\nsociety, are needed to counter many contemporary \r\nthreats, including the complex challenges of terrorism. \r\n Recently, the world shuddered from the attack on \r\nthe United Nations building in Nigeria, which offered \r\nyet further proof that the ugly face of terrorism is \r\nbecoming more repulsive and brazen. The blow was \r\nstruck directly against our Organization, which is of \r\nparticular concern and requires increased security for \r\nUnited Nations premises. \r\n As one of the State initiators of the Convention \r\non the Safety of United Nations and Associated \r\nPersonnel, and as a party to all universal anti-terrorist \r\nconventions currently in force, Ukraine resolutely \r\ncondemns any manifestations of terrorism. We believe \r\nthat all terrorist acts, regardless of who commits them \r\nand where or why they are committed, violate a \r\nfundamental human right — the right to life — and \r\ntherefore constitute a crime against humanity. I pay \r\ntribute to the memory of those killed 10 years ago, on \r\n11 September 2001, as well as to all other victims of \r\nterrorist attacks. \r\n I am sincerely proud of the significant \r\ncontribution of Ukraine to the peaceful coexistence of \r\nhumankind. I refer not only to our voluntarily \r\nabandoning nuclear arms and large stockpiles of highly \r\nenriched uranium. The awareness of the global scale of \r\nthe effects of the Chernobyl disaster was the impetus \r\nfor my initiative to convene the Kyiv Summit on the \r\nSafe and Innovative Use of Nuclear Energy in April. \r\nThe Summit enabled us to enhance international \r\ncooperation in strengthening nuclear safety and in \r\nresponding adequately to accidents and emergencies. I \r\nsincerely thank all the participants in the Kyiv Summit \r\nand all of the donor countries that announced their \r\ncontributions to Chernobyl projects. \r\n We also welcome the holding of the high-level \r\nmeeting on nuclear safety and security, scheduled for \r\ntomorrow. We are committed to jointly working further \r\non this issue. Our country has unique experience in the \r\nrehabilitation of the area and the population victimized \r\nby the Chernobyl disaster. We are ready to share this \r\nexperience. Ukraine consistently supports efforts to \r\nensure gradual and irreversible nuclear disarmament \r\nfor the purpose of completely eliminating nuclear \r\nweapons from the world. We continue to insist that \r\nsecurity assurances for non-nuclear and non-aligned \r\nStates should be enshrined in a legally binding \r\ninternational instrument. I urge the leaders of other \r\nStates to consciously follow the example of Ukraine \r\nand its practical actions to promote disarmament and \r\nnon-proliferation. \r\n Ukraine is actively participating in United \r\nNations efforts to maintain international peace and \r\nsecurity. Throughout its 20 years of independence, over \r\n34,000 Ukraine’s soldiers and police have taken part in \r\npeacekeeping missions in more than 20 operations \r\nunder the United Nations mandate. Ukraine is a \r\ndedicated supporter of United Nations peacekeeping \r\nreform, the goal of which is to strengthen the \r\nOrganization’s capacity and eliminate existing \r\nshortcomings. Utmost attention should be paid to \r\nensuring the mobility of aviation resources in United \r\nNations peacekeeping, as well as to enhancing legal \r\nprotection for Blue Helmets. We are grateful to \r\nMember States for their support of Ukraine’s initiatives \r\nin this area, and we hope for effective joint work to be \r\nundertaken in this direction. \r\n One year ago, we held a High-level Plenary \r\nMeeting on the Millennium Development Goals. \r\nUkraine is committed to its obligations in achieving \r\nnational development goals. Among our main priorities \r\nare poverty reduction, ensuring quality education, \r\nenvironmental protection, improving health and \r\nreducing child mortality, curbing the spread of \r\nHIV/AIDS and tuberculosis, and ensuring gender \r\nequality.  \r\n Working on today’s immediate tasks, we believe \r\nit is necessary to pay greater attention to the \r\nA/66/PV.12  \r\n \r\n11-50702 6 \r\n \r\nincreasingly acute issue of climate change and \r\nenvironmental protection. We endorse the idea of \r\ncreating an effective international mechanism for the \r\nenvironmental protection of Earth as our common \r\nplanet — a global environmental organization with \r\nuniversal membership functioning on a permanent \r\nbasis. We also call upon Member States to study the \r\nidea of developing a new universal instrument that \r\ncould serve as a so-called environmental constitution, \r\ngive all countries clear guidelines from the cultural \r\nperspective, and identify compulsory principles for the \r\nsustainable development of the global green economy \r\nand the environmental safety of the planet. \r\n We consider it necessary to work on improving \r\nglobal energy security. We encourage the development, \r\nunder United Nations coordination, of an effective \r\nmultilateral cooperation mechanism aimed at achieving \r\ndevelopment goals in the energy field. \r\n In overcoming the impact of the global economic \r\ncrisis, we must avoid new challenges to the financial \r\nsector that affect trade and investment. It is our belief \r\nthat economic and social development should be \r\nfacilitated by the further liberalization of trade. \r\n In recent years, we have come to see how \r\nvulnerable any one nation can be to various security \r\nthreats and natural or manmade disasters. All these \r\nexamples have shown us the need for effective \r\ninternational mechanisms for combating such \r\nphenomena. It is high time that the United Nations and \r\nits specialized agencies seriously strengthened their \r\nrole in coordinating international efforts aimed at \r\npreventing, responding to and overcoming the impacts \r\nof catastrophes and severe humanitarian crises. We \r\nlook forward to strengthening the specialized United \r\nNations agencies and improving their effectiveness. \r\nUkraine stands ready to continue its active involvement \r\nin the practical humanitarian efforts of the World Food \r\nProgramme. A few days ago, Ukraine decided to \r\nprovide, through the United Nations, humanitarian \r\nassistance in the form of wheat for the purpose of \r\ncombating hunger in the Horn of Africa. \r\n Ukraine supports the greater involvement of the \r\nGeneral Assembly in international life and \r\nstrengthening its voice in addressing a wide range of \r\nglobal issues. The modern world is presenting the \r\nUnited Nations with new, complex and increasingly \r\ndifficult issues. We will not be able to improve the \r\neffectiveness of our joint work, however, without \r\ncomprehensive reform of the Organization and its \r\nprincipal bodies, including the Security Council.  \r\n Ukraine is open to discussing all progressive \r\nconcepts of reform that can bring Member States to the \r\nbroadest possible agreement. The consideration of the \r\ninterests of every regional group is an indispensable \r\ncomponent of the process of reforming the Council. \r\nUkraine believes that at least one additional \r\nnon-permanent seat of an expanded Security Council \r\nshould be given to the Group of Eastern European \r\nStates. \r\n I am confident that the sixty-sixth session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly will strengthen the United Nations \r\nin the face of global challenges and threats, reliably \r\nguaranteed by our strong political commitment and a \r\nclear vision of our common goals. I believe in our \r\nshared success. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of Ukraine for \r\nthe statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Viktor Yanukovych, President of Ukraine, was \r\nescorted from the General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Fernando Lugo Méndez, President of \r\nthe Republic of Paraguay \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Paraguay. \r\n Mr. Fernando Lugo Méndez, President of the \r\nRepublic of Paraguay, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Fernando Lugo Méndez, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Paraguay, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly. \r\n President Lugo Méndez (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the people of Paraguay, Mr. President, I offer \r\nyou sincere congratulations on your election to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth \r\nsession. I also thank Mr. Joseph Deiss for his laudable \r\nwork as President of the previous session, and \r\ncongratulate Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his re-appointment \r\nas Secretary-General. Throughout his tenure at the \r\nhead of the Organization for the past five years, he has \r\ndemonstrated his gift for leadership and his \r\n A/66/PV.12\r\n \r\n7 11-50702 \r\n \r\nunwavering commitment to world peace and \r\ninternational security. \r\n The people of Paraguay and their President, in \r\nconsonance with our extraordinary national history, \r\nbelieve deeply in the human being as the subject and \r\nend of and reason for every effort designed to benefit \r\nhumankind. The centrality of humans in the history of \r\nthe universe in all their endeavours, interests and \r\nconquests will be constantly proclaimed in this forum.  \r\n In order to begin to discuss the future of \r\nhumankind, we must correct mistakes and rethink \r\nparadigms that for decades, sometimes even for \r\ncenturies, have demonstrated their utter uselessness in \r\nbringing about change for good. Restoring men and \r\nwomen to centre stage in the concerns of the universe \r\nis a fundamental step in order merely to begin to trace \r\na basic outline for a future of certainty that seeks to \r\nreplace the frustrations of managing the development \r\nparadigm with the realities of a world in which well-\r\nbeing is much more tangible. \r\n What good does it do to discuss development \r\nplans if the goal of dignifying the human being is not \r\nthe beginning and the end of the process? At this stage \r\nin history, when we are thrilled by the most incredible \r\ntechnological achievements capable of keeping pace \r\nwith our flights of imagination and our dreams, where \r\ndoes that leave the nightmare of starving children who \r\nfight for a crust of bread, smile if they get it — and \r\nstill want to play? What benefit do we derive from the \r\nmedia hype about these great global and commercial \r\nachievements while in complicit silence the other half \r\nof humanity is holding out its hand, begging for a little \r\nhelp, for the love of God? What good does it do us to \r\ncontinue supporting a way of creating happiness in the \r\nworld that has been loudly shown to be a failure over \r\nand over again? \r\n Regions that enrich the economy of part of the \r\nworld with the natural abundance of their waters, their \r\noil, the precious stones hidden in the belly of their soil, \r\ncontinue inexorably to accumulate debt while their \r\ndaily offerings increase the wealth of rich societies \r\nevery day. The poor neighbour in today’s world \r\npossesses riches — those closer to the simplicity of \r\nwell-being and happiness, such as water, food, forests \r\nand renewable energy — that are vital to its rich \r\nneighbours. But unbridled wealth cannot be the basis \r\nfor political dominion and certainly not for wars and \r\nmilitary might. We live in societies because our \r\npeoples and other human beings have mutual needs. \r\n Population growth is a serious global issue. \r\nSometimes it seems as though we live in a world that, \r\nworse than resigning itself to poverty, resigns itself to \r\ninequality, to the pornographic spectacle of scandalous \r\nimbalances which reveal the inner workings of an \r\nostentatious world celebrating its shame, as described \r\nby Gabriel García Márquez in his tale of Innocent \r\nEréndira and Her Heartless Grandmother. As long as \r\nthat continues, the dialogue between the rich bank that \r\nsustains and coordinates the world economy and the \r\npoor world that provides the natural resources will \r\ngradually become senseless. \r\n My country’s growth rate in 2010 exceeded \r\n15 per cent; but tensions made efforts to redistribute \r\nthat wealth and reduce inequality more difficult than \r\nachieving the growth itself. \r\n I think that this is true all over the world. The \r\nUnited Nations needs to discuss measures to enable or \r\nassist Member States to work their way through fiscal \r\npolicies and international market regulations that \r\ncontribute to the stark reality of the huge fortunes that \r\nexist in the hands of just a few in some countries as \r\ncompared with the inequalities, droughts, humanitarian \r\ncrises in others. \r\n Solidarity is a ten-letter word that is fine-\r\nsounding but sometimes empty: empty of free will, \r\nactions and especially results. Solidarity is no longer \r\nsimply a moral imperative; it is a prerequisite for \r\nachieving progress and combating the dark side of \r\nignoring it: violence and crime. \r\n We live in a world which urgently requires a \r\nparadigm shift. And we must admit that the world is at \r\na crossroads; because one discourse that has been \r\ngoing on for five centuries in the name of progress and \r\nanother for six decades in the name of development \r\nhave only added uncertainty about any improvement in \r\nthe future lot of broad regions and thousands of \r\nmillions of people. \r\n The unrepentant incapability of the developed \r\ncountries to understand a very simple equation in order \r\nto set up local development plans as local plans for \r\ndevelopment means that known errors will be repeated \r\ndespite the urgent need for profound, convincing and \r\nradical rethinking capable of harnessing the mutual \r\ntrust that can promote progress towards the only \r\nA/66/PV.12  \r\n \r\n11-50702 8 \r\n \r\ntangible parameter, the only valid outcome, the only \r\ngenuine reality, which is a good life for all men and \r\nwomen. \r\n Achieving the good life for all should be the \r\nparadigm of our time. It clearly entails envisioning a \r\npost-development future in which thoughtfulness, \r\nobjectivity and goodwill coexist in harmony and \r\ngenuine solidarity reigns without delay between those \r\nin the powerful and wealthy world and those who live \r\nin poverty elsewhere.  \r\n This is not just a moral vision. Of fundamental \r\nimportance to progress is the sharing of wealth. And \r\nthat brings me to the main theme of this forum, \r\navoiding future conflict and future violence. But the \r\nparadigm of the good life requires plans that focus on \r\nthe dignity of human beings and the future rather than \r\non resource exploitation systems which almost never \r\nbenefit the people. \r\n In Latin America — the region to which my \r\nGovernment is committed — we live the daily paradox \r\nof poverty in the midst of the best basic conditions for \r\ngenerating wealth. Historically, since colonial times, \r\nour wealth has followed a one-way path to other \r\nregions of the world, without generating any structural \r\nimprovements in our economies. \r\n We attend the prestigious world summits of the \r\ndeveloped countries where the lot of poor countries has \r\nbeen debated for decades, yet we have had no luck. \r\nWhen will the countries of Latin America realize that \r\nwe export nature, we export oxygen, we export fresh \r\nwater, we export food, we export renewable energy? It \r\nmakes no sense that our countries remain poor, when \r\nwe have so many assets and products that enrich the \r\nrest of the world. \r\n Finally, on this subject, a paradigm shift to ensure \r\nthat human beings are at the centre of world concerns \r\nrequires commitment on the part of those who govern \r\nthe most powerful countries. We in turn must commit \r\nto supporting them and not abandoning them if that \r\nparadigm shift takes place. And the most intelligent \r\nform of support is, as we have just mentioned, to \r\ndevelop an awareness of what we are and the enormous \r\npotential with which our countries are endowed. \r\n Paraguay reaffirms its steadfast commitment to \r\nmultilateralism based on a democratic and egalitarian \r\nnew world order, an order that will ensure the \r\ncomprehensive and effective development of our \r\ncountries. Paraguay therefore believes both in a \r\nstronger and more democratic United Nations, as a \r\ntruly global organization, and in strengthening progress \r\nin the regional integration of peoples. For example, we \r\nhave the Union of South American Nations — \r\nUNASUR — and the future Community of Latin \r\nAmerican and Caribbean States, which provide \r\ncommon space for nations that share a common history, \r\ncommon values and common plans for sovereignty and \r\nindependence.  \r\n Global change is picking up speed. The still \r\nsignificant primacy of the central Powers in economic \r\nand military terms, and therefore in political and \r\ncultural terms, is facing demands for democratization \r\nof the world order and progress in multilateralism. The \r\nfinancial, energy, social and environmental crises are \r\nproof of the contradictions and conflicts in the strategic \r\ninterests of the great Powers as well as the weaknesses \r\nof the aid-dependent countries and those in the midst of \r\ndevelopment. We believe in mediation as a remedy to \r\novercome social injustice and as a path towards peace.  \r\n Among our peoples’ demands for strengthened \r\ndemocracy, we see the spirit of the words of Nelson \r\nMandela when, in the past century, he said that there \r\ncan be no democracy with poverty and no democracy \r\nwith social inequality. That is why the theme of the \r\nsixty-sixth session of the General Assembly, on \r\nstrengthening the role of mediation in the settlement of \r\ndisputes by peaceful means, conflict prevention and \r\nresolution, has taken on greater relevance. \r\n Article 1 of the United Nations Charter states that \r\nthe purpose of our Organization is  \r\n “to take effective collective measures for the \r\nprevention and removal of threats to the peace, \r\nand for the suppression of acts of aggression or \r\nother breaches of the peace”. \r\nThus, in the face of violence and today’s wars, whether \r\ntraditional or silent, short or long-term, there is a \r\ndemand for mediation as a mechanism for peace, as a \r\ntool to overcome global social injustice and thus a \r\nnecessary foundation for achieving international peace \r\nand security.  \r\n In that context, we advocate mediation in order to \r\novercome global social injustice and both traditional \r\nand silent wars. It must be based on the shared but \r\ndifferentiated responsibilities of all countries, \r\ndeveloping and developed, in order to guarantee the \r\n A/66/PV.12\r\n \r\n9 11-50702 \r\n \r\nconditions necessary for a peaceful world that relies on \r\nthe comprehensive and effective development of our \r\npeoples. Lastly, it must avoid ruinous hypotheses at all \r\ncosts, such as those that led to “preventive attacks”, \r\nwhich culminated in the loss of many lives, the \r\ndestruction of entire cities and vital elements of \r\nuniversal culture, and sowed the seeds for the dreadful \r\nmistrust of any subsequent such initiatives. \r\n The self-determination of peoples should not be \r\nshaped by the political or economic interests of those \r\nwho oversee global equilibrium with weapons. It is, \r\nand must be, written in stone. \r\n Paraguay plays an active role in United Nations \r\npeacekeeping missions. Beginning this year, after more \r\nthan a decade of uninterrupted contributions of military \r\nobservers, Paraguay will be contributing a multirole \r\nengineering unit to the United Nations Stabilization \r\nMission in Haiti, the first to be deployed under our \r\nnational flag. \r\n The General Assembly should adopt the \r\nnecessary reforms so as to reaffirm its inherent nature \r\nas a universal, democratic and equitable representative \r\nbody. In this way, its powers will be recognized and \r\nwill take precedence over those of other bodies in the \r\nOrganization, such as the Security Council, in order to \r\nunderscore the processes that help to overcome \r\nviolence and globalized social injustice and build the \r\nmultipolar, democratic and egalitarian world that we so \r\ngreatly desire. \r\n In the same vein, democratizing the Security \r\nCouncil is becoming an increasingly urgent task. We \r\nurge the Council to fulfil its primary role of promoting \r\nworld peace and avoiding war, which is why it must be \r\nreformed and become more democratic. We must \r\naccord greater legitimacy to the Council by making it \r\nmore representative of the new multilateral and \r\nmultipolar world order, and by gradually doing away \r\nwith veto rights. \r\n We must express our concern, here before the \r\nGeneral Assembly, regarding the actions taken in Libya \r\nunder resolution 1973 (2011) of the Security Council \r\nand in the context of the responsibility to protect. We \r\nbelieve that the use of force must always be a last \r\nresort. \r\n That is why we are concerned about the crisis \r\naffecting the United Nations Security Council, which \r\ncan be overcome only through its reform and \r\ndemocratization. Thus, we insist and urge that efforts \r\ncontinue to be made to that end so that the Council can \r\nonce again fulfil its mission of guaranteeing \r\ninternational peace and security. \r\n In terms of foreign policy, Paraguay, as one of the \r\nfounding Members of the Organization, upholds and \r\nreiterates the constitutional principles governing its \r\ninternational relations: national independence, self-\r\ndetermination of peoples, legal equality of States, \r\nsolidarity and international cooperation, international \r\nprotection of human rights, freedom of navigation in \r\ninternational rivers, non-intervention, and condemnation of \r\nall forms of dictatorship, colonialism and imperialism.  \r\n In the 50 years since the embargo was imposed \r\non the people of Cuba, Paraguay has repeatedly \r\nexpressed its opposition to that economic, commercial \r\nand financial blockade, as have the countries of Latin \r\nAmerica and the Caribbean. Paraguay has stood \r\ntogether with those countries and called for the \r\nimmediate lifting of the embargo. In particular, we \r\ndeplore the impact of this unjust blockade on the \r\nCuban people, which is a consequence of positive laws \r\nthat affect free trade and the transparent practice of \r\ninternational trade. \r\n In that respect, Paraguayan legislation does not \r\nrecognize the extraterritorial application of foreign \r\nlaws that violate the sovereignty of other States. This \r\npractice also violates the principles of international law \r\nthat we, the Members of the United Nations, defend \r\nand strive to uphold. \r\n Paraguay has consistently supported the \r\nresolutions adopted by the General Assembly at \r\nprevious sessions which call for the lifting of the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo against \r\nCuba. In full observance of resolution 65/6, entitled \r\n“Necessity of ending the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba”, and before this Assembly, \r\nParaguay once again reiterates its support for the \r\nresolutions adopted in that regard. \r\n Consistent with the stance it has taken in \r\ninternational forums, in particular the United Nations, \r\nand considering the resolutions that condemn the \r\nIsraeli occupation of Palestinian territories, such as \r\nSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973), \r\n446 (1979) and 478 (1980), Paraguay established \r\ndiplomatic relations with Palestine on 25 March 2005 \r\nA/66/PV.12  \r\n \r\n11-50702 10 \r\n \r\nand recognizes a free and independent Palestinian State \r\nbased on the borders of 4 June 1967. \r\n We are gratified that the agenda of the sixty-sixth \r\nsession of the General Assembly includes the \r\nrecognition of the free, sovereign and independent \r\nState of Palestine. We are convinced that this is a \r\nconfirmation of the historic debt of the international \r\ncommunity to recognize the legitimate right of the \r\nPalestinian people to have its own State with well-\r\ndefined borders. This will be a significant contribution \r\nto the peace process in the Middle East. \r\n We believe that urgent efforts are needed to \r\ndesign and build a new international financial \r\narchitecture, one that responds to the new era in which \r\nwe live and provides measures for avoiding systematic \r\ncyclical crises and for developing regional mechanisms \r\nfor economic and financial cooperation. Under this \r\nnew framework, nations with common histories and \r\ndestinies can create their own spaces for cooperation \r\nand economic partnerships. \r\n The countries of South America have focused the \r\nactions of UNASUR on this goal. We are confident \r\nthat, by coordinating and linking our economic \r\ninitiatives, we will lay the foundation for integration, \r\nwhich will not only protect our countries from crises \r\nthat are not of our creation, but also guarantee the \r\ncomprehensive development of our peoples. \r\n Paraguay is among those nation States which, \r\nover the course of history, have fallen prey to various \r\nvulnerabilities, given their geographic situation and \r\nhistorical experience. Paraguay has been weakened by \r\na historic model of socio-economic development based \r\non the looting of its natural and strategic resources and \r\nadministered through relations of structural \r\ndependence. \r\n That is why, in January 2010, Paraguay became \r\nthe Chair of the Group of Landlocked Developing \r\nCountries. In that capacity, we urge transit countries \r\nand their main neighbours, as applicable, as well as \r\ninternational organizations and the most developed \r\ncountries, to increase their commitment to implement \r\nthe Almaty Programme of Action, addressing the \r\nspecial needs of landlocked developing countries \r\nwithin a new global framework for transit transport \r\ncooperation. This will help such countries to overcome \r\ntheir limitations and will facilitate their overall \r\ndevelopment. \r\n As a complement to beginning the preparations \r\nfor the Conference of Landlocked and Transit \r\nDeveloping Countries, which will help us to overcome \r\nthe adversities we face, we are promoting the \r\nMultilateral Agreement for the Establishment of an \r\nInternational Think Tank for Landlocked Developing \r\nCountries, in the conviction that scientific advances in \r\nthat area will be of great importance in overcoming the \r\nobstacles that such countries face. \r\n Regarding the Millennium Development Goals, \r\nParaguay reaffirms its full commitment to achieving \r\nthose goals and expresses its concern about the extent \r\nto which they will be met by 2015. This is why we \r\nencourage Governments, civil society organizations \r\nand the private sector to work together to achieve \r\nthem.  \r\n Given its commitment to the goal of fully \r\nrespecting the human rights of our peoples, Paraguay \r\nhas decided to present its candidacy for the Human \r\nRights Council for the term 2014-2017. We hope to \r\nhave the support of the international community. \r\n We must express our serious concern for the \r\nenvironmental crisis, which is worsening on a daily \r\nbasis and even generating uncertainty about the \r\nsurvival of the human race. We fully support \r\nstrengthening the only legally binding agreement in \r\nthis area, the Kyoto Protocol, and its further extension. \r\nThe agreements reached in Cancún are a great support \r\nin improving emissions levels but they are voluntary in \r\nnature, which contradicts the principle of climate \r\njustice that our peoples so favour.  \r\n Finally, I would like to thank all those who \r\nhelped the Paraguayan initiative for the International \r\nDay of Friendship to come to fruition. The friendship \r\nof individuals, peoples and nations is not exclusively a \r\nquestion of diplomacy, much less a commercial \r\nenterprise to make money from the inclination of \r\nhuman beings to join together. Friendship is that bond \r\nwhich must necessarily be based on solidarity, and, in \r\nParaguay, we believe that it is high time for the world \r\nto make it happen.  \r\n I am pleased that this initiative has become \r\nuniversal. On behalf of the Paraguayan people, we \r\ngreet all the peoples of the world in the hope that we \r\nwill find the way to overcome global social injustices \r\nand thus guarantee a world culture of peace and \r\nfriendship based on the well-being and genuine \r\ndevelopment of all our peoples, without distinction. \r\n A/66/PV.12\r\n \r\n11 11-50702 \r\n \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Paraguay for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Fernando Lugo Méndez, President of the \r\nRepublic of Paraguay, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Paul Kagame, President of the \r\nRepublic of Rwanda \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Rwanda. \r\n Mr. Paul Kagame, President of the Republic of \r\nRwanda, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Paul Kagame, President of \r\nthe Republic of Rwanda, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly. \r\n President Kagame: As the world continues to \r\ndeal with crises, including conflicts across the globe, \r\nwe need to examine the role of mediation in the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes, conflict prevention and \r\nresolution, and the part each one of us needs to play. \r\n The effect of decades of conflict has been an \r\nunacceptable loss of life and a reversal of global social \r\nand economic progress. What has also become clear is \r\nthat although most conflicts are now domestic in \r\nnature, they continue to have a destabilizing effect on \r\nneighbouring countries and the rest of the world. \r\n One needs to look carefully at the dividends of \r\nstriving towards shared global prosperity, which in turn \r\nincreases capacity to deal with conflict. By tackling \r\ndevelopment issues, for example, through the \r\nframework of the Millennium Development Goals, \r\nestablished by this body and the Secretary-General, we \r\ncreate conditions conducive to the formation of a more \r\nstable world. \r\n Figures from the United Nations itself indicate \r\nthat about $7.1 billion will be spent in the period \r\n2011-2012 for peacekeeping purposes. Resources such \r\nas these that are consumed by conflicts could otherwise \r\nbe channelled through the United Nations or other \r\nrelevant institutions to improve the lives of millions of \r\npeople. \r\n Thus, while it is appropriate to talk about how \r\nmediation can support efforts to prevent and manage \r\nconflicts, we should also ask ourselves why, after \r\ndecades of trying, we are not making the progress we \r\nwould like to make in this regard. \r\n Mr. Quinlan (Australia), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n We know that the likelihood of conflict is high \r\nwhen citizens feel disenfranchised and marginalized, \r\nand where Governments do not govern in the interests \r\nof their people. If the rule of law is absent and access \r\nto opportunity is limited or exclusive, that is a problem \r\nwhich we should address as a global community, \r\nconsistently and with commitment. It makes good \r\neconomic and political sense to invest in conflict \r\nprevention, thus reducing future outbreaks and \r\navoiding short-term, quick-fix solutions.  \r\n Apart from traditional interventions that we \r\nemploy with varying success, there is one major asset \r\nthat remains under-utilized, and that is our youth. \r\nYounger generations carry less historical and political \r\nbaggage and are more inclined to get the most out of \r\nthe global village that we all find ourselves sharing. \r\nWith social and communication tools, they are key \r\ninnovators and thought leaders not only of tomorrow \r\nbut of right now. We have an important responsibility \r\nto empower them to believe in themselves and in a \r\nbetter future. \r\n Returning to the topic of mediation and the \r\nassociated issues of negotiation and reconciliation, \r\nthese practices are not new ones in Africa, or in my \r\ncountry, Rwanda. They play a useful role, and one that \r\nshould be strengthened. However, various experiences \r\nhave shown that if mediation is to succeed, national \r\nefforts should be supported in the first place, based on \r\nspecific cultural and political contexts. In Rwanda, for \r\ninstance, we have seen national efforts produce long-\r\nlasting solutions and tangible results on the ground \r\nbecause they are homegrown. \r\n It is also important to involve in mediation efforts \r\nregional and subregional players who have ample \r\nknowledge of the often complex regional dynamics of \r\nconflicts. These organizations should be supported \r\nexpeditiously before disputes escalate into intractable \r\nconflicts. \r\n Additionally, we need to take a good look at the \r\ntoll that traditional diplomatic mediation can have on \r\nA/66/PV.12  \r\n \r\n11-50702 12 \r\n \r\nthe lives of people living in conflict areas. Too often, \r\nwhile resolutions are being debated and refined, people \r\nare dying. And sometimes when those resolutions are \r\neventually adopted, enforcement is slow, or they only \r\nhalt the conflict for a short time but with no sustainable \r\nsolutions. \r\n Let us also remember the limitations faced by \r\nexternal mediation experts who, even when having \r\ngood intentions, are often unable to foster any lasting \r\nchange at the root level of the conflict. National \r\nownership remains very critical. Mediation efforts \r\nmust be based on an overriding desire to help \r\nconflicting parties to resolve their differences. But that \r\nshould not be confused with supporting one side in the \r\nconflict or imposing a solution that is in the interests of \r\nthe mediators. \r\n Let me conclude by saying that the most viable \r\noption for preventing conflict is to empower our own \r\ncitizens, especially youth, politically, economically and \r\nsocially, so that they have a stake in the management \r\nand stability of the nation. Ultimately, long-lasting \r\nsolutions are the ones that emanate from within. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Rwanda for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Paul Kagame, President of the Republic of \r\nRwanda, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Željko Komšić, Chair of the \r\nPresidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Chair of the Presidency of \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina. \r\n Mr. Željko Komšić, Chair of the Presidency of \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Željko Komšić, Chair of \r\nthe Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly. \r\n Mr. Komšić (spoke in Bosnian; English text \r\nprovided by the delegation): It is my great honour to \r\naddress the General Assembly today in my capacity as \r\nthe Chair of the Presidency of Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina. Allow me, at the very outset, to \r\ncongratulate Mr. Al-Nasser upon his election as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth \r\nsession, as well as the members of the Bureau, and to \r\nexpress our full support for your future work. \r\nFurthermore, I would like to congratulate Mr. Joseph \r\nDeiss on the results achieved when he presided over \r\nthe sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly, in a \r\nperiod when this body and the international community \r\nin general were facing an array of challenges stemming \r\nfrom current global issues. \r\n I am especially honoured to extend \r\ncongratulations to the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban \r\nKi-moon, for his unanimous re-appointment as the \r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations. Over the past \r\nfive years, Mr. Ban has worked tirelessly to address the \r\nvarious issues facing the Organization. We expect that \r\nthe Secretary-General will continue to pursue these \r\nactivities during his second term. \r\n Allow me to express my gratitude for all the \r\ncooperation and the support we have received during \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina’s membership in the Security \r\nCouncil, which will expire in a few months. Speaking \r\nof our membership in the Security Council, let me once \r\nagain reiterate the view that the presence and \r\nparticipation of small States such as Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina in the work and decisions of the Security \r\nCouncil is particularly important for maintaining \r\nbalance within it. Accordingly, other countries, along \r\nwith the Security Council’s permanent members and \r\nthe world Powers, also have the opportunity to express \r\ntheir views and participate in Security Council \r\ndecision-making on important issues of international \r\npeace and security. It has been our pleasure and honour \r\nto work together with all members of the Security \r\nCouncil during the term of our membership, \r\n2010-2011. \r\n Bosnia and Herzegovina had the honour to \r\npreside over the Security Council in January 2011. \r\nAlthough acting as President was only one segment of \r\nthe two-year experience in the Council, Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina once again proved that it can be an equal \r\npartner on the international diplomatic scene and \r\nrespond to a variety of obligations.  \r\n Bosnia and Herzegovina has played a \r\nconstructive role in the work of the Security Council \r\nby contributing to the Council’s better, more effective \r\nand faster response to situations with the potential to \r\n A/66/PV.12\r\n \r\n13 11-50702 \r\n \r\nthreaten international peace. Furthermore, Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina has also sought to share its own \r\nexperiences in post-conflict peacebuilding and \r\ncontribute actively to better and long-lasting \r\nunderstanding and reconciliation. Through its role in \r\nthe Council, Bosnia and Herzegovina showed that it \r\ncan be an equal and competent partner in international \r\nrelations. \r\n The Security Council thematic debate (see \r\nS/PV.6472) entitled “Post-conflict peacebuilding: \r\ninstitution-building”, which was initiated by Bosnia \r\nand Herzegovina, reached a number of conclusions. I \r\nwould like to mention some of them. \r\n In the interests of the success of peacebuilding \r\ninitiatives, priority must be given to institution-\r\nbuilding. so as to prevent a return to conflict and \r\nensure the survival, renewed credibility and legitimacy \r\nof States. The purpose of institution-building is to \r\nprogressively reduce dependence on the international \r\ncommunity and promote sustainability. Ownership of \r\nthe reform process is the main condition for the \r\nestablishment of effective institutions and for ensuring \r\nsustainable peace. \r\n Success in post-conflict institution-building \r\ndepends primarily on establishing partnerships between \r\nthe international community and post-conflict \r\nsocieties, a partnership that is based on a set of \r\ncommon goals. Bearing that in mind, we would like \r\nonce again to thank the Assembly for the confidence its \r\nmembers have shown and for the support they have \r\nprovided during our membership in the Security \r\nCouncil.  \r\n Bosnia and Herzegovina also continues to \r\nprovide concrete contributions to the United Nations \r\npeace operations in Liberia, the Sudan, Cyprus and the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. \r\n In Bosnia and Herzegovina, we are united in our \r\ndetermination to move towards full membership in the \r\nEuropean Union (EU); our unity provides a solid basis \r\nfor the achievement of this goal. \r\n Bosnia and Herzegovina places special emphasis \r\non regional and subregional cooperation and dialogue \r\nbetween neighbouring countries in the Balkans, with \r\ntheir different cultures and traditions that have been \r\npresent for centuries. We are committed to future \r\ncooperation with our neighbours, based on the \r\nprinciples of mutual respect and respect for sovereignty \r\nand territorial integrity. We are interested in sharing \r\nour experiences with others and in developing mutually \r\nbeneficial relations in post-conflict peacebuilding, \r\nbased on mutual respect for differences, which, in our \r\nopinion, represent an advantage. \r\n I would like to take this opportunity to emphasize \r\nthat the issues of neighbourly and regional cooperation \r\nare closely related to the integration of Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina into the EU and NATO, which is a \r\nstrategic and high-priority foreign policy objective for \r\nmy country. We believe that this is the best and only \r\nway to ensure stability, security, economic \r\ndevelopment and prosperity for all citizens of Bosnia.  \r\n The strategic goal of establishing formal relations \r\nand EU membership is based on the aspiration of \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina to achieve the full functioning \r\nof our own institutions and the further development of \r\nsociety, on the basis of the principles of a free market, \r\nthe rule of law and, especially, the protection of human \r\nrights. \r\n Furthermore, my country wishes to improve its \r\nrelations with the States of Asia, Africa, Latin America, \r\nAustralia and the wider region, at the multilateral and \r\nbilateral level, in accordance with common interests \r\nand real possibilities. Bosnia and Herzegovina remains \r\ndedicated to the principle of openness in cooperation \r\nwith all countries of the world. \r\n Many important world events have occurred since \r\nthe previous session of the General Assembly. Bosnia \r\nand Herzegovina is following with great attention, \r\npreoccupation and concern the development of the \r\nsituation in the friendly Arab countries that are affected \r\nby deep social and political changes. Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina supports democratic processes aimed at \r\nthe creation of free, democratic and prosperous \r\nsocieties. However, such processes are often followed \r\nby tragic consequences, and we therefore appeal once \r\nagain for the violence to stop and for peace to be \r\nachieved in those societies. \r\n We are deeply concerned by the standstill in \r\ncrisis resolution in the Middle East. Despite the \r\noptimistic announcements and plans made, the peace \r\nprocess has not yet been revived, as had been expected. \r\nThe only way forward is a solution that is based on the \r\nprinciple of the peaceful coexistence of two sovereign \r\nStates: a viable and independent Palestine and a stable \r\nand secure Israel, with respect for the provisions of \r\nA/66/PV.12  \r\n \r\n11-50702 14 \r\n \r\ninternational law and humanitarian law and human \r\nrights instruments. \r\n To date, the United Nations has supported and \r\nactively participated in the creation of a positive \r\natmosphere in order to reach a just, comprehensive and \r\nlasting peace in the Middle East. Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina believes that the conditions for a lasting \r\nand just solution can be achieved with additional \r\npolitical will and responsibility on the part of the \r\nnegotiating parties. \r\n We are witnesses to the fact that the international \r\ncommunity’s determination to deal with terrorism and, \r\nat the same time, create conditions conducive to the \r\npeaceful development of Afghanistan has yielded \r\nresults. However, we cannot but conclude that it will \r\ntake much greater efforts to establish self-sustaining \r\npeace and stability in Afghanistan. In April 2010, as a \r\nsign of support for the activities of the international \r\ncommunity, Bosnia and Herzegovina issued a decision \r\non the sending of an infantry unit to the International \r\nSecurity Assistance Force mission in Afghanistan. \r\n I would like to emphasize here that Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina is still very concerned about terrorist \r\nattacks, which claim innocent civilian lives in many \r\ncountries around the world. Bearing in mind the fact \r\nthat the modern world continues to face various forms \r\nof international terrorism, I express our support for the \r\nfull implementation of the United Nations Global \r\nCounter-Terrorism Strategy and the activities of the \r\nCounter-Terrorism Committee. In that regard, let me \r\nreiterate that Bosnia and Herzegovina is \r\nunconditionally dedicated to the fight against terrorism \r\nand is particularly active in cooperating with the \r\ncountries of our region to increase security and \r\nenhance preparedness for the effective prevention of \r\nterrorist acts. Completing negotiations and adopting a \r\nUnited Nations comprehensive convention against \r\nterrorism would be an important contribution in this \r\nfield. \r\n In addition to the political crisis, this year we are \r\nfaced once again with many other problems to which \r\nthe international community still lacks proper and \r\neffective responses. Despite signs of recovery, the \r\ngreatest economic and financial crisis in recent history \r\nhas, unfortunately, left visible consequences that are \r\nhaving repercussions on global peace and security. It is \r\nclear that countries individually cannot cope with this \r\nissue, no matter how efficient their Governments may \r\nbe. Global crises require global solutions. \r\n In the context of the activities of the United \r\nNations, we must face the fact that the greatest \r\neconomic crisis since the foundation of the world \r\nOrganization has to some degree threatened and even \r\nbegun to bring into question the achievement of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, one of the most \r\ncomprehensive strategic tasks set by the Organization \r\nsince its establishment. \r\n Therefore, it is necessary to do everything in our \r\npower, individually and collectively, in order to \r\nprevent any further erosion of this key strategic \r\nproject. We believe that it is necessary for the \r\ninternational community, especially the United \r\nNations, to redouble its efforts to assist primarily the \r\nleast developed countries. \r\n The climate change problem caused by human \r\nactivity is leading to changes in the environment that \r\ncould have catastrophic consequences for humankind \r\nas a whole if the process of reaching agreement on \r\nenvironmental protection is not intensified. \r\n Bosnia and Herzegovina shares the concern of the \r\nmost States Members of the United Nations at the fact \r\nthat drought, floods, sea-level rise, lack of running \r\nwater and food, deforestation and all the other \r\nphenomena caused by global warming pose a serious \r\nthreat to global security, which in future could be a \r\ncause of conflict throughout the world. The extremely \r\nimportant issue of climate change therefore requires \r\nurgent action by the international community. Bosnia \r\nand Herzegovina has expressed interest in joining the \r\ncountries that support the Copenhagen Accord; thus \r\nour country has joined the large number of States \r\nMembers of the United Nations that consider that \r\nAccord to be a necessary step in relation to Kyoto until \r\nthe achievement of a final, legally binding agreement. \r\n Bearing this in mind, I believe that neither \r\neconomic nor political interests should stand in the \r\nway of achieving a global consensus as the beginning \r\nof the global and common struggle to preserve the \r\nnatural balance of the planet. It is often forgotten that \r\nclimate change has a direct effect in terms of \r\ndevelopment, poverty and hunger, and, consequently, \r\nglobal peace and security. I am convinced that it is in \r\nour common interest to ensure that future generations \r\ninherit the best possible world on our common home, \r\nplanet Earth. \r\n A/66/PV.12\r\n \r\n15 11-50702 \r\n \r\n I hope that all of us who are here today agree that \r\ncomprehensive United Nations reform is necessary; \r\nsuch reform must be carried out with extreme care, \r\nwith the broadest possible consensus on the part of \r\nMember States. Bosnia and Herzegovina sees the role \r\nof the United Nations and its agencies as central to \r\nresolving key issues of international significance. \r\nTherefore, it supports the Secretary-General’s efforts \r\nand proposals for reform. \r\n United Nations reform should lead to the efficient \r\nand coordinated functioning of all agencies and bodies \r\nof the United Nations system, bearing in mind the need \r\nto avoid any duplication of activities in the context of a \r\nmore rational allocation of financial resources. \r\n Regardless of the future configuration of the \r\nSecurity Council, we believe that the Eastern European \r\ngroup of countries must have another non-permanent \r\nseat, taking into account the fact that in the past two \r\ndecades the number of countries in this group has more \r\nthan doubled. \r\n While presiding over a subsidiary body of the \r\nSecurity Council — the Informal Working Group on \r\nDocumentation and Other Procedural Questions — \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina set the consideration of the \r\nworking methods and transparency of the Security \r\nCouncil as a primary goal. Bosnia and Herzegovina \r\nalso organized several informal meetings in \r\ncooperation with partner countries and the General \r\nAssembly, at which States Members of the United \r\nNations expressed their opinions and views and put \r\nforward concrete proposals for improving the \r\nefficiency of the Security Council. \r\n I wish to emphasize in particular that it is \r\nexpected that the United Nations, particularly the \r\nSecurity Council, be more active in the area of \r\npreventive diplomacy. We believe that in order to make \r\nthe work of the Council more efficient, greater activity \r\nin this respect would provide a starting point for \r\nresolving many of the world’s problems and crises \r\nbefore they flare up. Providing timely and effective \r\nconflict prevention, rather than reacting once the crisis \r\nhas escalated, is certainly a more efficient and less \r\nexpensive mechanism for preserving peace and \r\nsecurity. \r\n During the six decades of its existence, the \r\nUnited Nations has undergone ordeals but it always \r\nwas and still is the best framework for seeking and \r\nproviding adequate responses to the wide range of \r\nglobal issues that we face. Therefore, I urge Member \r\nStates to work for the full implementation of all our \r\nagreements in order to make the world a better place \r\nfor our future generations. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Chair of the Presidency \r\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina for the statement he has \r\njust made. \r\n Mr. Željko Komšić, Chair of the Presidency of \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Bharrat Jagdeo, President of the \r\nRepublic of Guyana \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nGuyana. \r\n Mr. Bharrat Jagdeo, President of the Republic of \r\nGuyana, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Bharrat Jagdeo, President \r\nof the Republic of Guyana, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly. \r\n President Jagdeo: Allow me first to convey to \r\nthe President my warmest congratulations on his \r\nelection to guide the work of the sixty-sixth session of \r\nthe General Assembly. I have no doubt that under his \r\nleadership, Qatar will be instrumental in the service of \r\nhis presidency, and, indeed, in that of the Assembly as \r\na whole, as we face the challenging times ahead. I also \r\nrecognize the service of his predecessor and wish to \r\nrecord our appreciation for that service. To our \r\nSecretary-General, I offer my delegation’s \r\ncongratulations on the renewal of his mandate, an act \r\nthat bears testimony to the confidence placed in him by \r\nthe Member States of this body. \r\n This is the last time that I will address this great \r\nHall as President of my country. Before the end of the \r\nyear, I will be proud to be the first President of Guyana \r\nto demit office under the constitutional term limits that \r\nI signed into law in the early days of my presidency. \r\nInevitably, that milestone has caused me to look back \r\non the changes that have taken place in this body since \r\nI first stood here 12 years ago. Three things strike me \r\nA/66/PV.12  \r\n \r\n11-50702 16 \r\n \r\nas I reflect on the role of the United Nations over those \r\n12 years. \r\n The first is that the central point that I and others \r\nhave repeatedly made from this rostrum stays as true \r\ntoday as it was when we first articulated it. The core \r\npoint is that, while the values that inform the work of \r\nthe United Nations and our Member States — the \r\nvalues of peace, equality and justice — are timeless, \r\nthey are of limited use unless we, as the United Nations \r\nand as individual Member States, draw on them to \r\ncatalyse consistent, meaningful and practical responses \r\nto the contemporary changing challenges that our \r\npeoples face. \r\n The second point that strikes me is how utterly \r\ndifferent today’s contemporary challenges actually are \r\nwhen compared with those of just 12 years ago, not to \r\nmention those of the 1940s, when the United Nations \r\nwas founded. The rise of China, India, Brazil and other \r\ndeveloping countries is transforming the globe for the \r\nbetter. Billions of people have been lifted out of \r\npoverty; new businesses are generating millions of \r\njobs, growth and capital; and there is once again \r\ngenuine intellectual debate about the right way to \r\nembed rights and justice at the core of the global \r\ngovernance structure. \r\n However, the emergence of those great Powers is \r\nhappening in a totally different way to how Powers \r\nemerged in the past. They are emerging in a world that \r\nis interconnected through instant communications \r\ncapabilities and globalized trading and financial \r\nsystems. What we are witnessing is unlike anything \r\nthat has happened before, and few communities and no \r\ncountry on the planet are not impacted, almost in real \r\ntime, by those changes as they happen. \r\n That presents the United Nations and its Member \r\nStates with a great opportunity to realize our values \r\nand to secure the global peace, justice and security to \r\nwhich we aspire. But to do so, we must face up to the \r\nopportunities of interconnectedness with responses that \r\nare interconnected. Our record on international \r\ncollective action in recent years is not good. \r\n That leads me to my third point, which is that the \r\nsearch for justice and the achievement of rights for all \r\nrequire us to broaden our traditional understanding of \r\nsecurity. We must struggle to achieve rights in a new \r\nway and, as many have said before me, alongside the \r\nphysical security challenge, there are many other \r\naspects to human security and the realization of rights. \r\nI think that there are four other elements of security, in \r\nparticular, that we need to properly understand. \r\n First is the challenge of food security. We are \r\nheading for 8 billion, then 9 billion people. Rising \r\nprosperity means that those people want greater \r\namounts of, and more nutritious, food. By current \r\ntrends, we need 100 million hectares of new land by \r\n2020 to meet that demand. How do we do that and \r\navoid excessive price increases and volatility? \r\n Second is the challenge of energy security. As the \r\nworld gets richer, our demand for energy increases \r\nmassively. We are likely to demand 36 per cent more \r\nenergy by 2035. How do we generate the energy \r\nneeded to meet such demand in a way that helps people \r\neverywhere to develop and does not choke off \r\neconomic growth through high prices caused by energy \r\nscarcity? \r\n Third is the challenge of resource security. If we \r\nare to alleviate poverty, countries need to develop. And \r\nif countries are to develop, they need minerals and \r\nother commodities. China alone accounts for more than \r\na third of the demand for many of the most important \r\nglobal commodities, and countries across the world, \r\nmost notably in South America and Africa, can supply \r\nthem. How do we help global development by sourcing \r\nsuch minerals and using them efficiently and justly? \r\n Fourth is the challenge of climate security. If we \r\nare to avert the biggest economic and social \r\ncatastrophe ever seen, we must stabilize our planet’s \r\nclimate. At the absolute limit, that means stabilizing \r\nglobal temperatures at a maximum of two degrees \r\nabove pre-industrial levels. Yet we are on track towards \r\nperhaps a four- or five-degree rise, according to the \r\nUnited Nations Environment Programme. The disaster \r\nthat this could represent is beyond anyone’s \r\ncomprehension. And the fact that we are not treating it \r\nas an emergency will be viewed by history as the \r\nbiggest derogation of responsibility by societies and \r\nGovernments to ever take place. How can we rapidly \r\nchange that situation before we run out of time? \r\n Those four challenges represent both \r\nopportunities and difficulties. The difficulties are \r\nobvious, but they are opportunities in the sense that we \r\nhave enough land, innovation and human ingenuity to \r\nfeed the world. We have enough clean energy potential \r\nto power future prosperity. We have enough resources \r\nto provide the foundations for economic growth. We \r\nknow that to avert climate change means using fossil \r\n A/66/PV.12\r\n \r\n17 11-50702 \r\n \r\nfuels and land in the right way. Once we start realizing \r\nthose opportunities, we can create new platforms for \r\npeace, development and physical security. \r\n That sounds an impossible task, but I would \r\nargue that it is not. There are solutions to enable those \r\nopportunities to be grasped today, and the United \r\nNations can provide the platform for making the \r\nchanges that are needed. We can do that if we draw \r\nmotivation from the realization that the idea of \r\nintegrated sustainable development, where we optimize \r\nour response to the interlinked security challenges, is \r\nnot some abstraction for environmentalists. It is not a \r\npiece of rhetoric about a theoretical better future. \r\nInstead, it is an essential and specific call to action that \r\nhas the potential to be the key global breakthrough of \r\nour time. It can change the global paradigm of \r\ndevelopment in a way that enables us to address the \r\ninterconnected security challenges we face in the world \r\ntoday.  \r\n Pursuing this integrated response to our global \r\nchallenges presents unparalleled opportunities for \r\npeoples across today’s developing world. The food we \r\nneed, the energy we generate, the minerals and other \r\ncommodities from which we grow our economies, \r\nalong with our forests and other land that can be the \r\ndrivers of climate solutions, are all largely in the \r\ndeveloping world. With the right international action, \r\nthe developing world can lead the globe in the creation \r\nof the transformational shift we need to see.  \r\n Importantly, within the United Nations, we \r\nalready have many of the entities we need to solve \r\nthese problems in an integrated way. That realization \r\nshould motivate us to understand that by next year’s \r\nUnited Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, we can start to make the progress that is \r\nnecessary. \r\n But that means consistency in our efforts to \r\naddress all forms of insecurity. We need to support \r\npeaceful peoples everywhere to assert their basic rights \r\nto physical security and development. The global \r\nresponse to the Arab Spring and other peace \r\nmovements across the Middle East has been \r\nremarkable for its inconsistency. Guyana supports the \r\nright of the Palestinian people to full statehood and \r\nurges the acceleration of the negotiations to achieve \r\nthis. Palestinian rights and blood are as valuable and \r\nimportant as those of people everywhere else. I urge all \r\nMembers to support the draft resolution when it comes \r\nbefore this body. \r\n Guyana was delighted to co-sponsor resolution \r\n65/308 that resulted in the entry of South Sudan into \r\nthis General Assembly. But we need to do much more. \r\nGuyana will be supportive of all peoples who struggle \r\nfor democracy and dignity. \r\n This also means that we need to rapidly upgrade \r\nour response to supporting development, food, energy \r\nand resource security. We need to see the Doha trade \r\nround not as some zero-sum game between the \r\ndeveloped and developing world, but as a critical \r\ncomponent to enable the world to meet the urgent \r\nchallenges that an increasingly prosperous, growing \r\npopulation will present. We need to redouble our \r\nefforts to meet the Millennium Development Goals, \r\nand to defeat non-communicable diseases. Guyana \r\ntherefore welcomes this week’s meeting on \r\nnon-communicable diseases and the adoption of the \r\nPolitical Declaration (resolution 66/2, annex). \r\n Finally, we need to move beyond the global \r\ninsanity that is our response to climate insecurity. \r\nExisting pledges on greenhouse gas emissions under \r\nthe Copenhagen Accord will not contain global \r\ntemperature rises within limits that will avert \r\ncatastrophic climate change, and some States will face \r\nextinction. Moreover, the anaemic delivery on financial \r\npledges made at Copenhagen and formalized in the \r\nCancún agreements is leading to a disastrous \r\nbreakdown in trust between the developed and \r\ndeveloping world. The prospects for reaching an \r\ninternationally legally binding agreement on climate \r\nchange at the seventeenth Conference of the Parties to \r\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange in Durban, South Africa, would appear rather \r\nbleak. There is therefore an urgent need for high-order \r\npolitical leadership to re-energize the climate change \r\nprocess and deliver credible results. \r\n To address these challenges, the United Nations \r\nand other international institutions need to modernize \r\nfast, and the international system needs to correct the \r\ninconsistencies between aid, trade and climate policies \r\nas I have outlined. In part, this means making the \r\nSecurity Council more democratic, transparent and \r\nlegitimate. Fifty-four African countries have no \r\npermanent seat on the Council; neither do the \r\n33 countries that comprise the Latin American and \r\nCaribbean region. Guyana strongly supports early \r\nA/66/PV.12  \r\n \r\n11-50702 18 \r\n \r\nreform of the Security Council through an expansion in \r\nboth the permanent and non-permanent categories and \r\nenhanced representation of developing countries. \r\n Today’s developed world needs to catch up with \r\nthe realization that the world has changed, and it is in \r\nits vital national interests to change its approach to \r\ndevelopment issues. Food security is not just about \r\npeople in poor countries; prices in Europe and the \r\nUnited States are rising too. Energy insecurity will hit \r\ntoday’s developed countries and destroy their \r\ncompetitiveness as rapidly as it will hit the developing \r\nworld. Resource insecurity is already driving up \r\nimported inflation in many developed countries and \r\nelsewhere. Climate insecurity could be the tipping \r\npoint for today’s Powers to be relegated to history, with \r\nall the suffering that would entail for their peoples. \r\n So the narrative is changing and I hope that we \r\nwill rise to the challenge. From now on, I will watch \r\nthe proceedings in this Hall from afar, but for all of my \r\ninvocations to the United Nations to do better, it \r\nremains the place where noble ambitions are pursued. I \r\nwish the United Nations and its Members all the best \r\nfor a secure, prosperous and socially just future. On \r\nbehalf of my country and people, I express our full \r\nsupport for the Organization and for strengthening its \r\ncapacity to better fulfil the many mandates entrusted to \r\nit. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Guyana for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Bharrat Jagdeo, President of the Republic of \r\nGuyana, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Elbegdorj Tsakhia, President  \r\nof Mongolia \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of Mongolia. \r\n Mr. Elbegdorj Tsakhia, President of Mongolia, \r\nwas escorted into the General Assembly Hall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Elbegdorj Tsakhia, \r\nPresident of Mongolia, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly. \r\n President Tsakhia (spoke in Mongolian; English \r\ntext provided by the delegation): My delegation offers \r\nPresident Al-Nasser its warm congratulations on his \r\nunanimous election as President of the General \r\nAssembly at the current session and pledges its \r\nunconditional support and cooperation in the discharge \r\nof his onerous responsibilities. \r\n I wish to extend my sincere congratulations to the \r\nSecretary-General on his well-deserved re-appointment \r\nand express my deep appreciation for his role in \r\nenhancing the role of the world Organization as a \r\npromoter of peace, security and development. His \r\nunanimous re-election to his high post is a testimony to \r\nhis outstanding leadership of the United Nations over \r\nthe past five years and a vote of strong confidence in \r\nhis future endeavours. \r\n On behalf of the people of Mongolia, I warmly \r\nwelcome South Sudan as the 193rd Member of the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n Today the international community finds itself in \r\ntimes of uncertainty. The recovery from the economic \r\nand financial crisis has been uneven and sluggish. Its \r\nsocial repercussions have been intensified by persistent \r\nunemployment and poverty in many countries. Major \r\nnatural disasters occur all too often. Unprecedented \r\nchallenges stemming from climate change continue and \r\nremain unaddressed. \r\n The world’s population will reach 7 billion next \r\nmonth, and it is a cause of great concern that over a \r\nbillion still suffer from hunger. The global economic \r\nand financial crisis grossly affected our drive to \r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals. A number \r\nof international negotiations and mediation efforts on \r\nconflict resolution have yet to produce results. \r\n In today’s globalized world, these challenges \r\nrequire collective solutions. To this end, the existing \r\ngovernance structure ought to be improved and \r\nreformed. The involvement of international \r\norganizations is critical to this process. The thematic \r\ndiscussions on enhancing the role of the United \r\nNations in global economic governance and dialogues \r\nwith the Chairman of the Group of 20, held during the \r\nsixty-fifth session of the General Assembly, were the \r\nfirst important step. What we need to do now is to \r\nenhance the role and status of the United Nations, \r\nincluding the Economic and Security Council, in global \r\neconomic decision-making. \r\n A/66/PV.12\r\n \r\n19 11-50702 \r\n \r\n It has also become imperative to ensure full and \r\non-time delivery of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs) and to formulate the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda. That agenda should help ensure \r\nthe meaningful integration of developing countries into \r\nthe world economy, taking into account the \r\nvulnerabilities of landlocked least-developed countries \r\nand those susceptible to desertification and climate \r\nchange. The Doha Development Round of multilateral \r\ntrade negotiations, stalled for the past decade, has yet \r\nto produce positive results towards this end. \r\n Every sixth Member of the United Nations is a \r\nlandlocked developing country whose remoteness from \r\nworld markets and high transport costs are a major \r\nimpediment to its development. Along with other \r\nmembers of this group, Mongolia is endeavouring to \r\nadvance our common interests at the United Nations \r\nand in the World Trade Organization. The creation of \r\nan international think tank for landlocked developing \r\ncountries, to be set up in Ulaanbaatar, will \r\nunquestionably contribute to greater cooperation in the \r\nimplementation of the Almaty Programme of Action \r\nand our relevant MDGs. I therefore call on all the \r\nrelevant parties to sign and ratify the multilateral \r\nagreement establishing this institution, which will be \r\nvitally important to landlocked developing countries. \r\n Last year, we reviewed our progress in achieving \r\nthe MDGs and agreed to strengthen the partnership. \r\nYet, as was shown in the most recent MDG Gap Task \r\nForce report, significant gaps remain in delivering on \r\ncommitments in the areas of aid, trade, debt relief and \r\naccess to new technologies. For Mongolia, 66 percent \r\nof our MDGs are achievable by 2015. But our goals \r\nrelating to poverty, environmental degradation and \r\ngender inequality are seriously off-track and will \r\nrequire stepped-up action on the part of the \r\nGovernment and the enhancement of our bilateral and \r\nmultilateral partnerships if we are to meet these \r\nchallenges. \r\n Mongolia has been implementing targeted \r\npolicies and activities aimed at poverty reduction. \r\nAlcoholism is one of the serious social ills associated \r\nwith poverty. As President, I initiated a nationwide \r\nmovement aimed at stopping alcohol abuse, curbing its \r\nconsumption and encouraging abstinence that has \r\nenjoyed wide public support. With a view to \r\nencouraging such movements in other countries, it \r\nmight be useful to look into the possibility of \r\npromulgating an international convention aimed at \r\nreducing alcohol consumption. \r\n Climate change, drought, land degradation and \r\ndesertification have emerged as some of the gravest \r\nchallenges facing humankind. Yesterday’s High-level \r\nMeeting on desertification marked an important step \r\nforward in finding collective solutions to these \r\nchallenges. It is a matter of great concern that 2 billion \r\npeople and about 50 per cent of agricultural land \r\naround the globe are affected by desertification, land \r\ndegradation and drought. We should therefore set up an \r\nintergovernmental panel to conduct a comprehensive \r\nstudy on the effects of these phenomena and to identify \r\naction-oriented recommendations for affected \r\ncountries. \r\n We look forward to the seventeenth Conference \r\nof the Parties to the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change, to be held in Durban, \r\nSouth Africa, later this year, to discuss a significant \r\nreduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the \r\ndevelopment of green economies. I believe that the \r\nglobal transition to a green economy is critically \r\nimportant for mitigating climate change and halting \r\ndesertification, land degradation, ecosystem \r\ndestruction and the loss of biodiversity, and that these \r\nin turn will help reduce poverty. \r\n Financial assistance and expertise are vital to \r\ndeveloping countries, including my own, in their \r\nefforts to develop a green economy through the \r\nintroduction of green technologies and by building \r\nnational capacity in energy production, construction \r\nand agriculture. I trust that the United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development will produce \r\nresults that can take us further down this road. As a \r\ncountry highly vulnerable to the impact of climate \r\nchange, Mongolia is supportive of global efforts to \r\ncombat its negative effects. With that in view, \r\nMongolia will host the Asia-Europe Environment \r\nMinisters’ Meeting on Sustainable Water and Forest \r\nManagement in 2012. \r\n The past year has witnessed dramatic \r\ntransformations. The Arab Spring has brought freedom \r\nto millions, but it is far from over. The revolution for \r\nfreedom is not the hardest social change to make. \r\nBuilding and developing a free, open and fair civic \r\nsociety is even more difficult. That is what our \r\nancestors taught us, and these lessons have been \r\nreinforced during our own democratic transformation \r\nA/66/PV.12  \r\n \r\n11-50702 20 \r\n \r\nover the past 20 years. Let me cite here the visionary \r\nteaching of the founder of the great Mongolian State, \r\nChinggis Khaan, who was rightly chosen as the Man of \r\nthe Millennium. Chinggis Khaan once said that \r\nconquering the world on horseback is easy; it is \r\ndismounting and governing that is much harder. The \r\nrevolution for freedom is fought and won by the \r\ncombined efforts of thousands of people. However, in \r\none way or another, it is each and every person who \r\npays the price for freedom. It is my firm belief that \r\nnotwithstanding any challenges it faces, freedom is the \r\nfuture of all humankind. \r\n Beginning in July, Mongolia assumed the \r\nhonourable and responsible duties of President of the \r\nCommunity of Democracies, an organization geared to \r\npromoting and strengthening democratic norms and \r\nvalues around the world. During its presidency over the \r\nnext two years, Mongolia will give priority to \r\npromoting education for democracy and good \r\ngovernance, eliminating corruption, building \r\npartnerships with civil society and consolidating \r\nregional cooperation. \r\n Over the past 20 years of our own democratic \r\nchanges, Mongolia has fundamentally transformed its \r\nformer political, social and economic systems and laid \r\ndown all the necessary foundations for new democratic \r\ngovernance, promoting and protecting a market \r\neconomy, free elections, freedom of the press and civil \r\nsociety. We feel rightly proud of these \r\naccomplishments. \r\n We are fully aware, however, that many things \r\nare far from perfect and that a lot more must be done to \r\nnurture democratic values in every citizen. Most of all, \r\nwe must consolidate accountable and transparent \r\ngovernance, free from corruption and secured by an \r\nindependent judiciary. Such governance should be \r\nmore responsive to the needs of ordinary citizens, serve \r\nthem, abide by the rule of law and the principle of \r\nimpartiality, and have proper checks and balances. In \r\nshort, we are striving to develop a system of \r\ngovernance that values its people and treats them with \r\ndignity and respect. \r\n To address these challenges and threats to \r\ndemocracy and an open society, we are implementing a \r\nMongolia-specific MDG 9 on democratic governance, \r\nhuman rights and zero tolerance for corruption. Within \r\nthis goal, we are endeavouring to make our governance \r\nopen and transparent; hence our full support for the \r\nOpen Government Partnership initiative. I would also \r\nlike to call on all Member States attempting to improve \r\ntheir governance at the national level to join the Zero \r\nTolerance for Corruption Campaign. \r\n The Arab Spring will be followed by the Arab \r\nChallenge. Although the democratic process is a \r\nhomegrown phenomenon, it should be supported by \r\ninternational cooperation. Here, I have a message for \r\nthe industrialized democratic countries: Do not \r\nwithdraw from the battle. Democratization does not \r\nmean Westernization, however. Democracy should \r\ndevelop naturally, in line with the historical, cultural \r\nand development specifics of a given country. \r\nNonetheless, respect for freedom, justice and human \r\nrights and strict observance of the rule of law are \r\ncommon to all successful and responsible democracies. \r\nBad governance is the worst problem of all, and any \r\naspirations to improve and streamline it should \r\ntherefore be strongly supported at all times. \r\n Libya has entered a new era as a result of the \r\nrelentless courage and patience of the rebels, who \r\npersevered for many months in their struggle for \r\nfreedom, human rights and democracy. Colonel \r\nAl-Qadhafi called his fellow countrymen “rats” who \r\nshould be brutally hunted down and exterminated. Now \r\nhe himself is being hunted like a rat from hole to hole \r\nand trench to trench. That is the fate that awaits anyone \r\nwho represses people’s love for freedom and their \r\ndesire to live in dignity. Respectful of the aspirations \r\nof the Libyan people, Mongolia has recognized the \r\nNational Transitional Council and offers its full support \r\nto Libya’s transition towards democracy, justice and \r\nhuman rights. \r\n The international community should not shy \r\naway from condemning the regime of Syria’s Bashar \r\nAl-Assad, who has inhumanly and brutally chosen the \r\nway of bloodshed to crack down on peaceful, freedom- \r\nand justice-craving protesters by using combat \r\nvehicles, snipers and military force. Let us \r\nunanimously demand that he end his atrocities. We \r\nmust make the necessary decision to that effect without \r\ndelay, and help the courageous people of Syria, who \r\nare losing dozens of their brave sons and daughters \r\nevery day. \r\n The love of freedom is the greatest force in this \r\nworld. No tyranny, not even the cruellest regime, can \r\nresist it forever. I direct these words to the authorities \r\n A/66/PV.12\r\n \r\n21 11-50702 \r\n \r\nof Yemen and dictators seeking to suppress their \r\ncitizens’ fight for freedom. \r\n It was a timely decision to make “The role of \r\nmediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful \r\nmeans” the main theme of this general debate. The \r\nmain purpose of the United Nations is to settle disputes \r\nby peaceful means. We commend the skilful diplomacy \r\nof the Secretary-General and his envoys in resolving \r\ndisputes and conflicts in various corners of the world. \r\nMember States need to work together to strengthen the \r\nUnited Nations capacity to that end. \r\n North-East Asia is a region where mediation \r\nactivities can be vigorously pursued. The region still \r\nlacks a formal mechanism for building confidence and \r\nstrengthening regional cooperation. Therefore, we \r\nbelieve that Mongolia’s proposal to set up a permanent \r\nmechanism to promote peace and stability in North-\r\nEast Asia remains valid. We are ready to consult with \r\nrelevant countries to move forward with out proposal. \r\n On 11 September 10 years ago, terrorists tore \r\ndown the twin towers, but they failed to tear down the \r\nspirit of freedom they represented, and they will never \r\nsucceed in doing that. Mongolia stands with the \r\ninternational community in its fight against terrorism \r\nas a party to all of the United Nations conventions to \r\ncombat terrorism. \r\n We need to reinvigorate our resolve to attain a \r\nworld free of nuclear weapons and to exploit nuclear \r\npower solely for peaceful purposes. We were reminded \r\nof the urgency and importance of strengthening the \r\nsafety and security of nuclear reactors by the tragic \r\naccident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant \r\nlast March. \r\n We commend the Secretary-General’s initiative to \r\nhold a high-level meeting tomorrow to strengthen \r\ninternational measures for nuclear safety and security \r\naround the world. The 2010 Review Conference of the \r\nParties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons gave renewed impetus for expanding \r\nnuclear weapon-free zones around the world. The \r\nproposed nuclear weapon-free zone in the Middle East \r\nwould contribute to the promotion of world peace. \r\n Mongolia continues to work on further \r\nstrengthening its internationally recognized nuclear \r\nweapon-free status. To this end, we are holding \r\nconsultations with nuclear Powers. From the highly \r\nesteemed rostrum of the General Assembly, I would \r\nlike to underscore that there should be no doubt that \r\nMongolia will never accede to the dumping of nuclear \r\nwaste on its territory. It should go without saying that, \r\nin today’s world, any attempt to enforce such decisions \r\nwould undoubtedly fail. \r\n It is of historic importance to us that the \r\nobservance of the fiftieth anniversary of Mongolia’s \r\njoining this global Organization coincides with this \r\nsession of the General Assembly. On 27 October 1961, \r\nMongolia became a full Member of the United Nations. \r\nIt has opened new frontiers of active engagement with \r\nthe international community for the global good. \r\nFurthermore, this year Mongolia is marking the \r\n2,220th anniversary of its statehood, centenaries of \r\nregaining its independence and the establishment of a \r\nmodern diplomatic service, as well as the ninetieth \r\nanniversary of the people’s revolution. \r\n Over the past five decades, cooperation between \r\nMongolia and the United Nations has expanded both in \r\nscope and substance. Today Mongolia is a party to \r\nmore than 240 multilateral conventions and enjoys \r\nmembership in over 110 international organizations. \r\nUnited Nations assistance and cooperation have been \r\ninstrumental in developing human resources and \r\ncapacity-building, developing education, health and \r\ninformation technology, reducing poverty and \r\ndeveloping an adequate response to natural disasters. \r\n For its part, Mongolia has also endeavoured to \r\ncontribute where it could to the joint efforts of the \r\ninternational community. My delegation is pleased to \r\nrecall that, at the initiative of Mongolia, the General \r\nAssembly adopted the Declaration on the Rights of \r\nPeoples to Peace, the principles and guidelines for \r\ninternational negotiations, resolutions on the annual \r\nobservance of Disarmament Week, the United Nations \r\nLiteracy Decade and resolutions relating to \r\ncooperatives, rural women and landlocked developing \r\ncountries. Mongolian troops have courageously served \r\nin the blue United Nations helmet in many hotspots \r\naround the world, including in the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo, Western Sahara, South Sudan, \r\nEritrea, Georgia, Sierra Leone, Chad and Darfur. \r\n All in all, over the past five decades Mongolia \r\nhas been faithful to its obligations under the Charter \r\nand striven to be an active Member State. We stand \r\nstrongly committed to further contributing to the \r\nmultifaceted activities of the United Nations. I am \r\npleased to announce our decision to present our \r\nA/66/PV.12  \r\n \r\n11-50702 22 \r\n \r\ncandidature for a non-permanent seat on the Security \r\nCouncil for the term 2023-2024 at the elections to be \r\nheld at the seventy-seventh session of the General \r\nAssembly, and humbly seek members’ valuable \r\nsupport. \r\n The contribution and leadership of the United \r\nNations in maintaining international peace, security \r\nand promoting sustainable development continue to \r\ngrow. In this respect, I call on the General Assembly to \r\ndevelop relevant solutions and decisions at this session \r\naimed at supporting the aspirations of countries and \r\npeoples to better livelihoods. \r\n The day-to-day activities of the United Nations \r\nare of paramount importance to the cause of creating a \r\nsafe, free and just life for humankind, in which \r\neveryone may enjoy integrity and dignity. We are \r\nconfident that the United Nations will succeed in its \r\ncontinued reform efforts to this end. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of Mongolia \r\nfor the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Elbegdorj Tsakhia, President of Mongolia, \r\nwas escorted from the General Assembly Hall.  \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Jacob Zuma, President of the \r\nRepublic of South Africa  \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will hear \r\nan address by the President of the Republic of South \r\nAfrica. \r\n Mr. Jacob Zuma, President of the Republic of \r\nSouth Africa, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Jacob Zuma, President of \r\nthe Republic of South Africa, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly. \r\n President Zuma: On behalf of the Government \r\nand the people of South Africa, I wish to extend our \r\nsincere congratulations to Ambassador Nassir \r\nAbdulaziz Al-Nasser on his election as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. We wish him a successful tenure in \r\nthe stewardship of this body and assure him of our \r\ndelegation’s full support. We also congratulate his \r\npredecessor, Mr. Joseph Deiss, for the diligent manner \r\nin which he guided the work of the Assembly at its \r\nsixty-fifth session. \r\n I would further like to take this opportunity to \r\ncongratulate Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his re-appointment as \r\nSecretary-General. \r\n It is also an honour for South Africa to welcome \r\nthe Republic of South Sudan to the community of \r\nnations as the 193rd State Member of the United \r\nNations. \r\n This month, the United States and the world \r\nmarked the tenth anniversary of the horrendous \r\nterrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, which affected \r\nthe United States and 89 other countries. That horrific \r\nincident united the international community and \r\nstrengthened its resolve to cooperate in the fight \r\nagainst terrorism. We pay our respects to the victims of \r\nthe tragedy and their families. We reaffirm our \r\ncommitment to working with other Member States to \r\neradicate terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. \r\n The theme of this session — “The role of \r\nmediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful \r\nmeans” — is timely and well chosen. The Charter of \r\nthe United Nations mandates the Organization to \r\nutilize mediation as one of the tools to prevent and \r\nresolve conflicts across the globe. The role of \r\nmediation as a tool for the settlement of disputes has \r\nrenewed relevance today, given the number of conflicts \r\nin the world. We should defend the independence and \r\nimpartiality of the United Nations and promote the \r\nprinciples of its Charter during conflicts and crises. \r\nThe United Nations should never take sides in any \r\nconflict but should always maintain its impartiality. \r\nThe United Nations must not allow itself to be used by \r\nany country, regardless of its history or size. All \r\ncitizens of the world should feel confident and secure \r\nin the knowledge that the United Nations is above all \r\npartisan interests and serves only those of the citizens \r\nof the globe. \r\n We are of the view that regional organizations \r\nplay a crucial role in the resolution of conflicts and in \r\nregional mediation processes. The Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations itself provides for the role of regional \r\norganizations in cooperation with the United Nations. \r\nThis role of the regions must always be enforced and \r\nenhanced, and not undermined. In our continent, the \r\nAfrican Union (AU) continues to play a significant role \r\nin mediation and the resolution of conflicts, trying at \r\n A/66/PV.12\r\n \r\n23 11-50702 \r\n \r\nall times to produce African solutions to African \r\nproblems, of course with the support of the world. \r\n This year, the world witnessed the so-called Arab \r\nSpring in North Africa and the Middle East. With \r\nregard to the situation in Libya, the AU played a \r\ncrucial role in seeking a peaceful solution to the crisis, \r\nin line with its mandate of working for peace and \r\nstability in the continent. However, it is a matter of \r\nrecord now that the AU efforts were never given a \r\nchance. Military actions were preferred over peaceful \r\nmeans. \r\n Nonetheless, the AU continues to be seized with \r\nthe Libyan conflict, as it should be. South Africa, \r\nthrough the AU and the United Nations, will work with \r\nthe National Transitional Council, the representative of \r\nthe Libyan people, as it proceeds to form an inclusive \r\ntransitional Government that will take the Libyan seat \r\nin the African Union. During this period of working \r\ntowards normalcy in Libya, we call for a cessation of \r\nhostilities and an end to the NATO aerial \r\nbombardment. We also call for the lifting of the no-fly \r\nzone, whose imposition was necessary for the \r\nprotection of civilians. \r\n The proliferation of arms in Libya is a major \r\nconcern. The transitional Government will need to be \r\nsupported in addressing this security issue. It may pose \r\na serious challenge affecting the entire subregion if it is \r\nnot adequately attended to. We also urge the new \r\nLibyan authorities to ensure the protection of migrant \r\nworkers, especially those from sub-Saharan African \r\ncountries, who number approximately 2.5 million. \r\nImmediate measures should be taken to put an end to \r\nthe killing, arbitrary arrest and detention of migrant \r\nworkers and black Libyans. \r\n We will fully support the people of Libya as they \r\ngo through the transition towards a new, united and \r\ndemocratic Libya that protects human rights, human \r\ndignity and freedom. \r\n South Africa continues to support international \r\nefforts to assist the people of Palestine and Israel to \r\nfind lasting peace. The decades-old struggle of the \r\nPalestinian people for a sovereign State of their own \r\nhas now reached a turning point. The Palestinian \r\nAuthority, backed by the League of Arab States, has \r\nstated its intention to seek United Nations membership \r\nfor the State of Palestine. South Africa fully supports \r\nthis position. It is a decisive step towards achieving \r\nlasting peace, economic cooperation and prosperity for \r\nthe millions of people in the Middle East, and we urge \r\nthat it be viewed favourably. \r\n We also support the ongoing struggle for self-\r\ndetermination of the people of Western Sahara. We \r\nurge the international community to support their quest \r\nfor freedom, human rights and dignity. \r\n We reiterate our call for the lifting of the \r\neconomic and financial embargo against the people of \r\nCuba in order to help them gain their economic \r\nfreedom. \r\n All Member States have a duty to safeguard the \r\nfuture and relevance of the United Nations. Recent \r\ninternational developments have made more urgent our \r\nefforts to intensify the reform agenda of the United \r\nNations, particularly the Security Council, as well as \r\nthe Bretton Woods institutions. No reform can be \r\ncomplete without the substantive reform of the \r\nSecurity Council, whose membership must be \r\nconsistent with the principle of equitable geographical \r\nrepresentation. In this regard, we reiterate our call for \r\nAfrica to be represented in the category of permanent \r\nmembership of the Security Council. \r\n South Africa is preparing to welcome the \r\ninternational community and all stakeholders to the \r\nseventeenth session of the Conference of the Parties to \r\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange and to the seventh Meeting of the Parties to the \r\nKyoto Protocol, in November and December this year. \r\nThe success of the Conference is highly dependent on \r\nthe willingness of all parties to reach an agreement. It \r\ndoes not depend on South Africa alone. As leaders, we \r\nare accountable to the global citizenry, the ordinary \r\npeople that suffer daily from the impacts of climate \r\nchange. They hold high expectations of their leaders to \r\nbe responsible and to find effective solutions to the \r\nthreat that climate change poses to their livelihood, \r\nquality of life, dignity and, in many cases, their very \r\nsurvival. We dare not fail them. \r\n We are witnessing the catastrophic effects of \r\nfamine in Somalia and neighbouring countries. Our \r\nresponse should not be left to the United Nations alone; \r\nit requires united action from all of us. South Africa \r\nhas been humbled to contribute in a small way to the \r\nalleviation of human suffering. The people of Somalia \r\nstill need more support, and we urge the world to focus \r\nits attention more sharply on Somalia and its \r\nneighbours in the Horn of Africa. \r\nA/66/PV.12  \r\n \r\n11-50702 24 \r\n \r\n It is commendable that the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and their realization by 2015 \r\ncontinue to feature on the agenda of the General \r\nAssembly. We now have four years to go before we \r\nreach the target date. It is clear that many of the Goals \r\nwill not be attained on time, particularly in \r\nsub-Saharan Africa. We call on the international \r\ncommunity and the United Nations to redouble efforts \r\nto assist countries that are lagging. \r\n At this session, we will be commemorating the \r\ntenth anniversary of the adoption of the Durban \r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action — the outcome \r\ndocument of the World Conference against Racism, \r\nRacial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related \r\nIntolerance, which was held in Durban in 2001. Racism \r\nand racial discrimination continue to pose a challenge \r\nto humankind and to negate the principles of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. We should continue to \r\nwork together to eradicate the scourge of racism. \r\n On 8 January 2012, the African National \r\nCongress (ANC), the oldest liberation movement in \r\nAfrica, will mark 100 years of existence since its \r\nestablishment in 1912. The ANC spearheaded the \r\nstruggle against racial oppression, colonialism and \r\napartheid in South Africa. It inspired many in the \r\nAfrican continent to fight for their freedom and \r\nindependence from colonialism. \r\n The United Nations declared apartheid a crime \r\nagainst humanity and in that way endorsed the struggle \r\nagainst racial oppression in our country. The centenary \r\nof the ANC recognizes the immense contribution of the \r\nUnited Nations and the international community in \r\nworking to eradicate racism and racial discrimination \r\nin the world. We will, tomorrow, host a symposium on \r\nSouth Africa’s contribution to the fight against racism \r\nand racial discrimination. \r\n Working together, let us remain committed to \r\nmultilateralism and cooperation in this session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and beyond, and promote the \r\nrealization of a more equitable and just world. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof South Africa for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Jacob Zuma, President of the Republic of \r\nSouth Africa, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.  \r\nAddress by Mr. Andris Bērziņš, President of the \r\nRepublic of Latvia  \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nLatvia. \r\n \r\n Mr. Andris Bērziņš, President of the Republic of \r\nLatvia, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Andris Bērziņš, President \r\nof the Republic of Latvia, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly. \r\n President Bērziņš: At the outset, I wish to \r\ncongratulate Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on his \r\nassumption of the post of President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-sixth session. I assure him of the \r\nfullest cooperation of the Latvian delegation. I also \r\ncongratulate the Secretary-General on his re-appointment \r\nto his honourable post for a second term. I wish him the \r\ngreatest success and strength in guiding the Organization \r\nand the Secretariat in all their complex tasks. \r\n I warmly welcome the State of South Sudan as \r\nthe 193rd Member of the United Nations. \r\n Latvia has always supported strengthening the \r\nUnited Nations as the only truly universal international \r\norganization. However, the United Nations must \r\nchange and adapt to the new realities in order to deliver \r\nthe best results and sustain its influence. The \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly and the reform \r\nof other principal organs are essential so that the \r\nUnited Nations can keep pace with the modern realities \r\nin the world and to make the whole of its work more \r\neffective. That will allow consistent adherence to the \r\nprinciples of sound budgetary discipline and a fair \r\ndistribution of expenses among the Member States.  \r\n In the context of the global economic slowdown, \r\nwe welcome the initiative of the Secretary-General to \r\ncut the United Nations budget for 2012-2013 by 3 per \r\ncent, and we look forward to a constructive discussion \r\non that matter. \r\n The reform of the Security Council is long \r\noverdue. We call on all partners to work sincerely on \r\nthis important issue. Latvia is ready to assume greater \r\ninternational responsibility and is planning to engage \r\n A/66/PV.12\r\n \r\n25 11-50702 \r\n \r\nmore actively in the Council’s work by putting forward \r\nits candidature for a non-permanent seat. \r\n This year marks the twentieth anniversary of \r\nLatvia’s joining the United Nations, after regaining \r\nindependence. In those 20 years we have undergone a \r\ncomplete transformation. From a Soviet-occupied \r\nEuropean country with no trace on the political map, \r\nLatvia has re-emerged as a country with stable \r\ndemocratic institutions and membership in the United \r\nNations, the European Union and NATO. From a \r\nclosed, regulated system we have developed an open, \r\nliberal market economy. From a totalitarian regime we \r\nhave grown into a democratic society where the rule of \r\nlaw and human rights are respected. Now we are able \r\nto share our transformation experience by helping other \r\ncountries in their own development. \r\n Important changes, often called the Arab Spring, \r\nhave started in North Africa and the Middle East. \r\nPeople have gone to the streets demanding democratic \r\nreforms and influence on the future development of \r\ntheir countries. The international community has to \r\nsupport those aspirations and assist in building stable \r\nand trusted democratic institutions and establishing the \r\nrule of law. \r\n We welcome the timely reaction of the United \r\nNations to the events in Libya, such as the Security \r\nCouncil’s decision to provide humanitarian and \r\nsecurity assistance and to refer the case to the \r\nInternational Criminal Court. Latvia has recognized the \r\nNational Transitional Council of Libya and supported \r\nthe General Assembly decision to allow the Council to \r\nrepresent Libya at this session. Joint action is crucial, \r\nand we hope that the United Nations, in collaboration \r\nwith relevant regional actors, will continue to play a \r\nleading role in Libya. \r\n We support the Security Council presidential \r\nstatement regarding the events in Syria \r\n(S/PRST/2011/16) and the Human Rights Council \r\ndecision to urgently dispatch a special mission to Syria \r\n(A/HRC/RES/S-16/1). The message is clear: violations \r\nof human rights and the use of force against civilians \r\nare totally unacceptable and strongly condemned by \r\nthe international community. We look forward to an \r\nappropriate follow-up on this issue in the Security \r\nCouncil. \r\n Today the international community has a historic \r\nresponsibility to make the Middle East a safer, more \r\nprosperous and more democratic place to live. We must \r\nsupport the Middle East peace process with the goal of \r\ntwo States, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in \r\npeace and security. Latvia strongly encourages both \r\nsides to resume dialogue without delay. Sustainable \r\npeace is possible only if the Israelis and the \r\nPalestinians reach an agreement that takes into account \r\nthe legitimate interests of both sides. The international \r\ncommunity — the United Nations, the Quartet, the \r\nArab League and others — should act together to help \r\nboth sides to return to the negotiation table. \r\n Turning to sustainable development, I would like \r\nto stress that we have a responsibility to future \r\ngenerations for the preservation of the natural \r\nenvironment in the world. That responsibility includes \r\nan obligation to ensure that the resources available to \r\nus now are used in the most appropriate ways.  \r\n In order to address the challenges posed by \r\nclimate change, joint global action is needed with \r\nregard to emissions reduction and global warming. \r\nLater this year, the next United Nations Climate \r\nChange Conference, in Durban, will take important \r\ndecisions. Any proposed agreement on climate change \r\naction should be a reasonable compromise that is \r\nacceptable for the majority of participating Parties and \r\ndoes not exclude any of the major economies. \r\n In order to achieve sustainable development, \r\nprotecting the environment and preserving a healthy \r\nsociety are most important. However, in the twenty-\r\nfirst century we face a new challenge: non-communicable \r\ndiseases. We commend the High-level Meeting on the \r\nPrevention and Control of Non-communicable \r\nDiseases and the adoption of the Political Declaration \r\n(resolution 66/2, annex). We hope that we will have an \r\neffective follow-up process. \r\n The economic crisis has reminded us that we live \r\nin an interdependent world. We are deeply worried by \r\nthe level of uncertainty and volatility in international \r\ntrade and financial markets. The primary responsibility \r\nfor prudent governance is at a national level. However, \r\nin the current situation the international community \r\nmust once again act together and find sustainable \r\nstabilization measures in order to prevent another \r\ndownturn in the global economy. \r\n My country, Latvia, was one of those hit first and \r\nhard by the crisis but now is among the countries that \r\nare steadily recovering. Our gross domestic product is \r\ngrowing again and unemployment is falling. The \r\nrecovery of the Latvian economy can teach us several \r\nA/66/PV.12  \r\n \r\n11-50702 26 \r\n \r\nsimple lessons. First is the importance of acting \r\nquickly and decisively in adopting austerity measures. \r\nSecondly, in order to carry out structural reforms, there \r\nis a strong need to communicate and to engage with \r\nsociety. The third and final lesson, of course, is the \r\nvalue of international solidarity. \r\n We face a large number of transnational threats, \r\nincluding terrorism. This year, we commemorate the \r\ntenth anniversary of the tragic terrorist attacks of \r\n11 September 2001. We express our solidarity and \r\nsympathy with the victims of 9/11 and others who have \r\nbeen affected by terrorism all over the world. \r\n As we combat terrorism, we must also analyse its \r\nroot causes. Our aim in Afghanistan is to help to \r\nstabilize the security situation and to build local \r\ndemocratic institutions. That will empower the Afghan \r\nGovernment to take over responsibility for security \r\nthroughout the country by 2014. A sustainable solution \r\nin Afghanistan can be found only if regional actors, \r\nincluding the Central Asian countries, are part of the \r\nprocess. Joint action is needed to unlock economic \r\nopportunities, to strengthen regional security \r\ncooperation and to develop infrastructure and transport \r\ncorridors in order to connect Afghanistan with the \r\nregion and the rest of the world. \r\n In addition to the role of the United Nations in \r\nmaintaining international peace and security, the \r\nimportance of regional organizations is increasing. In \r\nthat context, we draw attention to the protracted \r\nconflicts in Europe in Transdniestria, Abkhazia, South \r\nOssetia and Nagorno-Karabakh. Regional \r\norganizations — in this case, the EU and the \r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in \r\nEurope — must continue working to seek peaceful \r\nsolutions. Good cooperation with the United Nations is \r\ncrucial. \r\n In that regard, let me emphasize the principled \r\nand consistent position of Latvia and the EU in \r\nsupporting the peaceful settlement of conflicts and \r\nvalues such as democracy, the rule of law and the \r\nprotection of human rights. Those lie at the core of the \r\nEU foreign policy strategy. \r\n This year, we carried out the review process of \r\nthe functioning of the main United Nations human \r\nrights body — the Human Rights Council. Latvia saw \r\nthat review process as a unique opportunity to improve \r\nthe performance and credibility of that important body. \r\nWe took note of the outcome of the review process \r\n(resolution 65/281, annex). However, we believe that \r\nmuch more could have been done to enable the Council \r\nto live up to the expectations of countries and people. \r\n Latvia believes that members of the Human \r\nRights Council must lead by example through full \r\ncommitment to the promotion and protection of human \r\nrights. Latvia attaches the greatest importance to that \r\ncommitment by putting forward its candidacy for the \r\nHuman Rights Council elections in the year 2014. \r\n Challenges to global security, development and \r\nhuman rights can be overcome only by our joint \r\nefforts. Latvia looks forward to a fruitful sixty-sixth \r\nsession of the General Assembly. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Latvia for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Andris Bērziņš, President of the Republic of \r\nLatvia, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n  The meeting rose at 6.05 p.m. \r\n"
