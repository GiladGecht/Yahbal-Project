His long \r\nexperience at the United Nations augurs well for our \r\nwork.  \r\n I also acknowledge the outstanding work of \r\nMr. Joseph Deiss of Switzerland, the outgoing \r\nPresident. Our delegation worked very closely with \r\nMr. Deiss, and we can testify to his exceptional \r\ncommitment to the United Nations and his immense \r\ncapacity for work. \r\n I also salute Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. I \r\nreiterate our appreciation of his management, and \r\ncongratulate him on his re-election for a second five-\r\nyear term. I thank him for the support he has given to \r\nmy country and Central America, shown especially by \r\nhis recent visit to Guatemala. \r\n My presence at every General Assembly session \r\nduring the four years of my presidency testifies to our \r\nbacking for the United Nations and our gratitude for its \r\nsupport. \r\n This occasion is unique, for two reasons.  \r\n First, I can tell the Assembly about the \r\nachievements of my Administration over the past four \r\nyears and also about some pending issues. Secondly, I \r\ncan report that just 10 days ago the first round of \r\ngeneral elections was held in my country, in a calm, \r\nnormal climate with broad citizen participation, thus \r\nconsolidating our progress towards a democratic and \r\nparticipatory society. \r\n Let me then start with a few words about the \r\nprogress made in Guatemala, despite the exceptional \r\nobstacles created by the international financial crisis of \r\n2008-2009, a severe political crisis in Guatemala in \r\n2009 that was overcome in compliance with the rule of \r\nlaw and truth revealed by investigations, and the \r\nimpact of three major natural disasters, which led to a \r\n109-day state of emergency, as well as historical \r\nchallenges that we face now and shall face in the \r\nfuture. \r\nA/66/PV.13  \r\n \r\n11-50847 2 \r\n \r\n I shall sum up in a few words the significance of \r\nmy period in office, as follows. \r\n First, my Administration gave priority to the \r\nindividual by dealing with social issues that had not \r\nbeen addressed for 50 years. We have tried to reduce \r\npoverty and extreme poverty, with tangible results, \r\nespecially through our social cohesion programmes, \r\nparticularly conditional transfers of cash to mothers of \r\nextremely poor families — more than 940,000 families. \r\n Second, space was recovered for the State in \r\nareas previously dominated corporately by private \r\ninterests. \r\n Third, we began to contain and reverse a \r\nshocking escalation of the criminal violence that had \r\nstarted in earlier periods, by reorganizing the security \r\nforces and promoting policies that confronted, instead \r\nof coexisting with, organized crime. \r\n Fourth, in accordance with those measures, we \r\nrecovered whole territories previously dominated by \r\ndrug traffickers, particularly the Mayan biosphere in \r\nthe northern Department of Petén, consisting of more \r\nthan 138,000 hectares; 48,000 head of cattle were \r\nexpelled from the area, and the Government has \r\nretaken control of it. Unprecedented seizures of drugs \r\nhave taken place. In three and a half years we have \r\nseized $12 billion, the equivalent of almost two \r\nnational budgets. By comparison, over the eight-year \r\nperiod before my Government came to power scarcely \r\n$1 billion was seized. \r\n However much we do in the Central American \r\nregion, Mexico and Colombia, it is essential that drug \r\nconsumption be controlled. Drug-consuming countries \r\nmust accept co-responsibility for the daily killings in \r\nour countries, and for the uncontrolled sales of arms \r\nentering it. They must take co-responsibility for the \r\ncontrol of money-laundering and of arms, which bring \r\ndeath to our region, and for the control of factories \r\nproducing chemical precursors for drug production. \r\nResponsibility must be taken for the destination of the \r\nproducts and arms. \r\n We cannot control organized crime in Central \r\nAmerica without the support of Mexico and Colombia. \r\nWe can win the battle only if the consumer markets do \r\ntheir share. We cannot go on shedding blood and being \r\nwounded by bullets. That is unfair. The consumer \r\nmarkets must assume true co-responsibility. \r\n Fifth, a series of wide-ranging policies was \r\nadopted to gain greater transparency. They included the \r\ncreation of the Secretariat for Transparency and the \r\nadoption of a law on public information. \r\n Sixth, the energy matrix was renewed and \r\nupgraded to make it more environmentally sound and \r\nto counter the effects of the rising cost of \r\nhydrocarbons. \r\n Seventh, we promoted two major economic \r\ncorridors in poverty-stricken regions. In addition, the \r\nconstruction of the Northern Transversal Strip will \r\nunite the Mexican State of Chiapas with our neighbour, \r\nHonduras, and Polochic. \r\n Eighth, we pursued a dynamic foreign policy, \r\nputting the Central American region on a new footing \r\nand making possible a closer understanding with our \r\nneighbours of Latin America and the Caribbean. I shall \r\nreturn to this matter a little later. \r\n Ninth, municipal power was given full respect \r\nand strengthened, being recognized as a fourth power \r\nin the democratic system. \r\n Tenth, the independence of the different branches \r\nof the State was faithfully respected. \r\n Finally, while everything that I have described \r\nwas achieved we preserved and improved a solid, \r\nstable macroeconomic system. Guatemala is one of the \r\nthree countries that had no shrinkage of their economy \r\nduring the financial crisis. \r\n Some important topics require the participation of \r\nevery State institution; we need legislation by the \r\nCongress of the Republic and rulings by the \r\ninstitutions that constitute the country’s judicial \r\nsystem. Among other matters, I wish to refer to the \r\nstruggle we have waged against impunity, experienced \r\nin Guatemala for many years. Seven of the most \r\nwanted drug traffickers, who are known to all \r\nGuatemalans, are now in jail, awaiting trial. The \r\nGovernment has initiated trials for crimes against \r\nhumanity committed during our 36-year civil war, \r\nwhich ended in 1996. Sentence has already been passed \r\nin some cases, and other trials are continuing. \r\n Here I wish to highlight the crucial role played by \r\nthe United Nations through the International \r\nCommission against Impunity in Guatemala, a unique \r\nUnited Nations exercise which enjoys the strong \r\nsupport of not only my Government, but also \r\n A/66/PV.13\r\n \r\n3 11-50847 \r\n \r\nGuatemalan civil society. We are pleased that the \r\nCommission’s mandate has been extended for two \r\nmore years, until September 2013. We recognize the \r\nsignificant achievements it has recorded since its \r\nestablishment. \r\n Among the main challenges facing us, I wish to \r\nmention the following. \r\n First, despite the progress in social matters, we \r\nmust acknowledge how much remains to be done to \r\neliminate poverty and raise the level of wellbeing of \r\nthe Guatemalan population. There were many years of \r\nneglect, especially of the most vulnerable, such as \r\nchildren, single mothers, and a disproportionate part of \r\nthe indigenous population.  \r\n I am convinced that the actions taken should be \r\ninstitutionalized through social cohesion programmes \r\nand presidential programmes. That will require a \r\nsubstantial fiscal transformation to provide the State \r\nwith the necessary funds. It should be recognized that \r\nthat is not possible without the support and \r\nparticipation of Congress, even where the Central \r\nGovernment promotes it, as in my case.  \r\n In economic matters we need a revival of \r\nproductive activities in a framework of financial \r\nstability and fiscal reform compatible with financing \r\nfor development. \r\n Secondly, due to our geographical location, \r\nGuatemala has become an important transit point for \r\nillicit activities, including drug trafficking and human \r\ntrafficking, both of which are increasingly in the hands \r\nof transnational organized crime. We have made \r\nstrenuous efforts to deal with them and to address the \r\npublic demand for improved security for every citizen.  \r\n It is essential to have regional and international \r\ncooperation. Member countries of the Central \r\nAmerican Integration System have adopted a historic \r\nCentral American Security Strategy, which was jointly \r\npresented, with the support of the Governments of \r\nColombia and Mexico, to the international community \r\nat an international conference held in Guatemala on \r\n22 and 23 June. The main point is that we have acted \r\nforcefully, but that it is imperative to implement the \r\n22 projects that need funding. \r\n Here I recall the words of President Calderón of \r\nMexico at the June conference, when he asked what \r\npeace there would be in Central America, and Mexico \r\nand Colombia, if we were north of Canada; if we \r\nsimply changed our geographic position we would \r\neliminate the problem of drug trafficking. Once again I \r\nstress the co-responsibility of the drug-consuming \r\nmarkets. \r\n Thirdly, it is difficult to promote development \r\nwhen we repeatedly face severe natural disasters, \r\nwhich recently have been occurring at a rate of at least \r\none a year. This can be attributed, at least in part, to \r\nclimate change, given the high vulnerability of Central \r\nAmerica to the effects of this phenomenon. Therefore, \r\nit is imperative that humanity close ranks in defence of \r\nour common habitat: our planet. So far, progress has \r\nbeen minimal. We urge the international community to \r\nredouble efforts to take tangible steps at the next \r\nConference of the Parties to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change, to be held \r\nin Durban, South Africa, in December. \r\n In my previous statements to the Assembly, I \r\nhave concluded with references to our foreign policy, \r\nespecially as it affects, or is impacted by, the United \r\nNations agenda. \r\n My Government has developed an active foreign \r\npolicy, which includes strengthening the integration \r\nprocess in the framework of the Central American \r\nIntegration System. We are confident that, as part of \r\nthat active policy, in some three weeks we shall attain \r\none of our main objectives at the multilateral level — \r\nGuatemala’s election by the General Assembly to a \r\nnon-permanent seat on the Security Council for the \r\nnext biennium. This will renew our commitment to the \r\nUnited Nations, and also strengthen our foreign policy, \r\nexposing us to a broad and complex diplomatic agenda. \r\nWe shall carry out our work with responsibility and \r\nindependence, and with respect for the principles and \r\nvalues enshrined in the Charter.  \r\n I thank our regional group, the Latin American \r\nand Caribbean Group, for endorsing our candidature, \r\nand I thank all Member States in advance for the \r\nsupport that I trust we shall receive when new \r\nmembers are elected to the Security Council. \r\n The central theme of the session is mediation. I \r\nreiterate our full commitment to strengthening \r\npreventive diplomacy and the instruments that the \r\nUnited Nations possesses to prevent conflicts. In this \r\ncontext, we can even accept sanctions regimes, \r\nprovided that they come about as a result of collective \r\ndecisions taken by the Security Council.  \r\nA/66/PV.13  \r\n \r\n11-50847 4 \r\n \r\n The other side of the coin is that we reject \r\nsanctions and coercive measures taken unilaterally. In \r\nthis regard, we urge the Government of the United \r\nStates of America to abandon the economic embargo of \r\nthe Republic of Cuba. We believe that such a step \r\nwould have many favourable consequences in both \r\ncountries.  \r\n We are following closely, and with hope, the \r\nevents affecting several countries of North Africa, \r\nwhich will give a greater voice to their peoples. \r\nClearly, it is up to them to decide their own destiny. \r\n But in the midst of the current turbulent situation, \r\nit is not possible to delay a solution to the secular \r\nconflict resulting from the confrontation between the \r\nState of Israel and its neighbours. We support the \r\ncreation of a viable and prosperous Palestinian State \r\nliving in peace and harmony, behind secure and \r\ndefensible borders, side by side with the State of Israel. \r\nWe understand that the international community can \r\ntake part in the process of fulfilling that vision, as \r\nindeed is happening through the so-called Quartet \r\ncomprising the United States, the Russian Federation, \r\nthe European Union and the United Nations, but its \r\nrealization is up to the two parties — Israel and \r\nPalestine — and should be achieved through direct \r\nnegotiations to resolve all outstanding issues. \r\n We reiterate our commitment to the relaunching \r\nof the regional integration process of the Central \r\nAmerican Integration System to bring about even \r\ncloser relations with our neighbours of the Caribbean \r\nand Latin America, and we enthusiastically support the \r\ncreation of the Community of Latin American and \r\nCaribbean States. \r\n In another crucial area, we regard as an important \r\nstep towards resolving our age-old territorial dispute \r\nwith Belize the signing of the Special Agreement, \r\nwhich, when the domestic juridical processes are \r\nconcluded, will enable both countries to seek a legal \r\nsolution through the International Court of Justice. I \r\nam pleased to report that the Congress of Guatemala \r\nhas approved the Agreement unanimously. The next \r\nstep will be to submit it to a national referendum. \r\n In the ancestral Mayan calendar today is the day \r\nof balance, the day of dawn, the day that the \r\nGuacamaya sings, announcing the coming of a new \r\ndawn. Today we have come together to witness a new \r\ndawn. It should be the dawn of peace, the dawn of less \r\npoverty, the dawn of harmony and above all the dawn \r\nof respect for fundamental human rights.  \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I thank the President of the Republic of \r\nGuatemala for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Álvaro Colom Caballeros, President of the \r\nRepublic of Guatemala, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Abdoulaye Wade, President of the \r\nRepublic of Senegal \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will hear \r\nan address by the President of the Republic of Senegal. \r\n Mr. Abdoulaye Wade, President of the Republic of \r\nSenegal, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Abdoulaye Wade, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Senegal, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly. \r\n President Wade (spoke in French): Senegal \r\nwelcomes the election of Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz \r\nAl-Nasser as President of the General Assembly to lead \r\nits work at this sixty-sixth session. Therefore, I address \r\nto him and his country my warm congratulations. He \r\nwill have the support of the Senegalese delegation \r\nthroughout his mandate. \r\n I also extend to the President’s predecessor, \r\nMr. Joseph Deiss, our appreciation for all his efforts to \r\nrevitalize and strengthen the General Assembly so that \r\nit may play its role under the Charter. \r\n In addition, I also reiterate to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-Moon, my warmest \r\ncongratulations on everything he has done for the \r\nOrganization. \r\n I should like to touch on the theme of the session, \r\nthe role of mediation in the settlement of disputes. The \r\nCharter has a number of provisions for the prevention \r\nof conflicts and for conflict-resolution. This goal, \r\nwhich was set down in the Charter 66 years ago by the \r\nfounding fathers, remains, despite evident progress, a \r\nlong way off. This challenge concerns us, just as it \r\nengages our collective and individual responsibility to \r\nsave current and future generations from the scourge of \r\nwar.  \r\n A/66/PV.13\r\n \r\n5 11-50847 \r\n \r\n While the spectre of a major conflict has faded \r\nsince the end of the Cold War, millions of men and \r\nwomen around the world continue to suffer the \r\ndisastrous consequences of conflicts old and new. \r\n Peace can be threatened in different ways. It can \r\nbe threatened when, on the fertile ground of political \r\nantagonisms and social, economic and religious \r\nconflicts, confrontation gains the upper hand over \r\ntolerance, respect and acceptance of our differences. \r\n Peace is also threatened when the legitimate \r\naspirations of peoples to freedom and respect for \r\nhuman rights find in response only indifference and \r\nrefusal of dialogue, if not systematic repression, as is \r\nthe case in a number of countries. \r\n Our theme, mediation, is addressed in the \r\nCharter, but there are similar notions, such as good \r\noffices and negotiations. I would like to contribute \r\nsomething by defining mediation as a mechanism \r\nwhereby a person, a State or an institution comes \r\nbetween two parties in real or potential conflict and \r\nseeks to bring their points of view closer together, with \r\na view to bringing the parties to make concessions and \r\nreach a consensus. That can apply to internal conflicts \r\nas well as conflicts between States. \r\n I wish to refer to resolution 37/10, of 1982, \r\napproving the Manila Declaration on the Peaceful \r\nSettlement of International Disputes, and the 1988 \r\nDeclaration on the Prevention and Removal of \r\nDisputes and Situations which May Threaten \r\nInternational Peace and Security and on the Role of the \r\nUnited Nations in this Field (resolution 43/51). To \r\nthese may be added the Agenda for Peace (A/47/277), \r\ndrafted after the first Security Council summit meeting, \r\nheld in January 1992, establishing a doctrine of \r\nso-called tension-prevention through early warning and \r\npreventive diplomacy. \r\n The fact is that by no stretch of the imagination \r\ncan our Organization alone do everything. We must \r\nconsider mediation efforts at other levels, such as the \r\nregional level. It is a pity that Africa has forgotten an \r\noriginal mechanism often used following \r\nindependence: meetings between Heads of State at \r\ntheir border to directly address their differences. \r\nUnfortunately, this good practice is falling out of \r\nfashion, with general international mechanisms being \r\nfavoured. \r\n In the two categories of mediation — within a \r\ncountry or between countries — we have very rich \r\nexperiences in West Africa. I shall limit myself to only \r\nmentioning them, because some are fairly well known.  \r\n For example, with regard to internal conflict, \r\nwhen I was head of an opposition party I personally \r\nintervened at the request of Heads of State, who \r\nappreciated that I had chosen a democratic internal \r\nopposition instead of armed national liberation \r\nmovements. I often succeeded in bringing together \r\npoints of view and even in integrating opposition into \r\nvarious Governments, which I did myself later by \r\nagreeing to enter the Government of the person who \r\nhad been my adversary in a number of elections. \r\n I can give the example of Guinea-Bissau, a matter \r\nresolved by a trio of Heads of State, of whom I was \r\none, which decided to travel to the country, which was \r\nin conflict with the army. Order was successfully \r\nre-established. The countries concerned were Nigeria, \r\nGhana and Senegal. More recently there was the \r\nIvorian crisis, which ended happily thanks to the \r\nEconomic Community of West African States \r\n(ECOWAS), supported by the United Nations and \r\nFrance. \r\n I could add the normalization of the situation in \r\nNiger and Guinea-Conakry through the mediation of \r\nECOWAS, which succeeded despite difficulties in \r\nestablishing an elected Government. I can also cite the \r\npeaceful declaration of independence of the State of \r\nSouth Sudan. I commend the representative of that \r\nbrother country here at the United Nations. \r\n There are of course other cases. The examples I \r\nhave given were just to show that at the regional level \r\nmany conflicts can be settled directly by States, \r\nsometimes with the assistance of an outside country, \r\nsuch as France, or with the assistance of the United \r\nNations. \r\n To conclude that list of countries, I want to say \r\nthat just a few days ago, as there is a threat of trouble \r\non the border between Liberia and Côte d’Ivoire, the \r\nPresident of ECOWAS convened a small group of \r\nneighbouring countries, and we were able, with the \r\nhelp of the United Nations, to establish a mechanism to \r\nprevent the intervention of mercenaries in Côte \r\nd’Ivoire who were seeking to enter Liberia to \r\ndestabilize the country during election time. \r\nA/66/PV.13  \r\n \r\n11-50847 6 \r\n \r\n Sadly, despite those successes, there are other \r\npotential conflicts, such as that which is harming \r\nrelations between Eritrea and Ethiopia, and the \r\npotential conflict in Darfur. \r\n I turn to mediation used in conflicts between \r\nStates. I shall take just one example: Palestine and the \r\nState of Israel. I commend all the efforts made over \r\nmany years to bring the two parties closer together, \r\nwhich unfortunately have not yet succeeded. So this \r\nyear we have an application by Palestine to the General \r\nAssembly for recognition as a Member State of the \r\nUnited Nations. There is no doubt about Senegal’s \r\nsupport for the application; it is the consequence of \r\nwhat has been our policy for a long time, particularly \r\nas today Senegal is Chairman of the United Nations \r\nCommittee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of \r\nthe Palestinian People. \r\n Senegal supports an independent Palestinian State \r\nwithin internationally recognized borders as well as the \r\nexistence of the State of Israel, each within its own \r\nborders. It will not be easy to achieve that, but the \r\ninternational community will do its very best. \r\n I take this opportunity to make a clarification, \r\nbecause, despite my proximity to the Arab countries \r\nand to the Palestinians, a few days ago a statement was \r\nmade about my playing the role of mediator in the \r\nIsrael-Palestine conflict. President Netanyahu’s \r\nunderstanding was mistaken. I have never been a \r\nmediator in the Palestine-Israel conflict and have never \r\nsought to be a mediator. Moreover, we need to do much \r\nmore than to call one country or one person to mediate \r\nin such a complicated situation. \r\n All goodwill is needed for a solution. Having \r\nbeen awarded the Houphouët-Boigny Peace Prize, I \r\nmust honour that distinction, so wherever I can \r\nintervene to find solutions I do so, on my own \r\nresponsibility. I intervened personally for the release of \r\na young soldier, Gilad Shalit, a few years ago.  \r\n Unfortunately, that was not successful, but on the \r\nbasis of a number of suggestions I took the initiative \r\nonce again some days ago. That seems to have had a \r\nreaction, in the light of what President Netanyahu said. \r\nHe said that he did not want mediation by Senegal, and \r\nthat Senegal was an ally of Palestine. But he was \r\nwrong. I do not do mediation; I provide good offices; I \r\ntake it on my own responsibility to help release one \r\nyoung man when I believe that that young man should \r\nbe elsewhere other than a prison and when I think that I \r\ncan convince the parties — above all, the Palestinian \r\nparties, the current Government of Palestine, Hamas — \r\nof the need to release that young man for humanitarian \r\nreasons.  \r\n If I succeed, excellent; if I fail, it will not stop me \r\nfrom starting over again. I will do that regardless of the \r\nposition of the two parties — in other words, \r\nregardless of the position of Israel and of the position \r\nof Hamas. That is consistent with my philosophy of \r\npeace and the choice that I have made to contribute to \r\nextending cooperation where I can. \r\n I believe that fear and mistrust, which persist \r\nbetween Israel and Palestine, could be mitigated — this \r\nis a simple suggestion that I make to our Secretary-\r\nGeneral — by establishing a committee of three States \r\nchosen by the two parties. Those States would hold \r\ndiscussions to discover what guarantees are demanded \r\nby each party to commit to the path of negotiation for \r\nthe existence of two States, the State of Israel and the \r\nState of Palestine, because at present, I believe, there is \r\nno dialogue, indirect or direct. I believe that my \r\nsuggestion could facilitate understanding of the \r\npositions on both sides and could help mitigate fears \r\nand concerns that are major psychological barriers to \r\ndiscussion and to any agreement. \r\n Maybe I am wrong. Maybe this will not end in \r\nanything, but it costs nothing to try. I say to the \r\nSecretary-General: “Before you reply ‘No’, I want you \r\nto consider my proposal for 40 days. If after that time \r\nyou think that it cannot help solve the problem, you \r\ncan say so. But I beg you to try to understand the \r\nproposal.” I am ready to go into further details, even in \r\na document. I have established this position, which \r\ncould ultimately be fine-tuned using other people’s \r\ncontributions. \r\n As I come to the end of my address I want to \r\ntouch on Security Council reform. The topic has kept \r\nreturning in a cyclical fashion for 18 years, and we \r\nhave made no progress, due to great confusion. \r\n The current Security Council system has certain \r\nadvantages. A Security Council, an international order, \r\nmust exist, but it must be improved. But in its current \r\nfunctioning the Security Council has a fundamental \r\nrole, which is to ignore the African continent. Even on \r\nrecent issues, such as Libya, Africa has no permanent \r\nseat with a right of veto.  \r\n A/66/PV.13\r\n \r\n7 11-50847 \r\n \r\n I will not speak of general reform of the Security \r\nCouncil. I know that it will not happen overnight. But I \r\nalso know that since its creation there has been a need \r\nto increase the number of seats, and there needs to be a \r\nbetter distribution. \r\n I call for the remedying of a historic injustice to \r\nAfrica. Seventy per cent of the issues on the Security \r\nCouncil agenda are African questions, and Africa is \r\nabsent, even on the question of Libya. Libya is an \r\nAfrican country. Therefore, it would be good to have \r\nan African country with a permanent seat on the \r\nSecurity Council with a right to the veto. I am not \r\ntalking about a non-permanent seat; it must be \r\npermanent.  \r\n We have made progress, because when a few \r\nyears ago I had discussions with members of the \r\nCouncil the majority thought that the idea was \r\nreasonable, if it could be detached from more general \r\ndemands. But each time we bring it up it is a case of \r\none step forward, two steps back. But we should not be \r\ndiscouraged. \r\n I come to my last point: the environment and the \r\nagricultural crisis. These are also issues of peace, \r\nbecause the environment is linked to climate change \r\naffecting particularly the developing countries, and \r\nabove all Africa. \r\n A few years ago a French philosopher wrote a \r\nfamous work, “L’Afrique, terre qui meurt”, in which he \r\nspoke of savannization and desertification, problems \r\nthat my own country suffers from. In the Sahel I find \r\nthat those words are particularly well based.  \r\n Above all, coastal erosion is accelerating. From \r\nMorocco to the Gulf of Guinea seawater is filtering \r\nthrough layers of the continental shelf deep into the \r\ncontinent — 480 kilometres — salinizating the water \r\ntable, with the result that the population is suffering an \r\nincreasing lack of drinking water. \r\n Marine erosion does not just mean that the coast \r\nis being eroded by the sea. It is destroying land in the \r\ninterior, and making populations emigrate towards \r\nareas where they can find potable water. It is \r\nhistorically one of the main mechanisms of \r\ndesertification. Sometimes whole populations are \r\nforced to go elsewhere. \r\n But we are not standing idly by. That is why we \r\nhave created the Great Green Wall, extending from \r\nDakar to Djibouti, 7,000 kilometres long and \r\n15 kilometres wide. That is why we called on the EU to \r\nfinance a study with European and African experts to \r\nfind a solution to the infiltration of marine waters into \r\nthe continental shelf. \r\n We have built part of the Atlantic wall in Senegal, \r\nbut only two kilometres, because one kilometre costs a \r\ngreat deal of money — $2 million. In depth it is to go \r\nas far as the granite plateau, at which point it can go no \r\nfurther. We do not want to take it too far, because in \r\nenvironmental matters it is important before doing \r\nanything to find out what the consequences elsewhere \r\nwill be.  \r\n That is why we need to analyse the matter in an \r\nentirely scientific way, since the forces of the sea that \r\nare stopped have not been negated; they are diverted by \r\nthe sand and liquids. The experts can clarify the \r\nsituation and help us, with full knowledge of the facts, \r\nuse our resources to end this degradation, which, sadly, \r\nis leading to the disappearance of a large part of our \r\ncontinent. The tsunami is not just the effect of huge \r\nwaves on a coast. It is also destruction that happens \r\nwithin our continent. I wanted to mention that \r\nphenomenon to draw attention to the great dangers \r\nthreatening Africa. \r\n Finally, we recently held the second International \r\nDakar Agricultural Forum to consider the rise in \r\nagriculture prices, from which even producing \r\ncountries are suffering, like us, because we are also big \r\nconsumers. The participants proposed the \r\nestablishment of an organization for global agricultural \r\ngovernance. We urge that the headquarters of such an \r\nimportant institution be in Africa, and not in a \r\ndeveloped country. There is no major organization of \r\nits kind with its headquarters in Africa. The \r\norganizations that are helping us need to be with us on \r\nthe ground.  \r\n The role of the proposed organization would be to \r\nregulate the prices of agricultural products and ensure a \r\nminimum income for small farmers. I commend our \r\ndraft resolution on the matter. The policy of the \r\norganization could be to play a role in reducing \r\nproductivity differentials. Why is productivity higher \r\nin the United States and Europe than in Africa — for \r\nexample, in Zimbabwe? We need to ask the question \r\nand find solutions. \r\n In Senegal, we have addressed the issue with a \r\nplan that we call the Grand Agricultural Offensive for \r\nFood and Abundance to deal with the productivity \r\nA/66/PV.13  \r\n \r\n11-50847 8 \r\n \r\ndifferentials between Senegal and certain Italian \r\nregions. It has allowed us to move from being, in 2007, \r\ndependent on others for food to the status of a country \r\nthat has achieved food self-sufficiency. This year we \r\nmay even be able to begin exporting, which is a \r\nremarkable achievement. \r\n I must say that we have been helped by chance, \r\nsince fertilizer constitutes at least 30 per cent of costs, \r\nand our fertilizer can be used directly, without any \r\npreparation. Moreover, friendly countries helped us \r\nacquire important equipment on very favourable \r\nconditions over a long term. \r\n The scope and complexity of the Organization’s \r\ntasks put in perspective its successes and its setbacks. \r\nBut what determines our commitment to the institution, \r\nwhat gives hope to the peoples that we represent here, \r\nwhat definitively gives them trust and faith in the \r\nOrganization, is the feeling that when it deliberates, \r\nwhen it decides and when it acts, it observes without \r\ndiscrimination the principles enshrined in the Charter: \r\nuniversality, legality, justice and impartiality. \r\n Finally, the extent to which those values are \r\nsafeguarded is the measure of the legitimacy and \r\nsuccess of our Organization’s interventions. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I thank the President of the Republic of \r\nSenegal for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Abdoulaye Wade, President of the Republic of \r\nSenegal, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Armando Emílio Guebuza, President \r\nof the Republic of Mozambique  \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will hear \r\nan address by the President of the Republic of \r\nMozambique. \r\n Mr. Armando Emílio Guebuza, President of the \r\nRepublic of Mozambique, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Armando Emílio Guebuza, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Mozambique, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly. \r\n President Guebuza (spoke in Portuguese; \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): We join \r\nprevious speakers in congratulating Mr. Nassir \r\nAbdulaziz Al-Nasser, of Qatar, on his election to \r\npreside over the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth \r\nsession. His long diplomatic experience makes us \r\nanticipate that our deliberations will be crowned with \r\nsuccess. We take this opportunity to assure him our full \r\nreadiness to contribute to the success of this session, \r\nand wish him well in the discharge of his duties. \r\n We extend our congratulations to the President’s \r\npredecessor, Mr. Joseph Deiss of the Swiss \r\nConfederation, on his commitment, pragmatism and \r\ndynamism in the conduct of the work of the sixty-fifth \r\nsession. \r\n We also congratulate Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his \r\nreappointment to the post of Secretary-General, which \r\ndemonstrates the recognition of Member States, and of \r\nthe international community as a whole, of his \r\ncommitment to the pursuit and consolidation of peace, \r\nsecurity and international development. We are \r\nencouraged that, thanks to his full commitment, we \r\nwill continue to work together, under the aegis of the \r\nUnited Nations, to find appropriate solutions to \r\ncommon problems facing humanity. \r\n We welcome the newest Member of the United \r\nNations, the Republic of South Sudan. With this sister \r\ncountry, we celebrated its independence and at that \r\ntime expressed our congratulations on this important \r\nmilestone. \r\n This session takes place at a critical stage of \r\nhuman history, characterized in particular by the \r\nimpact of the ongoing global financial and economic \r\ncrisis; the rising prices of food and oil; the resurgence \r\nof hotbeds of tension and political instability, \r\nparticularly in North Africa and the Middle East; the \r\nprevalence of pandemics such as malaria, tuberculosis \r\nand HIV/AIDS; and the increasing occurrence of \r\nnatural disasters. These challenges require a \r\nmultilateral approach in order to find consensual, \r\neffective and sustainable responses. \r\n Indeed, the negative impact of these complex \r\nphenomena, especially in developing countries, is a \r\npotential factor of political and social instability. It is \r\ntherefore necessary to focus on democratic principles \r\ngrounded on dialogue, inclusive governance, \r\naccountability and transparency and respect for human \r\nrights. \r\n A/66/PV.13\r\n \r\n9 11-50847 \r\n \r\n In this context, we commend the choice of theme \r\nfor the session: the role and importance of mediation \r\nfor the prevention of violent conflicts, for the pursuit \r\nof peaceful solutions and for the strengthening and \r\nconsolidation of mutual trust. Those are key factors for \r\nbuilding a solid and lasting peace. \r\n We all yearn for a better world in which peace \r\nand security, harmony and concord reign, a world in \r\nwhich everyone’s concern is to combat poverty, fight \r\nagainst epidemics and promote the welfare and \r\nprosperity of humankind. \r\n The proliferation of crises and the perpetuation of \r\ndissonant positions, rather than a search for solutions \r\nto the many problems that affect all humanity, make \r\nthis dream become increasingly difficult to achieve. \r\nTherefore, strengthening multilateralism and global \r\ngovernance by the United Nations is of critical \r\nimportance. \r\n This session takes place in the year in which the \r\nUnited Nations family recalls the fiftieth anniversary \r\nof the physical disappearance of Secretary-General \r\nDag Hammarskjöld. It is also 25 years since the \r\nassassination, by apartheid, of our late President \r\nSamora Moisés Machel. Those two personalities were \r\nlovers and defenders of peace, and they lost their lives \r\nwhen seeking peace for countries of our Mother Africa. \r\nIn honour of those great names and all those who gave \r\ntheir lives to mediation and preventive diplomacy as a \r\nmeans for the peaceful settlement of disputes, let us all \r\nreaffirm our commitment to peace, and redouble our \r\ncommitment in support of initiatives aimed at building \r\na world free of conflict. \r\n Mediation should be seen as an opportunity to \r\nbring together the parties to a dispute, reduce their \r\ndifferences and appeal to conscience so that together \r\nthey can move towards mutually acceptable peaceful \r\nsolutions. Mediation cannot be started with the \r\nassumption that we have all the answers; the mediation \r\nprocess should be conducted in an objective, impartial \r\nand neutral manner, ensuring the involvement of \r\nstakeholders at all stages and their ownership of the \r\nprocess. These are basic principles that ensure the \r\ncontinuity and consolidation of the process of national \r\nreconciliation and reconstruction, and, more important, \r\nthe building of mutual trust. \r\n Aware of these principles, Mozambique is proud \r\nto be part of some positive experiences in different \r\nmediation processes in southern Africa and the African \r\ncontinent as a whole. We have thus contributed to \r\nhelping other countries to return to the path leading to \r\nsocial and economic development. We therefore appeal \r\nfor appreciation of the mediation role of the United \r\nNations and regional and subregional organizations. \r\n The universality of the United Nations gives it a \r\nkey role in promoting international peace and security \r\nby resorting to peaceful means to settle disputes. In \r\nthis sense, the Organization is once again called upon \r\nto assume the responsibility entrusted to it in the \r\nCharter as a facilitator of mediation within the concert \r\nof nations, through its organs, in particular the Security \r\nCouncil and the General Assembly, as well as through \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission. \r\n We praise the progress made by the United \r\nNations, whose impact on prevention, mitigation and \r\nmediation of internal and inter-State conflicts has been \r\npositive. These achievements can be consolidated by \r\nstrengthening the relationship between the principal \r\norgans of the United Nations with a mandate to \r\nsafeguard international peace and security, as well as \r\ntheir relationship with regional and subregional \r\norganizations. \r\n We reaffirm our recognition of the role of the \r\nregional and subregional organizations as pillars in the \r\npromotion and maintenance of peace, security and \r\nstability through the use of preventive diplomacy and \r\nearly warning systems. \r\n The African experience has proved that the \r\nvarious regional and subregional mediation initiatives \r\nhave been effective in preventing and managing \r\nconflicts and tensions, and in maintaining regional \r\npeace and stability. In this context, we salute the \r\nsignature of the political road map leading to the return \r\nto constitutional order in Madagascar, the culmination \r\nof a negotiating process, mediated by the Southern \r\nAfrican Development Community, which started in \r\nAugust 2009. \r\n The United Nations remains the appropriate \r\nforum for addressing current challenges, including the \r\npeaceful resolution of disputes. However, in order to \r\nassume its role effectively, our Organization must \r\ncomplete the ongoing reforms.  \r\n In this sense, we reiterate the commitment of the \r\nRepublic of Mozambique to continue to provide \r\nrelevant input to the reform process, which helps the \r\nUnited Nations to become more proactive and effective \r\nA/66/PV.13  \r\n \r\n11-50847 10 \r\n \r\nin dealing with global issues, thus contributing to the \r\nconsolidation of its credibility and legitimacy, in the \r\ninterests of the peoples of the world. In this regard, we \r\nreiterate our interest in seeing the conclusion of the \r\nprocess of revitalization of the role and authority of the \r\nGeneral Assembly as a more representative and \r\nlegitimate body of the United Nations.  \r\n It is in this Assembly, where we are all \r\nrepresented and where every vote counts, that the most \r\nimportant decisions on the international agenda, \r\nincluding the peaceful and negotiated settlement of \r\ndisputes, should be taken and evaluated. Only a strong \r\nGeneral Assembly, endowed with the necessary \r\nauthority and competence and adequate resources, \r\nwould be up to these responsibilities and current \r\nchallenges. \r\n Another important component of reform that \r\ncontinues to deserve our attention is the Security \r\nCouncil. This body should, in a transparent, inclusive \r\nand democratic manner, follow the evolution and \r\ndynamics of contemporary global challenges and \r\nassume its vital role in building the credibility of the \r\nUnited Nations as a universal entity. We are confident \r\nthat these reforms will allow greater dialogue and \r\ncooperation between the General Assembly and the \r\nSecurity Council, strengthening the relationship with \r\neach other and with relevant regional and subregional \r\norganizations. \r\n We have been following with due attention the \r\nsocial and political developments in North Africa and \r\nthe Middle East. We recognize that these developments \r\npose a challenge for the countries and regions \r\nconcerned and also for the international community. \r\nWe are hopeful that the processes in progress will \r\ncapitalize on opportunities to promote peace, expand \r\nfreedoms, promote development and improve living \r\nconditions. We call upon all relevant actors to engage \r\nin constructive dialogue and work for peaceful \r\nsolutions to ensure peace and stability. \r\n From those developments we have learned the \r\nlesson that internal dialogue, regional cooperation, and \r\nfairness in the interventions of the United Nations \r\nshould be privileged. \r\n We note with concern the lack of progress in the \r\nIsraeli-Arab peace process. In this context, we urge the \r\nparties to commit themselves to relaunching \r\nnegotiations that are translated into concrete actions \r\nwith a view to a lasting, comprehensive and fair \r\nconflict solution. We reiterate our unequivocal support \r\nfor the cause of the Palestinian people, who have been \r\ndenied the inalienable right to self-determination. \r\n We reaffirm our support for the principle of the \r\ncreation of two States, Palestine and Israel, coexisting \r\npeacefully and in accordance with the 1967 borders. \r\nWe also reiterate our support for the commitment of \r\nthe international community to finding a sustainable \r\nsolution in favour of the people of Western Sahara. We \r\nalso reiterate our support for their legitimate right to \r\nself-determination. \r\n We take this opportunity to express our solidarity \r\nwith the brotherly peoples of Somalia, Ethiopia and \r\nKenya, plagued by severe drought and famine. We \r\npraise the efforts that the international community has \r\nmade so far to alleviate the suffering and loss of life.  \r\n Finally, we reaffirm the continued engagement \r\nand commitment of the Republic of Mozambique to \r\npeace, security and stability.  \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I thank the President of the Republic of \r\nMozambique for the statement he has just made.  \r\n Mr. Armando Emílio Guebuza, President of the \r\nRepublic of Mozambique, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.  \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Evo Morales Ayma, Constitutional \r\nPresident of the Plurinational State of Bolivia \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will hear \r\nan address by the Constitutional President of the \r\nPlurinational State of Bolivia. \r\n Mr. Evo Morales Ayma, Constitutional President \r\nof the Plurinational State of Bolivia, was escorted \r\ninto the General Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Evo Morales Ayma, \r\nConstitutional President of the Plurinational State of \r\nBolivia, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Morales Ayma (spoke in Spanish): \r\nBeing present at this forum is very important to express \r\nwhat we think, what we feel and what we work on, but \r\nit is also important to express major differences \r\nbetween Presidents and between Governments, our \r\ndifferences on policies, programmes, projects, \r\n A/66/PV.13\r\n \r\n11 11-50847 \r\n \r\nprinciples and values with some countries in this \r\nworld. \r\n This morning we heard the statements of some \r\nPresidents, and I realized that there are enormous \r\ndifferences between the so-called small countries, \r\ndeveloping countries, underdeveloped countries, \r\ncompared with some Powers. For example, in the \r\ndebate here at the United Nations there is a clear \r\ndifference between the culture of life and the culture of \r\ndeath, between truth and falsehood and between peace \r\nand war. \r\n Of course, we all have the right to have our \r\ndifferences. We have a right to deep differences about \r\nlife, but I believe that our Organization, the United \r\nNations, has a duty to make it possible to align the \r\nconstant work of Governments to guarantee peace and \r\nthe equality and dignity of all those living on plant \r\nEarth. \r\n When I say that there is a deep difference \r\nbetween the culture of life and the culture of death, I \r\nfeel that it will be difficult for us to come to an \r\nunderstanding with economic policies that concentrate \r\ncapital in the hands of a few. Data show that 1 per cent \r\nof the world’s population holds 50 per cent of its \r\nwealth. If there are such deep differences, how can we \r\nresolve the problem of poverty? And if we cannot put \r\nan end to poverty how can we guarantee lasting peace? \r\n Furthermore, imperialism seeks to control the \r\nsources of energy throughout the world, and to that end \r\nit has instruments to impose, control and constantly \r\ninvade. And it is not just now; it has always been so. I \r\nremember when I was a child seeing rebellions of \r\npeoples against the capitalist system, against economic \r\nmodels that involved the permanent pillaging of our \r\nnatural resources. Left-leaning union leaders and \r\npolitical leaders were accused of being Communists in \r\norder to arrest them. There was military intervention \r\nagainst social forces. People were confined, exiled, \r\nkilled, persecuted and jailed, accused of being \r\nsocialists, Maoists, Leninists and Marxist-Leninists.  \r\n I feel that that has ended. We are no longer \r\naccused of being Marxists or Leninists, but now drug-\r\ntrafficking and terrorism are given as excuses. In \r\ncountries with many natural resources, particularly \r\nrelated to energy, we are threatened by foreign \r\nintervention, when Presidents, Governments and \r\npeoples are not pro-capitalist or pro-imperialist.  \r\n And then there is talk about a lasting peace. How \r\ncan there be a lasting peace where there are United \r\nStates military bases? How can there be lasting peace \r\nwhen there are military interventions? \r\n I believe that our United Nations is subordinate to \r\nthe Security Council. What is the use of the United \r\nNations if a group of countries decides on \r\ninterventions, on killings? It is a Security Council for \r\nwhom? It is a Security Council for Presidents, \r\nGovernments, peoples who are pro-imperialist or \r\npro-capitalist. But it is the Insecurity Council for \r\nPresidents, peoples or Governments who seek \r\nliberation — not only cultural liberation, but also \r\neconomic liberation: the recovery of their economic \r\nresources. Those are the deep divisions between the \r\nPresidents from the various continents who are taking \r\npart in our debates. \r\n If we want the Organization to have the authority \r\nto see that its resolutions are respected, we should \r\nthink of founding afresh the United Nations. We cannot \r\ncontinue on the current footing. \r\n Why do I say that? Every year at the United \r\nNations, almost 100 per cent of the Member States — \r\nthe United States and Israel being the exceptions — \r\ndecide that the economic blockade of Cuba should be \r\nended. Who ensures that that decision is respected? \r\nThe Security Council will never ensure that such \r\nUnited Nations resolutions are respected; the United \r\nNations cannot ensure respect for that decision of the \r\nwhole world to lift the blockade against Cuba.  \r\n I cannot understand how the resolutions of an \r\nOrganization of all the countries of the world are not \r\nrespected. What, then, is the United Nations? It is time \r\nfor an in-depth debate on founding afresh this great \r\nOrganization, the largest in the world. We should \r\ndebate its role so that the United Nations is recognized \r\nand respected by the peoples of the world. That can \r\nhappen only with the re-establishment of the United \r\nNations as a body which fights for the equality of all \r\nthe inhabitants of planet Earth, for the dignity of all \r\nthose whom we represent at the United Nations. \r\n I have heard a number of interventions about \r\nPalestine. Of course, Palestine has our full support. \r\nBolivia not only supports recognition of Palestine at \r\nthe United Nations, but also wishes to welcome \r\nPalestine to the United Nations. Here I have a profound \r\nobservation. When Israel bombs, attacks, kills and \r\ntakes Palestinian land, there is no Security Council for \r\nA/66/PV.13  \r\n \r\n11-50847 12 \r\n \r\nthat; there is no international organization that can stop \r\nthose bombings and killings, the genocide in Palestine. \r\n When there was a coup d’état in Honduras, where \r\nwere the military bases to defend a President elected by \r\nthe Honduran people? Where was the Security Council \r\nor the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to \r\ndefend democracy in Honduras? \r\n It is time for us to think deeply about this. When \r\nthere are anti-imperialist Presidents with anti-capitalist \r\nGovernments, the empire tries to create internal \r\nconflicts with what appear to be major confrontations, \r\nmaking it appear in the media that a certain President \r\nshould fall, or it tries to divide a country to justify \r\nintervention. \r\n When there was a coup d’état in Honduras and \r\nthere were killings in Palestine, where was NATO? \r\nWhere was the Security Council? They were nowhere \r\nto be found. \r\n For those and many other reasons, it is important \r\nto think again about re-establishing the United Nations. \r\n How can we Presidents and Governments face \r\nour responsibility of freeing our countries? Let me \r\nspeak of some important aspects of my experience as \r\nPresident. \r\n First, our natural resources can never be \r\nprivatized. They can never be handed over to \r\ntransnational companies, whether they be minerals, oil \r\nor other natural resources. Before I became President, \r\nhydrocarbons were in the hands of transnational \r\ncompanies. What did the contracts say? They declared \r\nthat the owner assumed the right of ownership at the \r\nmouth of the well. Governments told us that as long as \r\nthe resource — gas, oil — was underground it \r\nbelonged to all Bolivians, but the minute it came out of \r\nthe ground it belonged instead to the transnational \r\ncompanies. In the contracts they concocted the idea \r\nthat the contract holder acquired ownership at the \r\nmouth of the well; as soon as the oil and gas came out \r\nof the ground they no longer belonged to Bolivians. \r\nThat was a constant pillaging of our natural resources. \r\n On 1 May 2006, we nationalized and recovered \r\nour natural resources through a supreme decree. From \r\nthen on our national economy began to change. From \r\nthen on Bolivia stopped being a beggar State. Before \r\n2006 — I say this very sincerely — Bolivia was a \r\nsmall country sometimes considered an \r\nunderdeveloped or developing country; it does not \r\nmatter what term is used.  \r\n We have just 10 million inhabitants. Investment \r\nin Bolivia in 2005 was only $600 million, and more \r\nthan 50 per cent of it was credits or international \r\ncooperation. Less than 50 per cent consisted of our \r\nown resources. How much investment has there been \r\nthis year? The answer is $3.6 billion, with 20 per cent \r\nor 30 per cent of that being through international \r\ncooperation or credits, while almost 80 per cent is our \r\nown resources, thanks to our recovery of hydrocarbons, \r\ngas. How our economy has changed! \r\n From 1948 until 2005 Bolivia never had a fiscal \r\nsurplus; it was in deficit. In our first year in charge — \r\n2006 — we achieved a fiscal surplus. We also created \r\nbonds for children and the elderly. We started to \r\ndemocratize our economy, apart from increasing \r\ninvestment. For the 180 years after Bolivia was \r\nfounded in 1825, what international reserves did we \r\nhave until 2005? The answer is $1.7 billion. Over \r\n180 years, Governments of all kinds — liberal, military \r\ndictatorships, neo-liberal — were able to save for \r\nBolivia only $1.7 billion. In less than six years we have \r\nsaved over $10 billion; Bolivia now has $11.7 billion \r\nin international reserves. \r\n In 2005, we were the next to last country in terms \r\nof international reserves. Now we have improved, \r\nthanks to the recovery and nationalization of \r\nhydrocarbons. Recovering natural resources, having \r\nthem in the hands of the State, is very important for \r\nimproving the economy; we cannot privatize natural \r\nresources and hand them over to the transnationals.  \r\n We can have partners. That is fine. But \r\ncompanies cannot be the owners of our natural \r\nresources. The State, the people, must be the owner. I \r\nmention this experience because thanks to our \r\ndecision, responding to the call of the Bolivian people, \r\nwe started to change the national economy. \r\n I have a second point. Basic public services can \r\nnever be provided by private businesses. I am speaking \r\nof water, energy, electricity and the telephone service. \r\nThis morning, someone said that the prices of \r\nagricultural products are rising by 25 per cent or 30 per \r\ncent — even 50 per cent in some cases — and have \r\nbeen doing so for four or five years. Prices are going \r\nup because we do not yet control agricultural \r\nproduction. Since the State has controlled basic \r\nservices in Bolivia, electricity, telephone and drinking \r\n A/66/PV.13\r\n \r\n13 11-50847 \r\n \r\nwater tariffs have not risen, because they are basic. \r\nPublic utilities must be the responsibility of the State, \r\nand not of the private sector. \r\n How can we allow water, the stuff of life, to be in \r\nprivate hands? I welcome the support we have received \r\nfrom the General Assembly for water to be a human \r\nright and express thanks on behalf of the people and \r\nGovernment of Bolivia. It is our responsibility to \r\nimplement throughout the world the concept of water \r\nas a human right, thus supporting the least privileged \r\nwhen it comes to water. \r\n My third point concerns the constant struggle of \r\npeoples for dignity and sovereignty. In Bolivia I too \r\nhave to put up with a United States military base. And \r\nwhat do the uniformed United States outsiders do? \r\nThey command the national police and the armed \r\nforces, because of political decisions of former \r\nPresidents, those who preceded me in the Palacio \r\nQuemada, as it is known in some sectors of society. \r\nThe Chimore airport could not be used without the \r\npermission of the United States embassy. That woke us \r\nup to the importance of defending the dignity and \r\nsovereignty of our peoples.  \r\n What I have described gave rise to a great \r\nmovement, not only social and cultural, but also \r\nelectoral. It led to a political liberation movement, a \r\nmovement to return dignity to all Bolivians, and to my \r\nattaining the presidency. \r\n When I became President, I closed the military \r\nbase. How is it possible in this new millennium, in the \r\ntwenty-first century, for there still to be foreign \r\nmilitary bases all around the world? How is it possible \r\nfor there still to be interventions decided upon by the \r\nSecurity Council? That situation is a threat to \r\nhumanity, an attack on the dignity of all the countries \r\nof the world. That is why we must develop proposals \r\nfor the United Nations that will make it possible not \r\nonly to free all the people living on this planet, but to \r\nrestore dignity to them. \r\n My fourth point concerns international financial \r\ninstitutions. I remember that when I was a union leader \r\nGovernments could never obtain the resources for \r\ninvestment. We were told that Bolivia did not have the \r\ncapacity to borrow. Bolivia did not have easy access to \r\ninternational loans. But what did the International \r\nMonetary Fund do? It made loans conditional. It told \r\nGovernments that if they privatized refineries and \r\ntelecommunications they would give credits of \r\n$30 million to $40 million. \r\n A usurious bank, conditional credits and credits \r\nrequiring security are no solution. No credits were \r\ngiven to States, or to the productive sector. They were \r\nall for services and trade. Above all, they went to the \r\ntransnationals. \r\n When I became President, one of the \r\ntransnational oil companies told me that the \r\nGovernment would have to guarantee a credit of \r\n$100 million to build a pipeline. I wondered about the \r\npurpose. Finally, the oil company, Transredes, was \r\nconspiring politically, and we therefore decided to \r\nnationalize its properties — oil and gas pipelines. We \r\nexpelled it. Then we began to invest through the State \r\ncompany, Yacimientos, without borrowing a single \r\ndollar, and the Carrasco Cochabamba pipeline is now \r\nunder construction. But if the transnational had \r\ncontinued to be responsible, we would certainly have \r\nhad to guarantee a loan for it. \r\n As the Assembly is aware, I come from the \r\nindigenous peasant movement. When our families talk \r\nabout a company, they think of it as something that has \r\na lot of money and is made up of millionaires. So I \r\ncould not understand how a company could ask the \r\nGovernment to lend it money for an investment. \r\n The international financial institutions deal \r\nthrough companies, but who has to pay? It is the \r\npeoples, the States. So we must create other financial \r\ninstitutions. Fortunately, we are making good progress \r\nin South America. The Bank of the South will be \r\ncompletely different from the usurious banks that \r\nfeather their own nests and make money through \r\nspeculation. That must end. Regional integration will \r\nfree us from the domination of those banks. \r\n It is important for us to go further in that \r\nintegration. In Bolivia we have barriers to overcome, \r\nand other countries of the Union of South American \r\nNations (UNASUR) also have problems. For example, \r\nwe have a historic demand upon Chile for a sovereign \r\ncorridor to the Pacific. We decided to have recourse to \r\ninternational tribunals to ask for that access. \r\nResolution 37/10 of 15 November 1982 establishes in \r\nits annex, the Manila Declaration on the Peaceful \r\nSettlement of International Disputes, that recourse to \r\nan international tribunal to settle disputes between \r\nStates should not be considered an unfriendly act. \r\nA/66/PV.13  \r\n \r\n11-50847 14 \r\n \r\n Bolivia has right and reason on its side in going \r\nto an international tribunal, because our landlocked \r\nstate results from an unjust war, an invasion. For \r\nBolivia, calling for a solution in the international \r\nsphere means for Bolivia redressing a historic injustice. \r\n Bolivia is a friendly, peaceful State which gives \r\npriority to dialogue with its neighbours. We therefore \r\nkeep open channels for bilateral negotiation with Chile, \r\nwithout, however, renouncing the right to go to an \r\ninternational court. There is regional involvement as \r\nwell, since this is not just a bilateral problem, but is a \r\nregional problem as well. \r\n Peoples are not responsible for the landlocked \r\nstate of Bolivia. Those responsible are, as always, the \r\noligarchies, the transnationals, which wish to protect \r\ntheir access to natural resources. The 1904 Treaty did \r\nnot lead to either peace or friendship, because for more \r\nthan a century Bolivia had no access to a sovereign \r\nport of its own. I take this opportunity to call on the \r\nUnited Nations, other international organizations and \r\nespecially the region to support us, so that we can \r\nreturn with sovereignty to the Pacific Ocean. \r\n In addition, there is another movement of \r\ncountries taking place, that of the countries of Latin \r\nAmerica with the Caribbean. I would say that it is a \r\nnew Organization of American States, without the \r\nUnited States, in order to free us of certain impositions, \r\nwith the benefit of our experience in UNASUR. I say \r\nthat because we no longer find ourselves obliged, when \r\nthere are conflicts between countries and within \r\ndemocracies, to have somebody coming from outside \r\nand above to re-establish order. Presidents and \r\nGovernments meet to resolve internal problems. This is \r\na great liberation for us. \r\n I also take this opportunity to touch on a central \r\ntopic: the fight against drug trafficking. United States \r\nimperialism is using the war on drugs for political \r\nends. The United States Drug Enforcement \r\nAdministration (DEA) in Bolivia was not fighting drug \r\ntrafficking; it was controlling it for political purposes. \r\nThe DEA would implicate union leaders or anti-imperialist \r\npolitical leaders.  \r\n Many politicians have been saved from that dirty \r\nwork of the empire in attempting to implicate us in \r\ndrug trafficking, which still goes on. Last week some \r\nparts of the United States media said that my aircraft \r\nhad been detained in the United States with traces of \r\ncocaine. How false! They are trying to confuse the \r\npeople, trying to conduct a dirty campaign against my \r\nGovernment and against the State of Bolivia. \r\n What does the United States do? It decertifies \r\nBolivia and Venezuela. What moral authority does it \r\nhave to certify or decertify nations of Latin America, \r\nwhen the United States is the world’s leading drug \r\nconsumer, when the United States is one of the world’s \r\nproducers of marijuana — in some years the biggest? \r\nWhat authority does it have to certify or decertify any \r\ncountry? This is another way of trying to scare \r\ncountries or punish them. \r\n However, Bolivia, very responsibly, continues to \r\nfight drug trafficking. A report by the State Department \r\nrecognizes that there has been a net reduction in coca \r\ncultivation, with improved interdiction. Where is the \r\nmarket? The market is what drives drug trafficking, \r\nand the market is here. Who is decertifying the United \r\nStates because it has not cut down the market? This \r\nmorning President Calderón of Mexico said that the \r\ndrug market continues to grow. Why is no \r\nresponsibility taken for eliminating the market? As \r\nlong as there is a market coca leaves and other \r\nproducts will be turned into drugs. \r\n A great responsibility must be borne. Here I make \r\nan appeal. Let us fight with shared responsibility. Why \r\ndo we not put an end to banking confidentiality? The \r\nbiggest drug traffickers put their millions of dollars not \r\nin briefcases or backpacks but in the banks. Why is \r\nthere fear of banking secrecy? In Bolivia we are not \r\nafraid. Banking confidentiality must be ended if we \r\nwant to fight drug trafficking head on. \r\n One of the crises on the margin of the crisis of \r\ncapitalism is the food crisis. New international \r\nfinancial structures give opportunities to people with \r\nlow incomes by providing microcredits to small \r\nproducers. We have some experience in Bolivia, where \r\ncredits at zero interest have been given to producers of \r\nrice, wheat, corn and soy at zero interest. Food \r\nproducers can even pay their debts with their products. \r\nSoft credits are given to encourage food production. \r\n Yet the international banks never take the small \r\nproducer into account; they never pay any heed to \r\ncooperatives, to associations, which can very well \r\ncontribute if given the chance. \r\n There are new ways to encourage production \r\nthrough fair trade. We have to put an end to the \r\nso-called competitive market. In a competition who \r\n A/66/PV.13\r\n \r\n15 11-50847 \r\n \r\nwins? It is the most powerful, those with the greatest \r\nadvantages. Transnational companies are always the \r\nwinners. The losers are the small producers, families \r\nwanting to rise through their own efforts. Therefore, \r\nwe are trying in the region to implement policies of \r\ncomplementarity and solidarity, and not of competition. \r\nWith naked competition we shall never be able to solve \r\nthe problem of poverty. \r\n Finally on this matter, the crisis of capitalism has \r\nno exit. When I was a young boy much mention was \r\nmade of the foreign debt of poor countries. It was said \r\nthat it could never be paid. Now the situation is quite \r\nthe opposite: the debts of the poor countries can easily \r\nbe settled, but the crisis of capitalism is a bottomless \r\nhole. The crisis of capitalism is not just because of \r\ncircumstances; it is structural. \r\n What do capitalist or imperialist countries do? \r\nThey seek any pretext to invade a country and make off \r\nwith its natural resources. This morning the President \r\nof the United States said that Iraq was already free and \r\nwould govern itself. The Iraqis will be able to govern \r\nthemselves, of course, but in whose hands is the oil \r\nnow?  \r\n The fall of autocracy in Libya was hailed, and \r\nnow there is democracy, but in whose hands is Libyan \r\noil? The world and the Libyans have come to realize \r\nthat reason for the invasion and the bombings was not \r\nto bring about the fall of Al-Qadhafi by rebels but a \r\ndesire for Libyan oil. Next year we can review the \r\nsituation and see which countries have their hands on \r\nLibyan oil.  \r\n There is a desire to overcome the crisis of \r\ncapitalism by making off with our oil, gas and other \r\nnatural resources. But we also have the great \r\nresponsibility of defending the rights of Mother Earth. \r\nI continue to be convinced that the best way to defend \r\nhuman rights is to defend the rights of Mother Earth. \r\n Here we have the great responsibility of looking \r\nafter the rights of Mother Earth. Only 60 years ago the \r\nAssembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights; it was only 60 years ago that the United \r\nNations realized that the human being also has rights. \r\nAfter political rights, economic rights, the rights of \r\nindigenous peoples, now we have the enormous \r\nresponsibility of defending the rights of Mother Earth. \r\n We are also convinced that infinite growth on a \r\nfinite planet is unsustainable and impossible. The limit \r\nto growth is the regenerative capacity of the planet’s \r\necosystems. We therefore call for a new 10 commandments \r\nconcerning social demands, financial systems, natural \r\nresources, basic services, production, and dignity and \r\nsovereignty. On that basis we should begin to re-\r\nestablish the United Nations so that it can be the \r\nhighest instance to settle issues of peace, poverty, \r\ndignity and sovereignty. \r\n I hope that my experience as President of Bolivia \r\nwill be useful to all those present. At the same time, I \r\ncome to learn from many of them so that I may \r\ncontinue working for the equality and dignity of the \r\nBolivian people. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I thank the Constitutional President of the \r\nPlurinational State of Bolivia for the statement he has \r\njust made. \r\n Mr. Evo Morales Ayma, Constitutional President \r\nof the Plurinational State of Bolivia, was escorted \r\nfrom the General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Danilo Türk, President of the \r\nRepublic of Slovenia \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will hear \r\nan address by the President of the Republic of \r\nSlovenia. \r\n Mr. Danilo Türk, President of the Republic of \r\nSlovenia, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Danilo Türk, President of \r\nthe Republic of Slovenia, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly. \r\n President Türk: I start by congratulating \r\nMr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its current session, on his \r\nelection, and express our belief that with his wisdom \r\nand experience he will guide the Assembly well. \r\n I also express our sincere gratitude to the \r\noutgoing President, Mr. Joseph Deiss, for his important \r\ncontribution to the work of the General Assembly and \r\nthe United Nations. \r\n Obviously, I wish to pay special tribute to the \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, and to thank him \r\nfor the vision and dedication with which he works for \r\nA/66/PV.13  \r\n \r\n11-50847 16 \r\n \r\nthe United Nations and for his tireless efforts to \r\npromote the spirit of the Charter. We deeply appreciate \r\nhis leadership and wish him continued success in his \r\nsecond term in office as he guides the United Nations \r\nin these challenging times. \r\n Slovenia welcomes the President’s decision to put \r\nthe theme of mediation at the centre of our \r\ndeliberations at this session. Indeed, no other theme \r\nseems more timely at this moment of search for an \r\napproach towards a peaceful resolution of the Israeli-\r\nPalestinian conflict. The European Union, to which \r\nSlovenia belongs, is currently fully engaged with high-\r\nprofile mediation in this context. The mediation under \r\nway has two aims. \r\n The first is the revival of the peace process with a \r\nview to finding an early solution — a genuine and fair \r\npeace agreement involving two States, Israel and \r\nPalestine, which would live side by side in peace and \r\nsecurity. Secondly, an immediate task relevant to the \r\nUnited Nations is to find an adequate status for \r\nPalestine within the ranks of our common, global \r\nOrganization. Those two aims are genuinely linked, \r\nand the latter should be understood as supporting the \r\nformer. \r\n Our common Organization, the United Nations, is \r\ncommitted to its inclusive character and the \r\nuniversality of its membership. This is the spirit in \r\nwhich we see some of the significant developments of \r\nthis year.  \r\n We welcome the Republic of South Sudan as the \r\nnewest Member of the United Nations. Our \r\nOrganization should render every assistance to the new \r\nMember in its efforts to establish its structures and to \r\nserve the wellbeing of its people. \r\n We also welcome the decision of the General \r\nAssembly to grant the seat of Libya to the \r\nrepresentatives of the National Transitional Council of \r\nLibya. This has established a much needed link \r\nbetween the United Nations and the people of Libya in \r\ntheir effort to build legitimate, democratic and \r\neffective institutions and to pursue the path of \r\neconomic, social and political development, in \r\naccordance with the wishes of the people.  \r\n Yesterday, at a special High-level Meeting we \r\ndiscussed the forms of assistance in some detail. Today \r\nwe can say that there is a fair chance of success for \r\neffective cooperation between the people of Libya and \r\nthe United Nations as well as the regional \r\norganizations — in particular, the African Union and \r\nthe Arab League. Together we shall be better able to \r\nassist. Slovenia is willing to continue to do its part in \r\nthis framework. \r\n Political and security concerns are always an \r\nimportant priority for the United Nations. But they \r\nhave to be considered against the background of other \r\npriorities, both long-term and short-term. The \r\nOrganization has developed its engagements in the \r\nmost important and the most difficult issues of \r\nenvironment and sustainable development. We need to \r\ntake resolute steps towards a new and effective system \r\nto mitigate the effects of climate change and ensure the \r\nnecessary adaptation.  \r\n We hope that the Conference of the Parties to the \r\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange, to be held in Durban later this year, will bring \r\nus a step closer to final agreement. The negative \r\nimpacts of climate change are disproportionate. We \r\nshould pay particular attention to the unique challenges \r\nfaced by the small island developing States, whose \r\ncharacteristics make them among the most vulnerable \r\nin the world to climate change. \r\n The United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, to be held next year, will be an \r\nopportunity to secure renewed political commitment to \r\nsustainable development, to assess the progress of \r\nimplementation of agreed commitments, and to address \r\nnew and emerging challenges. We should strengthen \r\nour efforts to develop a new concept of development \r\nthat will capture economic growth, social development \r\nand environmental protection. It is our duty to make a \r\ndifference, and making a difference requires a more \r\ncomprehensive definition of development. \r\n Maintaining our focus on the successful \r\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals, \r\nwe should pay particular attention to the special needs \r\nof Africa, especially those countries most in need. The \r\nIstanbul Programme of Action offers concrete solutions \r\nfor improving progress in the least developed \r\ncountries. \r\n In times of economic crisis in the donor \r\ncountries, which seems to continue unabated, \r\nincreasing aid proves difficult to attain. Improving aid \r\neffectiveness is crucial.  \r\n A/66/PV.13\r\n \r\n17 11-50847 \r\n \r\n There can be no gain in the field of development \r\nif other policies, such as trade, agriculture, migration, \r\nclimate change and so on, cancel out the positive \r\neffects of development policies. In this regard, let me \r\nconvey our hopes for the successful deliberations of \r\nthe High-level Forum to be held in Busan later this \r\nyear. \r\n Recent experience in the exercise of development \r\nactivities has strengthened understanding of the links \r\nbetween development and human rights. The concept \r\nof the right to development is gaining in substance and \r\nrecognition. Moreover, specific development tasks \r\nhave provided further evidence of the importance of \r\nthis link. The role of women in development is a \r\npertinent example. Experience and research by the \r\nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United \r\nNations, for example, have shown that empowerment \r\nof women in agriculture can reduce hunger by 30 per \r\ncent — a very impressive result by any measure.  \r\n Gender equality and the empowerment of women \r\nare essential to promoting peace, security and above all \r\ndevelopment. Slovenia strongly supports the work of \r\nUN-Women, which will help to significantly boost \r\nUnited Nations efforts to promote gender equality, \r\nexpand opportunities and tackle discrimination against \r\nwomen around the globe. \r\n Another priority in the field of human rights that \r\nSlovenia values highly relates to the rights of the child \r\nand to human rights education. This year, as President \r\nof the Executive Board of UNICEF, Slovenia worked \r\ntirelessly to attain universal ratification of both \r\noptional protocols to the Convention on the Rights of \r\nthe Child. The objective should be to ensure, through \r\nUnited Nations instruments and national action, \r\neffective protection of the rights of the child and to \r\nimprove the wellbeing of children in all parts of the \r\nworld. \r\n An important segment of this work relates to \r\nhuman rights education, which helps to empower \r\nyoung people in their efforts to secure their rightful \r\nplace in society. I remember when Slovenia and Costa \r\nRica launched a human rights education campaign in \r\nthe Third Committee almost 20 years ago. It is \r\ngratifying to see that today human rights are \r\nincreasingly being included in official school \r\ncurriculums. But there is still much more that we need \r\nto do to incorporate human rights learning into \r\nsocieties as a lifelong process. The United Nations, its \r\nHuman Rights Council and the General Assembly will, \r\nI am convinced, continue to make a significant \r\ncontribution.  \r\n I would like to express satisfaction over the \r\nadoption of the draft declaration on human rights \r\neducation and training by the Human Rights Council \r\nduring its March session this year. I call on all States to \r\nsupport this important declaration, which I am \r\nconvinced the General Assembly will adopt — \r\nhopefully, unanimously — later this autumn. \r\n Human rights concerns are most tragic in the case \r\nof humanitarian disasters. The current famine in the \r\nHorn of Africa is a sad example. It is a crisis of human \r\nexistence and human rights. All actors of the \r\ninternational community, including my country, \r\nSlovenia, are already trying to help. But more help is \r\nneeded; humanitarian assistance must expand. \r\n I have briefly referred to some of Slovenia’s areas \r\nof particular importance, particular engagement and \r\nparticular activity. Our commitment to the United \r\nNations is strong and will remain strong.  \r\n The United Nations is an Organization of all and \r\nfor all. For almost 20 years now Slovenia has been \r\nworking as a devoted Member State. We have made \r\nproposals for specific action and enjoyed working with \r\nall other Member States — large and small, \r\ngeographically close and geographically distant. We \r\nhave worked together on specific proposals and \r\ndecisions and on implementation. \r\n We have also proposed a set of ideas for reform \r\nof the Security Council. We hope that the coming year \r\nwill see more resolute steps in that regard, and that \r\nmore progress will be made than there has been so far. \r\n The United Nations is an important hope — a \r\nhope for the world — and an opportunity for its \r\nMember States to bring the reality, complicated and \r\nonerous as it may be, closer to our hopes. It is in this \r\nspirit that Slovenia has presented its candidature for a \r\nnon-permanent seat on the Security Council. We hope \r\nfor broad support.  \r\n If we are elected we shall be a faithful United \r\nNations Member State, aware of the responsibilities of \r\nthe Security Council and all its members towards the \r\nentire Organization and all Member States. We pledge \r\nour efforts, our judgement and our sense of fairness as \r\na contribution to the United Nations. And fairness is a \r\nA/66/PV.13  \r\n \r\n11-50847 18 \r\n \r\ncommodity, a principle, a value, that the international \r\ncommunity needs most of all. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I thank the President of the Republic of \r\nSlovenia for his statement. \r\n Mr. Danilo Türk, President of the Republic of \r\nSlovenia, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n  The meeting rose at 8.05 p.m. \r\n"
