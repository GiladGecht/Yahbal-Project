This \r\nmeeting is being held in accordance with General \r\nAssembly resolutions 64/148 of 18 December 2009, \r\n65/240 of 24 December 2010 and 65/279 of 13 June \r\n2011, and under sub-item (b) of agenda item 67, \r\nentitled “Comprehensive implementation of and \r\nfollow-up to the Durban Declaration and Programme of \r\nAction”.  \r\n I warmly welcome all to this High-level Meeting. \r\nWe meet here today to reaffirm that we, the peoples \r\nand nations of the world, make up one family rich in \r\ndiversity. It is our diversity that enriches humankind \r\nand steers its progress. It is through the celebration of \r\nthis diversity as well as through the promotion of \r\ntolerance and dispelling fears of the other, that we will \r\nbuild a more peaceful world, a world based on the \r\nfundamental principles of equality, trust and mutual \r\nrespect.  \r\n I should like to thank the co-facilitators, Her \r\nExcellency Ms. Isabelle Picco, Permanent Representative \r\nof Monaco to the United Nations, and His Excellency \r\nMr. Tommo Monthe, Permanent Representative of \r\nCameroon to the United Nations, for having very ably \r\nled the preparations for this High-level Meeting. In that \r\nconnection, I wish to express my gratitude to them for \r\ntheir excellent efforts. \r\n Today’s meeting is an opportunity for world \r\nleaders to speak with one voice on one of the most \r\ncritical global challenges of the twenty-first century — \r\nthe continuing scourge of racism and xenophobia \r\nworldwide. It is also an opportunity to recommit to the \r\nfull and effective implementation of the actions \r\noutlined in the Durban Declaration and Programme of \r\nAction, adopted by consensus in 2001. Together with \r\nthe outcome document of the Durban Review \r\nConference, the Durban Declaration and Programme of \r\nAction is the most comprehensive framework for \r\ncombating racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia \r\nand related intolerance. It highlights issues faced by \r\nvictims of racial discrimination, particularly people of \r\nAfrican and Asian descent, migrants, refugees, and \r\nspecific vulnerable groups, such as indigenous peoples \r\nand other minorities. It also emphasizes that we must \r\nremember the crimes or wrongs of the past, wherever \r\nand whenever they occurred. We must unequivocally \r\ncondemn these racist tragedies and tell the truth about \r\nhistory. These are essential elements for international \r\nA/66/PV.14  \r\n \r\n11-50859 2 \r\n \r\nreconciliation and the creation of societies based on \r\njustice, equality and solidarity. \r\n Unfortunately, despite progress made since the \r\nDurban Declaration and Programme of Action was \r\nadopted in 2001, instances of xenophobia, racism and \r\nintolerance have increased in severity and frequency. \r\nRacist attitudes and hate speech can be found in many \r\ncountries, and the Internet provides a new vehicle for \r\ntheir proliferation. While countries have come a long way \r\nin removing obstacles to the realization of the \r\nfundamental principles of equality and non-discrimination, \r\nmuch more remains to be done on this score.  \r\n I wish to encourage all countries, individually \r\nand collectively, to intensify their efforts to reduce \r\ninstances of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia \r\nand related intolerance. It is the responsibility of States \r\nto enact the necessary legislative measures to prevent \r\nthe occurrence of discriminatory practices and to grant \r\njustice to the victims. Governments, in collaboration \r\nwith other stakeholders, including civil society and \r\nbusiness, should intensify awareness-raising initiatives \r\nand enhance education in order to combat ignorance \r\nand effectively address the root causes of prejudice and \r\nnegative stereotypes.  \r\n This High-level Meeting is an opportunity for all \r\nof us to reaffirm our collective responsibility for \r\ncombating racism and promoting equality and \r\nnon-discrimination. It is also an opportunity to come \r\ntogether in unity to address the critical challenges \r\nbefore us. I wish us all a successful meeting. \r\n I now give the floor to the Secretary-General, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon. \r\n The Secretary-General: Ten years, ago in \r\nadopting the Durban Declaration and Programme of \r\nAction against racism, the international community \r\nacknowledged that no country could claim to be free of \r\ndiscrimination and intolerance.  \r\n Ten years later, that is still the case. Certainly we \r\nhave come a long way. We have seen new laws \r\nenacted; new institutions pursuing justice; new \r\ninitiatives promoting dialogue; and new mindsets \r\ntaking hold. We are better prepared to prosecute and \r\nprotect against grave crimes such as genocide, \r\napartheid, ethnic cleansing and contemporary forms of \r\nslavery. Our antennae are better attuned to see the \r\ninsidious forms of discrimination — the subtle, face-\r\nto-face interactions and institutionalized prejudice that \r\ncan be every bit as destructive as outright aggressive \r\nbehaviour.  \r\n Yet we must acknowledge that intolerance has \r\nincreased in many parts of the world over the past \r\ndecade. The resurgence and persistence of such \r\ninhumane attitudes and detrimental practices indicate \r\nthat we have not done enough to stem the tide. \r\nMembers have before them a global action plan that \r\nincludes recommendations for combating \r\ndiscrimination against Africans and persons of African \r\ndescent, Asians and persons of Asian descent, \r\nindigenous peoples, migrants, refugees, minorities, the \r\nRoma, and others. Let us do more to embrace diversity \r\nand safeguard the dignity of these groups.  \r\n I welcome this year’s observance of the \r\nInternational Year for People of African Descent and \r\nthe many constructive initiatives it has generated. Let \r\nus stand firmly against anti-Semitism. We must oppose \r\nIslamophobia and reject discrimination against \r\nChristians. Bias based on religious identity has no \r\nplace in our world. Let us defend the rights of all, \r\nwithout distinction of any kind, as the Universal \r\nDeclaration proclaims. Neither race, colour nor \r\nlanguage; neither political nor other opinion; neither \r\nproperty, birth nor other status should be a barrier to \r\nthe enjoyment of rights and freedoms. \r\n Let us also stay in the vanguard against bigotry \r\nand commit to fighting discrimination based on gender \r\nand sexual orientation. Victims of prejudice must be at \r\nthe centre of our efforts, as the theme of this event \r\nrightly indicates. Our battle for mutual respect and \r\nunderstanding is no feel-good exercise.  \r\n The stakes are high indeed. Ignorance and \r\nintolerance are among the root causes of conflicts. \r\nRacism and discrimination are major obstacles to \r\ndevelopment. All too often, we see a vicious cycle in \r\nwhich discrimination leads to deprivation and poverty \r\ndeepens discrimination. A marked characteristic of \r\nvirtually all extremely poor communities is that they \r\nlack equal access to State institutions and services. \r\nHard economic times such as these only exacerbate the \r\nsituation. Competition for jobs and other difficulties \r\noften trigger hostility towards migrants and minorities. \r\nGovernments have to ensure that unemployment and \r\ndeteriorating living standards do not provide excuses \r\nfor attacks on vulnerable groups. We must resist \r\npolarizing politicians who play on people’s fears and \r\nuse stereotypes to gain electoral advantage. \r\n A/66/PV.14\r\n \r\n3 11-50859 \r\n \r\n We are all aware that the original Durban \r\nConference and its follow-up two years ago caused \r\nimmense controversy. On this anniversary, let us \r\nrestate some basic principles. This process is meant to \r\nfurther the world’s essential fight against racism. We \r\nshould condemn anyone who uses this platform to \r\nsubvert that effort with inflammatory rhetoric, baseless \r\nassertions and hateful speech. Our common \r\ncommitment must be to focus on the real problems of \r\nracism and intolerance. Let us strive to ensure dignity, \r\nequality and justice for all. Let us work hand in hand \r\nwith the civil society groups that are so central to this \r\ncause. Let us work in harmony to promote harmony. \r\n The President: I thank the Secretary-General for \r\nhis statement. \r\n I now give the floor to Ms. Navanethem Pillay, \r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.  \r\n Ms. Pillay (United Nations High Commissioner \r\nfor Human Rights): Today we commemorate the \r\nadoption by consensus, in September 2001, of the \r\nDurban Declaration and Programme of Action against \r\nracism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related \r\nintolerance. I salute the vast majority of Member States \r\nthat are showing their support for this important \r\nachievement, intended to combat racism and make a \r\ndifference in the lives of so many victims worldwide. \r\nThe lead-up to this commemoration has been \r\nundoubtedly challenging, in no small part because the \r\nissues are complex and sensitive. No country can claim \r\nto be free of racism, but we must be resolute in finding \r\nthe courage to unite and move ahead together. \r\n The Durban Declaration and Programme of \r\nAction, together with the outcome document of the \r\n2009 Review Conference, provide a comprehensive \r\nframework to address the scourge of racism. Crucially, \r\nboth documents place victims at the centre of our \r\nefforts against racism, racial discrimination, \r\nxenophobia and related intolerance. They contain a \r\ngenuinely universal condemnation of racism which \r\nacknowledges the injustices of the past and forewarns \r\nagainst both resurgent manifestations and new forms of \r\nracism and intolerance.  \r\n The Declaration lists a wide range of victims and \r\ngrounds. Among the former, it speaks of the plight of \r\nminorities, such as the Roma, of people of African and \r\nAsian descent, of migrants and indigenous peoples. \r\nAmong the latter, it includes condemnation of stigma \r\nand discrimination on the basis of HIV/AIDS, \r\ndiscrimination based on descent and the multiple forms \r\nof discrimination and exclusion faced in particular by \r\nwomen. In sum, the document encompasses victims, \r\nsources, causes and forms. It deals with racism in \r\nmedia and new information and communication \r\ntechnologies, trafficking, migration, conflict, poverty \r\nand internal displacement. It covers discrimination \r\nboth in the private and the public sphere. It considers \r\nlegal assistance and the provision of effective remedies \r\nfor victims and those affected by racism. \r\n Another important feature of the Declaration is \r\nthat it not only reminds Governments of their core \r\nhuman rights obligations, but details further actions \r\nthat States should take in collaboration with \r\nparliaments, national institutions, civil society and \r\nother partners. It also contemplates strategies of \r\nenhanced international cooperation which involve the \r\nUnited Nations and other international mechanisms.  \r\n The Durban Declaration and Programme of \r\nAction and the outcome document of the Durban \r\nReview Conference make clear that the anti-discrimination \r\nagenda concerns and belongs to all of us irrespective of \r\nour race, colour, descent, ethnic or national origin, \r\naffiliation, religion or belief. Their principles are the \r\nreliable foundations of our action, and they continue to \r\nprovide firm guidance in the face of changing \r\ncircumstances and new challenges. \r\n Although 10 years ago, the Durban Declaration \r\nand Programme of Action presciently provided a \r\ncomprehensive framework to address contemporary \r\nchallenges, today we must confront the regrettable gap \r\nbetween the commitments made at that time and the \r\nconcrete and effective action actually undertaken. \r\nSome States have made incremental progress in \r\ncombating racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia \r\nand related intolerance, largely through the enactment \r\nor amendment of constitutional protections and \r\ndomestic legislation. The importance of solid legal \r\nregimes to protect rights and provide avenues for \r\nremedy and redress is indisputable.  \r\n Yet, tangible progress cannot be attained without \r\nthe political will to implement and enforce such laws. \r\nLet us pledge here and now to revitalize our efforts \r\nnationally, regionally and globally to combat the \r\nscourges of racism. We can begin by showing \r\nleadership here today by underscoring that equality and \r\nnon-discrimination are fundamental principles of the \r\ninternational community. They give hope to victims. \r\nA/66/PV.14  \r\n \r\n11-50859 4 \r\n \r\nWe must all commit to actions at all levels that address \r\nunderlying and often structural causes of racism. \r\n The road to a world free from racism is not an \r\neasy one. Anti-discrimination work needs careful \r\nplanning and a long-term focus. It requires \r\ncommitment and persistence. In this respect, I wish to \r\nhighlight the importance of developing the national \r\naction plans that the Durban Declaration and \r\nProgramme of Action envisage, with the participation \r\nof victims and affected groups. National action plans \r\nare proving to be an important tool to address racism at \r\nthe domestic level. My Office has been providing \r\ntraining and technical assistance in this area, and we \r\nstand ready to assist more States in this endeavour. We \r\nwill also continue to serve as a forum for dialogue, \r\nexchange and research on anti-discrimination issues \r\nbecause we believe that informed, credible exchange \r\nand dialogue among States, United Nations experts, \r\nacademics, parliaments, civil society and other partners \r\non these issues can create greater understanding and \r\nbuild trust. \r\n As mandated by the Human Rights Council and \r\nthe General Assembly, the Office of the United Nations \r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights will continue to \r\nsupport key mechanisms such as the Working Group of \r\nExperts on People of African Descent, the \r\nIntergovernmental Working Group on the Effective \r\nImplementation of the Durban Declaration and \r\nProgramme of Action, the Special Rapporteur on \r\ncontemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, \r\nxenophobia and related intolerance, and the Committee \r\non the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. \r\n Finally, we are determined to continue enhancing \r\nanti-discrimination efforts across the United Nations. It \r\nwill be important to ally with our sister agencies to \r\nimprove our system-wide coordination on \r\nanti-discrimination issues affecting women, children, \r\nindigenous peoples, migrants, trafficked persons, \r\npeople living with HIV/AIDS, and others. \r\n I wish to conclude by noting that few people in \r\nthe world today would openly deny that human beings \r\nare born with equal rights, as the Universal Declaration \r\nof Human Rights proclaims. We all agree that far too \r\nmany people are still victimized because they belong to \r\na particular group — whether national, ethnic, or \r\nreligious, or defined by gender or by descent. The \r\nDurban Declaration and Programme of Action, through \r\nthe perspective of victims, provides a comprehensive \r\nframework within which to translate this sentiment and \r\nthis recognition into action.  \r\n Looking ahead there is much more work to be \r\ndone to combat racism, racial discrimination, \r\nxenophobia and related intolerance. I urge everyone to \r\nsummon the political will to unite on this issue of \r\ncentral importance in the lives of countless victims. So \r\nfar, we have done too little too slowly. We have \r\nallowed the global response to racism to be clouded by \r\npolitics. We must do better. The victims of racism \r\ndemand and expect this of us.  \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Jacob Zuma, President of the Republic \r\nof South Africa. \r\n President Zuma: Ten years ago, South Africa \r\nhad the honour to welcome to its shores States \r\nMembers of the United Nations and people from across \r\nthe world to attend the World Conference against \r\nRacism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and \r\nRelated Intolerance. Just under a decade before that, it \r\nwould have been inconceivable that a gathering of that \r\nnature, discussing racism, would have taken place in \r\nSouth Africa. The Conference was testimony of the \r\nsuccess of humankind against the scourge and demon \r\nof racism and racial discrimination. It was also a \r\nconfirmation of the success of the international \r\ncommunity, represented by the United Nations, in the \r\nstruggle against the evil of racism, which the United \r\nNations boldly and correctly declared a crime against \r\nhumanity. \r\n It was also symbolic that the Conference was held \r\non African soil, given that, in the preceding two \r\ncenturies, the African peoples had experienced untold \r\nsufferings, brutality and inhumane treatment during the \r\ncourse of colonialism, occupation and apartheid. In \r\nAfrica, the legacy of all these ills is still visible and is \r\npart of our daily efforts to improve the lives of our \r\npeople. In Durban, the world spoke with one voice and \r\nreaffirmed its commitment to continue to fight against \r\nthe scourge of racism and to do everything to eradicate \r\nit. The world collectively agreed on the need for and \r\nthe significance of a comprehensive framework to \r\ncombat racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and \r\nrelated intolerance. \r\n In this regard, the Durban Declaration and its \r\nProgramme of Action were unanimously adopted. The \r\nDurban Declaration and Programme of Action provided \r\na comprehensive assessment of the state of racism, \r\n A/66/PV.14\r\n \r\n5 11-50859 \r\n \r\nracial discrimination, xenophobia and other related \r\nintolerance in the world at the time, and offered a \r\ncollective set of actions to be undertaken to address the \r\nchallenge. South Africa appreciates the decision the \r\nGeneral Assembly has taken to mark the 10 years since \r\nthe adoption of the Durban Declaration and Programme \r\nof Action.  \r\n We note the progress made in the implementation \r\nof the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action \r\nand the fight against racism. However, as we meet \r\ntoday, racism continues to pose a challenge in the same \r\nway that it did in 2001. Racism and racial \r\ndiscrimination continue to be a brutal attack on human \r\ndignity and an affront to the self-worth of individuals \r\nand have a prolonged and negative impact on their \r\nvictims.  \r\n We continue to reaffirm our strong conviction \r\nthat racism and racial discrimination are a negation of \r\nthe United Nations Charter and its principles. The \r\nprevalence of racism, xenophobia and other related \r\nintolerance would therefore be an indictment of the \r\nOrganization itself and its Member States. In this tenth \r\nyear, we must reflect with openness and honesty on the \r\nissues that continue to divide us. There is no need to \r\nhave detractors on this question when we have all long \r\nagreed that racism is an affront to humanity and a \r\nnegation of the principles of the United Nations. \r\n We urge the world not to be distracted in this \r\nnoble struggle against racism, racial discrimination, \r\nxenophobia and other related intolerance. We should \r\ncontinue with the same resolve and determination that \r\nled to the end of slavery, colonialism and apartheid. We \r\nwelcome some of the initiatives taken to redress. We \r\nhave since 2001 seen authorities make public apologies \r\nto victims of racism and racial discrimination in some \r\ncountries. Cultural artefacts have been returned to their \r\nplaces of origin in some instances, and in some cases \r\nreparation has been paid. However, there is still a lot of \r\noutstanding work that must be done. Therefore, we \r\nsupport the initiative to erect a permanent memorial to \r\nhonour the victims of slavery and the transatlantic \r\nslave trade as being among the important interventions \r\nthat are urgent and necessary. \r\n We take this opportunity to reaffirm the Durban \r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action as a \r\ncomprehensive United Nations framework for the \r\neradication of racism. We call on all States Members of \r\nthe United Nations and the world in general to reaffirm \r\nour political commitment at the national, regional and \r\ninternational levels fully and effectively to \r\nimplementing the Durban Declaration and Programme \r\nof Action. We encourage all Member States to continue \r\nto adopt measures at the national level to fight the \r\nscourge of racism and effectively implement the \r\nDurban Declaration and Programme of Action.  \r\n In conclusion, racism and racial discrimination \r\ncontinue to pose a challenge to humanity today, and we \r\nneed a collective effort to rid the world of this scourge. \r\nWe look forward to the adoption of the draft \r\ndeclaration (A/66/L.2) at the end of this plenary \r\nmeeting, renewing our political will to continue the full \r\nand effective implementation of the Durban \r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Rahamtallah Mohammed Osman, \r\nUnder-Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of \r\nthe Sudan, who will speak on behalf of the Group of \r\nAfrican States. \r\n Mr. Osman (Sudan): It gives me great honour to \r\naddress this High-level Meeting on behalf of the \r\nAfrican Group to commemorate the tenth anniversary \r\nof the adoption by consensus of the Durban \r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action at the 2001 \r\nWorld Conference against Racism, Racial \r\nDiscrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance in \r\nDurban, South Africa.  \r\n The Durban Declaration and Programme of \r\nAction is the most comprehensive, action-oriented \r\nglobal framework to combat racism, racial \r\ndiscrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. \r\nThe Group welcomes the progress made at the national, \r\nregional and international levels in conformity with the \r\nobligations and commitments of Durban. This event \r\nundoubtedly provides a timely opportunity to assess \r\nthe progress made in implementation of the outcome of \r\nthe Conference, to identify the obstacles and \r\nchallenges encountered, and to find the appropriate \r\nsolutions they require. \r\n Today, we not only commemorate Durban but \r\nreaffirm and renew our firm global political \r\ncommitment to the full and effective implementation of \r\nthe Durban Declaration and Programme of Action and \r\nthe outcome of the Durban Review Conference in \r\n2009. We are also encouraged by those Governments \r\nthat, since the adoption of the Durban Declaration and \r\nProgramme of Action, have adopted landmark and \r\nA/66/PV.14  \r\n \r\n11-50859 6 \r\n \r\nprogressive legislative and administrative measures \r\neffectively to combat racism and racial discrimination, \r\nto protect the rights of migrants and racial, national or \r\nethnic and linguistic minorities, and to combat \r\nincitement to hatred based on religion or belief. \r\n Despite these efforts undertaken by the \r\ninternational community, Governments and local \r\nauthorities, the scourge of racism, racial \r\ndiscrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance \r\npersists and continues to result in violations of human \r\nrights, suffering, disadvantage and violence. We are \r\nalso still concerned that there has been a diminishing \r\nof civil liberties. We are alarmed by these assaults on \r\nhuman rights and the recurrence of violent incidents of \r\nracism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related \r\nintolerance.  \r\n We also note the decisive steps to be taken by \r\nsome Member States, the United Nations system and \r\nthe international community at large to oppose the \r\npersistence of racism, racial discrimination, \r\nxenophobia and related intolerance, and to enhance \r\ndialogue with the aim of understanding and promoting \r\ntolerance and full respect for cultural and ethnic \r\ndiversity. These efforts must be complemented and \r\nstrengthened through responsible media awareness \r\ncampaigns and the promotion of the principles of \r\ntolerance, mutual respect and understanding through \r\neducational systems. \r\n The African Group welcomes the tenth \r\nanniversary commemoration of the adoption of the \r\nDurban Declaration and Programme of Action. The \r\nAfrican Group believes that this commemoration is a \r\nunique opportunity to rebuild a strong international \r\nconsensus and mark the renewal of international \r\nengagement in the struggle against racism, racial \r\ndiscrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance.  \r\n In light of persistent challenges, we should \r\ntranslate our commitment into action and take \r\nappropriate measures to implement the Durban \r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action and the outcome \r\ndocument of the Durban Review Conference, which \r\nconstitute the most comprehensive international \r\nframework in the fight against racism. Furthermore, it \r\nis indispensable to address with greater resolve and \r\npolitical will all forms and manifestations of racism, \r\nracial discrimination, xenophobia and related \r\nintolerance in all spheres of life and in all parts of the \r\nworld, including all those under foreign occupation. \r\n The African Group is pleased that this \r\ncommemoration is well attended and that the draft \r\ndeclaration (A/66/L.2) to be adopted by all \r\nparticipating States at this High-level Meeting will \r\nexpress the will of the international community to be \r\nunited against racism, racial discrimination, \r\nxenophobia and related intolerance. \r\n The Group emphasizes that the momentum \r\ngained by the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the \r\nDurban Declaration and Programme of Action and the \r\nfollow-up mechanisms, particularly within the United \r\nNations system, will further strengthen the Declaration \r\nand create further impetus for the accelerated \r\nimplementation by States and other actors of the \r\nlaudable objectives encapsulated therein. The Durban \r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action adopts a victim-\r\noriented approach to the problems of racism, racial \r\ndiscrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. \r\nSpecific recommendations are formulated to combat \r\ndiscrimination against Africans and persons of African \r\ndescent, Asians and persons of Asian descent, \r\nindigenous peoples, migrants, refugees, minorities, the \r\nRoma and other groups.  \r\n The Group emphasizes that the pledges and \r\ncommitments made must be effectively implemented \r\nby all States, which retain primary responsibility in this \r\nrespect. It reaffirms that the International Convention \r\non the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination \r\nand the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action \r\nremain the basis and fundamental legal framework for the \r\neffective elimination of racism, racial discrimination, \r\nxenophobia and related intolerance. \r\n The Group reiterates that slavery and the slave \r\ntrade, including the transatlantic slave trade, new and \r\nemerging forms of slavery such as human trafficking, \r\napartheid and colonialism, must never be forgotten, \r\nand in this regard welcomes actions undertaken at the \r\npremises of the United Nations in New York to honour \r\nthe memory of victims through the establishment of the \r\nmemorial commemorating the 200-year anniversary of \r\nthe abolition of the transatlantic slave trade and \r\nslavery.  \r\n Furthermore, the Group recalls the adoption of \r\nthe resolution entitled “United Nations Global Plan of \r\nAction to Combat Trafficking in Persons” (resolution \r\n64/293) and urges its implementation. \r\n For the African Group this event will provide an \r\nopportunity for heads of State and Government to \r\n A/66/PV.14\r\n \r\n7 11-50859 \r\n \r\nmobilize political will. It would like to see the tenth \r\nanniversary celebrated in a fitting manner during the \r\nround-table discussion, the culmination of which will \r\nbe the adoption of an outcome that encapsulates the \r\nglobal resolve to end racism and place victims at the \r\ncentre of our deliberations. \r\n Before I conclude, I should like to state that the \r\nAfrican Group supports the proposal made by His \r\nExcellency the President of South Africa to adopt the \r\ndraft declaration (A/66/L.2) at the end of this \r\nmorning’s meeting. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Raden Mohammad Marty Muliana \r\nNatalegawa, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, \r\nwho will speak on behalf of the Asia-Pacific States. \r\n Mr. Natalegawa (Indonesia): On behalf of the \r\nAsia-Pacific Group, allow me to begin by congratulating \r\nyou, Mr. President, on your election to chair this High-\r\nlevel Meeting. I wish also to commend the \r\nco-facilitators and the experts who have deliberated \r\nover and negotiated the scope, modalities, format and \r\norganization of this High-level Meeting, as well as the \r\ndraft political declaration (A/66/L.2) that will be the \r\noutcome product of this event. I am confident that the \r\ntext that we will adopt has been drafted in a balanced \r\nmanner to reflect our many common concerns in the \r\nareas of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and \r\nrelated intolerance. \r\n Today we convene in this Hall of the United \r\nNations to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the \r\nDurban Declaration and Programme of Action. It was \r\n10 years ago that we gathered in South Africa at the \r\nhistoric World Conference against Racism, Racial \r\nDiscrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, \r\nnot merely as Governments but as the peoples of the \r\nworld. The call we made from that World Conference \r\nto the peoples of the world was that we must fight \r\nagainst these prejudices with the greatest determination \r\nand perseverance because they are a sad blight on our \r\ncommon humanity.  \r\n The message from the World Conference against \r\nRacism was crystal clear. The struggle against racism \r\nis a struggle for human rights, dignity and the \r\neradication of poverty. The fact that we adopted a \r\nDeclaration and a Programme of Action underscored \r\nthe truth that if we have the political will to succeed we \r\ncan find consensus on all issues. As a follow-up, in \r\n2009 we met again at the Durban Review Conference \r\nin Geneva to take stock of the implementation of the \r\nDurban Declaration and Programme of Action and to \r\nsee how far we had gone in the battle against racism in \r\nall its manifestations. Collectively we resolved to \r\nreinvigorate the political commitment of Member \r\nStates to pursue the anti-racism agenda in the face of \r\nemerging challenges encapsulated in the outcome \r\ndocument of the Review Conference (A/CONF.211/8, \r\nchap. I). \r\n A decade has passed and we must now ask \r\nourselves whether we have truly unified our efforts to \r\naddress the situation of the victims of racism, racial \r\ndiscrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance \r\nidentified in the Durban Declaration and Programme of \r\nAction. It is therefore a matter of great concern that \r\ndespite the efforts of many groups and many nations, \r\ndespite ample evidence of racism’s terrible toll, racism \r\nstill persists. That is why the eyes of the world, \r\nespecially the eyes of victims, are again upon us today.  \r\n We speak of finding a new unity, as the times \r\ndemand. There must therefore be a concerted effort by \r\nall of us, particularly since new forms and \r\nmanifestations of racism, racial discrimination, \r\nxenophobia and related intolerance continue to emerge. \r\nThat is due to our joint realization that discrimination \r\ndoes not go away by itself. It must be addressed \r\nseriously, otherwise it can become a cause of social \r\nunrest and violence. We must therefore resolve to \r\npursue our common goal of ensuring in all societies the \r\neffective enjoyment of all human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms for all, including the victims of \r\nracism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related \r\nintolerance. \r\n History is replete with terrible wrongs inflicted \r\nthrough lack of respect for the equality of human \r\nbeings. This is manifested in colonialism and other \r\nwars of conquest, slavery, genocide, apartheid, ethnic \r\ncleansing and other atrocities. Despite victory over \r\napartheid, there nevertheless remains a plethora of \r\ndiscriminatory laws and practices that affect the lives \r\nof whole communities in many parts of the world. We \r\nshare the view that slavery, slave trading, colonialism \r\nand apartheid are major historical sources and \r\nmanifestations of racism, racial discrimination and \r\nrelated intolerance. These past practices and policies \r\nare manifest today in the form of poverty, \r\nunderdevelopment, marginalization and socio-economic \r\nexclusion, which have deeply affected developing \r\ncountries over the years.  \r\nA/66/PV.14  \r\n \r\n11-50859 8 \r\n \r\n It is our profound belief that with the \r\nmobilization of political will at national, regional and \r\ninternational levels effectively to implement the \r\nDurban Declaration and Programme of Action, as well \r\nas the outcome documents of the Durban Review \r\nConference by our Governments in concert with all \r\nstakeholders, inter alia civil society and the private \r\nsector, will we be able truly to combat and curb the \r\nscourge of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia \r\nand related intolerance in all spheres of life and in all \r\nparts of the world, including all those under foreign \r\noccupation. \r\n In conclusion, we proclaim our commitment and \r\nstrong determination to make the fight against all forms \r\nand manifestations of racism, racial discrimination, \r\nxenophobia and related intolerance, and the protection \r\nof the victims thereof, a high priority for our respective \r\ncountries. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to the \r\nRepresentative of Romania, who will speak on behalf \r\nof the Eastern European States. \r\n Mrs. Miculescu (Romania): I have the honour to \r\nspeak on behalf of the Group of Eastern European \r\nStates.  \r\n The Declaration and Programme of Action \r\nadopted 10 years ago, which we are now here to \r\ncommemorate, highlight the commitment of the \r\ninternational community to focus its political will on \r\nthe global fight against the scourge of racism, \r\nxenophobia and intolerance. They also showed that \r\ncountries can go beyond inherent political grievances \r\nand unite around a common goal, namely, to put an end \r\nto the phenomenon of racism.  \r\n We can acknowledge that no modern society, \r\nirrespective of its geographical, cultural and \r\ncivilizational specificities or level of development, is \r\nfree from the complex manifestations of racism, racial \r\ndiscrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and \r\nhatred. No country has a perfect record, no society is \r\nbeyond criticism. Therefore, our pledged commitments \r\nin the fight against racism can be successful only \r\nthrough concerted action taken at all levels — local, \r\nnational regional and international. To that end, \r\nalthough some States in our Group are not participating \r\nin today’s meeting, all countries in the Eastern \r\nEuropean Group remain stern and determined \r\nsupporters of the global fight against racism, racial \r\ndiscrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, and \r\nare committed to continue to take measures to further \r\nsecure, at all levels in our societies, the utmost respect \r\nfor all fundamental rights and freedoms and for the \r\nprinciple of universal equality. \r\n Much has been achieved in 10 years, yet much \r\nremains to be done. All of us in our countries at all \r\nlevels and in our respective societies, collectively and \r\nindividually, must make sure that our political \r\ncommitments are translated into actions. Action is \r\nneeded now since, in spite of all our rhetoric and good \r\nintentions, many regrettably continue to be victims of \r\nracism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related \r\nintolerance. All of us should therefore stay committed \r\nand alert in addressing and pre-empting all acts of \r\nincitement to violence, hatred and segregation. We \r\nhave the means, we just need to seize the momentum. \r\n All our efforts aimed at combating racism, \r\nxenophobia, discrimination, extremism and their \r\ndiverse manifestations must be guided by the full \r\nrespect for all fundamental rights and freedoms in \r\naccordance with our obligations under international \r\nhuman rights law. In that regard, universal accession \r\nand ratification of the International Convention on the \r\nElimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and \r\nthe full implementation of its provisions are necessary \r\nin order to ensure the effectiveness of the fight against \r\nracism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related \r\nintolerance. However, we can only note with regret that \r\nwe are still lagging behind not only in its universal \r\nratification but also in its full observance. \r\n While we acknowledge the prime role of national \r\nGovernments in the fight against racism and the \r\nimplementation of the Convention, we must also note \r\nthe key role that the United Nations system plays in \r\nour fight. We highlight the constant efforts of the \r\nHuman Rights Council, the Committee on the \r\nElimination of Racial Discrimination, the Special \r\nRapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, and of \r\nthe relevant regional organizations in the field of \r\ncombating racism and racial discrimination. We must \r\nalso continue positively to engage civil society and the \r\nmedia in complementing our concerted efforts in this \r\nfight. Their contribution is essential since they work \r\nalongside Governments in providing assistance to \r\nvictims of discrimination and contribute, inter alia, to \r\nawareness-raising campaigns and research.  \r\n We have come a long way since the adoption of \r\nthe Declaration adopted in Durban 10 years ago, but \r\n A/66/PV.14\r\n \r\n9 11-50859 \r\n \r\nwe still face many challenges and obstacles on the road \r\ntowards a world free of racism. However, we are \r\nconfident that everything can be overcome in the light \r\nof reason. As Abraham Heschel, a great thinker from \r\nour part of the world, once said, “racism is man’s \r\ngravest threat to man — the maximum hatred for a \r\nminimum of reason”. \r\n In conclusion, let me reiterate that the countries \r\nin our Group will stay committed and actively engaged \r\nin the complex fight against racism, intolerance and \r\ndiscrimination. In doing so, we will stay united in our \r\ndetermination to prevent these acts in the future. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to The \r\nHonourable Mr. Kenneth Baugh, Deputy Prime \r\nMinister and Minister of Foreign Affairs and Foreign \r\nTrade of Jamaica, who will speak on behalf of the \r\nGroup of Latin American and Caribbean States. \r\n Mr. Baugh (Jamaica): I have the honour to speak \r\non behalf of the Group of Latin American and \r\nCaribbean States at this High-level Meeting to \r\ncommemorate the tenth anniversary of the adoption of \r\nthe Durban Declaration and Programme of Action \r\nunder the theme “Victims of racism, racial \r\ndiscrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance: \r\nrecognition, justice and development”.  \r\n Ten years ago in Durban, the international \r\ncommunity courageously took a stand to eliminate \r\nfrom our world the scourge of racism, racial \r\ndiscrimination, xenophobia and other intolerance. \r\nToday we take stock of the strides taken over the years \r\nto achieve the goals and objectives set forth in the \r\nDurban Declaration and Programme of Action. We are \r\nequally mindful that, notwithstanding our efforts, much \r\nmore needs to be done if we are fully to realize those \r\ngoals and objectives. \r\n We note the progress achieved at the \r\nintergovernmental level with the creation of the \r\nWorking Group of Experts on People of African \r\nDescent and the Special Rapporteur on contemporary \r\nforms of racism and the Independent Expert on \r\nminority issues. We are conscious that many of our \r\nGovernments, at the national level, have sought to \r\nprotect the diverse and multicultural nature of their \r\nsocieties. Some States have created specialized \r\nnational mechanisms to combat racism, racial \r\ndiscrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, and \r\nto promote equality, justice and dignity, while in others \r\nlegislation, as well as national plans and policies, \r\nincluding affirmative action measures, have been \r\nadopted that will ensure that minorities and vulnerable \r\ngroups can be fully integrated into society. We reiterate \r\nour commitment to enhance the work and functioning \r\nof national mechanisms to combat racism, racial \r\ndiscrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance.  \r\n However, despite the progress made in combating \r\nracism, the effective implementation of the Durban \r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action has not been \r\nsatisfactory. We acknowledge that the Durban process \r\nis a work in progress, which will require the combined \r\neffort of every member of the international community \r\nif we are to eliminate these atrocities from our midst. \r\nTo that end, we hope that this meeting will serve as a \r\ncatalyst for united action in formulating concrete \r\nstrategies to achieve our objective to recognize the \r\nvictims of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia \r\nand related intolerance, and to provide them with \r\njustice, dignity and a fair chance for realizing their full \r\npotential, as well as raising racism as a global concern. \r\n Member States from the Latin American and \r\nCaribbean region have been supportive of, and have \r\nactively participated in, the work to promote the goals \r\nand objectives of the Durban Declaration and \r\nProgramme of Action. We reaffirm our unwavering \r\ncommitment to achieving a world free of racial \r\nintolerance and other injustices. We must be mindful \r\nthat victims in many parts of the world continue to \r\nsuffer from violence on the basis of their ethnic origin \r\nor religious affiliation. Migrants and migrant workers \r\nare still easy targets for manifestations of racism and \r\nxenophobia and racial discrimination.  \r\n We therefore call upon Member States to develop \r\npolicies and programmes to protect the rights of \r\nmigrants and migrant workers. In that regard, \r\nindigenous peoples and persons with disabilities also \r\nsuffer grave forms of racial discrimination and related \r\nintolerance and require specific measures to promote \r\ntheir participation in society and the full realization of \r\ntheir human rights.  \r\n Negative stereotyping of persons based on their \r\nreligion or belief, and an increase in incidents related \r\nto religious hatred, are still factors that must be \r\naddressed, both at the national and international levels. \r\nThe proliferation of hate speech also remains a \r\nchallenge in many parts of the world, exacerbated by \r\nthe misuse of new technologies for mass dissemination \r\nof negative and/or stereotypical information. It is \r\nA/66/PV.14  \r\n \r\n11-50859 10 \r\n \r\ntherefore necessary for all Member States to promote \r\ngreater levels of social inclusion, which is essential in \r\norder to reduce racial discrimination and related \r\nintolerance.  \r\n The Member States of the Group of Latin \r\nAmerican and Caribbean States remain convinced that \r\nintercultural dialogue, tolerance, education and respect \r\nfor diversity are useful approaches for the international \r\ncommunity to embark on a common and consensual \r\nglobal programme of action to combat these scourges. \r\nIt is also necessary to address the root causes and to \r\ntake a broad range of preventive and corrective \r\nmeasures, including legislative action where \r\nappropriate, to eliminate acts of racism, racial \r\ndiscrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance.  \r\n Today’s commemoration of the tenth anniversary \r\nof the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action \r\npresents another opportunity to mobilize political will \r\nfor global resolve to end racism and place victims at \r\nthe centre of our deliberations. In that context, the \r\nGroup emphasizes that renewed emphasis and adequate \r\nfunding for the follow-up mechanisms, as well as \r\nsustained international cooperation, are indispensable \r\nto addressing all forms and manifestations of racism, \r\nracial discrimination, xenophobia and related \r\nintolerance. \r\n We are pleased with the decision taken by the \r\nGeneral Assembly to erect a permanent memorial to \r\nhonour the victims of slavery and the transatlantic slave \r\ntrade. We encourage Member States, non-governmental \r\norganizations, the private sector and private individuals \r\nto support this and other initiatives that will serve to \r\nenhance the visibility of the message of the Declaration \r\nand Programme of Action. This year, as we celebrate \r\nthe International Year for People of African Descent, \r\nthe memorial takes on added significance, showcasing \r\nour determination to ensure that this historical wrong \r\nand its associated residual effects of racism and racial \r\ndiscrimination will never again be repeated. \r\n In conclusion, the Member States of the Group of \r\nLatin American and Caribbean States reaffirm the \r\nDurban Declaration and Programme of Action and the \r\noutcome (A/CONF.211/8, chap. I) of the 2009 Durban \r\nReview Conference, as well as our commitment to its \r\nfull and effective implementation. We are convinced \r\nthat the Durban process, if given the necessary support \r\nof all Member States, can result in the eradication of \r\nall forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia \r\nand related intolerance, thus allowing people \r\neverywhere to experience the full enjoyment of their \r\nfundamental human rights and freedoms. We look \r\nforward to the adoption of the draft political \r\ndeclaration (A/66/L.2) at the end of this morning’s \r\nmeeting. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of Monaco, who will speak on behalf of \r\nthe Group of Western European and Other States. \r\n Ms. Picco (Monaco) (spoke in French): The \r\nGroup of Western European and Other States, on behalf \r\nof which I have the honour to speak, has acknowledged \r\nthat racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and \r\nrelated intolerance undermine the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter. By belonging \r\nto the human family, we are born free and equal in \r\ndignity and rights and should act towards each another \r\nin a spirit of fellowship without making any \r\ndistinction.  \r\n In building on the progress already made, it is our \r\ncommon responsibility to promote the fight against \r\nracism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related \r\nintolerance — scourges that persist in all of our \r\ncountries and threaten the foundations of our \r\ndemocratic societies, namely, the rule of law and \r\nrespect for human rights. \r\n While a number of countries of our Group are not \r\nparticipating in today’s event, and in spite of the fact \r\nthat some States do not participate in this process, we \r\nall renew our unwavering commitment to pursue at \r\ninternational, regional and national levels the \r\nimplementation of effective measures to fight these \r\nscourges, to end impunity and to mainstream the \r\npromotion of equality and equal opportunities into all \r\nGovernment policies.  \r\n The Western European and Other States Group \r\nreaffirms its solidarity with the numerous victims of \r\nracism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related \r\nintolerance who continue to be flouted and trampled \r\nupon throughout the world. Each victim must be \r\nrecognized and receive the same attention. \r\n Whatever the source, cause, form or \r\nmanifestation, racism and racial discrimination \r\nundermine human dignity and must be combated in \r\norder to avoid the denial of human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms of the human person. We attach \r\nthe utmost importance to education, training and \r\n A/66/PV.14\r\n \r\n11 11-50859 \r\n \r\nprevention, as they allow for a better understanding of \r\nthe phenomena to be fought and to promote the \r\nrichness of our differences and respect for our \r\ndiversity.  \r\n We take this opportunity to reiterate our call for \r\nthe universal ratification and full and effective \r\nimplementation of the International Convention on the \r\nElimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, an \r\ninstrument to which all of the members of our Group \r\nare parties as well as the main legal instrument to \r\nprevent, combat and eradicate racism, racial \r\ndiscrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to Ms. Sarah \r\nWhite, Board President of the Mississippi Workers’ \r\nCenter for Human Rights. \r\n Ms. White (Mississippi Workers’ Center for \r\nHuman Rights): On behalf of the countless victims of \r\nracial discrimination throughout the world, it is an \r\nhonour to carry these voices here today. I bring to the \r\nAssembly greetings from the Mississippi Workers’ \r\nCenter for Human Rights, where I serve as the \r\nPresident of the Board of Directors.  \r\n The Center was founded by long-time human \r\nrights activist Ms. Jaribu Hill in 1996. Located in the \r\nMississippi delta, the Center fights for the dignity and \r\nhuman rights of low-wage African-American workers \r\nand all those who languish in extreme poverty.  \r\n But I am here today as the voice of those who \r\nhave been excluded, marginalized, violated and denied \r\ntheir basic human rights. When I sat on the Voices of \r\nVictims panel at the World Conference in Durban in \r\n2001 and then again at the Durban Review Conference \r\nin 2009, I spoke about the history of the struggles of \r\nMississippi catfish workers and the battles we faced \r\nevery day for human rights and justice. I described \r\nhow we as black women had to stand on our feet for \r\n12 hours a day in ankle-deep water that contained \r\nchlorine and other harmful chemicals. That \r\ncontaminated water caused severe skin rashes and \r\nother serious physical ailments. White male \r\nsupervisors would force us to speed up our work on the \r\nassembly line so that the company could make \r\nmaximum profit. The bosses did not care about the \r\nhealth and well-being of the workers. Supervisors \r\nwould terrorize us, making threats: “Speed up or lose \r\nyour job”. We were sexually and racially harassed on a \r\ndaily basis. We were denied bathroom privileges. \r\nThose are some of the conditions that workers \r\nencounter every day today in the catfish and poultry \r\nplants. These indignities are suffered by us as workers \r\nbecause of our skin colour and economic class. \r\n I am here today to let everyone know that we rose \r\nup and fought to get justice and human rights. We held \r\nlabour strikes and won battles and began a workers’ \r\nrights movement all over the state. Plants began to \r\norganize. Although we won many battles, we still must \r\ncontinue the struggle. There is racial profanity, \r\nintimidation and harassment on a daily basis. Even \r\ntoday, extrajudicial killings still take place. Workplaces \r\nare still racially segregated. Black workers are still \r\nassigned to the dirtiest and most dangerous jobs and \r\nforced to work in conditions that look a lot like slavery. \r\nPeople are still dying to make a living.  \r\n The Center started 15 years ago by assisting low-\r\nwage African-American workers, but we help all \r\nworkers. We give workers a platform to organize \r\nthemselves to fight against racial injustices. We \r\neducate them about their rights and about laws. We \r\nalso work on housing and other community issues. We \r\nwork through a network of lawyers, organization \r\neducators, teachers, women’s groups, social workers \r\nand everyday people who are dedicated to protecting \r\nhuman rights. Students from all across the United \r\nStates and throughout the world come to the Center as \r\ninterns and help us to work on cases, educate workers, \r\nput out flyers in the community, work with prisoners \r\nand people just released from prison to make sure their \r\nrights are not violated when it comes to jobs. They help \r\nus to do all the groundwork in home work and \r\ncommunity outreach.  \r\n All kinds of people come to help: rich and poor, \r\nwhite and black, indigenous, from different \r\nbackgrounds and different religions. The Center is a \r\nspace for the community to come together to educate \r\nworkers. Most importantly, we work with youth to \r\nfight injustices and prevent discrimination in the \r\nfuture. We hold town hall meetings to discuss \r\neducational issues in the community, such as the fact \r\nthat there are not enough schoolbooks. We work very \r\nhard with little. Funding is a big concern for us. \r\n The World Conference against Racism and the \r\nDurban Review Conference are experiences that I will \r\nnever forget. I saw that the work we do is very much \r\nthe kind of work that every civil society group does \r\nthroughout the world. I know that people are going \r\nthrough the exact same thing, only in a different place. \r\nA/66/PV.14  \r\n \r\n11-50859 12 \r\n \r\nI remember meeting so many amazing people in \r\nDurban, South Africa. I saw people from throughout \r\nthe world standing up for their rights. I met other \r\nvictims of racial discrimination. Their courage was so \r\npowerful. I keep in touch with many of them and we \r\nhelp each other out still today.  \r\n The Conference gave me hope that I could go \r\nback and continue to fight in my community. I think I \r\nhave done that. I really want us to come together on the \r\nsame front to make sure that Governments have open \r\nears to these issues that affect us as human beings. \r\nPoliticians must be held accountable for what they do. \r\nAfter we elect them, we must make sure that they \r\nremember the needs of the victims and protect our \r\nrights.  \r\n Most countries have not advanced very far from \r\nwhere they were 10 years ago in Durban. There is still \r\nmassive unemployment and problems with \r\ndiscrimination in the education and prison systems. \r\nThere are still problems with health care and workers’ \r\nrights. Today is a chance for Governments to come \r\ntogether and rise up against racism. I hope that they do \r\nnot waste this chance. The Durban Declaration and \r\nProgramme of Action are important in helping give \r\npeople hope and opportunity. This fight is about our \r\nstruggle — the struggle of people of African descent, \r\npeople of Asian descent, indigenous people, women, \r\nchildren, minorities — and our strength comes from \r\norganizing and bringing our voices together on one \r\nplatform to make the Durban Declaration and \r\nProgramme of Action work. \r\n The President: We have heard the last speaker \r\ninscribed on my list. \r\n As members will recall, the Assembly decided in \r\nits resolution 65/279 that the High-level Meeting \r\nwould adopt the draft political declaration (A/66/L.2) \r\nat the closing plenary meeting. Members will also \r\nrecall that the President of the Republic of South \r\nAfrica and the Under-Secretary of the Ministry of \r\nForeign Affairs of the Sudan, who spoke on behalf of \r\nthe African States, proposed this morning that \r\nconsideration of and action on the political declaration \r\nshould take place at this opening plenary meeting.  \r\n May I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt \r\nthe draft political declaration at this opening plenary \r\nmeeting? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): The General \r\nAssembly will now take action on draft resolution \r\nA/66/L.2, entitled “United against racism, racial \r\ndiscrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance”. \r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly wishes to \r\nadopt draft resolution A/66/L.2? \r\n Draft resolution A/66/L.2 was adopted (resolution \r\n66/3). \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): On this \r\noccasion, I should like to express my sincere thanks to \r\nMr. Tommo Monthe, Permanent Representative of \r\nCameroon, and Ms. Isabelle Picco, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Monaco, who so ably and patiently \r\nconducted the discussions and complex negotiations in \r\nthe informal consultations so as to bring them to a \r\nsuccessful conclusion. I am sure that members of the \r\nGeneral Assembly join me in extending to them our \r\nsincere appreciation.  \r\n  The meeting rose at 11.05 a.m. \r\n"
