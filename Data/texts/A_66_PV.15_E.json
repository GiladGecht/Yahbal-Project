I express the \r\nsupport of the Cypriot delegation, and I wish you every \r\nsuccess in fulfilling your duties. \r\n Over the past six months we have witnessed \r\nhistoric changes in the wider region of the Middle East \r\nand North Africa, a region which is very close to \r\nCyprus. A popular movement has developed in this \r\nregion with the aim of implementing fundamental \r\ndemocratic reforms. The reforms are a sovereign affair \r\nfor the peoples. We hope that they are achieved \r\npeacefully, without bloodshed and for the benefit of the \r\npeoples themselves, through political dialogue and \r\nwith the support of the international community. We, \r\nthe international community, should offer this support \r\nwhile respecting the sovereignty and the territorial \r\nintegrity of the Member States of the United Nations. \r\n The Republic of Cyprus has experienced \r\nviolence, and we still suffer from its consequences. \r\nCyprus is still suffering the effects of the illegal \r\nTurkish invasion of 1974 and the ongoing occupation. \r\nThe Cyprus problem is first and foremost a problem of \r\ninvasion and occupation and the violation of \r\ninternational law and of the human rights of Cypriot \r\ncitizens. \r\n Since the Turkish invasion in 1974, our goal has \r\nbeen a peaceful resolution of the problem through \r\nnegotiations between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish \r\nCypriot communities under the auspices of the \r\nSecretary-General and on the basis of Security Council \r\nand General Assembly resolutions on Cyprus. \r\n Since September 2008, we have undertaken a \r\nrenewed effort to solve the Cyprus problem, under the \r\nauspices of the United Nations, through direct \r\nnegotiations between the leaders of the two \r\ncommunities, upon our initiative. This effort is focused \r\non the evolution of the unitary State into a federal one, \r\nwith two federated units with political equality as \r\ndefined in relevant Security Council resolutions — one \r\nState, with a single sovereignty, a single citizenship \r\nand a single international personality. This basis was \r\nreaffirmed by the leaders of the two communities in \r\n2008, when they agreed on the resumption of \r\nnegotiations. \r\nA/66/PV.15  \r\n \r\n11-50865 2 \r\n \r\n At the same time, the negotiating process, under \r\nthe auspices of the United Nations, was agreed. The \r\nnegotiations are Cypriot-led and Cypriot-owned, as \r\nwas agreed with the Secretary-General, excluding any \r\nform of arbitration or artificial time frames. This was \r\nagreed, bearing in mind recent negative experiences \r\nthat resulted from unsuccessful attempts to solve the \r\nproblem. \r\n We aim to achieve a mutually agreed solution, \r\nterminating the occupation and the illegal colonization \r\nby Turkey with settlers in the occupied part of Cyprus. \r\nWe seek a solution that reunifies the country and its \r\npeople and creates conditions of lasting peace and \r\nsecurity on the island. \r\n An important aspect of the Cyprus problem, of a \r\nhumanitarian nature, is the issue of missing persons. \r\nThis issue must be settled regardless of the \r\ndevelopments in the negotiations. Turkey must fulfil its \r\nobligations, which stem from the judgments of the \r\nEuropean Court of Human Rights, to allow \r\nexhumations in military areas and open the archives of \r\nits army and of other services, in order to determine the \r\nfate of the missing persons. \r\n During the first two years of direct negotiations \r\nbetween the leaders of the two communities, \r\nconvergences have been reached on various aspects of \r\nthe Cyprus problem. I regret to note that, lately in \r\nparticular, the Turkish Cypriot side is backtracking, \r\neven from convergences that had been found. This \r\nchange in the stance of the Turkish Cypriot leadership \r\ndraws on the recent negative and provocative policy of \r\nTurkey in the region. \r\n In recent years, the Republic of Cyprus has \r\nstarted a process for the exploration and potential \r\nextraction of hydrocarbons within its exclusive \r\neconomic zone. This was preceded by agreements to \r\ndelimit the exclusive economic zone with neighbouring \r\ncountries, always within the framework of international \r\nlaw, in particular the United Nations Convention on the \r\nLaw of the Sea, which the Republic of Cyprus has \r\nratified. We anticipate that this effort will contribute to \r\nthe discovery of new energy resources, particularly for \r\nEurope, and of course for the shared benefit of our \r\npeople, Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots alike. \r\n We believe that the possible discovery and \r\nextraction of hydrocarbons will constitute yet another \r\nstrong motive for Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots \r\nto expedite a just, functional and viable solution to the \r\nCyprus problem, so that both communities can enjoy \r\nthe natural wealth of our country in conditions of \r\npeace, security and prosperity. I wish to reassure our \r\nTurkish Cypriot compatriots that, regardless of the \r\ncircumstances, they would benefit from the possible \r\ndiscovery and extraction of hydrocarbons. \r\n Unfortunately, the effort of the Republic of \r\nCyprus to exercise its sovereign right to exploit its \r\nmarine wealth is met by threats by Turkey against \r\nCyprus. Turkish naval manoeuvres in the region of \r\nCyprus’s exclusive economic zone, where explorations \r\nare being carried out, are provocative and constitute a \r\nreal danger of further complications in the region. At \r\nthe same time, Turkey has continued its illegal actions \r\nby concluding an agreement with the illegal regime in \r\nthe occupied area of the Republic of Cyprus in order to \r\npursue exploration within the exclusive economic zone \r\nof the Republic of Cyprus. \r\n From this rostrum, I wish to condemn that illegal \r\nact, which constitutes a provocation not only for the \r\nRepublic of Cyprus but for the entire international \r\ncommunity. Instead of adopting a constructive stance \r\nin the negotiations for a speedy solution to the Cyprus \r\nproblem, Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot leadership are \r\ntrying to create tension and new, illegal faits \r\naccomplis. Ankara’s latest threats directed at a \r\nEuropean Union (EU) member State come at a time \r\nwhen Turkey is seeking to open new chapters in its EU \r\naccession negotiations. \r\n We wish to express our gratitude to the \r\npermanent and non-permanent members of the Security \r\nCouncil, and to the European Union, for the clear \r\nposition they have taken in defending the sovereign \r\nrights of the Republic of Cyprus. We call on the \r\nSecurity Council, the Secretariat and the United \r\nNations in general to impress upon the Turkish \r\nleadership that any threat to or violation of the \r\nsovereignty of the Republic of Cyprus, or any \r\ncontinuing violation of international and European law, \r\nwill not be tolerated. \r\n We are fully committed to continuing to work \r\ntowards a solution of the Cyprus problem, within the \r\nagreed framework and on the basis of the agreed \r\nprocess, as soon as possible. Considering that it is first \r\nand foremost the Cypriot people who are suffering \r\nfrom the continuing occupation, it is only natural for us \r\nto demonstrate goodwill and exert all our efforts to \r\nreach a just, viable and functional solution to the \r\n A/66/PV.15\r\n \r\n3 11-50865 \r\n \r\nCyprus problem and for the reunification of the State \r\nand our people. \r\n We will continue to work to strengthen \r\ncooperation and trust between Greek and Turkish \r\nCypriots. A rapprochement of the two communities is \r\nintegral to our policy. We are continuing with our \r\ninitiatives aimed at creating the conditions conducive \r\nto a solution. We recall our proposal for the restitution \r\nof Famagusta — a European city, uninhabited since \r\n1974 as a result of the Turkish occupation — to its \r\nlawful inhabitants, under United Nations \r\nadministration. Our proposal also includes the use of \r\nthe city’s port by Turkish Cypriots under EU \r\nsupervision.  \r\n The implementation of this proposal will \r\nsignificantly boost negotiations and increase trust \r\nbetween the two communities; that will also lead to the \r\nunfreezing of negotiations chapters in Turkey’s EU \r\naccession process. We recall that the handover of the \r\nuninhabited area of Famagusta to United Nations \r\nadministration, and the return of its lawful inhabitants, \r\nis called for in Security Council resolution 550 (1984), \r\nwhich Turkey refuses to implement. \r\n We would like to express our gratitude to the \r\nUnited Nations, under whose auspices the talks \r\nbetween the leaders of the two communities are being \r\ncarried out. We thank the Security Council and the \r\nSecretary-General himself for his good offices.  \r\n It is to the Secretary-General’s credit that during \r\nhis recent meetings with the leaders of the two \r\ncommunities he persistently sought reaffirmation of the \r\nbasis for the negotiations from both sides. He has \r\nreferred specifically to Security Council resolution \r\n1251 (1999), which provides that the solution to the \r\nCyprus problem shall be a bi-zonal, bi-communal \r\nfederation with political equality, as defined in the \r\nSecurity Council resolutions: a State with a single \r\nsovereignty, a single citizenship and a single \r\ninternational personality, excluding any form of union, \r\nin whole or in part, with any other country as well as \r\nany form of partition or secession. That is the basis that \r\nthe United Nations continues to support. \r\n We are also grateful that the Secretary-General \r\nhas asked for the reaffirmation of the convergences that \r\nwere previously agreed on in the framework of the \r\ntalks. As I have mentioned, the Turkish Cypriot leader \r\nhas unfortunately retreated from previous agreements \r\nof fundamental importance. We believe that the only \r\nway to move forward and reach a solution as soon as \r\npossible is by upholding the commitments that both \r\nsides have undertaken in the presence of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. Negotiations should be carried out on a clear \r\nbasis and without backtracking. \r\n The long-standing dispute in the Middle East is \r\nnow characterized by frozen negotiations. It is vitally \r\nimportant that the peace process be resumed on the \r\nbasis of the principles established by the international \r\ncommunity in its resolutions. Cyprus supports the \r\nresumption of negotiations and calls on both sides to \r\nengage with honesty and goodwill, without creating \r\nnew faits accomplis.  \r\n Israelis and Palestinians alike deserve a peaceful, \r\nstable and secure future within a framework of two \r\nindependent States. We maintain our principled \r\nposition for a free and independent Palestinian State, \r\nnext to the State of Israel, within the 1967 borders.  \r\n It has been 10 years since the attacks on the \r\nWorld Trade Center here in New York. Cyprus \r\ncontinues to support the collective efforts of the \r\ninternational community, based on international law, to \r\neliminate international terrorism. We support the \r\nimplementation of the necessary measures, including \r\nthe adoption of a comprehensive convention on \r\ninternational terrorism. \r\n Most countries in the world are still in the grip of \r\nthe global financial crisis. This crisis proves that a new \r\nmodel of growth must prevail, focused on reducing \r\nsocial inequalities, eradicating poverty and \r\nsafeguarding the rights of workers and all other people. \r\nSpecial emphasis must be given to the fairer \r\ndistribution of social goods, such as health and \r\neducation, and to ending the market’s impunity and \r\nlack of regulation. Emphasis must also be given to \r\ndealing with social repercussions, such as \r\nunemployment, delinquency, crime and social \r\nmarginalization — problems that cause social tensions \r\nand conflicts in a number of countries in Europe and \r\nthe world. \r\n There can be no doubt that building prosperity \r\nand global stability on solid foundations cannot be \r\naccomplished without protecting the environment and \r\nour planet and promoting the sustainable use of its \r\nresources.  \r\n In conclusion, I wish to stress that there is no way \r\nto deal with the challenges facing humankind today \r\nA/66/PV.15  \r\n \r\n11-50865 4 \r\n \r\nother than collective action. We will succeed only if we \r\nrealize that our future must be characterized by mutual \r\nrespect, the fairer distribution and redistribution of \r\nglobal wealth, social progress and equality, and the \r\nprevalence of international law and human rights.  \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Cyprus for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Demetris Christofias, President of the \r\nRepublic of Cyprus, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete, President of \r\nthe United Republic of Tanzania \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the United Republic of \r\nTanzania. \r\n Mr. Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete, President of the \r\nUnited Republic of Tanzania, was escorted into \r\nthe General Assembly Hall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete, \r\nPresident of the United Republic of Tanzania, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Kikwete: I congratulate you, Sir, on \r\nyour well-deserved election as President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-sixth session. My delegation has \r\nfull confidence in you, and we assure you of our full \r\nsupport and cooperation. I also thank and congratulate \r\nyour predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss, for \r\nvery ably steering the affairs of the sixty-fifth session. \r\nA lot has been achieved, which, I have no doubt, you \r\nwill consolidate and advance. \r\n Allow me also to take this opportunity to extend \r\nmy heartfelt congratulations to our illustrious Secretary-\r\nGeneral, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-Moon, on his well-\r\ndeserved second mandate. His reappointment reaffirms \r\nthe trust that we have in him and in his leadership skills. \r\nIt is also recognition of his dedicated service to the \r\nUnited Nations and humankind as a whole. \r\n Once again, I congratulate and welcome the \r\nnewest member of the United Nations family, the \r\nRepublic of South Sudan, and assure them of \r\nTanzania’s continued friendship and cooperation. \r\n This year the United Republic of Tanzania, which \r\nis a union between two sovereign States — the \r\nPeople’s Republic of Zanzibar and the Republic of \r\nTanganyika — will celebrate 50 years of the \r\nindependence of Tanganyika. We will also celebrate 50 \r\nyears of our membership in the United Nations. I stand \r\nbefore the Assembly today, 50 years later, to reiterate \r\nthat same faith in, and that same commitment to, the \r\nUnited Nations as expressed by the founders of our \r\ndear nation. I am proud that Tanzania has remained \r\nfaithful to the ideals of the United Nations, and is a \r\nproactive Member of this body. We promise to stay the \r\ncourse for the next 50 years and beyond. \r\n The people of Tanzania are happy to have had the \r\nopportunity to contribute to maintaining peace and \r\nsecurity in Africa and other parts of the world. We have \r\nalways believed that mediation, conflict prevention and \r\npacific settlement of disputes are the best means of \r\nresolving conflicts. As a result, Tanzania has been in \r\nthe forefront of mediation efforts to resolve conflicts in \r\nthe countries around us, in our region and elsewhere on \r\nthe continent. \r\n Our country also has been contributing troops, \r\npolice, corrections officers and civilian personnel to \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping missions and through \r\nregional and sub-regional arrangements. We promise to \r\ncontinue to do so wherever and whenever asked. More \r\nimportant, we are humbled to have had the rare \r\nopportunity to pioneer the efforts, together with \r\nDenmark, that lead to the creation of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission in 2006. \r\n We are also proud to have had, in the 50 years of \r\nour membership in the United Nations, the opportunity \r\nto contribute to the decolonization of Africa and other \r\nparts of the world. At independence, the founding \r\nfather of our nation, the late Mwalimu Julius Nyerere, \r\nsaid that the independence of our country was \r\nincomplete until all countries of Africa were free.  \r\n That guided Tanzania to strongly oppose all \r\nforms of colonialism, apartheid and racial \r\ndiscrimination on the African continent and elsewhere. \r\nIt also informed our resolve to help our brothers and \r\nsisters who were fighting for their independence and \r\nfreedom in Africa. We had the honour of hosting the \r\nheadquarters of the African Liberation Committee in \r\nDar-es-Salaam until colonialism, apartheid and \r\nminority rule had been dismantled.  \r\n A/66/PV.15\r\n \r\n5 11-50865 \r\n \r\n We gave sanctuary as well as moral and material \r\nsupport to almost all the liberation movements of \r\nSouthern Africa. Here at the United Nations, Tanzania \r\nwas afforded the rare honour of chairing the United \r\nNations Special Committee on Decolonization from \r\n1972 to 1980. That was the critical phase in the \r\ndecolonization of Africa and in the struggle against \r\napartheid and minority rule. It is heart-warming indeed \r\nto see our efforts, sacrifices and contributions being \r\nrewarded so handsomely with the independence of all \r\nAfrican countries and with apartheid having been \r\ndismantled in South Africa.  \r\n Only Western Sahara remains outstanding. I hope \r\nthe United Nations will expedite the process so that the \r\nSaharawi people can determine their future peacefully. \r\n We believed at independence, as we believe now \r\nand always will believe, that all human beings are born \r\nequal and deserve equal protection of their civil, \r\npolitical, economic, social and cultural rights, as \r\noutlined in what has come to be known as the \r\nInternational Bill of Rights. This guides what we are \r\ndoing at home, with regard to promoting democracy, \r\nthe rule of law, human rights, including personal \r\nfreedoms, among them the freedom of expression. \r\n It is in this spirit also that I wish to reaffirm our \r\nsolidarity with the Palestinian people in their rightful \r\nquest for an independent homeland. Our plea is for the \r\nfulfilment of the vision of two States: the State of \r\nIsrael and a sovereign, independent, democratic and \r\nviable State of Palestine, living side by side in peace \r\nand harmony. That is why we also remain in full \r\nsolidarity with the people of Cuba in demanding the \r\nend to the embargo. It is perhaps the longest-lasting \r\nembargo in history. The people in these three \r\ncountries — Israel, Palestine and Cuba — have \r\nsuffered for far too long. It is time their burdens are \r\neased. \r\n Our other goal was and still is the attainment of \r\nAfrican unity. We believe in the strength of unity for us \r\nto be able to effectively face up to and overcome the \r\ndaunting political, security and development \r\nchallenges facing our continent. It was in pursuit of \r\nthis ideal that on 26 April 1964, Zanzibar and \r\nTanganyika merged to form the United Republic of \r\nTanzania. We will never tire in our efforts towards the \r\nrealization of the dream of the founding fathers of a \r\nUnited States of Africa. However, we are mindful of \r\nthe fact that this will be a gradual process and regional \r\neconomic integration and regional groupings will be its \r\nfoundation and the building blocks. \r\n After 50 years of independence and 50 years of \r\nour membership of the United Nations, Tanzania \r\nremains a firm believer in the indispensability of \r\nmultilateralism. It is through multilateralism that we \r\ncan bring all nations and therefore all peoples together \r\nto shape their common present and future and that of \r\nthe world they live in. It is through multilateralism that \r\npeace and development will be guaranteed for all \r\nnations, through the pursuit of common values. It is for \r\nthese reasons that I believe the United Nations is \r\nrelevant today, as it was 66 years ago. It is for the same \r\nreasons that the world needs the other multilateral \r\ninstitutions for global economic, social and political \r\ngovernance. \r\n Despite acknowledging the importance of various \r\nmultilateral institutions, Tanzania is of the view that \r\nthey need to undergo serious reforms to overcome the \r\nserious governance deficits within them. We need \r\nreforms that will make them more representative — in \r\nparticular, reforms that will increase the voices of the \r\ndeveloping countries. The original structures have \r\nignored us. We should not allow this to continue. It is \r\nfor this reason that Tanzania supported the calls for \r\nreforms of the Bretton Woods institutions, the United \r\nNations, the World Trade Organization and the other \r\nmultilateral institutions.  \r\n With regard to the United Nations, we should \r\nexpedite the process of reforming the Security Council, \r\nin both categories, and in doing so include developing \r\ncountries, particularly those from Africa, Asia and \r\nLatin America. It is sad to see that no serious progress \r\nhas been made for close to two decades. Now is the \r\ntime for us to start serious negotiations, negotiate in \r\nearnest and conclude at the earliest possible time. \r\n Promoting development, particularly shared \r\ngrowth, has been one of the core functions of the \r\nUnited Nations. It is pleasing to note that the United \r\nNations has remained steadfast in its discharge of this \r\nfunction through its agencies and through a number of \r\ninitiatives undertaken by the United Nations \r\nHeadquarters itself. United Nations leadership has \r\nalways been noticeable in all the major socio-economic \r\nchallenges facing the world: sustainable development, \r\nhealth care, maternal and child health, poverty, food \r\nsecurity, education, and so on. This involvement and \r\nleadership underscores the relevance of the United \r\nA/66/PV.15  \r\n \r\n11-50865 6 \r\n \r\nNations today and the United Nations tomorrow and \r\nthe day after tomorrow. \r\n However, the good intentions of the United \r\nNations have not been fully realized. Some of the \r\ndeveloped countries have not met their commitments of \r\nallocating 0.7 per cent of their gross domestic product \r\nto official development assistance. Let me use this \r\nopportunity to join all those who have spoken before \r\nme in repeating our appeal to developed countries to \r\nhonour their commitments.  \r\n I believe that if this had been done, we would \r\nhave been on target with the implementation of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals and many other \r\nimportant global matters. I would also like to use this \r\nopportunity to thank and commend those few \r\ndeveloped countries that have kept their promise. May \r\nthe examples of these countries inform and encourage \r\nthe others to do the same. \r\n We meet at a time of great uncertainties over the \r\nglobal economy. Economies are still weak, \r\ncharacterized by low growth in many major economies, \r\nhigh levels of inflation, unemployment, increasing \r\nfood and fuel prices and nervous financial markets. In \r\na globalized world, ripples of economic and financial \r\ncrises in the developed economies affect all of us in the \r\nworld. And for us from poor developing countries, \r\nmatter get even more complicated.  \r\n As we all call for concerted global action to \r\nmaintain economic stability and ensure that we do not \r\nhead into another global recession, I appeal to the \r\nUnited Nations to remain seized of the situation and \r\nexercise its traditional leadership over global issues.  \r\n This is a matter of great concern to us in Africa, a \r\ncontinent that has experienced extremely challenging \r\neconomic, social and political situations, but a \r\ncontinent that is now poised to go to the next level: \r\nfrom despair to hope and from lost decades to decades \r\nfull of opportunities.  \r\n Democracy is steadily on the march in Africa and \r\nthe Arab Spring has capped it all. Peace is reigning \r\nalmost all over the continent. There are no serious \r\nconflict situations except for Somalia, where the \r\nserious involvement of the United Nations, the African \r\nUnion and the world community is still needed. All \r\nthat Africa needs now is continued support to build the \r\ninstitutions of democracy and governance, to build our \r\neconomies and to overcome social challenges.  \r\n Among the challenges demanding the serious \r\nattention of this body and the international community \r\nat large is the continued drought in the Horn of Africa \r\nand some countries of East Africa. The problem has not \r\nabated and its consequences are momentous, as \r\nexemplified by the ongoing famine in Somalia. It is \r\nhigh time for more attention to be given to the situation \r\nin this part of Africa, for there is every indication and \r\nevery reason to believe that the problem is escalating \r\nand involving more countries. Tanzania is already \r\nfeeling the pressure of the crisis. \r\n Piracy is the second problem in our part of the \r\ncontinent that I would like to mention here today. The \r\nproblem of piracy still lingers on and it is, in fact, \r\nexpanding. We are now witnessing more and more \r\nattacks taking place further to the south of Somalia. \r\nThey used to take place in the Gulf of Aden, but now \r\nthe attacks are moving southward, as far as Tanzania, \r\nMozambique, the Comoros and Madagascar. Since last \r\nyear, when piracy activity moved to our territorial \r\nwaters, 13 ships have been attacked and five of them \r\nwere successfully hijacked. These attacks have caused \r\nan increase in the cost of shipping to our ports. If we \r\ndo not succeed in stopping them, they may disrupt \r\nshipping services and impact negatively on our \r\neconomy. We need the support of the international \r\ncommunity to help us build capacity to fight piracy. We \r\nwelcome the Assembly’s readiness to assist us to \r\nimprove our courts and prisons to try and punish the \r\npirates. But if a similar gesture were extended to us to \r\nbuild capacity to prevent attacks, there would be fewer \r\npirates to bother us. \r\n Controversies continue to prevent progress on the \r\ndraft comprehensive convention on international \r\nterrorism. The more we delay, the more sophisticated \r\ninternational terrorism becomes in its strategies and \r\ntactics. We recently witnessed events in Abuja in which \r\nthe United Nations was attacked. Tanzania condemns \r\nthese cruel acts in the strongest terms possible and \r\nexpresses solidarity with the people of Nigeria and the \r\nUnited Nations. It is clear that the struggle against \r\nterrorism must remain a high priority for the United \r\nNations. \r\n I would be remiss if I concluded my statement \r\nwithout acknowledging and thanking the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for the honour he accorded me and my \r\ncountry, Tanzania, last year when he formed a \r\nCommission on Information and Accountability for \r\nWomen’s and Children’s Health. He appointed me and \r\n A/66/PV.15\r\n \r\n7 11-50865 \r\n \r\nPrime Minister Stephen Harper of Canada to co-chair \r\nthe Commission. It was an honour to serve on the \r\nCommission, and I hope that the recommendations we \r\nmade will help to advance the cause of the noble work \r\nthat we are all doing to save the lives of millions of \r\ninnocent women and children who are dying from \r\ncauses that can be prevented.  \r\n I end as I began, by reaffirming our faith in the \r\nUnited Nations, a true embodiment of humanity. We \r\ndedicate ourselves to respect the values and principles \r\nenshrined in our Charter and we shall continue to \r\nplay — as we have always have done during our first \r\n50 years as an independent State — a full, honest and \r\nconstructive part in the work of the United Nations. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the United \r\nRepublic of Tanzania for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\n Mr. Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete, President of the \r\nUnited Republic of Tanzania, was escorted from \r\nthe General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by His Majesty King Hamad bin Issa Al \r\nKhalifa, King of the Kingdom of Bahrain \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the King of the Kingdom \r\nof Bahrain. \r\n King Hamad bin Issa Al Khalifa, King of the \r\nKingdom of Bahrain, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations His Majesty King Hamad bin Issa \r\nAl Khalifa, King of the Kingdom of Bahrain, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly. \r\n King Hamad bin Issa Al Khalifa (spoke in \r\nArabic): It gives us pleasure, at this international \r\nforum, to greet our brothers and friends, the Heads of \r\nState, Government and delegations represented in this \r\nHall. We hope that our meetings at the sixty-sixth \r\nsession of the General Assembly will be fruitful and \r\nresult in a concrete outcome commensurate with our \r\naspirations for a global environment of stability, \r\nsecurity and lasting peace, and for the good and well-\r\nbeing of humanity at large.  \r\n We are pleased to see yet another diplomat from \r\nthe Gulf Cooperation Council presiding over the \r\nGeneral Assembly. We take this opportunity to offer \r\nour sincere wishes of every success to Ambassador \r\nNassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser in his international mission \r\nand of further progress and advancement at all levels \r\nfor his country, the brotherly State of Qatar. We also \r\nthank his predecessor, Mr. Joseph Deiss, for his able \r\nconduct of and contributions to the work of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-fifth session. \r\n We would also like to express our deep \r\nappreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his \r\nceaseless efforts to strengthen the role of the United \r\nNations in maintaining international peace and security \r\nand for his persistent endeavours to achieve the \r\nprerequisites for stability in our world, namely, \r\ndevelopment and collective international cooperation \r\nfor the benefit of the peoples of the world as a whole. \r\nWe also seize this opportunity to congratulate him on \r\nhis reappointment to a second term of office. \r\n There is no doubt that the world has entered a \r\nnew era of important changes in which the growth of \r\nmodern means of communication has led to rapid and \r\nunprecedented transformations in the world, such as \r\nthose that we are now experiencing in our Arab region. \r\nMore than a decade ago, we in the Kingdom of Bahrain \r\nrecognized the need to proceed towards greater reform, \r\nimprovement and advancement, bearing in mind the \r\nsupreme interest of our people, in order to satisfy their \r\ndemands for freedom and political participation — a \r\nhome-grown participation that is commensurate with \r\nthe heritage and history of each country and its level of \r\ndevelopment. Reform was also aimed at providing \r\ndecent living conditions, security and tranquillity in a \r\nsociety that enjoys peaceful coexistence, equality and \r\nequal opportunities for empowerment to achieve justice \r\nand sustainable development for all. \r\n In all its modernization endeavours and \r\nthroughout its long history, the Kingdom of Bahrain \r\nhas persistently followed the approach of dialogue. \r\nBuilding on the consensus of the people of Bahrain \r\naround the provisions of the National Action Charter of \r\n2001, we initiated a national dialogue process \r\ninvolving all sectors and components of the population. \r\nThe aim was to absorb the requirements of modern \r\nprogress, guarantee the continuation of the reform \r\nprocess, and fulfil the national aspiration to move \r\nforward towards comprehensive modernization and the \r\nenhancement of popular participation in decision-\r\nA/66/PV.15  \r\n \r\n11-50865 8 \r\n \r\nmaking within an all-inclusive national partnership. We \r\nhereby reaffirm our support for the outcome of that \r\ndialogue. \r\n The achievements of the Kingdom of Bahrain at \r\nthe national level are therefore an extension of a long \r\nhistory dating back to the beginning of the last century, \r\nin which we have worked to achieve a society based on \r\njustice, equality, progress and openness. The \r\nauthenticity of our people, culture, free economy, \r\npolitical development and firm commitment to the \r\nuniversal principles of human rights, peaceful \r\ncoexistence and respect for the views of others \r\nconstitute the real wealth of our country, which we \r\nseek to preserve and sustain for future generations. \r\n Today more than ever, the international \r\ncommunity has a propitious opportunity to do justice to \r\nthe brotherly Palestinian people and to help them to \r\nachieve their legitimate aspirations by recognizing an \r\nindependent Palestinian State on their own national \r\nsoil, with East Jerusalem as its capital. That would put \r\nan end to an era of bitter Arab-Israeli conflict, \r\ncontingent on a complete Israeli withdrawal from all \r\noccupied Arab territories to the lines of 4 June 1967 in \r\nPalestine, the occupied Syrian Arab Golan and the \r\noccupied territories in southern Lebanon, in accordance \r\nwith the relevant resolutions of international legitimacy \r\nand the Arab Peace Initiative. \r\n Committed to the security of the Arabian Gulf \r\nregion, we emphasize the need to resolve the issue of \r\nthe three occupied United Arab Emirates islands, either \r\nthrough direct negotiations or by referral to the \r\nInternational Court of Justice. With regard to \r\ndevelopments in the brotherly State of Yemen, the \r\nKingdom of Bahrain supports the Gulf Cooperation \r\nCouncil initiative for maintaining the security, stability \r\nand unity of that country and achieving the aspirations \r\nof its people. In this connection, we further emphasize \r\nthe importance of preserving the unity of Moroccan \r\nterritory and of resolving the issue of the Moroccan \r\nSahara, in accordance with the relevant Security \r\nCouncil resolutions. \r\n Consistent with its commitment to concerted \r\ninternational action and its role and responsibilities in \r\nour region, the Kingdom of Bahrain has never hesitated \r\nto contribute to and participate in the Contact Group on \r\nLibya in order to help realize the aspirations of the \r\nLibyan people and ensure the country’s unity and \r\nterritorial integrity. \r\n Bahrain is also participating in the international \r\npeacekeeping forces in Afghanistan in order to support \r\nthat country’s stability and security in every sphere —\r\npolitical, economic and security — as well as in the \r\nfight against international terrorism and piracy on the \r\nhigh seas. Bahrain also shares in the friendly American \r\npeople’s heartfelt pain and grief over the reprehensible \r\nterrorist attacks of 11 September 2001. Their resilience \r\nand determination, however, have helped to make their \r\ncountry a safer place. \r\n As a peace-loving nation, Bahrain will remain \r\nfaithful to this Organization for its historic role in \r\nsupporting our country’s sovereignty, and for the role \r\nof its judiciary in ending inter-State disputes all over \r\nthe world, all in the interest of global stability and \r\ndevelopment. \r\n We believe that humankind in general and the \r\ninternational community have much to gain at the \r\nglobal level from the contributions of Arab-Islamic \r\ncivilization, as have other civilizations throughout \r\nhistory. Arab Muslims, Christians, Jews and other \r\nfollowers of other religions and beliefs can coexist \r\nonly in a state of civility based on tolerance. We speak \r\nhere in light of the experience of our country, Bahrain, \r\nwhich, with its characteristic openness and civilization \r\ndeeply rooted in history, has from time immemorial \r\nbeen a symbol of coexistence and interaction between \r\nthese human contributions. Hence its position since \r\nearly times as a cultural and spiritual centre in its \r\nnatural and human environment in the Arabian Gulf — \r\na position on which it has built a civil society and \r\nfomented a modern renaissance in the areas of \r\nadministrative organization, economic activity, and an \r\neducational and cultural enlightenment. \r\n While Bahrain appreciates the support of the \r\nUnited Nations and its specialized agencies for its \r\nachievements, as evidenced by the numerous awards it \r\nhas won in various human and social fields, we stress \r\nthe great importance of the global issues discussed in \r\nthe Secretary-General’s annual report on the work of \r\nthe Organization (A/66/1). We are convinced that it is \r\nimperative that all Member States cooperate on issues \r\nsuch as climate change, international health, drought, \r\npoverty alleviation, disarmament, the non-proliferation \r\nof nuclear weapons and the fight against terrorism. \r\nThis is more urgent than ever before, given the scale of \r\nthe challenges and problems facing humankind, so that \r\nwe can create a new world of security, peace, \r\ntranquillity and prosperity. \r\n A/66/PV.15\r\n \r\n9 11-50865 \r\n \r\n In conclusion, we reaffirm our commitment to the \r\nprinciples and purposes of the United Nations and its \r\nconstructive role in consolidating peace, love and \r\nprosperity in the world. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the King of the \r\nKingdom of Bahrain for the statement he has just \r\nmade, and for his kind words addressed to me. \r\n His Majesty King Hamad bin Issa Al Khalifa, \r\nKing of the Kingdom of Bahrain, was escorted \r\nfrom the General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Alassane Ouattara, President of the \r\nRepublic of Côte d’Ivoire \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Côte \r\nd’Ivoire. \r\n Mr. Alassane Ouattara, President of the Republic \r\nof Côte d’Ivoire, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Alassane Ouattara, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Côte d’Ivoire, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Ouattara (spoke in French): In taking \r\nthe floor for the first time before this Assembly, I offer \r\nmy heartfelt thanks to the international community and \r\nall the friendly countries that had faith in our struggle \r\nfor democracy, and whose support never failed us \r\nduring the painful and trying post-electoral crisis in \r\nCôte d’Ivoire. \r\n Please also allow me, Mr. President, to \r\ncongratulate you warmly, as other speakers before me \r\nhave done, on your outstanding election to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth \r\nsession, which attests to the recognition of your \r\nremarkable contribution to expanding the influence of \r\nthe Organization and promoting its ideals. We assure \r\nyou of my delegation’s full support in carrying out \r\nyour mandate. I would also like to convey to your \r\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss, my full \r\nappreciation and that of my delegation for his \r\nremarkable work and encouraging results during his \r\npresidency. \r\n I would further like to make a special mention \r\nhere of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his \r\ndetermined commitment and tireless efforts on behalf \r\nof world peace, earning him deserved reappointment to \r\na second term at the head of the United Nations. In \r\nreiterating my warm congratulations upon your \r\nre-election, I would also like to reaffirm, on behalf of \r\nthe Ivorian people and Government, as well as \r\npersonally, our profound gratitude and thanks for the \r\ncrucial role the United Nations and you personally \r\nplayed in resolving the Ivorian crisis. \r\n I note with satisfaction that, for the first time in \r\nhistory, a woman — Ms. Dilma Rousseff, \r\ndemocratically elected in 2010 to lead Brazil — \r\nopened our general debate. I celebrate this fact. \r\n The theme chosen for this session — “The role of \r\nmediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful \r\nmeans” — demonstrates our will to place our \r\nOrganization at the heart of international crisis \r\nresolution. It also focuses the attention of our \r\nAssembly on one of the main missions entrusted to the \r\nUnited Nations — the use and promotion of \r\nnegotiations in the resolutions of conflicts, whose \r\nproliferation and gravity have posed an unrelenting \r\nthreat to the balance and progress of humankind in \r\nrecent years. The implementation of such an approach \r\nin international relations calls for resolute involvement \r\nand solidarity on the part of Member States in seeking \r\nnegotiated solutions to current and potential disputes at \r\nthe international, regional and subregional levels. In \r\nthis regard, I welcome the independence of South \r\nSudan and its admission as the 193rd State Member of \r\nthe United Nations. \r\n The recent history of peoples underscores the \r\nvirtues of dialogue and negotiation for resolving even \r\nthe most complex conflicts, as proven by the \r\ndismantling of apartheid and the progress, albeit \r\nmodest, in the settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian \r\ncrisis. \r\n This is a theme close to our hearts, as the father \r\nof the Ivorian nation, President Félix Houphouët-\r\nBoigny, left his mark on the history of Côte d’Ivoire \r\nand the entire African continent as a result of his \r\npragmatic approach to resolving conflicts through \r\ndialogue. The UNESCO Félix Houphouët-Boigny \r\nPeace Prize attests to and represents the international \r\ncommunity’s recognition of his efforts to promote \r\npeace. I am therefore honoured and proud to make a \r\nA/66/PV.15  \r\n \r\n11-50865 10 \r\n \r\ncommitment to follow in the footsteps of the approach \r\npromoted by that apostle disciple of dialogue and \r\npeace. In this context, my country is fully ready, as in \r\nthe past, to tirelessly promote the option of negotiation \r\nto resolve and prevent conflicts and safeguard peace — \r\na prerequisite for all social and economic development \r\nin the world. \r\n The much sought prize of peace, even through the \r\nappropriate routes of consultation and dialogue, cannot \r\nbe achieved without more balanced and fairer \r\neconomic development in our world. In this regard, the \r\neconomic and financial crisis that has shaken the world \r\nfor three years and whose consequences are still being \r\nfelt, especially in developing countries, demands \r\naction, even as growth becomes more apparent in some \r\nregions. This trend has been growing since 2010, due \r\nin part to the economic performance of emerging and \r\ndeveloping countries, must absolutely be consolidated \r\nif we want to sustainably prevent the relapse of such a \r\ncrisis.  \r\n Nevertheless, strong economic growth is not \r\nenough to guarantee security and stability in our world. \r\nIt must necessarily be accompanied by transparent and \r\nequitable access to employment, especially for young \r\npeople, security and justice if we truly want to break \r\nthe cycles of political and criminal violence. We must \r\ntherefore urgently adopt a new model for development \r\nbased on environmental constraints that ensures that \r\nthe needs of the population for employment, security \r\nand justice are met. Such a challenge can be overcome \r\nonly through solidarity. \r\n The food, energy and environmental crises and \r\nnatural disasters, which have become ever more \r\nfrequent and serious due to the effects of climate \r\nchange, demonstrate that the balance of human life, \r\ndespite the immense progress achieved in a great \r\nnumber of areas, remains fragile. They also underscore \r\nhow closely the fates of the peoples of the world are \r\nlinked, as no geographic, racial or religious division \r\ncan withstand either the occurrence or the negative \r\neffects of these phenomena. Aware of our \r\nresponsibilities to our people and, above all, to \r\nhumankind as a whole, we must therefore join forces \r\nthrough the multilateral framework to seek innovative \r\nand effective solutions to these crises and other \r\ncatastrophes, which pose a real threat to international \r\npeace and security. \r\n In this regard, I would like to reiterate the \r\ncompassion of the people and Government of Côte \r\nd’Ivoire to the victims of natural disasters, especially \r\nin Japan, the Caribbean and the United States. I extend \r\nspecial and brotherly sympathy to the peoples of the \r\nHorn of Africa, who are suffering the grave effects of \r\nfamine as a result of an extended drought. \r\n Faced with these humanitarian tragedies, the \r\npolitical commitment of all States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations is indispensable. My delegation \r\ntherefore welcomes the initiatives undertaken by the \r\ninternational community — especially the French \r\npresidency of the Group of 20, and the specialized \r\ninstitutions of the United Nations and the African \r\nUnion — to meet the immediate needs of the affected \r\npopulations. \r\n International peace and security remain a cause of \r\nmajor concern for our Organization, given the \r\nproliferation of armed conflicts, nuclear threats, \r\nterrorist activity, transnational crime, human \r\ntrafficking, drug trafficking and pandemics. All of \r\nthese hamper the world’s harmonious development, \r\nespecially in Africa, which, riven by many areas of \r\ntension, struggles to ensure its economic and social \r\ndevelopment despite its enormous potential. \r\n The United Nations has a role to play in \r\nstrengthening the international solidarity that is \r\nindispensable as we seek effective and appropriate \r\nsolutions to these crises. This requires the mobilization \r\nof adequate resources to fund research and \r\ndevelopment in the areas of food crop production, \r\nrenewable energy and sustainable development. To that \r\nend, a substantial reduction in military spending is \r\nrequired, allowing such resources to be found. Such a \r\nsacrifice would be very useful towards the survival of \r\nmankind. \r\n Aware of these crises, since taking office I have \r\nsought to enhance the security of my country. \r\nDiscussions are nearing completion on tripartite \r\nagreements with our neighbours, particularly \r\nLiberia — with which one has already been signed — \r\nGhana and Guinea, with the support of the High \r\nCommissioner for Refugees and United Nations \r\npeacekeepers present in the region. These agreements \r\nseek to ensure the voluntary and rapid return of Ivorian \r\nrefugees from those brotherly countries and to protect \r\nour eastern and western borders from the movement of \r\n A/66/PV.15\r\n \r\n11 11-50865 \r\n \r\narmed groups, drug trafficking and traffic in precious \r\nmetals. \r\n Negotiations are also under way with our Western \r\npartners to ensure that Côte d’Ivoire becomes a \r\nbulwark of regional defence and security in the fight \r\nagainst terrorism. The recent ratification of the \r\nOptional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of \r\nthe Child on the involvement of children in armed \r\nconflict reinforces our firm resolve to use all legal \r\nmeans to combat violence and to protect the security of \r\nour most vulnerable people, particularly women and \r\nchildren. \r\n The outcome of the social and political conflict \r\nthat began in Côte d’Ivoire in 2002 marks the return of \r\ndemocracy to our country, based on the promise of the \r\nrule of law and a society that shares the common ideals \r\nof peace and respect for human rights. For that reason, \r\ncoexistence is the cornerstone of my Government’s \r\nprogramme. As soon as I took office, I established \r\nnational reconciliation as one of our priorities by \r\ncreating a Dialogue, Truth and Reconciliation \r\nCommission designed to create conditions conducive \r\nto dialogue among all levels of society in order to heal \r\nthe wounds of the crisis, re-knit the social fabric, \r\nrestore national cohesion and promote peace and \r\njustice. \r\n Furthermore, the Government, which is \r\nresponsible for making those principles the basis for its \r\nactivities, is working tirelessly to ensure social and \r\neconomic recovery towards the reconstruction Côte \r\nd’Ivoire. Thus, the President’s emergency programme \r\nlaunched in March, while I was at the Golf Hotel, has \r\nalready had favourable results for the people of Côte \r\nd’Ivoire, particularly those of Abidjan, who suffered \r\npillage and property destruction. The programme is \r\nfocused in particular on improving basic social \r\nservices, especially the provision of drinking water, \r\nhealth care, education, electricity and public sanitation, \r\nwhich are major challenges that must be met as we \r\nattempt to achieve our Millennium Development \r\nGoals. \r\n The organization of parliamentary elections \r\nbefore the end of this year will allow us to enhance \r\ndemocracy and social justice in Côte d’Ivoire, with the \r\nsupport and assistance of the United Nations through \r\nSecurity Council resolution 2000 (2011) of 27 July \r\n2011, which demonstrates again the Organization’s \r\ndetermination to support Côte d’Ivoire until the end of \r\nthe crisis as provided by the Ouagadougou Political \r\nAgreement. \r\n The socio-political crisis in Côte d’Ivoire over \r\nthe past 10 years has undermined the economic and \r\nsocial development of my country. It is my ambition, \r\nas we approach 2020, to make Côte d’Ivoire an \r\nemerging nation, reconciled with itself and with other \r\nnations and united by republican values; a modern \r\nState that respects the independence of the judiciary \r\nand will combat impunity and ensure the promotion of \r\nmerit and competence. \r\n In closing on this note of hope for my country, I \r\ncall for the determined and ongoing involvement of all \r\nStates Members of the United Nations in the pursuit, \r\nthrough dialogue and cooperation, of collective, \r\neffective and lasting solutions that will create a better \r\nworld based on more harmonious and secure forms of \r\ndevelopment. \r\n Côte d’Ivoire, which in the past was often called \r\non to help in the quest for peaceful solutions to \r\nconflicts, intends to take up this vocation once again. \r\nThis is a natural mission for us in many respects, \r\nbecause Côte d’Ivoire, as Félix Houphouët-Boigny \r\nsaid, is the friend of all and the enemy of none.  \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Côte d’Ivoire for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Alassane Ouattara, President of the Republic \r\nof Côte d’Ivoire, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Sebastián Piñera Echeñique, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Chile \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Chile.  \r\n Mr. Sebastián Piñera Echeñique, President of the \r\nRepublic of Chile, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.  \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Sebastián Piñera \r\nEcheñique, President of the Republic of Chile, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Piñera Echeñique (spoke in Spanish): \r\nI wish at the outset to congratulate Mr. Ban Ki-Moon \r\non his recent reappointment as Secretary-General, and \r\nA/66/PV.15  \r\n \r\n11-50865 12 \r\n \r\nyou, Mr. President, on your election to preside over the \r\nsixty-sixth session of the General Assembly.  \r\n In this meeting of the United Nations, a \r\nmultiplicity of countries and ethnicities, cultures and \r\nlanguages, religions and creeds converges. All are \r\nincreasingly connected in this globalized world, \r\nbecause over and above our legitimate differences, we \r\nall live on the same planet, all breathe the same air and \r\nare all warmed by the same sun. As inhabitants of \r\nplanet Earth, we share the same future. We share \r\nsimilar challenges and opportunities. All of us have the \r\nsame desire for peace, freedom, justice and prosperity \r\nfor our peoples and nations. \r\n I come before the Assembly to express, with \r\nhumble conviction, what my country has to say to the \r\ninternational community. But I have also come to \r\nlisten, carefully and respectfully, to what other \r\ncountries have to say to our country. Chile is, and will \r\nalways be, proud to defend and promote dialogue as \r\nthe best mechanism for dealing with and settling \r\ndisputes. Chile profoundly believes that all nations, \r\ncultures, traditions and creeds have something to teach \r\nus. But we also believe that we all have something to \r\nlearn from others. \r\n There is no doubt that we are facing a new \r\nworld — very different from the one we, or our \r\nparents, have known and which emerged forcefully \r\nduring the past decades: a new world born of the \r\nrevolutions of knowledge, technology and information \r\nthat has created, and will continue to create, enormous \r\nopportunities for material and spiritual progress for \r\nbillions of people throughout the world — \r\nopportunities the world has never known.  \r\n It is also certain that this new world presents us \r\nwith new risks, challenges, threats and opportunities \r\nthat exceed any Government’s individual potential and \r\ncan only be addressed successfully through joint \r\naction. For example, financial crises, in addition to \r\nbecoming more frequent each day, have increasing \r\nregional and global implications that cannot be \r\nignored. The evils of modern society, such as terrorism, \r\ndrug trafficking and organized crime, have for a long \r\ntime ceased to heed borders, territories or jurisdictions. \r\nAny attempt to deal effectively with global warming, \r\nenvironmental protection, natural disasters, health \r\nemergencies, hunger and extreme poverty will most \r\ncertainly require greater concerted and effective action \r\nfrom the community of nations and international \r\nbodies if we truly want to begin to change the course of \r\nhistory.  \r\n Consequently, today it is urgent that we \r\nreposition ourselves and reshape each international \r\norganization, many of which emerged in a very \r\ndifferent world, during the post-war period. Today, as \r\nwe all know, they lack the ability to provide the \r\nnecessary effective responses to the realities, \r\nchallenges and opportunities of the present, as well as \r\nthose of the future that are beginning to emerge. There \r\nis no doubt that we have achieved significant progress, \r\nbut we understand that it has been too slow and \r\ninsufficient. We cannot pretend to lead this new world \r\nwith old institutions. One day our children will ask us \r\nhow to face these challenges. In the end, these are our \r\nchallenges and we must deal with them now. If we do \r\nnot, then who will? If not now, then when? \r\n While it is true that this revolution of knowledge, \r\ntechnology and information is not the first revolution \r\nthe world has faced, all of us know that it is the most \r\nfar-reaching in magnitude and breadth, both in terms \r\nchallenges and the opportunities it has provided. But \r\nlike the revolutions of the past — of metals, agriculture \r\nor the industrial revolution — this twenty-first century \r\nrevolution will be very generous vis-à-vis the countries \r\nwith the desire to embrace it enthusiastically. But the \r\nrevolution will continue to be indifferent, and even \r\ncruel, to those countries that decide simply to ignore it \r\nor let it pass by. It will therefore depend on us whether \r\nit will become a factor for freedom, unity and progress \r\nand a bridge to span the gap between developed \r\ncountries and emerging nations or, on the contrary, a \r\nnew factor of division and a new wall further \r\nseparating those countries in the world of opportunity \r\nfrom those in the world of frustrations. \r\n Certainly, the primary responsibility for rising up \r\nto greet this revolution that is already knocking at our \r\ndoors lies with each country. But it is also a \r\nresponsibility for the international community. In the \r\ncase of the emerging countries, which include all those \r\nin Latin America, including my country, Chile, this \r\nsignifies, in addition to a huge responsibility, a unique \r\nopportunity to re-identify with our past. Most \r\nimportant, it is an opportunity to meet up with our \r\nfuture. It is clear that Latin America — now \r\ncelebrating 200 years of independence — has \r\neverything it needs to overcome poverty and \r\nunderdevelopment. We have a large and fertile \r\nterritory, abundant natural resources, two closely \r\n A/66/PV.15\r\n \r\n13 11-50865 \r\n \r\nrelated languages and, most important, peoples who \r\nhave demonstrated, with solidarity and vigour, their \r\nability to overcome any obstacle placed in our way by \r\nnature or by Providence. We have not had wars such as \r\nthose experienced by Europe in the past century, or \r\nethnic or religious conflicts such as those affecting \r\nother regions of the world.  \r\n Nevertheless, because we did not know how to \r\njoin the industrial revolution in time, our continent \r\nremains underdeveloped, with more than one third of \r\nits population living in conditions of poverty. However, \r\nLatin America has learned the lesson and is today \r\nbecoming integrated with enormous conviction into \r\nthis new revolution of modern society, science, \r\ntechnology, knowledge and information. This \r\nintegration will be successful only if we are able to \r\npromote and expand what has been, and continues to \r\nbe, the inexhaustible source of progress for \r\nhumankind — freedom. \r\n Freedom is an integral concept that cannot be \r\ndivided or compartmentalized. Freedom must be \r\nexpressed in all spheres of human life. In the political \r\nsphere, it requires us to revitalize and deepen \r\ndemocracy and the defence of human rights to the \r\nfarthest corner of the planet and at any moment in time. \r\nIn the economic sphere, this means fostering creativity, \r\nentrepreneurship and innovation among human beings, \r\nwho are the only truly inexhaustible and renewable \r\nresource we possess. We must demolish all of the \r\nobstacles that are preventing many emerging nations \r\nfrom fully integrating themselves into the newly \r\nemerging world. In the social sphere, freedom means \r\npromoting peace and helping States to become ever \r\nmore efficient and effective in the fight against poverty \r\nand in the creation of real societies that provide equal \r\nopportunities for all. \r\n Chile has undoubtedly made, and will continue to \r\nmake, important contributions to each of those areas. \r\nAs well as strongly supporting the cause of democracy \r\nand defending human rights in all countries of the \r\ncontinent and of the world, where necessary, Chile has, \r\nat the regional level, been a tireless and steadfast \r\nadvocate of improving the Inter-American Democratic \r\nCharter and of finalizing a protocol on the preventive \r\nprotection of democracy within the Union of South \r\nAmerican Nations. \r\n In addition, we continue to actively participate in \r\nthe negotiations on the reform of the Security Council \r\nto increase its permanent and non-permanent members \r\nin order to make it more representative of the realities \r\nof the new world order. We have also supported the \r\nreform of the Human Rights Council, to which Chile \r\nwas recently re-elected. \r\n With regard to economic issues, Chile is a \r\ncountry that has integrated into the world and has \r\nconcluded free trade agreements with more than 58 \r\ncountries on all continents, representing more than \r\n80 per cent of the world’s population. However, our \r\ncommitment to free trade does not stop there. We have \r\nbeen strong supporters of the Doha Round of the World \r\nTrade Organization so as to make progress, once and \r\nfor all after decades of stagnation, towards the \r\nliberalization of world trade, because protectionism is a \r\npoor response and is even worse when we face the \r\nthreatening crisis conditions that we are experiencing \r\ntoday.  \r\n Moreover, with regard to the promotion of world \r\npeace, Chile has recognized the Palestinian State, a \r\ncountry that we hope to welcome to the Organization \r\nvery soon. We have resolutely supported all \r\ninternational efforts to achieve a just, legitimate and \r\nlasting settlement in the Middle East. Chile is firmly \r\nconvinced that the Palestinian people have the right to \r\na free, sovereign and democratic State and that the \r\nState of Israel has the right to have recognized, secure \r\nand respected borders. Only thus will Palestinians and \r\nIsraelis be able to coexist and move forward in peace \r\nand harmony.  \r\n With regard to social development and the fight \r\nagainst poverty, hunger and pandemics, we are \r\nstrengthening South-South cooperation. Such \r\ncooperation is certainly triangular, but it neither \r\nreplaces nor substitutes the need for North-South \r\ncooperation. We have set up and are implementing a \r\nChilean fund to combat hunger and poverty in Africa. \r\nWe have also made significant contributions to the \r\nUnited Nations International Drug Purchase Facility in \r\norder to combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, \r\nwhich still wreak havoc in many parts of the world. \r\nBut we wish to go even further, and we are \r\nimplementing mechanisms that will enable us to \r\nunilaterally reduce duties in order to promote our \r\nimports from relatively less developed African \r\ncountries. \r\n We were also very proud to strongly support \r\nUN-Women, an entity headed by our compatriot \r\nA/66/PV.15  \r\n \r\n11-50865 14 \r\n \r\nMichelle Bachelet, whose principal goal is as strong \r\nand as far-reaching as to ultimately ensure that, as \r\nwomen and men, we have the same rights and the same \r\nopportunities in this world, which belongs to us all. \r\n However, in this new century and this new \r\nknowledge and information society, as well as relying \r\non robust democracies, with open, competitive and \r\nintegrated economies, and effective States to combat \r\npoverty and for greater equality of opportunity, we \r\nmust recognize that those are merely old pillars that are \r\nnecessary but completely inadequate today. As \r\nemerging countries, we must commit to building new \r\ndevelopment pillars. Those are investment in science \r\nand technology; the promotion of innovation and \r\nentrepreneurship; the building of more flexible \r\nsocieties that can adapt to a world in which change is \r\nthe only constant; and, above all, making a huge effort \r\nto improve our human capital, the education of our \r\nyoung people and the training of our workers, as that is \r\nsurely the major source of wealth and primary resource \r\nfor leaving behind underdevelopment.  \r\n There is no doubt that we must win the race for \r\ndevelopment and the battle for the future in the \r\nclassroom by giving each and every one of our children \r\nquality education. We have said it many times: \r\neducation is the true mother of all battles. \r\nUnfortunately, it is also the Achilles heel of many \r\nemerging economies. In my country in recent weeks, \r\nthousands of young people have taken to the streets to \r\ndemonstrate for a noble, great and fine cause, namely, \r\ngiving all children and young people quality education \r\nthat enables them all to be actors in, and not mere \r\nspectators of, their own destiny and participation in \r\nthis knowledge and information society. \r\n Our Government has shared, and consistently \r\nshares, that goal. It is ready for the greatest reforms \r\nand has committed the largest economic, human, \r\nprofessional and technical resources in order to bring \r\nabout fundamental change in our education system that \r\nseeks to substantially improve the quality of education \r\nand to increase coverage, in particular in the education \r\nof children from minorities and the most vulnerable so \r\nthat they participate in education soon, not when the \r\nyears have made it irreversible. We must also \r\nsubstantially increase funding and access at all levels \r\nof education in order to ensure something as simple as \r\nquality education for all, free education for all those \r\nwho need it and adequate funding for all others in \r\norder to realize the dream that no bright child or young \r\nperson remains excluded from higher education owing \r\nto the socio-economic situation of their family or to \r\nscarce resources.  \r\n We want to appeal to all Latin American \r\ncountries, in the context of the Community of Latin \r\nAmerican and Caribbean States, to establish a true \r\nstrategic partnership that will engage the heart and soul \r\nof our Governments in that extensive reform of our \r\neducational systems, which will be our greatest \r\npossible contribution to the overall development of \r\npeople to enable them to utilize their talents to the full, \r\nand to the growth of our economies, while enhancing \r\npeace and strengthening our democracies.  \r\n That is why I would also like to mention what the \r\nPresident of Bolivia said yesterday when he referred to \r\nhis country’s claim to obtain sovereign access to the \r\nPacific Ocean through Chilean territory (see \r\nA/66/PV.13). In that regard, I wish to reiterate that \r\nthere are no territorial issues pending between Chile \r\nand Bolivia. They were settled once and for all by the \r\nTreaty of Peace and Friendship of 1904, that is to say, \r\nconcluded more than 100 years ago now. That Treaty \r\nwas lawfully negotiated more than 20 years after the \r\nend of the conflict between the two countries. \r\nMoreover, the parties agreed to it; their Parliaments \r\nratified it; and, as Bolivia itself acknowledged, the \r\nTreaty was the outcome of free and consensus-based \r\nnegotiation. Therefore, in accordance with \r\ninternational law, both Chile and Bolivia are obliged to \r\nrespect and implement it in good faith.  \r\n Chile has fully implemented in a timely way each \r\nand every clause of that 1904 Treaty of Peace and \r\nFriendship. Furthermore, the facilities that Chile \r\ngranted exceeded the Treaty provisions, including \r\ngoing far beyond those that the United Nations itself \r\nestablished in the Convention on Transit Trade of \r\nLand-Locked States. Our country has been, and always \r\nwill be, willing to engage in dialogue with Bolivia on \r\nthe basis of full respect for the treaties and \r\ninternational law. We are sure that, through such \r\ndialogue, we will have the best possibility of agreeing \r\nwith Bolivia concrete, feasible and useful solutions for \r\nboth countries.  \r\n All of us here have not only the right but the duty \r\nto speak and act in defence of the interests of our \r\nrespective countries and peoples. However, we cannot \r\nfail to note that, for that to be fruitful, requires that we \r\nwork on the many things that unite us rather than on \r\n A/66/PV.15\r\n \r\n15 11-50865 \r\n \r\nwhat legitimately divides us. When all is said and \r\ndone, whether we like it or not, responding to the risks \r\nand the storm clouds that we see looming on the \r\nhorizon — but also the challenges and the \r\nopportunities that we are getting ready to confront, and \r\nthe responses and the solutions that together we shall \r\nhave to implement, will only be fruitful and efficient if \r\nwe do so with unity and goodwill. Some might believe \r\nthat, acting alone, they will be able to move forward \r\nfaster, but history will never cease to remind us that it \r\nis only when we act with unity and goodwill that we \r\nwill be able to build on solid bedrock and not sand; \r\nonly that will allow each country — and the world as a \r\nwhole — to go far in fulfilling our tasks, achieving our \r\ngoals and overcoming our challenges. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Chile for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Sebastián Piñera Echenique, President of the \r\nRepublic of Chile, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, President \r\nof the Islamic Republic of Iran \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran. \r\n Mr. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, President of the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations His Excellency by Mr. Mahmoud \r\nAhmadinejad, President of the Islamic Republic of \r\nIran, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Ahmadinejad (spoke in Persian; \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): I am grateful \r\nto the Almighty Allah, who has granted me once more \r\nan opportunity to appear before the General Assembly. \r\nI have the pleasure to express my sincere thanks to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Joseph Deiss, President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-fifth session, for his tremendous \r\nefforts during his tenure. I would also like to \r\ncongratulate His Excellency Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz \r\nAl-Nasser on his election as the President of the \r\nAssembly at its sixty-sixth session. \r\n Let me seize this opportunity to pay tribute to all \r\nthose who lost their lives in the past year as a result of \r\nnatural disasters, in particular the victims of the tragic \r\nfamine in Somalia and the devastating flood in \r\nPakistan. I urge everyone to intensify their assistance \r\nto the affected populations in those countries.  \r\n Over the past years, I have spoken about different \r\nglobal issues and the need to introduce fundamental \r\nchanges in the current international order. Today, \r\nconsidering international developments, I will try to \r\nanalyze the present situation from a different angle. \r\n As everyone knows, the superiority of human \r\nbeings and their dominance over other creatures lie in \r\nthe very nature and the truth of humankind, which is a \r\ndivine gift and a manifestation of the divine spirit \r\nembodying faith in God, the everlasting Creator and \r\nPlanner of the entire universe who shows compassion, \r\ngenerosity, justice and integrity in both words and \r\ndeeds; the quest for dignity to reach the pinnacles of \r\nperfection, the aspirations to elevate one’s material and \r\nspiritual status and the longing to realize liberty; \r\ndefying oppression, corruption and discrimination and \r\ntrying to support the oppressed; seeking happiness and \r\nlasting prosperity and security for all.  \r\n Those are some of the manifestations of common \r\ndivine and human attributes that can clearly be seen in \r\nthe historical aspirations of human beings to create a \r\nheritage of art and literature, both in prose and poetry, \r\nand in the socio-cultural and political movements of \r\nhuman beings throughout the course of history. All \r\ndivine prophets and social reformers have invited \r\nhuman beings to tread on this righteous path. God gave \r\ndignity to humankind in order to elevate its status so \r\nthat it can assume the role of His successor on Earth. \r\n It is vividly clear that, despite all historical \r\nachievements, including the creation of the United \r\nNations, which was the product of untiring struggles \r\nand the efforts of free-minded and justice-seeking \r\nindividuals and of international cooperation, human \r\nsocieties remain far from fulfilling their noble desires \r\nand aspirations. Most nations of the world are unhappy \r\nwith the current international circumstances. Despite \r\nthe general longing and aspiration for peace, progress \r\nand fraternity, wars, mass murder, widespread poverty \r\nand socio-economic and political crises continue to \r\ninfringe upon the rights and sovereignty of nations, \r\nleaving behind irreparable damage to all nations \r\nworldwide.  \r\nA/66/PV.15  \r\n \r\n11-50865 16 \r\n \r\n Approximately, 3 billion of the world’s people \r\nlive on less than $2.50 a day, and over 200 million \r\npeople live without even having one proper meal per \r\nday. Forty per cent of the world’s poorest populations \r\nonly share 5 per cent of global income, while 20 per \r\ncent of the richest people share 75 per cent of \r\neconomic earnings worldwide. More than 20,000 \r\ninnocent and destitute children around the world die \r\nevery day because of poverty. Eighty per cent of \r\nfinancial resources in the United States of America are \r\ncontrolled by 10 per cent of its people, while only \r\n20 per cent of those resources belong to 90 per cent of \r\nthe population. \r\n What are the causes and reasons behind these \r\ninequalities? How can one remedy such injustice? \r\nThose who dominate and run the centres of global \r\neconomic power put the blame on peoples’ religious \r\naspirations and the pursuit of the path of divine \r\nprophets, or on the weakness of nations and the poor \r\nperformance of a number of groups or individuals. \r\nThey claim that only their views, approaches and \r\nprescriptions can save humankind and the world \r\neconomy. I ask everyone here whether they think that \r\nthe root cause of the problems can be solved in the \r\nprevailing international order of the way the world is \r\ngoverned. \r\n I want to draw attention to the following \r\nquestions. Who abducted by force tens of millions of \r\npeople from their homes in Africa and other regions of \r\nthe world during the dark period of slavery, making \r\nAfricans the victims of the materialistic greed of the \r\nUnited States and Europe? Who imposed colonialism \r\non the world for over four centuries? Who occupied \r\nlands and massively plundered other nations’ \r\nresources, destroyed talents and obliterated native \r\nlanguages, cultures and national identities? Who \r\ntriggered the First and Second World Wars, which left \r\n70 million dead and hundreds of millions injured or \r\nhomeless? Who created the wars in the Korean \r\npeninsula and Viet Nam?  \r\n Who imposed, through deceit and hypocrisy, the \r\nZionist agenda and almost 60 years of war, \r\nhomelessness, terror and mass murder on the \r\nPalestinian people and the countries of the region? \r\nWho imposed and supported for decades military \r\ndictatorships and totalitarian regimes on Asian, African \r\nand Latin American nations, and established friendly \r\nrelations with all of them? Who used atomic bombs \r\nagainst defenceless people and then stockpiled \r\nthousands of warheads in their arsenals? Whose \r\neconomies rely on waging wars and selling arms?  \r\n Who provoked and encouraged Saddam Hussein \r\nto invade and impose an eight-year war on Iran, and \r\nwho assisted and equipped him to deploy chemical \r\nweapons against our cities and our people? Who used \r\nthe mysterious 11 September incident as a pretext to \r\nattack Afghanistan and Iraq, killing, injuring and \r\ndisplacing millions in those two countries, with the \r\nultimate goal of bringing the Middle East and its oil \r\nresources under its domination?  \r\n Who undermined the Bretton Woods system and \r\nprinted trillions of dollars without the backing of gold \r\nreserves or an equivalent currency, a move that \r\ntriggered inflation worldwide and was intended to prey \r\non the economic gains of other nations? What \r\ncountry’s annual military spending exceeds $1 trillion \r\nannually — more than the military budgets of all \r\ncountries of the world combined? Which Governments \r\nare the ones most indebted in the world, and which \r\nGovernment threatens all nations and countries on any \r\npretext?  \r\n Who dominates the policymaking establishments \r\nof the world economy? Who are the ones who are \r\nresponsible for the world economic recession and are \r\nimposing its consequences in the United States and \r\nEurope on Asian, African, Latin American and all other \r\nnations? Which Governments are ever ready to drop \r\nthousands of bombs on other countries but ponder and \r\nhesitate to send a bit of food aid to famine-stricken \r\npeople in Somalia or elsewhere? Who are the ones \r\ndominating the Security Council, which is ostensibly \r\nresponsible for safeguarding international security?  \r\n There exist dozens of other similar questions, and \r\nof course the answers are clear. The majority of nations \r\nand Governments of the world have had no role in the \r\ncreation of the current global crisis, and in fact are \r\nthemselves the victims of such policies. It is as clear as \r\ndaylight that the same slave-masters and colonial \r\nPowers that once triggered the two World Wars have \r\ncaused widespread misery and disorder, with far-\r\nreaching effects across the globe since then. They \r\ncontinue to control the international political centres \r\nand the Security Council.  \r\n Do those arrogant Powers really have the \r\ncompetence and ability to run or govern the world? Is \r\nit acceptable that they call themselves the sole \r\ndefenders of freedom, democracy and human rights, \r\n A/66/PV.15\r\n \r\n17 11-50865 \r\n \r\nwhile they attack and occupy other countries \r\nmilitarily? Can the flower of democracy blossom from \r\nNATO’s missiles, bombs and guns?  \r\n If some European countries still use the \r\nHolocaust — after six decades — as an excuse to pay \r\nransom to the Zionists, should it not be an obligation of \r\nthe slave masters and colonial Powers to pay \r\nreparations to the affected nations? If the damage and \r\nlosses of the period of slavery and colonialism were \r\nindeed compensated for, what would happen to the \r\nmanipulators and behind-the-scenes political powers in \r\nthe United States and Europe? Would the gaps between \r\nthe North and the South remain? If only half of the \r\nmilitary expenditures of the United States and its allies \r\nin NATO were cut to help solve the economic problems \r\nin their own countries, would they be experiencing any \r\nsymptoms of the economic crisis? What would happen \r\nif the same amount were allocated to poor nations?  \r\n What is the justification for the presence of \r\nhundreds of United States military and intelligence \r\nbases in various parts of the world, including 268 bases \r\nin Germany, 124 in Japan, 87 in the Republic of Korea, \r\n83 in Italy, 45 in the United Kingdom, 21 in Portugal \r\nand hundreds of other bases in other parts of the \r\nworld? Is that anything other than military occupation? \r\nDo not the bombs deployed in the United States bases \r\nundermine the security of other nations? \r\n The main question is the root causes of such \r\nattitudes. The prime reason should be sought in the \r\nbeliefs and tendencies of the establishment, which is \r\nmade up of people in conflict with their inner human \r\ninstincts and disposition, who also have no faith in God \r\nand in the path of the divine prophets to replace their \r\nlust for power and materialistic ends with heavenly \r\nvalues. To them, only power and wealth prevail. Every \r\nattempt must be made to bring into focus those sinister \r\ngoals.  \r\n Oppressed nations have no hope to safeguard or \r\nprotect their legitimate rights against those Powers. \r\nThose Powers seek their progress, prosperity and \r\ndignity through the poverty, humiliation and \r\nannihilation of others. They consider themselves \r\nsuperior to others, enjoying special privileges or \r\nconcessions. They have no respect for others and \r\ncasually violate the rights of all nations and \r\nGovernments. They proclaim themselves the \r\nindisputable custodians of all Governments and nations \r\nthrough intimidation, recourse to threats and force, and \r\nthe abuse of international mechanisms.  \r\n They insist on imposing their lifestyle and beliefs \r\non others. They officially support racism. They weaken \r\ncountries through military intervention and destroy \r\ntheir infrastructure in order to plunder their resources \r\nby making them all the more dependent. They sow the \r\nseeds of hate and hostility among nations and people of \r\ndifferent pursuits in order to prevent them from \r\nfulfilling their goals of development and progress. \r\n All cultural identities, lives and values, as well as \r\nthe wealth of nations and human values, including of \r\nwomen, children and youth, are sacrificed to their \r\nhegemonistic tendencies and their inclination to \r\nenslave and capture other nations. \r\n Hypocrisy and deceit are allowed in order to \r\nsecure their interests and imperialistic intentions. Drug \r\ntrafficking and the killing of innocent human beings \r\nare also allowed in pursuit of such diabolical goals. \r\nDespite NATO’s presence in occupied Afghanistan, \r\nthere has been a dramatic increase in the production of \r\nillicit drugs in that country. \r\n They tolerate no question or criticism and, \r\ninstead of presenting a reason for their violations, they \r\nalways put themselves in the position of a claimant. \r\n By using their imperialistic media network, \r\nwhich is under the influence of colonialism, they \r\nthreaten anyone who questions the Holocaust and the \r\nevent of 11 September with sanctions and military \r\naction. \r\n Last year, when the need to form a fact-finding \r\nteam to undertake a thorough investigation concerning \r\nthe hidden elements involved in the 11 September \r\nincident was brought up — an idea also endorsed by all \r\nindependent Governments and nations, as well as by \r\nthe majority of people in the United States — my \r\ncountry and I were pressured and threatened by the \r\nGovernment of the United States. Instead of assigning \r\na fact-finding team, they killed the main perpetrator \r\nand threw his body into the sea. \r\n Would it not have been reasonable to bring to \r\njustice and openly try the main perpetrator of the \r\nincident in order to identify the elements and reasons \r\nbehind the safe space provided for the invading aircraft \r\nto attack the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center? \r\nWhy should it not have been allowed to bring him to \r\ntrial so as to help efforts to recognize those who \r\nA/66/PV.15  \r\n \r\n11-50865 18 \r\n \r\nlaunched terrorist groups and brought wars and other \r\nmiseries into the region? Is there any classified \r\ninformation that must be kept secret? \r\n They view Zionism as a sacred notion or \r\nideology. Any question concerning its foundation and \r\nhistory is condemned by them as an unforgivable sin. \r\nHowever, they endorse and allow sacrileges and insults \r\nagainst the beliefs of other divine religions. \r\n Real freedom, justice, dignity and well-being and \r\nlasting security are the rights of all nations. Those \r\nvalues can be achieved neither by reliance on the \r\ncurrent inefficient system of world governance nor \r\nthrough the intervention of the world’s arrogant Powers \r\nor the gun barrels of NATO forces. Those values can be \r\nrealized only through independence, the recognition of \r\nothers’ rights, harmony and cooperation. \r\n Is there any way to address the problems and \r\nchallenges besetting the world by using the prevailing \r\ninternational mechanisms and tools so as to help \r\nhumankind achieve its long-standing aspirations of \r\npeace, security and equality? \r\n All those who tried to introduce reforms while \r\npreserving the existing norms and tendencies have \r\nfailed. The valuable efforts made by the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement, the Group of 77 and the Group of 15, as \r\nwell as by some prominent individuals, have failed to \r\nbring about fundamental changes, although they did \r\nhave their respective impacts and effects. \r\n The governance and management of the world \r\nrequire fundamental reforms, but what has to be done \r\nnow? Efforts must be made, with firm resolve and \r\nthrough collective cooperation, to map out a new plan \r\non the basis of principles and the very foundation of \r\nsuch universal human values as monotheism, justice, \r\nfreedom, love and the quest for happiness, on the basis \r\nof happiness for all. \r\n The idea of creating the United Nations remains a \r\ngreat and historic achievement of humankind. Its \r\nimportance must be appreciated and its capacities must \r\nbe used for our noble goals, to the extent possible. We \r\nshould not allow the Organization, which reflects the \r\ncollective will and shared aspirations of the community \r\nof nations, to deviate from its main course and play \r\ninto the hands of the world Powers. \r\n The necessary groundwork must be laid to ensure \r\ncollective participation and the involvement of nations \r\nin efforts to promote lasting peace and security. The \r\nshared and collective management of the world must \r\nbe achieved in its true sense and be based on the \r\nunderlying principles enshrined in international law. \r\nJustice must serve as the criterion and the basis for all \r\ninternational decisions and actions.  \r\n All of us should acknowledge the fact that there \r\nis no way other than the shared and collective \r\nmanagement of the world to put an end to today’s \r\nworldwide disorder, tyranny and discrimination. This is \r\nindeed the only way to ensure the prosperity and \r\nwelfare of human society, which is an established and \r\nvivid truth. While acknowledging that truth, one should \r\nnote that acknowledgement alone is not enough. We \r\nmust believe in it and spare no effort towards its \r\nrealization. \r\n The shared and collective management of the \r\nworld is the legitimate right of all nations. As their \r\nrepresentatives, we have an obligation to defend their \r\nrights. Although some Powers continuously try to \r\nfrustrate all international efforts aimed at promoting \r\ncollective cooperation, we must nevertheless \r\nstrengthen our belief in achieving the desired goal of \r\nestablishing shared and collective cooperation to run \r\nthe world. \r\n The United Nations was created to enable the \r\neffective participation of all nations in international \r\ndecision-making processes. We all know that this goal \r\nhas not yet been fulfilled, owing to the absence of \r\njustice in the current management structures and \r\nmechanisms of the United Nations.  \r\n The composition of the Security Council is unjust \r\nand inequitable. Therefore, changes that include the \r\nrestructuring of the United Nations are considered as \r\nthe basic demands of nations and must be addressed by \r\nthe General Assembly. \r\n During last year’s session, I emphasized the \r\nimportance of this issue and called for the designation \r\nof the present decade as the decade of shared and \r\ncollective global management, and for all capacities \r\nand resources to be mobilized in that direction. I would \r\nnow like to reiterate my proposal. I am sure that, \r\nthrough international cooperation, the efforts of \r\ncommitted world leaders and Governments, an \r\ninsistence on justice and the support of all other \r\nnations, we can expedite the process of building a \r\nbright common future. This movement is certainly on \r\nthe rightful path to its creation, and carries with it the \r\nassurance of a promising future for humankind. That \r\n A/66/PV.15\r\n \r\n19 11-50865 \r\n \r\nfuture will be built when humankind sets off on the \r\npath of the divine prophets and the righteous, under the \r\nleadership of Imam Al-Mahdi, the ultimate saviour of \r\nhumankind and the heir to all divine messengers and \r\nleaders and to the pure generation of our great prophet. \r\n The creation of a supreme and ideal society with \r\nthe arrival of a perfect human being who is a true and \r\nsincere lover of all humankind is the guaranteed \r\npromise of Allah. He will come with Jesus Christ to \r\nlead those who love freedom and justice to eradicate \r\ntyranny and discrimination and promote knowledge, \r\npeace, justice, freedom and love across the world. He \r\nwill present to every single individual all the beauty of \r\nthe world and all good things that bring happiness, the \r\npromise of a better tomorrow and the sweet taste of life \r\nto all humankind.  \r\n Today nations have been awakened and, with the \r\nincrease in public awareness, they no longer submit to \r\noppression and discrimination. The world today is \r\nwitnessing more than ever a widespread awakening in \r\nIslamic lands, in Asia, in Europe and in America. \r\nEvery day, those movements are expanding their scope \r\nand influence to pursue the realization of justice, \r\nfreedom and the creation of a better tomorrow. \r\n Our great nation, with its millennial civilization \r\nand history, stands ready to join hands with other \r\nnations to march along that beautiful path, in harmony \r\nand in line with the shared aspirations of humankind. \r\nLet us salute love and freedom, let us salute justice and \r\nknowledge and let us salute the bright future that \r\nawaits humankind. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of \r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran for the statement he has \r\njust made. \r\n Mr. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, President of the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Ms. Roza Otunbaeva, President of the \r\nKyrgyz Republic \r\n \r\n The President: The General Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Kyrgyz \r\nRepublic. \r\n Ms. Roza Otunbaeva, President of the Kyrgyz \r\nRepublic, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations Her Excellency Ms. Roza Otunbaeva, \r\nPresident of the Kyrgyz Republic, and to invite her to \r\naddress the Assembly. \r\n President Otunbaeva (spoke in Russian): At the \r\noutset, allow me to congratulate Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon on his well-deserved reappointment and to \r\nwish him continued success in his high and responsible \r\nmission. It also gives me great pleasure to congratulate \r\nMr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on his election as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth \r\nsession. \r\n We welcome the newest member of our family, \r\nSouth Sudan, which just joined the United Nations as \r\nour 193rd Member State. \r\n The world today is undergoing great \r\ntransformations. The year-long global financial crisis \r\ngives little sign of being resolved in the near future. \r\nEven the most developed economies of the world are \r\nexperiencing the most serious trials of their histories. \r\nAt the same time, we are fascinated by the success of \r\ncountries that only yesterday were struggling against \r\npoverty and stagnation. Humankind is experiencing \r\nchanges of the most extreme kind. We believe that at \r\nthis historic moment the United Nations must stay \r\nahead of the new realities and lead humankind to \r\npositive new beginnings. \r\n The people of Kyrgyzstan have been watching the \r\nhistoric developments in North Africa and the Middle \r\nEast with feelings of solidarity and sincere empathy. \r\nOne spring, a year before the Arab Spring, we \r\noverthrew tyranny in our own land. Our country in the \r\nheart of Central Asia has now moved from a harsh \r\npresidential form of Government to a parliamentary \r\nGovernment. \r\n Last year, despite serious obstacles, Kyrgyzstan \r\nsucceeded in holding what were recognized by \r\ninternational observers to be unprecedented, free and \r\nfair parliamentary elections and a constitutional \r\nreferendum. Kyrgyzstan is now ruled by a coalition \r\nGovernment that, together with an active and \r\ninfluential parliamentary opposition, is learning to find \r\nsolutions to problems in the interests of the whole of \r\nsociety, and not just cater to the ever-increasing \r\ndemands of kleptocrats, as it did before. Mechanisms \r\nare now in place to ensure transparency in Government \r\ndecision-making.  \r\nA/66/PV.15  \r\n \r\n11-50865 20 \r\n \r\n The authorities’ new openness and accountability \r\nto the people have already begun to bear fruit. The \r\neconomy is growing. Over the past year alone, \r\ninvestments in education and health care have \r\nincreased significantly. A fundamental reform of the \r\njudiciary has begun. This year, on 30 October the \r\npeople of Kyrgyzstan will take part in the final phase \r\nof the transitional period — the election of a new \r\npresident of the Republic. In Kyrgyzstan, we want to \r\nestablish a tradition of peaceful, civilized transfer of \r\npower, in accordance with the Constitution and in the \r\ninterests of the people. \r\n Before the world community, I wish from this \r\nrostrum to address my own people. Our striving for \r\ndemocracy and unwavering push to build an open \r\nsociety are at the centre of the world’s attention. The \r\nwhole world is watching us. We must be worthy of and \r\ncherish the freedom that we have won at such a high \r\nprice. We have no right to divide ourselves along \r\nethnic, regional or religious lines. Pan-national unity, \r\nthe rule of law, good governance, civic participation \r\nand a free press are the achievements that will help us \r\nto build a prosperous and strong country. \r\n(spoke in Kyrgyz; English text provided by the \r\ndelegation) \r\n My beloved Kyrgyz nation! Cherish your \r\nindependence, preserve your unity and strengthen your \r\ndemocracy! \r\n(spoke in Russian) \r\n I take this opportunity to invite Member States \r\nand international organizations to send their observers \r\nto Kyrgyzstan for the upcoming presidential election. \r\n On the basis of our 20 years’ experience of \r\nindependence, we know that the path from victory over \r\nauthoritarian regimes to building a functioning \r\ndemocracy is not a straight or easy one. In recent \r\ndecades, the wealth of the people of Kyrgyzstan, like \r\nthat of the people of many other countries, has been \r\nplundered by corrupt and criminal rulers. Billions of \r\ndollars have been spirited out of the country. Dictators \r\nshould be held accountable for committing crimes \r\nagainst their own people and should not be welcomed \r\nor provided refuge abroad. \r\n The time has come for our Organization to \r\ndevelop clear standards and procedures to ensure \r\njustice and the return of embezzled funds to their \r\nrightful owners. This is not about settling personal \r\naccounts or politically motivated harassment; it is \r\nabove all about delivering justice and ending impunity. \r\n We are convinced that restoring peace and \r\nstrengthening the rule of law in Afghanistan will \r\ndepend less on coercive measures than on the pace and \r\nmethods we use to resolve social and economic \r\nproblems. We believe that the decision to withdraw \r\ninternational troops from Afghanistan must be taken \r\nonly once the situation there has been tangibly \r\nstabilized and once the Afghan National Army and \r\nPolice have sufficient capacity to assume responsibility \r\nfor the security of their country and its borders. \r\n We continue to cooperate with the international \r\ncommunity and the United Nations system in \r\novercoming the consequences of the last year’s clashes \r\nin the city of Osh. In this regard, I am sincerely \r\ngrateful to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and the \r\nsecretariat of the Peacebuilding Fund for supporting \r\nour efforts to build sustainable peace.  \r\n Turning to the main theme of the sixty-sixth \r\nsession of the General Assembly, “The role of \r\nmediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful \r\nmeans”, I wish to refer specifically to the role of \r\nwomen in times of crisis and to their courage and \r\nsincerity, which were praised by President Roussef \r\nfrom this rostrum. When peace is broken and men take \r\nup arms, it is women who often take responsibility for \r\nending violence and restoring peaceful life in their \r\ncommunities. The leadership of mothers, wives and \r\nsisters can force politicians to resolve their \r\ndisagreements on the basis of compromise and mutual \r\nunderstanding. Worldwide, women are a force for \r\npeace.  \r\n That is precisely the case in my country, where \r\nwomen are helping to restoring peace and enhancing \r\ndemocracy. One-third of the seats in Parliament are \r\nheld by women. The President of the Supreme Court, \r\nthe Attorney General, the President of the National \r\nBank, ministers, governors, countless activists and \r\nlocal leaders are also women. I firmly believe that, \r\nunder the strong leadership of Michelle Bachelet, the \r\nnew, important body that is UN-Women will become a \r\nchampion of women’s rights around the world. \r\n Kyrgyzstan is concerned by the shrinking \r\nattention of the world community to global climate \r\nchange. In every corner of the world, including our \r\nregion, this issue has become a part of every country’s \r\nsecurity. \r\n A/66/PV.15\r\n \r\n21 11-50865 \r\n \r\n We have waited too long to welcome Palestine as \r\na full Member of the United Nations. As early as 1995, \r\nKyrgyzstan recognized Palestine along its 1967 \r\nborders, and we join the Secretary-General in his call \r\nfor Israel and Palestine to return to the negotiating \r\ntable. Palestine and Israel should become good \r\nneighbours on the basis of the two-State solution. The \r\ncitizens of both countries must finally enjoy their right \r\nto live in their lands in peace and security. We, the \r\nnations of the world, hope for the earliest possible \r\nresolution of this long-running conflict. \r\n My country has submitted its candidacy for a \r\nnon-permanent seat on the Security Council for the \r\nperiod 2012-2013. The Kyrgyz Republic, as a member \r\nof the Group of Landlocked Developing Countries and \r\nthe group of small countries with economies in \r\ntransition, and as a young democracy with a multi-\r\nconfessional population, supports the need for the \r\nwider representation of all categories of countries on \r\nthe Security Council. In this regard, I request Member \r\nStates to support Kyrgyzstan’s candidacy to a \r\nnon-permanent seat on the Security Council.  \r\n The agendas of our meetings and daily headlines \r\nare dominated by natural disasters, financial crises and \r\npolitical upheavals. The absence of justice, \r\ndiscrimination and severe violations of human rights \r\nremain a part of our lives. At the same time, however, \r\nwe are witnessing with bewilderment inspiring \r\nhistorical changes, amazing technological progress, the \r\neradication of previously incurable diseases and, over \r\nthe course of just one generation, the lifting of \r\nhundreds of millions of people out of destitution and \r\ndisenfranchisement. \r\n In this time of change, we must do our utmost to \r\nensure that that the young people of our planet are as \r\nknowledgeable, as optimistic and as courageous as \r\npossible in efforts to achieve prosperity, peace and \r\nsecurity around the world. Young people are not just \r\nthe future of humankind; they are also its present. Let \r\nus all open every door and create every opportunity for \r\nthe growth and development of the younger generation. \r\nTomorrow is born today! \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Kyrgyz \r\nRepublic for the statement she has just made. \r\n Ms. Roza Otunbaeva, President of the Kyrgyz \r\nRepublic, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\nAgenda item 8 (continued) \r\n \r\nGeneral debate \r\n \r\n  Address by His Highness Sheikh Naser \r\nAl-Mohammad Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, Prime \r\nMinister of the State of Kuwait \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the Prime Minister of the \r\nState of Kuwait. \r\n Sheikh Naser Al-Mohammad Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, \r\nPrime Minister of the State of Kuwait, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum. \r\n Sheikh Al-Sabah (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): At \r\nthe outset, let me say that it is my pleasure to \r\npersonally extend to you, Mr. President, on behalf of \r\nthe Government and the people of the State of Kuwait, \r\nmy most sincere congratulations on your unanimous \r\nelection as President of the sixty-sixth session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. Your election represents an \r\nacknowledgement and an appreciation of the prominent \r\nstature of the fraternal State of Qatar, which has strong \r\nand distinct links and relations with my country, \r\nKuwait. I am confident, Sir, that you will conduct the \r\nwork of this session in a manner conducive to ensuring \r\nits success. \r\n We also would like to pay tribute to the efforts of \r\nyour predecessor, Mr. Joseph Deiss, on his outstanding \r\npresidency and his successful conduct of the work of \r\nthe previous session. \r\n We congratulate His Excellency Mr. Ban \r\nKi-moon on his reappointment as Secretary-General \r\nand wish him continued success. \r\n We were pleased to see the accession by the State \r\nof South Sudan to the United Nations. Kuwait \r\nrecognized the State of South Sudan on the first day of \r\nits independence. We are confident that the \r\nGovernment and the brotherly people of South \r\nSudan — a people with whom we are proud to have a \r\nstrong relationship — will achieve security, stability \r\nand economic development for their country. \r\n There is no doubt that our Organization is \r\ngrowing more important by the day. Over the past six \r\ndecades, the international arena has been the scene of \r\nnumerous events and developments that have had a \r\ndirect impact on international peace and security. As \r\nthe most legitimate, credible and independent \r\nmultilateral international mechanism, the United \r\nA/66/PV.15  \r\n \r\n11-50865 22 \r\n \r\nNations has remained a safe haven for Member States \r\nseeking solutions to questions, problems and crises. \r\nThere is a general conviction that no one country \r\nalone, no matter how powerful and capable, can face \r\nthe dangers of terrorism, the proliferation of weapons \r\nof mass destruction, climate change, epidemics, \r\norganized crime or any challenges that do not respect \r\nor recognize geographic or national borders. \r\n Recently, the role of the United Nations has \r\nexpanded significantly. This is particularly true in \r\nconnection with the humanitarian disasters that we \r\nhave witnessed, whether man-made or natural. The \r\nlatest example was the famine affecting the Horn of \r\nAfrica as a result of drought and violence. The United \r\nNations has been able to mobilize humanitarian aid and \r\nto provide humanitarian assistance to those in need. \r\nThose actions have alleviated the suffering and saved \r\nthe lives of millions. \r\n The growing importance of the United Nations in \r\nour world today requires the improvement and \r\nstrengthening of its capabilities. We must enhance its \r\nperformance. This will require measures and steps to \r\nreform its major bodies, including the General \r\nAssembly, the Security Council and the Economic and \r\nSocial Council, as well as develop their functions and \r\nresponsibilities to enable those bodies to carry them \r\nout efficiently and effectively. It is therefore incumbent \r\nupon all States Members of the United Nations to \r\nsupport the Organization, commit to implementing its \r\nresolutions and provide it with the needed financial \r\nresources, in a timely manner without any conditions. \r\nIn the final analysis, the power of the United Nations is \r\nbut a reflection of the support that Member States \r\nprovide in pursuance of its lofty objectives and the \r\nfulfilment of its needs. \r\n We have witnessed with great concern the \r\ndevelopments and events in the Middle East region, \r\nsuch as will lead to more deterioration in its security \r\nand stability. The use of force and the acts of violence \r\nthat have claimed the lives of thousands must cease so \r\nas to prevent further bloodshed. The legitimate \r\ndemands of peoples for the implementation of serious \r\nand prompt political, economic and social reforms \r\nmust be heeded. In that respect, the State of Kuwait \r\nsupports all efforts calling for dialogue, understanding \r\nand the rejection of violence. \r\n The State of Kuwait attaches great importance to \r\nconsolidating and developing its relations with its \r\nneighbours on firm and solid grounds, based on mutual \r\nrespect and common interests, as well as to promoting \r\nthese relations to a level that meets the aspirations of \r\nthe peoples of the region. In this context, the State of \r\nKuwait supports the calls made on the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran to take serious and genuine \r\nconfidence-building measures, to abide by the \r\nresolutions of international legitimacy, to cooperate \r\nwith the International Atomic Energy Agency so as to \r\ndispel fears and doubts surrounding its nuclear \r\nprogrammes, and to cooperate positively in resolving \r\nthe dispute over the occupied Emirati islands according \r\nto the principles and rules of international law. \r\n This year, the State of Kuwait celebrated the \r\nfiftieth anniversary of its independence and the \r\ntwentieth anniversary of its liberation from the Iraqi \r\nSaddami occupation. That liberation was truly \r\nconsidered one of the most salient successes of the \r\nUnited Nations in its efforts to deter aggression and \r\neliminate its effects, based on the principles of the \r\nCharter and the resolutions of international legitimacy. \r\n In November, Kuwait will also celebrate the \r\nfiftieth anniversary of its Constitution, which codified \r\nthe democracy that has become an integral part of the \r\nState of Kuwait since its establishment. That is \r\nconsidered one of the most outstanding achievements \r\nof the people and Government of Kuwait. Those are all \r\nhistoric occasions for a small peace-loving country that \r\nbelieves in the principles and purposes of the United \r\nNations Charter and international law.  \r\n Our country relies in its relations with other \r\nStates on respect for the principles of sovereignty, \r\nindependence and non-interference in the internal \r\naffairs of others, as well as the settlement of all \r\ndisputes by peaceful means. The State of Kuwait also \r\nseeks to overcome its painful memories by establishing \r\nstrong relations of cooperation, mutual respect and \r\ngood-neighbourliness with the brotherly Republic of \r\nIraq. We deeply hope that development and stability \r\nwill prevail there, and that further progress will be \r\nachieved in Iraq’s efforts to enforce security and \r\nrebuild the economy, which was destroyed by the \r\nformer regime’s aggressive and expansionist policies. \r\nWe reaffirm our commitment to providing all forms of \r\nsupport to help Iraq implement its remaining \r\ninternational obligations under the relevant Security \r\nCouncil resolutions and regain its role in the regional \r\nand international sphere. \r\n A/66/PV.15\r\n \r\n23 11-50865 \r\n \r\n More than six decades have elapsed and the \r\nUnited Nations remains incapable of finding a solution \r\nto the Palestinian question and of putting an end to the \r\nIsraeli occupation of Arab territories. Worse, the \r\nsuffering of the Palestinian people only increases with \r\nthe years. Their economic and social conditions \r\nworsen, settlements expand, their lands are confiscated, \r\ntheir water is stolen, their homes and land are besieged, \r\ntheir movements are restricted and their sons and \r\ndaughters are imprisoned. Most troubling of all is that \r\nthe international community stands idly by, a passive \r\nspectator to Israel’s unchanging practices and policies, \r\ndespite the fact that those policies not only violate the \r\nmost rudimentary rules of international law and \r\nresolutions of international legitimacy, but undermine \r\nany chance to achieve peace.  \r\n Israel’s inhumane practices against our brothers \r\nin Gaza — such as the totally unjustified blockade and \r\nthe deliberate destruction of infrastructure, despite \r\ncontinued international condemnation, to name but \r\ntwo — are a glaring example of Israel’s indifference to \r\nits obligations and world public opinion. The \r\ninternational community is therefore called upon to \r\npursue its efforts to bring pressure to bear on Israel so \r\nthat the Palestinian people enjoy their right to self-\r\ndetermination.  \r\n The Palestinian State must be established, with \r\nEast Jerusalem as its capital, and the Israeli occupation \r\nof all the Arab territories it has occupied since 4 June \r\n1967, including the Syrian Golan, must end. Israel \r\nmust also cease its continued violations of the \r\nsovereignty of Lebanon and withdraw from all its \r\noccupied territories. We wish to renew once again our \r\nfull commitment and support to the bid and endeavours \r\nof the Palestinian Authority to obtain membership in \r\nthe United Nations as an independent, sovereign and \r\nfull Member State. \r\n The State of Kuwait welcomes the international \r\nreports issued by the United Nations and its agencies \r\nconcerning the Millennium Development Goals \r\nadopted at the 2000 Millennium Summit and the status \r\nof their achievement. We can all be proud of the \r\naccomplishments in reducing the number of persons \r\ninfected with HIV/AIDS and providing medication to \r\ngreater numbers of infected people, as well as progress \r\nin fighting other communicable diseases, such as \r\nmalaria and tuberculosis. However, despite those \r\naccomplishments, much remains to be done, since \r\nthese accomplishments are unevenly distributed among \r\nStates. Many indicators confirm that some States will \r\nnot be able to achieve the Millennium Development \r\nGoals by 2015.  \r\n That could be attributed to a number of causes, \r\nthe most obvious of which is the ongoing global \r\neconomic and financial crisis and its negative impact \r\non the majority of States, large and small, rich and \r\npoor. However, developing countries, especially the \r\nleast developed, have suffered most because of the \r\nweakness and vulnerability of their economies. Their \r\neconomic growth has faltered and the volume of their \r\nexports fallen, while unemployment rates have risen. \r\nAt the same time, the prices of food and basic \r\ncommodities have risen, exacerbating the economic \r\nand social impact of the crisis.  \r\n No sooner had the world started to recover from \r\nthe economic crisis than the symptoms of another \r\nbegan to emerge, threatening once again the growth of \r\nthe global economy. That new crisis is exemplified in \r\nthe sovereign debt of the United States and a number of \r\nEuropean countries. The international community must \r\nforge ahead in restructuring the international financial \r\ninstitutions in order to ensure their sustainability, \r\nimprove their ability to perform their duties effectively \r\nand efficiently, and make them more representative of \r\nand fair to the countries that need their support. \r\n The world today is in dire need of a just, fair and \r\nbalanced global trading system that bridges the \r\nenormous gap between States, ensures mutual benefit \r\nand assists in integrating the economies of poor \r\ncountries into the global economic system. Developed \r\ncountries must also fulfil their commitments and \r\nincrease their official development assistance to the \r\nlevel of 0.7 per cent of their gross domestic product, as \r\nagreed internationally. \r\n In that context, the State of Kuwait will spare no \r\neffort to provide emergency humanitarian assistance to \r\nStates stricken by natural disasters or to respond to \r\nappeals by the United Nations or its agencies to \r\nalleviate the suffering of the peoples of such States. We \r\nbelieve in the importance of the role of the United \r\nNations in the field of humanitarian assistance, and the \r\nState of Kuwait has therefore increased its voluntary \r\ncontributions to a number of international \r\norganizations and specialized agencies, such as the \r\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for \r\nRefugees, the United Nations Central Emergency \r\nA/66/PV.15  \r\n \r\n11-50865 24 \r\n \r\nResponse Fund and the International Committee of the \r\nRed Cross.  \r\n Although the State of Kuwait is a developing \r\ncountry, since its independence in 1961 it has followed \r\na special policy in support of developing countries and \r\nleast developed countries by extending a helping hand \r\nand providing humanitarian and development \r\nassistance when and as needed. More than 100 \r\ncountries throughout the world have benefited from \r\nthat assistance, which exceeds $15 billion. \r\n The Emir of the State of Kuwait has launched \r\nseveral initiatives, including the decent living \r\ninitiative, the initiative to support and encourage small \r\nand medium-size projects, and the initiative to develop \r\nand rebuild eastern Sudan, with a view to alleviating \r\nthe suffering in many countries affected by the increase \r\nin the prices of food and energy, as well as those whose \r\neconomies have been affected by the global financial \r\ncrisis and have witnessed increased unemployment and \r\npoverty. Many countries have benefited from those \r\ninitiatives. \r\n The United Nations has convened numerous \r\ninternational conferences and adopted many \r\nresolutions, agreements and statements. It has united \r\nour visions, guided our endeavours and mobilized our \r\nresources and our potential so as to consolidate our \r\ncommon work to combat corruption, strengthen the \r\nrule of law and good governance, ensure respect for \r\nhuman rights, and empower women and bolster their \r\nrole in society, inter alia.  \r\n We look forward to a more effective international \r\nrole within the context of the Alliance of Civilizations \r\ninitiative, in order to intensify dialogue between \r\nvarious civilizations, religions and cultures; \r\ndisseminate the values of tolerance, moderation and \r\nmutual respect; and reject any expression of violence \r\nor extremism, which undermine our potential to work \r\ntogether to spread the culture of peace and abide by the \r\nlofty purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter \r\nof our Organization. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the Prime \r\nMinister of the State of Kuwait for the statement he has \r\njust made. \r\n His Highness Sheikh Naser Al-Mohammad \r\nAl-Ahmad Al-Sabah, Prime Minister of the State \r\nof Kuwait, was escorted from the rostrum.  \r\n  Address by Mr. David Cameron, Prime \r\nMinister, First Lord of the Treasury \r\nand Minister for the Civil Service of the \r\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and \r\nNorthern Ireland \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the Prime Minister, First Lord of the \r\nTreasury and Minister for the Civil Service of the \r\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. \r\n Mr. David Cameron, Prime Minister, First Lord \r\nof the Treasury and Minister for the Civil Service \r\nof the United Kingdom of Great Britain and \r\nNorthern Ireland, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n  The President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. David Cameron, Prime \r\nMinister, First Lord of the Treasury and Minister for \r\nthe Civil Service of the United Kingdom of Great \r\nBritain and Northern Ireland, and inviting him to \r\naddress the General Assembly.  \r\n  Mr. Cameron (United Kingdom): It is an honour \r\nto address the General Assembly for the first time, and \r\nit is a particular honour to do so as such momentous \r\nevents unfold in the Arab world. Last week I was in \r\nTripoli and Benghazi. I saw the hunger of a people \r\neager to get on with reclaiming their country, writing \r\nthemselves a new chapter of freedom and democracy. \r\nThis has been the most dramatic episode of what has \r\nbeen called the Arab Spring. \r\n My argument today is that Libya and the Arab \r\nSpring show that the United Nations needs a new way \r\nof working, because the Arab Spring is a massive \r\nopportunity to spread peace, prosperity, democracy \r\nand, vitally, security, but only if we really seize the \r\nopportunity.  \r\n So the events of this year present a challenge to \r\nall of us — a challenge to Europe to show it can reform \r\nits aid and trade strategy to be truly progressive; a \r\nchallenge to the African Union, to meet the \r\nopportunities of this century with the same courage \r\nthat won liberation in the last; a challenge to the \r\nIsraelis and Palestinians, to take the bold steps to come \r\nto the table and make lasting peace; a challenge to Iran \r\nand to Syria, to give their peoples the freedoms they \r\ndeserve; and a challenge to the United Nations. \r\n One can sign every human rights declaration in \r\nthe world, but if one stands by and watches people \r\nbeing slaughtered in their own country when one could \r\n A/66/PV.15\r\n \r\n25 11-50865 \r\n \r\nact, then what are those signatures really worth? The \r\nUnited Nations has to show that we can be not just \r\nunited in condemnation, but united in action, acting in \r\na way that lives up to the United Nations founding \r\nprinciples and meets the needs of peoples everywhere. \r\n The peoples of the Arab world have made their \r\naspirations clear. They want transparency and \r\naccountability of Government, an end to corruption, \r\nthe fair and consistent rule of law, the chance to get a \r\njob and to have a stake in how their country is run, the \r\nfreedom to communicate and the chance to participate \r\nin shaping society as citizens with rights and \r\nresponsibilities. \r\n No one says that achieving those ambitions will \r\nbe easy. There will be false starts and wrong turns \r\nalong the way, not least where countries have inherited \r\nsectarian and regional divisions, weak political parties, \r\nState institutions enfeebled by misuse and a politics \r\ndistorted by the false choice between repression on the \r\none hand and Islamist extremism on the other. \r\n The long process of developing a new and \r\naccountable Government is just beginning. And across \r\nthe region, we cannot guarantee that the process of \r\nreform is irreversible. But let us be clear. These \r\ndevelopments present a great opportunity for many \r\nwho have long been sold short by their Governments, \r\nand there is an opportunity and responsibility for all of \r\nus, too. \r\n Just as after 1989 we helped those who tore down \r\nthe Berlin Wall to build robust democracies and market \r\neconomies, just as in 1994 we welcomed South Africa \r\nback into the commonwealth of nations when it chose \r\nthe path of reconciliation and democracy instead of \r\nracial conflict, so now in 2011, as people in North \r\nAfrica and the Middle East stand up and give voice to \r\ntheir hopes for more open and democratic societies, we \r\nhave an opportunity, and, I would say, a responsibility \r\nto help them. \r\n Now the mistake we often make in the West is to \r\nthink that because the people in this region want \r\ndemocracy, they will want it in the same way and with \r\nthe same outcomes that we do. We should not be trying \r\nto impose Western values or a single template on the \r\nregion. Democracy is a process, not an event. \r\nParticipatory Government involves so much more than \r\njust the simple act of voting. The Assembly heard not \r\nlong ago from President Ahmadinejad. He did not \r\nremind us that he runs a country where they may have \r\nelections, of a sort, but they also repress freedom of \r\nspeech. They do everything they can to avoid the \r\naccountability of a free media. They violently prevent \r\ndemonstrations. And yes, they detain and torture those \r\nwho argue for a better future. So we should never \r\npretend that having elections is enough. The building \r\nblocks of democracy have to be patiently developed \r\nfrom the grass roots up. The process will be different in \r\nevery country. And it is not for us to dictate how Arab \r\nnations should respond to those challenges, or to \r\nlecture them about how to do it. But there is an \r\nimportant opportunity for us to help, and we must seize \r\nit.  \r\n There are important lessons from what has \r\nhappened in Libya. The Libyans liberated themselves. \r\nOrdinary Libyans from all walks of life came together \r\nand showed incredible resilience and bravery as they \r\nrose up and drove out Al-Qadhafi. The people of \r\nBenghazi, the brave fighters of Misurata, the people of \r\nZawiyah, the warriors from the Nafusa Mountains, all \r\nof them showed incredible courage in liberating their \r\ncountry. The National Transitional Council, which \r\ndemonstrated great leadership, not least as Tripoli fell, \r\nurged people to avoid reprisals and to look to the \r\nfuture — a message that still holds true today.  \r\n That revolution truly belongs to the Libyan \r\npeople. The United Nations played a vital role \r\nauthorizing international action. But let us be clear; the \r\nUnited Nations is no more effective than the nation \r\nStates that come together to enforce its will. And on \r\nthis occasion a coalition of nations across the Western \r\nand Arab world had the will to act. In doing so, they \r\nstopped Benghazi from joining Srebrenica and Rwanda \r\nin history’s painful roll call of massacres that the world \r\nfailed to prevent. Today, Tripoli and Benghazi are \r\ncities transformed. Where there was fear, now there is \r\nhope and an optimism and belief that are truly \r\ninspiring.  \r\n But there are challenges ahead, not just in Libya \r\nbut all across the region. Economies in the region have \r\nunderperformed when compared with their peers. In \r\n1960, Egypt’s gross domestic product per capita was \r\ncomparable with Korea’s. Today it has fallen to around \r\njust one fifth of the size. Across the region, some \r\ncountries dependent on oil revenues, and others held \r\nback by heavy State control have failed to diversify \r\nand create jobs in productive new sectors and failed to \r\nconnect themselves to the economies of the region and \r\nthe wider world.  \r\nA/66/PV.15  \r\n \r\n11-50865 26 \r\n \r\n Indeed, less than four per cent of North African \r\ntrade is within the region, making it the least integrated \r\nneighbourhood in our world. And the promise of \r\neconomic reform has not been fulfilled. Too often \r\npeople were told economic reform would bring them \r\nmarket economies with greater freedom to start up \r\nbusinesses, to trade, to grow and to create wealth. But \r\nit did not. It brought them corrupt and crony \r\ncapitalism. Now the future is for the people of this \r\nregion to determine, but I would urge them not to reject \r\nsomething they have never had — a genuine, open, fair \r\nand transparent market economy, which has proved the \r\nworld over to be the best way to create jobs and \r\nwealth. And the need for economic success is vital, \r\nbecause this is a region where 60 per cent of the \r\npopulation is under 25, and youth unemployment is \r\nnearly double the world average. \r\n It is a region that must create 50 million new jobs \r\nby 2020 just to keep pace with its population; that \r\nmeans 700,000 new jobs every year in Egypt alone. \r\nAnd these jobs should not be just for men. Let us be \r\nhonest. It is not just the men of the region who want a \r\njob and a voice. The unemployment rate for Egyptian \r\nwomen is more than three times that of men. And it is \r\nnot only the economy where they are denied the chance \r\nto play a fuller role. It is society and politics and \r\nculture too. But look at the crowds in Freedom Square \r\nand we see it is the women too, finding their voices, \r\nshowing clearly that they want to play a part in \r\nbuilding their future. \r\n So, in this historic period, when the voice of this \r\nregion is finally being heard, there is now a unique \r\nopportunity for women to fulfil their ambitions too. \r\nThis is not just in the interests of women. It is in the \r\ninterests of those countries as a whole. Let us be clear. \r\nYou cannot build strong economies, open societies and \r\ninclusive political systems if you lock out women. So \r\nthe Arab Spring will not succeed if the opportunities \r\nthat are opening up are denied to half of the \r\npopulation.  \r\n Now, of course, the actions we take to support the \r\npeople in each country must be tailored to that country, \r\nwith respect for its particular culture, history and \r\ntradition. What is right for Libya will not necessarily \r\nbe right for everywhere else. But the international \r\ncommunity has found its voice in Libya, and we must \r\nnot now lose our nerve. We must have the confidence \r\nto speak out and act as necessary to support those who \r\nseek new freedoms.  \r\n In the European Union, it is time to ensure that \r\nthe billions of euros we spend in this region each year \r\nare used to support reform that will meet the \r\naspirations of the people. And there should be no more \r\nexcuses for denying the people of the region fair access \r\nto our markets, including in agriculture. Here at the \r\nUnited Nations, we have a responsibility to stand up \r\nagainst regimes that persecute their people. We need to \r\nsee reform in Yemen. And above all, on Syria, it is time \r\nfor the members of the Security Council to act. We \r\nmust now adopt a credible resolution, threatening \r\ntough sanctions. \r\n Of course we should always act with care when it \r\ncomes to the internal affairs of a sovereign State. But \r\nwe cannot allow this to be an excuse for indifference in \r\nthe face of a regime that, week after week, arrests, \r\nintimidates, tortures and kills people who are \r\npeacefully trying to make their voices heard.  \r\n The voice of the African Union is vital too. Africa \r\nhas rightly challenged the world to meet its aid \r\ncommitments. I am proud that Britain will meet its \r\ncommitment to spending 0.7 per cent of gross national \r\nincome from 2013. And all the countries that made \r\npromises at Gleneagles and elsewhere must meet those \r\npromises too. In the case of Britain, it means we have \r\nbeen able to provide £124 million of emergency aid to \r\n3 million people facing starvation in the Horn of \r\nAfrica. But at the same time, Africa must meet its \r\nresponsibilities too.  \r\n Many will find it hard to understand why \r\ncountries in southern Africa which fought so hard to \r\nthrow off oppression themselves, have been so slow to \r\nrespond to the Arab Spring. Of course, I recognize that \r\nmany have long been committed to non-intervention. \r\nBut my argument is that where action is necessary, \r\nlegal and right, to fail to act is to fail those who need \r\nour help. So it is welcome that the African Union is \r\ntaking steps to recognize the National Transitional \r\nCouncil in Libya, as many African countries have \r\nalready done. Africa’s responsibility now is to embrace \r\nand support Libya’s new, inclusive and democratic \r\nfuture. And this must include ensuring that those \r\nwanted for serious crimes are brought to justice, and \r\nthat the wealth stolen from the Libyan people is \r\nreturned to them.  \r\n We all have a responsibility to the Palestinians \r\ntoo. A key part of the Arab Spring is the right of \r\nPalestinians to have a viable State of their own, living \r\n A/66/PV.15\r\n \r\n27 11-50865 \r\n \r\nin peace, alongside a safe and secure State of Israel. \r\nAnd I strongly support this. There has been much \r\nspeculation about what will happen here this week. Let \r\nus be clear about one fact. No resolution can, on its \r\nown, substitute for the political will necessary to bring \r\npeace. Peace will only come when Palestinians and \r\nIsraelis sit down and talk to each other, make \r\ncompromises, build trust and agree. So our role must \r\nbe to support this, to defeat those who embrace \r\nviolence, to stop the growth of settlements and to \r\nsupport Palestinians and Israelis alike to make peace.  \r\n But the opportunity in Libya and elsewhere in the \r\nregion is not just about achieving a more open society, \r\nprosperity and the building blocks of democracy for \r\ntheir own sake — it is about security too. Some have \r\nargued that stability in the Arab world can only be \r\nachieved by the tight control of strong authoritarian \r\nregimes and that reform is a threat to stability. In fact, \r\nthe opposite is true. Reform is the basis of long-term \r\nstability. Authoritarianism threatens it.  \r\n While there is never a justification for resorting \r\nto terror, if people’s hunger for a job and a voice are \r\ndenied, there is a real risk that the frustration and the \r\nalienation they feel will cause them to be drawn to \r\nmore violent and extremist responses. That is not just a \r\nproblem for one region. It is a problem for all of us. \r\nHere, in this great city, where 10 years ago, people of \r\n90 different nationalities were killed in the most \r\nhorrific terrorist attack in history, we must recognize \r\nthat political and economic reform in the Middle East \r\nis not just good in its own right, but that it is also a key \r\npart of how, in the end, we will defeat Al-Qaida.  \r\n Of course, we must meet terrorist activity with a \r\nstrong and resolute security response. Al-Qaida and its \r\noffshoots must know that they will have no safe hiding \r\nplace to plot or recruit young men to train as terrorists. \r\nBut in the long term, we must defeat not only the \r\nterrorists, but the extremist ideology that feeds them. \r\nAl-Qaida’s poisonous ideology has thrived on \r\nrepression. Democracy is what it fears most. People are \r\nnot in Tahrir Square in Cairo and Freedom Square in \r\nLibya for an Islamist caliphate, but for a job, a voice \r\nand a future. And we must heed their call, for their \r\nfreedom and for the security of us all.  \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister, First \r\nLord of the Treasury and Minister for the Civil Service \r\nof the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern \r\nIreland for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. David Cameron, Prime Minister, First Lord \r\nof the Treasury and Minister for the Civil Service \r\nof the United Kingdom of Great Britain and \r\nNorthern Ireland, was escorted from the rostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Herman Van Rompuy, \r\nPresident of the European Council \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear a \r\nstatement by His Excellency Mr. Herman Van Rompuy, \r\nPresident of the European Council. \r\n Mr. Herman Van Rompuy, President of the \r\nEuropean Council, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Herman Van Rompuy, \r\nPresident of the European Council, and inviting him to \r\nmake a statement \r\n Mr. Van Rompuy (European Council) (spoke in \r\nFrench): Europe presents to you a message of \r\ncooperation, support and partnership. I congratulate the \r\nnew President of the General Assembly, Ambassador \r\nAl-Nasser, of Qatar. We fully share, Mr. President, in \r\nyour commitment to mediation as the best way to \r\nachieve the peaceful settlement of conflicts. Your very \r\nfirst predecessor was Paul-Henri Spaak, a man who, in \r\nthe years after the war, played a decisive role in the \r\ncreation of a new and unique forum for cooperation \r\namong European States. At the very beginning, we \r\nwere six Western European nations. Today, we form a \r\nunion of 27 member States spanning an entire \r\ncontinent with 500 million inhabitants, and \r\npartnerships throughout the world. \r\n I am not the first President of the European \r\nCouncil to address the General Assembly to share the \r\nexperiences and vision of Europe. However, I am the \r\nfirst to discharge this duty who is not, at the same time, \r\nthe head of State or Government of his country; the \r\nfirst whose full-time position is to work for unity \r\namong our 27 countries. That institutional innovation \r\ngives our union greater continuity and coherence, \r\nincluding with respect to others leaders worldwide. I \r\ntherefore wish to thank the Assembly for recognizing \r\nthis innovation, by giving me an opportunity to speak. \r\nA/66/PV.15  \r\n \r\n11-50865 28 \r\n \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n In the year since the previous session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly gathered here, the world has \r\nchanged. In some fields, it has changed for the better. \r\nThat is why I would like to speak, first of all, about our \r\nhope; secondly, about some of our worries; and thirdly \r\nand finally, about Europe’s responsibility in the world. \r\n First, there is hope: Hope for the millions of men \r\nand women who recently climbed out of poverty — in \r\nAsia, in Latin America and fortunately more often in \r\nAfrica too. Emerging economies are becoming \r\nemerged societies. There is hope for the newest \r\nmember of this Assembly, the Republic of South \r\nSudan, since its transition to independence. Although \r\nconcerns about the fighting remain, we applaud the end \r\nto decades of civil war. \r\n There is now a new hope that is, for the most \r\npart, due to the will of the peoples in northern Africa \r\nand the Middle East to take the road of democracy. \r\nEven if the fighting is not over, we have seen the defeat \r\nof repression and of terrorism, and the victory of \r\nforward-looking change.  \r\n For Europe, the Arab Spring is one of the most \r\nmomentous political developments since the end of the \r\ncold war. We, Europeans, are linked closely with the \r\nArab world by the bonds of history and geography, and \r\nwe wish for this Spring to blossom. And that is why we \r\nsupport all steps towards democratic transformation \r\nand economic reform that benefit the people. We \r\nsupport those steps with financial resources, access to \r\nour markets, mobility among our countries and with \r\nassistance for state- and nation-building. Our aim is for \r\nthe young men and women in our southern \r\nneighbourhood to feel that they can build a future in \r\ntheir own countries; it is a hope for a better life. \r\n We have done more than that. When, earlier this \r\nyear, there was a risk of bloodbath in Benghazi, \r\nEuropean leaders, together with others, acted with \r\nswiftness and determination, diplomatically — here in \r\nNew York — and militarily. We could not allow the \r\nLibyan regime to take the lives of its own people. The \r\nprinciple of “responsibility to protect” was put into \r\naction — with perseverance and success. Now there is \r\na responsibility to assist the new Libya with the \r\npolitical transition, reconciliation and reconstruction of \r\na united country. The Transitional National Council, \r\ntoday in the Libya seat, is ready for that task. Europe \r\nwas, is, and will remain on the side of the Libyans. \r\n In my view, the Arab Spring has provided two \r\nimportant lessons. The first one is this: 10 years ago, \r\nalmost to the day, when the horrific terrorist attacks of \r\n9/11 were committed in this very city, many feared the \r\nstart of an era of religious hatred. That has not \r\nhappened. The people in the streets of Tunis, Cairo, \r\nBenghazi and across the Arab world aspire to dignity, \r\njobs, equal opportunities, social justice and democracy. \r\nWe witnessed neither extremism, nor the so-called \r\nclash of civilizations, but an episode in the fight for \r\nfreedom and justice. And those should remain the \r\noverriding objectives of the future. \r\n The second lesson is that a political system that \r\ndoes not allow for peaceful change will remain weak at \r\nheart. We praise, therefore, the leaders who are taking \r\ncourageous steps towards positive change. \r\n But alongside the hope, there is reason for worry, \r\ntoo — and that is my second point — about the brutal \r\nand ongoing repression by the Syrian regime against its \r\nown citizens. Europe is keeping the pressure on the \r\nregime with sanctions, and we urge others to join us. \r\n Of course, there are other worries too: worry \r\nabout the famine in Somalia, where thousands of \r\nchildren have died and many more are at risk, and \r\nwhere we must act decisively; worry about ongoing \r\nwars and conflicts; worry about the safety of nuclear \r\nreactors; worry about nuclear proliferation and the \r\nbehaviour of the Iranian and North Korean leadership; \r\nand worry about climate change. In each case, we have \r\nto ask ourselves, as the international community, \r\nwhether we are doing what we should be doing, both in \r\nthe short term — protecting human lives — and in the \r\nlonger term — preserving life for humankind. \r\n Faced with these realities of hope and worry in \r\nthe world, the European Union takes up its \r\nresponsibility, and that is my third point. We act, \r\nsupporting the forces of hope and fighting the causes of \r\nworry, and very concretely so.  \r\n We fight the causes of worry with means and \r\nmoney. The European Union is the world’s largest \r\ndonor of development aid and a major donor of climate \r\nfinance for the poorest nations. \r\n We fight the causes of worry with manpower. We \r\nhave not only tens of thousands of development \r\nworkers, but also thousands of soldiers, policemen and \r\njudges in missions around the world, peacekeeping in \r\nAfrica’s Great Lake region, training police in \r\n A/66/PV.15\r\n \r\n29 11-50865 \r\n \r\nAfghanistan and Iraq, patrolling off the coast of \r\nSomalia. \r\n We fight the causes of worry with a sense of the \r\nglobal common good. In the issues of global \r\ngovernance, Europe looks for solutions. We are \r\nconstructive in world trade negotiations, ambitious in \r\nclimate talks and forthcoming in the reform of the \r\ninternational financial institutions, recognizing the \r\nshift in global economic power. We simply cannot \r\naccept a stalemate, be it in Durban, Doha, Rio or \r\nCannes. \r\n We fight the causes of worry with expertise in \r\nmediation. We mediate in conflicts in our \r\nneighbourhood and beyond, drawing from our \r\nexperience of overcoming age-old rivalries. In the \r\nBalkans, we bring parties together, and, as a member of \r\nthe Quartet, we are fully engaged in finding a solution \r\nin the Middle East peace process. \r\n I would say a word on that issue. The parameters \r\nfor a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict are well \r\nknown. The European Union has outlined these on \r\nnumerous occasions, including here at the United \r\nNations. There is no reason to repeat them. Now is the \r\ntime for politics, dialogue and negotiations. \r\nPopulations have lived in fear and suffering for too \r\nlong. \r\n The principle of a two-State solution was \r\nestablished more than 60 years ago. Only half of it has \r\nbeen implemented. The European Union’s political \r\nposition on the Middle East peace process is well \r\nestablished; it includes a reference to the 1967 borders, \r\nwith territorial swaps acceptable to both parties. \r\nMoreover, the Union is fully supporting financially the \r\nState-building process of the Palestinian Authority. \r\n Now, the resumption of direct talks between \r\nIsrael and the Palestinian Authority is the top priority. \r\nThe legitimate aspirations of both the Palestinian and \r\nthe Israeli peoples for peace, safety and statehood must \r\nbe fulfilled with an agreement that will lead to the \r\nexistence of two States living side by side in peace and \r\nsecurity, and therefore include Israel’s legitimate \r\nsecurity needs and the Palestinians’ desire to end the \r\noccupation. \r\n That is why I say to the leaders on both sides: \r\nThe time to act is now. There are political risks, but \r\nthey need to take them, just like some of their \r\npredecessors did, with a view to offering a better and \r\nsafer future to their communities. The status quo is no \r\noption. The winds of change across the entire region \r\nshould help them to get out of the impasses. I say to \r\nthe leaders on both sides: History is a severe judge of \r\nshort-sightedness. Over time, it only rewards political \r\ncourage and statesmanship. From the European \r\nexperience, we can tell them that a lasting compromise \r\nis grounded in mutual sacrifice and trust. \r\n In a few weeks, a woman somewhere will give \r\nbirth to a child, the 7-billionth human being on Earth. \r\nThe birth of a baby is the strongest sign of hope. But \r\non what planet will this child live? As things stand, we \r\ncannot be certain of saving the environment. Present \r\npatterns of production and consumption are \r\nunsustainable. Moreover, our actions to combat climate \r\nchange are insufficient and below the politically agreed \r\nobjectives. \r\n Clearly, more needs to be done to align words and \r\ndeeds, starting at the United Nations Climate Change \r\nConference to be held in Durban. Europe sticks to its \r\ncommitments. We are delivering on the emissions \r\ntargets, and we invite the rest of the industrialized \r\ncountries to join us. At the coming United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development, the world \r\nshould show its renewed commitment to sustainable \r\ndevelopment. Green growth must become the rallying \r\ncry in countries big and small, rich and poor. And as I \r\nsaid, Europe is ready to help the most vulnerable \r\nnations. \r\n Europe fulfils its responsibilities in the world and \r\nat home. We are now facing our most serious test in \r\nyears — the sovereign debt crisis in the Eurozone. \r\nEuropean leaders are making decisions, individually \r\nand jointly, to bring this storm to an end. We are acting \r\nwith determination and in a spirit of solidarity. It \r\nrequires political courage and statesmanship. \r\n The responsibility that I sense around the table \r\nwith our 27 Presidents and Prime Ministers is not just \r\nrelated to the euro’s weakest economies, or to the \r\neurozone alone. No, we feel a responsibility for the \r\nworld economy as such. Looking to the weeks and \r\nmonths ahead, the Assembly may be assured that we \r\nwill continue to do what it takes to safeguard the \r\nfinancial stability of the eurozone, working on more \r\ngovernance, more fiscal discipline and more fiscal \r\nintegration. It is the defining challenge for my \r\ngeneration. \r\nA/66/PV.15  \r\n \r\n11-50865 30 \r\n \r\n We are aware that people in other economies look \r\nto us, since our problems may affect their jobs, \r\npensions or savings. We likewise expect the other \r\nmajor economies to take responsibility for their \r\ninternal challenges. Each has to bring its own house in \r\norder, be it by bringing down its public debt, \r\nstimulating domestic demand or aligning exchange \r\nrates to economic fundamentals. \r\n(spoke in French)  \r\n Clearly, our agenda is much broader. Members \r\nmay rest assured that Europe will continue to stand \r\nshoulder to shoulder with the United Nations in order \r\nto build a world of peace and security, to promote the \r\nuniversal values of human rights and democracy, and \r\nto fight famine and poverty. In an increasingly \r\nglobalized world, the role of the United Nations is \r\ncrucial. Europe’s 500 million citizens reject any \r\nturning inward or splendid isolation. Furthermore, the \r\nworld does not belong to any one nation. This world is \r\nour world, and it belongs to us all. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the \r\nEuropean Council for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Herman van Rompuy, President of the \r\nEuropean Council, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Turkey \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the Prime Minister of the Republic of \r\nTurkey.  \r\n Mr. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Turkey, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, \r\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Turkey, and inviting \r\nhim to address the General Assembly.  \r\n Mr. Erdoğan (Turkey) (spoke in Turkish; \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): I extend my \r\nwarm and respectful greetings to all, and hope that the \r\nsixty-sixth session of the General Assembly will yield \r\nfruitful results. I would like to congratulate Mr. Nassir \r\nAbdulaziz Al-Nasser on his assumption of the \r\npresidency, and extend my sincere appreciation to Mr. \r\nJoseph Deiss for his service as the previous President \r\nof the Assembly. \r\n We are at a moment when both the international \r\ncommunity and the United Nations are being tested in \r\nan unprecedented manner. I feel obliged, however, to \r\nstate very frankly that today the United Nations is not \r\ndemonstrating the leadership necessary to help \r\nhumankind overcome its fears of the future. The United \r\nNations must therefore reform itself and renew its \r\nvision with a view to protecting the universal rights of \r\nhumankind as a whole, rather than act in the interest \r\nand remain under the guardianship of certain countries. \r\n Last month in Somalia, for instance, I personally \r\nwitnessed how the United Nations and the international \r\ncommunity remain helpless in the face of today’s \r\npressing problems. It is impossible for me to put into \r\nwords the poverty and suffering I saw in Somalia. I am \r\nspeaking of this because I have personally witnessed it, \r\nwith my family and ministers. It is not hearsay; I have \r\nseen it myself. The tragedy of Somalia, where tens of \r\nthousands of children have died for the lack of a mere \r\npiece of bread and drop of water, is a matter of shame \r\nfor the international community and cannot be \r\ndismissed in a few words. The civil war that has gone \r\non for the past 20 years has wiped out all of Somalia’s \r\nresources and livelihood. The Somali people are being \r\ngradually dragged to their death as the world looks on. \r\n The international community is watching the \r\nsuffering in Somalia as if it were a movie. It is urgent, \r\nhowever, that we face this situation, which is a test of \r\nour humanity. In doing so, we should not only look at \r\nthe picture we see today, but also at the shameful \r\nhistory that has led Somalia into this great tragedy. \r\nIndeed, beneath the tip of this huge iceberg lie great \r\ncrimes against humanity. \r\n In that respect, the situation in Somalia has also \r\nrevealed the deep wounds inflicted by the colonialist \r\nmentality that kept Africa under its hegemony for \r\ncenturies. Today, however, this cold colonial attitude \r\nstands aloof from places where it has no interest, and is \r\nwatches idly as millions of children die for want of a \r\nmorsel of bread in Somalia. I will be frank. No one can \r\nspeak of peace, justice or civilization in the world if \r\nthe cry rising from Somalia is left unheard. No words \r\nare sufficient to describe the agony there. \r\n Turkey’s approach to Somalia or any other \r\ninternational issue is firmly grounded on humanitarian \r\nprinciples, which is why we have launched a \r\n A/66/PV.15\r\n \r\n31 11-50865 \r\n \r\ncomprehensive aid campaign for Somalia with the \r\nstrong support of our nation. We have collected \r\ndonations from our people of about $300 million \r\nwithin the past two months; moreover, our \r\nhumanitarian assistance to date totals more than \r\n$30 million. We also organized an emergency meeting \r\nof the Organization of Islamic Cooperation in Istanbul, \r\nat which pledges exceeded $350 million. \r\n Along with emergency humanitarian aid, Turkey \r\nis also determined to help build the infrastructure and \r\nfacilities that will enable Somalia to stand on its own \r\nfeet. In that regard, Turkey has undertaken a wide \r\nrange of projects, from transportation to health and \r\neducation, and from agriculture to fisheries and \r\nconstruction, including roads, hospitals, schools and \r\nwater wells. By reopening our embassy in Mogadishu, \r\nwe have also shown the world that claims of security \r\nproblems cannot be an excuse for delaying assistance. \r\n Along with such measures, it is also essential that \r\nwe bring an end to the civil war as quickly as possible \r\nand provide Somalia with democratic and unified \r\ngovernance in order to succeed in the fight against the \r\npiracy and terrorism originating there. In that regard, \r\nwe would ask everyone to consider why the \r\ninternational community refuses to bestow on Somalia \r\nthe attention it has given to conflict areas elsewhere in \r\nthe world. The entire international community must act \r\nwith a sense of utmost urgency in support of the efforts \r\nto build peace and stability in Somalia. The civil war \r\nthat has suffocated our Somali brothers for 20 years \r\nmust end without further delay. \r\n In that context, the recent progress made by \r\nSomali leaders towards building a national consensus \r\ngives us hope for the future. As Somalia resumes its \r\nwell-deserved place within the international \r\ncommunity, the world will become a safer and more \r\nstable place. It is precisely this understanding that lies \r\nat the heart of Turkey’s determined efforts to help \r\nSomalia. We are making every attempt to implement \r\ninfrastructure investments that will enable Somalia to \r\nstand on its feet, and working unrelentingly to help \r\nestablish an environment of political stability and \r\npeace conducive to sustainable development. We are \r\ndoing this solely because it is our humanitarian \r\nresponsibility, and with no other motive. It is our \r\ngreatest hope that the leadership demonstrated by \r\nTurkey in this area will set an example for the entire \r\ninternational community. \r\n For us, the United Nations symbolizes the ideal \r\nthat international law and justice shall prevail over \r\nsheer force and oppression, that peace shall prevail \r\nover conflict, and that the conscience of humanity shall \r\nprevail over narrow self-interest and political \r\nequilibrium. That is what I understand the United \r\nNations to be. \r\n The greatest impediment to the realization of this \r\nideal is the Arab-Israel conflict, which has been \r\nongoing for more than half a century. The fact that this \r\nproblem is still not resolved and that rights, law and \r\njustice have been sacrificed for the sake of political \r\nbalance is the greatest blow to the our sense of \r\ninternational justice.  \r\n To date, Israel has not complied with — and I \r\nemphasize this number — 89 binding resolutions of the \r\nSecurity Council. In addition, there are hundreds of \r\nresolutions adopted by the General Assembly — this \r\nvery body — that Israel has ignored. Even more \r\nregrettable is the fact that the United Nations has been \r\nhelpless to take a single step to end the human tragedy \r\nsuffered by the Palestinian people.  \r\n Therefore, I must ask is whether the United \r\nNations will fail to implement the sanctions it has \r\nimposed on other countries just as it has failed to \r\nimplement its resolutions concerning Israel. Will the \r\nUnited Nations assiduously follow through on the \r\nresolutions it has taken with regard to other places, for \r\nexample, the Sudan? We really do need to look at \r\nourselves in the mirror. \r\n This situation causes great indignation in the \r\ninternational community in general. Therefore, it \r\ncannot remain unresolved; the international community \r\nmust act urgently to heal this bleeding wound.  \r\n Israel readily uses phosphate bombs and \r\npossesses the atom bomb, and has endured no \r\nsanctions. But if even the hint of such a possibility \r\nemerges elsewhere in the region, efforts are made to \r\nsuppress it. I ask whether that is fair and just.  \r\n To be frank, the problem in this context is caused \r\nby the Israeli Government. Those who govern the \r\ncountry take steps every day that, instead of paving the \r\nway for peace, build new barriers to it. Thus, it is the \r\nPalestinian territories that are under occupation, not \r\nIsraeli territory. It is a contradiction of history to say \r\nthat it the occupied lands are Israeli territory. It is \r\nPalestinian territory that is under occupation. It is \r\nA/66/PV.15  \r\n \r\n11-50865 32 \r\n \r\nIsrael that uses disproportionate force. Once again, it is \r\nIsrael that does not abide by international will. \r\n In this context, the illegal settlements that are still \r\nbeing established in the occupied territories of \r\nPalestine, despite the calls of the international \r\ncommunity to stop, as well as the blockade on Gaza, \r\nstand out in particular.  \r\n I ask the Assembly; Does the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights allow for a country, \r\nsociety or people to be cut off from international \r\njustice? In my copy of the Universal Declaration of \r\nHuman Rights, I do not see such a possibility. If you \r\nwant to send a box of tomatoes to Palestine, you must \r\nget permission from Israel, and I do not think that is \r\nhumane.  \r\n As I have stated before, those who govern Israel \r\nmust make a choice. Loopholes in the United Nations \r\nsystem and lobbies in some countries may give Israel \r\nthe opportunity to evade international law and justice \r\nas it pursues its illegitimate actions. However, that will \r\nnot ensure — and I say this with emphasis — the \r\nsecurity that Israel needs today.  \r\n Those who govern Israel must see that real \r\nsecurity is possible only by building real peace. I \r\nwould like once again to remind Israel from this \r\nrostrum that nothing can substitute for peace. What we \r\nface today is not a simple equation of peace for \r\nsecurity. Israel must read the newly flourishing \r\npolitical and social landscape in the Middle East and \r\nunderstand that it will no longer be possible to carry on \r\nin environment of continuous strife and conflict.  \r\n If we, as the international community, believe \r\nthat the ideal of establishing international peace and \r\nsecurity is the founding principle of the United \r\nNations, then it is time pressure Israel to achieve \r\npeace, despite the actions of its leaders, and to show it \r\nclearly that it is not above the law. \r\n  One of the most important steps that need to be \r\ntaken in this regard is responding to the legitimate \r\ndemands of the Palestinian people to be recognized as \r\na State and to have the representatives of the State of \r\nPalestine take their well-deserved place in this \r\nAssembly as a Member of the United Nations. Indeed, \r\nin 1947 the United Nations, through resolution \r\n181 (II), declared Palestine a State, but unfortunately \r\nthat resolution was not implemented.  \r\n Turkey’s support for the recognition of the State \r\nof Palestine is unconditional. Turkey will continue to \r\nwork actively in the Middle East to ensure peace. We \r\nstand ready to do so. Accordingly, we will continue to \r\nwork actively for the resolution of the Arab-Israeli \r\nconflict, the recognition of the State of Palestine, the \r\nachievement of unity among Palestinians, and the \r\nlifting of the illegal blockade enforced against the \r\npeople of Gaza.  \r\n This commitment is a natural extension of our \r\nvision for regional peace and stability and our \r\ncommitment to international law and justice. It is also \r\nthe result of the responsibility we feel in this area. \r\nSimilarly, when a humanitarian aid convoy of \r\nparticipants from 33 countries was attacked by air and \r\nsea in international waters, resulting in the deaths of \r\nnine innocent civilians, we could not remain silent. Our \r\nreaction to Israel was a manifestation of our \r\nconviction.  \r\n Turkey has never pursued hostile and \r\nconfrontational policies against any State. Our foreign \r\npolicy is based on the principles of friendship and \r\ncooperation. Our policy towards Israel is no exception \r\nto these principles. However, Israel has seriously \r\nwronged a country and its people who have through \r\nhistory shown great friendship to it and its people. \r\nWhat we demand of Israel is clear. Israel must \r\napologize, pay compensation to the families of our \r\nmartyrs and lift the blockade on Gaza. Until Israel \r\nmeets these demands and takes steps in this direction, \r\nour position will not change.  \r\n Let me also emphasize from this rostrum that we \r\ndo not have a problem with the people of Israel. Our \r\nproblem arises from the aggressive policies of the \r\ncurrent Israeli Government. In fact, we have had very \r\nconstructive relations with previous Israeli \r\nGovernments, making great strides in a number of \r\nareas. Currently, the source of tension is solely the \r\nIsraeli Government.  \r\n Turkey is a country that is trustworthy in the \r\ninternational arena and whose friendship and \r\ncooperation are sought. We will not abandon this \r\nprincipled and determined policy. \r\n We are witnessing a historic process of \r\ntransformation and change in the Middle East. From \r\nthe very first day when these events began, we \r\nappealed to all administrations in the region to lend an \r\near to the calls of their people for democracy. The \r\n A/66/PV.15\r\n \r\n33 11-50865 \r\n \r\nultimate source of legitimacy for every Government is, \r\nabove all, the people and its will. What needs to be \r\ndone is to ensure that the people’s will is realized in a \r\nfree and open manner. \r\n We have also said that sovereignty derives from \r\nthe will of the people. Any sovereignty that does not \r\nrest on the will of the people is not legitimate. \r\nSovereignty does not allow any leader or any regime to \r\nrepress its own people or kill innocent civilians. A \r\nregime that points guns at its own people can have no \r\nsovereignty or legitimacy. Today, everyone must \r\nunderstand that times have changed. The era of \r\nGovernments that do not meet the legitimate needs and \r\nexpectations of their people and of administrations that \r\noppress and repress their people and fail to give the \r\nhighest priority to justice has come to an end.  \r\n This was the call we made. We are very pleased \r\nto see that our calls have been heeded in Egypt, Tunisia \r\nand Libya and have paved the way for democratic \r\ntransformation and transition on the basis of the \r\nlegitimate demands of the people in those countries. \r\nThis gives us hope for the future. We observe with \r\nregret, however, that some countries continue to stay \r\nbehind the curve of events and react with misguided \r\nreflexes owing to their outdated state of mind.  \r\n In that context, we are very closely following the \r\ndevelopments unfolding in Syria, which is our \r\nneighbour and therefore very important to Turkey. The \r\ncurrent situation in Syria gives us great cause for \r\nconcern. The actions of the Government are \r\nunacceptable and we have warned the Syrian \r\nleadership many times to that effect. We share a \r\n910-kilometre border. We have ties and relatives on \r\nboth sides of the border. We have always spoken the \r\ntruth, because we believe that friends always speak the \r\ntruth, no matter how bitter. We have always stated that \r\nthe voices, demands and wishes of the people must be \r\nheard. We have said that persecution and oppression \r\ncannot generate prosperity. We must listen to the call of \r\nthe people for democracy, not point guns at them.  \r\n Unfortunately, the Syrian leadership has \r\npersistently ignored our warnings. Now, every drop of \r\nblood spilled in the country only widens and deepens \r\nthe divide between the people and the administration of \r\nSyria. Turkey will continue to support the legitimate \r\nand democratic demands of the people of Syria and \r\nelsewhere, and to call on regimes to respect the wishes \r\nand expectations of their people. We expect the \r\ninternational community to do the same. \r\n  In that regard, we are increasing our cooperation \r\nwith Tunisia and Egypt. In Libya, Turkey has \r\nsupported the National Transitional Council from the \r\nvery beginning. We are very proud to announce that we \r\nwere the first country to restore its Ambassador to \r\nLibya. We will continue to staunchly support the new \r\nLibya as it resumes its well-deserved place in the \r\nUnited Nations as a democratic, united and \r\nindependent State.  \r\n During my visit to Libya last week, I went to \r\nTripoli, Tajura, Misurata and Benghazi, holding \r\nmeetings in all four cities. I met and spoke with the \r\npeople. I saw and sensed the righteous pride of the \r\nLibyan people in their revolution. I also witnessed the \r\ndestruction in Misurata.  \r\n I believe that the international community must \r\nbe very sensitive to certain issues in terms of Libya. \r\nFirst, Libya and its resources belong to the Libyans. As \r\ndemocracy is established in Libya, it is very important \r\nthat the country’s frozen assets abroad be released \r\nimmediately so that Libya can stand on its own two \r\nfeet. We want to ensure that the Libyans have the \r\nresources they really need. Currently, the country has \r\n$170 billion in assets abroad, but the people cannot \r\nbenefit from them. In that regard, it is essential to \r\nimplement resolution 2009 (2011). The Libyan people \r\ncan determine their own future and we must respect \r\ntheir choices.  \r\n A fair, comprehensive and lasting solution must \r\nbe found to the long-standing problem in Cyprus, \r\nwhich has persisted for more than half a century. The \r\nUnited Nations plan put forward in 2004 demonstrated \r\nthat the parameters of a solution are there, but that the \r\nGreek Cypriot side lacks the necessary will to make it \r\na reality. The Turkish Cypriot side, however, has still \r\nnot been freed from the isolation imposed upon it, even \r\nthough it has always expressed its full determination to \r\nfind a solution. Nevertheless, the Turkish Cypriot side \r\nhas remained committed to a peaceful solution and has \r\nparticipated with goodwill in the negotiations resumed \r\nunder United Nations auspices.  \r\n The objective is to finalize the negotiations by the \r\nend of this year and have the settlement plan endorsed \r\nin simultaneous referendums early next year, thus \r\nenabling a united new Cyprus to take its place in the \r\nEuropean Union without further delay. Turkey will \r\nA/66/PV.15  \r\n \r\n11-50865 34 \r\n \r\ncontinue to provide all necessary support so as to reach \r\na solution as soon as possible, in line with that \r\ntimetable. I wish to emphasize, however, that if the \r\nintransigent attitude of the Greek Cypriot side does not \r\npermit this to happen, as a guarantor country we will \r\nnot let the future of the Turkish Cypriots remain \r\nuncertain forever.  \r\n Moreover, at this critical juncture, we cannot \r\naccept any attempt by the Greek Cypriot side to act as \r\nif it were the sole representative of the Island or had \r\nthe authority to make decisions on behalf of the \r\nTurkish Cypriots. In that regard, the attempts of the \r\nGreek Cypriot side to unilaterally determine maritime \r\njurisdiction areas and to engage in exploration \r\nactivities in oil and natural gas fields are extremely \r\nirresponsible in terms of both timing and possible \r\noutcomes.  \r\n In the face of these unilateral activities of the \r\nGreek Cypriot side, which appear to be aimed at \r\nprovoking a crisis, Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot side \r\nwill act with common sense, but also will resolutely \r\nprotect their rights under international law. At this \r\npoint, we expect all concerned parties to work actively \r\nto ensure that the Greek Cypriot Administration halts \r\nthese activities, which could lead to tension, not only \r\non the Island, but also throughout the region. \r\nOtherwise, we will do whatever is necessary.  \r\n The illegitimate occupation of Azerbaijani \r\nterritories, which has been ongoing for many years, \r\nmust come to an end. It is unacceptable to allow the \r\nNagorny Karabakh conflict to remain unresolved to the \r\nextent that it is today.  \r\n All of us bear political and moral responsibility \r\nfor resolving international problems before they lead to \r\nstalemates. In that respect, more effective efforts must \r\nbe made to peacefully resolve the Kashmir conflict and \r\nmany other frozen disputes, which I will not enumerate \r\nhere. Conversely, peace and stability in the Balkans \r\ncan be achieved with the recognition of Kosovo’s \r\nindependence.  \r\n Turkey has always been a staunch supporter of \r\nthe principles and goals enshrined in the Charter of the  \r\n \r\nUnited Nations. I believe that we showed our \r\ncommitment in that respect during our tenure as a \r\nnon-permanent member of the Security Council in \r\n2009-2010. I also believe that our effective \r\nperformance at that time attests to what we intend to do \r\nif re-elected to the Security Council for 2015-2016. In \r\nthis regard, I to take this opportunity to reaffirm that \r\nwe count on the support of all the Members of the \r\nGeneral Assembly for Turkey’s candidacy to a \r\nnon-permanent seat in the Security Council for the \r\nterm 2015-2016. \r\n As yet another manifestation of our support for \r\nthe goals of the United Nations, we are also determined \r\nto pursue the Istanbul Programme of Action adopted at \r\nthe Fourth United Nations Conference on the Least \r\nDeveloped Countries, which Turkey hosted early this \r\nyear. We are also continuing our efforts to implement \r\nas soon as possible the announced package of \r\neconomic and technical cooperation for the least \r\ndeveloped countries. As part of that package, which \r\nincludes many areas of cooperation ranging from trade \r\nto education and agriculture to energy, we intend to \r\nprovide the least developed countries with annual \r\nassistance of $200 million. We also envisage increasing \r\nour direct investments in these countries to $5 billion \r\nand $12 billion by 2015 and 2020, respectively. \r\n We consider security, development and respect \r\nfor human rights to be integral parts of the same whole. \r\nTogether, they constitute the most fundamental \r\nguarantee of lasting peace. Turkey will continue to \r\nwork towards the attainment of these fundamental \r\nobjectives of the United Nations and make every effort \r\nto leave future generations a safer and more prosperous \r\nworld. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Turkey for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Turkey, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\n  The meeting rose at 3.15 p.m. \r\n"
