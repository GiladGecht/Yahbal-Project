(Qatar) \r\n \r\n \r\n  In the absence of the President, Mr. Zinsou \r\n(Benin), Vice-President, took the Chair.  \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 3.30 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Bronisław Komorowski, President of \r\nthe Republic of Poland \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nGeneral Assembly will now hear an address by the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Poland. \r\n Mr. Bronisław Komorowski, President of the \r\nRepublic of Poland, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Bronisław Komorowski, President of the Republic \r\nof Poland, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Komorowski (spoke in Polish; \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): At the \r\noutset, I would like to cordially congratulate Mr. Nassir \r\nAbdulaziz Al-Nasser of the State of Qatar on his \r\nelection to the post of President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-sixth session. I assure him of our \r\nfull support for his endeavours in that capacity. \r\n I am honoured to speak on behalf of my country \r\nat this session of the General Assembly and to be able \r\nto address in this historic place representatives of all \r\nthe countries of the world. Our participation at this \r\nsession is also an opportunity for dialogue, a chance to \r\nget acquainted with the problems of nations from \r\ndifferent regions of the world and to learn about their \r\nachievements and aspirations — and also their \r\nconcerns and fears. It is an opportunity for reflection \r\non how to deal with the challenges faced by \r\nhumankind — by all of us. \r\n I speak here on behalf of a country that over the \r\npast two decades has become a symbol of positive \r\nchange — change that required courage and hard work. \r\nAt the time of the collapse of the communist system, \r\nPoland was a country with a devastated State economy \r\nand an impoverished society. It was a country uncertain \r\nof its borders and its place in Europe. Thanks to deep \r\neconomic and political transformations, Poland has \r\nbecome a country that enjoys stable democracy and a \r\ndynamic economy. It has become a country that makes \r\nan important contribution to international relations in \r\nEurope and to security and stability in its immediate \r\nenvironment and beyond.  \r\n Since 2008, in the course of the financial crisis, \r\nthe Polish economy has maintained a positive growth \r\nrate. It is the only country in the European Union to do \r\nso. That was possible thanks to the work and the \r\nentrepreneurial spirit of the Polish people and thanks to \r\nsuccessive Governments’ courage in making difficult \r\ndecisions. \r\n In its foreign policy, Poland is building good-\r\nneighbourly relations with the countries of Central and \r\nEastern Europe, strengthening the security and unity of \r\nEurope. A hallmark of Polish foreign policy remains its \r\nsolidarity with nations that aspire to live in freedom \r\nbased on democracy and respect for human rights. That \r\nA/66/PV.16  \r\n \r\n11-50871 2 \r\n \r\nis an obligation derived from our national experience, \r\nthe experience of the non-violent struggle of the \r\nSolidarity trade union, which paved the way for \r\ndemocratic and economic transitions in the countries of \r\nthe former communist bloc.  \r\n We now stand ready to share our experience. That \r\nis our active and consistent approach in relation to the \r\nsocieties of Eastern Europe and, recently, in relation to \r\nthe societies of Arab States, some of which have taken \r\nup a challenge similar to ours 20 years ago. We wish \r\nthem luck, perseverance and courage, not only to fight \r\nfor change but also to conduct dialogue and \r\ncommunicate with all those who can take part in this \r\nprocess. From our Polish experience we know that \r\nsometimes the inability to communicate and reach \r\ncompromises and to overcome internal divisions — the \r\ninability to open oneself to dialogue with those who \r\njust recently were seen as enemies — hinders progress \r\nand can cause the failure of movements initiating \r\nmajor, necessary changes. \r\n Today I speak on behalf of the country that holds \r\nthe presidency of the Council of the European Union \r\n(EU). The Union has become in recent decades a \r\nlaboratory of huge positive developments in \r\ninternational life. The beginning of the integration \r\nprocess, with the creation of the European Coal and \r\nSteel Community 60 years ago, was a Copernican \r\nrevolution in international relations. A mechanism to \r\neffectively eliminate war between countries that \r\nseemed to be permanently in conflict with each other \r\nwas successfully introduced. Archenemies have \r\nbecome irreplaceable friends. The number of countries \r\nthat have opted for cooperation rather than conflict has \r\nbeen steadily growing.  \r\n That has given Europe an unprecedented long \r\nperiod of peace and enabled economic and social \r\ndevelopment not only in the sphere of the market but \r\nalso in the field of human rights and in equalizing the \r\nlevels of development. The European Union provides \r\nits members with security, stimulates their \r\ndevelopment and provides assistance to less developed \r\nregions and social groups. That is possible thanks to a \r\nprinciple of solidarity that goes beyond State borders. \r\n The European Union has introduced a new \r\nquality to international life globally. It stabilizes its \r\nneighbourhood and is an inspiration and a role model \r\nin various regions of the world, where integration \r\ninitiatives derive from the European experience. The \r\nEuropean Union is also an active participant in the \r\nprocess of shaping a better world order for everyone. \r\nThe progress that the world has experienced after the \r\nCold War in the fields of human rights, international \r\nsecurity and arms reductions, environmental \r\nprotection, sustainable development and many other \r\nareas is for the most part due to the initiatives and \r\ninvolvement of the European Union — as Mr. Herman \r\nVan Rompuy, the President of the European Council, \r\nsaid here earlier (see A/66/PV.15). \r\n I am convinced that not only will Europe’s \r\ncurrent difficulties — at the moment related to the \r\nfinancial standing of some of its member States — be \r\novercome but that the EU will actually emerge stronger \r\nfrom the crisis. I am also convinced that the European \r\nsocial model and the model of EU relations with the \r\noutside world will remain an important point of \r\nreference for other regions of the world. Poland, which \r\ncurrently holds the presidency of the Council of the \r\nEuropean Union, will spare no effort in ensuring that \r\nEurope remains committed to global affairs and can be \r\ncounted on, as always. Europe’s solidarity with the \r\nworld and its openness will remain our priority. \r\n The challenges facing the international \r\ncommunity are considerable. The past decade in \r\ninternational life has been turbulent and difficult. Its \r\nbeginning was marked by the tragic terrorist attacks \r\nhere in New York, on 11 September 2001. The spectre \r\nof global terrorism has hung over the world, in the fear \r\nthat terrorist organizations one day may make use of a \r\nweapon of mass destruction. Fortunately, our worst \r\nfears have not materialized and it has been possible to \r\nsignificantly reduce the terrorist threat. \r\n At the same time, the atmosphere of the war on \r\nterror has been a hindrance to fostering trust, \r\nstrengthening international stability and solving other \r\nimportant problems. In the past decade we have had to \r\ndeal with increasing tensions between rich and poor, \r\nand between more and less developed countries and \r\nregions of the world. There have been signs of cross-\r\ncultural mistrust. Climate change negotiations, the new \r\nWorld Trade Organization (WTO) trade round and \r\nnon-proliferation discussions are stalled. The Middle \r\nEast peace process is not advancing. In addition to \r\nthose negative trends, the international community was \r\nhit by the financial crisis in September 2008. \r\n We cannot ignore these disturbing phenomena \r\nand signals. Nonetheless, there is good reason to be \r\n A/66/PV.16\r\n \r\n3 11-50871 \r\n \r\noptimistic and to believe that we can overcome \r\ndifficulties and effectively face challenges. Hopes have \r\nbeen engendered by the economic growth that has been \r\nseen in many countries and regions that were once \r\nreferred to as underdeveloped countries or the third \r\nworld. Many countries have been able to seize the \r\nopportunities made available by globalization and give \r\ntheir societies prospects for development and \r\nprosperity. The responsible attitude of many \r\nGovernments, within the Group of 20 and beyond, \r\nprevented the financial turbulence of 2008 from \r\nescalating into an economic crisis similar to the Great \r\nDepression of 1929. Openness and interdependence \r\nprevailed over protectionism and economic \r\nnationalism. President Barack Obama’s initiatives to \r\nreduce nuclear arms and ensure their non-proliferation \r\nshould be viewed in a similar manner. \r\n The Arab Spring, notwithstanding the dramatic \r\nevents surrounding it, is yet another step in the \r\ntransition of countries in various regions of the world \r\ntowards democracy and the empowerment of \r\nindividuals and societies on the basis of respect for \r\ntheir aspirations to live in freedom and prosperity. \r\nThese are aspirations to a life that is in harmony with \r\nvalues and standards that are not — as they were \r\nconsidered to be until recently — exclusively Western. \r\nEveryone, everywhere, is entitled to embrace those \r\nvalues; however, it is necessary to respect the local \r\naspects and dimensions of these aspirations and rights, \r\nwhich cannot be separated from their cultural context. \r\n The path to solving key global problems \r\ninevitably leads us to the United Nations or its \r\nspecialized agencies. Not so long ago we faced the risk \r\nof a marginalizing of the United Nations, or even the \r\nbuilding of parallel structures. The United Nations, \r\nhowever, remains indispensable in its role, as defined \r\nin the Charter and the main United Nations documents, \r\nespecially those from the years 2000 and 2005. We in \r\nPoland combine optimism with realism, so we like the \r\ndescription of the United Nations that says that our \r\nOrganization was not created to take mankind to \r\nheaven, but to save humanity from hell. \r\n The Organization faces many tasks, whose aim is \r\nto protect the international community against crises \r\nand a decline at the international level. The United \r\nNations must defend the already achieved level of \r\ncivilized relations among nations, a key factor of which \r\nis the move away from violence towards the self-\r\ndetermination of nations, democracy and material \r\nprosperity. \r\n I see the main tasks of the Organization as falling \r\nwithin the framework adopted in the 2005 World \r\nSummit Outcome (resolution 60/1), which focused on \r\nthe triad of development, security and human rights. I \r\nam aware of the complexity and extent of the problems \r\nrelated to development, which encompass the issues of \r\ntrade, finance, economic growth, environmental \r\nprotection and development aid. I am aware of the \r\nlimitations of the United Nations in this area, where the \r\nmain instruments are in the hands of private entities — \r\ncorporations, banks, stock exchanges and investment \r\nfunds. The United Nations and its specialized agencies, \r\nthe Bretton Woods institutions and others have proved \r\nin the past how useful they are in this area. \r\n Today our Organization must ensure the effective \r\nprovision of aid to the poorest and to those in real \r\nneed. They are the ones that are hardest hit by the \r\ncrisis. Our responsibility is to limit the scourge of \r\nhunger in the world and help in combating pandemics \r\nand in providing access to drinking water. Without \r\nensuring a minimal subsistence level for people, as \r\nwell as health care and basic education, it is difficult to \r\nexpect the poorest and those in real need to begin to \r\nfend for themselves. \r\n We must agree on a new paradigm for global \r\neconomic trade. Global equilibrium requires that States \r\nwith a high surplus of exports over imports begin to \r\nswitch to growth, stimulated by internal consumption. \r\nIncidentally, it was domestic demand that saved Poland \r\nfrom the economic crisis following 2008. If we fail to \r\nbalance the relationship between these two groups of \r\neconomies — export- and import-oriented — there will \r\nbe more turbulence in the global system. Developing \r\ncountries must increasingly take responsibility for the \r\nglobal economy. This includes responsibility for the \r\nleast developed countries, which cannot be limited to \r\nimports, as this prevents the development of their own \r\nmanufacturing and export potential. United Nations \r\nagencies and entities not related to the Organization, \r\nsuch as the WTO, must assist in the evolution of this \r\nparadigm. \r\n The issue of international security, in both its \r\nbroader and narrower senses, requires a new approach. \r\nHere I shall confine myself to the latter. Poland has a \r\nstrong interest in progress in the reduction of nuclear \r\nand conventional arms. We are concerned about the \r\nA/66/PV.16  \r\n \r\n11-50871 4 \r\n \r\nprospect of returning to the arms race, as well as by the \r\nincrease in spending on armaments on a global scale. \r\nMore attention should be paid to the categories of \r\nweapons that today account for the most deaths. They \r\ncause conflicts, mainly internal, and they are the main \r\nfactors of instability in various regions of the world. It \r\nis from that perspective that we should reform the \r\nUnited Nations Conference on Disarmament. We fully \r\nsupport the efforts of the Secretary-General to that end. \r\n Security in a broad sense and respect for human \r\nrights and the various forms of a transition towards \r\ndemocracy, that is, ultimately building a lasting peace, \r\ndepends on the ability to communicate, to negotiate \r\nand to compromise. In that respect, the role of the \r\nUnited Nations is irreplaceable. The United Nations \r\nhas been, is and must remain the main forum and \r\ninstrument for international mediation. We in Poland \r\nand Europe know from our own experience the value \r\nof this way of resolving difficult social and political \r\nproblems. The Polish round table of 1989 paved the \r\nway for transformation in our part of Europe. I am \r\nconvinced of its usefulness in the process of the Arab \r\nSpring, particularly with respect to the difficult \r\nsituation that arose in Syria, a country of great Islamic \r\nculture and tradition. We are ready to share this \r\nexperience with the societies that would like to do so. \r\nMediation is an irreplaceable way to achieve lasting \r\nand just peace.  \r\n This also applies to solving very difficult \r\nproblems in the relations between Israel and its \r\nneighbours, especially with the Palestinian Authority. I \r\nurge the United Nations and the Secretary-General to \r\nactively use this means of building trust and peace \r\nbetween peoples, cultures and different social groups \r\nwho frequently, and for legitimate reasons, find \r\nthemselves in a situation of conflict or even war. \r\n The spirit of solidarity must permeate the activity \r\nof our Organization, which aims for peace, security, \r\ndevelopment and respect for human rights. Si vis \r\npacem para solidaritatem (A/55/PV.17, p. 32) are \r\nwords expressed here in 2001 by former Auschwitz \r\nprisoner and Polish Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nWladyslaw Bartoszewski. The spirit of solidarity has \r\nbeen the source of Polish success since 1989, and \r\ncontinues to be a value and source of strength for the \r\nentire European Union. Nevertheless, it also continues \r\nto be needed on a global scale at this time of openness \r\nand interdependence between countries, economies and \r\nsocieties. This requires an awareness of the unity of \r\nhumankind and a consciousness of the deep \r\ncommonality of interests among the members of the \r\ninternational community. The failure to respect this \r\nwill mean failure to effectively take on the challenges \r\nthe international community faces. In that regard, I \r\nhave only highlighted a few examples.  \r\n Finally, being here, I cannot resist recalling the \r\nimportant words of my great compatriot, Pope John \r\nPaul II. Speaking in the Hall in October 1995, he said:  \r\n “The answer to the fear which darkens human \r\nexistence at the end of the century is the common \r\neffort to build a civilization of love, founded on \r\nthe universal values of peace, solidarity, justice \r\nand liberty. And the soul of the civilization of \r\nlove is the culture of freedom: the freedom of \r\nindividuals and the freedom of nations, lived in \r\nself-giving solidarity and responsibility.” \r\n(A/50/PV.20, p. 6) \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Poland for the statement \r\nhe has just made. \r\n Mr. Bronisław Komorowski, President of the \r\nRepublic of Poland, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.  \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Mwai Kibaki, President of the \r\nRepublic of Kenya \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Kenya. \r\n Mr. Mwai Kibaki, President of the Republic of \r\nKenya, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Mwai Kibaki, President of the Republic of Kenya, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly.  \r\n President Kibaki: I take this opportunity to once \r\nagain congratulate the President on his election to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth \r\nsession. I am confident that his long years of \r\ndiplomatic service and experience will be crucial in \r\nsteering the work of this session to a complete success. \r\nAllow me to also congratulate His Excellency \r\n A/66/PV.16\r\n \r\n5 11-50871 \r\n \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon on his re-election to a \r\nsecond term. This demonstrates our collective trust and \r\nconfidence in his leadership. \r\n The twenty-first century presents us with new and \r\ncomplex security challenges arising, among other \r\nthings, from a range of political, economic, financial \r\nand environmental factors. This session of the General \r\nAssembly offers opportunities to address the \r\nchallenges that we face collectively. Most significant is \r\nthe promotion of mediation as a tool for conflict \r\nmanagement and the peaceful settlement of disputes \r\nbetween and within States.  \r\n In that context, the role of regional organizations \r\nin the mediation and resolution of conflicts is of \r\nincreasing importance. On the African continent, the \r\nAfrican Union (AU) and regional organizations such as \r\nthe East African Community and the Intergovernmental \r\nAuthority on Development (IGAD) continue to serve \r\nas significant building blocks in the search for global \r\npeace and security. As the Assembly is aware, IGAD is \r\nat the forefront of efforts to bring peace to Somalia and \r\nthe Sudan. I am pleased that Kenya’s role in both cases \r\nhas been, and remains, crucial. \r\n On 9 July, we witnessed the birth of a new nation, \r\nSouth Sudan. I wish to take this opportunity to \r\ncongratulate and welcome the Republic of South Sudan \r\nto the community of nations. The independence of \r\nSouth Sudan and its entry into the United Nations \r\nfamily is the result of intense negotiations under \r\nIGAD, safeguarded by the AU and the international \r\ncommunity. This success story exemplifies the \r\npotential of regional organizations to resolve complex \r\nand deep-rooted conflicts. I would like to reiterate \r\nKenya’s continued commitment to engage with both \r\nthe Sudan and South Sudan, through IGAD as well as \r\nbilaterally, in their efforts to resolve the outstanding \r\nissues under the just concluded Comprehensive Peace \r\nAgreement. I am confident that the leadership of both \r\nthe Sudan and South Sudan will continue to \r\ndemonstrate their commitment, courage and resolve in \r\nthat effort. We will also maintain active support for the \r\nAfrican Union High-level Implementation Panel on the \r\nSudan, led by former President Thabo Mbeki. \r\n The recent improvement in the security situation \r\nin Mogadishu gives us great optimism. This has been \r\nachieved through the concerted efforts of the \r\nTransitional Federal Government (TFG), supported by \r\nthe African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) and \r\nthe international community. The exit of Al-Shabaab \r\nfrom Mogadishu provides a unique window of \r\nopportunity for the international community to rally \r\nbehind Somalia and consolidate the gains made thus \r\nfar. I urge the United Nations and the international \r\ncommunity to seize the moment, support IGAD and \r\npartner with the TFG in the efforts to restore lasting \r\npeace and stability to Somalia.  \r\n As a first step, I call upon the international \r\ncommunity to enhance the mandate of AMISOM by \r\nproviding it with the necessary enablers and resources. \r\nOnly then can AMISOM have the required capacity to \r\nextend its coverage and control. In addition, we must \r\nsupport the TFG in the implementation of the Kampala \r\nAccord, which spells out a range of political processes \r\nnecessary for the attainment of sustainable peace and \r\ndevelopment in Somalia. \r\n The complex challenge of climate change \r\ncontinues to manifest itself in the Horn of Africa. As \r\nthe General Assembly is aware, the region is currently \r\nexperiencing the worst drought in 60 years. The \r\ndrought has resulted in a severe crisis that is affecting \r\nmore than 12 million people. The region is now \r\nsuffering from increased environmental stress, the loss \r\nof livelihoods and intense competition for scarce \r\nresources. Moreover, the situation has sometimes led to \r\narmed conflict among neighbouring communities. This \r\nreality requires us to enhance the regional capacity for \r\nearly warning systems and adequate response \r\narrangements. \r\n The scale of climate change and environmental \r\ndegradation calls for sustained action. In that regard, \r\nKenya hopes that the seventeenth session of the \r\nConference of Parties to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change, to be held \r\nin Durban, will deliver on African expectations in the \r\nform of support for adaptation measures. Furthermore, \r\nKenya believes that the international organizations \r\nworking on the environment will be streamlined and \r\ngiven sufficient support. In that regard, the \r\ntransformation of the United Nations Environment \r\nProgramme (UNEP) into a specialized United Nations \r\nagency, as recommended by the AU, will be of critical \r\nimportance. It is my hope that the Rio Summit \r\nscheduled for next year in Brazil will endorse this \r\nposition and upgrade UNEP accordingly. \r\n Finally, I cannot conclude my statement today \r\nwithout once again restating Kenya’s position on the \r\nA/66/PV.16  \r\n \r\n11-50871 6 \r\n \r\nissue of Palestine. Kenya believes in the two-State \r\nsolution where the territorial integrity of Palestine \r\nwithin the 1967 borders is upheld and the peace and \r\nsecurity of Israel are both assured and guaranteed. It is \r\ntherefore our hope that Palestine will be welcomed into \r\nthe community of nations with full membership in the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Kenya for the statement he \r\nhas just made. \r\n Mr. Mwai Kibaki, President of the Republic of \r\nKenya, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Mikheil Saakashvili, President \r\nof Georgia \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President of Georgia. \r\n Mr. Mikheil Saakashvili, President of Georgia, \r\nwas escorted into the General Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Mikheil Saakashvili, President of Georgia, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Saakashvili: It is of course a great \r\nhonour and a profound responsibility to address the \r\nsixty-sixth session of the General Assembly on behalf \r\nof my people. \r\n The United Nations is the international \r\ncommunity’s great legacy of the past century, an \r\ninstitution resulting both from history’s most \r\noutrageous crimes and from humankind’s capacity to \r\nconfront, reckon with and overcome the consequences \r\nof such crimes. Such human contradictions — “the \r\nhighest heaven and the deepest abyss”, to quote \r\nFriedrich Schelling — are symbolized by the two \r\nremarkable anniversaries we commemorate this year. I \r\nam surprised that no one in the Hall has mentioned that \r\nthis year marks the twentieth anniversary of the \r\ncollapse of the Soviet Union, which freed captive \r\nnations and emancipated oppressed peoples, unleashed \r\nthe dreams of millions, put an end to decades of cold \r\nwar and an apocalyptic nuclear race and heralded a \r\nnew era of international relations. It was clearly not, as \r\none nostalgic leader put it, the biggest geopolitical \r\ncatastrophe of the twentieth century. Nor was it, as \r\nsome analysts and diplomats dreamed, the end of \r\nhistory.  \r\n Ten years later, in this very city, another major \r\nevent took place, this time a real catastrophe. It \r\nreminded us in the most horrific way that history was \r\nnot over and that it remained tragic. On that terrible \r\nday, even those who had failed to pay heed to a decade \r\nof grim wars in the Balkans and the Caucasus, in \r\nAfrica and in Afghanistan, had to abandon their \r\nillusions that a new world order free of conflicts had \r\nemerged for good. \r\n The attacks on New York and Washington, D.C., \r\nwere not aimed at a single country, but instead targeted \r\na set of values and a way of life — freedom and \r\ndemocracy. That day, 11 September 2001, reminded us \r\nthat the world remained a true battlefield — a \r\nbattlefield not among religions, as many people claim, \r\nor of nations, but a battlefield within every religion, \r\nevery nation and every culture; a battlefield between \r\nthose who try to build and those who seek to destroy, \r\nbetween those who choose freedom and those who \r\npledge to eradicate it; a battlefield between nihilism \r\nand the very idea of civilization.  \r\n Ten years later, the remarkable upheavals in the \r\nArab world have offered us yet more proof that there is \r\nno end to history, nor is there a clash of civilizations. \r\nInstead, a universal call to freedom is rising even in \r\nplaces where some doubted it could ever rise. It is \r\nbeing met by a monstrous effort to quell it. As we \r\nspeak, the highest heaven and the deepest abyss are \r\nonce again in conflict. It is our duty as leaders to weigh \r\nin and speak out, to decide and to act. \r\n The first anniversary I evoked earlier — the fall \r\nof Soviet tyranny — continues to reverberate today in \r\nimportant ways. When the moment came 20 years ago \r\nfor us, the former subjects of the Soviet bureaucracy — \r\nstudents, artists, dissidents, workers, men and women, \r\nold and young — it was hardly the end of history; on \r\nthe contrary, it was a new beginning of history. \r\nCommunism had frozen our will in a cold and closed \r\nmuseum. When it collapsed, the doors of history swung \r\nopen again. We found ourselves confronted at once by \r\nboth the best and the worst. The best transpired for \r\nthose nations quickly integrated into the European \r\nUnion and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The \r\nothers — like the people of my country, Georgia — \r\n A/66/PV.16\r\n \r\n7 11-50871 \r\n \r\nwere left to the mercy of failed States, civil unrest, \r\nwars, ethnic cleansing and foreign occupation. \r\n Two years ago, from this very podium, I \r\nsuggested that there were two ways to leave \r\ncommunism behind and to re-enter history — the way \r\nof Vaclav Havel and the way of Slobodan Milošević, \r\nthe way of liberal democracy and tolerance, on one \r\nside, and the way of authoritarianism and ethnic \r\nnationalism, on the other. There are, in other words, \r\nmen who embrace freedom and men who erect mental \r\nand physical walls against it. \r\n To the latter, who still see the extension of the \r\nEuropean Union and NATO as a threat, I would like to \r\nsay that the Cold War ended in December 1991 and \r\nthat they should not be afraid of having democratic \r\nneighbours who wish to join wider democratic clubs. \r\nThere is no hidden agenda or secret plot in any of those \r\ncapitals to undermine the sovereignty of big nations. \r\nThe Cold War ended 20 years ago and, slowly — too \r\nslowly — new rules are emerging. And even those \r\nrules are still too rarely applied. \r\n Little by little, tyrants are beginning to fear that \r\nthey could one day be held accountable for their \r\ncrimes. I am convinced that there will be less and less \r\ntolerance for the ethnic cleansing and other war crimes \r\nthat have stained my country and so many others. That \r\nis the very reason for the existence as the United \r\nNations, is it not? The United Nations exists to make \r\nthe world a little better, to finally enforce the rules, \r\ncharters, laws and principles upon which we have all \r\ncome to agree. \r\n It is time to understand that the world has \r\nchanged and that an army, as powerful as it might \r\nseem, cannot ultimately deny the will of the people; \r\nthat a Government, as strong as it might look, cannot \r\nunilaterally and freely dismember sovereign nations; \r\nand that we are not in 1938 or in 1968, but in 2011. \r\n As I speak, the Russian Federation militarily \r\noccupies 20 per cent of sovereign Georgian territory, in \r\nviolation of international law and the 12 August 2008 \r\nceasefire agreement. As I speak, almost 500,000 \r\ninternally displaced persons and refugees in a country \r\nof less than 5 million people continue to suffer because \r\nthey are denied their right, a right reaffirmed over a \r\ndozen times by this very body, to return to their homes \r\nand villages. They cannot go back because, in Moscow, \r\na foreign leader has decided that their home is no \r\nlonger their home. \r\n To such cynicism and brutality we respond with \r\ncalls for justice and commitments to peace. Last year, \r\non 23 November, I addressed the European Parliament \r\nand solemnly pledged that Georgia would never use \r\nforce to liberate those of its regions currently occupied \r\nby the Russian Federation. Even though the United \r\nNations Charter gives us the authority to do so, as we \r\nwell know, we definitively renounced military means \r\nto restore our territorial integrity. The commitment I \r\nmade before the European Parliament is legally \r\nbinding; I have sent relevant letters to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations and to other \r\ninternational organizations. \r\n It will soon be one year since Georgia renounced \r\nthe use of force. One year has passed, and we are still \r\nwaiting for Russia’s leadership to reciprocate this \r\ngesture of peace. Unfortunately, instead of dialogue, \r\nthe response we have received has come in the form of \r\na dozen terrorist acts targeting Georgia, attacks directly \r\norganized and supervised by confirmed officers of the \r\nRussian secret services, which has been authenticated \r\nby different international actors. \r\n The Cold War is over, but some leaders have yet \r\nto realize that fact and stop reasoning in terms of \r\nspheres of influence, near-abroad domination and zero-\r\nsum games. The Cold War is over, but embargoes, \r\nblackmail and brutal diktats are still used against \r\nUkraine, Moldova and Belarus. The Cold War is over, \r\nbut even the Baltic States have to deal with \r\nmanipulation of their democratic political landscape \r\nand neo-colonial games with their minorities. The Cold \r\nWar is over, but the old Soviet habit of playing on \r\nethnic and religious hatreds is still alive. That is \r\nespecially true in the black hole that the North \r\nCaucasus has become, with brutal violence, \r\ndisplacement and the killing of hundreds of thousands \r\nof inhabitants. \r\n Georgia is responding to these brutal and \r\ndangerous policies by opening its borders, inviting \r\npeople to come to engage in exchange, debate and \r\ndialogue, by trying to overcome the information \r\nblockades, by trying to rebuild bridges between \r\nnations — those essential bridges that others are \r\nsystematically trying to destroy. Georgia is responding \r\nto military build-up with programmes to lift children \r\nout of poverty through access to modern technologies — \r\ncomputers, the Internet — and with new hotels and \r\nnew boulevards and cycling paths. Georgia is \r\nresponding to methods of the past by embracing the \r\nA/66/PV.16  \r\n \r\n11-50871 8 \r\n \r\npromises of the future, and many others as well — new \r\nhealth-care systems, hundreds of new hospitals, \r\nadvanced programmes to deal with communicable and \r\nnon-communicable diseases, and insurance for all. \r\n The end of the Cold War launched an era of \r\nopportunity and turbulence, liberating local dynamics \r\nin ways both tragic and exultant, and leading to a \r\nconstant flux in the world order. It has unleashed \r\nhatred, ethnic conflict, mass terror, genocide and many \r\nother human calamities. But it has also generated \r\nfantastic emancipations. \r\n Think of the “coloured” revolutions in Eastern \r\nEurope, the dazzling development of Asia, the progress \r\nof democracy in Africa or, more recently, the Arab \r\nSpring; none would have been possible if the Soviet \r\nUnion still existed as a global player and a global \r\nthreat to all the continents, including Africa, Asia and \r\nEurope alike. Since 1991, history has become more and \r\nmore unpredictable, swinging violently between the \r\nhighest heaven and the deepest abyss that Schelling \r\nreferred to. Indeed, who could have anticipated the \r\nglobal consequences of a desperate act by a 26-year-\r\nold Tunisian, Mohamed Bouazizi, in the remote town \r\nof Sidi Bouzid? \r\n One poor man, in an unknown place, was denied \r\nhis rights by an imperious police and, like a distant \r\necho of the Czech Jan Palach in front of the Russian \r\ntanks in 1968, he immolated himself. This breathtaking \r\nact of despair has literally turned the world upside \r\ndown. \r\n Some dictators are jailed or on the run; regimes \r\nconsidered untouchable have collapsed; new \r\nconstitutions and orders are being born. An entire \r\nregion and culture derogatorily labelled as unfit for \r\ndemocracy by some people in more developed \r\ncountries has given the whole world, including the \r\ndeveloped world, a lesson in freedom. \r\n Such historical eruptions always come as a \r\nsurprise. They require from us all the radical \r\nastonishment that Aristotle considered as the very \r\nbeginning of philosophy, the first step towards true \r\nwisdom and a radical emancipation from our prejudices \r\nand dogmas. \r\n Very few predicted the revolutions that swept \r\nacross Eastern and Central Europe in 1989, or the \r\n“coloured” revolutions that followed 15 years later. \r\nEven fewer predicted Tunis, Cairo, Benghazi and \r\nTripoli. The popular call for freedom that has shaken \r\nthe world in 2011 is the best and most definitive \r\nanswer to the hatred that motivated the attacks against \r\nthis very city 10 years ago. \r\n When aspiring populations are free to live their \r\nlives, practice their trades, raise their children, voice \r\ntheir ideas and press their grievances, the space for \r\nterrorists to recruit or demagogues to sow ethnic hatred \r\nstarts to evaporate.  \r\n International police, military and intelligence \r\ncooperation in the war against Al-Qaida over the past \r\ndecade have been, and still are, essential in protecting \r\nour freedoms. I am proud that Georgia has borne more \r\nthan its share in the international effort in Afghanistan. \r\nI am proud of our thousands of soldiers who risk \r\neverything in order to defeat the international \r\nmovement of hatred — and I want to pay tribute to \r\nthose who have died on the battlefield. I am proud of \r\nour police who are engaged in the struggle against \r\nnuclear trafficking. I am proud that Georgia has \r\nbecome a provider, not just a consumer, of \r\ninternational security. \r\n I am proud of all of this, but I am also very aware \r\nthat extremism will not be defeated and terrorism will \r\nnot be eradicated by military and police means alone. \r\nTerrorism and extremism can be defeated only if \r\nfreedom, democracy and prosperity extend their reach \r\nin the world. \r\n This is why we welcomed so genuinely the \r\nefforts of President Obama and President Rousseff in \r\nlaunching the Open Government Partnership. The \r\nworld has to respond to the universal call for freedom \r\nand justice, and only a coordinated response to this call \r\ncan guarantee our common long-term security. \r\n Georgia is ready and willing once again to take \r\non more than its share in this international effort. Our \r\nexperience of radical post-revolutionary transformation \r\nover the past eight years could very well be useful for \r\nthe newly liberated lands.  \r\n We were not always free. We were a totally failed \r\nState, a dying economy, a country destroyed by \r\ncorruption and authoritarian structures. In 2003, a \r\npeaceful, popular revolution brought to power a young \r\nteam of reformists. From one day to the next, we were \r\nin charge of a fragile country in a hostile geopolitical \r\nenvironment. We discovered quickly that the slogans, \r\nroses, flags and other tools we used as opposition and \r\n A/66/PV.16\r\n \r\n9 11-50871 \r\n \r\ncivil society leaders would no longer suffice. We \r\ndiscovered, in fact, that revolutions are not only, and \r\nnot even mainly, about the crowds gathered in the \r\nstreets, but that they consist essentially of the long and \r\ndifficult process of reform that follows the uprising. \r\n This is the main challenge that Tunisia, Egypt and \r\nLibya now face. The uplifting images of people \r\ncelebrating liberation in Tahrir Square, or Libyan \r\ncitizens dancing in Muammar Al-Qadhafi’s palaces, are \r\nalready in the past. The success of those revolutions \r\nwill depend on what happens after the legions of \r\nreporters from CNN, the BBC and Al-Jazeera have left. \r\n This is precisely the moment when our Georgian \r\nexperience — both successes and shortcomings — \r\ncould prove useful. Of course we hardly succeeded in \r\neverything, and we made many mistakes. But we have \r\nalso had astonishing results. \r\n In the aftermath of the Rose Revolution, we fired \r\n100 per cent of our entire police force. Georgia lived \r\nfor three months without a single policeman. \r\nAmazingly, during that period, crime rates went down \r\ndramatically. Why? Not only because the police were \r\nresponsible for a large part of our crime rate, but also \r\nbecause there was a shared feeling that our citizens \r\nfinally had a stake in their country and that they were \r\nliving actors in a very specific moment of our nation’s \r\nhistory — a moment when everything seemed possible, \r\nwhen values became the basis of politics and when one \r\nhad the feeling of inventing one’s own future. This \r\nfeeling is the true engine of history and our best ally \r\nagainst extremists. But it is a fragile feeling that has to \r\nbe nurtured and sustained. \r\n In Georgia, we have managed to keep this feeling \r\nalive until now by a permanent process of reform with \r\nclear benchmarks. Thanks to radical changes in our \r\npolice force, customs, tax service and bureaucratic \r\nstructures, and thanks to the widespread feeling among \r\npeople that they own these transformations, we have \r\nmade greater progress on Transparency International’s \r\nCorruption Perceptions Index since 2003 than any \r\nother State in the world. We are the second or third \r\nleast corrupt State in Europe, according to the \r\nEuropean Bank for Reconstruction and Development \r\n(EBRD) survey. \r\n We have built a highly favourable investment \r\nclimate based on efficiency, transparency and the rule \r\nof law. As a result, we are now ranked as one of the \r\neasiest places in the world to do business. The World \r\nBank ranked Georgia, based on five years of records, \r\nas the world’s number one economic reformer. No \r\nother country has progressed in that five-year period as \r\nwe did. We are ranked first in Eastern and Central \r\nEurope in terms of business, as I said, as one of the \r\neasiest places in the world. \r\n The 2011 EBRD survey on countries in transition \r\nsingles out Georgia as the most successful country in \r\nour region in terms of institution-building, on par with \r\ndeveloped European countries.  \r\n There is still a lot to be done, obviously. We are \r\nmore committed than ever to pursuing our path of \r\nreforms and to continuing to build our democracy, even \r\nas the barrels of hostile tanks point at us just \r\n40 kilometres away from our capital. \r\n Of course, the path to efficient democratic \r\nGovernment is difficult, but it is the only path. Of \r\ncourse, people will be impatient and disappointed, but \r\nthere is no alternative to the success of this call for \r\nfreedom. This is why it is so important to support this \r\ncall and to deter those who want to suppress it. \r\n This is why we supported the NATO-led \r\nintervention in Libya at the initiative of the United \r\nKingdom, France and the United States. The very fact \r\nthat the National Transitional Council is now sitting \r\nhere, in the Hall, and that Al-Qadhafi can no longer \r\nspeak from this rostrum should give hope for the future \r\nto all of us. The very fact that this effort was approved \r\nby the Security Council has shown that that institution \r\ncan actually be the essential framework for the defence \r\nof human rights. \r\n The two anniversaries we are marking — the \r\nanniversary of the fall of the Soviet empire and the \r\nanniversary of 9/11 — continue to confront us with this \r\ncentral question: how can we ensure that the new \r\nspaces that have opened in our world in the past \r\n20 years thanks to the fall of dictators and thanks to the \r\nspread of new technologies are filled by peace rather \r\nthan violence, by tolerance rather than extremism and \r\nby freedom rather than new forms of enslavement? \r\n History will judge our generation by how actively \r\nwe help to answer this question, particularly in a series \r\nof pivotal arenas, in what people call abusively frozen \r\nconflicts in and near my own region, in the many \r\ncountries in the international community that remain \r\nunder tyranny’s yoke and in the places like those Arab \r\nA/66/PV.16  \r\n \r\n11-50871 10 \r\n \r\nStates that have achieved a new spring of freedom and \r\nare starting the difficult work of reforms.  \r\n Wael Ghonim, the young Egyptian Google \r\nexecutive who helped connect and mobilize so many of \r\nhis country’s people to stand up for freedom, recently \r\nsaid that the new revolutions, like the one his country \r\nexperienced, are a little like Wikipedia: they are grand, \r\nopen projects to which everyone can contribute. \r\n The need for participation applies to us as well. \r\nAs national leaders and as key decision-makers, we can \r\ncontribute and we must contribute. Let us rise to that \r\nhistorical imperative. Let us all make our contribution, \r\nso that, together, we may avoid the deepest abyss and \r\nstrive instead for the highest heaven. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of Georgia for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\n Mr. Mikheil Saakashvili, President of Georgia, \r\nwas escorted from the General Assembly Hall.  \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Leonel Fernández Reyna, President \r\nof the Dominican Republic \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nGeneral Assembly will now hear an address by the \r\nPresident of the Dominican Republic. \r\n Mr. Leonel Fernández Reyna, President of the \r\nDominican Republic, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Leonel Fernández Reyna, President of the \r\nDominican Republic, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly. \r\n President Fernández Reyna (spoke in Spanish): \r\nWe extend our warmest congratulations to the \r\nAmbassador from Qatar, Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz \r\nAl-Nasser, on his recent election as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. We \r\nwelcome his intention to use this session to address \r\npressing issues such as mediation and conflict \r\nresolution, the reform of the United Nations system, \r\npreventing and responding to natural disasters and \r\nsustainable development for global prosperity. \r\n Ten years ago, the dynamic and vibrant city of \r\nNew York was shocked by something previously \r\ninconceivable: the terrorist attacks on the Twin Towers. \r\nThousands of innocent people died in horrific ways, \r\nleaving relatives and friends in a state of helplessness \r\nand sorrow. Echoes of that terror reverberated around \r\nthe planet, leaving scars and a trail of pain to this day. \r\nThe world has not been the same since then. \r\n In the interest of security, even in strong \r\ndemocracies where genuine rule of law prevails, some \r\nindividual liberties, previously considered sacred and \r\nimmutable, have been sacrificed. While the ashes were \r\nstill smouldering and the rubble of the Twin Towers \r\nstill lay where it fell, the war in Afghanistan was \r\nlaunched, which, although perhaps justified as a case \r\nof legitimate defence, has nevertheless produced more \r\nvictims than the terrorist attacks themselves. Then \r\ncame the occupation of Iraq, which spurred \r\ncontroversy in various circles of international public \r\nopinion but in any case certainly generated more \r\nviolence, produced new victims and new waves of \r\nhuman suffering and caused more destruction of \r\nwealth. \r\n The lesson to be learned from these past 10 years \r\nis that there must be a collective effort to eliminate \r\nterrorism as an inhuman practice, to eliminate as well \r\nthe economic, social, political, cultural, ideological and \r\nreligious factors that fuel it, and to promote a world \r\nthat is more open, more tolerant, more respectful and \r\nmore willing to engage in dialogue and in the \r\nrecognition of human dignity. \r\n Another event that has shaken the world during \r\nthe past decade has been the global financial crisis, \r\nproduced by a lack of clear rules in the international \r\nfinancial system, as well as by arrogance, greed and the \r\nunquenchable thirst for wealth. That crisis has gone \r\nthrough several stages, but at this moment what is most \r\nworrisome is that it has caused a division among the \r\nmost influential and powerful political and economic \r\nsectors in the world over strategies to fix it. While \r\nsome think that what is needed at this time is public-\r\nspending stimulus policies to promote economic \r\ngrowth and job creation, others emphasize reducing \r\nfiscal deficits and paying off sovereign debt. \r\n How can international capital markets now \r\ndemand that Governments pay a debt that was created, \r\nto a large extent, to save financial institutions from \r\ngoing under in the first place? Although incongruous, \r\n A/66/PV.16\r\n \r\n11 11-50871 \r\n \r\nthat is exactly what is taking place. Markets are \r\ncurrently putting pressure on States to pay sovereign \r\ndebts that were themselves essentially the result of \r\nearlier initiatives by States to rescue banks that were \r\neither at risk or on the brink of bankruptcy.  \r\n In order to avoid having to stop payments or \r\ndefaulting and watching their economies crumble \r\nfurther, Governments have had to give in to the \r\npressure of the markets by implementing severe \r\nausterity measures. Those policies have significantly \r\ndecreased citizens’ quality of life, leading to social \r\nunrest and protest movements that erode Governments’ \r\nlegitimacy and support base. Although it might seem \r\nparadoxical, in some developed countries loss of \r\npopular support has caused Governments to fall, \r\nwhich, in echoes of coups d’état, have led to a new \r\npolitical phenomenon that might be called, for lack of a \r\nbetter word, market “coups”. \r\n What is strange about this situation is that what \r\nwe need is resources to save the international financial \r\nsystem, stabilize the world economy and return us to \r\nour earlier levels of economic growth and prosperity — \r\nand those resources are at hand. For example, it is \r\nknown that even though $4 trillion circulate every day \r\naround the world in the form of financial transactions \r\nin capital markets, no taxes are in place that would \r\nincrease States’ fiscal resources.  \r\n How much would Governments collect through a \r\n5 per cent tax on the $4 trillion circulating daily around \r\nthe world? That would represent $20 billion per day, \r\nwhich, multiplied by five business days a week, would \r\ncome to a total of $100 billion. If, in turn, we multiply \r\nthat number by four weeks a month we would have \r\nmonthly income of $400 billion. And those $400 billion \r\nmonthly, multiplied by 12 months in a year, amount to \r\nan astronomical $4.8 trillion. That amount would not \r\nonly resolve the problems of some countries’ sovereign \r\ndebt but there would be enough fresh resources for \r\ninvesting, which would allow a rapid recovery from the \r\ncurrent financial and economic world crisis. \r\n Nonetheless, were we to conclude that this was \r\nnot an appropriate way for States to raise revenue, \r\nwhat about the more than 10 trillion dollars deposited \r\nin tax havens, according to reports by international \r\nadvisory institutions? \r\n As we know, not a cent from those deposits, \r\nwhich increase by more than 600 billion dollars every \r\nyear, reaches the tax services of any Government. \r\n In the meantime, through our failure to tax \r\ninternational financial transactions and the deposits \r\nmade in tax havens, the global financial and economic \r\ncrisis continues, citizens become indignant as they see \r\ntheir standard of living erode, social demonstrations \r\nmultiply, Governments are threatened by the lack of \r\ngovernance, chaos takes over societies, and uncertainty \r\nexpands everywhere. \r\n In sum, we are forced to accept increasingly \r\nalarming levels of social injustice because of the \r\nundeniable and uncontrollable power held by a circle \r\nof the world’s economic elite. \r\n Despite the wide range of global problems before \r\nus, I wish to address just one of them: financial \r\nspeculation on the price of food and oil. The \r\nDominican Republic will submit a draft resolution on \r\nthe subject to this Assembly General. \r\n Since 2005 there has been a steady increase in the \r\nprices of food and oil, along with that of petroleum \r\nby-products.  \r\n From 2006 to 2008, the price of soya beans has \r\nincreased 107 per cent; the price of corn, 125 per cent; \r\nrice, 127 per cent; and wheat, 136 per cent. \r\n According to the Food and Agriculture \r\nOrganization of the United Nations (FAO), as a result \r\nof those price increases, 150 million people joined \r\nthose around the world who already literally go hungry. \r\n As a result, for the first time in the history of \r\nhumankind, the total number of people who lack access \r\nto food surpassed 1 billion, which represents almost a \r\nsixth of the world population. \r\n With the recession that took place during the \r\nsecond half of 2008, food prices went down, and it was \r\nthought that we would return to a situation of \r\naccessible food prices and overall increased stability.  \r\n However, with the slight upturn and reactivation \r\nof the world economy in 2010, prices went up again, \r\nand this year the ravages of inflation have been felt \r\nonce again in different parts of the world. \r\n The same has happened with the price of oil. \r\nAfter falling to $12 a barrel in 1998, ten years later, in \r\nJuly 2008, two months before the bankruptcy of \r\nLehman Brothers, it was priced at $147 a barrel. \r\nA/66/PV.16  \r\n \r\n11-50871 12 \r\n \r\n Paradoxically, at the end of 2008, oil prices had \r\ndropped so precipitously that the new price on the \r\ninternational market was $37 a barrel. \r\n Who could possibly explain something as absurd \r\nas a price drop from $147 to $37 a barrel in just four \r\nmonths? \r\n It has been argued that, with regard to both food \r\nand oil, those exorbitant price increases can be \r\nexplained by the growth of the world population, an \r\nincrease in demand from emerging economies, \r\nespecially China and India, the effects of climate \r\nchange, and geo-political tensions in regions of the \r\nworld affected by conflict. \r\n There can be no doubt that some of those factors \r\nhave influenced prices to some extent, but there has \r\nalso been a clear effort to downplay the importance of \r\na new element in international markets: financial \r\nspeculation in commodity futures. \r\n According to well-known international analysts, \r\n30 to 40 per cent of the price increases for \r\ncommodities or basic products can be ascribed to the \r\nimpact or influence of financial speculation on futures \r\ncontracts. \r\n In light of that situation, which has a daily impact \r\non our food- and oil-importing people, the Dominican \r\nRepublic has weighed the need to propose regulatory \r\nmeasures of international scope in order to guarantee \r\nmarket transparency and price stability. \r\n To that end, it is essential to limit the volume of \r\ntransactions that may be executed by such futures \r\nmarket participants as insurance companies, investment \r\nbanks, pension funds and equity funds, among others, \r\nwhich play no direct part in the physical production of \r\nthe product. \r\n Likewise, deposits on futures contracts should be \r\nraised, as a way to discourage speculative transactions \r\nthat only contribute to price volatility and create \r\nuncertainty and a lack of market predictability. \r\n We believe that by adopting such a resolution we \r\nwill take an important step towards solving a serious \r\nproblem that has condemned a large part of humankind \r\nto hunger and destitution. \r\n In sum, the objective of this initiative is simple, \r\njust, and of far-reaching importance, namely, to \r\npersuade the Assembly General of the United Nations \r\nto declare, for the sake of the human race, that food \r\ncannot be considered a financial asset. \r\n Food must be used only to guarantee the survival \r\nof the human race on the face of the Earth. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Dominican Republic for the statement \r\nhe has just made. \r\n Mr. Lionel Fernández Reyna, President of the \r\nDominican Republic, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Ollanta Humala Tasso, President of \r\nthe Republic of Peru \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Peru. \r\n \r\n Mr. Ollanta Humala Tasso, President of the \r\nRepublic of Peru, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Ollanta Humala Tasso, President of the Republic of \r\nPeru, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Humala Tasso (spoke in Spanish): I \r\nwould first like to congratulate the President on his \r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-sixth session, and to assure him of Peru’s firm \r\nsupport in his task. \r\n I would also like to say how pleased I am to be \r\nspeaking to the world on behalf of the people of Peru \r\nfrom this rostrum that represents multilateralism, \r\npeace, solidarity and cooperation, the principles that \r\ninspired the birth of this Organization and that Peru \r\nfully supports. \r\n The Government I head began its administration \r\nonly a few weeks ago. Through the ballot box, the \r\npeople of Peru entrusted us with the task of making a \r\ngreat transformation, one that we have sought for a \r\ngood part of our history. We intend to make that \r\ncommitment a reality, out of a sense of responsibility \r\nand honour. Our mythical and vibrant nation, possessed \r\nof an extraordinary past and a vigorous present, \r\ndemands that we put an end to centuries of poverty and \r\n A/66/PV.16\r\n \r\n13 11-50871 \r\n \r\nexclusion. The great transformation is a process of \r\nsocial inclusion, that is to say, of converting the \r\neconomic growth that Peruvians have been \r\nexperiencing for the last 10 years into development; in \r\nother words, we must turn money into quality of life. \r\n Our ideal of the great transformation is as \r\nimpossible to relinquish as is our democratic faith. My \r\nGovernment proposes to deepen our democracy, so that \r\nwe can respond to the problems and needs of all, not \r\njust a minority. In other words, we will democratize \r\ndemocracy. Democracy is the basis of a people’s self-\r\ndetermination, and the State must be prepared to \r\nfaithfully carry out the people’s will. That is the \r\nfoundation of a sovereign democracy. In order to fulfil \r\nthat commitment, the State must be the institution \r\nresponsible for shaping the path to transformation \r\nthrough public policies in both the political and \r\neconomic spheres. The State must act in the interests of \r\nthe people. \r\n The United Nations is the greatest guarantee we \r\nhave for preserving peace, and it is made up of our \r\nStates. Today, however, we know that there are \r\ncompanies that have as much power as or greater \r\npower than many States, and that can react rapidly via \r\nthe networks of the Internet and the stock market to put \r\nStates themselves in the dock of the accused. That \r\nsituation must be taken into account in order to \r\nsafeguard State policies concerning issues such as the \r\npreservation of the environment, respect for peoples’ \r\nself-determination and the rights of indigenous \r\ncommunities and social minorities, among others. \r\n We cannot consider the possibility of \r\ntransformation outside the rule of law and its values. \r\nThis is not a question of copying others’ models. We \r\nwill govern by consensus, both at home and abroad, \r\nprotecting all our freedoms with tolerance and, above \r\nall, by listening to our citizens, without regard to class, \r\nrace or gender. When I took office I quoted Nelson \r\nMandela, who said that there is no democracy with \r\npoverty, and no democracy with social inequality. Our \r\nGovernment seeks a State that can regain the ability to \r\npromulgate policies that respond to the needs and \r\naspirations of all its citizens. It is in that spirit that we \r\nare renewing our commitment to the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. \r\n Latin America is the most unequal region in the \r\nworld. Its political class cannot say that the dream of \r\nthose who established our independence and founded \r\nthe republics of today, has come true. In most cases, \r\nvalues such as liberty, equality and fraternity were the \r\nbanners of our founders. However, extreme \r\ninterpretations of those values have led to a world of \r\ngreat confrontations, without really advancing liberty \r\nor equality. Let us now strengthen fraternity as a path \r\nto lasting peace. In that regard, I would like, from this \r\nrostrum, to take the opportunity to recognize the \r\nPalestinian State and its right to live in peace and \r\nharmony alongside other countries of the United \r\nNations. \r\n Today the integration of a geographically \r\nfragmented and scattered nation is possible, thanks to \r\nadvances in communications and physical \r\ninfrastructure. Social inclusion also demands quality \r\npublic services and equality of opportunity. Citizens \r\nneed access to health, education, housing, decent jobs \r\nand social security. We are talking about full \r\nintegration within Peruvian society. We are vigorously \r\npromoting exchanges between our communities, and \r\nwe acknowledge and seek to re-evaluate our diversity. \r\n We want a State that is responsive to the needs of \r\nits citizens and communities. That is its primary role. \r\nThe exploitation of non-renewable sovereign resources, \r\nwhich Peru is rich in, should serve the country’s \r\ndevelopment. Investment projects should respect both \r\nthe human and the natural environments in which they \r\ntake place. This is already being made clear to \r\ninvestors through a negotiation process that my \r\nGovernment has undertaken within the framework of \r\nthe rule of law. Thanks to those negotiations, the State \r\nand our communities will have greater resources \r\navailable for social investment projects. That will \r\nenable us to promote social cohesion and democratic \r\nstability, and, at the same time, the more favourable \r\ninvestment environment that the country needs. One of \r\nthe first measures we took was to enact a law on prior \r\nconsultation, through which we can respond to the \r\ndemands of our indigenous communities, involving \r\nthem in decisions that concern them. In that way we \r\nare affirming that every Peruvian is a first-class citizen, \r\nand we are fulfilling a commitment made by Peru in \r\ncompliance with Convention 169 of the International \r\nLabour Organization concerning indigenous and tribal \r\npeoples. \r\n Drug trafficking is one of the world’s most \r\nserious issues. It is essential that we recognize the fact \r\nthat this major problem has not been overcome; worse, \r\nits power and influence are growing every day. \r\nA/66/PV.16  \r\n \r\n11-50871 14 \r\n \r\nAcknowledging this reality is an important step, which \r\nwill enable us to re-establish an integrated policy, \r\nworking together with stakeholders and giving equal \r\nimportance to both controlling supply and reducing \r\ndemand. For Peru, these principles also involve States’ \r\nduty to act decisively and cooperatively in order to \r\ncombat every link in that criminal chain. Coca \r\nproduction is a source of income for tens of thousands \r\nof people who cannot always rely on a viable \r\nalternative for survival. My Government is working to \r\nachieve a situation in which anti-drug policies lead to \r\nthe eradication of illegal coca crops, and is also \r\nconsidering the need to include peasant farmers in \r\nalternative development programmes. Unless we do, \r\neradication will simply be insufficient to achieve our \r\nobjectives. We must act more vigorously in combating \r\nthe transnational criminal organizations that are the \r\nmain beneficiaries of this illegal trade. Those \r\norganizations employ thousands of people and exploit \r\nthe poverty and vulnerabilities of States in areas where \r\naccess is difficult. \r\n At the same time, we require greater financial \r\nknowledge in order to detect money-laundering \r\nactivities and more effective controls over supplies and \r\nprecursors. In the context of security, we must control \r\nthe supply of weapons that the cartels and criminal \r\ngangs use daily against citizens. \r\n In the second quarter of next year, we will \r\nconvene in Lima a meeting of ministers for foreign \r\naffairs, and heads of organizations responsible for \r\ncombating drugs in order to address these issues and \r\ndefine specific measures. My Government will spare \r\nno effort in combating the drug trade and organized \r\ncrime.  \r\n Peru is a multicultural country that is in the \r\nprocess of recognizing the wealth of its own diversity. \r\nFor example, our country today is undergoing a \r\ngastronomical revolution that has revealed that \r\ndiversity contributes to social inclusion and sustainable \r\ndevelopment. Peruvian cooking is an area in which all \r\nPeruvians — from the peasant and the cook to the \r\nfisherman and the tradesman — can participate \r\ntogether. It is based on a millennial dialogue among \r\nmany cultures — indigenous, African, European, Arab \r\nand Asian — that is represented today in our cuisine. \r\nFor that reason, we have called on UNESCO to \r\nrecognize Peruvian cooking as a representative element \r\nof the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.  \r\n Technological and scientific progress has grown \r\nexponentially over the past 50 years. Currently, \r\nhowever, there has been a parallel growth of global \r\nexclusion. This is seen not only in the lack of access to \r\ntechnology, but also in the mass migrations of people \r\nseeking better opportunities abroad. Those people, who \r\nare known as illegals, are in fact a bridge for \r\nintegration. However, in many cases the needs that \r\nmotivate them to move abroad lead to violations of \r\ntheir human rights. I take this opportunity to call for \r\nfairer and more dignified treatment for peoples who \r\ncontribute through their work to the economies of their \r\ncountries of origin and of residence. Their \r\nmarginalization this will push them into informal \r\neconomies run by mafias and criminal networks.  \r\n With respect to social inclusion, my Government \r\nis prioritizing the needs of the most fragile and \r\nvulnerable, such as children and the elderly. However, \r\nwe are also concerned with the need to protect the \r\nrights of women, who have historically been victims of \r\ndiscrimination. In this regard, I note the positive \r\ndecision to create UN-Women. We call on the \r\ninternational community to work together to promote \r\ngender equality and the empowerment of women. We \r\nalso reiterate our commitment to the Durban \r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action adopted at the \r\nWorld Conference against Racism, Racial \r\nDiscrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, \r\nwhose tenth anniversary we celebrate today. \r\n The effects of climate change and greenhouse gas \r\nemissions are being felt in the most vulnerable social \r\nsectors yet affect us all, rich and poor alike. In the \r\ncontext of the global attempt to preserve the planet, we \r\nmust all be committed. In Peru, we are working to \r\npromote the use of clean energy through reforestation, \r\nenvironmental education and recognition of the right of \r\nparticipation and access of communities that possess \r\ntraditional knowledge. That will require a large amount \r\nof resources and technology that are more abundant in \r\nthe northern hemisphere. Therefore, we reaffirm the \r\nprinciple of shared but differentiated responsibility \r\nbetween developed countries and developing countries. \r\nInternational cooperation must enhance the level of \r\nfinancial and technical assistance to mitigate the \r\neffects of climate change. \r\n Industrialized countries must assume and fulfil \r\nthe commitment to significantly reduce their carbon \r\nemissions. On 28 July in Lima, the Heads of States of \r\nthe Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) \r\n A/66/PV.16\r\n \r\n15 11-50871 \r\n \r\ncalled attention to the threats posed to our economies \r\nby situations that originated in the United States, \r\nEurope and Asia, linked to the high level of public debt \r\nand unemployment and the slow recovery of credit \r\nmarkets and investment. Of course, is the situation is \r\nalso due to military ambitions that have diverted vast \r\namounts of money that could have been used to prevent \r\nthese crises.  \r\n Latin American countries are learning how to \r\novercome our chronic vulnerability in the face of these \r\ncrises. We have decided to work together, coordinating \r\nour policies to enhance the economic underpinnings of \r\nour countries and the monitoring of our financial \r\nsystems. We have established the South American \r\nCouncil of Economy and Finance, reflecting our \r\ncapacity to encourage dialogue and establish consensus \r\nto the benefit of all.  \r\n Latin America will not be spared the problems \r\nthat have affected the North. We are making \r\npreparations. It is not enough to be linked to one \r\nanother; we must be united. The twenty-first century \r\nmay well be the moment for this part of the continent \r\nand its great market of more than 700 million people. \r\nOur commitment to integration, peace and regional \r\nprogress is not rhetorical. For the Peruvian \r\nGovernment, integration with our neighbouring \r\ncountries is a priority instrument for promoting \r\nsecurity and development for all throughout South \r\nAmerica and Latin America. This is in line with of the \r\naffirmation that the path to peace and reconciliation \r\nrequires an end to the blockade on Cuba.  \r\n As Víctor Andrés Belaúnde said on assuming the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly in 1959: \r\n “In centuries gone by, the arrogant will to power \r\nprevailed. Today mankind not only yearns to, but \r\nmust, live in a world ruled by justice.” (A/PV.795, \r\npara. 33) \r\n The interdependence of our societies is a fact. It \r\nis not necessary to create further divisions. When \r\nmaking decisions, we must learn to talk to one another \r\nand to involve the viewpoints of the many actors of the \r\ninternational system. Peru reasserts its full support for \r\nenlarging the Security Council to make it more \r\nrepresentative and enhance its legitimacy. \r\n It is urgent to also advance reform of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council in order to make it a \r\ngenuine, fundamental forum for the development of all \r\npeoples of the world. \r\n The priority we give to regional integration in no \r\nway implies that ours is closed regionalism. That \r\nwould be anachronistic in a globalized world. Although \r\nour foreign policy is based on brotherhood in South \r\nAmerica and Latin America, we will not neglect our \r\npolitical, trade and cooperation relations with other \r\nregions of the globe. On the contrary, our regionalism \r\nwill provide a platform to bring us closer, in a more \r\narticulated and proactive way, with other regions of the \r\nworld. \r\n Our participation in multilateral forums will \r\nincrease in coherence. Global political stability \r\nrequires intergovernmental organizations and strong \r\nregional groups that are capable of maintaining that \r\nmultipolar order that is emerging in our world. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Peru for the statement he \r\nhas just made. \r\n Mr. Ollanta Humala Tasso, President of the \r\nRepublic of Peru, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mrs. Dalia Grybauskaitė, President of \r\nthe Republic of Lithuania \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Lithuania. \r\n Mrs. Dalia Grybauskaitė, President of the \r\nRepublic of Lithuania, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations Her Excellency \r\nMrs. Dalia Grybauskaitė, President of the Republic of \r\nLithuania, and to invite her to address the Assembly. \r\n President Grybauskaitė: Twenty years ago, \r\nLithuania rejoined the international community of \r\nsovereign States and became a Member of the United \r\nNations. The unique experience of peaceful transition, \r\nState-building and reforms during the past 20 years has \r\nmade Lithuania stronger and more determined. History \r\nhas taught us that an honest broker at the national, \r\nA/66/PV.16  \r\n \r\n11-50871 16 \r\n \r\nbilateral or multilateral level is the key to solving \r\nalmost any problem.  \r\n In recent years, we have invested in building our \r\ncapacity to become such a broker. Lithuania has just \r\nconcluded its chairmanship of the Community of \r\nDemocracies. Today, we are proud to chair the \r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. I \r\nam also confident that Lithuania’s commitment to \r\neffective multilateralism and the fostering of dialogue \r\nand cooperation internationally makes it a deserving \r\ncandidate for non-permanent membership of the \r\nSecurity Council. We are ready and determined to run \r\nfor a non-permanent seat in the Security Council for \r\nthe 2014-15 term.  \r\n Meanwhile, looking forward to Lithuania’s \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh \r\nsession next year, I would like to assure members that \r\nwe will do our utmost to contribute effectively and \r\nwisely to the work and principles of the United Nations \r\nin all of its bodies. \r\n Just a few months ago, women leaders from all \r\nparts of the world met in Vilnius to share their \r\nexperiences in enhancing democracy worldwide. This \r\nevent, organized by Lithuania as Chair of the \r\nCommunity of Democracies, confirmed my belief that \r\nthe involvement of women in addressing common \r\nproblems and concerns is still very low. Therefore, \r\nLithuania strongly welcomed resolution 65/283 on \r\nstrengthening the role of mediation in the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes, conflict prevention and \r\nresolution, proposed by Finland and Turkey and \r\nadopted by the General Assembly. I am very pleased \r\nthat that resolution advocates the enhanced role of \r\nwomen in peace mediation. The full involvement of \r\nwomen in conflict resolution, peace talks and decisions \r\non post-conflict reconstruction is essential.  \r\n The same applies to the protection of women in \r\nconflict situations as defined in the historic Security \r\nCouncil resolution 1325 (2000) and related resolutions. \r\nI would like to announce that Lithuania has drawn up \r\nits first national action plan for implementing \r\nresolution 1325 (2000). \r\n We live in an era of constant change. The \r\nmaintenance and improvement of our ability to tackle \r\ntraditional crises must be supplemented with an \r\nincreased capacity of the United Nation to address such \r\nnew threats and challenges as energy security, \r\ncybercrime, food safety and climate change, to mention \r\nonly a few. I especially appreciate and would like to \r\nstress the importance of the Secretary-General’s strong \r\nengagement in nuclear safety and his call to build a \r\nstronger connection between nuclear safety and nuclear \r\nsecurity.  \r\n In the light of the world’s energy needs today, \r\nnuclear energy can be an essential element of \r\nsustainable global development, provided it is used \r\nwith necessary responsibility. I would like to draw the \r\nAssembly’s special attention to the word \r\n“responsibility”. Chernobyl and Fukushima are tragic \r\nexamples, but they teach us very important lessons. It \r\nis not enough to rely only on recommendations, \r\nproposals and encouragement for cooperation when we \r\ndeal with nuclear safety issues. I believe that our \r\nresponsibility is to create strict legal international \r\nimperatives. We cannot allow any compromises on \r\nsafety and security. \r\n In this respect, the efforts of the United Nations, \r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the \r\nEuropean Union and other organizations to ensure \r\nnuclear safety throughout the world are critically \r\nneeded today. Lithuania emphasizes the key role of the \r\nIAEA in this area. We welcome the ambitious nuclear \r\nsafety action plan that was adopted by the IAEA \r\nGeneral Conference in Vienna today.  \r\n Lithuania believes that strict adherence to \r\nuniform nuclear safety standards must be obligatory. \r\nSpecialized Agency missions for the entire nuclear \r\ncycle, including site evaluation and follow-up \r\nmissions, should also become an inseparable part of \r\nany nuclear power plant development. Each and every \r\nnuclear power plant, its site, nuclear technology and \r\neven the ability of the personnel to ensure safety \r\nmaintenance should be subject to stress tests. Last but \r\nnot least, information about all existing and planned \r\nnuclear projects must be absolutely transparent and \r\nopen to public access. \r\n We believe that the nuclear security summit in the \r\nRepublic of Korea next year will provide an excellent \r\nplatform for discussing nuclear safety and security \r\nissues for the whole world. With a view to that \r\nforthcoming summit, Lithuania is ready to contribute \r\nto the practical measures set forth in the 2010 Nuclear \r\nSecurity Summit Work Plan. \r\n The prevention of any type of crisis — be it a \r\nmilitary conflict, a nuclear accident or a terrorist \r\nattack — is a challenge for all of us. But it is also an \r\n A/66/PV.16\r\n \r\n17 11-50871 \r\n \r\nopportunity: an opportunity to strengthen the United \r\nNations leadership, an opportunity to intensify our \r\njoint work, an opportunity to promote dialogue and \r\nmediation, and even an opportunity to save resources \r\nthat can then be devoted to research and development, \r\nprotection of the environment and support for the most \r\nvulnerable. I invite us all to seize that opportunity for \r\nthe sake of our common safety, security and prosperity, \r\nwhich is what we all wish for. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Lithuania for the \r\nstatement she has just made. \r\n Mrs. Dalia Grybauskaitė, President of the \r\nRepublic of Lithuania, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.  \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Robert Mugabe, President of the \r\nRepublic of Zimbabwe \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Zimbabwe. \r\n Mr. Robert Mugabe, President of the Republic of \r\nZimbabwe, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Robert Mugabe, President of the Republic of \r\nZimbabwe, and to invite him to address the Assembly.  \r\n President Mugabe: I would like to take this \r\nopportunity to congratulate Mr. Al-Nasser on his \r\nelection as President of the sixty-sixth session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. My delegation is confident that \r\nunder his able leadership the General Assembly will \r\nsuccessfully address the pressing issues on the agenda \r\nof the current session. I also wish to pay tribute to his \r\npredecessor, Mr. Joseph Deiss, for having successfully \r\nsteered the proceedings of this House during the sixty-\r\nfifth session. \r\n I wish also to congratulate the Secretary-General, \r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon, on his reappointment for a second \r\nterm. We remain hopeful that the Secretary-General \r\nwill strive to shepherd the United Nations with an \r\nopen, transparent and inclusive multilateral approach. \r\nSuch an approach, I believe, would renew and revive \r\nthe hopes and expectations of developing countries in \r\nthe efficacy of this world body. Zimbabwe places its \r\nhopes in a United Nations that recognizes the equality \r\nof sovereign States as enshrined in the founding \r\nCharter. \r\n I want to express my heartfelt congratulations to \r\nthe Republic of South Sudan on its attainment of \r\nindependence and its subsequent admission as the \r\n193rd Member of the United Nations family. As we all \r\ncongratulate this new nation, Zimbabwe calls upon the \r\ninternational community to render all the necessary \r\nsupport to its Government and its people in tackling the \r\nnumerous development challenges that lie ahead of \r\nthem. Zimbabwe stands ready to make its modest \r\ncontribution to that end. \r\n The theme “The role of mediation in the \r\nsettlement of disputes by peaceful means” is most apt. \r\nBut how do we, the United Nations Members, measure \r\nup in relation to it in our activities here at the United \r\nNations and out there, in the real world? It is my \r\nprincipled view that we must be duty-and honour-\r\nbound to operationalize the principles upon which the \r\nCharter of the United Nations is based. We must not be \r\nguilty of manipulating the Charter to serve our \r\nparticular or sectional designs and ambitions. The \r\nCharter is our set of commandments that must be \r\nstrictly obeyed by each and every Member if \r\ninternational and regional peace is to be maintained.  \r\n We cannot honestly say today that this is the \r\nposition with regard to NATO States versus Libya. \r\nWhatever political disturbances might have first \r\noccurred in Benghazi, the process of mediation and \r\npeaceful negotiations was never given full play. It was \r\ndeliberately and blatantly excluded from positively \r\ninfluencing developments. There was quick resort to \r\ninvoking Chapter VII of the Charter, with a gross, \r\ndeliberate misinterpretation of the scope of the \r\nmandate originally given NATO to oversee and protect \r\ncivilians. \r\n Bilateral hatreds and quarrels or ulterior motives \r\nmust not be allowed to creep into the consideration of \r\nmatters pertaining to threats to international peace and \r\nsecurity, or even to the principle of the responsibility to \r\nprotect. \r\n We have yet to be convinced that the involvement \r\nof the mighty Powers in Libya’s affairs has not \r\nhindered the advent of the process of peace, democracy \r\nand prosperity in that sister African country. Our \r\nAfrican Union would never have presumed to impose a \r\nA/66/PV.16  \r\n \r\n11-50871 18 \r\n \r\nleadership on the fraternal people of Libya, as NATO \r\ncountries have illegally sought to do, and, in fact, have \r\ndone. At the very least, the African Union would have \r\nwished to join those principled members of this body \r\nwho preferred an immediate ceasefire and peaceful \r\ndialogue in Libya. The African Union was and remains \r\nfully seized of this crisis and will spare no effort in \r\nworking to fully complement the United Nations so \r\nthat peace may return to Libya and its tormented \r\npeople. We wish that process Godspeed. \r\n The newly minted principle of the responsibility \r\nto protect should not be twisted to provide cover for its \r\npremeditated abuse in violating the sacred international \r\nprinciple enshrined in the Charter of non-interference \r\nin the domestic affairs of States, because to do so \r\namounts to an act of aggression and causes the \r\ndestabilization of a sovereign State. Moreover, to \r\nselectively and arbitrarily apply that principle serves \r\nmerely to undermine its general acceptability. Indeed, \r\nmore than other States, all five permanent members of \r\nthe Security Council bear a huge responsibility in this \r\nregard for ensuring that their historical privilege is \r\nused more to protect the United Nations Charter than to \r\nbreach it, as is happening currently in Libya through \r\nthe blatantly illegal, brutal, callous and murderous \r\nNATO bombings. There we see NATO bombing places, \r\nseeking out, hunting and hounding the children of \r\nAl-Qadhafi. Have the alleged sins of the father now \r\nbeen visited on the sons? Have the children lost their \r\nright to life? They are no longer human beings; they \r\nare being hunted every day. Or is it because each of \r\nthem is no longer worth the price of a barrel of oil? \r\n After more than 20,000 NATO bombing sorties \r\nthat targeted Libyan towns, including Tripoli, there is \r\nnow an unbelievable and most disgraceful scramble by \r\nsome NATO countries for Libyan oil, indicating \r\nthereby that the real motive for their aggression against \r\nLibya was to control and own its abundant fuel \r\nresources. What a shame.  \r\n Yesterday, it was Iraq, and Bush and Blair were \r\nthe liars and aggressors as they made unfounded \r\nallegations of possession of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction. This time, it is the NATO countries that are \r\nthe liars and aggressors, as they make similarly \r\nunfounded allegations of destruction of civilian lives \r\nby Al-Qadhafi. \r\n When we in Zimbabwe sought to redress the ills \r\nof colonialism and racism by fully acquiring our \r\nnatural resources, mainly our land and minerals, we \r\nwere and still are subjected to unparalleled vilification \r\nand pernicious economic sanctions, the reasons — lies \r\nagain — alleged to be violations of the rule of law, \r\nhuman rights and democracy, which never, never \r\noccurred. My people have condemned these illegal \r\nsanctions, and recently more than two million \r\nprotesters’ signatures have demonstrated their \r\nantipathy for them. We thank the Southern Africa \r\nDevelopment Community (SADC) and the African \r\nUnion for supporting us and demanding the immediate \r\nremoval of the illegal sanctions. \r\n We in Africa are also duly concerned about the \r\nactivities of the International Criminal Court (ICC), \r\nwhich seems to exist only for alleged offenders from \r\nthe developing world, the majority of them Africans. A \r\nblind eye is routinely turned to leaders of the powerful \r\nWestern States guilty of international crimes, such as \r\nBush and Blair. Such selective justice has eroded the \r\ncredibility of the ICC on the African continent. \r\n My country continues to work with others for a \r\nrevitalized General Assembly. However, our ambitions \r\nextend to the need to reform the Security Council as \r\nwell. Africa’s call for at least two permanent seats on \r\nthe Security Council for its members has been constant \r\nfor decades. Africa cannot remain the only region \r\nwithout permanent membership in the Security \r\nCouncil. \r\n The current global economic crisis and the \r\nattendant financial crisis compounds the plight of the \r\nmost vulnerable, that is, the developing countries. The \r\npresent international economic and financial \r\narchitecture has to be reformed and made to respond \r\ntimeously to the real needs of all our peoples. The \r\nsituation challenges the ability of our developing world \r\nto achieve the Millennium Development Goals. \r\n As we celebrate the tenth anniversary of the \r\nDurban Declaration and Programme of Action against \r\nracism, xenophobia and other related social ills, let us \r\nall recommit ourselves to fighting and defeating these \r\nevils. \r\n My country fully supports the right of the gallant \r\npeople of Palestine to statehood and membership in the \r\nOrganization. The United Nations must become \r\ncredible by welcoming into its bosom all those whose \r\nright to attain sovereign independence and freedom \r\nfrom occupation and colonialism is legitimate. Let us \r\nall accept Palestine as a legitimate State and a Member \r\n A/66/PV.16\r\n \r\n19 11-50871 \r\n \r\nof this body. Similarly, the tormented people of the \r\nSahrawi Arab Democratic Republic must not be \r\nforgotten. We call for immediate progress in the \r\nengagements for a solution to their long-running saga. \r\n The Conference of the Parties to the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to \r\nbe held later this year, is a pivotal occasion from which \r\nwe should emerge with agreed measures to address \r\nmatters of climate change and how to mitigate threats \r\nto the very existence of small island States in \r\nparticular, and to the coastal regions of many heavily \r\npopulated nations. Zimbabwe will be fully engaged in \r\nthose negotiations. \r\n Let me reiterate my country’s full belief in the \r\naspirations enshrined in the Charter of the United \r\nNations. We must all resist any abuse to which it may \r\nbe exposed through the unwelcome behaviour of a few. \r\nMy country celebrates the UN-Women entity, as it \r\naddresses the position of more than half of humankind \r\nin all our countries. \r\n The African Union must not be undermined; \r\nrather, it should be allowed to complement the efforts \r\nof the United Nations for peace and security on the \r\ncontinent. Zimbabwe is a peaceful member of the \r\nAfrican Union, SADC, the Common Market for \r\nEastern and Southern Africa, the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement and many other international economic and \r\ntrade organizations, and thus desires to continue to play \r\nits part in creating a peaceful environment in the world. \r\nThe United Nations can count on the unqualified \r\nsupport of Zimbabwe as required, even if only in our \r\nmodest way. \r\n I wish the sixty-sixth session of the General \r\nAssembly every success. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Zimbabwe for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Robert Mugabe, President of the Republic of \r\nZimbabwe, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Desiré Delano Bouterse, President of \r\nthe Republic of Suriname \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nGeneral Assembly will now hear an address by the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Suriname. \r\n Mr. Desiré Delano Bouterse, President of the \r\nRepublic of Suriname, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Desiré Delano Bouterse, President of the Republic \r\nof Suriname, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly. \r\n President Bouterse: Allow me to join previous \r\nspeakers in congratulating Ambassador Nassir \r\nAbdulaziz Al-Nasser on his election as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. We \r\nwelcome his efforts to promote the goals of the United \r\nNations and to act as a bridge between the developed \r\nand the developing world. We pledge our full support \r\nand cooperation as he steers the work of this session. \r\n I would also like to thank Mr. Joseph Deiss for \r\nhaving guided us with much efficiency through the \r\nproceedings of the past session. We wish him well in \r\nhis future endeavours. To Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon, who has been elected once again at the helm \r\nof our Organization, we continue to extend our support \r\nand cooperation. \r\n We welcome our newest Member State, the \r\nRepublic of South Sudan, to the family of nations. \r\n The United Nations was founded on the \r\nfundamental belief that collective action can serve our \r\ncollective security. That steadfast principle is even \r\nmore essential in addressing the many challenges that \r\nthreaten world peace today. In Ambassador Al-Nasser’s \r\ninaugural statement as President, he referred to the \r\nenormous political, social, economic and \r\nenvironmental challenges facing the world (see \r\nA/65/PV.103).  \r\n I could not agree with him more. Pandemics such \r\nas AIDS, malaria and non-communicable diseases; \r\nthreats related to terrorism, weapons of mass \r\ndestruction, human trafficking, the illicit trade in and \r\nuse of small arms and light weapons and the illicit drug \r\ntrade; and the risks posed by climate change and the \r\ncontinuing vulnerability of our women and youth all \r\ncall upon us to deepen our cooperation and strengthen \r\nour international institutions. \r\n Although some citizens in developing countries \r\nenjoy good living standards, the realization of \r\nsustainable development in many of those countries \r\nA/66/PV.16  \r\n \r\n11-50871 20 \r\n \r\nremains unattainable. Achieving social justice for all \r\nrepresents the most basic humanitarian challenge of \r\nour times. In order to move the world further along the \r\npath of compassion, solidarity and shared \r\nresponsibility, that goal deserves our highest attention. \r\n As the world becomes more intertwined, the \r\nimpact of climate change in one country or region is \r\naffecting the prosperity and security of others as well. \r\nAs responsible citizens of this precious planet, we must \r\nstand united behind the collective goal to preserve our \r\nworld for current and future generations. Our \r\nunderstanding of climate change suggests that our \r\nplanet will undergo considerable changes over the next \r\n50 years, impacting all areas of society. \r\n For Suriname, with its low-lying coastline, that \r\nmeans a vulnerable exposure to a rising sea level, \r\nrisking inundation of our fertile soil and freshwater \r\nreservoirs. With 80 per cent of Suriname’s population \r\nliving in the coastal area, our ability to produce food \r\nand guarantee food security will be in serious jeopardy. \r\nFor countries such as ours, it is therefore of paramount \r\nimportance that the international community honour its \r\ncommitments, realize the speedy implementation of the \r\nCancún Agreements and honour its pledges to the \r\nSpecial Climate Change Fund and the Adaptation \r\nFund. \r\n We cannot afford for the upcoming United \r\nNations Climate Change Conference in Durban to fail \r\nto produce concrete agreements and targets on reducing \r\nemissions, which would lead to a halt or drastically \r\nreduce the rising temperature on the planet. We owe \r\nthat to our present and we owe that to our future \r\ngenerations. We call upon all parties concerned to \r\nreach an agreement. \r\n Suriname now stands at a crossroads in its efforts \r\nto attain sustainable development. We resolve to \r\npromote an investment-friendly environment, with \r\nprudent fiscal and monetary policies that are aimed at \r\nsecuring macroeconomic stability in the medium and \r\nlong terms. Allow me to outline the main objectives of \r\nour development strategy. We intend to maintain real \r\neconomic growth and raise per capita income, while \r\nsimultaneously promoting a more equitable income \r\ndistribution. We will further develop the mining sector \r\nas the engine of economic growth in the short and \r\nmedium terms. We plan to move away from a \r\ncommodity-based economy and focus on the \r\ndiversification of our economy and increased \r\ninvestment in other sectors, such as the agro-industry, \r\ntourism, services, transport, infrastructure and housing. \r\nWe will invest in our human capital, which is our most \r\nimportant resource. In that context, Suriname will \r\nstrengthen its national capacities to enhance our the \r\nutilization of our abundant natural resources for the \r\nbenefit of its people. \r\n We are well aware that we cannot move forward \r\nin isolation. We recognize the strategic interest of \r\ninternational cooperation to complement national \r\ndevelopment policies. In that process, we are strongly \r\ncommitted to the objectives of such regional \r\norganizations as the Caribbean Community and the \r\nUnion of South American Nations (UNASUR). \r\n Despite the current international financial \r\ncrisis — which is not of our making — Suriname’s \r\npresent economic outlook remains favourable. \r\nImproper management of the world crisis, however, \r\nwill have negative consequences on our economy. We \r\nare pleased with the UNASUR proposal for a complete \r\nrestructuring of the international financial system, with \r\nthe participation of all nations in the decision-making \r\nprocess. The time has come to bring an end to the \r\npractice of decision-making by only a few, which has \r\nhad disastrous consequences for the majority of the \r\npeoples of the world. For countries such as Suriname, \r\nwith small, open economies, it remains of vital \r\nimportance to continue on the path of prudent \r\nmacroeconomic policies and economic diversification. \r\n Since it is understood that sustainable \r\ndevelopment can be attained only in a safe \r\nenvironment, it is crucial to preserve international \r\npeace and security. Armed conflicts, interference in the \r\ndomestic affairs of States, terrorism and transnational \r\ncrime — including drug-related crime and the illegal \r\ntraffic in and use of small arms and light weapons — \r\nonly derail our efforts to address the challenges that we \r\nare faced with today. \r\n At the sixty-sixth session of the General \r\nAssembly, we are once again called on to reflect on the \r\nspirit of our Charter as it relates to the assurance of \r\ninternational peace, security and development. The \r\ntheme for this session, “The role of mediation in the \r\nsettlement of disputes by peaceful means”, is most \r\nfitting, since mediation can and should become one of \r\nthe most effective instruments in international conflict \r\nresolution. The failure to recognize and apply the \r\nprinciples of equity and justice in international \r\n A/66/PV.16\r\n \r\n21 11-50871 \r\n \r\nrelations has resulted in unacceptable situations. Those \r\nhave brought about extreme poverty, further \r\nmarginalization, increasingly brutal forms of \r\ncriminality and destruction of the environment. \r\n At the same time, we increasingly witness acts of \r\nwar and intervention in many parts of the world. Such \r\narmed conflicts are sometimes preceded by a mandate \r\nof our very own Security Council, with disregard for \r\nthe consequences of destruction, loss of life and human \r\nsuffering. Suriname wishes to draw urgent attention to \r\nthe stipulations of Article 33 in Chapter VI of the \r\nUnited Nations Charter, which in our opinion have not \r\nbeen consistently applied. That failure has resulted in \r\nan unnecessary continuation of violence on the African \r\ncontinent. \r\n I also express concern regarding the situation in \r\nSomalia, where severe famine has taken the lives of \r\ntens of thousands and continues to be a threat to \r\nthousands more. We must ask ourselves if the \r\narchitects of the acts of war on that same continent — \r\nunder the pretext of the protection of human rights — \r\ncould not better have used those precious resources in \r\nthe fight against famine. Furthermore, the Security \r\nCouncil should be a forum for dialogue and action, \r\nfully responsive to current and future global \r\nchallenges, and should not be permitted to bypass the \r\nefforts of regional institutions that aim to promote the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes. In particular, when \r\noutbursts of violence occur, peaceful efforts should \r\nnever be hindered or neglected. \r\n On a special note, it is of great concern that \r\napproximately 18 months after the disastrous \r\nearthquake in Haiti, the recovery efforts on that island \r\nnation are stagnating. We therefore call upon the \r\ninternational community to honour its pledges and \r\ncontinue to support the efforts of the Haitian people to \r\nreconstruct their homeland. \r\n Suriname reaffirms the right of the Palestinian \r\npeople to self-determination, including the right to an \r\nindependent State of Palestine, as endorsed by the \r\nGeneral Assembly in December 2010 (see resolution \r\n65/202). Suriname has responded to the plight of the \r\nPalestinian people and has taken the decision to \r\nrecognize Palestine as a sovereign State, worthy of \r\nbecoming a full-fledged Member of this world \r\nOrganization. \r\n We also reiterate our concern about the \r\npersistence of the imposition of the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo against Cuba. Those \r\nmeasures continue to cause hardship for the Cuban \r\npeople and to have adverse effects on the just \r\ndevelopment of that country. How many more \r\nresolutions need to be adopted before justice can be \r\ndone for the people of Cuba? Suriname once more calls \r\non the States Members of the United Nations to \r\nvehemently reject the unilaterally imposed embargo on \r\nthis nation. \r\n In closing, the provisions and the spirit enshrined \r\nin the Charter of the United Nations remain valid as an \r\ninstrument for promoting international peace, security \r\nand development. \r\n As Members, we have the moral obligation to \r\ncontinue to live up to the provisions of our Charter, \r\ntaking into consideration the demands of changing \r\ntimes in a changing world. \r\n We must, however, ensure that unity and justice \r\nreign among all nations. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Suriname for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Desiré Delano Bouterse, President of the \r\nRepublic of Suriname, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Ali Bongo Ondimba, President of the \r\nGabonese Republic \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Gabonese Republic. \r\n Mr. Ali Bongo Ondimba, President of the \r\nGabonese Republic, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Ali \r\nBongo Ondimba, President of the Gabonese Republic, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Bongo Ondimba (spoke in French): \r\nAllow me, first of all, to warmly congratulate the \r\nPresident on his election. His human qualities, along \r\nwith his experience, will be invaluable throughout this \r\nsixty-sixth session of the General Assembly. To his \r\npredecessor, His Excellency Joseph Deiss, I wish to \r\nA/66/PV.16  \r\n \r\n11-50871 22 \r\n \r\nexpress our gratitude for his extremely skilful \r\npresidency. I also take this opportunity to congratulate \r\nthe Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ban \r\nKi-moon, on his unanimous re-election, and reiterate \r\nGabon’s full confidence in him. \r\n Allow me to recall that Gabon has always striven \r\nto contribute to peace and the peaceful settlement of \r\nconflicts through dialogue and mediation. We firmly \r\nbelieve in the link between peace and security, on the \r\none hand, and development and democracy, on the \r\nother. Because the people of Gabon enjoy peace at \r\nhome, as well as with their neighbours and the world as \r\na whole, we are able to achieve new development \r\ngoals. \r\n This firm belief, which I proposed to my \r\ncompatriots when I was elected as head of \r\nGovernment, lies at the heart of Gabon’s future vision \r\nfor development. Since my last statement before the \r\nGeneral Assembly a year ago, my Government has \r\nmoved to take action. We are humbled by the scale of \r\nthe task and the time required to ensure further \r\nprogress. \r\n We are already building strategic infrastructure, \r\nincluding preparations for the African Cup of Nations, \r\nwhich Gabon will host in 2012 together with \r\nEquatorial Guinea. We are also moving forward with \r\nindustrial processing projects, beginning with wood, \r\nmanganese and gas. In addition, we are also making \r\nprogress with policies to support the service sector. In \r\nterms of agriculture, we intend to develop agro-industries, \r\nand to support food production and sustainable fishing, \r\nwhich are both so valuable for our food security. \r\n Finally, we are working on a daily basis to \r\nimplement our steadfast commitment to sustainable \r\ndevelopment in the context of a green Gabon. \r\n With regard to international peace and security in \r\nAfrica and throughout the world, Gabon has reiterated \r\nits commitment and has contributed according to its \r\nmeans. Since 2010, we have had a non-permanent seat \r\non the Security Council. Last June, Gabon held the \r\nPresidency of that body, a role that we discharged with \r\nresponsibility and commitment. \r\n Turning to Côte d’Ivoire, Gabon has endorsed the \r\nactions taken by the United Nations, aimed at \r\nrespecting the will of the Ivorian people and ensuring \r\nthe return to a peaceful political environment. We must \r\nnow support the efforts of the new Government to \r\nachieve national reconciliation and reconstruction in \r\nour sister country. \r\n With regard to Libya, Gabon has recognized the \r\nNational Transitional Council and welcomes Libya’s \r\nreturn to the African Union and to the international \r\ncommunity at the United Nations. In the Security \r\nCouncil, along with the other two African members, we \r\napproved resolution 1973 (2011). It was incumbent on \r\nthe international community to prevent the bloodbath \r\nthat threatened to take place in Benghazi. We also \r\nneeded to cut short a conflict that posed great danger to \r\nthe civilian population. Today, it is important that \r\nLibya emerge from this crisis in order to begin \r\nreconciliation for all Libyans and the reconstruction of \r\nthe country. It is with this aim in mind that we took \r\npart in the conference of friends of Libya in Paris. We \r\nwelcome the role played by the United Nations. It is \r\nimportant to work together with the African Union and \r\nother stakeholders. We are ready to contribute to the \r\nefforts of the international community in Libya. \r\n South Sudan has also joined the international \r\ncommunity. Gabon congratulates the authorities of that \r\nnewborn sister country and assures it of our support. \r\nWe welcome the clear determination of Sudan and \r\nSouth Sudan to seek a peaceful way to settle their post-\r\nreferendum issues. \r\n In Somalia, we must act resolutely because of the \r\nserious and urgent nature of the situation. Everything \r\nmust be done to deliver humanitarian aid to those who \r\nneed it in the towns and villages in Somalia itself. \r\nGabon responded to the appeal of the international \r\ncommunity and has made a contribution. \r\n The issue of Palestine affects us all, so far-\r\nreaching are its implications for peace in the Middle \r\nEast and throughout the world. It is important to stress \r\nthat we all share the goal, which is the existence of two \r\nStates, Palestine and Israel. On this question, I wish to \r\nexpress my desire, as I did here in this Hall last year \r\nand do this year with even greater hope, namely, to see \r\nsoon a Palestinian State that exists in peace alongside \r\nIsrael, within secure and recognized borders. The \r\nIsraeli and Palestinian peoples, both friends of Gabon, \r\naspire to live in peace and security. The peaceful future \r\nof these two peoples is essential for the future of the \r\nMiddle East and for peace in the world. \r\n Syria represents a new situation that requires \r\nefforts on all our parts. We hope that the Arab League’s \r\n A/66/PV.16\r\n \r\n23 11-50871 \r\n \r\nmediation efforts will ensure a peaceful and democratic \r\noutcome as a matter of urgency. \r\n Gabon will be particularly attentive to the priority \r\nissues throughout this sixty-sixth session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. Gabon is, of course, in favour of \r\nreform of the Security Council and reform of the \r\nUnited Nations system in general. We must enable our \r\nOrganization to better discharge its mission of peace, \r\ncooperation and justice throughout the world.  \r\n Africa should, in a manner that remains to be \r\ndetermined, have a permanent seat in the Security \r\nCouncil. Africa’s voice must be heard more on the \r\ninternational stage. This expectation on the part of \r\nAfrica and even other regions of the world is part of \r\nour aspirations for a true democratization of global \r\npolitical and economic governance.  \r\n As you know, Gabon is fully committed, \r\nincluding within the framework of the United Nations, \r\nto protecting the environment and combating global \r\nwarming. Since I assumed the highest office in my \r\ncountry, Gabon has taken major steps to reduce its \r\ncarbon dioxide emissions and to increase the carbon \r\nsequestration rate of our forests. My Government has \r\ncommitted itself to modern ways of preserving our \r\ntropical forests and biodiversity within our 13 national \r\nparks, which cover a little more than 11 per cent of our \r\nterritory. Gabon has thus launched an extensive \r\ncampaign to prevent the pillaging of its natural \r\nresources and the poaching of its protected species. We \r\nare striving to develop our timber industry, while \r\npreserving the ecological wealth of our immense \r\ntropical forest.  \r\n We should also recall that the issues of the \r\nenvironment and international security will face us in \r\nthe future. At the coming United Nations Climate \r\nChange Conference in Durban, in South Africa, we will \r\nhave to deal with that complex of issues in our work \r\nand bear in mind the link that exists between the \r\nenvironment and international security.  \r\n Finally, we are closely following the efforts under \r\nway to delineate the limits of the continental shelf. \r\nGiven the potential of undersea resources, we should \r\nensure that their future exploitation does not lead to \r\nnatural disasters. \r\n Gabon is concerned by the impact of the \r\neconomic crisis on countries of the South, particularly \r\nin terms of achieving the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. The impact of the international financial crisis \r\non public investment in basic social sectors, such as \r\neducation, health and the provision of drinking water \r\nand electricity, is constraining our efforts to promote \r\nhuman development.  \r\n Despite significant progress in implementing the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, the deadline of 2015 \r\nremains for many countries, including Gabon, a \r\ndifficult challenge to meet. The Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals cannot be achieved unless \r\nadditional funds are mobilized before 2015. \r\nDevelopment assistance is stagnating, and I see real \r\nconcern as a result of the situation. The international \r\ncommunity must make an effort to live up to the \r\ncommitments it agreed to in Monterey, Doha, \r\nGleneagles, Paris and Accra. We need a new global \r\npartnership for development to ensure lasting economic \r\ngrowth in our countries. Aid should be accompanied by \r\nmore direct investment and more fair and equitable \r\ntrade. To mobilize new resources, we encourage and \r\nsupport the efforts under way aimed at \r\ninstitutionalizing innovative mechanisms for funding \r\ndevelopment. \r\n The President of the General Assembly has asked \r\nus to discuss the issue of mediation. This issue is at the \r\nheart of the very raison d’être of our Organization, \r\nwhich is to guarantee peace and security throughout \r\nthe world.  \r\n Mediation and conflict prevention must remain \r\nour primary means of collective action. We all feel the \r\nneed, in a complex world, to achieve greater \r\ndemocracy, a world where economic and cultural \r\nexchanges are better balanced and where crisis \r\nprevention, whether it be of political or other crises, is \r\nbetter organized, with, in particular, better early \r\nwarning systems and mediation.  \r\n Gabon is historically attached to mediation and to \r\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes. This approach has \r\nalways been one of the bases of our relations with our \r\nneighbouring and brotherly countries in the Central \r\nAfrican subregion and has played a part in our \r\ncontribution to the resolution of conflicts in Africa. My \r\ncountry will never depart from that path, in particular \r\nat the very moment when Africa is striving to achieve \r\npolitical and economic integration.  \r\n Our commitment to the peaceful settlement of \r\nconflicts is also part of the commitments that we have \r\nundertaken under a number of conventions and treaties \r\nA/66/PV.16  \r\n \r\n11-50871 24 \r\n \r\non human rights, humanitarian law, the promotion of \r\ndemocracy and the rule of law, and international \r\ncooperation and solidarity.  \r\n We are well aware that mediation has its limits, \r\nand the international community must always be ready, \r\nif necessary, to consider other ways of ensuring \r\nconflict prevention and conflict resolution. Conflicts \r\nwill be more complex and multidimensional in the \r\nfuture. Economic crises, environmental crises and \r\naspirations for democracy and freedoms, which are \r\ntaking on new forms, will worsen tensions, and we \r\nmust follow these developments closely. \r\n Gabon will continue to support and contribute to \r\nthe mediation efforts and good offices of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on several different fronts and in the various \r\nareas of the world where there are conflicts. Those \r\nefforts are essential. They must be enhanced by \r\nincreased resources and be carried out in an impartial \r\nway, with full respect for the sovereignty of States. It \r\nshould also be said that the participation of women is \r\nimportant in all aspects of mediation, since they are \r\nalways the first victims of conflicts, along with \r\nchildren.  \r\n Finally, the United Nations must enhance its \r\ncooperation with all the other actors playing a role in \r\nthis area. In Africa, the African Union, which continues \r\nto enhance its mediation capacities, is an essential \r\nplayer. \r\n I would like to conclude by recalling the motto of \r\nmy vision for our society aimed at making Gabon an \r\nemerging country: peace, development and sharing. \r\nThe climate of peace and stability that Gabon is now \r\nenjoying will be invaluable as our country enters a new \r\nphase of rapid modernization. More than ever before, \r\nGabon wishes to cooperate with other countries. We \r\nare deeply committed to peace. The people of Gabon \r\nare therefore ready to exchange, create and build with \r\nthe rest of the world. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Gabonese Republic for the statement \r\nhe has just made. \r\n Mr. Ali Bongo Ondimba, President of the \r\nGabonese Republic, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.  \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Joseph Kabila Kabange, President of \r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo. \r\n Mr. Joseph Kabila Kabange, President of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, was escorted \r\ninto the General Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Joseph Kabila Kabange, President of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly.  \r\n President Kabila Kabange (spoke in French): \r\nAllow me, at the outset, to commend the President of \r\nthe General Assembly and his whole team for their \r\nelection to the Bureau of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-sixth session. We would like to express to his \r\npredecessor, Mr. Joseph Deiss, our gratitude for the \r\nexcellent work he accomplished, work that has \r\nbenefited our Organization. I also congratulate Mr. Ban \r\nKi-moon, the Secretary-General, on the renewal of his \r\nmandate. \r\n Taking the floor from this rostrum has always \r\nbeen for me a special moment and a happy occasion to \r\nrecall some current issues of importance to my country \r\nand the world. This moment is all the more special as it \r\ncomes at a time when the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo is preparing to hold general elections, the \r\nsecond since those of 2006. \r\n Thus, it is appropriate to grasp the full \r\nsignificance of this key period for the Congo, because \r\nit confirms a definitive break from the spiral of \r\nviolence and instability that has characterized the \r\ncountry in recent decades. It is seen as a decisive phase \r\nin that, more than ever, it commits the Congolese \r\npeople to a lasting democratic culture.  \r\n Despite multifaceted challenges punctuating the \r\nelectoral process, the National Independent Electoral \r\nCommission, our people and their Government are \r\ndoing their utmost to hold transparent and credible \r\nelections in a calm climate. The elections are \r\nultimately proof of a return to the effective peace for \r\nwhich Congolese men and women have yearned. \r\nToday, peace and security reign throughout the national \r\n A/66/PV.16\r\n \r\n25 11-50871 \r\n \r\nterritory. The Republic’s institutions are all in place \r\nand operating normally. \r\n As peace and security in my country have been \r\nrecovered, the United Nations presence merits \r\nreconsideration. Indeed, the role of the United Nations \r\nOrganization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo (MONUSCO) must necessarily \r\nadapt its vision and its action on the ground. In that \r\nphase of consolidation, MONUSCO must increasingly \r\nmove beyond the strict format of peacekeeping \r\noperations in order to assist the country in its efforts to \r\ndevelop and to relaunch the economy. \r\n Enormous progress has certainly been made in \r\nthe areas of peace and security. However, many other \r\nchallenges remain, and the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo is determined to meet them. The mobilization \r\nand support of all should be along those lines. I refer in \r\nparticular to the following areas of concerns: \r\nstrengthening the capacity of the security sector, the \r\narmy, the police, the judiciary and penitentiary systems \r\nto ensure the rights and security of citizens and to \r\nstabilize the country and the region; the increasing and \r\norderly return of displaced persons to their places of \r\norigin and of refugees to their respective countries; the \r\nongoing demobilization and reintegration of child \r\nsoldiers leaving armed groups; effective control over \r\nthe exploitation of our natural resources; and building \r\ngood-neighbourly relations with the States around us.  \r\n In that regard, after several years of conflict the \r\ncountries in the region have reached the conclusion \r\nthat war is the worst enemy of man and his \r\ndevelopment. It exacerbates problems rather than \r\nresolves them. That explains their common will and \r\nour efforts to seek peace at all costs. That is the reality \r\ntoday. The Democratic Republic of the Congo is at \r\npeace with all its neighbours. Now is the time for \r\nreconstruction and development. \r\n In that regard, I would like to welcome the recent \r\nentry of the Republic of South Sudan as a Member \r\nState of our universal Organization and to convey to its \r\npeople my most heartfelt wishes for peace, happiness \r\nand prosperity. \r\n Another challenge that my country must face is \r\nthat of maintaining economic growth. Despite a \r\ndifficult international climate, today the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo shows a positive growth rate \r\nabove the African average, and it will continue that \r\nmomentum thanks to the efforts to harness its \r\neconomy. However, it is also true that such growth \r\nremains dependent, to a large degree, on the global \r\neconomy. \r\n Having spoken about the situation in my country, \r\nI would now like to address some big issues of current \r\nconcern.  \r\n The United Nations has responded to a good \r\nnumber of challenges that justified its establishment at \r\nthe end of the Second World War. In 66 years, the \r\nworld has changed greatly, and the pace of change \r\nincreases every day.  \r\n A great institution such as ours cannot remain \r\nstatic while its setting constantly changes. The time has \r\ncome to envisage adapting the Organization to current \r\nrealities so as to improve its effectiveness and, above \r\nall, to bolster confidence among Member States. To do \r\nthat, it must make substantial progress in the major \r\nareas of a reform too long awaited, whether the \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly, reform of the \r\nSecurity Council or the role of the Economic and \r\nSocial Council, which needs to be strengthened. A \r\nSecurity Council that incorporates equally the \r\nlegitimate aspirations of developing countries, \r\nparticularly those of Africa, would certainly be more \r\nlegitimate. \r\n Furthermore, the issues of climate change and the \r\nprotection of nature demand a changed approach that \r\ntakes into account the aspirations of all peoples. That is \r\nan area where it is prudent to demonstrate a spirit of \r\ncompromise and solidarity in the interest, of course, of \r\nall countries.  \r\n That is also the case for the crucial goals of \r\ndisarmament and the non-proliferation of weapons of \r\nmass destruction, which remain hostage to the policy \r\nof double standards, such as discriminatory practices \r\nand non-compliance with commitments made, in \r\nparticular by certain nuclear Powers. \r\n The fight against impunity and against human \r\nrights violations, which is subjected to a selective \r\napproach and the partisan implementation of \r\ninternational humanitarian law, gives rise to legitimate \r\ndoubts about the exploitation of these noble causes for \r\npolitical ends. Our Organization must address these \r\nissues. \r\n The Democratic Republic of the Congo believes \r\nthat the Israeli-Palestinian question should be a major \r\nconcern for our universal Organization. The United \r\nA/66/PV.16  \r\n \r\n11-50871 26 \r\n \r\nNations should unflaggingly continue its efforts to find \r\nan equitable solution that bears in mind the legitimate \r\ninterests of two peoples, each with the right to live in \r\npeace and security. The Middle East cannot recover \r\npeace and stability without a fair and lasting settlement \r\nof this question.  \r\n I would not continue my remarks without \r\nmentioning the more active cooperation that we would \r\nlike to see between the African Union and the United \r\nNations in the area of conflict management. It is \r\nadvisable, in my humble opinion, that we strengthen \r\nthis cooperation and make better use of it in order to \r\nreduce the number of hot spots on our continent. We all \r\nstand to gain. \r\n Mr. Archondo (Plurinational State of Bolivia), \r\nVice-President, took the Chair. \r\n I have focused my remarks today on the need to \r\nstrengthen peace. That is the essential precondition for \r\nall progress, but a peace limited to an absence of \r\nstomping boots is not peace. Without ignoring the \r\nsuccesses, it must be said that in this area our \r\nOrganization still has an enormous amount to do to \r\nensure that each and every person is able to participate \r\nin the progress of all of humanity. \r\n I conclude by renewing our wishes to see the \r\nconcept and management of international affairs \r\nmodified through an effective and sincere commitment \r\nof the entire community of nations for a renewal and \r\nstrengthening of the multilateral system. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Democratic Republic of the Congo for \r\nthe statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Joseph Kabila Kabange, President of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, was escorted \r\nfrom the General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Johnson Toribiong, President of the \r\nRepublic of Palau \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Palau. \r\n Mr. Johnson Toribiong, President of the Republic \r\nof Palau, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Johnson Toribiong, President of the Republic of \r\nPalau, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Toribiong: It is an honour and a \r\nprivilege to address the General Assembly once again \r\non behalf of the people of Palau. \r\n For thousands of years, Palau was blessed by a \r\nnatural bounty that sustained our livelihood and bound \r\nus together as a people. We lived in remoteness and \r\nisolation by respecting the environment and managing \r\nour natural resources for the benefit of every \r\ngeneration. \r\n Today, however, we find ourselves to be innocent \r\nvictims of transboundary harm. Forces beyond Palau’s \r\ncontrol, and not of our own making, are ravaging the \r\noceans, damaging the land and reefs, threatening our \r\nway of life and, in the worst-case scenario, our very \r\nexistence. Although we do our best to act responsibly \r\nand sustainably, there is only so much my country can \r\ndo on its own to protect itself. We therefore rely on our \r\npartners, the international system and on the \r\ninternational rule of law to provide a remedy. \r\n I would like to speak today about three pernicious \r\ntypes of transboundary harm.  \r\n First, I point to the state of global fisheries. \r\nPalau’s fish are among the most valuable in the world, \r\nbut they are in danger. Distant water boats do not \r\nrespect our borders, laws or traditions. These boats \r\ncome in great numbers for tuna in the Western and \r\nCentral Pacific region, where Palau is located. At \r\npresent, our region’s tuna is being taken for pennies on \r\nthe dollar. These boats also hunt, fin and sell sharks for \r\na tiny fraction of what tourists will pay to see those \r\nsharks alive in our waters. \r\n Like the ocean’s currents, efforts to protect the \r\nmarine environment must flow across boundary lines. \r\nIt takes international cooperation to protect our marine \r\nresources and environment. \r\n Palau and other Pacific small island developing \r\nStates have undertaken innovative measures to ensure \r\nthe continued viability of our stocks. We have limited \r\npurse seine fishing, agreed to close the “donut holes” \r\nbetween our jurisdictions and implemented a Vessel \r\nDay Scheme. \r\n A/66/PV.16\r\n \r\n27 11-50871 \r\n \r\n Two years ago, from this very rostrum, I \r\nannounced the creation of the world’s first shark \r\nsanctuary. Since that time, countries and territories \r\nacross the globe have joined Palau in this effort. Today, \r\nmore than 2.7 million square kilometres of ocean are \r\nsafe for sharks. Our ocean’s health depends on sharks, \r\nso I am delighted that earlier today several \r\nrepresentatives of States in different parts of the world \r\njoined me to declare our shared commitment to \r\nconserving the ocean’s vast biodiversity and nurturing \r\nand protecting shark sanctuaries. But that is just the \r\nfirst step. \r\n Global fisheries should be sustainable. Reckless \r\npractices that harm our fisheries and threaten our food \r\nsecurity should stop. That means that shark finning \r\nshould stop. Bottom trawling, which destroys the base \r\nof the marine food web, should also stop. \r\n The Food and Agriculture Organization of the \r\nUnited Nations reports that 85 per cent of global fish \r\nstocks are now fully or overexploited. These are the \r\nworst numbers on record. The international community \r\nmust find a way to make regional fisheries \r\nmanagement organizations more accountable, so that \r\nthe world can see whether countries are living up to \r\ntheir commitments. And global fisheries should be fair. \r\nIf distant water vessels want to come to fish for our \r\nresources, they must respect our laws and those of our \r\nregion. They should fish within our prescribed limits \r\nand share the mutual benefits with us in a fair and \r\nequitable manner. \r\n Fishing is not a right. It is a privilege. For too \r\nlong, the exploitation of tuna has overridden efforts to \r\nconserve it. This imbalance is not sustainable and must \r\nbe reversed. This should be done by creating a tuna \r\nconservation zone to make the conservation of this \r\nvaluable resource paramount and to maximize the \r\nbenefits to the nations in our region where tuna is \r\nharvested. We who live in the Pacific see the ocean as \r\nour farm, the source of our sustenance and livelihood. \r\nAt the biggest-ever Pacific Tuna Conference, to be held \r\nin Palau in early December, that concept of a tuna \r\nconservation zone will be considered and applied to \r\nour region of the world. We should continue our efforts \r\nto maximize the benefits to our islands of sustainable \r\ntuna fishing in our waters. \r\n Secondly, we fear that this year undetectable \r\namounts of nuclear radiation may have entered our \r\nterritory. This is a particularly insidious form of \r\ntransboundary harm. I was involved in writing Palau’s \r\nConstitution, which bans the presence of any nuclear \r\nmaterial in our territory. We are proud to have been the \r\nfirst in the world to institute such a prohibition. But the \r\nsupreme law of our land cannot protect us from \r\npotential radiation coming from outside our borders. \r\nWe fear the possibility that someday our fish may not \r\nbe safe to eat and our water may not be safe to drink. \r\nAnd so we ask the world to redouble its efforts to \r\neliminate the threat of nuclear radiation. \r\n Thirdly, as I speak, people are suffering from the \r\neffects of climate change. As our corals die, shores \r\nerode and waters rise, people feel helpless and \r\nhopeless. Traditionally, we would appeal for divine \r\nintervention. But this is not a problem from above; it is \r\nmanmade. It poses an existential threat that exemplifies \r\nthe issue of transboundary harm. Today, I regret to say \r\nthat we are nowhere close to a solution. Next year will \r\nmark the twentieth anniversary of the signing of the \r\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange. But have we made progress? While sea levels \r\nhave risen, emissions continue unabated. We are still \r\nwithout a binding agreement. \r\n This past July, the Pacific small island developing \r\nStates banded together to put before the Security \r\nCouncil modest, achievable and prudent proposals for \r\naddressing the security threats of climate change. But \r\nour voices were drowned out by other States’ priorities. \r\nI can only agree with the views expressed in the \r\nCouncil by the United States: the failure of some States \r\nto acknowledge the clear-cut security implications of \r\nclimate change is pathetic. \r\n However, we will not be deterred. Leaders of the \r\nPacific States have declared that the urgent social, \r\neconomic and security threats posed by climate change \r\nrequire action in every international forum. The \r\nGeneral Assembly, in its consensus resolution 63/281, \r\ninvited the relevant bodies of the United Nations to \r\nintensify their efforts in considering and addressing \r\nclimate change, including its possible security \r\nimplications.  \r\n With this in mind, Palau and the Republic of the \r\nMarshall Islands will call on the Assembly to seek, on \r\nan urgent basis and pursuant to Article 96 of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations, an advisory opinion \r\nfrom the International Court of Justice on the \r\nresponsibilities of States under international law to \r\nensure that activities emitting greenhouse gases that \r\nA/66/PV.16  \r\n \r\n11-50871 28 \r\n \r\nare carried out under their jurisdiction or control do not \r\ndamage other States. \r\n The case should be clear. The International Court \r\nof Justice has already confirmed that customary \r\ninternational law obliges States to ensure that activities \r\nwithin their jurisdiction or under their control respect \r\nthe environment of other States. Similarly, Article 194, \r\nparagraph 2, of the United Nations Convention on the \r\nLaw of the Sea provides that States shall take all \r\nmeasures necessary to ensure that activities under their \r\njurisdiction or control do not spread or cause damage \r\nby pollution to other States. It is time we determined \r\nwhat the international rule of law means in the context \r\nof climate change. The International Court of Justice is \r\nmandated to do just that. \r\n At the opening of last year’s General Assembly, \r\nHis Excellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stated \r\nthat “At the United Nations, we find the proper path in \r\ncommunity, global cause … and mutual responsibility \r\nfor a destiny we share” (A/65/PV.11, p. 1). That \r\nsentiment means, first and foremost, that countries \r\nmust do no harm, particularly to the most fragile \r\namong us. We should find guidance in the international \r\nrule of law. Nations must respect fellow nations. \r\nWhether the issue is destructive fishing practices, \r\nnuclear radiation or excessive emissions, nations must \r\nwork together and cease to cause transboundary harm. \r\n I would like to share with the Assembly a number \r\nof important initiatives that Palau is undertaking to \r\nconnect with the international community, literally and \r\nin spirit.  \r\n Palau is currently connected to the Internet by \r\nsatellite. However, the service is poor and the cost \r\nunaffordable for most of our people. Last year’s report \r\nof the International Telecommunication Union’s \r\nBroadband Commission confirms that broadband \r\naccess is a prerequisite to achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. According to the report, a 10 per \r\ncent increase in broadband penetration in developing \r\ncountries increases GDP by 1.4 per cent. Imagine what \r\na 100 per cent increase could do. \r\n In light of that report, I have signed Executive \r\nOrder No. 297 establishing a presidential task force to \r\nacquire a submarine fibre optic cable so that Palau will \r\nbe better equipped to meet its Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. I hope that others will cooperate \r\nto help Palau connect to the world, and that leaders \r\nwill answer the Commission’s clarion call to ensure \r\nthat all people have access to broadband networks by \r\n2015. \r\n Palau is also reaching out to the world on human \r\nrights. In February, we began our Human Rights \r\nCouncil Universal Periodic Review. As a former \r\npracticing attorney and human rights advocate, I have \r\nbeen an ardent supporter of this process from the \r\noutset, and so I have committed Palau’s limited \r\nresources to ensuring a complete and meaningful \r\noutcome. As evidence of that commitment, I \r\nestablished a task force chaired by our Minister of \r\nState and comprised of officials from across a broad \r\nspectrum of our Government. Stakeholders from \r\nnon-governmental organizations and civil society were \r\nalso invited to become involved in the operations of the \r\ntask force and contributed significantly to Palau’s \r\nnational report. \r\n By all accounts, Palau’s response was a great \r\nsuccess. The Human Rights Council unanimously \r\nadopted our report. The most repeated recommendation \r\nfrom Human Rights Council members was that Palau \r\nshould establish a National Human Rights Institution. I \r\nhave taken this recommendation to heart and am \r\npleased to announce that Palau will establish a \r\nNational Human Rights Institution. I am also pleased \r\nto announce that, as of this week, Palau is now a \r\nsignatory to all core international human rights \r\nconventions. I hope others will assist Palau as we build \r\nour institution and work to fulfil our obligations under \r\nthose conventions. \r\n Once again, I wish to bring to the world’s \r\nattention the fact that the fierce battles fought by \r\nforeign armies over Palau’s islands during the Second \r\nWorld War left explosives scattered across our land and \r\nin our waters. Some of those explosives, which number \r\nin the thousands, are still live. I appeal to the \r\nconscience of the world and, especially, of those \r\nresponsible, to help us remove this danger from our \r\nmidst. \r\n I would like to thank the Secretary-General for \r\nattending the recent meeting of the Pacific Islands \r\nForum, held earlier this month in Auckland, New \r\nZealand. That meeting was the Forum’s fortieth \r\nanniversary and was the first time that a United \r\nNations Secretary-General has attended our regional \r\nmeeting and the first time that a United Nations \r\nSecretary-General has visited a Pacific small island \r\ndeveloping State. I would like to thank His Excellency \r\n A/66/PV.16\r\n \r\n29 11-50871 \r\n \r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon for his visit. It is a testament to the \r\nfact that the countries of our region, even the smallest \r\nand most vulnerable among us, have something \r\nimportant to say and to contribute to our world. \r\n I would also like to express Palau’s gratitude for \r\nthe strong support and friendship of all of our partners, \r\nnew and old. In particular, I would like to thank the \r\nUnited States of America, Japan and the Taiwan \r\nprovince of China. \r\n In order to further promote the efficacy, goals and \r\nideals of the United Nations, we recommend that \r\nTaiwan be invited to participate meaningfully in the \r\nUnited Nations system. I believe that the United \r\nNations cannot fully and properly address the issues of \r\nhealth, aviation safety and climate change unless \r\nTaiwan is allowed to participate in the activities of the \r\nWorld Health Organization, the International Civil \r\nAviation Organization and the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change. Once \r\nagain, I appeal to the world to allow Taiwan to \r\nparticipate in these important United Nations entities. \r\n Finally, Palau is a relatively new State, having \r\njoined the world community in 1994. Thus, we \r\nremember well the jubilation of our new-found \r\nfreedom and independence. I take this opportunity to \r\ncongratulate the people of South Sudan on attaining \r\ntheir independence and taking their rightful place here, \r\nin United Nations. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Palau for the statement he \r\nhas just made. \r\n Mr. Johnson Toribiong, President of the Republic \r\nof Palau, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Idriss Déby Itno, President of the \r\nRepublic of Chad \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by His Excellency \r\nMr. Idriss Déby Itno, President of the Republic of \r\nChad. \r\n Mr. Idriss Déby Itno, President of the Republic of \r\nChad, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Idriss Déby Itno, President of the Republic of \r\nChad, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Déby Itno (spoke in French): The \r\nChadian delegation warmly congratulates the President \r\non his election to the presidency of the Assembly at its \r\nsixty-sixth session and assures him of its cooperation \r\nand support as he carries out his noble endeavours.  \r\n I also express my delegation’s admiration for his \r\npredecessor, Mr. Joseph Deiss, who skilfully guided \r\nthe Assembly’s work during the sixty-fifth session. \r\n Finally, Chad pays tribute the Secretary-General, \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his work on the \r\ndevelopment front and towards peace in the world. We \r\nreiterate to him our warmest congratulations on his \r\nwell-deserved re-election to a second term at the helm \r\nof our Organization. \r\n My delegation welcomes the choice of the central \r\ntheme for our general debate, “The role of mediation in \r\nthe settlement of disputes”. This theme is fully \r\nconsistent with our own political vision, our \r\nconvictions and our philosophy of a harmonious and \r\negalitarian world.  \r\n Chad has made its own modest contribution in \r\nsupporting the efforts of the State of Qatar, the United \r\nNations and the international community by \r\nparticipating at the highest level in the negotiations and \r\nconclusion of the Doha Framework Agreement for the \r\nResolution of the Conflict in Darfur between the \r\nSudanese Government and the armed opposition in \r\nDarfur. We sincerely hope that this crisis will finally be \r\nresolved. To that end, the Sudan should be supported \r\nby the entire international community, so that peace \r\nand security can be restored throughout the country \r\nand in the subregion.  \r\n Furthermore, we are concerned by the hotbeds of \r\ntension that are spreading throughout the world and \r\nthat sometimes stem from the profound changes taking \r\nplace, particularly in some countries of the Middle East \r\nand in the Maghreb. That process is often described as \r\nthe Arab Spring. \r\n Our Organization must be resolute in its \r\ncommitment to stand with the parties to conflict, as \r\npart of efforts to find solutions based on reconciliation \r\nand forgiveness. In addition to the losses of human life \r\nA/66/PV.16  \r\n \r\n11-50871 30 \r\n \r\nthat we have witnessed, we should also mention the \r\nfact that dramatic circumstances such as these also \r\nresult in the inevitable streams of refugees and the \r\ndisplaced. And when we speak of refugees and \r\ndisplaced persons, we are talking about misery and \r\nterrible suffering. We are well qualified to discuss this \r\nissue, given that Chad is now hosting more than \r\n100,000 refugees from Central Africa in the south-\r\nwestern part of the country and more than 290,000 \r\nSudanese refugees and 180,000 Chadian displaced \r\npersons in the east. They have been living in this \r\nsituation since 2003, in precarious environmental and \r\nsocial conditions. \r\n We call on the international community to show \r\nsolidarity and to assist us in assuming responsibility \r\nfor all Chadian displaced persons. In the wake of the \r\nfull withdrawal last March of the United Nations \r\nMission in the Central African Republic and Chad \r\n(MINURCAT), the Chadian Government assumed \r\nresponsibility for the protection of refugees and \r\ndisplaced persons, as well as of the humanitarian \r\norganizations that are assisting them, by setting up a \r\nspecial national force known as the Détachement \r\nintégré de sécurité. It is to be hoped that our partners \r\nwill continue to deploy efforts alongside us and \r\ncomplement them with the financial and logistical \r\nsupport necessary to the proper functioning of that \r\nforce. \r\n In addition, like a number of other Sahel \r\ncountries, Chad has witnessed the return from Libya, in \r\nvery dangerous conditions, of almost 100,000 of its \r\nnationals who were forced to leave Libya in a state of \r\nutter destitution. I should like to take this opportunity \r\nto thank the International Organization for Migration \r\nand other institutions as well as all those countries that \r\nhave assisted us in repatriating and providing \r\nassistance to our nationals. Our deepest desire is for \r\npeace to return to Libya so that the killing can end and \r\nthe Libyans can reconcile in the framework of the \r\nNational Transitional Council in order to build a State \r\nbased on the rule of law and democracy. \r\n In connection with the building of a new Libya, \r\nwe would draw the attention of our Libyan brothers to \r\nthe situation of those of our citizens who, despite \r\nhaving contributed to the development of that country \r\nas immigrant workers, are sometimes referred to \r\nindiscriminately as mercenaries. In addition, we wish \r\nto express our great concern about the fate of the \r\n400,000 Chadians who remain trapped in Libya. We \r\ncall on the new Libyan authorities urgently to take \r\nmeasures aimed at fulfilling its commitment to protect \r\nimmigrants. \r\n Chad would also like to share with the Assembly \r\nour views on current issues of common concern, a \r\nnumber of which are being discussed in meetings \r\nduring this session. These are mainly problems that \r\naffect international solidarity. They include the \r\nhandling of economic and environmental crises as well \r\nas the security situation in our region. These issues \r\ndirectly affect our daily lives in that they hinder or \r\neven stall our development efforts, particularly in the \r\ncase of countries emerging from conflict, such as Chad. \r\nThe aftermath of those crises will certainly jeopardize \r\nthe implementation of our development strategies and \r\nour capacity to achieve the Millennium Development \r\nGoals by 2015. \r\n Chad, which has lived through decades of \r\nexternal attacks, cannot achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals unless it receives substantial \r\nsupport through, inter alia, the Heavily Indebted Poor \r\nCountries initiative. For that reason, we have \r\nrepeatedly called for support from the relevant \r\ninternational institutions.  \r\n One of the consequences of climate change is that \r\nthis year the Sahel area saw low levels of rainfall, \r\nwhich could lead to an environmental and humanitarian \r\ncatastrophe such as the one that we have seen in recent \r\nmonths in the Horn of Africa. \r\n We commend all of the initiatives undertaken by \r\nthe Organization to promote international solidarity \r\nwith our countries through high-level meetings and \r\nsummits, including the United Nations Conference on \r\nthe Least Developed Countries, held in Istanbul, and \r\nupcoming conferences on combating desertification \r\nand on sustainable development, to be held in Korea \r\nand in Rio de Janeiro, respectively. \r\n Among the other major initiatives that we have \r\nundertaken, I would like to stress in particular those \r\nrelating to free emergency health care, maternal and \r\nchild health, communicable diseases such as \r\nHIV/AIDS and malaria, and free education at all levels. \r\nOur policies on gender and on the empowerment of \r\nyouth remain the cornerstone of our vision of a new \r\nChad that is moving ahead and making progress. \r\n Finally, of all the challenges facing us, the issue \r\nof sustainable development remains a priority. Indeed, \r\n A/66/PV.16\r\n \r\n31 11-50871 \r\n \r\nfollowing the holding in Chad in June 2010 of a \r\nmeeting on the Great Green Wall initiative by the \r\ncountries of the Sahel, our country in October 2010 \r\nconvened the eighth World Forum on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment on the theme “Save Lake Chad”. The \r\naction plans that emerged from those meetings are \r\nbeing publicized so as to ensure support for their \r\nimplementation. We call once again on the \r\ninternational community to assist those countries \r\nlocated on the banks of Lake Chad to help save the \r\nlake, because the world should know that the future of \r\nthe Congo Basin forest depends on its survival, as does \r\nthe combat against desertification.  \r\n The question of Palestine has been outstanding \r\nfor far too long, and its impact on regional and global \r\nsecurity influence is felt daily. There is therefore an \r\nurgent need for an international consensus on the issue \r\nof the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people. We \r\nbelieve that the time has come to recognize a State of \r\nPalestine living side by side with the State of Israel. \r\nWe must have the courage to move forward in this \r\ndirection, which is essential in order to bring about \r\npeace between the Israeli and the Palestinian peoples. \r\nFor that reason, I call on all peace- and justice-loving \r\ncountries to commit themselves to that end. \r\n Finally, we would like once again to touch on the \r\nissue of the reform of the United Nations, one of whose \r\ncharacteristics is the marginalization of a large part of \r\nhumankind; I refer here to the African people. African \r\nStates, individually and collectively, are today key \r\nplayers in terms of peace, security and development. \r\nUnfortunately, it has to be said that they have not yet \r\nassumed their full role within the system, because of, \r\ninter alia, their marginalization in the context of \r\ninitiatives aimed at resolving certain conflicts that pose \r\na threat to peace and security on our continent. \r\n United Nations reform is absolutely necessary, \r\nand we should accelerate the process, in consideration \r\nof the claims and legitimate hopes of Africans, whose \r\nmain concern is to fulfil the right of the African \r\ncontinent to be represented on the Security Council by \r\na permanent seat with veto power. That is the only way \r\nfor Africa to effectively contribute to conflict \r\nprevention and settlement and to the maintenance of \r\npeace in the world at large and on the African continent \r\nin particular. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Chad for the statement he \r\nhas just made. \r\n Mr. Idriss Déby Itno, President of the Republic of \r\nChad, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Ivo Josipović, President of the \r\nRepublic of Croatia \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nGeneral Assembly will now hear an address by the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Croatia. \r\n Mr. Ivo Josipović, President of the Republic of \r\nCroatia, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Ivo \r\nJosipović, President of the Republic of Croatia, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Josipović: It is a distinct pleasure for \r\nme to participate in the general debate of the General \r\nAssembly for the first time since my election as \r\nPresident of Croatia. \r\n At the outset, I would like to congratulate \r\nAmbassador Al-Nasser on his election as President of \r\nthe General Assembly in its sixty-sixth session. I also \r\nthank Joseph Deiss for his excellent work during his \r\npresidency of the General Assembly in the preceding \r\nsession. \r\n Let me also congratulate Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon on his re-election to that important and \r\nchallenging post and assure him of the full cooperation \r\nof my country. \r\n Current challenges — the fall of autocratic \r\nregimes, nuclear non-proliferation, terrorism, the \r\ncontinuing global financial and economic crisis, \r\nclimate change, underdevelopment — require all of us \r\nhere at the United Nations to firmly stand together and \r\noffer common solutions on the basis of solidarity, \r\nresponsibility and respect for the rights and dignity of \r\nevery person on the globe. Our responses to challenges \r\nmust not remain just words. We need to translate them \r\ninto concrete actions, aimed at advancing democracy, \r\nenhancing development and well-being, protecting \r\nhuman rights, respecting international law, ensuring \r\nA/66/PV.16  \r\n \r\n11-50871 32 \r\n \r\nsocial justice and promoting the rule of law, at the \r\ndomestic, regional and international levels. \r\n I welcome the President’s decision to hold this \r\ndebate under the theme of “The role of mediation in \r\nthe settlement of disputes”. Mediation has rightly been \r\nrecognized as an efficient and cost-effective tool, \r\nwhich the United Nations has at its disposal in \r\naddressing threats to the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security. Political issues often lie at the heart \r\nof crises. Therefore, the importance of early \r\nengagement and preventive diplomacy, including \r\nmediation, is even more significant in this period when \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations are \r\nexperiencing unprecedented demand and strain. \r\n My country has come a long way since the \r\nconflict in the 1990s, when Croatia hosted a total of \r\nfive United Nations peacekeeping operations on its \r\nterritory. We have developed a stable democracy and a \r\nfree-market economy, and we serve as an anchor of \r\npeace, security and stability in the region of South-East \r\nEurope. \r\n That experience and the lessons learned have \r\nbeen the backdrop for our engagement in the Security \r\nCouncil, where Croatia has proved to be a responsible \r\nand dedicated partner in the common effort to maintain \r\nand build peace. We intend to pursue efforts with the \r\nsame vigour in the Peacebuilding Commission, the \r\nEconomic and Social Council and other United Nations \r\nbodies for which Croatia is a candidate. \r\n When all efforts to avoid conflict fail, the \r\ninternational community turns as a rule to the United \r\nNations to stop the hostilities and maintain peace. \r\nCroatia will continue its engagement in peacekeeping \r\noperations under United Nations auspices. But keeping \r\nthe peace is not enough. In countries emerging from \r\nconflict, peace needs to be strengthened and \r\nconsolidated.  \r\n Croatia has, in a relatively short time, effectively \r\ntransitioned from a donor-recipient to a donor-provider. \r\nToday we share our knowledge and experiences with \r\ncountries in the region, as well as with other countries \r\nin crisis, where our post-conflict experience in nation-\r\nbuilding is particularly relevant. My country, working \r\ntogether with other Member States and the United \r\nNations as a whole — and acting with the same \r\nenthusiasm and spirit that clearly characterized the \r\ninternational community’s ambitions almost six years \r\nago when the Peacebuilding Commission was \r\nestablished — stands ready to play its part in the \r\nrevival of the peacebuilding architecture and thorough \r\nimplementation of its core functions. \r\n Croatia has completed its accession negotiations \r\nwith the European Union (EU) and expects to become \r\na full member in 2013. Once it joins the EU, Croatia \r\nwill consistently advocate further EU enlargement and \r\nwill not use its outstanding bilateral issues to set \r\nconditions for the progress of individual countries in \r\nthe process of their integration with the EU. \r\n I have held numerous meetings with my \r\ncounterparts in the region, in particular the Presidents \r\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia. In our \r\nmeetings, we have discussed the continuation of the \r\nreconciliation process, the resolution of outstanding \r\nissues among the three States and our mutual political \r\nsupport. Croatia has pledged technical assistance in the \r\nprocess of integration into the European Union and has \r\nstressed the need to jointly define regional networks of \r\ninfrastructure systems and submit them as regional \r\nprojects for funding from EU funds. \r\n As a member of NATO and a future member of \r\nthe EU, we have a keen interest to see South-East \r\nEurope become a region of security, stability and \r\ndevelopment. That may not happen overnight, but I \r\nfirmly believe that with sustained effort and targeted \r\nactions by all politicians and peoples, the region will \r\nlose its negative reputation as an arena of political \r\nfragmentation often accompanied by bloodshed, and \r\nwill deservedly become known as an area where good-\r\nneighbourly relations, tolerance and mutual \r\ncooperation prevail, thus making it a European success \r\nstory of peacebuilding and reconciliation. \r\n However, without justice, efforts to ensure true \r\nreconciliation and sustainable peace may be unable to \r\ntake root firmly. Croatia strongly supports determined \r\nefforts to put an end to impunity for the most serious \r\ncrimes of concern to humanity and, in that context, \r\nreaffirms its commitment to international criminal \r\njustice in general and to the activities of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court in particular. \r\n Croatia supports the main purpose and primary \r\nfunctions of the International Criminal Tribunal for the \r\nFormer Yugoslavia (ICTY), namely, the establishment \r\nof a lasting peace and reconciliation. Croatia \r\nappreciates the efforts to implement the ICTY \r\ncompletion strategy and its transformation towards \r\nresidual mechanisms. Full cooperation with the ICTY \r\n A/66/PV.16\r\n \r\n33 11-50871 \r\n \r\nand respect for international justice are a lasting \r\ncommitment for us, not only in the context of the \r\nEuro-Atlantic integration processes, but also as an \r\nexpression of Croatia’s core values and its role in the \r\ninternational community. We greatly appreciate the \r\nlegacy of the ICTY, especially its contribution to \r\ninternational law, justice and reconciliation. That \r\nlegacy has already improved national judiciaries in the \r\nregion through its promotion of high standards of \r\ncriminal responsibility for breaches of humanitarian \r\nlaw. Further development of international law, both \r\ninternational and national judiciaries and a better \r\nunderstanding of justice will be based on this positive \r\nlegacy, but also on the lessons learned from some of \r\nthe ICTY’s weaknesses. \r\n Future development of international criminal law \r\nshould consider improving the efficiency of \r\ninternational courts and of State cooperation, as well as \r\ninstituting a critical evaluation of some procedural and \r\nsubstantive laws. In that regard, we should consider \r\nmore efficient measures to be taken in cases of \r\nnon-cooperative States, the position of victims and \r\ntheir compensation, and the protection of witnesses, as \r\nwell as the concept of joint criminal enterprise, and \r\nothers. \r\n The protection of fundamental rights and \r\nfreedoms must be ensured when addressing very \r\nserious security challenges, such as international \r\nterrorism. Croatia strongly supports the values and \r\nobjectives of the United Nations Global Counter-\r\nTerrorism Strategy, since it confirms that the United \r\nNations is at the centre of global counter-terrorism \r\nefforts. We had the privilege of chairing the Counter-\r\nTerrorism Committee during Croatia’s membership in \r\nthe Security Council, and we are willing to share our \r\nknowledge and experience with others, in the region \r\nand beyond. \r\n The Arab Spring, which is rooted in the \r\nlegitimate aspirations of ordinary people for improved \r\neconomic opportunities and political participation, has \r\njust moved into summer, but its democratic gains must \r\nbe preserved if we do not want to see another relapse \r\ninto instability. I believe that the course of recent \r\nevents in Libya has clearly confirmed that the coalition \r\nforces and the Security Council took the right approach \r\nin protecting civilians from the brute force of the old \r\nregime. I hope that the democratic forces in Libya will \r\nbegin to build a new State that will provide the same \r\nlevel of protection and equal opportunities for all \r\nLibya’s citizens. It is crucial to work towards \r\nestablishing the rule of law throughout the country. We \r\ntrust that the National Transitional Council will \r\nsucceed in achieving that goal. My country is ready to \r\nparticipate in Libya’s reconstruction, especially given \r\nits experience in post-conflict nation- and institution-\r\nbuilding. Taking into account new political and \r\nhumanitarian priorities in the field, Croatia has sent \r\ntargeted humanitarian assistance to Libya, with an \r\nemphasis on medical and humanitarian needs. \r\n In the same vein, Croatia has recognized the \r\nlegitimate aspirations of the Syrian people, who need \r\nand deserve wide and undivided support. We share the \r\ninternational community’s belief that it is essential to \r\nnormalize the situation and prevent further mass \r\nviolations of human rights, strengthen democratic \r\nstandards and the rule of law, and assist those who \r\nshare the vision of a democratic Syria. \r\n Croatia shares the sense of urgency concerning \r\nthe importance of securing an early resumption and \r\nconclusion of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, aimed at \r\nachieving a two-State solution. The current \r\nunprecedented and deep changes in the political \r\nlandscape of the Middle East call for urgent and highly \r\nresponsive action by all parties concerned. Mutual \r\nrecognition — Israel’s recognition of a Palestinian \r\nState and Palestine’s recognition of the Jewish State — \r\nconstitutes both the starting point and the desired \r\noutcome of peace negotiations. Failure to move \r\nforward on a two-State solution now may have \r\nunpredictable negative consequences, not only for \r\nIsrael and Palestine, but for the whole international \r\ncommunity. Given our recent experience of war and \r\nreconciliation, Croatia calls on the leaders of the \r\nparties concerned to shoulder their historic \r\nresponsibility for the future of their peoples and for \r\npeace and stability in the Middle East. \r\n Recently, we witnessed an example of a new \r\nState being created in a generally peaceful manner, and \r\nI welcome South Sudan as the newest Member of the \r\nUnited Nations. However, this and many other ongoing \r\ncrises, in the Sudan, Somalia, the Democratic Republic \r\nof the Congo and other places, confirm the \r\nirreplaceable role of the United Nations in ending \r\nconflicts; and in this context mediation, as the theme of \r\nour debate, becomes even more relevant. \r\n Croatia continues to promote universal human \r\nrights and supports the mainstreaming of human rights \r\nA/66/PV.16  \r\n \r\n11-50871 34 \r\n \r\nwithin the United Nations framework. In that context, \r\nwe give particular attention to issues such as the \r\nabolition of the death penalty, gender equality and \r\ncombating all forms of discrimination, as well as the \r\npromotion of the human rights of the most vulnerable \r\nsocial groups, including women, children and persons \r\nwith disabilities. Croatia strongly supports the concepts \r\nof the universality, interrelatedness and indivisibility of \r\nall human rights. \r\n Croatia welcomes the establishment of UN-Women, \r\nthe new United Nations body focused on supporting \r\ngender equality and the empowerment of women. \r\nCroatia also supports relevant initiatives on the rights \r\nof lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons and \r\nwill continue to be actively engaged in the follow-up \r\nprocess to the 2008 joint statement on human rights, \r\nsexual orientation and gender identity (see \r\nA/63/PV.70). \r\n In response to dramatic changes in the world in \r\nthe last few decades, comprehensive reforms of the \r\nUnited Nations system as a whole have been put \r\nforward. Those proposals include structural reform and \r\nimprovements in the way United Nations bodies \r\nfunction, as well as revitalization of the General \r\nAssembly. Although there are many important elements \r\nin this process, reforming the Security Council remains \r\nessential. Croatia believes that the Security Council \r\nmust adequately represent the current structure of the \r\nmembership of the United Nations. We therefore \r\nsupport enlarging the Security Council in both \r\npermanent and non-permanent membership categories. \r\nTaking into consideration that the number of members \r\nof the Eastern European Group has almost doubled, \r\nCroatia proposes that one seat be added for the Group \r\nin the non-permanent category. Croatia is also aware of \r\nthe importance of resolving all the other elements of \r\nSecurity Council reform. \r\n As we witness the increasing challenges \r\nappearing around the world, it is clear that we must all \r\nmake every effort to strengthen the capability, \r\nefficiency and credibility of the United Nations in \r\ngeneral. We welcome the establishment of the Change \r\nManagement Team, and look forward to seeing \r\nproposals for streamlining processes, increasing \r\naccountability and improving the efficiency of the \r\nUnited Nations in delivering its mandates. \r\n The challenges and consequences of climate \r\nchange are undermining efforts to achieve sustainable \r\ndevelopment. Climate change must be further \r\nmainstreamed into the work of the whole United \r\nNations system, with a view to supporting efforts to \r\nhelp the transition to low-carbon economies consistent \r\nwith sustainable development, to strengthen countries’ \r\nadaptation and resilience in the face of climate change, \r\nand to minimize the possible security implications. \r\n In the light of diminishing natural resources, \r\nenvironmental degradation, extreme poverty, hunger \r\nand diseases, and social unrest, we agree with others \r\nthat sustainable development has become the defining \r\nissue of our time. Our highly globalized and \r\ninterdependent world means that we share not only the \r\nsame challenges but a common fate. As a member of \r\nthe Bureau of the Preparatory Committee, Croatia will \r\nbe an active contributor to the preparations for next \r\nyear’s United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, the Rio+20 Conference. This summit \r\nmeeting will provide a unique opportunity to \r\nreinvigorate the spirit of Rio and to restate a blueprint \r\nfor political commitment, partnership and action on the \r\nground without revisiting the agreements reached at \r\nRio in 1992 or at Johannesburg in 2002. \r\n Finally, let me return to what this Organization \r\nstands for. In order to achieve our common objectives, \r\nwe must demonstrate unity of purpose, firm resolve, \r\nsolidarity and responsibility. Or, as a famous composer \r\nonce said, “Only the pure in heart can make a good \r\nsoup.” \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I thank the President \r\nof the Republic of Croatia for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\n Mr. Ivo Josipović, President of the Republic of \r\nCroatia, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Ms. Laura Chinchilla Miranda, President \r\nof the Republic of Costa Rica \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Costa Rica. \r\n Ms. Laura Chinchilla Miranda, President of the \r\nRepublic of Costa Rica, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\n A/66/PV.16\r\n \r\n35 11-50871 \r\n \r\nwelcome to the United Nations Her Excellency \r\nMs. Laura Chinchilla Miranda, President of the \r\nRepublic of Costa Rica, and to invite her to address the \r\nAssembly.  \r\n President Chinchilla Miranda (spoke in \r\nSpanish): It gives me great pleasure to begin my \r\nstatement by warmly congratulating Secretary-General \r\nBan Ki-moon on his re-election to the post in which he \r\nhas carried out his duties with such effectiveness and \r\nhonesty. His contributions to the Organization, the \r\ninternational community and the multilateral system \r\nover these first five years are well known. We know \r\nthey will continue to be so in the years to come. \r\n I would also like to congratulate the President of \r\nthe sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly, \r\nAmbassador Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser. His \r\nexperience, ability and dedication are guarantees of \r\nfruitful work. \r\n I extend my best wishes to both as they exercise \r\ntheir vital functions, and they will have Costa Rica’s \r\nfull support for their efforts in favour of peace, \r\nsecurity, democracy, disarmament, human rights, \r\nrespect for the rule of law, sustainable development, \r\nmediation and the peaceful settlement of disputes. \r\n I am also very pleased to welcome South Sudan \r\nas a new Member of the Organization. I believe that its \r\npeople will enjoy a prosperous, peaceful and safe \r\nfuture. The emergence of this new State is a testament \r\nto what can be achieved, even in situations of endemic \r\nviolence, through serious negotiations between the \r\nparties and international mediation. \r\n The intense and invigorating, but still uncertain, \r\ncurrents of political and social change that have swept \r\nthrough North Africa and the Middle East this year are \r\nproof of the universal force of democracy as an \r\naspiration, of free expression as an incentive, and of \r\nrespect for human dignity as the most urgent demand. \r\n Our admiration for the peoples of those countries \r\nis as great as our hope in their capacity to forge social \r\nand political systems in peace, systems that are \r\ntolerant, free and dynamic, in which people are \r\nrespected and whereby a country can be open to its \r\nneighbours.  \r\n We also hope that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict \r\nwill soon come to an end, with two sovereign and \r\ndemocratic States living in peaceful coexistence. \r\n From its deepest collective roots, Costa Rica fully \r\nidentifies with the principles of democracy, peace and \r\nhuman rights. These are values that we share with the \r\nimmense majority of Central Americans. \r\n Disrespect for those values, together with social \r\nexclusion, the outrages of militarism and the deadly \r\necho of the Cold War, plunged much of Central \r\nAmerica into a series of intense conflicts for almost \r\nfour decades. After tens of thousands of deaths, our \r\nregion was able, through dialogue and mediation, to \r\novercome the worst manifestations of political \r\nviolence. In those overwhelming days, Costa Rica \r\nmade a decisive contribution by shaping and realizing \r\nthe Esquipulas Accords, which opened the door to \r\nreconciliation. \r\n Since then, progress has been slow and erratic. \r\nFifteen years ago, as part of that process, Central \r\nAmerican countries signed the Framework Treaty on \r\nDemocratic Security in Central America. But the time \r\nthat has elapsed since then has not sufficed to secure \r\nthe peace, liberty, democracy and development in the \r\nregion that we promised our peoples. \r\n Even worse, we are now victims of a new and \r\nterrible form of aggression. I am referring to the cold, \r\ndisastrous and fierce onslaught of transnational \r\norganized crime. Such activities have generated \r\ninsecurity, weakened institutions, corrupted officials, \r\nfostered addiction, cut short the lives of thousands of \r\nyoung people, destroyed families and turned humble \r\nsingle mothers into criminals. This scourge has eroded \r\nthe basic fabric of our society and has jeopardized the \r\nvery existence of the rule of law in some countries. \r\n Today, I wish to repeat the comments I made on \r\n22 June at the International Conference on Regional \r\nSecurity in Central America, held recently in \r\nGuatemala. Our region has fallen victim to a perverse \r\ngeopolitical situation. As Costa Rica is located between \r\nthe major production centres and the world’s largest \r\nconsumer market for drugs, we have become a target in \r\nthe dynamic of death that both create. We must bear the \r\nburden of exponentially increasing material, \r\ninstitutional and human costs. What are instances of \r\nmere collateral damage for some of the main actors in \r\nthis conflict are, for the people of Central America, \r\nextreme challenges and a source of deep wounds. \r\n That is where our greatest frustration lies. That is \r\nwhy we demand that the international community, in \r\nparticular the largest consumers of drugs and producers \r\nA/66/PV.16  \r\n \r\n11-50871 36 \r\n \r\nof the weapons that create violence, fully assume its \r\nshare of responsibility without further delay. \r\n The International Conference on Regional \r\nSecurity in Central America, which was attended by \r\nthe Presidents of all of the countries in the region, from \r\nMexico to Colombia, was a hopeful turning point. \r\nThere, we were able to coordinate our strategies. \r\nThere, we agreed on the need for a comprehensive \r\napproach to violence that includes measures to \r\nstrengthen institutions and the rule of law, as well as \r\ncomprehensive initiatives to prevent and fight crime. In \r\naddition, we were able to catch the attention of, and \r\nobtain some promises from, the international \r\ncommunity. \r\n Nonetheless, it remains to be seen whether the \r\nstrategies can be translated into effective actions, or \r\nwhether we will have enough support from external \r\nresources to drive them forward. Those resources are \r\nnot merely aid. They are a morally inescapable and, in \r\npractical terms, indispensable form of compensation \r\nthat we need to make at least part of the investment \r\nnecessary to establish peace, stability and security. \r\n The Secretary-General of the United Nations has \r\ninsisted, quite rightly, on the need to promote \r\npreventive diplomacy. I join in that call as President of \r\nCosta Rica and as a citizen of Central America. I insist, \r\nbefore the world, that we can wait no longer to act in \r\norder to avoid an even greater tragedy in our region. It \r\nis already late; to wait even longer will be tragic. \r\n Preventive diplomacy demands political will. We \r\nare approaching another moment in which it will be put \r\nto the test. I refer to the upcoming United Conference \r\non the Arms Trade Treaty, which Costa Rica has \r\nactively supported, along with other States. We need to \r\nhave the Conference produce a robust, comprehensive \r\nand demanding instrument capable of effectively \r\ncontrolling the flow of the death machines that provoke \r\nall types of conflict. \r\n Preventive diplomacy, in its deepest essence, also \r\nmeans fostering democracy and human rights and \r\nrespecting the rule of law as the cornerstone of security \r\nand international coexistence. Costa Rica knows it \r\nwell. Since we abolished the army in 1949, our only \r\nlines of defence have been the deep civic beliefs of our \r\npeople, the strength of our institutions and the \r\ninstruments provided by the multilateral system. The \r\nsecurity of the 26 other disarmed democracies in the \r\nworld also depends on those defences. We deserve to \r\nbe heard and paid attention to. \r\n A little less than a year ago, our faith in \r\ninternational law and the instruments and institutions \r\nthat underpin it was put to the test. Last October, \r\nNicaraguan troops and civilians invaded and occupied \r\npart of our national territory, in clear violation of our \r\nsovereignty, the border treaties and international law. \r\nAfter exhausting the possibilities of a suitable bilateral \r\nagreement, we appealed to various forums of the \r\nregional and international system. Our neighbour’s \r\nGovernment rejected several of them. Finally, thanks to \r\nurgent measures ordered by the International Court of \r\nJustice, the Nicaraguan forces had to leave our \r\nterritory.  \r\n However, while we await the Court’s final ruling, \r\nNicaragua, ignoring the Court’s orders, has continued \r\nspecific provocations to and violations of the \r\nprovisional measures. Furthermore, it has threatened \r\nother actions that could infringe on our territory. We \r\nhope that that does not occur. But, if it were to, we will \r\nvigorously reinstate our actions before the machinery \r\nof the international system. \r\n All that we request of the Organization and the \r\nmultilateral system in general is rapid and timely \r\nconsideration of possible aggressions. The \r\ninternational community cannot make its preventive \r\naction conditional on actual armed violence between \r\nbrothers. It should react not only in relation to the \r\nquantity and scale of the explosive blasts, but to the \r\nseverity and persistence of the violations. \r\n Otherwise, the message to the world would be \r\ndisastrous. It would imply that the shortest route for \r\nmobilizing international diplomacy is that of blood. As \r\na country and as a people, we emphatically reject that \r\nnotion. \r\n Based on our firm belief in the importance of the \r\nrule of law, human rights and humanitarian law, I \r\ninformed the Assembly a year ago of our aspiration to \r\nbecome a member of the Human Rights Council. \r\nToday, I am grateful for the generous support that it \r\ngave us in achieving that goal. We will remain faithful \r\nto the promises made at the time and to the proposals \r\nthat we called for during the review of the Council in \r\nGeneva and New York. \r\n In particular, I urge Member States to support an \r\ninitiative whose time has come: the United Nations \r\n A/66/PV.16\r\n \r\n37 11-50871 \r\n \r\ndeclaration on human rights education and training, \r\nwhich Costa Rica supports together with a group of \r\nlike-minded countries. After its unanimous adoption by \r\nthe Council, it will soon be submitted to the General \r\nAssembly. We are confident that it will receive similar \r\nsupport. \r\n When education, deterrence and other preventive \r\nmechanisms are unable to avert the worst assaults on \r\nhuman dignity, the international community faces other \r\nobligations. Among them is the protection of civilians, \r\ncontained in the responsibility to protect. My country \r\nrecognizes that concept as a principle and guide for \r\naction, whether preventive or reactive, on the basis of \r\nlegitimate and well-founded decisions. We hope that \r\nsuch a concept, like human security, is very clearly \r\ndefined within the Organization. \r\n Moreover, the fight for human rights requires that \r\nperpetrators of crimes against humanity be held \r\naccountable and punished. Today, the International \r\nCriminal Court is the main multilateral mechanism for \r\nachieving that goal. I reiterate our support of its \r\nactivities and urge all States Members of the United \r\nNations to ratify the Treaty of Rome. I also urge that \r\nwe should all, as Member States, be more active and \r\nresolute in our support for the greater effectiveness, \r\nrelevance and significance of the United Nations; \r\nhence, the importance of its reform process. \r\n Costa Rica has joined and will continue to join \r\ninitiatives that push for the best possible changes. \r\nAmong other things, we will continue to work \r\nconstructively for the ongoing improvement of the \r\nworking methods of the Security Council, through the \r\nSmall Five group, and for a more representative \r\ncomposition of that organ, in accordance with the \r\nguidelines of Uniting for Consensus. \r\n Costa Rica is a middle-income country. Thanks to \r\nits commitment to democracy, peace, good governance, \r\nthe efficient use of international cooperation and its \r\ninvestments in health and education, Costa Rica has \r\nachieved high levels of human development. Together \r\nwith other States with similar characteristics, we \r\nexemplify the success of international cooperation as a \r\nkey factor in achieving such results. However, we still \r\nface serious challenges with regard to poverty, income \r\ndistribution, regional differences and the consequences \r\nof the economic crisis and natural disasters, among \r\nothers. \r\n We have been responsible, effective and ethical \r\npartners. We have made progress in development, but \r\nhave still not been able to consolidate it to the point of \r\ndispensing with international assistance. We still need \r\nthat assistance to fully secure our achievements. We \r\nlook forward to the support and understanding of donor \r\ncountries and the institutions of the United Nations, in \r\nparticular the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme. Our relative success should not be \r\npenalized, but bolstered. \r\n Costa Rica has focused on sustainable social and \r\nenvironmental development. We have taken significant \r\nsteps to sustain our growth through clean energy and a \r\nlow-carbon economic model. Our goal is to become \r\none of the first carbon-neutral countries in the world, \r\nand we are working diligently to achieve it. \r\n On that path, in which every local action has \r\nglobal links, we have confidence in the next \r\nConference of the Parties to the United Nations \r\nClimate Change Conference, to be held in Durban at \r\nthe end of the year, and in the coming United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development, planned for \r\nnext year in Rio de Janeiro. However, we are also \r\nconcerned about the lack of progress made in earlier \r\nnegotiations. \r\n I conclude these words by reiterating our deep \r\ncommitment to the principles set out in the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations. I am delighted that yesterday we \r\ncelebrated the thirtieth anniversary of the International \r\nDay of Peace, a Costa Rican initiative that was adopted \r\nby consensus by Member States. It gives me even \r\ngreater pleasure that its theme this year is “Peace and \r\ndemocracy: Make your voice heard”. \r\n As national and international leaders, we should \r\nalways heed the voices of our peoples. We should \r\nlisten to them, respect them and incorporate them in \r\nour initiatives. That is part of our democratic \r\nresponsibility, the basis of good governance, the seed \r\nof meaningful change and the foundation of legitimacy. \r\n As President of Costa Rica, a discrete, noble, \r\nfraternal and free people, I promise not to relent in our \r\nefforts to achieve a better country and a better world. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Costa Rica for the \r\nstatement she has just made. \r\n Ms. Laura Chinchilla Miranda, President of the \r\nRepublic of Costa Rica, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n  The meeting rose at 7.50 p.m. \r\n"
