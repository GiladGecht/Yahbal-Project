(Qatar) \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 7.55 p.m.  \r\n \r\n \r\nHigh-level Meeting of the General Assembly to \r\ncommemorate the tenth anniversary of the adoption \r\nof the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action \r\n \r\nAgenda item 67 (continued) \r\n \r\nElimination of racism, racial discrimination, \r\nxenophobia and related intolerance \r\n \r\n (b) Comprehensive implementation of and follow-\r\nup to the Durban Declaration and Programme \r\nof Action  \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): The General \r\nAssembly will now hear a presentation by His \r\nExcellency The Right Honourable Sibusiso Barnabas \r\nDlamini, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Swaziland \r\nand co-Chair of round table 1, who will present \r\nsummaries of the discussions in the two round tables. \r\n Mr. Dlamini (Swaziland): I am pleased to present \r\nto the General Assembly today the summary of the \r\nfruitful discussion that was held today during the two \r\nround tables on the theme of “Victims of racism, racial \r\ndiscrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance: \r\nrecognition, justice and development”.  \r\n The first round table was co-chaired by me and \r\nby His Excellency Mr. Arvin Boolell, GOSK, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs, Regional Integration and \r\nInternational Trade of Mauritius. The second round \r\ntable was co-chaired by His Excellency Mr. Mohamed \r\nMouldi Kefi, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Tunisia, \r\nand His Excellency Mr. Ricardo Bucio, President of the \r\nNational Council to Prevent Discrimination of Mexico.  \r\n The following experts made presentations during \r\nthe round tables: Mr. Anwar Kemal, Chair of the \r\nCommittee on the Elimination of Racial \r\nDiscrimination; Ms. Edna Maria Santos Roland, \r\nmember of the group of independent eminent experts \r\non the implementation of the Durban Declaration and \r\nProgramme of Action; His Excellency Mr. Mohamed \r\nSiad Douale, Chair of the Intergovernmental Working \r\nGroup on the Effective Implementation of the Durban \r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action; and Ms. Verene \r\nShepherd, member of the Working Group of Experts on \r\nPeople of African Descent. \r\n The participation and engagement of \r\nrepresentatives of civil society during the discussions \r\nwas greatly appreciated. During the discussions, many \r\nspeakers pointed out that the Durban Declaration and \r\nProgramme of Action, together with the outcome \r\ndocument of the 2009 Durban Review Conference, \r\nprovide a very comprehensive and solid framework for \r\ncombating racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia \r\nand related intolerance. \r\n Today there are still millions of victims of \r\nracism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related \r\nintolerance around the world. Victims do not have \r\naccess, for example, to education, employment and \r\nhousing. Migrants and refugees are mistreated just for \r\nbeing different. The Internet is used to disseminate \r\nracist ideas among youth, and such sites promoting \r\nA/66/PV.17  \r\n \r\n11-50877 2 \r\n \r\nracism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related \r\nintolerance should be eliminated. \r\n It was noted that the Durban Declaration and \r\nProgramme of Action provides useful guidance to \r\nGovernments, non-governmental organizations and \r\nother institutions in their efforts to combat racism, \r\nracial discrimination, xenophobia and related \r\nintolerance. However, it is important to ensure its \r\nimplementation. \r\n The importance of the ratification of the \r\nInternational Convention on the Elimination of All \r\nForms of Racial Discrimination and the work of the \r\nCommittee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, \r\nwhich was focused on the needs of vulnerable groups, \r\nsuch as indigenous peoples, immigrants, migrant \r\nworkers, Afro-descendants, Roma and other minorities, \r\nwas emphasized.  \r\n It was stated that in 2001, the international \r\ncommunity focused, for the first time, on victims, \r\nincluding people of African descent, indigenous \r\npeoples, and people of Asian descent, Roma, migrants, \r\nrefugees, displaced people, asylum-seekers, national \r\nand religious minorities, women, youth and children \r\nand victims of trafficking. \r\n The 2001 World Conference against Racism, \r\nRacial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related \r\nIntolerance acknowledged that slavery and the slave \r\ntrade were crimes against humanity, and also included \r\na gender perspective. \r\n Policies are being developed in many countries in \r\nthe areas of education, health, labour, access to land \r\nand housing. Despite achievements, serious problems \r\nremain worldwide. The misuse of technologies to \r\ndisseminate hate and racist ideas is one example. The \r\nneed for data collection was highlighted and an appeal \r\nfor the proclamation of a United Nations decade for \r\nPeople of African descent was made. \r\n Many speakers reaffirmed the importance of the \r\nneed for commitment and political will to realize \r\nhuman rights for all without discrimination. Speakers \r\nalso welcomed the adoption by consensus of the \r\npolitical declaration — the outcome of the High-level \r\nMeeting of the General Assembly to commemorate the \r\ntenth anniversary of the adoption of the Durban \r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action (resolution \r\n66/3). \r\n Speakers also stated that the theme of this event \r\nrightfully focused on victims of racism, racial \r\ndiscrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and \r\nthe need for their recognition and access to justice. A \r\nspeaker noted that achieving justice is often the first \r\nstep towards achieving equality. Some speakers also \r\nstated that the global response to racism should not be \r\nclouded by politics and that it is an obligation and \r\nresponsibility for the international community — \r\nincluding civil society — to collectively work together \r\nto combat racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia \r\nand related intolerance. \r\n They also referred to measures taken at the \r\nnational level, including legislation, policies, \r\nspecialized institutions and programmes to combat \r\nracism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related \r\nintolerance. The importance of human rights education, \r\nawareness-raising campaigns, continued dialogue on \r\nanti-discrimination issues, including interreligious \r\ndialogue, and cooperation with civil society was noted \r\nby a number of speakers.  \r\n The importance of the media to promote a culture \r\nof tolerance and respect for diversity was also noted. \r\nThe fight against racism should not be used to curtail \r\nor limit other rights and should not be an excuse for \r\nrepression. The need to share best practices and to \r\nprovide targeted technical assistance, including with \r\nthe support of the United Nations, in the area of \r\ncombating racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia \r\nand related intolerance was emphasized by speakers. \r\n The importance of fighting poverty, particularly \r\nas articulated in the Millennium Development Goals, \r\nwas stated. The need to integrate the right to \r\ndevelopment in anti-discrimination efforts was also \r\nstated, as was the importance of a human rights-based \r\napproach for sustainable development. \r\n Prominent in the discussion was the issue of \r\ndiscrimination against migrants. It was stated that \r\nmigrants experienced racial abuse, xenophobia, \r\ndiscriminatory labour practices, harsh living \r\nconditions, and trafficking, for example. Concern was \r\nexpressed in various statements about the situation of \r\ngroups in vulnerable situations, such as women, \r\nchildren, refugees and indigenous peoples. Concern \r\nwas also expressed with respect to discrimination \r\nbased on sexual orientation. \r\n The issue of discrimination against religious \r\nminorities and the need to foster harmony and peaceful \r\n A/66/PV.17\r\n \r\n3 11-50877 \r\n \r\ncoexistence of different religions in societies were \r\nemphasized. The rise of right-wing or nationalist \r\nmovements, xenophobic statements by politicians and \r\nother public figures and the dissemination of such \r\nsentiments were highlighted as another important area \r\nof concern. Several speakers referred to people under \r\nforeign occupation and the situation in the occupied \r\nPalestinian territories. The importance of not singling \r\nout a specific region or country was also emphasized. \r\n It was noted that progress had been made but that \r\ngaps persisted. It was emphasized that countering \r\ndiscrimination is a global issue that needs to be tackled \r\nby joint efforts. The importance of economic, social \r\nand cultural rights for the lives of victims was also \r\nnoted. \r\n It was also emphasized that in order to guarantee \r\nthe right against discrimination within a society, the \r\ncreation and strengthening of specialized national \r\nbodies, in accordance with the Durban Declaration and \r\nProgramme of Action, is fundamental. This requires \r\nthat specialized organizations have a broad legal \r\nmandate, funds and appropriate infrastructure that \r\nwould allow them to effectively promote equal \r\nopportunities and treatment among persons of different \r\nsocietal groups. It was stressed that today’s work \r\nshould help us reflect on the necessity of establishing \r\nspecialized national bodies in the fight against racial \r\ndiscrimination, xenophobia and all other forms of \r\ndiscrimination and intolerance. \r\n The need to apologize and to provide reparations \r\nto victims of the trans-Atlantic slave trade was \r\nhighlighted, as was the recommendation to establish a \r\npermanent forum for Africans and people of African \r\ndescent. The proposal to erect a memorial for the \r\nvictims of the trans-Atlantic slave trade was welcomed \r\nby several speakers. \r\n A speaker encouraged Member States to provide \r\ninnovative and effective reparations, including resources to \r\nsupport social programmes to assist people of African \r\ndescent. Monitoring of acts of racist discrimination is \r\nimportant in order to prevent further abuses. \r\n It was further emphasized that the theme of the \r\nevent accurately reflected the essence of the Durban \r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action. It was also \r\nnoted that the Political Declaration adopted during this \r\ncommemorative event will bolster the morale of the \r\nvictims of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia \r\nand related intolerance around the world. Countering \r\nthe mainstreaming of hate speech was defined as \r\nimperative in the fight against racism, racial \r\ndiscrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. \r\n A number of speakers expressed appreciation for \r\nthe work of the Office of the United Nations High \r\nCommissioner for Human Rights and the leadership of the \r\nHigh Commissioner in the domain of anti-discrimination \r\nefforts. Many speakers noted that States should \r\ncontinue to combat racism, racial discrimination, \r\nxenophobia and related intolerance, and called for both \r\nnational and regional processes to be strengthened. \r\nThey also called for reinvigorated political will.  \r\n The tenth anniversary of the Durban Declaration \r\nand Programme of Action represents for many an \r\nopportunity to scale up their efforts and to exchange \r\nideas on how to prevent racism and discrimination and \r\nshare good practices. Several speakers emphasized that \r\nthe tenth anniversary coincided with the International \r\nYear for People of African Descent. In that respect, \r\nsome suggested that a decade for people of African \r\ndescent be proclaimed in 2012. Some called for \r\nestablishing a permanent forum and others called for \r\nproclaiming an international day for people of African \r\ndescent. \r\n A number of speakers also expressed concern \r\nabout the trend of incitement to hatred. A number of \r\nspeakers emphasized that an effective system of \r\nprotection requires improved coordination among \r\nhuman rights mechanisms. There is a also a need to \r\nenhance the performance of the Durban Declaration \r\nand Programme of Action follow-up mechanisms and \r\nto ensure commensurate funding for their activities.  \r\n Several speakers underscored the primary \r\nresponsibility of States for combating racism, racial \r\ndiscrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. \r\nThey also stated that institutional changes and \r\naffirmative action had been implemented to improve \r\nthe lives of victims and groups in vulnerable situations. \r\nStill, a lot remains to be done. The importance of \r\ncountering corruption and ensuring the rule of law was \r\nfurther emphasized.  \r\n Today’s discussion was thoughtful, constructive \r\nand forward-looking. Hopefully this commemoration \r\nwill not remain mere rhetoric and we will all move \r\ntogether towards practical actions. Indeed, as stated in \r\nthe Political Declaration that we adopted by consensus \r\nthis morning, we shall  \r\nA/66/PV.17  \r\n \r\n11-50877 4 \r\n \r\n  “Proclaim together our strong determination \r\nto make the fight against racism, racial \r\ndiscrimination, xenophobia and related \r\nintolerance, and the protection of the victims \r\nthereof, a high priority for our countries.” \r\n(resolution 66/3, para. 12) \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): As we draw to \r\na close this High-level Meeting to commemorate the \r\ntenth anniversary of the adoption of the Durban \r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action, I would like to \r\nextend my sincere gratitude to everyone here for \r\ncoming together to reaffirm our collective commitment \r\nto prevent, combat and eradicate racism, racial \r\ndiscrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance.  \r\n I would also like to express once more my \r\nheartfelt gratitude to the co-facilitators, Ms. Isabelle \r\nPicco, Permanent Representative of Monaco, and \r\nMr. Michel Tommo Monthe, Permanent Representative \r\nof Cameroon, for their exceptional leadership \r\nthroughout the preparations for the High-level \r\nMeeting. Let me also take this opportunity to sincerely \r\nthank the co-Chairs and all of the participants in \r\ntoday’s meeting. I commend the peace-loving Member \r\nStates that supported this process and worked together \r\nto address this serious global challenge.  \r\n Today we have heard about the important work \r\nbeing done worldwide to implement the Durban \r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action. We have also \r\nheard about efforts to make progress towards realizing the \r\nfundamental principles of equality and non-discrimination, \r\nin accordance with international human rights law and \r\nthe relevant instruments.  \r\n Unfortunately, we have also heard that, despite \r\nconcerted efforts, racist attitudes and racial \r\ndiscrimination continue to perpetrate deeply embedded \r\nsocial and economic disparities.  \r\n That rising inequality and discrimination make \r\nthe Durban Declaration and Programme of Action and \r\nthe commitments in the Political Declaration that we \r\nadopted this morning (resolution 66/3) even more \r\nurgent. It is vital that we go further to implement \r\nmeasures to counter intolerance and eradicate advocacy \r\nof hatred, incitement and discrimination. It is vital that \r\nwe do our utmost to promote and strengthen effective \r\ndialogue, which in turn increases understanding within \r\nand among communities and promotes social cohesion. \r\nIt is vital that we unite in our efforts and collaborate \r\nmore intensively in order to effectively combat racism \r\nand other forms of discrimination.  \r\n I firmly believe that the principles of equality and \r\nnon-discrimination are essential for social harmony, for \r\nthe promotion of good governance and the rule of law, \r\nfor sustainable development and for the fair allocation \r\nof resources. It is therefore crucial for the dignity and \r\ndevelopment of the world’s population that we \r\ncontinue to fight the scourge of racism.  \r\n I urge everyone here to continue to speak with \r\none voice, to unite in our efforts and to collaborate \r\nmore intensively, in order to combat racism and to \r\nmake the world a safer, more harmonious place for all.  \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n The High-level Meeting of the General Assembly \r\nto commemorate the tenth anniversary of the adoption \r\nof the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action is \r\nnow concluded. \r\n The General Assembly has thus concluded this \r\nstage of its consideration of sub-item (b) of agenda \r\nitem 67. \r\n  The meeting rose at 8.20 p.m. \r\n"
