(Qatar) \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 9.15 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. John Evans Atta Mills, President of \r\nthe Republic of Ghana \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the \r\nRepublic of Ghana. \r\n Mr. John Evans Atta Mills, President of the \r\nRepublic of Ghana, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. John Evans Atta Mills, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Ghana, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly.  \r\n President Mills: Permit me to extend hearty \r\ncongratulations to you, Sir, on your election as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at this session. May \r\nI also use this opportunity to express our sincere thanks \r\nto your predecessor, Mr. Joseph Deiss, for the able \r\nmanner in which he presided over the sixty-fifth \r\nsession. \r\n Ghana joins the rest of the world in welcoming \r\nour sister country, South Sudan, to the family of the \r\nUnited Nations. It is our fervent hope that South \r\nSudan, having taken its rightful place in this body, will \r\ngrow and prosper. We also want to congratulate the \r\nSecretary-General on his appointment to a second term. \r\nIt is a clear manifestation of his excellent performance \r\nduring his first term. \r\n It is a long-established fact that United Nations \r\npeacekeeping and peacebuilding activities have \r\ncontributed immensely to the Organization’s efforts for \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security \r\nover the years. We observe, however, that this activity \r\ncontinues to take on complex dimensions that require \r\nlong-term planning and urgent reforms in order to \r\nenable the United Nations to tackle the challenges that \r\ncrop up.  \r\n It is in this connection that Ghana reaffirms its \r\nsupport for the ongoing reform agenda being \r\nundertaken by the United Nations in consultation with \r\nthe troop- and police-contributing countries. However, \r\nwe do want to emphasize that regular tripartite \r\nconsultations are needed among the United Nations, \r\nthe Secretariat, the Security Council and the troop- and \r\npolice-contributing countries. \r\n As one of the top contributors of police and \r\ntroops to United Nations activities, Ghana remains \r\nunwavering in its commitment to the ideals and \r\nobjectives of the United Nations. Accordingly, I want \r\nto assure Members that as long as financial, human and \r\nmaterial capacities exist at the national level, Ghana \r\nwill continue to provide troops and police personnel \r\nfor United Nations operations.  \r\n But it is important that the burden and costs to \r\nthe United Nations of these activities be equitably \r\nshared among Member States. We think that countries \r\nsuch as Ghana that provide troops and police personnel \r\nfor these operations must be financially supported by \r\ndonor countries in a timely manner. We are aware of \r\nA/66/PV.19  \r\n \r\n11-51185 2 \r\n \r\nthe financial constraints existing at all national levels, \r\nbut we want to encourage Member States to meet their \r\nobligations to the United Nations so that the \r\nOrganization can execute its mandate. \r\n Allow me to pay tribute to all United Nations \r\npersonnel — including those from my own country, \r\nGhana — who in the course of the year made the \r\nultimate sacrifice while on United Nations \r\npeacekeeping missions. May their souls rest in peace \r\nand their sacrifice be cherished and remembered. \r\n Another issue that we are following with keen \r\ninterest is the proposed arms trade treaty. Ghana fully \r\nsupports this and thinks it is necessary. Hence our \r\nsatisfaction thus far with the outcomes of the meetings \r\nof the Preparatory Committee for the United Nations \r\nConference on the Arms Trade Treaty held in New \r\nYork last year and in February and March this year.  \r\n As a nation, we consider a strong and effective \r\narms trade treaty to be an indispensable step in \r\npreventing the flow of arms to destinations where they \r\ncan cause mayhem and wreak havoc by fuelling \r\nconflicts that may in turn undermine national and \r\nregional peace, security and development, or \r\nexacerbate tensions that in the long run may create \r\nsituations that need the deployment of United Nations \r\npeacekeepers.  \r\n For developing countries such as Ghana, the \r\nillicit proliferation of small arms and light weapons \r\nand other conventional weaponry continues to pose a \r\nserious threat to our national security and to our \r\nsocio-economic and political stability, given the \r\nlinkage to other crimes such as terrorism, organized \r\ncrime, drug trading and indeed human trafficking, \r\namong others. It is therefore imperative that the \r\nremaining meetings of the arms trade treaty \r\nPreparatory Committee produce proposals that would \r\nclose the loopholes that allow the flow of these \r\nweapons from legitimate to illicit markets. \r\n The United Nations reached a significant \r\nmilestone with the launch of UN-Women — the United \r\nNations Entity for Gender Equality and the \r\nEmpowerment of Women. It is critical as member \r\nStates of the international community that we break \r\ngender stereotypes, which after all are the root cause of \r\nthe myriad of gender-inequality challenges facing us \r\nthroughout the world. Ghana’s efforts are focused on \r\naddressing gender imbalances and misconceptions and \r\non improving the living conditions of women and girls, \r\nbearing in mind that in solving the gender issue we \r\nwould be taking concrete steps towards the attainment \r\nof a majority of the Millennium Development Goals. It \r\nis our expectation that the objectives of UN-Women \r\nwill be met. \r\n On the occasion of the High-level Meeting to \r\ncommemorate the tenth anniversary of the Durban \r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action, Ghana \r\nrecognizes the progress so far made in this area by the \r\nopportunity given to Member States to reaffirm and \r\nstrengthen their political commitment to the prevention \r\nof and fight against racism and racial discrimination in \r\nall its forms. We are confident that the effective \r\nimplementation of the outcome policy (see resolution \r\n66/3) will indeed ensure the enjoyment of human rights \r\nand fundamental freedoms by all, including the victims \r\nof racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and \r\nrelated intolerance, in all societies. \r\n It is noteworthy that the High-level Meeting of \r\nthe General Assembly on the Prevention and Control of \r\nNon-communicable Diseases focused on the developmental \r\ndrawbacks and socio-economic impact on developing \r\ncountries where the relevant facilities are not available. \r\nIndeed, we are of the opinion that the effective \r\nprevention and control of non-communicable diseases \r\nnot only helps to reduce poverty but also decreases \r\nhealth-care costs, thereby improving productivity and \r\nultimately helping with rapid economic development.  \r\n Efforts in Ghana to improve the health-care \r\nsystem include the completion of the health-care \r\ninfrastructure in several parts of the country, the \r\nscaling-up of the National Ambulance Service to cover \r\nall districts and the training of emergency medical \r\ntechnicians. We have re-engineered our policies in \r\norder to give more meaning to health-care delivery. \r\n Ghana recognizes and appreciates the \r\ncontribution of youth to nation-building and the growth \r\nand sustenance of our democracy. We believe that the \r\nadoption of the political declaration urging Member \r\nStates to adopt comprehensive plans and measures to \r\ngive meaning to youth development is commendable, \r\nespecially since this is the International Year of Youth. \r\nIn Ghana we are implementing policies that are \r\nintended to situate young men and women in the centre \r\nof nation-building.  \r\n One of the main reasons for our relentless fight \r\nagainst drug trafficking is to ensure that we secure the \r\nfuture of our young men and women, who, after all, \r\n A/66/PV.19\r\n \r\n3 11-51185 \r\n \r\nwill be the future leaders of our dear nations. As we \r\ncontinue to invest heavily in our youth by expanding \r\neducational opportunities and making it possible for \r\nthe disadvantaged to have access to formal schooling, \r\nwe believe we are laying the right foundation. The \r\nprovision of free school uniforms, free exercise books \r\nand the elimination of more than one thousand schools \r\nunder trees, turning them into brick-and-mortar \r\nstructures, should be ample evidence of our \r\ndetermination to brighten the future of youth. Certainly \r\nGhana’s oil and gas find should present us with a \r\ngreater opportunity to create the conditions under \r\nwhich we will be able to create more jobs to solve \r\nyouth unemployment in our country. \r\n Climate change is the defining human \r\ndevelopment challenge of the twenty-first century and \r\none of the greatest threats to sustainable development \r\nin Africa. Although as a continent we contribute only \r\n4 per cent of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions, we \r\nare the most vulnerable when it comes to climate \r\nchange. Therefore urgent and concerted action is \r\nneeded to enable us to maximize the opportunity that \r\nclimate change offers. \r\n We believe that with the right investments in \r\ntechnology, institutions and infrastructure by the \r\ninternational community and nation-States, we will be \r\nable to unleash the potential of agriculture, harness the \r\nmaximum benefit from water resources, expand access \r\nto modern energy sources, fight diseases and conserve \r\ntropical forests.  \r\n As we move closer to the climate change \r\nnegotiations scheduled for Durban, South Africa, it is \r\nour expectation that the critical political questions that \r\ncould not be answered during the United Nations \r\nClimate Change Conference at Cancún will be \r\naddressed. With regard to mitigation, we believe that \r\nwe need political commitment, a high sense of \r\nflexibility and strong leadership to ensure that at the \r\nDurban Conference the second round of commitments \r\nunder the Kyoto Protocol will be addressed or some \r\ntransitional arrangement made.  \r\n Again with regard to mitigation, we believe that \r\nall pledged commitments and actions should be \r\nquantified, monitored and verified by the international \r\ncommunity. We commend the obvious progress made \r\nin the design of the institutions of adaptation, such as \r\nthe Green Climate Fund. What remains to be done is to \r\ndetermine the sources of funding for the Fund and also \r\nto empower the Conference of Parties to the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change to \r\nhave control over the Green Climate Fund. \r\n On the political and security fronts, Ghana \r\nnotices a paradigm shift, or at least a shift in emphasis, \r\nfrom national security to human security. We agree that \r\ninterventions targeted on human security will \r\neventually define our national security. We are \r\ntherefore implementing measures that will help us \r\nmake this concept take form through the adoption of \r\nthe necessary legislative measures, institutions and \r\nreforms. We are taking steps to expand our adherence \r\nto the rule of law, the promotion of transparency and \r\ngood governance, the maintenance of the independence \r\nand integrity of the judiciary, and the promotion of a \r\nfree media. We also subscribe to the global norm of the \r\nresponsibility to protect, and we promise to work hand \r\nin glove with member countries, the United Nations \r\nand others to achieve this. \r\n A little over a year from now Ghana will be going \r\nto the polls to elect a President and Members of \r\nParliament for another four years. To ensure that the \r\nelections are free, fair, transparent and credible, our \r\nElectoral Commission — which has successfully organized \r\nthe last three elections, since the year 2000 — has put in \r\nplace the necessary measures to enable Ghanaians to \r\nmake their choices in a free atmosphere. Our \r\ndemocratic credentials stand tall, and we would not \r\nwant anything to affect the standard that we have \r\nachieved. \r\n Just as the United Nations and the rest of the \r\ninternational community kept an eye on the 2008 \r\nelections in Ghana, I should like to invite you, \r\nMr. President, and all others to come and do the same \r\nin connection with the 2012 elections. We want to \r\nmake sure that people are given the right to vote and \r\nchoose their own leaders, instead of having leaders \r\nimposed on them or come in through unauthorized \r\nmeans. \r\n Finally, I wish to reaffirm Ghana’s total \r\ncommitment to the aims, objectives and ideals of the \r\nUnited Nations. I also want to advocate that all \r\nMember States muster the necessary political will to \r\nensure that the United Nations functions more \r\neffectively.  \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Ghana for the statement he has just made. \r\nA/66/PV.19  \r\n \r\n11-51185 4 \r\n \r\n Mr. John Evans Atta Mills, President of the \r\nRepublic of Ghana, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Jalal Talabani, President of the \r\nRepublic of Iraq \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the \r\nRepublic of Iraq. \r\n Mr. Jalal Talabani, President of the Republic of \r\nIraq, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Jalal Talabani, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Iraq, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly. \r\n President Talabani (spoke in Arabic): Allow me \r\nat the outset to congratulate you, Sir, and our brothers, \r\nthe people of Qatar, on your election to the presidency \r\nof the sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly. Our \r\ndelegation will be of assistance to you in the \r\nperformance of your duties, and we are confident that \r\nyour experience and wisdom will be an important \r\nfactor in the success of the Assembly’s work. Our \r\nthanks also go to your predecessor, Mr. Joseph Deiss, \r\nfor his presidency of the General Assembly at its \r\noutgoing session. I should also like to warmly \r\ncongratulate the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, \r\non his appointment to a second term and wish him \r\nevery success in his work. \r\n It is an honour to stand in front of the Assembly \r\none more time to brief members on the most notable \r\ndevelopments that Iraq is witnessing as it works on \r\nbuilding a modern State that lives in peace and security \r\nwith its people and its neighbours. Iraq is building a \r\nhomeland where everyone lives in peace and stability \r\nregardless of sectarian, ethnic or factional affiliations; \r\na system where the rule of law prevails and human \r\nrights are respected; and a system that is based on \r\ndemocracy and the peaceful alternation of power. That \r\nis the basis for the path on which we have embarked \r\nand are continually implementing.  \r\n The events currently taking place in the Arab \r\nregion have proved the rightness of the path that we \r\nhave been following. The values of change and reform, \r\nwhich Iraq has called and will continue to call for, have \r\nbecome an essential part of the aspirations of the Arab \r\npeople for freedom and for their ability to choose their \r\nown political system on the basis of democracy and \r\nhuman rights.  \r\n We have come a long way in building our \r\npolitical system, which is based on the National \r\nCollaboration Government. Iraq has started to restore \r\nthe elements of strength that were lost due to more than \r\nthree decades of internal and external wars conducted \r\nby the former dictatorship, due also to the international \r\nisolation and the sanctions that Iraq experienced and to \r\nthe collapse of security institutions and outbreak of \r\nsectarian strife that threatened its national existence \r\nafter the collapse of the former regime. We began to \r\novercome these negative elements and they became \r\nhistory, thanks to our determination and steadfastness \r\nand with the help and support of the international \r\ncommunity. \r\n With regard to development, having witnessed \r\nthe big improvement in security in Iraq, we are still \r\nrelying on the five-year plan for the years 2010-2014 \r\nannounced by the Iraqi Government on 4 April 2010 \r\nand on the licensing rounds held between Iraq and \r\nmajor companies on oil and natural gas investments to \r\nimprove our oil industry. That was done to turn the \r\nwheels of development and push the economy to \r\nadvanced levels.  \r\n It is expected that the five-year plan that has \r\nalready started will include about 2,700 strategic \r\nprojects in different sectors, with a cost of $186 billion. \r\nThe plan would provide about four million job \r\nopportunities, which will positively deal with the \r\nunemployment problem in Iraq. It is hoped that by the \r\nend of this plan, the per capita income of Iraqi citizens \r\nwill have increased to $8,000 annually and poverty \r\nlevels will have decreased by 16 per cent. \r\n In addition, we were able to get rid of the \r\nsanctions and restrictions imposed on Iraq as a result of \r\nthe invasion of Kuwait. On the basis of Security \r\nCouncil resolutions 1956 (2010), 1957 (2010) and \r\n1958 (2010), adopted on 15 December 2010, Iraq has \r\nbeen freed completely from all the restrictions imposed \r\non it, which had prevented the country from taking \r\nadvantage of scientific and technological advances, and \r\nhas gained sovereignty over its financial resources.  \r\n After that important stage in building our State, \r\nwe feel that we are taking firm steps on the road to \r\ndemocracy and development and that we are opening \r\n A/66/PV.19\r\n \r\n5 11-51185 \r\n \r\nthe doors to investment in Iraq. Therefore, the \r\neconomic policy of Iraq is essentially based on \r\nencouraging investment and providing the appropriate \r\nlegislative environment to protect investors and their \r\ncapital so that Iraq can become a safe and fertile \r\ninvesting environment in many essential sectors, such \r\nas oil, natural gas, electricity, reconstruction, \r\ninfrastructure and other economic sectors. From this \r\nrostrum I call on all countries to open collaboration \r\nchannels with Iraq in the field of investment and to \r\ntake advantage of the available opportunities.  \r\n Iraqi Kurdistan has witnessed important \r\ndevelopments in the fields of construction, the \r\neconomy, the culture and others. Thousands of villages \r\nthat were destroyed by the former regime have been \r\nrebuilt. Cities, towns and roadways have been \r\nmodernized. The region now has more than 15 public \r\nand private universities with more than 100,000 \r\nstudents, compared to the past when there was only one \r\nuniversity with a few thousand students. \r\n At the end of this year the United States forces \r\nwill withdraw, according to the agreement signed \r\nbetween the two countries in 2008. During this year, \r\nour security forces have shown a great ability to \r\ncombat terrorism and provide security. These forces are \r\ncapable and will efficiently fill the vacuum that the \r\nwithdrawal of the United States forces will create. That \r\nwill promote Iraqi national abilities to maintain the \r\ngains achieved in the new Iraq.  \r\n However, the need will push the Government of \r\nIraq to keep numbers of American experts and others in \r\norder to benefit from their experience in the fields of \r\ntraining and capacity-building, according to Iraq’s \r\nneeds. On this occasion, on behalf of the Government \r\nand people of Iraq, I should like to express our thanks \r\nand appreciation to the United States, other friendly \r\nStates and the United Nations that provided assistance \r\nand support to the Iraqi people and Government in \r\norder to enhance democracy and reconstruction.  \r\n I avail myself of the opportunity of being here in \r\nNew York to express to the people of New York and to \r\nall Americans feelings of sympathy and solidarity on \r\nthe tenth anniversary of the terrorist attacks on \r\n11 September. \r\n Regarding Iraq’s international and regional \r\nrelations, the Constitution of Iraq and the national \r\nprogramme of the current Iraqi Government determine \r\nthe general foundations for our foreign policy. They \r\nprovide that Iraq is a founding and effective member of \r\nthe League of Arab States and is committed to its \r\nCharter. Iraq is also a member of the Islamic world. On \r\nthis basis Iraq is working to host the Arab summit at \r\nthe end of March 2012.  \r\n Moreover, Iraq respects the principles of good \r\nneighbourliness and is committed to non-interference \r\nin the internal affairs of other States. It seeks to solve \r\ndisputes by peaceful means, establishes its relations on \r\nthe basis of common interests and reciprocity, and \r\nrespects its international obligations. That is why we \r\ninvite our two neighbours, Turkey and the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran, to resort to diplomacy and positive \r\ndialogue in order to solve the issues and to stop \r\nbombing Iraqi territories in the Kurdistan region, \r\nwhich is causing many innocent civilian victims. I \r\navail myself of this opportunity to thank His Holiness \r\nKhamenei of the Islamic Republic of Iran for releasing \r\nthe two American prisoners in Iran. \r\n With regard to our obligations to disarmament \r\nand nuclear non-proliferation, the Constitution of Iraq \r\nwas clear in determining the position of Iraq \r\nconcerning this issue. Article 9 E of the Iraqi \r\nConstitution provides that \r\n “The Iraqi Government shall respect and \r\nimplement Iraq’s international obligations \r\nregarding the non-proliferation, non-development, \r\nnon-production, and non-use of nuclear, \r\nchemical, and biological weapons, and shall \r\nprohibit associated equipment, materiel, \r\ntechnologies, and delivery systems for use in the \r\ndevelopment, manufacture, production, and use \r\nof such weapons.” \r\nOn this clear position and commitment of Iraq to \r\ninternational instruments concerning disarmament, the \r\nSecurity Council on 15 December 2010 adopted \r\nresolution 1957 (2010), which lifted all restrictions that \r\nwere imposed on Iraq.  \r\n In this context we wish to confirm the legitimate \r\nright of States to the peaceful use of nuclear power and \r\nits technologies according to the rules and provisions \r\nof the relevant international conventions. This right \r\nconstitutes one of the foundations of the disarmament \r\nsystem and non-proliferation. Within this approach and \r\nwith regard to the nuclear issue concerning the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran, we believe in the legitimate right of \r\nStates to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. \r\nThat right is guaranteed by international instruments, at \r\nA/66/PV.19  \r\n \r\n11-51185 6 \r\n \r\nthe forefront of which is the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.  \r\n We affirm the importance of reaching a peaceful \r\nsolution in dealing with this issue. Dialogue and calm \r\ndiplomacy are the best means to achieve that goal. On \r\nthe other hand, any escalation will prejudice the \r\ninterests of all parties and will put the security of the \r\nregion at great risk. \r\n Iraq is concerned about the tragic situation of the \r\nbrotherly Palestinian people as a result of Israeli \r\npractices, which are incompatible with international \r\nlaws, customs and international humanitarian law. Iraq \r\nis doing everything in its power to support the struggle \r\nof the Palestinian people to obtain all their inalienable \r\nrights, in particular the right to establish an \r\nindependent State in its homeland, with its capital in \r\nJerusalem.  \r\n In this regard, Iraq endorses and supports the path \r\nembarked on by the Palestinian Authority to come to \r\nthe United Nations to achieve full international \r\nrecognition of a Palestinian State during the current \r\nsession of the General Assembly. Iraq calls on the \r\ninternational community and all peace-loving forces to \r\nstand by the Palestinian people in their legitimate \r\nstruggle to achieve their goals and demands that the \r\nIsraeli Government fully withdraw from all Arab \r\nterritories occupied in 1967. That would essentially \r\ncontribute to the settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict \r\nand bring a comprehensive and just peace to this vital \r\nregion of the world.  \r\n Making the Middle East an area free of weapons \r\nof mass destruction is crucial to achieve peace, security \r\nand stability. That requires Israel to join the Treaty on \r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to put \r\nits nuclear facilities under the comprehensive \r\nsafeguards system of the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency. \r\n The countries of the Arab world are witnessing \r\nsignificant developments and unprecedented reforms \r\nand political changes, the effects of which will be \r\nreflected in the future of the whole region and will \r\nextend to areas beyond. Iraq, as an early actor in \r\ninitiating this change, supports the struggle of the Arab \r\npeople of the region to gain their freedom, choose their \r\npolitical systems and exercise their right to peaceful \r\ndemonstrations and protests in the so-called Arab \r\nSpring. We hope that these changes will contribute to \r\nregional stability and security and avoid anything that \r\nmight threaten the unity and sovereignty of the \r\ncountries of the region or stir up strife or sectarian and \r\nethnic conflicts. \r\n In the area of international cooperation, Iraq will \r\nwork to promote cooperation with all countries that \r\nstood with it and supported it in the stability of the \r\nongoing political process, in strengthening it and in \r\nreconstruction. We refer here to the United States of \r\nAmerica and to the European Union. When we mention \r\nthese two parties we mention them not because they \r\nare the only ones that stood with Iraq, but because we \r\nare linked by mechanisms of action that should be \r\nimplemented. There are many other friends who stood \r\nwith us in the difficult times that we have experienced, \r\nand we will remember that favour and develop \r\nrelations of cooperation with them.  \r\n After the withdrawal of the United States forces \r\nfrom Iraq by the end of this year, we will work to \r\nenhance and expand the scope of cooperation on the \r\nbasis of the strategic framework agreement signed \r\nbetween the two countries in 2008. According to that \r\nagreement, relations will be for the long term and will \r\ncover all aspects of life.  \r\n The same is true for the European Union. After \r\nfinishing the drafting of the Partnership and \r\nCooperation Agreement between Iraq and the European \r\nUnion and its possible signing in the near future, and \r\nsigning a memorandum of understanding on the \r\nstrategic partnership in the field of energy between Iraq \r\nand the European Union, the cooperation between the \r\ntwo parties will take a broader scope in various fields \r\ncovered by those agreements.  \r\n Our economic, commercial and political relations \r\nwith the People’s Republic of China are expanding and \r\nimproving. Our relations with neighbouring Arab \r\ncountries, India and Pakistan, are also constantly \r\nimproving. \r\n Regarding our relationship with the United \r\nNations, we will continue an approach of constructive \r\ncooperation with all United Nations bodies, in the \r\nforefront of which are the Security Council and the \r\nSecretariat, and we will keep the commitments we have \r\nmade.  \r\n I should like to take this opportunity to express \r\nmy appreciation for the efforts by Special Representative of \r\nthe Secretary-General Mr. Ad Melkert throughout his time \r\nin Iraq. I wish him and his family success and good \r\n A/66/PV.19\r\n \r\n7 11-51185 \r\n \r\nhealth. I welcome the new representative of the \r\nSecretary-General. We will continue to cooperate with \r\nhim in a way that will enable him to carry out his task \r\nin accordance with Security Council resolution 1770 \r\n(2007) and subsequent resolutions.  \r\n The United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq \r\nwill receive all forms of support and assistance from \r\nus, in particular during the next phase, and we will do \r\nour utmost to provide the necessary protection for its \r\nstaff and premises. \r\n We look forward with confidence and optimism \r\nto the future. Iraq is an emerging democracy and a \r\ncountry brimming with a wealth of natural and human \r\nresources. We are working to make it an important \r\nfactor in regional stability, security and prosperity and \r\na living example of democracy, federalism and the \r\nvoluntary coexistence of different ethnic and sectarian \r\ngroups and communities.  \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of \r\nthe Republic of Iraq for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Jalal Talabani, President of the Republic of \r\nIraq, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Václav Klaus, President of the \r\nCzech Republic \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Czech Republic. \r\n Mr. Václav Klaus, President of the Czech \r\nRepublic, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Václav Klaus, President of \r\nthe Czech Republic, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly. \r\n President Klaus: Allow me to congratulate you, \r\nSir, on your election to the very important post of the \r\nhighest representative of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-sixth session. \r\n A few days ago New York City and the entire \r\nworld remembered the tenth anniversary of the tragic \r\nevents of 11 September. I should like to use this \r\nopportunity to pay homage to all the victims and to the \r\nfirefighters and other rescue workers who died in \r\nconnection with the 2001 attacks. We should not forget \r\nthem. \r\n The main topic suggested for the sixty-sixth \r\nsession — the mediation of disputes by peaceful \r\nmeans — is at the very core of the United Nations \r\nCharter, and I can assure members it is also at the core \r\nof the foreign policy principles of the country I have \r\nthe privilege to represent, the Czech Republic.  \r\n Mr. Bowler (Malawi), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n Nineteen years ago the dissolution of \r\nCzechoslovakia was negotiated peacefully from within, \r\nwithout any need for external mediation. Our \r\nexperience tells us that if a solution to any country’s \r\naspirations to sovereignty and freedom, or a solution to \r\na dispute among countries, is to be lasting and \r\nacceptable for the citizens of those countries, that \r\nsolution must primarily come from within the region \r\nitself and from the negotiations of the countries \r\nconcerned. In the same spirit, the Czech Republic is \r\nconvinced, with regard to the most important issue of \r\nthis session of the General Assembly, that it is \r\nnecessary for the two sides in the Israeli-Palestinian \r\ndispute to find a way forward themselves.  \r\n I agree with President Obama that there is no \r\nshortcut to ending a conflict that has endured for \r\ndecades. It requires that both sides take an innovative \r\napproach and overcome some old, inflexible and rigid \r\nschemes of thought. It requires both sides to negotiate \r\nand to find a balanced solution that will last. Such a \r\nsolution cannot come through unilateral steps, neither \r\nthose forced by the United Nations nor the steps taken \r\nby one side of the dispute only.  \r\n The Czech Republic successfully completed the \r\ntransition from communism to democracy, and, based \r\non that experience, we wish the countries of North \r\nAfrica to make progress in the same direction. We \r\nknow it is not an easy path. To remove several leading \r\npoliticians is not the crucial aspect of the much-needed \r\nsystemic change.  \r\n When the Iron Curtain fell in Europe more than \r\n20 years ago, I used to talk about three mutually \r\ninterconnected preconditions for successful \r\ntransformation: a clear and transparent concept of \r\nwhere to go, a feasible strategy how to get there, and to \r\nbe able to motivate the citizens of the country to \r\nA/66/PV.19  \r\n \r\n11-51185 8 \r\n \r\npromote it. I still do not see these preconditions in \r\nsome of the countries of North Africa.  \r\n By saying that, I want to stress that the systemic \r\nchange cannot be agreed upon or prearranged at \r\ninternational conferences. It cannot be mediated or \r\npassively acquired as a foreign investment. It is a \r\ndomestic task and a sequence of policies, not a once-\r\nfor-all policy change.  \r\n There is something we can do, however. We can \r\nand should increase our efforts to cooperate with the \r\ncountries of North Africa. We should not forget that \r\nthere is a complementarity between freedom and trade. \r\nOur relations — and now I speak especially about us, \r\nthe European Union member States — with the \r\ncountries of North Africa should be based on free \r\ntrade, which means on trade with a minimum of \r\nregulation and arbitrary standards. Prosperity in the \r\ncountries of North Africa is a guarantee of stability and \r\nis also a precondition for preventing growing migration \r\nto the countries in Southern and Western Europe. \r\n I should also like to mention another issue that I \r\nsee as crucial, that of nuclear energy. I welcome the \r\nfact that the Secretary-General called for a special \r\nmeeting on this topic. The Czech Republic pays the \r\nhighest possible attention to nuclear safety and security \r\nand supports the further development of nuclear \r\nenergy.  \r\n What happened in Japan in March this year was a \r\nserious natural catastrophe, and there are certainly \r\nlessons to be learned from it. The main lesson is \r\nobvious. Even coastal locations, which are seen as \r\nseismically stable for urban planning, can be affected \r\nby earthquakes far away under the sea. Nuclear power \r\nplants should be built in locations that are the least \r\nprone to damage by natural disasters. Yet after the \r\ntsunami hit the Fukushima power plant, some \r\nGovernments decided not to build new nuclear power \r\nplants and some even to abandon nuclear energy as \r\nsuch.  \r\n Speaking for the Czech Republic, we consider \r\nthat what happened in Fukushima did not by any means \r\nquestion the arguments for nuclear energy. These \r\narguments are strong, economically rational and \r\nconvincing. Nuclear power is a stable, legitimate and, \r\nin some countries, irreplaceable source of energy \r\ntoday. \r\n Let me conclude by saying that the Czech \r\nRepublic continues to support the much-needed reform \r\nof the Security Council. The world has changed \r\nconsiderably since the United Nations Charter was \r\nsigned. New countries must take greater responsibility \r\nfor this Organization and for its financing.  \r\n This year the Czech Republic holds the \r\npresidency of the Executive Board of the United \r\nNations Development Programme, which supports \r\nprojects in 177 countries. We support that Programme \r\nbut want to stress that in order for developing countries \r\nto develop, all kinds of unnecessary barriers, standards, \r\nregulations and other constraints in the developed \r\nworld must first be removed.  \r\n I wish the President every success in his office \r\nand assure him that the Czech Republic will continue \r\nto be an active Member of the United Nations.  \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Czech \r\nRepublic for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Václav Klaus, President of the Czech \r\nRepublic, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov, \r\nPresident of Turkmenistan \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of Turkmenistan. \r\n Mr. Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov, President of \r\nTurkmenistan, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov, \r\nPresident of Turkmenistan, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly. \r\n President Berdimuhamedov (spoke in Russian): \r\nI sincerely greet all gathered here and offer \r\ncongratulations on the opening of the sixty-sixth \r\nsession of the General Assembly. I congratulate His \r\nExcellency Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on his election \r\nas President of the General Assembly at this session \r\nand express confidence that the Assembly under his \r\nleadership will work successfully and fruitfully. \r\n Allow me to convey my gratitude to Mr. Joseph \r\nDeiss, President at the sixty-fifth session, for his \r\n A/66/PV.19\r\n \r\n9 11-51185 \r\n \r\neffective activity in this post. In availing myself of this \r\nopportunity I should also like once again to \r\ncongratulate Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his reappointment to \r\nthe post of Secretary-General and wish him great \r\nsuccess. \r\n As in past years, this forum is the continuation of \r\nthe process of forming suitable approaches to the \r\ncomplex phenomena of the modern world — in other \r\nwords, a search for appropriate answers to questions \r\nhaving global significance. It becomes more and more \r\nevident that there is a demand for systemic measures \r\nbased on a clear definition of goals, a vision of their \r\npossible implementation and a choice of effective \r\ninternational mechanisms.  \r\n Turkmenistan formulates these goals as follows: \r\npeace through development. Today these concepts \r\ncannot be considered separately. The direct connection \r\nbetween peace and development is exactly what opens \r\nwide possibilities for the consolidation of political will \r\nand the intellectual and material resources of the \r\ncommunity of nations. That is important in order to \r\nestablish sustainable, stable and, at the same time, \r\nflexible and balanced modern systems of international \r\nties in politics, economics and in the humanitarian \r\nsphere.  \r\n We are convinced that this large-scale issue and \r\nthe responsibility for its implementation lie first and \r\nforemost with the United Nations. Turkmenistan acts \r\naccordingly in forming its approaches to the issues of \r\nachieving a firm peace and security, implementing the \r\ndevelopment goals and realizing humanitarian \r\ncooperation.  \r\n Considering that a fundamental condition for \r\nensuring long-term peace and strategic stability is to \r\nefficiently abide by the United Nations Charter, \r\nTurkmenistan pursues a steady and purposeful policy \r\nof peace and good-neighbourliness and actively \r\nencourages peaceful processes. We absolutely reject \r\nmilitary force as an instrument of foreign policy and \r\nintergovernmental relations. We believe that solutions \r\nthrough armed force do not offer prospects for success, \r\ndo not eliminate sources of and reasons for clashes or \r\ncontradictions, and in most cases do not create \r\nconditions for supplying appropriate answers to many \r\nquestions that arise in post-conflict periods.  \r\n Turkmenistan attaches paramount importance to \r\nthe settlement of any situation by peaceful means and \r\nmethods. In that connection and in compliance with the \r\nfundamental documents of the United Nations, we \r\nsuggest that at this session the Assembly start to \r\ndevelop a declaration on the critical introduction of \r\npolitical and diplomatic tools for the resolution of \r\ninternational issues, with further consideration at \r\nsubsequent sessions. To our way of thinking, adopting \r\nsuch a declaration would allow for a considerable \r\ndecrease in the probability of the use of force to \r\nresolve clashes in intergovernmental relations. It would \r\nhelp to reduce the risks concerned and threats to \r\ngeneral stability and security.  \r\n At the regional level, we have proposed a number \r\nof initiatives on maintaining peace and stability in \r\nCentral Asia and in the Caspian basin. These initiatives \r\nwere welcomed positively. In our opinion, the next step \r\nmust be taken, namely, to arrange a representative \r\nforum on security in Central Asia and the Caspian Sea \r\nregion. Turkmenistan suggests hosting this event next \r\nyear. We believe that the establishment of an advisory \r\ncouncil on peaceful development in Central Asia and \r\nthe Caspian Sea region may emerge as one of the \r\npolitical outcomes of that forum. \r\n In talking of the necessity to ensure security on a \r\nglobal scale, we do not mean only its political \r\ncomponent. Global security is considered as a \r\ncomprehensive whole, based on indivisibility and a \r\nwhole range of key factors that define the vectors of \r\ntoday’s worldwide development. That involves the \r\nsolution of economic, energy, ecological, food and \r\nhumanitarian issues.  \r\n Today it is obvious that global security cannot be \r\nprovided unless peace and consent at national and \r\nregional levels are reached. Therefore Turkmenistan \r\naims its efforts at the maximum promotion of the \r\nprocesses of sustainable development, attaining the \r\nMillennium Development Goals and creating efficient \r\nmodels of multilateral reciprocal action for the solution \r\nof urgent international issues.  \r\n A reliable and stable transit of energy resources \r\non the international market is one of the issues at hand. \r\nOur proposals on the matter received support from the \r\nworld community and were reflected in General \r\nAssembly resolution 63/210, adopted in 2008. I believe \r\nthat the time has come to start developing concrete \r\nmeasures on the resolution of energy transport issues. \r\n With a view to joining the efforts of the Member \r\nStates that are taking an active part in the development \r\nof an international legal foundation in the sphere of \r\nA/66/PV.19  \r\n \r\n11-51185 10 \r\n \r\nenergy supply, Turkmenistan considers it appropriate to \r\ncreate a new mechanism, transparent and open to all: \r\nan interregional energy dialogue under the aegis of the \r\nUnited Nations, supposing that the Organization would \r\nactively promote establishment of an essential format \r\nof cooperation. We see the States of Central and South \r\nAsia, the Caspian, the Black Sea and Baltic regions, \r\nRussia, China, the European Union and the countries of \r\nthe Middle and Near East — all States, companies and \r\ninternational financial institutions concerned — being \r\namong its participants. The acknowledgment by United \r\nNations Member States of the general nature of the \r\nlong-term goals of development and a readiness to \r\nachieve their implementation jointly act today as \r\ndetermining factors for the sustainability of the global \r\neconomic system. \r\n The serious effects of the worldwide financial \r\nand economic crisis have clearly demonstrated once \r\nagain the need to unite efforts to form viable models \r\nand realistic plans, taking account of the interests and \r\nneeds of all States of the world. Turkmenistan will take \r\nan active part in this process and will contribute to the \r\nexchange of successful experiences gained by our \r\ncountry on a number of fronts involving economic and \r\nsocial development.  \r\n We are ready to do this through the relevant \r\nUnited Nations structures, first of all the Economic and \r\nSocial Council. Our country submits its candidature for \r\nmembership in that authoritative body for the term of \r\n2013-2015. We are preparing for the work in this body, \r\nand, if elected, Turkmenistan will spare no efforts to \r\nsuccessfully implement the tasks entrusted. \r\n Turkmenistan will also take part in the Rio+20 \r\nEarth Summit in 2012. We see it as a landmark event in \r\nthe process of making progress towards sustainable \r\ndevelopment objectives. We intend to announce a \r\nnumber of specific proposals at that forum.  \r\n With regard to maintaining sustainable economic \r\ngrowth, I should like to dwell on a crucial component, \r\nnamely, the creation of a modern transport \r\ninfrastructure.  \r\n Over the years our country, together with partners \r\nin the region, has been actively working on the \r\nimplementation of major projects to optimize traffic \r\nflow in the Eurasian sphere. We believe this is a very \r\npromising area, given the huge potential of the north-\r\nsouth and east-west corridors. It is important that those \r\ncorridors, which could give a powerful impetus to \r\neconomic development and trade relations on a \r\ncontinental scale, be used effectively. We believe that \r\nthe United Nations could play an important role in \r\ncoordinating the establishment of international \r\ncooperation in the field of transport.  \r\n In that regard, Turkmenistan suggests that there \r\nbe an initiative, during the current session, to start \r\ndeveloping a United Nations special programme on the \r\ndevelopment of transport, including the study of transit \r\nand transport opportunities between the Caspian and \r\nBlack Seas and between Central Asia and the Middle \r\nEast. \r\n Turkmenistan sees the environmental sphere as a \r\nkey area for international cooperation. We respect the \r\ninitiatives and decisions taken at the summits on \r\nclimate change in Copenhagen and Cancun. We are \r\nlooking forward to continuing a constructive \r\ninternational dialogue on this issue in November this \r\nyear at the meeting in Durban. We are convinced of the \r\nneed to join efforts in this field at the global, regional \r\nand national levels and to coordinate the actions of \r\neach United Nations Member State. In that connection \r\nI should like to emphasize that Turkmenistan is \r\ncurrently preparing an extensive document, the \r\nNational Strategy on Climate Change. After the \r\nadoption of the Strategy we will be ready to submit it \r\nto the relevant United Nations agencies as a \r\ncontribution to our common work. We believe that it \r\nwill be possible, during the current session and in the \r\ncontext of closer multilateral cooperation, to start \r\nestablishing systemic machinery in this area. To that \r\nend, Turkmenistan proposes establishing a specialized \r\ninstitution — a United Nations interregional centre on \r\ndevelopment and issues related to climate change. We \r\nare willing to provide for its functioning with all the \r\nnecessary infrastructure in the capital of Turkmenistan, \r\nAshgabat. \r\n A most important question that goes far beyond \r\nregional boundaries is the environment of the Caspian \r\nSea. Here we are also convinced of the need to give \r\nspecific content to international efforts to preserve the \r\nunique natural resources of the Caspian Sea. In that \r\nregard we propose organizing a Caspian environmental \r\nforum as a permanent body to deal with environmental \r\nissues in the Caspian basin, as well as to make \r\nappropriate proposals and recommendations. \r\n Achieving sustainable development is directly \r\nrelated to the resolution of humanitarian issues, support \r\n A/66/PV.19\r\n \r\n11 11-51185 \r\n \r\nfor natural human rights, and opportunities for \r\nindividuals to achieve personal fulfilment and for \r\npeople to lead valuable lives. In that regard our country \r\nwill continue its cooperation with United Nations \r\nhumanitarian bodies for further implementation of \r\nUnited Nations conventions in the field of human \r\nrights. As a permanent member of the Executive \r\nCommittee of the Office of the High Commissioner for \r\nRefugees (UNHCR), Turkmenistan will actively \r\npromote the implementation of practical measures \r\naimed at protecting and supporting refugees. We have \r\nfound it useful, in working with UNHCR, to study our \r\nexperience in granting citizenship to refugees and \r\nstateless persons and to organize, in that connection, an \r\ninternational meeting involving all stake-holders in \r\nAshgabat in 2012. \r\n The challenges facing the Organization are \r\ncomplex and ambitious, but they are realistic and \r\nachievable because we have a common goal, namely, to \r\nmake the world a better, fairer and more humane place. \r\nWe are united by common values and shared \r\nresponsibility. We are united in our endeavour to move \r\nforward. We rely on the vast experience gained by the \r\nUnited Nations over the decades, as well as on the will, \r\nintellect and wisdom of the community of nations. All \r\nof this will determine the extent of our overall success. \r\nToday each country makes its own unique contribution \r\nto the development and progress of mankind. This \r\nopens up enormous opportunities for creating and \r\nimplementing new ideas, for developing innovative \r\nmodels of cooperation to address key issues in modern \r\ntimes. Turkmenistan is ready to take an active part in \r\nthis activity, firmly following a strategic course aimed \r\nat close and comprehensive cooperation with the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of \r\nTurkmenistan for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov, President of \r\nTurkmenistan, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Carlos Mauricio Funes Cartagena, \r\nPresident of the Republic of El Salvador \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of El \r\nSalvador. \r\n Mr. Carlos Mauricio Funes Cartagena, President \r\nof the Republic of El Salvador, was escorted into \r\nthe General Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Carlos Mauricio Funes \r\nCartagena, President of the Republic of El Salvador, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Funes Cartagena (spoke in Spanish): \r\nThis new session of the Assembly of the United \r\nNations brings us together at what is no doubt an \r\nhistoric time of great importance, as has been said in \r\none way or another by the various leaders who have \r\npreceded me at this rostrum. These are certainly critical \r\ntimes that should lead us to adopt an attitude that goes \r\nbeyond addressing the specific questions of the \r\nmoment, because this is a moment of change in the \r\nhistory of humankind. On the economic, social and \r\ngeopolitical levels there are many signs indeed that \r\nshow us that the world is changing and that the \r\ntransition towards something new, even if still \r\nundefined, is already under way and will follow its \r\ncourse, whether we are able to understand it or not.  \r\n That is why our peoples desire political \r\nleadership that is able to respond to this time of \r\nuncertainty. Our societies demand of us that we be \r\nable, first of all, to understand and explain to them \r\nwhat is really going on. They also demand of us that \r\nwe listen to their needs and satisfy those needs and, \r\nabove all, that we reach a new international consensus \r\nin order to make that necessary qualitative global leap \r\nin order to achieve a planet of greater justice, stability \r\nand safety.  \r\n This is, therefore, an opportunity to reconsider \r\nour policies, to review and change paradigms that seem \r\nto be frozen, to renew the international debate and to \r\nbe ambitious in our aspirations as a global society. \r\nMembers know that nothing undermines the morale \r\nand spirit of our peoples more than fear, uncertainty \r\nand distrust. It is those evils that are affecting our \r\nplanet currently. We are suffering from fear in its \r\nvarious guises. Millions of demoralized, unemployed \r\npeople live in daily uncertainty, not knowing whether \r\nthere is a future for them and their children. Entire \r\ncountries have seen their economies stumble because \r\nof that lack of confidence. Hundreds of thousands of \r\nfamilies every day face the fear that takes the form of \r\npolitical instability, natural disasters, the lack of urban \r\nA/66/PV.19  \r\n \r\n11-51185 12 \r\n \r\nsafety, and poverty. All those people demand that their \r\nleaders give them the inspiration to overcome that fear, \r\nto regain a sense of collective self-esteem and to \r\nbelieve in a different and better future. That is the great \r\nhistorical challenge that we must shoulder with \r\nresponsibility and courage. \r\n We must forge a new international agreement that \r\nwill allow us to overcome such fears and lack of \r\nconfidence in order once again to stride forward. \r\nTherefore we must not allow that fear to be translated \r\ninto timid or cowardly political and economic \r\ndecisions that would deprive us of an opportunity to \r\nundertake the changes that our people are calling for. \r\nWe must not betray their historic will for \r\ntransformation and development. It would be \r\nunpardonable, unforgivable, if we were to allow \r\nourselves to be lulled by old political and economic \r\ndogma and continue repeating once again the same \r\nmistakes, while overwhelming majorities in every city, \r\nin every State, on every continent, have clearly \r\nexpressed their desire for a new, audacious and creative \r\npolicy. \r\n Over the past 30 years, while the economy has \r\ngrown exponentially, so has the root cause of many of \r\nour misfortunes, and here I am referring to injustice. \r\nDaily injustice has a most significant effect on our \r\npeoples. It affects their options for health, education \r\nand social development in very tangible ways. That \r\ninequality has disastrous consequences, which has been \r\ntried, tested and understood by some of the wealthiest \r\nentrepreneurs, who are in favour of paying more taxes, \r\nas they are aware that adopting any other position \r\nwould sentence us to a harsh future, even for those \r\nliving at ease.  \r\n The fight against poverty and inequality, as was \r\nrecalled at the inaugural meeting of this session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly by the President of Brazil, Dilma \r\nRousseff, has proven to be the strongest economic \r\npolicy in these difficult times. Therefore, it is time that \r\nwe no longer see our future in terms of macroeconomic \r\ndata but that we start to focus our political debate on \r\nour peoples’ needs and on social justice, which is what \r\nthe debate should always have focused on. Any other \r\ndebate would be sterile and would only lead us away \r\nfrom the common objective that should govern all our \r\npolicies, namely, the objective of the common good. \r\n The unstable reality that we have experienced \r\nalso takes the form of conflicts which, increasingly, \r\ncall upon the indistinct arbiter, who goes by the name \r\nof the “international community” and which is \r\nrepresented here in the General Assembly better than \r\nanywhere else. In that regard I welcome the fact that \r\none of the central themes of this session is the search \r\nfor the peaceful settlement of conflicts and prevention \r\nstrategies to cope with situations of instability. This \r\nshows us that the arbiter is growing stronger, as are the \r\npossibilities to prevent injustice and human rights \r\nabuses wherever they occur. The United Nations arose \r\nout of the global desire to avoid a new major conflict, \r\nand that spirit of peace and harmony must continue to \r\nguide us in our actions, even when the conflicts that we \r\nface currently are very different from the conflicts of \r\nthe twentieth century. Indeed, we are living in a most \r\ndiverse and complex world where there are no magical \r\nformulas or quick fixes but common responsibility, \r\nwhich is committed to finding new avenues for \r\npeacemaking and justice extending beyond our national \r\nborders.  \r\n That resolve must also translate into our quest for \r\nsolutions to what is one of the oldest conflicts on this \r\nplanet, and I am referring here to the Arab-Israeli \r\nconflict. As members know, my country recently \r\ndecided to recognize the Palestinian State. This in no \r\nway seeks to undermine our good diplomatic relations \r\nwith Israel. We are of the view that both peoples have \r\nthe right and duty to coexist. Recognizing Palestine as \r\na new State within the United Nations is, in my \r\nopinion, the right way to contribute to resolving the \r\nconflict. With this firm belief we support all diplomatic \r\nefforts that are aimed at achieving a peaceful \r\nsettlement of this long-standing conflict. We firmly \r\nbelieve that dialogue is the only possible solution, and \r\nour actions have always been guided by that principle. \r\n Now I should like to refer to the main enemy, not \r\nonly of my country and Central America but of a large \r\nportion of the American continent. I am referring here, \r\nof course, to organized crime and drugs trafficking. As \r\nwas rightly stated by President Calderón of Mexico \r\nfollowing the terrible attack that occurred in a casino in \r\nMonterrey, we are facing a veritable phenomenon of \r\nterrorism that threatens the viability of our countries, \r\nhas taken more lives than many wars, and which \r\nendangers the present and future of our peoples. Many \r\nLatin American countries represented here have \r\nbecome, against their will, true corridors for illegal \r\ntrafficking, thus becoming nations increasingly \r\naffected by violence, with institutions that are \r\n A/66/PV.19\r\n \r\n13 11-51185 \r\n \r\nsusceptible to corruption. Because of their poor \r\neconomies of scale, their lack of development and the \r\nweakness of their productive machinery owing to \r\nwidespread poverty and high levels of inequality, poor \r\nStates are threatened by this new form of terrorism that \r\nhas forged a strong economic network. All of the \r\ncartels that are operating in the Mesoamerican \r\nregion — Mexico and Central America — possess \r\nmore money and influence than our countries do. \r\n It is true to say that we are the true victims of \r\norganized crime. It is our territories and peoples that \r\nsuffer from this violence and who weep for their dead. \r\nThese are not mere empty statements. Studies have \r\nshown that violence and crime are 100 per cent more \r\nlikely in regions that facilitate illegal trafficking than \r\nanywhere else on the planet. Our countries are \r\nsuffering as a result of this. El Salvador and all of \r\nCentral America are undertaking significant efforts to \r\ndeal with this fact but the figures are not on our side. \r\nWe are speaking of a drug-trafficking route that moves \r\n$100 billion a year and which leads to the largest \r\nmarket in the world, as well as the largest consumer of \r\nthese substances, the United States. Consider this: \r\n$100 billion across our territories along with a \r\nveritable arsenal of weapons to protect this amount. \r\nThat means $100 billion dollars that can corrupt public \r\nand private officials, destroy our social fabric and \r\nleave behind them a daily wake of chaos and death.  \r\n How therefore can countries such as El Salvador \r\nwith a gross domestic product of about $22 billion, or a \r\ncountry such as Honduras with roughly $15 billion, or \r\nGuatemala which barely reaches $40 billion, deal with \r\nthis enemy? Not even a large country such as Mexico \r\ncan successfully wage this battle on its own in dealing \r\nwith this terrorist strength. It is not scepticism that \r\nleads me to speak this way but rather a sense of realism \r\nin keeping with the reality experienced by Central \r\nAmerican peoples on a daily basis. \r\n I wish to draw attention to this. The international \r\ncommunity must understand that it is also affected by \r\nthis problem. No nation on this planet is spared this \r\nproblem. There are drug users in every nation in the \r\nworld, who get their drugs from the criminal drug-\r\ntrafficking networks. That means that the fight against \r\norganized crime is a common struggle and, in that \r\nregard, I wish to make a special and hopeful call upon \r\nthe people and Government of the United States \r\nresolutely to lead us in this the good fight against drug-\r\ntrafficking and organized crime. I believe that the \r\nGovernment of the United States must lead us in the \r\nstruggle with great resolve. It must make the \r\ncommitment and apply all its economic, human, \r\ntechnological and political resources in waging the \r\nstruggle, which is indeed the harshest war to affect our \r\ncontinent. \r\n The violence that is fuelled by drugs trafficking \r\nand by its machinery of death has taken more lives in \r\nMesoamerica than conflicts that occur elsewhere on \r\nthis planet. That is why I wish to draw attention to and \r\ninvite all Members to focus on this shocking fact. We \r\nrequire the firm resolve of our great North American \r\nneighbour in order to strike the necessary blows to \r\nweaken and end this criminal phenomenon. Naturally, \r\nthat does not mean that our countries will in any way \r\nshirk their share of the responsibility. We shall \r\ncontinue to strengthen our institutions, to reform our \r\nsecurity forces, to strengthen our presence on the \r\nground in order to protect our young people from \r\ncriminal gangs. At the regional level we are working \r\ntogether and have undertaken significant steps in a \r\ncommon undertaking by sharing strategies and tasks \r\nwith Mexico, Colombia and the United States. \r\n Of course, these are truly difficult challenges that \r\nlie ahead. Many of these challenges were referred to by \r\nthe President of Mexico — the fight against money-\r\nlaundering, disarmament, crime prevention, an \r\neffective judiciary — and will require the reform of our \r\njudicial organs. Inevitably, organized crime has \r\ninfiltrated the organs of the State, in particular the \r\njudiciary and the police forces. That is why we must \r\nwage a strong fight in order to clean up those \r\ninstitutions. \r\n But the consumer countries, in this case chiefly \r\nthe United States, are morally responsible in this \r\nstruggle that must be seen not only as a criminal \r\nproblem but also as a matter of public health. While \r\ndrugs consumption and narcotics use grow, the \r\nbusiness of drugs trafficking will remain powerful. In \r\nshort, we call once again for North American \r\nleadership in this common struggle that we are waging \r\nalongside Mexico, Colombia and all of Central \r\nAmerica.  \r\n Struggles such as these, which are being waged \r\nacross the American continent, once again show how \r\nimportant it is to have a strong and united America. \r\nUnity is a necessary prerequisite in order to meet our \r\ncommon goals. Given this need, I now wish to refer to \r\nA/66/PV.19  \r\n \r\n11-51185 14 \r\n \r\nthe blockade against the Republic of Cuba. We believe \r\nthat this blockade is an anachronism from a past page \r\nof history that we wish to turn once and for all. \r\nEssentially a blockade against Cuba is a step towards \r\ndisunity. It is a stumbling block on the road of history \r\nthat weakens us as a continent. \r\n At the start of my statement I spoke of the \r\nleadership that our peoples expect from us in these \r\ndifficult times, of the courage that we need in order to \r\nface the challenges that extend beyond our borders and \r\nalso of this great opportunity before us now. Let us \r\nshow that leadership, from the smallest country, such \r\nas my own, to the great Powers. Let us show an \r\nunequivocal will to achieve peace, social justice and \r\nthe well-being of the men and women who place their \r\nfaith in us, in particular in times such as these when \r\ncrisis once again threatens our peoples. Let us not fail \r\nthem once more. We should not favour those in power \r\nwho triggered the crisis but rather the weakest, who are \r\naffected by it. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof El Salvador for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Carlos Mauricio Funes Cartagena, President \r\nof the Republic of El Salvador, was escorted from \r\nthe General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa, President of the \r\nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Democratic \r\nSocialist Republic of Sri Lanka. \r\n Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa, President of the \r\nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, was \r\nescorted into the General Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa, \r\nPresident of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri \r\nLanka, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Rajapaksa: It is with great pleasure \r\nthat I congratulate His Excellency Mr. Nassir \r\nAbdulaziz Al-Nasser on his assumption of the \r\npresidency. I must also congratulate His Excellency \r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon warmly on his reappointment as \r\nSecretary-General and we look forward to working \r\nwith him constructively.  \r\n As we gather here today, it is appropriate to \r\nreflect on the values and ideals that inspire the United \r\nNations system. One of the principal attributes is the \r\nspirit of flexibility, which has always been a feature of \r\nthe United Nations. We must acknowledge the need for \r\nthat spirit of openness and adaptability today more than \r\nat any other time. That is because the foundations of \r\nthe world order are being transformed dramatically and \r\nfundamentally. At the heart of those changes is the \r\nneed to protect the smaller countries in the developing \r\nworld and to advance their interests vigorously.  \r\n In the midst of uncertainty there are some things \r\nthat must remain constant. They reflect our most \r\ncherished beliefs and convictions. Despite repeated \r\nreferences in this Assembly by many member countries \r\nto the right of the Palestinian people to a State of their \r\nown within secure borders, we still have not been able \r\nto make it a reality. It is a cause of profound \r\ndisappointment that this has not yet happened. There is \r\na window of opportunity now and we must make use of \r\nit before it is too late. It is time for decisive action \r\nrather than more discussion. That will be in the interest \r\nof the security and well-being of the entire region, \r\nincluding Israel. \r\n The need for sustained support for the countries \r\nof the African continent at this critical time is also \r\nworthy of mention. It is important to remind ourselves \r\nthat every country cherishes the values, traditions and \r\ndeeply held religious convictions it has nurtured over \r\nthe centuries. They cannot be diluted or distorted under \r\nthe guise of human rights by the imposition of attitudes \r\nor approaches that are characteristics of alien cultures. \r\nIf that were to be done, it would amount to a violation \r\nof human rights in a fundamental sense. It must also be \r\npointed out that, even where sanctions are imposed, \r\nextreme care has to be taken to ensure that the people \r\nat large, men, women and children yet to be born, are \r\nnot harmed by such action. I would also express once \r\nagain my solidarity with the people of Cuba and wish \r\nthem all success. \r\n While the clash of ideas, opinions and values \r\ncontinues, we have clearly to recognize that dialogue, \r\ndeliberation and consensus offer the only viable means \r\nfor resolving differences. The might of powerful \r\nnations cannot prevail against justice and fair play. In \r\nthe troubled times in which we live we can derive \r\nguidance from the wise words of Gautama the Buddha, \r\nwho advised the Lichchhavi Princes, whose energies \r\nwere being consumed by bitter disputes among them, \r\n A/66/PV.19\r\n \r\n15 11-51185 \r\n \r\nthat the way forward consisted of meeting, discussing \r\nand departing in an atmosphere of amity and goodwill. \r\nThat represents the essential spirit of the United \r\nNations and is particularly relevant today.  \r\n The most significant challenge to stability and \r\nprogress in the modern world is posed by the menace \r\nof terrorism. Recent experience the world over amply \r\ndemonstrates that inconsistent standards and \r\ndiscriminatory approaches can unintentionally give a \r\nfresh lease of life to the forces of terror. An explicit \r\nand uniform response that refuses to recognize political \r\nshades of terrorism is required. \r\n Terrorism presents a threat from which not even \r\nthe wealthiest and most powerful nations are immune. \r\nIt must be remembered also that terrorist groups \r\nfrequently operate under the guise of front \r\norganizations. Conferring legitimacy on such \r\norganizations has had the inevitable effect of providing \r\ncomfort and encouragement to the merchants of terror. \r\nAs the leader of a nation that has paid a heavy price \r\nbecause of terrorism over a quarter of a century, I \r\nunderline that we must firmly resolve to rid the world \r\nof terrorism. We need to have solid, practical action on \r\nthe ground and send out our collective message on this \r\nissue loud and clear and universally. \r\n The interests of the developing world need to be \r\nprotected in another significant respect. It is vitally \r\nimportant to insist that the structures and procedures of \r\nmultilateral organizations should be uniform and \r\nconsistent and devoid of discrimination. My country \r\nhas reason for concern at approaches tainted by an \r\nunacceptable degree of selectivity, which we brought to \r\nthe notice of such organizations in recent weeks. The \r\ndeveloping world must keep a vigil against such \r\nirregular modalities, which should be resisted through \r\nour collective strength. Today, after three decades of \r\npain and anguish, Sri Lankans of all ethnicities, living \r\nin all parts of Sri Lanka, are free from the Liberation \r\nTigers of Tamil Eelam terror and no longer live in a \r\nstate of fear. However, I am deeply mindful that the \r\nbattle for peace is every bit as important and difficult \r\nas the struggle against terror. After the eradication of \r\nterrorism, my Government turned its undivided \r\nattention to building anew the foundations of a unified \r\nand vibrant nation, drawing upon the inherent strengths \r\nof our country and in particular the unique calibre of \r\nour human potential. \r\n It is justifiable for us to be proud of our nation’s \r\nachievements during the brief span of the 30 months \r\nsince the beginning of the post-conflict phase. The \r\nresettlement of more than 95 per cent of the internally \r\ndisplaced persons, who constituted the largest number \r\nof civilians forcibly held by a terrorist group at any \r\ntime, while continuing even today to clear the mines \r\nlaid by terrorists in extensive areas, is an achievement \r\nof which we can be proud. Today in the Northern \r\nProvince our armed forces are engaged in the \r\ndevelopment of the infrastructure that was destroyed \r\nby the terrorists during a period of three decades. \r\nContrary to malicious propaganda the numbers of \r\narmed forces personnel present in the Northern \r\nProvince has been kept at a minimal level. Revival of \r\nthe economy has enhanced incomes and improved \r\nlivelihoods. Ex-combatants and other cadres, after \r\nexposure to programmes of vocational training and \r\ncounselling, have been reintegrated into society. The \r\nelectoral process has been restored after decades, \r\nmaking possible the emergence of a democratic \r\nleadership. \r\n These are among our valued accomplishments. \r\nThe remarkable growth of 22 per cent of the economy \r\nof the Northern Province is a clear indication of the \r\nsuccess achieved by the Government’s initiatives with \r\nregard to development in that part of the country. The \r\ngross domestic product growth of the country has been \r\nconsistent at 8 per cent, and unemployment is at a \r\nrecord low of 4.5 per cent. It is also worthy of mention \r\nthat, in the assessment by the World Economic Forum \r\nin its Global Competitiveness Report for 2011-2012, \r\nSri Lanka shows dramatic improvement, moving up to \r\nfifty-second from their rank of seventy-ninth over a \r\nspan of two years. It is worthy of note that all these \r\ndevelopments have taken place within the brief space \r\nof 30 months — an achievement all the more \r\nsignificant because of our strong emphasis on \r\nreconciliation. Important as economic development is, \r\nwe have attached the highest priority to fostering the \r\nspirit of inclusivity and removing any remnants of \r\nbitterness from the hearts and minds of all our people. \r\nOver the past 30 months we have recruited 669 Tamil \r\npolice officers, bringing the total number of Tamil \r\nofficers to 1,143, while plans are afoot to recruit more \r\nthis year and in the future. After more than two decades \r\na census is being conducted in the Northern Province \r\nas part of the national census, to provide a firm basis \r\nfor our initiatives.  \r\nA/66/PV.19  \r\n \r\n11-51185 16 \r\n \r\n As a result of these achievements, what we see in \r\nSri Lanka today is a self-reliant nation with robust \r\nhopes for the future and a strong economy, \r\nstrengthened by inward investment flows, \r\nunprecedented expansion of tourism, and significant \r\ngrowth in volume of international trade. With a view to \r\nconsolidating these trends and leaving behind us the \r\ntrauma of the past, we ask of the international \r\ncommunity the hand of friendship and goodwill, based \r\non an understanding of our nation’s determination to \r\nconfront with courage the challenge of a new era in our \r\nhistory. We ask our friends in distant lands to drop \r\npreconceived notions. We strongly believe in home-\r\ngrown solutions for them to be sustainable. It is clearly \r\nimpractical to conceive of universal remedies for \r\nproblems that afflict our societies. My country, as it \r\ncomes out of the darkness of the past three decades \r\ninto the light and promise of the future, must be \r\nafforded the time and space to seek its destiny in \r\naccordance with the wishes of its people. That is in \r\nkeeping with the values enshrined in the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations and the whole body of international law \r\nthat governs us. \r\n A further consideration that the international \r\ncommunity should take into account is the \r\nvulnerability of developing nations, and it should make \r\nprovision by means of appropriate institutional \r\narrangements for their protection. As I observed when \r\ninaugurating the fiftieth anniversary meeting of the \r\nAsian-African Legal Consultative Organization in \r\nColombo three months ago, the dumping of \r\ncommercial and industrial goods manufactured in \r\ndeveloped countries imperils the economies of many \r\nAsian and African countries represented here. \r\n In conclusion, let me say that the use of \r\nsubstantial subsidies by treasuries and reserve banks to \r\nsupport agricultural production in the developed world, \r\nand other forms of protectionism, cause a serious \r\ndistortion in the interplay of market forces and greatly \r\nreduce the ability of farmers in many developing \r\ncountries to access international markets for their \r\nexport products on an equitable basis. The \r\ndisproportionate pollution of the environment by \r\nindustrialized countries and the resultant impact on \r\nglobal warming and climate change cannot be \r\nremedied with any semblance of justice by imposing \r\nharsh restraints on developing countries, which have \r\ncontributed very little to aggravate the problem. These \r\ncircumstances heighten the importance of social equity \r\nat the international level.  \r\n May the Noble Triple Gem bless you all. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the \r\nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa, President of the \r\nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, was \r\nescorted from the General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Ismaël Omar Guelleh, President and \r\nHead of Government of the Republic of Djibouti \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President and Head of \r\nGovernment of the Republic of Djibouti. \r\n Mr. Ismaël Omar Guelleh, President and Head of \r\nGovernment of the Republic of Djibouti, was \r\nescorted into the General Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Ismaël Omar Guelleh, \r\nPresident and Head of Government of the Republic of \r\nDjibouti, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Guelleh (spoke in French): Allow me \r\nto warmly congratulate the President on his accession \r\nto the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-\r\nsixth session. With his experience and expertise we are \r\nindeed assured of the successful conduct and outcome \r\nof our deliberations. I express my gratitude to his \r\npredecessor, Mr. Joseph Deiss, for his efficiency and \r\nthe excellent manner in which he guided our work \r\nthroughout the sixty-fifth session. We wish him well in \r\nhis future endeavours.  \r\n I also extend my warmest congratulations to \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon on his reappointment. \r\nThat is a token of the esteem that all States have for his \r\noutstanding leadership, especially in these turbulent \r\ntimes and the difficult international political situation. \r\nWe appreciate his tireless efforts and commitment to \r\nserve the international community, and we pledge our \r\nfull support in carrying out and promoting the \r\nfundamental values of the Charter.  \r\n Lastly, we are delighted at the long-awaited \r\ncreation of the United Nations Entity for Gender \r\nEquality and the Empowerment of Women, which \r\n A/66/PV.19\r\n \r\n17 11-51185 \r\n \r\nannounces the remarkable progress that has been made \r\nduring the past century in the quest for gender equality \r\nand empowerment of women. Clearly, despite the great \r\nstrides made in legal matters, it is still true that such \r\nprogress is not always translated into reality. My \r\nGovernment has made strengthening women’s rights \r\nand improving their lives absolute priorities, and I am \r\ncommitted to ensuring that our laws conform to \r\ninternational standards. \r\n We are gathered here today in a global economic \r\ncontext that is more than worrying. This difficult world \r\neconomic environment is indeed reflected in weak \r\neconomies, declining growth, crippling debts and \r\ndeficits and rising unemployment. The least developed \r\ncountries are more severely affected by these crises. \r\nThe Fourth United Nations Conference on the Least \r\nDeveloped Countries, held recently in Turkey, gave \r\nnew impetus to global efforts to improve the fate of the \r\nmost vulnerable nations. From this perspective I invite \r\nthe international community to pay special attention to \r\nthe unique situation of least developed countries and to \r\nprovide more support in alleviating the growing burden \r\nof debt by assisting them to improve their production \r\ncapacity and facilitating access to world markets on \r\nmore favourable terms.  \r\n Coupled with the economic malaise, we are \r\nwitnessing throughout the world increasing climatic \r\ndisparities that range from one extreme to another. It is \r\nnow very common for countries to be hit by floods \r\nfollowed by droughts, and by earthquakes, devastating \r\nhurricanes or tsunamis. The catastrophe that recently \r\nhit our Japanese friends testifies to nature’s ferocity. \r\nThe recurrence of these climate plagues shows us that \r\nwe must better prepare ourselves and set up appropriate \r\nmitigation and adaptation measures. \r\n In the Horn of Africa the uncertainties of the \r\nclimate have long been a fact of life, as evidenced by \r\nthe recurrent cycles of drought. The current crisis \r\naffecting my country is not sudden. We had already \r\nsounded the alarm in 2010, when the first warning \r\nsigns appeared. Faced with this terrible scourge, the \r\nresilience of the region is strained, and emergency \r\nmeasures alone cannot meet the challenges now \r\nconfronting us. Indeed, the situation we face today is \r\nthe result of several years of drought that have \r\ndecimated the herds of nomadic peoples and destroyed \r\ntheir meagre crops. People in rural areas are obviously \r\nthe most affected, and we are doing our best to help \r\nthem.  \r\n Our needs are immediate and urgent, and we are \r\ngrateful to the friendly countries and international \r\norganizations that have assisted us in our efforts. \r\nHowever, given the endemic nature of the drought in \r\nour region, we need to go beyond reactive management \r\nand focus more on managing long-term preventative \r\nmeasures. In this context my country has established \r\nseveral infrastructure projects in agriculture, including \r\nthe exploitation of arable lands in the neighbouring \r\nfriendly countries of Ethiopia and the Sudan, and the \r\nRiver Awash water catchment project on the border \r\nwith Ethiopia for times of floods.  \r\n The country most affected by this crisis remains \r\nSomalia, because the precarious security situation does \r\nnot allow access to certain populations. Indeed, over \r\nthe past two decades, Somalia has been a victim of the \r\nworst evils. It has been the victim of endless \r\nbloodshed, insecurity, instability and destruction. Until \r\nrecently Al-Shabaab militia continued fighting in the \r\ncapital, which made it all the more difficult to help the \r\naffected population. Today, thanks to the diligence and \r\nsacrifices of the Somali security forces and their \r\ncolleagues from the African Union Mission in Somalia, \r\nAl-Shabaab militia have been pushed out of the capital, \r\nand that has facilitated the delivery of humanitarian aid \r\nto drought victims. \r\n As I was able to see for myself during my visit to \r\nMogadishu last month, the guns have fallen silent, life \r\nhas resumed its course and this year, for the first time \r\nsince the armed conflict began in 1991, Somalis were \r\nable to celebrate Eid in peace. Numerous high-level \r\nofficials have since visited the Somali capital, which \r\nhad long been considered too dangerous.  \r\n This still-fragile but auspicious peace is an \r\nopportunity for the Somali people to rebuild their \r\ncountry. Thanks to the security situation, which is now \r\nunder control in the capital, the Somali people and \r\ntheir leaders have before them an unprecedented \r\nopportunity to revive a lasting peace, to stop the \r\ninterminable transition process and to move the \r\ncountry to a permanent governance by next year. \r\nEfforts have been made in this direction by the \r\nTransitional Government as well as by regional and \r\ninternational organizations. These have helped parties \r\nto reach an agreement that reflects the new political \r\nreality in Somalia, especially after the month of August \r\n2011.  \r\nA/66/PV.19  \r\n \r\n11-51185 18 \r\n \r\n All these efforts should be applauded as a sign of \r\nthe determination of the Somalis and of the \r\ninternational community to end the endless infighting \r\nand fruitless discussions within the Transitional \r\nFederal Institutions. In this regard the agreed road map \r\nrepresents a solemn commitment by the leaders of the \r\nTransitional Federal Institutions to the people of \r\nSomalia, the regional bodies and the international \r\ncommunity as a whole.  \r\n The international community, for its part, must \r\nnot lose sight of the obvious weaknesses of the \r\nTransitional Government and should endeavour to \r\nprovide the necessary resources to build capacity. The \r\nSomali Government should take this opportunity to \r\nshow determination, courage and leadership. \r\n Beyond the rigours of the climate and problems \r\nthey generate, the Horn of Africa is often associated \r\nwith fratricidal wars. Indeed, at one point in its history \r\neach of our neighbours has been in a conflict situation. \r\nWhile Djibouti has spared no effort to maintain peace, \r\nin spite of ourselves we were unfortunately dragged \r\ninto a border conflict with Eritrea in June 2008.  \r\n Since then, despite the best efforts of regional \r\nand international organizations and the adoption of \r\nSecurity Council resolutions 1862 (2009) and 1907 \r\n(2009), Eritrea refuses to answer us about the fate of \r\n19 prisoners of war or even to acknowledge their \r\nexistence. This remains a serious concern and a source \r\nof great sadness for my people and myself.  \r\n However, despite Eritrea’s failure to comply with \r\nthe clear requirements set forth in those resolutions, \r\nmy Government and I remain convinced that mediation \r\nis the only way that will allow us to achieve a lasting \r\npeace. With this conviction in mind, my Government \r\nhas accepted the efforts and goodwill of His Highness \r\nthe Emir of Qatar. That led to the stationing of Qatari \r\ntroops on the border between Djibouti and Eritrea and \r\nthe withdrawal of Eritrean troops from the Djibouti \r\nterritory they had illegally occupied. For our part, we \r\nremain willing to cooperate fully with the sincere \r\nefforts of His Highness the Emir of Qatar, and we \r\nremain confident of the peaceful outcome of this \r\nmediation. \r\n We will never stop believing in the virtues of \r\ndialogue and mediation, the only virtues that can \r\nenable our region to consolidate the gains of peace. \r\nThe most recent example of such success is \r\nundoubtedly the birth of the new nation of South \r\nSudan, once again demonstrating the ability of our \r\npeers to find a peaceful solution to a decades-old \r\nfratricidal conflict. Today, as the people of South \r\nSudan take their first steps in the comity of nations, we \r\nwant to assure them of our fraternal support. I am \r\nconfident that they will resolve the outstanding issues \r\npeacefully. \r\n Of course, we can only rejoice that a new \r\nMember has joined the Organization, but I could not \r\nmention the independence of South Sudan without \r\nrecalling the situation that has prevailed in Palestine \r\nsince 1947.  \r\n The very foundation of the United Nations \r\nconsisted in fighting injustice and giving nations their \r\nsovereignty. Many countries here today, including \r\nmine, have at some point in their history found \r\nthemselves here in search of independence. South \r\nSudan became the 193rd Member State on 13 July. \r\nPalestine, for its part, continues to this day to live \r\nunder occupation, which in this day and age is morally \r\nwrong and politically unsustainable.  \r\n We Africans know better than anyone the \r\nconditions in which colonized populations live. The \r\nfate experienced by the Palestinians for more than \r\n60 years we have known, we have fought and we have \r\novercome by obtaining the recognition of our peers. \r\nMore than any other institution, for colonized peoples \r\nthe United Nations represented hope: the hope for a \r\nbetter future, freed from the colonial yoke; the hope to \r\nlive in one’s own country, enjoying freedom and one’s \r\nrights; the hope, above all, to regain dignity.  \r\n The time has come for us to give hope to our \r\nPalestinian brothers and sisters by recognizing their \r\nright to become a full-fledged State. It is time to end \r\nthe siege, the poverty and the despair. History will \r\nremember, I hope, that on this day we decided to end \r\nthe injustice and made the choice to finally give to \r\nPalestine a full place in the international community. \r\nHistory will especially remember that we have chosen \r\nnot to disappoint the hopes of the fraternal people of \r\nPalestine. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President and Head of \r\nGovernment of the Republic of Djibouti for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\n A/66/PV.19\r\n \r\n19 11-51185 \r\n \r\n Mr. Ismaël Omar Guelleh, President and Head of \r\nGovernment of the Republic of Djibouti, was \r\nescorted from the General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Hifikepunye Pohamba, President of \r\nthe Republic of Namibia \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nNamibia. \r\n Mr. Hifikepunye Pohamba, President of the \r\nRepublic of Namibia, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Hifikepunye Pohamba, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Namibia, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly.  \r\n President Pohamba: I wish to congratulate the \r\nPresident and his country, Qatar, on his election to the \r\npresidency of the Assembly at this session. With his \r\nwisdom and experience, I am confident that he will \r\nsuccessfully steer the proceedings of the Assembly. I \r\nassure him of my delegation’s cooperation and support. \r\nI also congratulate His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon \r\non his reappointment as Secretary-General. \r\n I commend the President for choosing the role of \r\nmediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful \r\nmeans as the theme for this debate. The peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes, as provided for in Chapter VI of \r\nthe United Nations Charter, is an important principle \r\nthat the international community should uphold in \r\nseeking solutions to conflicts throughout the world.  \r\n Our Government recognizes the legitimacy of \r\npeaceful demands for democratic changes in sister \r\ncountries such as Tunisia and Egypt. However, we \r\nbelieve that the demands for democratic change should \r\nbe locally driven. They should not be used as a pretext \r\nto undermine the fundamental principle of sovereignty \r\nand non-intervention in the internal affairs of \r\nindependent States.  \r\n We are concerned that all efforts by the African \r\nUnion to find a peaceful negotiated solution in Libya \r\nwere ignored and undermined. Never in the history of \r\nthe United Nations has the sanctity of the principle of \r\nnon-intervention been so compromised as we have \r\nwitnessed recently in Libya. The military intervention \r\nby a foreign Power reminds Africa of the infamous \r\nBerlin Conference of 1884, when Africa was carved up \r\nby imperial Powers. \r\n In the aftermath of the recent political changes in \r\nsome African countries, it is important to underscore \r\nthe need to promote genuine national reconciliation \r\nand unity and to begin urgently to address the \r\nchallenges of poverty and unemployment, especially \r\namong the youth of the world. Respect for justice, \r\nfundamental human rights, the rule of law and good \r\ngovernance should be preconditions for lasting peace.  \r\n Following successful negotiations, the Republic \r\nof South Sudan attained its independence on 9 July \r\n2011. This demonstrated the statesmanship and wisdom \r\nof the leaders of the Sudan and the Republic of South \r\nSudan, who chose the path of peace and mediation. We \r\ncall on the two countries to resolve all outstanding \r\nissues through peaceful means. I wish His Excellency \r\nPresident Salva Kiir Mayardit success as he leads the \r\npeople of South Sudan in building a united and \r\nprosperous nation. \r\n Namibia calls for the immediate implementation \r\nof the United Nations settlement plan and relevant \r\nUnited Nations resolutions calling for the holding of a \r\nfree and fair referendum in Western Sahara. \r\n With regard to Palestine, I reaffirm our full and \r\nunequivocal support for the legitimate struggle of the \r\nPalestinian people to achieve their inalienable right to \r\nself-determination and national independence. Namibia \r\nsupports the admission of Palestine to the United \r\nNations as a full Member.  \r\n The overwhelming majority of the Member States \r\nof the Assembly have for many years expressed serious \r\nconcern over the continuing economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo against the Republic of Cuba. \r\nNamibia calls for the immediate and unconditional \r\nlifting of this embargo. \r\n Namibia welcomes the recent signing of the road \r\nmap by the Malagasy political stakeholders with the \r\nfacilitation of the Southern African Development \r\nCommunity mediator. It paves the way for bringing an \r\nend to the political crisis and returning Madagascar to \r\nconstitutional order and democratic rule. The United \r\nNations and the international community should \r\nprovide adequate financial support to that country and \r\nbecome actively engaged in the ongoing mediation \r\nefforts to ensure the full implementation of the road \r\nmap. \r\nA/66/PV.19  \r\n \r\n11-51185 20 \r\n \r\n The people of Somalia are faced with not only \r\npolitical uncertainty but also a severe drought and \r\nfamine, which have resulted in a human catastrophe. \r\nNamibia has joined the international community in \r\ncontributing food supplies to the people of Somalia as \r\npart of the international effort to address the crisis. \r\n The effects of climate change are real and are \r\nacutely felt in every part of the globe. For the past \r\nthree consecutive years Namibia has experienced \r\ndevastating floods, which negatively impacted our \r\ndevelopment plans. I take this opportunity to once \r\nagain thank members of the international community \r\nwho responded to our emergency appeal for assistance. \r\n Now more than ever before, all Member States \r\nshould work towards the successful conclusion of the \r\nseventeenth Conference of the Parties to the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change, \r\nwhich will take place in Durban, South Africa, later \r\nthis year. This should set the tone for the United \r\nNations Conference on Sustainable Development, \r\nRio+20, to be held in Rio de Janeiro next year.  \r\n The reform of the United Nations system, \r\nespecially the Security Council, has been painfully \r\nslow. I underscore Namibia’s firm conviction that a \r\nreformed Security Council should be democratic, \r\nrepresentative and transparent in its working methods. \r\nThat is consistent with the African common position. It \r\nis incumbent on all Member States to work together to \r\nstrengthen the Organization in order to guarantee \r\ninternational peace and security and to advance \r\nsustainable economic and social development for a \r\nfairer and more just world for all. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Namibia for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Hifikepunye Pohamba, President of the \r\nRepublic of Namibia, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Salva Kiir, President of the Republic \r\nof South Sudan \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nSouth Sudan. \r\n Mr. Salva Kiir, President of the Republic of South \r\nSudan, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Salva Kiir, President of the \r\nRepublic of South Sudan, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly. \r\n President Kiir: Allow me first to congratulate \r\nMr. Al-Nasser on his election to the presidency of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at this sixty-sixth session. We wish \r\nhim every success during his term of office. In the \r\nsame way, we congratulate the Secretary-General on \r\nhaving been re-elected to a second term because of the \r\nconfidence he has won from the people of the United \r\nNations. \r\n I have not been involved in global issues, being \r\nthe representative of the youngest nation in this family \r\nof nations. Our country is just two months and 14 days \r\nold today. Members can see how many problems and \r\nchallenges are ahead of us. I wish at the outset to avail \r\nmyself of this opportunity and the privilege of \r\naddressing this stellar gathering to reiterate, on my \r\nown behalf and on behalf of the people of the Republic \r\nof South Sudan, our most sincere and profound \r\ngratitude to the entire international community for the \r\nwarmth with which our State has been welcomed into \r\nthe community of nations. My people back home in \r\nSouth Sudan, and I personally here in New York, \r\nregard this significant moment as yet another milestone \r\non the long list of our achievements.  \r\n The President returned to the Chair. \r\n I should like to seize this opportunity also once \r\nagain to salute the many who stood with us during our \r\nlong struggle. We are indebted to many friends in this \r\ngreat Hall, without whose efforts it would not have \r\nbeen easy for us to get where we are today. We owe a \r\ndebt of gratitude to the countries of the \r\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), \r\nthe troika States, and the friends and partners of IGAD, \r\nwho waged a struggle for peace for the Sudan that \r\nculminated in the signing of the Comprehensive Peace \r\nAgreement (CPA) in 2005. As an emergent nation that \r\nhas been embroiled in conflict during different periods \r\nof time, all of which add up to more than five decades, \r\nthe Republic of South Sudan stands in dire need of all \r\nthe help it can get.  \r\n In most post-conflict situations, nations would \r\nnormally expect to rebuild. That is not the case for us. \r\nEven before the ravages of war set in, our country had \r\nnothing worth rebuilding. Hence, we characterize our \r\n A/66/PV.19\r\n \r\n21 11-51185 \r\n \r\npost-conflict mission as one of construction rather than \r\nreconstruction, and we therefore hope that the \r\noverwhelming outpouring of support and sympathy \r\nthat greeted our independence from all corners of the \r\nglobe will translate into tangible development \r\nassistance for South Sudan. Our march out of the abyss \r\nof poverty and deprivation into the realm of progress \r\nand prosperity is going to be a long one, and that is \r\nwhy we need members to partner us on this difficult \r\njourney. \r\n Although nature has endowed our country with \r\nsome resources, notably oil and other mineral wealth, \r\nwe hardly produce anything for ourselves — at least \r\nnot yet. We are determined to diversify the economy of \r\nour country and lessen our precarious and near total \r\ndependence on oil. Our strategy is to use the oil as a \r\ncatalyst to unlock the potential we have in other areas, \r\nespecially in agriculture. \r\n Oil is a non-renewable resource that will \r\ninevitably be depleted at some point in the future, but \r\nwe know that the land, water and human resources at \r\nour disposal will continue to be our country’s true, \r\ninexhaustible fount of wealth. The ambition of the \r\npeople of South Sudan is to be able to transform their \r\ncountry into a regional agro-industrial powerhouse, but \r\nwithout a helping hand from others the attainment of \r\nthis goal will indeed remain a tall order. Much as we \r\nneed external assistance, it is our passionate wish that \r\nit be offered on terms that will also respect our \r\npolitical and economic choices. \r\n The Republic of South Sudan is under no illusion \r\nthat economic development and prosperity can be \r\nachieved in the absence of a climate of peace and \r\nstability. We shall therefore strive to promote peace \r\nand harmony not only internally but also between all of \r\nour neighbours and us. Inside South Sudan, we have \r\nset up broad-based executive and legislative organs of \r\nGovernment that are inclusive of key political parties. \r\nWe did so despite the fact that our party, the Sudan \r\nPeople’s Liberation Movement, won a landslide in the \r\nrecent elections.  \r\n We were not deterred from installing such an \r\naccommodative Government by the fact that we do not \r\neven yet have in place the requisite legal framework \r\ngoverning political party activity. We took those steps \r\nnot only because of our commitment to political \r\npluralism, but primarily because of our strong \r\nconviction that measures of inclusion such as these can \r\nfoster peace and harmony. \r\n In the external domain, we remain strongly \r\ncommitted to maintaining peaceful and mutually \r\nbeneficial relations with all States, and particularly \r\nwith our neighbours. In that regard, I wish to affirm \r\nthat the Republic of South Sudan fully adheres to the \r\nprinciple of absolute respect for the sovereignty and \r\nterritorial integrity of all States, including the Republic \r\nof the Sudan. Therefore, the Republic of South Sudan \r\nhereby categorically restates that it has not interfered \r\nand will not interfere in any domestic conflict situation \r\nin the Republic of the Sudan. \r\n However, on account of the fact that conflict \r\nareas in the Republic of the Sudan border our country \r\nand that any spillover effects from those could \r\nnegatively impact our own security, we urge the \r\nGovernment of the Sudan to seek a peaceful resolution \r\nto those conflicts. We would like to emphasize in \r\nparticular that the reinstatement by the Government of \r\nthe Sudan of the recent Addis Ababa framework accord \r\non the situation in Southern Kordofan State and \r\npolitical relations between the Government and the \r\nopposition could go a long way towards promoting the \r\nrestoration of peace in the areas bordering South \r\nSudan. \r\n There are a number of outstanding issues that \r\nhave carried over from the Comprehensive Peace \r\nAgreement. We hope to expeditiously resolve them so \r\nas to ensure the complete normalization of relations \r\nbetween the two States and the start of a new era of a \r\npositive and mutually beneficial relationship that will \r\nbe predicated on the commonalities shared by the \r\npeople of the two States. We therefore urge the \r\nGovernment of the Republic of the Sudan to consent to \r\nthe speedy demarcation of the border between the two \r\nStates, with the help of the international community. \r\nWe hope that Khartoum will no longer object to such \r\nan arrangement, given that South Sudan is now a \r\nsovereign State.  \r\n We would also like to plead with the Government \r\nof the Republic of the Sudan to agree to the submission \r\nof our dispute over the ownership of a number of \r\nborder areas to international arbitration. The \r\nGovernment of the Republic of South Sudan applauds \r\nthe cooperation of the Government of the Republic of \r\nthe Sudan in paving the way to the deployment of the \r\nUnited Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei, and \r\nA/66/PV.19  \r\n \r\n11-51185 22 \r\n \r\nhopes that the two countries will reach agreement \r\nsooner rather than later on the resolution of the Abyei \r\nissue, in line with the relevant provisions of the CPA. \r\n On the economic front, South Sudan wishes to \r\ndeclare that it is willing and ready to outline serious \r\nnegotiations with Khartoum. That will be done with the \r\naim of reaching mutually acceptable arrangements that \r\nwill guarantee for the Republic of the Sudan a fair \r\nincome from the use of Sudan’s oil export \r\ninfrastructure. \r\n In terms of governance, we have moved to rectify \r\nsome of the defects in our system by strengthening the \r\npillars of good governance. A number of key bills — \r\nnotable among which is a public financial management \r\nbill — are now making their way steadily through the \r\nlegislative process. The passage of such laws will help \r\npromote accountability and transparency and \r\nultimately curb corruption and the unwarranted loss of \r\npublic revenue. \r\n In conclusion, the new Republic of South Sudan \r\nvows to become an active member of the global family \r\nof nations, making its contribution to fostering world \r\npeace and prosperity for the benefit of all humankind. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof South Sudan for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Salva Kiir, President of the Republic of South \r\nSudan, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Serzh Sargsyan, President of the \r\nRepublic of Armenia \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of Armenia. \r\n Mr. Serzh Sargsyan, President of the Republic of \r\nArmenia, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Serzh Sargsyan, President \r\nof the Republic of Armenia, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly. \r\n President Sargsyan (spoke in Armenian; \r\ninterpretation into English provided by the delegation): \r\nI would first like to thank and wish every success to \r\nMr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-sixth session, and to \r\nthank Mr. Deiss of Switzerland for his leadership \r\nduring the sixty-fifth session. I would also like to take \r\nthis opportunity to once again congratulate Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon on his appointment to a second \r\nterm in office. \r\n I would like to acknowledge the importance of \r\nthe choice of theme for this general debate, and to \r\nhighlight the role of mediation in the settlement of \r\ndisputes by peaceful means and as a way of preventing \r\nthe resumption of hostilities. \r\n We greatly appreciate the mediation efforts of \r\nglobal and regional entities and organizations in \r\nvarious parts of the world to preserve peace and \r\nsecurity and to settle conflicts through peaceful \r\nnegotiations. Particularly worth mentioning is the \r\nengagement of regional organizations, which have \r\ngained a great deal of experience in mediation and \r\nhave in-depth knowledge of political, cultural and \r\nmilitary realities on the ground. The success of \r\nmediation hinges, among other things, on the \r\narticulation of a clearly defined mandate. A case in \r\npoint for us has been the role of the Minsk Group of \r\nthe Organization for Security and Cooperation in \r\nEurope (OSCE) in settling the Nagorno Karabakh \r\nconflict. \r\n Another key factor worth highlighting here is the \r\nrole of mediators in preventing the escalation of \r\nconflict and a resumption of hostilities. This aspect of \r\nmediation is sometimes overlooked, yet it is of no less \r\nimportance to international peace and stability than is \r\nfinding a solution to a contentious matter. \r\n Three years ago, when I had the honour to speak \r\nfrom this rostrum (see A/63/PV.9), I said that the time \r\nhad come for serious consideration of people’s right to \r\nself-determination in the twenty-first century. Today, \r\nwe are witnessing new instances of people exercising \r\nthis inalienable right. In that context, I would like to \r\ncongratulate the newly elected 193rd Member of the \r\nUnited Nations, the Republic of South Sudan. Its road \r\nto a seat in this Hall has been long and difficult, but the \r\npeople of South Sudan, through the free expression of \r\ntheir will, have exercised their right to live as a \r\nsovereign, independent nation, thus pursuing the path \r\nthat many of the Member States represented here today \r\nhave taken. \r\n The people of Nagorno Karabakh made the same \r\nchoice two decades ago by exercising their right to \r\n A/66/PV.19\r\n \r\n23 11-51185 \r\n \r\nself-determination, withstanding the war unleashed by \r\nAzerbaijan, and surviving bloodshed to earn their right \r\nto live in freedom. The Nagorno Karabakh conflict \r\nsettlement talks are continuing with the mediation of \r\nthe OSCE Minsk Group co-chairs. We are grateful to \r\nthe co-chair countries and their leaders for their \r\nmediation efforts. However, it is the negotiating \r\nparties, not the mediators, who have to reach an \r\nagreement. Azerbaijan’s utter unwillingness to reach an \r\nagreement and its everything-or-war position have \r\nstalled progress in the peace talks. Despite the \r\nexpectations and high-level advice of the international \r\ncommunity, Azerbaijan took yet another step backward \r\nduring the last meeting in Kazan by rejecting the \r\npreviously formulated arrangement and in fact trying to \r\nmake the negotiation process break down. \r\n Baku has turned Armenophobia into State \r\npropaganda at a level that is way beyond dangerous. \r\nThat is not just our view; the alarm has also been \r\nsounded by international entities specializing in \r\ncombating racism and intolerance. Even more \r\ndangerously, Armenophobic ideas are spreading among \r\nthe young Azeri generation, imperilling the future of \r\npeaceful coexistence. By denying and destroying all \r\nthings Armenian, Baku stubbornly continues to \r\ndisseminate false accusations against Armenia, \r\nNagorno Karabakh and Armenians at all levels \r\neverywhere, including here, within the framework of \r\nthe United Nations. Azerbaijan’s propaganda machine \r\ncontinues to regularly bombard the international \r\ncommunity and its domestic audience with horrendous \r\nlies about so-called Armenian brutality and the killing \r\nof children. These stories are fabricated and \r\ndisseminated based on their authors’ shallow yet \r\npainful logic, which posits that there are some people \r\nout there who will rise to the bait of this evil \r\npropaganda against Armenia and that it will thus serve \r\na purpose. \r\n In recent years, owing to the efforts of the Minsk \r\nGroup co-chair countries, particularly direct mediation \r\non the part of the President of the Russian Federation, \r\na number of documents have been signed, including the \r\nMeindorf, Astrakhan and Sochi declarations, which \r\nhave stressed the need to strengthen confidence-\r\nbuilding measures between the parties. The signature \r\nof the President of Azerbaijan is also on those \r\ndocuments. Azerbaijan, however, continues to turn \r\ndown repeated proposals from the international \r\ncommunity concerning agreement on the non-use of \r\nforce and the strengthening of confidence-building \r\nmeasures. \r\n Moreover, Azerbaijan’s belligerent rhetoric and \r\nthreats of war have intensified, and ceasefire violations \r\nthat continue to deprive innocent civilians of their lives \r\nhave grown more frequent. All of this is orchestrated at \r\nthe highest State level. The dangerous rise in \r\nmanifestations of Armenophobia not only does not \r\ncontribute to an atmosphere of trust in the region, but \r\nalso leads to questions about Azerbaijan’s \r\nunderstanding of the United Nations goals of tolerance \r\nand good-neighbourly coexistence. With such \r\naspirations, it is impermissible and even dangerous to \r\naspire to membership in the Security Council. \r\n Yesterday, in the framework of the Assembly, \r\nalongside debates on some of the most vital and urgent \r\nissues of our time, a High-level meeting was convened \r\nyesterday on the tenth anniversary of the Durban \r\nDeclaration, which reiterated the urgent need to \r\neliminate racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and \r\nall forms of intolerance. Unfortunately, these \r\nphenomena are familiar to us Armenians not only from \r\nthe examples I mentioned earlier and not only from this \r\ncentury. As a nation that has survived genocide, the \r\nmost extreme form of racism and xenophobia, we are \r\nmorally obliged to act to prevent future genocides. \r\n The elimination of racism and xenophobia and \r\nthe inculcation of tolerance can be truly effective if \r\naccompanied by a clear prescription of liability. \r\nImpunity and the avoidance of accountability give birth \r\nto yet new crimes. Hence, it is incumbent upon the \r\ninternational community to identify and denounce \r\nwithout delay any expression of intolerance, especially \r\nin its extreme forms. \r\n The genocide of the Armenians perpetrated under \r\nthe Ottoman Empire has been recognized and \r\ncondemned by numerous countries, parliaments, \r\ninternational organizations and the community of \r\ngenocide scholars. Unfortunately, the same does not \r\nhold true for the Republic of Turkey, which continues \r\nto engage in a policy of denying this atrocious crime \r\nagainst humanity.  \r\n We unequivocally welcome the clear position \r\nadopted by the international community in precluding \r\nany possibility of immunity or pardon for the \r\nperpetrators of genocide and other crimes against \r\nhumanity. Without recognition and condemnation, it \r\nwill be impossible to develop and implement effective \r\nA/66/PV.19  \r\n \r\n11-51185 24 \r\n \r\nmechanisms of prevention, which is a United Nations \r\npriority. Armenia will contribute its utmost to the \r\nrecognition, punishment and prevention of genocide. \r\n These references to the Armenian genocide lead \r\nme to recall another important celebration marked this \r\nyear: the 150th birthday of Fridtjof Nansen, the first \r\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees. In the most difficult \r\nperiod for my nation, that great humanist rendered \r\npriceless support to the survival of the homeland-\r\ndeprived fragments of the Armenian people who had \r\nfled the genocide. Holders of Nansen passports settled \r\nin various countries of the world. They rose to their \r\nfeet and partook in the development of the countries \r\nand peoples that offered them refuge. I believe that \r\njustice and equal rights between States have become \r\nstandards in international relations thanks to such \r\npowerful individuals, who promoted their vision of \r\nmorality in the cruel world of realpolitik. \r\n Speaking from this rostrum in 2008, I expressed \r\nthe hope that the Armenia-Turkey normalization \r\nprocess initiated by us, the establishment of diplomatic \r\nrelations and the opening of the borders closed by \r\nTurkey, in violation of international law, would become \r\nthe first steps towards the launch of a dialogue to \r\novercome the climate of mistrust, suspicion and \r\nuncertainty between us. Although our initiative was \r\ncommended and widely supported by the international \r\ncommunity, Turkey has in all ways possible aborted the \r\nratification and implementation of the protocols we \r\nsigned in 2009. \r\n Today, on the eve of the Rio United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development, political will \r\nmust be exerted to honour the international \r\ncommitments to convert the South Caucasus into a \r\nregion of cooperation and prosperity. \r\n The correlation between security and \r\ndevelopment is not an abstract theory for our region, \r\nwhere economic cooperation and deeper integration \r\nwith the global economy are hampered by unlawful \r\nblockades and the obstruction of regional integration \r\nprojects. Those attitudes, alongside the fuelling of an \r\narms race, not only pose a danger to the peoples of the \r\nregion, but also continue to drain the resources direly \r\nneeded for sustainable development. \r\n The time has come for the leaders of the countries \r\nof our region to stand above the dictates of narrow \r\npolitical agendas and to move towards solutions aimed \r\nat a peaceful and prosperous future for generations to \r\ncome. I want to believe that, in the not-too-distant \r\nfuture, our region will be perceived as a solid and firm \r\nbridge uniting civilizations, rather than as a dividing \r\nline. \r\n Two days ago, the Republic of Armenia \r\ncelebrated the twentieth anniversary of its \r\nindependence. In September 1991, Armenia restored its \r\nindependence, realizing the dream of the Armenian \r\npeople and reuniting with the family of nations. In the \r\nrealm of history, 20 years may seem like a short time, \r\nbut for the current generation it has served as a time of \r\ngreat change, with the building of independent \r\nstatehood and a renewed perception of its role and \r\nplace in the world. I take this opportunity to express \r\nmy gratitude to all the States, peoples and individuals \r\nthat have supported us in these 20 years of \r\ndevelopment and State-building. \r\n Freedom, peace and democracy are our choice, \r\nand we are committed to this path. We are proud of our \r\nachievements today. In two decades, the Republic of \r\nArmenia has implemented a wide-scale programme of \r\nState-building. Much has been done in the fields of \r\ndemocratization, the protection of human rights, \r\neconomic reform, and the establishment of the rule of \r\nlaw and a liberal economy. We have achieved much, \r\nbut much remains to be done. Above all, we are \r\nconvinced that we are on the right path — a path that is \r\nirreversible. \r\n Exactly a decade ago, New York, the city that is \r\nhome to the United Nations, experienced one of the \r\nworst atrocities in the history of humankind — the 9/11 \r\nterrorist attacks. Armenia unconditionally supports and \r\nactively contributes to the international community’s \r\ncounter-terrorism efforts and all the initiatives of the \r\nUnited Nations in this area. We are doing and will \r\ncontinue to do our best to make the world a safer and \r\nmore peaceful place. \r\n We stand ready, to the best of our abilities, to \r\ncontribute to global security and respond to global \r\nthreats, be it through peacekeeping missions, the \r\nelimination of the consequences of natural disasters, \r\nenvironmental protection or the fight against terrorism, \r\nracism and intolerance. Over the years, we have proven \r\nour aspirations and determination with deeds, and we \r\nstand ready to continue doing the same. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Armenia for the statement he has just made. \r\n A/66/PV.19\r\n \r\n25 11-51185 \r\n \r\n Mr. Serzh Sargsyan, President of the Republic of \r\nArmenia, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 8 (continued) \r\n \r\nGeneral debate \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Mahmoud Abbas, Chairman of \r\nthe Executive Committee of the Palestine \r\nLiberation Organization and President of the \r\nPalestinian Authority \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the Chairman of the \r\nExecutive Committee of the Palestine Liberation \r\nOrganization and President of the Palestinian \r\nAuthority.  \r\n Mr. Mahmoud Abbas, Chairman of the Executive \r\nCommittee of the Palestine Liberation Organization \r\nand President of the Palestinian Authority, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I have great \r\npleasure in welcoming Mr. Mahmoud Abbas, Chairman \r\nof the Executive Committee of the Palestinian \r\nLiberation Organization and President of the \r\nPalestinian Authority, and inviting him to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n Mr. Abbas (Palestine) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I extend my congratulations to you, Sir, on your \r\nassumption of the presidency of the General Assembly \r\nfor this session. I wish you every success. \r\n Today, on behalf of the Palestine Liberation \r\nOrganization (PLO) and the Palestinian people, I \r\nextend my sincere congratulations to the Government \r\nand the people of South Sudan on their deserved \r\nadmission as a full Member of the United Nations. We \r\nwish them progress and prosperity. \r\n I also congratulate the Secretary-General, \r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon, on his election for a new term at the \r\nhelm of the United Nations. This renewal of trust \r\nreflects the world’s appreciation for his efforts, which \r\nhave strengthened the role of the Organization. \r\n The question of Palestine is intricately linked \r\nwith the United Nations through the resolutions \r\nadopted by its various organs and agencies and through \r\nthe essential and lauded role of the United Nations \r\nRelief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the \r\nNear East (UNRWA). UNRWA embodies the \r\ninternational responsibility with regard to the plight of \r\nPalestine’s refugees, who are the victims of Al-Nakba, \r\nthe catastrophe that occurred in 1948.  \r\n We aspire to and seek a greater and more \r\neffective role for the United Nations in working to \r\nachieve a just and comprehensive peace in our region, \r\none that ensures the inalienable, legitimate national \r\nrights of the Palestinian people as defined by the \r\nresolutions of international legitimacy and as embodied \r\nby the United Nations. \r\n A year ago, on this same occasion and in this \r\nsame Hall, many leaders and heads of delegations \r\naddressed the stalled peace efforts in our region. \r\nEveryone had high hopes for a new round of final \r\nstatus negotiations, which had begun in early \r\nSeptember in Washington under the direct auspices of \r\nPresident Obama and with participation of the Quartet, \r\nEgypt and Jordan, to reach a peace agreement within \r\none year. We entered those negotiations with open \r\nhearts and attentive ears and sincere intentions. We \r\nwere ready with our documents, files, papers and \r\nproposals. But the negotiations broke down just weeks \r\nafter they were launched. \r\n After that, we did not give up and did not cease \r\nour efforts to craft initiatives and make contacts. Over \r\nthe past year, we did not leave a door to be knocked on \r\nor a channel to be tested or a path to be taken. We did \r\nnot ignore any formal or informal party of influence \r\nand stature that could be addressed. We considered \r\npositively the various ideas and proposals and \r\ninitiatives presented by many countries and parties. But \r\nall of those sincere efforts and endeavours by \r\ninternational parties were repeatedly smashed against \r\nthe rocks of the positions of the Israeli Government, \r\nwhich quickly dashed the hopes raised by the launch of \r\nnegotiations last September. \r\n The core issue here is that the Israeli Government \r\nrefuses to commit to terms of reference for the \r\nnegotiations that are based on international law and \r\nUnited Nations resolutions, and that it frantically \r\ncontinues to intensify the building of settlements on the \r\nterritory of the future State of Palestine. \r\n Settlement activities embody the core of the \r\npolicy of colonial military occupation of the land of the \r\nPalestinian people and all of the brutality, aggression \r\nand racial discrimination against our people that that \r\npolicy entails. The policy constitutes a breach of \r\ninternational humanitarian law and United Nations \r\nA/66/PV.19  \r\n \r\n11-51185 26 \r\n \r\nresolutions. It is the primary cause of the failure of the \r\npeace process, the collapse of dozens of opportunities \r\nand the burial of the great hopes that arose from the \r\nsigning of the Declaration of Principles in 1993 \r\nbetween the Palestine Liberation Organization and \r\nIsrael to achieve a just peace that would begin a new \r\nera for our region. \r\n Reports by United Nations missions and by \r\nseveral Israeli civil institutions and societies convey a \r\nhorrific picture of the size of the settlement campaign, \r\nwhich the Israeli Government does not hesitate to boast \r\nabout and which it continues to execute through the \r\nsystematic confiscation of Palestinian lands. It invites \r\ntenders for the construction of thousands of new \r\nsettlement units in various areas of the West Bank, \r\nparticularly in the Arab parts of Jerusalem. It \r\naccelerates construction of the apartheid separation \r\nWall that is eating up large tracts of our land, dividing \r\nit into separate and isolated islands, destroying family \r\nlife and communities and harming the livelihoods of \r\ntens of thousands of Palestinian families.  \r\n The occupying Power also continues to refuse to \r\nissue permits for our people to build in occupied East \r\nJerusalem. At the same time, it intensifies its decades-\r\nlong campaign of demolition and confiscation of \r\nhomes, displacing Palestinian owners and residents \r\nunder a multipronged policy of ethnic cleansing aimed \r\nat pushing Palestinians away from their ancestral \r\nhomeland. Moreover, matters have reached the point \r\nwhere orders have been issued to deport elected \r\nrepresentatives from their city of Jerusalem.  \r\n The occupying Power also continues to undertake \r\nexcavations that threaten our Holy Places, and its \r\nmilitary checkpoints prevent our citizens from gaining \r\naccess to their mosques and churches. It continues to \r\nbesiege the Holy City with a ring of settlements and a \r\nseparation Wall imposed to separate the Holy City from \r\nthe rest of the cities of Palestine. The occupation is \r\nracing against time to redraw the borders on our land \r\naccording to what it wants and to impose a fait \r\naccompli on the ground that changes its realities and \r\nfeatures and that is undermining the realistic potential \r\nfor the establishment of the State of Palestine. \r\n At the same time, the occupying Power continues \r\nto impose its strict blockade on the Gaza Strip and to \r\ntarget Palestinian civilians by assassinations, air strikes \r\nand artillery shelling. It persists with its war of \r\naggression of three years ago on Gaza, which resulted \r\nthen in the massive destruction of homes, schools, \r\nhospitals and mosques and thousands of martyrs and \r\nwounded. The occupying Power also continues its \r\nincursions into areas of the Palestinian National \r\nAuthority through raids, arrests and killings at the \r\ncheckpoints.  \r\n In recent years, the criminal actions of armed \r\nsettler militias, who enjoy the special protection of the \r\noccupation army, have intensified. They have \r\nperpetrated frequent attacks against our people, \r\ntargeting their homes, schools, universities, mosques, \r\nfields, crops and trees. Today they killed one \r\nPalestinian who was protesting peacefully. Despite our \r\nrepeated warnings, the Israeli authorities have not \r\nacted to curb those attacks, and we hold them fully \r\nresponsible for the crimes of the settlers. \r\n Those are just a few examples of the policy of the \r\nIsraeli settlement occupation. That policy is \r\nresponsible for the repeated failure of the successive \r\ninternational attempts to salvage the peace process. \r\nThe policy will destroy the chances of achieving a two-\r\nState solution, upon which there is an international \r\nconsensus. Here I caution, and I caution aloud, that the \r\nsettlement policy threatens also to undermine the \r\nstructure of the Palestinian National Authority and \r\neven to end its existence. \r\n In addition, we now face new conditions not \r\npreviously imposed, conditions that will transform the \r\nraging conflict in our inflamed region into a religious \r\nconflict, one that will be a threat to the future of a \r\nmillion and a half Palestinians who are citizens of \r\nIsrael. We reject that eventuality; it is impossible for us \r\nto accept being dragged into it. \r\n All of those unilateral Israeli actions in our \r\ncountry are aimed at perpetuating the occupation. \r\nIsrael has re-established the civil and military authority \r\nin the West Bank by a unilateral action, and its military \r\nauthorities determine whether or not a Palestinian \r\ncitizen has the right to reside in any part of the \r\nPalestinian territory. Israel is the entity that decides to \r\nconfiscate our land and our water and to obstruct our \r\nmovement and the movement of goods, and indeed our \r\nwhole destiny. All of that is unilateral. Yet Israel \r\ncomplains of unilateralism — despite our agreements \r\nwith it, which forbid unilateral individual actions.  \r\n In 1974, our leader the late Yasser Arafat came to \r\nthis Hall and assured the members of the General \r\nAssembly of our affirmative pursuit for peace, urging \r\n A/66/PV.19\r\n \r\n27 11-51185 \r\n \r\nthe United Nations to realize the inalienable national \r\nrights of the Palestinian people, stating: “Do not let the \r\nolive branch fall from my hand.” (A/PV.2282, para. 82)  \r\n In 1988, President Arafat again addressed the \r\nGeneral Assembly, which convened in Geneva to hear \r\nhim. There he submitted the Palestinian peace \r\nprogramme adopted by the Palestine National Council \r\nat its session held that year in Algeria. When we \r\nadopted that programme, we were taking a painful and \r\nvery difficult step for all of us, especially those of us, \r\nincluding myself, who during the 1948 Al-Nakba were \r\nforced to leave their homes and their towns and \r\nvillages, carrying only some of our belongings — \r\nalong with our grief and our memories and the keys to \r\nour homes — to camps of exile and diaspora. That \r\ncatastrophic exodus was one of the worst operations of \r\nuprooting, destruction and removal of a vibrant and \r\ncohesive society that had been contributing in a \r\npioneering and leading way to the cultural, educational \r\nand economic renaissance of the Arab Middle East. \r\n Still, because we believe in peace, because of our \r\ncommitment to international legitimacy and because \r\nwe had the courage to make difficult decisions for our \r\npeople, and in the absence of absolute justice, we \r\ndecided to adopt the path of relative justice, justice that \r\nis possible and could correct part of the grave historical \r\ninjustice committed against our people. Thus, we \r\nagreed to establish the State of Palestine on only 22 per \r\ncent of the territory of historical Palestine — on all the \r\nPalestinian territory occupied by Israel in 1967. By \r\ntaking that historic step, which was welcomed by the \r\nStates of the world, we made a major concession in \r\norder to achieve a historic compromise that would \r\nallow peace to be made in the land of peace. \r\n In the years that followed, from the Madrid \r\nConference and the Washington negotiations leading to \r\nthe Oslo agreement, which we signed 18 years ago in \r\nthe White House garden and which was linked with the \r\nletters of mutual recognition — mutual recognition — \r\nbetween the PLO and Israel, we persevered and dealt \r\npositively and responsibly with all efforts aimed at the \r\nachievement of a lasting peace agreement. Yet, as we \r\nsaid earlier, every initiative, every conference, every \r\nnew round of negotiations and every movement was \r\nshattered on the rock of the Israeli settlement \r\nexpansion project. \r\n On behalf of the Palestine Liberation \r\nOrganization — the sole legitimate representative of \r\nthe Palestinian people, which will remain so until the \r\nend of the conflict in all its aspects and until the \r\nresolution of all final status issues — I affirm the \r\nfollowing points.  \r\n The goal of the Palestinian people is the \r\nrealization of their inalienable national rights and of \r\ntheir independent State of Palestine, with East \r\nJerusalem as its capital, on all the land of the West \r\nBank, including East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, \r\nwhich Israel occupied in the June 1967 war. This goal \r\nmust be realized in conformity with the resolutions of \r\ninternational legitimacy and with the achievement of a \r\njust and agreed-upon solution to the Palestine refugee \r\nissue in accordance with General Assembly resolution \r\n194 (III), as stipulated in the Arab Peace Initiative. \r\nThat Initiative presented the consensus Arab and \r\nIslamic vision to resolve the core of the Arab-Israeli \r\nconflict and to achieve the just and comprehensive \r\npeace to which we are committed and are working \r\ntowards.  \r\n We are committed to this. Achieving this much-\r\ndesired peace also requires the release of political \r\nprisoners, prisoners of freedom and Palestinian \r\ndetainees in Israeli prisons without delay. \r\n Secondly, the PLO and the Palestinian people are \r\ncommitted to renouncing violence and reject and \r\ncondemn terrorism in all its forms, especially State \r\nterrorism, including terrorism by settlers. We also \r\nadhere to all agreements signed between the PLO and \r\nIsrael. \r\n Thirdly, we are committed to the option of \r\nnegotiating a lasting solution to the conflict in \r\naccordance with the resolutions of international \r\nlegitimacy. I affirm here that the Palestine Liberation \r\nOrganization is ready to return immediately to the \r\nnegotiating table on the basis of the adopted terms of \r\nreference and consistent with international legitimacy \r\nand a complete cessation of settlement activities. \r\n Fourthly, our people will continue their popular \r\npeaceful resistance to the Israeli occupation, its \r\nsettlement and apartheid policies, and its construction \r\nof the racist separation Wall, and they receive support \r\nfor their resistance that is consistent with international \r\nhumanitarian law and international conventions. They \r\nhave the support of peace activists from Israel and \r\naround the world, reflecting an impressive, inspiring \r\nand courageous example of the strength of this \r\ndefenceless people, armed only with their dreams, \r\nA/66/PV.19  \r\n \r\n11-51185 28 \r\n \r\ncourage, hope and slogans in the face of bullets, tanks, \r\ntear gas and bulldozers. \r\n Fifthly, when we bring our plight and our case to \r\nthis international forum, it is a confirmation of our \r\nreliance on the political and diplomatic option and is a \r\nconfirmation of the fact that we do not undertake \r\nunilateral steps. Our efforts and moves are not aimed at \r\nisolating Israel or at delegitimizing it; rather, we want \r\nto gain legitimacy for the cause of the people of \r\nPalestine. We aim to delegitimize only the settlement \r\nactivities, the occupation and apartheid and the logic of \r\nruthless force, and we believe that all the countries of \r\nthe world stand with us in this regard. \r\n I am here to say on behalf of the Palestinian \r\npeople and the Palestine Liberation Organization that \r\nwe extend our hand to the Israeli Government and the \r\nIsraeli people for peacemaking. I say to them: let us \r\nurgently build together a future for our children where \r\nthey can enjoy freedom, security and prosperity. Let us \r\nbuild bridges of dialogue instead of checkpoints and \r\nwalls of separation. Let us build cooperative relations \r\nbased on parity, equity and friendship between two \r\nneighbouring States — Palestine and Israel — instead \r\nof policies based on occupation, settlement, war and \r\nelimination of the other. \r\n Despite the unquestionable right of our people to \r\nself-determination and to the establishment of an \r\nindependent State, as stipulated in international \r\nresolutions, we have accepted over the past few years \r\nto engage in what appeared to be a test of our \r\nworthiness, entitlement and eligibility. During the past \r\ntwo years, our national Authority has implemented a \r\nprogramme to build our State institutions. Despite the \r\nextraordinary situation and the obstacles imposed on us \r\nby Israel, a serious and extensive project was launched \r\nthat has included the implementation of plans to \r\nenhance and advance the judiciary and the apparatus \r\nfor the maintenance of order and security; the \r\ndevelopment of administrative, financial and oversight \r\nsystems; the upgrading of the performance of \r\ninstitutions; and enhancing self-reliance to reduce the \r\nneed for foreign aid.  \r\n With the support of brotherly Arab countries and \r\ndonors from friendly countries, for which we are \r\nthankful, a number of large infrastructure projects have \r\nbeen implemented, focused on various aspects of \r\nservices, with special attention to rural and \r\nmarginalized areas. In the midst of this massive \r\nnational project, we have been strengthening what we \r\nwish to be the features of our future State: the \r\npreservation of security for citizens and public order; \r\nthe promotion of judicial authority and the rule of law; \r\nstrengthening the role of women via legislation, laws \r\nand participation; ensuring the protection of public \r\nfreedoms and strengthening the role of civil society \r\ninstitutions; and institutionalizing rules and regulations \r\nfor ensuring accountability and transparency in the \r\nwork of our ministries and departments; to entrenching \r\nthe pillars of democracy as the basis of Palestinian \r\npolitical life. \r\n When division struck the unity of our homeland, \r\nour people and our institutions, we were determined to \r\nadopt dialogue as a path to the restoration of our unity. \r\nWe succeeded months ago in achieving national \r\nreconciliation, and we hope that its implementation \r\nwill be accelerated in the coming weeks. The core \r\npillar of this reconciliation involved turning to the \r\npeople through legislative and presidential elections, to \r\nbe conducted within a year, because the State we want \r\nis one characterized by the rule of law, the exercise of \r\ndemocracy, the protection of the freedoms and equality \r\nof all citizens without any discrimination, and the \r\ntransfer of power through the ballot box. \r\n We believe that the reports issued recently by the \r\nUnited Nations, the World Bank, the Ad Hoc Liaison \r\nCommittee for the Coordination of International \r\nAssistance to Palestinians (AHLC) and the \r\nInternational Monetary Fund have confirmed and \r\nlauded what has been accomplished, and have \r\nconsidered it an exceptional and unprecedented model. \r\nThe consensus conclusion of the AHLC a few days ago \r\nhere, in this very city, described what has been \r\naccomplished as a remarkable international success \r\nstory and confirmed the full readiness of the \r\nPalestinian people and their institutions for the \r\nimmediate independence of the State of Palestine. That \r\nwas a testimonial from the international community.  \r\n I do not believe that anyone with even a shred of \r\nconscience could reject our application for full \r\nmembership in the United Nations and our admission \r\nas an independent State. \r\n It is no longer possible to redress the issue of the \r\nblocked horizon of the peace talks with the same \r\nmeans and methods that have been repeatedly tried and \r\nhave proved unsuccessful in past years. \r\n A/66/PV.19\r\n \r\n29 11-51185 \r\n \r\n The crisis is far too deep to be neglected; it is far \r\nmore dangerous and critical to simply be circumvented \r\nor to postpone its inevitable explosion. It is neither \r\npossible, nor practical nor acceptable to return to \r\nconducting business as usual, as if everything were \r\nfine. It is futile to go into negotiations without clear \r\nparameters, terms of reference, credibility or a specific \r\ntimetable. Negotiations will be meaningless as long as \r\nthe occupation army on the ground continues to \r\nentrench its occupation instead of rolling it back, and \r\nto change the demography of our country in order to \r\ncreate a new basis on which to alter the borders. That is \r\ntotally unacceptable. \r\n This is the moment of truth. Our people are \r\nwaiting to hear the world’s answer. Will it allow Israel \r\nto continue the last occupation in the world? We are the \r\nlast people to remain under occupation. Will the world \r\nallow Israel to occupy us forever and to remain a State \r\nabove the law and accountability? Will it allow Israel \r\nto continue rejecting the resolutions of the Security \r\nCouncil and the General Assembly and the \r\nInternational Court of Justice and the positions of the \r\noverwhelming majority of countries in the world? Is \r\nthis acceptable? \r\n The heart of the crisis in our region is very simple \r\nand clear. There are those who believe that we are an \r\nunnecessary people in the Middle East and those who \r\nbelieve that there is in fact a missing State that needs to \r\nbe established immediately. I come before the General \r\nAssembly today from the Holy Land, the land of \r\nPalestine, the land of divine messages, ascension of the \r\nProphet Muhammad and the birthplace of Jesus Christ, \r\nto speak on behalf of the Palestinian people, in the \r\nhomeland and in the diaspora, and to say, after 63 years \r\nof suffering the ongoing Al-Nakba: enough, enough, \r\nenough.  \r\n It is time for the Palestinian people to gain their \r\nfreedom and independence. The time has come to end \r\nthe suffering and the plight of millions of Palestinian \r\nrefugees in the homeland and the diaspora, some of \r\nwhom have been forced to seek refuge more than once \r\nin different places of the world, to end their \r\ndisplacement, and to realize their rights. \r\n At a time when the Arab peoples affirm their \r\nquest for democracy — in what is now called the Arab \r\nSpring — the time has also come for the Palestinian \r\nSpring, the time for independence. The time has come \r\nfor our men, women and children to live normal lives; \r\nfor them to be able to sleep without waiting for the \r\nworst that the next day might bring; for mothers to be \r\nassured that their children will return home without \r\nfear of being killed, arrested or humiliated; for students \r\nto be able to go to their schools and universities \r\nwithout checkpoints obstructing them.  \r\n The time has come for sick people to be able to \r\nreach hospitals normally, and for our farmers to be able \r\nto tend their rich soil without fear that the occupier will \r\nseize their land and water, which the separation wall \r\nprevents access to, and without fear of the settlers with \r\ntheir guard dogs who attack Palestinians. They build \r\ntheir settlements on our lands and uproot and burn \r\nolive trees that have existed in Palestine for hundreds \r\nof years. The time has come for the thousands of \r\nprisoners of conscience and freedom to be released \r\nfrom prisons and return to their families and their \r\nchildren and become a part of building their homeland, \r\nfor the freedom of which they have sacrificed so much. \r\n My people want to exercise their right to enjoy a \r\nnormal life like the rest of humankind. They believe in \r\nwhat our great poet Mahmoud Darwish said: “Standing \r\nhere, staying here, permanent here, eternal here, and \r\nwe have one goal, one goal, one goal ─ to be. And we \r\nshall be.” \r\n We profoundly appreciate and value the positions \r\nof all the States that have supported our struggle and \r\nour rights and recognized the State of Palestine \r\nfollowing the Declaration of Independence in 1988, as \r\nwell as those that have recently recognized the State of \r\nPalestine and upgraded the level of Palestine’s \r\nrepresentation in their capitals. I also salute Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon, who spoke the truth a few days \r\nago when he said that the Palestinian State should have \r\nbeen established years ago. \r\n The General Assembly may rest assured that such \r\nsupport for our people is more valuable to them than \r\nanyone can imagine, for it makes them feel that \r\nsomeone is listening to their narrative and that their \r\ntragedy, the horrors of Al-Nakba and the occupation, \r\nunder which they have suffered terribly, are not being \r\nignored. It reinforces their hope and belief that justice \r\nis possible in this world. The loss of hope is the most \r\nferocious enemy of peace, and despair is the strongest \r\nally of extremism. \r\n The time has come for my courageous and proud \r\npeople, after decades of displacement, colonial \r\noccupation and ceaseless suffering, to live like other \r\nA/66/PV.19  \r\n \r\n11-51185 30 \r\n \r\npeoples of the Earth, free in a sovereign and \r\nindependent homeland. \r\n Mr. President, I would like to inform you that, \r\nbefore delivering this statement, I, in my capacity as \r\nPresident of the State of Palestine and Chairman of the \r\nExecutive Committee of the Palestine Liberation \r\nOrganization, submitted to Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon an application for the admission of Palestine \r\nas a full Member of the United Nations on the basis of \r\nthe 4 June 1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its \r\ncapital. \r\n I hold in my hands a copy of the application. I \r\ncall upon the Secretary-General to expedite transmittal \r\nof our request to the Security Council, and I call upon \r\nthe members of the Council to vote in favour of our \r\nfull membership. I also appeal to the States that have \r\nnot yet done so to recognize the State of Palestine. \r\n The support of the countries of the world for our \r\nendeavour is a victory for rights, freedom, justice, law \r\nand international legitimacy. It will provide \r\ntremendous support for the peace option and enhance \r\nthe negotiations’ chances of success. The Assembly’s \r\nassistance and support for the establishment of the \r\nState of Palestine and for its admission to the United \r\nNations as a full Member State are the greatest \r\ncontribution to peacemaking in the land of peace, and \r\nthroughout the world. \r\n I have come here today carrying a message from \r\na courageous and proud people. Palestine is \r\nexperiencing its rebirth. That is my message. May all \r\nthe people of the world stand with the people of \r\nPalestine now as they march steadfastly to meet their \r\nappointment with history, freedom and independence. \r\nAnd I hope that we will not have long to wait.  \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Chairman of the \r\nExecutive Committee of the Palestine Liberation \r\nOrganization and President of the Palestinian \r\nAuthority, for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Mahmoud Abbas, Chairman of the Executive \r\nCommittee of the Palestine Liberation Organization \r\nand President of the Palestinian Authority, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Yoshihiko Noda, Prime Minister \r\nof Japan \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the Prime Minister of Japan. \r\n Mr. Yoshihiko Noda, Prime Minister of Japan, \r\nwas escorted to the rostrum.  \r\n The President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Yoshihiko Noda, Prime \r\nMinister of Japan, and inviting him to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n Mr. Noda (Japan) (spoke in Japanese; English \r\ntext provided by the delegation): I would like to begin \r\nby congratulating Mr. Al-Nasser on his assumption of \r\nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-\r\nsixth session. I express my gratitude to Mr. Joseph \r\nDeiss for his devoted efforts during his tenure as \r\nPresident of the Assembly at the sixty-fifth session. I \r\nwould also like to pay my deep respects to Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for his leadership. \r\n Mr. Mayr-Harting (Austria), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair. \r\n This has been a year of extraordinary challenges \r\nfor Japan. A little more than six months have passed \r\nsince the Great East Japan Earthquake struck Japan. \r\nNearly 20,000 people were killed or remain missing, \r\nand nearly 40,000 who were forced to evacuate \r\ncontinue to endure inconvenience in their daily lives. I \r\nam truly proud to see the noble spirit of the Japanese \r\npeople manifest itself even amid such despair and \r\nhardship. At the same time, I have been deeply moved \r\nby the strong feelings of compassion shown by people \r\nthe world over towards Japan. There are many \r\nunforgettable stories. \r\n Ms. Rita Retnaningtyas, an Indonesian nurse \r\ncandidate and trainee at the Miyagi Hospital, evacuated \r\n120 patients from the hospital to a safer location just \r\nbefore the arrival of the tsunami. She stayed on at the \r\nhospital for several days, taking care of the patients in \r\nthe absence of electricity and water. \r\n In Brazil, the children of a small rural town \r\ncollected change and sent their contributions to us in a \r\ntin can. I heard that, when asked why, one of the \r\nchildren answered that it was because Japan, a friend \r\nof Brazil, was suffering. \r\n University students in Kenya gathered in Nairobi \r\nin memory of Japanese victims of the earthquake. They \r\n A/66/PV.19\r\n \r\n31 11-51185 \r\n \r\nsang in chorus the popular Japanese song known \r\noutside Japan as “Sukiyaki” — whose original \r\nJapanese title reads “Let Us Walk Looking Up” — \r\nsaying that they wished to deliver the song to the \r\nJapanese people. \r\n Those are only a few such stories among tens of \r\nthousands. The world expressed friendship, solidarity \r\nand praise for the Japanese people immediately after \r\nthe earthquake. On behalf of the people of Japan, I \r\nexpress my heartfelt gratitude for the helping hands \r\nextended from all over the world. These bonds between \r\nJapan and the international community will be forever \r\nremembered by the Japanese. \r\n Since 11 March, the sounds of recovery have \r\nechoed throughout the Tohoku region of Japan. The \r\nGovernment of Japan has exerted every effort to \r\nrestore and reconstruct the disaster-affected areas. The \r\ndaily lives of those outside the affected areas, \r\nincluding the metropolitan area of Tokyo, have \r\nreturned almost to normal. The infrastructure and \r\neconomy of the coastal areas of Tohoku, which were \r\nwashed away by the tsunami, are recovering. Damaged \r\nsupply chains are close to full restoration. We have \r\nbeen sharply reminded of the role that Japanese \r\ncompanies, including small and medium-sized \r\nenterprises, play in sustaining the growth of the global \r\neconomy. \r\n We are making steady progress towards securing \r\nstable control of the situation at the Fukushima Daiichi \r\nnuclear power stations of the Tokyo Electric Power \r\nCompany. Currently, we are focusing our efforts on \r\nmoving up the existing target period to achieve cold \r\nshutdown status by the end of this year. A number of \r\nother challenges remain to be addressed, including the \r\nremoval of debris and rebuilding of the livelihoods of \r\nthe Japanese people in the affected areas. We will \r\ncontinue to be fully engaged in the restoration and \r\nreconstruction efforts as our highest priority task so \r\nthat Japan’s renewal can be realized without delay.  \r\n As the new leader of Japan, I am deeply honoured \r\nto discuss and share Japan’s ambitions for the world’s \r\nfuture, as well as Japan’s diplomatic vision, with all \r\nthose in attendance here today at this meeting of the \r\nGeneral Assembly.  \r\n The world is undergoing tremendous changes, \r\nincluding those now under way in the Middle East and \r\nNorth Africa, which have been brought about by the \r\npeoples’ awakening and their resulting common \r\nawareness. \r\n Through its experience of the massive earthquake \r\nin March, Japan was again made aware of the \r\nimportance of its bonds with the people of the world. \r\nWe have come to fully realize the importance of the \r\nresponsibility to society that is fulfilled by each \r\nindividual. We have never felt more strongly the \r\nsignificance of promoting human security. I am \r\nresolved to implement Japanese diplomacy by working \r\nclosely with all the world leaders here at the United \r\nNations, with the determination to make a substantive \r\ncontribution to overcoming the challenges that the \r\nworld faces and shaping a brighter future for humanity. \r\n Allow me to touch on Japan’s efforts to help the \r\nworld economy grow. Japan has a long history of \r\nassisting developing countries to create prosperous \r\nsocieties through nation-building and human-resource \r\ndevelopment. From our own experience, we understand \r\nvery well that the engine of economic growth is a \r\nstrong middle class. In order to strengthen that middle \r\nclass, we must construct a social framework within \r\nwhich all individuals can strengthen their capacities \r\nand develop them to the full. In this regard, Japan will \r\ncontinue to actively support developing countries \r\nthrough its official development assistance. \r\n We must not let the current global economic \r\nuncertainty and financial unrest hamper the efforts of \r\nthe international community to achieve growth. It is \r\nvital that all countries cooperate in order to bring \r\nharmony out of the current chaos. I myself am \r\ncommitted to doing my best as the new leader of Japan. \r\nAchieving economic growth in tandem with fiscal \r\nhealth is the most crucial challenge confronting the \r\nworld at the present time. Japan will press ahead with \r\nits targets for restoring fiscal sustainability. \r\nMeanwhile, as we recognize that revitalizing the \r\nJapanese economy is directly linked to rebuilding the \r\nworld economy, we will work on strengthening \r\nindustrial infrastructure, employment and energy \r\nconservation in our efforts to achieve a full recovery \r\nfrom the earthquake disaster. In the mid-to-long term, \r\nwe intend to further reinforce partnerships between the \r\nJapanese and other global economies. It is also \r\nimportant that trade activities not be disturbed by \r\nexcessive currency volatility. \r\n Furthermore, in order to help realize sustainable \r\ngrowth of the Japanese economy, we will work to \r\nA/66/PV.19  \r\n \r\n11-51185 32 \r\n \r\nachieve a low-carbon society and a transition to a green \r\neconomy. The key to achieving these goals is \r\ntechnological innovation in the areas of renewable \r\nenergies, saving energy and the clean use of fossil \r\nfuels, all of which are considered part of green \r\ninnovation. By next summer, the Government of Japan \r\nwill have created a new strategy and plan for the \r\ncomposition of Japan’s mid- to long-term energy use, \r\naimed at making a bold shift on energy policy. Japan \r\nwill also further improve on its excellent, safe, secure \r\nand environmentally friendly technologies, represented \r\nby energy-efficient houses and electric appliances and \r\nvehicles, contributing to the growth of the global \r\neconomy and to a brighter future for all during the \r\ndiscussions leading up to the 2012 United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development. \r\n Japan will throw all its efforts into seeking a safe \r\nand brighter future. The run-up height, which is the \r\nmaximum onshore vertical height above sea level, of \r\nthe tsunami that hit the Tohoku district reached as high \r\nas 40 metres, the highest in Japan in recorded history. \r\nWe have learned that we must be very well prepared. In \r\nthat regard, there are contributions that Japan, with \r\nsuch experience behind it, is uniquely qualified to \r\nmake. The first lesson to be learned from Japan’s \r\nrecent tragedy is the importance of international \r\ncooperation in disaster risk reduction. \r\n We have a long history of combating and \r\novercoming natural disasters. In fact, we have actively \r\nsupported the response efforts to the disasters that have \r\noccurred in recent years in areas such as Sumatra, \r\nSichuan in China, Haiti and New Zealand. As a country \r\nthat has learned to coexist harmoniously with nature, \r\nwe are prepared to share with the world our \r\naccumulated knowledge and skills. As a first step, \r\nJapan will hold an international conference in the \r\ndisaster-stricken Tohoku region next year designed to \r\nimprove international cooperation on coping with \r\nnatural disasters. To build on the outcome of that \r\nconference, Japan proposes to host the Third United \r\nNations World Conference on Disaster Reduction in \r\n2015, and plans to take a leading role in the \r\ninternational community in creating a disaster-resistant \r\nworld. \r\n Next, Japan hopes to share its acquired \r\nknowledge and experience in the field of nuclear \r\nsafety. I welcomed yesterday’s high-level meeting on \r\nthis issue held at the initiative of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. Following the nuclear accident, Japan has \r\nimplemented emergency safety measures and further \r\nstrengthened its nuclear energy regulation regime. In \r\nyesterday’s meeting, I expressed my resolve to \r\ncontribute positively to the reinforcement of global \r\nnuclear power safety, drawing on our experiences with \r\nthe accident. \r\n Next year, Japan will co-host an international \r\nconference with the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency to share the results of the overall assessment of \r\nthe accident in comprehensive detail, and to contribute \r\nto the various measures taken by the international \r\ncommunity to raise standards for nuclear safety. \r\nAlthough some countries, regrettably, are still \r\nimposing undue restrictions on imports from Japan, our \r\nGovernment will continue to provide prompt, accurate \r\nand transparent information on this matter. I would \r\nrequest that all countries make sensible judgements \r\nbased on scientific evidence. \r\n Global threats continue to proliferate. It is \r\nessential to deal with the root causes of such threats \r\nwhile taking steps to address them. Japan will continue \r\nto respond to those challenges in order to ensure a \r\nbrighter and more peaceful future. With regard to the \r\nissue of piracy off the coast of Somalia, Japan will \r\nremain actively engaged in combating the problem \r\nthrough continued deployment to the area of two \r\ndestroyers and two patrol aircraft. \r\n Japan intends to enhance its efforts to eradicate \r\nterrorism and its causes. Though a decade has passed \r\nsince the 9/11 attacks, our collective sorrow has yet to \r\nheal. And in that connection, I would like to express \r\nmy sincere condolences on the death of Mr. Rabbani, \r\nChairman of Afghanistan’s High Peace Council. Japan \r\nreiterates its firm condemnation of such atrocious acts \r\nof terrorism. In order to prevent Afghanistan from once \r\nagain becoming a breeding ground for terrorism, we \r\nwill continue to confront the problem with strong \r\nresolve. Japan has expressed its commitment to \r\nproviding approximately $5 billion in assistance over \r\nfive years beginning in 2009, focusing on security, \r\nreintegrating former insurgents into society, and \r\ndevelopment, and will continue to implement that \r\ncommitment. \r\n United Nations peacekeeping missions are being \r\ndispatched to fragile and conflict-prone States. Japan \r\nwill contribute to peacebuilding efforts by actively \r\nparticipating in those operations. We must further \r\nimprove the conditions that promote that goal. At the \r\n A/66/PV.19\r\n \r\n33 11-51185 \r\n \r\nsame time, we will do our best to achieve the ideal of a \r\nworld without nuclear weapons through such efforts as \r\nthe multi-country non-proliferation and disarmament \r\ninitiative. \r\n The nuclear and missile issues of the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea pose a threat to the entire \r\ninternational community, and Japan continues to urge \r\nthat country to take concrete steps towards resolving \r\nthose issues. In particular, the abduction issue \r\nrepresents a violation of basic human rights. It is thus \r\nan issue of universal import and a matter of great \r\nconcern for the entire international community. Japan \r\nis committed to exerting all possible efforts to achieve \r\nthe return of all the victims at the earliest possible date, \r\nthrough strengthened coordination with other Member \r\nStates. \r\n With regard to relations between Japan and the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea, Japan intends \r\nto maintain its efforts to comprehensively resolve the \r\noutstanding issues of concern, settle the unfortunate \r\npast and normalize relations, in accordance with the \r\nJapan-Democratic People’s Republic of Korea \r\nPyongyang Declaration of 2007. Japan urges the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea to take \r\npositive steps in order that our countries may have a \r\ndialogue toward this goal. \r\n In recent years, the role of the United Nations has \r\ntaken on greater significance than ever. In order for the \r\nUnited Nations to tackle such issues more effectively, \r\nJapan will continue to support increasing effectiveness \r\nand efficiency in reinforcing the functions of the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n Security Council reform is absolutely necessary \r\nin that respect. We must revitalize the stagnated reform \r\nprocess. All Member States must proactively commit to \r\nthe reform with a sense of urgency. The credibility of \r\nthe United Nations is at stake. Japan intends to launch \r\nsubstantive negotiations toward the reform with like-\r\nminded Members, in order to achieve tangible results \r\nduring the current session. \r\n As I promised moments ago, Japan will recover \r\nfrom the earthquake disaster and seek a peaceful, safe \r\nand brighter future, side by side with the leaders \r\ngathered here. For that purpose, Japan will maintain its \r\ncontribution to the attainment of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, focusing on health and education. \r\nMoreover, Japan will continue its contribution to the \r\ndevelopment of Africa by hosting the Fifth Tokyo \r\nInternational Conference on African Development in \r\n2013. Regarding the support intended to enable \r\ndeveloping countries to address climate change, Japan \r\nwill implement its quick-start finance commitments up \r\nto next year. Japan will continue its support beyond \r\n2012. \r\n Today, I would like to announce Japan’s new \r\ncommitments. First, I wish to congratulate the people \r\nof the Republic of South Sudan on achieving their \r\nindependence, and provide assurances that Japan will \r\nextend wherever possible support for the nation-\r\nbuilding efforts in South Sudan as well as for the \r\nconsolidation of peace in the region. Japan is eager to \r\ncontribute to the United Nations Mission in South \r\nSudan in the fields in which Japan excels. From this \r\npoint of view, we are preparing to dispatch Japanese \r\nSelf-Defence Forces personnel to Mission \r\nHeadquarters as staff officers. Japan is also interested \r\nin dispatching an engineering unit of our Self-Defence \r\nForces, regarding which the United Nations has \r\nexpressed high expectations. Japan therefore will \r\nconduct the necessary field study as early as possible. \r\n Second, Japan will remain actively involved in \r\nthe international community’s efforts with regard to \r\nhumanitarian crises. One of the most pressing \r\nchallenges at present is the drought in the Horn of \r\nAfrica, which is directly affecting the children of the \r\nregion. To mitigate this suffering as effectively as \r\npossible, Japan will provide further humanitarian aid in \r\naddition to the approximately $100 million in \r\nassistance that it has already implemented. \r\n The last commitment I wish to announce \r\nconcerns the Middle East and North Africa. Japan will \r\nsupport reform and democratization efforts in this \r\nregion, which is now undergoing a massive change that \r\nis often referred to as the Arab Spring. To improve the \r\nemployment situation and support human resources \r\ndevelopment in the region, Japan is prepared to extend \r\nan additional yen loan worth approximately $1 billion \r\nfor projects that are expected to contribute to \r\ninfrastructure building and industrial development.  \r\n Moreover, we will provide support to ensure fair \r\nelections in Tunisia and Egypt, where polls are \r\nscheduled to be held in autumn of this year. For a new \r\nLibya, Japan will support the country’s nation-building \r\nefforts in cooperation with the international \r\ncommunity, utilizing its expertise and technological \r\ncapacity. At the same time, Japan will deepen \r\nA/66/PV.19  \r\n \r\n11-51185 34 \r\n \r\neconomic relations with Middle Eastern and North \r\nAfrican countries by further promoting trade and \r\ninvestment through such means as trade insurance and \r\nexport loans. As Middle East peace represents the \r\nlinchpin for the peace and stability of the region, Japan \r\nwill make active efforts, such as extending assistance \r\nto the Palestinians, for the realization of the two-State \r\nsolution. \r\n To conclude my statement, I will touch briefly \r\nupon what I have felt in the aftermath of the Great East \r\nJapan Earthquake. After the events of 11 March this \r\nyear, I strongly felt the magnificence of a society in \r\nwhich each individual undertakes actions in an orderly \r\nmanner, a society in which people help each other. In \r\naddition, all lines of the Tohoku shinkansen bullet \r\ntrains, including a train that was running at \r\n270 kilometres per hour at the time of the earthquake, \r\nmade emergency stops safely, without causing a single \r\ninjury. I believe this fact bears witness to Japan’s high \r\nlevel of technical advancement. \r\n I thus believe in the strength of the Japanese \r\npeople, which comes to the fore most prominently in \r\ntimes of crisis. I am certain that such resilience, both \r\nhuman and technological, which does not yield in the \r\nface of enormous difficulties, will be the very source of \r\nJapan’s future contribution to the international \r\ncommunity. \r\n Let us take up the challenges for the resolution of \r\nthe issues confronting the world today, with strong \r\ndetermination to pave the way to a brighter future for \r\nhumanity. As the new leader of Japan, I am determined \r\nto make progress step by step towards a more peaceful, \r\nprosperous and positive future, hand in hand with the \r\nleaders assembled here today. \r\n The people of Japan as well as the Government \r\nare determined to overcome any and all difficulties. We \r\nwill continue our contribution towards a brighter future \r\nfor the people of the world. \r\n I wish to close my statement by reiterating our \r\nfirm determination. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of Japan \r\nfor the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Yoshihiko Noda, the Prime Minister of Japan, \r\nwas escorted from the rostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Lyonchoen Jigmi Yoezer \r\nThinley, Prime Minister of the Kingdom  \r\nof Bhutan \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear a statement by the Prime Minister of the Kingdom \r\nof Bhutan. \r\n Mr. Lyonchoen Jigmi Yoezer Thinley, Prime \r\nMinister of the Kingdom of Bhutan, was escorted \r\nto the rostrum. \r\n The Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Lyonchoen Jigmi \r\nYoezer Thinley, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of \r\nBhutan, and inviting him to address the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n Mr. Thinley: My country is most happy to \r\nwelcome South Sudan as a member of the United \r\nNations family. I now seek the permission of the \r\nMembers to speak on the subject of happiness. \r\n Since joining the United Nations 41 years ago, \r\nBhutan has always maintained a long-term and broad \r\nperspective on the purpose of this great Organization, \r\nwhich is to create a secure and harmonious society. But \r\nin the many times that I have participated in the United \r\nNations General Assembly over the last 25 years, I \r\ncannot recall a session that gave me reason for hope for \r\nthe future of humanity, except once. That was when the \r\ncold war came to a thundering halt, and a euphoric \r\nworld saw it as the dawn of a new era. I was then a \r\nyoung ambassador excited by the prospects of peace \r\ndividends. Instead, what followed was a sense of \r\nbetrayal and disillusionment, as the world became ever \r\nmore divided and insecure. \r\n We gather before this high podium, year after \r\nyear, and make of this annual gathering a mournful \r\nevent. We speak of what ought to be, of promises \r\nbroken and opportunities lost. We speak of endless \r\nconflicts within and among nations, of the failures of \r\nGovernments, of frequent and devastating disasters, of \r\ndiminishing resources and fierce competition for their \r\ncontrol, of dying ecosystems and new threatening \r\ndiseases and epidemics, and of financial calamities and \r\neconomic ruin. We speak of rising unemployment, \r\nhopeless poverty, hunger and destitution. And of \r\ncourse, we talk of solutions. \r\n Lacking the political will and, indeed, clarity of \r\nvision, we deny with clever arguments what we know \r\nto be the cause of our predicaments. So we go on doing \r\n A/66/PV.19\r\n \r\n35 11-51185 \r\n \r\nwhat is irrational. We continue to acquire arms to \r\nprevent war; answer climate change with more harmful \r\nemissions; race to extract, produce and consume more \r\nin the face of depleting resources; fuel faltering \r\neconomies with debt and greed; and enable the wealthy \r\nto widen the deep crevasses that separate the rich from \r\nthe poor. We idealize individualism as family and \r\ncommunity crumble amid rising social dislocation, \r\ncrime, mental illness, loneliness and suicide. \r\n For too long, we have ignored the truth that the \r\ncauses of all those problems are interrelated and that \r\ndurable remedies must be found through a rational and \r\nholistic approach. For too long, we have refused to \r\naccept that economic models focused on gross \r\ndomestic product have served their useful purpose and \r\nthat we need to switch tracks. Guided by the misbelief \r\nthat life satisfaction is about material pursuit and \r\naccumulation and that good economics is about \r\nlimitless growth, our economic development processes \r\nhave created the monster of a consumerist market \r\neconomy. \r\n However, the market gives no satisfaction. It \r\nenslaves humanity and thrives on the insatiable nature \r\nof our greed. As slaves, our value as individuals and \r\nnations is measured by the extent of our economic \r\nproductivity and consumption capacity. That sad \r\ntransformation, from humans into voracious beasts, \r\ncomes at the cost of our physical, psychological and \r\nspiritual well-being. It is destroying our natural life-\r\nsupport systems and threatening our long-term \r\nsurvival. But that need not be so. \r\n Humankind is in need of a clear vision that \r\ntranscends the diversity of our cultures, thoughts and \r\ncircumstances and binds us to a common pursuit. We \r\nneed a different development paradigm that is guided \r\nby a vision that is holistic, sustainable, inclusive and \r\nhumane. Such a vision can take civilization forward \r\nand enable it to sustain the progress that it has created \r\nand must continue to make. \r\n It is therefore with a great sense of joy that my \r\ncountry welcomed resolution 65/309, entitled \r\n“Happiness: towards a holistic approach to \r\ndevelopment”. Introduced by Bhutan and sponsored by \r\n68 Member States, it was adopted unanimously without \r\na vote in July. Through that resolution, Member States \r\nadopted a universal goal, while acknowledging the \r\nlimitations of our conventional development processes. \r\nIt commits our nations to creating the necessary \r\npolitical, social and economic conditions to enable the \r\npursuit of happiness by citizens within a stable \r\nenvironment. \r\n My delegation is of the firm conviction that \r\nhappiness or well-being, as it is promoted in my \r\ncountry, would be against a well-developed set of \r\nindices, a natural progression from the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, which aim to establish the \r\nminimum conditions for human survival and the basis \r\nfor development. It is, indeed, a universal value that \r\nbinds the rich and the poor, and the developed and the \r\ndeveloping, and articulates the ultimate purpose of life. \r\nIt is about making true societal progress in ways that \r\nare meaningful, joyful and lasting. \r\n In that regard, I am happy to report that my \r\nGovernment, in collaboration with the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme, the Earth Institute of \r\nColumbia University and leading scientists and \r\nthinkers on the science and economics of happiness, \r\nare working in concert to prepare the panel discussion \r\nstipulated by the resolution. Proposed to be held in \r\nNew York in the spring of 2012 before the United \r\nNations Conference on Sustainable Development, the \r\nmeeting will endeavour to present to Member States a \r\nset of policy recommendations in their pursuit of \r\nhappiness as they work in harmonious collaboration \r\nwith each other with a shared and clear sense of \r\npurpose. We look forward to Members’ participation in \r\nthat meeting. \r\n My delegation remains fully committed to the \r\npromotion of a sustainable and progressive human \r\ncivilization within a peaceful and secure environment. \r\nTo that happy end, Bhutan is prepared to share its \r\nexperience and the modest development achievements \r\nmade with the support of our generous partners. Our \r\nattempts to promote equitable and sustainable social \r\neconomic growth are bearing fruit within a rich \r\nbiodiversity that includes a forest cover that has \r\nexpanded from 64 per cent to 81 per cent in four \r\ndecades. Today, Bhutan is the only country that has \r\npledged to remain carbon neutral forever. Our social \r\nand cultural values remain vital, even as we embrace \r\nglobalization and its many offerings. We have \r\nsuccessfully and smoothly transited from an absolute \r\nmonarchy to a fully fledged and vibrant democracy. \r\n For those reasons and out of a sense of duty and \r\nobligation, my country aspires to serve as a non-permanent \r\nmember on the Security Council for the biennium \r\nA/66/PV.19  \r\n \r\n11-51185 36 \r\n \r\n2013-2014. Having been a member of the United \r\nNations for 41 years and never having served on the \r\nCouncil, while having fully enjoyed the benefits of \r\nmembership, we wish to contribute as a small State for \r\nsmall States. We believe that we can bring to the \r\nSecurity Council a fresh and holistic perspective on \r\npeace and security beyond its narrow confines and \r\nopen it to new and innovative approaches to fulfilling \r\nits important mandate. My country is of the firm belief \r\nthat maintaining peace and security is not only about \r\npreventing war. It is about recognizing and forging the \r\nwill to deal with all forms of threat to the survival, \r\nprogress and happiness of human society. \r\n Yes, I speak of a dream, but it is possible. As \r\nleaders and representatives of our peoples, we must \r\ndare to dream and find the courage and determination \r\nto pursue the highest of ideals. That is how happiness \r\nis to be fashioned. Blessings and good luck! \r\n My country prays for Members’ support to give \r\nBhutan an opportunity to contribute to the realization \r\nof shared dreams. I wish participants happiness. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nKingdom of Bhutan for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Lyonchoen Jigmi Yoezer Thinley, Prime \r\nMinister of the Kingdom of Bhutan, was escorted \r\nfrom the rostrum. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime \r\nMinister of the State of Israel \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the State of \r\nIsrael. \r\n Mr. Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister of the \r\nState of Israel, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Benjamin Netanyahu, \r\nPrime Minister of the State of Israel, and inviting him \r\nto address the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Netanyahu (Israel): Israel has extended its \r\nhand in peace from the moment it was established \r\n63 years ago. On behalf of Israel and the Jewish \r\npeople, I extend that hand again today. I extend it to \r\nthe people of Egypt and Jordan, with renewed \r\nfriendship for neighbours with whom we have made \r\npeace. I extend it to the people of Turkey, with respect \r\nand goodwill. I extend it to the people of Libya and \r\nTunisia, with admiration for those trying to build a \r\ndemocratic future. I extend it to the other peoples of \r\nNorth Africa and the Arabian peninsula, with whom we \r\nwant to forge a new beginning. I extend it to the people \r\nof Syria, Lebanon and Iran, with awe at the courage of \r\nthose fighting brutal repression.  \r\n Most especially, I extend my hand to the \r\nPalestinian people, with whom we seek a just and \r\nlasting peace. \r\n In Israel, our hope for peace never wanes. Our \r\nscientists, doctors and innovators apply their genius to \r\nimproving the world of tomorrow. Our artists and our \r\nwriters enrich the heritage of humanity. Now, I know \r\nthat this is not exactly the image of Israel that is often \r\nportrayed in this Hall. After all, it was here in 1975 that \r\nthe age-old yearning of my people to restore our \r\nnational life in our ancient biblical homeland was \r\nbranded, shamefully, as racism. It was right here in \r\n1980 that the historic peace agreement between Israel \r\nand Egypt was not praised, but denounced. It is here, \r\nyear after year, that Israel is unjustly singled out for \r\ncondemnation. It is singled out for condemnation more \r\noften than all the nations of the world combined. \r\nTwenty-one out of 27 relevant General Assembly \r\nresolutions condemn Israel, the one true democracy in \r\nthe Middle East.  \r\n This is an unfortunate part of the United Nations \r\ninstitution. It is the theatre of the absurd. It not only \r\ncasts Israel as the villain, it often casts real villains in \r\nleading roles. Al-Qadhafi’s Libya chaired the \r\nCommission on Human Rights. Saddam’s Iraq headed \r\nthe Conference on Disarmament.  \r\n One might say that is the past. Well, here is what \r\nis happening now — right now, today. Hizbullah-\r\ncontrolled Lebanon now presides over the Security \r\nCouncil. This means, in effect, that a terror \r\norganization presides over the body entrusted with \r\nguaranteeing the world’s security. One could not make \r\nthis up. Here in the United Nations, automatic \r\nmajorities can decide anything. They can decide that \r\nthe sun rises in the west. They can also decide — they \r\nhave decided — that the Western Wall in Jerusalem, \r\nJudaism’s holiest place, is occupied Palestinian \r\nterritory. \r\n Yet, even here in the General Assembly, the truth \r\ncan sometimes break through. In 1984, when I was \r\nappointed Israel’s Ambassador to the United Nations, I \r\n A/66/PV.19\r\n \r\n37 11-51185 \r\n \r\nvisited the great rabbi of Lubavitch. He said to me — \r\nand I do not want anyone here to be offended, because \r\nfrom personal experience of serving here, I know there \r\nare many honourable men and women, many capable \r\nand decent people, serving their nations here — but \r\nhere is what the rebbe said to me. He said, “You will be \r\nserving in a house of many lies”. And then he said, \r\n“Remember that, even in the darkest place, the light of \r\na single candle can be seen far and wide”. Today I hope \r\nthat the light of truth will shine, if only for a few \r\nminutes, in a Hall that for too long has been a place of \r\ndarkness for my country.  \r\n As Israel’s Prime Minister, I did not come here to \r\nwin applause. I came here to speak the truth. The truth \r\nis that Israel wants peace. The truth is that I want \r\npeace. The truth is that in the Middle East, at all times \r\nbut especially during these turbulent days, peace must \r\nbe anchored in security. The truth is that we can \r\nachieve peace not through United Nations resolutions, \r\nbut only through direct negotiations between the \r\nparties. The truth is that so far the Palestinians have \r\nrefused to negotiate. The truth is that Israel wants \r\npeace with a Palestinian State, but the Palestinians \r\nwant a State without peace. The truth is that the \r\nAssembly should not let that happen. \r\n When I first came here 27 years ago, the world \r\nwas divided between East and West. Since then, the \r\nCold War ended, great civilizations have risen from \r\ncenturies of slumber, hundreds of millions have been \r\nlifted out of poverty, countless more are poised to \r\nfollow, and the remarkable thing is that, so far, this \r\nmonumental historic shift has largely occurred \r\npeacefully.  \r\n Yet a malignancy is now growing between East \r\nand West that threatens the peace of all. It seeks not to \r\nliberate, but to enslave; not to build, but to destroy. \r\nThat malignancy is militant Islam. It cloaks itself in the \r\nmantle of a great faith, yet it murders Jews, Christians \r\nand Muslims alike with unforgiving impartiality. On \r\n11 September 2001, it killed thousands of Americans \r\nand left the twin towers in smouldering ruins. Last \r\nnight, I laid a wreath on the 9/11 memorial. It was \r\ndeeply moving. However, as I was going there, one \r\nthing echoed in my mind: the outrageous words of the \r\nPresident of Iran at this rostrum yesterday. He implied \r\nthat 9/11 was an American conspiracy. Some left this \r\nHall; everyone should have. \r\n Since 9/11, militant Islamists have slaughtered \r\ncountless other innocents in London and Madrid, in \r\nBaghdad and Mumbai, in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, and \r\nin every part of Israel. I believe that the greatest danger \r\nfacing our world is that this fanaticism will arm itself \r\nwith nuclear weapons, and that is precisely what Iran is \r\ntrying to do. Can we imagine that man who ranted here \r\nyesterday armed with nuclear weapons? \r\n The international community must stop Iran \r\nbefore it is too late. If Iran is not stopped, we will all \r\nface the spectre of nuclear terrorism, and the Arab \r\nSpring could soon become an Iranian winter. That \r\nwould be a tragedy. Millions of Arabs have taken to the \r\nstreets to replace tyranny with liberty, and no one \r\nwould benefit more than Israel if those committed to \r\nfreedom and peace would prevail. \r\n That is my fervent hope, but as the Prime \r\nMinister of Israel, I cannot risk the future of the Jewish \r\nState on wishful thinking. Leaders must see reality as it \r\nis, not as it ought to be. We must do our best to shape \r\nthe future, but we cannot wish away the dangers of the \r\npresent. \r\n The world around Israel is definitely becoming \r\nmore dangerous. Militant Islam has already taken over \r\nLebanon and Gaza. It is determined to tear apart the \r\npeace treaties between Israel and Egypt and between \r\nIsrael and Jordan. It has poisoned many Arab minds \r\nagainst Jews and Israel, and against America and the \r\nWest. It opposes not the policies of Israel but the \r\nexistence of Israel. \r\n Now, some argue that if we want to slow down \r\nthe spread of militant Islam, especially in these \r\nturbulent times, Israel must hurry to make concessions, \r\nincluding territorial compromises. And this theory \r\nsounds simple. Basically it goes like this: leave the \r\nterritory and peace will be advanced. The moderates \r\nwill be strengthened; the radicals will be kept at bay. \r\nAnd do not worry about the pesky details of how Israel \r\nwill actually defend itself; international troops will do \r\nthe job. \r\n These people say to me constantly, “Just make a \r\nsweeping offer, and everything will work out”. There is \r\nonly one problem with that theory. We have tried it and \r\nit has not worked. In 2000, Israel made a sweeping \r\npeace offer that met virtually all the Palestinian \r\ndemands. Chairman Arafat rejected it. The Palestinians \r\nthen launched a terror attack that claimed 1,000 Israeli \r\nlives. \r\nA/66/PV.19  \r\n \r\n11-51185 38 \r\n \r\n In 2008, Prime Minister Olmert afterwards made \r\nan even more sweeping offer. President Abbas did not \r\neven respond to it. But Israel did more than just make \r\nsweeping offers. We actually left territory. We \r\nwithdrew from Lebanon in 2000 and from every square \r\ninch of Gaza in 2005. That did not calm the militant \r\nIslamic storm that threatens us. It only brought the \r\nstorm closer and made it stronger. Hizbullah and \r\nHamas fired thousands of rockets against our cities \r\nfrom the very territories we had vacated.  \r\n When Israel left Lebanon and Gaza, the \r\nmoderates did not defeat the radicals; the moderates \r\nwere devoured by the radicals. And I regret to say that \r\ninternational troops, including those of the United \r\nNations Interim Force in Lebanon and the European \r\nUnion Border Assistance Mission in Gaza, did not stop \r\nthe radicals from attacking Israel. \r\n We left Gaza hoping for peace. We did not freeze \r\nthe settlements in Gaza; we uprooted them. We did \r\nexactly what the theory says. We got out, went back to \r\nthe 1967 borders and dismantled the settlements. I do \r\nnot think people remember how far we went to achieve \r\nthis. We uprooted thousands of people from their \r\nhomes. We pulled children out of their schools and \r\ntheir kindergartens. We bulldozed synagogues. We \r\neven moved loved ones from their graves. And then, \r\nhaving done all that, we gave the keys of Gaza to \r\nPresident Abbas. \r\n The theory says that it should have all worked \r\nout, and that President Abbas and the Palestinian \r\nAuthority could now build a peaceful state in Gaza. We \r\nall remember that the entire world applauded our \r\nwithdrawal as an act of great statesmanship and a bold \r\nact of peace. But we did not get peace. We got war. We \r\ngot Iran, which, through its proxy, Hamas, promptly \r\nkicked out the Palestinian Authority. The Palestinian \r\nAuthority collapsed in a day — in one day.  \r\n President Abbas just said from this rostrum that \r\nthe Palestinians are armed only with their hopes and \r\ndreams. Yes, they are armed with their hopes, dreams \r\nand 10,000 missiles and Grad rockets supplied by Iran, \r\nnot to mention the river of lethal weapons now flowing \r\ninto Gaza from the Sinai, from Libya and from \r\nelsewhere. \r\n Thousands of missiles have already rained down \r\non our cities. So it might be understand, given all this, \r\nwhy Israelis rightly ask, “What is to prevent this from \r\nhappening again in the West Bank?” Most of the major \r\ncities in the south of our country are within a few \r\ndozen kilometres from Gaza, but in the centre of the \r\ncountry opposite the West Bank, our cities are a few \r\nhundred metres or at most a few kilometres from the \r\nedge of the West Bank. \r\n So I want to ask: Would anyone here bring danger \r\nso close to their cities and families? Would they act so \r\nrecklessly with the lives of their citizens? Israel is \r\nprepared to have a Palestinian State in the West Bank, \r\nbut we are not prepared to have another Gaza there. \r\nAnd that is why we need to have real security \r\narrangements, which the Palestinians simply refuse to \r\nnegotiate with us. \r\n Israelis remember the bitter lessons of Gaza. \r\nMany of Israel’s critics ignore them. They \r\nirresponsibly advise Israel to go down this same \r\nperilous path again. We read what these people say and \r\nit is as if nothing happened. They just repeat the same \r\nadvice and the same formulas as though none of this \r\nhappened. And these critics continue to press Israel to \r\nmake far-reaching concessions without first assuring \r\nIsrael’s security. They praise those who unwittingly \r\nfeed the insatiable crocodile of militant Islam as bold \r\nstatesmen. They cast as enemies of peace those of us \r\nwho insist that we must first erect a sturdy barrier to \r\nkeep the crocodile out, or at the very least jam an iron \r\nbar between its gaping jaws. \r\n So in the face of the labels and the libels, Israel \r\nmust heed better advice. It is better to receive bad press \r\nthan a good eulogy, and better still would be a fair \r\npress whose sense of history extends beyond breakfast \r\nand that recognizes Israel’s legitimate security \r\nconcerns. I believe that in serious peace negotiations, \r\nthese needs and concerns can be properly addressed, \r\nbut they will not be addressed without negotiations.  \r\n And the needs are many, because Israel is such a \r\ntiny country. Without Judea and Samaria — the West \r\nBank — Israel is all of nine miles wide. I want to put \r\nthat in perspective for all of us in this city. It is about \r\ntwo-thirds the length of Manhattan. It is the distance \r\nbetween Battery Park and Columbia University. And \r\nlet us not forget that the people who live in Brooklyn \r\nand New Jersey are considerably nicer than some of \r\nIsrael’s neighbours.  \r\n So how does one protect such a tiny country, \r\nsurrounded by people sworn to its destruction and \r\narmed to the teeth by Iran? Obviously, one cannot \r\ndefend it from within that narrow space alone. Israel \r\n A/66/PV.19\r\n \r\n39 11-51185 \r\n \r\nneeds greater strategic depth, and that is exactly why \r\nSecurity Council resolution 242 (1967) did not require \r\nIsrael to leave all of the territories it captured in the \r\nSix-Day War. It talked about withdrawal from \r\nterritories to secure and defensible boundaries. And to \r\ndefend itself, Israel must therefore maintain a long-\r\nterm Israeli military presence in critical strategic areas \r\nin the West Bank. \r\n I explained this to President Abbas. He answered \r\nthat if a Palestinian State was to be a sovereign \r\ncountry, it could never accept such arrangements. Why \r\nnot? The United States has had troops in Japan, \r\nGermany and South Korea for more than a half a \r\ncentury. Britain has an air base in Cyprus. France has \r\nforces in three independent African nations. None of \r\nthose States claim that they are not sovereign countries.  \r\n There are many other vital security issues that \r\nalso must be addressed. Take the issue of airspace. \r\nAgain, Israel’s small dimensions create huge security \r\nproblems. The United States can be crossed by jet \r\nairplane in six hours. To fly across Israel, it takes three \r\nminutes. So is Israel’s tiny airspace to be chopped in \r\nhalf and given to a Palestinian State not at peace with \r\nIsrael?  \r\n Our major international airport is a few \r\nkilometres from the West Bank. Without peace, will \r\nour planes become targets for anti-aircraft missiles \r\nplaced in the adjacent Palestinian State? And how will \r\nwe stop the smuggling into the West Bank? It is not \r\nmerely the West Bank; it is the West Bank mountains, \r\nwhich dominate the coastal plain below where most of \r\nIsrael’s population sits. How could we prevent the \r\nsmuggling into those mountains of missiles that could \r\nbe fired at our cities?  \r\n I bring up these problems because they are not \r\ntheoretical problems. They are very real, and for \r\nIsraelis, they are life-and-death matters. All of these \r\npotential cracks in Israel’s security have to be sealed in \r\na peace agreement before a Palestinian State is \r\ndeclared, not afterwards, because if it is left until \r\nafterwards they will not be sealed. And these problems \r\nwill explode in our face and explode the peace.  \r\n The Palestinians should first make peace with \r\nIsrael and then get their State. But I also want to say \r\nthis. After such a peace agreement is signed, Israel will \r\nnot be the last country to welcome a Palestinian State \r\nas a new Member of the United Nations. We will be the \r\nfirst.  \r\n There is one more thing. Hamas has been \r\nviolating international law by holding our soldier Gilad \r\nShalit captive for five years. They have not allowed \r\neven one Red Cross visit. He is held in a dungeon, in \r\ndarkness, against all international norms. Gilad Shalit \r\nis the son of Aviva and Noam Shalit. He is the \r\ngrandson of Zvi Shalit, who escaped the Holocaust by \r\ncoming to the land of Israel as a boy in the 1930s. \r\nGilad Shalit is the son of every Israeli family. Every \r\nnation represented here should demand his immediate \r\nrelease. If we want to adopt a resolution about the \r\nMiddle East today, that is the resolution we should \r\nadopt.  \r\n Last year in Israel at Bar-Ilan University, and this \r\nyear in the Knesset and the United States Congress, I \r\nlaid out my vision for peace, in which a demilitarized \r\nPalestinian State recognizes the Jewish State. Yes, the \r\nJewish State. After all, this is the body that recognized \r\nthe Jewish State 64 years ago. Now, does the Assembly \r\nnot think that it is about time that Palestinians did the \r\nsame?  \r\n The Jewish State of Israel will always protect the \r\nrights of all of its minorities, including the more than \r\n1 million Arab citizens of Israel. I wish I could say the \r\nsame thing about a future Palestinian State, for as \r\nPalestinian officials made clear the other day — in \r\nfact, I think they did so right here in New York — the \r\nPalestinian State would not allow any Jews. They \r\nwould be Jew-free — Judenrein. That is ethnic \r\ncleansing. There are laws today in Ramallah that make \r\nthe selling of land to Jews punishable by death. That is \r\nracism. And the Assembly knows which laws this \r\nevokes.  \r\n Israel has no intention whatsoever of changing \r\nthe democratic character of our State. We just do not \r\nwant the Palestinians to try to change the Jewish \r\ncharacter of our State. We want them to give up the \r\nfantasy of flooding Israel with millions of Palestinians.  \r\n President Abbas just stood here and said that the \r\nsettlements lie at the core of the Israeli-Palestinian \r\nconflicts. Well, that is odd. Our conflict was raging for \r\nnearly half a century before there was a single Israeli \r\nsettlement in the West Bank. So, if what President \r\nAbbas is saying was true, then I guess that the \r\nsettlements he is talking about are Tel Aviv, Haifa, \r\nJaffa and Be΄er Sheva. Maybe that is what he meant the \r\nother day when he said that Israel had been occupying \r\nA/66/PV.19  \r\n \r\n11-51185 40 \r\n \r\nPalestinian land for 63 years. He did not say from \r\n1967; he said from 1948.  \r\n I hope that somebody will bother to ask him this \r\nquestion, because it illustrates a simple truth. The core \r\nof the conflict is not the settlements; the settlements \r\nare a result of the conflict. The settlements are an issue \r\nthat has to be addressed and resolved in the course of \r\nnegotiations. But the core of the conflict has always \r\nbeen, and unfortunately remains, the refusal of the \r\nPalestinians to recognize a Jewish State within any \r\nborder.  \r\n I think it is time that the Palestinian leadership \r\nrecognize what every serious international leader from \r\nLord Balfour and David Lloyd George in 1917, to \r\nPresident Truman in 1948, to President Obama just two \r\ndays ago right here, has recognized — that Israel is the \r\nJewish State.  \r\n I would ask President Abbas to stop walking \r\naround this issue, recognize the Jewish State, and make \r\npeace with us. In such a genuine peace, Israel is \r\nprepared to make painful compromises. We believe that \r\nthe Palestinians should be neither the citizens of Israel \r\nnor its subjects. They should live in a free State of their \r\nown. But they should be ready, like us, for \r\ncompromise. And we will know that they are ready for \r\ncompromise and peace when they start taking Israel’s \r\nsecurity requirements seriously and when they stop \r\ndenying our historical connection to our ancient \r\nhomeland. I often hear them accuse Israel of Judaizing \r\nJerusalem. That is like accusing America of \r\nAmericanizing Washington, D.C., or the British of \r\nAnglicizing London. Why are we called Jews? Because \r\nwe come from Judea.  \r\n In my office in Jerusalem, there is an ancient \r\nseal. It is a signet ring of a Jewish official from the \r\ntime of the Bible. The seal was found right next to the \r\nWestern Wall and it dates back 2,700 years to the time \r\nof King Hezekiah. Now, the name of a Jewish official \r\nis inscribed on the ring in Hebrew. His name was \r\nNetanyahu. That is my last name. My first name, \r\nBenjamin, can be traced back a 1,000 years to \r\nBenjamin — Binyamin — the son of Jacob, who was \r\nalso known as Israel. Jacob and his 12 sons roamed \r\nthese same hills of Judea and Samaria 4,000 years ago, \r\nand there has been a continuous Jewish presence in the \r\nland ever since.  \r\n Those Jews who were exiled from our land — \r\nJews in Spain, on the eve of their expulsion; Jews in \r\nUkraine, fleeing the pogroms; Jews fighting in the \r\nWarsaw Ghetto, as the Nazis were circling around it — \r\nnever stopped dreaming of coming back. They never \r\nstopped praying, they never stopped yearning. They \r\nwhispered: “Next year in Jerusalem. Next year in the \r\npromised land”.  \r\n As the Prime Minister of Israel, I speak for a \r\nhundred generations of Jews who were dispersed \r\nthroughout the lands and suffered every evil under the \r\nsun, but who never gave up hope of restoring their \r\nnational life in the one and only Jewish State.  \r\n I continue to hope that President Abbas will be \r\nmy partner in peace. I have worked hard to advance \r\nthat peace. The day I came into office, I called for \r\ndirect negotiations without preconditions. President \r\nAbbas did not respond. I outlined a vision of peace of \r\ntwo States for two peoples. He still did not respond. I \r\nremoved hundreds of roadblocks and checkpoints to \r\nease freedom of movement in the Palestinian areas. \r\nThis facilitated fantastic growth in the Palestinian \r\neconomy. But again, there was no response. I took the \r\nunprecedented step of freezing new building in the \r\nsettlements for 10 months. No Prime Minister had done \r\nthat before, ever. Once again, I hear applause, but there \r\nwas no response. No response.  \r\n In the past few weeks, American officials have \r\nput forward ideas to restart peace talks. There were \r\nthings in those ideas about borders that I did not like. \r\nThere were things there about the Jewish State that I \r\nam sure the Palestinians did not like. But despite all of \r\nmy reservations, I was willing to move forward on \r\nthose American ideas. Why does President Abbas not \r\njoin me? We have to stop negotiating about the \r\nnegotiations. Let us just get on with it. Let us negotiate \r\npeace.  \r\n I spent years defending Israel on the battlefield. I \r\nspent decades defending Israel in the court of public \r\nopinion. President Abbas has dedicated his life to \r\nadvancing the Palestinian cause. Must this conflict \r\ncontinue for generations, or will we enable our children \r\nand our grandchildren to speak in the years ahead of \r\nhow we found a way to end it? That is what we should \r\naim for, and that is what I believe we can achieve.  \r\n In two and a half years, President Abbas and I \r\nhave met in Jerusalem only once, even though my door \r\nhas always been open to him. If he wishes, I will come \r\nto Ramallah. Actually, I have a better suggestion. We \r\nhave both just flown thousands of miles to New York. \r\n A/66/PV.19\r\n \r\n41 11-51185 \r\n \r\nNow we are in the same city; we are in the same \r\nbuilding. So let us meet here today, at the United \r\nNations. Who is there to stop us? What is there to stop \r\nus? If we genuinely want peace, what is there to stop \r\nus from meeting today and beginning peace \r\nnegotiations? \r\n I suggest that we talk openly and honestly. Let us \r\nlisten to one another. Let us, as we say in the Middle \r\nEast, talk dugri. That means “straightforward”. I will \r\ntell him my needs and concerns; he will tell me his. \r\nAnd with God’s help, we will find the common ground \r\nof peace.  \r\n There is an old Arab saying that one cannot \r\napplaud with one hand. Well, the same is true of peace. \r\nI cannot make peace alone. I cannot make peace \r\nwithout an interlocutor. President Abbas, I extend my \r\nhand — the hand of Israel — in peace. I hope that he \r\nwill grasp that hand. We are both the sons of Abraham. \r\nMy people call him Avraham; his people call him \r\nIbrahim. We share the same patriarch. We dwell in the \r\nsame land. Our destinies are intertwined. Let us realize \r\nthe vision of Isaiah: “The people who walk in darkness \r\nwill see a great light”. (The Holy Bible, Isaiah 9:2). Let \r\nthat light be the light of peace. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nState of Israel for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime Minster of the \r\nState of Israel, was escorted from the rostrum.  \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Fredrik Reinfeldt, Prime \r\nMinister of the Kingdom of Sweden \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Kingdom \r\nof Sweden. \r\n Mr. Fredrik Reinfeldt, Prime Minister of the \r\nKingdom of Sweden, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Fredrik Reinfeldt, \r\nPrime Minister of the Kingdom of Sweden, and \r\ninviting him to address the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Reinfeldt (Sweden): More than 10 years ago, \r\nwe decided to set eight concrete goals to free \r\nhumankind from extreme poverty, from hunger and \r\ndisease, and from illiteracy. We called them the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. These Goals have \r\nbeen powerful. They have helped the international \r\ncommunity to monitor and mobilize resources for \r\ndevelopment cooperation. \r\n And important progress has been made. We have \r\nseen poverty decline in many countries. By 2015, the \r\nglobal poverty rate is expected to fall below 15 per \r\ncent. We have seen some of the poorest countries make \r\nthe greatest strides in education. Child mortality has \r\nbeen reduced. New HIV infections are declining \r\nsteadily. Access to clean drinking water has increased. \r\nBut we still have a long way to go in other areas in \r\norder to raise standards of living and offer equal \r\nopportunities to people around the globe. \r\n Today I would like to focus on one key area \r\nwhere progress is still very slow. But since it affects \r\nhalf of the world’s population and half its human \r\nresources, it is of crucial importance. I am referring to \r\nmaybe the most important human rights failure of all, \r\nor at least the one that affects the largest number of \r\nhuman beings. I am referring to the unmet human, \r\neconomic and social rights of 3.5 billion women and \r\ngirls. They make up half of the world, but they are not \r\nallowed to fulfil their potential as powerful drivers of \r\neconomic development as well as of peace and \r\nsecurity. \r\n Let me just fill members in on the situation we \r\nhave today. Women perform 66 per cent of the world’s \r\nwork and produce 50 per cent of its food, but they earn \r\nonly 10 per cent of its income and own one per cent of \r\nits property. Seventy per cent of the world’s poor \r\npopulation are women or girls. Every day, \r\napproximately 1,000 women die from causes related to \r\npregnancy and childbirth. That adds up to about \r\n350,000 deaths each year. \r\n This week we witnessed a historic step in the \r\nhistory of the United Nations, when Brazilian President \r\nDilma Rousseff became the first woman ever to open \r\nthe general debate. At the same time — standing here, \r\nmid-2011 — there are still countries that do not allow \r\nwomen to vote. And only in 28 countries has women’s \r\nparliamentary representation reached a critical mass of \r\n30 per cent or more. Only 19 women lead their \r\ncountries as elected Heads of State or Government. \r\nThis is not fair. It is not just. And, frankly, it makes no \r\nsense. \r\n To me, gender equality is first and foremost a \r\nquestion of ensuring equal rights for women and men. \r\nIt is about giving all individuals, irrespective of gender, \r\nA/66/PV.19  \r\n \r\n11-51185 42 \r\n \r\nthe same possibilities of education, economic \r\nopportunity and participating in society. In 2011, there \r\nare women who still do not enjoy equal rights. They \r\nare refused the rights to vote, to inherit, to work and \r\neven to drive a car. And at the far end of the spectrum, \r\nwomen are subject to gender-based violence and rape \r\nas a weapon of war.  \r\n But gaps in these rights are not only a loss for the \r\nwomen affected; they are a loss to society as a whole \r\nand, I must say, very bad economic policy for the \r\ncountries concerned. Not least in these times of global \r\neconomic crisis, it seems obvious that we should \r\nrealize the full potential of all human resources. \r\n I will give a few examples. Closing the gap \r\nbetween male and female employment rates would \r\nhave huge implications for the global economy. It \r\nwould boost the United States gross domestic product \r\n(GDP) by as much as 9 per cent, the eurozone GDP by \r\n13 per cent and Japanese GDP by as much as 16 per \r\ncent. But increased gender equality does not merely \r\nhave immediate economic benefits; it is also an \r\ninvestment for the future. The evidence from a range of \r\ncountries is clear. When women take greater control of \r\nhousehold income, more money is spent on children’s \r\nneeds, such as food, health and education. Children \r\ngrow taller, are ill less often and are likely to get better \r\njobs. Moreover, when women play a greater part in \r\nsociety by shaping institutions or taking leading roles \r\nin politics or business life, there are clear \r\nimprovements for the public good, and corruption is \r\nlessened. When they are present at the building of \r\npeace, results improve. \r\n In short, I see gender equality not only as a \r\ncrucial human rights issue, but also as a question of \r\nsmart economics. I would urge all representatives \r\nsitting in this Hall today to imagine what it would \r\nmean in terms of economic growth for their countries if \r\nwomen were allowed to participate fully in society. \r\n As technology develops, the world is changing. \r\nIn one minute I can use my mobile phone to get hold of \r\na friend on the other side of the globe or my children \r\nback home in Sweden. That is, of course, amazing. But \r\nin one minute, we can also get a first-hand report on \r\nthe situation in troubled parts of the world. We can get \r\nfirst-hand access to pictures of abuse and violence, \r\ntaken by hidden mobile phones and for the whole \r\nworld to see. Today, ideas of freedom and democracy \r\nare spreading at the speed of sound. We have seen it in \r\nNorth Africa. We are seeing it in the Middle East. The \r\nInternet and new technology have laid out a high-speed \r\nmotorway heading towards democracy and freedom. \r\nWe can see that some are trying to put out roadblocks; \r\nrepressive Governments try to quash the rights they \r\nfear. \r\n The United Nations must play a leading role in \r\nembracing and maintaining those new roads to \r\ndemocracy and freedom. The United Nations Special \r\nRapporteur on the promotion and protection of the \r\nright to freedom of opinion and expression recently \r\nconcluded that there must be as little restriction as \r\npossible of online freedom of expression. He called it \r\nan enabler of other human rights. Sweden, together \r\nwith 40 other nations around the world, strongly \r\nsupports his conclusion. We want to build an alliance \r\nfor the freedom of the Internet, and we have launched a \r\nspecial initiative for democratization and freedom of \r\nexpression so that we can urgently support human \r\nrights activists and agents of democratic change. The \r\nInternet is the new front line in the fight for freedom \r\nacross the world. \r\n In many countries, my own included, we take \r\nfreedom for granted. In other countries, it is still a \r\ndream. This year, we have witnessed courageous \r\npeople in North Africa and the Middle East taking to \r\nthe streets to fight for their dream; to fight for freedom, \r\nopenness and democracy. For this, they must have our \r\nsupport. When there are threats of genocide, war \r\ncrimes, ethnic cleansing or crimes against humanity — \r\nwhen autocratic rulers, as in Syria, turn their guns on \r\ntheir own citizens — then the international community \r\nhas a responsibility to protect civilians. \r\n Sweden hopes to play its part in this decisive \r\nphase in the region. We are contributing to the \r\nimplementation of Security Council resolutions 1970 \r\n(2011) and 1973 (2011) in Libya. We are providing \r\nsubstantial humanitarian support to several countries in \r\nNorth Africa and the Middle East. And when the new \r\nGovernments turn to the crucial task of establishing \r\ndemocratic principles, the rule of law and respect for \r\nhuman rights, we will be ready to continue our support \r\nand do more to see the Arab Spring turn into a \r\nblossoming summer. \r\n The European Union is firmly committed to \r\nIsrael and a Palestinian State living side by side with \r\neach other in peace and security. We all want to see the \r\npeace process resume. Violations of international law \r\n A/66/PV.19\r\n \r\n43 11-51185 \r\n \r\nmust cease. Only then can a true and lasting peace be \r\nachieved. \r\n The Horn of Africa is suffering its worst famine \r\nin 60 years. We are faced with a huge humanitarian \r\ndisaster. The international community must respond \r\nfaster and better, now. Disasters such as those in Haiti, \r\nPakistan and now in the Horn of Africa show the \r\ncentral importance of the United Nations in \r\nhumanitarian action. The United Nations needs our full \r\nsupport to further improve the international response \r\ncapacity. \r\n In a globalized world, we are not just \r\ninterconnected online; together we share a planet with \r\nfinite resources. And yet we consume as if there was no \r\ntomorrow. I believe that sustainable development \r\nrequires global solutions. In this respect, the United \r\nNations Conference on Sustainable Development to be \r\nheld next year in Brazil will be very important. I am \r\nreally hoping for a strong renewed political commitment to \r\nsustainable development. \r\n We are also looking for concrete progress at the \r\nDurban Climate Change Conference in November. We \r\nknow what we need and we have known it for some \r\ntime — further reductions of greenhouse gas \r\nemissions. If we do not achieve that, we are simply not \r\ngoing to be able to reverse the trend of global warming. \r\n These are turbulent times. Some countries are \r\nsuffering from financial and economic crises; others \r\nare suffering from the severe consequences of global \r\nwarming; yet others are building new societies as \r\nfreedom and democracy have replaced dictatorships \r\nand repression. More than ever, there is a need for a \r\nwell-functioning global arena for international \r\ncooperation and conflict resolution and for the pursuit \r\nof sustainable economic, social and environmental \r\ndevelopment. The need for a strong United Nations,  \r\n \r\nbased on political legitimacy, justice and human rights, \r\nis as strong as ever. Sweden will do its utmost to \r\nsupport a strong United Nations through substantial \r\ncontributions to humanitarian and development \r\nassistance and to its work for peace, security and \r\nhuman rights. \r\n We also want to help revitalize the work of the \r\nUnited Nations on disarmament and non-proliferation. \r\nTogether with Mexico we will, as co-Chairs of the \r\nseventh Conference Facilitating the Entry into Force of \r\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, work \r\nhard on advancing the Treaty’s entry into force.  \r\n We have also presented our candidature for a seat \r\non the Human Rights Council for the period \r\n2013-2015. As a member of the Council, Sweden \r\nwould contribute actively to making it a more efficient \r\nand active body and to promoting the universal \r\nenjoyment of human rights — making rights real. \r\n This week we commemorate the fiftieth \r\nanniversary of the death of the Swedish Secretary-\r\nGeneral Dag Hammarskjöld. He played an important \r\nrole in reforming and shaping the United Nations as we \r\nknow it today. Let me conclude with these words from \r\nDag Hammarskjöld:  \r\n “The pursuit of peace and progress, with its trials \r\nand its errors, its successes and its setbacks, can \r\nnever be relaxed and never abandoned”.  \r\nThat was true then and it is true today.  \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nKingdom of Sweden for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\n Mr. Fredrik Reinfeldt, Prime Minister of the \r\nKingdom of Sweden, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\n  The meeting rose at 2.25 p.m. \r\n"
