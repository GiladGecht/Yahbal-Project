(Qatar) \r\n \r\n \r\n  In the absence of the President, Mr. Cazeau \r\n(Haiti), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 3.15 p.m.  \r\n \r\n \r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Pál Schmitt, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Hungary \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Hungary. \r\n Mr. Pál Schmitt, President of the Republic of \r\nHungary, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Pál \r\nSchmitt, President of the Republic of Hungary, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Schmitt: Let me at the outset welcome \r\nSouth Sudan as the 193rd Member of the United \r\nNations. I commend the successful conduct of the \r\nreferendum on independence as a manifestation of the \r\nprinciple of self-determination. That historic act has \r\nput an end to a long civil war on the African continent \r\nand opened up new horizons for the stability and \r\nprosperity of the people of South Sudan. \r\n Hungary fully aligns itself with the statement \r\nmade earlier by President Van Rompuy on behalf of the \r\nEuropean Union. To complement this, allow me to \r\noutline my country’s position on three issues figuring \r\nhigh on our foreign policy and development agenda, \r\nnamely, the Arab Spring, sustainable development and \r\nthe prevention and control of non-communicable \r\ndiseases. \r\n More than 20 years ago, Central and Eastern \r\nEurope, including my country, Hungary, was the scene \r\nof sweeping political changes. Beginning in early 2011, \r\nthe world has witnessed, yet again, the outburst of \r\npopular will for profound transformation, this time in \r\nNorth Africa and the Middle East. Those of us who \r\ntook active part in the democratization process and the \r\ntransition to the rule of law and market economies in \r\nour region have been following the events of the Arab \r\nSpring with great empathy and understanding.  \r\n The revolutions leading to sweeping shifts in \r\nTunisia, Egypt and other countries were equally driven \r\nby sincere desires for a better life and for putting in \r\nplace new political systems capable of better \r\nresponding to the aspirations of all parts of society. The \r\nvoices of Tahrir Square echoed the aspirations of \r\nmillions of people. \r\n The overthrow of autocratic regimes is, \r\nnevertheless, only the first step in that direction. As \r\nshown by our own experience, the most difficult stages \r\nof the transformation process are yet to come. The \r\nvictorious popular uprisings of the Arab Spring have \r\nencountered tremendous challenges in terms of \r\nestablishing new power structures, drafting new \r\nconstitutions and other basic laws, as well as \r\nconducting free and democratic elections, just to \r\nmention a few. Essentially those measures require an \r\nA/66/PV.20  \r\n \r\n11-51191 2 \r\n \r\ninternally driven process, carried out with the support \r\nof the international community. \r\n Hungarian society has, on the one hand, already \r\nsuccessfully met many of those challenges and, on the \r\nother hand, made some avoidable mistakes. We \r\ntherefore feel equipped to share our experiences and to \r\noffer a substantive toolkit for good governance and \r\ndemocratic change. As a good friend and supporting \r\npartner, Hungary truly hopes that those undergoing \r\ntransitional periods today will be able to benefit from \r\nboth our achievements and our omissions. \r\n Far be it from us, of course, to try to give advice \r\nor provide ready-made solutions. While we advocate \r\nthe universal character of human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms, as well as the virtues of the rule \r\nof law and good governance, we believe that those \r\nideals can be implemented only in conjunction with \r\nrespect for the cultural, religious and other traditions of \r\neach nation. \r\n At this stage of what we see as a long transformation \r\nprocess in the Arab world, we thus offer to share our own \r\nexperiences and lessons learned. The Hungarian \r\nGovernment, in cooperation with non-governmental \r\norganizations, has already carried out, and plans to \r\ncarry out in future, concrete projects and programmes \r\naimed at, inter alia, assisting the new emerging \r\ndemocracies in North Africa and the Middle East in the \r\nfield of institution-building, security-sector reform, and \r\ndrawing up the legislative framework for political and \r\neconomic renewal. We welcome the central role and \r\nincreasing involvement of the United Nations and its \r\nvarious agencies in support of the democratization of \r\nthose countries. Hungary stands ready to contribute to \r\nsuch efforts and provide its specialized expertise. \r\n Over the past two decades, since the Earth \r\nSummit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, the three pillars of \r\nsustainable development have been the focus of the \r\ninternational development agenda. Time has shown that \r\nonly a coherent approach to the environmental, \r\neconomic and social aspects of this concept can ensure \r\nthe long-term survival and prosperity of mankind. We \r\nshould not miss this chance to formulate new courses \r\nof action in this era of reinforced mutual \r\ninterdependence and globalization. \r\n Against the background of the constantly \r\ndeteriorating global environment, it is an increasingly \r\ndemanding task to strike the necessary balance \r\nbetween ensuring growth in all regions of the world, a \r\ndecent life for our societies and the preservation of \r\nnatural resources in the interests of the survival of our \r\nplanet. One of the responses to this dilemma is the \r\nconcept of a green economy, which is gaining ever-\r\ngreater support. We consider the United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development as a unique \r\nevent aimed at generating the widest possible support \r\nfor and acceptance of this green concept. Its goal is to \r\nsupport the sustainability of socio-economic \r\ndevelopment at the national, regional and global levels.  \r\n In addition, the concept of a green economy has \r\nthe potential to also contribute to job creation and the \r\neradication of poverty. If implemented in a coherent \r\nmanner, it will create new resources for achieving the \r\ninternationally agreed development goals. There is no \r\ndoubt that achieving these goals will require innovative \r\nthinking in terms of technology transfer, investment \r\nand fair trade. \r\n In order to put this concept into practice, a \r\nreorganization of the environmental architecture of the \r\nUnited Nations is needed. Such reform should pursue \r\nthe goal of streamlining and unifying the existing \r\nstructures, with a view to increasing the coherence and \r\nefficiency of the system as a whole. \r\n It is our shared responsibility to develop joint \r\nstrategies to mitigate the effects of non-communicable \r\ndiseases. Their rapid growth is preventable and can be \r\ncontrolled to a significant extent. Hungary has been in \r\nthe forefront of this fight, with national cancer and \r\ndiabetes control systems in place that may contribute to \r\npaving the way for functional alternatives around the \r\nworld. It is also our fundamental belief that the \r\ndevelopment of comprehensive national and regional \r\nstrategies for control programmes can significantly \r\nlower the incidence of these illnesses. This can \r\ncontribute to prevention, early detection and adequate \r\ntreatment in a cost-effective way. We are also proud of \r\nHungary’s long-standing tradition of sharing \r\nknowledge and providing educational and training \r\nprogrammes for students and experts from all over the \r\nworld. In the past decades, hundreds of students from \r\noutside Hungary have obtained their medical degrees \r\nin our country. We are cooperating with various \r\ncountries, sharing knowledge and experiences in order \r\nto contribute to the collective efforts that need to be \r\nmade to bring about better health worldwide. \r\n The High-level Meeting gave momentum to this \r\nfight, which needs to be fought not only on an \r\n A/66/PV.20\r\n \r\n3 11-51191 \r\n \r\nindividual level by the victims of these diseases, but \r\nalso by our countries and by the international \r\ncommunity working together. We need to capitalize on \r\nthis in order to reach the ultimate goal of saving lives \r\naround the world and thereby move further towards \r\none of the founding objectives of the United Nations: \r\nhuman development. \r\n As members may know, Hungary has put forward \r\nits candidacy for Security Council membership in \r\n2012-2013. We continue to uphold the principles and \r\nobjectives enshrined in the Charter of the United \r\nNations and international law, such as the equality of \r\nnations, the peaceful settlement of disputes and respect \r\nfor human rights. Hungary also stands ready to \r\ncontribute in a meaningful way to all efforts aimed at \r\nenhancing the capabilities of the United Nations in the \r\nfield of conflict prevention and mediation. We believe \r\nin an integrated approach to conflict resolution and will \r\nadvocate a stronger integration of security and \r\ndevelopment concerns, as well as enhanced interaction \r\nbetween the Council and other main organs of the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n Let me conclude by assuring the Assembly once \r\nagain that Hungary will continue to contribute its \r\nutmost to strengthening the global cooperation of \r\ncountries within the United Nations system, which is \r\nso strongly needed to tackle today’s challenges. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Hungary for the statement \r\nhe has just made. \r\n Mr. Pál Schmitt, President of the Republic of \r\nHungary, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.  \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Ernest Bai Koroma, President of the \r\nRepublic of Sierra Leone \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Sierra Leone. \r\n Mr. Ernest Bai Koroma, President of the Republic \r\nof Sierra Leone, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Ernest Bai Koroma, President of the Republic of \r\nSierra Leone, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly.  \r\n President Koroma: I am honoured to address the \r\nAssembly once again. Let me, first of all, congratulate \r\nthe President on his election to his duties of directing \r\nthe affairs of the Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. I \r\nwould like to assure him of our full support and \r\ncooperation throughout his tenure. And I commend his \r\npredecessor, Mr. Joseph Deiss, for a job well done. We \r\nappreciate the Secretary-General’s important \r\ncontribution to the work of the Organization and \r\ncongratulate him on his recent appointment to a second \r\nterm. \r\n On behalf of the Government and people of \r\nSierra Leone, let me take this opportunity to welcome \r\nthe Republic of South Sudan, the newest Member of \r\nthe United Nations family and our continental \r\norganization, the African Union. We congratulate them \r\non this achievement and wish them well. \r\n Sierra Leone is a nation with a relatively small \r\nterritory and population, but our aspirations to \r\ndemocracy, prosperity and international peace are as \r\nbig as any nation’s, and our commitment to those \r\nideals has been visibly demonstrated in the course of \r\nour 50 years as an independent nation. We are proud of \r\nthe distinctive contributions we have made to the \r\nUnited Nations over the past half-century in areas such \r\nas decolonization; training and research; the \r\ninternational civil service; disarmament and \r\nnon-proliferation, including small arms and light \r\nweapons; peacemaking and peacekeeping; the \r\ndevelopment of international law; and, currently, \r\nreform of the Security Council. \r\n It is worth mentioning that, soon after our \r\nadmission to the United Nations, we contributed a \r\nsmall peacekeeping contingent to the United Nations \r\nOperation in the Congo. Our commitment to \r\ninternational peace is evidenced by our transformation \r\nfrom a nation that received one of the largest ever \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping missions in the late \r\n1990s to a country that today contributes troops and \r\npolice officers to peacekeeping missions in Darfur. We \r\nhave also developed a proposal to participate in the \r\nAfrican Union Mission in Somalia. At the same time, \r\nwe acknowledge with gratitude the enormous impact \r\nthat the United Nations family has had on the \r\nmaintenance of peace, governance and economic and \r\nA/66/PV.20  \r\n \r\n11-51191 4 \r\n \r\nsocial development in my country since our admission \r\nto the Organization, 50 years ago. \r\n In my capacity as Chair of the African Union \r\nCommittee of Ten Heads of State and Government on \r\nthe Reform of the United Nations Security Council, I \r\nmust emphasize that reform of the Council is urgently \r\nrequired for the wider United Nations membership to \r\nfully benefit from the Council’s purposes and primary \r\nobjective of maintaining international peace and \r\nsecurity. There is an increasing need for the Security \r\nCouncil to be more representative, inclusive and \r\ndemocratic, as well as for an improvement in its \r\nworking methods and its relations with the General \r\nAssembly. The status quo is increasingly unacceptable \r\nand has the potential to undermine the legitimacy, \r\neffectiveness and efficiency of the Council’s work in \r\nmaintaining international peace and security. \r\n It is therefore imperative that we reaffirm our \r\ncommitment to the standards and principles of this \r\nnoble Organization by generating the political will for \r\na reformed Security Council that would pave the way \r\nfor correcting the historical injustice done to Africa, \r\nthrough the allocation during this session of two \r\npermanent and five non-permanent seats to Africa, in \r\naccordance with the United Nations Charter. \r\n Since I addressed the Assembly last year, Sierra \r\nLeone has continued to make steady progress, \r\nparticularly in the priority sectors outlined in my \r\nGovernment’s agenda for change, namely, agriculture, \r\nenergy, infrastructure, health and education. Those five \r\nsectors were purposely selected from many others \r\nrequiring transformation because we believe they can \r\nhave the greatest positive impact on the lives of our \r\npeople. We have done so against the background of the \r\nunprecedented challenges facing our world today, such \r\nas the rise in fuel and food prices, the global financial \r\ncrisis, and the chain of unending conflicts around the \r\nworld. \r\n Inspired by the conviction that no goals, however \r\ncomprehensive or meaningful, can be achieved without \r\nthe sustained determination to implement them, I have \r\ndeclared 2011 the year of implementation for Sierra \r\nLeone. Accordingly, my Government has demonstrated \r\nits commitment to that declaration. We are going to \r\nensure that every single Sierra Leonean benefits from \r\nthe dividends of our well-earned peace and democracy. \r\nIn spite of the many challenges that have impeded our \r\ncapacity to complete our projects, we are determined, \r\nwith the cooperation and support of our development \r\npartners, to accelerate our country’s positive \r\ntransformation. It is my sincere hope that successful \r\nimplementation of the projects and programmes in the \r\nJoint Vision of the United Nations Family for Sierra \r\nLeone, which has been aligned with our agenda for \r\nchange, will enhance Sierra Leone’s efforts to attain \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. \r\n The economy of Sierra Leone, like many around \r\nthe world, is currently encountering budgetary \r\ndifficulties that can be traced to the global economic \r\nmeltdown. We are, however, optimistic about future \r\ngrowth levels. We expect export levels to increase, \r\ngiven our substantial investment in developing our \r\ninfrastructure and ongoing revamping of our mining, \r\nagriculture and tourism sectors. We have also put in \r\nplace strong corrective measures to stabilize the fiscal \r\nsituation. \r\n We have continued to build on progress achieved \r\nin the area of peace consolidation. Our democratic \r\ninstitutions, such as the National Electoral \r\nCommission, the Political Parties Registration \r\nCommission and the Anti-Corruption Commission, \r\nhave continued to make progress in carrying out their \r\nrespective mandates. We have also continued to build \r\non gains achieved in the areas of human rights, gender \r\nequality and women’s empowerment. \r\n The establishment of a Human Rights \r\nCommission of Sierra Leone and the presentation of \r\nour national report to the Universal Periodic Review \r\nWorking Group of the United Nations Human Rights \r\nCouncil in May this year are clear manifestations of \r\nour commitment to build a human rights regime that \r\nrespects international norms and practices. In June this \r\nyear, the International Coordinating Committee of \r\nNational Human Rights Institutions awarded an “A” \r\nstatus accreditation to the Human Rights Commission \r\nof Siena Leone in recognition of its achievements and \r\nindependence. \r\n I have pledged my support and initiated processes \r\nthat will make women constitute at least 30 per cent of \r\nelective offices in our country. As a State party to many \r\ninternational human rights instruments we are \r\ncommitted to their implementation and respect our \r\nreporting obligations under the relevant conventions. \r\nWe have, for instance, just completed our sixth \r\nperiodic report to the Committee on the Elimination of \r\nDiscrimination against Women. We have ratified the \r\n A/66/PV.20\r\n \r\n5 11-51191 \r\n \r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons \r\nwith Disabilities and have commissioned a National \r\nAction Plan for the implementation of Security Council \r\nresolutions 1325 (2000) and 1820 (2008). \r\n As we prepare for our 2012 presidential, \r\nparliamentary and local council elections, we are \r\ncognizant of the fact that it is our primary \r\nresponsibility to organize and provide the necessary \r\nlogistical requirements for this democratic process. \r\nHowever, we need all necessary international \r\nassistance in support of our commitment to ensure free, \r\nfair and peaceful elections. In that regard, we have \r\ncontinued to dialogue with all stakeholders including \r\nthe National Electoral Commission, the Political \r\nParties Registration Commission and political parties. \r\nWe remain committed to peace, security and \r\ndevelopment, but the need to continue with national \r\ncapacity-building programmes in priority peacebuilding \r\nthematic areas beyond the 2012 elections remains \r\ncritical. \r\n Recently, peace and stability were not only \r\nthreatened but painfully disturbed by pockets of armed \r\nconflict in the subregion of the Economic Community \r\nof West African States, particularly in the Mano River \r\nUnion basin. However, we are encouraged by the \r\nunfolding developments and prospects of relative peace \r\nin our sister republics. At the same time, we are \r\nconcerned about the continued threats posed to peace \r\nand stability by the illicit flow of small arms and light \r\nweapons across our subregion. International \r\ncooperation and assistance are necessary in order to \r\neradicate this menace. Sierra Leone, for its part, \r\nrecently launched a five-year action plan to expand the \r\nscope of its activities concerning small arms and light \r\nweapons. \r\n Considering the prevailing incidence of violence \r\nand armed conflict in various regions of the world, the \r\nchoice of the theme, “The role of mediation in the \r\nsettlement of disputes”, for this year’s general debate is \r\nrelevant and appropriate. \r\n Of course, we are quite conscious of the \r\ninevitability of disputes in the conduct of inter-State as \r\nwell as intra-State relations. But it is imperative to \r\nrespect the set of principles enshrined in Article 2 of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations in our interactions \r\nwith each other. They include the sovereign equality of \r\nall United Nations Members, the peaceful settlement of \r\ndisputes and the prohibition of the threat or use of \r\nforce. \r\n Obviously, mediation remains the best \r\nmechanism for the prevention and settlement of armed \r\nconflicts. It should be utilized to the fullest extent \r\npossible. Sierra Leone firmly believes that the United \r\nNations should make better use of Chapter VI of the \r\nCharter, namely, measures for the peaceful settlement \r\nof disputes. \r\n We must also allow our discussion of the \r\nmediation of disputes through peaceful means to move \r\ntowards the resolution of threats to the international \r\neconomic and financial systems. The greatest threat \r\ntoday to the security of most individuals in most \r\nsocieties stems from the non-resolution of issues \r\nrelating to excessive speculation in the most important \r\nfood crops of the world, the rising food and fuel prices \r\nand the fact that the burden of sacrifice for our \r\nrecovery is increasingly placed on the shoulders of the \r\nweak and the poor.  \r\n In most places in the world we are seeing the \r\nrallying of the strong and powerful to protect their \r\nindulgence and the rallying of young people, the weak \r\nand the dispossessed to secure their very lives, their \r\ndignity and humanity. The alternatives to the non-resolution \r\nof those disputes are dire. We must act now to save the \r\nworld from the anger of the weak and the excessive \r\nindulgence and repression perpetrated by the strong. \r\n I would like to emphasize that international \r\ncooperation in the peaceful settlement of disputes is the \r\nlife blood of our Organization. In all our deliberations, \r\nfrom global warming to human trafficking, from the \r\nthreats of nuclear weapons to the scourge of abject \r\npoverty, from communicable and non-communicable \r\ndiseases to ruthless natural disasters, and from the flow \r\nof illicit drugs to the seemingly unending upheavals in \r\nthe financial markets, we should always remember that \r\nwe need each other. The world is too connected for the \r\nconsequences of failure to be localized.  \r\n The effects of poverty, disease, hunger and \r\ndesperation can no longer be boxed in and contained in \r\na corner of a city, or a country, region or continent. We \r\nare on each other’s doorsteps, and we must continue to \r\nbuild the structures for the peaceful resolution of our \r\nconflicts. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nA/66/PV.20  \r\n \r\n11-51191 6 \r\n \r\nPresident of the Republic of Sierra Leone for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Ernest Bai Koroma, President of the Republic \r\nof Sierra Leone, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Boris Tadić, President of the \r\nRepublic of Serbia  \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Serbia. \r\n Mr. Boris Tadić, President of the Republic of \r\nSerbia, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Boris Tadić, President of the Republic of Serbia, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Tadić: The rapid changes in our \r\npolitical and economic environment show, once again, \r\nthe necessity of this annual gathering of the General \r\nAssembly of the United Nations. We have a difficult \r\ntask ahead of us. I wish the President of the General \r\nAssembly every success. He can rest assured that he \r\nhas our fullest support. I also wish to congratulate \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon on his reappointment. \r\nHis steady hand has helped to steer the United Nations \r\nthrough challenging times. To him, too, we offer all our \r\nsupport. \r\n It has been a year of momentous change. An \r\neconomic crisis pervades most liberal economies. A \r\nwave of political change is sweeping through much of \r\nthe Middle East. Climatic turbulence leaves loss and \r\ntragedy in its wake. Famine stalks the Horn of Africa. \r\nNew choices confront political leaders. New priorities \r\nare presented to citizens. The worst that we could do \r\nnow is to allow fear and indecision to govern us. \r\n These are also times that call for a deep \r\ncommitment to international cooperation and \r\nmultilateralism. Every crisis that we address reaches \r\nbeyond our national frontiers. There is no way that we \r\ncan resolve such matters without the framework of the \r\ninternational laws and rules to which we are all bound. \r\n The financial crisis has had a profound and \r\nnegative effect on all our aspirations. While each \r\ncountry must adjust its expectations, we cannot allow \r\nourselves to be guided only by our national concerns. \r\nIn fact, they are best supported by greater commitment \r\nto a deeper solidarity among nations and far more \r\nintense cooperation. The great economic and political \r\nunions have achieved success by balancing sacrifice \r\nwith gain for all. The same challenge now confronts \r\nthe European Union (EU). \r\n In North Africa and the Middle East, we have \r\nseen a wave of protest that has convulsed the region. \r\nThe Republic of Serbia and the Serbian people have \r\nhad a long relationship with all the peoples of that \r\nregion. We stand by them. We know what is involved \r\nin such changes. \r\n In a time of such uncertainty, crises call for \r\nUnited Nations-sanctioned involvement to save lives \r\nand to keep the peace. There will be more such \r\nmissions. I am very pleased that the Republic of Serbia \r\nis now actively engaged in several such missions, and \r\nwe will continue our commitment. In that spirit, the \r\nRepublic of Serbia is a signatory to the evolving \r\nclimate change commitments and conventions. We also \r\nenthusiastically support the United Nations Global \r\nCounter-Terrorism Strategy. \r\n In times as complex as these, our objective must \r\nbe to manage real crises well and to avoid creating \r\nunnecessary ones. There are problems that can be \r\nresolved through patient discussion and the building of \r\ntrust. Unilateral action in such circumstances simply \r\ncreates crisis for no good reason. \r\n That is why, in our regional issues of South \r\nEastern Europe, we always promote the principles and \r\nthe presence of the United Nations. As a founding \r\nmember of the Non-Aligned Movement, we were able \r\nto celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of its founding in \r\nBelgrade. Such networks create layers of \r\ncommunication and trust at a time of globalization. \r\n Our bid to join the European Union is the \r\nplatform on which we intend to build and contribute to \r\nour shared objectives. Regional cooperation is a \r\ncornerstone of our diplomacy, and we believe that it is \r\nonly to the benefit of the entire region. That is reflected \r\nin our chairmanships of the Central European Initiative \r\nand the Adriatic-Ionian Initiative. Most important, it is \r\nalso reflected in Serbia’s chairmanship of the South-\r\nEast European Cooperation Process, our region’s most \r\nimportant initiative. Next year, my country will follow \r\n A/66/PV.20\r\n \r\n7 11-51191 \r\n \r\nthat up by taking over responsibilities to lead the Black \r\nSea Economic Cooperation Organization. \r\n Serbia has established an entirely new level of \r\nconfidence in relations with Croatia. That has been of \r\nstrategic significance in securing stability in Bosnia \r\nand Herzegovina. We welcome Croatia’s imminent \r\naccession to the European Union. \r\n All of that has set the stage for Serbia to actively \r\nconsider seeking the chairmanship-in-office of the \r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe \r\n(OSCE) for the year 2014 ─ the centenary of the start \r\nof the First World War. The unifying symbolism of \r\n2014 would not only help catalyse efforts to resolve the \r\nunfinished business on the old continent’s shared \r\nagenda. It would also help to close the book on an era \r\nthat did not witness the enduring stability that the \r\nnations of the OSCE space deserve. \r\n We have devoted extraordinary levels of \r\nresources to capture war criminals. Finally, the \r\nRepublic of Serbia has completed its obligations to \r\nitself and to the international community. We believe \r\nthat, after the tragedies of the 1990s, that exercise is a \r\nvery necessary catharsis for our nation. That action was \r\nalso taken to demonstrate that Serbia wishes to move to \r\na climate of total reconciliation throughout the region. \r\nWe feel that we have done our part. \r\n Equally, we insist that everyone else does their \r\npart as well. As in all previous instances involving war \r\ncrimes and crimes against humanity in the Balkans, the \r\nSecurity Council has given a mandate to investigate. \r\nThat has greatly contributed to the process of regional \r\nreconciliation. This is the standard that must be applied \r\nin uncovering the full truth about allegations made in a \r\ndeeply disturbing report by the Council of Europe, \r\nentitled “Inhuman treatment of people and illicit \r\ntrafficking in human organs in Kosovo”. Only the \r\nSecurity Council can make sure a comprehensive \r\ninvestigation takes place. Only it can give a universal \r\nmandate and jurisdiction to ensure that all perpetrators \r\nof war crimes in the Balkans are brought to justice, \r\nincluding those responsible for trafficking in human \r\norgans in Kosovo. I strongly believe that ending the \r\nculture of impunity in some parts of the Balkans is a \r\ncommon goal shared by every member of the \r\ninternational community. \r\n There is a certain irony to our proceedings today. \r\nThis year we have welcomed a new member to the \r\nUnited Nations family, the Republic of South Sudan. \r\nThe Republic of Serbia welcomes its membership in \r\nthe United Nations. We welcome them because they \r\nand the Republic of the Sudan, after many years of \r\nconflict, arrived at a settlement that was achieved as a \r\nresult of long, difficult negotiations between the two \r\nparties.  \r\n The fundamental principle that the best \r\nsettlements occur when two parties agree, each making \r\ncompromises, surely is universal. I subscribe \r\nenthusiastically to the comments by the President of \r\nthe United States, made from this rostrum, on that very \r\nsubject of negotiations. I agree that there is no shortcut \r\nto ending a conflict that has endured for a long time, \r\nand that peace depends on compromise among people, \r\nwho must live together long after our speeches are \r\nover. \r\n However, this rule is not being applied to Serbia \r\non the matter of its province of Kosovo and Metohija. \r\nOn 17 February 2008, Kosovo’s ethnic Albanian \r\nauthorities attempted unilateral secession, a violation \r\nof the basic principles of the United Nations Charter, \r\nthe Helsinki Final Act and Security Council resolution \r\n1244 (1999). A majority of Member States have \r\nrefrained from recognizing Kosovo’s unilateral \r\ndeclaration of independence. They have continued to \r\nabide by their United Nations Charter obligations to \r\nrespect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of my \r\ncountry. On behalf of the Republic of Serbia, allow me \r\nto once again sincerely thank those countries for their \r\nsupport and solidarity.  \r\n Earlier this week, we heard from this rostrum a \r\ndangerous appeal for countries to recognize Kosovo. \r\nThat appeal does not contribute to regional stability. \r\nRather, it lessens our chances of finding a solution we \r\ncan all accept. The appeal we heard is not an appeal for \r\npeace but an appeal to endorse unilateralism and would \r\ncreate a deeply disturbing precedent, namely, \r\nencouragement for secessionists everywhere. \r\n In July, talks between Belgrade and Pristina, \r\nfacilitated by the European Union, were briefly \r\nsuspended by the facilitator. At that time, there was an \r\nattempt to impose customs officers on the \r\nadministrative boundary line between Serbia proper \r\nand North Kosovo. Violence erupted. My Government \r\ndid all it could to prevent violence from spreading, but \r\nwas this necessary? The effect was to remind Serbs that \r\nthey are negotiating with a gun to their heads and with \r\nthe constant threat of international isolation. It reminds \r\nA/66/PV.20  \r\n \r\n11-51191 8 \r\n \r\nSerbs that the excuse of violence by others is a tool \r\nused irresponsibly to threaten Serbs. It reminds Serbs \r\nof the anti-Serb pogroms in Kosovo in March of 2004. \r\nIt reminds Serbs of the failed negotiations and the \r\nimposition of a unilaterally declared independence. \r\n I want to remind the Assembly and all Members \r\nof the United Nations that on 5 October 2000 the \r\nRepublic of Serbia voluntarily and peacefully \r\noverthrew its past and entered a new phase in its \r\nhistory, in which it placed the fate of the Serbian nation \r\nunder the protection of democracy, civility, peace and \r\ndialogue. \r\n For this reason, we take grave offence at this \r\nclimate of threat emanating from countries that we \r\nwould otherwise consider our most natural partners. In \r\nthe case of Serbia, the dialogue between two parties \r\nwas initiated in March 2011, following a delay of \r\nseveral months to accommodate the electoral schedule \r\nin Pristina. \r\n We have made very significant progress during \r\nthose negotiations. The Republic of Serbia, I assure the \r\nAssembly, will remain a very active party to this \r\ndialogue. There are numerous issues that must be \r\naddressed in the months ahead. I appeal to all involved \r\nto remain engaged in this process in a constructive \r\nspirit. To that end, we expect the International Security \r\nForce in Kosovo and the European Union Rule of Law \r\nMission in Kosovo to fully observe the United Nations \r\ndoctrine of status neutrality, in accordance with their \r\nmandates under Security Council resolution 1244 \r\n(1999), the source of their universal legitimacy, both \r\non the ground and in the international arena. \r\n Progress needs trust. Negotiations and \r\nreconciliation are not achieved through concessions \r\nfrom one side only. Success does not occur when \r\nthreats of violence are issued and coercive action takes \r\nplace in the course of negotiations. Our response to this \r\nis to say that, just as we will never accept unilateral \r\naction, we will also not abandon the negotiation \r\nprocess. \r\n This is why we have stated that we cannot and \r\nwill not recognize the unilaterally declared \r\nindependence of Kosovo. It is also why we believe that \r\nwe must settle all other issues with Pristina, because \r\nour region needs to have a stable environment. \r\n The Republic of Serbia has always sought \r\ntangible assurances, bound by international agreement \r\nand guarantees, that Serbian communities inhabiting \r\nKosovo, Serbian interests and Serbia’s cultural heritage \r\nwill be protected and allowed to flourish. \r\n Many of these issues have been discussed over \r\nthe past few years in different formats. Occasionally, \r\nthere have been agreements reached, but never \r\nimplemented. It is time that matters were clarified. Any \r\nform of understanding on the matter of Kosovo has as a \r\nconditio sine qua non the explicit negotiated and \r\nguaranteed agreement on the following matters \r\nessential to the protection of Serbs in Kosovo. \r\n The first concerns the status of the Serbian \r\npopulation in North Kosovo. All acknowledge that this \r\nis an issue that must be addressed on the basis of the \r\ncurrent realities. Attempts to change the current \r\nrealities would not be conducive to constructive \r\nsolutions. \r\n The second issue involves the proper \r\nimplementation of decentralization in Kosovo. All \r\nthose enclaves that are isolated from other Serbs must \r\nhave a political, judicial and economic life providing \r\nthe standards that allow them to prosper where they \r\nare. Serbia remains ready to continue to provide the \r\nnecessary support to these threatened populations. \r\n The third issue is that of the status of the Serbian \r\nOrthodox Church and of some of its key holy sites. The \r\nprotection of those sites and the special status that must \r\nbe given to them to preserve their unique identity and \r\ntheir livelihoods is a matter of fundamental concern. It \r\ncomes as a matter of surprise to me that an offer that \r\nwould be acceptable to the Republic of Serbia and the \r\nSerbian Orthodox Church has not been volunteered by \r\nthe other side. That issue is one of the most basic, and \r\nits denial should be considered a total embarrassment \r\nto the authorities in Pristina and the supervisory \r\ninstitutions and nations present in Kosovo. \r\n Finally, the question of property must be \r\nresolved. Thousands of private claims remain pending, \r\nmaking hostages of those internally displaced in 1999. \r\nCommercial property claims are unresolved, as well. \r\n The failure to advance with goodwill on the very \r\nissue that is at the core of our concerns — the rights of \r\nthe Serbian communities in Kosovo — is very \r\ndisturbing. For us, those four issues are the litmus test. \r\n There is so much to say about the progress in my \r\ncountry that is positive that it always saddens me that I \r\nmust repeat my concerns about the way in which the \r\n A/66/PV.20\r\n \r\n9 11-51191 \r\n \r\nissue of Kosovo is being handled. Let us all recall that \r\nSecurity Council resolution 1244 (1999) placed \r\nKosovo under the interim administration of the United \r\nNations, pending a comprehensive settlement endorsed \r\nby the Security Council. There is a limit to what and \r\nfor how long Serbia must be held accountable for \r\ndevelopments where it is asked to assume responsibility, \r\nbut without the necessary authority.  \r\n I look forward to the day when I can stand at this \r\nrostrum and report that we have resolved that issue and \r\nthat we have found a mutually acceptable compromise, \r\nnot an imposed outcome where one side gets \r\neverything that it has ever wanted and the other side \r\ngets nothing. A maximalist zero-sum approach is a \r\nsolution with no future. We are ready. We are \r\ncommitted. It is for others to provide grounds for \r\noptimism. \r\n The Republic of Serbia has two immediate \r\nparallel objectives: to secure a mutually acceptable \r\narrangement in Kosovo that provides iron-clad \r\nguarantees for the Serbian communities and to \r\naccelerate our progress to membership of the European \r\nUnion. Both those objectives are achievable. It would \r\nbe foolish for anyone to think that one objective will be \r\nsacrificed on the altar of the other. It is for others to \r\ndecide whether they think that the achievement of \r\nthose two objectives is for the good of the region and \r\nfor stability. We are convinced that it is in everyone’s \r\ninterest. \r\n I believe that Serbia has met the criteria to be \r\ninvited to be a candidate for membership of the \r\nEuropean Union. I also believe that my country is \r\nready to start accession negotiations. I believe that if \r\nthat were to occur, Serbia would, for the first time in \r\n20 years, begin to believe that the EU actually sees \r\nSerbia as an integral part of a complete European \r\nUnion. \r\n I fervently believe that my country has set an \r\nexample in the region in matters related to \r\nreconciliation, the establishment of the rule of law and \r\nthe fight against organized crime, as well as in building \r\nthe administrative capacity to handle European norms. \r\n Our battle against organized crime is a global \r\none. We know that international organized crime wants \r\nto use the region of South-East Europe as a base to \r\npenetrate the EU. The Republic of Serbia has decided \r\nthat it is a strategic priority and a national security \r\npriority that Serbia will help prevent that. Serbia is \r\ntherefore fighting a battle to protect citizens of the \r\nEuropean Union. It is actively engaged in a wider \r\nstrategy to destroy the links between organized crime \r\nand international terrorism. We cooperate with all \r\nnations that share those objectives. We appeal to the \r\nentire region to join us in that battle.  \r\n I am therefore convinced that the presence of \r\nSerbia as a candidate, actively negotiating its \r\naccession, is an important asset for the European \r\nUnion.  \r\n In that way, Serbia can continue to be an even \r\nmore effective member of the United Nations, \r\ncontributing fully and enthusiastically to the issues that \r\ntouch common humanity. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Serbia for the statement he \r\nhas just made. \r\n Mr. Boris Tadić, President of the Republic of \r\nSerbia, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Alpha Condé, President of the \r\nRepublic of Guinea \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Guinea. \r\n Mr. Alpha Condé, President of the Republic of \r\nGuinea, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Alpha Condé, President of the Republic of Guinea, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Condé (spoke in French): It is a great \r\nhonour for me to address the General Assembly as the \r\nfirst democratically elected President in the history of \r\nmy country since its independence, following a free, \r\ntransparent and credible election whose result was \r\naccepted by all. My country paid a high price for the \r\ndawn of democracy, to which I have devoted almost \r\n50 years of my life.  \r\n Today, Guinea has turned an important page in its \r\nhistory. I would like to take this opportunity to express \r\nthe people of Guinea’s gratitude to the international \r\nA/66/PV.20  \r\n \r\n11-51191 10 \r\n \r\ncommunity, in particular the International Contact \r\nGroup on Guinea, for their untiring efforts in the \r\ncontext of my country’s return to constitutional \r\nnormality. To those thanks, I add my brother and friend \r\nPresident Blaise Compaoré, President of Burkina Faso, \r\nwho, as mediator in the Guinean crisis, spared no effort \r\nto restore constitutional order in Guinea. \r\n My presence in this Hall, which says much about \r\nthe history of peoples and nations, represents Guinea’s \r\nreturn to the international stage. This is the place for \r\nme to assure the international community of my \r\nGovernment’s commitment to respect and promote \r\nhuman rights, strengthen unity and national harmony, \r\nbuild a democratic society and ensure the progress and \r\nprosperity of the Guinean people. \r\n The challenges to be addressed are many and \r\ncomplex. The socio-economic situation that we \r\ninherited was hardly bright: an utterly failed economy \r\nwith the resulting inflation, corruption and a \r\ncompletely dysfunctional State. \r\n The outcome of the presidential election in \r\nNovember 2010 therefore expressed the legitimate \r\naspiration of the people of Guinea to profound change \r\nthat would foster the economic and social development \r\nof the country. That thirst for change is also justified \r\nby the considerable backwardness evident in our \r\ncountry despite its considerable human and natural \r\nresources. That is why, the day after the presidential \r\nelection, we committed without delay to a series of \r\nremedial measures in order to provide the way for \r\nbetter governance in the country. \r\n Strategies and dynamic policies were drawn up \r\nand implemented to improve people’s living \r\nconditions. Among the reforms pledged, the \r\nGovernment grants agriculture priority in order to \r\nachieve food self-sufficiency. Likewise, the mining \r\nsector is being reorganized through the adoption of a \r\nnew more attractive policy that takes into account the \r\ninterests of Guinea and its partners. \r\n As part of that momentum for change, actions \r\ncontinue for the modernization and restructuring of the \r\njudicial system in order to ensure the promotion and \r\nprotection of citizens’ rights and freedoms and to \r\nestablish an attractive investment climate. \r\n On the financial level, reform will make it \r\npossible to control inflation, prevent the \r\nmisappropriation of public funds and avoid having to \r\nprint money, as well as allow us to combat poor \r\ngovernance, impunity and corruption. Strict \r\nmanagement measures, such as the State one-stop shop, \r\nstrengthening economic oversight and the overhaul of \r\nthe administration, as well as undertaking audits, will \r\nstop financial losses and correct malfunctions. \r\n Apart from the steps to improve macroeconomic \r\nmanagement and the structural reforms that I have just \r\ndescribed, the Government has drawn up poverty \r\nreduction strategies to meet the population’s basic \r\nneeds for income and access to basic social services, in \r\nparticular drinking water and power supplies. \r\nSustainable development being a major goal of the \r\nGovernment, it is clear that the health-care, education \r\nand environment sectors are among our Government’s \r\npriorities. \r\n However, that ambitious programme to combat \r\nunderdevelopment and poverty cannot be fully \r\naccomplished without the ongoing and effective \r\nsupport of the international community. Moreover, \r\nnegotiations are under way with the Bretton Woods \r\ninstitutions on the signing of an agreement, which is \r\nalmost complete, on the Heavily Indebted Poor \r\nCountries Initiative to considerably reduce the Guinean \r\ndebt. That will enable us to free up considerable \r\nfinancial resources and devote them to the sustainable \r\ndevelopment of our country. \r\n I wish to acknowledge our deep appreciation for, \r\nand to renew our faith in, the World Bank, the \r\nInternational Monetary Fund and the African \r\nDevelopment Bank for the efforts already agreed on \r\nimplementing our development strategy. I would also \r\nlike to take this opportunity to express the Guinean \r\npeople’s gratitude to all bilateral, regional and \r\nmultilateral development partners for their valuable \r\ncontribution to the national development effort. \r\n National reconciliation remains the cornerstone \r\nof our action. My approach in that process is to directly \r\ninvolve the population at the grassroots. In that \r\ncontext, I set up a provisional commission of \r\nreflection, co-chaired by the Grand Imam and the \r\nArchbishop of Conakry. That commission will work \r\nwith the wise men of the regions and prefectures on the \r\nways and means to bolster national unity for a genuine \r\nreconciliation. \r\n As a component of the nation, the army is among \r\nour priorities. The reforms seek to make it a truly \r\n A/66/PV.20\r\n \r\n11 11-51191 \r\n \r\nrepublican institution — guardian of peace, security \r\nand development.  \r\n Women and young people are key stakeholders in \r\nour socio-economic development. Those sectors of \r\nsociety receive my Government’s constant attention. In \r\nthat regard, the empowerment of young people and \r\nwomen is another important factor. \r\n Following the presidential election, the people of \r\nGuinea are now working to prepare legislative \r\nelections, which will enshrine the return to \r\nconstitutional order. In that context, we decided to \r\nestablish a secure computerized electoral roll that will \r\nmake it possible to correct the anomalies noted during \r\nthe presidential election and to ensure the participation \r\nof all Guineans of voting age in the election. \r\n The Millennium Summit, held in New York in \r\n2000, committed itself in an ambitious declaration to \r\nreduce extreme poverty by 2015 (see resolution 55/2). \r\nDespite several meetings, strategies drawn up at the \r\nState level and the participation of the international \r\ncommunity, in particular through the Monterrey \r\nConsensus, the Rome summit on food security, the \r\nJohannesburg summit on sustainable development and \r\nthe Beijing summit on social development, many \r\nchallenges are still to be addressed.  \r\n We therefore need to periodically assess the \r\ndirection of the supporting measures to ensure that the \r\nlofty goals that have been set are met. That approach is \r\nshared by external partners, political parties, civil \r\nsociety, unions and other actors.  \r\n Despite the international community’s repeated \r\ncalls for peace, areas of conflict and tension continue \r\nin several regions of the world, in particular in Africa, \r\nthe Middle East and Asia. The occupation of \r\nPalestinian land by the State of Israel is an ongoing \r\nconcern. The Palestinian people must exercise their \r\nlegitimate and inalienable rights, including the right of \r\nreturn to their lands and the right to establish an \r\nindependent State, within the borders established \r\nbefore June 1967, in peace and security alongside the \r\nState of Israel. That principled path alone could lead to \r\na comprehensive and lasting peace, which is a \r\nguarantee for all countries in the region, including \r\nIsrael. \r\n The advent of a stable climate in Côte d’Ivoire, a \r\nbrother country and neighbour, is reassuring after years \r\nof fratricidal clashes.  \r\n My delegation welcomes the entry of the \r\nRepublic of South Sudan into the body of free nations. \r\n The tragic humanitarian situation prevailing in \r\nthe Horn of Africa is a source of serious concern. The \r\nefforts of the United Nations, the African Union and \r\nhumanitarian organizations and institutions currently \r\nunder way to provide assistance and protection to \r\npopulations in distress must continue. The adoption of \r\na comprehensive regional plan for food security and \r\nself-sufficiency would provide a lasting solution to the \r\ncurrent crisis. However, Guinea attaches great \r\nimportance to the positive settlement of the fratricidal \r\nconflict in Somalia.  \r\n The Republic of Guinea has always participated \r\nin the collective effort to promote international peace \r\nand security, and it seeks to strengthen its role in that \r\narea. Indeed, my delegation believes that mediation is \r\nthe most effective tool for the prevention and \r\nsettlement of conflicts and for the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security. It is clear that States \r\nmust create the domestic conditions to prevent and \r\nsettle disputes with the support of the United Nations.  \r\n In addition, subregional, regional and \r\ninternational organizations must adopt mediation \r\nmechanisms, while working closely with other actors, \r\nsuch as civil society and youth and women’s \r\norganizations. In the particular case of Africa, my \r\ndelegation would hope that priority be given to African \r\nmediation mechanisms, whose action has shown to be \r\neffective on several occasions.  \r\n Given the relevance of the central theme of the \r\ncurrent session, the Guinean delegation hopes that our \r\ndebates will further strengthen the role and action of \r\nour universal Organization. The United Nations is the \r\ncrucible of our aspirations and the mirror of our \r\ncollective vision and our joint fight for improved well-\r\nbeing and peace. To that end, it must pursue in-depth \r\nreforms of its structures, operation and decision-taking \r\nmechanisms so as to be more effective and credible. \r\n I wish to reaffirm the joint African position \r\nagreed at Ezulwini for fairer representation on the \r\nSecurity Council. In that regard, Guinea will continue \r\nto support the action of the Secretary-General, whose \r\nre-election fills us with great joy. We are convinced \r\nthat the new mandate will enable him to continue and \r\nto strengthen his efforts towards achieving the noble \r\nideals enshrined in the Charter. \r\nA/66/PV.20  \r\n \r\n11-51191 12 \r\n \r\n I could not finish without conveying my \r\ncongratulations to His Excellency Mr. Nassir \r\nAbdulaziz Al-Nasser on his election as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at the sixty-sixth ordinary session. I \r\nwish him every success in carrying out his difficult \r\ntask. To his predecessor, Mr. Joseph Deiss, I would like \r\nto express our gratitude for his excellent work during \r\nhis term. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Guinea for the statement \r\nhe has just made. \r\n Mr. Alpha Condé, President of the Republic of \r\nGuinea, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Isaias Afwerki, President of the State \r\nof Eritrea \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe State of Eritrea. \r\n Mr. Isaias Afwerki, President of the State of \r\nEritrea, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Isaias Afwerki, President of the State of Eritrea, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly.  \r\n President Afwerki: Allow me begin by \r\ncongratulating the President of the General Assembly \r\nand his country, Qatar, on his election to preside over \r\nthe Assembly at this session, and by thanking \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his leadership and \r\nachievements. \r\n We gather at the sixty-sixth session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at an important juncture in the \r\nhistory of the world. We meet at a time of exciting \r\npossibilities and opportunities for the betterment of \r\nhundreds of millions of people. Yet, these favourable \r\nprospects must be weighed against the profound \r\ndangers and sense of anxiety that currently grip our \r\nworld. The persistent economic and financial crisis, \r\nmassive unemployment, growing inequality between \r\nand within nations, spiralling levels of debt, recurrent \r\nfamines and starvation, high levels of mortality from \r\neasily preventable diseases and an increasingly fragile \r\nenvironment are wreaking havoc on the lives of people \r\nand the future of nations. Despite the end of the Cold \r\nWar and the premature declaration of the emergence of \r\na new world order, wars and military interventions \r\ncontinue — almost invariably failing to resolve, and \r\nfurther complicating, the problems they set out to \r\nsolve. \r\n It is true that none of these problems are new, yet \r\nthere is no denying that the malaise seems much more \r\nintractable today. Three years ago, the world was \r\ninfused by a renewed spirit of hope and possibility with \r\nthe historic election of President Barack Obama and \r\nthe freshness of his message of positive change. \r\nHowever, in spite his best efforts, the strength of his \r\npersonality and his many talents, that hope has not \r\nbeen realized. The reality is that the problems we face \r\nare systemic, were accumulated over many years and \r\ndecades, and require systemic and structural change. \r\nEffecting this real, positive and durable transformation \r\nrequires not only the effort of one leader and one \r\nnation and its allies, but the concerted effort of all \r\nnations. We look towards the emerging and \r\nre-emerging Powers — China, India, Russia, Brazil \r\nand others — to show more leadership and to shoulder \r\nbigger responsibilities. We also believe that all nations, \r\nwhatever their size, can and should play an \r\nincreasingly bigger and effective role in the endeavour \r\nto build a fair, just, equitable and sustainable world. \r\n This year has seen stirring and courageous \r\ninitiatives taken by the people of many nations to effect \r\nfundamental changes that would lead to a new and \r\ndignified beginning for them and their countries. While \r\nthe epicentre of the movement has been in North Africa \r\nand the Middle East, it is not limited to the Arab world \r\nor to developing nations. In much of the developed \r\nworld, there is now the same sense of anger and \r\nfrustration, the same discontent with Governments that \r\nhave become beholden to a small minority with special \r\ninterests and the same yearning for decent jobs, \r\nmeaningful political participation and dignified lives. \r\nThese realities cannot, and should not, be denied. \r\nClearly, this is not the time for complacency or \r\narrogance. What is required today is a frank \r\nacknowledgement of the stark global reality we face, \r\nand the readiness to empower our peoples and our \r\nyouth and to work cooperatively for a secure and \r\nbrighter future for all. \r\n As we ponder the future and take stock of the \r\nsweeping changes that are under way, we cannot fail to \r\n A/66/PV.20\r\n \r\n13 11-51191 \r\n \r\nunderscore that the United Nations has already become \r\nhopelessly outdated and risks becoming totally \r\nirrelevant. We all profess agreement on the need to \r\ntransform the institutions and procedures of the United \r\nNations, but we remain paralysed, with no prospects \r\nfor early progress.  \r\n Eritrea firmly associates itself with those who \r\nstress the urgency of real reform and believes that what \r\nis required is not a mere tweaking of the system but a \r\ncomprehensive transformation of the institution. The \r\ncritical element of this transformation has to be the \r\nstrengthening of the authority and role of the General \r\nAssembly. As long as this paramount body is deprived \r\nof real decision-making powers, the United Nations \r\nwill remain unrepresentative of the nations of the \r\nworld, even if the size and composition of the Security \r\nCouncil changes significantly. Similarly, there can be \r\nno meaningful revitalization without overhauling the \r\nmethods of work and procedures of the United Nations, \r\nrespecting the rights of Member States and ensuring \r\ntransparency and accountability in all bodies of the \r\nOrganization. \r\n Half a century has elapsed since the heyday of the \r\nera of decolonization that led to the emergence of \r\nindependent African nations. In spite the hope and \r\nenthusiasm of the early years and the achievements \r\nregistered since, the past five decades have been \r\nlargely disappointing. The trying times and the internal \r\nand external challenges that caused them are certainly \r\nnot over, as Africa continues to struggle in a difficult \r\nand complex international environment. Yet, without \r\nexaggerating the possibilities or underestimating the \r\ndifficulties, it is clear that a number of African \r\ncountries are entering a period of political, economic \r\nand social renewal. They are convinced that Africa has \r\nthe human and natural resources to succeed. It will not \r\nshun international partnerships but will give primacy to \r\nits own capabilities and to cooperation at the \r\ncontinental and subregional levels. It is this perspective \r\nthat is spurring African countries to focus on the key \r\nrequirements of developing the continent’s \r\ninfrastructure and promoting trade and economic links \r\namong themselves. Another key component is the \r\nrevitalization of the African Union and subregional \r\norganizations. \r\n At the subregional level, Eritrea is committed to \r\neconomic development and integration in the wider \r\nHorn of Africa and Red Sea regions. We are convinced \r\nthat no country can succeed in a turbulent environment. \r\nWe will work for the revitalization of the \r\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development and \r\nstrive to make it effective in promoting economic \r\ndevelopment and integration.  \r\n We welcome an independent South Sudan and \r\nwill work with both the Sudan and South Sudan, with \r\nwhom we have long-standing ties, as they grapple with \r\ntheir domestic situations and endeavour to build \r\ncooperative relations.  \r\n On Somalia, it has now become abundantly clear \r\nthat there is a need for a new approach, as the current \r\none has exhausted itself and can only lead to further \r\ncomplications. Given that the central objective remains \r\nthe reconstitution of Somalia and the rebuilding of \r\neffective institutions, it is imperative to seriously \r\nengage and bring into a Somali-owned political process \r\nall stakeholders, including the Governments of \r\nSomaliland and Puntland. \r\n With regard to the Middle East, which is a key \r\nitem on the agenda of the current session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, Eritrea reaffirms its long-standing \r\nsupport for the right of the Palestinian people to self-\r\ndetermination and an independent, sovereign State. It \r\nalso upholds the right of Israel to live in peace and \r\nsecurity within internationally recognized boundaries. \r\nAt the same time, Eritrea is genuinely concerned that \r\nthe current drive for United Nations membership for \r\nPalestine does not become a symbolic battle bereft of \r\nreal substance. It is only prudent and relevant to recall \r\nthat with the exception of a few realistic voices, the \r\nOslo Accords were greeted with much acclaim and \r\nthat, almost two decades later, they have not led to \r\neither Palestinian Statehood or peace between the \r\nPalestinian and Israeli peoples. \r\n Finally, I would be remiss in my duty if I did not \r\nremind the United Nations of its responsibility to \r\nuphold its Charter, international law and numerous \r\nSecurity Council resolutions and take urgent action to \r\nend Ethiopia’s occupation of sovereign Eritrean \r\nterritory. Coupled with the lifting of the illegal \r\nsanctions on Eritrea, that would not only serve the \r\ncause of justice, but it would enable the people of the \r\nregion to work together to further their collective \r\ninterests and consolidate Africa’s place in the world. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the State of Eritrea for the statement he \r\nhas just made. \r\nA/66/PV.20  \r\n \r\n11-51191 14 \r\n \r\n Mr. Isaias Afwerki, President of the State of \r\nEritrea, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Marcus Stephen, President of the \r\nRepublic of Nauru \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Nauru. \r\n Mr. Stephen, President of the Republic of Nauru, \r\nwas escorted into the General Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Marcus Stephen, President of the Republic of \r\nNauru, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Stephen: Allow me to congratulate \r\nMr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on his assumption of \r\nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-\r\nsixth session. Allow me also to commend his \r\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss, for his \r\ncapable leadership during the sixty-fifth session. \r\n I would like to begin my statement by thanking \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his historic visit to \r\nKiribati and Solomon Islands earlier this month. That \r\nwas the first time that a sitting Secretary-General \r\nvisited a Pacific island country, and it demonstrates his \r\ncommitment to addressing the needs of all countries, \r\nno matter how small or remote. From my conversations \r\nwith the Secretary-General, I know he left the region \r\nwith a much clearer understanding of the special \r\nchallenges we face as small island nations. I look \r\nforward to working with the Secretary-General on \r\nfinding ways for the United Nations system to be more \r\nresponsive to the unique and particular needs of small \r\nisland developing States (SIDS). \r\n While on his tour of the Pacific, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral observed that  \r\n “Next month, the 7 billionth citizen of our world \r\nwill be born. For that child, and for all of us, we \r\nmust keep working to fight poverty, create decent \r\njobs and provide a dignified life while preserving \r\nthe planet that sustains us. That is why I have \r\nsaid that the sustainable development agenda is \r\nthe agenda for the twenty-first century”. (see \r\nSG/SM/13780) \r\n Sustainable development and poverty alleviation \r\nhave been the overriding priorities of my presidency \r\nsince I assumed office, in 2007. We have made great \r\nstrides domestically, but we will still fall short of our \r\nambitious goals until the international community \r\nchooses to create an environment in which all countries \r\nhave the opportunity to realize their sustainable \r\ndevelopment aspirations. \r\n Nauru’s culture and economy, like those of most \r\nPacific SIDS, are heavily dependent on a healthy and \r\nproductive marine environment. The ocean is the \r\nfoundation of our food security and is a major source \r\nof Government revenue. It is for that reason that the \r\nPacific SIDS are calling for the next Earth Summit in \r\nRio to recognize the importance of the “blue economy” \r\nto small island and coastal States. I would like to thank \r\nMaldives, Australia and New Zealand, as well as the \r\nSecretary-General, for standing with the Pacific SIDS \r\non this issue. \r\n We have identified three priority areas for the \r\nRio+20 outcome. First, we must enable SIDS to enjoy \r\na greater share of the economic benefits derived from \r\ntheir marine and coastal resources. Secondly, we must \r\nreduce, and eventually eliminate, overfishing and \r\ndestructive fishing practices. It is imperative that we \r\nensure that our fisheries are sustainable. Finally, we \r\nmust build up the resilience of coral reef ecosystems to \r\nthe impacts of climate change and ocean acidification. \r\nAdopting our proposals would begin to create the space \r\nneeded for small islands to thrive.  \r\n My Government is not sitting still while it waits \r\nfor the international community to act. This past \r\nsummer, Nauru’s application to the International \r\nSeabed Authority was granted, which will enable my \r\ncountry to engage in new and innovative ways to \r\ngenerate economic growth and move towards aid \r\nindependence. Nauru is not endowed with terrestrial \r\nresources, and therefore has chosen to look to the \r\noceans to expand its opportunities for economic and \r\nsocial development.  \r\n The proceeds from our exploration and \r\ndevelopment of copper, nickel and manganese \r\nresources will go to two fully Nauruan-owned funds, \r\none that supports education and training, and the other, \r\nhealth and environment. This Nauru-controlled, \r\ndomestically driven initiative will adhere to the highest \r\ninternational environmental standards. \r\n A/66/PV.20\r\n \r\n15 11-51191 \r\n \r\n The sustainable development challenges of SIDS \r\nare widely recognized by the international community; \r\nhowever, our success in addressing them has been \r\nmixed at best. At last year’s High-level Plenary \r\nMeeting on the Millennium Development Goals, it was \r\ndetermined that progress for most Pacific islands had \r\nbeen lagging in many areas. Targeted assistance to \r\naddress the unique and particular vulnerabilities of \r\nSIDS is urgently needed. It is Nauru’s position that the \r\nmost effective way to accomplish this objective is for \r\nthe United Nations to recognize a formal SIDS \r\ncategory, with dedicated support mechanisms. \r\n Unfortunately, all of our best efforts will have \r\nbeen for naught if we do not take immediate action to \r\naddress climate change. As Pacific island leaders \r\nrecognized earlier this month, climate change \r\nrepresents the single greatest threat to the livelihoods, \r\nsecurity and well-being of the peoples of the Pacific. \r\n The seventeenth Conference of the Parties to the \r\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange, to be held in Durban, must make significant \r\nprogress towards a comprehensive, legally binding \r\nagreement that can ensure the survival of all nations. \r\nThe parties must agree to a second commitment period \r\nunder the Kyoto Protocol, so that new commitments \r\nare in place by 2013. The parties must also \r\noperationalize the agreements reached at Cancún, \r\nincluding more ambitious mitigation commitments and \r\nactions, the operationalization of the new Green \r\nClimate Fund, and a mandate to conclude a new legally \r\nbinding agreement based on the work of the Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group on Long-term Cooperative Action. \r\n Climate change threatens to undo all of our recent \r\ndevelopment gains if the major biggest polluters \r\ncontinue down the path of business as usual. Some \r\nPacific islands may disappear entirely. It is an \r\nunfortunate reality that there is so much carbon in the \r\natmosphere that many of the negative impacts of \r\nclimate change may now be unavoidable. For that \r\nreason, Nauru applauds the recent open debate in the \r\nSecurity Council on climate change. While the final \r\npresidential statement was not as strong as we had \r\nhoped, it clearly recognizes the threat posed by climate \r\nchange to international peace and security and lays the \r\nfoundation for future work by the Council on the issue.  \r\n Few countries doubt the connection between \r\nclimate change and security, but there is still \r\ndisagreement as to the way forward. Allow me to \r\nreiterate the proposals of the Pacific SIDS. \r\n First, the Secretary-General should appoint a \r\nspecial representative on climate and security to \r\nanalyse the projected security impacts of climate \r\nchange, so that the Council and Member States can \r\nbetter understand what lies ahead. Secondly, the \r\nSecretary-General should assess the capacity of the \r\nUnited Nations system to respond to the likely security \r\nimpacts of climate change, so that vulnerable countries \r\ncan be assured that it is up to the task. These two \r\nproposals represent the absolute minimum necessary to \r\nprepare for the greatest threat to international peace \r\nand security of our generation. \r\n The Security Council must grapple with the most \r\nurgent security threats of our time if it is to remain \r\nrelevant. Likewise, it should evolve along with \r\nemerging geopolitical realities and become more \r\nrepresentative and inclusive. It is for this reason that \r\nNauru supports an early reform of the Security Council \r\nthrough an enlargement of both the permanent and \r\nnon-permanent categories and an improvement in its \r\nworking methods. \r\n We believe very strongly that new members \r\nshould be geographically diverse. However, it is \r\nequally important that aspiring members demonstrate \r\ntheir commitment to addressing the most urgent \r\nsecurity issues facing all Member States. As an \r\nexample, I would like to highlight Germany’s bold \r\nleadership of the Security Council this past July, when \r\nit took the politically courageous decision to host the \r\nopen debate on climate change. As I said earlier, \r\nclimate change is the overriding security threat facing \r\nthe Pacific region, and Germany’s efforts will not be \r\nforgotten. \r\n In a similar vein, the United Nations should \r\nensure that all citizens of the world have the \r\nopportunity to participate in its activities. We cannot \r\ncontinue to ignore the more than 23 million people \r\nwho live in Taiwan, who have repeatedly demonstrated \r\nthat they are a nation committed to peace and regional \r\ncooperation. We therefore support enabling Taiwan’s \r\nmeaningful engagement in connection with the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change \r\nand the International Civil Aviation Organization. \r\n The recent renaming of the Group of Asian \r\nStates, to the Group of Asia and the Pacific Small \r\nIsland Developing States, is a welcome change that \r\nA/66/PV.20  \r\n \r\n11-51191 16 \r\n \r\nexemplifies the inclusivity that should characterize all \r\naspects of the United Nations system. I commend the \r\nGroup for having taken this symbolic step and \r\nrecognizing the 20 per cent of the membership that \r\nresides in the Pacific Ocean region. \r\n However, we must move beyond symbolism to \r\nconcrete action that addresses the actual concerns of \r\nsmall and vulnerable countries. Once again, I implore \r\nthe Assembly to support the appointment of a special \r\nrepresentative on climate and security for the benefit of \r\nthe many nations around the world for whom climate \r\nchange is a grave and, in some cases, existential threat. \r\n My Government is preparing for a new challenge. \r\nIn 2012, Nauru will assume the chairmanship of the \r\nAlliance of Small Island States (AOSIS). I would like \r\nto recognize the Government of Grenada for its \r\ninspirational leadership and able execution of a \r\nsupremely difficult task. \r\n I am humbled by the trust placed in us by our \r\nfellow AOSIS colleagues and have no illusions \r\nregarding the enormity of the challenges that lie ahead. \r\nWe are entering a period in history when countries are \r\nturning inward, despite decades of evidence that \r\ncooperation is the surest path to prosperity. We must \r\nresist the urge to engage in zero-sum politics and \r\nrecommit to the principles of multilateralism enshrined \r\nin the United Nations Charter. Durban will be the next \r\nopportunity to embark on a more sustainable path and \r\ncreate a world we are proud to leave for future \r\ngenerations. We should not let this opportunity slip \r\naway. \r\n For years, leaders in the Pacific have implored \r\nthe peoples of the world to come to our islands and see \r\nthe impacts of climate change for themselves. The \r\nSecretary-General answered our call, and now he truly \r\nunderstands the urgency of our situation. \r\n Earlier this week, he spoke of a little girl named \r\nTamauri he met while in Kiribati (see A/66/PV.11). \r\nFrightened by the rising tides around her islands, she \r\nasked what the United Nations could do to help her \r\npeople. She is not alone. The children in all of our \r\ncountries — Cook Islands, Fiji, Micronesia, Palau, \r\nPapua New Guinea, the Marshall Islands, Niue, Samoa, \r\nSolomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu and my own, \r\nNauru — wonder whether they will have a future. I \r\nlook forward to working with the Secretary-General to \r\nmeet the challenge of the climate crisis so that we can \r\ntell them that they no longer need to be afraid. May \r\nGod bless the Republic of Nauru and may God bless \r\nthe United Nations. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Nauru for the statement he \r\nhas just made. \r\n Mr. Marcus Stephen, President of the Republic of \r\nNauru, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.  \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Mahamadou Issoufou, President of \r\nthe Republic of the Niger \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of the Niger. \r\n Mr. Mahamadou Issoufou, President of the \r\nRepublic of the Niger, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Mahamadou Issoufou, President of the Republic of \r\nthe Niger, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Issoufou (spoke in French): \r\n “They shall beat their swords into ploughshares, \r\nand their spears into pruning hooks. Nation shall \r\nnot lift up sword against nation, neither shall they \r\nlearn war any more.” (The Holy Bible, Isaiah 2:4) \r\n Far from achieving Isaiah’s prophecy, humankind \r\ncontinues to face serious challenges at this time when \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss has passed the baton \r\nto the new President after presiding brilliantly over the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its previous session. I have no \r\ndoubt that on his election to the presidency of the \r\nAssembly at its sixty-sixth session, the President brings \r\nto it great strengths, bolstered in particular with the \r\nunderstanding and mastery of international realities he \r\nhas acquired as, among other positions, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of his country, and having sat on the \r\nSecurity Council during Qatar’s non-permanent \r\nmembership. \r\n The President did well in choosing as the theme \r\nfor his term “The role of mediation in the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes”. Under the guidance of \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon, sustained efforts have \r\nbeen made in this area. Here I would like to pay tribute \r\n A/66/PV.20\r\n \r\n17 11-51191 \r\n \r\nto him for the work he has done during his first term \r\nand to congratulate him on his re-election on 21 June \r\nas head of the Organization. I would also like once \r\nagain to thank him for the Organization’s unfailing \r\nsupport during the multiple crises that my country, \r\nNiger, has undergone in recent years. More generally, \r\nwe have seen his commitment to the concerns of the \r\nAfrican continent and hope that his new term will \r\nenable him to continue on the same path. \r\n The choice of theme for the current session is \r\nproof that the prophecy of Isaiah, whose verse is \r\nrightly engraved in front of the United Nations \r\nbuilding, has been slow to become reality. Indeed, the \r\ninternational situation has been and continues to be \r\ncharacterized by serious tensions. We might have \r\nthought that the end of the cold war would open the \r\nway to an age of full and lasting peace around the \r\nworld. Unfortunately, owing to a lack of the ability or \r\nperhaps even the will to attack the evil at the root, our \r\nhope for a world free of conflict, like the line of the \r\nhorizon, recedes as we approach it. \r\n The root of the evil is bad political and economic \r\ngovernance. The promises of freedom, equality, justice, \r\nthe rule of law and solidarity that have been made to \r\nthe people of the world at the global and the national \r\nlevels have not always been kept. The absence of \r\nglobal economic regulation, the domination of \r\nfinancial capital over even the real economy, the \r\ngrowth of inequalities between and within nations are \r\njust so many factors in the chaos, crises and conflicts \r\nthat are disturbing peace around the world. Besides, \r\ncan a world where several billion people live in \r\npoverty be peaceful? What do the billion human beings \r\nwho are hungry have to lose? Can the Somalis, who are \r\nsuffering the tortures of hunger right now, or the \r\ninhabitants of the Sahel, who deal with hunger over \r\nand over again, believe that they live in a just, humane \r\nworld? Can extreme poverty coexist peacefully with \r\nextreme wealth? \r\n Today, 1,210 people, that is, 17 per 100 million of \r\nthe world’s population, control revenues of \r\n$4,500 billion — 8 per cent of the world’s aggregate \r\ngross domestic product (GDP) — while the income of \r\n20 per cent of the poorest represents only 1.5 per cent, \r\nand that of the 2.5 billion people who live on less than \r\n$2 a day — 40 per cent of the total population — \r\nrepresents only 5 per cent. Thus a thousand or so \r\npeople have an income one and a half times larger than \r\nall the 2.5 billion people living on less than $2 a day. \r\nBesides being morally shocking, this situation is \r\neconomically inefficient, since it strangles economic \r\ngrowth. Furthermore, the implementation of structural \r\nadjustment programmes that began in the 1980s is a \r\nperfect illustration of bad global economic governance. \r\nThe liberalization and privatization touted by such \r\nprogrammes were conducted anarchically; even today, \r\nsuch liberalization has been applied only in sectors \r\nwhere weak countries such as ours have no relative \r\nadvantages. As we know, such liberalization did not \r\naffect the markets for labour or agricultural products. \r\nMy country, Niger, has suffered greatly from such \r\npolicies. \r\n This is, finally, where we should recall that the \r\npromise made by the world’s wealthy nations, \r\nbeginning in the 1970s, to increase their public \r\ndevelopment aid to 0.7 per cent of GDP has still not \r\nbeen kept. If you add to that the recent crises in \r\nbanking and sovereign debt, along with the shortfall in \r\ndirect investment in Africa, where there is nonetheless \r\ngreat scope for economic growth, you can understand \r\nthe inadequacy of global economic growth, particularly \r\nthe collapse of economic growth in wealthy countries. \r\nThe economic elasticity and resilience we need to cope \r\nwith the crises will grow only with the development of \r\nthe countries of the South. The world’s equilibrium \r\ndepends on the balanced development of all its regions; \r\nin particular, the creation of a powerful middle class in \r\nevery region of the world will strengthen economic \r\ngrowth, stability and peace. \r\n For more than 60 years, the Middle East has been \r\none of the most turbulent regions on the planet. We had \r\ngreat hopes for the resumption on 9 May 2010 of \r\nindirect negotiations between the Israelis and \r\nPalestinians, mediated by the United Nations. The start \r\nof direct bilateral negotiations represented real hope \r\nfor reaching a global peace agreement based on a two-\r\nState solution, with an independent and viable \r\nPalestinian State living side by side in peace and \r\nsecurity with Israel and its neighbours. \r\n It is undoubtedly the failure of those talks that \r\nhas led the Palestinian Authority to take steps to \r\nachieve recognition of the State of Palestine based, on \r\nthe one hand, on the 1967 borders, and on the other, on \r\nits admission as a full Member of the United Nations. \r\nThis is the moment for our Organization to take a bold \r\ndecision designed to settle the Israel-Palestinian \r\nproblem definitively, a settlement without which the \r\nArab Spring will be unable to guarantee peace and \r\nA/66/PV.20  \r\n \r\n11-51191 18 \r\n \r\nsecurity in the entire Middle East. Indeed, the failure of \r\ndemocracies to resolve this long-standing crisis will \r\ninevitably reinforce terrorism and will erase the \r\ndemocratic achievements of the Spring.  \r\n My country, Niger, one of the 122 Member States \r\nthat have already recognized the State of Palestine, is \r\nsupporting its request for full membership in the \r\nUnited Nations, as presented this morning at this sixty-\r\nsixth session of the General Assembly. \r\n The tenth anniversary of the terrorist attacks \r\nagainst the United States, commemorated last \r\n11 September, and the recent suicide attack against the \r\nUnited Nations headquarters in Abuja in Nigeria prove \r\nthat no region of the world is safe from terrorism. We \r\nfirmly condemn all acts of terrorism, wherever, for \r\nwhatever reason and by whomever they are committed, \r\nas they present one of the most serious threats to peace \r\nand security.  \r\n Terrorism, as the Assembly knows, attacks the \r\nvalues that constitute the essence of the United Nations \r\nCharter: respect for human rights, the rule of law, the \r\nrules governing war and the protection of civilians, \r\ntolerance among peoples and nations and the peaceful \r\nresolution of disputes.  \r\n In Niger, we face this threat on our northern \r\nborder with Algeria, to the west with Mali and to the \r\nsouth with Nigeria. I would like to pay a well-deserved \r\ntribute to the Nigerian security and defence forces, \r\nsome of whom have given their lives in their \r\ncommitment to protecting our country from terrorism.  \r\n Along with that threat, of course, we also have to \r\nface criminal organizations that traffic in weapons, \r\ndrugs and human beings. All of these threats have been \r\nexacerbated by the Libyan crisis. Indeed, arms depots \r\nhave been pillaged in Libya. Those weapons are now \r\ndistributed throughout the Sahara and Sahel area and \r\nrisk ending up in the hands of terrorists. Given the \r\nregional nature of the threats, Niger is determined to \r\nwork jointly with other countries, especially in our \r\nsubregion, to deal with the situation. The risk to the \r\nstability of the entire subregion, where some countries \r\nexperience recurrent rebellions, should not be \r\nunderestimated.  \r\n We hope that there will be a rapid solution to the \r\ncrisis, which would not just have a security impact on \r\nNiger, but also an economic and social impact, given \r\nthe work stoppage on the road construction that was \r\nbeing financed by Libya, the return from Libya of over \r\n210,000 migrant Niger nationals and the arrival of \r\nincreasing numbers of Libyan refugees fleeing the war. \r\nNiger is a democratic country, governed by the rule of \r\nlaw, and we will treat these refugees in compliance \r\nwith our laws and international law. Until now, our \r\ncountry, with very limited means, has been bearing this \r\nterrible burden alone. Our country therefore requires \r\nsupport and help from the international community in \r\nterms of both the security and the economic issues, as \r\nwe are on the frontlines of the war against terrorism.  \r\n Niger would also like to see a rapid return to \r\npeace and stability in this brotherly country and \r\nreconciliation among Libyans. We are concerned by the \r\nsituation, because the democratic institutions that our \r\ncountries are trying to build are still fragile. We are \r\nconcerned because the reality of widespread poverty \r\nprovides a breeding ground for terrorism.  \r\n My country, Niger, believes that, apart from \r\nimmediate security solutions, the strengthening of \r\ndemocratic institutions and economic and social \r\ndevelopment are the only ways to confine terrorism \r\nand guarantee peace. Democratic values are universal. \r\nIt has been decisively proven: there is no such thing as \r\nclimate determinism, which would condemn hot \r\ncountries to despotism and temperate countries to \r\ndemocracy. In understanding this, the world has made a \r\nquantum leap, convincing even those who would \r\nbelieve that the fight for democracy is simply a new \r\nversion of the mission to civilize, which was the \r\njustification for the colonialism of the past century \r\nbrought about by the alliance of the sword and the \r\ncenser.  \r\n As a Muslim, I would like to say that terrorism \r\nhas nothing to do with Islam. Islam has always \r\nemphasized fraternity and justice. It has always \r\nemphasized the intrinsic unity of all human beings and \r\ntheir equality, whatever their origins. Islam therefore \r\nproclaims that all men are equal like the teeth of a \r\ncomb in the hands of a weaver. Islam is a religion of \r\ntolerance.  \r\n  “I do not serve that which you serve, nor do \r\nyou serve Him Whom I serve: nor am I going to \r\nserve that which you serve, nor are you going to \r\nserve Him Whom I serve: you shall have your \r\nreligion and I shall have my religion.” (The Holy \r\nKoran, CIX: 2-6) \r\n A/66/PV.20\r\n \r\n19 11-51191 \r\n \r\n Those are the divine words, full of tolerance, \r\nfrom a sura of the Koran. Thus, terrorism has nothing \r\nto do with Islam, with real Islam, which is a religion of \r\nthe happy medium, and the fight against terrorism \r\nshould not be considered a religious conflict, a clash \r\nbetween two civilizations, a struggle between Judeo-\r\nChristian civilization and Muslim civilization, or a \r\nfight to the death between the Christian West and the \r\nMuslim East. The world must not return to the \r\nreligious wars of the Middle Ages. Quite the opposite, \r\nit should be able to integrate the values of two \r\ncivilizations that are, at their root, both from the same \r\narea, the Middle East. \r\n Climate change is another challenge that the \r\nworld is facing. Greenhouse gases are one of its causes. \r\nThe least developed poor countries, of which Niger is \r\nunfortunately a member, only produce 1 per cent of \r\nthose gases. We in Niger suffer from the effects of \r\nclimate change on a recurring basis. Indeed, our people \r\nlive off of subsistence agriculture and livestock-\r\nraising. Those two sectors, on which the poorest, in \r\nparticular women and children, rely, are very \r\nvulnerable to climate change. The droughts and floods \r\nin Niger over the past 10 years show, needless to say, a \r\ntrend towards a growing number of extreme weather \r\nevents.  \r\n In view of this, we decided to implement the \r\nThree Ns initiative, that is, “the people of Niger \r\nNourishing the people of Niger”. As we believe that \r\ndrought does not need to necessarily bring about \r\nfamine, we have decided to increase the yields of rain-\r\nfed agriculture, to promote irrigation, to modernize \r\nlivestock-raising methods and to implement a robust \r\npolicy of environmental protection. As we know that \r\nthe harvest this season will be poor, we have decided to \r\nimplement an emergency irrigation programme, to \r\nrebuild our food stocks and to alert the international \r\ncommunity to the situation. From this rostrum I renew \r\nmy country’s appeal to the international community for \r\naid for Niger, which, in addition to threats from the \r\nLibyan crisis, from terrorists and from criminal \r\norganizations of every kind, is also facing severe food \r\ninsecurity.  \r\n The terrible recurrent drought that Niger lives \r\nwith spurred our decision to restructure our economy. \r\nOur country has significant mineral resources — \r\nuranium, gold, coal, cement, which are already being \r\nmined, as well as oil, the first barrel of which will be \r\nproduced before the end of 2011. While the curse of \r\nmineral resources has had unfortunate results in other \r\ncountries, we will exploit our resources to the sole \r\nbenefit of the people of Niger. In accordance with the \r\nExtraction Industries Transparency Initiative, we mean \r\nto invest the profits to the benefit of the people of \r\nNiger, especially in agriculture, animal husbandry, \r\nenergy and transportation infrastructure, education, \r\nhealth and access to water. The resulting boost to our \r\neconomy will allow us to create tens of thousands of \r\njobs, especially for young people. Niger encourages \r\nprivate investment, especially foreign direct \r\ninvestment. Besides the legal protection we offer by \r\npromoting the rule of law, we have also just adopted a \r\nlaw on public-private partnerships in order to expedite \r\nfunding. \r\n We have the duty to create a fairer and more \r\nhumane world. To achieve that noble aim we need new \r\nglobal governance. That will require a profound reform \r\nof international organizations, in particular the United \r\nNations, the World Trade Organization, the \r\nInternational Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The \r\ndemocratization of those institutions is absolutely \r\nnecessary; it is a sine qua non condition for peace and \r\nstability in the world. For decisions to be accepted and \r\nimplemented by everyone, they must be taken in a \r\ncollaborative, participatory way. \r\n I would like to focus now on our great \r\nOrganization. The United Nations is at once a \r\npermanent space for political dialogue among the \r\ncountries we represent and a forum for the expression \r\nof the solidarity necessary among our peoples. It is also \r\nwhere we turn for the realization of our hopes. For all \r\nthose reasons, reform of the United Nations must \r\nproceed faster. Africa takes a common position on this \r\nissue, which my country shares. We deeply believe \r\nthat, given its worldwide mandate to deal with major \r\nissues like peace, security, development and human \r\nrights, the United Nations must be fair, representative \r\nand democratic. We believe in an ongoing \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly, the common \r\nforum that we all hold dear. We have no doubt that the \r\nPresident of the Assembly will move forward the \r\nprocess of democratizing the United Nations. The same \r\nis true of reform of the Security Council, which we all \r\nawait and which Africa has always called for, through \r\nits representatives, especially the Committee of Ten \r\nAfrican Ministers of Finance and Central Bank \r\nGovernors. \r\nA/66/PV.20  \r\n \r\n11-51191 20 \r\n \r\n Before concluding, I want to return to the theme \r\nof mediation. Our countries and the United Nations \r\nitself could increase their effectiveness in managing \r\nissues of peace, security and development if they \r\nsought resolution through mediation. The importance \r\nof the role of mediation in the peaceful settlement of \r\ndisputes is incontestable. In fact, it is an essential tool \r\nin the peaceful settlement of disputes, which the \r\nCharter itself recommends to States in Article 33. \r\n In Niger we have experienced the benefits of \r\nmediation, through the United Nations, the African \r\nUnion and the Economic Community of West African \r\nStates, in our recent political and institutional crisis. It \r\nis true that mediation can be tedious, but in the end it \r\nbears fruit. We endorse every effort that aims to \r\npromote peace through mediation, both in active and \r\npotential conflicts. We also encourage the Department \r\nof Political Affairs to keep the principle in mind in its \r\nwork. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Niger for the statement he \r\nhas just made. \r\n Mr. Mahamadou Issoufou, President of the \r\nRepublic of Niger, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\nAddress by Mr. Michel Joseph Martelly, President of \r\nthe Republic of Haiti \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nGeneral Assembly will now hear an address by the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Haiti. \r\n Mr. Michel Joseph Martelly, President of the \r\nRepublic of Haiti, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Michel Joseph Martelly, President of the Republic \r\nof Haiti, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Martelly (spoke in French): First of \r\nall, I would like to congratulate Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz \r\nAl-Nasser on his election as President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-sixth session. I also want to use \r\nthis occasion to commend the leadership of Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon and to laud the dynamism and \r\nwisdom he brings to the management of world affairs.  \r\n From this rostrum, I extend a brotherly welcome \r\nto our sister nation, South Sudan, which just \r\nproclaimed its independence on 9 July. We share in \r\ntheir pride, and we welcome them with great respect as \r\nthe 193rd Member State of the great family of the \r\nUnited Nations. On behalf of the Republic of Haiti, I \r\nsend warm congratulations and our hope that the \r\ncountry may enjoy peace, happiness and prosperity. I \r\nhonour the memory of those who died in the struggle \r\nbefore seeing the dawn of a new day shining in that \r\npart of the African continent. \r\n Speaking here today on behalf of Haiti, I join my \r\nvoice with those of all the Member States that, like us, \r\nhave known the heavy burden of post-disaster and \r\npost-conflict circumstances, in saying that even among \r\nthe weakest and most vulnerable hope lives on. They \r\ncarry the hope of rebirth, because they know that the \r\npre-crisis reality is no longer a possibility. They know \r\nthat change — change in their mentality and change in \r\ntheir political, economic and social affairs — must be \r\ntheir creed. They cannot afford not to change. In the \r\ncase of Haiti, it is precisely because an entire people \r\nwere firmly convinced of the need for change that I \r\nwas elected with a very clear mandate, namely, that of \r\nbringing about that change.  \r\n I am convinced that that leap in awareness that \r\nresulted from suffering is what will lead to a new \r\nglobal order. That was the case at the beginning of the \r\nnineteenth century, when Saint-Domingue broke its \r\nchains and brought about the birth of Haiti. It was the \r\ncase in 1945, when countries of good will, including \r\nHaiti, came together to bring about this body which \r\nbrings us together this week around noble ideals. It \r\nalso seems to be the case in the light of the political \r\nchanges affecting North Africa. \r\n In a country of the South where the human \r\ndevelopment index is still of concern, a major disaster \r\nunfortunately arises, the great question of \r\nresponsibility comes brutally to the fore again, whether \r\nthe responsibility be local in terms of governance, or \r\nwhether the responsibility lies with the global order. \r\nToday’s world and the United Nations in particular will \r\nbe more and more called upon, because those post-\r\ndisaster situations include both situations resulting \r\nfrom natural disasters and those of a passing nature or \r\nthose that are simply caused by human folly.  \r\n When on top of that, in some of those cases, all \r\nof these factors come together, the response must be \r\n A/66/PV.20\r\n \r\n21 11-51191 \r\n \r\nmore carefully designed, more responsible, more \r\ncoordinated, bolder and more determined.  \r\n I strongly believe that, first of all, it is for the \r\naffected countries to seek and find solutions, because \r\nany solution that is imposed from the outside, however \r\ngenerous it might be, will, in the medium term, only \r\nproduce adverse effects. It is up to the people of the \r\nSouth to determine how they use their wealth, their raw \r\nmaterials and their future. In the case of Haiti, I have to \r\nsay that the international community, through the \r\nUnited Nations, showed by supporting, six months \r\nafter the earthquake, presidential elections in a difficult \r\ncontext, that it understood the urgency. I would like to \r\nthank it for that. \r\n But I also strongly believe that it would be \r\nirresponsible for a country that has been hit by disaster \r\nto deny itself the assistance, expertise and cooperation \r\nof sisterly nations, whether they be from the emerging \r\nSouth or from the North, which is supposedly well-off. \r\n It is that balance, as I was saying, between \r\nmature governance and well-conceived international \r\nassistance that should be sought after and codified, \r\ngenuinely and without any embellishment. I would cite \r\nas an example the various peacekeeping and \r\nstabilization missions of the United Nations in \r\nnumerous places around the globe, including Haiti.  \r\n The same situation arises everywhere: a country \r\ninitially welcomes the missions, but in the medium \r\nterm, they lose steam. Why? Problems arise because \r\nthe expectations of the host country are excessive. \r\nFurthermore, missions cannot operate when they work \r\nunder inflexible terms of reference. That is to be \r\nregretted, because nothing would more irresponsible \r\nand dangerous than to let missions leave before an \r\neffective national alternative is in place.  \r\n In the case of Haiti, what would the United \r\nNations Mission have accomplished if today, suddenly \r\nand without any warning, it were to be withdrawn? Of \r\ncourse, I am aware of the fact that unacceptable errors \r\nhave been committed and have affected the prestige of \r\nthe Mission, but the trees must not be allowed to hide \r\nthe forest. I believe that political stabilization goes \r\nthrough a number of stages. It cannot be based simply \r\non an intervention force or a more or less neutral \r\nobserver presence. That would reflect a very simplified \r\nview of the primary role of the United Nations. \r\nStabilization is more than that. Thus, the Government \r\npolicy that I stand for consists of four main pillars: \r\neducation, employment, environment and the rule of \r\nlaw.  \r\n How can we build peace unless there is universal \r\nand free basic education in a country where there is \r\nmassive illiteracy? How can we promote sustainable \r\ndevelopment without high quality education that \r\npromotes citizen values, ensures gender equality, \r\nvalues cultural identity and openness to the world, and \r\nleads to tolerance? \r\n With respect to jobs, allow me to say that we can \r\ntalk as much as we like about human dignity and \r\nhuman rights, and about stabilization and peace, but an \r\nempty stomach is deaf to words. It is by creating \r\ndecent jobs that are properly paid and that respect the \r\nrights of vulnerable categories of people that justice \r\nbegins. It is by a fair distribution of the income from \r\nraw materials that we will stop smothering the \r\ncountries of the South and put an end to the speculation \r\nthat undermines democracy.  \r\n On these major themes, nations must come \r\ntogether and come still closer together. They must be \r\ncommitted to combating deforestation and climate \r\nchange. We must also seriously take into account the \r\nproblem of water. There will be no peace in the world \r\nas long as the living conditions of countries such as \r\nmine are so poor that they lead to natural disasters \r\nbecoming even more tragic, floods even worse, drought \r\neven more deadly and the rural exodus even more \r\nwidespread.  \r\n Stabilization today also means, above all, \r\nestablishing the rule of law, but the rule of law \r\nrequires, inter alia, an independent, responsible and \r\nstrong justice system. It also means the ongoing and \r\ndifficult but necessary establishment of strong \r\ninstitutions that are stronger than privilege and group \r\ninterest.  \r\n The world will become more beautiful when we \r\nstop talking about condemning or accusing people. \r\nHaiti has been witness to that fact. But Haiti can also \r\nsay that in post-disaster assistance, the disbursement of \r\nfunds that are not subject to inflexible, complex and \r\nclumsy red tape are those that are best adapted to \r\nneeds. Therefore, those procedures, even if they are \r\nsupported, allow the affected countries to take \r\nownership of the strategic initiatives concerning their \r\nfuture. Specifically, in terms of the resources made \r\navailable to the affected populations, it is also desirable \r\nA/66/PV.20  \r\n \r\n11-51191 22 \r\n \r\nthat pledges be followed up with action and that \r\nreconstruction projects be actually implemented.  \r\n In a word, I would say that it would be very sad \r\nto see the left hand taking back what the right hand had \r\ngiven. The temptation exists; it is the result of a \r\ndifficult global economic context. But, once again, \r\ntruth alone must prevail, because when reconstruction \r\nis left to wait, the long wait can lead to impatience and \r\nbring harm. In the case of Haiti, as in other post-\r\nconflict situations, the United Nations and friendly \r\nnations should come to our aid to help us to reconstruct \r\nmore than just a physical space, but reconstruct men \r\nand women, to whom we must give hope. Beyond \r\nconcepts and abstractions, this is above all a human \r\nstory. This is the new order we are here to speak of \r\ntoday: putting human beings back into the heart of the \r\ncentral debates of our time. This is the momentum in \r\nwhich we are caught up and which is shared by billions \r\nof people in the grip of disasters, forced exoduses, \r\nconflicts and epidemics.  \r\n In solidarity with those other victims, the Haitian \r\npeople wish to send a very clear message from the \r\nplatform of the United Nations. As long as there are \r\nmen and women of good will, there will be hope. As \r\nlong as there are nations united in solidarity, there will \r\nbe hope. We in Haiti have experienced every \r\nconceivable kind of catastrophe: every form of man-\r\nmade disaster and all the natural ones, aggravated by \r\nthe systematic, irresponsible destruction committed by \r\nhuman beings. We have known epidemics and hunger, \r\neven marginalization, but Haiti is now back on its feet, \r\nready to rebuild and ready for a new start. Nothing is \r\npredetermined. It is this new Haiti that is open to the \r\nworld, this new Haiti that is open to new investments \r\nand collaborations, to reconstruction, dialogue and \r\npeace. And it is this new Haiti that says thank you to \r\nall those assembled here.  \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Haiti for the statement he \r\nhas just made. \r\n Mr. Michel Joseph Martelly, President of the \r\nRepublic of Haiti, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n Mr. Zinsou (Benin), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\nAddress by Mr. Pierre Nkurunziza, President of the \r\nRepublic of Burundi \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Burundi.  \r\n Mr. Pierre Nkurunziza, President of the Republic \r\nof Burundi, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Pierre Nkurunziza, President of the Republic of \r\nBurundi, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Nkurunziza (spoke in French): I \r\nshould like, first of all, to associate myself with \r\nprevious speakers in congratulating the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-sixth session and the \r\nmembers of the Bureau for their election. We would \r\nalso like to thank the President of the sixty-fifth \r\nsession for his work in presiding over the Assembly \r\nlast year. \r\n We also take this opportunity to congratulate His \r\nExcellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his appointment to a \r\nsecond term as Secretary-General of the United \r\nNations. That reappointment is vivid testimony of his \r\nsuccesses in contributing to the promotion of \r\ninternational peace and security, human rights and \r\nsustainable development. \r\n The process of consolidating peace in Burundi, \r\nwith the support of the United Nations, led to the \r\nsuccessful organization of the 2010 elections through a \r\nprocess of consensus and thanks to an electoral code \r\nthat was published following consultations with all \r\nstakeholders. That spirit of dialogue in the process of \r\nconsolidating peace, also allowed our parliament to \r\nestablish an ombudsman position and an independent \r\nNational Human Rights Commission. This same \r\nprocess has allowed us to develop a second set of \r\ninstruments in our campaign against poverty, namely, \r\nthe law governing political parties, new property rights \r\ncodes, Burundi Vision 2025, a national strategy for \r\ndemocratic government, and the fight against \r\ncorruption. \r\n Genuine democracy now exists in Burundi. The \r\nexamples referred to earlier, along with maintaining \r\nchannels of communication, holding meetings with \r\ncivil society and the process of implementing \r\n A/66/PV.20\r\n \r\n23 11-51191 \r\n \r\ntransitional justice mechanisms, are all additional proof \r\nof this fact. Burundi has opened a dialogue with \r\neveryone. We can all note with satisfaction, then, that a \r\nnew chapter has been opened in the history of Burundi. \r\n Democratically elected institutions have led to \r\npeace for the first time. The people have decided what \r\nshould be done, and there has been a peaceful transfer \r\nof power. I pay tribute to the people of Burundi for \r\nbeing able to break with the tragic habits of the past, in \r\nwhich the outcome of elections was not respected. \r\nToday, the institutions that have been established are \r\nlegitimate and have the constitutional duty to protect \r\nthe people, ensure the stability of the country and \r\npromote development. \r\n Let us, however, have no illusions. There is still \r\ninsecurity in the aftermath of the socio-economic \r\nreinsertion of former combatants. There are also \r\nongoing problems with the transitional regime, along \r\nwith a temporary decline in the economic situation of \r\nour people, which is traceable to problems in \r\nagriculture, climate change and a spike in prices \r\ngenerally and oil. \r\n We should not forget the fact that Burundi is a \r\npost-conflict country. In that connection, we are \r\npleased by the surrender of more than 80,000 weapons, \r\nwhich people have handed over. Furthermore, a \r\ndisarmament commission has been established and the \r\nnational police have begun to scout for weapons and \r\nconfiscate them from criminals.  \r\n In the area of development, Burundi is continuing \r\nits efforts to achieve the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. The number of children is rising, as is that for \r\nteachers, because primary education is now free. We \r\nhave undertaken a number of reforms to train our \r\nyoung people for employment. The Government has \r\nundertaken to bring together people in villages so as to \r\nensure the provision of basic services such as drinking \r\nwater, energy, health care, schools and decent housing, \r\nwhich facilitates reconciliation, security and job \r\ncreation. This is in addition to free health care for \r\nchildren aged 5 and under and for pregnant women and \r\nwomen who give birth in public health clinics.  \r\n To that end, community-level endeavours have \r\nenabled us to build more than 2,024 schools and more \r\nthan 80 health centres and set up more than \r\n2,000 pumps for the provision of drinking water — all \r\nof this in three years and without any external \r\nassistance. \r\n Numerous development efforts are being \r\nundertaken in several key national sectors aimed at \r\nenhancing the lives of our people, taking advantage of \r\nthe integration of Burundi into the East African \r\ncommunity. \r\n We regret the continuing security-related \r\nincidents caused by armed bandits, land conflicts and \r\nthe presence of negative forces in certain areas of the \r\nGreat Lakes region. We were shocked by the terrible \r\ntragedy that took place in Gatumba on 18 September \r\n2011. On that dark night, a bloody attack took place in \r\na nightclub that caused the deaths of about 40 people — \r\nchildren, young people, elderly people — of all ethnic \r\ngroups, genders and political leanings.  \r\n The Government reached out to the suffering \r\npeople, paying the costs of the funerals and attending \r\nthem. The Government also decided to provide \r\ntreatment for all those who were injured during the \r\ntragedy, and a three-day period of mourning was \r\nannounced and observed. \r\n We strongly condemn that heinous attack and \r\nhave called for an inquiry, which should be concluded \r\nwithin a month. Thanks to genuine cooperation on the \r\npart of the people, who, having demonstrated \r\nconsiderable restraint, denounced those who allegedly \r\nplanned and carried out the attack, we are pleased to \r\nsay that we have made progress in the investigations.  \r\n This is yet a further reflection of the commitment \r\nof the people of Burundi to peace, which should \r\nreassure everyone with regard to the viability and \r\nstability of Burundi. That act, while it calls for further \r\nvigilance on the part of us all, should not be considered \r\nto reflect the current state of our country; if should be \r\nseen as an act of terrorism — an isolated incident \r\nwithin the overall context of peace in our country. Such \r\nacts of terrorism, massacres and crimes against \r\nhumanity are, unfortunately, being carried out in a \r\nnumber of countries, which makes it incumbent upon \r\nall of us firmly to combat them and bring their \r\nperpetrators to justice. \r\n We call on the international community to \r\nunreservedly condemn this heinous act and to assist us \r\nin prosecuting the masterminds and their henchmen. \r\nWe call also on the international community to support \r\nthe operationalization of the National Independent \r\nHuman Rights Commission that, in a positive step, was \r\nrecently established in Burundi. \r\nA/66/PV.20  \r\n \r\n11-51191 24 \r\n \r\n We take this opportunity also to note that \r\ninvestigation commissions are at work to shed light on \r\nthe assassinations that have taken place in various parts \r\nof the country. We hope that the truth about these \r\nevents will soon be known and those responsible will \r\nbe brought to justice. \r\n Our domestic situation is satisfactory, but we \r\ncannot but be aware of regional and international \r\nconcerns. Thus the situation in Somalia, in which \r\nBurundi is deeply involved through its participation in \r\nthe African Union Mission in Somalia, requires \r\nadditional partners in order for the country to be \r\nstabilized and prepared for elections. Those efforts \r\nshould be carried out in the context of international \r\nmeasures to combat terrorism and also to ensure food \r\nsecurity.  \r\n In order to be successful in the combat against \r\nterrorism, global governance must be able to meet that \r\nchallenge. There is therefore an urgent need for reform \r\nof the Security Council and ongoing interaction \r\nbetween the Council and the General Assembly on all \r\nissues of global interest. \r\n Before closing, we would like to congratulate \r\nSouth Sudan on having joined the family of nations, \r\nand we support the resolve of the Sudan and of South \r\nSudan to seek ways to peacefully settlement post-\r\nreferendum issues.  \r\n We would like to close by calling on the \r\nAssembly to speed up the quest to find a balance \r\nbetween development and the survival of our planet. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Burundi for the statement \r\nhe has just made. \r\n Mr. Pierre Nkurunziza, President of the Republic \r\nof Burundi, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.  \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Emanuel Mori, President and Head \r\nof Government of the Federated States of Micronesia  \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President \r\nand Head of Government of the Federated States of \r\nMicronesia. \r\n Mr. Emanuel Mori, President and Head of \r\nGovernment of the Federated States of \r\nMicronesia, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Emanuel Mori, President and Head of Government \r\nof the Federated States of Micronesia, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly.  \r\n President Mori: Let me begin by extending my \r\nwarm congratulations to Mr. Al-Nasser as President of \r\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. His \r\nstrong leadership will continue the high standard set by \r\nhis predecessor. I wish also to express to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral my deepest appreciation for his many \r\ncontributions and accomplishments, one of which is his \r\nrecent visit to the South Pacific island countries. I \r\ncongratulate him and wish him well in his second term. \r\n Last July, the Security Council took a giant step \r\nwith the adoption of a presidential statement \r\n(S/PRST/2011/15) during its debate on the issue of \r\nclimate change and its security implications. We were \r\nencouraged by that bold step. \r\n As a member of the Pacific small island \r\ndeveloping States (SIDS), we appreciate the \r\nunprecedented action taken by the Security Council as \r\nwe continue to face the threat to our existence and the \r\nloss of territorial integrity and sovereignty resulting \r\nfrom the adverse impacts of climate change and sea-\r\nlevel rise. The concerns expressed by the Council in \r\nconnection with climate change, in particular \r\nconcerning sea-level rise as a security threat, is an \r\nimportant step. \r\n We cannot but notice, however, the persistent \r\nfailure and reluctance by some countries to address the \r\nsecurity aspect of climate change, even in the face of \r\noverwhelming scientific evidence. We believe that \r\nthose who opposed the debate in the Council and those \r\nwho doubted the security implications of climate \r\nchange simply ignored the obvious.  \r\n We respectfully ask those members who opposed \r\nthe debate and those who are still in doubt to fulfil \r\ntheir responsibilities under the Charter of the United \r\nNations. We also take note of the positions of those \r\nwho aspire to membership in the Council, and we \r\nthank those countries who supported our cause. I \r\nstrongly urge the Security Council, and for that matter \r\nthe whole United Nations system, to utilize innovative \r\n A/66/PV.20\r\n \r\n25 11-51191 \r\n \r\nways to address the concerns of the most vulnerable \r\nMembers of this Organization. \r\n We are grateful for the historic visit by Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon to our region on the fortieth \r\nanniversary of the Pacific Islands Forum. It was also \r\nthe first time in the 66-year history of this body that a \r\nSecretary-General has ever visited any Pacific small \r\nisland developing State — on this occasion, Kiribati \r\nand the Solomon Islands. We are confident that the \r\nSecretary-General’s visit will give a greater sense of \r\nurgency to the issue of climate change. \r\n Climate change is no longer a hypothetical issue \r\nbut a real tragedy, as we in the Pacific region are \r\nalready experiencing its adverse effects. These impacts \r\nwill continue to worsen until countries like mine \r\ndisappear, unless immediate and decisive actions are \r\ntaken by this body to mitigate climate change at first \r\nevidence.  \r\n It is imperative that we immediately begin to \r\nreduce emissions of long-lasting greenhouse gases like \r\ncarbon dioxide. We must complement the action on \r\ncarbon dioxide by reducing short-lived climate forcers \r\nsuch as black carbon, methane, tropospheric ozone and \r\nhydrofluorocarbons in order to prevent an additional \r\nincrease of as much as one degree Celsius in global \r\nwarming over the next decades. Reducing these short-\r\nlived agents is one of the surest ways to protect some \r\nof the Earth’s most vulnerable regions such as the \r\nFederated States of Micronesia. \r\n I therefore call upon the international community \r\nto join this strategic approach to meeting the challenge \r\nof climate change. The time to act is now. \r\n More than 60 years ago, my island country, the \r\nFederated States of Micronesia, drew world attention \r\nas a battleground in the Pacific conflict. Today, the \r\nremnants of approximately 60 shipwrecks from that \r\nconflict are posing threats to the lives of our people, \r\nour environment and the marine ecosystem. \r\nApproximately 32 million litres of oil contained in the \r\nbellies of the wrecks are a ticking environmental time \r\nbomb. Leading experts on underwater corrosion have \r\nwarned that the shipwrecks will collapse, and when \r\nthey do, we believe that oil from these wrecks could \r\ncreate a spill on a massive scale, with an impact \r\ncomparable to the disaster last year in the Gulf of \r\nMexico. \r\n Oil from these shipwrecks in my state of Chuuk \r\nhas already started leaking. Any disaster could have a \r\ndevastating effect on the environment, our food chain \r\nand the surrounding reefs that serve as breeding \r\ngrounds for many fish species. It would also adversely \r\nimpact our tourism industry, which depends largely on \r\ncoral and shipwreck diving. Thus to avoid a major \r\nenvironmental disaster, I am now appealing to the \r\ninternational community for immediate assistance. \r\n Twenty years ago my country gained membership \r\nin the Organization, just in time to become a part of the \r\nmovement known as the Rio process. Out of that \r\nprocess, the principle of sustainability became a \r\nmandate for development. For the United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20), \r\nMicronesia and other small island developing States \r\nhave been calling for recognition of what we term the \r\n“blue economy”. As island nations with millions of \r\nsquare miles of the blue Pacific, we naturally have \r\nparticular affinity and concerns for the ocean. \r\n Our ocean’s resources have enormous strategic \r\nvalue. We depend on them for our subsistence living \r\nand cultural identity as seafarers of the Pacific. The \r\nblue Pacific has opened up new horizons in sustainable \r\neconomic development activities. As custodian of these \r\nresources, we welcome the participation of our partners \r\nin the utilization of these resources, but for too long we \r\nhave not received an equitable and fair share of our \r\nocean bounties. \r\n The development of our ocean resources is \r\nseverely hampered by the continuous selfish \r\nbehaviours of illegal, unreported and unregulated \r\nfishing. If unabated, these kinds of behaviour will \r\ncontinue to deprive our people and our nascent fishing \r\nindustries of millions of dollars in revenues every year. \r\nThe fishing industry is further adversely affected by \r\nocean acidification caused by climate change. \r\n Conservation and sustainable management of \r\noceanic resources is important, because we will \r\ncontinue to depend on the ocean in the years ahead. It \r\nis for that reason that we have committed to various \r\nconservation activities in the Micronesian region. One \r\nin particular is our support for the establishment of \r\nshark sanctuaries. The Federated States of Micronesia \r\nhas joined Palau and other countries in committing a \r\nvast area in our Micronesian region to be a sanctuary \r\nfor sharks. \r\nA/66/PV.20  \r\n \r\n11-51191 26 \r\n \r\n The current mechanisms for follow-up on the \r\nimplementation of the Barbados Programme of Action \r\nand the Mauritius Strategy for Further Implementation \r\nare unlikely to provide the momentum necessary to \r\ntake concrete steps as part of a results-oriented \r\napproach. New and additional measures to address the \r\nunique and particular vulnerabilities and development \r\nof SIDS are required. \r\n Along with the Pacific SIDS, we are advancing a \r\nproposal for Rio+20 to consider a third Global \r\nConference on the Sustainable Development of SIDS. \r\nWe must build upon the momentum of Rio+20 to \r\nconvene a third Global Conference to refocus and \r\ndevelop new and additional measures that are results-\r\noriented to support the sustainable development of \r\nSIDS. \r\n A special category for small island developing \r\nStates is imperative if the United Nations is to improve \r\nthe lot of the disadvantaged peoples of SIDS. After all, \r\nrealities demand it. I therefore reiterate the call made \r\nlast year by my own country and other small island \r\ndeveloping States for the creation of that special \r\ncategory. \r\n I am grateful for the attention paid by the United \r\nNations High-level Meeting on Non-communicable \r\nDiseases (NCDs) held earlier in the week. \r\n It is a major concern for us in the Pacific SIDS \r\nthat non-communicable diseases have reached \r\nepidemic proportions. If allowed to continue unabated, \r\nNCDs could potentially undermine our labour supply, \r\nproductivity, investment and education, with \r\ndevastating consequences for our economic \r\ndevelopment. I echo the sentiments on NCDs expressed \r\nby Pacific leaders regarding the importance of \r\nimmediate and decisive actions by Governments, the \r\nprivate sector, civil society, regional and international \r\norganizations and development partners to work \r\ntogether to address what is now a human, social and \r\neconomic crisis for us in the Pacific. \r\n At the beginning of the current session, we \r\nwitnessed history of another kind unfolding in the Hall. \r\nFor the first time, a female President stood at this \r\npodium to open the general debate. I join other world \r\nleaders in congratulating Her Excellency Ms. Dilma \r\nRousseff of Brazil on her many achievements. The \r\nchallenge for this body is to continue to encourage \r\nwomen from all nations to participate on an equal basis \r\nat all levels of political decision-making processes. \r\nAfter all, women are equal partners in families. \r\n In joining the debate on the Israeli-Palestinian \r\nissue, my country urges the international community to \r\nremain steadfast in upholding the principles of peaceful \r\ncoexistence as enshrined in the United Nations Charter. \r\nWe continue to support Israel’s right to live within \r\nsecure and recognized borders, free from the fear of \r\nterrorism. We also acknowledge Palestine’s right to \r\nstatehood, which can be achieved only through a \r\nnegotiated settlement between the two parties. I agree \r\nwith President Obama that there are no shortcuts to \r\nsolving this problem. \r\n Just halfway into the year, people everywhere are \r\nexperiencing the impact of natural disasters, making it \r\nthe costliest year on record. They have caused not only \r\nproperty damage but also the loss of human lives. I \r\nwant to extend my people’s sincere sympathies for the \r\nlives lost and the suffering everywhere. \r\n On the twentieth anniversary of my country’s \r\nadmission to the United Nations, we pledge to do our \r\nbest to support the goals of this Organization for the \r\nbenefit of our people and all peoples around the world. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident and Head of Government of the Federated \r\nStates of Micronesia for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\n Mr. Emanuel Mori, President and Head of \r\nGovernment of the Federated States of \r\nMicronesia, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Ikililou Dhoinine, President of the \r\nUnion of the Comoros \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Union of the Comoros. \r\n Mr. Ikililou Dhoinine, President of the Union of \r\nthe Comoros, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Ikililou Dhoinine, President of the Union of the \r\nComoros, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n A/66/PV.20\r\n \r\n27 11-51191 \r\n \r\n President Dhoinine (spoke in French): It is a \r\ngreat honour and a privilege for me to address this \r\nAssembly for the first time since I took office as \r\nPresident of the Union of the Comoros, on 26 May.  \r\n Allow me at the outset to warmly congratulate \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on his \r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-sixth session. I wish also to congratulate His \r\nExcellency Mr. Joseph Deiss and his entire team on \r\ntheir remarkable work. Lastly, I should like to pay a \r\nwell-deserved tribute to the Secretary-General, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his commendable \r\nand unceasing efforts to ensure that our Organization \r\ncan better meet its objectives in a world increasingly \r\nmarked by all kinds of crises: political, economic, \r\nsocial and environmental. \r\n The Assembly is convening in its sixty-sixth \r\nsession at a time when all humankind is struggling \r\nthrough one of its most difficult times. Indeed, peace, \r\nthe most precious common good in the world, has \r\nnever been more threatened. It is under threat on all of \r\nour continents, in our regions, in our subregions and in \r\nevery one of our countries. It is threatened by political \r\ncrises, diseases and natural disasters. It is also \r\nthreatened by poor living conditions, unemployment, \r\ninsecurity and underdevelopment. \r\n The hotspots that have emerged in various \r\nregions of the world and the recent uprisings in North \r\nAfrica and the Middle East have claimed, and continue \r\nto claim, many victims. Our countries continue to be \r\nburdened by emerging diseases, but also and especially \r\nby non-communicable diseases. In fact, cancers, \r\ndiabetes and, in particular, cardiovascular diseases \r\nhave taken many lives in our countries and threaten \r\ntheir development.  \r\n The problem of education and the lack of basic \r\ninfrastructure, energy and potable water also pose a \r\nthreat to peace and security in many developing \r\ncountries. Moreover, no country today is safe from \r\nnatural disasters linked to climate change. This \r\nsituation is all the more tragic in small island \r\ndeveloping States such as mine. \r\n I need not mention the toxic effects of the \r\nfinancial crisis, which continues to affect our countries \r\nand seriously compromises the future of the global \r\neconomy. Therefore, I should like to issue an urgent \r\nappeal to the international community to enhance its \r\nrole in seeking rapid resolutions of all of these crises. \r\n Indeed, only by working together and effectively \r\nto fight disease will we be able to ensure that our \r\npopulations are healthy and our human resources are \r\nmore productive. By joining our efforts, we may also \r\ncurb unemployment through education and job creation \r\nand succeed in re-launching the socio-economic \r\ndevelopment of our countries. In addition, eradicating \r\ncorruption — which is increasingly rampant in our \r\ncountries — will help us succeed in re-launching \r\ndevelopment, which is an essential factor of peace and \r\nstability. Moreover, by strengthening the culture of \r\ndemocracy and rule of law, our countries will evolve \r\ntowards greater peace and stability, which are key \r\nconditions for sustainable development.  \r\n The President took the Chair.  \r\n We must further develop solidarity among the \r\nmember countries of this concert of nations. That must \r\nbe done to bring our world out of its vulnerable state. \r\nThe efforts of the developing countries in increasingly \r\ndifficult situations will not succeed without active \r\nsolidarity. The quasi-collective mobilization effort seen \r\ntoday in Europe and generally in the West to stem the \r\nfinancial crisis is most commendable. However, it must \r\nbe extended to other sectors and continents. Likewise, \r\nit is indeed appropriate to act swiftly and in unison to \r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals, which \r\nhave inspired so much hope in our countries.  \r\n In this world in crisis, the Union of the Comoros \r\nhas for the second time experienced an exemplary, \r\npeaceful change at the top level of the State. However, \r\nits solid footing in democracy and good governance \r\nwill become truly irreversible only when poverty, \r\nmisery and vulnerability cease to exist. That is why we \r\nhave taken measures to fight corruption and to better \r\nuse our national resources and preserve and protect \r\nbiodiversity. Indeed, as a small island developing State \r\nthat is directly concerned, we attach very special \r\nattention to the question of climate change and the \r\nenvironment. We work every day to improve the \r\nstandard of living of our fellow citizens. But we also \r\nneed the support of the international community. \r\n In addition, and despite its difficult situation, my \r\ncountry will never set aside its responsibility to act \r\nwithin the international community. We intend to offer \r\nour modest contribution to mankind’s quest for a better \r\nworld. Thus we take an active part in building peace \r\nand security by participating in the Eastern Africa \r\nStandby Brigade, in accordance with the requests of \r\nA/66/PV.20  \r\n \r\n11-51191 28 \r\n \r\nthe international community. While we are aware that \r\nour means are modest, we intend to play our role \r\nwithin the African Union-United Nations Hybrid \r\nOperation in Darfur, because promoting peace \r\nanywhere in the world, particularly in Africa, remains \r\nfor us a major imperative. \r\n Terrorism, piracy and other transborder organized \r\ncrime, including the trafficking of drugs and light \r\nweapons, are direct threats today to human security and \r\nto the national security of many countries. My country \r\nis doing its best to combat those scourges. But the \r\ninternational community must also provide greater \r\nassistance towards prevention, both structurally and \r\noperationally. Early warning mechanisms, exchanges \r\nof information and experiences, mutual assistance in \r\ntraining, organization and capacity-building will enable \r\nStates and regional organizations, particularly the \r\nAfrican Union, to enhance their capacities. \r\n Issues that have remained unresolved, sometimes \r\nfor decades, are sources of conflicts likely to \r\njeopardize the cause of peace and security. That is the \r\ncase in the question of Madagascar. The political crisis \r\naffecting the brotherly people of Madagascar deserves \r\nthe full attention of the international community. The \r\ncurrent efforts of the transitional Government, under \r\nthe aegis of the Southern African Development \r\nCommunity, call for multiform support from the \r\ninternational community so that that large island can \r\nfinally regain peace and security for the well-being of \r\nits people. \r\n The same is true with regard to the question of \r\nPalestine. The Comoros has always supported the \r\nstruggle of the brotherly Palestinian people and \r\nsupports the request of the Palestinian authorities to the \r\ninternational community for the recognition of a \r\nPalestinian State in its borders of June 1967, with East \r\nJerusalem as its capital. Indeed, for more than 30 years \r\nIsrael’s occupation of Palestinian lands has remained \r\nan unresolved issue. As for my country, it supports that \r\nrecognition and appeals to all countries that love peace, \r\nfreedom and justice to do the same. \r\n The Union of the Comoros cannot have any other \r\nposition on that question, since it is directly concerned \r\nby another equally sensitive question that affects not \r\nonly its national unity, territorial integrity and history, \r\nand international law, but also peace in the Indian \r\nOcean region. Here I refer to the question of the \r\nComorian island of Mayotte.  \r\n Allow me to emphasize that the inclusion of the \r\nquestion of the Comorian island of Mayotte on the \r\nagenda of several sessions of the General Assembly \r\nand in relevant resolutions of the Assembly, the African \r\nUnion, the League of Arab States and the Organization \r\nof Islamic Cooperation has not yet provided a solution \r\nto this thorny question, which has placed us in \r\nopposition to France for decades.  \r\n As the Assembly is aware, the unilateral decision \r\nof France to make the Comorian island of Mayotte a \r\ndépartement is for us and for the international \r\ncommunity null and void and can in no way be \r\nconsidered a fait accompli. Furthermore, the visa \r\nregime imposed by the French authorities on \r\nComorians of the three other islands has broken up \r\nmany families by turning the sea channel that separates \r\nMayotte from its sister island Anjouan into a huge \r\ncemetery, where rest the remains of thousands of my \r\ncompatriots who only wished to gain access to a part of \r\ntheir territory. \r\n However, we cannot simply continue to condemn \r\nwithout any follow-up, or maintain fixed positions that \r\ndo not contribute to the settlement of the issue, while \r\nwe continue daily to witness many losses due to the \r\nvisa regime imposed by France. \r\n Therefore, I wish to reiterate from this rostrum \r\nmy country’s legitimate determination to continue to \r\nclaim the reintegration of the Comorian island of \r\nMayotte as part of its natural grouping. However, we \r\nhope to be able to conduct this struggle by means of \r\nthe necessary negotiations with France — an economic \r\npartner of the Comoros — but also and above all \r\nthrough including our brothers and sisters in Mayotte, \r\nbecause there can be no realistic and lasting solution to \r\nthe dispute without their involvement. \r\n That is the new approach that I proposed as soon \r\nas I was inaugurated to settle the territorial conflict that \r\nhas divided my country and France for just over \r\n30 years. Indeed, I believe that any search for a \r\nsolution to this thorny problem must include our \r\nMahorais brothers and sisters, with whom we share ties \r\nknitted through history, blood, language, religion and \r\nculture. We believe that the large Comorian diaspora in \r\nFrance and the island of Réunion can join with its \r\nbrothers and sisters of Mayotte and the other three \r\nComorian islands in order finally to renew their natural \r\nbonds, carry out projects and live out their common \r\ndestiny in harmony. \r\n A/66/PV.20\r\n \r\n29 11-51191 \r\n \r\n In this light, and in our desire to see this problem — \r\nwhich has lasted too long — be finally settled \r\nfavourably and peacefully, that we hope to promote the \r\nnegotiations with France and our Mahorais brothers \r\nand sisters that we believe to be essential.  \r\n Speaking of territorial integrity, I would like to \r\nmake particular mention of countries that occupy a \r\nspecial place in Comorians’ hearts. For the Kingdom of \r\nMorocco, a brother country whose legitimate positions \r\non the Western Sahara my country has always \r\nsupported, I hope that the dialogue being held under \r\nthe auspices of the United Nations will quickly lead to \r\na peaceful solution to the problem. To the People’s \r\nRepublic of China, that great country and friend to the \r\nComoros, we here reaffirm our unfailing support for it \r\nin its legitimate struggle for one China, developing in \r\npeace and prosperity. \r\n I cannot speak of justice and equity without \r\nbringing up the need for internal reform of our \r\nOrganization, particularly the Security Council. We \r\nbelieve that only better representation of every \r\ncontinent on the Council, including the essential \r\nAfrican presence as a permanent member, can ensure \r\nbetter cohesion within the international community and \r\nthus do away with frustration and antagonism. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to thank all the \r\nfriendly countries and the regional and international \r\norganizations that continue to support us in multiple \r\nways in our efforts to re-launch our country’s \r\nsocio-economic development. In particular, I thank \r\nQatar, which hosted the conference on assistance in \r\ninvestment and development in the Comoros, the \r\ncommitments for which have begun to materialize, \r\nthanks to the untiring efforts of high-level Qatari \r\nauthorities. I would also like to thank the American \r\nAdministration for its kind efforts to make our stay in \r\nthis great and beautiful country enjoyable. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Union of \r\nthe Comoros for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Ikililou Dhoinine, President of the Union of \r\nthe Comoros, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Anote Tong, President, Head of \r\nGovernment and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the \r\nRepublic of Kiribati  \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President, Head of Government and \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of \r\nKiribati. \r\n Mr. Anote Tong, President, Head of Government \r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic \r\nof Kiribati, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Anote Tong, President, \r\nHead of Government and Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof the Republic of Kiribati, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly. \r\n President Tong: I bring warm greetings from the \r\npeople of Kiribati, on whose behalf I address the \r\nAssembly. I wish to join previous speakers in \r\ncongratulating you, Mr. President, on your election to \r\nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-\r\nsixth session.  \r\n We gather here every year as world leaders to \r\nrepresent our peoples and to discuss issues of concern \r\nto the global community. At this session our theme is \r\nthe role of mediation in the settlement of disputes by \r\npeaceful means, which is appropriate in its reminder to \r\nus that peace and security are indeed crucial to the \r\ncontinued harmonious existence of mankind on this \r\nplanet. \r\n As a global community we constantly face many \r\nchallenges to our political, social and economic \r\nstability. Natural and human-induced disasters have \r\ncaused much suffering in different regions of the \r\nworld. Countries and peoples are facing all kinds of \r\nsecurity threats from armed conflicts, terrorism, human \r\ntrafficking, economic recession, climate change and its \r\nassociated impacts. As a result, many communities \r\nsuffer daily from increasing poverty, hunger and \r\ndislocation. \r\n But how can all this be happening in a \r\nsupposedly rational world community under the \r\nscrutiny of this global body? Is our existing \r\nOrganization in its current form equipped to deal with \r\nthese emerging issues, or is it time to review the \r\nstructure and effectiveness of our international \r\ngovernance system?  \r\n The lack of progress on climate change \r\nnegotiations clearly demonstrates the wide divergence \r\nA/66/PV.20  \r\n \r\n11-51191 30 \r\n \r\nof positions on the issue. I believe that unless we can \r\napproach any mediation with trust and commitment, \r\nwe will be caught in the vicious circle of starting with \r\nour differences, in our obsession to protect what we \r\nperceive to be our critical national interests. \r\n I would like to thank the Secretary-General for \r\nhis comments based on his experience during his recent \r\nvisit to Kiribati. His views are those of an independent \r\nobserver who came, who saw and who believed. His \r\ncomments are a powerful endorsement of what we, the \r\nmost vulnerable countries, have been saying over the \r\nyears, and my hope is that this will communicate the \r\nneed for urgent action to all who possess a sense of \r\nmoral responsibility. Climate change will remain the \r\ncurse of our planet. Most nations perceive it to be a \r\nfuture event, but for the very few it is already reaching \r\ndisastrous levels. \r\n Some will argue that climate change does not fall \r\nwithin the conventional definition of a security threat, \r\nbut that is simply because it may not be so for them at \r\nthis point in time. In Kiribati, many young people go to \r\nsleep each night fearing what may happen to their \r\nhomes overnight, especially during very high tides. \r\nThe accelerated and continued erosion of our shoreline \r\nis destroying settlements, and as I speak, some \r\ncommunities are relocating on the island. I was glad \r\nthat the Secretary-General was able to understand and \r\nfeel for himself the sense of threat that our people and \r\nthose of similarly vulnerable countries experience on a \r\ndaily basis. \r\n In the international climate-change forums there \r\nis ongoing dialogue and negotiation in an attempt to \r\nfind amicable solutions to this threat. But there is an \r\nongoing disagreement on how to address this global \r\nchallenge. The question is: how much longer must we \r\ncontinue to argue about this? When are we going to do \r\nsomething about it? Our people and our children, \r\nwhose lives and future are under serious threat, look to \r\nus for leadership. The urgency of the need for action \r\ncannot be overemphasized.  \r\n At Cancún, it was my understanding that there \r\nwas agreement on the need for an urgent package to \r\naddress the situation of the most vulnerable countries, \r\nwhich are now being seriously affected by the adverse \r\nimpacts of climate change. Next year, we will gather \r\nagain as world leaders to take stock of what we have \r\ndone since the Rio Summit in 1992. It is my fervent \r\nhope that, in the light of current scientific evidence and \r\nbased on the experiences of the most vulnerable \r\ncountries, we as a global community will embark on \r\nbold and innovative initiatives to address the climate \r\nchange challenge. I acknowledge with gratitude the \r\nadoption of resolutions 63/281 and 65/159 on the \r\npossible security implications of climate change and \r\nthe protection of our global climate for present and \r\nfuture generations. And I thank those who saw and \r\nsupported the need to classify climate change as a \r\nsecurity issue. \r\n In December, there will be another United \r\nNations Climate Change Conference in Durban. I \r\nacknowledge that climate change negotiations will take \r\nseveral years to conclude, but I also believe that there \r\nis common ground on which there is no real debate. \r\nThe urgent need for the flow of adaptation funds to \r\naddress the more urgent adaptation needs of the most \r\nvulnerable countries is a matter on which I believe \r\nthere is general consensus. But what is the point in \r\nconsensus if no concrete action follows? Kiribati was \r\none of the countries that did not sign the Copenhagen \r\nAccord because of what we saw as its serious \r\nshortcomings, but we were subsequently persuaded to \r\nassociate ourselves with it on the premise that doing so \r\nwould trigger the flow of much-needed adaptation \r\nfunds that had been pledged. Today, we continue to \r\nawait those funds. \r\n We all want to achieve sustainable development. \r\nWe are grateful to those who have continued to assist \r\nand partner with us on this journey, but our efforts at \r\nachieving sustainable growth will continue to be \r\nfrustrated by external factors. Ongoing uncertainty in \r\nthe global economic climate and rising food and fuel \r\nprices remain major challenges to our sustainable \r\ndevelopment efforts. On top of all that, our increasing \r\npreoccupation with the impacts of climate change will \r\nprogressively dominate our national agenda.  \r\n It is no surprise, therefore, that we continue to be \r\noff track in the achievement of most of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and the implementation of our \r\nsustainable development agenda under our national \r\ndevelopment plan. Every step we take forward we are \r\nknocked back two or three due to the many challenges \r\nwe face. It is therefore imperative that climate change \r\nadaptation funds be mobilized at the earliest \r\nopportunity. Otherwise, we will be forced to divert \r\ndevelopment resources towards the most urgent \r\nadaptation needs. Therefore, as we move towards \r\nDurban, it is our hope that the Green Climate Fund can \r\n A/66/PV.20\r\n \r\n31 11-51191 \r\n \r\nbe operationalized as soon as possible to allow the \r\nmost vulnerable countries to attend to their adaptation \r\nneeds from new resources. \r\n In the same vein, we believe that all nations and \r\npeoples — including Taiwan — that play a role in \r\ninternational affairs, including contributing to climate \r\nchange, should also be part of the solution. During \r\nthese difficult times, and facing challenges to our \r\nexisting world order, we can ill afford to isolate any \r\nnation that has the capacity to assist in our struggles.  \r\n I believe that, as a global community, we must be \r\nunited in our efforts to address any security threat to \r\ninternational peace and security, be it within States or \r\nbetween States. We need to forge consensus in our \r\ncollective action to promote and maintain our \r\ncollective security. Let us work together as a global \r\ncommunity to address the many conflicts and disputes \r\nthat are posing serious security challenges to our well-\r\nbeing, before they consume and condemn our \r\ncivilization to oblivion. \r\n In closing, I share our traditional blessing of \r\nhealth, peace and prosperity. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly I wish to thank the President, Head of \r\nGovernment and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the \r\nRepublic of Kiribati for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Anote Tong, President, Head of Government \r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic \r\nof Kiribati, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Andry Nirina Rajoelina, President  \r\nof the High Transitional Authority of the Republic  \r\nof Madagascar \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the High Transitional \r\nAuthority of the Republic of Madagascar. \r\n Mr. Andry Nirina Rajoelina, President of the \r\nHigh Transitional Authority of the Republic of \r\nMadagascar, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Andry Nirina Rajoelina, \r\nPresident of the High Transitional Authority of the \r\nRepublic of Madagascar, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly. \r\n President Rajoelina (spoke in French): After \r\nthree years of political crisis and a three-year absence, \r\nMadagascar is proud today to resume its place here in \r\nthe community of nations. On behalf of my fellow \r\ncountrymen, I am particularly honoured to participate \r\nin this general debate under the theme “The role of \r\nmediation in the settlements of disputes by peaceful \r\nmeans”. \r\n The successive crises around the world, most \r\nrecently in North Africa, demonstrate the importance \r\nand relevance of that theme. Madagascar has been \r\nthrough one itself, and it has just taken a major step \r\nforward thanks to the help of international mediation, \r\nwhich has allowed the Malagasy to reach a promising \r\nconsensus.  \r\n I also wish to pay a sincere tribute to the late Dag \r\nHammarskjöld, the former Secretary-General of this \r\ngreat Organization, a pioneer of preventive diplomacy \r\nand an architect of the concept of peacekeeping, as we \r\nmark the fiftieth anniversary of his tragic passing. \r\nDuring his tenure, he worked tirelessly to solidify the \r\nlegitimacy of the United Nations in the peaceful \r\nresolution of international disputes. Now again, we \r\nowe him a great debt for the universal recognition of \r\nthe virtues of mediation in resolving tensions and even \r\nconflicts. \r\n We have just commemorated the tragic events of \r\n11 September 2001, which shook the city of New York \r\nand indeed the whole world. It is also 10 years since \r\nthe United Nations Year of Dialogue among \r\nCivilizations, during which the dialogue of cultures \r\nand the culture of dialogue were promoted on the \r\ninternational stage in order to combat the clash of \r\ncivilizations. \r\n Mr. Allam-mi (Chad), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n When we speak of conflicts, we have in mind two \r\ndifferent ideologies that do not uphold the same values. \r\nThat can mean two countries, two regions or even a \r\nGovernment and its people. In the last case, when one \r\nno longer respects the other it triggers a popular \r\nuprising that ends in a conflict, leading to a crisis; \r\nhence, the importance of the role of mediation in \r\nsettling disputes through peaceful means. \r\nA/66/PV.20  \r\n \r\n11-51191 32 \r\n \r\n In that regard, any mediation should collate first-\r\nhand information. It should see for itself the realities \r\nprevailing on the ground in a conflict before proposing \r\na solution that would be lasting and acceptable to all. \r\n History has shown that the excessive acts of a \r\nleader who resorts to force have serious repercussions \r\nfor his country that can lead it into chaos and cost the \r\nlives of dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of \r\ninnocent people. It is an entire people who, \r\nunfortunately, suffer the grave consequences. This \r\noccurs because true solutions are often too slow in \r\ncoming, plunging a large segment of humankind into \r\npoverty, since we must respond to suffering, anguish \r\nand despair. We want to change and we will change. \r\n To better illustrate my words, allow me to speak \r\nof the case of my country, Madagascar. Everyone here \r\nknows as well as I do that the island of Madagascar has \r\nbeen in political crisis since late 2008. The Malagasy \r\npeople rose up with determination to break with a past \r\nmarked by poor governance and non-respect for \r\ndemocratic principles, human rights and the rule of law \r\nthat gave rise to widespread impoverishment, \r\nunbearable and inescapable social poverty, and the \r\ngrowing frustration of the majority of my countrymen. \r\nThe Malagasy people therefore demanded a better life \r\nand genuine change, with strengthened respect for \r\nuniversal principles. \r\n When the search for a solution to the crisis turned \r\nto the principle of consensual and inclusive \r\nmanagement of transition, and when that consensus \r\nproved difficult to reach, commendable mediation \r\nefforts among the Malagasy protagonists were made by \r\nlocal civil society organizations, the bilateral and \r\nregional partners of the big island, and the international \r\ncommunity. \r\n I permit myself to mention here and to strongly \r\ncommend the untiring and patient efforts of the \r\nmediation team of the Southern African Development \r\nCommunity (SADC), a regional body mandated by the \r\nAfrican Union, as well as the determined initiatives of \r\nother entities, such as the United Nations, the \r\nInternational Organization of la Francophonie and the \r\nIndian Ocean Commission. The involvement of these \r\nand all actors concerned in the mediation was critical \r\nin responding with effectiveness and pragmatism \r\ncommensurate with the emergency and in meeting the \r\nvital needs of the Malagasy people and economy, \r\nwhich could and would have been weakened if the \r\ncrisis and the negotiations had lasted any longer. \r\n The Malagasy people were patient and showed \r\nunprecedented and exemplary courage in the peaceful \r\nsettlement of the political crisis, despite all the \r\neconomic and social restrictions, as well as the absence \r\nof international aid that it has suffered for the past \r\nthree years. The post-crisis road map for Madagascar, \r\nproposed by SADC mediation, was initialled on \r\n9 March and signed by the political factions \r\nrepresenting the vast majority of Malagasy \r\nstakeholders on 17 September. The great political \r\nMalagasy family is now determined to move forward \r\nand to work together in the overall interest of the \r\nnation for the well-being, peace and serenity of the \r\nentire people. \r\n An extremely important threshold has just been \r\ncrossed, but there is still much work to be done. Now, \r\nwe must focus primarily on the implementation of the \r\nprovisions of the road map, with full respect for the \r\npeople’s primary aspirations, leading towards the \r\nholding of free, credible, fair and transparent elections. \r\nThat, in my opinion, is the only definitive solution to \r\nthe crisis ensuring a return to constitutional normality.  \r\n We have finally managed to reach a consensus \r\nagreement, reflected in the sense of compromise of \r\nwhich we are particularly proud, based as it is in the \r\ninherent culture of Fihavanana — a notion of social \r\nlife that has guided the Malagasy people since the \r\ndawn of time and that can be boiled down to the \r\nprinciples of fraternity, solidarity, mutual respect, \r\ntolerance and wisdom. We have thereby expressed our \r\nresolve to move forward towards the reconstruction \r\nand development of our society. \r\n For my part, I will spare no effort and will do my \r\nutmost to ensure that these actions achieve the \r\nanticipated results and are rapidly crowned with \r\nsuccess. I therefore launch a solemn appeal to the \r\ninternational community to make the needed individual \r\nand collective contribution to their implementation. In \r\nparticular, I draw the attention of the United Nations to \r\nthe work that it must undertake in assessing \r\nMadagascar’s electoral needs so that an electoral \r\ntimeframe, drawn up in a credible, neutral, transparent \r\nand independent way and based on respect for \r\nfundamental rights and international standards, can be \r\nestablished as soon as possible. \r\n History teaches us that, even following the use of \r\nforce, all wars and conflicts always end around a table. \r\nThat clearly shows that mediation can be chosen as an \r\nalternative to weapons. We are opposed to the use of \r\nany form of repression whatsoever. It is entirely \r\n A/66/PV.20\r\n \r\n33 11-51191 \r\n \r\npossible to resolve differences by peaceful means, as in \r\nthe case for Madagascar, by resorting to a more \r\neffective method, such as dialogue. \r\n The world is evolving. The world is changing, \r\nand all of us leaders here want a better world for our \r\nrespective peoples. Yes, it is possible, and we can do it.  \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the High Transitional Authority of the \r\nRepublic of Madagascar for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\n Mr. Andry Nirina Rajoelina, President of the \r\nHigh Transitional Authority of the Republic of \r\nMadagascar, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n  The meeting rose at 7.05 p.m. \r\n"
