Bainimarama,  \r\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Fiji and \r\nCommander of the Fiji Military Forces  \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Fiji and Commander of the \r\nFiji Military Forces. \r\n Mr. Josaia V. Bainimarama, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Fiji and Commander of the Fiji \r\nMilitary Forces, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Josaia \r\nV. Bainimarama, Prime Minister of the Republic of Fiji \r\nand Commander of the Fiji Military Forces, and \r\ninviting him to address the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Bainimarama (Fiji): I bring warm greetings \r\nto all from the Government and people of Fiji. May I \r\ntake this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Al-Nasser on \r\nhis election to the presidency of the General Assembly \r\nat its sixty-sixth session and pay tribute to his \r\npredecessor, Mr. Joseph Deiss. \r\n This year, it was my honour to open new missions \r\nin Indonesia and South Africa. The Fiji High \r\nCommission in Pretoria is our first diplomatic mission \r\non the continent of Africa, and we see it as a gateway \r\nto that great continent. Our new embassy in Jakarta is \r\nintended to strengthen our warm, fraternal relations \r\nwith Indonesia. In the same spirit, I journey next week \r\nto Brazil to open Fiji’s first embassy on the South \r\nAmerican continent.  \r\n In May this year Fiji had the privilege of being \r\nadmitted to membership of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement. We have pledged to play our full part in the \r\nMovement’s activities, particularly in the area of \r\nSouth-South cooperation and sustainable development. \r\nThese positive developments complement the Fijian \r\nGovernment’s Look North Policy and our intention to \r\nexpand relations with non-traditional partners. We \r\nbelieve that such an expansion of outlook is essential \r\nto our national development and our full exercise of \r\nFiji’s global rights and responsibilities. Here at the \r\nUnited Nations, we are active members of the Asia-\r\nPacific Group and, along with our fellow Pacific small \r\nisland developing States, we greatly appreciate the \r\nsupport given to us by members of that regional group. \r\n Fiji’s guiding document, the People’s Charter for \r\nChange, Peace and Progress, has given our nation the \r\ntask of enhancing Fiji’s international relations, both \r\nbilaterally and multilaterally. In pursuit of this task, \r\nsince the beginning of last year Fiji has formalized \r\ndiplomatic relations with 37 countries, bringing to a \r\ntotal of 114 the number of countries with which Fiji \r\nhas formal diplomatic relations. Fiji is firmly on the \r\nA/66/PV.21  \r\n \r\n11-51197 2 \r\n \r\npath of formalizing our diplomatic relations with all \r\nStates Members of the United Nations. \r\n Fiji remains steadfastly committed to the work of \r\nthe United Nations in safeguarding world peace, \r\nincluding all international counter-terrorism efforts. In \r\n2006, Fiji voted in favour of the preparation of a robust \r\narms trade treaty (resolution 61/89), and we commend \r\nall those who have shown commitment to preparing \r\nthat treaty for signature in 2012.  \r\n Fiji’s commitment to the Charter of the United \r\nNations remains steadfast. Our tradition of service in \r\nthe Blue Helmets of United Nations peacekeeping \r\nbegan in 1978 in Lebanon with the United Nations \r\nInterim Force in Lebanon, in which the Fijian battalion \r\nserved for 24 years. In 1982 when the multinational \r\nforce and observers were deployed as peacekeepers in \r\nSinai, a Fijian battalion was among them and has \r\nremained there to this day. In Iraq, the guard unit of the \r\nUnited Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) \r\nhas been manned by Fijians since 2004. With the \r\nplanned withdrawal of the United States forces from \r\nIraq this year, the United Nations has seen fit to \r\nincrease the size of its UNAMI guard unit and, after \r\ndue process, Fiji was selected to provide the extra \r\npersonnel. We thank the United Nations for the \r\nconfidence it has shown in our servicemen and \r\nservicewomen.  \r\n In addition, Fijian servicemen and servicewomen \r\nare currently stationed in peacekeeping missions in \r\nSouth Sudan, Abyei, Darfur, Liberia and Timor-Leste. I \r\npause here to profess my country’s recognition and \r\nrespect for the selfless service given by United Nations \r\npeacekeepers in the troubled regions of our world, and \r\nto pay tribute to those of them who made the ultimate \r\nsacrifice. \r\n Fiji is currently the Chair of the Melanesian \r\nSpearhead Group (MSG), whose membership includes \r\nFiji, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and \r\nthe Kanak and Socialist National Liberation Front of \r\nNew Caledonia. This year, the MSG was pleased to \r\nadmit Indonesia and Timor-Leste to observer status. \r\nFiji wishes to commend the work of our brother MSG \r\nmissions at the United Nations in bringing Melanesian \r\nconcerns to the attention of the United Nations Special \r\nPolitical and Decolonization Committee. Through its \r\nmembership of the Decolonization Committee, Fiji will \r\ncontinue to call for the Committee to conduct effective \r\nmonitoring and assessment of the progress of New \r\nCaledonia’s Nouméa Accord. In this regard, we would \r\nwelcome the establishment of arrangements for closer \r\ncooperation and information-sharing between the \r\nUnited Nations Secretariat and the MSG secretariat. \r\nWe also express our gratitude to the Government of \r\nFrance for its cooperation and assistance to this end. \r\n The United Nations Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs) continue to inspire our economic \r\ndevelopment efforts. In Fiji, we have concentrated our \r\nfocus on national infrastructure development under our \r\nroad map for democracy and sustainable socio-economic \r\ndevelopment. Under the road map, priority has been \r\ngiven to rural electrification expansion, access to clean \r\nwater and to national road development. This focus is \r\nwith a view to creating the bedrock required for \r\nsustainable economic growth.  \r\n Since the reform of Fiji’s laws to bring them into \r\nline with the Convention on the Elimination of All \r\nForms of Discrimination against Women and the \r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child, further progress \r\nhas been achieved. We are experiencing increased \r\nparticipation by women in local decision-making \r\nbodies, thereby empowering rural women, increasing \r\nthe enrolment of women and girls in tertiary education, \r\ngender mainstreaming within the Government system \r\nand increasing the provision of welfare assistance to \r\nthe marginalized, including single mothers.  \r\n The Domestic Violence Decree, which came into \r\neffect last year, is now being effectively implemented \r\nby the law enforcement agencies in conjunction with \r\ncivil society groups. Its regime of restraining orders is \r\nintended to deter perpetrators of family violence from \r\ninflicting further violence, while allowing families to \r\nremain together in peace. The Decree recognizes the \r\ndifficulty experienced by women and children in \r\ngaining access to the justice system because of family, \r\ncommunity, cultural and attitudinal barriers.  \r\n In order to address the MDG HIV/AIDS target, \r\nthe Fijian Government enacted a new law this year \r\nthat, among other things, safeguards the privacy and \r\nrights of persons infected or affected by HIV. The \r\nHIV/AIDS Decree is based on the United Nations \r\ninternational guidelines on HIV/AIDS and on the \r\nDeclaration of Commitment to a human rights-based \r\napproach to dealing with the epidemic. The Decree has \r\nbeen acknowledged as one of the most progressive HIV \r\nlaws in the world. Fiji participated in and was \r\nrepresented by our Head of State, His Excellency Ratu \r\n A/66/PV.21\r\n \r\n3 11-51197 \r\n \r\nEpeli Nailatikau, at the HIV/AIDS High-level Meeting \r\nthat was held in this Hall in August.  \r\n In addition to the HIV/AIDS Decree, Fiji this \r\nyear passed the Mental Health Decree, based on World \r\nHealth Organization guidelines on best practice for \r\nmental patients, and the Child Welfare Decree, which \r\ncreates a system that requires the mandatory reporting \r\nof child abuse by doctors, police officers and lawyers \r\nto the Ministry of Social Welfare. \r\n Fiji is determined to provide to all Fijians \r\nenlightened and progressive laws on health care, access \r\nto health services and justice. A large percentage of \r\nFiji’s population is at risk of contracting a \r\nnon-communicable disease (NCDs), or lifestyle \r\ndisease, including cardiovascular or cancerous \r\ndiseases. We welcome the high-level commitment of \r\nthe international community to address this crisis and \r\nthe successful completion of the High-level Meeting on \r\nNCDs this week. The Fijian Government has taken key \r\nactions to address NCD issues, including being the first \r\ncountry to sign and ratify the Framework Convention \r\non Tobacco Control. It is also one of the first countries \r\nto pilot a salt-reduction programme. \r\n The economic reforms undertaken by the Fijian \r\nGovernment have produced positive mid-term results. \r\nLast month, we were heartened to learn that Fiji’s \r\neconomic standing was assessed at a higher level by \r\nthe credit-rating agency Standard and Poor’s. This \r\nimproved rating is also attributable to the strong \r\nsupport of all development partners, including the \r\nprivate sector, which have worked closely with the \r\nFijian Government. I wish to take this opportunity to \r\nthank them for their cooperation, assistance and \r\ncollaboration. \r\n As a small island developing State (SIDS) \r\nvulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change, \r\nFiji has a strong desire to see positive and concrete \r\noutcomes achieved at the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) meeting in \r\nDurban later this year. We hold firm to the hope of a \r\nsuccessful outcome from the UNFCCC negotiations. \r\nHowever, the urgency of the situation for many small \r\nisland and low-lying coastal States, and the real threat \r\nposed by sea-level rise, prompted the Pacific SIDS to \r\ndraw the attention of the Security Council to the \r\nsecurity implications of climate change. Fiji hopes that \r\nthe presidential statement adopted by the Council in \r\nJuly (S/PRST/2011/15*) at the end of the open debate \r\non the security implications of climate change will \r\nenable the Council to look further into the plight of \r\nthose countries that are most at risk of losing their \r\nterritory to climate change. \r\n As the first signatory to the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea, Fiji has kept its \r\noceanic obligations at the core of its foreign policy. \r\nWith the increasing interest in seabed mining, and in \r\norder to avoid a race to the bottom by countries \r\nwishing to exploit the untapped mineral resources on \r\nthe ocean floor, it is imperative that the International \r\nSeabed Authority remain vigilant in safeguarding the \r\nenvironmental integrity of the world’s seabeds. Fiji has \r\ninvested much time and many resources in the \r\nresponsible consideration of seabed mining, and thus \r\nwelcomes the Advisory Opinion of the Seabed \r\nDisputes Chamber on the responsibilities and \r\nobligations of States parties with regard to seabed \r\nmining. We also welcome the decision by the Council \r\nof the International Seabed Authority to approve the \r\napplication by Tonga and Nauru for the exploration of \r\npolymetallic nodules in the mid-east Pacific Ocean.  \r\n We see the Pacific small island developing States \r\nas legitimate participants in this oceanic resource. The \r\nPacific Ocean is the mainstay of our country’s \r\nlivelihood, our food security and our economy. Fiji \r\nviews the blue economy as an essential element of the \r\ngreen economy. In this regard, we consider the 2012 \r\nRio de Janeiro United Nations Conference on \r\nSustainable Development to be critical to protecting \r\nthat economy. \r\n Since I last addressed the General Assembly (see \r\nA/65/PV.19), Fijians have benefited from the nation’s \r\nStrategic Framework for Change. The Framework set \r\nin place the road map that will take Fiji to the holding \r\nof national elections by September 2014. Under the \r\nprovisions of the road map, from September next year \r\nuntil 2013 our nation must turn its attention to the \r\ndevelopment of a new constitution premised along the \r\nlaudable principles set out in the People’s Charter for \r\nChange, Peace and Progress. The road map clearly \r\nstates that in the process the new Fijian constitution \r\nmust do away with racial categorization and \r\ndiscrimination so that for the first time in Fiji’s history, \r\nFijians will go to elections in 2014 on the basis of \r\ncommon and equal suffrage. That will be real progress. \r\nIt will undo decades of undemocratic laws and policies \r\ninherited from our colonial past and entrenched in past \r\nConstitutions that have impeded our nation’s progress. \r\nA/66/PV.21  \r\n \r\n11-51197 4 \r\n \r\nThis is a determined move to create a society based on \r\nsubstantive equality and justice and respect for the \r\ndignity of all Fijians.  \r\n As we enter this formative two-year period in \r\nFiji’s history, we recognize that inclusiveness will be \r\nan essential part of the process in the formulation of \r\nthe new constitution. We also recognize our national \r\nresponsibility at all times to ensure that the nation’s \r\noverall peace, well-being and sustainable economic \r\ndevelopment prevail over divisive factional interests. \r\nThe Fijian nation will prevail, and we have every \r\nconfidence that our beloved country has the \r\nhomegrown ability to pull itself up by its own \r\nbootstraps. In this respect, I am happy to inform this \r\ngathering that electronic registration of voters for the \r\nnational elections is scheduled to commence in January \r\nnext year. \r\n We trust that our trading and development \r\npartners, friends old and new, will give us the \r\nunderstanding, the space and the assistance we need to \r\nensure that true and sustainable democracy can take \r\nroot in Fiji. In this regard, we have taken great heart \r\nfrom recent assurances of support from many of our \r\nbilateral and multilateral friends, not least of which is \r\nthe United Nations. \r\n Once again, I offer my congratulations to the \r\nPresident on his election and my best wishes for a \r\nproductive sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Fiji and Commander \r\nof the Fiji Military Forces for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\n Mr. Josaia V. Bainimarama, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Fiji and Commander of the Fiji \r\nMilitary Forces, was escorted from the rostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by Ms. Cissé Mariam Kaïdama Sidibé, \r\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Mali \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Mali. \r\n Ms. Cissé Mariam Kaïdama Sidibé, Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Mali, was escorted to \r\nthe rostrum. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming Her Excellency Ms. Cissé \r\nMariam Kaïdama Sidibé, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Mali, and inviting her to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n Ms. Sidibé (Mali) (spoke in French): Allow me at \r\nthe outset to convey the regrets of His Excellency \r\nMr. Amadou Toumani Touré, President of the Republic \r\nof Mali, who, owing to a particularly busy national \r\nschedule at this time, was unable to attend the current \r\nsession of the General Assembly. However, he asked \r\nme to convey his most cordial greetings and sincere \r\nwishes for the success of our work. \r\n The Mali delegation is particularly pleased to \r\nconvey to Mr. Al-Nasser its heartfelt congratulations \r\non his election to the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-sixth session. His election is not \r\nonly a just recognition of his exceptional qualities as a \r\nseasoned diplomat, but also a tremendous tribute to his \r\ncountry, Qatar, with which Mali enjoys excellent \r\nrelations. I therefore assure him of the support and full \r\ncooperation of my delegation in discharging his \r\nmission. Allow me also to express my great \r\nappreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Joseph Deiss, for \r\nthe superb manner in which he presided over the sixty-\r\nfifth session, which has just ended, to the satisfaction \r\nof all Member States.  \r\n Finally, I should like to congratulate Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon on his outstanding re-election as \r\nthe head of the Organization. I remain fully convinced \r\nthat his unswerving commitment to upholding the \r\nprinciples and ideals of the Organization and to the \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals \r\nwill help to strengthen further the role of the United \r\nNations on the international scene. \r\n The current global context is marked by profound \r\npolitical upheavals that gravely threaten international \r\npeace and security. This situation makes the theme \r\nchosen for the general debate — “The role of \r\nmediation in the peaceful settlement of disputes” — all \r\nthe more pertinent. I should therefore like first to stress \r\nthe important role of mediation and the urgency of \r\nrenewed collective efforts to prevent and resolve \r\nconflicts and, above all, to put a halt to violence, the \r\nuntold suffering inflicted on civilian populations, and \r\nthe massive destruction of socio-economic \r\ninfrastructure.  \r\n A/66/PV.21\r\n \r\n5 11-51197 \r\n \r\n My country remains convinced that the \r\nprevention of conflicts and their resolution through \r\nmediation are undoubtedly guarantees of peace and \r\nlasting security. In that regard, Mali will continue to \r\nencourage and support all initiatives and mediation \r\nefforts under way with a view to combating the root \r\ncauses of conflicts and paving the way to a lasting \r\npolitical solution able to guarantee peace, stability and \r\nsecurity, without which there can be no socio-economic \r\ndevelopment. Part of this process are the promotion of \r\ngood-neighbourly relations and peaceful coexistence, \r\nthe non-use of force in dispute settlement, \r\nunderstanding and mutual respect, the bolstering of \r\ninternational cooperation, and the culture of peace and \r\ndialogue among religions and civilizations. \r\n The events under way in the world are of concern \r\nto us in that they clearly demonstrate that the quest for \r\npeace and security remains the most pressing \r\nchallenge. In Africa, while outstanding progress has \r\nbeen made in promoting peace, security and stability, \r\nthe fact remains that the situation in the Horn of Africa \r\nand in North Africa, particularly in Libya, remains a \r\nsource of major concern. Today more than ever, \r\nweapons and deadly confrontations must give way to \r\nthe imperative of dialogue and national reconciliation, \r\nwhich are required to establish lasting peace, \r\nconsolidate national unity and maintain territorial \r\nintegrity. \r\n In the Middle East, the Palestinian question is \r\nand remains a source of major concern to the \r\ninternational community, which must encourage the \r\nIsraelis and Palestinians to take the steps necessary to \r\nestablish a climate of trust and launch direct \r\nnegotiations towards a comprehensive peace \r\nunderpinned, inter alia, on the relevant resolutions of \r\nthe General Assembly and the Security Council. While \r\nreiterating its active solidarity and total support to the \r\nPalestinian people in their just, legitimate struggle, \r\nMali will continue to support all initiatives towards the \r\ncreation of an independent, sovereign and viable \r\nPalestinian State living side by side and in peace with \r\nIsrael within secure, internationally recognized \r\nborders. \r\n International peace and security continue to be \r\nthreatened by other phenomena, such as international \r\nterrorism, cross-border organized crime, and the traffic \r\nin weapons, drugs and human beings. The attacks \r\nperpetrated throughout the world are stark reminders \r\nthat no country is safe from terrorism, and that no \r\ncause, howsoever just, can justify the deliberate use of \r\nviolence against innocent civilians.  \r\n In that regard, I note the security challenges in \r\nthe vast Sahelo-Saharan strip that Mali shares with \r\nseveral brother countries in the region. Our subregion \r\nfaces today the proliferation of small arms and light \r\nweapons and the trafficking of drugs and human beings \r\nfuelled by organized crime networks in collusion with \r\nterrorist groups. The events in Libya and their \r\ncollateral effects could further aggravate this already \r\nworrisome situation.  \r\n Aware of the threats posed by these phenomena to \r\nthe stability and harmonious development of the \r\nregion, the Governments of the countries concerned \r\nhave worked to establish joint operational mechanisms \r\nto combat our common enemies effectively. For its \r\npart, the Government of Mali reaffirms its full support \r\nfor all initiatives of the States of the subregion seeking \r\nto better coordinate and harmonize our efforts to meet \r\nthe multiple common challenges. Parallel to efforts at \r\nthe subregional level, our Government is intensifying \r\nits efforts to implement the Special Programme for \r\nPeace, Security and Development in Northern Mali. \r\n The year 2012 will be an important one for Mali. \r\nAfter almost 20 years of democratic institutional \r\npractices, the President of the Republic, who will not \r\nstand for re-election, saw fit to revise the 1992 \r\nConstitution, following broad national consultations, in \r\norder to consolidate democracy, good governance and \r\nthe rule of law in our country. \r\n A participative, inclusive process has already \r\nbeen opened with all stakeholders — the Government, \r\npolitical parties, national deputies and civil society — \r\nto guarantee the transparency and credibility of future \r\nreferendums and future. I reiterate the commitment of \r\nthe Government to do its utmost to smoothly \r\nimplement the envisaged reforms and meet the \r\nchallenge of holding successful elections in 2012. I \r\nremain confident of success as our democracy has \r\nmatured over the past four elections. This progress has \r\nbeen inspired from Malian culture based on dialogue, \r\ntolerance and sharing.  \r\n The people of Mali share the ambition of the \r\nGovernment to build a strong, united Mali — a \r\ndemocratic and stable Mali resolutely committed to \r\npeace, dialogue and international cooperation. They \r\nalso share the determination of the Government to \r\ncreate the conditions for true prosperity in order to \r\nA/66/PV.21  \r\n \r\n11-51197 6 \r\n \r\nmake Mali an emerging economy in the medium term. \r\nThat is why I solemnly call from this rostrum on the \r\ninternational community and development partners to \r\nsupport the electoral process under way and our efforts \r\nto meet the challenge of organizing a constitutional \r\nreferendum and free, transparent and democratic \r\nelections. \r\n As a Sahelo-Saharan country facing the \r\nphenomenon of desertification and unpredictable \r\nrainfall, Mali considers climate change to be one of the \r\nmajor challenges affecting the survival and \r\ndevelopment of humankind. That is why we are present \r\nat all meetings on this issue, as borne out by our recent \r\nparticipation at the High-level Meeting on the theme \r\n“Addressing desertification, land degradation and \r\ndrought in the context of sustainable development and \r\npoverty eradication”. I reaffirm Mali’s commitment to \r\ncontinuing to step up its actions to preserve and \r\nconserve the soils, forests and fauna, in step with the \r\nnational and international commitments of our country. \r\n The sessions of the General Assembly also offer \r\nus a chance to take stock of the severity of other \r\nchallenges facing the world. I think in particular of the \r\nstruggle against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and \r\nnon-communicable diseases, which were the subject of \r\nHigh-level Meetings on 19 and 20 September. In \r\naddition to the challenges they pose to public health, \r\nthese scourges have become a real problem for \r\ndevelopment. The international community must, we \r\nbelieve, redouble its efforts and its vigilance to contain \r\nthese illnesses. It will also have to deliver on its \r\ncommitments to the developing countries in order to \r\nallow them to achieve the Millennium Development \r\nGoals.  \r\n It is also important to give sustained attention to \r\nthe issue of reform and democratization of the United \r\nNations by giving a greater role to women in decision-\r\nmaking in political, economic and security forums. It is \r\nalso important to democratize the international \r\nfinancial institutions, bearing in mind the huge changes \r\nthat have taken place in the world and the need for \r\nbetter representation for all regions. \r\n The global economic situation certainly remains \r\nfragile, but the financial crisis should not become a \r\npretext for reducing official development assistance \r\n(ODA). The implementation of the Programme of \r\nAction for the achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals must remain a priority. The \r\ninternational community must revive its collective will \r\nto put into practice and even go beyond commitments \r\nundertaken in the field of ODA in order to combat \r\npoverty and all forms of injustice that breed violence \r\nand insecurity throughout the world.  \r\n Similarly, the implementation of the Istanbul \r\nPolitical Declaration and Programme of Action for the \r\nleast developed countries (LDCs) for the decade 2011-\r\n2020 will allow the LDCs to marshal the necessary \r\nfinancial resources to ensure the lasting growth and \r\ndevelopment that guarantee peace and stability in the \r\nworld. In that regard, Mali will continue to support all \r\ninnovative initiatives in development financing, trade, \r\nthe alleviation of foreign debt, and technology transfer \r\nto developing countries in general and LDCS in \r\nparticular. \r\n In our quest for a safer and more just, prosperous \r\nand peaceful world, the best way to guarantee our \r\ncommon future is to strengthen cooperation and \r\ninternational solidarity. Let us engage collectively to \r\nfind lasting solutions to the challenges and complex \r\nproblems facing humankind. It is in the interest of us \r\nall and in the interest of our collective survival. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Mali for the \r\nstatement she has just made. \r\n Ms. Cissé Mariam Kaïdama Sidibé, Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Mali, was escorted \r\nfrom the rostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Sibusiso Barnabas Dlamini, \r\nPrime Minister of the Kingdom of Swaziland \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of the Kingdom of Swaziland. \r\n Mr. Sibusiso Barnabas Dlamini, Prime Minister \r\nof the Kingdom of Swaziland, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcome His Excellency Mr. Sibusiso \r\nBarnabas Dlamini, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of \r\nSwaziland, and inviting him to address the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n Mr. Dlamini (Swaziland): It is a great honour for \r\nme to address the Assembly on behalf of His Majesty \r\n A/66/PV.21\r\n \r\n7 11-51197 \r\n \r\nKing Mswati III, Head of State of the Kingdom of \r\nSwaziland. His Majesty King Mswati III, Her Majesty \r\nthe Queen Mother, the Government and the people of \r\nthe Kingdom of Swaziland send best wishes and \r\ncongratulations to the State of Qatar and Mr. Al-Nasser \r\non his election to the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-sixth session. We are confident \r\nthat his wide experience and diplomatic skills will \r\nensure success in the challenging issues that face this \r\nsession. I should also like to commend the excellent \r\nwork of his predecessor, Mr. Joseph Deiss. \r\n The founders of the United Nations envisaged an \r\ninternational Organization whose primary strength \r\nwould rest in its Members acting collectively and \r\ncooperatively in resolving international problems. In \r\nthis regard, the theme of this general debate, “The role \r\nof mediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful \r\nmeans”, pertinently captures the initial vision.  \r\n The pursuit of peace and security in many parts \r\nof the world is vital to a future of continued \r\ncoexistence. We owe it to posterity to maintain a \r\nhabitable world. International efforts to intervene and \r\nmediate in internal conflicts should not be taken lightly \r\nand interlocutors should be alert to the sensibilities \r\ninvolved in every specific situation. History has taught \r\nus that transplanted solutions never work successfully. \r\nThere is no one-size-fits-all in the pursuit of peace \r\nbecause every situation and era is unique. The \r\ninternational community should also be quick to spot \r\nirrelevant forces that seek to champion narrow \r\ninterests. \r\n The Kingdom of Swaziland wishes to \r\ncongratulate the Republic of South Sudan on the \r\nindependence it obtained this year and celebrated on \r\n9 July. Credit must also go to the Republic of the \r\nSudan for its steadfast resolve to see to it that the \r\nprocess was successful. The efforts of the High-Level \r\nPanel on Darfur and the Panel of the Wise \r\ncommissioned by the African Union are also \r\nacknowledged. The African Union has been \r\ninstrumental in utilizing the vast experience of former \r\nleaders of Africa as it seeks to identify African \r\nsolutions for African problems. My country wishes to \r\nreiterate its commitment to this concept.  \r\n For a similar reason, the Kingdom of Swaziland \r\nprays with the people of Libya that there will be a swift \r\nend to the current conflict and a sustainable solution \r\nthat has the quest of peaceful resolution as the \r\nwatchword when dealing with any transitional \r\ndifficulties. In this regard, we look forward to the \r\nformation of an all-inclusive Government that will \r\nensure that Libya moves towards a brighter future. The \r\nworld needs a unified and stable Libya to resume its \r\nplace in global affairs. \r\n It would be remiss of me if I did not mention the \r\nhugely damaging long-term effects of the war in \r\nSomalia. The difficulties are now compounded by a \r\nterrible famine. While the blame might be placed on \r\nclimate change, nevertheless we hold the view that \r\nSomalia would manage this latest humanitarian \r\ndisaster — the famine — considerably better if the \r\ninternational community were to collaborate on a \r\nsustainable political solution, which is essential for \r\neconomic recovery. Sadly the world appears to have \r\nforgotten Somalia, with only the African Union and \r\nother regional arrangements dealing with the effects of \r\nthe war in that country.  \r\n The piracy problem, which has clearly deepened, \r\nis one of many signs that Somalia needs a \r\ncomprehensive political intervention that involves all \r\ninternational interlocutors. There has been a great deal \r\nof support for the fight against piracy, but not as part of \r\na more holistic approach. The world surely does not \r\nwant to send the message that its interventions take \r\nplace only when specific interests are threatened.  \r\n In the same spirit, the Kingdom of Swaziland \r\nencourages the Quartet on the question of Palestine to \r\nremain resolute in finding common ground between \r\nIsrael and Palestine. We are well aware that there have \r\nbeen setbacks before, but we are optimistic that at the \r\nend of it all there will be a groundbreaking solution, \r\nwith Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace \r\nand harmony. \r\n The Kingdom of Swaziland joins the rest of the \r\nworld in its condemnation of terrorism and threats to \r\ninternational peace and security. In the same spirit, we \r\nrecall the 9/11 criminal attacks that occurred 10 years \r\nago and all who were affected. We therefore commend \r\nthe Secretary-General for hosting the Symposium on \r\nInternational Counter-Terrorism Cooperation, which \r\nunderscored the importance of greater international \r\ncooperation among States on a whole range of counter-\r\nterrorism topics, as covered in the United Nations \r\nGlobal Counter-Terrorism Strategy. We hope that the \r\nrecommendations thereof will provide a source of \r\nA/66/PV.21  \r\n \r\n11-51197 8 \r\n \r\nreference to all Member States, international \r\norganizations and relevant stakeholders. \r\n The promotion and protection of human rights are \r\na common objective of all countries. While great \r\nachievements have been made in international human \r\nrights cooperation since the adoption of the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights, challenges still exist. As \r\na developing country, we believe that greater \r\nimportance should be attached to the right to \r\ndevelopment so that everyone can enjoy the benefits of \r\nglobalization. The international community should pay \r\nmore attention to economic, social and cultural \r\nrights — such as the right to life, the right to food and \r\nthe right to health — and promote international \r\ncooperation in this regard. The developed countries \r\nshould do more to honour their commitments in terms \r\nof development assistance, technology transfer, debt \r\nreduction and market access so as to create favourable \r\nconditions for the effective promotion of the universal \r\nrealization of the right to development.  \r\n The Kingdom of Swaziland voted in favour of \r\nresolution 60/251, which established the Human Rights \r\nCouncil. We also formed part of the consensus on \r\nresolution 65/281 on the review of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil adopted this year. To this end, we also support \r\nthe engagement of Member States in the Universal \r\nPeriodic Review mechanism, which examines the \r\nhuman rights situation in all countries. Our country \r\nwill be among those to be considered at the Universal \r\nPeriodic Review in October 2011, and we look forward \r\nto engaging in an open and candid dialogue with other \r\nmembers of the Council. \r\n Throughout the past session, we pursued many \r\ndevelopment topics, notably the High-level Meeting on \r\nHIV/AIDS in June at which our political will to \r\nintensify our efforts to eliminate the scourge was \r\nreaffirmed. The Kingdom of Swaziland is proud to \r\nhave made great strides in this regard. For example, the \r\npercentage of children born HIV-free to HIV-positive \r\nmothers enrolled in the prevention of mother-to-child \r\ntransmission programme has risen to 83 per cent and is \r\nexpected to reach 100 per cent by 2015.  \r\n In today’s highly integrated and interconnected \r\nworld, almost all issues demand the full participation \r\nof international partners. Taiwan is one of the leading \r\neconomic and technological powerhouses of the world \r\ntoday, and the Kingdom of Swaziland is of the view \r\nthat Taiwan can contribute successfully to the \r\ninternational community. We therefore urge the United \r\nNations to find a suitable way to allow for Taiwan’s \r\nmeaningful participation in its specialized agencies and \r\nmechanisms, including the International Civil Aviation \r\nOrganization and the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change. There is no doubt that \r\nthe there is a functional need to include the people of \r\nTaiwan in the United Nations system and that their \r\ninclusion would be in the common interest of the \r\ninternational community. \r\n In conclusion, may I say that the Kingdom of \r\nSwaziland has confidence in the initiatives already \r\ntaken towards the renewal of this Organization and \r\nlooks forward to a new dynamic and vibrant working \r\nperiod. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPrime Minister of the Kingdom of Swaziland for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Sibusiso Barnabas Dlamini, Prime Minister \r\nof the Kingdom of Swaziland, was escorted from \r\nthe rostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Tillman Thomas, Prime \r\nMinister and Minister of National Security, \r\nInformation and Legal Affairs of Grenada \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister and Minister of National Security, \r\nInformation and Legal Affairs of Grenada. \r\n Mr. Tillman Thomas, Prime Minister and Minister \r\nof National Security, Information and Legal \r\nAffairs of Grenada, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency \r\nMr. Tillman Thomas, Prime Minister and Minister of \r\nNational Security, Information and Legal Affairs of \r\nGrenada, and inviting him to address the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n Mr. Thomas (Grenada): I am honoured to extend \r\ncongratulations to Mr. Al-Nasser on his appointment to \r\nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-\r\nsixth regular session. As two small countries, Qatar and \r\nGrenada share much in common. Accordingly, we look \r\nforward to his leadership and stand ready to support \r\nhim for the good of all the members of the General \r\nAssembly and the United Nations itself. We welcome \r\n A/66/PV.21\r\n \r\n9 11-51197 \r\n \r\nhis theme on mediation because we believe that when \r\nmediation is properly applied it can minimize \r\nconfrontation in the world. I also commend the \r\noutgoing President, Mr. Joseph Deiss, for his \r\nstewardship and dedication during the past year. \r\nGrenada congratulates Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his \r\nelection to a second term as Secretary-General and \r\nwishes him continued success. \r\n Now in its thirty-seventh year of independence \r\nand membership of the United Nations, Grenada \r\nrenews its commitment to the principles of the United \r\nNations Charter, believing that universal adherence to \r\nthose principles provides guidance to the United \r\nNations to act on what may seem intractable, for the \r\nUnited Nations is intended to lead, perhaps more so in \r\ndifficult times.  \r\n Grenada supports the pursuit of international \r\npeace and security. We believe firmly in the rule of \r\nlaw, the promotion of democracy and respect for \r\nhuman rights. We also support the fight against \r\nterrorism, as well as the campaign against the illicit \r\ndrug trade. All these pose serious threats to the security \r\nof our changing world. My Government reiterates its \r\ncommitment to the United Nations Charter. In support \r\nof the role of the United Nations, this year the \r\nGovernment of Grenada has signed three global \r\nconventions, including the Convention on Cluster \r\nMunitions, helping to bring about disarmament. \r\n We are all obliged to work selflessly to preserve \r\nour planet for future generations. The avoidance of \r\nnuclear confrontation is one sure way. We therefore \r\ncongratulate all Governments that have expended much \r\ntime and effort on nuclear non-proliferation.  \r\n Since we met a year ago, the world and the \r\nUnited Nations itself have faced many challenges — \r\neconomic, social and political — all of which \r\nundermine stability and people’s survival. The \r\neconomic crisis continues to weigh heavily on \r\nGrenada. Our population is experiencing high food and \r\nfuel prices, national revenues have decreased, and debt \r\ncontinues to be high. The green shoots of recovery that \r\nothers have experienced have not reached us. For us, \r\nthe economic crisis of 2008 still rages and we must \r\nfind a way out of it. Social and political strife remain, \r\nif not in Grenada, in other parts of the world. These \r\ndemonstrate that the search for freedom and justice is \r\nfar from over.  \r\n Human suffering and instability anywhere in the \r\nworld hurt us all, even in tiny Grenada, where \r\nunemployment in major capitals affects our tourism \r\nand even our remittances from abroad. The major \r\nchallenge facing Grenada as a small island developing \r\nState is how to reduce our weaknesses, how to increase \r\nour resilience, and how to pursue development for \r\npeople today and for their children tomorrow.  \r\n How are we to respond? We must attempt to \r\nachieve growth with equity, especially for women and \r\nyouth, and to support general improvements towards \r\npeople’s advancement — that is, create stable \r\nenvironments and opportunities for our people to \r\nthrive — and we must do so while contributing to a \r\njust, peaceful and democratic global framework. We \r\nbelieve that whatever the challenge, our common \r\npolitical will for fairness and justice must remain our \r\noverarching guiding principles in matters economic, \r\nsocial and political. \r\n Grenada’s main response so far has been to \r\nstrengthen our democratic processes and to advance the \r\nCaribbean regional integration movement. At the \r\nnational level, we promote social inclusion in the \r\ngovernance of the country that engages civil society, \r\nthe media and the people as a whole. We have \r\ninstituted consultations and participation in major \r\npolicy and legislative matters, including the revision of \r\nold laws and the making of new ones. At the regional \r\nlevel, we are working with the Organization of Eastern \r\nCaribbean States and the Caribbean Community \r\n(CARICOM), two groupings that constitute the \r\nunbreakable link with our national undertakings and \r\nhow we engage internationally. \r\n Grenada’s efforts to achieve sustainable \r\ndevelopment can be helped by both the December 2011 \r\nDurban Climate Change Conference and the June 2012 \r\nUnited Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (Rio+20). Grenada appeals to all parties \r\nto negotiate seriously and to meet commitments at both \r\nof these Conferences. These global meetings must \r\nbring added value to the ongoing efforts of Grenada \r\nand other developing countries, especially small States. \r\nDurban 2011 and Rio+20 must surely deliver \r\nmeaningful and attainable outcomes, including \r\nfulfilling old obligations and delivering on new ones, \r\nespecially on climate financing and the broader \r\nfinancing for development.  \r\nA/66/PV.21  \r\n \r\n11-51197 10 \r\n \r\n Developed countries must meet their \r\ncommitments to poorer nations. At the sixteenth \r\nsession of the Conference of the Parties to the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change in \r\nCancún last year we made some progress on climate \r\nchange and we must build on that. We welcome the \r\nestablishment of the Transitional Committee of the \r\nGreen Climate Fund and hope to see it capitalized and \r\nfully launched in Durban. We are deeply disappointed \r\nthat some countries are blocking the mandated review \r\nof 1.5 degrees Celsius as the potential global average \r\nwarming limit. We call on those States to withdraw \r\ntheir objections and support the movement to a safe \r\nthreshold for islands and for the world. We are \r\nconvinced that an adequate global response to climate \r\nchange must remain at the top of the global agenda. A \r\nlegally binding outcome must be part of the outcome of \r\nclimate negotiations. \r\n I call on partners to hasten the disbursement of \r\nfast-start funds, especially to small island States. These \r\ndisbursements must be consistent with the scale of the \r\ndamage already done and the continuing threats that we \r\nface from environmental degradation. We express \r\nsolidarity with our Pacific sisters and brothers, who are \r\ndaily losing territory to sea-level rise, perhaps faster \r\nthan we are in the Caribbean. They have my pledge \r\nthat we will continue to support them. \r\n Naturally, we are taking responsibility for \r\nourselves. This year we are launching a sustainable \r\nenergy programme for 24 small island developing \r\nStates. The Small Island Developing States Sustainable \r\nEnergy Initiative (SIDS DOCK) will provide the \r\nfoundation for low carbon economic growth and \r\nadaptation to climate change. It will facilitate energy \r\nefficiency and provide renewable energy to 24 small \r\nisland developing States. On behalf of the Alliance of \r\nSmall Island States I thank the Government and people \r\nof Denmark for making the first contribution of an \r\ninitial US$ 14.5 million to SIDS DOCK. We also thank \r\nour partners the World Bank and the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme for facilitating the \r\nprogramme. We invite the international community to \r\njoin Denmark in financing this effort.  \r\n In a similar vein to our climate change efforts, we \r\nlook to the Rio+20 meeting to advance our path to \r\nsustainability. One of the key outcomes for Grenada \r\nand other SIDS must be the development of a green \r\neconomy, one that combines investments, jobs and \r\nlivelihoods with environmental resources; and a blue \r\neconomy, one that takes into account coastal- and \r\nocean-based income generation. For indeed, peoples’ \r\nlivelihoods are largely based on environmental \r\nresources and services, including agriculture, \r\nagro-industries, forestry, mining and tourism. The \r\nRio+20 meeting can and must be a turning point for \r\npolitical commitment and financing for development. \r\n We know that the United Nations is capable of \r\nleadership. However, it can be more effective if it \r\nanticipates and responds to twenty-first century \r\nchallenges. That includes recognizing the fact that \r\ndozens of mature States, many in the developing world, \r\nare ready and able to take responsibility for the \r\nmanagement of the global agenda. The United Nations \r\nmust be reformed. How else will it support its growing \r\nagenda? How else can it manage this new global \r\nagenda for global sustainability, peace and \r\npeacekeeping and disaster response within a \r\ndemocratic multilateral system that is constantly \r\nevolving? What worked for 65 years must be reshaped \r\nfor today. That is why we call for reform of the \r\nSecurity Council to make it more representative and \r\ninclusive. Failure to do this will deny that body the \r\npolitical legitimacy it needs to maintain and indeed \r\nenhance its leadership role in the world and to make \r\nthe best decisions. Grenada joins with other member \r\nStates in the Caribbean Community and calls for \r\nexpansion of the Security Council in both its \r\npermanent and non-permanent categories and more \r\nopenness in its working methods. We call for a \r\nSecurity Council seat for small island States within a \r\nreasonable time frame and we also call for stronger and \r\nmore enhanced United Nations-CARICOM relations to \r\nbenefit the people of our Caribbean region. \r\n Grenada welcomes the formation and launch of \r\nthe United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the \r\nEmpowerment of Women, which is aimed at promoting \r\nthe rights of women and girls and equality between the \r\nsexes. That is an early success of United Nations \r\nreform. \r\n Grenada is firmly committed to the principle of \r\nself-determination. On 14 July Grenada joined with \r\nother Member States in welcoming the Republic of \r\nSouth Sudan as the 193rd Member of the United \r\nNations. We salute the efforts of its people to usher in \r\npeace at home and within the region. \r\n I turn now to the seemingly intractable problem \r\nof moving Palestine from a State-in-waiting to an \r\n A/66/PV.21\r\n \r\n11 11-51197 \r\n \r\ninternationally recognized State. This cannot be \r\nseparated from the international clamour for \r\ndemocratic rights now led by the Arab Spring. The just \r\naspirations of the people of Palestine must be \r\naddressed, and Palestine must not be left behind in the \r\nhistorical sweep towards open and sustainable \r\ndemocracies. Equally, the Arab Spring should also be \r\nthe occasion for the renewal of a commitment to \r\nIsrael’s security. Peace depends on viable democracies \r\nand sustained security. That is why Grenada is \r\ndisappointed that the Palestinians and Israelis have not \r\nconcluded talks over their long-standing dispute. We \r\nurge a return to these talks and look forward to the \r\npeaceful coexistence of these two States. \r\n It is quite obvious that the world continues to \r\nexperience the wrath of nature. We grieve at the waste \r\nof human life and the environmental destruction caused \r\nby disasters worldwide. We express our solidarity to \r\nMember States that have experienced floods, \r\nearthquakes, tsunamis and droughts in the past months. \r\nGrenada calls for a strong global response especially \r\nfor the humanitarian crisis now unfolding in the Horn \r\nof Africa. \r\n Grenada welcomes the new President of the sister \r\nCARICOM State of Haiti and wishes him and his team \r\nsuccess as they rebuild Haiti after the devastation of \r\nthe earthquake. While we thank all those who have \r\nhelped, much still remains to be done. We call on all \r\nwho have pledged to help Haiti to deliver on their \r\npledges and support the efforts of the Haitian people. \r\nTurning now to another Caribbean concern, Grenada \r\nagain urges the United States of America to completely \r\nlift the harsh economic embargo against the people of \r\nCuba. All but a handful of the United Nations \r\nmembership have consistently voted for the removal of \r\nthat embargo. \r\n We acknowledge that responding to the complex \r\nand interconnected issues on the United Nations \r\nagenda is a major task, even for the United Nations. \r\nNevertheless, responding must be at the top of the \r\nUnited Nations agenda. We maintain support for \r\nsustainable development, action on climate change, and \r\nsupport for justice and peace. Grenada commends the \r\nSecretary-General for organizing a number of high-\r\nlevel meetings on important topics. We are moved to \r\nsingle out the High-level Meeting on non-communicable \r\ndiseases. This scourge is negatively affecting not just \r\ndeveloping countries but many developed countries as \r\nwell. The proliferation of non-communicable diseases \r\nposes a very serious challenge to small island States \r\nlike Grenada because of their effects on the labour \r\nforce and demands on the shrinking finances of the \r\ncountry. We therefore welcome the outcome of the \r\nHigh-level Meeting and we pledge to implement its \r\nrecommendations. \r\n Finally, last year, building on the conclusion that \r\nthe United Nations is a real force for good in the world, \r\nI challenged the Organization to harness its strength to \r\nbetter achieve that purpose. This year, drawing on the \r\nmessage of youth to make the world a better place, I \r\nrepeat that call. It is my hope that, under the \r\nstewardship of the President, the General Assembly — \r\nand the United Nations as a whole — will continue to \r\nbe the main global force for the good of humanity. \r\nGrenada will do its part to advance this singular and \r\ninspiring goal. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPrime Minister and Minister of National Security, \r\nInformation and Legal Affairs of Grenada for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Tillman Thomas, Prime Minister and Minister \r\nof National Security, Information and Legal \r\nAffairs of Grenada, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Kay Rala Xanana Gusmão, \r\nPrime Minister of the Democratic Republic of \r\nTimor-Leste \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste. \r\n Mr. Kay Rala Xanana Gusmão, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Kay \r\nRala Xanana Gusmão, Prime Minister of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of Timor-Leste, and inviting him \r\nto address the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Gusmão (Timor-Leste) (spoke in Portuguese; \r\nEnglish text furnished by the delegation): It is a great \r\npleasure for me to be back at the United Nations \r\nHeadquarters. Last February I had the honour of taking \r\npart in a Security Council meeting, where I took the \r\nopportunity to thank the permanent members and all \r\nA/66/PV.21  \r\n \r\n11-51197 12 \r\n \r\nother nations that have been part of the Council for the \r\ngenerosity and care that have always been present in \r\nthe resolutions on Timor-Leste. Today, on behalf of the \r\npeople of Timor-Leste, I want to take this opportunity \r\nto thank all Members of this forum for the support they \r\nhave given to Timor-Leste in the promotion of peace \r\nand security and in the building of our national \r\ninstitutions. I am pleased to inform the General \r\nAssembly that we have come a long way as a people \r\nand as a State, replacing intolerance with constructive \r\ndialogue and the right to protest with the duty to \r\nprotest responsibly. We have taken firm steps to put the \r\ndifficult circumstances of the past behind us, and we \r\nhave renewed the confidence of the Timorese people in \r\nthe institutions of the State. As such we have already \r\nendorsed the Joint Transition Plan for the withdrawal \r\nof the United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-\r\nLeste by the end of 2012. \r\n We are in the last year of the five-year mandate \r\nof the Coalition Government that I have the honour of \r\nleading — the Parliamentary Majority Alliance (AMP), \r\nwhich includes five different political parties. Under \r\nthe Constitution of Timor-Leste the Government is \r\ndetermined either by the party with the most elected \r\nrepresentatives or by an alliance of parties with a \r\nparliamentary majority, as it is our National Parliament \r\nthat is elected directly by the people and not the \r\nGovernment itself. A government can be constituted \r\nonly if it is supported by a parliamentary majority. \r\nFollowing the 2007 elections the party with the most \r\nparliamentary representatives did not have a majority \r\nin its own right, so the President of the Republic, after \r\nformally meeting with all parties, endorsed a coalition \r\ngovernment in order to provide the best opportunity for \r\nstable government. This constitutional option served \r\nthe best interests of the nation, as we were living in a \r\nperiod of great fragility at that time as demonstrated by \r\nthe instability and violence that were the consequences \r\nof the 2006 crisis. \r\n Having inherited an unstable national situation, \r\nthe AMP Government focused on restoring peace and \r\nstability and resolving the many social and political \r\nproblems that stemmed from the 2006 crisis and \r\ncontinued into 2008. We were determined to put an end \r\nto the violent outbreaks that began in 2000 and were \r\nrepeated every two years, as though Timor-Leste was \r\ntrapped in a vicious cycle of violence. The key to \r\nbreaking the cycle was to acknowledge and admit that \r\nwe had failed. We had to address the root causes of our \r\nproblems and learn to deal with the frailty of our State \r\ninstitutions. Fortunately we were successful in \r\nconveying a strong political message about the need \r\nfor stability. The AMP Government committed itself to \r\na reform agenda and by governing through dialogue \r\nwas able to: initiate vital reforms in the defence and \r\nsecurity sectors, including capacity-building and \r\nprofessionalizing the police and defence forces; \r\nimplement structural reforms in the State \r\nAdministration’s management; create systems and \r\nstructures to ensure good governance, while continuing \r\nto support capacity-building in the justice sector; \r\nintroduce fairer social policies to reduce the imbalance \r\nthat existed in the society, taking into account the \r\nphysical, moral and psychological damage of a 24-year-\r\nlong war, and here I am speaking about veterans and \r\nthe elderly, who sacrificed themselves for our \r\nindependence and who, directly or indirectly, have \r\nsuffered the consequences of a devastating war; \r\nencourage structured policies on education, health and \r\nagriculture; and promote a coherent economic policy \r\nthroughout Timor-Leste to encourage the fledgling \r\nprivate sector. \r\n In 2009, on the tenth anniversary of the \r\nreferendum, the Government launched a new motto: \r\n“Goodbye conflict, welcome development”. The people \r\nof Timor-Leste embraced this motto wholeheartedly. In \r\nlooking forward to the period 2011-2020 we are \r\nconfident that we are now truly becoming a more \r\nstable and tolerant society that is peaceful by nature. \r\nWe also have the necessary optimism to initiate a \r\nbolder period of development. \r\n Over the past four years we have been \r\nstrengthening the institutional capacity of our public \r\nadministration to defend the best interests of the State, \r\nimprove public-service delivery, and promote good \r\ngovernance. \r\n We have introduced reforms in the area of public \r\nfinance management and we have created a Civil Service \r\nCommission. We have also created an Anti-Corruption \r\nCommission and begun to establish a Chamber of \r\nAccounts to promote transparency and accountability \r\nin our public accounts. Earlier this year we launched an \r\non-line transparency portal and procurement portal \r\nproviding access to data that is updated daily and that \r\ndeals with the process of the Timor-Leste State general \r\nbudget and its execution. These portals also allow \r\npublic consultation on advertised public projects. \r\n A/66/PV.21\r\n \r\n13 11-51197 \r\n \r\n We have also begun to develop the capacity of \r\nour private sector by promoting competence, \r\nprofessional honesty and technical skills. Our aim is to \r\ntransform the private sector into a strong partner with \r\nGovernment at this crucial period when we are \r\nbuilding our country. Across the country we have \r\ninvested in agriculture to increase the productivity of \r\nthe sector, as well as local and decentralized \r\ndevelopment programmes focused on minor \r\ninfrastructure projects to promote employment for \r\nyoung people in rural areas. Such measures have \r\ncontributed to our economic growth and helped create \r\njobs in the capital, Dili, and in rural areas, and they \r\nhave encouraged confidence in our State institutions \r\nand led to a spirit of optimism that has contributed to a \r\nchange in mindset. \r\n Timor-Leste is a country blessed with great \r\nnatural wealth, which means that we have the financial \r\ncapacity to improve the living conditions of our people. \r\nHowever, we know that countries rich in natural \r\nresources often perform below their economic potential \r\nand are more vulnerable to conflict and more \r\nsusceptible to bad governance. As such, transparency \r\nand good governance, which are essential in any \r\ncountry, become even more imperative for countries \r\nthat are rich in natural resources. Currently, the \r\nPetroleum Fund of Timor-Leste has a balance of \r\n$8.9 billion. We are the first country in Asia and the \r\nthird in the world to be compliant with the Extractive \r\nIndustries Transparency Initiative. As a result of our \r\ngood governance and prudent use of revenue, Timor-\r\nLeste has had double-digit growth in the past few \r\nyears. We believe that we are on the path to maintain \r\nthis growth, and we are confident that the institutions \r\nwe have established to support the Fund will become \r\nstronger, ensuring responsiveness and greater quality \r\nof work and execution. We will diversify the \r\ninvestment of our Petroleum Fund equally in bonds and \r\nequities to guarantee long-term sustainability, so that \r\nfuture generations will benefit in the same way as the \r\ncurrent post-war generation.  \r\n Having achieved our goal of stability we were in \r\na position to prepare a 20-year strategic development \r\nplan, which would replace the annual plan for each \r\nfiscal year. The plan covers three vital areas — social \r\ncapital, infrastructure and economic development. In \r\nterms of economic development we are focused on \r\nthree strategic industry sectors — the hydrocarbon \r\nindustry, the agriculture sector and tourism. We want to \r\nshift from an oil-dependent economy to a non-oil-\r\ndependent economy. All the strategies and actions set \r\nout in the plan aim to transform Timor-Leste from a \r\nlow-income country to an upper middle-income \r\ncountry with a healthy, well-educated and safe \r\npopulation that is prosperous and self-sufficient in \r\nterms of food. This new paradigm requires public \r\ninvestment in infrastructure and services and a \r\ndynamic private sector. Many emerging economies, \r\nparticularly in the Asian region, have been growing \r\ndespite the serious international financial crisis. \r\n Next year will be very important for us to \r\nconsolidate our process of State-building and to affirm \r\nourselves as a sovereign, tolerant and democratic \r\nnation. In 2012 we will hold presidential and \r\nlegislative elections, the third democratic elections in \r\nTimor-Leste, which I am confident will be conducted \r\npeacefully. Next year we will also celebrate vital \r\nhistoric dates that connect us to the more recent past, \r\nnamely, the struggle for independence, and to older \r\nroots that make us unique within the region and the \r\nworld. \r\n In addition to celebrating the tenth anniversary of \r\nthe restoration of independence, in 2012 we will also \r\ncelebrate the centenary of the Manufahi Revolt and the \r\n500-year anniversary of the arrival of the first \r\nPortuguese navigators in Timor-Leste. I should like to \r\ntake this opportunity to invite all to take part in these \r\ncelebrations, in the same spirit of thanks and solidarity \r\nas the invitation that we extended to our independence \r\ncelebrations in 2002. We were not alone on that \r\nimportant date, and we continue to benefit from the \r\ngenerosity and support of nations throughout the \r\nworld. We are pleased to continue to strengthen and to \r\nexpand our ties of solidarity with friendly countries \r\nfrom various continents with different stories, different \r\nbeliefs and different ethnicities.  \r\n We are trying to be more active in our region and \r\nin the world, showing that it is possible to leave \r\nbehind, or to close, a period of conflict, even a long \r\nperiod, and to focus our energy on humanist ideals of \r\npolitical and social tolerance for the dignity and \r\ndevelopment of all. That is why we are intent on \r\njoining the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. \r\nTimor-Leste desires peace and shares the spirit of \r\ncooperation that led to the creation of that regional \r\norganization. We are also continuing to build upon our \r\nrelationships with our friends in Asia and the Pacific, \r\nA/66/PV.21  \r\n \r\n11-51197 14 \r\n \r\nincluding China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and \r\nNew Zealand, among others.  \r\n Timor-Leste is strongly committed as well to its \r\nmembership in the Community of Portuguese-speaking \r\nCountries which consists of nations and peoples from \r\nthe four corners of the world. We are observers in the \r\nPacific Islands Forum and we have a good relationship \r\nwith the European Union, which provides significant \r\nsupport and assistance. Next week I will make an \r\nofficial visit to Portugal, which shares ties with Timor-\r\nLeste that go back hundreds of years. Despite being in \r\none of the worst economic and financial crises in its \r\nhistory, exacerbated by the global and European \r\nfinancial crisis, Portugal remains a steadfast partner of \r\nTimor-Leste and has strengthened its bilateral \r\ncooperation in several areas. The first Timorese \r\nmilitary personnel are being trained in Portugal and \r\nwill be integrated into the Portuguese contingent that \r\nwill participate in the peacekeeping mission in \r\nLebanon under the United Nations Interim Force in \r\nLebanon. \r\n Timor-Leste is one of the 50 States classified as a \r\nleast developed country (LDC). We are also called a \r\nfragile State. That classification stems from \r\ninstitutional, political, economic, social and other \r\nfactors. In April last year we had the honour to host an \r\ninternational dialogue in Dili on the subject of “Peace-\r\nbuilding and State-building” with the participation of \r\nLDCs from the group we call the Group of Seven Plus \r\n(g7+), which is at present chaired by Timor-Leste. This \r\ngroup is a forum that allows fragile and post-conflict \r\ncountries to come together and talk about themselves, \r\nlearn from each other’s experiences and create new \r\npossibilities for facing the future with determination \r\nand optimism. The g7+ consists of 17 member \r\ncountries covering around 350 million people from \r\nAfrica, Asia, the Caribbean and the Pacific. The g7+ \r\nalso aims to improve the transparency and efficiency of \r\ninternational aid. The group is a mechanism for \r\ndialogue with each other and with the international \r\ncommunity about aid programmes and aid \r\neffectiveness. It should also be noted that fragile States \r\nrequire a period of transition with greater flexibility in \r\ndonor funding, instead of a policy of one size fits all, \r\nwhich can only interfere with the individual processes \r\nof each country. \r\n A high-level forum on development assistance is \r\nscheduled to take place next November in Pusan, South \r\nKorea. In that forum we will evaluate progress made in \r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals and will \r\nalso set new action frameworks. Under-developed \r\ncountries focus on meeting Millennium Development \r\nGoals every day, although it will be very difficult to \r\nmeet them by 2015. These countries face daily \r\nchallenges and difficulties in pursuing objectives to \r\ncombat poor administration and reduce poverty. \r\nDemocracy is a process and not an end in itself. Most \r\nof these countries are young democracies and have the \r\narduous task of changing the mindset of their people \r\nscarred by conflict. They must also deal with internal \r\nand external pressures that prevent them from paying \r\ntoo much attention to a series of universal criteria that \r\nare too idealized or standardized and not adjusted to \r\nthe actual situation of those countries. Understanding \r\nthe specific circumstances of each developing country \r\nand motivating the people to cultivate a spirit of hope \r\nand belonging will surely yield more results than \r\nforcing situations where receiving countries cannot \r\nimmediately meet the conditions imposed on them, \r\nthereby being put in a situation of moral, \r\npsychological, political and financial dependency, \r\nwhich does little to help them move towards \r\ndevelopment.  \r\n It is in that context of balanced and sustained \r\ndevelopment that I raise the issue of aid effectiveness. \r\nPoor countries also need a message of confidence, \r\nsince all they hear about is transparency and \r\naccountability. Still, the international economic \r\nrecession proves that the lessons taught by those with \r\nall the power, the knowledge and the money may not \r\nalways be the best. Therefore, I believe that we must \r\nall — poor countries and donor countries — change \r\nour attitudes. The United Nations has a vital role to \r\nplay here in terms of correcting and adjusting aid to \r\nactual and local realities.  \r\n We remain divided into North and South, into \r\nrich and poor, into Westerners and Arabs, into Asians \r\nand Africans, into Muslims and non-Muslims, and into \r\nChristians and non-Christians. Even today many of the \r\npeople who hold or influence power still have a Cold \r\nWar mentality. We need a new world order that is also \r\npolitical and economic, where conflicts and discord are \r\nreplaced by dialogue, where democracy is used to give \r\nvoice to the weak and vulnerable and where aid and \r\nsolidarity are used appropriately to mitigate the \r\nsuffering of the people. We have to give voice to the \r\npeoples of the world and listen to their aspirations. \r\nOnly through dialogue can we fight violence, which \r\n A/66/PV.21\r\n \r\n15 11-51197 \r\n \r\ncauses all kinds of misery. Only through peaceful \r\nsolutions can we prevent the massive destruction \r\ncaused by war.  \r\n The people of Timor-Leste, who have \r\nexperienced the pain caused by destruction and \r\nviolence, hope that their brothers and sisters \r\nthroughout the world who are suffering today because \r\nof conflicts may find peace. However, as everyone \r\nsays, peace is not only the absence of war, true peace \r\ncomes from within, the peace of spirit. Therefore, I \r\nappeal to the United States of America to demonstrate \r\ngreatness of spirit and humanism and eliminate the \r\nCuban embargo that has existed for more than \r\n25 years. \r\n Lastly, in 1991 I was still in the mountains \r\nleading the resistance when the Western Sahara \r\nreferendum was first proposed. I was in prison in 1995 \r\nwhen Yasser Arafat, Shimon Perez and Yitzak Rabin \r\nreceived the Nobel Peace Prize. Two Timor-Leste \r\ncitizens also received the Nobel Peace Prize, and \r\nIndonesia accepted the referendum result, just as North \r\nSudan did. \r\n We hope that the people of Western Sahara and \r\nPalestine can find more viable, fair and realistic ways \r\nthrough mechanisms that will lead them effectively to \r\nthe resolution of their conflicts, which, sadly, are \r\nbecoming the oldest conflicts in the world. We all need \r\nto reform our mindsets, attitudes and institutions. We \r\nall must start these reforms within our own nations, but \r\nI should like to suggest a common challenge here, that \r\nthese reforms begin right here in this building at the \r\nheadquarters of the United Nations. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPrime Minister of the Democratic Republic of Timor-\r\nLeste for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Kay Rala Xanana Gusmão, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Stavros Lambrinidis, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Hellenic Republic. \r\n Mr. Lambrinidis (Greece) (spoke in French): I \r\nshould like to thank the outgoing President of the \r\nsixty-fifth session of the General Assembly, Mr. Joseph \r\nDeiss of Switzerland, and congratulate Mr. Nassir \r\nAbdulaziz Al-Nasser of Qatar on his election as \r\nPresident of the sixty-sixth session of the General \r\nAssembly. May I also express my gratitude for the \r\nefforts and leadership of the Secretary-General, \r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon, who has skilfully guided our \r\nOrganization in these difficult and demanding times. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n Two world wars taught humanity the necessity to \r\ninfuse national relations with respect for a few simple \r\nyet powerful ideals. That is what the United Nations is \r\nall about — respect for peace and good-neighbourly \r\nrelations; respect for the rule of law and the \r\ninternational justice system; and respect for the \r\nfundamental right of every person on this planet to \r\nhave a chance for a better life. The United Nations is \r\nwhat we, its Member States, make of it. We are the \r\ndriving force behind its accomplishments. We are the \r\nreason behind any of its failures. The United Nations is \r\nwhere we meet and agree or disagree on global \r\ncooperation, and when we agree, humanity becomes \r\nstronger. \r\n Today the United Nations is leading vital \r\ninternational cooperation in tackling climate change \r\nand desertification. There is also the challenge of \r\nnon-communicable diseases, which hinder \r\nmacroeconomic development and keep the bottom \r\nbillions of people locked in chronic poverty. \r\nUnregulated migration is putting huge pressure on \r\nsome countries, including Greece, as a result of — \r\neven to the further detriment of — the low level of \r\ndevelopment in the countries of origin, poverty and \r\nwars. There is the crucial contribution of the United \r\nNations and its Human Rights Council on human rights \r\nissues, a contribution that can grow with a stronger \r\nmandate for the Human Rights Council. Greece is \r\nstanding for election to the Council for the 2012 term \r\nand deeply values the support of every single one of its \r\npartners in that effort.  \r\n Perhaps the most overarching responsibilities of \r\nthe United Nations lie in the area of peace and security, \r\nfor without peace and security it is much more \r\ndifficult, if not impossible, to pursue the myriad other \r\ngoals of the Organization. Those goals include \r\nensuring nuclear security, combating terrorism and \r\ncombating piracy. They also include managing crises \r\nas they arise, as in the recent case of Libya, and \r\nworking together with our partners in the international \r\ncommunity to establish and keep peace. This also \r\nA/66/PV.21  \r\n \r\n11-51197 16 \r\n \r\nmeans, as I said earlier, fostering good-neighbourly \r\nrelations the world over. \r\n Just as we need to work together as global \r\npartners to face the challenges of our time and the \r\nchallenges of the future, each of us also has a role to \r\nplay in a given region. Greece’s immediate region is \r\nSouth-East Europe, the Balkans. Greece has a vision \r\nfor peace, stability and cooperation in our region. Its \r\nkey component is the European perspective of our \r\nregion as a whole and of our individual neighbours. To \r\nthis end, two years ago Greece launched Agenda 2014, \r\nwhich is aimed at revitalizing our neighbours’ efforts \r\nto realize European aspirations, on the one hand, while \r\nalso re-igniting the European Union’s vision of \r\nwelcoming the countries of the Balkans into the \r\nEuropean family. Indeed, creating a European \r\nneighbourhood of peace and cooperation in south-\r\neastern Europe should be our collective goal, and that \r\nis because peace and cooperation are anything but a \r\nforegone conclusion in the Balkans. Recent history, \r\noften bloody history, makes that abundantly clear. \r\n There are still pending issues that need to be \r\nresolved. One serious obstacle to the consolidation of \r\npeace and security in our neighbourhood is the Kosovo \r\nissue. Recent progress in the European Union-brokered \r\ntalks between Belgrade and Pristina gives some cause \r\nfor optimism in the wake of the tensions we saw in the \r\nregion over the summer. Those tensions remain. They \r\nstill need to be dealt with and defused. Greece wishes \r\nto facilitate the process of reconciliation and \r\ncompromise. It wishes to foster the kind of \r\nunderstanding that our neighbourhood needs on the \r\npath to its common future in the European family. That \r\nis a policy that works. Regional cooperation platforms, \r\nthe South-East European Cooperation Process, the \r\nBlack Sea Economic Coordination Organization, the \r\nregional Cooperation Council and others are bringing \r\nus closer together as partners. Serbia has made \r\nimpressive progress on its path to the European Union, \r\nprogress that must be recognized without question \r\nmarks. So has Montenegro. Bosnia and Herzegovina \r\nmust be supported in its efforts towards reconciliation, \r\nunity and progress. Albania is in the process of \r\novercoming internal divisions and returning to the path \r\nof reforms under specific European Union criteria. \r\nCroatia’s success story gives impetus to the entire \r\nenlargement process for the Balkans. \r\n Another issue that needs our attention is that of \r\nthe name of the Former Yugoslav Republic of \r\nMacedonia, which is not really and has never been a \r\nname issue per se, but instead a sincere effort to ensure \r\nthat in our volatile region we put behind us, once and \r\nfor all, notions of irredentism, of attempting to rewrite \r\nhistory and borders, so that our children can be raised \r\nnot with suspicions and bitterness towards each other \r\nbut with friendship and hope for living next to each \r\nother. Greece believes, and has repeatedly stated, that \r\nthe solution lies in a fair compromise, in a name with a \r\ngeographical qualifier since Macedonia is a geographic \r\nregion that overlaps the territory of more than one \r\ncountry, and that this name must be used in relation to \r\neveryone, erga omnes. We want to resolve this issue so \r\nthat we can finally realize the huge potential of our \r\nrelationship on the basis of openness, honesty and \r\ntrust. It is high time to reach a successful and mutually \r\nbeneficial conclusion. As I have often said, this should \r\nbe a time to write history, not to keep trying to rewrite \r\nit. \r\n South-East Europe is only one side of Greece’s \r\nneighbourhood. In our southern neighbourhood, the \r\neastern Mediterranean, we have witnessed the \r\nawakening of people’s desire for democracy, the hope \r\nfor a better future. We have witnessed the Arab Spring. \r\nOur proximity to the region and to the countries there \r\nthat have been swept by calls for change is reflected in \r\nour active presence in the region. Add to that a long-\r\nstanding tradition of relations of trust and friendship \r\nwith the Arab world and Members can see why Greece \r\nhas embraced a vital role in these developments.  \r\n In Libya we conducted unprecedented \r\nevacuations for tens of thousands of non-Libyans, \r\nprovided ground support for the implementation of the \r\nLibya no-fly zone, mediated the release of European \r\nmilitary personnel early in the crisis and established a \r\ndiplomatic presence early on in Benghazi to liaise with \r\nthe National Transitional Council. We are now offering \r\ninfrastructure on Crete as a staging area for the efforts \r\nto deal with the humanitarian situation in Libya. The \r\nimportance we attach to developments in Libya, Egypt, \r\nTunisia and throughout the region derives from the \r\npoint I made earlier. Without peace and security one \r\ndoes not have cooperation, the cooperation needed for \r\ndevelopment and for improving the day-to-day lives of \r\nthe people. \r\n We, as the international community, have an \r\nobligation to help our southern neighbours achieve \r\ntheir goal of democracy, of having a voice in their \r\naffairs and of hope and future prosperity. I am talking \r\n A/66/PV.21\r\n \r\n17 11-51197 \r\n \r\nabout the same rights that the Syrian people have also \r\nbeen demanding for months, the rights that their own \r\nleadership is at present violently denying them. The \r\nArab world does not need new hegemons who see the \r\npresent turmoil as an opportunity to promote self-\r\nserving agendas or for establishing new spheres of \r\ngeostrategic influence or economic power. It needs \r\ngenuine friends who see Arabs as equals and who are \r\nwilling selflessly to assist the Arab world in its \r\ntransition to democracy and true self-determination. \r\nGreece and the European Union, under the guidance of \r\nthe United Nations, can and must play that role. \r\n Nowhere is the lack of peace and security more \r\npronounced and more chronic than with regard to the \r\nPalestinian question. Greece supports unequivocally \r\nPalestine’s right to statehood. It is now our \r\nresponsibility, the responsibility of every Member State \r\nof the United Nations, to respect the Palestinian \r\ndecision to request membership and, more importantly, \r\nto turn this into an opportunity that will jump-start \r\nnew, direct negotiations. Palestine has a right to exist \r\nfinally as an independent State, just as Israel — let us \r\nnot forget — has an equal right to exist in full and \r\nuncompromised security. The European Union, on its \r\nown account and within the Quartet, has a crucial role \r\nto play in this effort. Greece will continue to engage in \r\ndialogue with both sides and support Catherine Ashton \r\nand the European Union’s efforts within the Quartet \r\nand with the parties. \r\n Within this context of regional tension and \r\nvolatility but also great potential hope, it should be \r\nself-evident that we need to avoid adding still greater \r\ntensions in the eastern Mediterranean region, which is \r\nwhy we are deeply concerned by the recent threats and \r\nhostile actions against the Republic of Cyprus by our \r\nneighbour Turkey, in violation of international law. As \r\nthe European Union, the United States, Russia and \r\nothers have already stated, Turkey’s threats and actions \r\nover the past few days and weeks are contrary to \r\ninternational law and they must cease. We believe that \r\nthe path of tension is a wrong and dangerous path. \r\nInstead of threats our region needs strong countries that \r\ncan work together to promote stability, cooperation and \r\ngood-neighbourly relations among all, and always \r\nwithin the confines of international law.  \r\n That is the hope and example that we can give to \r\na region and that a region expects of us, which is why \r\nGreece is committed to the peaceful path of \r\nexploratory talks with Turkey for the delimitation of a \r\ncontinental shelf, failing which we believe we should \r\nsubmit the issue to the International Court of Justice \r\nfor resolution. We expect Turkey to refrain from \r\nactions that undermine that spirit of cooperation. That \r\nis why we strongly support the United Nations sanction \r\ntalks currently under way between President \r\nChristofias of Cyprus and Mr. Eroglu, talks aimed at \r\nthe reunification of Cyprus as a bizonal, bicommunal \r\nfederation and the ending of Turkey’s illegal \r\noccupation in accordance, with United Nations \r\nresolutions and European Union law. \r\n Finally, economic development and fair \r\ndistribution of wealth are key prerequisites for long-\r\nterm stability and security. My country, in the midst of \r\nits own worst financial and economic crisis in recent \r\nhistory, has not only not shut itself in its shell but \r\nremains a leading investor in a region, especially in the \r\nwestern Balkans, contributing to the creation of tens of \r\nthousands of jobs. Internally we are overhauling our \r\neconomy by investing in sustainable growth and in \r\nGreece’s competitive advantage sectors, including \r\ngreen energy, shipping, tourism, sustainable agriculture \r\nand high-tech infrastructure. Externally, our businesses \r\nare becoming even more outward-looking. The \r\neconomic integration of our region along the growth \r\naxes I have described, and other complementary ones, \r\nis certain to multiply its economic potential. It is thus \r\ncertain further to enhance the peaceful integration and \r\ncooperation of all of its people.  \r\n It has often been said that every crisis is also an \r\nopportunity. If that is true, then our region, riddled as it \r\nhas been for decades with big and small crises, is \r\narguably today the region in the world that harbours \r\nthe greatest opportunities for peace, growth and \r\nstability. It is in our hands to make this happen. Let us \r\nbegin. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Nickolay Mladenov, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Bulgaria. \r\n Mr. Mladenov (Bulgaria): Let me begin by \r\npraising His Excellency Mr. Nassir Abdelaziz \r\nAl-Nasser for his steady stewardship as the President \r\nof the sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly. In \r\nhis work he can count on the constructive engagement \r\nof the Bulgarian delegation. Allow me also personally \r\nto praise him for the theme he has chosen for this \r\nsession. I also take this opportunity to pay tribute to his \r\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss, for his \r\nA/66/PV.21  \r\n \r\n11-51197 18 \r\n \r\noutstanding leadership of the previous session’s busy \r\nagenda. Last but not least, let me congratulate the \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, on his \r\nreappointment to the helm of the United Nations. He \r\nhas proven himself to be a diligent, hard-working \r\nleader who believes strongly in consensus and \r\nharmony, qualities that the United Nations needs now \r\nin its top administrator and will undoubtedly need even \r\nmore in years to come. \r\n I begin by welcoming the work of delegations at the \r\nUnited Nations High-level Meeting on non-communicable \r\ndiseases. Cancer, cardiovascular diseases, chronic \r\nrespiratory diseases and diabetes are now responsible \r\nfor more deaths than all other causes combined. \r\nBulgaria welcomes the negotiated final document. \r\nMore than 80 per cent of cardiovascular and diabetes \r\ndeaths, almost 90 per cent of deaths from chronic \r\nobstructive pulmonary disease and more than two \r\nthirds of all cancer deaths occur in low- and middle-\r\nincome countries. Bulgaria also particularly welcomes \r\nthe High-level Meeting on nuclear safety and security. \r\nThe effects of nuclear accidents have no respect for \r\nnational borders. To adequately safeguard our people \r\nwe must have firm international consensus and action, \r\nas well as agreement on stringent international safety \r\nstandards.  \r\n Today we stand on the doorstep of historic \r\nchange in the Middle East, the scale of which can only \r\nbe compared to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the \r\nsweeping transformation of Central and Eastern Europe \r\nafter the end of communism. Both processes are quite \r\ndifferent but share a fundamental similarity — people \r\nhave come out of the bondage of fear. Although the \r\ncircumstances in each country are different, the root \r\ncauses for what is happening in the Middle East are \r\nquite similar. Corrupt leadership breeds dissent, and \r\nwith no democratic process in place, that dissent pours \r\nout on to the streets. Young people want to be engaged \r\nin the future of their countries, not forced into a world \r\nof virtual reality by frowning aging dictators. Millions \r\nof people who live on the brink of poverty and see a \r\nprivileged few reap the benefits of economic freedom \r\nwill demand fair economic opportunities for all. \r\n Add to that the feeling of revival and the demand \r\nof millions of young Arabs to be respected, and you \r\nhave the makings of a revolution of Arab dignity and \r\nself-respect, an historic revolution indeed. As change \r\nswept across the Middle East and North Africa, some \r\nleaders cringed in fear, others embraced it. Those who \r\nopposed their people are no longer in positions of \r\npower, and their countries are moving on and looking \r\nto democratic elections. Those who embraced change \r\nhave initiated far-reaching reforms and responded to \r\nthe legitimate demands of their people. His Majesty \r\nKing Abdullah II of Jordan and His Majesty King \r\nMohammed VI of Morocco should to be commended \r\nfor their vision and willingness to reform. They have \r\nshown the way forward.  \r\n At the same time, the international community \r\nhas been appalled by the developments in Syria. \r\nInstead of responding to the legitimate demands of the \r\nSyrian people for the fulfilment of promised reforms, \r\nthe Government cracked down violently on protesters. \r\nThe protesters did not have unrealistic demands. They \r\ndid not ask for anything out of the ordinary. According \r\nto the United Nations more than 2,600 people have \r\nbeen killed since March. The Government in Damascus \r\nquestions those numbers. Even if only one person had \r\nbeen killed, it would have been one person too many.  \r\n The responsibility for repression lies squarely \r\nwith the authorities and no one else. I use this \r\nopportunity to call on President Al-Assad, who has \r\nmade many promises to his people and the \r\ninternational community, to come out from the \r\nshadows, change the Constitution, dismantle the \r\nmachinery of repression and immediately call for \r\ninternationally supervised elections. The people of \r\nSyria have the right to elect their own Government and \r\nhold it accountable. The time for transition has come. \r\n At this session we welcomed the 193rd Member \r\nof the United Nations. Our hearts go out to the people \r\nof South Sudan, who have struggled for independence, \r\nand we commend the visionary leadership of their \r\nGovernment for paving the way for their independence \r\nin a peaceful manner. We also welcomed the new \r\nrepresentatives of a free Libya, free from the \r\noppression of the Al-Qadhafi dictatorship. It was at the \r\ngates of Benghazi in February that the international \r\ncommunity, acting on a mandate of the United Nations \r\nSecurity Council, acted swiftly to prevent a massacre \r\nand protect civilians against attacks from their own \r\nGovernment.  \r\n The people of Libya proved that they could stand \r\nup and defend their right to freedom. Our thoughts go \r\nout to the families of all those who lost their lives in \r\nthis struggle and fell victim to the crazed ambitions of \r\na deluded dictator. Bulgaria stands ready to assist the \r\n A/66/PV.21\r\n \r\n19 11-51197 \r\n \r\npeople of Libya in rebuilding their country. Our \r\nfriendship is strong and has been tested through the \r\nyears.  \r\n We know at first hand the brutality that \r\nAl-Qadhafi was capable of. The five Bulgarian nurses \r\nand a doctor who spent eight years of their lives in a \r\nLibyan jail, much of it on death row, are still haunted \r\nby their tortures. Let me quote one of them who \r\nrecently said in an interview, “We died every time the \r\ncell door opened.” Now safely back home, they need to \r\nbe able to close that chapter of their nightmares. Like \r\nthe nurses, innocent victims of a brutal dictatorship, \r\nthe Libyan people do want to see justice, not revenge. \r\nSuch justice will be sought when the dictator and his \r\ncronies are brought before a court of law. \r\n No matter how successful we are individually we \r\ncannot truly enjoy the fruits of our own development if \r\nwe live in an insecure environment. Regional \r\ncooperation and good-neighbourly relations are vital \r\nfor the well-being of our countries and our societies. \r\nLet me turn briefly to the Balkans.  \r\n The European Union was created to make war \r\nimpossible in a continent that has seen at least a \r\ncentury of conflicts. Europe will not be whole and \r\ncomplete until our neighbours in the Balkans are part \r\nof our Union. It falls to us to say it loud and clear: to \r\nmake war impossible in the Balkans we must see all \r\ncountries that have emerged from the former \r\nYugoslavia as part of the European Union. That is our \r\nhistoric mission. It is our destiny. That is why we will \r\ncontinue to work tirelessly to remove the obstacles to \r\nEuropean Union enlargement in the Balkans, to \r\nstrengthen regional cooperation and develop good-\r\nneighbourly relations in a region that has seen too \r\nmuch division and violence.  \r\n With particular vigour, we will continue to \r\nencourage the European Union-facilitated dialogue \r\nbetween Belgrade and Pristina. Bulgaria welcomes the \r\npragmatic approach taken by both Kosovo and Serbia \r\nduring their first meetings. It is important that they \r\nbuild on this momentum and continue to engage in a \r\nconstructive and pragmatic manner. All must show \r\nrestraint and prevent the build-up of tension. That is \r\nvital for the security, prosperity and, ultimately, the \r\nEuropean perspective of the region. \r\n Bulgaria is a country that has a proud and \r\nturbulent history. Our history teaches us that nations \r\nare strong when their civic spirit is strong. It teaches us \r\nthat you must find pride not only in great historic \r\nbattles and ancient legends but in great feats of civic \r\nactivism, in standing up for your values and protecting \r\nyour neighbours. One such inspiring example is the \r\nfact that the Jews of Bulgaria survived the Second \r\nWorld War because hundreds of religious and \r\ncommunity leaders, politicians, ordinary men and \r\nwomen, stood up and refused to be part of Hitler’s \r\nmadness. My country today is the product of the \r\ntraditions of Christians, Jews and Muslims, who all \r\nform the fabric of the Bulgarian nation. That is our \r\nrichness and makes us quite unique in the Balkans. \r\nThat is why we cannot remain uninterested in \r\ndevelopments in the Middle East, particularly with \r\nregard to the elusive prospects for peace between the \r\npeople of Israel and the people of Palestine. \r\n Over the course of the past year, we have seen the \r\ntireless efforts of the United States Administration and \r\nthe European Union High Representative for Foreign \r\nAffairs and Security Policy, Mrs. Catherine Ashton, \r\ntrying to find a way to resume direct negotiations. \r\nThose efforts, including the agreed Quartet statement \r\nof today, need to be applauded, encouraged and \r\nsupported by all. It was in the United Nations in 1947 \r\nthat the State of Israel was born. It was born as a home \r\nfor the Jewish people, a beacon of hope for a \r\ncommunity that had been persecuted and oppressed for \r\nthousands of years. Today, the landscape is changing. \r\nSlowly but surely the region is moving towards \r\ndemocracy. Democracy, accountable government and \r\nthe rule of law are ultimately in the long-term interests \r\nof all, Jews and Muslims, Arabs and Israelis. \r\n The Palestinian people have a right to a State of \r\ntheir own. Indeed we, the international community, \r\nhave an obligation to support the establishment of a \r\nviable and democratic Palestinian State in the West \r\nBank and Gaza: a Palestine that lives side-by-side with \r\nthe State of Israel, a Palestine that lives in security and \r\nmutual recognition with the State of Israel, a Palestine \r\nthat has secure borders based on the 1967 lines with \r\nmutually agreed land swaps.  \r\n Both Palestine, as the home of the Palestinian \r\npeople, and Israel, as the home of the Jewish people, \r\nmust guarantee that all ethnic and religious groups \r\nhave full rights and protection under law. Let me also \r\nmake one point very clear. To refuse the right of Israel \r\nto exist means to refuse the right of the Palestinian \r\npeople to have a State of their own. I can accept \r\ncriticism of the policies of any Government but I \r\nA/66/PV.21  \r\n \r\n11-51197 20 \r\n \r\ncannot stand idly by when the right of existence is \r\ndenied to anyone, no matter what their religion or \r\nethnicity is. To dismiss the importance of such policies \r\nwould mean to fail the very values of our civilization. \r\nBulgaria will never accept that, nor should any other \r\nnation in the global community. \r\n Bulgaria believes very strongly that the definitive \r\nsolution to peace can only come through direct \r\nnegotiations, but direct negotiations can resume only \r\non the basis of trust and a real understanding of the \r\nsecurity concerns and legitimate aspirations of both \r\nsides. Rebuilding trust between both parties is a \r\nprerequisite to resuming negotiations. Unilateral \r\naction, changing the realities on the ground cannot be a \r\nsubstitute for negotiations.  \r\n Obstacles should be overcome, and preconditions \r\nshould be removed. If the leaders of Palestine believe \r\nthat the settlement policy is an obstacle to peace, the \r\nleaders of Israel must refrain from such activities in \r\norder to give peace a chance. If the leaders of Israel \r\nbelieve that no preconditions to a final settlement \r\nshould be put in place, then the Palestinian leaders \r\nmust refrain from such actions to give peace a chance.  \r\n Bulgaria recognized the Palestinian State in 1988. \r\nWe hold our friendship with both Israel and the \r\nPalestinian people dear. That is why we urge the \r\nimmediate resumption of negotiations as the only road \r\nto peace. Bringing both sides to the negotiating table \r\nremains our top priority. I am sure that the United \r\nStates, working in concert with the European Union, \r\ncan facilitate this process based on a vision outlined by \r\nPresident Obama. \r\n Allow me to turn briefly to my delegation’s \r\nvision for the kind of leadership, the kind of United \r\nNations we need for the next decade. An Organization \r\ncreated by 51 Member States functions today with \r\n193 Members. \r\n In order for the United Nations to be adequate to \r\nthe challenges facing it today its institutions need to be \r\nreformed, first and foremost in the composition of the \r\nUnited Nations main body that guarantees international \r\npeace and security. We must build on the progress \r\nachieved so far in the negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform and move the process to a more results-oriented \r\nphase. Bulgaria considers that enlargement of the Council’s \r\ntwo categories of permanent and non-permanent members \r\nis one option that enjoys the support of a considerable \r\nnumber of delegations. The increase in the number of \r\nnon-permanent seats should provide for a just \r\nrepresentation of the Eastern European Group, whose \r\nmembership has more than doubled over the past two \r\ndecades. \r\n Transparency is impossible without \r\naccountability. First, the United Nations must be \r\naccountable to its Member States through a continued \r\nstriving to improve management and the enforcement \r\nof strict budgetary discipline, especially in the current \r\nperiod of economic turmoil. We, the Member States, \r\nmust also be accountable to the United Nations by \r\nfulfilling all our commitments, including by paying our \r\nfinancial contributions to the Organization fully, \r\nunconditionally and on time — a principle that \r\nBulgaria upholds and adheres to closely. \r\n We all also need to be accountable to future \r\ngenerations for our actions. It is easy to speak of \r\nsustainable development, but at the moment we are not \r\neven remotely close to making it a reality. On the \r\ncontrary, the damage we have done to the planet’s \r\ngeology, climate and ecosystems for most of the last \r\ncentury is so significant that scientists are increasingly \r\nasserting that the human race has actually managed to \r\npush the Earth much faster than usual into a new, \r\npossibly more unstable and dangerous geological \r\nperiod. \r\n We need both wise and courageous leadership \r\nfrom the United Nations in our efforts to guarantee \r\npeace and security — wise, so as to avoid the \r\ntemptation to use force when it seems to get results \r\nfaster than mediation and negotiation, and courageous, \r\nto take responsibility when the use of force is a must. \r\nThe United Nations will benefit much from \r\nstrengthening its cooperation with regional security \r\norganizations. The cooperation with the North Atlantic \r\nTreaty Organization in Afghanistan is an excellent \r\nexample. International support has to continue beyond \r\n2014 for Afghanistan. We were all saddened by the \r\nbrutal murder of a great Afghan leader, former \r\nPresident Rabbani. His work must inspire us to \r\ncontinue supporting the Afghan Government’s efforts \r\nto achieve reconciliation and reintegration.  \r\n It is high time for bold and decisive actions in the \r\nfield of disarmament and non-proliferation as well. It is \r\nthe legal and moral obligation of all of us to honour the \r\ncommitments undertaken under the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the \r\noutcome document of the 2010 Review Conference. A \r\n A/66/PV.21\r\n \r\n21 11-51197 \r\n \r\nstrengthened and robust NPT regime is in the interest \r\nof all States, especially with the growing risk of \r\nnon-State actors getting access to weapons of mass \r\ndestruction. All States Parties, including the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea are bound by \r\nthe NPT regime. Leaving the NPT should not be \r\nwithout consequences. Cooperation with the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is also \r\nessential. As long as Iran continues not to provide \r\ngreater transparency with regard to of its nuclear \r\nactivities, the concerns of the international community \r\nwill remain valid. Full compliance with Security \r\nCouncil resolutions and with the provisions of the \r\nIAEA safeguards agreement is crucial for a diplomatic \r\nsolution of this case. \r\n The sad anniversary of the 11 September 2001 \r\nattacks in New York, which we commemorated this \r\nyear, the more recent tragic events in Oslo, the terrorist \r\nattacks in Mumbai and other cities of the world prove \r\nthat terrorism is a global cancer that does not  \r\n \r\ndiscriminate against developed or developing countries \r\nand societies. Its eradication requires decisive action. \r\nThe successful conclusion of the negotiations on the \r\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism \r\nhas Bulgaria’s full support.  \r\n I began my statement by focusing on the \r\nchallenge of tackling non-communicable diseases. \r\nHuman suffering caused by various illnesses is further \r\nexacerbated owing to the effects of the series of global \r\ncrises in food, finance and energy and the threats \r\nassociated with climate change. Taken together, these \r\nand other new challenges impede progress towards the \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals. \r\nWe must be twice as vigilant as we have been until \r\nnow. Our world today faces challenges that will shape \r\nits tomorrow. We need to be able to meet these \r\nchallenges in a bold manner, with a clear vision for the \r\nfuture, and tackle them together as a global community \r\nof nations. \r\n  The meeting rose at 9.15 p.m. \r\n"
