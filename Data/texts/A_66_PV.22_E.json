I assure him of my \r\ndelegation’s full support during his tenure. Let me also \r\npay fitting tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Joseph Deiss, \r\nfor the commendable manner in which he led the work \r\nof the General Assembly during the sixty-fifth session.  \r\n Mr. Ban Ki-moon also deserves our heart \r\ncongratulations on his reappointment as Secretary-\r\nGeneral. His unanimous re-election was a true \r\nreflection of the confidence that all Member States \r\nhave in him. \r\n I also wish to express my profound joy at \r\nwitnessing the Republic of South Sudan join the ranks \r\nof the Members of the United Nations. We welcome \r\nthis new Member and extend our hand in friendship. \r\n This sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly \r\nonce again provides us with an opportunity to reflect \r\non the overall situation in the world. The world \r\ncontinues to experience numerous challenges. The \r\ntarget date for the attainment of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals is fast approaching, yet the world \r\ncontinues to be overwhelmed by unending hurdles on \r\nthe path towards their achievement.  \r\n Despite globalization, the least developed \r\ncountries are yet to be fully integrated into global \r\nmarkets. Rapid environmental degradation, \r\ncompounded by the effects of climate change, \r\ncontinues to adversely affect ecosystems, agriculture, \r\nwater resources and energy supplies. HIV and AIDS \r\nhave not relented in decimating whole nations. The \r\npromotion of the principles of democracy and good \r\ngovernance, the protection of fundamental human \r\nrights, and the abuse of power in international relations \r\ncontinue to present challenges. \r\n As if this were not enough, terrorism continues to \r\ntorment us. Along with the other challenges, this is a \r\nfight that we collectively must win. Terrorism is a \r\nA/66/PV.22  \r\n \r\n11-51360 2 \r\n \r\ntransnational problem that cannot be left to one State \r\nalone to confront. All Member States must cooperate in \r\naddressing and eliminating this menace. The biggest \r\nchallenge that we face in the post-Cold War era is to \r\nensure that terrorists do not lay their hands on weapons \r\nof mass destruction.  \r\n In this regard, we reiterate our call for the total \r\nelimination of all nuclear weapons. We urge the \r\nnuclear weapon States to remain faithful to their \r\ncommitments under the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). We \r\nfurther call on those Member States that have not \r\njoined the NPT to do so without further delay. \r\nHowever, it would be illogical to ask non-nuclear \r\nStates to shun the proliferation of nuclear weapons, \r\nwhile States that possess them continue to perfect new \r\ngenerations of such weapons and to threaten their use \r\nat the slightest opportunity. \r\n Some States Members of this global Organization \r\ncontinue to experience either internal or external \r\nconflicts of significant proportions. The international \r\ncommunity has not been consistent in its approach to \r\nthe management of these conflicts. In some countries, \r\nthe international community, acting through the \r\nSecurity Council, has been swift and decisive in \r\nintervening militarily. In other countries, the same \r\ninternational community has preferred mediation, and \r\nin yet still others it has turned a blind eye, at best \r\nleaving the mantle to some of its members to \r\nunilaterally threaten the imposition of sanctions. \r\n It is against this background that we welcome the \r\ntheme of our general debate, “The role of mediation in \r\nthe settlement of disputes by peaceful means”. Indeed, \r\nthe relevance and appropriateness of this theme at the \r\npresent juncture in international relations is beyond \r\ndoubt. In addressing this theme, we start from the \r\npremise that the peaceful settlement of disputes \r\nthrough mediation lies at the heart of the work of the \r\nUnited Nations. However, the United Nations has not \r\nsufficiently used mediation as a tool for conflict \r\nresolution.  \r\n The United Nations is charged with the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and order through \r\nthe Security Council. Consequently, the Council is \r\nexpected to take a leading role in the settlement of \r\ndisputes through mediation. In so doing, the Council \r\nmust adopt the multilateral approach. Such an approach \r\nis the only way to guarantee transparency, impartiality \r\nand ownership of the process by the general \r\nmembership of the United Nations. Mediation must \r\nhave as its priority the peaceful settlement of disputes, \r\nthe reconciliation of the parties and the future \r\nsustainability of peace and stability. Peace that is \r\nimposed without consulting all parties to conflicts \r\ncannot be sustainable. Bias and abuse of military \r\npower to influence the outcome of mediation in \r\nconflicts will quickly erode the credibility of the \r\nUnited Nations as an honest mediator and will \r\nreinforce perceptions of ulterior motives. \r\n The Kingdom of Lesotho is a strong believer in \r\nthe principle of subsidiarity. It is common knowledge \r\nthat the primary role in the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security reposes in the Security \r\nCouncil. However, cooperation and coordination \r\nbetween the Council and regional organizations, in \r\nterms of Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter, is \r\nkey to resolving conflicts speedily. The United Nations \r\nmust empower and support the efforts of regional \r\nstructures and organizations, which in all cases have a \r\ncomparative advantage in mediating. \r\n However, the Security Council can better \r\ndischarge this function only if it is more representative \r\nof the membership of the United Nations. A more \r\nrepresentative Security Council will take into account \r\nall our aspirations, and its decisions will command \r\nlegitimacy. Consequently, we continue to call for the \r\nearly and comprehensive reform of the Security \r\nCouncil in order to make it more representative of the \r\nMember States. It is simply baffling, if not appalling, \r\nto see how this all-important issue of Security Council \r\nreform is being deliberately stymied. \r\n The settlement of conflicts through mediation has \r\nbeen put to the test, and its successes are well recorded \r\nin the annals of history. The peaceful settlement \r\nthrough mediation of the conflict in the Republic of \r\nKenya in 2007 is a typical example. It should be \r\nrecalled that, in Kenya, a group of eminent persons \r\nfrom Africa worked together with the United Nations \r\nto broker a peaceful solution to the political stalemate \r\nthat resulted from the disputed parliamentary and \r\npresidential elections of 2007. That solution resulted in \r\nthe formation of an all-inclusive and stable \r\nGovernment.  \r\n Secondly, a specific subregional mediation by the \r\nSouthern Africa Development Community yielded \r\nfruitful results in Zimbabwe, as did that of the African \r\n A/66/PV.22\r\n \r\n3 11-51360 \r\n \r\nUnion (AU) in Burundi. Furthermore, we witnessed a \r\nsuccessfully mediated solution bring an end to Africa’s \r\nlongest civil war in the Sudan.  \r\n The world rejoiced together with the people of \r\nSouth Sudan in July 2011 upon their attainment of \r\nindependence as a sovereign nation. The remarkable \r\nmediation efforts of the African Union, with the \r\nsupport of the entire international community, helped \r\nin consolidating peace in South Sudan. Indeed, the \r\nmediation efforts are continuing in that sister country \r\nto ensure the maintenance of peace in the post-conflict \r\nperiod. \r\n It is our humble but considered opinion that, \r\nwhere mediation has been given a chance, lives have \r\nbeen saved. The cost in resources, be they financial or \r\nhuman, has been minimal, and the destruction of \r\ninfrastructure avoided. Above all, reconciliation \r\nbetween the warring factions has been realized. \r\n Strangely, and despite having mediation at its \r\ndisposal, the Security Council has at times preferred \r\nmilitary intervention. I may also add that, at times, \r\nsome members of the international community have \r\nunilaterally engaged in military interventions. \r\nWhenever military intervention has been preferred, it \r\nhas not enjoyed the support of the general membership \r\nof the United Nations. Needless to say, the impact of \r\nmilitary intervention in conflicts is catastrophic for \r\ninnocent civilians, and it destroys infrastructure and \r\nthe economies of countries.  \r\n In this regard, Libya may be used as a case study. \r\nThe African Union developed a comprehensive road \r\nmap that would have led to a peaceful settlement of the \r\nLibyan crisis by the Libyan people themselves. Sadly, \r\nwe witnessed the deliberate marginalization of the AU \r\nin the resolution of that crisis. Military intervention \r\nwas hastily adopted as an option, and the results of this \r\nkind of intervention are a matter of record for all to \r\nsee, and indeed will be with us for a long time to come. \r\n Nevertheless, the opportunity for all stakeholders \r\nto work together on consolidating peace in Libya has \r\nnot eluded us. The African Union road map for peace \r\nremains as relevant today as it was at the beginning of \r\nthe conflict. The United Nations and the African Union \r\nmust work together to bring about the consolidation of \r\npeace, national reconciliation and the establishment of \r\nan all-inclusive Government in Libya. The United \r\nNations, and not just a few countries with vested \r\ninterests, should take the lead in the reconstruction of \r\nthat country. This transparent and unbiased approach \r\nalone can ensure that there is no relapse into conflict in \r\nLibya. \r\n We must employ all assets at our disposal so as to \r\nfully exploit mediation as a tool for conflict prevention \r\nand resolution. The good offices of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in conflict prevention and resolution are an \r\ninstrument that may be very effective in mediating \r\nconflicts. Those offices must be strengthened and given \r\nthe human and other resources necessary to undertake \r\nmediation early enough to prevent conflicts and to deal \r\neffectively with those that are ongoing. In that regard, \r\nwe encourage the mediation efforts of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral towards the realization of a free and \r\nindependent Western Sahara. \r\n By the same token, we are convinced that the \r\nsolution to the settlement of the question of Palestine \r\nwill be attained through genuine mediation. The \r\nstalemate in the negotiations is a source of grave \r\nconcern to my country. We urge all the parties involved \r\nto resuscitate the negotiations between the State of \r\nPalestine and Israel without any further delay.  \r\n Similarly, we must explore the possibility of a \r\nmediated solution to the problem between the Republic \r\nof Cuba and the United States of America. The \r\ninternational community has been unanimous in its call \r\nfor the lifting of the economic and commercial \r\nembargo imposed upon Cuba, yet the problem persists. \r\nIndeed, Cuba, like all Member States, is entitled to \r\nfreedom of international trade and navigation. \r\n I conclude by pointing out that the crises we face \r\ntoday provide us with an opportunity for introspection \r\nand to chart the way forward. The obstacles that lie \r\nahead of us are not insurmountable. We must build a \r\nmore robust multilateral organization that is responsive \r\nto the modern-day needs of our peoples. A United \r\nNations that is able to work with its partners, including \r\nregional and subregional organizations, and all of its \r\nMember States will surely achieve much success in all \r\nof its endeavours. With renewed political will and \r\ndetermination, let us commit ourselves to the principles \r\nof mediation, as enshrined in the United Nations \r\nCharter, and to the peaceful settlement of all disputes \r\nand conflicts. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister and \r\nMinister for Defence of the Kingdom of Lesotho for \r\nthe statement he has just made. \r\nA/66/PV.22  \r\n \r\n11-51360 4 \r\n \r\n Mr. Pakalitha Bethuel Mosisili, Prime Minister \r\nand Minister for Defence of the Kingdom of \r\nLesotho, was escorted from the rostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Igor Lukšić, Prime Minister \r\nof Montenegro \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of Montenegro. \r\n Mr. Igor Lukšić, Prime Minister of Montenegro, \r\nwas escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Igor Lukšić, Prime \r\nMinister of Montenegro, and inviting him to address \r\nthe General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Lukšić (Montenegro): It is truly an honour \r\nfor me to address the Assembly at this global forum on \r\nbehalf of Montenegro and to reiterate our commitment \r\nto the principles and purposes of the United Nations \r\nand its Charter. \r\n I hereby wish to congratulate Mr. Nassir \r\nAbdulaziz Al-Nasser on his election as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-sixth session, and to \r\npledge the full support of the Montenegrin delegation \r\nas he carries out his demanding task. I also wish to \r\nthank Mr. Joseph Deiss for his valuable contribution \r\nand for strengthening the central role of the United \r\nNations in the global system during his presidency of \r\nthe General Assembly. \r\n I would like to congratulate Secretary-General \r\nBan Ki-moon on his reappointment, which I am certain \r\nwill result in the continuation of the reforms \r\nundertaken to build a more efficient and coherent \r\nUnited Nations system, and thus a safer and more \r\nprosperous world. \r\n Two months ago, Montenegro was replaced by \r\nSouth Sudan as the youngest Member of our \r\nOrganization. I wish to congratulate South Sudan on its \r\nindependence and its full-fledged membership in this \r\nbody. I truly believe that this milestone will contribute \r\nto security and serve as a good starting point for the \r\ndevelopment of good-neighbourly relations. \r\n We also support the democratization processes in \r\nNorth Africa, as well as the actions taken by the United \r\nNations and the African Union in Côte d’Ivoire, \r\nSomalia, the Congo and other parts of Africa to further \r\nthe overall progress of the entire continent. \r\n In the context of regional cooperation, \r\nMontenegro has contributed to overall stability in \r\nSouth-East Europe by chairing the most important \r\nregional initiatives, which has been a unique and rather \r\nchallenging experience for our Administration. \r\nMontenegro is committed to further developing mutual \r\nunderstanding and to strengthening all forms of \r\ncooperation in the future. Our success and that of the \r\ncountries of our region is the success of Europe, too. \r\n There is full consensus on the issue of European \r\nUnion integration in Montenegro. We are aware of the \r\nfact that this process requires continuous contributions \r\nfrom all stakeholders in our society. I am convinced \r\nthat we will have enough will, enthusiasm, capacity \r\nand energy to tackle it during the forthcoming period. \r\n I hope and believe that persistent and committed \r\nwork on the implementation of overall internal \r\nreforms, based on the seven key recommendations \r\nunderlined by the European Commission and \r\naccompanied by a policy of good-neighbourly relations \r\nand regional and international cooperation, represent a \r\nsolid foundation for the European Commission to \r\nrecommend, in its progress report to the European \r\nCouncil, that European Union (EU) accession talks be \r\nopened with Montenegro. \r\n We are taking firm steps forward on the \r\nEuro-Atlantic path and are currently preparing our \r\nsecond Annual National Programme as part of the \r\nNATO membership process. The progress of the \r\nWestern Balkan countries towards European and Euro-\r\nAtlantic integration is a key factor for regional stability \r\nand lays the groundwork for long-term economic \r\nprosperity. \r\n As a United Nations Member State and a reliable \r\ninternational partner, Montenegro is committed to the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. \r\nConsistent with its capacities, Montenegro actively \r\nparticipates in United Nations peacekeeping missions \r\nin Liberia and Cyprus, while also keeping in mind the \r\nregional security aspects. \r\n Through our participation in the NATO-led \r\nInternational Security Assistance Force, we directly \r\ncontribute to the efforts of the international community \r\nto ensure lasting peace in Afghanistan, while at the \r\nsame time supporting global efforts in the fight against \r\nterrorism. Through the EU ATALANTA mission, we \r\nhave joined the fight against piracy, the consequences \r\n A/66/PV.22\r\n \r\n5 11-51360 \r\n \r\nof which have also been suffered by Montenegrin \r\nsailors. \r\n Nevertheless, in order to prevent new conflicts \r\nthat have the potential to cause humanitarian disasters \r\nand put additional pressure on the already-burdened \r\npeacekeeping mission contingents, it is necessary to \r\nstrengthen preventive diplomacy and mediation \r\nactivities in cases of potential and initiated conflict. \r\nThe further development of United Nations capacities \r\nin this domain will contribute to the timely and \r\npeaceful resolution of conflicts before their \r\ncomplexities lead to serious international \r\nrepercussions. \r\n In that regard, Montenegro strongly supports the \r\npeaceful resolution of all existing conflicts, especially \r\nthose in the wider region of the Middle East and North \r\nAfrica. Priority should be given to the urgent signing \r\nof a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine, \r\nwhich is in their mutual interest. Only if both sides \r\nrefrain from violent actions will room be created for \r\nconfidence-building and a comprehensive solution to \r\nthe Middle East issue, making Israel a safe country, to \r\nthe benefit of both internationally recognized sides and \r\nmeeting the prerequisites for Palestine to establish a \r\nstable State.  \r\n Montenegro also supports all the Security \r\nCouncil resolutions and actions taken by the \r\ninternational community aimed at stopping human \r\nrights violations and fulfilling the legitimate \r\naspirations of populations, especially in Libya and \r\nSyria. \r\n Montenegro supports the principles of the \r\nuniversality of human rights and the inadmissibility of \r\nviolating them or resolutions promoting their \r\nprotection and enhancement. We also support the \r\nOffice of the High Commissioner for Human Rights \r\nand the Human Rights Council, to which we have \r\nannounced our candidature for the period 2013-2015. \r\nExperience that Montenegro gained in its turbulent \r\npast, when it provided shelter to refugees, can serve as \r\na basis for achieving long-lasting political \r\ncompromises aimed at securing peace in the region. In \r\nour view, the Universal Periodic Review is an \r\nimportant instrument for assessing the status of human \r\nrights in the world. \r\n I wish to emphasize our support of the work of \r\nthe International Criminal Tribunal for the Former \r\nYugoslavia, and the importance of all of the \r\ninternational tribunals, especially when it comes to \r\nsystematic violations of fundamental human rights and \r\nfreedoms. They not only serve as an example and guide \r\nfor national courts, but they also function as a clear \r\ndeterrent to and inescapable destination for individuals \r\nwho ignore the rules established by the Geneva \r\nConventions. \r\n Montenegro, as an ethnically, culturally and \r\nreligiously diverse society, is an active member of the \r\nGroup of Friends of the United Nations Alliance of \r\nCivilizations and is committed to the fundamental \r\nprinciples of integration, the strengthening of civil \r\nsociety, tolerance and the fight against all forms of \r\ndiscrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. We \r\nare determined and committed to preserving the \r\nfundamental values that civil society is based upon, no \r\nmatter what the challenges are and no matter what the \r\nchallenges that we, as a society and a State, will have \r\nto face in the future. \r\n Let me also briefly point out our current \r\neconomic developments. The fact that we are a small \r\nand open economy, and therefore vulnerable to changes \r\nin the global economic market, resulted in the global \r\neconomic and financial crisis stalling Montenegro’s \r\neconomic progress. Nevertheless, with the \r\nimplementation of our anti-crisis economic policy we \r\nhave lessened the impact of the global crisis and \r\nstopped the downward trend in the Montenegrin \r\neconomy. \r\n That crisis confirmed the soundness of the basic \r\nprinciples of our economic policy — focusing on \r\nfurther stabilization of public finances, improving the \r\nbusiness environment and structural reforms, so as to \r\nestablish a stable, dynamic and competitive economy \r\nin the long term and to improve the quality of life of all \r\ncitizens of Montenegro. Despite being fully aware that, \r\nif we are to mount an adequate response to the crisis, \r\nwe will have to make some difficult and unpopular cuts \r\nin order to create a new, sound basis for strengthening \r\nthe economy, we also know that actions taken by one \r\nstakeholder alone, no matter how successful, are \r\ninsufficient. We all have to play a positive role in order \r\nto strike the right balance among success, \r\nsustainability, social responsibility and solidarity in \r\nthis complex process. \r\n Accordingly, we must not stop progress towards \r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals, the \r\nrealization of which creates the basis for the further \r\nA/66/PV.22  \r\n \r\n11-51360 6 \r\n \r\ndevelopment of human rights and fundamental \r\nfreedoms throughout the world. The fight against \r\npoverty and diseases, gender equality, protection of \r\nmothers and children, education, environmental \r\nprotection and sustainable development represent the \r\nmain prerequisites for progress and prosperity for our \r\nsocieties and are high on our Government’s agenda. \r\n Montenegro supports pragmatic reform in the \r\nUnited Nations. As a small country, it is especially \r\ninterested in strengthening the authority and role of the \r\nGeneral Assembly — and other main United Nations \r\nbodies — and in improving its efficiency of operation. \r\nIncreasing representation in the Security Council — \r\nincluding granting a seat to the Group of Eastern \r\nEuropean States in the category of non-permanent \r\nmember — would result in a functional strengthening \r\nof that body, improving its efficiency, accountability \r\nand credibility, in accordance with the United Nations \r\nCharter. A modern reform process, open to Member \r\nStates individually or to groups of countries, must be \r\nbased on a broad consensus on all five key aspects of \r\nSecurity Council reform. I am sure that there is a way \r\nto make a bridge between those goals and other \r\nentities, such as the Group of 20, for instance. \r\n In its further democratization, its improved \r\nefficiency, its strengthened judiciary and administrative \r\nsystem, its fight against corruption and organized \r\ncrime and its fostering of an inclusive society, \r\nMontenegro and the resident and non-resident United \r\nNations agencies are working together to achieve the \r\nstrategic goals of our common policy. The United \r\nNations Development programme Resident \r\nRepresentative and the One United Nations programme \r\nhave given an opportunity both to United Nations \r\nagencies and State partners in the process to create and \r\nmonitor programme activities directly and on equal \r\nfooting, and to adapt programme activities to the \r\ndevelopment needs of our country. \r\n At the same time, the One United Nations \r\nprogramme is an opportunity for gradual reform in the \r\noperations of the United Nations system, creating a \r\nsimultaneous and well-coordinated approach that will \r\nresult, among other things, in avoiding overlaps \r\nbetween United Nations agencies and in achieving \r\nmore efficient results in the implementation of national \r\npriorities. \r\n Montenegro supports nuclear non-proliferation \r\nand objects to further expansion of the number of \r\ncountries that possess nuclear weapons. Moreover, we \r\nsupport all agreements of the nuclear Powers on mutual \r\nreduction of their nuclear capacities, creating a safer \r\nworld for existing and future generations. In that \r\ncontext, I wish to thank the Secretary-General for the \r\nappeal he sent late last month, requesting all countries \r\nthat have nuclear technology to adhere to the \r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. I wish to \r\nemphasize that Montenegro ratified the Convention on \r\nCluster Munitions and that within less than a year it \r\ndestroyed all reserves of that type of weapons, thus \r\nconfirming again its commitment to the principles of \r\nnon-proliferation. \r\n Montenegro is an environmentally conscious \r\nState. That is a bedrock principle of our Constitution. \r\nBased on that commitment, we have an additional \r\nincentive to find solutions that are compatible with our \r\nsustainable development policy. Our strategy for \r\ndevelopment in Montenegro is to achieve synergy \r\nbetween growth and employment, on the one hand, and \r\nsocial equality, the environment and natural resources, \r\non the other.  \r\n The United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, which will take place in Rio de Janeiro \r\nin 2012, represents an important opportunity to \r\npromote international cooperation in the area of \r\nsustainable development and an opportunity to make a \r\ncomprehensive evaluation of the progress made in the \r\npast two decades. Montenegro, as a member of the \r\nUnited Nations Commission on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment from 2011 to 2014, is committed to \r\ncontributing to the success of that Conference with its \r\nconstructive actions. \r\n Montenegro is especially sensitive to climate \r\nchange issues. There are numerous potential negative \r\neffects of climate change on Montenegro. A rise in sea \r\nlevel and temperature would diminish biological \r\ndiversity. I therefore believe that the fight against \r\nclimate change requires a global, coordinated and \r\ndecisive international agreement, based on the \r\nprinciples defined in the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change and its Kyoto Protocol. \r\nThe Framework Convention represents a key \r\nmultilateral forum for global action in the area of \r\nclimate change, and the sixteenth Conference of the \r\nParties in Cancún confirms that a multilateral approach \r\nto climate change management under United Nations \r\nauspices can give concrete results. \r\n A/66/PV.22\r\n \r\n7 11-51360 \r\n \r\n Allow me to reiterate once again how honoured I \r\nam to participate in the general debate of this global \r\nforum on behalf of Montenegro and, together with the \r\nrepresentatives of 192 countries, to contribute directly \r\nto the promotion of our mutual understanding and \r\npeaceful coexistence, to the benefit of all of our \r\nnations. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly I wish to thank the Prime Minister of \r\nMontenegro for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Igor Lukšić, Prime Minister of Montenegro, \r\nwas escorted from the rostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by Ms. Iveta Radičová, Prime Minister \r\nof the Slovak Republic \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Slovak \r\nRepublic. \r\n Ms. Iveta Radičová, Prime Minister of the Slovak \r\nRepublic, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming Her Excellency Ms. Iveta Radičová, Prime \r\nMinister of the Slovak Republic, and inviting her to \r\naddress the Assembly. \r\n Ms. Radičová (Slovak Republic): It is a distinct \r\nhonour and pleasure for me to address the General \r\nAssembly at the outset of its sixty-sixth session. This \r\nforum provides us with an unparalleled opportunity to \r\nstrengthen, through dialogue, our concerted efforts in \r\nthe quest for solutions to the mounting challenges that \r\nthe international community faces today. We, the \r\nleaders of the United Nations, are expected to offer \r\nguidance and find solutions. \r\n I am convinced that, given the extensive \r\ndiplomatic experience of the President of the \r\nAssembly, and under his able leadership, we will be \r\nable to make this session a successful one. I wish him \r\nevery success in his demanding duties and assure him \r\nof my delegation’s full support and assistance. I also \r\nwish to express my delegation’s appreciation and \r\ngratitude for the exquisite work of his predecessor, \r\nMr. Joseph Deiss, who so skilfully guided our \r\nproceedings during the sixty-fifth session. \r\n Let me also join others in paying tribute to the \r\nremarkable work of the newly reappointed Secretary-\r\nGeneral, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon. We deeply \r\nvalue his eminent personal and diplomatic qualities and \r\nlook forward to working with him during his next \r\ntenure. \r\n Slovakia warmly welcomes the Republic of South \r\nSudan as a new member of the United Nations family. \r\nWe wish South Sudan every success and, above all, \r\npeace, security and prosperity for its people. \r\n Her Excellency Ms. Dilma Rousseff, President of \r\nthe Federative Republic of Brazil, opened her speech \r\nwith these words:  \r\n  “For the very first time in the history of the \r\nUnited Nations, a female voice is opening the \r\ngeneral debate. It is the voice of democracy and \r\nequality.” (A/66/PV.11)  \r\nPresident Rousseff expressed in two words the main \r\nchallenge for the coming years: courage and sincerity. \r\nThis challenge is accurate at a time of economic and \r\ndebt crisis. We have to say openly that we still do not \r\nhave adequate solutions. We are facing common risks \r\nin economy, governance and politics. \r\n Citizens all over the world expect leadership and \r\na mutual synergy of economy and politics. The \r\nmajority of the world’s population expects economic \r\ngrowth, prosperity and a better quality of life. Those \r\nliving in poverty — the millions of people without \r\njobs, without water and without food — expect real \r\nanswers, quick action and results from political \r\nleaders. \r\n What can such a small country as Slovakia do to \r\naddress these challenges? First, it has to do its own \r\nhomework in stabilizing the economy. That means \r\nensuring our pension system’s sustainability through \r\ndeep reforms, and enacting a fiscal responsibility law \r\nthat will ensure that fiscal policy is responsible to \r\nfuture generations and counter-cyclical. It means \r\nlabour market reforms that support the creation of the \r\nnew jobs the country badly needs, especially for some \r\nof its vulnerable groups. It means lowering the \r\nadministrative burden and decreasing barriers to \r\nentrepreneurship, improving the predictability of the \r\nlegal environment, and ensuring a wider use of \r\ne-Government services. Of course, it means measures \r\nto tackle corruption and to increase transparency, for \r\nexample through a legal act ensuring that any contract \r\nconcerning the use of public funds is valid only if \r\npublished on the internet. \r\nA/66/PV.22  \r\n \r\n11-51360 8 \r\n \r\n The Slovak Republic is a small country, but it is a \r\npart of the eurozone, which is in deep economic \r\ntrouble. Courage and sincerity are most needed most \r\nthese days in Europe. The financial crisis and its \r\nnegative influence upon the entire European banking \r\nsector have clearly shown that the eurozone was not \r\nprepared for a crisis. The chaos in addressing these \r\nissues only deepened the general distrust and worsened \r\nthe subsequent economic recession. The majority of \r\nEuropean Union countries did not use the good \r\neconomic times to consolidate their budgets. Therefore, \r\nin many cases, the consequences of the recession \r\nshifted public debt into dangerous territory. \r\n We need courage in the eurozone to return to the \r\nold principles that established the European Union, \r\nwhich are necessary for successful international \r\ncooperation and integration. We need stricter European \r\nand national fiscal rules. We need to institute default \r\ncontrols, and we need new rules for the careful \r\nmanagement of the financial sector. \r\n We need sincerity. We have to be honest with our \r\ncitizens, because we have to be very careful that the \r\nresponse to forcing technical solutions to the debt \r\ncrisis is not the escalation of nationalism and populism. \r\nThere is a chance that we will save the eurozone \r\neconomically, but at the same time we must minimize \r\nthe risk of losing the project of European integration \r\npolitically and devaluing it in the eyes of our voters. \r\n It is not just Europe; every region in the world is \r\nstruggling today with serious economic difficulties. We \r\nlive in a global, interdependent reality in which we \r\ncannot afford to ignore anybody’s problems. In this \r\nregard, we believe that, as a member of the Economic \r\nand Social Council, that body has the capacity to \r\ncontribute more significantly to our joint efforts. If it is \r\nto do that, we feel that it is urgent to adjust its mandate \r\nand enhance its ability to react more swiftly to the \r\neconomic and social needs of the world. \r\n In times of dire financial restrictions in our own \r\nnational budgets, we, as the United Nations, also need \r\nto learn to do more with fewer resources. We welcome \r\nevery effort that the Secretary-General is making to \r\nutilize the available resources with maximum \r\neffectiveness and efficiency. \r\n Peace and security are ever harder to maintain in \r\nthese harsh crisis times. One of Slovakia’s priorities in \r\nthe fight against international terrorism remains the \r\nendeavour to move forward the negotiations on the \r\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism. \r\nWith regard to the United Nations Global Counter-\r\nTerrorism Strategy, Slovakia will continue its \r\nimplementation through concrete projects, as we have \r\nby co-organizing a special event on implementing the \r\nUnited Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy in \r\nCentral Asia, held in Bratislava in December 2010. \r\nRespect for international law, human rights and the rule \r\nof law should be an integral part of the fight against \r\ninternational terrorism. \r\n Peacekeeping missions are among the most \r\nvisible and successful activities of the United Nations \r\nand the true expression of the commitment to \r\nmaintaining peace and security around the globe. The \r\nSlovak Republic has been an active contributor to the \r\nUnited Nations forces in Cyprus since 2001, and is \r\ninvolved in the Middle East. In recent decades, we \r\nhave witnessed an unprecedented proliferation of \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping missions. They have \r\nbecome increasingly in-demand, their mandates are \r\nwidening and their management is becoming more \r\ncomplex. Slovakia therefore supports every measure \r\naimed at increasing their effectiveness and efficiency \r\ngiven our truly constrained budgets. \r\n Peace is not merely the absence of war. Peace \r\nmeans safety in all areas of people’s lives, economic \r\nprosperity, social stability, respect for human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms, access to health care and \r\neducation, protection of the environment, and access to \r\nwater and food. There is no chance of lasting peace \r\nwithout sustainable development. That is an area in \r\nwhich we must still do a great deal of work and make \r\nconcerted efforts. Aid from Slovakia — a small \r\ncountry — has since 2003 been aimed at the most \r\ntroubled regions of the world. Recently, Slovakia has \r\nbeen providing development and humanitarian aid in \r\nthe context of 41 projects to help starving children in \r\nKenya, deliver food and water in Ethiopia; provide \r\nhumanitarian help in South Sudan; assist Pakistan \r\nfollowing the terrible floods there; help refugees, from \r\nLibya to Tunisia; and also to provide technical \r\nassistance for countries in the western Balkans and in \r\nthe Middle East. Slovakia is also helping to secure the \r\ndemocratization process in Afghanistan through 13 \r\nnew projects. \r\n We need to focus on eliminating the primary \r\ncauses of conflicts, not just deal hastily with their \r\ngrave consequences, which, sadly, often occur only \r\nafter too many lives have been destroyed. No effort \r\n A/66/PV.22\r\n \r\n9 11-51360 \r\n \r\nshould be spared in exploring all political and \r\ndiplomatic options to stop conflicts at their roots. \r\nMediation has proved to yield tangible results. I want \r\nto stress the important role of women in these \r\nprocesses, as it is often underestimated.  \r\n Slovakia is a firm supporter of effective \r\nmultilateralism, with the United Nations playing a \r\ncentral role. Concentrated efforts help create just and \r\nlasting solutions. \r\n This will be yet another challenging session for \r\nall of us. It calls for a renewed, shared commitment to \r\nthe fundamental principles and purposes of the United \r\nNations Charter. We cannot afford to lose the ability to \r\nunderstand one another’s needs because of our own \r\ndomestic problems. In these hard times, I wish all of us \r\nenough strength to find necessary, mutually \r\nadvantageous solutions. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nSlovak Republic for the statement she has just made. \r\n Ms. Iveta Radičová, Prime Minister of the Slovak \r\nRepublic, was escorted from the rostrum.  \r\n  \r\n  Address by Mr. Manmohan Singh, Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of India  \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof India. \r\n Mr. Manmohan Singh, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of India, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Manmohan Singh, \r\nPrime Minister of the Republic of India, and inviting \r\nhim to address the Assembly.  \r\n Mr. Singh (India): Allow me at the outset to \r\ncongratulate Mr. Al-Nasser on his election to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly. I wish to assure \r\nhim of India’s full cooperation in the conduct of the \r\nsixty-sixth session of the Assembly. \r\n It is also my great pleasure to welcome in our \r\nmidst the new State of South Sudan. \r\n We meet during this session of the General \r\nAssembly at a time of great uncertainty and profound \r\nchange. Until a few years ago, the world had taken for \r\ngranted the benefits of globalization and global \r\ninterdependence. Today we are being called upon to \r\ncope with the negative dimensions of those very \r\nphenomena. Economic, social and political events in \r\ndifferent parts of the world have coalesced, and their \r\nadverse impact is now being felt across countries and \r\ncontinents. \r\n The world economy is in trouble. The shoots of \r\nrecovery which were visible after the economic and \r\nfinancial crisis of 2008 have yet to blossom. In many \r\nrespects, the crisis has deepened even further. \r\n The traditional engines of the global economy, \r\nincluding the United States, Europe and Japan, which \r\nare also the sources of global economic and financial \r\nstability, are today faced with continued economic \r\nslowdown. Recessionary trends in those countries are \r\naffecting confidence in world financial and capital \r\nmarkets. These developments are bound to have a \r\nnegative impact on developing countries, which also \r\nhave to bear the additional burden of inflationary \r\npressures. \r\n There has been unprecedented social and political \r\nupheaval in West Asia, the Gulf and North Africa. The \r\npeoples of those regions are demanding the right to \r\nshape their own future. Energy and food prices are \r\nonce again spiralling and introducing fresh instability, \r\nespecially for developing countries. \r\n The Palestinian question remains unresolved and \r\na source of great instability and violence. India is \r\nsteadfast in its support for the Palestinian people’s \r\nstruggle for a sovereign, independent, viable and united \r\nState of Palestine, with East Jerusalem as its capital, \r\nliving within secure and recognizable borders side by \r\nside and at peace with Israel. We look forward to \r\nwelcoming Palestine as an equal Member of the United \r\nNations. \r\n Terrorism continues to rear its ugly head and take \r\na grievous toll of innocent lives. New threats to \r\ninternational security have emerged. At a time when \r\nthe world needs more international commerce, the sea \r\nlanes of communication across the Indian Ocean are \r\nunder siege. Acts of piracy are being carried out with \r\nimpunity from lands that are beyond the writ of any \r\nfunctioning State or international accountability. \r\n Iniquitous growth, inadequate job and education \r\nopportunities and the denial of basic human freedoms \r\nare leading to a growing radicalization of the youth, \r\nintolerance and extremism. \r\nA/66/PV.22  \r\n \r\n11-51360 10 \r\n \r\n We have no choice but to meet these challenges \r\nhead-on. We will succeed if we adopt a cooperative \r\nrather than a confrontational approach. We will \r\nsucceed if we embrace once again the principles on \r\nwhich the United Nations was founded: \r\ninternationalism and multilateralism. More importantly, \r\nwe will succeed if our efforts have legitimacy and are \r\npursued not just within the framework of the law but \r\nalso in the spirit of the law. \r\n The observance of the rule of law is as important \r\nin international affairs as it is within countries. \r\nSocieties cannot be reordered from outside through \r\nmilitary force. People in all countries have the right to \r\nchoose their own destiny and decide their own future. \r\n The international community has a role to play in \r\nassisting in the processes of transition and institution-\r\nbuilding, but the idea that prescriptions should be \r\nimposed from outside is fraught with danger. \r\n Action taken under the authority of the United \r\nNations must respect the unity, territorial integrity, \r\nsovereignty and independence of individual States. \r\nCorrespondingly, governments are duty-bound to their \r\ncitizens to create conditions that enable them to freely \r\ndetermine their pathways to development. This is the \r\nessence of democracy and fundamental human \r\nfreedoms. \r\n There are many other things that we can do. We \r\nmust address the issue of the deficit in global \r\ngovernance. We need a stronger and more effective \r\nUnited Nations. We need a United Nations that is \r\nsensitive to the aspirations of everyone, rich or poor, \r\nbig or small. For this, the United Nations and its \r\nprincipal organs, the General Assembly and the \r\nSecurity Council, must be revitalized and reformed. \r\n The reform and expansion of the Security \r\nCouncil are essential if it is to reflect contemporary \r\nreality. Such an outcome will enhance the Council’s \r\ncredibility and effectiveness in dealing with global \r\nissues. Early reform of the Security Council must be \r\npursued with renewed vigour and urgently enacted. \r\n We should not allow the global economic \r\nslowdown to become a pretext for building walls \r\naround ourselves through protectionism or erecting \r\nbarriers to the movement of people, services and \r\ncapital. Effective ways and means must be deployed to \r\npromote the coordination of the macroeconomic \r\npolicies of the major economies. The reform of the \r\ngovernance systems of international financial \r\ninstitutions should be pursued with speed and \r\nefficiency. \r\n The development agenda must be brought firmly \r\nback to centre stage in United Nations priorities. We \r\nneed a much more determined effort to ensure \r\nbalanced, inclusive and sustainable development for \r\nthe benefit of vast sections of humanity. Each of us can \r\ncontribute to this task, but we can achieve far more if \r\nwe act in partnership. \r\n In the past few decades, India has lifted tens of \r\nmillions of its people out of abject poverty. We are in a \r\nposition to feed our population better, educate them \r\nbetter and widen their economic choices. However, we \r\nstill have a very long way to go. \r\n We wish to accelerate the pace of India’s \r\ntransformation in partnership with the international \r\ncommunity. A fast-growing India can expand the \r\nboundaries of the global economy. A democratic, plural \r\nand secular India can contribute to tolerance and \r\npeaceful coexistence among nations. \r\n Developing countries need investment, \r\ntechnology and market access for their products. They \r\nneed assistance in the areas of education, health, \r\nwomen’s empowerment and agriculture. During the \r\nrecently held fourth United Nations Conference on the \r\nLeast Developed Countries Conference in Istanbul in \r\nMay 2011, India strengthened its partnership with the \r\nleast developed countries through significantly \r\nenhanced lines of credit and assistance in capacity-\r\nbuilding. \r\n We should pay particular attention to Africa. \r\nAfrica’s richest resources are not its minerals but its \r\npeople. We must empower them and open the doors for \r\nthem to human advances through technology, education \r\nand skills development. \r\n At the second India-Africa Forum Summit in \r\nAddis Ababa earlier this year, India offered lines of \r\ncredit worth $5 billion and an additional $700 million \r\nin grant assistance for human resource development, \r\ntechnology transfer and building new institutions. \r\n The United Nations should lead efforts in the area \r\nof food security. We need more cooperation in \r\nagricultural technologies, water conservation, land \r\nusage and productivity, and stability in commodity \r\nprices. \r\n A/66/PV.22\r\n \r\n11 11-51360 \r\n \r\n Developing countries need a peaceful external \r\nenvironment in which to grow. The fight against \r\nterrorism must be unrelenting. There cannot be \r\nselective approaches in dealing with terrorist groups or \r\nthe infrastructure of terrorism. Terrorism has to be \r\nfought across all fronts. In South Asia there are \r\nencouraging signs of cooperation in the area of \r\nsecurity, as exemplified in India’s cooperation with \r\nBangladesh. Such cooperation is adding to the security \r\nof both our countries. \r\n However, the recent assassination of \r\nMr. Burhanuddin Rabbani in Kabul is a chilling \r\nreminder of the designs of the enemies of peace in \r\nAfghanistan. It is essential that the process of nation-\r\nbuilding and reconciliation in that country succeed. \r\nThis is vital for ensuring peace and security in the \r\nregion. India will play its part in helping the people of \r\nAfghanistan build a better future for themselves, just as \r\nwe are doing in other countries in South Asia. We will \r\ndo so because prosperity and stability in our region are \r\nindivisible. \r\n We wish to see an open, inclusive and transparent \r\narchitecture of regional cooperation in the Asia-Pacific \r\nregion and peaceful settlement of disputes. I call upon \r\nthe United Nations to evolve a comprehensive and \r\neffective response to the problem of piracy in the Red \r\nSea and off the coast of Somalia. As a littoral State of \r\nthe Indian Ocean, India is ready to work with other \r\ncountries in that regard. Simultaneously, the \r\ninternational community should continue with efforts \r\nto restore stability in Somalia. We have joined \r\ninternational efforts to provide humanitarian assistance \r\nto the countries afflicted with severe famine and \r\ndrought in the Horn of Africa, specifically Somalia, \r\nKenya and Djibouti. \r\n Nuclear proliferation continues to be a threat to \r\ninternational security. The action plan put forward by \r\nformer Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi for a nuclear-\r\nweapon-free and non-violent world provides, even \r\ntoday, a concrete road map for achieving nuclear \r\ndisarmament in a time-bound, universal, \r\nnon-discriminatory, phased and verifiable manner. I \r\ncommend the United Nations for its efforts in focusing \r\nworld attention on nuclear safety. Our plans for \r\nutilizing nuclear power to meet our energy needs hinge \r\non full satisfaction of our concerns about the safety of \r\nnuclear energy. We have undertaken a thorough review \r\nof the safety of our nuclear plants. \r\n The perspectives I have outlined to the Assembly \r\nare those that have guided our actions in the Security \r\nCouncil since India became a non-permanent member \r\nof the Council in January. There are still millions of \r\npeople living in poverty across the world. Their plight \r\nhas worsened, through no fault of theirs, due to the \r\nglobal economic and financial crisis of recent years. \r\nThe actions of Governments around the world are \r\ntherefore under close scrutiny. It is vitally important \r\nthat through our actions and deeds we renew the \r\npeople’s faith in the Charter and objectives of the \r\nUnited Nations. I am confident that we can do this \r\nthrough acts of statesmanship, foresight and collective \r\neffort. India stands ready to play its part in this noble \r\nendeavour. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of India for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Manmohan Singh, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of India, was escorted from the rostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Carlos Gomes Júnior, Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof Guinea-Bissau. \r\n Mr. Carlos Gomes Júnior, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Guinea-Bissau, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum. \r\n The Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Carlos Gomes Júnior, \r\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, and \r\ninviting him to address the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Gomes (Guinea-Bissau) (spoke in \r\nPortuguese; interpretation provided by the delegation): \r\nI would first like to congratulate Ambassador Nassir \r\nAbdulaziz Al-Nasser on his election to the presidency \r\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session, and \r\nto express our most sincere wishes for his success in \r\nfulfilling his mandate. Similarly, I would like to \r\nconvey to Mr. Joseph Deiss Guinea-Bissau’s \r\nappreciation for the spirit of engagement and \r\ndedication he brought to his successful conduct of the \r\nwork of the sixty-fifth session. \r\n Let me also reiterate my congratulations to the \r\nSecretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-Moon, \r\non his recent reappointment, the fruit of the excellent \r\nA/66/PV.22  \r\n \r\n11-51360 12 \r\n \r\nwork he has done to help consolidate peace and \r\ndevelopment around the world. \r\n And I would like to take this happy occasion to \r\nsalute the Republic of South Sudan on having joined \r\nthe United Nations, becoming the Organization’s most \r\nrecent full Member. \r\n Today, 24 September, Guinea-Bissau celebrates \r\nthe thirty-eighth anniversary of its independence. That \r\nhistoric achievement was the Guinean people’s first \r\nmajor victory, and from this rostrum I pay the homage \r\nthat is owed to our country’s freedom fighters, whose \r\ncourage and determination enabled us to attain the \r\nstatus of a free and independent State. \r\n As our national authorities have stated and has \r\nbeen unanimously recognized by the international \r\ncommunity, defence and security sector reforms are \r\nurgent priorities for us, since their implementation can \r\nstrengthen peace and stability in our country and thus \r\ncreate the conditions needed for sustainable \r\ndevelopment. With the signing of the Tripartite \r\nAgreement Protocol or Memorandum of Understanding \r\nbetween the Economic Community of West African \r\nStates (ECOWAS), the Community of Portuguese-\r\nspeaking Countries and the Government of Guinea-\r\nBissau, which will take place at the margins of this \r\nsession of the Assembly, we will be able to make a \r\nmajor qualitative leap in the implementation of defence \r\nand security forces reform, as well as in effectively \r\nimplementing the programmes contained in the \r\nECOWAS road map.  \r\n In that regard, Guinea-Bissau’s commitment to \r\nmobilizing resources to sustain the reforms has led to a \r\ndecision to create a special pension fund, into which \r\nwe will have deposited $200,000 of the $500,000 we \r\npledged to the fund by December 2011, as proof of our \r\nfirm commitment to contributing 10 per cent of the \r\ntotal resources required. We therefore expect to hold a \r\nhigh-level meeting with our development partners this \r\nyear, in order to obtain the financial and technical \r\nresources required to implement the reforms, and we \r\nappeal to all our partners to participate in and commit \r\nto the meeting. \r\n Drug trafficking and organized crime are a \r\ncurrent subject of discussion in the Organization, and, \r\nas is well known, the West African region to which we \r\nbelong cited as a hub and Guinea-Bissau is also often \r\nsingled out as a transit point for illicit drugs. In full \r\nawareness of this reality and recognizing our known \r\nproblems, we are proud to say that we were one of the \r\nfirst countries to request the good offices of the United \r\nNations, through the United Nations Office on Drugs \r\nand Crime (UNODC), to help us deal with the issue \r\nwith determination and effectiveness. \r\n In order to combat drug trafficking and organized \r\ncrime, the Government, through its Council of \r\nMinisters, has adopted two important instruments, a \r\npolitical declaration and a plan of action, which \r\ninclude large-scale actions in the following three areas: \r\nstrengthening the legal system, strengthening the \r\ncriminal justice system, and combating drug use and \r\nHIV/AIDS. Alongside such measures at the national \r\nlevel, the Government is seeking to sign bilateral \r\nagreements to strengthen the fight against drug \r\ntrafficking, keeping in mind that, without strategic \r\ncooperation between the countries of origin, transit and \r\nconsumption of drugs, there can be no effective fight \r\nagainst drug trafficking. \r\n Therefore, from this rostrum, we reiterate our \r\nappeal, as we have many times before, for help in \r\ncontrolling our maritime borders. We address this \r\nappeal to countries that are better prepared than we are \r\nto do so. We are making a formal request for the \r\nsupport of the United States and the European Union \r\nand its member States, since we cannot single-\r\nhandedly fight drug trafficking, which, as we all know, \r\nis increasingly powerful and sophisticated. \r\n We are approaching the deadline for achieving \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals, but despite \r\nongoing efforts, Guinea-Bissau continues to face \r\nchallenges with regard to basic sanitation, supplies of \r\ndrinking water and energy, and the provision of \r\nprimary health services, to cite only the most pressing \r\nissues. The high rate of poverty that still prevails in our \r\ncountry has forced the Government to adopt an \r\nambitious agenda for the future, embodied in our \r\nnational poverty reduction strategy document and \r\nbased on the pillars of stability, peace, economic \r\ngrowth and poverty reduction. That document defines \r\nthe main challenges and recommends priorities for the \r\nnext five years. As a result of serious and rigorous \r\nimplementation of this strategy, the Government that I \r\nhave the honour to lead has already successfully \r\nreversed this negative trend. \r\n The current economic situation is clearly \r\nimproving, the result of progress made in the last two \r\nand a half years in strengthening public policy and \r\n A/66/PV.22\r\n \r\n13 11-51360 \r\n \r\nimproving macroeconomic performance, as our \r\npartners, especially the International Monetary Fund \r\nand the World Bank, will testify. As a result of our \r\nexcellent macroeconomic performance, the country \r\nreached the completion point of the Heavily Indebted \r\nPoor Countries Initiative, thus achieving forgiveness of \r\nabout 90 per cent of its external debt and the recent \r\nre-evaluation of the growth rate of its gross domestic \r\nproduct, which is now fixed at 5.3 per cent, which is \r\nhigher than originally predicted. We have all the \r\nconditions needed to maintain and accelerate this trend \r\nduring the next year. \r\n To that end, in addition to relying on our own \r\nresources, which can now be devoted to poverty \r\nreduction programmes, the Government will organize a \r\nround table of donors in the first quarter of 2012 to \r\nmobilize the necessary financial resources for the \r\nimplementation of those programmes. In that context, \r\nwe appeal once more for the participation of and \r\ncontributions by all traditional donors that are \r\ninterested in our country and that wish to support \r\nnational efforts aimed at overcoming our current \r\nweaknesses. \r\n Let me once again welcome the establishment of \r\nUN-Women, an entity that reflects the firm \r\ncommitment of our Organization to the struggle for \r\ngender equality and to ensuring that women have the \r\nconditions necessary for a more representative and \r\nactive participation in the process of transformation \r\nthat is under way in our societies. \r\n In the same context, my country is taking \r\nmeasures to uphold the dignity of women, including \r\nmeasures to promote their empowerment and the \r\naffirmation of their autonomy. I welcome the steps \r\ntaken recently by the Guinean Parliament, which \r\napproved the criminalization of female genital \r\nmutilation and increased penalties for trafficking in \r\nminors. \r\n Guinea-Bissau’s status and credibility in the \r\ninternational arena depends largely on its ability to \r\ndefine and implement a foreign policy that takes into \r\naccount the great universal values of democracy, \r\nfreedom and human rights, which are our values as \r\nwell.  \r\n In our diplomatic efforts, we have to be \r\nconsistent with our historical commitments and, above \r\nall, faithful to all who selflessly helped us in the \r\nstruggle for the affirmation of our dignity. \r\n From that perspective, we welcome the decision \r\nof the Palestinian Authority to submit a request for the \r\nrecognition of the State of Palestine as a full Member \r\nof the United Nations. We encourage a constructive \r\ndialogue on the basis of the possibility of peaceful \r\ncoexistence and mutually advantageous cooperation \r\nbetween countries and peoples. \r\n This session of the Assembly is taking place at a \r\ntime when major changes are occurring in the Arab \r\nworld. These changes call for greater political and \r\nsocial rights, as well as values such as freedom and \r\ndemocracy, and, for that very reason, the Arabs have \r\nour sympathy and solidarity. We regret, however, the \r\ncases where transition incurs high costs in terms of \r\nhuman lives. \r\n With regard to Libya, Guinea-Bissau fully \r\nsupports the position of the African Union and \r\nexpresses its full readiness to cooperate and to \r\nstrengthen the increasingly friendly relations and \r\ncooperation with the legitimate representatives of the \r\nLibyan people.  \r\n We urge the United States Government to draw \r\non the values that define that great nation and to \r\nresume its relationship with Cuba, ending the embargo \r\nthat has lasted for more than five decades and freeing \r\nthe Cubans still being held in its prisons. \r\n The responsibilities of the United Nations are \r\nincreasing, and the globalization of the decisions that it \r\nis called upon to take is becoming increasingly urgent. \r\n The historical reasons that led to the \r\nestablishment of the Security Council are no longer \r\ncurrent. The demographic representation of the \r\ndifferent regions of the world, the emergence of new \r\ncountries and new geopolitical configurations oblige us \r\nto accept as natural the reform of the Security Council. \r\nWe deem it legitimate to want the decisions of the \r\nSecurity Council to be made more inclusive and \r\nparticipatory through giving our continent both \r\npermanent and non-permanent seats, as is the wish of \r\nthe African Union, because of the large representation \r\nof the African continent. \r\n Under the auspices of the President of the \r\nRepublic, Mr. Malam Bacai Sanhá, the National \r\nAssembly launched a process of national reconciliation \r\ninvolving all the forces of the nation. That important \r\ninitiative has contributed to the establishment of the \r\nA/66/PV.22  \r\n \r\n11-51360 14 \r\n \r\nclimate of peace and understanding that now prevails \r\nin the country. \r\n To conclude, I take this opportunity to thank all \r\nfriends and partners of Guinea-Bissau for their support \r\nand solidarity and to assure them that we will spare no \r\neffort in consolidating peace and building a more just \r\nsociety to create better living conditions for the \r\nGuinean people. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Guinea-Bissau for the statement he has \r\njust made. \r\n Mr. Carlos Gomes Júnior, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Guinea-Bissau, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum.  \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Willy Telavi, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Republic of Tuvalu \r\n  \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof Tuvalu. \r\n Mr. Willy Telavi, Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof Tuvalu, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Willy Telavi, Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Tuvalu, and inviting him to \r\naddress the Assembly.  \r\n  Mr. Telavi (Tuvalu): As this is the first time I \r\nhave stood at this rostrum as Prime Minister of Tuvalu \r\nand participated in the general debate of the General \r\nAssembly, I am delighted to convey the warmest \r\ngreetings and best wishes of my people and my \r\nGovernment, and I am honoured to speak today on \r\ntheir behalf. Let me first extend my special thanks and \r\nsincere appreciation to the Government of the United \r\nStates of America, as the host country, for the warm \r\nhospitality and special protocols accorded to my \r\ndelegation since our arrival. \r\n Ten years ago, Tuvalu established and opened its \r\nPermanent Mission to the United Nations here in New \r\nYork, with a mandate to engage more closely with \r\nnations of the global family. Despite our limited \r\nresources as one of the smallest Member States, our \r\npresence is a simple testimony of our hope and trust in \r\ncollaboration with Member States in the pursuit of our \r\ndestiny. This further reflects our continued \r\ncommitment to uphold the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security, development and human rights as \r\nfundamental pillars of the United Nations, as enshrined \r\nin its Charter. \r\n Tuvalu warmly welcomes and fully supports the \r\nfour main areas of focus of Mr. Al-Nasser’s presidency, \r\nincluding the peaceful settlement of disputes, United \r\nNations reform and revitalization, improving disaster \r\nprevention and response, and sustainable development \r\nand global prosperity, which he clearly identified \r\nduring the opening of the session. In particular, the \r\ntheme that he proposed for the general debate — “The \r\nrole of mediation in the settlement of disputes by \r\npeaceful means” — is timely, considering what is \r\nhappening around the world today. \r\n In this context, I wish to express our belated \r\ntribute and respect to the people and the Government \r\nof the United States in commemoration of the recent \r\ntenth anniversary of the events of 11 September 2001. \r\nTuvalu strongly condemns such terrorist acts and all \r\nsimilar incidents worldwide, and our prayers are with \r\nthose who have lost their loved ones. Tuvalu further \r\nsalutes those who have lost their lives for the cause of \r\njustice and peace. \r\n As a peace-loving nation, Tuvalu fully supports \r\nthe role of the United Nations in the maintenance of \r\npeace and security across the globe. However, at the \r\nsame time, the integrity and sovereignty of countries \r\nshould be respected at all costs. Tuvalu firmly believes \r\nthat military and violent action should not be used as a \r\nmeans for the settlement of disputes. Instead, the \r\nparties concerned should be encouraged to discuss and \r\nunderstand the root causes of their differences and try \r\nto listen to each other in a more peaceful manner. \r\n Today the world is undergoing profound changes \r\nwithout any boundaries through the unprecedented \r\nimpacts of globalization and other related global \r\nevents, which have critical implications for Tuvalu. \r\nThis has been further exacerbated by the continued \r\nsevere impact of the global financial and economic \r\ncrisis, which has had an enormous and critical negative \r\neffect on Tuvalu’s economy. In particular, the Tuvalu \r\nTrust Fund, which is the main source of revenue to \r\nstabilize our recurrent budget, has been severely \r\naffected. As a consequence, my Government has no \r\nother option apart from streamlining and containing its \r\nnational recurrent budget to a sustainable level so as to \r\n A/66/PV.22\r\n \r\n15 11-51360 \r\n \r\nenable the provision of basic services to its people \r\nduring these difficult times. \r\n In this regard, I humbly call upon the \r\ninternational community and development partners to \r\nurgently fulfil their commitments to assist the least \r\ndeveloped countries (LDCs), including Tuvalu, through \r\nthe implementation of the Istanbul Programme of \r\nAction, adopted at the fourth United Nations \r\nConference on the Least Developed Countries, held in \r\nTurkey earlier this year. The Istanbul Programme of \r\nAction is a living document that needs to be \r\nimplemented vigorously and collectively by LDCs and \r\nthe international community during the next 10 years. \r\nIn that regard, I am pleased to confirm that the main \r\nthrusts of that Programme of Action will be integrated \r\nand mainstreamed in the Tuvalu National Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Strategy, during the Fourth United \r\nNations Conference on the Least Developed Countries \r\nscheduled for next month. \r\n Furthermore, as a least developed country, Tuvalu \r\nis most vulnerable to global economic shocks, the \r\nimpacts of climate change and outbreaks of disease, \r\nincluding non-communicable diseases. Tuvalu \r\ncontinues to call on and appeal to the United Nations to \r\ntake those vulnerabilities seriously into consideration \r\nwhen addressing the question of the graduation of \r\nLDCs. Despite the ambitious target of the Istanbul \r\nProgramme of Action for 50 per cent of LDCs to be \r\ngraduated within the next decade, Tuvalu firmly \r\nbelieves that its economic and environmental \r\nvulnerability, coupled with its continuous dependence \r\non official development assistance, cannot be totally \r\nignored. In that context, the graduation criteria need to \r\nbe reviewed to reflect and recognize our vulnerability. \r\n Last month, Tuvalu published its second \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) Progress \r\nReport covering the period from 2010 to 2011, which \r\nhighlights the progress we have made to date towards \r\nachieving those goals. Despite the ongoing impact of \r\nrecent global crises, which Tuvalu continues to face, it \r\nis encouraging to note that five of the MDGs are likely \r\nto be achieved and three will have mixed results by \r\n2015. As alluded to earlier, while we have made \r\nprogress in achieving the MDGs, such progress can be \r\nreversed overnight because of our particular economic \r\nand environmental vulnerability. \r\n The ongoing process and inter-governmental \r\nnegotiations at the United Nations to revitalize and \r\nreform the General Assembly and the Security Council \r\nrespectively are fully supported. However, while we \r\nrecognize the importance of the reforms being \r\nundertaken by those United Nations bodies in order to \r\nupdate their mandates, we are concerned that the time \r\ntaken to conclude such undertakings is far too long. In \r\nthat regard, we look forward to a more realistic \r\ntimetable to complete those negotiations in the near \r\nfuture, once and for all. \r\n Our collective efforts to strengthen and maintain \r\npeace across the globe will be meaningless, if the \r\nUnited Nations continues to turn blind eyes and deaf \r\nears to Taiwan’s contribution and efforts toward those \r\ncommon goals. Furthermore, Taiwan’s continued \r\ncontribution to the international community as one of \r\nthe committed development partners cannot be \r\noveremphasized. In that regard, Tuvalu strongly urges \r\nthe United Nations to recognize those contributions \r\nwithout any reservations. In particular, Tuvalu calls \r\nupon the United Nations subsidiary bodies, especially \r\nthe World Health Organization and the International \r\nCivil Aviation Organization, to allow Taiwan to \r\nparticipate fully and meaningfully in their meetings \r\nand activities, including in United Nations meetings on \r\nclimate change. \r\n Climate change is a priority global issue of the \r\ntwenty-first century and beyond and therefore requires \r\na global solution. Climate change impacts countries \r\nunequally and not all countries possess the same \r\ncapacity and resilience to adapt and respond to such \r\nimpacts. For a small island developing State like \r\nTuvalu, climate change is without a doubt a security \r\nissue that threatens our survival. At the end of this year \r\nparties to the United Nations Framework Convention \r\non Climate Change will be meeting in Durban to \r\nadvance our work on climate change. It will be a \r\ncritical meeting, as time is fast running out for highly \r\nvulnerable countries like Tuvalu. My country believes \r\nthe meeting in Durban must deliver key outcomes. \r\n First, we must adopt amendments to the Kyoto \r\nProtocol, so as to allow for a second commitment \r\nperiod. It will be necessary to adopt a decision that \r\nincludes provisional entry into force of those \r\namendments to avoid any gap between the first and \r\nsecond commitment periods. That is necessary in order \r\nto ensure that the clean development mechanism \r\ncontinues without any complications and that the \r\nmechanism continues to provide financing for the \r\nAdaptation Fund. \r\nA/66/PV.22  \r\n \r\n11-51360 16 \r\n \r\n Secondly, we must make rapid progress in \r\ndeveloping an international mechanism to address loss \r\nand damage. For highly vulnerable countries like \r\nTuvalu, that is vitally important. We need an \r\ninternational mechanism to spread the burden of \r\nrebuilding after major weather catastrophes. Thirdly, \r\nwe must re-focus our work on reducing emissions from \r\ndeforestation and forest degradation. To properly \r\nreduce global deforestation we must put in place \r\nappropriate measures that effectively address its \r\ncauses. We must look at this from the demand side and \r\nexplore all means of regulating the trade in products \r\nthat is driving deforestation. \r\n Finally, we believe that all major emitting \r\ncountries must take more decisive action to reduce \r\ntheir emissions. The current pledging system found in \r\nthe Cancún Agreements is inadequate. We will be \r\nseeking a mandate in Durban to commence \r\nnegotiations on a new, legally binding agreement for \r\nthose major emitting countries that have not taken \r\ncommitments under the Kyoto Protocol. That \r\nagreement should complement the Kyoto Protocol, but \r\nnot replace it.  \r\n As we make progress towards the Rio+20 \r\nConference next year, we must ensure that there is a \r\nfocused section dealing with the needs of small island \r\ndeveloping States. In considering the theme of the \r\ngreen economy, we must explore carefully how we can \r\nredirect the current international trading system to \r\nproperly reflect the needs of small island economies. \r\nWe need accessible and affordable technologies that \r\ntake advantage of renewable energy and energy \r\nefficiency, we need help to protect our blue economies \r\nand our oceans, and we need to explore new \r\npreferential trade arrangements to overcome our size \r\ndisadvantage. \r\n In conclusion, let me reiterate the severe impact \r\nof the recent financial and economic crisis and other \r\nongoing global crises, which continue to affect my \r\ncountry’s economy and its overall social and economic \r\ndevelopment. As a small island developing State and a \r\nleast developed country, vulnerable to such crises and \r\ndependent on overseas development assistance, Tuvalu \r\nappeals to the international community to urgently \r\nhonour and fulfil their commitments and obligations \r\noutlined in the Istanbul Programme of Action and other \r\ninternational platforms. We firmly believe that with our \r\ncontinued cooperation and strong partnerships at all \r\nlevels, we can successfully overcome those problems \r\nfor the sake of our people and humankind. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of Tuvalu \r\nfor the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Willy Telavi, Prime Minister of Tuvalu, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Ralph Gonsalves, Prime \r\nMinister of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of Saint Vincent \r\nand the Grenadines. \r\n Mr. Ralph Gonsalves, Prime Minister of Saint \r\nVincent and the Grenadines, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum. \r\n The Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Ralph Gonsalves, \r\nPrime Minister of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, \r\nand inviting him to address the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Gonsalves (Saint Vincent and the \r\nGrenadines): I am pleased to add my voice to the \r\nunanimous acclaim of His Excellency Mr. Nassir \r\nAbdulaziz Al-Nasser as President of the General \r\nAssembly for this, our sixty-sixth session. A skilful and \r\nseasoned diplomat, he has played an integral role in \r\nestablishing the State of Qatar as a central and crucial \r\nactor in international diplomacy. I have no doubt that \r\nhe will approach his new responsibilities with similar \r\ndedication, even-handedness and compassion. \r\n In recent months the winds of change have \r\nencircled the globe, reaching and reshaping the \r\nunlikeliest corners of our planet, for good and for ill. \r\nThose winds have swept the nation of South Sudan into \r\nthese hallowed halls as a welcome and esteemed new \r\nmember of our global family. They are blowing away \r\nthe flimsy impediments to Palestinian statehood, and \r\nbreathing fresh air into stagnant negotiating processes. \r\nThe winds of change have howled across the sands of \r\nthe Middle East and North Africa, reshaping long-held \r\ngeopolitical assumptions. \r\n The grim economic storm clouds that formed \r\nominously on our global horizon three years ago have \r\nyet to dissipate, and, indeed, seem to be multiplying. \r\nNatural disasters, climate change, and the \r\naccompanying non-metaphorical winds of hurricanes \r\n A/66/PV.22\r\n \r\n17 11-51360 \r\n \r\nand tropical storms have buffeted my multi-island \r\nnation and my region yet again, upending our fragile \r\neconomies and causing painful developmental \r\nsetbacks. \r\n The United Nations finds itself in the eye of these \r\nincreasingly turbulent geopolitical and socio-economic \r\nstorms. The role that we collectively play in response \r\nto these howling gales will determine the contours of \r\nthe post-crisis world and the relevance of this \r\ninstitution in that world. Will the international \r\ncommunity shield the vulnerable from these winds? \r\nWill we harness their power for positive change? Or \r\nwill we become little more than unnecessary weather \r\nforecasters, watching and warning about which way the \r\nwinds blow, but never acting for the benefit of our \r\npeoples’ humanization? \r\n The President has wisely selected “The role of \r\nmediation in the settlement of disputes” as the theme of \r\nthis general debate. That theme could not be more apt \r\nor timely. Too often, the difficult work of mediation, \r\nnegotiation and peaceful resolution of disputes is \r\nprematurely abandoned in the search for a quick fix of \r\nmilitarism, brinkmanship or ill-advised unilateral \r\naction. The very drafters of hard-fought Security \r\nCouncil resolutions often cast aside the letter and spirit \r\nof those documents before their ink has dried, and the \r\nfrenzied pursuit of a military solution to every dispute \r\nis sometimes sickeningly palpable. \r\n All too frequently, the loudest champions of \r\nexpensive and unnecessary military action are those \r\nleaders of military Powers who sometimes seek to \r\nshore up sagging local political fortunes with bullets, \r\nbombs and the bodies of faceless foreigners in faraway \r\nlands. History has never been kind to such nakedly \r\npolitical crusades, and those who have sown the wind \r\nhave invariably reaped the whirlwind of their bloody \r\ncampaigns, long after the triumphalist glow has faded. \r\nNeocolonialist and imperialist adventures, however \r\ndisguised, will never triumph before the bar of history \r\nover a people’s right to self-determination and the \r\ninalienable embrace of sovereignty. \r\n The ongoing global economic and financial crisis \r\nis a devastating storm that has shown no signs of \r\nabating. Economies the world over remain in peril, and \r\nnone is immune from the widening and deepening \r\nfallout of this systemic crisis of ill-regulated financial \r\ninstitutions and the movement of capital. The effects of \r\nthe international global and financial meltdown are \r\nnow being felt well beyond the bottom lines of \r\nmultinational corporations. The macroeconomic and \r\ndevelopmental consequences of this economic tornado \r\nare now painfully apparent, as is the terrible impact on \r\nthe lives of individuals. \r\n The economic crisis has spurred rising global \r\nunemployment and poverty, and has engendered a \r\nfeeling of hopelessness, especially among young \r\npeople. The continuing fallout of the economic \r\nupheaval can be felt in streets and cities around the \r\nworld and is a major contributor to the global unrest \r\nthat has pitted disgruntled youths and others in violent \r\nopposition to Government forces, from Tottenham to \r\nTripoli. Social unrest elsewhere beckons, in dozens of \r\ncountries where neither the socio-economic conditions \r\nnor the political institutions can contain the enormous \r\npressures much longer. \r\n Well into our third year of the international \r\neconomic crisis, we can now declare that the tepid and \r\ntimid responses of wealthy developed nations have \r\nfailed to heal the global economy. The uncoordinated \r\nlurches from stimulus to austerity and back typify the \r\nconfusion of the self-appointed premier forums of our \r\ninternational economic cooperation. The recovery that \r\nthey prematurely declared was false and fleeting, and \r\ntheir counsel of patience and predictions of long-term \r\nrecovery are cold comfort to the suffering peoples of \r\ncountries that did not contribute to the crisis. \r\n In small, vulnerable and highly indebted middle-\r\nincome economies such as ours, the economic debacle \r\nthreatens to have debilitating and ongoing \r\nconsequences. We cannot afford to wait for the promise \r\nof incremental or cyclical up-ticks in the global \r\neconomy. Small States need the fiscal and policy space \r\nto creatively spur development in ways that comply not \r\nwith the checklists of discredited economic theorists, \r\nbut with real-world particularities and people-centred \r\npolicies. The international financial institutions have \r\nyet to sufficiently grasp this simple fact. \r\n The General Assembly must reassert its role in \r\nthe response to the international economic crisis. In the \r\nearly days of the global economic deterioration, Saint \r\nVincent and the Grenadines played a leading role in the \r\nUnited Nations Conference on the World Financial and \r\nEconomic Crisis and its Impact on Development. \r\nUnder the President’s leadership, the Assembly must \r\nnow meaningfully follow up on the unfulfilled \r\nrecommendations and mechanisms spelled out at that \r\nA/66/PV.22  \r\n \r\n11-51360 18 \r\n \r\nConference. The Caribbean region has a vested interest \r\nin this most urgent of matters. \r\n This year, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines was \r\nthe subject of a United Nations resolution (65/136) that \r\ncalled upon the international community to provide \r\nassistance in the wake of Hurricane Tomas, which \r\ncaused millions of dollars of damage in our region. \r\nWhile we are extremely grateful to the many countries \r\nthat contributed generously to the emergency response, \r\nour national and regional recovery is far from \r\ncomplete. In the light of the welcome call by the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly to focus on disaster \r\nprevention and response during the current session, I \r\nremind the international community of our continuing \r\nrecovery efforts and the ongoing vulnerability of small \r\nisland developing States during the still active 2011 \r\nAtlantic hurricane season. \r\n I remain baffled by the intransigence of major \r\nemitters and developed nations that refuse to shoulder \r\nthe burden for arresting the climate changes that are \r\nlinked to the excesses of their own wasteful policies. \r\nAs Hurricanes Irene and Katia crept northward to \r\ntypically untouched cities in the United States and the \r\nUnited Kingdom, we in the Caribbean felt saddened at \r\nthe extensive damage and tragic loss of life, which is \r\nan annual occurrence in our region. We can only hope \r\nthat our now-common experiences can engender a level \r\nof solidarity and constructive engagement that will lead \r\nto binding and meaningful emissions reduction targets \r\nand the fulfilment of commitments on adaptation \r\nfinancing for vulnerable small island developing \r\nStates. Time is running out on the very existence of \r\nmany countries in the face of rising oceans and \r\nincreasingly intense storms.  \r\n I am heartened that the President of the General \r\nAssembly has decided to place special emphasis on \r\nsustainable development and global prosperity during \r\nthe current session. But the citizens of the world, and \r\nindeed many of its Governments, have lost faith in \r\nendless self-important summits that produce little in \r\nthe way of tangible results. The archives of the United \r\nNations are filled with grandiloquent declarations and \r\noutcome documents from summits whose commitments \r\nwere forgotten even before representatives had boarded \r\ntheir planes to return home from their exotic venues. \r\n Next year, the issue of development returns to \r\nLatin America for the United Nations Conference on \r\nSustainable Development (Rio+20) in Brazil. Rio+20 \r\nwill take place one decade after Mexico’s heralded \r\nMonterrey Consensus, in which developed countries \r\ncommitted themselves to the target of devoting 0.7 per \r\ncent of their gross national income to official \r\ndevelopment assistance to developing countries. Today, \r\neven accepting the liberal definitions and creative \r\naccounting used by some States to measure \r\ndevelopment assistance, developed countries are \r\ncontributing only 0.32 per cent of their gross national \r\nincome to official development assistance — less than \r\nhalf of the Monterrey target. We just have to make this \r\nbetter. We must do it right. It is just not good for us to \r\nbe taken for a ride all of these years with all of these \r\npromises. It must come to an end sometime, and the \r\nworld is changing. Let us get it right. It is our \r\nresponsibility. Please.  \r\n In that regard, our dreams remain constantly \r\nunfulfilled. I am reminded of the poetic inquiry of \r\nLangston Hughes, an authentic voice of America, who \r\nasked simply this: \r\n “What happens to a dream deferred? \r\nDoes it dry up \r\nlike a raisin in the sun? \r\nOr fester like a sore — \r\nAnd then run? \r\nDoes it stink like rotten meat? \r\nOr crust and sugar over — \r\nlike a syrupy sweet? \r\nMaybe it just sags like a heavy load. \r\nOr does it explode?” \r\nRecent events in the streets of major cities around the \r\nworld have probably answered Langston Hughes’ \r\nqueries. Talk is cheap. We must get some action.  \r\n It should be a source of alarm and international \r\nembarrassment that the composition of the Security \r\nCouncil is an ossified relic of the Second World War, \r\nseemingly immune to the modern realities of new \r\ncountries and new global Powers. It is an outrageous \r\nact of international irresponsibility that such an \r\noutmoded and increasingly illegitimate body is allowed \r\nto decisively insert itself into local and regional \r\nconflicts. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is adamant \r\nthat the Security Council must be reformed, and that \r\nthe reform must be underpinned by the expansion of \r\nthe Council in the permanent and non-permanent \r\ncategories alike, with full regard for the legitimate \r\naspirations of Africa and the necessary \r\naccommodations for small island developing States, \r\n A/66/PV.22\r\n \r\n19 11-51360 \r\n \r\nwhich have valuable and creative perspectives on \r\npeacebuilding and conflict resolution. \r\n The International Year for People of African \r\nDescent, which was declared with much fanfare, is \r\nalmost at an end. I am grateful to the United Nations, \r\nwhich has hosted a number of events to raise \r\nawareness of the challenges facing people of African \r\ndescent and foster discussions on potential solutions to \r\ntackle those challenges. \r\n Racial discrimination was justified and itself \r\nbecame the justification for a brutal, exploitative and \r\ndehumanizing system. That system was perfected \r\nduring the transatlantic slave trade and ingrained over \r\nthe course of colonial domination. The structure of the \r\nmodern world is still firmly rooted in a past of slavers \r\nand colonialist exploitation. Today, every single \r\ncountry of the world with a population of majority \r\nAfrican descent is still trapped in the periphery of our \r\nglobal economic and developmental systems. The \r\npeoples of African descent remain disadvantaged, \r\nindividually and systemically, by the entrenched and \r\nunyielding cycle of discrimination. Indeed, many of the \r\nwars that the United Nations struggles mightily to quell \r\nor avoid are rooted in the ignorant and avaricious \r\ncartography of the European colonizers. \r\n The people of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines \r\nhave a long and proud history of resistance to slavery, \r\nbigotry and genocide, dating back to the heroic \r\nresistance of the Garifuna people against British \r\naggression in the late 1700s. While we celebrate the \r\nnoble heroism of the famous and the faceless alike who \r\nresisted racist colonial hegemony, we must continue to \r\nconfront the legacy of this barbarism and continuing \r\ninjustice. The wounds of that era are deep, the crimes \r\nagainst humanity are clear and the necessity for \r\napology and reparations is undeniable; we cannot duck \r\nthose. When we speak this year about the peoples of \r\nAfrican descent, we must highlight what is happening \r\nin the Horn of Africa and in Haiti.  \r\n The collective voices of the international \r\ncommunity are rising to a crescendo in support of full \r\nPalestinian statehood. Saint Vincent and the \r\nGrenadines echoes the relevant portions of yesterday’s \r\nGroup of 77 ministerial declaration, which welcomed \r\nthe State of Palestine’s application for full membership \r\nin the United Nations. The State of Palestine has \r\nbrought its case to this world Assembly in keeping with \r\nthe finest traditions of multilateralism. No one should \r\ncall the Palestinian acts unilateral. They come here to \r\nthe multilateral body. We have no doubt that its action \r\nand the solidarity of the international community will \r\nresuscitate the moribund negotiating process between \r\nthe Palestinian and Israeli States. \r\n As I reflect on the sweeping geopolitical changes \r\nbeing wrought in our global village, I am compelled to \r\nraise the fact that there is no practical, legal or logical \r\njustification for the seeming indifference of the United \r\nNations to the meaningful participation of Taiwan in \r\nour important work. Surely, in the context of an ever-\r\nexpanding and inclusive United Nations, the 23 million \r\ncitizens of Taiwan can, at the very least, be allowed to \r\nmeaningfully participate in the specialized agencies of \r\nthe Organization — and that should extend beyond the \r\nWorld Trade Organization and the World Health \r\nAssembly.  \r\n Mr. Al-Nasser assumes the presidency amid a \r\ncyclone of international turbulence and change. We \r\nmay not be able to direct those winds, but we can, and \r\nmust, adjust our sails to harness the energy and the \r\npotential of this moment, while riding out the storms of \r\nuncertainty and upheaval. Former United States \r\nPresident Abraham Lincoln once said, in a different \r\ncontext:  \r\n  “The dogmas of the quiet past are \r\ninadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is \r\npiled high with difficulty, and we must rise with \r\nthe occasion. As our case is new, so we must \r\nthink anew and act anew.” \r\n Our stormy present requires similar resolve, \r\ncreativity and action. Let us rise to the occasion and \r\nfulfil the immense potential of this peaceful global \r\nAssembly. Into those swirling winds of change, let us \r\nraise the flag of inclusiveness, equality, peace, justice \r\nand development for all the peoples of the world to see. \r\nMay Almighty God continue to bless us all. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of Saint \r\nVincent and the Grenadines for the statement he has \r\njust made. \r\n Mr. Ralph Gonsalves, Prime Minister of Saint \r\nVincent and the Grenadines, was escorted from \r\nthe rostrum. \r\n \r\nA/66/PV.22  \r\n \r\n11-51360 20 \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Baburam Bhattarai, Prime \r\nMinister of the Federal Democratic Republic \r\nof Nepal  \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Federal \r\nDemocratic Republic of Nepal. \r\n Mr. Baburam Bhattarai, Prime Minister of the \r\nFederal Democratic Republic of Nepal, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum. \r\n The Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Baburam Bhattarai, \r\nPrime Minister of the Federal Democratic Republic of \r\nNepal, and inviting him to address the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n Mr. Bhattarai (Nepal): Let me begin by \r\ncongratulating the President on his election to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth \r\nsession. Let me also express our sincere appreciation to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, Secretary-General of \r\nthe United Nations, for the strong commitment and \r\ndedication with which he has been serving the United \r\nNations. We wish him further success in his second \r\nterm.  \r\n Nepal warmly welcomes the Republic of South \r\nSudan as the newest member of the United Nations. \r\n It is a distinct honour and privilege for me to \r\nbring to the General Assembly the voice of the \r\nvoiceless of the world. I have brought with me \r\ngreetings from the nearly 30 million toiling, but proud, \r\npeople of Nepal, who have recently liberated \r\nthemselves from an age-old feudal monarchy and \r\nautocracy. Nepal is the enchanting land of Mount \r\nEverest, the top of the world. It is the birthplace of \r\nGautam Buddha, the apostle of peace. It possesses an \r\nunbelievable variety of natural beauty and diversity. \r\n In recent years, a momentous transformation has \r\ntaken place in Nepal. After a long and persistent \r\nstruggle, the feudalistic and autocratic monarchy has \r\nbeen abolished. We have entered into a new historic era \r\nwith the creation of the new Federal Democratic \r\nRepublic of Nepal. Today, the new State apparatus \r\nstrives to take into account the multi-ethnic, \r\nmultilingual and multicultural diversity of the country. \r\nThe abolition of all discrimination and oppression on \r\nthe basis of class, gender, nationality, region and caste \r\nand the creation of an inclusive democratic system and \r\na just society are at the heart of all our decades-long \r\nstruggles. Thanks to the ultimate sacrifice of the \r\nthousands of martyrs of the historic people’s war of \r\n1996 to 2006, the people’s movement of 2006, the \r\nMadheshi movement and many other oppressed \r\npeople’s movements, we have come this far to lay the \r\nfoundation of a new Nepal.  \r\n We must consolidate those historic gains and \r\ninstitutionalize them in order to establish sustainable \r\npeace, justice and prosperity for all. My Government is \r\nfully committed to doing that with the conclusion of \r\nthe peace process and the writing of a new constitution \r\nthrough the Constituent Assembly at the earliest. The \r\nconstitution will not only guarantee fundamental \r\ndemocratic norms and values, but it will also ensure \r\nthat our multiparty democracy is inclusive, \r\nparticipatory and life-changing for all, especially the \r\noppressed labouring masses and marginalized people. \r\nIt is rightly said that the highest measure of democracy \r\nis neither the extent of freedom nor the extent of \r\nequality; rather, it is the highest measure of \r\nparticipation. We want to institutionalize a genuinely \r\nparticipatory democracy for all, particularly those who \r\nare downtrodden. \r\n In that context, I would like to remind the \r\nAssembly of the poignant words expressed from this \r\nrostrum in 2008 by the Chairman of my party, the \r\nUnified Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist, and the \r\nthen Prime Minister, Comrade Prachanda, about the \r\nlandless peasants, the downtrodden women, the so-\r\ncalled untouchable dalits and the millions of exploited \r\nmasses of Nepal, who aspire to liberation from all \r\nforms of oppression and exploitation. \r\n Nepal’s home-driven peace process and historic \r\ntransformation are unique and could be a good example \r\nfor drawing lessons. We believe that transformation has \r\nto be holistic in order to have a long-lasting impact at \r\nthe grass-roots level. Transformation in the political, \r\nsocial and economic fields has to be brought about \r\nholistically. It is attainable with dedication, dialogue \r\nand consensus-building among stakeholders. As in any \r\nother country, transitional pains and delays exist. \r\nHowever, we are united in our vision, and we intend to \r\ncomplete the transition process with the consensus and \r\ncooperation of all political parties and stakeholders. We \r\nare confident that, with international goodwill and \r\ncooperation, we will achieve it at the earliest. \r\n Nepal’s foreign policy is based on the \r\nfundamental principles of the United Nations Charter, \r\n A/66/PV.22\r\n \r\n21 11-51360 \r\n \r\nnon-alignment and panchsheel and the promotion of \r\nregional cooperation through the South Asian \r\nAssociation for Regional Cooperation. We would like \r\nto be a vibrant bridge between our two neighbours, \r\nIndia and China, and beyond. At a time when \r\nhumankind is so much in need of peace and when we \r\nall strive for it, we particularly appeal for the \r\ndevelopment of Lumbini, the birthplace of Buddha, as \r\nthe fountain of world peace through effective \r\ninternational support and cooperation. The \r\nInternational Committee for the Development of \r\nLumbini needs to be reactivated at the earliest. \r\n I extend sincere thanks to the United Nations, \r\nespecially the United Nations Mission in Nepal, for \r\nproviding invaluable support and assistance throughout \r\nour peace process. We are hopeful that we will \r\ncontinue to receive the goodwill and support of the \r\ninternational community in our efforts to \r\ninstitutionalize lasting peace, equity and prosperity in \r\nthe country. The United Nations upholds the noble \r\nvision of peace and security, development, justice and \r\nhuman rights for all. But if we look around the world, \r\nwe have a long way to go to achieve this. We still face \r\nconflicts, deprivation and demeaning poverty all \r\naround us. How can we achieve sustainable peace in \r\nthe world when there is so much inequity, deprivation \r\nand marginalization around us? We have to deal with \r\ntheir root causes. How can one justify the spending of \r\n$1.5 trillion on war weapons every year while more \r\nthan 2 billion people across the globe lack the basic \r\nnecessities of food, medicine, et cetera? \r\n In that context, I appeal to the United Nations to \r\ncome forward with a far-reaching and comprehensive \r\ndevelopment package. We need a new Marshall Plan \r\nfor the rebuilding and reconstruction of post-conflict \r\ncountries. Lip service and symbolic support are not \r\nenough. It is now time for a bold, visionary step to deal \r\nwith the complex problems of today that would be the \r\nmost cost-effective approach to deal with global \r\nproblems and ensure sustainable peace. \r\n The principles and purposes of the Organization \r\nas enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations \r\nrepresent the highest ideals of the global community. \r\nYet we live in an age of paradox. The gap between the \r\npoor and the rich is ever-widening. Today, the level of \r\ninequality between States is the highest of any time in \r\nthe past. Least developed countries (LDCs) — or, as I \r\nwould prefer to call them, underdeveloped countries — \r\nare facing the full force of the negative side of \r\nglobalization that is its deep structural constraints.  \r\n Growing joblessness is a major challenge for all \r\nof us. In this integrated world, the grinding poverty of \r\nthe masses, who number in the billions, is a recipe for \r\ndisaster. Islands of prosperity amid a sea of poverty are \r\nunsustainable, morally indefensible and economically \r\nundesirable. In a globalized and interconnected world, \r\nour destiny is inextricably intertwined. When my house \r\nis on fire, your house cannot be safe, and vice versa. \r\n The recurrence of economic and financial crises, \r\nfuel and food crises and the deeper structural crises \r\nhave vindicated the need to seriously review the \r\ncurrent economic paradigm. I believe that now is the \r\nright time for deeper soul-searching and the creation of \r\na new, just and scientific economic order. The new \r\nglobal economic order needs to deal with the current \r\nglobal volatility and the growing marginalization of \r\npoor and weaker economies. The financial, capital-\r\ndriven globalization process is increasingly exposing \r\nits inherent structural deficiencies and its \r\nincompatibility. Unless the interest of labour, the basic \r\nsource of human wealth, is duly integrated in this \r\nprocess, we may soon face the globalization of unrest \r\nand upheaval. The United Nations should act as the \r\nprincipal forum to examine that in a coherent, inclusive \r\nand holistic manner. \r\n Least developed countries face severe structural \r\nconstraints on their development efforts. Their \r\nvulnerabilities have been further aggravated by \r\nmultiple crises. Despite some good progress in \r\nachieving individual goals, LDCs as a group are mostly \r\noff-track in meeting the internationally agreed upon \r\ndevelopment goals, including those contained in the \r\nMillennium Declaration (resolution 55/2). A rights-\r\nbased approach to development is a must. \r\n It is quite disheartening that even today about \r\n75 per cent of LDC populations live in abject poverty \r\nand hunger. This situation is unacceptable and must \r\ncome to an end sooner rather than later. Business as \r\nusual will not be a solution to deep-rooted problems. \r\nThe historically structured process of “development of \r\nunderdevelopment” needs to be structurally addressed. \r\n The Istanbul Declaration and Programme of \r\nAction must be implemented in their entirety and in an \r\neffective and timely manner. In particular, financing \r\nfor development should be ensured as per the \r\ncommitment that has been made. Duty-free, quota-free \r\nA/66/PV.22  \r\n \r\n11-51360 22 \r\n \r\nmarket access and supply-side capacity must be \r\nensured to LDCs. Investment, technology transfer and \r\nprivate sector development should be promoted in \r\nLDCs. They are essential to achieving the legitimate \r\naspirations of LDCs. A renewed and strengthened \r\nglobal partnership is critical to their implementation. \r\nWe do not want to see another missed opportunity for \r\nLDCs. \r\n Nepal, in its capacity as Chair of the LDCs, will \r\nmake every effort, in cooperation with our fellow \r\nLDCs, to ensure that the issues and concerns of LDCs \r\nremain high on the priority list of the United Nations \r\ndevelopment agenda. Similarly, the special difficulties \r\nof landlocked developing countries should be \r\nrecognized. Freedom of transit should be ensured to \r\nthem as a matter of right, together with the scaling up \r\nof support for trade facilitation and infrastructure \r\ndevelopment. \r\n Labour migration is a global phenomenon. We \r\nmust protect the rights of all migrant workers and their \r\nfamily members to ensure that globalization is fair to \r\nall. As Nepal’s economy is increasingly dependent on \r\nremittances, that issue is very crucial for us. \r\n Clearly, climate change has emerged as one of the \r\ngreatest challenges of the twenty-first century. Global \r\nwarming has precipitated the melting of the snow in \r\nthe Nepal Himalayas, a source of fresh water for over \r\n1 billion people who live in South Asia. We have \r\ntherefore taken the initiative of promoting the \r\nsustainable mountain agenda in order to highlight their \r\nspecial vulnerabilities and fragilities. Industrialized \r\ncountries should bear greater responsibility for that. \r\n There is an urgent need to make progress in \r\nclimate negotiations and to ensure enhanced and \r\npredictable financing. The United Nations Conference \r\non Sustainable Development summit scheduled for \r\nnext year is critical to defining a more sustainable \r\ndevelopment path and to eradicating poverty for LDCs. \r\nThe sustainable development agenda should encompass \r\nall ecological considerations, including the crucial \r\nissue of sustainable mountain development. \r\n Nepal reiterates its call for the general and \r\ncomplete disarmament of all weapons of mass \r\ndestruction in a time-bound manner. Nepal strongly \r\nbelieves that regional mechanisms complement efforts \r\nto promote the global disarmament agenda. The United \r\nNations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in \r\nAsia and the Pacific, located in Kathmandu, could be \r\ninstrumental in revitalizing the Kathmandu process to \r\nfacilitate dialogue and deliberations on confidence-\r\nbuilding in the region. \r\n Nepal unequivocally condemns terrorism in all its \r\nforms and manifestations and calls for an expeditious \r\nconclusion of the negotiations on a comprehensive \r\nconvention on international terrorism. We should \r\ndifferentiate between terrorism and struggles for \r\nfreedom. \r\n Nepal’s commitment to human rights is deep and \r\nunflinching. We are fully aware that the protection and \r\npromotion of all human rights, including the right to \r\ndevelopment and fundamental freedoms, strengthens \r\nthe sustainability of peace and progress. We have \r\nestablished an independent constitutional body — the \r\nNational Human Rights Commission — as a watchdog \r\ninstitution. We are committed to building and \r\nstrengthening that specialized national institution as a \r\ntrue custodian of human rights. \r\n The General Assembly, which is the only \r\nuniversally representative body at the global level, \r\nneeds to be given commensurate power and authority \r\nto truly work as a world parliament. It should not \r\nremain toothless. Similarly, Nepal supports the \r\nexpansion in the membership of the Security Council \r\nin both categories. Reform must address all interrelated \r\nissues, such as representation, as well as transparency \r\nand accountability in the working methods of the \r\nSecurity Council. The role and contributions of smaller \r\nStates in the maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity must be duly acknowledged. \r\n We underline the crucial role of the United \r\nNations in promoting international cooperation for \r\ndevelopment. Its role in shaping the policy debate on, \r\nand establishing global norms in, economic and \r\nfinancial matters must be strengthened. Nepal \r\nwelcomes all efforts aimed at promoting system-wide \r\ncoherence, including the operationalization of \r\nUN-Women. \r\n Nepal’s participation in United Nations \r\npeacekeeping is long-standing and consistent. We \r\nremain steadfast in our commitment to international \r\npeace and security. Nepal has already provided more \r\nthan 80,000 peacekeepers, with 62 of our soldiers \r\nhaving laid down their lives in the line of duty. We \r\nwould therefore like to call for equitable representation \r\nat the leadership level. \r\n A/66/PV.22\r\n \r\n23 11-51360 \r\n \r\n In recent times, we have witnessed an outpouring \r\nof popular sentiment calling for change and freedom \r\naround the world. We believe that this is a sign of a \r\nnew beginning, where people are asserting themselves \r\nas the masters of their own destinies. We applaud these \r\nchanges. We should support them based on the \r\nfundamental principles of the United Nations. \r\nHowever, no one should hijack the agenda of \r\ndemocracy for partisan ends. \r\n The long-drawn-out peace process in the Middle \r\nEast is a matter of serious concern for us all. We must \r\nfind a comprehensive and just solution to these \r\nproblems. It is our principled position that we support a \r\nfully independent and sovereign Palestinian State based \r\non United Nations resolutions. We look forward to its \r\nmaterialization at the earliest date. \r\n Finally, let me reiterate that the United Nations \r\nprinciples must be holistic and should be pursued in a \r\nbalanced manner. The United Nations should not only \r\nbe the custodian of its noble principles; it must deliver \r\non its promises. Let it not be a mere umbrella for the \r\nbig Powers. In today’s globalized world, the United \r\nNations has more responsibility than ever before for \r\ncreating an inclusive and just global order. Let it not \r\nfalter in its historic duties. \r\n Let the United Nations serve the larger interests \r\nof the poor and the weakest segment of the \r\ninternational community. Let the economic \r\ntransformation of the least developed countries with a \r\nrights-based approach be at the top of the United \r\nNations agenda. Let the United Nations not fail the \r\naspirations of millions of people for freedom, equality \r\nand prosperity. Let its vision be translated into a visible \r\nchange in the lives of oppressed people. Last but not \r\nleast, let us keep in mind that either we all reach the \r\ngoal of global peace and prosperity together, or nobody \r\nwill. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nFederal Democratic Republic of Nepal for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Baburam Bhattarai, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Nepal, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Navinchandra Ramgoolam, \r\nPrime Minister, Minister of Defence, Home \r\nAffairs and External Communications, Minister \r\nof Civil Service and Administrative Reforms of \r\nthe Republic of Mauritius \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister, Minister of \r\nDefence, Home Affairs and External Communications, \r\nMinister of Civil Service and Administrative Reforms \r\nof the Republic of Mauritius  \r\n Mr. Navinchandra Ramgoolam, Prime Minister, \r\nMinister of Defence, Home Affairs and External \r\nCommunications, Minister of Civil Service and \r\nAdministrative Reforms of the Republic of \r\nMauritius, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have great pleasure in welcoming His \r\nExcellency Mr. Navinchandra Ramgoolam, Prime \r\nMinister, Minister of Defence, Home Affairs and \r\nExternal Communications, Minister of Civil Service \r\nand Administrative Reforms of the Republic of \r\nMauritius, and inviting him to address the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n Mr. Ramgoolam (Mauritius): The primary \r\npurpose of the United Nations is to maintain peace and \r\nsecurity, as set out in the very first Article of its \r\nCharter. This remains the top priority of the \r\ninternational community and of the United Nations. \r\n However, 66 years after the adoption of the \r\nCharter, our definition of peace and security differs \r\nfrom what it was in the immediate aftermath of the \r\nSecond World War. Our concerns today are wider than \r\nthe mere suppression of aggression or similar breaches \r\nof peace. We are now equally concerned about the \r\nthreats to peace and security resulting from factors \r\nother than armed aggression. Tensions exist, within \r\nnations and among nations, as a result of unequal \r\naccess to resources, the lack of food security, or \r\nexistential threats because of the inability to address \r\nclimate change issues. Insecurity also results from the \r\nabsence of an adequate international mechanism for the \r\nredress of grievances and the peaceful settlement of \r\ndisputes. \r\n I propose to deal with four of the constitutive \r\nelements of present-day security that the international \r\ncommunity and the United Nations should address, \r\nA/66/PV.22  \r\n \r\n11-51360 24 \r\n \r\nnamely, the elements of economic, environmental, \r\nhuman and legal security. \r\n When peoples and nations feel inextricably mired \r\nin poverty and face bleak prospects for development, \r\nthey are insecure about their future. That economic \r\ninsecurity may ultimately threaten global peace. The \r\ncurrent economic turmoil is deepening the despair of \r\nthose who live in need and is spreading despondency, \r\neven in relatively affluent countries. The world \r\neconomy has yet to recover from the crisis of 2008. \r\n Today, Europe and North America struggle with \r\nbudget deficits, unsustainable debts and high \r\nunemployment. At the same time, the recent political \r\nturmoil across the Middle East could mean that oil and \r\nfood prices will continue to rise. As developed \r\neconomies grapple with these serious challenges, the \r\ndeveloping world finds itself negatively impacted by \r\neconomic and financial crises resulting from failures in \r\nwhich it had absolutely no part. \r\n While the ability of established developed \r\ncountries to deal with economic and financial problems \r\nis in question, the world is witnessing the rapid rise of \r\na number of emerging economies. As the economic \r\ncentre of gravity shifts eastward and creates new \r\nopportunities, we must ensure that those formidable \r\nglobal challenges do not create economic insecurity for \r\nthose who feel left behind and that they do not lead to \r\nother threats to international security. \r\n It is imperative that we manage these \r\ntransformations judiciously and with pragmatism. In \r\nthat context, I must stress the particular economic \r\nvulnerabilities of small island developing States \r\n(SIDS). The economies of SIDS remain highly volatile \r\nbecause of their open economies, small economic size, \r\nnarrow resource base, disadvantages in economies of \r\nscale, high export concentration, dependency on \r\nimports and high vulnerability to energy- and food-\r\nprice shocks. \r\n We reiterate that SIDS need to be granted \r\npreferential treatment as part of a global strategy to \r\nensure economic security. Regrettably, SIDS have been \r\ndenied the formal recognition of their specific \r\nvulnerabilities that would entitle them to special \r\nconsideration. My delegation fully supports the \r\nimplementation of the Barbados Plan of Action and the \r\nMauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of \r\nthe Programme of Action for the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States. \r\n As there are increasing concerns over issues such \r\nas employment, food security, climate change and \r\naccess to water, it is a matter of regret that trade talks \r\nthat could give a boost to international trade, and \r\ntherefore to economic security, are stalled. \r\n On a broader note, I must say that talks on trade \r\nand other economic issues, to the extent that they take \r\nplace at all, are held in sectoral and often restricted \r\nforums. While the specialized nature of these \r\nnegotiations, or of the scope of the matters being \r\naddressed by standard-setting organizations, may \r\nrequire dedicated sectoral frameworks, it is imperative \r\nthat the international community ensures that those \r\nframeworks are legitimate ones, with universal \r\nmembership. It is also imperative that, as an apex body, \r\nthe United Nations have a holistic view on global \r\neconomic, financial, trade and development issues. \r\n During the 1970s, the United Nations played a \r\nsignificant role in shaping the conceptual framework \r\nfor a new international economic order. The United \r\nNations has adopted a number of landmark resolutions \r\nthat have laid the normative foundation for a more \r\nequitable economic order. The United Nations still has \r\na role to play in shaping the world economic order to \r\nensure economic security, in accordance with its \r\nmandate under the Charter. The United Nations is the \r\nonly international organization with not just the \r\nnecessary legitimacy and universality but also the \r\nresponsibility to have an overview of global economic \r\ndevelopment. In doing so, the United Nations will \r\nensure policy coordination among forums for various \r\nsectors, set principles and guidelines for sector-specific \r\nnegotiations, and assume its ultimate responsibility for \r\nthe economic security of all nations. \r\n To reaffirm its responsibility with respect to \r\neconomic security, the United Nations must not only \r\nundergo reforms in its institutions and working \r\nmethods, it must also re-balance its focus on political \r\nand economic issues. In this regard, the Economic and \r\nSocial Council must be given the prominence it was \r\nintended to have as one of the principal organs of the \r\nUnited Nations. And in assuming its responsibility with \r\nrespect to economic security, a reformed and \r\nrevitalized United Nations will have to work more \r\nclosely with regional cooperative institutions, which \r\nare the pillars of international cooperation. \r\n The high food prices of 2007 and 2008 and the \r\nglobal economic crisis led millions of people into food \r\n A/66/PV.22\r\n \r\n25 11-51360 \r\n \r\ninsecurity and raised the total number of people who \r\ngo hungry to more than 1 billion. Commodity prices \r\nremain high and the risk of repeated crises is real. With \r\nthe projected increase in world population to \r\n9.1 billion by 2050, and the rising costs of production, \r\nthere is a risk of persistent price volatility. That will be \r\nexacerbated by the effects of climate change. The \r\ninternational community must therefore seriously \r\naddress the issue of food insecurity around the world.  \r\n Economic security also entails working towards a \r\nmore inclusive national society without discrimination, \r\neliminating inequalities and fostering wider \r\nparticipation on the part of all sections of the \r\ncommunity in national development and governance. \r\n Two days ago, at our 14th meeting, we gathered \r\nto commemorate the tenth anniversary of the adoption \r\nof the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action. \r\nWe welcome the progress achieved in the fight against \r\nracism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related \r\nintolerance since 2001. We nonetheless recognize that \r\nin spite of these efforts, many people continue to be \r\nvictims of these despicable practices. \r\n We commend the United Nations on the success \r\nof the High-level Meeting of the General Assembly on \r\nYouth (see A/65/PVs.111 and 112) and the adoption of \r\nthe outcome document (resolution 65/312). \r\nDevelopment and security will require greater \r\nparticipation by young people in the formulation of \r\nstrategies and policies.  \r\n In that same spirit, we welcome the establishment \r\nof UN-Women and its overarching vision of a world in \r\nwhich societies are free of gender-based discrimination \r\nand where women and men have equal opportunities, \r\nrespect and consideration. A more inclusive world, \r\nwhere women’s intellectual and economic potential is \r\nfully realized, will promote economic security. \r\n In June of next year, world leaders will meet in \r\nRio de Janeiro to renew their political commitment to \r\nsustainable development and, hopefully, to adopt \r\nconcrete measures that will contribute to greater \r\neconomic security. But before we can move ahead, we \r\nwill also have to consider why so many past \r\ncommitments have not been honoured. We look \r\nforward to the oceans receiving the attention that they \r\ndeserve at Rio, as part of the broader economic agenda. \r\nSmall island States in particular are relying on the \r\ninternational community to give due attention to the \r\nsustainability of the oceans in the context of the United \r\nNations Conference on Sustainable Development \r\n(Rio+20) and beyond. The sustainability of oceans is \r\ncrucial to the security and, in some cases, the very \r\nsurvival of many small island States. \r\n Humanity as a whole is now increasingly \r\nconcerned about its environmental security, probably \r\nmore than it has ever been in its history. For some \r\nsmall island nations, this concern is, in fact, an \r\nexistential one. In recent decades the United Nations \r\nhas brought to the fore the concept of sustainable \r\ndevelopment and the measures required to promote \r\nsuch development. The preparatory work under way for \r\nRio+20 has highlighted the serious gaps we still face in \r\nthis area. The disruptions resulting from climate \r\nchange pose a real threat to global security. \r\n Climate change is real. Extreme weather \r\nphenomena such as super-storms, floods, droughts and \r\nheat-waves are already upon us. Climate change is \r\naffecting us in our daily life, and it threatens the very \r\nsurvival of many small islands. Mauritius is already \r\nexperiencing the adverse effects of climate change. Air \r\ntemperature has risen by 0.6° to 1.1°C in different \r\nmicroclimates over recent decades. The sea level is \r\nrising at the rate of 1.2 millimetres per year in the \r\nsouth-west Indian Ocean. Our annual rainfall has \r\ndecreased by 8 per cent compared to the 1950s. \r\nExtreme weather conditions such as flooding are \r\nbecoming more frequent. \r\n Without international cooperation and concerted \r\naction, the impact of climate change will be \r\ndevastating for all our nations. My delegation firmly \r\nbelieves that the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change is the primary \r\ninternational, intergovernmental forum for negotiating \r\nthe global response to climate change. Small island \r\nnations are economically vulnerable, and their \r\nvulnerability is exacerbated by the dramatic \r\nconsequences of climate change. Small island States \r\nrely on the international community for their security. \r\n Mauritius is committed to the concept of the \r\ngreen economy. We recognize that it is not a one-size-\r\nfits-all notion. Countries need to reflect their own \r\nnational priorities and realities in their implementation \r\nof it.  \r\n My Government has been pursuing a sustainable \r\ndevelopment strategy. The Maurice Ile Durable project, \r\nwhich we adopted in 2008, is taking shape, and a \r\nwhole range of measures have already been \r\nA/66/PV.22  \r\n \r\n11-51360 26 \r\n \r\nimplemented. We propose to increase the share of \r\nrenewable energy in the generation of power from the \r\npresent 18 per cent to 35 per cent by 2025, by making \r\nmore intensive use of biofuels and wave, solar and \r\nwind energy. To that end in May last year I set up a \r\nfull-fledged ministry with responsibility for sustainable \r\ndevelopment. We are engaged in a national \r\nconsultation process to formulate strategies and \r\npolicies that have public support and are designed to \r\nprotect the environment, deliver social justice and \r\ncreate a sustainable economy. \r\n Climate has impacted the water cycle both \r\ndirectly and indirectly, and will continue to do so, by \r\naffecting precipitation and evaporation cycles as well \r\nas water availability and patterns of water \r\nconsumption. Many regions of the world are already \r\nexperiencing reduced rainfall. As climate change \r\nintensifies and water scarcity becomes more acute, the \r\nthreat of tensions among different nations and different \r\nusers may increase. The international community must \r\ntherefore work together to address this pressing issue. \r\nEnvironmental security must be a priority of the United \r\nNations in promoting global security. \r\n As well as dealing with the existential threat that \r\nclimate change poses for some nations, people around \r\nthe world continue to be concerned about their own \r\nsecurity. I will mention four such concerns.  \r\n Disarmament is a major component of \r\ninternational security strategy. The threat to humanity \r\nposed by the continued existence of nuclear and other \r\nweapons of mass destruction is a universal concern. \r\nOur failure to resolve the issue of disarmament \r\ncontinues to undermine global development and \r\nsecurity. A significant reduction in the production of \r\nconventional weapons and eventually a world free of \r\nnuclear weapons are goals that will be achieved only \r\nover time, and that will require patience and \r\nperseverance. As a matter of fact, the international \r\npolitical environment is now probably more conducive \r\nto the realization of these goals than it has ever been. \r\n Terrorism continues to be a threat to security. \r\nRecent events have reminded us that acts of terrorism \r\ncan be perpetrated by extremists from all points on the \r\npolitical spectrum, and that terrorism is equally capable \r\nof breeding in both poor and rich countries. The \r\ninternational community needs to follow up on the \r\nUnited Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and \r\nenhance international cooperation in that regard. \r\n The World Drug Report 2011 again shows that \r\ndrug trafficking and consumption remain significant. \r\nNarco-trafficking and drug money in organized crime \r\nand terrorist activities are a threat to stability and \r\nsecurity at the national and regional levels. As we \r\ncelebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the 1961 Single \r\nConvention on Narcotic Drugs, let us recommit our \r\nefforts to fight drug trafficking as part of the global \r\nstrategy to ensure human security. \r\n We are 30 years into the fight against HIV/AIDS, \r\nwhich is an ever-present threat to human security. I am \r\nconvinced that we have achieved more in the 10 years \r\nsince the special session of the General Assembly on \r\nHIV/AIDS than we did in the previous two decades. It \r\nis heartening that the High-level Meeting on \r\nHIV/AIDS held in June renewed the political \r\ncommitment of Governments to halting and reversing \r\nthe spread of HIV/AIDS and to ensuring that, by 2015, \r\nno child is born with HIV (see resolution 65/277, \r\nannex). \r\n Mauritius fully adheres to the UNAIDS vision of \r\nuniting for universal access. The National AIDS \r\nSecretariat, which I set up in May 2007, pursues its \r\nwork to achieve zero new infections, zero \r\ndiscrimination and zero AIDS-related deaths in \r\nMauritius. \r\n Article 2 of the United Nations Charter provides \r\nthat all Members shall settle their disputes by peaceful \r\nmeans. Article 33 spells out the means and ways of \r\ndoing so. In the same spirit, the Charter provides in \r\nChapter XIV for the establishment of the International \r\nCourt of Justice. \r\n However, recourse to international adjudication \r\nfor the peaceful settlement of disputes between States \r\nhas, historically, required the consent of the States \r\nconcerned. In recent times, a number of bilateral or \r\nmultilateral agreements have provided for the prior \r\ncommitment of States to submit to arbitration or \r\nadjudication. We welcome that development. \r\n Security requires the appropriate legal framework \r\nfor the redress of grievances or the settlement of \r\ndisputes. The international community has yet to set up \r\nadequate machinery for the peaceful settlement of \r\ndisputes that is available to all States. \r\n The General Assembly has decided to convene a \r\nhigh-level meeting during the sixty-seventh session on \r\nthe rule of law. We welcome that decision, but we want \r\n A/66/PV.22\r\n \r\n27 11-51360 \r\n \r\nto stress that the debate on the rule of law must apply \r\nat both the national and international level. We would \r\ntherefore look forward to the Assembly discussing the \r\nrule of law as it applies to inter-State relations as part \r\nof the forthcoming debates. \r\n Allow me to give as an example the difficulties \r\nthat my own country has experienced in resolving a \r\ndispute with the former colonial Power, the United \r\nKingdom, relating to decolonization. The Chagos \r\nArchipelago, which is part of Mauritian territory, was \r\nexcised from Mauritius prior to independence, in total \r\ndisregard of resolutions 1514 (XV) and 2066 (XX) and \r\nthe principles of international law, and was declared \r\nthe so-called British Indian Ocean Territory. The \r\nUnited Kingdom has failed to engage in any \r\nmeaningful discussions with us on the matter. \r\n When the Government of Mauritius consequently \r\nannounced in 2004 that it would refer the dispute to the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, the United Kingdom \r\nimmediately amended its declaration, under Article 36 \r\nof the Court’s Statute, to reject the jurisdiction of the \r\nCourt with respect to certain disputes with a member or \r\nformer member of the Commonwealth. That illustrates \r\nthe kind of difficulties that a State may face in settling \r\na claim under international law. The States involved in \r\nthe dispute may refuse to negotiate in good faith and \r\nseek to ensure that no international tribunal can \r\ndetermine the law applicable to the dispute.  \r\n We call on the United Nations to keep under \r\nreview the whole issue of the settlement of disputes, \r\nincluding by judicial means, and to set standards of \r\nconduct for all States with respect to negotiation, \r\nconciliation, mediation or other forms of non-judicial \r\nand peaceful settlement of disputes or, alternatively, to \r\nthe submission of the dispute to adjudication. \r\n In that context, Mauritius is particularly pleased \r\nto welcome the decision of the President of the General \r\nAssembly to adopt as the theme of its current session \r\nthe role of mediation in settling international disputes. \r\nWe affirm our full support in advancing that cause. \r\n Greater legal security also requires better global \r\ngovernance. In that respect, the United Nations must \r\nlead by example. The United Nations must recognize \r\nthat the world has changed since 1945. Current efforts \r\nto adopt reforms in relation to the Security Council, the \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly and the working \r\nmethods of our Organization must be given the sincere \r\nand strong support that is required. \r\n My delegation continues to believe that \r\ncomprehensive reform of the Security Council should \r\ninclude reform in the membership of both the \r\npermanent and the non-permanent categories. Africa \r\nshould no longer be deprived of its right to permanent \r\nrepresentation on the Council. My delegation fully \r\nsupports the African common position enshrined in the \r\nEzulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration. \r\n We equally believe that Latin America also fully \r\ndeserves permanent representation on the Council. \r\nMauritius further reiterates its support for India’s \r\nrightful aspiration to a permanent seat in a reformed \r\nSecurity Council. \r\n We also look forward to a more all-inclusive \r\nUnited Nations system that can effectively address \r\nissues of international security, with the admission of \r\nPalestine as a Member State. The United Nations and \r\nthe international community have a duty to restore to \r\nthe Palestinian people their dignity and their right to \r\nstatehood and security. Mauritius supports the \r\napplication for full membership of the United Nations, \r\nsubmitted to the Secretary-General yesterday by the \r\nPresident of the State of Palestine (A/66/371, annex), \r\nand the legitimate aspiration of the Palestinian people \r\nto take their rightful place in the international \r\ncommunity. We welcome the statement by President \r\nAbbas at the 19th meeting that Palestine extends its \r\nhands to the Israeli Government and the Israeli people \r\nfor peacemaking and for building cooperative relations \r\nbetween the States of Palestine and Israel. \r\n We are also pleased to welcome the emergence of \r\nSouth Sudan as an independent and a sovereign State \r\nand its admission to the United Nations. \r\n Before I conclude, I wish to say a few words \r\nabout matters of interest to our region. \r\n As a coastal State of the Indian Ocean, Mauritius \r\nis concerned by piracy, which poses a threat to global \r\ncommerce. It hinders economic development and has \r\nbecome a major security issue in the region and \r\nbeyond. We welcome the response of the international \r\ncommunity to that serious threat. Cognizant of the \r\nproblems that arise in connection with the prosecution \r\nand detention of pirates, Mauritius has offered to assist \r\nwith the prosecution and detention of pirates. Mauritius \r\nand the European Union signed an agreement in July \r\nthis year to enhance our capacity to contribute to the \r\ninternational effort under way in that regard. \r\nA/66/PV.22  \r\n \r\n11-51360 28 \r\n \r\n If the international response to the famine in \r\nSomalia is not commensurate with the immense and \r\nimmediate needs of the people, we fear that the \r\nproblem of piracy will only worsen. \r\n The continued unlawful occupation of the Chagos \r\nArchipelago by the United Kingdom is a matter of \r\nconcern for the region. Mauritius welcomes the support \r\nof the African Union and of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement for the territorial integrity of our country. \r\nThe purported declaration of a marine protected area \r\naround the Chagos Archipelago by the United \r\nKingdom, in breach of the United Nations Convention \r\non the Law of the Sea, is another cause for concern. \r\nThat is why, in December of last year, Mauritius \r\ncommenced arbitration proceedings against the United \r\nKingdom under the 1982 Convention on the Law of the \r\nSea. \r\n As regards Tromelin, Mauritius and France made \r\nprogress with an agreement on joint management, \r\nwithout prejudice to our sovereignty. However, we \r\nneed to continue our dialogue for at the end of the day, \r\nthe territorial integrity of Mauritius will not be \r\ncomplete without the return of Tromelin. \r\n As a member of the Southern African \r\nDevelopment Community (SADC) and current Chair of \r\nthe Indian Ocean Commission, Mauritius welcomes the \r\nsigning last week of an agreement between leading \r\nstakeholders on a road map for the restoration of \r\ndemocracy in our neighbouring State of Madagascar. \r\nThat agreement was reached following the relentless \r\nefforts of SADC and the Indian Ocean Commission to \r\nbring the parties together. Implementation of the road \r\nmap requires the holding of national and local \r\nelections, for which significant resources need to be \r\nmobilized. We call on the United Nations and the \r\ninternational community to extend all their support for \r\nthe successful implementation of the road map. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n The lack of security on the economic, \r\nenvironmental, legal or even, in some cases, existential \r\nfronts calls for a review of the mandated obligations of \r\nthe United Nations. While the initial concerns of the \r\nfounding fathers about threats to international security \r\nremain valid, the international community today is just \r\nas concerned by other threats to its security and other \r\nchallenges to be tackled. \r\n I would add that, in updating this concept of \r\nsecurity and, by extension, in redefining the role of the \r\nUnited Nations, the international community must also \r\nfoster dialogue among cultures and civilizations. We \r\nwelcome the Secretary-General’s initiative to create the \r\nAlliance of Civilizations, whose mission is to improve \r\nunderstanding and relations among nations and peoples \r\nof different cultures and religions and to assist efforts \r\nto halt the forces that fuel divisions and extremism.  \r\n Tensions are often caused by ignorance, by fear \r\nof others and by feelings of justice denied. Thus it is \r\ncrucial not only to maintain dialogue among nations \r\nand peoples, but also to promote the understanding of \r\ncultures and civilizations. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister, Minister \r\nof Defence, Home Affairs and External \r\nCommunications, Minister of Civil Service and \r\nAdministrative Reforms of the Republic of Mauritius \r\nfor the statement he has just made.  \r\n Mr. Navinchandra Ramgoolam, Prime Minister, \r\nMinister of Defence, Home Affairs and External \r\nCommunications, Minister of Civil Service and \r\nAdministrative Reforms of the Republic of \r\nMauritius, was escorted from the rostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Sali Berisha, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Republic of Albania \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof Albania. \r\n Mr. Sali Berisha, Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof Albania, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Sali Berisha, Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Albania, and inviting him \r\nto address the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Berisha (Albania): First, I would like to \r\nextend my heartfelt congratulations to the President of \r\nthe General Assembly on his election. I wish him every \r\nsuccess in leading the work of the Assembly at its \r\nsixty-sixth session. I would like to express my \r\ngratitude to his predecessor for his invaluable \r\ncontribution. May I also take this opportunity to extend \r\nspecial thanks to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for \r\nhis excellent organization of this session and for his \r\nwise and determined leadership at the helm of the \r\n A/66/PV.22\r\n \r\n29 11-51360 \r\n \r\nUnited Nations over the past few years. I wish him the \r\nutmost success over the four years ahead. \r\n Our world today is experiencing major and \r\ncomplex crises that threaten the peace and stability of \r\nseveral regions and our planet as a whole. However, \r\nthis year’s spring was a great and historic one for \r\nAfrica and the entire world. More than 125 million \r\noppressed people stood up with courage, determination \r\nand sacrifice and overthrew tyrannical regimes in five \r\ncountries in Africa and opened the gates of freedom for \r\ntheir nations. \r\n As a representative of a country that only 20 \r\nyears ago brought down the Hoxhaist dictatorship — \r\nthe worst that Albania and Europe had ever known — I \r\nwould like to cordially welcome and salute the \r\nrepresentatives of Egypt, Tunisia, Libya, South Sudan \r\nand Ivory Coast who are present at this Assembly \r\nsession. Today, we pay tribute to the thousands of \r\ncitizens of those countries who with great courage and \r\nlegendary bravery lost their lives in order to liberate \r\ntheir countries from ruthless tyrannies and who made \r\ntheir countries, the African continent and the entire \r\nworld more free and more just than ever. With their \r\nsacrifices, however, those who fought and fell in the \r\nname of freedom have delivered a sacred message to \r\nthe very hearts and minds of all oppressed people on \r\nour planet: Be not afraid! \r\n On the twentieth anniversary of the fall of the \r\ncommunist dictatorship, despite the unquestionable \r\ndifficulties inherent in building a democracy based on \r\nmarket values, Albania has continuously affirmed that \r\nfor the individual, our society and our nation as a \r\nwhole freedom is the greatest of all assets and riches. \r\n Twenty years ago, Albania was one of the three \r\npoorest countries in the world, plagued by extreme \r\npoverty and chronic starvation. Today, Albania belongs \r\nto the group of countries with middle to upper income \r\nlevels. Formerly a totally hyper-collectivized country, \r\ntoday it has the smallest public sector in Europe, with \r\nmore than 84 per cent of its gross domestic product \r\n(GDP) coming from the private sector. \r\n Twenty years ago, human rights and freedoms \r\nwere forbidden under the country’s Constitution. \r\nToday, Albania is a country with a functional \r\ndemocracy, freedom of speech and free elections and in \r\nwhich there is full respect for minority rights and \r\nreligious tolerance par excellence. \r\n Albania was the most isolated country in the \r\nworld. Now, it is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty \r\nalliance and makes its contribution to peace and \r\nstability in the region and beyond, while remaining \r\nfirmly focused on its path towards European Union \r\nintegration. Today, Albanians travel freely throughout \r\nEurope, while the number of foreign citizens who have \r\nvisited Albania for tourism and other purposes has \r\nincreased, from 300,000 in 2004 to 3.5 million last \r\nyear. \r\n Recently, during this period of major European \r\nand global financial crises, Albania’s economy \r\nremained one of the few in the world that did not \r\nexperience a recession. The United Nations Conference \r\non Trade and Development estimates that global \r\nforeign direct investment decreased by 37 per cent \r\nfrom 2007 to 2010, while the same source confirms \r\nthat in Albania it grew by 316 per cent from 2006 to \r\n2010. \r\n Mr. Fassi Fihri (Morocco), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair. \r\n Over the past few years, Albanian exports have \r\ngrown by 300 per cent. Unemployment has decreased, \r\nand so has poverty, by a margin of some 30 per cent. \r\nOur economic model is based entirely on economic \r\nfreedom. Last year, that freedom suffered a major \r\nsetback worldwide, whereas in my country it increased \r\nby 16 per cent. \r\n The Albanian economy is not detached from the \r\nglobal economy. In fact, the opposite is true: being a \r\nsmall economy, it is linked to and affected by it. That is \r\nwhy I believe that four main factors determine its \r\nperformance. \r\n The first factor is a small government and public \r\nsector. Albania’s public administration and public \r\nsector are at least 50 per cent smaller than those of any \r\nother similarly sized country in the region and beyond. \r\nFurthermore, I am pleased to state that my Government \r\nranks among the top 10 Governments with the lowest \r\nlevel of interference in the economy. \r\n Secondly, Albania is a country of flat-rate taxes. \r\nAt 10 per cent, its fiscal burden is the lowest in \r\nEurope. The increase in fiscal freedoms and the \r\nsuccessful fight against corruption allowed our country \r\nto double its budgetary revenue from customs and \r\ntaxes in four years’ time. \r\nA/66/PV.22  \r\n \r\n11-51360 30 \r\n \r\n Thirdly, we invested heavily in infrastructure to \r\nstimulate growth. My Government has spent 8 per cent \r\nto 10 per cent of our GDP on road infrastructure alone, \r\nthree years in a row. A total of 8,000 km of new roads \r\nhave been constructed, more than in the entire history \r\nof the country. Within the next two years, Albania will \r\nhave a new and modern road infrastructure that will \r\nallow our citizens as well as foreign visitors to reach \r\nour capital, Tirana, from any part of the country in \r\n60 per cent less time than previously required. \r\n Fourthly, we have made it easier to open a \r\nbusiness or expand an existing one by putting in place \r\nan efficient digital one-stop-shopping system for \r\nbusiness registrations, licences and permits, and by \r\ndrastically reducing bureaucratic procedures. \r\n Yet the debt and the euro crisis are hanging like \r\nthe sword of Damocles over our national currency, the \r\nlek, and our economy. I take this opportunity to call \r\nupon the countries of the eurozone to take into \r\nconsideration the effects of the crisis on our economy \r\nand others that are closely linked to the euro. \r\n The greatest desire and fondest dream of all \r\nAlbanians is to see Albania become a developed \r\ncountry. I know that the road ahead of us is not \r\nsmooth; it may be bumpy at times, but it is also the one \r\nthat will take us higher and higher. I am convinced that \r\nit is a righteous and a sure path of hope by which the \r\ndream of a fully developed Albania will come true. \r\n To achieve that dream, the Government of \r\nAlbania is committed to sustainable development. \r\nDeveloping countries and emerging markets such as \r\nthat of Albania face countless difficulties, but they also \r\nhave the advantage of learning from the mistakes of \r\ndeveloped countries and being able to avoid them. \r\nWith that in mind, we are determined to turn Albania \r\ninto a small superpower of renewable energy in the \r\nregion. With its rich water resources, Albania \r\nresembles a small Norway on the Balkan peninsula. \r\nMy Government has already signed with the private \r\nsector a concessional contract for the construction of \r\n220 of the 450 hydropower stations that are to be built. \r\nCompanies from all over Europe and the rest of the \r\nworld are already engaged in that process. \r\n Additionally, major natural wind platforms exist \r\nthroughout the country, and the Government has given \r\nand is giving licenses for the production of thousands \r\nof megawatts of electricity by wind parks. Albania is \r\nalso one of the sunniest places in Europe, and the \r\nGovernment is determined to exploit solar as well as \r\ngeothermal energy. \r\n I believe that in addition to the major efforts \r\nnecessary to achieve an international legal framework \r\nto prevent global warming and lower greenhouse-gas \r\nemissions, we must speedily reach an agreement \r\nstipulating that a percentage of the aid that generous \r\ndonors are offering to support this cause be used for \r\nthe purpose of supporting private-sector companies \r\nthat are focused on renewable energy projects. Such \r\nfunds could be used to cover the cost of the loan \r\ninterest incurred in realizing renewable energy \r\nprojects. I am sure that they will increase manifold the \r\nproduction of renewable energy in the very near future. \r\n To combat climate change and improve \r\nenvironmental conditions, forestation is also very \r\nimportant. The United Nations Billion Tree Campaign \r\nhas been met with a successful response by many \r\ncountries and deserves credit as a first important step. \r\nHowever, our potential is much greater. \r\n The Government of Albania has started an \r\nambitious programme aimed at taking advantage of our \r\ncountry’s potential in terms of fruit trees. We intend to \r\nplant, in the next eight years, some 50 million olive \r\ntrees and around 200 million nut trees of different \r\nvarieties. The project, which started two years ago, is \r\nsubsidized by public funds. I am pleased to inform the \r\nAssembly that this project is moving rapidly ahead and \r\nthat it has given rise to a real and unprecedented tree-\r\nplanting passion on the part of my fellow citizens. \r\nAlbania will welcome any and all help from the United \r\nNations and its Member States to successfully \r\ncomplete this project. \r\n Albania fully supports the Open Government \r\nPartnership initiated by the President of the United \r\nStates, Barack Obama, and the President of Brazil, \r\nDilma Rousseff; that is why we have joined the \r\ninitiative. Our efforts towards an open Government \r\nhave as a primary objective the project entitled \r\n“Albania in the digital age”. In a short time, we have \r\nexpanded access to the Internet to all our schools and \r\nhave started offering free Internet service to every \r\ncitizen in all post offices throughout the country. \r\n A total of 2.1 million Albanians have availed \r\nthemselves of this opportunity and have surfed the \r\nInternet, many of them for the first time in their lives. \r\nThis has helped increase the percentage of the \r\npopulation in Albania using the Internet from a mere \r\n A/66/PV.22\r\n \r\n31 11-51360 \r\n \r\n4.8 per cent in early 2006 to 60 per cent today — \r\nroughly two thirds of the population. Free Internet \r\nservice will continue to be available in all post offices \r\nand in some additional offices to be opened for that \r\npurpose. Moreover, the Government is fully committed \r\nto making super-broadband Internet available over the \r\nnext two years and to guaranteeing one-stop-shopping \r\nservices to citizens throughout the country. \r\n We believe that the digital age is above all the \r\nage of transparency. Based on this belief, Albania two \r\nyears ago became the first country in the world with a \r\n100 per cent electronic procurement system certified \r\nby the United Nations. That system has led to a sixfold \r\nincrease in participating public bids, reducing \r\nprocurement costs by 27 per cent. Today Albania is a \r\ncountry featuring e-tax, e-customs, e-university \r\nadmissions, and e-business registration and e-civil \r\nstatus registry. The Government intends to offer all \r\nthose services and others in a one-stop-shop context in \r\nthe very near future. \r\n E-government and transparency strengthen \r\ndemocracy, and our law also guarantees free access for \r\nour citizens to all acts, decisions and public \r\nexpenditures of the Government. In order to strengthen \r\nthe role of civil society, my Government has for the \r\npast two years had a specific budgetary provision in \r\nthat respect that is entirely administered by an \r\nindependent board of civil society. \r\n Albania has excellent relations with its immediate \r\nneighbours and, in general, with the countries of the \r\nregion. We would like to develop and consolidate \r\nfurther relations with the Republic of Serbia as well. I \r\nam very pleased to inform the Assembly that the \r\nGovernment of Kosovo possesses an equally strong \r\nwill in the area of good-neighbourly relations and has \r\nshown assiduous commitment and seriousness in the \r\nprocess of negotiations in Brussels. The International \r\nCourt of Justice decided in July last year in The Hague \r\nthat Kosovo’s declaration of independence was in full \r\ncompliance with international law.  \r\n The Republic of Kosovo has been recognized by \r\nmore than 80 States, and I take this opportunity to call \r\nupon the rest of the States Members of the United \r\nNations to recognize the independent republic of \r\nKosovo, which has become, in fact, an important factor \r\nfor peace, stability and cooperation in our region. I also \r\ncall upon Serbia, which went through the General \r\nAssembly to ask the opinion of the International Court \r\nof Justice, to adapt its position in line with the decision \r\nof the Court, thus demonstrating that it accepts and \r\nrespects international law in its entirety and not only \r\nthose parts that serve its cause. \r\n In accordance with President Ahtisaari’s package, \r\nand in close cooperation with the European Union Rule \r\nof Law Mission in Kosovo (EULEX), the International \r\nSecurity Force in Kosovo (KFOR) and other \r\ninternational institutions present in the country, the \r\nrepublic of Kosovo has put in place and implemented \r\nthe highest standards in the region and beyond as \r\nregards the freedoms and rights of minorities. \r\n The most worrying problems for the Serbs in \r\nKosovo today are the tensions created and orchestrated \r\nfor nationalistic purposes. Serbian cultural heritage in \r\nKosovo is today more secure than ever. It is a precious \r\ncultural heritage not only for the Serbs in Kosovo but \r\nalso for Albanians and all other citizens of Kosovo, as \r\nwell as for Serbia, the entire region and the whole of \r\nEurope. I would like to reassure the representatives of \r\nthe Member States that the only threat Serbs in Kosovo \r\nface is that of being exploited to serve the purposes of \r\na bitter past that must not ever return. \r\n Meanwhile, inter-ethnic relations in all areas \r\nwhere Serbs and Albanians live together in the same \r\ncommunities are very good. However, the parallel \r\nstructures funded by Belgrade in the three Serbian \r\nhomogeneous communes in northern Mitrovica, where \r\nno other ethnic groups reside, have turned them into a \r\nsafe haven for organized crime and smuggling and \r\ntrafficking of all sorts.  \r\n The Government of the republic of Kosovo is \r\ndetermined to implement the rule of law in those \r\ncommunes and engage in effective border and customs \r\ncontrol, in full compliance with the agreement reached \r\nin Brussels and the Ahtisaari document. Those efforts, \r\nhowever, have met strong resistance from criminal \r\ngroups and organized gangs that, with weapons and \r\nother means, are doing all in their power to block the \r\nrule of law. We have supported and will continue to \r\nsupport the Government of Kosovo, EULEX and \r\nKFOR in their efforts to strengthen law and order in all \r\nthe territory of the republic of Kosovo so that peace \r\nand stability will prevail.  \r\n I also call on Serbia to do its best to remove the \r\nobstacles to the flow of goods across its border with \r\nKosovo, and to respect the agreement signed this \r\nmonth in Brussels, which forbids the embargo and \r\nA/66/PV.22  \r\n \r\n11-51360 32 \r\n \r\nprovides for freedom of export and import for both \r\ncountries. We believe that respect for the actual borders \r\nin the Balkans is a fundamental condition for lasting \r\npeace and stability. Belgrade’s efforts to keep parallel \r\nstructures of authority in place in those three \r\ncommunes demonstrate that it still believes in \r\nreshaping borders in our region based on the failed and \r\nlong-outdated idea of ethnically clean countries and the \r\nconcept of Greater Serbia. \r\n The Republic of Serbia, in accordance with \r\ninternational law, has arrested the butcher of the \r\nBalkans and, albeit too late, his lieutenants as well, and \r\nhas received the due appreciation of the international \r\ncommunity for doing so. However, I invite Serbia to \r\ncooperate in the search for and return of the remains of \r\n1,500 men, women, children and elderly who were \r\nabducted from their homes and massacred in the \r\nterritory of Serbia only because they were Albanians. It \r\nis very important to cleanse one’s country of those who \r\nhave committed crimes against humanity, but it is also \r\nimportant not to hide or cover over the graves of their \r\nvictims.  \r\n Here yesterday, President Tadić characterized as \r\ntrue the accusations raised by Mr. Dick Marty \r\nregarding the alleged traffic in organs and mass \r\nkillings committed by Albanians in the territory of \r\nAlbania. Regarding that report, I would like to state \r\nhere the stance of the Albanian Government. Dick \r\nMarty’s report — as acknowledged by the Chief \r\nProsecutor of Serbia, Vladimir Vukčević, who has \r\nstated that his own report is fully included in Marty’s \r\nreport — is in fact a cut-and-paste of the Vukčević’s \r\nreport. Every person who reads that report sees that it \r\nraises many allegations that are not at all based on \r\nfacts or the truth but rather motivated by sinister \r\nintention.  \r\n The Dick Marty report — or rather let us call it \r\nthe Dick Marty/Vukčević report — does not produce \r\neven a single fact. I must clarify that in fact it \r\nsynthesizes Carla Del Ponte’s memoir, which seem to \r\nhave derived from the same unique source. In the \r\nthousands of pages of transcripts of the interrogation of \r\nSlobodan Milošević and his accusations against \r\nAlbanians, there is not a single word of accusation on \r\nhis part about organ trafficking or mass graves in my \r\ncountry. The purpose of the report is to divert attention \r\nfrom the decision of the International Court of Justice \r\nin favour of the independence of Kosovo. \r\n Nevertheless, the Government of Albania has \r\nofficially asked its delegation in the Council of Europe \r\nto vote to endorse the report for the sole purpose of \r\nopening the door to a thorough international \r\ninvestigation. My Government sent an invitation to \r\nEULEX, and we welcome the fact the EULEX \r\naccepted it. I assure everyone here that my country will \r\nfully cooperate fully with EULEX and its task force so \r\nthat the truth about such inventions will be made \r\nknown. When I read them for the first time in Carla \r\nDel Ponte’s memoir, they reminded me of Agatha \r\nChristie. I want the EULEX team to come and clarify \r\neverything about those fictions. \r\n Despite all this, our region has made \r\nextraordinary progress, and efforts to cooperate in \r\nbuilding a common future in the European Union are \r\nprevailing every day. My country is doing its best and \r\nis investing heavily in infrastructure to create new \r\nlinks, new roads and new lines of communication with \r\nall our neighbours. I believe that the time has come \r\nwhen Albanians and Serbs will try to start archiving the \r\npast and looking for a common future in the best \r\ninterests of their nations.  \r\n From this rostrum, President Abbas made his \r\nrequest to the General Assembly for Palestine’s \r\nmembership of the United Nations as an independent \r\nState. While my Government fully supports the idea of \r\nan independent Palestine, I believe that unilateral \r\naction will not be helpful. That is why I call on our \r\nPalestinian friends to support the statement made \r\nyesterday by the Quartet, in which it drew a clear road \r\nmap for action to address this fundamental question of \r\nour time. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Albania for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Sali Berisha, Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof Albania, was escorted from the rostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Nikola Gruevski, Prime \r\nMinister of the former Yugoslav Republic \r\nof Macedonia \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of the former Yugoslav Republic of \r\nMacedonia. \r\n A/66/PV.22\r\n \r\n33 11-51360 \r\n \r\n Mr. Nikola Gruevski, Prime Minister of the \r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Nikola \r\nGruevski, Prime Minister of the former Yugoslav \r\nRepublic of Macedonia, and inviting him to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n Mr. Gruevski (former Yugoslav Republic of \r\nMacedonia) (spoke in Macedonian; English text \r\nprovided by the delegation): It is my special honour \r\nand privilege to address this important forum and to \r\nshare with the Assembly the positions of the Republic \r\nof Macedonia regarding current issues on the United \r\nNations agenda. \r\n First, allow me to congratulate His Excellency \r\nAmbassador Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on his \r\nelection to the prestigious position of President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-sixth session, and to \r\ncongratulate the previous President, Mr. Joseph Deiss, \r\non his remarkably successful presidency at the sixty-\r\nfifth session. I also take this opportunity to \r\ncongratulate Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on his \r\nreappointment, confident that he will continue to work \r\ndevotedly to realize the noble objectives of the United \r\nNations. \r\n The Republic of Macedonia recently celebrated \r\nthe twentieth anniversary of its independence. We have \r\nfaced many challenges and temptations, including \r\nachieving a peaceful declaration of independence, the \r\nintroduction of a new political system with due respect \r\nfor democratic values and human rights and freedoms, \r\ntransforming our economic system and then dealing \r\nwith many social problems, establishing ourselves as a \r\nresponsible and active member of the international \r\ncommunity, and shouldering the additional burden of \r\nvarious requirements and conditions. \r\n Throughout this time, the Republic of Macedonia \r\nhas had the United Nations as a partner. Based on \r\nlessons learned over the past 20 years, my country is \r\nparticularly conscious of the value of mediation in the \r\npeaceful settlement of conflicts. Macedonia welcomes \r\nthe timely and wise decision to make the role of \r\nmediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful \r\nmeans the focus of this year’s debate.  \r\n The majority of conflicts do not happen \r\novernight; they are predictable and offer realistic \r\nopportunities for effective diplomatic efforts to prevent \r\nthem. Such cases offer the chance of incurring the \r\nlowest cost in every way. While we affirm the \r\nsovereignty of States, we must take into consideration \r\nthat there are moments when a State or States need \r\nmediation services, with impartiality and willingness \r\non the part of the mediators to understand the thrust of \r\nthe issues and to help all parties concerned resolve \r\ntheir problems in a mutually acceptable and \r\nsatisfactory manner before they can escalate in an \r\nunwanted direction. \r\n The Millennium Development Goals remain the \r\nparameters we need to evaluate our success. Regardless \r\nof the serious consequences of the global economic \r\ncrisis, our commitment to achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals must not weaken. The greatest \r\ncrises occur as a result of a lack of vision and \r\ndedication. Turning a blind eye to problems or finding \r\nexcuses to justify a lack of action to achieve our goals \r\nwill only increase the price to be paid in future; and \r\nthat will not be calculated merely in dollars or euros, \r\nbut also in the most valuable and priceless asset: \r\nhuman lives. \r\n One challenge that requires an immediate and \r\nlong-term solution is the issue of climate change. It is \r\nalarming that, precisely as a result of climate change \r\ncaused by human activity, entire nations and States \r\nface uncertainty on a daily basis. Although the \r\nRepublic of Macedonia has experienced the adverse \r\neffects of climate change in a less dramatic way, it \r\nwishes to express its solidarity with the countries that \r\nare most exposed to the phenomenon. \r\n In recent times, we have witnessed numerous \r\nconflicts and the disturbance of peace and security in \r\nvarious regions of the world. The democratic \r\nawakening, especially the so-called Arab Spring, has \r\nshown us once more that democracy cannot be \r\nimposed; it can be derived only from the people’s \r\nrejection of dictatorships and regimes that are in \r\nconflict with the popular interest, and from respect for \r\nbasic human rights, universal freedoms and the rule of \r\nlaw.  \r\n Old and frozen conflicts remain a global \r\nchallenge. The problem of the abuse of programmes \r\nintended for the peaceful use of nuclear energy has not \r\nyet been solved. Terrorism and extreme hunger caused \r\nby conflicts are only two of the numerous challenges to \r\nwhich it is imperative that we find immediate solutions \r\nA/66/PV.22  \r\n \r\n11-51360 34 \r\n \r\naimed at improving security at the global and regional \r\nlevels. \r\n Human beings must be the focus of our attention, \r\nespecially in national policy and, of course, in \r\nmultilateral actions. There is no greater value than \r\nhuman life, human dignity and the right to individual \r\ndevelopment, prosperity and happiness. Humankind \r\nrequires action that transforms our declarations and \r\ngood intentions into deeds. When we ask for that moral \r\nimperative from the United Nations, we are practicing \r\nwhat we preach. The Republic of Macedonia will \r\ncontinue to be an active participant in the realization of \r\nour common objectives. \r\n There are many words I could use to describe my \r\ncountry, and each and every one would fit perfectly in \r\nits own manner. But to begin with, I choose only one, \r\nand I am convinced that it describes the essence of my \r\ncountry and my people and accurately illustrates all the \r\nefforts and strength we have summoned in order to \r\novercome the challenges of our recent history. It \r\nclearly describes the patience with which we have \r\nfaced every obstacle imposed on us, and which we \r\nhave overcome and continue to overcome, at the \r\neconomic and institutional level, simply by asserting \r\nour own identity and self-recognition. These obstacles \r\nhave been imposed not because of anything we have \r\ndone, but simply because of who we are and the fact \r\nthat we exist. That word is “responsibility”. \r\n Macedonia has acted responsibly. Our country’s \r\nindependence was won through a history that cannot be \r\ncalled merciful. It rests on the great sacrifice of many \r\nlives and broken dreams. Yet our past is not the only \r\nreason why we act responsibly. We Macedonians \r\nbelieve that we have a European future and that we can \r\nleave a great legacy for generations to come. That is \r\nprecisely why today we in Macedonia are trying to \r\ncreate a broad base of support and to unify all of our \r\nstrength and potential around the bold idea of \r\nMacedonia as a regional leader in economic reform, \r\neducation, investment, technology and innovation; in \r\nprotection of the environment and of human rights and \r\nfreedoms; and in all areas of modern life. Knowing the \r\ngreat awareness and responsibility of my people — and \r\nciting the example of country’s response to the global \r\neconomic crisis, when our solidarity was not shaken \r\nand we came through it all without major problems — \r\nI am convinced that our unity will succeed. \r\n When speaking of Macedonia, however, we \r\ncannot fail to mention another great characteristic that \r\nhas remained with us over thousands of years. As our \r\ninheritance from ancient times, this characteristic has \r\nhelped us to retain our cosmopolitanism — the ideal \r\nthat has enabled us to maintain a functional \r\nmulticulturalism. Side by side, throughout the \r\ncenturies, different cultures, religions and nations have \r\ncoexisted in my country. While many Europeans deem \r\nthat astonishing and unique, for us Macedonians that \r\nhas been the situation for centuries. We aim for \r\nincorporation into the dominant culture, without any \r\nassimilation or disintegration. Unlike many others \r\nwho, afraid for their own national myth, try to suppress \r\ndifferences, we are proud of them and consider them \r\nour treasure. \r\n Our system is not perfect, and we have many \r\nissues to resolve. Macedonia is on the verge of a great \r\ntransformation, which will not happen overnight. We, \r\nlike every other nation in the world, have the right to \r\nan identity and to unite around our own national myth. \r\nIn our myth, there is a place for Macedonians, \r\nAlbanians, Turks, Roma, Serbs, Vlachs, Bosniaks and \r\nothers. There is a place for all who accept the virtues of \r\nnon-violence, justice, coexistence and cultural \r\ncompetitiveness. Chauvinism has never been dominant \r\namong our people. The constitutional amendments of \r\n1993 and the change in our flag showed our goodwill, \r\nopenness and cooperativeness. However, our sense of \r\nresponsibility and our maturity should not be \r\nconsidered as weaknesses, nor should they be a reason \r\nfor continuous abuse from anyone, because we have \r\ndignity and pride. We know who we are and how we \r\nwill live. We are Macedonians, we speak Macedonian, \r\nand our country’s name is the Republic of Macedonia. \r\n As Prime Minister of the Republic of Macedonia, \r\nI would be remiss if I were to neglect the issue of our \r\nname and identity and our southern neighbour’s \r\nobjection to both. I mention this not only because of \r\nmy position and obligation to the people of the \r\nRepublic of Macedonia, but also because it relates in \r\nmany ways directly to the issue of the peaceful \r\nresolution of conflict and the role that mediation plays.  \r\n We do not like being in the position of having our \r\nname and identity opposed by one country, and we \r\ncertainly did not ask for it. But reality is often cold, \r\nhard and brutal. The fact is that our southern neighbour \r\nobjects to both our name and identity; its objection has \r\nbecome our problem, and a dispute has arisen that is \r\n A/66/PV.22\r\n \r\n35 11-51360 \r\n \r\nunique in the world. It is imposed on the basis of the \r\nneed of one country, our neighbour, to monopolize two \r\nnames, and its strategic determination that we should \r\nnot exist as we feel ourselves to be.  \r\n Imagine the state that my citizens find themselves \r\nin — blackmailed, with their development and \r\nprospects jeopardized, blocked by our southern \r\nneighbour from joining euro-Atlantic institutions, just \r\nbecause of what we are and what we feel like. I \r\npersonally, and literally all of the citizens of my \r\ncountry, cannot believe that we have been put in a \r\nsituation where we have to resolve a dispute that was \r\nartificially created and absurd. I believe that it is also \r\nutterly incomprehensible to all present. I would ask \r\nparticipants in this meeting to imagine, just for a \r\nmoment, that they are in our shoes, to consider how \r\nthey would feel if someone demanded they not be \r\nFrench, German, British, American, Russian, Chinese, \r\nNigerian, Japanese, Argentine, Uruguayan or Kenyan, \r\nfor instance. That is the only thing I ask, the only thing \r\nI plead for. I ask for support to end this, to allow us to \r\nbe what we are. We hurt no one and inflict damage on \r\nno one. We have understanding, tolerance and respect \r\nfor our neighbours and friends and for everyone. We \r\nhave respect for the neighbour with which we are \r\nhaving this dispute and an understanding of its fears. \r\nWe have no pretensions, nor do we have any intention \r\nof monopolizing the name Macedonia. \r\n Please help us to be proud and dignified and to \r\navoid a solution that would break us. We seek a \r\nsolution that will not harm our spirit and a name that \r\nwill recognize our commitment, desire and \r\ndetermination for coexistence, community, \r\nindividuality and identity as well as our sense of \r\nbelonging to the world — this world that we are \r\nbuilding, whose virtues we are establishing and whose \r\nfuture we are fighting for. Macedonians are a peaceful \r\npeople and are working, with mediation, to resolve the \r\ndispute with our neighbour in a peaceful manner. \r\n In a speech to the Parliament of the Republic of \r\nMacedonia on 31 August 2001, our late President, \r\nBoris Trajkovski, said: \r\n  “We demand that the international \r\ncommunity recognize us by our name — the \r\nRepublic of Macedonia — and not by a fictional \r\nderivative. It is high time that the world \r\nrecognizes us by what we call ourselves, just like \r\nany other country and its citizens. Otherwise, \r\nhow do you expect us to believe in your values, \r\nprinciples and intentions if you deny our basic \r\nright, the right to identity?” \r\n Fortunately, 131 countries around the world have \r\nmade a choice to recognize us by what we call \r\nourselves — the Republic of Macedonia — and for that \r\nwe thank them. We thank them for their principled \r\nposition and consistency in the values of protection of \r\nthe rights and principles established by the United \r\nNations itself. Unfortunately, the rules of the world are \r\nsuch that we cannot be called by what we call \r\nourselves in this very body. Nor can we join \r\norganizations we have worked hard to become \r\nmembers of, and, in the case of NATO and the \r\nEuropean Union, have earned a right to be a part of. \r\nThis, frankly, is wrong. There is no other word for it. \r\nWhat others choose to do about it — their behaviour — \r\nis entirely up to them. \r\n It is a great honour and great privilege to address \r\nthis body. All of us are leaders of our people and all of \r\nus represent them to the best of our abilities. But we \r\nmust recommit ourselves as leaders to our own peoples \r\nfirst, and to the peoples of this world second. If we do \r\nthat, we can survive, we can succeed and we can build \r\na better world for ourselves, our children, our \r\ngrandchildren and for future generations, which, \r\nultimately is what each and every one of us wants. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPrime Minister of the former Yugoslav Republic of \r\nMacedonia for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Nikola Gruevski, Prime Minister of the \r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum.  \r\n  \r\n  Address by Mr. Winston Baldwin Spencer, \r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof Antigua and Barbuda \r\n  \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Antigua \r\nand Barbuda. \r\n  Mr. Winston Baldwin Spencer, Prime Minister and \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Antigua and \r\nBarbuda, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n  The Acting President (spoke in French): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency \r\nA/66/PV.22  \r\n \r\n11-51360 36 \r\n \r\nMr. Winston Baldwin Spencer, Prime Minister and \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Antigua and Barbuda, \r\nand inviting him to address the Assembly.  \r\n  Mr. Spencer (Antigua and Barbuda): Let me at \r\nthe outset commend Mr. Al-Nasser on his unanimous \r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-sixth session. I hereby pledge to him my \r\ndelegation’s full support for his efforts to successfully \r\nmove forward the agenda of this session. I wish also to \r\ncommend his predecessor, Mr. Joseph Deiss, President \r\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session, for \r\nhis stewardship. \r\n I would be somewhat remiss if I did not \r\ncommend Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his \r\nleadership of our treasured Organization. I am pleased \r\nto lend my voice to those of other Heads of State and \r\nGovernment who have commended him on his \r\nreappointment for a second five-year term beginning \r\n1 January 2012 and to wish him every success in his \r\nbold quest to develop an Organization that is both \r\neffective and efficient and can bring about meaningful \r\nchange in the complex world in which we live. \r\n Mr. Al-Nasser’s choice of the theme for the \r\ngeneral debate, namely, “The role of mediation in the \r\nsettlement of disputes by peaceful means”, could not \r\nhave been more timely or appropriate.  Mediation is \r\none of the cornerstones of the Organization. While it is \r\ntrue that mediation should not be the only tool \r\navailable to the international community to mitigate \r\nconflicts, there is nevertheless a growing interest in \r\nmediation and its use as a promising and cost-effective \r\ntool in the peaceful settlement of disputes, conflict \r\nprevention and resolution. \r\n In addition, we, as a community of nations, have \r\non many occasions recognized the useful role that \r\nmediation can play in preventing disputes from \r\nescalating into conflicts and conflicts from escalating \r\nfurther, as well as in advancing the resolution of \r\nconflicts and thus preventing and reducing human \r\nsuffering and creating conditions conducive to lasting \r\npeace and sustainable development, and in this regard, \r\nrecognizing that peace and development are mutually \r\nreinforcing. \r\n In the general debate of the sixty-fifth session, I \r\nas well as others called for lasting peace in the Middle \r\nEast (see A/65/PV.20). I also issued a call for \r\nimplementation of the two-State solution, which would \r\nhave Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace \r\nand security. Neither of these notions is new; sadly, \r\nneither is anywhere close to realization, Given the \r\ncurrent state of affairs, it should come as no surprise to \r\nanyone that the Palestinian people would seek a \r\ndifferent option — full membership in our \r\nOrganization or, failing that, a vote by the General \r\nAssembly that would elevate the status of Palestine \r\nfrom non-voting observer entity to Observer State, a \r\nstatus equal to that of the Holy See. \r\n As we have said in previous debates, we remain \r\nfully supportive of the aspirations of the Palestinian \r\npeople and of the idea of a two-State solution, which \r\nwould allow the Palestinian people the right to govern \r\nthemselves and reach their potential in a sovereign and \r\ncontiguous State. It was against this backdrop that we \r\ndecided to join with others that have already done so \r\nand grant recognition to the State of Palestine. As we \r\ndid then and do now, we believe that recognition of the \r\nState of Palestine will contribute to the quest for a \r\nnegotiated solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict \r\nand to the creation of lasting peace and stability in the \r\nregion, and ultimately result in a viable Palestine and a \r\nsecure Israel, based on the 1967 lines, with mutually \r\nagreed swaps to ensure that secure, recognized borders \r\nexist for both sides. \r\n Many of today’s conflicts are fuelled by the \r\nillegal trade in small arms and light weapons. Those \r\nsmall weapons of mass destruction have had a \r\ndevastating impact on the countries of our region over \r\nthe past decade, and have been directly implicated in \r\nthe associated rise in crime and violence involving the \r\nuse of firearms. Needless to say, those weapons have \r\nhad a significant adverse impact on security and socio-\r\neconomic and human development in our countries. \r\n In their 2007 annual reports, both the United \r\nNations Office on Drugs and Crime and the World \r\nBank identified our region as having higher murder \r\nrates than any other region in the world. They also \r\nstated that small arms and light weapons were used in \r\nmore than 70 per cent of those murders. We never \r\nsought that dubious designation, which was anything \r\nbut welcome. \r\n This is why, at our most recent summit in July \r\n2011, my fellow Heads of State of the Caribbean \r\nCommunity adopted a Declaration on Small Arms and \r\nLight Weapons in which, inter alia, we agreed  \r\n “to accord the highest national and regional \r\npriority to matters related to combating and \r\n A/66/PV.22\r\n \r\n37 11-51360 \r\n \r\neradicating the illicit trade in small arms and light \r\nweapons and their ammunition” [and] “to \r\nintensify and sustain engagement in the United \r\nNations effort for the conclusion of a legally \r\nbinding Arms Trade Treaty”. \r\nI call on all States Members of our Organization to join \r\nour region in this worthy endeavour.  \r\n The very existence of many developing countries \r\nas viable States is at stake. The world financial and \r\neconomic crisis continues to threaten debt \r\nsustainability in our countries through its impact on the \r\nreal economy and the increase in borrowing we had to \r\nundertake in order to mitigate the negative impacts of \r\nthe crisis. \r\n The recent gyrations in the major stock markets \r\nof the world do not inspire hope for lasting global \r\neconomic recovery any time soon. Now more than \r\never, if we are to overcome the current crisis we need a \r\nnew mechanism for restructuring and resolving \r\nsovereign debt that takes into account the multiple \r\ndimensions of debt sustainability.  \r\n This seemingly unending economic crisis has \r\naffected our countries not only in economic terms, but \r\nalso through the presence of barriers to trade, as well \r\nas the financing embedded in some of the anti-crisis \r\nmeasures adopted by some developed countries. More \r\nimportantly, the crisis has impacted our social \r\ndevelopment, which in turn has led and continues to \r\nlead to a major loss of jobs and difficulties in financing \r\nsocial programmes that address poverty or the \r\nprovision of basic amenities. All those factors threaten \r\nour efforts to attain the internationally agreed \r\ndevelopment goals, including the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. \r\n While my country has made good progress with \r\nthe United States on our online gaming dispute, we \r\nurge the United States to remain committed to reaching \r\na mutually agreed outcome that will bring value to our \r\neconomy and is implementable by the United States. \r\n With so much at stake, we will soldier on in our \r\nquest to seek market access openings in key sectors \r\nand other innovative incentives that could include but \r\nwould not be limited to financial and technical support, \r\nforensics, equipment and training for dealing with drug \r\ntrafficking and for the creation of decent jobs for the \r\npeople of Antigua and Barbuda. \r\n Mine is not the only country in the Caribbean that \r\nhas experienced trade-related difficulties with the \r\nUnited States. A far more pernicious economic, \r\ncommercial and financial blockade has been imposed \r\nby the United States of America on Cuba, and although \r\nthe overwhelming majority of membership of the \r\nUnited Nations has repeatedly called for that blockade \r\nto be lifted, it continues unabated. As a country \r\ncommitted to the norms of the multilateral trading \r\nsystem and the freedom of trade and navigation, and as \r\na nation that rejects the extraterritorial application of \r\nanother country’s national law, we call on the United \r\nStates to immediately and unconditionally lift its \r\neconomic blockade against the people of Cuba. \r\n On 19 September, almost 11 years to the day \r\nsince the World Health Assembly endorsed the \r\nlandmark Global Strategy for the Prevention and \r\nControl of Non-communicable Diseases to reduce the \r\ntoll of premature deaths due to non-communicable \r\ndiseases (NCDs), the General Assembly adopted a \r\nPolitical Declaration (resolution 66/2) that, among \r\nother things, calls for the launch of a global NCD \r\ncampaign. \r\n While there is much to be lauded in the \r\nDeclaration, we are nevertheless disappointed that \r\nsome of our original expectations, including a clear \r\ngoal for the launching of the global NCD campaign \r\nwith a corresponding road map, may not have been \r\nfully developed. However, we believe that, if \r\nrigorously implemented, the Declaration will \r\ncontribute to the attainment of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. Let it be known that we will do \r\nour utmost to ensure that the momentum generated at \r\nthat meeting is not lost. \r\n Two days ago, we held a one day High-level \r\nMeeting to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the \r\nadoption of the Durban Declaration and Programme of \r\nAction — the internationally recognized blueprint for \r\naction to fight racism that was adopted by consensus at \r\nthe 2001 World Conference against Racism, Racial \r\nDiscrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, \r\nheld in Durban, South Africa. To this day, the \r\nDeclaration remains an innovative and action-oriented \r\nagenda to combat all forms of racism and racial \r\ndiscrimination. \r\n This tenth anniversary is a chance to strengthen \r\npolitical commitment to fighting racism and racial \r\ndiscrimination. It is also an opportune time to revisit \r\nA/66/PV.22  \r\n \r\n11-51360 38 \r\n \r\nthe issue of reparations for slavery, which is central to \r\nany discussion about racism, colonialism and poverty. \r\nAntigua and Barbuda has long argued that the legacy of \r\nslavery, segregation and racial violence against peoples \r\nof African descent has severely impaired our \r\nadvancement as nations, communities and individuals \r\nacross the economic, social and political spectrums. In \r\nobtaining redress for the injustices suffered by African \r\nslaves and their descendants, today’s Caribbean and \r\nAfrican peoples would advance immeasurably the \r\nprocess of genuine healing. \r\n Those who choose to differ have argued that, \r\nunlike victims of the Holocaust or those who have been \r\ninterned during wars and have subsequently received \r\nremunerations, neither the victims nor the perpetrators \r\nof slavery are alive today, and that it is unfair to hold \r\nthe descendants of slave-owners responsible for the \r\nactions of their ancestors. \r\n On this we strongly disagree. However, no one \r\nshould disagree that racism and other legacies of \r\nslavery continue to shape the lives of people of African \r\ndescent. Thus, reparations must be directed towards \r\nrepairing the damage inflicted by slavery and racism. \r\nThat is why we call on former slave States to begin the \r\nreconciliation process by issuing formal apologies for \r\nthe crimes committed by those nations or their citizens \r\nover the 400 years of the African slave trade. To help \r\ncounter the lingering damage inflicted on generations \r\nof peoples of African descent by generations of slave \r\ntrading and colonialism, we call on those very States to \r\nback up their apologies with new commitments to the \r\neconomic development of the nations that have \r\nsuffered from that human tragedy. \r\n The United Nations has declared 2011 to be the \r\nInternational Year for People of African Descent. \r\nThroughout the year, nations and communities of the \r\nAfrican diaspora have undertaken a number of \r\ninitiatives aimed at the realization of the full \r\nenjoyment of economic, cultural, social, civil and \r\npolitical rights; participation and integration in all \r\npolitical, economic, social and cultural aspects of \r\nsociety; the promotion of a greater knowledge of and \r\nrespect for their diverse heritage and culture, with \r\npronounced emphasis on encouraging multilateralism \r\nand development approaches; and the creation of a \r\nglobal Afro-centric movement. \r\n The time has come for peoples of the African \r\ndiaspora to begin helping themselves. A key part of \r\nthat process is the first African Diaspora Summit, to be \r\nheld in South Africa in mid-2012. The Summit and its \r\npreparatory process will provide a platform for the \r\nAfrican diaspora to put in place economic policies \r\naimed at ensuring sustained economic cooperation \r\namong public and private stakeholders, so as to \r\npromote development, entrepreneurship and business \r\nopportunities in diasporan regions. \r\n By 31 October, our planet will reach a milestone \r\nof sorts. Somewhere on the Earth’s surface, the planet’s \r\n7-billionth inhabitant will be born. Seven billion \r\npeople! If nothing else, that milestone will serve to \r\nreaffirm our determination as the international \r\ncommunity to implement sound development policies \r\nand promote the inherent right and dignity of each \r\nperson. Coming amid the preparations for the 2012 \r\nUnited Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment in Rio de Janeiro, a world of 7 billion \r\ninhabitants reminds us of the critical need to pay \r\nattention to population dynamics if we are to \r\nunderstand the needs of our people, proactively plan to \r\navoid development pitfalls, and develop forward-\r\nlooking policies that promote the health and dignity of \r\nevery human being on Earth, while at the same time \r\nsafeguarding the planet we call our home. \r\n By making the necessary investments to develop \r\nquality human capital, with equally strong measures to \r\npromote gender equality with the active promotion of \r\nwomen and youth participation in all spheres of life, \r\nwe will create the enabling conditions for transforming \r\nthe economies of developing countries in order to \r\neradicate poverty and achieve the internationally \r\nagreed Millennium Development Goals. Policies \r\nresponsive to the needs of our population not only \r\ncontribute to dynamic, growing economies but are a \r\nprerequisite for addressing the huge challenges related \r\nto access to food, energy, water and sanitation, climate \r\nchange, fast-paced urbanization and migration. It is not \r\nenough to merely respond to anticipated challenges; we \r\nmust take innovative and proactive approaches to seize \r\nthe opportunities presented by a world of 7 billion \r\npeople. \r\n As the countries of Latin American and \r\nCaribbean region reflect on and respond to those global \r\nchallenges, we have determined that our own destinies \r\nare interwoven and that, as developing countries, we \r\nmust unite and coordinate our efforts in a systematic, \r\nstructured and deliberative way. We have done just that \r\n A/66/PV.22\r\n \r\n39 11-51360 \r\n \r\nwith the creation of the Community of Latin American \r\nand Caribbean States. \r\nAntigua and Barbuda fully endorses and supports the \r\nobjectives and ideals of the Community and wishes to \r\nacknowledge the efforts of countries such as Mexico, \r\nVenezuela, Brazil, Cuba and our sister CARICOM \r\nmember States for bringing the organization into being. \r\n As we prepare for an important Summit in \r\nCaracas, Venezuela, in December, we intend to lay the \r\nfoundation of a dynamic, responsive and meaningful \r\ncommunity of nations that share a common history and \r\nthat have a great deal to gain in our coming together in \r\nthis way to reshape the agenda, thereby creating a \r\ngreater balance in the pursuit of happiness, prosperity, \r\npeace and democracy in our hemisphere. \r\n Within my own subregion, the eight small \r\ndeveloping countries that make up the Organization of \r\nEastern Caribbean States (OECS) have a common \r\ncurrency union, the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union \r\n(ECCU). We have been adversely affected by the \r\nglobal financial and economic crisis and we are faced \r\nwith a protracted recovery. The impact of the global \r\ncrisis was manifested in steep declines in our tourist \r\narrivals and expenditures, direct foreign investment \r\nand remittances. Our real gross domestic product \r\n(GDP) fell by 5.7 per cent in 2009 and is estimated to \r\nhave declined by a further 2.2 per cent in 2010, \r\ninfluenced by declines in value added in construction, \r\nmanufacturing, agriculture, wholesale and retail, \r\ntransport and financial intermediation. The crisis has \r\nalso had a marked impact on our fiscal positions, with \r\nan accompanying increase in public-sector debt. \r\n Despite those challenges, there is a positive side. \r\nOur countries have strong liberal democratic systems \r\nand the rule of law is upheld. We also have a stable \r\ncurrency that has been pegged to the United States \r\ndollar at a rate of 2.7 Eastern Caribbean dollars to \r\n$1 since 1976. That has been responsible for \r\ncomparatively low inflation and confidence in the \r\nmonetary system. In response to the global and \r\nregional economic and financial crises, ECCU \r\nmembers have crafted a very strong response to those \r\nchallenges. We have upgraded our current economic \r\nintegration arrangements to an economic union status \r\nand a new treaty to that effect, the revised Treaty of \r\nBasseterre establishing an OECS Economic Union, was \r\nratified in January 2011. \r\n We have put in place a number of institutional \r\narrangements, which have served us well in addressing \r\nthe effects of the crisis over the past two years. We \r\nadopted the ECCU Eight Point Stabilisation and \r\nGrowth Programme in 2009, aimed at stabilizing and \r\ntransforming the ECCU economies. As part of the \r\nfinancial programming, we have set fiscal targets, \r\nwhich have been approved by the Monetary Council \r\nand published. The targets are intended to move our \r\ncountries on a path towards achieving a debt-to-GDP \r\nratio of 60 per cent by 2020. \r\n My region remains deeply concerned that AIDS \r\nhas claimed 30 million lives and orphaned 16 million \r\nchildren since it was first discovered in 1981. My \r\nregion remains committed to intensifying national \r\nefforts to create enabling legal, social and policy \r\nframeworks to eliminate stigma, discrimination and \r\nviolence related to HIV and to promote \r\nnon-discriminatory access to HIV prevention, \r\ntreatment, care and support. \r\n As a small developing nation, we can easily \r\nidentify with the President’s call for enhancing South-\r\nSouth and triangular cooperation. This, after all, was \r\nperhaps his signature issue during his tenure as \r\nChairman of the Committee on South-South \r\nCooperation. His choice of improving disaster \r\nprevention and response also resonates with us. The \r\nincrease in the frequency and intensity of natural and \r\nman-made disasters and the devastation wrought by \r\nthem on vulnerable countries such as my own leave us \r\nwith no choice but to develop ways to build our \r\ncapacities so that we are better prepared to withstand \r\nthese disasters. \r\n In addition to his main theme for this session, we \r\nalso support the President’s call to focus on United \r\nNations reform and revitalization so as to ensure that \r\nour Organization remains relevant, efficient and \r\neffective and is able to adapt to meeting the ever-\r\nchanging global challenges. \r\n His fourth focal area of sustainable development \r\nand global prosperity is perhaps the one with the most \r\nscope for collective action. The United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development in June 2012 \r\nwill certainly provide a forum for the international \r\ncommunity to, among other things, recommit to \r\nsustainable development, the eradication of poverty \r\nand achieving the Millennium Development Goals by \r\nensuring the balance among the economic, social and \r\nA/66/PV.22  \r\n \r\n11-51360 40 \r\n \r\nenvironmental aspects of sustainable development, \r\nwith the human being at the centre of our efforts. \r\n  We can no longer ask whether we can, but we \r\nneed to give an account of exactly how we will meet \r\nthe enormous political, economic, humanitarian and \r\nenvironmental challenges our planet faces. The global \r\neconomic crisis continues to shake the pillars of our \r\neconomic system: banks, businesses, Governments, \r\nprivate sectors and even our own families. Now more \r\nthan ever, we need a more efficient, effective and \r\nfocused United Nations that is both transparent and \r\naccountable to help us address the extraordinary array \r\nof geopolitical and humanitarian challenges: famine in \r\nSomalia, the continued crisis in Haiti, the aftershocks \r\nof the Arab Spring, ongoing conflicts in some countries \r\nand difficult transitions in others, in addition to the \r\ndeeper political, economic and environmental \r\ntransformations that are reshaping our world. \r\n In an increasingly uncertain world, the world’s \r\npeople are looking to us here, in this great Hall of the \r\nUnited Nations, for answers. We are their best hope for \r\nbuilding a safe, secure and just world. We cannot \r\nafford to disappoint. We know that rescuing the planet \r\nwill require us to invest in people, particularly women \r\nand youth. It will require us to re-emphasize the \r\nprevention of conflicts and natural disasters alike, and \r\nit will require us to devote new efforts to assist nations \r\nin transition from war to peace, autocracy to \r\ndemocracy, poverty to prosperity. \r\n Let us show the people of the world that we are \r\nindeed up to these enormous tasks. Then, and only \r\nthen, will we be able to say: “Yes, we did!” \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nAntigua and Barbuda for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\n Mr. Winston Baldwin Spencer, Prime Minister and \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Antigua and \r\nBarbuda, was escorted from the rostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by Sheikh Hasina, Prime Minister of \r\nthe People’s Republic of Bangladesh \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh. \r\n Sheikh Hasina, Prime Minister of the People’s \r\nRepublic of Bangladesh, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming Her Excellency Sheikh \r\nHasina, Prime Minister of the People’s Republic of \r\nBangladesh, and inviting her to address the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n Sheikh Hasina (Bangladesh) (spoke in Bangla; \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): I warmly \r\ncongratulate Mr. Al-Nasser on his well-deserved \r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-sixth session. I am confident that under his able \r\nand dynamic stewardship, we will achieve our goals. I \r\nthank former President Joseph Deiss for the success of \r\nthe sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly. I also \r\nthank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for the wise \r\nselection of the theme “The role of mediation in the \r\nsettlement of disputes by peaceful means” for this \r\nyear’s general debate.  \r\n I take this opportunity to welcome South Sudan \r\nas the 193rd Member of the United Nations and \r\nwarmly congratulate the people of the newest State on \r\nattaining their freedom and independence. \r\n I believe that peace is the basis for development. \r\nI also believe that peace prevails when justice prevails. \r\nTherefore, justice at home and abroad is important for \r\nensuring the peaceful mediation and settlement of \r\ndisputes. My father and the father of my nation, \r\nBangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who espoused \r\nthe principles of “friendship towards all, malice \r\ntowards none” and “peaceful settlement of disputes”, \r\nalso believed in this, and declared it from this rostrum \r\n37 years ago. \r\n Thus, justice for peace found its place in my \r\nGovernment’s domestic and foreign policy and has \r\ncontributed to strengthening Bangladesh’s secular, \r\ndemocratic and progressive ideals. A strong foundation \r\nin the rule of law has also helped in the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes with our neighbours and formed \r\nthe basis of our participation in United Nations \r\npeacekeeping operations. Emphasis on peaceful \r\nnegotiations has also enabled Bangladesh to maintain \r\nan annual gross domestic product growth rate of 6 per \r\ncent, create thousands of jobs, reduce poverty and \r\nexpand social safety net schemes to the poor, \r\ndisadvantaged, elderly and deprived women. \r\n A/66/PV.22\r\n \r\n41 11-51360 \r\n \r\n The role of the United Nations has changed since \r\nits establishment. The maintenance of international \r\npeace and security now includes the new challenges of \r\nintra-State ethnic strife, terrorism, transnational crimes, \r\nclimate change, poverty, energy and water security, as \r\nwell as the widening gap between the rich and the poor. \r\nHowever, the successes of the United Nations have \r\nreinforced the belief that, in the twenty-first century, it \r\nremains the most legitimate and universally accepted \r\ninternational body with the ability to harness the global \r\ncollective will necessary for the peaceful settlement of \r\ndisputes through mediation. \r\n Bangladesh therefore commends the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report on enhancing mediation and its \r\nsupport activities (S/2009/189) for promoting the better \r\nuse of the United Nations mediation mandate, and \r\nco-sponsored resolution 65/283 on strengthening the \r\nrole of mediation in the peaceful settlement of \r\ndisputes, conflict prevention and resolution.  \r\n To demonstrate its strong commitment to conflict \r\nresolution, Bangladesh has partnered in many United \r\nNations endeavours for peace, democracy and \r\ndevelopment. Our contribution to United Nations \r\npeacekeeping of 102,294 peacekeepers in 52 missions \r\nand 36 countries has sadly led to the loss of the lives of \r\n103 brave Bangladeshis. Our involvement also includes \r\nthe first all-women United Nations police unit in Haiti. \r\n As Non-Aligned Movement Coordinator in the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, Bangladesh is always \r\nadvocating in favour of peacebuilding, development \r\nand preventive diplomacy in post-conflict societies. \r\nUnfortunately, we remain woefully underrepresented at \r\nthe planning and strategy-making levels of the \r\nDepartment of Peacekeeping Operations, which should \r\nbe promptly redressed. As a member of the Human \r\nRights Council and the Economic and Social Council, \r\nwe conscientiously promote democracy, secularism, \r\njustice and the rule of law, and equal rights for women, \r\nchildren, minorities and other vulnerable groups. As a \r\nmember of the executive bodies of the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP), the United Nations \r\nPopulation Fund, UNICEF, UNESCO and the Food and \r\nAgriculture Organization, we are committed to setting \r\nglobal norms and standards in development practices. \r\n Since I believe that justice brings peace, in 1997, \r\nduring my previous term as Prime Minister, I mediated \r\nthe Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord for the \r\nmarginalized communities of the Hill Tracts region. \r\nThe Accord, which was signed after intense \r\ndiscussions, ended a 20-year conflict that cost over \r\n20,000 lives. During the same term, I mediated the \r\nsigning of the 30-year Ganges Water Sharing Treaty \r\nwith neighbouring India. During my current term, this \r\nmonth we mediated and signed memoranda of \r\nunderstanding with India on our border demarcation, \r\nan issue that had been pending for the past 64 years, \r\ncausing obstructions in the everyday life of my people. \r\nI am committed to settling all our problems with \r\nneighbouring India through discussion. \r\n During my current term and soon after forming \r\nthe Government, one of the most dangerous challenges \r\nthat I have faced was the mutiny of our border forces, \r\nwhich took 72 lives. Yet, that time, too, I chose a \r\nmediated settlement, thereby avoiding possible further \r\nloss of life. As a result, I came to believe that there can \r\nbe no peace without justice. We have established an \r\nindependent International Crimes Tribunal to try those \r\nresponsible for war crimes committed during our \r\nliberation war in 1971. Their eventual punishment will \r\nstrengthen our democracy and show that the State is \r\ncapable of just retribution. \r\n As a State party to the Rome Statute of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court, we believe in the \r\nStatute’s mandate of bringing perpetrators to justice. I \r\nam fully committed to battling terrorism in all its \r\nforms, having personally suffered from acts of terror. \r\nHere, I recall with profound sadness the brutal \r\nassassination of my father, the first President of \r\nBangladesh, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, \r\nand 18 of my immediate family members, including \r\nmy mother and three brothers, on 15 August 1975. I \r\nalso recall the grenade attack on me and my followers \r\nat a peace rally on 21 August 2004, which left 24 dead \r\nand nearly 500 injured. I miraculously escaped but \r\nwith permanent loss of hearing. \r\n I often think of all the victims of terrorism, \r\nespecially those of the 11 September 2001 attacks in \r\nNew York, as well as attacks that have taken place \r\nelsewhere in the world. Indeed, if peace is to prevail, \r\nthese terrorists must be brought to justice. \r\n Our Government has a zero-tolerance policy \r\ntowards terrorism. Our aim is to break the nexus \r\nbetween terrorism, extremism and radicalization and \r\neliminate all of them from Bangladesh, a State party to \r\nall United Nations counter-terrorism conventions. At \r\nthe same time, we are strengthening our democratic \r\nA/66/PV.22  \r\n \r\n11-51360 42 \r\n \r\ninstitutions, such as the commissions on elections, \r\nanti-corruption, human rights, information, as well as \r\nour judiciary, legislature and law enforcement \r\nagencies, which are tools for eliminating terrorism and \r\nextremism. \r\n Since justice begets peace and peace is vital for \r\ndevelopment, our policies are attuned to ensuring \r\npeoples’ rights. In pursuing the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), we are also fulfilling our \r\npeople’s aspirations. The United Nations Award for \r\nMDG 4 on reducing child mortality, which I received \r\nlast year, is a case in point. We are also on track to \r\nachieve MDG 1 on poverty alleviation, MDG 2 on \r\nuniversal primary education, MDG 3 on gender \r\nequality and MDG 5 on reducing maternal mortality. \r\nOur poverty reduction strategy is in tandem with the \r\nMillennium Development Goals and intends to raise \r\n12 million people out of poverty by 2015. \r\n For development, we have integrated women’s \r\neducation into our State policy. There is a saying that \r\ngoes, “If you educate a boy, you educate a person; if \r\nyou educate a girl, you educate a family and a whole \r\nnation”. Therefore, during our first term from 1996 to \r\n2001, we adopted a national women’s development \r\npolicy that has been revised during our current term to \r\nmake it more relevant. The policy provides for the \r\nempowerment of women, their participation in \r\ndecision-making, their protection, and gender equality. \r\nEducation for girls is free up to the twelfth grade, and \r\nsteps are on their way to ensure their free tuition until \r\ngraduation. \r\n Following the 2008 general elections, women’s \r\nparticipation in politics increased with their election to \r\n12,828 reserved seats in local Government bodies and \r\n64 members in the national Parliament. We also have \r\nfive women Cabinet ministers in charge of agriculture, \r\nhome, foreign affairs, women’s and children’s affairs, \r\nand labour. The Opposition Leader, the Deputy Leader, \r\na Whip and, of course, the Prime Minister are all \r\nwomen. For the first time in our history, two women \r\nMembers of Parliament have been made Chairs of \r\nParliamentary Standing Committees. Women now \r\noccupy high positions in the Supreme Court, in civil, \r\npolice and armed services, and in United Nations \r\npeacekeeping missions. Female business ventures also \r\nreceive support from the Small and Medium Enterprise \r\nFoundation. \r\n To achieve our election pledge of a digital \r\nBangladesh and to make Bangladesh a middle-income \r\ncountry by 2021, the golden jubilee year of our \r\nindependence, we are expanding the reach of \r\ninformation and communications technology \r\nthroughout the country. UNDP Administrator Helen \r\nClark was with us this year to witness the launching of \r\ne-connectivity through our 4,500 information and \r\nservice centres, which provide Internet access to \r\nmillions of rural people. We have also set up an \r\ne-centre for rural communities, which connects 8,500 \r\npost offices, a high-tech park, e-governance \r\ncapabilities and an e-infrastructure-building process.  \r\n I believe in that health for all is an essential \r\nprecondition for development. Primary health-care \r\nservices are delivered through 11,000 community \r\nhealth centres in rural areas, with each providing \r\nservices to 6,000 people. My Government has also \r\nrecently started raising awareness about autism and \r\ndevelopmental disorders in children. Last July, we \r\nlaunched the Global Autism Public Health Initiative in \r\nDhaka to help those disadvantaged with such disorders. \r\n However, to pursue those efforts and to develop \r\nsocio-economic security, least developed countries \r\n(LDCs), such as Bangladesh, need international \r\nsupport. The support must come from granting us \r\nmarket access, removing trade barriers, the fulfilment \r\nof overseas development aid and combating climate \r\nchange. The commitments made in Istanbul this May \r\non agriculture, energy, infrastructure, water and \r\nmigration would also strengthen the economic stability \r\nof LDCs. It is now time for development partners to \r\nimplement the commitments made in Monterrey, Paris \r\nand Brussels before the conclusion of the Doha \r\nDevelopment Round. Support must continue to enable \r\nLDCs to fulfil their Millennium Development Goals. \r\n Such support is especially important for \r\nBangladesh under the extra tension of climate change. \r\nA metre rise in the sea level due to global warming \r\nwould inundate a fifth of our landmass, displacing over \r\n30 million people. That would be the largest \r\nhumanitarian crisis in history. In order not to lose time, \r\nwe have prepared a 134-point adaptation and \r\nmitigation plan that includes river dredging, \r\nafforestation of 20 per cent of the land, increasing food \r\nproduction with crop varieties adapted to climate \r\nchange, et cetera. We also established the Climate \r\nChange Trust Fund with $300 million from our own \r\n A/66/PV.22\r\n \r\n43 11-51360 \r\n \r\nfunds and the Bangladesh Climate Change Resilience \r\nFund with $110 million from donors.  \r\n Bangla is spoken by over 300 million people \r\nworldwide. I earnestly appeal to Member States to back \r\nmy proposal to declare Bangla one of the official \r\nlanguages of the United Nations. I also seek their \r\nsupport for Bangladesh’s annual flagship resolution on \r\na culture of peace, which I launched in 2000, when I \r\nwas Prime Minister for the first time. \r\n Throughout my half-century in politics, I have \r\nalways been a crusader of peace. I believe that peace is \r\nachievable by eliminating injustices, which includes \r\nRepression, the absence of the rule of law, inequality, \r\neconomic disparity, deprivation, poverty, the \r\nsuppression of self-determination, the denial of \r\nsecularism and multi-ethnicity, the negligence of equal \r\nrights for women and the marginalized, and the lack of \r\ntransparency and accountability of Governments. \r\nThose types of injustices, according to the Uppsala \r\nConflict Data Programme, led to the loss of more than \r\n5 million lives from 1964 to 2011. I believe that such \r\ndeaths could have been avoided by strengthening the \r\nmediation instruments of the United Nations and by \r\nplacing people at the centre of peace and development. \r\n In fact, my life experiences have inspired me to \r\ncome up with a new peace model, based on the \r\nempowerment of people. It is a multidimensional plan \r\nthat champions democracy and places people’s \r\nempowerment at the centre, with six mutually \r\nreinforcing peace multipliers. They are: first, the \r\neradication of poverty and hunger; secondly, the \r\nreduction of inequality; thirdly, the mitigation of \r\ndeprivation; fourthly, the inclusion of excluded \r\npersons; fifthly, the acceleration of human \r\ndevelopment; and sixthly, the elimination of terrorism. \r\n I call it the people’s empowerment model. It \r\nreaffirms that all people should be treated equally, and \r\nemphasizes the empowerment of people and the \r\nenhancement of human capabilities for the realization \r\nof peace. \r\n Prosperity is achievable with the removal of \r\ninjustice and disempowerment in an environment of \r\npeace. That is possible by individual nations through \r\nsincere implementation of what is right, sometimes \r\nunder the guidance of the United Nations. Let us all try \r\nto test that model of people’s empowerment, which I \r\nbelieve has the potential to transform our world of \r\n7 billion people into one where our future generations \r\nmay prosper and live in happiness. \r\n May Bangladesh live forever. Long live the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPrime Minister of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh \r\nfor the statement she has just made. \r\n Sheikh Hasina, Prime Minister of the People’s \r\nRepublic of Bangladesh, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Freundel Stuart, Prime \r\nMinister and Minister for National Security \r\nof Barbados  \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister and Minister for National Security of \r\nBarbados. \r\n Mr. Freundel Stuart, Prime Minister and Minister \r\nfor National Security of Barbados, was escorted \r\nto the rostrum. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency \r\nMr. Freundel Stuart, Prime Minister and Minister for \r\nNational Security of Barbados, and inviting him to \r\naddress the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Stuart (Barbados): I am pleased to convey \r\nmy greetings to the President and to offer him the \r\ncongratulations of my Government and the delegation \r\nof Barbados on his election as President of the General \r\nAssembly at this sixty-sixth session. Those of us who \r\nare familiar with the very high standards to which he \r\nroutinely subscribes confidently expect him to steer the \r\ndeliberations of this session with his accustomed calm \r\nand skill. It is appropriate that I also commend his \r\npredecessor in office, Mr. Joseph Deiss, for the aplomb \r\nwith which he guided the deliberations of the sixty-\r\nfifth session of this Assembly. \r\n I am also pleased to congratulate Mr. Ban \r\nKi-moon on his reappointment as Secretary-General. I \r\nacknowledge the sterling work that he has done over \r\nthe past five years, and wish him a successful second \r\nterm.  \r\n I am especially delighted to extend \r\ncongratulations to the Government and people of the \r\nA/66/PV.22  \r\n \r\n11-51360 44 \r\n \r\nRepublic of South Sudan on their achievement of \r\nindependence. On behalf of the Government and \r\npeople of Barbados, I reiterate our support and \r\nsolidarity on South Sudan’s admission to the United \r\nNations as its 193rd Member. \r\n It is with genuine pleasure that I address the \r\nAssembly today in my capacity as Prime Minister of \r\nBarbados. The untimely death 11 months ago of my \r\npredecessor in office placed on my shoulders the \r\nprimary responsibility of pursuing the ideals to which \r\nBarbados is committed both at home and abroad. \r\n Some 45 years ago, our first Prime Minister, in \r\nhis maiden address to this Assembly, articulated our \r\nposition in the following terms:  \r\n “The people of Barbados do not draw a dividing \r\nline between their internal affairs and their \r\nforeign policy. They strive in their domestic \r\narrangements to create a just society for \r\nthemselves. In their Constitution they affirm \r\nrespect for the rule of law; they also declare their \r\nintention to establish and maintain the kind of \r\nsociety which enables each citizen, to the full \r\nextent of his capacity, to play his part in national \r\nlife … In thus charting our domestic course, we \r\ncan have no interest in a foreign policy that \r\ncontradicts our national goals … [W]e are \r\nexponents, not of the diplomacy of power, but of \r\nthe diplomacy of peace and prosperity.” \r\n(A/PV.1487, paras. 75-78) \r\n Much, of course, has changed since then. The \r\nworld we know today is vastly different from the world \r\nof 1966, yet we continue to keep faith with the vision \r\nof the father of our independence. My task in \r\naddressing the General Assembly on matters of foreign \r\npolicy is therefore, paradoxically, at once easy and \r\ndifficult. It is easy because we still adhere to our \r\nfoundational principles; it is difficult because we now \r\nhave to apply them in a world that has grown much \r\nmore complex, much more volatile and much more \r\ndangerous. \r\n If we need further proof that we live in an \r\ninterconnected world, the present economic downturn \r\nprovides a painful reminder. When large economies \r\nsuch as those of the United States and Europe are \r\nreeling, one may well imagine the toll that the worst \r\ncrisis since the Great Depression is taking on small \r\nvulnerable societies like those that populate the \r\nCaribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean. \r\n We in Barbados have chosen to withstand the \r\neconomic storms that assail us by relying on the good \r\njudgment of our people to come together in times of \r\nperil. My Government has partnered with the business \r\ncommunity and the trade union movement to ensure \r\nthat layoffs and wage demands alike are kept to an \r\nabsolute minimum so that the gain and the pain are \r\nshared equitably. We are committed to protecting the \r\nmost vulnerable among us because it is our settled \r\nconviction that a nation is more than just an economy; \r\nit is also a society. \r\n The cruel irony of the current downturn is that it \r\nmight have been avoided if corporations had restrained \r\ntheir greed and Government oversight and regulation at \r\nthe international, regional and national levels had been \r\nmore vigorous and rigorous. This highlights the urgent \r\nneed for a new architecture of global finance that will \r\nrender unlikely the prospect of our lurching from one \r\ncrisis to another, and lay the groundwork for a smooth \r\nand balanced economic recovery that avoids the \r\nmassive social dislocations we are now witnessing. \r\nRecovery that comes at the expense of the poorest and \r\nmost vulnerable in our societies is not only \r\nunenlightened economics, but also very dangerous \r\npolitics. \r\n We in Barbados have welcomed the rise of the \r\nglobal economy in the past two decades, since it has \r\nthe potential for creating prosperity for all nations. But \r\nit will realize its potential only if the increasingly \r\nvolatile flows of international capital are governed by \r\nfair and transparent rules. In laying down an orderly \r\nframework for global financial and economic \r\ntransactions, we urge that the international community \r\napply the principle enunciated by Aristotle upwards of \r\n2,000 years ago that there should be equality between \r\nequals and proportionality between unequals. \r\n Barbados believes that the path to prosperity lies \r\nin open economies, open societies and open \r\nGovernments, and is constantly positioning itself to \r\ncompete as a fully compliant, transparent, rules-\r\ngoverned global entrepreneurial and financial centre. \r\n Yet, to our dismay, we find that the rich and \r\npowerful keep changing the rules to their advantage \r\nand to our disadvantage. It is a violation both of fair \r\nplay and of common sense to move the goalposts while \r\nthe game is in progress. Let it be clearly understood \r\nthat, on this issue, it is not charity we seek; it is justice \r\nwe demand. \r\n A/66/PV.22\r\n \r\n45 11-51360 \r\n \r\n However, none of the nations represented in this \r\nAssembly will enjoy sustainable prosperity if we \r\ncontinue to abuse the environment which we hold in \r\nsacred trust for future generations. It is an inconvenient \r\ntruth that the success of humankind’s development \r\ngoals will depend on the ability of our planet to sustain \r\nour consumption and production activities. We must be \r\ncautious, therefore, about how we use fossil fuels, \r\nabout carbon emission levels and about the unregulated \r\ntreatment of waste. The planet has now begun to \r\nprotest through dramatic changes in climate and the \r\nprospect of sea-level rise. The very existence of small \r\nisland States like those in the Caribbean and the Pacific \r\ncould be imperilled if current trends are not halted or \r\nreversed. \r\n Barbados has been an active participant in the \r\nenvironmental movement since the 1992 United \r\nNations Conference on Environment and Development \r\nin Rio. We are proud to have hosted the first Global \r\nConference on the Sustainable Development of Small \r\nIsland States in 1994 and continue to work with other \r\nsmall island developing States to update and improve \r\nthe Barbados Programme of Action and the Mauritius \r\nStrategy for its further implementation. We continue to \r\nwork also towards the success of the 2012 United \r\nNations Conference on Sustainable Development. \r\n I am deeply honoured to have been asked to serve \r\non the Secretary-General’s High-Level Panel on Global \r\nSustainability. That our task is challenging no one will \r\ndeny, required as we are to formulate a blueprint for \r\neconomic growth and prosperity that focuses on the \r\neradication of poverty, while ensuring greater equality \r\nand inclusion and reducing the devastating impact of \r\nhuman activities on ecosystems and the environment. \r\nThe work of the Panel is progressing smoothly, and I \r\nassure the Assembly that my colleagues and I have \r\nreadily accepted the challenge. \r\n Without peace and security, it is difficult to create \r\nand maintain the social conditions that constitute a \r\nprerequisite for economic progress and prosperity. The \r\nprotracted conflict in the Middle East between Israel \r\nand the Palestinians has become a disturbing anomaly \r\nin a world where so many other disputes have been \r\npeacefully resolved. It is an anomaly because everyone \r\nknows what the solution is. It is disturbing because the \r\nonly thing preventing a resolution of the issue is an \r\nunhappy convergence of dysfunctional political \r\ncurrents at the domestic level. \r\n The State of Israel has a right to exist, and the \r\npeople of Israel have a right to live in security and to \r\ndo so with the full and undisputed recognition of the \r\nrest of the world. On the other hand, the Palestinians \r\nare entitled also to enjoy the fruits of prosperity within \r\ntheir own sovereign State. Much else in this conflict \r\nmay be negotiable. Surely, those two postulates are not. \r\nThe Holy Land has for centuries been the locus of \r\nhumanity’s hopes. It is high time that it now become a \r\nsymbol, not of humanity’s divisions, but of humanity’s \r\nunity. This state of affairs will ensue only when the \r\ndisgracefully long wait of the Palestinians for a \r\nhomeland is brought to an end. \r\n In a similar vein, the Government and the people \r\nof Barbados fully embrace Cuba as an important \r\npartner in the Caribbean region and, since 1972, have \r\ncommitted themselves to a policy of constructive \r\nengagement with its Government and people. Barbados \r\nrespects the sovereign rights of Cuba and supports \r\nunequivocally its full integration into our hemisphere. \r\nBarbados does not believe that actions such as the \r\ndecades-long economic embargo aimed at isolating \r\nCuba, or any other measures that create greater \r\nhardship for the Cuban people, will facilitate the full \r\nintegration which we consider to be both desirable and \r\nnecessary. My delegation thinks, therefore, that the \r\neconomic embargo against Cuba has long outlived its \r\nusefulness and should be lifted. \r\n Barbados remains committed also to supporting \r\nthe development and the advancement of the people of \r\nHaiti. For my delegation, the reconstruction of Haiti, \r\nincluding the rebuilding of its democratic institutions, \r\ncontinues to be a high priority. We fully support the \r\ncall made in July by the Heads of State and \r\nGovernment of the Caribbean Community for the \r\ninternational community to fulfil its pledges to finance \r\nthe reconstruction of Haiti following the devastation of \r\nthe earthquake that occurred in January 2010. \r\n Terrorism, whether emanating from States or \r\nfrom non-State actors, is an attack on what we have \r\nalways known to be the core values of the \r\nOrganization. I speak of the rule of law; the protection \r\nof civilians; mutual respect between people of different \r\nfaiths and cultures; and the peaceful resolution of \r\nconflict. \r\n It is the view of my delegation that the United \r\nNations must be the foremost form of collective \r\nsecurity against terrorism, convinced as we are that \r\nA/66/PV.22  \r\n \r\n11-51360 46 \r\n \r\nwhile terrorism may arise out of conditions of \r\ninsecurity and deprivation, it should never be accepted \r\nor justified in the pursuit of any cause whatsoever. \r\n Barbados therefore continues to be an active and \r\ncommitted partner in global efforts to combat terrorism \r\nand other transnational criminal activities. We have \r\nexperienced first-hand the deleterious effects on our \r\nsocieties of the illicit trade in small arms and light \r\nweapons. At their Summit in July 2011, CARICOM \r\nHeads of Government committed themselves to accord \r\nthe highest national and regional priority to combating \r\nand eradicating the illicit trade in small arms and light \r\nweapons and their ammunition. \r\n We have a vested interest, therefore, in the \r\nsuccess of the United Nations Conference on the Arms \r\nTrade Treaty, to be held in 2012. We will continue to \r\nwork with other Member States to achieve the ultimate \r\nobjective of a legally binding, robust and \r\ncomprehensive Arms Trade Treaty which imposes the \r\nhighest possible standards for the transfer of \r\nconventional arms, including small arms, light \r\nweapons and ammunition. \r\n Much has changed since the formation of the \r\nUnited Nations in 1945. Some of the global challenges \r\nwe face today, such as the pandemics of HIV/AIDS and \r\nnon-communicable diseases, climate change, the \r\ngrowth of the illicit drug trade, transnational crime and \r\nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, are \r\nnew. Others, including extreme poverty, genocide, \r\nterrorism and civil conflict, are old. Yet the need for \r\nthe United Nations remains as pressing today as it was \r\nat the time of its formation. While the United Nations \r\nis an organization of sovereign States, it exists to serve \r\nthe needs of all the peoples of the world. \r\n We need to be constantly reminded, therefore, \r\nthat even if he can vote to choose his Government, a \r\nyoung man living with AIDS who faces daily \r\ndiscrimination is not truly free. Even if she earns a \r\ncomfortable living, a woman who lives in fear of daily \r\nviolence and has no say in how her country is run is \r\nnot truly free. Even if he enjoys freedom of speech and \r\nassembly, a young man dying of hunger is not truly \r\nfree. Freedom to live in dignity, freedom from fear and \r\nfreedom from want are inextricably connected. Indeed, \r\nall people, wherever they can be found, have the right \r\nto security and to development. \r\n As Member States, we must recommit ourselves, \r\ntherefore, to realizing the ideals of the Organization, \r\nbearing in mind that commitment to the pragmatic and \r\nthe possible must sometimes be our steppingstone to \r\nthe realization of the ideal. That approach, Barbados is \r\nconvinced, is an infallible way of giving effect to the \r\ndetermination of the founders of the United Nations “to \r\nsave succeeding generations from the scourge of war” \r\nand “to promote social progress and better standards of \r\nlife in larger freedom”. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPrime Minister and Minister for National Security of \r\nBarbados for the statement he has just made. \r\n  Mr. Freundel Stuart, Prime Minister and Minister \r\nfor National Security of Barbados, was escorted \r\nfrom the rostrum.  \r\n  \r\n  Address by Mr. Mahmoud Jibreel, Chairman \r\nof the National Transitional Council Executive \r\nOffice of Libya \r\n  \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Chairman of \r\nthe National Transitional Council Executive Office of \r\nLibya. \r\n  Mr. Mahmoud Jibreel, Chairman of the National \r\nTransitional Council Executive Office of Libya, \r\nwas escorted to the rostrum. \r\n  The Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency \r\nMr. Mahmoud Jibreel, Chairman of the National \r\nTransitional Council Executive Office of Libya, and \r\ninviting him to address the Assembly on behalf of a \r\nnew, free Libya.  \r\n  Mr. Jibreel (Libya) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, allow me to thank most sincerely the \r\nAmbassador of sisterly Qatar on his election to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth \r\nsession. I should like also to thank Secretary-General \r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon on his reappointment to a second \r\nterm as Secretary-General. \r\n I stand before the Assembly today feeling sadness \r\nand awe at the loss of the more than 30,000 martyrs \r\nwho sacrificed their lives for my country. Their sacred \r\nblood was shed to write a new history for the new \r\nLibya. By the same token, I bow before the mothers \r\nwho now know that their sons’ sacrifice was just and \r\nrightful. Had the same events been repeated, mothers, \r\nfathers, sons and daughters would have done the same, \r\n A/66/PV.22\r\n \r\n47 11-51360 \r\n \r\nin order to write the new history. From this rostrum, let \r\nme salute all the martyrs whose blood was shed, and all \r\nthe mothers and fathers in Libya. I also salute the \r\nthousands of wounded in hospitals both inside and \r\noutside Libya. \r\n Two years ago, in this very Hall and on this very \r\nspot, Muammar Al-Qadhafi stood before the Assembly \r\nand tore up the Charter of the United Nations. That was \r\na pathetic, theatrical move that disdainfully flouted \r\ninternational values. Even though we might have some \r\nreservations about the rules that govern the work of \r\ninternational organizations, they should not be judged \r\nin such a manner or treated in such a theatrical way, \r\nwhich is harmful to the people of Libya, to the \r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, to the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly and indeed to the \r\nentire Organization.  \r\n I stand before the Assembly today to show the \r\nworld that a new Libya is being born, a Libya that \r\nlooks ahead with a vision of development and self-\r\nrealization, a Libya that wants to heal its wounds, \r\novercome its pain and reach out to the entire world. \r\nThis new Libya wants to rebuild and to reform its \r\nhistory. \r\n The vision of the new Libya is that of a civil, \r\ndemocratic State governed by a clear, unambiguous \r\nconstitution that sets forth rights and obligations, that \r\ndoes not discriminate between male and female, one \r\nfaction and another, one political belief and another, \r\nbetween east and west, nor along racial or ethnic lines.  \r\n All Libyans are the sons and daughters of this \r\nnation, a nation that is now determined to heal its \r\nwounds and move on after 42 years away from the \r\ninternational community. It seeks to be an active party, \r\nlike other countries of the world, one that can \r\ncontribute to a human civilization. \r\n We do not claim to have a magic wand, as \r\nMuammar Al-Qadhafi did when he looked at himself in \r\nthe mirror and suddenly discovered that he was an \r\nalmighty prophet with a solution to every problem on \r\nEarth, except for Libya’s. \r\n After 42 years, one fifth of Libya’s people live in \r\npoverty, and the country’s educational and health \r\nsystems and services are the worst in the region. \r\nInfrastructure is falling to pieces, and youth \r\nunemployment is over 30 per cent. Those are the \r\nsolutions bequeathed to us by Muammar Al-Qadhafi. \r\nLibya is witness to that. \r\n The new Libya of which I speak did not arise \r\nfrom a vacuum. It has been watered by the blood shed \r\nsince 17 February of this year, when Libyan youth \r\ndecided to turn a new page in Libyan history. The \r\nentire Libyan people — young and old, women and \r\nchildren — paid the ultimate price. All the sons and \r\ndaughters of Libya have written this page. No one can \r\nclaim to lead this revolution or own it; only the Libyan \r\npeople can claim that. \r\n In the very first week of March of this year, a \r\nparallel action was launched alongside the act of \r\nrevolutionary youth in all cities of Libya. A group of \r\npeople, including myself, was working day and night to \r\nprovide political support and to interpret the just cause \r\nof the Libyan people on Libyan soil, to interpret the \r\nprevailing oppression and dictatorship and the lack of \r\nany development for the past 42 years. Friendly, \r\nsisterly countries responded to that call. They reached \r\nout to the hands that had reached out to them. The \r\nworld helped us to shed injustice. \r\n On behalf of the Libyan people, I wish here to \r\nthank all friendly States, all sisterly States and all \r\nregional organizations. I wish to thank in particular the \r\nUnited Nations for Security Council resolutions 1970 \r\n(2011) and 1973 (2011), which were a determining \r\nfactor in eliminating injustice and protecting civilians \r\nand preventing any further massacres in my country. \r\n On the basis of such continuous diplomatic \r\nefforts, I can say today that that mission has been \r\naccomplished. Now we have a new mission. Let us \r\nmake another attempt. Let us reach out to those who \r\nneed technical assistance. Let all funds be unfrozen so \r\nthat, having freed themselves from tyranny, the Libyan \r\npeople can now rebuild. \r\n Libya today is at the crossroads of realities on the \r\nground, expectations and rightful dues. The facts can \r\nbe summarized quite briefly. The land is not yet fully \r\nliberated. There are still some fronts to be liberated. It \r\nis our right within Libya to liberate our own land, and \r\nwe hope to do just that sometime soon. \r\n Our infrastructure has been destroyed. There are \r\nmany wounded and martyred in all Libyan cities. More \r\nthan 63 schools have been destroyed. There are more \r\nthan 50,000 injured. Amputees number more than \r\n1,700. They await help and succour so that they can \r\nA/66/PV.22  \r\n \r\n11-51360 48 \r\n \r\nonce again effectively contribute to rebuilding their \r\ncountry. \r\n The social fabric needs healing, having been torn \r\nby Al-Qadhafi. He tried to turn some tribes and \r\ncommunities against each other and some regions \r\nagainst others.  \r\n The economy is broken down. Oil sits, needing to \r\npumped and exported. Although production is being \r\nresumed, we believe that more assistance is required in \r\nthat regard.  \r\n Funds and assets have been frozen. The \r\nannounced lifting of the freeze certainly does not rise \r\nto the level of what is required in order to enable \r\nreconstruction and rehabilitation of the country. State \r\ninstitutions need to be re-established and rebuilt, \r\nparticularly because the country has been deprived of \r\nany real institutions for over 42 years. Libya is a State \r\nthat had no law or institutions. Social and political \r\ndemands are jostling each other, not just in terms of \r\nparticipation but also of setting priorities.  \r\n First and foremost, we must agree on the rules \r\nand principles of participation. In addition, as the \r\nAssembly knows, there are many expectations, from \r\nour people within and from members of the \r\ninternational community without. As the Assembly \r\nconsiders how soon the transitional period will begin \r\nand how the transitional Government will be created, it \r\nis calling for respect for human rights and for respect \r\nfor foreign workers, asking that we deal with them in \r\naccordance with international norms. The Assembly \r\ncalls for us to include everyone, without exclusion, to \r\nbuild institutions at the required speed, to achieve \r\nnational reconciliation and end the arming and \r\nmilitarization of our streets and towns, and to maintain \r\nthe unity of the homeland. The international \r\ncommunity is also asking us to include it in \r\nreconstruction.  \r\n That is a great deal by any standard. \r\nNevertheless, a people that was able to bring down its \r\nregime and face political initiatives from all sides \r\ncould not accept that its situation was at a standstill. \r\nThe Transitional National Council has always rejected \r\ncompromise solutions. Through their will, the Libyan \r\nyouth and Libyan people proved that those calculations \r\nwere wrong, proving that they can win the battle and \r\nface all the challenges, despite all the doubts and \r\nproblems that I just mentioned. \r\n National unity without a unified land or without \r\nnational reconciliation is an illusion. Achieving \r\nsecurity and national reconciliation are urgent \r\nimperatives for any Government, whether interim or \r\ntransitional. No political participation is possible \r\nwithout rules, rights and obligations. Therefore, it is of \r\nthe utmost importance to put a draft constitution to the \r\nLibyan people for referendum. We want the rules of \r\npolitical participation to be fair and to govern the \r\ndialogue and competition, giving rights to all, without \r\nexcluding any individual or group.  \r\n The assets freeze on our funds must be fully \r\nlifted as soon as possible. Let me appeal to the \r\nAssembly from this rostrum and to the Security \r\nCouncil to adopt the historic resolution to lift the \r\nfreeze soon. The regime has fallen, even though we \r\nhave not yet liberated the entire homeland.  \r\n We seek the help of the United Nations, the \r\nunconditional help of friendly and sisterly countries. \r\nWe believe it to be a legitimate and undeniable right of \r\nall States to enjoy sovereignty, whatever the nature or \r\nsize of assistance that is sought and needed.  \r\n The Libya that we want is a State of law, an oasis \r\nfor human development in the Middle East. We believe \r\nthat Libya, through geography, history and its \r\ngeostrategic importance in the world, is a cultural link \r\nbetween North, South, East and West. Libya must \r\nresume that role, a role that has been denied to it for \r\nmore than 40 years now.  \r\n I believe that development solutions that Libya \r\nmay propose could help find unprecedented solutions \r\nto the phenomenon of illegal migration from the \r\nsouthern part of the African continent to Europe. We \r\nbelieve that the twenty-first century will be ruled to a \r\nlarge extent by demography, and we believe that Africa \r\nhas the greatest capacities in terms of geography and \r\nhuman resources. We believe that hundreds of millions \r\nof young Africans will be driven by poverty and \r\nunemployment to move northward. Libya can be the \r\ngateway to development, instead of being the obstacle \r\nto migration from South to North.  \r\n African labour, skills and competencies that \r\nsatisfy the needs of the European economies can \r\ncontribute to European economic growth, particularly \r\nin the light of the fact that in the next 30 years Europe \r\nwill be facing a much smaller, ageing population. In \r\n2050, the population of Europe will have diminished \r\nby 72 million; Africa’s population will be nearly \r\n A/66/PV.22\r\n \r\n49 11-51360 \r\n \r\n2 billion. We believe that all this can contribute to \r\nEuropean economic well-being and development \r\nthrough an agreement between Libyan capital and \r\nEuropean technology. \r\n On the political front, Libya must be a civilian \r\ndemocratic State that gives full opportunities and \r\nparticipation to all its sons and daughters. Women must \r\nhave a major role in the reconstruction of such a State. \r\nWomen in Libya, about 50 per cent of the population, \r\nenjoy a very high level of education, because many \r\ncontinue their education beyond high school. We \r\nbelieve that women have a genuine role to play in \r\nrebuilding and developing Libya.  \r\n As for foreign policy, we need a vision that \r\nradically reviews Muammar Al-Qadhafi’s foreign \r\npolicy, which was designed to sow fear, terrorism and \r\nblackmail in many regions of the world. Rare is the \r\nregion of the world that escaped suffering from \r\nMuammar Al-Qadhafi’s practices and plots to \r\ndestabilize them through terrorism. Our new foreign \r\npolicy must be based on mutual respect and respect for \r\nmutual interests, and on non-intervention in the \r\ninternal affairs of others, just as we do not accept that \r\nothers intervene in our affairs. International \r\ninstruments, conventions, treaties, norms, values and \r\nethical principles must be respected. These are the \r\nterms of reference for all relationships today. \r\n Rebuilding Libya into a civilian democratic State \r\nis an important matter, not only for Libya but, in our \r\nview, for the entire region as well. Libya is capable of \r\nbecoming, and has the opportunity to become, a model \r\nof democracy and successful development. The \r\nnegative effects of the separation of a country’s politics \r\nfrom its economy have brought many problems and \r\ndifficulties to this region. \r\n The time has come for a vision of development \r\nthat puts young people and women at the very top of its \r\nlist of priorities — not just because they make up \r\n67 per cent of the population of the Arab world, but \r\nbecause the future belongs to them. It is they who \r\nstarted and led this revolution and the other revolutions \r\nof the Arab Spring. We therefore need a new vision that \r\nresponds to the dreams of youth, a vision that the \r\ninternational community must support; otherwise, the \r\nregion will only be subjected to successive waves of \r\ninstability. \r\n Supporting Libya in this development paradigm \r\nis no less important and critical than protecting \r\ninnocent civilians. The international community, whom \r\nwe thank, did this in implementing Security Council \r\nresolution 1973 (2011). In this context, we are \r\nproposing a clear initiative, which could be termed \r\n“building the new Libya”, to which our brothers and \r\nfriends contribute. However, the United Nations must \r\nplay a pioneering and leading role here, one through \r\nwhich its specialized development agencies can \r\nprovide expertise and technical assistance. We must \r\ngive those agencies precedence over private companies \r\nin order to avoid any possibility of corruption or lack \r\nof transparency and fairness. \r\n Mr. Archondo (Plurinational State of Bolivia), \r\nVice-President, took the Chair. \r\n We believe that roads are made by the feet that \r\nwalk on them. The Libyan people have now begun \r\ntheir march towards rewriting their history. We have \r\ngreat hopes in this international Organization, which \r\nhas travelled hand in hand with us. It was a \r\ntrustworthy, reliable friend — as was, indeed, the \r\nentire international community — and prevented an \r\nimminent massacre in my country by intervening at the \r\nright time to save civilians. That makes a reality of the \r\nArab League’s call for an intervention, and we thank \r\nthe League for that. Just as the United Nations was a \r\nfaithful friend at that time, we believe it can now be a \r\ntrusted and supportive partner in the rebuilding of my \r\ncountry. This is the major battle, for which we appeal \r\nto the Assembly for assistance — political, economic, \r\nfinancial and technical. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nChairman of the National Transitional Council \r\nExecutive Office of Libya for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\n Mr. Mahmoud Jibreel, Chairman of the National \r\nTransitional Council Executive Office of Libya, \r\nwas escorted from the rostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Lawrence Gonzi, Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Malta \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of Malta. \r\n Mr. Lawrence Gonzi, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Malta, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\nA/66/PV.22  \r\n \r\n11-51360 50 \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency \r\nMr. Lawrence Gonzi, Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof Malta, and inviting him to address the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n Mr. Gonzi (Malta): I heartily congratulate the \r\nPresident on his unanimous election to preside over the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. I wish him \r\nevery success and assure him that Malta, which enjoys \r\nexcellent relations and increasing cooperation with his \r\ncountry, Qatar, will extend its full support and \r\ncollaboration in the tasks ahead of him. I would also \r\nlike to pay tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Joseph Deiss, \r\nfor his leadership and effective role over the last 12 \r\nmonths. \r\n I would also like to convey my warm and sincere \r\ncongratulations to His Excellency Ban Ki-moon on his \r\nre-election to serve our Organization as its Secretary-\r\nGeneral for another term. My Government would like \r\nto put on record its appreciation for his firm and \r\ncapable leadership. \r\n Just two months ago this Assembly admitted by \r\nacclamation the Republic of South Sudan as the \r\n193rd Member of the United Nations. Malta is proud to \r\nhave been one of the Member States co-sponsoring the \r\nresolution that ushered the new nation-State of the \r\nRepublic of South Sudan into the world community of \r\nnations (resolution 65/308). \r\n Throughout the 12 months that have passed since \r\nwe last gathered here in this Assembly, we have all \r\nbeen witness to the continuing upheavals and crises \r\nresulting from the strife, poverty and social inequalities \r\nthat unfortunately persist in many parts of the world. \r\nThis situation has been compounded by food \r\ninsecurity, which in turn is exacerbated by the drought \r\nand famine that threaten the survival of millions of \r\npeople, particularly in Somalia and the rest of the Horn \r\nof Africa. \r\n Malta has long recognized the difficulties facing \r\ncountries in the Horn of Africa and has directed most \r\nof its development and humanitarian aid to them \r\nthrough development projects. The participation of \r\nMaltese non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in \r\nimplementing those projects has been pivotal in \r\nenabling Malta to help relieve some of the most \r\npressing needs. My Government has also answered the \r\ncall of the United Nations for financial contributions to \r\nassist in alleviating the sufferings of people in the Horn \r\nof Africa. This we did through the Central Emergency \r\nResponse Fund. \r\n It is a matter of concern, however, that only four \r\nyears remain to meet the goals that we unanimously \r\nagreed, in the Millennium Declaration of 2000 \r\n(resolution 55/2), to achieve by 2015. We \r\nacknowledge, of course, that progress has been made in \r\nsome critical areas, notwithstanding continuing \r\nadversities. But we are still not there.  \r\n Within its limited means, Malta has been able to \r\nfinancially assist and support NGOs and interested \r\nindividuals to carry out projects in developing and least \r\ndeveloped countries. Over the past 19 months, these \r\nprojects have included building schools, clinics, \r\ncentres for persons with disabilities, social housing, \r\nand extensions at hospitals in various countries in \r\nAfrica, as well as in Central and South America. \r\n My Government continues to ask the membership \r\nof this Organization to consider the case for assistance \r\nin dealing with the influx of illegal immigrants who are \r\ncontinuing to reach Malta as a result of the situation in \r\nLibya and North Africa. We continue to call for \r\ninternational solidarity and burden-sharing in dealing \r\nwith this phenomenon. It is also our hope that the \r\nEuropean Union’s Asylum Support Office, which \r\nopened in Malta in June, will contribute to the task of \r\nstreamlining asylum policies in the European Union \r\nand its member States and improve cooperation among \r\nthe authorities. In that context, may I express the \r\nappreciation of the Government of Malta for the \r\nassistance we have received so far from a number of \r\nEuropean States and the United States of America in \r\nthe resettlement process. \r\n The Mediterranean, which links Europe, Africa \r\nand the Middle East, has not been spared the many \r\nchallenges and difficulties facing other parts of the \r\nworld. It is, however, also seeing the birth of hope in \r\nthe form of a new political and social reality as a result \r\nof the sacrifices being made by the peoples of Tunisia, \r\nEgypt, Libya and Syria as they strive to take back the \r\npolitical leadership of their countries. Malta salutes \r\nthese brave people. \r\n As we heard a few minutes ago from His \r\nExcellency Mr. Jibreel, who spoke on behalf of Libya, \r\nthese are turbulent times for Libya, a crucial and \r\nmomentous point in the history of the Libyan people. \r\nDuring this time, Malta, which over the course of its \r\nhistory has earned the title “nurse of the \r\n A/66/PV.22\r\n \r\n51 11-51360 \r\n \r\nMediterranean”, has also been serving as a safe \r\nharbour, where thousands have found refuge and \r\nassistance.  \r\n As a Member of this esteemed Organization, of \r\nthe European Union and of the international contact \r\ngroup on Libya, my Government has provided, over the \r\npast several months, a humanitarian hub for the \r\nevacuation of nearly 20,000 people, medical assistance \r\nand relief efforts by intergovernmental and \r\nnon-governmental organizations, including such United \r\nNations agencies as the World Food Programme. Malta \r\nis proud of this role, which it continues to play in \r\nalleviating hardships, particularly those of the Libyan \r\npeople, to this very day. \r\n As a result of the courage, vision and tenacity of \r\nits people, Libya is today on the threshold of assuming \r\nits place in the community of free and democratic \r\nnations. The approach taken by the Libyan National \r\nTransitional Council (NTC) over these recent, highly \r\ncharged weeks has undoubtedly enhanced its standing \r\nand legitimacy. We welcome the NTC’s determination \r\nto ensure that justice, and not vengeance, will be \r\npursued by these brave people. It is important that the \r\nprocess of national reconciliation take hold as soon as \r\npossible and that it be underpinned by the fullest \r\nrespect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms \r\nof all segments of the population. \r\n Allow me, at this juncture, to take this \r\nopportunity to join others in welcoming the delegation \r\nof Libya as the new and rightful representatives of \r\nLibya to the United Nations and in this Assembly. \r\n The next few months will be a major challenge \r\nfor the international community and the people of \r\nLibya alike. At this defining moment the Libyan people \r\ndeserve the fullest international solidarity on the \r\npolitical, economic and financial fronts. My \r\nGovernment supports United Nations leadership in the \r\ninternational community’s programme of action and \r\nendorses the three fundamental principles under which \r\nthe United Nations intends to operate: Libyan national \r\nownership, rapid response and delivery and, lastly, \r\neffective coordination. Close coordination, in particular \r\nwith the European Union, which we believe to be a key \r\nplayer in post-conflict assistance and support, will be \r\nespecially crucial in this scenario. \r\n Egypt and Tunisia also deserve every \r\nencouragement as they embark on the reforms ahead. \r\nDemocratic transition processes need to be sustained, \r\nincluding from the economic perspective. A holistic \r\napproach is a crucial element in maximizing \r\ninternational endeavours, not least to stimulate \r\neconomic growth. Democracy stands a better chance of \r\nflourishing if there is economic development and \r\ntangible improvement in living standards enjoyed by \r\nthe entire population. \r\n At a time when people in the Middle East, North \r\nAfrica and beyond have embarked on a new path \r\ntowards freedom, dignity and prosperity, we must also \r\ninvest our efforts and determination to fulfil the long-\r\nsought aspirations of the Palestinian people. The \r\ndramatic developments unfolding in the Arab world \r\nmake progress on the Israeli-Palestinian track even \r\nmore urgent than before.  \r\n Malta was heartened by, and welcomed, the \r\nspeech of President Obama last May, in which he laid \r\nout the foundation for future negotiations and outlined \r\na comprehensive vision for peace between Israelis and \r\nPalestinians. The resumption of meaningful and \r\nsustainable negotiations seemed, at the time, to be \r\nwithin reach. \r\n Unfortunately, that was not to be. The time \r\nframes set by the international community for the \r\nestablishment of a Palestinian State are now with us. A \r\npolitical stalemate persists, despite the fact that from \r\nan institutional perspective, the preparations for \r\nstatehood have been successfully completed. The \r\nsituation on the ground further complicates matters and \r\nundermines the resumption of negotiations and the goal \r\nof two viable States living side by side in peace. \r\n No effort should be spared to break the deadlock \r\nin the Israeli-Palestinian talks. Getting Israelis and \r\nPalestinians back to the negotiating table with the \r\npolitical will necessary to embark on meaningful and \r\nsustainable negotiations must remain the overriding \r\ngoal. Agreement on parameters for negotiations would \r\nclearly be a step in the right direction. In this regard, \r\nMalta fully stands behind the efforts of the European \r\nUnion, particularly those of its High Representative for \r\nForeign Affairs and Security Policy, to make this \r\nhappen. \r\n My Government strongly believes that the \r\nelements set out in the conclusions adopted by the \r\nForeign Affairs Council of the European Union in \r\nDecember 2009, December 2010 and May 2011 \r\nprovide balanced parameters for the resumption of \r\nnegotiations. \r\nA/66/PV.22  \r\n \r\n11-51360 52 \r\n \r\n Two weeks ago, the New York community and \r\nthe American people were joined by the international \r\ncommunity in commemorating the victims of one of \r\nthe most heinous crimes committed in recent history. \r\nWe all remember with sadness and sorrow that fateful \r\nday of 11 September 2001, when the hand of evil \r\ncarried out a terrorist attack on the World Trade Centre \r\nin downtown New York. The 10 years that have passed \r\nsince that tragic event, when nearly 3,000 innocent \r\npeople met their deaths and thousands more were \r\nwounded, have not erased the scars or the pain. \r\n Terrorism continues to respect no frontiers. Many \r\nStates have been and continue to be the victims of \r\ndeadly attacks by terrorists. In Afghanistan, Iraq, India, \r\nPakistan, Russia, Spain, Indonesia, the United \r\nKingdom and China, terrorism has struck with intensity \r\nand brutality. Only one month ago, another \r\nreprehensible and deadly attack was carried out, on the \r\nUnited Nations complex in Nigeria. Malta strongly \r\ncondemns those cowardly and horrible acts and pledges \r\nto continue to work with other Member States to ensure \r\nthat such criminal acts are not only condemned in \r\nabsolute terms, but also suppressed. \r\n The events unfolding in North Africa highlight \r\nthat we must continue to promote and protect human \r\nrights across the world. That is a responsibility that our \r\npresent generation bears on behalf of future \r\ngenerations. It was in that spirit that, in my address to \r\nthe sixty-fourth session of the Assembly in 2009 (see \r\nA/64/PV.6), I proposed the drafting of a universal \r\ndeclaration of human responsibilities, as the second \r\npart of a diptych to be formed with the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights. Such a declaration \r\nwould be open for signature to any Member State \r\nwishing to subscribe to it. \r\n We have been encouraged to move forward in \r\npresenting such a draft declaration by a number of \r\nMember States that share with us a belief in the \r\ngrowing need to embrace responsibilities and duties in \r\nthe international setting. In the light of that positive \r\nresponse, my Government intends to call an \r\ninternational gathering in 2012, at the official level but \r\nwith the presence of experts, to examine the draft \r\ndeclaration that will have been prepared and finalize it \r\nin such a way that it can be opened for signature in \r\n2012. Malta strongly believes that such a declaration \r\nwould strengthen the solidarity that our rapidly \r\nchanging world demands. \r\n In conclusion, allow me to state that the \r\nenvironmental sustainability of our planet is one of the \r\npriorities of my Government. Malta is working towards \r\na successful outcome at next year’s United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development in the hope \r\nthat it will build further on the commitments agreed at \r\nthe 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment \r\nand Development. In that context, since 1988, when \r\nMalta put the protection of climate for present and \r\nfuture generations on the political agenda of the \r\nOrganization, my Government has worked to support \r\nand endorse efforts that address climate change. Malta \r\nhas also made a contribution to the Special Climate \r\nChange Fund. \r\n The coming 12 months under the presidency of \r\nAmbassador Al-Nasser offer the membership of the \r\nOrganization challenging and exciting times. The \r\nagenda of the Assembly is long and demanding. We \r\nrecognize that the President’s task will not be at all \r\neasy, and we assure him of our full support. \r\n Malta will also continue to shoulder its \r\ninternational responsibilities with vigour, commitment \r\nand determination. We stand ready to work with other \r\nMember States to make the Organization stronger and \r\nbetter able to tackle the global challenges facing \r\nmankind. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Malta for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Lawrence Gonzi, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Malta, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Mohamed Kamel Ali Amr, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Egypt, who will speak \r\nalso on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement. \r\n Mr. Amr (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): I am pleased \r\nto congratulate the brotherly State of Qatar and \r\nAmbassador Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser personally on \r\nhis election as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-six session. I am confident that Mr. Al-Nasser’s \r\nwise leadership of the Assembly’s proceedings will \r\nhelp us fulfil our ambitions and aspirations. I also \r\ncongratulate Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon on his \r\nre-election to his second term as he continues to strive \r\nto realize the purposes and principles of the Charter. \r\n A/66/PV.22\r\n \r\n53 11-51360 \r\n \r\n I proudly stand before the Assembly today \r\nrepresenting Egypt in a new era and with a new face as \r\nit leaves behind a fading era for one whose features are \r\njust emerging, and as it embarks on a new phase \r\nregarded by all Egyptians as auspicious and full of \r\npromise. The Egyptian people came out en masse on \r\n25 January calling for democratic reforms and \r\nstrengthened respect for human rights, fundamental \r\nfreedoms and social justice. The Egyptian people \r\nwanted to plant the seeds of a brighter future deep in \r\nthe land of reality, for their sake and for the benefit of \r\ntheir future generations. \r\n The people obtained what they sought. They were \r\nable to impose their word and enforce their will. They \r\nwere backed by the understanding and support of the \r\nEgyptian armed forces, which truly exemplify genuine \r\npatriotism and unity with the people of our nation. The \r\nstance of our armed forces will be remembered by \r\nhistory. It is consistent with their doctrine that they are \r\nguardians of the nation, not of a specific political \r\nregime, and with an institution that is first and \r\nforemost loyal to the people, who for their part rallied \r\naround their armed forces and expressed their \r\nappreciation.  \r\n That ideal situation was made possible by \r\ncircumstances that can rarely be repeated and that \r\nenabled the Egyptians to alter the face of their country \r\nin a historic and wonderful way. Egyptians wanted to \r\nrapidly catch up with other countries that had made \r\ngreat strides in achieving political pluralism and the \r\nalternation of power, in upholding and applying the \r\nrule of law, in relentlessly fighting corruption in its \r\nvarious forms, and in providing equal opportunities to \r\ntheir youth to fulfil their ambitions and aspirations to \r\ndecent lives. \r\n I am addressing the Assembly today as Egypt \r\nmoves forward, determined to complete the transitional \r\nphase that arose from that remarkable transformative \r\nchange. Over the past few months, and indeed since the \r\nrevolution took place, Egypt has witnessed a new \r\ninternal dynamic and a wide national debate involving \r\nall segments of society and covering all issues on the \r\nnational agenda. Foremost on that agenda are the \r\ndrafting of a new constitution and the organization of \r\nthe upcoming legislative and presidential elections. \r\nThose steps will increase the prospects of success of \r\nthe transitional phase and launch a sound political \r\nprocess commensurate with the aspirations of the \r\npeople and Egypt’s unique standing in the region and \r\nworldwide. It is a process that will culminate in the \r\nhanding of power to an elected civilian authority. \r\n Egypt is honoured to have held the chairmanship \r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement since July 2009. The \r\nstart of this session of the General Assembly coincides \r\nwith the commemoration of the fiftieth year since the \r\nfirst summit of the Movement took place, and to \r\ncelebrate its significant contributions to enhancing our \r\ninternational efforts to preserve international peace and \r\nsecurity and achieve development for the peoples of \r\nthe world in a changing international environment and \r\nin the face of multiple challenges. The commemoration \r\ncomes after a series of important events organized by \r\nthe Movement to promote the greater involvement of \r\ndeveloping countries in the governance of international \r\ninstitutions and to ensure fair participation in the \r\nprocess of international norms-setting and decision-\r\nmaking in the political, economic and social fields. \r\n On that basis and to that end, the Egyptian \r\nchairmanship of the Movement has undertaken \r\nnumerous activities to strengthen the Movement’s \r\ncapacity to respond effectively to new and ongoing \r\ninternational changes. The Movement has also played a \r\nvital role in coordinating the positions of its member \r\nStates on various issues on the international agenda, \r\nincluding those related to disarmament, collective \r\nsecurity, the reform of the United Nations, and the \r\npromotion of international ideals and values of \r\ndemocracy and respect for human rights. \r\n During its chairmanship of the Movement, Egypt \r\nhas sought to reinforce the Joint Coordinating \r\nCommittee of the Group of 77 and China. In the light \r\nof an international work agenda loaded with issues, \r\nideas and initiatives, we resolved to restore the issue of \r\ndevelopment in its various dimensions as the top \r\npriority of the United Nations, and together we adopted \r\na number of important initiatives in the fields of food \r\nsecurity, the empowerment of women and the fight \r\nagainst human trafficking. We will pursue those efforts \r\nuntil we hand over the chairmanship of the Movement \r\nin the summer of 2012 to the country chairing it next. \r\n I reiterate here today the support of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement for the historic struggle of the \r\nbrotherly Palestinian people to regain their legitimate \r\nrights, for the efforts made towards declaring the \r\nestablishment of the independent State of Palestine, \r\nwith East Jerusalem as its capital, and for its admission \r\nas a full Member of the United Nations. I also call on \r\nA/66/PV.22  \r\n \r\n11-51360 54 \r\n \r\nthe countries that have not yet recognized the State of \r\nPalestine to do so as a contribution to the pursuit of a \r\njust, lasting and comprehensive settlement of the \r\nMiddle East conflict based on the two-State solution. \r\n The Non-Aligned Movement believes that there \r\nis a pressing need for a comprehensive and substantial \r\nreform of the United Nations in order to strengthen its \r\nability to respond positively to international \r\nchallenges, to meet to the aspirations of peoples, and to \r\naddress the radical changes that have altered the shape \r\nand composition of the international community so that \r\nthe United Nations may become a true reflection of the \r\nrealities of today’s world. \r\n Such reform will not be achieved unless the \r\nSecurity Council is reformed and becomes more \r\nrepresentative, more transparent and more reflective of \r\nthe democratic nature of global action. Inevitably, \r\nmajor steps must be taken to end the monopoly of \r\npermanent members over the decision-making process \r\nin the Council and to put an end to the historical \r\ninjustice inflicted on Africa as a result of its \r\nnon-representation in the permanent membership \r\ncategory, as well as its inadequate representation in the \r\nnon-permanent membership category, despite Member \r\nStates’ growing support for the African position. In the \r\nsame context, States members of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement demand that efforts be continued to \r\nrevitalize the role of the General Assembly and to \r\nstrengthen the role of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil. \r\n The States members of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement also reaffirm the need for the international \r\ncommunity to support the work of developing countries \r\nto implement their development plans aimed at \r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals, through \r\nan enabling international climate that bolsters efforts to \r\nrealize comprehensive economic and social \r\ndevelopment, and the fulfilment by all developed \r\ncountries of their financing for development \r\ncommitments. It must also support their efforts to \r\nachieve more balanced international economic \r\nrelations and to establish a fairer international trade \r\nsystem that takes into account the development needs \r\nof developing countries. \r\n We feel nothing but deep sorrow every time we \r\nrealize that, for decades, grave historic injustice has \r\nbeen inflicted on a people while, to date, the entire \r\nworld has failed to end it. The just question of \r\nPalestine endures after two entire decades of fruitless \r\nnegotiations without the desired settlement. To this \r\nday, the Palestinian people remain deprived of their \r\nlegitimate fundamental rights, including their rights to \r\nfreedom, independence and to establish their own \r\nsovereign State on the basis of the 1967 borders, with \r\nEast Jerusalem as its capital. \r\n That is the very State for which the Palestinian \r\nPresident yesterday submitted a request for \r\nmembership of the United Nations (A/66/371, annex), \r\nafter serious and just efforts towards a final settlement \r\nhad stalled and any chance of achieving significant \r\nprogress in the negotiating process had dwindled, in \r\nparticular since the other party insists on keeping the \r\nnegotiating process open forever. Yesterday, we saw \r\nthe Quartet fail yet again to come up with a balanced \r\nvision to achieve the goal that we all know and \r\napprove of, yet differ on how to realize. \r\n It is utterly absurd to carry on talking about a \r\npeace process, while Israel continues, in all comfort \r\nand complete disregard for the objections of the \r\ncountries of the world, to construct settlements on the \r\nPalestinian territories in the West Bank, altering the \r\nfeatures of occupied East Jerusalem, using violence \r\nagainst civilians and continuing its blockade of Gaza, \r\nin violation of the provisions of international law.  \r\n Regrettably, anyone with a sense of justice \r\nfollowing the situation will see in Israel’s actions the \r\nembodiment of its continuing refusal to admit that the \r\nonly way to achieve its security is by reaching a just \r\nsettlement with the Palestinians through serious \r\nnegotiations based on clear parameters and terms of \r\nreference and a specific time frame. What is urgently \r\nneeded now is to intensify all our efforts in order to put \r\nan end to the conflict. \r\n Egypt has been and will remain committed to the \r\ngoal of achieving the just and comprehensive peace \r\nthat it initiated in the Middle East, and will continue to \r\nactively support it. Egypt will continue its efforts to \r\nend the Israeli occupation of the occupied Palestinian \r\nterritories and to resolve all final-status issues within a \r\nspecific, agreed and internationally guaranteed time \r\nframe. Egypt will also maintain its efforts to capitalize \r\non the successes achieved in Cairo through the signing \r\nof the Palestinian reconciliation agreement, thereby \r\nstrengthening Palestinian unity and efforts to achieve \r\npeace. \r\n A/66/PV.22\r\n \r\n55 11-51360 \r\n \r\n Egypt welcomes the presence of the Republic of \r\nSouth Sudan among us today as a State Member of the \r\nUnited Nations. We hope that that nascent State will \r\nplay a tangible role in regional stability, and that it will \r\nmake steady progress on the road to development and \r\ninstitution-building. At the same time, we commend \r\nthe Sudan for its commitment to implementing the \r\nComprehensive Peace Agreement and to respecting the \r\nwill of the people of the South for an independent \r\nState.  \r\n However, even though last year witnessed \r\nsignificant cooperation between the two sides, \r\noutstanding issues remain unsettled. They should be \r\nresolved within a framework of cooperation and \r\ngoodwill, which requires the formation of a genuine \r\npartnership to examine how to address such issues. It is \r\nno secret that the Sudan and South Sudan still look \r\nforward to the support of the international community \r\nfor their development and reconstruction efforts so that \r\nthe Sudan can achieve stability and development \r\nthroughout its territory, within the context of its unity \r\nand territorial integrity, and so that South Sudan can \r\nbuild its State and institutions. On that basis, I reiterate \r\nEgypt’s resolve to continue supporting both countries \r\nat all levels. \r\n On behalf of Egypt, I would also like to pay a \r\ndeserved tribute to the revolution of the sisterly State \r\nof Tunisia, which expedited dawn of the Arab Spring. I \r\nalso express our solidarity with the brotherly people of \r\nLibya, and congratulate the National Transitional \r\nCouncil on its assumption of the seat of Libya at the \r\nUnited Nations. I salute its efforts to restore stability \r\nand internal peace. I would also like to express Egypt’s \r\nreadiness to provide any support that may contribute to \r\nthe country’s reconstruction efforts and help it to get \r\nthrough this critical period. \r\n As for the brotherly State of Yemen, Egypt \r\nsupports all ongoing efforts to achieve stability and to \r\nmeet the expectations of its people, in accordance with \r\nmechanisms to be agreed by the people of Yemen \r\nthemselves. If the status quo remains unchanged, that \r\nwill undoubtedly have grave and negative implications \r\nfor the security and stability of the region. \r\n Many Egyptians are following with great concern \r\nthe serious developments in the brotherly State of Syria \r\nand the resulting loss of lives and the suffering endured \r\nby our brothers and sisters there. Today, I would like to \r\nreiterate the position previously expressed by Egypt \r\nthat the only solution to the crisis in Syria lies in \r\nending the violence and engaging in a serious dialogue \r\namong all parties in a climate of political openness. \r\n Meanwhile, I cannot fail to mention the Arab \r\nGulf region today and must emphasize that the security \r\nand stability of the brotherly Arab States of the Gulf \r\nare of particular strategic importance to Egypt. Given \r\nthe deep historical, societal, cultural, political and \r\nsecurity ties that bond us with our brothers and sisters \r\nin those countries, they are granted very high priority \r\nand attention in Egypt’s foreign policy. Egypt will \r\nalways strive to achieve the stability of that vital region \r\nof the world. \r\n The issues of disarmament and nuclear \r\nnon-proliferation remain of great importance to Egypt. \r\nIn cooperation with our international partners, we will \r\ncontinue to urge nuclear States to undertake their \r\nresponsibilities, as stipulated in the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), in order \r\nto safeguard the credibility of that legal instrument and \r\nits ensuing indivisible principles. Furthermore, Egypt \r\nwill spare no effort in pursuing the goal of realizing the \r\nuniversality of the NPT, especially in the Middle East, \r\nwhere all countries have acceded to the Treaty, with the \r\nexception of Israel, which is thus delaying the creation \r\nof a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the region.  \r\n That is why Egypt attaches great importance to \r\nthe implementation of the four action plans adopted at \r\nthe 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the NPT, \r\nand especially the plan relating to the Middle East and \r\nendorsing the holding of a conference on the Middle \r\nEast next year. In reality, we are concerned that a \r\nfacilitator has not yet been appointed or a host country \r\nselected, even though more than 16 months have \r\nelapsed since the Review Conference ended. \r\n In that context, I reiterate Egypt’s firm position \r\nthat the right to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy \r\nmust be linked to full compliance with international \r\ncommitments under the Treaty, which entails the full \r\ncooperation of all Member States with the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency, and avoiding any escalation in \r\norder to promote non-proliferation efforts in the region. \r\n Africa has always held a privileged position and \r\nunique priority status on the Egyptian foreign policy \r\nagenda. Egypt was a consistent and effective partner of \r\nthe peoples of the continent in their struggle to gain \r\nindependence in the 1950s and 1960s. This partnership \r\ncontinued during the reconstruction period that \r\nA/66/PV.22  \r\n \r\n11-51360 56 \r\n \r\nfollowed independence. Egypt will increasingly work \r\nto activate and deepen its various cooperation \r\nmechanisms and frameworks with other African \r\ncountries and strive to propel them towards a new \r\ndawn, thereby contributing to the realization of the \r\nhopes and aspirations of our peoples for more \r\ndevelopment and increased prosperity. \r\n Egypt expects the United Nations to maintain its \r\nefforts to support the various components of the \r\nAfrican peace and security architecture and to build the \r\ninstitutional capacity of the continent in conflict \r\nresolution, peacekeeping, peacebuilding and \r\nreconstruction. Those efforts should complement its \r\nsupport for the development aspirations and attempts \r\nof the African countries to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, in the light of the interlinkages \r\nbetween peace, security and development challenges in \r\nAfrica. \r\n Egypt is following with concern the ever-\r\ndeteriorating situation in Somalia and calls for \r\nconcerted regional and international efforts to put an \r\nend to the sufferings of the brotherly people of that \r\ncountry and to enable them to achieve peace and \r\nsuccess in their capacity-building process. Egypt once \r\nagain invites external parties to refrain from negatively \r\ninterfering in the internal affairs of Somalia and to \r\ncontribute instead to efforts to improve the \r\nhumanitarian situation and achieve stability.  \r\n In this regard, Egypt has effectively contributed \r\nto international efforts to address the problem of \r\ndrought in the Horn of Africa, eradicate hunger and \r\nprovide food to the affected populations. Egypt also \r\ncontributes to the fight to exterminate piracy along the \r\ncoast of Somalia, given the strategic importance of the \r\nwaters south of the Red and Arabian Seas, especially in \r\nrelation to Egypt’s national security and to the safety of \r\nnavigation in the Suez Canal. \r\n The ability of the United Nations to assume its \r\nresponsibilities depends on our collective will. What is \r\nrequired is resolve based on a robust determination to \r\nstrengthen our joint international efforts to enable the \r\nOrganization to deal more effectively with the various \r\ninternational and regional issues and problems that we \r\nface. That requires collective hard work to reinforce \r\nthe principles of democracy within multilateralism and \r\nto promote dialogue and understanding as the sole \r\nmeans for achieving our goals, thereby advancing the \r\nideals of humanity and achieving the ambitions of our \r\npeoples for freedom, justice, peace and security. \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Pedro Passos Coelho, Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Portugal \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Portugal. \r\n Mr. Pedro Passos Coelho, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Portugal, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Pedro \r\nPassos Coelho, Prime Minister of the Republic of \r\nPortugal, and inviting him to address the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n Mr. Coelho (Portugal) (spoke in Portuguese; \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): I am taking \r\nthe floor for the first time, and I would like to reiterate \r\nour thanks to the President for his dynamism and stress \r\nthe importance of the role of his country, Qatar, in \r\ninternational diplomacy. I would also like to thank \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon and warmly \r\ncongratulate him on his new mandate. He can rest \r\nassured of Portugal’s full and continued support. \r\n Recognizing the presence in our midst of the \r\nrepresentatives of the Republic of South Sudan, I want \r\nto express our best wishes to the authorities of that new \r\nState in building a peaceful and prosperous future. \r\n Allow me also to reiterate our warmest \r\ncongratulations to the delegation of the Libyan \r\nNational Transitional Council. The Libyan people have \r\ndisplayed exemplary courage and tenacity in defending \r\ntheir freedom and right to democratically chart their \r\nown destiny without fear. The new Libya can continue \r\nto count on Portugal. \r\n Ten years have passed since the terrorist attacks \r\nof 11 September 2001. I want to pay tribute, here in \r\nNew York, to the people and authorities of the United \r\nStates, and to praise their courage and determination in \r\nfacing and overcoming this tragedy. Upholding our \r\nspirit of solidarity, we remain fully engaged in fighting \r\nthe scourge of terrorism and in reaching an agreement \r\non a United Nations global counter-terrorism treaty as \r\nsoon as possible. \r\n A/66/PV.22\r\n \r\n57 11-51360 \r\n \r\n Camões, the Portuguese poet of the sixteenth-\r\ncentury maritime discoveries, said that “the world is \r\nmade of change, assuming always new qualities”. \r\nIdentifying the world of change and its new qualities is \r\nan ongoing challenge that we have to face and respond \r\nto. We live in a historic time of change and multiple \r\nand intertwined challenges, qualities and opportunities. \r\n In our ever-changing world, we now face a \r\nmassive challenge that requires an urgent collective \r\nanswer: the relaunching of growth and employment. \r\nThe economic and financial crisis, which started in the \r\nlast decade, underscores the reality of interdependence \r\nat the global level. Overcoming this crisis in a \r\nsustainable and structured way is a challenge that we \r\nmust meet collectively. \r\n To that end, we must correct macroeconomic \r\ninequalities, strengthen monetary security and \r\nrebalance world trade. Economic growth is a multiplier \r\nfor employment at the national and regional levels, and \r\ndepends for the most part on economic coordination on \r\na global scale. Governments, international \r\norganizations, the private sector and social partners \r\nought to cooperate in a wide-ranging effort to restore \r\nthe confidence of our citizens and companies. \r\nProsperity is more than ever an objective that, if jointly \r\nshared, can be reached by us all. \r\n In the context of the preparations of the report of \r\nthe Secretary-General on global economic governance \r\nto be submitted to the General Assembly, Portugal has \r\nadvocated greater coordination and complementarity \r\nbetween the United Nations, the Group of 20 and \r\nrelevant regional groupings. We have done so because \r\nwe believe it indispensable to promote the involvement \r\nof emerging economies, the private sector and civil \r\nsociety and to enhance their respective roles in global \r\neconomic governance. \r\n The European Union is preparing the foundations \r\nof its economic Government, which is part of the \r\nEuropean integration process. The economic pillar of \r\nthe economic and monetary union is also making good \r\nprogress. That is good news not only for Europe, but \r\nalso for the rest of the world. Portugal is committed to \r\nthis endeavour and to meeting the obligations \r\nundertaken in its economic adjustment programme.  \r\n The Portuguese Government and people are \r\nmaking unprecedented efforts to meet their \r\ncommitments to the International Monetary Fund and \r\nthe European Union. As has been widely recognized, \r\nwe are moving quickly and resolutely to consolidate \r\nour public debt and to implement structural reforms \r\ndesigned to modernize the economy and promote \r\neconomic growth and employment. We view the crisis \r\nas an opportunity to adapt our economic model and to \r\nstrengthen the Portuguese economy. \r\n Last year we asked the General Assembly to \r\nshow its trust in us with regard to our election to the \r\nSecurity Council. This year I want to express our \r\ngratitude for the confidence placed in my country, and \r\nto reiterate Portugal’s firm commitment and attachment \r\nto the values and objectives of the United Nations, as \r\nwell as to the principles that motivated our candidacy. \r\nWe consider the institutional complementarity between \r\nthe General Assembly and the Security Council to be \r\nof the utmost importance, and we believe that the \r\nCouncil should be more effective and more \r\nrepresentative. In the context of United Nations reform, \r\nwe need change; we need to see Brazil and India given \r\npermanent seats on the Council, and Africa should also \r\nbe included in this enlargement. \r\n In this ever-changing world, the indispensable \r\nrole of the United Nations is reflected in the tireless \r\nand courageous work of thousands of its staff members \r\nand collaborators. Men and women in military and \r\npolice uniforms play a fundamental role in peace \r\noperations to protect civilians, prevent the escalation of \r\nconflict and create the necessary space and time for \r\npolitical negotiations to bear fruit. \r\n The Portuguese are deeply proud of participating \r\nin this common effort. Our presence in the field \r\nrepresents one of our main contributions to the \r\nfunctioning of an effective multilateralism. Portuguese \r\nBlue Helmets are deployed in Timor-Leste and \r\nLebanon, and make up one of the largest European \r\ncontingents in United Nations peacekeeping \r\noperations. They are highly professional military and \r\npolice officers who make their country and the United \r\nNations proud. \r\n The year 2011 started not with winter but with \r\nspring. The world, as the poet would say, has found a \r\nnew quality, an opportunity for change created by the \r\ncourage of the Arab peoples who have come together to \r\nmake their voices heard loud and clear, defending, \r\nsometimes at the cost of their own lives, the universal \r\nvalues and aspirations that embody our community of \r\nnations. Democracy and human rights are not relative \r\nA/66/PV.22  \r\n \r\n11-51360 58 \r\n \r\nvalues dependent on geography, ethnicity, faith or \r\neconomic development. \r\n Libya is opening a new chapter in its history — a \r\nnew era of change and reconstruction. The meeting \r\nheld here earlier this week confirmed the commitment \r\nof the international community, led by the United \r\nNations, to supporting the new authorities as they lay \r\nthe groundwork for a democratic, stable, united and \r\nprosperous Libya. This was the welcome spirit that \r\ninspired the Security Council’s unanimous adoption of \r\nresolution 2009 (2011), establishing the United Nations \r\nSupport Mission in Libya. We are determined, both in \r\nthe Council and in the Committee established pursuant \r\nto resolution 1970 (2011) concerning the Libyan Arab \r\nJamahiriya, which we chair, to continue contributing to \r\nthe successful transition in Libya. \r\n We would also like to see success in the Middle \r\nEast peace process. Sixty years have passed and there \r\nis no time left for advances and retreats, the status quo, \r\nor unilateral actions that are prejudicial to negotiations. \r\nThe recipes, principles, concrete formulas and road \r\nmaps are all well known. We do not have to reinvent \r\nthe wheel. Peace may be difficult, but it is within the \r\nreach of Palestine, which already embodies all the \r\ncharacteristics of a State, to which the European Union \r\nhas greatly contributed. Peace in this time of change is \r\nalso within Israel’s reach in the framework of a stable \r\nrelationship and, above all else, security. \r\n The recognition of a new State naturally falls to \r\nthe responsibility of each State Member of this \r\nOrganization. Portugal has backed the concept that the \r\nEuropean Union, through its High Representative, in \r\nthe context of the Quartet and in coordination with \r\nother members of the European Union in the Security \r\nCouncil, has a constructive and decisive role to play in \r\nthis process, which is at a crossroads. Europe can speak \r\nwith one voice to build bridges and facilitate \r\ncompromise. It should be clear that, just as the creation \r\nof a Palestinian State is a promise that must be \r\nhonoured, so, too, the security of Israel must be firmly \r\nguaranteed by the international community. \r\n The President of the Palestinian Authority \r\ndecided to present to the Security Council a request for \r\nPalestine’s admission to the United Nations as a State. \r\nThis step must be the result and logical outcome of \r\nnegotiations. We therefore understand the request to be \r\nan expression of interest that will be fulfilled with the \r\nsigning of a peace agreement ending one of the longest \r\nconflicts of our era. \r\n Until then, we are open to supporting an \r\nenhanced status for Palestine in the United Nations. \r\nThis would be an important step towards the creation \r\nof a new State, and represent an additional commitment \r\nby the Palestinians to the negotiation process, \r\nreinforcing the confidence needed for a definitive and \r\nglobal peace agreement to be reached. Portugal has a \r\nunique sensibility in its dialogue with the Middle East. \r\nWe will use that sensibility and our close relationships \r\nto assist in finding the only result that is of interest to \r\nus all: peace. \r\n The groundbreaking transformation we are \r\nwitnessing in the Arab world has created new \r\nopportunities, first for the peoples of the region, but \r\nalso for countries such as Portugal that have a deep and \r\nhistoric affinity with the southern shore of the \r\nMediterranean and the Gulf region. We are building a \r\ncommon future that involves a new European \r\nneighbourhood policy and a renewed union for the \r\nMediterranean. Our ambition is for a new economic \r\nand commercial relationship, with reinforced \r\nexchanges in the social field and a new democratic \r\nsolidarity, shared in a spirit of mutual respect and \r\nadvantage. \r\n Portugal went through its democratic transition in \r\n1974. We know how important the support and \r\nencouragement of external partners were to us. We are \r\nready and available to share that experience now as a \r\nsign of our support and solidarity. An important \r\nelement of that experience was the contribution and \r\nfull participation, on an equal footing, of Portuguese \r\nwomen to the post-revolutionary political process. \r\n We should remain united in our support for the \r\ntransition processes and reforms under way in the \r\nMiddle East and North Africa, and respond in a \r\ncoordinated manner to the needs identified by our \r\npartners. I naturally think of Egypt and Tunisia, which \r\nare preparing to undertake free and democratic \r\nelections. I am confident that these two countries will \r\nknow how to meet expectations. \r\n We note with profound regret, however, that \r\nmany innocent people in the region are paying too high \r\na price for their legitimate aspirations. The \r\ndisintegration of the situation in Syria is unacceptable \r\nand unsustainable. We welcome the action taken by the \r\nHuman Rights Council, but we believe that the \r\n A/66/PV.22\r\n \r\n59 11-51360 \r\n \r\nSecurity Council should also take a position in this \r\nregard. And we urge the Syrian Government to end the \r\nviolence and the repression of the legitimate \r\ndemocratic aspirations of its people. \r\n The democratic transition under way in the \r\nMiddle East only makes the impasse on the Iranian \r\nnuclear issue more evident. It is imperative that Tehran \r\nunderstand that it is time to change and to cooperate \r\nand that this is in its best interests. \r\n In the face of current global challenges, we need \r\na strong and efficient United Nations that is able to \r\ncooperate closely with other regional and international \r\norganizations, whose scope of action has deepened and \r\nbroadened over recent years. Such cooperation can be \r\ndeepened with the European Union, which only \r\nrecently gained a new legitimacy in the United Nations \r\nwith the adoption of resolution 65/276, which we \r\nwelcome. But such cooperation should also be \r\ndeveloped with other organizations, such as the African \r\nUnion, the League of Arab States and the Community \r\nof Portuguese-speaking Countries. That community of \r\neight nations on four continents, united by a language \r\nspoken by more than 240 million people and counting, \r\nhas a strong vocation to strengthen multilateralism in \r\nthe service of peace, security and democracy. \r\n I would also like to commend the efforts of the \r\nAlliance of Civilizations, a United Nations initiative \r\nthat, under the leadership of a former Portuguese Head \r\nof State, Jorge Sampaio, has contributed greatly to \r\nimproving relations among societies and communities \r\nof different backgrounds and to promoting a culture of \r\ndialogue, tolerance and mutual understanding at the \r\nglobal level. \r\n The United Nations is us all of us. We all have \r\nthe responsibility and duty to preserve global peace \r\nand security and to defend human rights in accordance \r\nwith the Charter. The promotion and protection of \r\nhuman rights, as I have already mentioned, is one of \r\nthe priorities of Portugal’s foreign policy, in line with \r\nthe other values expressed in the United Nations \r\nCharter. We take an active position in this field, \r\ndenouncing situations where civil and political rights \r\nare being violated and recognizing the social \r\naspirations of the neediest and most vulnerable  \r\n \r\npopulations of our planet, as reflected in our initiatives \r\non economic, social and cultural rights. \r\n I would also like to emphasize the importance we \r\nattach to the promotion and protection of the rights of \r\nthe child, as well as the human rights of women, \r\nincluding their participation in political decision-\r\nmaking. That position is the outgrowth of a broad \r\nconsensus about and great interest in human rights in \r\nour country. It is no coincidence that the United \r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees and two \r\nother important United Nations human rights \r\nofficials — the Special Representative of the \r\nSecretary-General for Violence against Children and \r\nthe Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe \r\ndrinking water and sanitation, both of them women — \r\nare Portuguese. \r\n It is in that spirit that we decided to present our \r\ncandidature for the Human Rights Council for the \r\nbiennium 2015-2017. We participated actively in the \r\ncreation of that organ, of which we have not yet been a \r\nmember. We are convinced that our participation in that \r\nbody would serve as a bulwark in the defence of our \r\nshared principles. \r\n Allow me to conclude by reiterating and \r\nemphasizing Portugal’s commitment to international \r\nlaw and to the peaceful resolution of conflicts, values \r\nthat guide our actions in and out of the Security \r\nCouncil, the other organs of the United Nations, \r\ninternational organizations and our bilateral relations. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Portugal for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Pedro Passos Coelho, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Portugal, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\n  The meeting rose at 3:15 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
