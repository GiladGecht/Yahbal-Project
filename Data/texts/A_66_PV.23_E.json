(Qatar) \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 3.25 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 8 (continued) \r\n \r\nGeneral debate \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. José Maria Pereira Neves, \r\nPrime Minister and Minister of Reform of the \r\nRepublic of Cape Verde \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the Prime Minister and Minister of Reform \r\nof the Republic of Cape Verde. \r\n Mr. José Maria Pereira Neves, Prime Minister \r\nand Minister of Reform of the Republic of Cape \r\nVerde, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. José Maria Pereira \r\nNeves, Prime Minister and Minister of Reform of the \r\nRepublic of Cape Verde, and inviting him to address \r\nthe General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Pereira Neves (Cape Verde) (spoke in Cape \r\nVerdean; English text provided by the delegation): It is \r\na great honour to participate in the General Assembly \r\nand a great privilege to greet Members on behalf of the \r\npeople and the Government of Cape Verde.  \r\n I address the Assembly in the Cape Verdean \r\nlanguage, the Creole of Cape Verde. I believe this is \r\nthe first time Cape Verdean Creole is used in United \r\nNations General Assembly. I do it to share with the \r\nAssembly this piece of authentic world heritage, born \r\non the threshold of the fifteenth century. Linguistic \r\nexperts consider it the oldest Creole of Euro-African \r\norigin and the oldest within the Atlantic context.  \r\n I use it also because language is culture, history \r\nand memory. All languages are expressions of \r\nthoughts, knowledge and practices. Languages are no \r\ndoubt an expression of civilization. Therefore, \r\nspeaking in the Creole of Cape Verde, in this most \r\nimportant Hall, at a meeting of heads of State and \r\nGovernment, is a reference to our conviction that the \r\nCreole identity is of anthropological value for all \r\nhumanity. It is a way of highlighting our Cape \r\nVerdeanship: our soul and the way of being, the ethos \r\nand pathos of Cape Verde, which is the result of the \r\nintersection of various peoples of the world. The \r\nlanguage is, in and of itself, a synthesis of the meeting \r\nof civilizations. By using it, I also pay vibrant tribute \r\nto Aristides Pereira, the first President of Cape Verde \r\nand a great African fighter for freedom and human \r\ndignity, who recently passed away. \r\n The central theme of this Assembly session — the \r\nrole of mediation in the settlement of disputes by \r\npeaceful means — is a crucial and imperative theme \r\nfor the world. It reflects the identity, the way of being \r\nand lifestyle of Cape Verdeans. As subscribers to the \r\npurposes and principles of the United Nations, we \r\nbelieve that peace and human rights are the key factors \r\nin the construction of sovereignty, democratic rule of \r\nlaw and sustainable development. Therefore, mediators \r\nare required to position and approach matters within \r\nthe universal matrix of peace and human rights as the \r\nhighest priorities of all States Members of the United \r\nNations.  \r\nA/66/PV.23  \r\n \r\n11-51372 2 \r\n \r\n In addition, we consider it crucial to take an \r\napproach focused on the prevention and control of \r\nnon-communicable diseases worldwide, especially in \r\nthe context of the challenges faced by developing \r\ncountries. \r\n Let me offer a few special words regarding the \r\ndevelopment of themes such as desertification, land \r\ndegradation and drought in the context of sustainable \r\ndevelopment and poverty eradication in preparation for \r\nthe United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, scheduled for June 2012, which we \r\nstrongly and actively support.  \r\n One of the most decisive actions taken by \r\nindependent Cape Verde, soon after 1975, was \r\nreforestation, along with orographic correction and the \r\nmobilization of water. As a small island developing \r\nState at the crossroads of two large regions — the \r\nSahel and Macaronesia — and suffering the effects of \r\nthe most stringent climatic randomness of one region \r\nand the oceanic isolation of the other, Cape Verde is \r\nconscious of the importance of the green as well as the \r\nblue economy to the objective of sustainable \r\ndevelopment.  \r\n We need the United Nations to work out our part \r\nin preventing climate change and food and water \r\nshortages. We count on the United Nations and all \r\ncountries of this great General Assembly to converge \r\nboth bilaterally and multilaterally towards the green \r\neconomy and sustainable development. Therefore, in \r\nCape Verde there is an ongoing and ambitious \r\nprogramme for covering 50 per cent of national energy \r\nneeds through renewable sources by 2020. \r\n Despite remarkable and positive changes — some \r\nof which have been internationally recognized, such as \r\nour graduation to middle-income country status and \r\nbeing on the path towards full achievement of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals — I would still like to \r\ntake this opportunity to better acquaint the General \r\nAssembly with my country. \r\n Cape Verde, with its ten islands in the middle of \r\nthe Atlantic, strategically positioned in the corridor and \r\nthe cross-Atlantic flow, is not only a strong partner for \r\nglobal security, geostrategic interests and world trade, \r\nbut is also an active and useful member of the \r\ninternational community in the fight against trafficking \r\nand related crime. The vast oceanic region of Cape \r\nVerde is an important space for security in the \r\npromotion of regional peace and prosperity and in the \r\naffirmation of an international coalition to fight illicit \r\ntransnational crime. \r\n Some may wonder, “What country is this?” Some \r\nthink of it as the nation of Amilcar Cabral; others see it \r\nas the country of Cesaria Evora. Cape Verde is a land \r\nthat was once an important entrepôt and trans-shipment \r\nbase for the African slave trade, for both Europe and \r\nthe Americas. Its oldest city — Ribeira Grande, or the \r\nCidade Velha — was named a World Heritage by \r\nUNESCO in 2009. \r\n Cape Verde is a State that encourages other States \r\nto remember, through memory, history and human \r\nrights, the international slave routes, just as we \r\nremember the Holocaust, another of the heights of \r\nhuman barbarism. In Cape Verde we can defy our \r\nlusophone partners in the Community of Portuguese-\r\nspeaking Countries and our African partners and the \r\nentire world to reaffirm our commitment against \r\nbarbarism, dictatorship, colonialism and disrespect for \r\nhuman rights through the promotion of the candidacy \r\nof the Tarrafal concentration camp on the island of \r\nSantiago as a World Heritage site. \r\n Those who know us know that we are a country \r\nconcerned with development. We do not settle for \r\nbeing middle-income country. We need the partnership \r\nwith the international community to fulfil our destiny. \r\n In Cape Verde’s transformational agenda, we \r\nhave identified five pillars of our country’s growth and \r\npoverty reduction strategy: promotion of effective \r\ngovernance, strengthening human development, \r\nconfronting the structural and social challenges arising \r\nfrom competitiveness, and investment in infrastructure \r\nfor improving social cohesion. \r\n Cape Verde is developing a foreign policy that \r\nfavours democracy, justice, peace, cooperation and \r\nsustainable development. We look at the planet as the \r\nhome of all, respecting the sovereignty and will of the \r\npeople while emphasizing the global convergence in \r\nthe core of humankind. We are therefore concerned \r\nabout hunger in the Horn of Africa. We are concerned \r\nthat thousands of children die in Africa every day from \r\nhunger. I am concerned that that does not motivate a \r\nstronger international intervention, since the \r\ndictatorship of hunger is the worst of dictatorships.  \r\n We urge the United Nations to be more effective \r\nand to make a concerted effort to reverse the image of \r\nthat human tragedy in East Africa. We must therefore \r\n A/66/PV.23\r\n \r\n3 11-51372 \r\n \r\neradicate the geopolitics of hunger. We all need to take \r\nthe paradigm of zero hunger in the world. \r\n We are also concerned about wars and tensions \r\nthat thrive a little everywhere but are now more \r\nlocalized and of more intense in Africa, the Middle \r\nEast and Asia — to the delight of the dealers in misery, \r\nthose who invest in the war industry and in the \r\nsuffering of millions of human beings, especially \r\nchildren, women and the elderly. We must reach a \r\nglobal consensus that security, peace and stability arise \r\nfrom the economic and social development of States \r\nand peoples. We must deconstruct war, conflict and \r\ntension between countries and peoples and ensure the \r\ncommitment of the sixty-sixth session of the General \r\nAssembly towards that noble goal. We must reiterate \r\nthat mediation is essential to settle disputes, whether in \r\nAfrica or in the rest of the world. \r\n The global economic crisis is acute. In large \r\ncountries it shows signs of settling and in poor \r\ncountries it is amplified. If the crisis is global, it \r\nrequires global responses against recessionary policies, \r\nsuch as the protection of domestic markets, and the war \r\nagainst unfairly priced imports. It also requires global \r\npositions that converge towards social inclusion as a \r\nway to reduce the impact of the economic crisis. \r\n We reiterate our firm position of respect for \r\ninternational laws, the principles of non-interference in \r\ninternal affairs and the sovereignty of peoples and \r\nnations. We do not support double standards for similar \r\ncases, as if peoples and nations were not equal and \r\ndeserving of the same treatment, as stated in the United \r\nNations Charter. \r\n Before concluding, I must emphasize our position \r\nin favour of expanding the reform model of global \r\ngovernance by the United Nations, allowing, among \r\nthe many benefits, small States to have a greater voice \r\nin the decision-making process of the international \r\nsystem. Cape Verde unequivocally supports an increase \r\nin the number of permanent members of the Security \r\nCouncil, in the belief that the world is no longer as it \r\nwas at the end of the Second World War, nor does it \r\nresemble that of the end of the Cold War. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister and \r\nMinister of Reform of the Republic of Cape Verde for \r\nthe statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. José Maria Pereira Neves, Prime Minister \r\nand Minister of Reform of the Republic of Cape \r\nVerde, was escorted from the rostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Peter O’Neill, Prime Minister of \r\nPapua New Guinea \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea. \r\n Mr. Peter O’Neill, Prime Minister of Papua New \r\nGuinea, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Peter O’Neill, Prime \r\nMinister of Papua New Guinea, and inviting him to \r\naddress the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. O’Neill (Papua New Guinea): Mr. President, \r\nallow me, on behalf of the Government and people of \r\nPapua New Guinea, to offer our warmest \r\ncongratulations on your assumption of the presidency \r\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. We \r\npledge support for your statement highlighting the \r\nsuccess of global endeavours that are founded on the \r\nprinciples of partnership, justice and responsibility. I \r\nalso thank your predecessor, Mr. Joseph Diess, for his \r\ninvaluable contributions to the United Nations, and I \r\nwish him well.  \r\n I also wish to congratulate the Secretary-General, \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, on his \r\nreappointment for a second term, and to thank him for \r\nattending our recent annual Pacific Islands Leaders \r\nMeeting in Auckland, New Zealand. His attendance at \r\nour regional meeting was the first by a United Nations \r\nSecretary-General and is testament to the strengthening \r\nties between the United Nations and the Pacific region. \r\nWe particularly note his heartfelt comments when \r\ndescribing his experiences on witnessing the adverse \r\neffects of climate change on low-lying atolls in the \r\nRepublic of Kiribati and the various other development \r\nchallenges faced by many small island States in our \r\nregion. \r\n Allow me, like other speakers, to take this \r\nopportunity to welcome our newest member of the \r\nUnited Nations family — the Republic of South Sudan. \r\n Papua New Guinea continues to benefit from a \r\nstrong United Nations presence through its delivery of \r\nvarious development programmes. Papua New Guinea \r\nwelcomed and formalized the “One United Nations \r\nInitiative: delivering as one” concept in 2006. That has \r\nA/66/PV.23  \r\n \r\n11-51372 4 \r\n \r\nunified all the efforts of the various United Nations \r\nagencies under one budgetary framework, monitoring \r\nand evaluation process. \r\n The concept will enable a more effective and \r\nefficient way for the United Nations to deliver on its \r\nmandate, particularly the new country programme for \r\nPapua New Guinea, to be rolled out at the beginning of \r\nJanuary 2012. It will target the areas of governance, \r\nsocial justice, health, education, gender, the \r\nenvironment, climate change and disaster management.  \r\n That new country programme is part of our \r\noverall efforts to achieve the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs). Since the inaugural MDG report was \r\npublished in 2004, Papua New Guinea has produced \r\ntwo MDG progress reports. The first, in 2009, was a \r\nsummary report and the second, in 2010, a \r\ncomprehensive report. They showed that we have been \r\nable to achieve some of the national MDG targets, \r\nespecially on poverty reduction and child mortality. \r\n In terms of universal primary education, Papua \r\nNew Guinea is progressing well, with the enrolment of \r\nchildren in grades one to six increasing significantly — \r\nby 53 per cent. That is a marked improvement and will \r\nincrease the literacy rate in the long term. Our \r\nGovernment recently announced a policy of free \r\neducation from the elementary level to year 10 and \r\nsubsidized education from grade 11 to university, \r\ncommencing 2012. \r\n We are also revamping our national health system \r\nto improve immunization programmes, to provide a \r\nclean and safer water supply, to centralize the purchase \r\nand supply of medical drugs, and to reduce maternal \r\nand child mortality and the incidence of malaria, \r\nHIV/AIDS and other communicable diseases. The \r\nrecent important summit on non-communicable \r\ndiseases, attended by our Minister for Health, \r\nreiterated our equal responsibility for our own, our \r\nfamilies’ and our communities’ health and well-being. \r\n Our Government remains committed to achieving \r\nthe MDGs, and we are now scaling up progress in all \r\nrelevant sectors. Our new Development Strategic Plan \r\n2010-2030 and Medium Term Development Plan aim \r\nto develop and foster key enabling environments, \r\nwhich will raise Papua New Guinea to a middle-\r\nincome country and improve its Human Development \r\nIndex ranking. \r\n We call on all our development partners to \r\ncomplement our efforts to achieve the MDG targets in \r\nline with our national development plans and policies. I \r\nbelieve other developing countries will support our \r\ncall. \r\n We are also investing heavily in the rehabilitation \r\nof our major transport infrastructure, including roads, \r\nairports and seaports. Aside from that, we are also \r\nrolling out rural communication systems and rural \r\nelectrification. As we are all aware, improved \r\ninfrastructure will enable effective service delivery. \r\n Women play critical roles in all facets of our \r\ndevelopment. Our Government is conscious of the need \r\nto have more women participate actively in the affairs \r\nof state and in the economic life of our country. I am \r\npleased to report that we have recently passed the first \r\nvote on a parliamentary bill that will provide for \r\n22 seats reserved for women to contest in the coming \r\nelections in 2012. That provision does not stop them \r\nfrom contesting any of the existing seats. \r\n We also appreciate the push by multilateral \r\npartners like the Asian Development Bank and the \r\nWorld Bank for gender equality. In the same breath, \r\nhowever, we urge them to support our financial \r\ninstitutions by specifically allocating funds without \r\nrisk to be lent to women entrepreneurs to develop \r\nbusiness opportunities. \r\n We note the recently adopted San Francisco \r\nDeclaration by the countries member of the Asia-\r\nPacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) last week, \r\nunder the leadership of the United States of America. \r\nThat is a major step forward in supporting women in \r\nbusiness and is a powerful tool for women of the APEC \r\nmember countries. We will encourage our women in \r\nPapua New Guinea to take advantage of the \r\nopportunities created by that Declaration. \r\n There remain many other global challenges that \r\ncontinue to affect the development aspirations of many \r\nof our countries. One is nuclear non-proliferation. The \r\nPacific remains a nuclear-weapons-free zone. We call \r\nupon other Member States who are not yet signatories \r\nto sign and ratify the Rarotonga Treaty. \r\n The illegal use, abuse and the dangerous \r\nproliferation of small arms and light weapons continue \r\nto hamper the development aspirations of many \r\ndeveloping countries. We therefore call upon the \r\ninternational community to deal seriously with \r\n A/66/PV.23\r\n \r\n5 11-51372 \r\n \r\noutstanding issues such as the illegal supply of and \r\ntrade in small arms. Our Government will do all it can \r\nto accelerate the implementation of the \r\nrecommendations in our own Gun Summit Report. \r\n On transnational crime, Papua New Guinea \r\nremains committed to working closely with other \r\nGovernments and relevant international law \r\nenforcement agencies to curb drug trafficking, human \r\ntrafficking and money-laundering. \r\n As one of the top five remaining rainforest \r\nnations, we are committed to addressing the many \r\nchallenges of climate change, biodiversity and \r\nsustainable development of our forests. We continue to \r\nmaintain dialogue with all stakeholders, being mindful \r\nthat issues confronting many nations on climate change \r\nare very complex. \r\n In the matter of United Nations reform, we \r\nsupport and encourage the reform of the United \r\nNations, its agencies and its Secretariat, to make them \r\nmore responsive to and active in responding to global, \r\nregional and national challenges. We reiterate our call \r\nfor an expansion of membership in the permanent and \r\nnon-permanent categories of the Security Council, \r\nwhich must take into account the geopolitical realities \r\nof today’s world. \r\n In terms of our contribution to the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security, I am pleased to \r\nannounce the deployment of our uniformed personnel \r\nas military observers. That is history in the making for \r\nour country, and we thank the United Nations for \r\ngiving us the opportunity for our security personnel to \r\nparticipate in international peacekeeping duties. \r\n On regional issues, tuna is an important source of \r\nfood and is, along with tourism, an economic resource \r\nfor the Pacific island States. Papua New Guinea and \r\ncountries that are parties to the Nauru Agreement are \r\ndetermined to process tuna onshore to add value and \r\ncreate employment for our people. We encourage \r\ninvestors to invest in onshore activities. \r\n At the Pacific regional level, we are conscious of \r\nour obligation to conserve fisheries through sustainable \r\nfishing. The parties to the Nauru Agreement have \r\nintroduced the Vessel Day Scheme to limit the total \r\ncatch for conservation purposes. In addition, Papua \r\nNew Guinea continues to make funds available to the \r\nSouth Pacific community to tag tuna species so that we \r\nare can quantify and assess the tuna stocks for the \r\nfuture. \r\n Over the past nine years, Papua New Guinea has \r\ncontinued to experience unprecedented economic \r\ngrowth levels of 6 to 8 per cent per annum. That has \r\nbeen largely attributable to significant increases in \r\nforeign investments in our mineral and hydrocarbon \r\nsectors and to the high prices of our agricultural \r\ncommodities. Those economic growth levels have \r\npositioned Papua New Guinea to become a significant \r\ndevelopment partner within our region. \r\n Papua New Guinea greatly values the objectives \r\nand principles of the United Nations Charter. We \r\nreaffirm our support for the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security, the development of \r\nfriendly relations among nations and working together \r\ntowards the achievement of the aspirations of all of our \r\npeoples. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly I wish to thank the Prime Minister of Papua \r\nNew Guinea for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Peter O’Neill, Prime Minister of Papua New \r\nGuinea, was escorted from the rostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi, \r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nand Trade of the Independent State of Samoa \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear a \r\nstatement by the Prime Minister and Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs and Trade of the Independent State of \r\nSamoa. \r\n Mr. Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi, Prime Minister \r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of the \r\nIndependent State of Samoa, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum. \r\n The President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Tuilaepa Sailele \r\nMalielegaoi, Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs and Trade of the Independent State of Samoa, \r\nand inviting him to address the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Malielegaoi (Samoa): Samoa joined the \r\nUnited Nations 35 years ago, a decision rooted firmly \r\nin our belief in the principle of the sovereign equality \r\nof all Member States, each with the same rights and \r\nresponsibilities. That sentiment underpins our \r\nA/66/PV.23  \r\n \r\n11-51372 6 \r\n \r\nrelationship with our Organization as it evolves into a \r\nglobal family of interdependent nations. \r\n The Organization remains one of the last, if not \r\nthe greatest, bastion against the serious challenges and \r\nuncertainties that beset our world — financial and \r\neconomic crises, climate change, environmental \r\ndegradation, land desertification, ocean acidification, \r\ndestruction of fishery resources, endemic poverty and \r\ndangerous threats to peace and security. That is why we \r\ncontinue to support the United Nations and look to its \r\ntimely interventions and leadership in addressing the \r\nchallenges the world faces and finding collective \r\nsolutions to them. \r\n It is in the context of the leadership role of the \r\nUnited Nations that the visit of Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon earlier this month to the Pacific region as a \r\nspecial guest of the Pacific Leaders Forum in New \r\nZealand was particularly significant. The visit enabled \r\nthe Secretary-General to see first-hand the scale of the \r\nchallenges facing vulnerable Pacific small island \r\ncountries. The visit, the first ever to the Pacific by an \r\nincumbent Secretary-General in the 66 years of \r\nexistence of the United Nations, was a historical \r\nmilestone in the relationship between the Pacific region \r\nand the United Nations. The fact that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral is from the Asia-Pacific region and that the \r\nvisit took place before the start of his second term, not \r\nat the end of it, are positive aspects that were not lost \r\non the Pacific leaders. Mr. Ban Ki-moon’s advocacy \r\nand support of Pacific issues in the different \r\ninternational forums dealing with sustainable \r\ndevelopment, climate change and peace and security, as \r\nwe witnessed on Wednesday when he presented his \r\nreport to the General Assembly, will be invaluable in \r\nplacing Pacific concerns at centre stage for attention \r\nand support where needed. \r\n The United Nations is the world’s premier \r\nOrganization. Its role in the various areas of \r\ndevelopment and in improving the human condition \r\nmust be exemplary and unequivocal. The work and \r\ninfluence of the United Nations to encourage \r\nGovernments to respect and uphold fundamental \r\nhuman rights is sorely needed in parts of our Pacific \r\nregion and across the world. \r\n In our region as well, the work of the United \r\nNations to facilitate the choices of Pacific peoples to \r\nexercise their right to self-determination continues to \r\nform an important part of our Pacific region’s \r\nassociation with the United Nations. In this respect, we \r\nstrongly urge the United Nations to play a more \r\nproactive role towards the achievement of this goal. \r\n Development, security and human rights are \r\nmutually reinforcing pillars of the United Nations. \r\nEqual progress on all three fronts should be the norm, \r\nnot the exception. A decade into the new millennium, \r\nwe find the Assembly meeting against the backdrop of \r\na world teetering on many fronts and replete with \r\nuncertainties. \r\n A full recovery of the global economy to \r\npre-2008 levels continues to be an elusive goal. The \r\nimmediate to medium-term outlook is not promising \r\nand does not instil confidence. While some \r\nGovernments are being assisted with their budgetary \r\ndifficulties, others, in contrast, are struggling on their \r\nown to provide the basic necessities for their people. \r\nAchieving the time-bound Millennium Development \r\nGoals in their totality is becoming difficult by the day. \r\n In terms of crises, be it economic, climate change \r\nor food-related, the most and worst affected by any one \r\nof these are, without exception, some of the United \r\nNations — recognized vulnerable groups — the least \r\ndeveloped countries and the small island developing \r\nStates. Samoa belongs to both categories. Though the \r\nUnited Nations has committed, through internationally \r\nagreed development frameworks such as the Brussels \r\nProgramme of Action, the Barbados Programme of \r\nAction and others, to help vulnerable economies attain \r\neconomic growth, sustainable development and the \r\nresilience to endure external shocks, the reality is that \r\nthe needs of these groups always outstrip the resources \r\navailable to them. This mismatch is due in part to \r\nundercapitalized frameworks with no dedicated \r\nfunding. \r\n Earlier this week, the United Nations focused \r\nlong-overdue attention on the insidious health threat \r\nposed by non-communicable diseases (NCDs). If left \r\nunchecked, NCDs will not only devastate the health of \r\nour people but also have the potential to wreak havoc \r\nin our economies, with the incidence of these so-called \r\nlifestyle diseases having a heavy impact on the \r\nproductive population. Samoa therefore adds its voice \r\nto the call to include the reduction of non-communicable \r\ndiseases in the Millennium Development Goals and \r\nwhich sufficient resources and donor partnership \r\nactions should also prioritize. \r\n A/66/PV.23\r\n \r\n7 11-51372 \r\n \r\n These are real concerns. Sustainable economic \r\ndevelopment is a priority issue for Samoa and the \r\nPacific island countries. This is why we are hopeful \r\nthat the United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (Rio+20), to be held next June in Brazil, \r\nwill allow for a serious discussion and reorientation of \r\nthe whole United Nations community on the \r\nimportance of identifying and providing the necessary \r\nresources for the implementation of the agreed \r\nprogrammes of action and other global arrangements \r\nthat the United Nations underwrites. \r\n The theme of this year’s Pacific Forum was \r\n“Converting potential into prosperity”. In line with this \r\nis the advocacy led by the Pacific countries to raise the \r\nprofile of the oceans agenda towards a strong “blue \r\neconomy” outcome, to ensure that the importance of \r\nthe oceans to our islands is captured as an integral \r\ncomponent of the Rio+20 outcome. The ocean provides \r\nthe Pacific region with opportunities and challenges, \r\nbest reflected in the four-pronged focus on \r\nconservation, sustainable management, balanced \r\nharvesting and greater economic return from the \r\nutilization of fishery and marine resources. \r\n The emphasis of efforts on maximizing economic \r\nbenefits from fisheries is a recognition of its vital \r\ncontribution in supporting sustainable economic \r\ndevelopment and attempts to address the long-held \r\nconcern of Pacific islands that they have been for far \r\ntoo long short-changed and unfairly compensated for \r\nthe fishery resources found within our waters, which \r\nare worth many billions of dollars, with less than 1 per \r\ncent received by the island countries. \r\n The Pacific States have long been committed to \r\nefforts to conserve and manage fisheries resources in \r\nthe region. It has therefore also been a point of long-\r\nstanding frustration that vessels of major fishing \r\nnations continue to fish illegally in Pacific waters. \r\nEven when they are caught carrying out illegal fishing \r\nactivities, it is by no means a certainty that prosecution \r\nand enforcement of penalties will be successful, when \r\ninfringing fishing vessels have heavy financial \r\nresources backing their defences. \r\n We therefore again urge cooperation from all \r\nnations with fishing fleets in the Pacific to work \r\ntogether with our Pacific countries to stop illegal, \r\nunreported and unregulated fishing practices in the \r\nPacific. The Pacific carries the last major stocks of \r\nsome key fish species that in other oceans have already \r\nbeen depleted, contaminated and devastated. \r\nSuccessful conservation and the effective management \r\nof harvest levels in the long term is absolutely critical, \r\nnot just for Pacific countries and distant-water fishing \r\nnations, but, ultimately, the availability of fish supplies \r\nto the rest of the world in the years ahead. The \r\nsuccessful conservation and management of fish stocks \r\nin the Pacific is, pure and simple, good business for \r\neveryone. \r\n Climate change was again singled out by Pacific \r\nleaders during their just-concluded summit as the \r\nsingle greatest threat to the livelihoods, security and \r\nwell-being of the peoples of the Pacific. Natural \r\ncatastrophes are capable of destruction that devastates \r\nentire communities. From the tragic experiences that \r\nour country has endured, we know of the great pain \r\nfrom the loss of lives, the destruction of property and \r\nthe setback to the national economy that disasters are \r\ncapable of inflicting. \r\n It is therefore imperative that adequate resources \r\nbe available and that they may, indeed, be accessed \r\nwith ease through different direct modalities in order to \r\nassist countries in meeting their mitigation and \r\nadaptation programmes. The Copenhagen Green \r\nClimate Fund is now in the design phase. The \r\nrepresentatives of Governments and experts involved \r\nwould do well to pay attention to the existing climate \r\nchange funding architecture so that the shortcomings of \r\nother funding mechanisms are not repeated. \r\n Without the necessary financial resources and \r\ntechnical support, Samoa’s ability to adapt to and \r\nmitigate climate change will be severely curtailed. \r\nThankfully, Samoa continues to benefit under the fast \r\nstart finance window, both bilaterally and through \r\nregional projects made available by the generous \r\nsupport of our traditional and new development \r\npartners, such as Australia, China, the European Union, \r\nJapan, New Zealand, Italy, the Asian Development \r\nBank, the Global Environment Facility, the World Bank \r\nand the United Nations, to name but a few. We are, \r\nindeed, very, very grateful. \r\n Countries in different parts of the world look to \r\nthe United Nations and its stronger members for \r\npeacekeeping arrangements to give those communities \r\nin strife time to re-establish and to find lasting \r\nsolutions. Samoa continues to lend its unwavering \r\nsupport to that aspect of the United Nations mandate. I \r\nreaffirm that support, which is underpinned by my \r\nA/66/PV.23  \r\n \r\n11-51372 8 \r\n \r\ncountry’s contribution and the involvement of our \r\npolice officers in the United Nations peacekeeping \r\noperations in the Sudan, Liberia and Timor-Leste. \r\nAdditionally, Samoa continues to be an integral part of \r\nthe Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands \r\nunder the umbrella of the Pacific Forum. \r\n Samoa warmly welcomes the admission of South \r\nSudan as the United Nation’s newest member in July \r\nthis year. \r\n Samoa joins the international community’s \r\nsupport for the courage of the people of Tunisia, Egypt, \r\nLibya and now Syria in seeking relief from oppression \r\nand in gaining the freedoms and human rights to which \r\nthey are rightly entitled. \r\n At this rostrum a year ago, I did not expect the \r\nArab spring, and spoke in earnest of the hope that \r\nprogress would come in the then historic process to \r\nbring permanent peace to the peoples of Israel and \r\nPalestine (see A/65/PV.19). It is our long-held \r\nconviction that an independent Palestinian nation, \r\ntaking its rightful place in our global family and living \r\nside by side with a secure Israel, is the only road to \r\npermanent peace. However, while we all know that that \r\nis the sensible outcome that must be achieved, it will \r\nsadly remain elusive without a clear sense of \r\ncommitment and willingness by both sides to negotiate \r\nin good faith. \r\n For genuine and permanent peace between \r\nPalestine and the State of Israel, there must be direct \r\nnegotiations between the two countries. Addressing the \r\nsymptoms, but not the root causes of the conflict is \r\nshort-sighted and the result unsustainable. Solutions \r\nmust be decided by the two parties, not imposed from \r\noutside. Without that strong buy-in from the Israelis \r\nand Palestinians themselves, any solutions will, at best, \r\nbe short-lived. More than ever, visionary leadership, on \r\nboth sides, that sees beyond the immediate dictates of \r\nshort-sighted interests and that is, instead, willing to \r\nseize the opportunity to fashion a just and durable \r\npeace settlement, is critically needed at this point. \r\n Terrorism, in its various forms and \r\nmanifestations, is responsible for the horror and fear \r\nthat have continued to grip the world’s attention. No \r\ncountry is immune from the reaches of terrorism, and \r\nwe are all affected to varying degrees. Terrorist acts \r\ncommitted under whatever pretext or purpose can \r\nnever be justified as morally acceptable. Equally, \r\ncountering terrorism does not confer immunity from \r\nthe rule of law, nor the abandonment of the principles \r\nof a civilized society. \r\n No country can win the war against terrorism on \r\nits own. Only by pooling our resources and working \r\ncollaboratively with each other can we stand a chance \r\nof defeating that senseless menace. Samoa, despite the \r\nheavy cost, is doing its best to meet our obligations in \r\nthat collective effort. \r\n Modest progress has been achieved in the efforts \r\nto reform the Security Council. Samoa remains \r\nconvinced that an expanded Security Council that \r\nmirrors present-day realities is essential for \r\nmultilateralism and for the Council’s integrity and \r\ncredibility. Increases in both the permanent and the \r\nnon-permanent categories should be part and parcel of \r\nthe reform package. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister and \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of the \r\nIndependent State of Samoa for the statement he has \r\njust made. \r\n Mr. Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi, Prime Minister \r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of the \r\nIndependent State of Samoa, was escorted from \r\nthe rostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Meltek Sato Kilman \r\nLivtunvanu, Prime Minister of the Republic  \r\nof Vanuatu \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the Prime Minister of the Republic of \r\nVanuatu. \r\n Mr. Meltek Sato Kilman Livtunvanu, Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Vanuatu, was escorted \r\nto the rostrum. \r\n The President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Meltek Sato Kilman \r\nLivtunvanu, Prime Minister of the Republic of \r\nVanuatu, and inviting him to address the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n Mr. Kilman (Vanuatu): Vanuatu joins other \r\ndelegations in congratulating you, Mr. President, on \r\nyour election to preside over the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-sixth session. My delegation vows our full \r\ncooperation, and believes that, with your leadership, \r\nwe will conclude a successful session. \r\n A/66/PV.23\r\n \r\n9 11-51372 \r\n \r\n Allow me to also acknowledge the leadership of \r\nyour predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss, for \r\nhis exceptional guidance and for the considerable and \r\nimportant achievements of the previous Assembly \r\nsession. \r\n In the same spirit, on behalf of my Government, I \r\ntake this opportunity to congratulate His Excellency \r\nBan Ki-moon on his re-election to the post of \r\nSecretary-General and to commend him on his vision, \r\nleadership and tireless efforts in moving towards \r\nachieving the common interests of all humanity. \r\n I would also like to take this opportunity to \r\ncongratulate the Government and the people of the \r\nRepublic of South Sudan on the birth of their new \r\nnation on 9 July. Vanuatu recognizes the sovereignty of \r\nSouth Sudan, and offers the young nation our full \r\nsupport.  \r\n The theme of this year’s General Assembly \r\nsession, “The role of mediation in the settlement of \r\ndisputes by peaceful means”, calls for more creative \r\nand feasible peaceful multilateral solutions to many of \r\nour long-standing disputes that, unless resolved \r\npeacefully, will have far more extensive global \r\nconsequences. The settlement of disputes by peaceful \r\nmeans is central to the United Nations system, as \r\nenshrined in the United Nations Charter and in \r\nnumerous international conventions and treaties. In that \r\ncontext, we, like many others, encourage our brothers \r\nand sisters in Israel and Palestine to continue the \r\npeaceful negotiations that will ensure regional and \r\nglobal stability. We also call upon the United Nations \r\nto visit the framework with which it fulfils its \r\nmediation mandates and to develop closer partnerships \r\nwith mediation actors within regional groups. To \r\nsucceed as responsible nations of this global village, \r\nwe must continue to cultivate an environment that \r\nthwarts the seeds of bitterness, hatred and vengeance. \r\n In establishing the United Nations in 1945, many \r\nnations, great and small, entrusted it with the \r\nresponsibility to assist in maintaining international \r\npeace and security, developing friendly relations \r\namong nations, and promoting social progress, better \r\nliving standards and human rights. However, 66 years \r\nafter the founding of this multilateral Organization, the \r\nworld that we live in is far from the ideals for which its \r\ninception was intended. Across the globe, people from \r\nall walks of life continue to be subject to colonial rule, \r\ndeath threats, arbitrary detention, torture and worse, \r\nand are killed for exercising their rights to freedom of \r\nexpression. Untold crimes against humanity and other \r\nhuman rights atrocities still continue. \r\n While we reaffirm our faith in multilateralism, \r\nwith the conviction that bilateral diplomacy cannot \r\nsubstitute for multilateralism, we also believe that our \r\nnations have a greater need of a more robust \r\nmultilateral system that is swift and efficient in \r\nresponding to the multitude of challenges that members \r\nof this highly esteemed system, acting unilaterally, \r\nwould be hard done to defeat. We are delighted to note \r\nthat one of the four priorities of the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-sixth session is to \r\ncontinue the work on the reforms within the United \r\nNations. \r\n In that context, this year’s establishment of the \r\nChange Management Team within the Organization, in \r\nparticular, is a step in the right direction. That initiative \r\ncomes at a time when members of this body are calling \r\non the United Nations to play a more prominent role in \r\na period of rapid change and financial restraint in \r\nbuilding a culture of transparency, accountability, good \r\ngovernance and enhanced democratic participation, and \r\nto achieve efficiency and results. \r\n As regards the Security Council, Vanuatu is \r\nsteadfast in its belief that reform measures must \r\nprovide for democratic and geographically strategic \r\nrepresentation in both the permanent and the \r\nnon-permanent membership to reflect the realities of \r\nthis century. We continue to lend our invaluable \r\nsupport to the candidacies of the many countries vying \r\nfor membership within the non-permanent seat \r\ncategory of the Security Council. We hope that \r\nsustained reforms will help to boost the Security \r\nCouncil’s peacekeeping role and to increase efficiency \r\nand transparency in promoting the universal standards \r\nand common values and customs that form the basis of \r\nglobal security and development. At this juncture, let \r\nme acknowledge the work of the peacekeeping and \r\nnation-building missions of the United Nations in \r\nsupporting new countries, such as Timor-Leste, South \r\nSudan and others, in their nation-building. \r\n On 9 September 2011, we marked the tenth \r\nanniversary of the twin towers bombing that wreaked \r\nhavoc in the city of New York and claimed more than \r\n3,000 lives. Such acts of terrorism can never be \r\njustified, whatever the causes they claim to be \r\nA/66/PV.23  \r\n \r\n11-51372 10 \r\n \r\nadvancing and to whatever grievances they claim to \r\nrespond. \r\n Despite international efforts to counter terrorism, \r\nmajor threats remain. Indeed, the world cannot sit idly \r\nby, watching the forces of evil threaten humanity’s \r\nright to peace and security. Terrorism cannot and must \r\nnot be allowed to flourish. Vanuatu condemns, in the \r\nstrongest possible terms, all forms and manifestations \r\nof terrorism, and calls on all countries to join forces to \r\nfight against its evil ideologies, activities and financing \r\nin order to make the world of tomorrow a safer place. \r\nAll countries must work closely in eliminating that \r\nscourge. \r\n Today, the lack of progress on disarmament and \r\nnon-proliferation, cornerstones of global security, is \r\ndisturbing. The world’s nuclear Powers must fulfil \r\ntheir vows to meet their obligations under the Treaty on \r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to take \r\ndecisive and practical steps towards irreversible \r\ndisarmament. Only then will the proliferation of arms \r\nreverse. \r\n My people welcome the strenuous efforts of \r\nPresident Obama and other world leaders, working \r\ntogether at the vanguard to advance negotiations on \r\ndenuclearization. The very recent events in Japan’s \r\nFukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster clearly show that \r\nwhatever safeguards are in place, there can be no \r\nabsolute guarantee that those can withstand the \r\nunforgivable ferocity of Mother Nature. They are \r\nimportant lessons for us. \r\n Four years after the global financial crisis began, \r\nin 2007, the economies of many developed countries \r\ncontinue to struggle, stirring financial markets \r\nworldwide with fresh fears of impediments, default and \r\npossible recession. For small developing countries, \r\nsuch as Vanuatu, the rise in food prices, high fuel costs, \r\nsoaring commodity prices, fears of a global recession, \r\nas well as the other unforeseen effects of the global \r\nfinancial instability and uncertainty that remain in \r\nmany developed countries, are having multifaceted \r\nconsequences. \r\n Such developments, coupled with the ongoing \r\neffects of climate change and natural disasters, \r\ncontinue to threaten the economies of small island \r\nnations, and to undermine all efforts towards the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) to ensure that \r\nsustainable development is achieved. \r\n Vanuatu has made some progress towards \r\nachieving the MDGs, but much more needs to be done \r\nby pooling our own resources at the national level and \r\nby engaging the international community in \r\ncoordinating efforts so as to achieve our MDGs. \r\n The convening of this year’s thematic group on \r\nnon-communicable diseases (NCDs) is indeed timely. \r\nIn my country, it is estimated that approximately 75 per \r\ncent of deaths each year are related to NCDs. \r\nFurthermore, the immediate causes of the NCD \r\nepidemic — tobacco use, unhealthy diets, physical \r\ninactivity and the harmful use of alcohol — are \r\nbecoming increasingly widespread in our society, \r\nespecially in urban areas. Those self-inflicted diseases \r\nare, therefore, becoming a major barrier to our socio-\r\neconomic development and to achieving healthy \r\nislands and the MDGs.  \r\n At this point in time, my country is undertaking, \r\nfor the first time, a national NCD STEPS survey to \r\ndetermine and to better understand the burden and the \r\nextent of NCDs and their determinants in our \r\ncommunities so that we can better target our \r\nintervention efforts in future. Early this year, Vanuatu \r\nlaunched its revised NCD strategy and policy for the \r\nperiod 2011 to 2016 to guide our implementation \r\nefforts in the coming years. We have also implemented, \r\nover the years, many key NCD strategies to empower \r\nour people to increase control over their health and its \r\ndeterminants, with the assistance of our development \r\npartners, such as the World Health Organization, the \r\nAustralian Agency for International Development and \r\nthe Secretariat of the Pacific Community. \r\n In terms of economic performance, Vanuatu’s \r\neconomy grew at an unprecedented average rate of \r\n6 per cent between 2003 and 2008. Economic growth \r\nhas since weakened, mainly as a result of exogenous \r\nshocks felt during the ongoing global financial crisis. \r\nThat has had a negative impact on Government revenue \r\nin the past few years, adding further strain on the \r\neconomy. That said, the need for significant increases \r\nin financial support from development partners remains \r\npressing. The announcement of a considerable increase \r\nin credit facilities at the Group of Twenty London \r\nsummit in 2009 was welcome news. However, the \r\nreassertion of those financial commitments and swift \r\naction need to be rigorously followed up by the donor \r\ncommunity. \r\n A/66/PV.23\r\n \r\n11 11-51372 \r\n \r\n The previous assessment by the United Nations \r\nCommittee for Development Policy of Vanuatu’s \r\ndevelopment status as a least developed country has \r\nshowed a progressive pace in development. While \r\ngraduation may be imminent, I must underscore, before \r\nthe Assembly, that most challenges of the small island \r\ndeveloping States are permanent. The challenges of \r\nsmallness, the distance to major metropolitan markets, \r\nextreme vulnerability to natural disasters and climate \r\nchange, the sea-level rise and vulnerability to tsunamis \r\nall constitute permanent characteristics of our island \r\nnations. It is therefore important for the United Nations \r\nto ensure that multilateral mechanisms for graduation \r\nand a transition package must not be detached from \r\nthose permanent realities. We are delighted that the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly has vowed to pay \r\nspecial attention to vulnerable States such as ours. \r\n Climate change and ocean acidification remain \r\nthe single greatest threat to the livelihoods, security \r\nand well-being of the peoples of the Pacific, \r\nparticularly for small low-lying Pacific islands. High \r\ngreenhouse gas emitting industrialized countries must \r\nstart to embrace and to accept the common but \r\ndifferentiated responsibilities in historic contributions \r\nto climate change. \r\n As the former Chair of the Pacific Islands Forum, \r\nI, along with my fellow leaders of the Pacific Island \r\nnations, particularly welcome the historic visit of \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon to the Pacific. I call \r\non the United Nations to undertake more senior \r\nmissions to the Pacific region so as to establish a more \r\ncomprehensive understanding of how susceptible the \r\npeople of the Pacific are to the adverse impacts of \r\nclimate change and sea-level rise, as embodied by the \r\ncase of Kiribati. \r\n I call on leaders of advanced nations to renew and \r\nhonour their pledges to finance, in particular, efforts to \r\nhelp the most vulnerable communities to address their \r\nadaptation needs in order to ensure that island nations \r\nsurvive the impending global disaster that climate \r\nchange may afford. An increased global fund to \r\nstrengthen the capacity-building efforts of vulnerable \r\ncommunities, in particular, to integrate climate change \r\ninto economic policies and actions, is pressing. \r\n As we prepare for the Conference of the Parties \r\nto the United Nations Framework Convention on \r\nClimate Change (COP 17) talks in Durban, my \r\nGovernment urges all delegations to work tirelessly to \r\npledge to a second commitment period of the Kyoto \r\nProtocol. Durban must advance all aspects of the \r\nclimate change negotiations and devise strategies to \r\noperationalize the COP 16 decisions if any concrete, \r\nbalanced and ambitious outcomes are to yield results. \r\n Colonialism and all forms of imperialism must be \r\naddressed by the United Nations, for one of the reasons \r\nwhy the United Nations system was created was to \r\ndevelop friendly relations among nations, based on \r\nrespect for the principles of equal rights and the self-\r\ndetermination of peoples. Therefore, colonial rule is \r\nobsolete and must be addressed with new drive and \r\nvision. The United Nations, as well as the international \r\ncommunity, must continue in their efforts to address \r\nissues of decolonization in those Non-Self-Governing \r\nTerritories that still yearn for freedom.  \r\n The mandate of the Special Committee on \r\nDecolonization must be strengthened. All means should \r\nbe accorded to the Committee to allow it to magnify \r\nthe suppressed voices of the peoples in all Non-Self-\r\nGoverning Territories that are still under the control of \r\nadministrative Powers, especially where serious human \r\nrights violations are reported. \r\n My country, Vanuatu, was the last in the Pacific \r\nregion to be decolonized. Since our independence in \r\n1980, we have continued to speak out for the \r\ninalienable rights of the colonized indigenous peoples \r\nof Oceania and in certain parts of the Asian region, \r\nwhere either administrative or colonial Powers still \r\nretain authority. \r\n My Government also calls upon the United \r\nNations to ensure that the demands for French \r\nPolynesia’s right to self-determination are not rejected. \r\nWe, along with many other Pacific island nations, \r\nsupport calls for the reinstatement of the French-\r\nadministered Territory with the United Nations Special \r\nCommittee on Decolonization. That would be the first \r\nmajor step in the process of their self-determination. \r\nVanuatu encourages the French-administered Territory \r\nof French Polynesia and, in the same spirit, that of \r\nNew Caledonia to continue to seek meaningful \r\ndialogue with France in order to find ways to ensure \r\nthat the freedom of the colonized peoples of Oceania is \r\nfully realized. \r\n Enshrined in the core principles of the United \r\nNations Charter, the Organization must guarantee \r\nuniversal respect for the human rights and fundamental \r\nfreedoms of all the oppressed. The universal pursuit of \r\nA/66/PV.23  \r\n \r\n11-51372 12 \r\n \r\ndemocratic reform, good governance and adherence to \r\nhuman rights conventions have often concealed the \r\nsuffering of many people, denying them their right to \r\ndecide their destiny without fear or reprisal. The \r\nUnited Nations must step up its efforts to exercise their \r\nfreedom from the tentacles of foreign rule, so \r\ntroublesome a misgiving in these modern times. \r\n One day, all the indigenous peoples of Oceania \r\nand beyond must reach their goal of freedom, a \r\ndestination promised to all humanity and a right that \r\nthe Creator endowed upon all peoples and that no \r\nearthly Power can deny, to determine where they live \r\nand to be self-ruled in free association with the \r\ninternational community of nations. \r\n Let me take this opportunity once again to \r\nreiterate to this eminent Assembly our serious concerns \r\nover the infringement by foreign forces on the political \r\nfreedom of many of our nations today, a right denied to \r\nthe people of the land to exercise their freedom to \r\ncontrol their lands, a freedom denied by the injustices \r\nof the global world order that demarcated many of our \r\nlands, dividing peoples, families and cultures and \r\ndisconnecting us from the traditions of our ancestors. \r\nDenying the right of a country to exercise its political \r\nfreedom over its maritime territorial boundaries and \r\npreventing the indigenous people of a country from \r\nexercising their culture and traditional linkages with \r\nintegral part of its lands, sovereign since time \r\nimmemorial, remain one of the greatest crimes of our \r\ntimes. We are therefore calling on the United Nations \r\nto ensure that our fundamental rights can be exercised \r\nin all parts of our territory. \r\n Mr. Allam-mi (Chad), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n As the world unites in addressing some of the \r\nmajor challenges of our times, the lifting of the \r\neconomic embargo on Cuba is long overdue. Denying \r\nthe good people of Cuba from fully participating in the \r\nglobal economy is inhumane. T is high time that the \r\nCuban people be allowed to enjoy their rights and \r\nfreedom as an independent and sovereign nation. \r\n It is time that we all revisit the aspirations and the \r\nideals with which the United Nations system was \r\ncreated and join forces to weed out injustice, \r\ncolonialism, poverty, hunger, war crimes, terrorism and \r\nthe like in the hope of creating a peaceful and secure \r\nworld for generations to come. All nations, great and \r\nsmall, must respect each other’s sovereignty, for that is \r\nthe way to achieve trust and to ensure a dignified \r\nconfidence among all friends gathered around the table \r\nof the United Nations. \r\n I also welcome Fiji’s commitment to full and \r\ndemocratic elections by September 2014. As a Pacific \r\nneighbour, such as announcement is timely. \r\n In conclusion, I wish to take this final \r\nopportunity to express my gratitude to Vanuatu’s \r\ndevelopment partners for the support that they provide \r\nin building our economy. I believe that more can be \r\ndone to help small vulnerable island countries like \r\nVanuatu to address the rising challenges confronting \r\nthem. \r\n Leaders of the world, the resounding echoes of \r\nhistory drum in our ears and remind us of what must be \r\ndone tomorrow. The global forces driving the changes \r\nthat will shape our future must beckon towards a world \r\nwhere people of all races, ethnicities, creeds, beliefs, \r\nfaiths, cultures, traditions and origins can live in \r\nharmony and peace, as brothers and sisters.  \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Vanuatu for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Meltek Sato Kilman Livtunvanu, Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Vanuatu, was escorted \r\nfrom the rostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Danny Philip, Prime Minister of \r\nSolomon Islands  \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of Solomon Islands. \r\n Mr. Danny Philip, Prime Minister of Solomon \r\nIslands, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Danny \r\nPhilip, Prime Minister of Solomon Islands, and inviting \r\nhim to address the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Philip (Solomon Islands): Solomon Islands, \r\nwith much pride, wishes to thank our Secretary-\r\nGeneral, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for \r\nhonouring my country with a historic visit earlier this \r\nmonth. He is the first Secretary-General to have set \r\nfoot on a Pacific small island developing State with \r\nleast developed country (LDC) status. His re-election \r\n A/66/PV.23\r\n \r\n13 11-51372 \r\n \r\nto a second five-year term speaks to his strong \r\nconviction in advancing multilateralism and his \r\nattentiveness to the challenges facing all members, \r\nincluding the vulnerable countries. We once again \r\npledge our support to the Secretary-General during his \r\nsecond term in office. \r\n Let me take this opportunity to acknowledge the \r\nleadership and tireless work of Mr. Joseph Deiss as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly during the past \r\nsession, and to congratulate the President of the current \r\nsession on his election. I am confident that, under his \r\nleadership, the responsibilities of the United Nations \r\nwill be strengthened, especially at a time when there is \r\nnervousness in world markets, with the threat of a \r\npossible double-dip recession becoming more real \r\nevery day; a time when the world is witnessing unrest \r\nin Asia, riots in Europe and famine in the Horn of \r\nAfrica; a time when the narrow interests and ambitions \r\nof some are being cycled through the United Nations \r\nsystem, thereby harming the principles for which this \r\nOrganization stands. \r\n In this respect, the theme for the sixty-sixth \r\nsession, “The role of mediation in the settlement of \r\ndisputes by peaceful means”, is fitting and timely. The \r\nOrganization was set up to preserve peace for all, not \r\nconditional peace for some. It is about honest \r\ninternational cooperation built on a spirit of optimism \r\nand positivism. It is about interaction between States \r\nwith a sense of duty and an awakened conscience to \r\neffect change. Multilateral diplomatic and political \r\ninitiatives need to take centre stage instead of military \r\nsolutions, which may lead to lengthy and protracted \r\nconflicts. \r\n The role of mediation in Solomon Islands is about \r\ncreating a common voice among the 87 different \r\nlanguages spoken in the country. The Government \r\nremains committed to building a cohesive multicultural \r\nsociety with equal opportunities for all. The Solomon \r\nIslands Ministry of National Unity, Reconciliation and \r\nPeace, along with the Truth and Reconciliation \r\nCommission, is in its third year of continuing to build \r\nbridges between formerly conflicting parties by \r\nconveying a message of tolerance, respect, dialogue \r\nand understanding among Solomon Islanders. \r\n I am pleased to say that my Government is \r\nreforming and improving our democratic system by \r\nsetting the goal of continuing national consultations on \r\nthe Political Parties’ Integrity Bill, introduced in 2009 \r\nby the previous Government. We are developing a \r\ncomprehensive policy to identify legislation that needs \r\nto be reviewed or enacted. \r\n Solomon Islands has set itself progressively \r\nambitious goals within the various international \r\nframeworks. We can achieve all of those goals only by \r\nhaving focused a relationship with the United Nations. \r\nWe feel that the United Nations needs to engage in \r\nspecial outreach to countries with special needs, \r\nespecially those lagging furthest behind, so as to assist \r\nthem in implementing the outcomes of global \r\nagreements. To make a difference, the international \r\ncommunity must honour its commitments, and do so by \r\ngiving sufficiently to ensure that the required economic \r\ntransformation occurs in LDCs and small island \r\ndeveloping States (SIDS). \r\n Multilateralism has provided the basis for our \r\nforeign policy. We opened a second Permanent Mission \r\nto the United Nations, in Geneva, in June this year, and \r\nwould like to see our action reciprocated with an \r\nenhanced United Nations country presence in Solomon \r\nIslands. We have an over-regionalized United Nations \r\nsystem that has seen problems grow in the Pacific. \r\nSmall as we are, three of our Pacific countries have \r\nexperienced conflict over the past two decades, and \r\nfive of the 12 are listed as least developed countries. \r\n Today, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) claim \r\nsix in every 10 lives in the Pacific. Non-communicable \r\ndiseases are pandemic in the region. In that regard, \r\nSolomon Islands has put in place a non-communicable \r\ndiseases strategic plan for the period 2011-2015. \r\nPrevention remains the cornerstone of our NCD policy, \r\nas does the development of our primary health \r\ncoverage across the country. We will continue to need \r\nsustained external support in the short to medium term \r\nso that we can implement our NCD programmes. \r\n Solomon Islands, as a least developed country, \r\napplauds the adoption in May of the 10-year Istanbul \r\nProgramme of Action for the least developed countries. \r\nThe Programme provides an opportunity to lift \r\n880 million people within the international community \r\nout of poverty. The 48 LDCs have developed a \r\nprogramme with the ambitious target of seeing half of \r\nthe LDCs graduate by 2020. The programme focuses \r\non investing in the productive sectors of LDCs in order \r\nto tackle our development challenges by triggering \r\nstable, sustained and inclusive economic growth. \r\nPartnership is critical to support investment in income-\r\nA/66/PV.23  \r\n \r\n11-51372 14 \r\n \r\ngenerating activities, employment creation, infrastructure \r\ndevelopment, rural agricultural development and \r\ninvestment in smallholder farmers. Solomon Islands, in \r\nreaching out to the 85 per cent of its population living \r\nin rural areas, is currently implementing parallel \r\nsectoral and constitutional reforms and land reform \r\nprogrammes. \r\n Solomon Islands supports the call for the \r\nSecretary-General to conduct structured discussions on \r\na post-2015 Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \r\nagenda. As we all must realize and admit, we will fall \r\nshort of achieving the Millennium Development Goals \r\ncome 2015. The review must examine the means of \r\nachieving the social and development goals. That \r\nmeans looking at the MDGs from a sustainable \r\ndevelopment perspective. Solomon Islands looks \r\nforward to that discussion. \r\n On climate change, we call on the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to garner the necessary political will from our \r\ndeveloped partners to adopt a second commitment \r\nperiod in Durban under the Kyoto Protocol. This would \r\navoid a gap between the first and second commitment \r\nperiods and would be sufficient to ensure the survival \r\nof all vulnerable people and prevent climate change \r\nimpacts from reaching irreversible levels. \r\n Problems associated with climate change are \r\ngrowing challenges for our country. We are taking \r\nseveral practical measures. The Government is \r\nplanning the relocation of our national referral hospital \r\nto higher ground. Efforts to build a resilience policy on \r\nfood and water security are progressing under the \r\nadaptation programme. Our climate change challenges \r\nare growing, and fast-track funds promised two years \r\nago must be made available to vulnerable countries as \r\na matter of real urgency. Solomon Islands is in the \r\nprocess of establishing economic growth centres \r\nthroughout the country, and we are looking at powering \r\nthese centres with renewable energy, which we view as \r\na necessity and a condition for growth. \r\n Solomon Islands is grateful for the growth of \r\nSouth-South cooperation and its policy engagement \r\nwithin the international community, especially support \r\nfrom such countries as Cuba, India and Papua New \r\nGuinea. We also welcome new non-traditional partners \r\nwith our region, including Luxembourg, Georgia and \r\nItaly, who have rendered support and are instrumental \r\nin complementing the support from our traditional \r\npartners the European Union, Australia, New Zealand, \r\nthe Republic of China and Japan. \r\n Solomon Islands, as a post-conflict country, \r\nremains engaged with the Australia-led Regional \r\nAssistance Mission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI), \r\nwith support from New Zealand and other Pacific \r\nIslands Forum member countries. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral, during his recent trip to my country, had a \r\nbird’s eye view of the achievements of RAMSI in the \r\nrestoration of law and order and the reform of our \r\neconomic and governance systems. My country \r\nremains grateful to all our Pacific neighbours for their \r\nsupport and reiterates that any winding down of \r\nRAMSI activities should be done in a calculated and \r\nresponsible manner.  \r\n We continue to seek homegrown solutions within \r\nthe region. The Melanesian Spearhead Group has \r\nagreed to establish a Melanesian regional police \r\nacademy, bringing together Fiji, Papua New Guinea, \r\nVanuatu and Solomon Islands discipline forces to \r\nrespond to emerging needs, from disasters to conflicts. \r\nSolomon Islands hopes to join Fiji, Vanuatu and Papua \r\nNew Guinea in having its police force participate in \r\nUnited Nations missions. Work is still in progress, and \r\nwe hope to conclude it soon. \r\n Within my region, Solomon Islands continues to \r\nsupport the inscription of the French territory of New \r\nCaledonia on the United Nations decolonization list \r\nand will extend similar support to French Polynesia, \r\nworking with all stakeholders, including the \r\nAdministrator. In particular, the Melanesian Spearhead \r\nGroup countries strongly support the inscription of \r\nNew Caledonia and French Polynesia for \r\ndecolonization. \r\n The current international system has pushed us to \r\nthe edge of our finite natural resources. The United \r\nNations Conference on Sustainable Development in \r\nRio next year will be another global opportunity to \r\nidentify gaps within existing sustainable development \r\nframeworks, from the Barbados Programme of Action \r\nand the Mauritius Strategy, which recognize the special \r\nsituation of small island developing States, to the \r\nIstanbul Programme of Action for LDCs. We strongly \r\nurge signatory countries to honour their commitments. \r\n Solomon Islands looks forward to the \r\nnegotiations scheduled for late this year. Already, we \r\nare in the midst of preserving the last global stock of \r\ntuna by creating the world’s first sustainable industrial \r\n A/66/PV.23\r\n \r\n15 11-51372 \r\n \r\nfishing industry through a subregional intergovernmental \r\nmechanism. Fisheries remain our source of food and \r\nincome, and we will need to maximize returns from \r\nthese resources in a sustainable manner by bringing \r\ntogether three pillars of sustainable development on \r\nequal footing and in a balanced and sustainable \r\nmanner. \r\n Solomon Islands is host to the regional Pacific \r\nIslands Forum Fisheries Agency, and we continue to \r\nregister our interest in hosting the regional marine \r\nscientific and technological centre of the United \r\nNations Conference on the Law of the Sea to advance \r\nmarine scientific research in the Pacific region and to \r\nfoster the transfer of marine technology for the \r\ndevelopment of our ocean and marine resources. \r\n Solomon Islands believes in dialogue and \r\nengagement with all countries of the world, including \r\nFiji. We do so within the framework of the United \r\nNations Charter and the Melanesian Spearhead Group \r\nprinciples, with mutual respect for each other’s \r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, \r\nnon-interference in each other’s internal affairs, \r\nequality, mutual benefit and peaceful coexistence with \r\neach other. We would like to encourage all States to do \r\nlikewise. \r\n I am equally pleased to say that, since my \r\nGovernment came into office some 14 months ago, we \r\nhave established relations with more than 27 countries \r\nand will continue to reach out to all countries to ensure \r\nthat Solomon Islands remains connected in our \r\ninterlinked world. On this note, I welcome a new \r\nmember to our family of nations, South Sudan. We \r\noffer South Sudan our friendship and look forward to \r\nworking with it on all issues of common concern to our \r\ncountries. \r\n The 51-year-old economic blockade of Cuba \r\nremains an issue stuck in time. Solomon Islands, in a \r\nspirit of friendship and in observation of the principle \r\nof good neighbourliness, makes a humble call on our \r\npartner and friend, the United States, for the \r\nunconditional lifting of the economic blockade against \r\nthe people of Cuba. We request that the two States \r\nrenew, restore, revive, redeem and reclaim their \r\nfriendship and respect for each other’s sovereignty \r\nwithin the letter and spirit of the United Nations \r\nCharter. \r\n Solomon Islands will host the eleventh Festival of \r\nPacific Arts next year to celebrate and promote the \r\nunique and diverse indigenous cultures of the Pacific. \r\nThe Festival will give us an opportunity to express our \r\nsense of pride, awareness and recognition of the \r\n“Pacificness” of the isolated communities within the \r\nPacific and to develop and preserve a deep sense of \r\nsolidarity and unity through our ancient music, body \r\nart, dances and languages. We look forward to \r\nreceiving our guests in 2012. \r\n On the long-standing conflict in the holy land, \r\nSolomon Islands supports the work of the Quartet. We \r\nnote that more than two-thirds of United Nations \r\nMember States recognize Palestine as a State. Solomon \r\nIslands, in the name of peace, believes that the \r\ninternational community must have the strength and \r\nstamina to act decisively, build on the two-State \r\nsolution and overcome the distrust that exists in the \r\nregion multilaterally. \r\n On Security Council reform, Solomon Islands \r\ncontinues to support the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on expansion in the number of permanent \r\nand non-permanent seats of the Council. My delegation \r\nis mindful of the fact that the most recent Security \r\nCouncil reform occurred in 1965. The world has \r\nchanged since then. We need to streamline the current \r\nnegotiating text within our informal intergovernmental \r\nnegotiation process and join other small island \r\ndeveloping States in calling for a non-permanent seat \r\nin the Security Council explicitly for small island \r\ndeveloping States. \r\n On the issue of human rights, I am pleased to say \r\nthat Solomon Islands has submitted its national human \r\nrights report to the Human Rights Council. For a \r\ndeveloping country, the right to development is the \r\ncore of the country’s policy. Putting people at the \r\ncentre of development, their meaningful participation \r\nand the fair distribution of national wealth and benefits \r\nwill bring peace to an angry man, feed a hungry child \r\nand empower our womenfolk. \r\n My delegation would like to acknowledge the \r\nchange in nomenclature within the 53-member Group \r\nof Asian States to the Asia and the Pacific Small \r\nIslands Developing States Group. This is an important \r\ndevelopment and truly represents the diversity of \r\nmembership that exists within the Asia Group. We \r\napplaud our Asian colleagues for taking such a \r\ndecision. \r\n On the issue of gender, Solomon Islands has huge \r\nchallenges, to the extent that it will seek a regional seat \r\nA/66/PV.23  \r\n \r\n11-51372 16 \r\n \r\nwithin the Executive Board of United Nations Entity \r\nfor Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women. \r\nSolomon Islands is presenting its candidate as a Pacific \r\nSIDs-endorsed candidate, and with the support of the \r\nAssembly it hopes to give an LDC and SIDS flavour to \r\nthe Board. \r\n On Taiwan cross-strait relations, my delegation \r\ncontinues to commend the ongoing dialogue between \r\nthe Republic of China on Taiwan and the People’s \r\nRepublic of China. We note Taiwan’s continuous \r\ncontributions to the global health system in terms of a \r\nwide range of international development programmes, \r\nand welcome its participation as an observer to the \r\nWorld Health Assembly. We continue to call for such \r\narrangements to be extended to other United Nations \r\ntreaty bodies, including the United Nations Convention \r\non Climate Change (UNFCCC) to ensure the \r\nmeaningful participation of Taiwan and its people in \r\nthe affairs of the international community. Solomon \r\nIslands also acknowledges Taiwan’s climate change \r\nmitigation and renewable energy programmes with \r\ndeveloping countries, and would like to see the \r\napplication of similar observer arrangements extended \r\nto Taiwan within the UNFCCC. \r\n Let me conclude by expressing once again my \r\ndelegation’s confidence in translating our global \r\nagenda into action within the next 12 months. Many \r\nlives depend on that. On behalf of the Government and \r\npeople of Solomon Islands, I assure the Assembly of \r\nour support and cooperation.  \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPrimer Minister of Solomon Islands for the statement \r\nhe has just made. \r\n Mr. Danny Philip, Prime Minister of the Solomon \r\nIslands, was escorted from the rostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by Lord Tu’ivakano of Nukunuku, \r\nPrime Minister, Minister for Foreign Affairs, \r\nDefence, Information and Communication of \r\nthe Kingdom of Tonga \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Defence, \r\nInformation and Communication of the Kingdom of \r\nTonga. \r\n Lord Tu’ivakano of Nukunuku, Prime Minister, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, Defence, \r\nInformation and Communication of the Kingdom \r\nof Tonga, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency Lord \r\nTu’ivakano of Nukunuku, Prime Minister, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs, Defence, Information and Communication \r\nof the Kingdom of Tonga, and inviting him to address \r\nthe General Assembly. \r\n Lord Tu’ivakano (Tonga): Like others who have \r\nspoken before me, allow me to add my warm \r\ncongratulations to Mr. Al-Nasser on his election as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly for our current \r\nsession. My delegation and I assure him, as always, of \r\nour support and cooperation. I also wish to thank \r\nMr. Joseph Diess of Switzerland for a successful term \r\nas President at the sixty-fifth session. We also \r\nremember another former President of the Assembly, \r\nMr. Harri Holkeri of Finland, who passed away earlier \r\nthis year but who left a lasting impact on the good \r\nwork of the General Assembly and the United Nations. \r\n As for the ongoing leadership of the \r\nOrganization, I wish to extend my congratulations to \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon on his appointment to \r\na deserved second term. He and the Secretariat \r\ncontinue to show the firm resolve needed during these \r\nchallenging times of global crisis. We pay tribute also \r\nto the memory of those members of the Secretariat who \r\nhave made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of \r\ninternational duty. \r\n A further example of the critical role played by \r\nthe Secretary-General during these difficult times was the \r\nconvening earlier this week of the High-level Meeting on \r\nthe prevention and control of non-communicable diseases \r\n(NCDs). The dangerous potential of NCDs, unchecked \r\nin small States like mine, threatens not just livelihoods \r\nand lifestyle but whatever gains may have been \r\nachieved as they relate to Millennium Development \r\nGoal (MDG) 6 and the other MDGs. \r\n At our annual meeting of Pacific Island Forum \r\nleaders in Auckland earlier this month, we adopted a \r\nstatement on NCDs in which, among other things, we \r\ncommitted our Governments to implementing five key \r\ninterventions in areas known to reduce NCDs: \r\nControlling tobacco, improving diets, increasing \r\nphysical activity, reducing alcohol intake and \r\nfacilitating access to essential drugs and technologies. \r\n A/66/PV.23\r\n \r\n17 11-51372 \r\n \r\n In that respect, Tonga was pleased to join other \r\nMember States in adopting the Political Declaration \r\n(resolution 66/2, annex) of the High-level Meeting on \r\nthe prevention and control of NCDS. I sincerely \r\nbelieve that the Meeting was a good step in the right \r\ndirection for setting a healthier and enjoyable future \r\nfor us all. \r\n We were pleased that the Secretary-General was \r\nable to visit a number of countries in our region on his \r\nway to his historic attendance at the Pacific Islands \r\nForum. He was able to assess for himself the dominant \r\nimpact of climate change on countries in the Pacific \r\nand to validate the activities of Pacific small island \r\ndeveloping States like Tonga in international forums. \r\nWe must use the positive foundations laid down \r\ncollectively in Copenhagen and Cancún to embrace the \r\npromise that might lie in Durban at the seventeenth \r\nConference of the Parties to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change in \r\nDecember. \r\n We are pleased that, in July, under the able \r\npresidency of Germany, the Security Council took solid \r\nsteps to seize the moral imperative by holding an open \r\ndebate and producing a presidential statement on the \r\nMaintenance of international peace and security and \r\nthe impact of climate change (S/PRST/2011/15*). The \r\nCouncil and its membership, now and in the future, \r\nmust not turn from their vigilant duty to keep \r\nthemselves in a position of leadership over this issue \r\nand its implications for Member States like Tonga and \r\nothers in the Pacific. \r\n While last year’s High-level Meeting on MDGs \r\noffered small island developing States like Tonga an \r\nopportunity to take stock of their progress towards \r\nachieving those Goals in 2015, we consider that we \r\nhave a similar chance to do so as we all prepare for the \r\nUnited Nations Conference on Sustainable Development \r\nnext year. We stress the critical importance of the \r\nsustainable development, management and conservation of \r\nour ocean and marine resources — living and \r\nnon-living — as a proper source of livelihood and \r\nincome for our communities and Governments. \r\nEnsuring that States like ours enjoy a greater share of \r\nthe benefits derived from such resources is key. What \r\nwe within the Pacific small island developing States \r\nhave come to refer to as the “blue economy” will be \r\nour challenge to the Rio Conference to meet the \r\nexpectations and development aspirations of our \r\npeoples. \r\n As such, Tonga continues to observe its \r\nobligations under the United Nations Convention on \r\nthe Law of the Sea and notes the decision taken by \r\nconsensus by the States parties this year relating to the \r\nworkload of the Commission on the Limits of the \r\nContinental Shelf, whose work is much valued by \r\ncoastal States such as mine. Tonga, together with \r\nanother sister State from the region, again actively \r\nparticipated in the work of the International Seabed \r\nAuthority this year and noted the decision by the \r\nAuthority to grant exploration licenses to entities \r\nsponsored by our respective Governments. This \r\nrepresents a creative path for States like mine, within \r\nthe spirit of the Convention, towards solid partnership \r\nand development. The common heritage of mankind, if \r\nit is to have any true meaning, ought to be common to \r\nall and not just to some or the few with the capacity in \r\nthat area. \r\n Tonga reiterates its call for the creation and \r\ndefinition of a formal small island developing States \r\ncategory within the United Nations system. We are in \r\nneed of a definition that is not based upon a one-size-\r\nfits-all approach. Like others, we must have a \r\ndefinition that separates and addresses those States’ \r\ndiversity of size, population, remoteness, isolation and \r\ndifferent levels of socio-economic development. Such a \r\ndefinition would not only improve linkages within the \r\nUnited Nations system but also, we believe, set a good \r\nbenchmark for the international community that is both \r\ncoherent and practical. It would strengthen the position \r\nof the United Nations and the international system in \r\naddressing small island developing States and the \r\nspecial and unique challenges they face. \r\n Like others, we, too, welcome the Republic of \r\nSouth Sudan as our newest State Member of the United \r\nNations. Tonga has long been supportive of the efforts \r\nto find a comprehensive, just and enduring peace in the \r\nMiddle East. The shifting sands of change known as \r\nthe Arab Spring throughout the surrounding region \r\nearlier this year has made such a peace and genuine \r\nsecurity all the more challenging, but not impossible. \r\nThis is indeed a moment of truth for those with \r\ngenuine hope, not just for a secure Israel and a viable \r\nPalestine, but for those who for so long have had such \r\nhopes for an ambitious peace. \r\n Tonga’s interest in developing renewable energy \r\nsources, within the context of our Tonga energy road \r\nmap, continued to evolve with our election to the \r\nCouncil of the International Renewable Energy Agency \r\nA/66/PV.23  \r\n \r\n11-51372 18 \r\n \r\n(IRENA) at the first session of the Agency’s Assembly, \r\nin April 2011. We will work in earnest to ensure that \r\nthe voices of developing States such as Tonga and \r\nothers on the new Council are heard, given the key \r\nleading role it will play in the Agency’s decision-\r\nmaking and future direction. To take on such a role, \r\nIRENA must be prepared to be innovative. The \r\nAgency’s work will take on greater significance in the \r\ncoming International Year of Sustainable Energy for \r\nAll and its related activities. I would also like to \r\nrecognize the strong support of the Government of the \r\nUnited Arab Emirates as host State for IRENA. \r\n I am pleased to have addressed the Assembly as \r\nthe first democratically elected Prime Minister of \r\nTonga. In the wake of the elections held in November \r\nof last year, I took office the following month, in \r\nDecember, after an evolving process of principal \r\nreforms that, within the context of our 1875 \r\nConstitution, included the peaceful transfer of \r\nexecutive power from His Majesty in Privy Council to \r\nthe Government of the day; a Parliament in which the \r\nmajority of members are elected by universal suffrage; \r\na Prime Minister elected by a majority of the elected \r\nMembers of Parliament; a Cabinet nominated by the \r\nPrime Minister and chosen largely from those elected \r\nMembers of Parliament; a constitutional monarchy; \r\nand a strong and independent judiciary free of political \r\ninfluence. \r\n Notwithstanding this peaceful evolution, the \r\nfundamental freedoms and values guaranteed under the \r\nConstitution continue to afford legal protection and \r\ncomforting reassurance to all Tongans. \r\n To address the uncertain future of the current \r\nglobal economic and financial climate, my Government \r\nhas approved the Tonga strategic development \r\nframework, which provides an overall framework to \r\nguide the Government’s activities for the next four \r\nyears. It involves nine priority areas, from building \r\nstrong, inclusive communities to improving health and \r\neducation standards for a safe, secure and stable \r\nTongan society. Earlier this month, my Government \r\nsigned separate agreements with the Asian \r\nDevelopment Bank and the World Bank to improve \r\ninformation and communications technology services \r\nfor Tonga so as to make them affordable and \r\naccessible. Improving such services will enable Tonga \r\nto enhance its related education, health and \r\nGovernment services as well. My Government \r\nsincerely believes that this framework will put Tonga \r\non a firm path to improving its ability to meaningfully \r\nachieve the United Nations Millennium Development \r\nGoals by 2015. \r\n As such, in closing my Government happily \r\nreaffirms its commitment to the principles of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations, and we pledge to \r\nsupport the ongoing work and reform of the \r\nOrganization. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPrime Minister, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Defence, \r\nInformation and Communication of the Kingdom of \r\nTonga for the statement he has just made. \r\n Lord Tu’ivakano of Nukunuku, Prime Minister, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, Defence, \r\nInformation and Communication of the Kingdom \r\nof Tonga, was escorted from the rostrum.  \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Abdiweli Mohamed Ali, Prime \r\nMinister of the Transitional Federal \r\nGovernment of the Somali Republic \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of the Transitional Federal Government of the \r\nSomali Republic. \r\n Mr. Abdiweli Mohamed Ali, Prime Minister of the \r\nTransitional Federal Government of the Somali \r\nRepublic, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency \r\nMr. Abdiweli Mohamed Ali, Prime Minister of the \r\nTransitional Federal Government of the Somali \r\nRepublic, and inviting him to address the Assembly.  \r\n Mr. Ali (Somalia): Let me take this opportunity \r\nto congratulate Mr. Al-Nasser on his election as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth \r\nsession. I would also like to congratulate the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on his appointment to a second term. We \r\nSomalis would like to thank him for his leadership in \r\nputting Somalia at the top of the agenda despite so \r\nmany competing priorities. We hope that Somalia will \r\nbecome peaceful and stable during his tenure. \r\n It is my honour to address the General Assembly \r\nfor the first time as Prime Minister of Somalia. I come \r\nhere mindful of the enormous challenges at this \r\nimportant moment in our history and determined to act \r\n A/66/PV.23\r\n \r\n19 11-51372 \r\n \r\nboldly in the cause of peace, justice and stability — not \r\nonly in the Horn of Africa but on the African continent \r\nat large and in the world as a whole. \r\n The United Nations was founded on the \r\nconviction that the nations of the world could come \r\ntogether in a spirit of cooperation to tackle their \r\ncommon problems for the sake of the whole of \r\nhumankind. I wish to speak of the challenges facing \r\nSomalia, whose effects have found ample expression in \r\nthe current dire situation in the country, and some of \r\nwhich threaten every country represented here. \r\n Let me take this opportunity to thank the Prime \r\nMinister of Turkey for his genuine leadership and for \r\nhighlighting the plight and suffering of those affected \r\nby the famine in Somalia. The seemingly unending \r\nhumanitarian crisis in Somalia has many and varied \r\ncauses. Decades of conflict, the demise of the central \r\nState, poor and kleptocratic leadership and struggles \r\nbetween clans for limited resources, exacerbated by \r\ncycles of devastating droughts, have created chronic \r\nfood shortages and an underdeveloped economy, and \r\ndriven the population to despair. \r\n In recent years, the global terrorist organization \r\nAl-Qaida has sought to exploit these divisions and \r\nweaknesses to plot and carry out attacks on the rest of \r\nthe world. Our people know only too well the \r\ndestruction that a few, blinded by an ideology of \r\nextremism and terror, can wreak on a country. It is this \r\nsmall minority, and primarily the Al-Qaida affiliated \r\ngroup Al-Shabaab, that is responsible for the famine \r\ncurrently spreading throughout the country, through \r\ntheir policies of systematically looting grain stores, \r\nforcibly recruiting and extorting farmers and their \r\nfamilies and preventing access by aid agencies to the \r\nmost affected regions in the south. \r\n However, the threat they pose is not limited to \r\nour borders. Foreign fighters have sought to export \r\ntheir noxious extremism to the rest of the Horn of \r\nAfrica, recruiting and sponsoring acts of terror in \r\nneighbouring countries such as Uganda, where last \r\nyear they murdered 76 innocent people. The insecurity \r\nthey have created in southern Somalia has led to a \r\nlarge influx of refugees into Kenya and Ethiopia, \r\nstraining resources and spreading instability across the \r\nregion. \r\n They are also actively planning to strike further \r\nafield. Just this week, one of the leaders of Al-Shabaab \r\nsaid that the group was committed to continuing its \r\nbattle against the Government of Somalia and was \r\nseeking to destroy both the United States and the \r\nUnited Nations. It is also well-known that Al-Shabaab \r\nhas been focusing its recruitment and radicalization \r\nefforts on Somali diasporas in Australia, Europe, \r\nCanada and the United States of America. \r\n Clearly, the battle against Al-Qaida is one in \r\nwhich we all have a stake, and in which we all \r\ntherefore have responsibilities. In Somalia, we have \r\nbeen doing what we can, within our limited resources, \r\nto fulfil our obligations in this regard. Barely a month \r\nafter United States forces killed Osama bin Laden, one \r\nof his most wanted deputies, Fazul Abdullah \r\nMohammed, was shot dead by Somali security forces \r\non the outskirts of Mogadishu. Shortly thereafter, with \r\nthe aid of African Union forces, the Somali National \r\nArmy succeeded in forcing the extremists to withdraw \r\nthe bulk of their forces from the capital. As a result, we \r\ncan now begin to provide needed humanitarian \r\nassistance to the city’s ever-increasing population of \r\ninternally displaced persons, who are fleeing the areas \r\nstill held by the extremists where the famine has hit \r\nhardest. \r\n Although the extremists’ retreat from Mogadishu \r\nis a welcome development, it may herald a new and \r\nmore dangerous phase of the conflict, as they \r\nincreasingly turn to asymmetric tactics such as suicide \r\nbombings and the use of improvised explosive devices \r\nthat target the civilian population. As we continue to \r\nbuild up our own capacities, our security agencies are \r\nalert to this threat and have already successfully \r\ndisrupted a number of planned attacks, including \r\nseveral targeting the hungry at feeding centres. \r\n Terrorism preys on decaying States, exploiting \r\ntheir poverty and ungoverned spaces to radicalize, \r\nrecruit and plan. That is why the extremists have \r\nconsistently fought against the Somali peace process \r\nand sought to destroy the institutions it has generated. \r\nSomalia’s leaders are redoubling their efforts to \r\nachieve national reconciliation and entrench \r\ndemocratic governance. Three weeks ago, with the help \r\nof our international partners, we hosted the first \r\nnational consultative conference in Mogadishu, at \r\nwhich the Transitional Institutions and representatives \r\nof regional administrations came together to adopt a \r\nroad map for the re-establishment of permanent, \r\nlegitimate and representative Government in the \r\ncountry. \r\nA/66/PV.23  \r\n \r\n11-51372 20 \r\n \r\n The conference, which was the culmination of \r\nSomali-led reconciliation initiatives dating back to the \r\nArta Declaration of May 2000, represents the best hope \r\nfor Somalia to establish a firm political foundation \r\nfrom which to rebuild. The road map is a significant \r\nachievement for the Somali peace process. Its adoption \r\nmarks the first of many steps on the path to the \r\neventual conclusion of the transition process in a \r\nresponsible and productive manner. It has also shed \r\nlight on the remaining transitional tasks, including the \r\ndrafting and promulgation of a new Constitution. The \r\nTransitional Federal Institutions have committed to \r\nmeeting the specific timelines and benchmarks for their \r\nimplementation as outlined in the road map, which will \r\nallow the Somali people to monitor our performance in \r\nthis regard. \r\n The support of the international community is \r\nalso crucial to ensuring its success. Indeed, the \r\nconference itself could not have taken place without \r\nthe continued engagement of the international \r\ncommunity. Let me also take this opportunity to \r\nexpress gratitude, on behalf of my entire nation, to the \r\nAfrican Union, and especially Uganda and Burundi, for \r\nthe support they have given and the sacrifices they \r\nhave made to date in this worthy cause. The fact that \r\nthe conference was safely held in Mogadishu is \r\ntestimony to the achievements in security that their \r\nforces have made possible in the city. I must also thank \r\nall the countries represented here for the bilateral and \r\nmultilateral support given to both the Transitional \r\nInstitutions and the African Union Mission in Somalia \r\n(AMISOM), without which none of what has been \r\nachieved would have been possible. \r\n Going forward, as we embark on the final leg of \r\nthe transition process, we will continue to need the \r\nhelp and support of the United Nations. The road map \r\nhas illuminated the path and, although dangers may lie \r\nin the shadows, we will not deviate from it. We ask that \r\nthe Organization continue to accompany us on this \r\njourney and to provide the needed resources as we \r\nadvance towards full sovereignty. \r\n Despite the remarkable progress we have made so \r\nfar, our gains remain fragile and consolidating them \r\nwill require resilience and unity from all. It is critical \r\nthat the Somali Army and AMISOM be reinforced as \r\nsoon as possible, so they can prevent a security \r\nvacuum in the areas of Mogadishu recently vacated by \r\nthe fleeing extremists, and ensure that the city is safe \r\nfor both residents and aid workers. The immediate \r\ndeployment of the extra 3,000 AMISOM troops already \r\nauthorized by the Security Council will be a crucial \r\nfirst step. \r\n In addition, we must also begin to show the \r\npeople the fruits of peace and democracy and to \r\nreverse the harmful effects of radicalization. Somalia \r\nneeds the help of the outside world to rebuild its \r\neconomy and provide jobs for the millions of our \r\nyoung people who have been deprived of opportunities \r\nby the anarchy of the past two decades. We must show \r\nthem that there is a better alternative to the barrel of a \r\ngun. \r\n The effort must begin at home. Let me be the first \r\nto acknowledge that we Somalis have made mistakes in \r\nthe past, which eroded the international community’s \r\ntrust in our institutions. Somalia can and must do \r\nbetter. In this time of national crisis, we the Somali \r\npeople must set aside our differences and come \r\ntogether to confront our perils. Reconciliation must \r\nbecome our mantra as we work to further the peace \r\nprocess and create an environment conducive to the \r\ndelivery of aid. We in the political class must also \r\naccept our responsibility for the errors of the past and \r\nresolve to do better. The Somali people have had \r\nenough of war, hunger, political wrangling and \r\ncorruption. They demand, and indeed deserve, a \r\nGovernment that puts the national interest before \r\npersonal ambition — one that fosters unity, not \r\ndivision. \r\n The Transitional Federal Government is making \r\nefforts to reverse this and to instil a sense of patriotism \r\nand responsibility. We are making good progress in \r\ninjecting professionalism and transparency into the \r\nrevenue collection and economic management system, \r\nstrengthening internal mechanisms governing the \r\ndistribution of Government money and creating a more \r\nopen and accountable fiscal and monetary system.  \r\n The Central Bank of Somalia is up and running. \r\nThe economic reforms we have made have resulted in \r\nthe doubling of revenue from the Mogadishu seaport \r\nand quadrupled those from the Aden International \r\nAirport. The funds are being reinvested in the \r\nprovision of services to the people as our current \r\ncapability allows. For example, 15 per cent of the \r\nrevenue collected from the seaport has been set aside \r\nfor the rehabilitation of the city. As a result, for the \r\nfirst time in 20 years, Mogadishu is being cleared of \r\nrubble, roads are being repaired and streets lit, and \r\n A/66/PV.23\r\n \r\n21 11-51372 \r\n \r\nmarkets, hospitals and schools are reopening. A register \r\ncontaining the names and biometric data of all the \r\nmembers of the security forces has been compiled, and \r\nour soldiers are receiving their allowances regularly. \r\n As required by the road map, we have also \r\nembarked on the process of identifying nominees for \r\nthe Interim Independent Anti-Corruption Commission. \r\nWe are also formulating a national fiscal budget for the \r\ncoming fiscal year. \r\n As with the gains in the security sector, in order \r\nto entrench and safeguard these reforms and to deliver \r\non the expectations of the Somali people, we in the \r\nTransitional Federal Government must improve on our \r\nperformance and create the necessary conditions for \r\nthe growth of the Somali economy. However, the scale \r\nof the challenge is such that we will continue to rely on \r\nthe help of our international partners.  \r\n It is understandable that, in the prevailing global \r\neconomic environment, many in the wealthier countries \r\nwill be tempted to look to their own problems, to the \r\ndetriment of providing aid and investment to their \r\npoorer cousins in the developing world. I would \r\ncaution against this. The visionaries who founded this \r\nbody understood that it was impossible to secure \r\neconomic benefits for a section of the global \r\npopulation as long as these remained a distant dream \r\nfor the rest, and sought to establish an interlinked \r\nglobal political and economic infrastructure that \r\nensured that citizens in every country could participate \r\nin, and partake of the fruits of, global prosperity. I \r\ntherefore urge the international community to continue \r\nits generous support for the emerging economic \r\ninstitutions, as we strive to rebuild destroyed \r\ninfrastructure and jump-start economic activity in the \r\nareas our forces are securing. \r\n To the business community I would say that \r\nSomalia is truly Africa’s sleeping giant, and a \r\nrelatively small investment there will go a long way. \r\nWith the longest coastline on the continent, bountiful \r\nand unexploited natural wealth and an entrepreneurial \r\ntradition that dates back to the Roman times, a peaceful \r\nSomalia will be a force for moderation and an engine \r\nof growth and prosperity for the region and for the \r\ncontinent.  \r\n Furthermore, the integration of Somalia into the \r\nglobal economy will have a considerable and beneficial \r\nimpact on the phenomenon of piracy from our shores, \r\nwhich imposes huge costs on global trade. As has been \r\nnoted by many observers, a lasting solution to this \r\nmenace is not to be found in policing the high seas. \r\nThe regeneration of a vibrant economy on land, \r\nproviding jobs and opportunity for all, is the sole \r\nantidote.  \r\n The humanitarian situation in Somalia remains \r\ndire. The United Nations has declared famine in a sixth \r\nregion, which means that up to half the population is \r\nnow facing the prospect of starvation. Many of our \r\npeople continue to come to the capital seeking refuge, \r\nwith more than half a million others having already \r\narrived. To deal with this situation and to oversee the \r\ndelivery of humanitarian assistance, a high-level \r\ncommittee has been created. As per its \r\nrecommendations, the Government has established \r\nseveral camps to house and feed refugees. A disaster \r\nmanagement agency, comprised of members of civil \r\nsociety, has also been established. We are working with \r\nUnited Nations agencies such as the Office for the \r\nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the Office of the \r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and \r\nthe World Food Programme to synchronize our efforts \r\nto deal with the famine. \r\n On behalf of the entire Somali nation, I wish to \r\nexpress my gratitude for the pledges of assistance that \r\nwe have received from Governments and humanitarian \r\nagencies around the world. The greatest need, however, \r\ncontinues to be felt within areas still under the \r\neffective control of the extremists, where access by \r\ninternational humanitarian agencies is severely \r\nrestricted. The insurgents are also hampering the \r\nfreedom of movement of millions who are trying to \r\nreach help, either in Mogadishu or in neighbouring \r\ncountries. \r\n Mr. Mayr-Harting (Austria), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair. \r\n Without urgent interventions to change the \r\nsituation, it is estimated that up to three quarters of a \r\nmillion people may perish in the next few months. \r\nAlthough normal to above-normal rainfall is expected \r\nto return in the next three months, that is unlikely to \r\nresult in a significant easing of the crisis in the short \r\nterm, since the harvest will not be expected until \r\nFebruary. In any case, the production from the short \r\nrainy season only accounts for a third of the total \r\nannual cereal production. The displacement of farmers \r\nby the current famine will only further reduce the \r\nexpected yield. In fact, the United Nations has \r\nA/66/PV.23  \r\n \r\n11-51372 22 \r\n \r\nindicated that it expects the famine to spread to the rest \r\nof the south by the end of the year. \r\n It is therefore critical that we accelerate efforts to \r\nreach those in Al-Shabaab-controlled areas, while at \r\nthe same time ensuring that international humanitarian \r\nworkers are afforded a measure of security against \r\nattacks and kidnappings by the insurgents. As I noted \r\nearlier, the international community must urgently \r\nreinforce our efforts to extend the zone of safety for aid \r\nworkers beyond Mogadishu and into these areas. In the \r\nmeantime, my Government will continue to work \r\nclosely with humanitarian agencies to collect and share \r\ninformation on needs. We stand ready to cooperate \r\nwith all actors to ensure that aid gets to the most \r\ncritically affected populations, wherever they may be. \r\n As I stated before, the challenges I have outlined \r\nhave been aggravated by the increasing cycles of \r\ndevastating drought that we experience as a result of \r\nchanges in global climate patterns. We in the Horn of \r\nAfrica have been affected more than most. As I speak, \r\nthe region is experiencing its worst drought in a \r\ngeneration. The scale of the suffering in my country is \r\na testament to price we are having to pay. \r\n There needs to be a concerted effort not just to \r\naddress the causes of climate change but also to \r\nmitigate its adverse effects, especially in countries such \r\nas Somalia that have contributed little to the problem \r\nbut are bearing the brunt of its consequences. In that \r\nregard, let me reiterate the appeal issued during the \r\nrecent summit on the Horn of Africa crisis, held in the \r\nKenyan capital, Nairobi, for developed nations to \r\nfacilitate the transfer of technology and build up the \r\ncapacity of developing nations to adapt to these \r\nchallenges. Somalia will require assistance to improve \r\nwater resource management and reduce our reliance on \r\nrain-fed agriculture even as we strive to implement the \r\ntargets agreed to at the Nairobi summit of 10 per cent \r\nforest cover and irrigated land by the year 2017. \r\n Moreover, we fully support the right of Palestine \r\nto become a full member of the community of nations. \r\nWe believe in the two-State solution for the \r\nPalestinian-Israeli problem, where Palestinians should \r\nbe allowed to live in peace and dignity in their own \r\nhomeland. We have all seen the changes happening in \r\nthe Arab world. The international community must \r\nsupport the peaceful and democratic aspirations of all \r\npeoples.  \r\n We must also support the National Transitional \r\nCouncil of Libya in order to bring peace and stability \r\nto that country. \r\n In conclusion, today, the future of Somalia hangs \r\nin the balance, and with it the prospects for peace, \r\nstability and prosperity in the Horn of Africa and \r\nsecurity for nations across the world. Resolute global \r\naction in support of our efforts is now required if we \r\nare to consolidate and build on the gains already made \r\nand extend them to the rest of the country for the sake \r\nof future generations. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nTransitional Federal Government of the Somali \r\nRepublic for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Abdiweli Mohamed Ali, Prime Minister of the \r\nTransitional Federal Government of the Somali \r\nRepublic, was escorted from the rostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Gilbert Fossoun Houngbo, \r\nPrime Minister of the Togolese Republic \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Togolese \r\nRepublic. \r\n Mr. Gilbert Fossoun Houngbo, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Togolese Republic, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum. \r\n The Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Gilbert Fossoun \r\nHoungbo, Prime Minister of the Togolese Republic, \r\nand inviting him to address the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Houngbo (Togo) (spoke in French): My \r\ncountry, Togo, welcomes the election of the President \r\nof the Assembly to direct the work of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-sixth session. On behalf of the \r\nGovernment and people of Togo and on my own \r\nbehalf, I would like to convey our warm \r\ncongratulations to him. We wish him every success in \r\naccomplishing his noble and exhilarating mission. \r\n Today more than ever, the ever increasing number \r\nof challenges facing the planet call for greater \r\nsolidarity to provide an effective global solution \r\nworthy of our peoples’ aspirations. When world leaders \r\nbringing forth their nations’ ambitions meet in this \r\nforum to reflect upon the main issues of the hour, it is \r\nto give their people hope for a brighter tomorrow. \r\n A/66/PV.23\r\n \r\n23 11-51372 \r\n \r\n In order to address those various challenges, Togo \r\nhas for several years endeavoured to relaunch its \r\neconomy to achieve sustainable development for the \r\nwell-being of its people. We have made strengthening \r\nnational unity and good governance, reviving economic \r\ngrowth and combating social injustice our rallying cry. \r\n In terms of political governance, Togo remains \r\nfaithful to its new vision of sharing its victory with all \r\nstakeholders of goodwill, including political parties \r\nthat have lost in elections. Above all, this is about \r\nemphasizing the peoples’ victory and not that of any \r\npolitical party. In our opinion, that concept of power \r\nshould inspire all leaders who seek greater stability \r\nfollowing elections. \r\n Based on its desire to strengthen the gains made \r\nin the area of democratization, the Government of Togo \r\nsupports the implementation of the recommendations \r\nmade by the European Union election observation \r\nmission, including institutional and constitutional \r\nreforms, especially against the backdrop of the local \r\nand legislative elections to be held in 2012. In that \r\nrespect, faithful to the policy of openness and \r\ncooperation initiated by our head of State, the \r\nGovernment has renewed its dialogue with all political \r\nand civic stakeholders under its permanent framework \r\nfor dialogue and cooperation in order to pursue \r\ndiscussions on all subjects concerning the management \r\nof governmental affairs. \r\n The Truth, Justice and Reconciliation \r\nCommission, launched two years ago with the task of \r\npromoting national reconciliation, is currently at the \r\ncritical stage of holding both public and closed \r\nhearings, according to witness preference. That is an \r\nopportunity for all Togolese men and women to talk to \r\neach other about the most painful moments of their \r\nhistory and to speak truthfully in order to ensure justice \r\nand reconciliation, thereby making it possible to turn \r\nthe page once and for all. \r\n In terms of human rights and fundamental \r\nfreedoms, the Government of Togo has made \r\ncommitments to increasing State capacities to protect \r\nindividuals and property and guarantee fundamental \r\nfreedoms in order to prevent Togo’s young democracy \r\nfrom losing ground with regard to the progress made in \r\nshaping its identity, as well as to avert any exploitation \r\nof differences. In that regard, Togo has just provided \r\nthe governing body of the Human Rights Council in \r\nGeneva with its national report in connection with the \r\nuniversal periodic review that will take place in a few \r\nweeks.  \r\n Togo would like to reaffirm its determination to \r\nhonour its international commitments. We will \r\ncontinue to combat all types of human rights violations \r\nand to take action against their perpetrators. My \r\ncountry will therefore tirelessly continue the work \r\nalready begun in order to strengthen the gains of \r\ndemocracy and peace, while making greater efforts to \r\nimplement the Millennium Development Goals. \r\n In terms of economic governance, Togo is \r\npursuing reforms for better management of its public \r\nfinances, in order to optimize domestic revenues. We \r\nare working for a more robust financial sector, \r\nprivatizing public banks, operationalizing the Court of \r\nAuditors and instituting a new public tendering code \r\nthat is fully aligned with international standards. All \r\nthat is in addition to the steps we have taken towards \r\nmembership in the Extractive Industries Transparency \r\nInitiative. Among other things, those various measures \r\nhave allowed us to successfully conclude our \r\nparticipation in the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries \r\nDebt Initiative and to benefit from about $1.8 billion in \r\ndebt cancellation. The broad ongoing programme to \r\nimprove and rehabilitate road infrastructure throughout \r\nour national territory is an illustration of the effective \r\nimplementation of this reform. On behalf of the \r\nGovernment and the people of Togo, I would like to \r\nthank all our partners that have assisted in our process \r\nto improve governance.  \r\n This meeting is taking place at a time when \r\nAfrica is again threatened by famine such as we have \r\nnot witnessed in 20 years. All countries, as well as the \r\nUnited Nations, must take urgent measures to confront \r\nthat exceptional situation if we wish to avoid a large-\r\nscale humanitarian tragedy. \r\n With respect to resolving conflict and promoting \r\npeace and security throughout the world, which is the \r\ntheme of this session, it is encouraging to note that \r\nsignificant progress has been made. That is particularly \r\nin the case in Africa, where peace and security have \r\nbeen restored in Côte d’Ivoire, thereby enabling the \r\nrelaunching of socio-economic activities in that \r\ncountry. \r\n The peaceful resolution of the lengthy conflict in \r\nSouth Sudan, which has become the Organization’s \r\n193rd Member State, gives us reason to hope that any \r\nconflict can be resolved acceptably and sustainably so \r\nA/66/PV.23  \r\n \r\n11-51372 24 \r\n \r\nlong as the parties concerned work in good faith to \r\nachieve that goal. \r\n Also as we meet here, parts of the world continue \r\nto face waves of demonstrations and uprisings, \r\nespecially in Africa. Those legitimate movements \r\ncontribute to the blossoming of democracy for the \r\npeople concerned. In addition to delivering on their \r\nlegitimate expectations, they also help to avoid any \r\nrisk of wavering in the medium term that might \r\njeopardize peace and national unity. That seems to be \r\ntrue for all conflicts, because we believe that no \r\nsustainable solution is possible outside of negotiation.  \r\n With regard to the Middle East, my country \r\ntherefore firmly believes that the parties to the Israeli-\r\nPalestinian conflict and the international community \r\nmust continue to seek a political solution to that old \r\nconflict. The Middle East must know peace. Israel and \r\nPalestine must coexist in two States with well-defined \r\nborders, in peace and security. We are fundamentally \r\nconvinced that the aspirations of the Palestinian people \r\nfor a national State and those of Israel for sustainable \r\npeace and security are not contradictory, but \r\ncomplementary, objectives.  \r\n Despite the many efforts and determination of the \r\nUnited Nations to eradicate terrorism in all its forms, \r\nthat scourge is gaining even more ground and is \r\ncompromising the chances for building a world of \r\npeace and security. This year, as we commemorate the \r\ntenth anniversary of the tragic attacks on 11 September \r\n2001, the international community and all States must \r\ncontinue to work synergistically so that humankind \r\nwill not again experience such indiscriminate and \r\nwanton attacks as those of 9/11 or those that recently \r\nvictimized the peaceful people of Norway and the \r\nheadquarters of the United Nations in Abuja. \r\n Those crises and conflicts, as well as new threats \r\nto international peace and security, such as maritime \r\npiracy, cyber crime and drug trafficking, which \r\nundermine efforts to build peace throughout the world, \r\nrequire the international community to rethink the role \r\nof the United Nations in the context of security and \r\nsocio-economic development. At a time when the West \r\nAfrican subregion is witnessing an increase in violence \r\ndue to drug trafficking and terrorism in the area, we \r\ncannot allow our shorelines to be taken hostage by \r\npirates, as was recently the case in the waters off Benin \r\nand Togo. I call for stricter cooperation among all \r\ncountries to effectively combat this new phenomenon.  \r\n As I just said we need to rethink the role of the \r\nUnited Nations. While it is widely acknowledged that \r\nnothing can replace the Organization, it is just as true \r\nthat, 65 years after it was established, the United \r\nNations needs to be reformed. My country therefore \r\ncalls on Member States to pursue and conclude the \r\nprocess of Security Council reform, which began more \r\nthan 15 years ago. Like the majority of Member States, \r\nTogo hopes that this General Assembly session will \r\nprovide us an opportunity to take decisive steps with \r\nregard to Council reform. In so doing, we have the \r\nopportunity to correct flagrant and unacceptable \r\ninjustices and to make the Security Council truly \r\nrepresentative of all the regions of the world, thereby \r\nmaking it better placed to resolve the crises and \r\nconflicts that we face. \r\n With regard to the process of replacing \r\nnon-permanent members of the Council, the Assembly \r\nwill elect five new members in October to replace \r\nthose whose terms will end on 31 December. Togo is \r\namong the candidates from the Group of African States \r\nthat are seeking the votes of Member States in those \r\nelections.  \r\n Contrary to the practice observed today in Africa \r\nwith respect to elections to the Security Council, three \r\ncandidates are in the running this year for the two seats \r\nthat go to Africa. Togo, whose candidacy enjoys the \r\nendorsement of the Economic Community of Western \r\nAfrican States and the African Union, of course \r\nattaches great importance to the sovereign right of each \r\nState to apply for a seat on any United Nations body. \r\nHowever, I would like to ask all delegations to bear in \r\nmind the need to see emerge, after the elections, a \r\nSecurity Council that is balanced and representative of \r\nall the major regions in Africa, especially West Africa. \r\n My country has participated in United Nations \r\npeacekeeping operations for many years. We are \r\ncurrently involved in the missions in Côte d’Ivoire and \r\nthe Sudan, and will soon participate in the one in South \r\nSudan. We wish to sit on the Council in order to make \r\na contribution, however modest, to the work of the \r\norgan responsible for the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security.  \r\n If elected, Togo will focus on the importance of \r\npreventive diplomacy in the peaceful settlement of \r\nconflicts and the link between peace and security, on \r\nthe one hand, and social justice and development, on \r\nthe other. We would also not neglect combating the \r\n A/66/PV.23\r\n \r\n25 11-51372 \r\n \r\nscourges to which I referred earlier, as well as new \r\nthreats to international peace and security.  \r\n Togo’s noble ambition can only come to pass if \r\nwe have the support of delegations for our candidacy. \r\nIt is my hope that all Member States will wish to \r\nprovide their invaluable support for our candidacy. I \r\nwish very much to thank them in advance for their \r\nsupport. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Primer Minister of the \r\nTogolese Republic, for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Gilbert Fossoun Houngbo, Primer Minister \r\nof the Togolese Republic, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by Michael Spindelegger Vice-\r\nChancellor and Federal Minister for  \r\nEuropean and International Affairs of the \r\nRepublic of Austria \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Vice-Chancellor and Federal \r\nMinister for European and International Affairs of the \r\nRepublic of Austria. \r\n Mr. Michael Spindelegger, Vice-Chancellor and \r\nFederal Minister for European and International \r\nAffairs of the Republic of Austria, was escorted to \r\nthe rostrum. \r\n The Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Michael Spindelegger, \r\nVice-Chancellor and Federal Minister for European \r\nand International Affairs of the Republic of Austria, \r\nand inviting him to address the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Spindelegger (Austria): This year has once \r\nagain confirmed the importance of the United Nations \r\nas the truly indispensable multilateral forum for \r\naddressing today’s global problems. The humanitarian \r\ncrisis in the Horn of Africa, ecological disasters such \r\nas Fukushima, political developments like the Arab \r\nSpring and terrorist attacks such as the assault on the \r\nUnited Nations building in Abuja last August require \r\nconcerted action by the United Nations and its Member \r\nStates. Ten years after 9/11, joint action in the fight \r\nagainst terrorism continues to remain central on the \r\nmultilateral agenda. \r\n In the past nine months, we have witnessed \r\nmomentous changes in the Arab world that nobody \r\nexpected when we met one year ago. Pressure for \r\nchange is driven by the wish of women and men to \r\nchoose their own fate and to improve their chances for \r\na better life. These are legitimate demands. An \r\noverwhelming number of young people were at the \r\nforefront of this enormous tide, which started in \r\nTunisia and Egypt. We should pay tribute to their \r\ncourage. \r\n In Libya, thousands lost their lives in the struggle \r\nfor freedom and democracy. In Syria, and to some \r\nextent in Yemen, the suppression is ongoing. Austria \r\nstrongly condemns the systematic human rights \r\nviolations and the violence against peaceful \r\ndemonstrators. We strongly urge those responsible to \r\nimmediately stop the bloodshed and to engage in \r\nmeaningful dialogue and reforms. Austria supports the \r\nLibyan people in its struggle for freedom. Over \r\n€150 million blocked in Austrian bank accounts has \r\nbeen de-frozen for humanitarian use. Both the Austrian \r\nGovernment and private sector have provided \r\nmedicine, relief supplies and desperately needed fuel to \r\nLibya. \r\n The international community and the United \r\nNations have to support and assist the transition \r\nprocess in the Arab world as the United Nations does \r\nnow in Libya. This period of change may last for some \r\ntime and will be full of challenges. Austria welcomes \r\nall efforts undertaken by Governments in the region for \r\npeaceful and credible change. We encourage the newly \r\nempowered authorities to create a constitutional \r\nframework based on democracy and human rights, in \r\norder to fulfil their mandate for democratic change \r\nresponsibly and peacefully. \r\n The events in the Arab world notwithstanding, we \r\nmust continue to focus on the Middle East peace \r\nprocess. The Middle East took centre stage this week \r\nhere at the General Assembly — and rightly so. We \r\nmust build trust and we have to foster the belief among \r\nIsraelis and Palestinians that a negotiated settlement \r\ncan be achieved — a sustainable solution based on two \r\nStates living side by side in a secure and peaceful \r\nneighbourhood within mutually recognized borders. \r\nWe have no choice but to return to direct negotiations \r\nbetween the two parties. The Quartet, in its statement \r\nyesterday, has shown a way to do that and has also \r\nproposed concrete timelines. Austria fully supports the \r\nQuartet statement. There is no time to lose. \r\nA/66/PV.23  \r\n \r\n11-51372 26 \r\n \r\n Austria welcomes President Al-Nasser’s choice of \r\ntheme for this year’s general debate. We appreciate \r\nQatar’s strong track record in that regard.  \r\n Last year’s tenth anniversary of the adoption of \r\nSecurity Council resolution 1325 (2000) on women, \r\npeace and security reminded us that the promise of \r\nwomen’s full and equal participation in all efforts of \r\nmaintaining peace and security, including in mediation \r\nprocesses, has not yet come true and that we all need to \r\nintensify our efforts. \r\n In that context, let me also mention an Austrian \r\ncontribution to international mediation efforts. By \r\ninviting political decision-makers from both Khartoum \r\nand Juba to Vienna in recent years, Austria has \r\nmanaged to offer the two sides a platform for \r\ndiscussion. We are ready to continue to do so. The \r\nSudan and South Sudan have a shared past and must \r\nresolve their remaining problems peacefully. \r\n The United Nations headquarters in Vienna \r\nserves as a dynamic hub for the promotion of peace, \r\nsecurity and sustainable development. I am proud to \r\nannounce that a liaison office of the United Nations \r\nOffice for Disarmament Affairs will open in Vienna soon. \r\nOver the past year, the International Anti-Corruption \r\nAcademy set up its headquarters near Vienna, and the \r\nVienna Centre for Disarmament and Non-Proliferation \r\nand an office of the International Peace Institute were \r\nestablished. \r\n Austria fully stands behind the campaign \r\nlaunched by the Secretary-General on Monday to \r\nachieve universal access to modern energy services. \r\nWe support doubling the rate of improvement in energy \r\nefficiency and the share of renewable energy in the \r\nglobal energy mix by 2030. Austria provides \r\nsubstantial support to the energy and environment \r\nefforts undertaken by the United Nations Industrial \r\nDevelopment Organization. Last June, we hosted the \r\nVienna Energy Forum, where about 1,400 participants \r\ndiscussed alternative energy concepts to reach the \r\nenergy goals of the United Nations. \r\n The Fukushima nuclear catastrophe should \r\nbecome a turning point in our approach to nuclear \r\nsafety. We owe it to future generations to make safety \r\nconcerns come first when using nuclear power. Austria \r\ndecided, in 1978, to forgo the use of nuclear energy. \r\nSome countries have recently adopted a similar course, \r\nwhich we welcome. \r\n The last time I spoke at the United Nations, it \r\nwas during the thematic debate held in April on the \r\nrule of law and global challenges. That was an \r\nimportant step in the preparation of the high-level \r\nmeeting on the rule of law that will take place in \r\nSeptember 2012. Next year’s meeting will provide an \r\nimportant opportunity to renew the efforts of both the \r\nUnited Nations and Member States to promote the rule \r\nof law. As a medium-sized country and as a strong \r\nsupporter of multilateralism, Austria attaches particular \r\nimportance to the rule of law, including at the \r\ninternational level. The international system can only \r\nproperly function if it based on clear and predictable \r\nrules that apply equally to all Member States. \r\n The promotion and protection of human rights is \r\na core priority of Austria’s foreign policy. We are proud \r\nto serve on the Human Rights Council for the period \r\n2011-2014. For our membership in this body, Austria \r\nhas identified the following priorities, on which we \r\nwill take action. \r\n Austria is firmly committed to respect for \r\nfreedom of religion and belief. We are deeply troubled \r\nby recurring attacks against religious minorities in all \r\nparts of the world and among all religions. To foster \r\ntolerance, Austria has hosted a number of high-level \r\ndialogues between religious and secular leaders over \r\nthe past decade. We think that that has become a new \r\nand promising field of modern diplomacy, putting the \r\nemphasis on conflict prevention. \r\n Various forms of child trafficking and \r\nexploitation constitute gross violations of children’s \r\nrights. As a member of the Human Rights Council, \r\nAustria will work to address that issue and to help \r\ndevelop counter-strategies. We highly appreciate the \r\nwork of the Special Representative of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for Children and Armed Conflict, Ms. Radhika \r\nCoomaraswamy, and we strongly support the renewal \r\nof her mandate. \r\n Racism, xenophobia and discrimination on the \r\ngrounds of ethnic origin, gender, age, sexual \r\norientation and religious belief are ongoing challenges \r\nand of concern to all of us. Austria is committed to the \r\nfight against those abuses, including anti-Semitism. \r\nTherefore, we will continue to press for action, \r\nincluding in the framework of the United Nations. We \r\nwill also take initiatives during our membership in the \r\nHuman Rights Council to strengthen the protection of \r\njournalists against all forms of threat and intimidation. \r\n A/66/PV.23\r\n \r\n27 11-51372 \r\n \r\n Austria has a 50-year-long track record of \r\ncontributing to United Nations peacekeeping \r\noperations. And we will continue our engagement. We \r\nrecently decided to deploy 160 Austrian troops to the \r\nUnited Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), in \r\naddition to our continued presence in the United \r\nNations Disengagement Observer Force and the United \r\nNations Truce Supervision Organization. Through its \r\nparticipation in UNIFIL, Austria wishes to make an \r\nactive contribution to the maintenance of peace and \r\nsecurity not only in Lebanon but in the region as a \r\nwhole. \r\n Austria welcomes the positive momentum in \r\ninternational security policy over the past couple of \r\nyears. We salute the Secretary-General’s determined \r\nleadership, including his five-point plan on \r\ndisarmament. We look forward to continuing our work \r\nin this positive spirit at the first meeting of the \r\nPreparatory Committee for the Review Conference on \r\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \r\nWeapons, to be held in Vienna in May of next year. \r\nWe, and hope for progress with regard to the \r\nestablishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the \r\nMiddle East. \r\n Nevertheless, despite our collective efforts, we \r\nhave not been able to move forward on new  \r\n \r\ndisarmament and arms control issues. The multilateral \r\nmachinery, and in particular the Conference on \r\nDisarmament, remains deadlocked. Unfortunately, the \r\nmomentum that we had hoped to generate over the past \r\nyear has not materialized. Therefore, in Austria’s view, \r\nthe Conference on Disarmament has not only lost its \r\ncredibility, it is also risking its legitimacy. Austria will \r\ntherefore encourage the adoption of a draft resolution, \r\nat the next session of the First Committee, on how to \r\nmove multilateral disarmament negotiations forward. \r\n Austria remains committed to multilateralism and \r\nto the United Nations as the noblest form of \r\ninternational cooperation. We will therefore support the \r\nefforts of the President and the Secretary-General to \r\nfurther strengthen the Organization in order to better \r\nenable us to face the challenges of our time. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Vice-Chancellor and \r\nFederal Minister for European and International Affairs \r\nof Austria for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Michael Spindelegger, Vice-Chancellor and \r\nFederal Minister for European and International \r\nAffairs of the Federal Republic of Austria, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum. \r\n  The meeting rose at 6.10 p.m. \r\n"
