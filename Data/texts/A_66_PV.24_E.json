(Qatar) \r\n \r\n \r\n In the absence of the President, Mr. Mayr-\r\nHarting (Austria), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 6.10 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 8 (continued) \r\n \r\nGeneral debate \r\n \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Jean Asselborn, Deputy Prime Minister \r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Grand Duchy of \r\nLuxembourg. \r\n Mr. Asselborn (Luxembourg) (spoke in French): \r\nLuxembourg is very pleased that the President of the \r\nEuropean Council, Herman Van Rompuy, was able for \r\nthe first time to address this Assembly on behalf of the \r\nEuropean Union (see A/66/PV.15), and I align myself \r\nfully with his statement. \r\n Never before has the United Nations been so \r\nindispensable; never before have expectations of it \r\nbeen so great. We are going through a period of great \r\nturbulence; a period, as the Secretary-General has said, \r\nburdened by great difficulties, but also rich in \r\nopportunity for the progress of humankind. It is our \r\nduty to respond to the expectations placed on us by all \r\nthose across the world who seek peace, security and \r\ndignity. \r\n On 9 July 2011 a new State was born before the \r\neyes of the entire world. In January, during their \r\nreferendum on independence, the people of South \r\nSudan spoke loudly and clearly. More than 98 per cent \r\nof the electorate voted for the independence to which \r\nthe southern part of Africa’s largest country had \r\naspired for so long. Luxembourg is proud to have \r\nrecognized South Sudan on 9 July, even before the \r\nhistoric moment of its admission to the United Nations. \r\n The independence of South Sudan is a testament \r\nto the willingness of the two parties in the long \r\nSudanese conflict to implement the Comprehensive \r\nPeace Agreement. It is now up to both parties to show \r\nthe same willingness to implement new agreements to \r\naddress the issues of good-neighbourly relations \r\nbetween the Sudan and South Sudan. The two Sudans, \r\nand their peoples first of all, will benefit if the \r\nrelationship finally becomes a constructive one, \r\nallowing for socio-economic development on a new \r\nbasis.  \r\n The international community stands ready to \r\nsupport both countries. The development of the Sudan \r\nand support of the new State of South Sudan on its path \r\nto viability, stability and prosperity are tasks that we \r\nmust all tackle together and cooperatively. The \r\nEuropean Union is actively engaged. Luxembourg fully \r\nsupports its efforts and is also committed bilaterally, \r\nparticularly regarding demining activities to help \r\nremove the vestiges of a war that was so long that it \r\nhas marked several generations of Sudanese. \r\n A few days ago, in recognizing the full powers of \r\nLibya’s National Transitional Council, the Assembly \r\nblessed, in a way, the end of Colonel Al-Qadhafi’s \r\ndictatorial regime, one that suffocated the whole of \r\nLibyan society for 42 years and did not hesitate to use \r\nA/66/PV.24  \r\n \r\n11-51378 2 \r\n \r\nheavy weapons against its own population without \r\ndiscrimination, trampling on its people’s aspirations for \r\nfreedom. \r\n The international community had to react, to \r\nassume its responsibility to protect Libyan men, \r\nwomen and children who were under fire — and who, \r\nunfortunately, are still under fire in Sirte and Bani \r\nWalid. We did not want to reproach ourselves yet again \r\nfor having hesitated too long, for having neglected our \r\nresponsibility to protect those unable to defend \r\nthemselves against the cruelty of their own authorities. \r\nWe did not want once again to be the powerless \r\nwitnesses of large-scale violence.  \r\n Our Organization was able to react and \r\ndemonstrate its capacity to act in a decisive, timely and \r\njust manner. The General Assembly suspended Libya \r\nfrom the Human Rights Council. Acting within the \r\nremit of Chapter VII of the Charter, the Security \r\nCouncil authorized all measures necessary to protect \r\nthe population and civilian areas under threat of attack. \r\nThe Council was able to act so decisively because the \r\ninternational community, and the region in particular, \r\nsupported its action. The Arab League played a very \r\nimportant role in this regard, which I heartily \r\ncommend. \r\n Today, thanks to their courage and the resolute \r\nsupport of the international community, the Libyan \r\npeople are free to choose their future. Together with \r\nour European Union partners, we stand ready to \r\nsupport Libya on its path to democracy and to help the \r\nNational Transitional Council in its immense task of \r\nestablishing a new State, in which human rights are \r\nrespected and every element of society can find a \r\nplace. As Mr. Jean Ping, who was President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-ninth session, put it so \r\nwell in Paris on 1 September, Africa will benefit \r\nenormously from the emergence of a democratic Libya, \r\nat peace with itself and with its neighbours. We will all \r\nbenefit from it. \r\n In Tunisia and in Egypt, the people have also \r\nprevailed in their quests for liberty and the rewriting of \r\nthe social contract, in the face of the supporters of their \r\nformer regimes. In other countries in the region, people \r\nmust, alas, continue to struggle to achieve respect for \r\ntheir fundamental freedoms.  \r\n In Syria, the regime continues to conduct a brutal \r\ncampaign against its own population. Every appeal, \r\nincluding that of the Secretary-General, to end the \r\nviolence and repression has so far remained \r\nunanswered. As the Human Rights Council on \r\n23 August decided, commendably, to send urgently an \r\nindependent international commission of inquiry to \r\nSyria, the Security Council should also assume its \r\nresponsibility in the matter. The credibility of the \r\nUnited Nations as a moral force, one that protects \r\ncivilian populations and their rights, is at stake. \r\nEqually at stake is the capacity of the United Nations \r\nto be present in crises, revolts and disasters that assault \r\npeoples’ dignity and threaten their very existence. \r\n Peace, security, dignity — these are also key \r\nwords when we talk about the Israeli-Palestinian \r\nconflict: the right of two peoples to live in peace, \r\nsecurity and dignity.  \r\n A solution to this conflict, which has lasted too \r\nlong and has poisoned the entire region, must \r\nnecessarily be reached through the recognition of the \r\nright of both parties — not just one of them — to live \r\nin a sovereign and viable State. This is unfortunately \r\nnot yet the case, despite the hope inspired by the \r\ncourageous words of President Obama at this very \r\nrostrum last year (see A/65/PV.11). On the contrary, we \r\nhave seen neither a halt to the illegal construction of \r\nsettlements, nor a significant lifting of the embargo on \r\nthe Gaza strip. The revival of direct peace talks was \r\nshort-lived. \r\n We all heard Palestinian President Mahmoud \r\nAbbas’s vibrant appeal yesterday, his call for \r\nrecognition of the his people’s legitimate right to a \r\nState and for acceptance of the aspirations of Palestine \r\nto have a seat in the Assembly and to fully assume its \r\nplace among the nations of the world. I can only hope \r\nthat his appeal will be heard. Israel’s legitimate desire \r\nto live for the long term in security depends on the \r\nrealization of the right of the Palestinians to live in \r\ndignity in their sovereign State. \r\n But merely responding to this appeal is not \r\nenough. It is imperative that negotiations between the \r\ntwo parties start again as soon as possible. Only \r\nnegotiations will allow tackling the root causes of the \r\nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict. The parameters for a \r\nsettlement have been known for a long time. I fully \r\nsupport the proposal made yesterday by the Quartet for \r\na strict timetable: one month to agree on the agenda \r\nand modalities of the negotiations, and no more than a \r\nyear to reach a comprehensive agreement.  \r\n A/66/PV.24\r\n \r\n3 11-51378 \r\n \r\n I appeal to the parties to show proof of their \r\npolitical will and ability to make the necessary \r\ncompromises and sacrifices so that by the end of 2012 \r\npeace in the Middle East finally becomes a reality. \r\nFrom this rostrum, I reiterate firmly that the restart of \r\nnegotiations cannot again stumble over cement and \r\nstones, and I dare believe that the Israeli Government \r\nknows that. In their efforts both now and in the future, \r\nthe parties can count on the nations of the European \r\nUnion, including my country, Luxembourg. \r\n The events over the past year in North Africa, the \r\nMiddle East and sub-Saharan Africa remind us of the \r\nimportance of a United Nations Organization with solid \r\nmeans for prevention and mediation, for peacekeeping \r\nand peacebuilding. Conflict prevention is one of the \r\nprincipal obligations set out in the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations. Primary responsibility for that belongs \r\nto Member States, but no State can act alone. Each \r\nmust be able to count on the support of the rest.  \r\n At the 2005 World Summit, we all committed to \r\npromoting a culture of prevention, and we put in place \r\nimportant new tools and mechanisms. The \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, by uniting all concerned \r\nactors and formulating integrated strategies, is an \r\nessential element of these. \r\n My country is deeply convinced of the relevance \r\nof a broad and multidimensional approach to \r\npeacebuilding. Luxembourg is proud to be an active \r\ncontributor to the work of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission, notably as Chair of the country-specific \r\nconfiguration for Guinea established this February. Our \r\npriority is to support the authorities in Conakry in the \r\nareas of national reconciliation, security sector reform \r\nand employment for women and young people. Since \r\n2010 Luxembourg, in its national capacity, has been \r\nsupporting mediation conducted by the Community of \r\nSant’Egidio between the main political and civil \r\nsociety actors in Guinea. \r\n Both at the bilateral level and in its capacity as a \r\nmember of the European Union, Luxembourg sees \r\nconflict prevention and providing support in post-\r\nconflict situations as being at the heart of its activity \r\nabroad, primarily through multilateral instruments, \r\nwith the United Nations, naturally, first and foremost \r\namong them. The challenges we face are not limited to \r\npolitical conflicts but also concern economic, social \r\nand environmental transformation.  \r\n Let us remember that the Arab Spring began with \r\nan act of social protest. We therefore agree entirely \r\nwith the priority that the President intends to give \r\nduring his mandate to sustainable development, \r\npoverty eradication and achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. \r\n With our European Union partners, we will do \r\neverything in our power to contribute ensuring that the \r\nUnited Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (Rio+20), which will take place in Brazil \r\nless than a year from now, in June 2012, is truly \r\nsuccessful. Rio+20 must set a range of ambitious goals \r\nthat will ensure that we stay on track with sustainable \r\ndevelopment and preserve future generations’ ability to \r\nlive on our planet.  \r\n Sustainable development, in its three elements — \r\neconomic, social and environmental — has long been \r\nat the centre of Luxembourg’s development \r\ncooperation policy. I am happy to say that Luxembourg \r\nhas managed to maintain and even increase its efforts \r\nin terms of official development assistance, which in \r\n2010 reached 1.09 per cent of our gross national \r\nproduct. \r\n We no longer need to prove the close link \r\nbetween security and development. For Luxembourg, \r\nthe links between security and climate change are \r\nequally obvious. As the Secretary-General observed, \r\nclimate change must be seen as a threat multiplier. \r\nLuxembourg’s commitment to combating climate \r\nchange, including through the Group of Friends created \r\nhere in New York for that purpose, is also part of our \r\nstrategy for preventing conflicts before climate change \r\nmakes them worse. In that context, my country offers \r\nsupport and technical assistance to small island \r\ndeveloping States, particularly those in the Pacific, \r\nwhose existence is threatened by climate change. \r\n Since the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, \r\nLuxembourg, together with its European partners, has \r\nmade binding commitments to reduce its carbon \r\nemissions and mitigate the effects of climate change. \r\nLuxembourg is also contributing to the fast start \r\nfinance initiative in order to tackle climate change. I \r\nshould stress that these resources are new and \r\nadditional to our official development assistance. \r\n Among the numerous other challenges that \r\nrequire a coordinated and collective response, I should \r\nlike to mention one in particular: the prevention and \r\ncontrol of non-communicable diseases. Non-communicable \r\nA/66/PV.24  \r\n \r\n11-51378 4 \r\n \r\ndiseases not only cost 36 million human lives every year; \r\nthey also result in significant losses to national revenue \r\nand pull millions of people below the poverty line. \r\nThey affect all of us and are having an increasingly \r\npreponderant impact on developing countries. The \r\nresponse to this challenge of epidemic proportions \r\nmust be global and universal. \r\n I therefore commend the initiative on the part of \r\nthe Caribbean Community countries to put this subject \r\non the General Assembly’s agenda and to publicize, \r\nbeyond the medical community, the scope and impact \r\nof the crisis in non-communicable diseases, including \r\nin development terms. There is no question that the \r\ndebate in the High-level Meeting on the Prevention and \r\nControl of Non-communicable Diseases, the round \r\ntables and the various side events held in the last few \r\ndays have allowed us to reach that goal. We should \r\nnow fully implement the commitments undertaken in \r\nthe Political Declaration (resolution 66/2, annex). I can \r\nassure the Assembly that Luxembourg will continue its \r\nefforts to that end at the national, regional and \r\ninternational levels. \r\n Mr. Allam-mi (Chad), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n The terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, \r\nwhose tenth anniversary we have just commemorated, \r\nwere attacks against not only the United States, the \r\nhost country of our Organization, but against all of us, \r\nagainst our values and principles, our convictions and \r\nbeliefs. Our Organization itself has become the target \r\nof cowardly attacks. Such despicable acts must not, \r\nhowever, lead us to turn inward. On the contrary, they \r\nshould encourage us to redouble efforts to continue to \r\nact together in furthering the ideals and values of our \r\nOrganization and its Charter, to fight together against \r\nterrorism and for a better and safer future for \r\ngenerations to come, for development and respect for \r\nhuman rights, for democracy and the rule of law. That \r\nis our joint responsibility: the responsibility to prevent, \r\nto preserve and to protect. \r\n Luxembourg stands ready to shoulder its \r\nresponsibilities and to continue to work for an effective \r\nmultilateralism, including — if the Assembly affords \r\nus the opportunity — as a non-permanent member of \r\nthe Security Council in 2013-2014. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Steven Vanackere, Deputy \r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs and \r\nInstitutional Reform of the Kingdom of Belgium. \r\n Mr. Vanackere (Belgium): Twelve months ago, I \r\nstood here and insisted upon the importance of the \r\nprinciple of accountability. This year there is even \r\nmore reason to underscore this core value in national \r\nand international politics. \r\n In several countries of the Arab world — in \r\nTunisia, Egypt, Morocco, Libya, Syria, Yemen and \r\nelsewhere — people are transforming the outlook of \r\ntheir societies, moving towards more accountable \r\nleadership. \r\n On the African continent, in Côte d’Ivoire a \r\nleader who repeatedly plunged his country into \r\nviolence did not stand the test of democratic \r\nlegitimacy. With parliamentary elections scheduled to \r\ntake place later this year, Côte d’Ivoire is now ready to \r\nmake a fresh start. \r\n And in Europe the arrest of Ratko Mladić \r\nconfirms what leaders should know all too well: that \r\nwar crimes will not remain unpunished for ever, that \r\nthis world will not accept impunity. \r\n The past year has shown that, more than ever, \r\nhistory is on the side of those who, worldwide, strive \r\nfor more accountability. They will find Belgium on \r\ntheir side. \r\n Accountability means first of all legal \r\naccountability: the obligation to implement \r\ninternational treaties and to respect international law. A \r\nformer Nuremberg prosecutor, Benjamin Ferencz, \r\nstated, “There can be no peace without justice, no \r\njustice without law and no meaningful law without a \r\nCourt to decide what is just and lawful under any given \r\ncircumstance”. \r\n Some of the examples I have just mentioned \r\nillustrate that all too well. Ratko Mladić is on trial in \r\nThe Hague. Mass atrocities committed in Côte d’Ivoire \r\nand Libya have been referred to the International \r\nCriminal Court. \r\n From this place, I would like to launch a strong \r\nappeal to those Member States that have not yet done \r\nso to adhere to and shoulder the Rome Statute, as a \r\ncontribution to a sustainable and accountable \r\ninternational legal system. \r\n But accountability is of course much broader. It \r\nalso implies political accountability. Governments, \r\n A/66/PV.24\r\n \r\n5 11-51378 \r\n \r\npoliticians and civil servants are accountable and \r\nresponsible to their citizens, be it through the ballot \r\nbox or through constructive engagement with \r\nrepresentative organizations. \r\n Let me be frank: this is also a challenge in the \r\ncontinent I come from, Europe. We, as European \r\nleaders, should not run away from the obligation of \r\nbeing accountable to the people we represent. In the \r\nDurban spirit of non-discrimination, let me add: \r\naccountable to all the people, regardless of their ethnic \r\nbackground, their religion or belief, their gender, \r\nsexual orientation or social position. \r\n Worldwide, the challenges are sometimes of a \r\ndifferent order. Let us be clear. Leaders who believe \r\nthat they can cling to power through terror and \r\nsuppression make a cruel mistake. Leaders who believe \r\nthat pointing guns at their own people, that sending \r\ndeath squads on to the streets, that stoning women to \r\ndeath is acceptable, have lost touch with humankind \r\nand are bound to lose all support, not only from their \r\nown people but also from the world. \r\n Warlords who think that they can get away with \r\nsexual abuse of women and recruiting child soldiers \r\nshould be stopped and held accountable by a united \r\nand firm international community. \r\n Belgium will not stand idly by when people claim \r\na future free of coercion and terror. Instead of \r\nnon-interference, Belgium believes in non-indifference. \r\nSovereignty cannot be a wall that leaders can use to \r\nviolate the rights of their citizens. Sovereignty cannot \r\nbe used as an excuse to run away from the \r\nresponsibility to protect their people. \r\n This is one of the main lessons that I draw from \r\nrecent events in the Arab world: that democracy and \r\naccountability are of a universal nature; that they \r\ncannot be claimed, and should not be claimed, by any \r\nnation or group of nations.  \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n Take the case of Libya, where the Security \r\nCouncil was able to prevent a massacre in Benghazi. \r\nBelgium decided, with almost unanimous support in \r\nParliament, to take part in the military Operation \r\nUnified Protector, assuming the risk and the cost.  \r\n That was because Belgium is convinced that the \r\ninternational community has the responsibility to take \r\naction when populations are exposed to imminent \r\ndanger. Molière said long ago that we are responsible \r\nnot only for what we do, but for what we do not do.  \r\n Today, now that the immediate danger is fading, \r\nthe international community has a responsibility to \r\nhelp in the reconstruction of Libya. Let us not forget \r\nthat that responsibility is an integral part of the \r\nresponsibility to protect. Belgium will contribute.  \r\n Let us look at the rest of the African continent, \r\nwhose peoples want their voice to be heard through \r\nfree and fair elections. In that context, I wish to make \r\nspecific mention of the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo, where, after years of violence, undeniable \r\nprogress has been made.  \r\n The important part played by the United Nations, \r\nand in particular by the United Nations Organization \r\nStabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo, cannot be ignored.  \r\n There are still significant challenges to be \r\novercome. They include the continuation and \r\nstrengthening of stabilization efforts in the east of \r\ncountry, the reform of the security sector, the \r\nestablishment of the rule of law and countering \r\nimpunity and sexual violence.  \r\n Those are essential ingredients in the \r\nconsolidation of democracy. The 2006 elections put the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo on the road to \r\ndemocracy. The elections to be held at the end of \r\nNovember should confirm that the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo is ready once and for all to \r\nmove on from its bloody past.  \r\n As an important partner of the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo, my Government is contributing \r\nfinancially to the preparations for the elections, and \r\ndemands that every candidate and every citizen be able \r\nto participate peacefully and with full respect for \r\ndemocratic rules.  \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n Let us finally look at the Middle East, a conflict \r\nregion that has this week received much attention here \r\nin the Hall. Dag Hammarskjöld, to whom this week is \r\ndedicated and who himself devoted much of his effort \r\nto finding a lasting peace in that region, said more than \r\nhalf a century ago: “The building of a firm bridge … \r\nover which you can pass without any difficulties may \r\nbe a long story”. More than 50 years later, we still do \r\nnot have such a “firm bridge”. That is not acceptable.  \r\nA/66/PV.24  \r\n \r\n11-51378 6 \r\n \r\n The parameters of a sustainable solution are well \r\nknown. Both the Palestinian and Israeli peoples have \r\nlegitimate aspirations. People want statehood. People \r\nwant to live in peace and security. These were the \r\nmessages that President Abbas and Prime Minister \r\nNetanyahu brought us yesterday. It must be possible to \r\nsatisfy both legitimate needs. \r\n Over the past few months, the European Union \r\nand its High Representative have spared no effort to \r\nget a process of negotiations started. There is no \r\nalternative to negotiations, however difficult and risky \r\nthe path may be. It is therefore my sincere hope that \r\nthe steps proposed by the Quartet yesterday will be \r\nfully implemented. \r\n It is also clear that the Palestinian Authority has \r\nsuccessfully progressed on the road to statehood, also \r\nthanks to the important and sustained contributions by \r\nthe European Union and by Belgium, and that it has \r\nnow reached a level of statehood that the world cannot \r\nignore. \r\n Now is the time to show leadership. After all, that \r\nis what accountability towards the people of the region \r\nis all about. \r\n Many have said it before: the global challenges \r\nwe face are multiple. They range from terrorism to \r\nclimate change and sustainable development — in \r\nwhich regard the upcoming United Nations Conference \r\non Sustainable Development will ask a lot of our \r\nenergy and creativity in the months ahead; from \r\nfinancial turmoil to terrible humanitarian tragedies like \r\nthe one in the Horn of Africa; from banning cluster \r\nmunitions to curbing nuclear proliferation, notably in \r\nNorth Korea and Iran; from guaranteeing the \r\nresponsible and transparent exploitation of natural \r\nresources through schemes such as the Kimberley \r\nProcess; through to fully implementing the indicators \r\nof the landmark Security Council resolution 1325 \r\n(2000) on women, peace and security. \r\n For Belgium, the only way to address those \r\nchallenges is through a multilateral approach. No \r\ncountry, however big or important, is capable of \r\ntackling global challenges alone. No country, however \r\nmodest in size it may be, should think that it cannot be \r\npart of the solution. \r\n Multilateralism is not about blocking solutions. It \r\nshould lead to change, and should have at its centre the \r\nUnited Nations, which indeed has proved its added \r\nvalue in so many fields. Let me mention just one such \r\nfield to which Belgium attaches particular importance: \r\ninternational conflict mediation. \r\n When the Secretary-General addressed us earlier \r\nthis week he mentioned Guinea, Kenya and Kyrgyzstan \r\nas United Nations mediation successes. The list is \r\nundoubtedly longer, but so are the needs. I am \r\ntherefore grateful to the President of the General \r\nAssembly for choosing mediation as a central theme \r\nfor our debate. I strongly believe that the United \r\nNations should continue to invest in strengthening its \r\nmediation capacities. \r\n I am proud to announce that Belgium has decided \r\nto financially support the United Nations Mediation \r\nSupport Unit and to actively engage with the President \r\nand with other Governments and non-governmental \r\nstakeholders to strengthen the role of United Nations \r\nmediation efforts. \r\n Some say that the United Nations is losing its \r\npower as a global platform for discussion and decision-\r\nmaking. Some say that global trends point towards a \r\nmore fragmented structure of global governance. I do \r\nnot think that that is true. I would certainly not think \r\nthat it was desirable. \r\n Belgium remains a staunch supporter of the \r\nUnited Nations. Our current engagement in the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission and our bid for a \r\nnon-permanent seat on the Security Council for the \r\nperiod 2019-2020 show our willingness to play our role \r\nin the United Nations. \r\n Today I am also proud to introduce Belgium’s \r\ncandidacy for the Human Rights Council for the period \r\n2015-2018, to add our voice to those who fight \r\nimpunity and discrimination; to give a voice to those \r\nmen, women and children who worldwide see their \r\nrights curtailed; to turn the principle of non-\r\nindifference into a living reality. That is not for the \r\nsake of ourselves, but for the sake of those to whom we \r\nare accountable. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Sam Terrence Condor, \r\nDeputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of Saint Kitts and Nevis. \r\n Mr. Condor (Saint Kitts and Nevis): I wish, on \r\nbehalf of the Government and people of Saint Kitts and \r\nNevis, to express gratitude for the honour of addressing \r\nthe General Assembly. I also extend on their behalf \r\n A/66/PV.24\r\n \r\n7 11-51378 \r\n \r\nsincere congratulations to Mr. Nassir Abdul-Aziz \r\nAl-Nasser on his election to preside over the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-sixth session. My delegation also \r\nwishes to thank Mr. Joseph Deiss, President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-fifth session, for his \r\nleadership during a very busy and demanding session. \r\n Our new President’s tenure coincides with a time \r\nwhen there is on the Assembly’s agenda a confluence \r\nof global issues with particular relevance for the small \r\nisland developing States of the Caribbean. \r\n Most delegations recently participated, for \r\nexample, in the United Nations High-level Meeting on \r\nHIV/AIDS, held in June; the United Nations High-\r\nlevel Meeting on Youth, held in July; and the United \r\nNations High-level Meeting on Non-communicable \r\nDiseases, held a few days ago. The convening of those \r\nmeetings gives ample acknowledgement of the \r\nchallenges that we still face in our relentless pursuit of \r\na healthier world, and of the pivotal role of health and \r\nsocial cohesion as vehicles of national and global \r\ndevelopment. \r\n The President has the awesome responsibility of \r\npiloting us through follow-up actions resulting from \r\nthose weighty deliberations. My delegation is confident \r\nof his capacity and experience for the required \r\nleadership, and assures him of our fullest support. \r\n The President has declared as his theme for the \r\nsession “The role of mediation in the settlement of \r\ndisputes by peaceful means”. Certainly, my delegation \r\nsupports the pacific settlement of disputes, and we \r\nlikewise acknowledge mediation as a preferred vehicle \r\nin preventing or settling conflicts. \r\n In this endeavour, our small island Caribbean \r\nStates would wish to be engaged in the support \r\nmechanisms in tangible ways, such as are already laid \r\nout in the provisions of such landmark resolutions as \r\nSecurity Council resolution 1540 (2004), which \r\naddresses the non-proliferation of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction. \r\n The people of my country and my region have \r\ngreat respect for the idealism that gave birth to this all-\r\nimportant Organization. Our ideals are indeed \r\nsynonymous with those of the United Nations system, \r\nand our expectations are assuredly no less stately than \r\nthose of large and powerful nations. \r\n At a time such as this, the United Nations must \r\nshow its unifying character by assuring that all \r\nMember States are equipped to play a role in the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security and in \r\nthe building up of one another. We are our brother’s \r\nkeeper. \r\n In today’s global community, we must rely \r\nheavily on collective actions and solid partnerships, if \r\nwe are to overcome the many common challenges that \r\nwe face. Among those challenges are the misguided or \r\nill-considered choices that are made by too many of \r\nour youth. \r\n A critical and defining aspect of my country’s \r\nfuture, and indeed a prospect that will largely define \r\ntomorrow’s world, is our youth. It is therefore worthy \r\nof mention that youth violence has attained epidemic \r\nproportions in the Caribbean. We appreciate that youth \r\nviolence is invariably symptomatic of deeper \r\nindividual, community and societal issues, and that a \r\nmultisectoral, integrated approach is required to \r\nredress the problem. \r\n At the national and regional levels, States of the \r\nCaribbean Community (CARICOM) are actively \r\ngrappling with this challenge, and we are pleased to \r\nhave participated in the discussions on this topic at the \r\nrecent High-level Meeting. There is a need, however, \r\nto reinforce the fact that there is a role for United \r\nNations agencies in supporting our efforts to reverse \r\nthe bothersome trend of youth violence, with all its \r\nimplications for many critical sectors, including \r\nsecurity, health and development. \r\n Accordingly, we shall be heightening our \r\nengagement with WHO, UN-HABITAT, UNICEF and \r\nother relevant United Nations and international \r\ndevelopment agencies in this endeavour. \r\n The challenge of youth violence is also linked, to \r\nsome extent, to the proliferation of small arms and \r\nlight weapons. While my country acknowledges the \r\nstrides made in our region with respect to small arms \r\nand light weapons, through the recent adoption of the \r\nCARICOM Declaration on Small Arms and Light \r\nWeapons, there is still a long way to go. It is \r\nimperative, therefore, that we work together to bring a \r\nsolution-focused approach to the problem of easy \r\naccess to small arms and light weapons in our \r\ncountries. CARICOM here calls for an arms trade \r\ntreaty. \r\n Related to this challenge is the issue of human \r\nsecurity and development. My country is committed to \r\nA/66/PV.24  \r\n \r\n11-51378 8 \r\n \r\nworking diligently at the national and regional levels, \r\nand to collaborating internationally, to improve the \r\nlives of our people. \r\n Saint Kitts and Nevis is a relatively small \r\ncountry, and it is usually the small and vulnerable that \r\nare most severely impacted when global shocks and \r\ncrises occur. That is why, as a region, we promote \r\ncollective action to enhance our resilience, promote \r\nhuman security, lessen our vulnerability and build \r\nstronger economies. \r\n Such has been our widely acclaimed best-practice \r\napproach with regard to HIV/AIDS. Saint Kitts and \r\nNevis applauds the General Assembly for convening \r\nthe High-level Meeting on HIV/AIDS. The Joint \r\nUnited Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) \r\nhas collaborated with the Pan Caribbean Partnership \r\nAgainst HIV and AIDS, in keeping with its \r\ncommitment to support countries achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals and also in ensuring \r\nthat HIV prevention, care, treatment and support \r\nservices are provided to all in need. \r\n The agenda is still a full one and the challenge no \r\nless daunting than it was 10 years ago, in a region with \r\nthe second highest global prevalence rate of HIV. We \r\ntherefore anticipate and encourage the continued \r\nsupport of UNAIDS and other health and development \r\nagencies. \r\n With regard to non-communicable diseases \r\n(NCDs), the Caribbean can be justly proud that the \r\ninitiatives in the Port of Spain Declaration of 2007 — \r\n“Uniting to Stop the Epidemic of Chronic NCDs” — \r\nwhich arose out of the first-ever heads of Government \r\nsummit on the subject, has resonated across the globe, \r\nresulting in the just concluded High-level Meeting with \r\na consensus on launching an international wellness \r\nrevolution. \r\n Non-communicable diseases are to a large extent \r\npreventable. It is therefore essential that the outcome \r\ndocument from the High-level Meeting mirrors many \r\nof the chief concerns of the Port of Spain Declaration, \r\naimed at encouraging Governments and the private \r\nsector to collaborate on increasing avenues for \r\nexercise, healthy diets and smoke-free zones for the \r\nbenefit of the general public. \r\n A long-term reduction in the enormous costs of \r\ntreating heart failure, diabetes and hypertension, and \r\nthe resulting 60 per cent to 70 per cent mortality rates \r\nfrom NCDs, is worth the investment in protecting \r\nhuman capital and the development of our various \r\nregions. \r\n I am extremely proud that the Government of \r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis has the lead responsibility for \r\nhuman resources, health and HIV/AIDS in the \r\nCaribbean Community, and continues to play a \r\npioneering role. \r\n We recognize the urgent need to make good on \r\npledges resulting from the High-level Meeting, which \r\ncan only augur well for a future in which due \r\nrecognition must be given to the role of health in \r\noverall development. \r\n It would be remiss of me not to highlight the \r\nsignificance of the United Nations Conference on \r\nSustainable Development. Next June, during this sixty-\r\nsixth session of the General Assembly, all eyes will be \r\non the Rio deliberations aimed at achieving \r\nconvergence on the social, environmental and \r\neconomic dimensions of sustainable development. I \r\nfully support the main objective of the Conference, \r\nnamely, securing political commitment. That is the \r\ncritical factor for success throughout the Rio+20 \r\nprocesses and beyond. \r\n Saint Kitts and Nevis is one of the small island \r\ndeveloping States (SIDS) referred to in chapter 17 of \r\nAgenda 21. Throughout the past 20 years, the \r\ninternational community has made tremendous strides \r\nin addressing SIDS challenges to sustainable \r\ndevelopment. Regrettably, many an encouraging step \r\nforward has been offset by painful setbacks. \r\n The effect of climate change is a bane that is felt \r\non a daily basis in Saint Kitts and Nevis, as in other \r\nislands. The question is no longer “if” and “how”, but \r\nrather “when” and “by how much” we will be affected. \r\nWe need desperately to upgrade pre-emptive measures, \r\nto counter the imminent threat of climate change. \r\n A defined strategy to aggressively promote \r\nclimate financing is highly recommended. It will be \r\nvital if our countries are to successfully address the \r\neffects of climate change without tapping into already \r\nlimited and depleted resources. My delegation \r\nencourages other Member States to join the call for the \r\nfull implementation of climate financing. \r\n In addition to pursuing outcomes that benefit all \r\nStates, my delegation would like to highlight certain \r\nchallenges that some members of the international \r\n A/66/PV.24\r\n \r\n9 11-51378 \r\n \r\ncommunity face, with which the General Assembly can \r\nassist. I speak of Haiti, Antigua and Barbuda, Cuba and \r\nTaiwan. \r\n We must ever remember Haiti, one of the most \r\npopulous member States of CARICOM. We should \r\nremain acutely aware of Haiti’s trials and struggles \r\nagainst natural and man-made catastrophic events, \r\nunsettling social and political vicissitudes and \r\neconomic hardships. Their effects have set Haiti many \r\nyears behind, compared to the rate of development of \r\nother nations in the region. We therefore encourage the \r\nfulfilling of the many goodwill pledges that have been \r\nmade for assistance in its reconstruction efforts. \r\n Another CARICOM member State, Antigua and \r\nBarbuda, continues to be locked in an underdog \r\nstruggle to benefit from its success before the World \r\nTrade Organization Dispute Settlement Body. We again \r\nurge a speedy, fair and just resolution to this gaming \r\ndispute. \r\n Also within the Caribbean, the people of our \r\nsister nation of Cuba continue to endure much hardship \r\nas the consequence of a 50-year commercial, economic \r\nand financial embargo. The Assembly and the \r\ninternational community have consistently called for \r\nthe lifting of the embargo. Our country reiterates its \r\ncall, and the call of regional neighbours and the \r\ninternational community, particularly the General \r\nAssembly, for a speedy redress of this matter. \r\n Since 2009, Taiwan has been invited by the World \r\nHealth Organization to attend the annual World Health \r\nAssembly (WHA) as an observer. This practice and the \r\nrelated arrangements have established what has been \r\ntermed the WHA model, which sets a useful precedent \r\nfor Taiwan’s greater participation in the United Nations \r\nsystem. It is the view of my country that in today’s \r\nhighly integrated and interconnected world almost all \r\nissues demand full participation by, and cooperation \r\namong, international partners. As one of the world’s \r\nleading economic and technological powerhouses, \r\nTaiwan can contribute substantially to the international \r\ncommunity. \r\n We therefore urge the United Nations to find a \r\nsuitable way to allow for Taiwan’s meaningful \r\nparticipation in its specialized agencies and \r\nmechanisms, including the International Civil Aviation \r\nOrganization and the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change. \r\n I have presented some of the challenges that we \r\nencounter as a country and region, challenges to which \r\nthe Assembly has itself given prominence. I have also \r\ngiven consideration to some of our aspirations for the \r\nsixty-sixth session and beyond. They are issues that \r\ndemand collective inputs and interventions. \r\n We are all part of the global community, and \r\nproblems that permeate our tightly woven fabric \r\ninvariably spread to affect us all in some way or \r\nanother. It is incumbent upon us all, therefore, to \r\nensure that the results of our collective enterprise and \r\ndiligence allow for the realization of our desired goals. \r\nSurely, working together with purpose and integrity \r\nwill ensure that we rise on the same tide. Let us rise \r\ntogether. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Franco Frattini, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Italy. \r\n Mr. Frattini (Italy): Italy has a long tradition of \r\nmediation that has shaped our history and our approach \r\nto international affairs. In the celebrations of the \r\n150th anniversary of Italian unification this year, we \r\ncommemorated the vision of the founding fathers of \r\nour nation and the sacrifices of so many patriots. We \r\nalso recalled the role of mediation in bridging the gap \r\nbetween the aspirations for independence and the \r\nreality of foreign occupation.  \r\n A century or so after unification, our vocation for \r\nmediation was fulfilled when we were among the first \r\ncountries to launch the process of European \r\npacification. We helped restore peace and prosperity to \r\na war-torn continent by engaging Governments in \r\ndialogue rather than disputes. \r\n Our attitude to mediation is inspired by both our \r\nhistory and our geography. Our territory is located \r\nright at the centre of the Mediterranean Sea, making us \r\nkeenly aware that our security is not independent of \r\nthat of the region surrounding us. \r\n For decades, Italy has emphasized the need to \r\nbridge the economic and social gap between the \r\nconditions of the northern shores of the Mediterranean \r\nand the expectations of our neighbours to the south. \r\nDespite this vision, we tended to overlook the \r\naspirations for civil and political rights of the peoples \r\nof North Africa and the Middle East, peoples so close \r\nto us geographically but far apart in terms of the rights \r\nenjoyed by our citizens.  \r\nA/66/PV.24  \r\n \r\n11-51378 10 \r\n \r\n On the face of it, the approach favoured by \r\nEuropean and the other Western countries — including \r\nthe United States — was to forge partnerships with \r\nundemocratic regimes and place a priority on security, \r\ncounter-terrorism cooperation and migration policy. We \r\nmade a mistake. \r\n The Arab Spring was a wake-up call, reminding \r\nus that no political leader can maintain power at the \r\nexpense of his or her own people. It confirmed the \r\nprinciple that there can be no mediation or compromise \r\nwhere fundamental rights are concerned. And it \r\nshowed that cooperation for the sake of security and \r\nstability is no alternative to promoting freedom, \r\neconomic and democratic growth and job creation. \r\n Our response to the uprisings was consistent with \r\nour values. We called for dialogue and deplored the use \r\nof force against civilians. That was not enough in \r\nLibya, however, where the regime had vowed to \r\nslaughter its own civilians. The only way to prevent a \r\nmassacre was for the international community to \r\ninvoke the principle of the responsibility to protect. \r\n By helping to implement that decision in military, \r\ndiplomatic and humanitarian terms, we shifted from a \r\nculture of sovereign impunity to one of responsible \r\nsovereignty, rooted in national and international \r\naccountability for the most serious violations of human \r\nrights. At the same time, we supported international \r\nsanctions against the Syrian leadership. \r\n The uprisings in North Africa and in the Middle \r\nEast send a message that the United Nations can do \r\nmore and do better. Let me be very clear. We do not \r\nwant less United Nations involvement; we want more. \r\nLibya can be the first test case for a more prominent \r\nUnited Nations role.  \r\n The United Nations is called upon to coordinate \r\nand lead the international community’s assistance to \r\nthat country. The international community should \r\nmaintain cohesion and unity of purpose, avoid a \r\nfragmented response and resist engaging in a first-past-\r\nthe-post logic. There should be no competition, \r\nbecause there is only one winner: the Libyan people.  \r\n The United Nations should therefore chair the \r\ninternational coordination mechanisms, with the \r\nsupport of the relevant regional organizations, such as \r\nthe League of Arab States, the African Union and the \r\nEuropean Union (EU). At this juncture we need to \r\nprevent resentment and extremism from gaining \r\nground.  \r\n We are ready to build respectful new partnerships \r\nwithout imposing pre-packaged models. That is why \r\nwe have promoted the idea of a new Mediterranean \r\nplan for growth and development. And we have \r\nproposed a permanent conference on security and \r\ncooperation, with the goal of building an inclusive \r\ndialogue among equals on political, economic and \r\ncultural issues. If we fail to respond, and if the Arab \r\nSpring does not produce results soon, we will all have \r\na heavy price to pay. \r\n Never has mediation been more necessary in the \r\ntense stand-off between the Israelis and the \r\nPalestinians. Confrontation has led nowhere. The time \r\nhas come to defuse this long-standing and disruptive \r\nconflict through recourse to dialogue and the building \r\nof mutual trust. We continue to strongly back American \r\nefforts, and we welcome the Quartet’s new effort to \r\ngather the necessary support to restart the negotiations \r\nbetween the parties towards the creation, very soon, of \r\na strong and safe Palestinian State.  \r\n Within the European Union, which has to speak \r\nwith one voice, Italy is also ready to exercise more \r\nleadership and political vision in relaunching the peace \r\nprocess.  \r\n In Lebanon, Italy is playing a prominent role in \r\nmediation. The Italian contingent in the United Nations \r\nInterim Force in Lebanon was awarded the United \r\nNations peace medal for its contribution to maintaining \r\npeace and stability in the country. This prize honours \r\nthe achievements of our soldiers in Lebanon, but also \r\nthe commitment of the Italian Government to \r\npeacekeeping.  \r\n Italy is the sixth top contributor to the United \r\nNations peacekeeping operations budget and, since \r\n2006, the top EU and Western European and Others \r\nGroup contributor of troops to the United Nations. \r\n In Africa far too many people are still grappling \r\nwith the serious problems caused by regional conflicts. \r\nThose conflicts undermine stability and prosperity for \r\nmillions of people, spreading the poisonous seed of \r\nterrorism and piracy.  \r\n As a witness to the Comprehensive Peace \r\nAgreement (CPA) between North and South Sudan, \r\nItaly welcomed the Agreement’s implementation, \r\nwhich has led to the birth of the new State of South \r\n A/66/PV.24\r\n \r\n11 11-51378 \r\n \r\nSudan. This achievement should be an incentive to \r\nsettle the post-CPA arrangements without further delay. \r\n In the Horn of Africa, Italy has a traditional \r\ncommitment to contributing to peace, security and \r\ndevelopment. In the past few months, we have financed \r\nprojects in many sectors: health, education, nutrition, \r\ntraining, governance support, peace and security. But \r\nour assistance is not enough. In Somalia people are \r\nfacing starvation and humanitarian disaster. \r\nInternational support must be stepped up to deliver \r\nbasic services to the population and foster political \r\nreconciliation. \r\n The United Nations collective security system is \r\nadapting its structure and practices to the new \r\nchallenges by making good and flexible use of its \r\nfundamental, cost-effective tools. Mediation is one of \r\nthem. We are among the sponsors of the draft \r\nresolution on strengthening the role of mediation in the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes. \r\n We also encourage the United Nations to play a \r\nmore significant role in conflict prevention, the \r\nsettlement of disputes and peacebuilding efforts. To \r\nthat end, we rely on the impartiality and authority of \r\nthe Secretary-General. We commend him for his \r\nleadership in crisis management, and encourage him in \r\nthis noble endeavour and in his commitment to \r\nbudgetary discipline. \r\n We also commend all the efforts to promote a \r\nstrong solution to the reform of the Security Council, a \r\nreform inspired by the United Nations core principles \r\nof democracy, accountability, consensus and flexibility — a \r\nreform that will gather the widest majority and with \r\nwhich each and every Member State can identify. \r\n Our humanistic heritage defines the human being \r\nas the measure of all things. The principle of placing \r\npeople first underpins our active support for United \r\nNations campaigns on fundamental issues such as the \r\nabolition of the death penalty, the protection of the \r\nfreedom of religion or belief and the ending of the \r\npractice of female genital mutilation. The people-first \r\napproach also entails mediation between the pressing \r\nneed for modernization and the goal of improving \r\nindividual quality of life.  \r\n We need to enhance food security by tackling the \r\ncrucial links between speculation, inflation of food \r\nprices, and instability. We can count on the new bodies \r\ncreated in the framework of the Food and Agriculture \r\nOrganization of the United Nations and the Rome-\r\nbased United Nations agencies to reduce food price \r\nvolatility and its very negative impact on the most \r\nvulnerable people. \r\n We also pay close attention to urban development \r\nand environmental sustainability, promoting important \r\ninternational events such as the World Urban Forum, \r\nwhich will be held next year in Italy, and a world \r\nconference on the topic of the inter-ethnic city. \r\n In conclusion, Italy wants to place the rights of \r\nhuman beings, and the environment in which we live, \r\nat the centre of society. True to this principle, Italy \r\nwants to help create and consolidate a modern \r\nhumanism. There could be no better defence against \r\nthe hatred and criminal intolerance that struck this city, \r\nthis country and the world 10 years ago. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ncall on Her Excellency Ms. Trinidad Jiménez, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of the Kingdom of \r\nSpain. \r\n Ms. Jiménez (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): I begin \r\nby congratulating the President on his election to \r\npreside over this principal organ in which we all strive \r\nto achieve the purposes of the United Nations. \r\n I also wish the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban \r\nKi-moon, the greatest possible success in carrying out \r\nhis mission of promoting peace and progress around \r\nthe world with the same effectiveness as he \r\ndemonstrated throughout his first mandate. \r\n I also warmly congratulate the representatives of \r\nthe new State of South Sudan, which has joined the \r\nUnited Nations family during the current session. \r\n The economic and financial crisis continues to be \r\na cause of serious concern for the entire world; its \r\nconsequences are seen in many different fields. The \r\ncapacity of the international community to take action \r\nto address any type of crisis, and to do so in a timely \r\nmanner, is limited. This restrains the fight against \r\npoverty and puts at risk the implementation of \r\nsustainable development policies, which are needed \r\nnow more than ever. \r\n Spain, together with its European Union partners, \r\nis taking difficult decisions in order to tackle the crisis. \r\nHowever, beyond the actions taken at the regional and \r\nnational levels, it is essential to undertake a \r\nA/66/PV.24  \r\n \r\n11-51378 12 \r\n \r\ncoordinated global response. The United Nations \r\nsystem is an important part of the solution to the crisis. \r\n Women’s equality is a fundamental human right, \r\nbased upon the concept of equality among all human \r\nbeings. Advancing women’s full and equal access to \r\nthe labour market, as well as to the political and social \r\nworld, is not only ethically imperative, but an essential \r\nmeasure to overcome the crisis. \r\n Since 1 January, the United Nations has been able \r\nto count on an instrument to assist Member States to \r\nachieve that goal: UN-Women. Its Executive Director, \r\nMs. Michelle Bachelet, will boost this effort. I assure \r\nher of Spain’s full support. We will be at the side of all \r\nwomen who fight for freedom and equality. \r\n Over the past few months we have witnessed \r\nepisodes of rebellion in which peoples have fought \r\nagainst the tyranny of rulers who denied basic human \r\nrights, as well as the dignity and value of human \r\nbeings, preventing people from participating in their \r\ncountries’ political life and from making use of their \r\nresources and opportunities. \r\n We celebrate the success of the popular \r\nmovements in Tunisia and Egypt and we join the \r\nefforts of the international community to support and \r\nstrengthen the political transition processes in both \r\ncountries, led by their own peoples. \r\n The Libyan people will also be able to enjoy \r\nfreedom and live in democracy after decades of \r\ndictatorship and months of conflict. We have welcomed \r\nthe Libyan representatives in the General Assembly, \r\nwith the satisfaction of knowing that the United \r\nNations, by implementing its principles, has remained \r\nat the side of the Libyan people. \r\n We now have the obligation to continue to help \r\nthe Libyan people in the reconciliation and \r\nreconstruction processes. We are ready to do so, and \r\nwe will do it under the guidance of the United Nations, \r\nfollowing the pace set by the Libyans themselves. \r\n Unfortunately, the international community \r\ncontinues to witness with indignation the brutal \r\nrepression of civilian demonstrators by the Syrian \r\nauthorities. I firmly condemn those actions once again, \r\nand reiterate the need for the international community \r\nto take measures to stop the repression. \r\n The Tunisian, Egyptian and Libyan revolutions, \r\nthe Syrian uprising and the acceleration of the reform \r\nprocesses in Morocco and Jordan are part of a \r\nprofound transformation of the Arab world, with \r\nsignificant consequences for the region and for the \r\ninternational community as a whole. The legitimate \r\naspiration of the Palestinian people to enjoy freedom \r\ncannot be left out of this wave of change. \r\n The Arab-Israeli conflict has been with the \r\nUnited Nations almost since the Organization’s \r\nfounding. This session may be remembered as the one \r\nin which the General Assembly granted Palestine the \r\nstatus of observer State. Spain could support such a \r\ndecision, for a number of reasons. \r\n First, the international community recognizes that \r\na solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict requires the \r\nexistence of two States, Israeli and Palestinian, living \r\nside by side in peace and security. \r\n Secondly, after more than 60 years of conflict, the \r\ninternational community should send a clear signal to \r\nthe Palestinians underlining that its commitment in \r\nfavour of the creation of the Palestinian State is deep \r\nand unambiguous. \r\n Thirdly, in the year in which the Arab Spring \r\nchanged realities in the Arab world — and, indeed, in \r\nthe world at large — the just, legitimate and long-\r\nstanding aspiration of the Palestinians to live in dignity \r\nin their own State, free from occupation and its \r\naccompanying suffering, deserves a clear response \r\nfrom the international community, a response that can \r\nno longer be postponed. \r\n This new step could be conceived as a stage \r\ntowards the legitimate objective of Palestine’s \r\nbecoming a Member State of the United Nations with \r\nfull rights. \r\n Effective, sustainable peace can only be achieved \r\nthrough negotiations between the parties. Spain \r\nbelieves that the Palestinians could find in this new \r\nstatus a stimulus for the prompt resumption of \r\nnegotiations. Precisely because that is the shared goal \r\nof the parties and the international community, such a \r\nsituation should not be used for actions incompatible \r\nwith the spirit of negotiations. Israel should also \r\ncontribute to this spirit by refraining from measures \r\nthat prejudge the final status. \r\n Spain is coordinating its position with its \r\nEuropean Union partners. I am grateful for the efforts \r\nof the High Representative, Catherine Ashton, to \r\nreactivate the negotiations, in a way acceptable to all \r\n A/66/PV.24\r\n \r\n13 11-51378 \r\n \r\nEuropean Union member States, and the declaration of \r\nthe Quartet, which Spain assesses very positively. \r\n Spain’s engagement with the Palestinian people \r\nand their struggle against occupation is long-standing \r\nand known to everyone. Spain has always given \r\npolitical, economic and moral support to the legitimate \r\naspirations of the Palestinians. \r\n On the other hand, the historical relations \r\nbetween Spain and the Jewish people date back many \r\ncenturies. Spain’s historical identity cannot be \r\nunderstood without its Arab and Jewish heritage. \r\n I wish to underscore Spain’s commitment to \r\nIsrael with regard to the endeavour to create a \r\nhomeland for the Jewish people. Since its founding, \r\nIsrael has experienced a number of wars and has \r\nsuffered from terrorism against its civilian population. \r\nFor Spain, the security of this young State born out of \r\nan ancient people is essential.  \r\n The best way to preserve that State is through a \r\npeace treaty that, among other things, provides for the \r\nestablishment of a Palestinian State along the 1967 \r\nlines, with agreed swaps and with Jerusalem as a \r\nshared capital. The security of Israel and Palestine will \r\nrequire effective guarantees in the future peace \r\nagreement, including possible international participation, \r\nshould the parties request it. \r\n The future peace agreement should look to the \r\nfuture, turning its back on the painful years of conflict. \r\nTherefore, Israel and Palestine have to be certain that \r\nclaims originating from the conflict will be overcome \r\nwith their signature of the peace agreement. \r\n  In addition, the solution to the painful tragedy of \r\nthe Palestinian refugees must be a just one agreed by \r\nall the parties concerned, while allowing the \r\npreservation of Israel’s current character. The \r\nPalestinian State will be, in this regard as well, a key \r\nelement for the final resolution of the conflict. \r\n Some voices have raised concerns that the new \r\ndemocracies may be home to political groups with \r\nradical or extremist ideologies. Democracy is an open \r\nand fair system of political participation that must also \r\nbe able to defend itself against possible threats. \r\n Fortunately, we can count on instruments that \r\nmay contribute to preventing such situations. The \r\nUnited Nations Alliance of Civilizations, which \r\npromotes intercultural dialogue and cooperation, is a \r\nclear example. The Regional Strategy for the \r\nMediterranean, developed within the Alliance \r\nframework, may help, through youth programmes and \r\ncampaigns to raise awareness, to diffuse democratic \r\nvalues and respect for human rights, always in \r\ncoexistence with those of local cultures. \r\n We have to prevent Al-Qaida’s terrorism from \r\nbeing reinforced in the Sahel region through the release \r\nof uncontrolled weapons. The international community \r\nmust be united in the fight against this curse that \r\nrepresents a scourge to countries such as Afghanistan \r\nand Pakistan, in the same irrational and cruel way as \r\nthat in which it struck New York, Bali, Madrid, \r\nLondon, Mumbai, Moscow and many other places over \r\nthe past decade.  \r\n The United Nations itself recently suffered the \r\nconsequences of a terrible terrorist attack in Abuja, \r\nadding to those previously endured in Baghdad and \r\nAlgiers, among others. Once again, I extend our \r\ncondolences to the Secretary-General, and express our \r\nsolidarity with the victims and their families, as well as \r\nwith the hard-working members of staff of the United \r\nNations. \r\n The tenth anniversary of the attack on the Twin \r\nTowers in the city of New York took place a few days \r\nago. We have lived through a bloody decade since the \r\nattack, in spite of the determined fight of the \r\ninternational community against terrorism.  \r\n I firmly believe in, and reaffirm, the need to \r\nstrengthen international cooperation in order to prevent \r\nand fight terrorism. Every country must assume the \r\nobligation to address this universal scourge. That is \r\nwhy Spain joined, from the beginning, the initiative \r\nregarding the Global Counterterrorism Forum. The \r\nForum was launched just a few days ago.  \r\n We firmly support United Nations initiatives \r\nwithin the framework of its Global Counter-Terrorism \r\nStrategy, as well as the efforts of the Security Council \r\nand of the Secretariat to rationalize the existing \r\nstructures in order to reach the goals that we have set \r\nin this area. \r\n Spain is especially sensitive with regard to the \r\nvictims of terrorism. Unfairly forgotten at times, they \r\ncannot be mentioned only as a rhetoric tool. Rather, \r\nthere should be an effective commitment to give them \r\nrecognition, remember them and provide them the \r\nassistance and support that they deserve. That is how \r\nA/66/PV.24  \r\n \r\n11-51378 14 \r\n \r\nwe have understood the position of victims in Spain, \r\nand we have passed legislation on the issue, giving us \r\none of the most advanced and efficient models in the \r\nworld in assisting the victims of terrorism. \r\n Spain follows very closely the dynamism of a \r\nregion with strong links with Spain — Latin America. \r\nThe strength of the Latin American economy is \r\nessential to overcome the crisis and to create a new \r\ninternational economic governance. \r\n That is why enhancing and consolidating a broad \r\ndialogue with Latin America is crucial. The dialogue \r\nshould include the big issues on the global agenda, \r\nsuch as the design of an ambitious and innovative \r\ninternational financial architecture, as well as the \r\nresponse to climate change, energy, security and \r\nmigration. \r\n Latin America’s regional integration has been an \r\nengine fuelling its growth and improving \r\nunderstanding. Spain has always wished to support this \r\nprocess in the framework of the Ibero-American \r\nSummits. \r\n Other regions of the world also deserve special \r\nattention because of the tragic situations of their \r\npopulations as a result of drought and other endemic \r\nproblems.  \r\n The situation in the Horn of Africa is intolerable. \r\nWe are contributing to alleviating the famine in \r\nSomalia, in coordination with other donors and United \r\nNations agencies. However, humanitarian aid, despite \r\nbeing a priority, is only a first step towards \r\ndevelopment. We still have a long way to go in many \r\nparts of the world. \r\n I therefore reaffirm Spain’s commitment to the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. The fight against \r\npoverty is a fundamental objective of my country’s aid \r\nand cooperation for development policy. The challenge \r\nof the Millennium Development Goals should \r\nencourage us to redouble our efforts to achieve them \r\nwithin the deadline that has been set. \r\n However, in order to realize the Goals and to \r\nprovide a future for generations to come, we must \r\nmake the most of meetings such as the one to be held \r\nin Rio de Janeiro in 2012, where the intention is to \r\nforge a new paradigm that should allow us to combine \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals with environmental \r\nsustainability. \r\n It is also important to take advantage of the \r\nmomentum created by the Cancún Conference in 2010 \r\non the climate change negotiating process. We will \r\ncontinue to contribute to the process constructively, \r\ntogether with our European Union partners, at the \r\nupcoming Durban Conference. \r\n The financial crisis affecting the global economy \r\ncannot be an excuse to avoid our commitments. On the \r\ncontrary, it should encourage us to fulfil them. That is \r\nwhy Spain believes in supporting the development of \r\ninnovative financing instruments — in other words, the \r\ndevelopment of mechanisms through which to mobilize \r\nmid-term and long-term additional financial resources. \r\nThat should be done in a way that is stable and \r\npredictable, as well as being complementary to official \r\ndevelopment aid, which should be maintained, come \r\nwhat may. Spain currently chairs the leading Pilot \r\nGroup on innovative financing for development, of \r\nwhich we have great hopes. \r\n Spain’s support for, and participation in, the \r\nactivities of the Organization relating to the \r\nmaintenance of peace and security in diverse parts of \r\nthe world also demonstrates our commitment to the \r\nachievement of the purposes of the United Nations. \r\nAlmost 1,200 Spaniards actively participate today in \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations, with an \r\nespecially prominent presence in the United Nations \r\nInterim Force in Lebanon, a mission essential to \r\nmaintaining stability in the south of the country, as \r\nwell as to helping its economic development. \r\n I thank the Secretary-General for participating in \r\nthe inauguration of the United Nations base in Quart de \r\nPoblet, Valencia, thus recognizing Spain’s commitment \r\nto the United Nations. The construction of the base, \r\nwhich Spain provided to the United Nations, will, as \r\nthe Secretary-General said, facilitate the work of the \r\nOrganization, enhance the reliability of its \r\ncommunications and considerably improve the safety \r\nand security of staff in the field. \r\n Spain is very proud of its participation in United \r\nNations operations. We intend to maintain a firm, \r\nactive, permanent commitment to the Organization and \r\nits purposes. In line with that commitment, Spain \r\nannounced in 2005 its candidature for a non-permanent \r\nseat on the Security Council for the biennium 2015-\r\n2016. We hope that, with the support of Member \r\nStates, we shall have a seat on the Council and in that \r\nposition continue working for the preservation of \r\n A/66/PV.24\r\n \r\n15 11-51378 \r\n \r\ninternational security and stability. At the same time, \r\nwe will strive to promote development and human \r\nrights as fundamental pillars of lasting peace. \r\n A year ago, Libyan, Egyptian and Tunisian men \r\nand women witnessed the Assembly meeting while \r\nthey were still under the oppression of dictatorial \r\nregimes. Today they own their future. They have \r\nfought for it. The international community has \r\nprotected and supported them. They, on their part, have \r\ngiven us hope. We can now hope that change is \r\npossible. There is no insurmountable challenge. \r\n We are today certain that the international \r\ncommunity, guided by the United Nations, is on the \r\npath of peace and freedom. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Henri Eyebe Ayissi, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of \r\nCameroon. \r\n Mr. Eyebe Ayissi (Cameroon) (spoke in French): \r\nFirst, on behalf of His Excellency Mr. Paul Biya, \r\nPresident of the Republic and Head of State of \r\nCameroon, and on behalf of the delegation that I have \r\nthe honour to lead at the current session, I warmly \r\ncongratulate the President on his unanimous election to \r\npreside over the Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. \r\n To Mr. Joseph Deiss, his predecessor, we wish to \r\nsay how much his work as President of the Assembly at \r\nits sixty-fifth session was appreciated, just as \r\nCameroon appreciated his visit to Yaoundé in January \r\nduring his African visit. \r\n We also once again sincerely congratulate \r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon on the extension of his mandate as \r\nSecretary-General for a further five years. His \r\ndetermination and commitment to the United Nations \r\nduring his first term of office contributed to the \r\ninitiatives and important actions of the United Nations \r\nto promote peace and social and economic \r\ndevelopment throughout the world. He will have our \r\nbest wishes and constant support during his second \r\nterm, when we hope that he will successfully continue \r\nhis  work in every area within the framework of the \r\nUnited Nations agenda, particularly in terms of \r\naligning and harmonizing the points of view of the \r\nvarious Member States.  \r\n This year a new Member, the Republic of South \r\nSudan, joined the Organization. We had the \r\nopportunity to solemnly, but joyfully, welcome it on \r\n14 July, following its declaration of independence a \r\nfew days earlier. The arrival of this new State allows a \r\ndark chapter to be closed: decades of war, with a litany \r\nof woes, death, displaced persons, tears, human tragedy \r\nand suffering among the people of that land on our \r\nAfrican continent.  \r\n Cameroon takes the opportunity to join in paying \r\na well-deserved tribute to the leaders of the Sudan and \r\nof South Sudan, as well as to the United Nations and \r\nthe African Union, for their tireless work in supporting \r\nthe negotiations before the Comprehensive Peace \r\nAgreement was signed in 2005, as well as during its \r\nsubsequent implementation. The United Nations \r\nMission in the Sudan and the recent creation of the \r\nUnited Nations Mission in the Republic of South \r\nSudan, whose task it is to support the new State in the \r\nprocess of consolidating its institutions and democracy, \r\nshow the unique, decisive role played by the United \r\nNations, fully in line with the fundamental purposes \r\nand principles of its founding Charter. \r\n Cameroon welcomes the role that the United \r\nNations has played in that regard. In more general \r\nterms, we believe that its role in conflict management \r\nshould be played in a fully transparent way and in line \r\nwith the principles, purposes and ideals of the Charter, \r\nwhich calls for the peaceful settlement of international \r\ndisputes and for respect for the sovereignty and \r\nterritorial integrity of States.  \r\n That is where the theme selected for this sixty-\r\nsixth session — “The role of mediation in the \r\nsettlement of disputes through peaceful means” — \r\ntakes on its importance, reminding us that the Charter \r\nstates that the Organization’s primary purpose is \r\n  “To maintain international peace and \r\nsecurity, and to that end: to take effective \r\ncollective measures for the prevention and \r\nremoval of threats to the peace, and for the \r\nsuppression of acts of aggression or other \r\nbreaches of the peace, and to bring about by \r\npeaceful means, and in conformity with the \r\nprinciples of justice and international law, \r\nadjustment or settlement of international disputes \r\nor situations which might lead to a breach of the \r\npeace”. \r\n The Charter also calls upon Members of the \r\nUnited Nations to  \r\nA/66/PV.24  \r\n \r\n11-51378 16 \r\n \r\n “refrain in their international relations from the \r\nthreat or use of force against the territorial \r\nintegrity or political independence of any state, or \r\nin any other manner inconsistent with the \r\nPurposes of the United Nations.” \r\n International disputes, and a fortiori internal \r\nconflicts, should be settled peacefully in line with our \r\nCharter, through negotiation and mediation, rather than \r\nby recourse to force.  \r\n That is the position that the African Union, the \r\ncontinental organization of African States, ceaselessly \r\nadvocates and defends. Cameroon agrees with the \r\nAfrican Union that any lasting solution to an internal \r\npolitical crisis must take into account the State’s \r\nnational political institutions and the legitimate \r\naspirations of the people concerned, but also the \r\nmaintenance of the country’s unity and territorial \r\nintegrity. It considers that priority must be given to \r\nmeasures that guarantee the maintenance of peace, the \r\npromotion of national reconciliation and the \r\nconsolidation of a democratic culture and ownership of \r\nthe rule of law by Governments and citizens. \r\n With regard to some current burning questions in \r\nthis area, and particularly with regard to management \r\nof the Libyan issue, Cameroon noted the General \r\nAssembly decision on 19 September approving the \r\nmandate of the Libyan delegation established by the \r\nNational Transitional Council, as well as the statement \r\nmade here by the Chairperson of the African Union \r\nCouncil on 21 September, which was preceded by the \r\n19 September press release. Fully in line with our \r\nexternal policy, Cameroon will respect the decision and \r\nstatement in the context of its bilateral relations with \r\nthe Libyan State, and within various international \r\ninstitutions. \r\n It is the international community’s duty to \r\nsupport States and their peoples in the management of \r\ntheir national affairs, and in seeking to ensure that they \r\ncontrol their own fate. Governments, for their part, \r\nmust seek to respond to the legitimate aspirations and \r\nthe many and varied expectations of their peoples in all \r\nareas.  \r\n In Cameroon the Government is seeking to \r\nimplement the reforms that began a few years ago to \r\nconsolidate national political institutions and \r\nmodernize our democracy. At the same time, it has \r\nestablished policies to create an environment \r\nfavourable to development and revenue-generating \r\nactivities and to improve the living conditions of its \r\npeople, in a context of repeated international economic \r\nand financial crises, which have disturbing effects on \r\nthe national programmes of States. \r\n In economic terms, my country has had since \r\n2009 a real moral compass for national players, both \r\npublic and private, and for our external partners: the \r\nGrowth and Employment Strategy document. The \r\ndocument is part of a comprehensive shared vision of \r\ndevelopment for Cameroon up to 2035, called Vision \r\n2035. It emphasises seeking increased growth, job \r\ncreation, poverty reduction and a tangible improvement \r\nin the living conditions of our people. The strategy will \r\nbe implemented by, in particular, large-scale, labour-\r\nintensive building projects throughout the country, with \r\nparticular emphasis on the energy sectors, mining and \r\nthe creation of human capital. \r\n In political terms, and with regard to elections, \r\nour independent electoral institution — Elections \r\nCameroon (ELECAM) — set up in 2006 and made \r\nresponsible for the entire electoral process, from the \r\nelectoral register to the organization of the ballot, the \r\noversight of elections and referendums, has become \r\nfully operational, and has a number of local offices. \r\n Giving the right to vote to Cameroonians living \r\nabroad is part of the law that was promulgated this \r\nyear. The electoral register has been updated by \r\nELECAM, and incentives, such as free national \r\nidentity cards, were given to encourage a large turn-out \r\nat the elections. Furthermore, legal provisions have \r\nbeen established to ensure the transparency, freedom, \r\nhonesty and credibility of the elections in a context of \r\nconsensual democracy.  \r\n In that regard, there is a deadline of importance to \r\nthe Cameroonian people in the short term. On \r\n9 October they will have the right to elect their leader \r\nand determine their future, as is the case in all \r\ndemocracies. I am referring to the presidential election. \r\nWith all of the provisions that I have just mentioned, \r\nmade with the technical assistance of United Nations \r\nspecialized agencies, we believe that the conditions \r\nnow exist to ensure that the election takes place \r\npeacefully. Independent national and foreign observers \r\nwill be authorized to monitor the presidential election.  \r\n I wish to highlight with pride the political \r\nmaturity demonstrated by the people of Cameroon. \r\nThey have always been able to make the best choice in \r\norder to ensure that we preserve national achievements, \r\n A/66/PV.24\r\n \r\n17 11-51378 \r\n \r\nparticularly with regard to peace and national unity, \r\nand the people have been able to work together in a \r\nspirit of patriotism, and with a high sense of a citizen’s \r\nresponsibilities when required to meet the various \r\nchallenges, both external and internal, that they \r\nencounter and have encountered throughout their \r\nhistory. \r\n I reiterate Cameroon’s commitment to peace \r\nthrough mediation, as well as its commitment to \r\ndemocracy and good governance, both internally and \r\ninternationally.  \r\n I close by emphasizing my country’s commitment \r\nto the ideals of the Charter, and to those set out in the \r\nConstitutive Act of the African Union. My country \r\nwishes to see enhanced cooperation between those two \r\ninternational institutions, as they deal with issues \r\naffecting African countries, in line with the spirit and \r\nletter of those two international instruments.  \r\n This has been, on behalf of the President of the \r\nRepublic of Cameroon, His Excellency Mr. Paul Biya, \r\nHead of State and head of Cameroonian diplomacy, our \r\ncontribution to the general debate at the sixty-sixth \r\nsession of the General Assembly of the United Nations, \r\nwhich is our common international Organization with \r\nglobal competence. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I shall \r\nnow call on those representatives who wish to speak in \r\nexercise of the right of reply.  \r\n May I remind members that statements in \r\nexercise of the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes \r\nfor the first intervention and to five minutes for the \r\nsecond, and  should be made by delegations from their \r\nseats. \r\n Mr. Starčević (Serbia): This morning the \r\nAssembly heard a statement by the Prime Minister of \r\nthe Republic of Albania, Mr. Sali Berisha. In what has \r\nbecome an annual ritual, he devoted a significant part \r\nof his statement to the problem of Kosovo, a statement \r\nwhich contained the expected misrepresentations and \r\nfalsehoods. They are of such a nature that they simply \r\nmust not remain unanswered. Let me attempt to deal \r\nwith them as briefly and succinctly as possible. \r\n Prime Minister Berisha stated that Kosovo “has \r\nshown assiduous commitment and seriousness in the \r\nprocess of negotiations in Brussels” (A/66/PV.22). It is \r\nequally true that Kosovo has shown assiduous \r\ncommitment and seriousness by, in parallel, taking \r\nunilateral actions of a coercive nature, attempting to \r\ncreate a fait accompli on issues on which negotiations \r\nwere still pending. By so doing, Kosovo creates \r\ntensions and conflicts, thus endangering the very \r\nprocess of negotiations to which it is supposedly \r\ncommitted. The truth is that Kosovo is not committed \r\nto that process at all. Aware that every process of \r\nnegotiations involves give and take, Kosovo, \r\nemboldened by its mighty protectors, wants only to \r\ntake. No sustainable solution has ever been possible on \r\nthat basis. \r\n Prime Minister Berisha misrepresented the July \r\n2010 advisory opinion of the International Court of \r\nJustice, stating that it decided that “the declaration of \r\nindependence of Kosovo” — supposedly from the \r\nAlbanian version of the opinion — “is in full \r\ncompliance with international law.” (ibid.) \r\n The Court never said that; it actually concluded \r\nthat “the declaration of independence of 17 February \r\n2008 did not violate general international law” \r\n(A/64/881, para. 84), but only because “the Court \r\nconsiders that general international law contains no \r\napplicable prohibition of declarations of \r\nindependence.”  \r\n That formulation does not convey the opinion of \r\nthe Court that the unilateral secession of Kosovo is \r\nlegitimate, or that Kosovo became, through it, an \r\nindependent State. The Court made it very clear that it \r\ndid not even consider whether the declaration was \r\njustified, or whether it produced any legal effects. \r\nEvery international lawyer knows that in actuality the \r\nreal question posed remained unanswered. And, by the \r\nway, it created a number of dissenting opinions in the \r\nCourt. \r\n Prime Minister Berisha spoke of “Ahtisaari’s \r\npackage”. It is obviously a “package” only for Kosovo \r\nand Albania, since neither Serbia nor the Security \r\nCouncil ever accepted it. It therefore remains at the \r\nlevel of individual ideas on the Kosovo problem.  \r\n Furthermore, Prime Minister Berisha also stated \r\nthat “Serbian cultural heritage in Kosovo is today more \r\nsecured than ever.” (A/66/PV.22). In evaluating that \r\nphrase, one should only remember the Albanian \r\npogrom of Serbs in 2004, when over 30 Christian \r\nOrthodox churches were destroyed. The remaining \r\nchurches continue to be routinely desecrated today.  \r\nA/66/PV.24  \r\n \r\n11-51378 18 \r\n \r\n Prime Minister Berisha asserted that “interethnic \r\nrelations in all areas where Serbs and Albanians live \r\ntogether in the same communities are very good” \r\n(ibid.). One should only analyse the minuscule number \r\nof Serbs returning to their properties in Kosovo, and \r\ndaily accounts of attacks on remaining Serbs and their \r\nproperty, to see that that is a rose-coloured image of a \r\ngrim reality. \r\n The Prime Minister of Albania spoke of “criminal \r\ngroups and organized gangs that with weapons and \r\nother means are doing all in their hand to devastate the \r\nrule of law.” (ibid.). I suppose that the Prime Minister \r\nwas speaking of Albanian groups, which have a long \r\ntradition of trampling the rule of law in Kosovo and in \r\na number of other countries of the world. Films have \r\nbeen made on that subject, and even here, in New York, \r\ndozens of members of the Albanian mafia were \r\napprehended only a few months ago. \r\n On the issue of the return of the remains of \r\nvictims of the conflict in Kosovo, the Republic of \r\nSerbia has shown full readiness to do everything in its \r\npower to complete that task. It expects Kosovo to do \r\nthe same.  \r\n It is really difficult to listen to, or read \r\nafterwards, the attempts of the Prime Minister of \r\nAlbania to deny the most horrendous crimes committed \r\nanywhere in the region of former Yugoslavia during the \r\nperiod of conflict: abducting hundreds of younger \r\nSerbs, killing them and selling their organs on the \r\nblack market.  \r\n It is easy to understand why the Prime Minister is \r\ndoing it, because most of those crimes were committed \r\nin the territory of Albania. But implying that Carla del \r\nPonte, the United Nations Interim Administration \r\nMission in Kosovo and Dick Marty and all the \r\nwitnesses he spoke to are lying is simply too much. If \r\nhe believes that he can wish those crimes away, we \r\nbelieve that he is wrong, and that the international \r\ncommunity will insist on a full investigation and the \r\nprosecution of the perpetrators of the crimes, which are \r\nwithout parallel in modern humanity. \r\n Mr. Hoxha (Albania): I am compelled to exercise \r\nmy right of reply after the comments made by the \r\nrepresentative of Serbia in exercise of his right of \r\nreply. I profoundly disagree with what we heard. \r\n It is a well known fact that Albania and Serbia \r\ndisagree on the Kosovo issue, as was also witnessed \r\nduring the general debate. Nevertheless, Albania, like \r\nmany other Member States, and an ever-growing \r\nnumber of them, is convinced that the independent \r\nKosovo is the only solution in a region torn apart by \r\nwar, fuelled by ethnic hatred of the Serbia under \r\nMilošević rule. The independent Kosovo, as reality has \r\nproved, is, and will be, a key contribution to peace and \r\nstability in the region, and Albania continues to hope \r\nthat Serbia will come to terms with this undeniable and \r\nirreversible reality. \r\n Last year, the Assembly received with respect the \r\nInternational Court of Justice advisory opinion (see \r\nA/64/881) on the declaration of independence of \r\nKosovo, an opinion that, we should remember, was \r\nrequested by Serbia. We all know the Court’s \r\nconclusion — although we heard a semantic effort that \r\nsaid the same thing — that the declaration of \r\nindependence did not violate any provision of \r\ninternational law. As was stated many times before the \r\nruling, Serbia is expected to accept and respect the \r\nCourt’s findings. We are still waiting for that to \r\nhappen. \r\n It needs to be emphasized that during the recent \r\ntroubles caused by vandalism and primitivism in the \r\nnorth of Kosovo the open support offered by Belgrade \r\nto that unrest had a clear purpose. For months now, \r\nsenior Serbian ministers and other high Government \r\nofficials have rivalled each other in their declarations \r\nthat the partition of Kosovo is the only solution. We \r\nneed to remind the Assembly that whoever speaks of \r\npartition, of changing borders in the Balkans, is \r\nlooking back to the darkest moments of recent Balkan \r\nhistory, which we think, and hope, will never return. \r\n Like many other countries, Albania extends its \r\nfull support to the Government of Kosovo to \r\nimplement the rule of law, exercise its authority in \r\nclose cooperation with the international presence there, \r\nand never yield to criminals, to the parallel structures \r\nand to individuals who care only for their own interest, \r\nand not the interests of the Serbian community they \r\npretend to represent. \r\n As German Chancellor Angela Merkel said a few \r\nweeks ago in Belgrade, Serbia must implement \r\nagreements with Kosovo, allow the European Union \r\nRule of Law Mission in Kosovo (EULEX) to operate in \r\nthe entire territory of Kosovo, and abolish the parallel \r\nstructures in the north. We are waiting to see whether \r\nthis message has been well understood in Belgrade. \r\n A/66/PV.24\r\n \r\n19 11-51378 \r\n \r\n The Serbian representative referred to a document \r\nknown as the Dick Marty report. Let me be clear: the \r\nAlbanian Government considers this report, and the \r\nheinous crimes it alleges, to be pure speculation, \r\nmisleading assertions and unfounded conclusions that \r\nhave no match with reality.  \r\n Albania is a democracy, a State of the rule of law \r\nand a society that has put respect for human rights and \r\ndignity at the foundations of its society. Albania, as a \r\nparty most interested in the truth, has officially invited \r\nEULEX to investigate in full, and in a transparent and \r\nindependent manner, all aspects of those allegations \r\nthat involve any part of Albanian territory.  \r\n For that very reason, Albania voted for the \r\nresolution of the Council of Europe Parliamentary \r\nAssembly, as it believes that the ongoing investigation \r\nis the only way to cut short the loud propaganda, which \r\nwe heard again this evening and which has been going \r\non for too long.  \r\n The question is whether Serbia will be able to \r\naccept the findings of the EULEX investigation or will \r\nact in the way that it did with regard to the advisory \r\nopinion of the International Court of Justice, which, as \r\nI have said, Serbia itself asked for. \r\n Albania and Serbia are two democracies, \r\nmembers of the south-east European community, which \r\nwe believe is moving fast towards the future it \r\ndeserves. We look forward to, and are working \r\ntowards, a more integrated region at all levels. \r\n As has been repeatedly stated, we are ready to \r\ndevelop bilateral relations with Serbia, in the very \r\nsame way as we are developing them with all the other \r\ncountries in the region. We have many common issues \r\nto develop in what we see as our common agenda, the \r\nmost important one being European Union integration, \r\nwhich we think should be the main drive for our \r\ncommon future.  \r\n Mr. Milanović (Serbia): My delegation has said \r\nall that we deemed necessary in relation to the \r\nstatement of the Prime Minister of Albania. It is up to \r\nthe members of the Assembly to draw their own \r\nconclusions, since we see no need to prolong this \r\nexchange. \r\n Mr. Hoxha (Albania): I am really glad that we at \r\nleast agree that we have no need to prolong this \r\ndiscussion. \r\n  The meeting rose at 8.10 p.m. \r\n"
