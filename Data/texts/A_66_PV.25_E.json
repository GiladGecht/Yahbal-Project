Merafhe, Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of Botswana, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum. \r\n The President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Mompati S. Merafhe, \r\nVice-President of the Republic of Botswana, and \r\ninviting him to address the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Marafhe (Botswana): It is with infinite \r\npleasure, Mr. President, that I join other speakers who \r\npreceded me in expressing our felicitations to you on \r\nyour election to the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-sixth session. We owe an \r\nimmense debt of gratitude to your great country, the \r\nState of Qatar, for making you available to the service \r\nof the international community. We are confident that \r\nunder your guidance and leadership the sixty-sixth \r\nsession will achieve a successful outcome, one which \r\nwill make a difference to the lives of multitudes of \r\ndisadvantaged people around the world. May I also pay \r\ntribute to your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Joseph \r\nDeiss, whose effective and exemplary stewardship of \r\nthe sixty-fifth session earned our deep respect and \r\nadmiration. \r\n As the world’s problems have in recent decades \r\nincreased in numbers and complexity, so have the \r\nchallenges and responsibilities of the United Nations \r\nSecretary-General, the head of our grand institution. I \r\nam pleased to note that the Secretary-General, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, has acquitted himself \r\nextremely well, at times under very difficult \r\ncircumstances. We specifically wish to commend him \r\nfor his concerted efforts in raising the alarm on conflict \r\nsituations and emerging threats to international peace \r\nand security. Allow me therefore to seize this \r\nopportunity to sincerely congratulate Secretary-General \r\nBan Ki-moon on his well-deserved reappointment for a \r\nsecond term. \r\n My delegation is of the conviction that all \r\nproblems and challenges confronting humanity can be \r\nresolved within the letter and spirit of the United \r\nNations Charter and international law. In that \r\nconnection, we must each do our part and work \r\ntogether to improve the lives of our people by \r\nconquering hunger, disease and illiteracy, to encourage \r\nrespect for human rights and freedoms and to respond \r\nto natural disasters and different humanitarian \r\nsituations. \r\n Once again this year, the world has experienced a \r\nnumber of natural and man-made disasters, including \r\nviolent, senseless attacks that have claimed numerous \r\nlives, left many homeless, caused massive destruction \r\nof property and caused intolerable pain and suffering. \r\nA/66/PV.25  \r\n \r\n11-51384 2 \r\n \r\nMy delegation wishes to express our heartfelt \r\ncondolences to all those countries that have been \r\nvictims of those tragedies. \r\n Our profound sympathies and heartfelt \r\ncondolences go to the Government and people of Japan \r\nfor the unfortunate Fukushima incident, triggered by a \r\nmassive earthquake and subsequent tsunami that struck \r\nthat country early this year. We also wish to convey our \r\ncondolences and sympathies to the Government and \r\npeople of Norway on the recent senseless and \r\nhorrifying attack that left many people dead. \r\n The humanitarian situation in the Horn of Africa \r\nequally deserves our attention. We commend the \r\nUnited Nations for calling the attention of the \r\ninternational community to the plight of the victims of \r\nthat disaster. We in Botswana have made our modest \r\ncontribution to that relief effort. We express our sincere \r\nappreciation to the United Nations system and the \r\ninternational community as a whole for their generous \r\nand timely response to those tragedies. \r\n At the inception of the United Nations, the \r\ninternational community pledged a solemn \r\ndetermination to safeguard succeeding generations \r\nfrom the scourge of war. In the intervening period, the \r\nworld has seen monumental changes with profound \r\neffects on humanity. The end of colonialism and the \r\ncold war, the defeat of the inhuman system of \r\napartheid, the institutionalization of conflict prevention \r\nand resolution mechanisms around the world, as well \r\nas the strengthening of collaboration between the \r\nUnited Nations and regional organizations in dealing \r\nwith conflict situations, come to mind in this regard. \r\n For decades the people of South Sudan have been \r\nengulfed in a seemingly endless bloody conflagration, \r\naccompanied by heavy loss of human life, destruction \r\nof property and condemnation to untold misery and \r\nsuffering. However, we are delighted that the people of \r\nSouth Sudan, with the assistance and support of the \r\ninternational community, have realized their long-\r\ncherished dream. They now face a new dawn of \r\nfreedom and nationhood. Allow me, therefore, to pay a \r\nfitting tribute to South Sudan on the assumption of her \r\nrightful place in the comity of nations as a sovereign \r\nand independent State and the 193rd Member of the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n South Sudan will obviously need the full support \r\nof the international community in addressing the \r\nplethora of challenges of nationhood, including \r\noutstanding issues from the Comprehensive Peace \r\nAgreement such as the future of the Abyei region, and \r\nother separation issues that could easily undermine this \r\nfragile transition. Botswana will endeavour, within the \r\nlimit of her resources, to assist our brothers and sisters \r\nin South Sudan translate their political freedom into \r\ntangible social and economic benefits. \r\n The evolving situation in Côte d’Ivoire is also a \r\ncause for optimism. While many security concerns \r\nremain, we believe President Ouattara and his \r\nGovernment have put in place the necessary measures \r\nto consolidate peace, build confidence, promote \r\nnational reconciliation and set the country on the path \r\nto normalcy, reconstruction and sustainable \r\ndevelopment. We urge the international community to \r\nremain actively engaged in supporting this process. \r\n While notable strides have been made towards \r\nresolving some conflicts, regrettably the same cannot \r\nbe said of many other conflict situations, such as those \r\nin the Middle East, Somalia and Syria, where peace \r\nremains elusive, with attendant hardship and misery. \r\n On Somalia, my delegation takes note of the \r\nconclusion of the recent Kampala Accord between the \r\nPresident of the Federal Transitional Government and \r\nthe Speaker of Parliament, which is a welcome move \r\ntowards improving the political situation in that \r\ncountry. However, we remain concerned about the \r\ndeteriorating security situation and the growing \r\nhumanitarian crisis in that country, and we call on all \r\nparties to remain engaged and to fully honour their \r\nobligations under that Accord. \r\n Regarding the Middle East, Botswana shares the \r\ngeneral frustration at the prolonged impasse in the \r\nsituation in that region. We call on both the \r\nPalestinians and Israelis to remain engaged in the \r\nnegotiations on the basis of a two-State solution, in \r\nwhich the two peoples will live side by side in peace \r\nand harmony. \r\n There are other emerging threats to international \r\npeace and security. My delegation is deeply concerned \r\nabout States that continue to violate with impunity \r\ntheir obligations under their constitutions and \r\ninternational law to protect their citizens from any \r\narmed conflict.  \r\n This very Organization is founded on the premise \r\nthat Governments have the primary duty and \r\nresponsibility to do all in their power to safeguard the \r\n A/66/PV.25\r\n \r\n3 11-51384 \r\n \r\nlegitimate aspirations of their people for a better life, \r\nincluding ensuring their safety and security. It is \r\ntherefore imperative that Governments provide an \r\nenvironment conducive to addressing the legitimate \r\nconcerns and grievances of their people through \r\ninclusive dialogue and mutual understanding. \r\n Consequently, it is not acceptable under any \r\ncircumstances for any State to use military force \r\nagainst the civilian population — the very citizens it \r\nhas sworn to protect. I believe we all agree that this is a \r\nclear violation of human rights and international law \r\nand an infringement of our common value system \r\nenshrined in the United Nations Charter. \r\n Our view is that any leader who sanctions such \r\nuse of force on his people forfeits the legitimate right \r\nto be recognized as representing the interests of his \r\npeople. The international community should therefore \r\nspare no effort in applying all the necessary measures \r\nat its disposal to protect civilians from such repressive \r\nGovernments and to hold them accountable for their \r\natrocities. In this regard, support for the International \r\nCriminal Court (ICC) is crucial for realizing the full \r\nimplementation of the Rome Statute. \r\n We commend the Security Council for its swift \r\nand resolute action on Libya under its resolution 1973 \r\n(2011), which authorized NATO to protect civilians in \r\nthat country.  \r\n However, we remain concerned about the delay \r\nand procrastination on a number of situations in Syria. \r\nThe Council’s condemnation of human rights \r\nviolations and the military assault on civilians by Syria \r\ncame rather too late. It failed to convey a clear and \r\nunequivocal message of revulsion to the Syrian \r\nauthorities and to urge them to respect international \r\nhumanitarian law and human rights. Crimes against \r\nhumanity have been committed in Syria, and the \r\nleadership in that country should answer for such \r\ncrimes through the ICC. \r\n It is important that the international community \r\nremain vigilant against any breach of international \r\npeace and security and also respond in a decisive, \r\nconsistent and timely manner to any such instances. We \r\nfind it unacceptable that such countries as mentioned \r\ncan continue to belong to a community of peace-loving \r\nnations. \r\n Botswana recognizes the National Transitional \r\nCouncil (NTC) in Libya as the interim Administration \r\nuntil there is an elected Government. We therefore \r\nwelcome the NTC into the United Nations family to \r\nrepresent the Libyan people during this session. \r\n The chosen theme for this session — the role of \r\nmediation in the peaceful settlement of disputes — is \r\nboth timely and pertinent. It is timely, given the \r\nmultiplicity of mediation efforts in which the \r\ninternational community is currently engaged as part of \r\nan effort to find a peaceful solution to the conflicts \r\nraging in various parts of the world. It is pertinent in \r\nthat forging international peace and understanding is \r\nthe raison d’être of this very body. \r\n In order to maintain momentum in governance, \r\nmy delegation believes that countries emerging from \r\nconflict should also commit themselves to the strict \r\nobservance of human rights and national and \r\ninternational humanitarian law, as well as of the values \r\nof accountability and transparency, guided by effective \r\napplication of the rule of law. In this respect, I wish to \r\nreiterate my country’s support for all efforts geared \r\ntowards assisting countries emerging from conflict to \r\nmake successful transitions to post-conflict \r\nrehabilitation, reconstruction and economic recovery. \r\n Allow me now to turn to another critical pillar of \r\nthe United Nations mandate, namely, sustainable \r\ndevelopment and the eradication of poverty. Now more \r\nthan ever, our global citizenry is demanding practical \r\nactions to address the global challenges we face. They \r\nbelieve — and rightly so — that collectively we are \r\nequipped with enough resources, institutions, policies \r\nand lessons learned to respond effectively to existing \r\nand emerging global challenges. They therefore expect \r\nus to muster the requisite political will to find durable \r\nsolutions to those challenges.  \r\n For them, it is no longer acceptable for children \r\nto die from HIV and AIDS or any other preventable \r\ndisease just because the Agreement on Trade-Related \r\nAspects of Intellectual Property Rights hinders access \r\nto affordable treatment. They do not accept that over \r\n113 million children have no access to primary \r\neducation. It is certainly no longer acceptable for \r\npeople to die from cholera and other waterborne \r\ndiseases when affordable technology for clean water \r\nand sanitation exists. Nor is it acceptable for our \r\npeople to continue to be exposed to the dire \r\nconsequences of climate change, while we debate \r\nendlessly instead of concluding a comprehensive, \r\nA/66/PV.25  \r\n \r\n11-51384 4 \r\n \r\nlegally binding climate change regime to curb global \r\nwarming and its effects.  \r\n In other words, our people want us to do more \r\nwith the collective resources that we have at our \r\ndisposal. \r\n The residual effects of the financial and economic \r\ncrisis, coupled with ongoing uncertainties in the global \r\neconomy and the prevailing high cost of energy and \r\nfood, have compounded the setbacks experienced in \r\nthe implementation of internationally agreed goals and \r\ncommitments, including the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. We must ensure that sustainable development in \r\nall its three pillars — social, economic and \r\nenvironmental — remains the key framework for \r\nattaining a balanced approach towards development in \r\nour countries. In that context, poverty eradication \r\nshould remain the centrepiece of all our policies and \r\nprogrammes.  \r\n As we prepare for a common global policy on \r\nsustainable development in Brazil in June of next year, \r\nwe are increasingly concerned about the negative trend \r\nthe negotiations are taking. The ongoing climate \r\nchange negotiations, the failed nineteenth session of \r\nthe Commission on Sustainable Development and the \r\nongoing discussions on the 2012 United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development continue to \r\nexpose deep divisions among our countries. \r\nUnfortunately, those divisions undermine the \r\nimplementation of existing commitments and threaten \r\nprospects for an effective global sustainable \r\ndevelopment regime. We believe that the Rio+20 \r\nprocesses present an excellent platform for all Member \r\nStates, individually and collectively, to muster their \r\nresolve towards the attainment of sustainable \r\ndevelopment. \r\n Similarly, the seventeenth Conference of the \r\nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention \r\non Climate Change, to be held in South Africa later this \r\nyear, offers the international community yet another \r\nvaluable opportunity to reverse the harmful effects of \r\nclimate change on our planet. We must forge a spirit of \r\ncooperation and partnership, including through South-\r\nSouth cooperation, public-private partnerships, \r\nresource mobilization and technology transfer, as well \r\nas capacity-building, to assist countries such as my \r\nown to exploit the abundant coal reserves for \r\nsustainable energy production in a manner less harmful \r\nto the environment. \r\n Significant progress was made in that respect last \r\nSeptember, when we resolved to take effective \r\nmeasures to further strengthen support for and meet the \r\nspecial needs of regions and countries struggling to \r\nachieve economic and social development, including \r\nmiddle-income countries. Recent experience has shown \r\nthat even that category of countries, which have made \r\nsmall gains in poverty reduction, are still vulnerable in \r\nthe event of further global economic and financial \r\nupheaval. \r\n The limitations imposed by our fragile economy \r\nand the landlocked position of my country, Botswana, \r\nalso call for the speedy implementation of the Almaty \r\nProgramme of Action, accompanied by renewed efforts \r\nto level the playing field in international trade. We \r\nmust muster the political will to conclude the Doha \r\nRound of the World Trade Organization trade \r\nnegotiations as soon as possible. \r\n We as nations, individually and collectively, face \r\nthe greatest challenge of our time — the uplifting of \r\nhumankind. In fulfilling that mammoth task, our \r\ngreatest hope lies in our ability as leaders to summon \r\nour courage and political will to do what is right. \r\n Let me conclude by reaffirming Botswana’s \r\ncommitment to working with other Members in our \r\ncommon endeavour to put our Organization at the \r\nservice of humanity. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of Botswana for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\n Mr. Mompati S. Merafhe, Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of Botswana, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Mohamed Waheed, Vice-\r\nPresident of the Republic of Maldives \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Mohamed Waheed, \r\nVice-President of the Republic of Maldives. \r\n Mr. Mohamed Waheed, Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of Maldives, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum. \r\n The President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Mohamed Waheed, \r\n A/66/PV.25\r\n \r\n5 11-51384 \r\n \r\nVice-President of the Republic of Maldives, and \r\ninviting him to address the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Waheed (Maldives): Allow me at the outset, \r\nMr. President, to join previous speakers in \r\ncongratulating you warmly on your assumption of \r\noffice to preside over the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-sixth session. Your election is testimony to the \r\ngrowing confidence of the international community in \r\nthe ability and commitment of the smaller Members of \r\nthis Organization to play an increasingly active and \r\nresponsible role in the United Nations. I would also \r\nlike to take this opportunity to place on record our deep \r\nand abiding appreciation to your predecessor, \r\nMr. Joseph Deiss, for the exemplary manner in which \r\nhe guided the work of the sixty-fifth session. \r\n Allow me also to convey my sincere felicitations \r\nto the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ban \r\nKi-moon, on his re-election for a second term. We \r\nremain confident that his experience and leadership \r\nwill ensure that this Organization, in which so many of \r\nour hopes and dreams are invested, will be equal to the \r\nmany complex challenges facing us during these \r\ntumultuous times. \r\n We are at a defining moment in history. Across \r\nthe Middle East and North Africa, popular \r\npro-democracy uprisings are sweeping away \r\nlongstanding dictatorships. We are witnessing the \r\ngreatest liberation movement since the fall of the \r\nBerlin Wall. But what is most striking is that it is \r\nhappening in countries with predominantly Muslim \r\npopulations. The democratic uprisings across the \r\nMiddle East prove that Muslims yearn for democratic \r\nrights just as much as non-Muslims.  \r\n For me, that is not surprising. After all, we are all \r\nhuman. We all feel resentment if those in power steal \r\nour county’s wealth. We all feel frustrated if we are \r\nprevented from speaking our minds.  \r\n In the fog and confusion of the turmoil we are \r\nwitnessing in the Middle East, one thing stands \r\nabundantly clear. The demand for human rights and \r\ndemocratic values is universal. The march of \r\ndemocracy is inevitable. And the argument that says \r\nIslam and democracy cannot be united is shown to be \r\nfoolish and patronizing.  \r\n My country, the Maldives, in some ways was a \r\nharbinger of the Arab awakening. Our revolution began \r\neight years ago. Then, in 2008, presidential elections \r\nbrought peaceful closure to a 30-year authoritarian \r\nregime. Since then, we have had our difficulties \r\nconsolidating democracy. There are many hurdles to \r\novercome. \r\n But I am pleased to report that in the three years \r\nsince the elections Maldives is generally stable, safe \r\nand successful. I do not want to sound complacent. \r\nDemocracy is a process, not an end goal. Freedoms are \r\nalways threatened in one way or the other. A successful \r\ndemocracy requires more than just the separation of \r\npowers. We also need free media, strong institutions \r\nand a vibrant civil society. Above all, we need patience \r\nto realize the fruits that democracy brings. \r\n Nevertheless, I can report without exaggeration \r\nthat Maldives enjoys more freedoms today than at any \r\nother point in our history. I am sure that, with the \r\nsupport of the United Nations, the peoples of Tunisia, \r\nEgypt, Libya and other countries will also enjoy \r\ndemocratic freedoms. \r\n We must counter the false perception that people \r\nmust choose between devotion to Islam on the one \r\nhand, and the full enjoyment of human rights on the \r\nother. We strongly believe in the compatibility of Islam \r\nand human rights and seek to do our part to promote \r\nunderstanding and tolerance. That is why we intend to \r\norganize, during 2012, a major international conference \r\non progressive Islamic jurisprudence and human rights. \r\nWith this conference, we hope to renew the concepts of \r\npeace and tolerance, coexistence and inter-faith \r\nharmony in Islam. \r\n As we watch the changes in the Middle East and \r\nNorth Africa, it has become even more imperative that \r\nthe question of Palestine be addressed. The Maldives \r\nstands shoulder to shoulder with the Palestinian people. \r\nThe time for Palestine to join the international family \r\nof nations is long overdue. We therefore welcome its \r\napplication for statehood. The Maldives calls on all \r\nMembers to support the recognition of a Palestinian \r\nState, living side by side and at peace with the State of \r\nIsrael. While recognizing the rights of the Palestinians, \r\nwe also value and support the right of the people of \r\nIsrael to live in peace and security. \r\n We are proud to announce that last week \r\nMaldives acceded to the Rome Statute of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court. Maldives believes that \r\nhuman rights must be protected at the national and \r\ninternational levels alike. We are pleased to join a \r\ngrowing alliance of States that stand firmly against \r\nA/66/PV.25  \r\n \r\n11-51384 6 \r\n \r\nthose who believe they can violate human rights with \r\nimpunity. In our globalized world, those who trample \r\nhuman rights or deny basic freedoms will be held \r\naccountable. I am proud that the Maldives has now \r\ntaken its rightful place as a defender of international \r\nlaw and human rights. \r\n As a small island State, we understand that our \r\nmeans are modest. Nevertheless, we are proud to \r\ncontribute to United Nations efforts to promote peace \r\nand security. In this regard, we are pleased to note that \r\nfollowing the approval of our Parliament, the Maldives \r\nis looking forward to becoming engaged for the first \r\ntime in United Nations peacekeeping efforts around the \r\nworld. \r\n As a newly graduated least developed country \r\n(LDC), we welcome the international support we have \r\nreceived in our transition. Our graduation from LDC to \r\nmiddle-income status has not been easy. Based on our \r\nexperience, I would like to say that the international \r\ncommunity must continue to help States make a \r\nsmooth transition from LDC status. We must not allow \r\ngraduation from LDC status, and the removal of \r\nsupport that comes with it, to undermine a country’s \r\nprogress and development. \r\n The Maldives has spared no effort in highlighting \r\nthe growing threats posed by climate change. Our \r\nnation is just one and a half metres above sea level. For \r\nus, climate change is no vague or abstract menace, but \r\na clear and present danger to our very existence as a \r\nnation-State. Over the past year, the world has \r\nexperienced an increase in natural and man-made \r\ndisasters, which compels us to address the effects of \r\nclimate change with more resolutely and urgently. It is \r\nbecoming increasingly evident that the international \r\ncommunity needs to be better prepared and equipped to \r\naddress the challenges of disaster preparedness and \r\nresponse. \r\n Cutting global carbon dioxide emissions to a \r\nsafer level — below 350 parts per million — is not just \r\nan environmental issue. It is also an issue of national \r\nsecurity. We view the cutting of carbon emissions not \r\nas a burden but rather as an opportunity — an \r\nopportunity not just to protect the climate, but also to \r\ncreate new jobs and grow our economies. For these \r\nreasons, Maldives is proud to announce that we will \r\ndedicate a minimum of 2 per cent of our total \r\nGovernment revenue to investments in renewable \r\nenergy.  \r\n We look forward to the day when the \r\ninternational community will adopt a legally binding \r\nclimate treaty. We welcome the incorporation of the \r\npolitical pledges contained in the Copenhagen Accord \r\ninto the United Nations Framework Convention on \r\nClimate Change process in Cancún. In Durban, we look \r\nforward to helping to advance the process so that we \r\ncan reach the elusive prize of an agreement that \r\nprotects the climate and the interests of vulnerable \r\nnation-States. \r\n From the very beginning, the sustainable \r\ndevelopment of small island developing States (SIDS) \r\nhas been inextricably linked to the Rio process. \r\nUnfortunately, the objectives defined in the Barbados \r\nProgramme of Action and the Mauritius Strategy have, \r\nlike the goals expressed in the Rio Declaration on \r\nEnvironment and Development, gone largely unmet. \r\n Now, as we set the goals of the United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development, we must \r\ninclude in the agenda a serious review of the progress \r\nmade by the international community in addressing the \r\nsustainable development challenges facing small island \r\ndeveloping States. The Maldives hopes that Rio 2012 \r\nwill provide a platform and create the necessary \r\nimpetus to radically reform international support for \r\nSIDS. This should pave the way for establishing a \r\nSIDS category based on objective, transparent and \r\nconsistent criteria.  \r\n We must also analyse and identify the particular \r\nchallenges and needs of SIDS, which are different from \r\nthose of other developing countries. We must further \r\nensure that United Nations programmes are redesigned \r\nto assist with those particular challenges. Maldives \r\nbelieves that three issues should form some of the key \r\npillars to be discussed and acted upon in Rio next year. \r\nThey are, first, the reform of United Nations support \r\nfor the sustainable development of SIDS, secondly, a \r\npolitical declaration and strategy to give impetus to the \r\nroll-out and mobilization of renewable energy and \r\ngreen technologies, and lastly, improvements in the \r\nintegration of sustainable development principles into \r\ninternational and domestic policy at strategic and \r\nproject levels alike. \r\n We are deeply concerned by the dire food crisis \r\nin the Horn of Africa. As the United Nations, we must \r\ncome together to find global solutions to these \r\nchallenges and ensure that we work to protect the \r\n A/66/PV.25\r\n \r\n7 11-51384 \r\n \r\nrights of those who are most vulnerable, especially \r\nwomen and children.  \r\n As a country that derives its livelihood from the \r\nocean, we are also concerned by the growing threat of \r\npiracy in the Indian Ocean. We will continue to work \r\nwith the international community in addressing this \r\ngrowing menace so as to make our maritime areas safe \r\nfor international shipping and trade. \r\n The Maldives looks forward to a time when every \r\ncountry will be democratic, every nation will be free \r\nand the values that underpin this great institution can \r\nfinally be realized everywhere. Through the institutions \r\nof the United Nations, we look forward to continuing \r\nto promote equity, fairness and the protection of the \r\nmost vulnerable, regardless of where they live or what \r\nreligion they practise. \r\n Only through the United Nations can we hope to \r\nforge an agreement that protects our climate — a \r\nprerequisite for all of our future progress and \r\ndevelopment. In this volatile and ever-changing world, \r\nthere is one institution that provides the stability of \r\ncontinuity, and that is the United Nations. The United \r\nNations is more important today than ever before. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of Maldives for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\n  Mr. Mohamed Waheed, Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of Maldives, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum.  \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Joseph Boakai, Vice-President \r\nof the Republic of Liberia \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the Vice-President of the Republic of \r\nLiberia. \r\n  Mr. Joseph Boakai, Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of Liberia, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n  The President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Joseph Boakai, Vice-\r\nPresident of the Republic of Liberia, and inviting him \r\nto address the Assembly.  \r\n  Mr. Boakai (Liberia): Liberia congratulates you, \r\nMr. President, on your election to the important office \r\nof President of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth \r\nsession. We are confident that you will steer the work \r\nof this session in a manner which brings pride to your \r\ngreat country, the State of Qatar. Mr. President, we \r\nwish you well and pledge Liberia’s full support to you \r\nin pursuit of the priorities which you have identified. \r\n Let me also pay tribute to your predecessor, His \r\nExcellency Joseph Deiss of Switzerland, for the \r\neffective manner in which he conducted the affairs of \r\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. His \r\nsound and outstanding leadership enabled the session \r\nto register many achievements. \r\n We warmly congratulate the Secretary-General, \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, on his unanimous \r\nre-election, and extend the highest commendation to \r\nhim for his vision and foresight, and for the tireless \r\nefforts with which he continues to administer the \r\nOrganization. We embrace the priorities which he has \r\nset for his second term, which are centred on \r\nsustainable development. \r\n It gives me great pleasure to welcome and \r\ncongratulate the Republic of South Sudan upon its \r\nadmission as the 193rd Member of the United Nations \r\nand to assure it of Liberia’s friendship, support and \r\nsolidarity. \r\n The theme chosen for this year’s general debate, \r\n“The role of mediation in the settlement of disputes by \r\npeaceful means”, could not have been selected at a \r\nmore opportune time. Communities within our world \r\ncontinue to be polarized by conflicts which have their \r\nroots in political marginalization and socio-economic \r\ninequities. Despite global interdependence, inter-State \r\nrelations are still constrained by divergent ideological \r\nconvictions and structural inequalities in the global \r\neconomic system. These have resulted in divisions \r\nwhich undermine our efforts to move as one global \r\ncommunity towards sustainable development. \r\n Mediation, as part of preventive diplomacy, is \r\nindeed a powerful dispute-resolution mechanism. The \r\nUnited Nations has a central role in promoting \r\nmediation in pursuit of peace. The good offices of the \r\nSecretary-General remain critical to the mediation \r\nefforts of the United Nations. Regional and subregional \r\norganizations are assuming an increasingly active and \r\ncomplementary role in mediation and the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes. These initiatives must not only \r\nbe acknowledged and encouraged but also supported \r\nby the global community. \r\nA/66/PV.25  \r\n \r\n11-51384 8 \r\n \r\n As a post-conflict country, Liberia has benefited \r\nimmensely from numerous mediation efforts that \r\ninclude national, regional and international initiatives \r\naimed at restoring and maintaining stability in the \r\ncountry. Our experience leads us to suggest that greater \r\nemphasis be placed on preventive measures, and that \r\nthe tools of mediation be employed as soon as early \r\nwarning signs of conflict emerge. The benefits of \r\nestablishing an early-warning system that will deal \r\nwith potentially explosive situations before they \r\ndegenerate into full-blown infernos are obvious. \r\n It has been nearly a decade since this body and \r\nfriendly nations intervened to restore Liberia to \r\nnormalcy. That intervention ended a disastrous 14-year \r\ncivil war and created conditions for the deployment of \r\nthe United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL), the \r\nestablishment of a transitional Government and the \r\ndemocratic election of Africa’s first female President. \r\n Consistent with our commitment to national \r\nrecovery and post-war reconstruction, we have \r\ndeveloped programmes and policies specifically aimed \r\nat lifting Liberians to higher levels of productivity, \r\nreviving basic services, restoring infrastructure and \r\nre-establishing the rule of law. Overall, we are making \r\nprogress on all of these fronts and building a more \r\ninclusive society in which the full potential of all of \r\nour citizens can be harnessed. \r\n In this endeavour, special emphasis has been \r\nplaced on the empowerment of women and their \r\nparticipation in all aspects of the national endeavour. A \r\nwell-crafted gender policy is enabling the Government \r\nto address the concerns of women and girls. We \r\nconsider the creation of the gender entity UN-Women \r\nto be an important positive development in the context \r\nof the United Nations effort to promote women’s \r\nempowerment. Liberia pledges its fullest support for \r\nthe success of this important body. \r\n Cognizant that youths constitute the highest \r\npercentage of our population, we are committed to \r\ndeveloping programmes that will strengthen and \r\nempower them for future leadership. We hope that the \r\naction plan adopted by the recent United Nations High-\r\nlevel Meeting on Youth will garner international \r\nsupport for our youth programmes. \r\n We are continuing to progress in our efforts to \r\nreform our security sector. Special attention is focused \r\non building the capacity of the Liberian National \r\nPolice. However, we remain deeply concerned about \r\nevents affecting security in the Mano River Basin. That \r\nis why we are thankful to the Security Council for \r\nextending the mandate of UNMIL. \r\n Liberia is pleased to have been placed on the \r\nagenda of the Peacebuilding Commission (PBC). The \r\nLiberia configuration of the PBC and the \r\nPeacebuilding Support Office have worked with the \r\nLiberian Government and other stakeholders in \r\ndeveloping the Liberia priority plan, which focuses on \r\nsecurity-sector reform, strengthening the rule of law \r\nand accelerating national reconciliation. \r\n I would like at this juncture to thank His \r\nExcellency Prince Zeid Ra’ad Zeid Al-Hussein, \r\nPermanent Representative of Jordan and Chairman of \r\nthe Liberia configuration, and the configuration’s \r\nmembers for their commitment and dedication. In the \r\nsame spirit, I also commend His Excellency \r\nMr. Eugène-Richard Gasana, Chairman of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, and its members for their \r\nsupport for the configuration. \r\n We would be remiss if we did not acknowledge \r\nthe significant role being played by the Economic \r\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) in the \r\nmaintenance of peace and security in the subregion. \r\nECOWAS member States are contributing tangibly to \r\npeacebuilding in Liberia by strengthening capacity, \r\nespecially in the technical area. We are also \r\ncollaborating as a subregion in addressing the common \r\nproblems of transnational organized crime, human and \r\ndrug trafficking, and the illicit trade in small arms and \r\nlight weapons. \r\n Liberia is poised to conduct another democratic \r\nelection on 11 October. It will test our commitment to \r\ndemocratic governance and peaceful coexistence. \r\nEvery action is being taken to ensure that the elections \r\nare free, fair, transparent and credible. We invite the \r\ninternational community to observe and monitor these \r\nelections. \r\n Despite the significant gains made in improving \r\nthe living conditions of our people, we realize that far \r\nmore needs to be done to fully meet their aspirations. \r\nHowever, negative economic forces continue to hamper \r\nglobal growth. This situation has had repercussions for \r\nall countries. Although the resulting effects have \r\nimpacted developing countries generally, those most \r\naffected are in Africa, where the crippling effects of \r\nexternal debt, deteriorating terms of trade, decline in \r\ninvestment and capital flows are debilitating. \r\n A/66/PV.25\r\n \r\n9 11-51384 \r\n \r\n Mr. Cancela (Uruguay), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n Post-conflict countries are even more severely \r\naffected. This is why we have particular appreciation \r\nfor the outcome of the Fourth United Nations \r\nConference on the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) \r\nconvened in Istanbul in May. We hope that the Istanbul \r\nProgramme of Action will bring real change for LDCs. \r\n Food security remains a concern for many \r\ndeveloping countries. The World Bank estimates that \r\n44 million people have slipped into poverty since June \r\nbecause of rising food prices. This unfortunate \r\nsituation should be addressed with urgency. We must \r\nact now, effectively and cooperatively, to roll back the \r\nadverse impacts of rising food prices and protect \r\ncommunities. \r\n Our Government is responding to the current rise \r\nin food prices with immediate action under the policy \r\nEnding Hunger in Liberia, which aims to strengthen \r\nthe entire agricultural food chain from securing quality \r\nseeds for farming in productive lowlands to connecting \r\nfarmers to local markets and eventually to regional and \r\nglobal ones. Simultaneously, we are deepening our \r\npartnership with the Food and Agricultural \r\nOrganization of the United Nations and other United \r\nNations bodies for long-term investments in \r\nmechanized agriculture to achieve food security in \r\nLiberia. \r\n While we seek food security, we are equally \r\nmindful of the need for health security. Liberia is \r\namong countries with the highest maternal and child \r\nmortality rates in the world. This is due primarily to \r\nthe lack of skilled health workers, poor health delivery \r\nsystems and inadequate medicines and supplies. This is \r\nwhy we welcome the new initiative of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral aimed at improving the health of women and \r\nchildren. \r\n I wish to state my country’s position on some of \r\nthe prevailing situations that threaten peace, security \r\nand international cooperation in our world. The \r\nunresolved riddle in Somalia presents a strong \r\nchallenge to the United Nations in relieving the Somali \r\npeople of the tragedy and cruelty they have endured for \r\nmany years. The phenomenon of famine has \r\nexacerbated the situation in that country and affected \r\nlivelihoods in the Horn and East Africa. Those \r\ncircumstances necessitate an urgent call for action. \r\n The question of peace in the Middle East has \r\nhovered over the world for far too long. Liberia \r\nbelieves that whether deliberations take place in the \r\nSecurity Council or the General Assembly, dialogue \r\nbetween the parties remains the most viable option for \r\nending the stalemate towards an independent Palestine. \r\nWe therefore call on Israel and Palestine to \r\ndemonstrate a concrete commitment to engaging each \r\nother in a constructive dialogue that will achieve the \r\ndesired two-State solution. \r\n Suppressive actions by Governments to frustrate \r\nthe desire of their people for democratic reforms must \r\nnever be condoned because they undermine \r\ninternational peace and security. Coherent and concrete \r\nactions by the Security Council are critical in \r\naddressing those situations. Liberia welcomes the new \r\nleadership of Libya under the National Transitional \r\nCouncil (NTC). After more than four decades of \r\nsuppression, the Libyan people have high expectations \r\nfor the restoration of their freedom and liberties. We \r\nencourage the NTC to move quickly to restore Libya to \r\nnormalcy by establishing an inclusive transitional \r\nGovernment that will organize democratic elections. \r\n As the United Nations grows in membership and \r\nexperience, Liberia joins other nations in calling for a \r\nmore democratic Security Council that reflects realities \r\nof the twenty-first century. Africa expects to have \r\ngreater representation in a reformed Security Council. \r\nMore broadly, we encourage the Secretary-General’s \r\ncontinuing effort to modernize the organization. \r\n Finally, it is my hope that Member States will \r\nwork together to advance the cause of our common \r\nhumanity, and make the world a better place in which \r\nto live. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nVice-President of the Republic of Liberia for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Joseph Boakai, Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of Liberia, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Danilo Astori, Vice-President of \r\nthe Eastern Republic of Uruguay  \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Vice-\r\nPresident of the Eastern Republic of Uruguay. \r\nA/66/PV.25  \r\n \r\n11-51384 10 \r\n \r\n Mr. Danilo Astori, Vice-President of the Eastern \r\nRepublic of Uruguay, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Danilo \r\nAstori, Vice-President of the Eastern Republic of \r\nUruguay, and inviting him to address the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n Mr. Astori (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): I come \r\nto speak before the Assembly representing a country \r\nthat is celebrating the two-hundredth anniversary of the \r\nendeavour that led to its birth as an independent and \r\nsovereign State, and that has preserved its aspiration to \r\ncontinue offering the international community its long-\r\nstanding tradition of respect for the principles of \r\ninternational law and its ongoing commitment to the \r\ncause of peace and peaceful coexistence among \r\nnations. \r\n Uruguay takes pride in its calling to serve the \r\ninternational community in promoting dialogue, \r\nunderstanding and the tireless search for consensus as \r\nthe most appropriate ways for interaction among its \r\nmembers. It was through the application of those \r\nprinciples that we recognized and welcomed this year \r\nthe 193rd Member of this Organization, the Republic \r\nof South Sudan.  \r\n Likewise, in March we recognized the State of \r\nPalestine. We believe that all of the necessary \r\nconditions have been met for this recognition to \r\nbecome universal and for the realization of a two-State \r\nsolution, which Uruguay has supported since 1947, as \r\nwell as for a path that reaffirms the right of Israel and \r\nPalestine to coexist in peace, within secure and \r\nrecognized borders, in a environment of renewed \r\ncooperation and free from any threats or actions that \r\ncould jeopardize peace. \r\n The Palestinian people have a legitimate and full \r\nright to statehood. But the Jewish people also have the \r\nundeniable right to live in peace in a safe country, free \r\nof terrorist attacks — attacks that Uruguay has always \r\nrejected and condemned. \r\n Uruguay is proud to have made a decisive \r\ncontribution to the creation of the State of Israel, \r\nwhose hard-working people have lived up to the \r\nhistoric vision of the men and women who made its \r\ncreation possible. We are convinced also that the time \r\nhas come for the Palestinian people to show the world \r\ntheir decisive contribution to peace, development and \r\ninternational cooperation. \r\n Once again, in keeping with our adherence to \r\ninternational law, we cannot but express our utmost \r\nrejection of coercive measures that violate the \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations, such as \r\nthe economic, trade and financial blockade imposed by \r\nthe United States against Cuba — a unilateral measure \r\nthat contravenes not only the Charter but also \r\ninternational law as well as one of the most important \r\nprinciples of my country’s foreign policy, namely, the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes. \r\n We reject all manner of violence and all threat or \r\nuse of illegal force, including terrorism — an unjust \r\nand unjustified crime, a cruel scourge that 10 years ago \r\nmost painfully affected New York City. We express our \r\ncondolences and solidarity to the victims’ families and \r\nthe American people, as well as our desire and \r\ncommitment to ensure that these kinds of acts never \r\nhappen again, here or anywhere else.  \r\n While we are guided by the principles of \r\ninternational law, the promotion and protection of \r\nhuman rights and international humanitarian law also \r\nfigure among the priorities of Uruguayan foreign \r\npolicy. This a reflection of the country’s political and \r\ninstitutional heritage, that of deep-seated democracy \r\nand the solid rule of law. \r\n Allow me to express in that respect my gratitude \r\nin connection with the honour conferred on us when \r\nUruguay was elected to chair the Human Rights \r\nCouncil. We will strive to honour this vote of \r\nconfidence by working every day to strengthen the \r\nmultilateral system for the protection and promotion of \r\nhuman rights. \r\n Uruguay has an outstanding record in this area, \r\nnot only because it is one of the countries that has \r\nsigned the widest array of conventions, but also \r\nbecause it has made specific contributions in diverse \r\nfields, including the defence of the rights of the child; \r\nthe mainstreaming of a gender perspective into all \r\nUnited Nations system policies and programmes, as \r\nreflected in the establishment and implementation of \r\nthe United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the \r\nEmpowerment of Women; and the promotion of \r\nfundamental freedoms, including, inter alia, freedom of \r\nexpression. \r\n A/66/PV.25\r\n \r\n11 11-51384 \r\n \r\n During the course of its mandate, our country \r\nintends to promote a new culture of dialogue on human \r\nrights — a culture that favours the cooperation of \r\ncountries with the system, but also of the system with \r\nthose countries that need assistance to improve their \r\ninternal human rights situation. We would also like to \r\nenhance the Council’s working methods and promote \r\nthe implementation of its instruments in a non-selective \r\nmanner, avoiding double standards. We would also like \r\nto strengthen the role of the Office of the United \r\nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights, as a \r\nkey element of promotion and protection mechanisms, \r\nby providing the resources necessary so that it can \r\neffectively discharge the mandates that Member States \r\nare increasingly assigning to it. \r\n Uruguay is not indifferent to situations of armed \r\nconflict. That is why we have made tremendous efforts \r\nin that respect and will continue to do so in order to \r\nmaintain and strengthen the applicable norms of \r\ninternational humanitarian law. \r\n In keeping with this, we believe that we cannot \r\nignore mass atrocities such as genocide, war crimes, \r\ncrimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing. Bearing \r\nin mind at all times the principle of non-intervention in \r\nthe internal affairs of other States — a principle that \r\nour country and region holds dear — we recognize the \r\nState’s primary responsibility to protect its population, \r\nas well as the importance of fostering cooperation with \r\nStates that might require international assistance to \r\nfulfil that obligation. The aim is not to weaken their \r\nsovereignty but, rather, to strengthen it. \r\n A few months ago, we welcomed the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to our country, and we congratulated him once \r\nagain on his re-election, which Uruguay \r\nenthusiastically supported from the outset. Mr. Ban \r\nKi-moon expressed the recognition of the international \r\ncommunity of one of the most relevant aspects of our \r\nforeign policy over the past several decades: our \r\nunwavering and committed participation in United \r\nNations peacekeeping operations. With approximately \r\n30 per cent of its operational defence forces devoted to \r\nthese operations, Uruguay is the main troop contributor \r\nas a proportion of its population and ranks 10th in \r\nabsolute terms. Uruguay thus places at the disposal of \r\nthe United Nations valuable human and material \r\nresources in the context of work that is the flagship of \r\nthis Organization, deploying in situations and \r\ndischarging mandates of increasingly complexity. \r\n Given the complexity of current international \r\naffairs, together we have begun an in-depth discussion \r\nof the United Nations peacekeeping system. We are \r\nconvinced that these missions will be sustainable only \r\nif we seriously reconsider the resources needed for \r\ntheir proper functioning and update the conditions \r\noffered by the system so as to ensure that the United \r\nNations is supplied with both equipment and human \r\nresources. \r\n Today peacekeeping operations are the most \r\nimportant and visible aspect of United Nations \r\nmissions and the one that most exposes the United \r\nNations to international scrutiny, often positive but \r\nsometimes negative. \r\n Uruguay reaffirms its commitment to \r\npeacekeeping operations and to the strictest \r\nenforcement of the mandates and standards regulating \r\nthe conduct of field personnel. That is why, in cases of \r\nshameful and unacceptable misconduct — such as that \r\nperpetrated by five members of our military deployed \r\nin Haiti, where since the beginning of the United \r\nNations Stabilization Mission in Haiti we have \r\ncontributed tens of thousands of men and women, some \r\nof whom have offered their lives to help that brother \r\ncountry consolidate peace and stability — we have not \r\nhesitated to act with the utmost severity and rigor as \r\nthe circumstances demanded. Under my country’s \r\nmilitary justice, those five individuals accused of \r\nmilitary crimes have now been sentenced to prison and \r\nthe case has been referred to the civil justice system to \r\ninitiate the corresponding criminal case. Thus, within \r\nthe framework of respect for due process and in the \r\nutmost transparency and cooperation with the relevant \r\nUnited Nations entities, we will stop at nothing to \r\nuncover the truth and punish those responsible. \r\n Our commitment to international peace and \r\nsecurity has also driven our country to play an active \r\nrole in the field of disarmament. Like many countries, \r\nUruguay has firmly promoted all initiatives aimed at \r\neliminating nuclear weapons and other weapons of \r\nmass destruction and at regulating the control and \r\nreduction of conventional weapons, which every year \r\ncause thousands of innocent civilian casualties. \r\n As a signatory of the Treaty of Tlatelolco, by \r\nvirtue of which Latin America and the Caribbean \r\nbecame the first nuclear-weapon-free zone, Uruguay \r\nhas decisively contributed to strengthening both the \r\nregional regime and the Treaty on the \r\nA/66/PV.25  \r\n \r\n11-51384 12 \r\n \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which is \r\nconsidered the cornerstone of the disarmament and \r\nnon-proliferation regime. Uruguay has adhered fully to \r\nthe five points identified by the Secretary-General. We \r\nbelieve that the international community must make \r\nthe most of progress to date to advance firmly towards \r\na world free from nuclear weapons. \r\n The topic of this year’s general debate is linked \r\nto the international peace and security agenda. We \r\ntherefore welcome the selection of a topic that \r\nunderlines the pressing need to strengthen the political \r\ncapacities of the United Nations. Professional and \r\naccurate prevention and mediation efforts could save \r\nthousands of human lives and billions of dollars of \r\nmaterial damage, thereby avoiding the loss of \r\ngenerations, growing resentment and despair, and a \r\nvicious cycle of violence can be broken only by \r\nreconciliation. \r\n That is why we welcome efforts to strengthen the \r\nrole of mediation and preventive diplomacy as \r\nmechanisms for dispute settlement. Such efforts can be \r\ncarried out at several levels. There can be no doubt that \r\nthe United Nations is the natural forum for such \r\nefforts, given its intrinsic legitimacy and impartiality. \r\nHowever, it cannot be denied that in practice such \r\nefforts must be complemented by the actions of \r\nregional entities and even individual countries, which \r\ncan be very effective, as has been shown in several \r\ninstances. In addition to the strengthening of the \r\naforementioned capacities, confronting global issues \r\nrequires the development of community spirit that \r\nrequires more than combined political will. A systemic \r\napproach is fundamental.  \r\n Climate change is probably the most obvious \r\nexample of an urgent global challenge. It is essential to \r\nimmediately start enforcing adaptation and mitigation \r\nmeasures against its adverse effects, since a \r\ncompromised environment will limit any development \r\neffort. We are aware that necessary measures require \r\nchanges in modes of production to avoid seriously \r\ncompromising resource distribution within our \r\ncountries. \r\n The Uruguayan Government strongly supports \r\nnegotiations on climate change under the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change \r\n(UNFCCC). We take this opportunity to call for \r\naccelerated efforts to ensure a second stage of \r\ncommitments on reducing greenhouse gas emissions in \r\nthe outcome of the next Conference of Parties to the \r\nUNFCCC. Furthermore, it is essential that progress be \r\nmade in the negotiations on chemicals, especially in \r\nthe context of the current exercise on mercury. The \r\nsensitivity and importance of this matter, which has \r\ngreatly potential to harm the environment, requires the \r\ncommitment of all countries in order to successfully \r\nconclude the current negotiations. \r\n Another priority of our country is the particular \r\nsituation of agriculture as it relates to the climate \r\nchange phenomenon. A huge number of developing \r\ncountries, including my own, depend on that sector, \r\nwhich is especially vulnerable to its negative \r\nconsequences. That is why agriculture requires a \r\nspecial chapter in the framework of the UNFCC \r\nnegotiations.  \r\n A new balance among many centres of power, the \r\nemergence of new States and intra-State conflicts have \r\ncalled for a reformulation of peace missions. Global \r\nthreats include climate change and terrorism, and an \r\ninternational criminal justice entity has been \r\nestablished. Profound political changes have taken \r\nplace in many countries. We now live in a different \r\nworld. But the changes do not affect only political and \r\nsecurity matters. Enormous transformations are taking \r\nplace in the global economy and development issues. \r\nDeveloped countries are facing serious difficulties in \r\ntheir efforts to recover from a deep economic crisis. \r\nNew, so-called emerging economies are playing a \r\ngrowing role in setting the direction of the world \r\neconomy. In recent years, the need to establish new \r\nregulations and global agreements has become ever \r\nmore apparent. We are entering a new era in \r\ninternational economic relations. \r\n In that context, we must remember that peace and \r\nstability will not be achieved without sustainable \r\ndevelopment. This year, the United Nations has taken \r\nvery significant steps in recognizing the link between \r\nsecurity and development, which is born not from \r\npolitical declarations, but from empirical evidence, and \r\nis a sine qua non of capacity-building at the national \r\nlevel.  \r\n The United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (Rio+20) will provide us with a unique \r\nopportunity to renew the will to achieve the goals and \r\ncommitments contained in Agenda 21 and the \r\nJohannesburg Plan of Implementation. The quest for \r\nlong-term development must be based on a \r\n A/66/PV.25\r\n \r\n13 11-51384 \r\n \r\ncomprehensive development concept that takes \r\neconomic, social and environmental dimensions into \r\naccount. We believe it essential that Rio+20 achieve \r\ntangible results that benefit our citizens. For that to \r\nhappen, issues related to technology transfer, technical \r\ntraining and financing for developing countries must be \r\ntaken into account.  \r\n Food security is a fundamental component of \r\nUruguay’s development agenda, as well as one of its \r\nnational priorities. We remain convinced that the \r\ncurrent critical situation is caused by structural causes \r\nthat must be resolved collectively and urgently. We are \r\nparticularly concerned by the paralysis in the \r\nnegotiations of the Doha Round of the World Trade \r\nOrganization. That ambitious exercise, one of whose \r\nobjectives is the reduction or elimination of trade \r\ndistortions, could, by strengthening trade, promote the \r\ndevelopment of the most disadvantaged countries of \r\nthe world. \r\n It is essential to eliminate agricultural subsidies. \r\nCountries that until a few decades ago were self-\r\nsufficient for their food needs now need to import a \r\nlarge part of what they consume, and they do so from \r\ncountries that subsidize their agricultural production. \r\nThe artificially low prices of agriculture exports, \r\nsustained for decades by some countries through \r\nsubsidies and other trade-distorting measures and \r\nlimitations on market access, are mainly responsible of \r\nthe food security problems.  \r\n Stimulating investment to increase production \r\nand improve productivity, a successful conclusion of \r\nthe Doha Round, as well as the transfer of adequate \r\ntechnology to developing countries, capable of \r\nachieving efficient agricultural economies, are \r\nfundamental to obtaining food security. \r\n As a middle-income country, Uruguay still faces \r\nserious development challenges, particularly in \r\neradicating poverty, diversifying production, \r\nintroducing technological innovation and promoting \r\nrenewable energy, to name but a few. The progress \r\nachieved must be consolidated, and to that end it is \r\nvital for us to be able to count on the support of the \r\ninternational community, and of the United Nations \r\nsystem in particular. I must reiterate the urgent need to \r\nconsider in depth a new cooperation modality or \r\nscheme that takes into account the specific \r\ndevelopment needs of middle-income countries like \r\nUruguay. \r\n Uruguay is committed to the reform process of \r\nthe Organization. Through the Global Governance \r\nGroup, we have maintained a proactive attitude in \r\norder to promote a strong bond between the United \r\nNations and informal discussion forums outside the \r\nsystem. However, it is critical to lead by example. For \r\nthat reason, we believe that improving global \r\ngovernance is first an internal task of the United \r\nNations system. In this regard, my country is very \r\nsatisfied with the results obtained in the pilot \r\nprogramme of Delivering as One, whose next \r\nintergovernmental conference will be held in \r\nNovember in Montevideo. \r\n For all these reason, but above all because of its \r\nfirm commitment to the cause of peace and \r\nmultilateralism, Uruguay is seeking a seat as a \r\nnon-permanent member of the Security Council in \r\n2016-2017. That would be our country’s second time in \r\nthe past 66 years, after having served in 1965-1966. \r\n In conclusion, consolidating multilateralism is \r\none of the most challenging international tasks. \r\nMultiple ongoing crises demand immediate response \r\nand action. The rise of new informal forums with a \r\nlimited number of members but a growing influence in \r\ninternational governance requires an additional \r\ncollective effort to strengthen the role of the United \r\nNations as a forum for political discussion in which all \r\nStates are able to participate in decision-making.  \r\n A permanent effort is required to combine \r\neffectiveness with legitimacy — a challenge that has \r\nbecome increasingly more significant as globalization \r\ndeepens. We need a new United Nations for the twenty-\r\nfirst century. The first decade of the century has \r\nalready run its course. History is harsh with those who \r\ncannot adapt to its challenges, and its consequences are \r\nbitter. At the United Nations, we are responsible for \r\nputting forward appropriate answers to the \r\ninternational community. There is still time. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nVice-President of the Eastern Republic of Uruguay for \r\nthe statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Danilo Astori, Vice-President of the Eastern \r\nRepublic of Uruguay, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\nA/66/PV.25  \r\n \r\n11-51384 14 \r\n \r\n  Address by Ms. Aja Isatou Njie-Saidy, Vice-\r\nPresident of the Republic of the Gambia \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Vice-\r\nPresident of the Republic of the Gambia. \r\n  Ms. Aja Isatou Njie-Saidy, Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of the Gambia, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming Her Excellency Ms. Aja \r\nIsatou Njie-Saidy, Vice-President of the Republic of \r\nthe Gambia, and inviting her to address the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n Ms. Njie-Saidy (Gambia): We praise Almighty \r\nGod for making another gathering of world leaders \r\npossible. Allow me to warmly congratulate \r\nMr. Al-Nasser on his election as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. His proven \r\nleadership and competence will certainly be in great \r\ndemand as we collectively confront some of the \r\ndaunting challenges of our time. My delegation also \r\nviews his election as a demonstration of the strong \r\ncommitment of the brotherly State of Qatar to the \r\nfashioning of a stable and just world order. He will \r\nhave our full support in the discharge of his mandate. \r\n His predecessor, Mr. Joseph Deiss of Switzerland, \r\nalso deserves our praise for the sterling work he did as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly. We wish him well \r\nin his future pursuits. We also congratulate Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon on his reappointment and wish \r\nhim a fruitful second term. My delegation will render \r\nhim all the support he will need as he helps to tackle \r\nthe issues that are dear to us, especially the \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs) and the resolution of conflicts in Africa, \r\namong others. \r\n The United Nations was founded as a world body \r\nprimarily to maintain international peace and security. \r\nFor this reason, the theme chosen for this General \r\nAssembly — “The role of mediation in the settlement \r\nof disputes by peaceful means” — is particularly apt. \r\nMy delegation is a strong believer in the role of \r\nmediation as a conflict resolution mechanism at both \r\nthe national and international levels. We can all agree \r\nthat mediation produces results. That is what our \r\nexperience in West Africa, my own part of the world, \r\ntells us. At the national level, for example, in the \r\nGambia we have instituted the alternative dispute \r\nresolution mechanism, among other mechanisms we \r\nhave in place, with a view to settling disputes between \r\nand among our peoples and institutions. \r\n For us in Africa, the mediation of conflicts, \r\nparticularly with a view to amicably resolving them, \r\nhas always been part and parcel of our rich cultural \r\nheritage and customary law. We must revive those \r\ntime-honoured dispute-resolution traditions of our \r\nforebears. Experience has also shown that with strong \r\nregional and subregional leadership many of the \r\nintractable civil, political and electoral conflicts that \r\nbeset and plague Africa could certainly be resolved \r\nthrough mediation.  \r\n Regional ownership of mediation processes is \r\nalso essential. For example, recent conflicts in Guinea \r\nand Guinea-Bissau were all resolved through a \r\ncombination of interventions by the Economic \r\nCommunity of West African States, the African Union \r\n(AU) and the United Nations. We must therefore \r\nalways give mediation a chance before resorting to the \r\nuse or threat of the use of force. The international \r\ncommunity must give priority to mediation in any \r\nconflict before it threatens military invasion or outright \r\nmilitary intervention without giving mediation a \r\nchance. It costs less to mediate — we all agree — than \r\nto launch a full-scale military intervention, only to \r\nhave to come back again and rebuild and reconstruct. \r\n Over the past decade, the leadership of West \r\nAfrica, in close collaboration with the international \r\ncommunity, has invested great material and human \r\nresources to bring the conflicts that affected that region \r\nto peaceful ends. Today, the region enjoys relative \r\npeace, but that does not mean that spoilers have given \r\nup attempts to derail the peace. We must be vigilant at \r\nall times. For example, the evils of drug trafficking, \r\npiracy, and the trafficking of illicit goods and arms \r\nhave reared their ugly heads across our subregion of \r\nWest Africa. The nature and extent of those crimes call \r\nfor swift international action to nip them in the bud \r\nbefore it is too late.  \r\n All these crimes feed on each other and sow the \r\nseeds of terror, economic sabotage and indeed the \r\ncollapse of social order. We must therefore pool our \r\nresources in the areas of detection, surveillance, law \r\nenforcement and prosecution in order to deny the \r\nculprits safe havens. In order to do that, we must come \r\ntogether and agree on a framework for cooperation, of \r\n A/66/PV.25\r\n \r\n15 11-51384 \r\n \r\ncourse with the support of the international community. \r\nWe look forward to greater United Nations engagement \r\nwith regional and subregional leaders and \r\norganizations in stamping out those menaces. \r\n The Gambia will always be an agent of peace \r\nthrough mediation and shuttle diplomacy in West \r\nAfrica and beyond. As we have done in the past, we \r\nwill support all efforts aimed at the peaceful resolution \r\nof conflicts and disputes within our subregion. We will \r\nalso continue to contribute to United Nations \r\npeacekeeping missions around the world, as we have \r\nalready done. \r\n With strong African leadership, we continue to \r\nwitness the amicable resolution of many civil conflicts \r\nthat plague the continent. The key lesson in most of \r\nthose situations is early intervention by leaders who \r\nmediate between stakeholders. Regional leaders should \r\nalways be put at the forefront of mediation efforts.  \r\n For that reason, we salute the untiring leadership \r\nof the African Union in bringing about peace in the \r\nSudan. We equally salute the leadership of the Sudan \r\nfor its magnanimity in implementing the \r\nComprehensive Peace Accord, which led to the \r\nindependence of South Sudan. My delegation \r\nencourages both sides to invest in their shared future \r\nthrough a negotiated settlement of the pending issues.  \r\n Let me also take this opportunity to encourage \r\nour brothers in Guinea and Niger, after successful \r\ndemocratic transitions, to bury the hatchet and move \r\nforward as united peoples. National reconciliation \r\nefforts should be diligently pursued by all stakeholders. \r\nWe therefore call on the international community to \r\nrender them all the support they need as they try to \r\nbring peace and development to their countries. \r\n As a developing country, like all others we have \r\nour eyes set on the countdown to 2015, a landmark \r\nyear for all of us. The Gambia and the entire \r\ninternational community have only a few more years \r\nbefore we can tell how many of the MDGs we have \r\nmet. What is evident from all the reviews, however, is \r\nthat we are surely on track to meet some of the MDGs \r\nbut still struggling to meet others. We know for certain, \r\nfor example, that the critical element for achieving all \r\nMDGs on the target date will remain international \r\ndonor support and collaboration. We have just \r\nembarked upon our new programme for accelerated \r\ngrowth and employment, which is our blueprint for \r\ndevelopment in the Gambia for 2012-2015, which we \r\nearnestly believe will be generously supported by all \r\nour development partners and friends. \r\n It is no secret that the ongoing financial and \r\neconomic crisis, worsened by market volatility, is \r\ntaking a huge toll on the meagre economic gains of our \r\nfragile economies. In view of our situation as least \r\ndeveloped countries and of the vulnerabilities that we \r\ncontinue to encounter, it is urgent that we all support \r\nthe implementation of the Istanbul Programme of \r\nAction. We must not allow it to suffer the fate of its \r\npredecessor, which suffered from weak \r\nimplementation.  \r\n It is our hope that our partners from the North \r\nwill do all in their power to support the enhancement \r\nof our productive capacities. We also call on the \r\nemerging economies of the South to enhance their \r\ncooperation with us in ways that will render true \r\nmeaning to South-South cooperation. My delegation is \r\nready at all times to forge meaningful partnerships \r\nacross the North and South in order to bring food \r\nsecurity to our people, tackle youth unemployment \r\nthrough education and skill development, and enhance \r\nthe quality and coverage of our health-care delivery \r\nsystems.  \r\n In addition, we have to revisit the various \r\nprogrammes and strategies adopted by the Food and \r\nAgricultural Organization of the United Nations and \r\nother global forums in order to comprehensively \r\naddress the food security needs of developing \r\ncountries. The small-scale farmer — including the \r\nfemale farmer — must be placed at the centre of the \r\nnew Green Revolution. \r\n The impact of climate change continues to pose a \r\nformidable challenge to all of us. The solutions to \r\nreversing the negative impacts of climate change \r\nthrough adaptation and mitigation initiatives are well \r\nknown. Our problem today is the refusal of the biggest \r\npolluters to assume their responsibilities in reversing \r\nthe negative trends of climate change occasioned by \r\nhuman activity. We cannot afford to be in denial for \r\nlong. The science is solid and there for all to see, and \r\nthe solutions are very clear, so let us embrace them by \r\nfulfilling our international obligations.  \r\n The 2012 United Nations Conference on \r\nSustainable Development (Rio+20) should be about the \r\nimplementation of commitments and not about \r\nreneging on them. It should also be about the \r\nannouncement of workable initiatives and not about the \r\nA/66/PV.25  \r\n \r\n11-51384 16 \r\n \r\nrepackaging of previous unfulfilled commitments. \r\nRio+20 should ultimately be about binding \r\ncommitments. Let us bequeath to our children, and \r\ntheir children an Earth that is resilient and a better \r\nworld for them. \r\n My delegation would like to congratulate the \r\ndelegation of Libya, especially the leadership of the \r\nNational Transitional Council, on being steadfast in \r\ntheir drive to rescue Libya from the brink of the abyss. \r\nWe have faith in that leadership and are convinced that \r\nit will institute the necessary reforms that the Libyan \r\npeople have so valiantly fought for. As Libya embarks \r\non the crucial task of reconciliation, reconstruction and \r\nnation building, we — as the first African country to \r\nhave officially announced its recognition of and \r\nsupport for the National Transitional Council — would \r\nlike to assure the Libyan leadership of our full \r\ncollaboration and solidarity at all times. \r\n The conflicts in the Middle East, both recent and \r\nlong-standing, require fresh and honest mediation \r\nefforts with a view to stabilizing the region once and \r\nfor all. The disorderly change that is sweeping across \r\nthe region is a cause for concern as livelihoods are \r\nshattered and industries like tourism are destroyed, \r\nthereby creating more unemployment and entrenching \r\nendemic poverty. With regard to the Arab Spring, my \r\ndelegation fully supports and hereby salutes the \r\nleadership role of the League of Arab States, the \r\nOrganization of Islamic Cooperation and the Gulf \r\nCooperation Council in finding peaceful resolution to \r\nthose conflicts through mediation, diplomacy and \r\nbrotherhood.  \r\n In the same vein, we salute the role the AU has \r\nbeen playing in bringing to an end some of the most \r\nviolent conflicts in human history on the African \r\ncontinent through mediation and in some cases through \r\nmilitary intervention as a last resort. We have used \r\nformer Heads of State as mediators in Africa and in \r\ncouncils of the wise, and some of those efforts have \r\nproven to be very successful. \r\n One of the most intractable conflicts of our time \r\nis the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The sad reality is that \r\nnumerous United Nations resolutions continue to be \r\nflouted. The daily killing, collective punishment and \r\nhumiliation of Palestinians are going on unabated. \r\nDenial of humanitarian assistance, essential medical \r\nsupplies and construction materials to Palestinians has \r\nbecome the norm. For that reason, my delegation not \r\nonly supports but recognizes an independent and \r\nsovereign Palestinian State within the confines of the \r\n1967 borders. An independent Palestinian State with \r\nfull rights and privileges like any other is long \r\noverdue. That is the only guarantor of lasting peace in \r\nthat region. \r\n The Islamic religion, which is synonymous with \r\npeace, is misunderstood and misrepresented in some \r\nquarters. We condemn those who turn themselves into \r\nsuicide bombers to kill innocent people or conduct \r\ninhuman behaviour in the name of Islam, as such acts \r\nare contrary to Islamic values and teachings. Muslims, \r\nChristians, Jews and peoples of other faiths must all \r\njoin hands, for once, in fighting terrorism of all shades. \r\nWe must also be tolerant and indeed respectful of each \r\nother, no matter our beliefs, and live side by side in \r\npeace and harmony as one human race and one human \r\nfamily. \r\n In the case of Syria, we call on the international \r\ncommunity to encourage and support the Syrian \r\nGovernment and people to resolve their internal \r\nproblems through diplomacy and peaceful means. \r\nPoverty should not be a pretext for violent and \r\ndisorderly change of Government in developing \r\ncountries. \r\n The need for constructive dialogue in finding \r\nlasting and timely solutions to transboundary problems, \r\nwherever they exist, is more urgent today than ever \r\nbefore. Let us avoid postponing the search for a \r\npermanent solution to the decades-old conflict in the \r\nNagorno Karabakh region. It is the responsibility of the \r\ninternational community to work with a greater sense \r\nof urgency to address the Nagorno Karabakh conflict \r\nwithout further delay. \r\n The developments in Cuba continue to \r\ndemonstrate to the world the inhumanity of \r\nmaintaining the decades-old embargo imposed on that \r\nfriendly country. The embargo is a manifestation of \r\nintolerance of other people’s right to a political system \r\nof their choice. There is universal agreement that the \r\nembargo needs to come to an end without precondition \r\nand be replaced with good-neighbourliness, tolerance \r\nand respect for the legitimate right of Cubans to have a \r\npolitical system of their choice. We therefore once \r\nagain call on the United States of America to lift the \r\nsanctions and embargo on Cuba now. \r\n The case of Taiwan deserves better scrutiny by \r\nthe international community. Taiwan, with a population \r\n A/66/PV.25\r\n \r\n17 11-51384 \r\n \r\nof 23 million people, continues to play an active and \r\npositive role on the international stage. In a highly \r\nintegrated and interconnected world, almost all issues \r\ndemand the full participation of and cooperation \r\namong all nations. Taiwan’s efforts in promoting peace, \r\nparticularly in the Asia-Pacific region, deserve \r\ncommendation and further encouragement by the \r\nGeneral Assembly.  \r\n For example, over the past three years, Taiwan \r\nhas engaged mainland China in dialogue on a wide \r\nrange of issues ranging from agriculture and health to \r\nintellectual property rights and economic and \r\ncommercial cooperation, among others. Furthermore, \r\nsince 2009 Taiwan has been invited by the World \r\nHealth Organization to attend the World Health \r\nAssembly (WHA) as an observer. That practice and the \r\nrelated arrangements have established what has been \r\ntermed the WHA model, which sets a useful precedent \r\nfor Taiwan’s greater participation in the United Nations \r\nsystem generally. \r\n Given that Taiwan is today one of the leading \r\ntechnological and economic powerhouses of the world, \r\nits participation in global affairs is quite relevant, \r\nbearing in mind the numerous issues that we \r\ncollectively confront. We must give it the prominence \r\nthat it deserves. Issues such as natural disasters, \r\nterrorism, climate change, epidemics, financial \r\nmeltdowns and many others require the engagement of \r\nevery member of the international community, \r\nincluding Taiwan. We therefore urge the United \r\nNations to find a suitable way to allow for Taiwan’s \r\nmeaningful participation in the specialized agencies \r\nand mechanisms of the United Nations system, \r\nincluding the International Civil Aviation Organization \r\nand the United Nations Climate Change Conferences \r\nimmediately. \r\n Reform should be a permanent feature on the \r\nagenda of all international organizations. Cosmetic \r\nreforms or the deliberate stalling of overdue reforms \r\nseriously undermine the effective responsiveness of \r\norganizations. In 2005, as we all remember, a draft of \r\nreform measures was introduced by the General \r\nAssembly, which led to reforms in management of the \r\nSecretariat, human resources administration, the \r\ncreation of the Human Rights Council, the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission and the elaboration of new \r\nnorms. \r\n The then Secretary-General remarked that no \r\nreform of the United Nations is complete without \r\nreform of the Security Council. Let us not delude \r\nourselves. The Security Council urgently needs \r\ncomprehensive reforms. A major element in the reform \r\nof the Council is the glaring underrepresentation of \r\nAfrica, for example, in all its categories of \r\nmembership. Africa certainly needs to be adequately \r\nand properly represented, and we will not give up on \r\nwhat is a legitimate demand. What is even more \r\nappalling is that negotiations are progressing at a \r\nsnail’s pace. Although we are mindful of other \r\npositions, we are convinced that negotiations must lead \r\nto a just outcome. Security Council reform is long \r\noverdue, and the lack of it is undermining the \r\ncredibility of our Organization and the legitimacy of \r\nthe Council’s decisions. \r\n In conclusion, my delegation would like to repeat \r\nwhat we said before. Reform of the United Nations \r\nmust recognize the geopolitical realities of the African \r\ncontinent and its peoples. Africa is no longer the \r\ncolony of any country and must be respected and \r\ntreated as such. The system of veto power and flawed \r\nrepresentation in the Security Council is not \r\nacceptable, can no longer be tolerated and in fact runs \r\ncounter to the spirit and letter of the basic principles of \r\nequality and fair play as enshrined in the United \r\nNations Charter. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nVice-President of the Republic of the Gambia for the \r\nstatement she has just made. \r\n Ms. Aja Isatou Njie-Saidy, Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of the Gambia, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Edward Kiwanuka Ssekandi, \r\nVice-President of the Republic of Uganda \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Vice-\r\nPresident of the Republic of Uganda. \r\n  Mr. Edward Kiwanuka Ssekandi, Vice-President \r\nof the Republic of Uganda, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum. \r\n  The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nA/66/PV.25  \r\n \r\n11-51384 18 \r\n \r\nMr. Edward Kiwanuka Ssekandi, Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of Uganda, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly.  \r\n Mr. Ssekandi (Uganda): Uganda joins other \r\ndelegations in congratulating Mr. Al-Nasser on his \r\nelection to the presidency of this body. My delegation \r\nhas confidence in his ability to steer our deliberations \r\nto a successful conclusion. I wish to pay tribute to \r\nMr. Joseph Deiss for his effective stewardship of the \r\nwork of the General Assembly during the past session. \r\n Uganda takes this opportunity to congratulate the \r\nGovernment and the people of South Sudan on \r\nattaining statehood and becoming the 193rd Member of \r\nthe United Nations. Uganda also congratulates Mr. Ban \r\nKi-moon on his reappointment as Secretary-General. \r\n The theme of this session’s general debate, “The \r\nrole of mediation in the settlement of disputes by \r\npeaceful means”, is most appropriate in the light of the \r\nconflict situations in various parts of the world, \r\nincluding Africa. When actualized, the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes saves lives and property that \r\nwould otherwise be lost if force were used. Strategic \r\ninterventions, such as mediation, are necessary to \r\nmitigate conflict situations and avert crises that \r\nthreaten the stability not only of nations, but also of \r\nentire regions, with adverse effects on development \r\nand people’s livelihoods. Mediation is a necessary and \r\nessential tool for the peaceful resolution of conflicts, as \r\nit is aims to support disputing parties in the process of \r\nnegotiating a mutual understanding or agreement. \r\n Uganda has consistently advocated an enhanced \r\nrole for subregional and regional organizations in \r\nconflict prevention and resolution. When those \r\norganizations are involved in mediating disputes, they \r\nplay a critical role in bringing about sustainable peace \r\nand security. It was against this background that \r\nUganda supported and sponsored resolution 65/283 on \r\nmediation as a tool for the peaceful settlement of \r\ndisputes. The resolution provides a basis for \r\nconsolidating normative mediation efforts, reinforcing \r\nmediation support activities and enhancing the role of \r\nMember States. \r\n Uganda has been involved in various initiatives to \r\nbring peace to the Great Lakes region, the Horn of \r\nAfrica and the African continent as a whole. Our \r\ninvolvement included participation in the Burundi \r\npeace process and in the negotiations, led by the \r\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development, on the \r\nSudan Comprehensive Peace Agreement, which \r\nculminated in the birth of a new nation, South Sudan, \r\nwhich is now participating as an equal partner in the \r\ncommunity of nations. \r\n In the case of Somalia, in addition to our \r\ncontribution to the African Union Mission in Somalia \r\n(AMISOM), Uganda continues to support the \r\nengagement of the Somali Transitional Federal \r\nGovernment with other actors so as to promote \r\ndialogue in the context of the Djibouti Agreement and \r\nthe Kampala Accord. In order to consolidate the gains \r\nrealized on the ground, the United Nations and the rest \r\nof the international community must urgently \r\nstrengthen support to Somalia by means of capacity-\r\nbuilding for the Somali Transitional Federal \r\nInstitutions; the deployment of the additional \r\nauthorized 3,000 troops; the approval of a reliable and \r\npredictable funding mechanism and of the required \r\naviation assets to AMISOM; and the provision of \r\nurgent humanitarian relief and assistance to meet the \r\nbasic needs of the people through quick-impact \r\nprojects in such areas as health care, water and \r\nsanitation. \r\n Our experience in conflict prevention and \r\nresolution in Africa is that if such efforts are to succeed \r\nand be sustainable, a number of factors come into play. \r\nFirst, peace initiatives should be led by the region, with \r\nstrong support from regional organizations, the United \r\nNations and other relevant actors. Secondly, it is \r\nsometimes important to initially give priority to peace \r\nbefore justice in order to strengthen confidence-\r\nbuilding between parties. Thirdly, peace and \r\nreconciliation mechanisms, including transitional all-\r\ninclusive administrations, need to be established to \r\nheal the wounds of conflict. Fourthly, post-conflict \r\nrecovery and reconstruction programmes or projects \r\nshould be instituted simultaneously so as to \r\ndemonstrate the benefits of peace dividends. \r\n Mediation is a worthwhile investment. It costs \r\nmuch less than other undertakings, such as \r\npeacekeeping or peace enforcement. In terms of \r\nbenefits, effective mediation can avert unnecessary \r\nwars and their attendant consequences, such as the loss \r\nof life and property, and contribute to building capacity \r\nfor home-grown solutions to address conflict. The \r\nmutual confidence that normally results from \r\nmediation between parties can also be instrumental in \r\nachieving inclusive political and other arrangements \r\nfollowing the conclusion of peace agreements. Once \r\n A/66/PV.25\r\n \r\n19 11-51384 \r\n \r\nachieved, such arrangements have a positive impact on \r\nthe consolidation of peace and security, as well as on \r\nsustainable post-conflict reconstruction, recovery and \r\ndevelopment. \r\n Uganda believes that potential differences \r\nbetween and within countries are better addressed \r\nusing home-grown solutions. External influences or \r\ninterventions do not necessarily offer sustainable \r\nsolutions to conflict. On the contrary, the latter tend at \r\ntimes to contribute to a cycle of destabilizing \r\ntendencies. \r\n It is therefore important that the involvement of \r\nthe United Nations, the international community and \r\nother actors take full account of the interests and \r\nconcerns of all parties. Hence, there is a need for close \r\ncoordination, consultation and information-sharing \r\nwith the parties concerned. The support of the \r\ninternational community should target areas mutually \r\nagreed upon with the parties concerned. It is also \r\nimportant to underscore the fact that, where potential \r\nconflict situations arise and external support becomes \r\nnecessary, the international community should provide \r\na timely, adequate and robust response. \r\n It is equally necessary to build and strengthen the \r\nmediation capacities of subregional and regional \r\norganizations. Specifically, in the case of conflicts in \r\nAfrica, our preferred solution is peaceful settlement \r\nthrough mediation, not military intervention. In the \r\ncase of the Libyan crisis, the African Union (AU) has \r\ncalled upon the National Transitional Council to \r\nestablish an all-inclusive transitional Government, as \r\nproposed in the AU road map for the peaceful \r\nresolution of the Libyan conflict. \r\n Uganda would like to make a strong case to this \r\nAssembly that Africa should be given the chance to \r\nresolve its conflicts. Africa has strong political will to \r\nhandle them, and any interventions should be aimed at \r\nsupporting African initiatives to find peaceful \r\nsolutions. It is therefore imperative that our partners \r\nrecognize the existing dispute resolution mechanisms \r\nof the regional bodies in Africa. I also call upon the \r\nUnited Nations to fully support Africa in that regard. \r\n Besides, the role of women in mediation must be \r\nappreciated and enhanced. Experience has shown that \r\nwomen can contribute a lot to efforts aimed at peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes and at conflict prevention and \r\nresolution. It is therefore vital that women become \r\nincreasingly involved in mediation efforts and \r\nprocesses. \r\n On the Israeli-Palestinian question, Uganda has \r\nconsistently called upon the Israeli and the Palestinian \r\nparties to muster the necessary courage to negotiate \r\nand reach a peaceful settlement based on a two-State \r\nsolution, that is, Israel and the State of Palestine living \r\nside by side peacefully and within secure borders. We \r\nurge both parties to urgently resume negotiations in \r\norder to reach a two-State solution that will guarantee \r\ndurable peace. \r\n The outcome of this debate should include \r\npractical and pragmatic actions to address some of the \r\nchallenges relating to mediation. These include, but are \r\nnot limited to, issues involved in the adequacy and \r\npredictability of the requisite resources, capacity-\r\nbuilding at the national, subregional and regional \r\nlevels, the involvement of women, and the \r\nstrengthening of coordination and collaboration in \r\nmediation efforts and processes. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nVice-President of the Republic of Uganda for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Edward Kiwanuka Ssekandi, Vice-President \r\nof the Republic of Uganda, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by His Royal Highness Prince Haji \r\nAl-Muhtadee Billah, Crown Prince of \r\nBrunei Darussalam  \r\n  \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Crown \r\nPrince of Brunei Darussalam.  \r\n His Royal Highness Prince Haji Al-Muhtadee \r\nBillah, Crown Prince of Brunei Darussalam, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum.  \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Royal Highness \r\nPrince Haji Al-Muhtadee Billah, Crown Prince of \r\nBrunei Darussalam, and inviting him to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly.  \r\n  Prince Haji Al-Muhtadee Billah (Brunei \r\nDarussalam): On behalf of His Majesty and the people \r\nof Brunei Darussalam, I would like to congratulate our \r\nnew President, His Excellency Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz \r\nA/66/PV.25  \r\n \r\n11-51384 20 \r\n \r\nAl-Nasser. These are not only personal congratulations. \r\nWe also congratulate his country, Qatar, our fellow \r\nMember of the United Nations. We greatly appreciate \r\nits significant efforts to promote dialogue, consultation \r\nand mediation in many difficult situations, both in its \r\nown region and far beyond. Thus we thank the \r\nPresident, as its representative, and warmly welcome \r\nhim to the General Assembly as the representative of \r\nus all.  \r\n We would also like to express our appreciation to \r\nhis predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss. His \r\nterm of office saw another impressive contribution by \r\nthe United Nations to meeting the great international \r\nchallenges Members face in the first decade of this new \r\ncentury.  \r\n Some of that work began right here, in this \r\nbuilding, with our efforts to reform the Security \r\nCouncil and revitalize the General Assembly. Other \r\nefforts addressed our world at large and the \r\nconfrontation between essential economic growth and \r\ncritical environmental realities that it faces. Still others \r\nwere aimed directly at the people we represent. Those \r\nefforts addressed their health and food security; \r\nconsidered their personal and legal status, whether at \r\nhome or as members of immigrant communities; and \r\nexamined the systems of governance under which they \r\nlive. \r\n This is a fine record, and we thank the outgoing \r\nPresident for his leadership. He was greatly assisted in \r\nhis work by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. We offer \r\nthe Secretary-General our very best wishes for the \r\ncoming year. We welcome his reappointment and join \r\nfellow Members in thanking his staff and the United \r\nNations volunteer workers, peacekeepers and agencies \r\nfor all of their efforts in many extremely difficult \r\nsituations.  \r\n It is a tribute to their work that one of the \r\nlongest-running and most complex situations of all has \r\nbeen resolved this year. As a result, we add our own \r\nwords of welcome to the Government and the people of \r\nSouth Sudan as a new Member of the United Nations. \r\nWe also commend all parties involved in the process of \r\ndialogue, negotiation and final resolution. At the same \r\ntime, it is our deepest wish that these same sentiments \r\nmay soon be expressed to the parties directly involved \r\nin efforts to reach a fair and equitable two-State \r\nsolution to the situation in Palestine. \r\n The President of the Assembly has asked us to \r\nconsider the role of mediation in the settlement of \r\ndisputes by peaceful means. In doing so, we follow the \r\ndirection given by His Majesty the Sultan in his \r\naddress to the General Assembly in 1984, when we had \r\nthe honour of becoming a Member of this great \r\nOrganization. In outline, it committed us to mutual \r\nrespect for territorial integrity and the principles of \r\ndialogue and negotiation in disputes, no matter how \r\nlong or how frustrating the process may be.  \r\n We still adhere to that principle. We give \r\nwhatever practical assistance we can, whenever asked. \r\nWe do so directly, through peacekeeping and \r\nmonitoring efforts, and indirectly, through financial \r\ncontributions made bilaterally and to relevant United \r\nNations and regional bodies. In these ways, we seek to \r\nfollow the commitments made in our first General \r\nAssembly debate.  \r\n Nevertheless, we increasingly recognize that \r\nthose commitments were made over a quarter of a \r\ncentury ago. Twenty-five years is a common definition \r\nof a generation in human terms, which means that a \r\nnew generation is now moving into positions of \r\nauthority. Behind it, a further generation is now \r\ncoming of age. It has no personal memory of the global \r\nsituation that shaped international policy in the Cold \r\nWar era. Although both generations are naturally still \r\ninfluenced by those times and the leaders who brought \r\nthem to this point, they are also new generations, for \r\nwhom the new century shapes world affairs. \r\n In our statement to the General Assembly three \r\nyears ago (see A/63/PV.10), we outlined our approach \r\nto this by broadly setting out what are now regarded as \r\nthe challenges of this new century. Some involve \r\nsecurity in all of its forms — political, physical and \r\neconomic. Others address the natural environment and \r\nthe effects of climate change. Still others raise \r\nquestions about sustainable development and many \r\nchallenges arise from the concept of good governance, \r\nboth nationally and in world organizations such as the \r\nWorld Trade Organization, the International Monetary \r\nFund, the Group of Twenty and even the United \r\nNations itself. We have given our full support to the \r\ngreat institutions of which we are members and will \r\ncontinue to do so. \r\n But our Government has emphasized one thing \r\nthroughout this year in all international gatherings we \r\nhave been privileged to attend. It is not a change in our \r\n A/66/PV.25\r\n \r\n21 11-51384 \r\n \r\noverall approach; it represents a particular focus. It \r\nmeans that more and more we are trying to identify the \r\nchallenges in basic human terms, because we feel that \r\nsuch a focus relates directly to the wise theme the \r\nPresident proposed for this debate.  \r\n We acknowledge with deep respect that \r\nsuccessful mediation has always been a cherished \r\nobjective of the United Nations, and we strongly \r\nsupport that ideal. At the same time, however, we \r\nmaintain that no mediation can be successful unless the \r\nparties involved share common ground. \r\n What concerns us is that the dynamics of the \r\ntwenty-first century have the potential to exclude many \r\nfrom this common ground. It will become the exclusive \r\nterritory of great unseen globalized forces, whether in \r\nthe market, the workplace or in the world of great \r\ndecision-making forums. That development could be so \r\ndivisive as to destroy any common ground.  \r\n We believe such common ground will only be \r\ncreated by ordinary people, as individuals and in their \r\nfamilies and communities, who feel that they are \r\nindeed occupying that common ground. For them, \r\npolitical security lies in the principles of diplomacy \r\namong all nations, especially respect for each other’s \r\ntraditions, values, beliefs and ways of life. Physical \r\nsecurity means the rule of law. Economic security is \r\nfood on the table, a job and the best possible support \r\nfor health, education and old age.  \r\n In all these efforts, we have felt well guided by \r\nthe United Nations, above all through the \r\nencouragement it provides towards achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals and the confidence in \r\nthe future that they give to all people. That, we believe, \r\nwill lead us towards the common ground we are trying \r\nto discover. It will be reached when it is shared among \r\nthe most powerful of industrialized nations and the \r\nsmallest of threatened island communities. The search \r\nfor common ground is the immense task of both \r\npresent and future generations. We believe that only \r\nwhen it is concluded can mediation successfully \r\nperform the role suggested in the President’s theme.  \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nCrown Prince of Brunei Darussalam for the statement \r\nhe has just made. \r\n His Royal Highness Prince Haji Al-Muhtadee \r\nBillah, Crown Prince of Brunei Darussalam, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Hor Namhong, Deputy \r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs and \r\nInternational Cooperation of the Kingdom of \r\nCambodia. \r\n Mr. Hor (Cambodia): At the outset, I would like \r\nto join previous speakers in expressing my sincere \r\ncongratulations to His Excellency Mr. Nassir \r\nAbdulaziz Al-Nasser on his election as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. We are \r\nconfident that under his able leadership, our \r\ndeliberations will be guided towards a successful \r\nconclusion. \r\n I would like also to take this opportunity to \r\nwarmly congratulate His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon \r\non being unanimously chosen by the General Assembly \r\nto serve a second term as Secretary-General. The Royal \r\nGovernment of Cambodia acknowledges with great \r\nadmiration his outstanding leadership and untiring \r\nefforts to overcome the many current global \r\nchallenges. \r\n Cambodia warmly welcomes the Republic of \r\nSouth Sudan as a new Member of the United Nations. \r\nWe will continue to dispatch more peacekeepers under \r\nwith United Nations peacekeeping operations to help \r\nwith humanitarian activities and demining in that \r\nfriendly new State. \r\n We live in an interconnected world where global \r\nchallenges such as economic and financial crises, \r\nclimate change, energy and food security, terrorism and \r\nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, \r\namong others, have become increasingly complex and \r\ncontinue to haunt the entire world. \r\n The global economy remains somewhat fragile, \r\nand there are many risks and challenges to a durable \r\nexit from the crisis. The growth of the world economy \r\nhas decelerated in 2011, and the global economy now \r\nfaces three major challenges: sovereign debt, slow \r\ngrowth and social instability.  \r\n The problem of unemployment has been very \r\nsevere in the advanced economies, and inflation is \r\nemerging in the developing economies. That has \r\ncreated havoc in many parts of the world, as continued \r\ninstability in the financial sector, especially in the \r\nA/66/PV.25  \r\n \r\n11-51384 22 \r\n \r\nUnited States and the euro zone, has dampened global \r\ntrade. That has an effect on exports, in particular of \r\ndeveloping countries. Therefore, a wide range of policy \r\nresponses and long-overdue reforms must be \r\nimplemented to accelerate growth and bring the global \r\neconomy out of the crisis. \r\n The crisis has reaffirmed the importance of \r\nreform in global economic and financial governance, \r\nincluding strengthening the institutional role of the \r\nInternational Monetary Fund.  \r\n Asia has become an essential partner in the global \r\neconomy and has taken the lead in advancing global \r\nrecovery. For instance, Cambodia’s economy is \r\ngrowing, after a decline in 2008 and 2009, with an \r\nexpected growth rate of 8.7 per cent this year. With \r\nstrong, robust economies, East Asia and the \r\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations are well \r\npositioned to assume their responsibilities to contribute \r\nto addressing the global economic and financial crisis. \r\n Although some significant successes have been \r\nachieved in attaining the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs), most developing countries, in \r\nparticular least developed countries (LDCs), will \r\ncontinue to face many huge hurdles on their path to \r\nreach the MDG targets. \r\n Continued economic and financial instability in \r\nthe developed world has exacerbated uncertainty in \r\nfunding for development projects in poor countries. \r\nPersistently high fuel oil prices are straining every \r\neconomic aspect of developing countries. The \r\nworsening food security situation is holding back \r\nprogress in reducing malnutrition and child mortality. \r\nThe burden of debt repayment constitutes another \r\nmajor challenge for the LDCs in meeting the MDG \r\ntargets.  \r\n Faced with these tremendous challenges, poverty \r\nreduction remains the highest and foremost global \r\npriority. It requires steady economic growth and a more \r\npro-poor policy. \r\n In the context of the global effort to meet the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, Cambodia has been \r\nlisted among the 20 countries making the most absolute \r\nprogress on the MDGs. Last year it was accorded the \r\n2010 MDG Award by the MDG Awards Committee in \r\nNew York for its outstanding progress towards \r\nachievement of Goal 6. \r\n There is no doubt that climate change, with its \r\ndevastating impact worldwide, has become a constant \r\nthreat to our existence. Drought and flooding have \r\nbecome more frequent and more severe in many parts \r\nof the world, affecting millions of people. The current \r\nhorrific drought in the Horn of Africa represents \r\nanother most painful tragedy caused by global \r\nwarming. The threat of climate change is a reality and \r\na huge challenge for the global community. \r\n It is regrettable that many of the promises made \r\nduring the Copenhagen and Cancún meetings of the \r\nUnited Nations Climate Change Conference to assist \r\ndeveloping countries cope with climate change remain \r\nto be delivered in a timely manner. Now, while the \r\nworld is facing further financial turmoil, let us not \r\nforget that actions on climate change cannot wait. \r\nClimate change is progressing every day, triggering \r\nmore frequent natural disasters. The developing \r\ncountries are hoping for timely support for their efforts \r\nto address, adapt to and mitigate the effects of climate \r\nchange and to develop clean energy. They call on the \r\ndeveloped world to honour their commitments under \r\nthe Copenhagen and Cancún conferences. \r\n The seventeenth Conference of the Parties to the \r\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange in Durban, South Africa, in November must \r\nnot become another delusion but a place to demonstrate \r\nour collective will to share the responsibility and to \r\nachieve a real breakthrough in facing climate change. \r\nWhile obstacles remain to achieving a binding accord, \r\nCambodia hopes that the Kyoto Protocol, which is due \r\nto expire next year, will be extended during the Durban \r\nconference. \r\n Cambodia, for its part, successfully launched its \r\nown initiative, which is called Cambodia Climate \r\nChange Alliance, in 2009, with the objective of \r\nstrengthening our national institutions to deal with \r\nclimate change risks. Cambodia is also implementing \r\nnumerous projects within the framework of the United \r\nNations Collaborative Programme on Reducing \r\nEmissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation \r\nin Developing Countries while actively promoting \r\nadaptation and mitigation measures through our project \r\nto promote climate-resilient water management and \r\nagricultural practices in rural Cambodia. \r\n Food and energy security remain major issues of \r\nglobal concern. Although the recent surge in energy \r\ncosts has subsided, the price of fuel oil remains \r\n A/66/PV.25\r\n \r\n23 11-51384 \r\n \r\nextremely volatile. High fuel oil prices are a major \r\nburden on poor countries, which lack financial \r\nresources and know-how to develop alternative and \r\nclean energy sources. As the world depends heavily on \r\nfuel oil, we should act in concert to prevent unruly \r\nspeculation and price instability, which have \r\ndevastating effects on developing countries’ efforts to \r\nreduce poverty and meet the MDG targets. It may be \r\ntime to consider establishing a world body comprised \r\nof major fuel oil producers and consumers to ensure a \r\nreasonable price limit. The world should not be at the \r\nmercy of oil producers. \r\n A more holistic approach for addressing energy \r\nsecurity is the transfer of relevant knowledge and \r\ntechnology to assist developing countries in exploiting \r\nalternative sources of energy. Reduced reliance on \r\nfossil fuel will also contribute significantly to slowing \r\nthe pace of global warming and climate change while \r\nreducing emissions of the harmful greenhouse gases \r\nproduced by burning fuel oil. \r\n On the other hand, energy security is closely \r\nlinked to food security. Soaring fuel oil prices in recent \r\nyears have not only caused food prices to rise but have \r\nalso reduced land devoted to agriculture through the \r\nchange to production of bioenergy as an alternative to \r\nfuel oil. A balanced approach must be taken to address \r\nthat twin problem. Food insecurity is also caused and \r\naggravated by the global financial and economic \r\nmeltdown and increasing world population. \r\n The number of undernourished people in the \r\nworld remains unacceptably high. Global population \r\ngrowth will inevitably lead to increased demand for \r\nboth energy and food.  \r\n For its part, Cambodia is doing its best to \r\ncontribute to world food security by intensifying rice \r\nproduction as the top priority of Government policy. \r\nMore and more rice will be available for export. \r\nCambodia is also seeking to establish an association of \r\nrice exporters under the framework of the Ayeyawady-\r\nChao Phraya-Mekong Economic Cooperation Strategy, \r\ncomprised of five rice-exporting countries in South-\r\nEast Asia: Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and \r\nViet Nam. The association will contribute to stabilizing \r\nthe food market and preventing speculation in food \r\nprices. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n With respect to global peace and security, one of \r\ntoday’s gravest threats to humanity is terrorism. \r\nDespite the enormous efforts made by the international \r\ncommunity to prevent and combat acts of terrorism, \r\nsuch acts continue to occur daily almost everywhere in \r\nthe world. No country has been spared by terrorism. Its \r\nnetworks comprise a vast and complex web of \r\ninterlinked criminal activities, including money-\r\nlaundering, weapons trafficking and organized crime.  \r\n It is therefore time for us to consider whether the \r\nantiterrorism measures adopted to date have been \r\nsufficient. Cambodia fully supports United Nations \r\nefforts to create a global coalition against terrorism. In \r\nthat context, Cambodia believes that there is an urgent \r\nneed to finalize the draft United Nations global \r\ncounter-terrorism convention, which has been \r\ndiscussed for many years within the Organization. The \r\nadoption of that convention would strengthen and \r\nbroaden the legal frameworks to combat those crimes \r\nagainst humanity. \r\n On weapons of mass destruction, the international \r\ncommunity has made notable progress in recent years \r\nin the area of arms control and disarmament. Cambodia \r\nwelcomes the new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty \r\nsigned last year by the United States and Russia, which \r\nhas made an important contribution towards \r\neliminating weapons of mass destruction. However, \r\nexisting nuclear weapon stockpiles remain a serious \r\nthreat to humanity. Cambodia requests States that have \r\nnot yet signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban \r\nTreaty and the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons to do so as soon as possible, for we \r\nall share the responsibility to guarantee a more secure \r\nworld for all. \r\n In that context, Cambodia has participated for \r\nseveral years in demining operations in South Sudan, \r\nLebanon and in other United Nations peacekeeping \r\nmissions, including Chad and the Central African \r\nRepublic.  \r\n The Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains one of the \r\nmost protracted and volatile conflicts in the Middle \r\nEast. Cambodia calls on the two parties to manifest \r\npolitical will to overcome their mutual animosity in \r\norder create an atmosphere conducive to the \r\nresumption of peace negotiations in the interests of \r\nboth Palestinians and Israelis. \r\nA/66/PV.25  \r\n \r\n11-51384 24 \r\n \r\n Cambodia has always supported the creation of \r\nthe Palestinian State based upon its 1967 borders. In \r\nthat spirit, Cambodia supports the rights of Palestine to \r\nbecome a full Member of the United Nations at this \r\nsession of the General Assembly. Moreover, it must be \r\nacknowledged that neither Palestinians nor Israelis \r\ncould live anywhere else. It would therefore be far \r\nbetter if both peoples could live side by side in peace \r\nand as good neighbours. Cambodia sees no other \r\nsolution to that issue. \r\n The embargo against Cuba has lasted for too \r\nlong. Today it is an anachronism, a terrible injustice \r\nagainst the Cuban people, who have been the first to \r\nsuffer. That is why Cambodia is today renewing its call \r\nfor lifting this embargo, which has brought the Cuban \r\npeople nothing but suffering. It is time to end the \r\nsanctions and put an end to the long trial they have \r\nundergone. \r\n Given the changes in the world of today and the \r\nmultiple challenges they bring, the main bodies of the \r\nUnited Nations should be reformed in order to deal \r\nwith the problems we currently confront. Cambodia \r\nbelieves that such reform must be comprehensive. If \r\nwe cannot arrive at a consensus on Security Council \r\nreform today, perhaps we should move forward with \r\nreform of the General Assembly, so as to give it more \r\npower and thus enable it to play a more meaningful \r\nrole in tackling the great challenges of our time, as the \r\nmost representative and democratic body of the United \r\nNations. In regard to the Security Council, reforms \r\nshould ensure that it reflects the realities of today’s \r\nworld through equitable distribution of representation \r\namong permanent and non-permanent members. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Eamon Gilmore, Deputy \r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs and \r\nTrade of Ireland. \r\n Mr. Gilmore (Ireland): We are living in times of \r\nbreathtaking change. Much of it is good change: \r\nscientific and technological progress making real \r\nadvances for humankind, an ever more interconnected \r\nworld strengthening economic opportunity and \r\ndevelopmental potential, the profound transformations \r\nthat are sweeping through North Africa at present. \r\n But there is also much that is disturbing: violent \r\nconflict in many parts of the world, growing \r\nenvironmental damage to our planet, the ravages of a \r\nglobal financial and economic crisis, the continuing \r\nscourges of poverty, inequality, human rights abuses, \r\nterrorism and extremism and a range of other threats to \r\nglobal peace and security.  \r\n To respond to these multiple and interrelated \r\nchallenges, we have one constant anchor: the United \r\nNations. No other organization is as well equipped to \r\ndevelop common answers to the big questions of our \r\ntime. No other organization has the same global impact \r\nand legitimacy. With our increasing need for global \r\nsolutions, the United Nations, which represents almost \r\nall the countries on earth, has the political, moral and \r\nlegal authority to act. While there may be no easy \r\nanswers to the questions being posed, our best chance \r\nof finding effective responses lies in the collective \r\ndeliberation and action provided for by this \r\nOrganization. \r\n Ireland is deeply committed to the United \r\nNations. We look to it to uphold and defend the \r\nuniversal values of peace, security, human rights and \r\ndevelopment that are set out in the United Nations \r\nCharter. The Charter tells us that all human beings are \r\nborn free and equal in dignity and rights. The United \r\nNations is the embodiment of freedom and equality. It \r\nis a bulwark defending these core human values in a \r\nchanging and uncertain world.  \r\n Freedom and equality: these are the values that \r\nunderpin Ireland’s response to key global and regional \r\nchallenges. It is our deep commitment to freedom and \r\nequality that places Ireland in the vanguard of \r\ninternational efforts to resolve conflict, to create and \r\nmaintain peace, to eradicate hunger and \r\nunderdevelopment, and to put an end to human rights \r\nabuses around the world. \r\n The values of freedom and equality and the \r\nessential ideals of the Charter are not just words \r\nwritten on a page. Since we assembled here 12 months \r\nago, we have seen them expressed in North Africa and \r\nthe Middle East in a million acts of courage and \r\nliberation. We have watched the people of the Arab \r\nSpring, who have asserted their rights and stood up to \r\noppression and corruption. Tahrir — freedom — has \r\nnow passed into all our vocabularies as a byword for \r\nall those no longer prepared to see their basic human \r\nrights suppressed.  \r\n The events of the past nine months in North \r\nAfrica and the Middle East are historic in their sweep \r\nand profound in their implications. These have been \r\ngenuinely popular movements demanding reform, \r\n A/66/PV.25\r\n \r\n25 11-51384 \r\n \r\nfreedom and equality. The leadership role exercised \r\nwithin them by women has been striking and \r\ninspirational. \r\n The people of the Arab Spring have stood up and \r\nstood together to assert their basic rights and freedoms: \r\nthe right to choose their own leaders, the right not to \r\nlive in fear of the knock on the door, the right to live \r\nfreely and openly, the right to provide a decent life and \r\na hopeful future for themselves and their families. \r\nThey remind us that the human thirst for basic \r\nfreedoms is unquenchable, and they should inspire us \r\nin the work we do here. In rising up to grasp their own \r\ndestiny, the peoples of Tunisia, Egypt and Libya are \r\ntracing the path of those others, once in the shadow of \r\nthe Iron Curtain, who, in demanding those ordinary \r\nfreedoms, created extraordinary history. \r\n The United Nations has, of course, played an \r\nindispensable role in supporting these developments. \r\nStarting with the key Security Council resolutions 1970 \r\n(2011) and 1973 (2011), it has led international efforts \r\nto support the Libyan people. I would like to extend a \r\nwarm welcome to the representatives of the National \r\nTransitional Council who took up Libya’s seat at the \r\nUnited Nations this week, and I pledge Ireland’s full \r\nsupport as they seek to rebuild Libya and to fulfil the \r\ndemocratic aspirations of the Libyan people.  \r\n We cannot know the final outcome of the events \r\nwe are witnessing. We must ensure that the democratic \r\nchanges under way are consolidated and that the \r\npromise of profound improvements in human rights in \r\nthe countries concerned, in particular in relation to the \r\nrole of women, is fully realized. \r\n However, the situation in Syria continues to \r\narouse the deepest international concern. President \r\nAl-Assad and his Government seem oblivious to the \r\ndemands of the Syrian people for change and to the \r\nlessons of the Arab Spring elsewhere. They appear \r\ndetermined to respond with further oppression and \r\nviolence. Our basic message to the Syrian leader is \r\nthis: no leader who refuses to listen to what his people \r\nare saying and to act on their clearly expressed desire \r\nfor peace and reform can expect to remain in power. \r\n In the Middle East peace process, the search for \r\nfreedom and equality has yet to bear fruit. The Arab-\r\nIsraeli conflict remains depressingly deadlocked. \r\nUnless this deadlock is broken, the opportunities for \r\nyet another generation of children will be destroyed.  \r\n The situation in the Middle East is urgent. After \r\n20 years of failed initiatives, disillusionment about the \r\nability of the political process to deliver a settlement is \r\ndeepening. Young Palestinians in particular are \r\nfrustrated and despairing. The position of the moderate \r\nPalestinian leadership is under threat. Never has it been \r\nmore important to show that politics works and that a \r\npeaceful, just and lasting settlement is within reach \r\nthrough negotiation. \r\n Everybody knows what a final and \r\ncomprehensive settlement would involve: two States, \r\nbased on the 1967 borders with mutually agreed land \r\nswaps, living side by side in peace and security. It is \r\nmore pressing than ever to launch direct negotiations \r\nthat would address all the core issues and culminate in \r\nsuch an agreement within a specified time frame.  \r\n Ireland has long been an advocate of the \r\nestablishment of a sovereign, independent Palestinian \r\nState within borders based on those of 1967. We want \r\nto see the peoples of Palestine and Israel living as good \r\nneighbours in peace, security and prosperity as soon as \r\npossible — and this can come about only through \r\nnegotiation. Ireland strongly opposes all action that \r\nserves to hinder or delay negotiations, such as violent \r\nattacks on civilians and their property or Israel’s illegal \r\nsettlement of occupied Palestinian territory.  \r\n The decision of President Abbas to seek \r\nmembership in the United Nations for Palestine is \r\nentirely legitimate and understandable. Palestine has \r\nthe same right to membership in the United Nations as \r\nIreland or any other Member of this Organization. \r\nSome would seek to argue that Palestine cannot be \r\nrecognized as a State because its borders remain to be \r\nagreed on. But if the borders of Palestine are still a \r\nmatter for negotiation, then so, by definition, are those \r\nof Israel, which is rightly a full Member of the United \r\nNations. \r\n Membership in the United Nations of itself, \r\nhowever, would not change the unstable and \r\nunacceptable situation on the ground. It does not \r\nremove the compelling need for negotiations. Nor will \r\nit offer a legitimate excuse to avoid negotiations. \r\nWhatever happens here at the United Nations, \r\nnegotiations must resume as soon as possible. The \r\nstatement issued last Friday by the Quartet provides a \r\nframework for precisely that. \r\n What recognition of Palestinian statehood would \r\ndo, however, is to give dignity and support to the \r\nA/66/PV.25  \r\n \r\n11-51384 26 \r\n \r\nPalestinian people, who have suffered for too long. It \r\nwould also be a tangible demonstration of the \r\ncommitment of the international community and the \r\nUnited Nations to an agreed settlement between two \r\nsovereign States, living side by side in peace, security \r\nand prosperity. \r\n The day will come, not too far off, when the \r\nGeneral Assembly will be asked to vote on a proposal \r\nto admit Palestine as a Member of the Organization, or \r\nperhaps, as an interim step towards the achievement of \r\nthat goal, to accord Palestine non-member observer \r\nState status. Provided that the resolution is drafted in \r\nterms that are reasonable and balanced, I expect Ireland \r\nto give its full support. In Ireland, we know from our \r\nown experience that peace does not come easily. It \r\nrequires political will and difficult compromises. But \r\nwe also know the benefits of peace. There can be no \r\ndoubting the hugely transformative power for the \r\nMiddle East region of a final end to the Arab-Israeli \r\nconflict. \r\n The international community has invested far too \r\nmuch effort and resources over the past decades not to \r\ndo all it can now to assist a return to direct talks by the \r\ntwo sides. In the words of Martin Luther King, we \r\ncannot ignore the fierce urgency of now. \r\n I again urge the Government of Israel to halt all \r\nsettlement expansion. I also call on it to end the unjust \r\nblockade of Gaza by opening up land crossings to \r\nnormal commercial, human and humanitarian traffic. \r\n The search for freedom and equality drives the \r\nenormously important work being done by the United \r\nNations and by its individual Member States in the area \r\nof development. \r\n The Millennium Development Goals provide the \r\nessential framework for international development \r\nefforts up to 2015. As we look beyond 2015, the United \r\nNations must remain central to the fight to end poverty \r\nand hunger in the world. \r\n A century and a half ago, the streets around this \r\nbuilding where we now meet, and throughout this great \r\ncity, were thronged with tens of thousands of Irish \r\npeople who came here as refugees from famine. To this \r\nvery day, the memory of that time remains with the \r\nIrish people. \r\n Hunger remains humankind’s greatest enemy. As \r\nwe meet today in New York, some 12 million people \r\nare struggling to find food to keep their families alive \r\nin the Horn of Africa. Seven hundred and fifty-\r\nthousand are at imminent risk of death from hunger. \r\nThe immediate cause of this crisis is drought, but its \r\nseverity is the result of a combination of factors, \r\nincluding conflict, insecurity and persistent \r\nunderdevelopment. We have a moral obligation to act \r\nin the face of such suffering.  \r\n Ireland is providing over $67 million to the Horn \r\nof Africa in 2011 and 2012, in direct life saving \r\nhumanitarian assistance and through measures to \r\nenhance food security. The clear lesson of previous \r\nhumanitarian emergencies in Africa is that we must \r\naddress the causes in order to prevent future crises. The \r\nneed to address the systemic global hunger crisis is, \r\nand will remain, central to Ireland’s development \r\nassistance programme. Our objective is to save lives \r\ntoday and build new futures for communities ravaged \r\nby hunger. The Scaling Up Nutrition movement, \r\nlaunched at the United Nations a year ago, makes a \r\nclear link between under-nutrition among mothers and \r\nbabies and the building of a healthy, educated and \r\nprosperous society in the future. \r\n We need to act together now to provide long-term \r\nsustainable solutions that will decisively break the \r\ncycle of food shortages. We believe that a strong focus \r\nis essential on building the productivity of smallholder \r\nfarmers in sub-Saharan Africa, 80 per cent of whom are \r\nwomen and the primary care givers of children and \r\nproviders of food, fuel and water. \r\n We know that climate change is \r\ndisproportionately affecting their lives and their \r\nlivelihoods. Their farms and livestock are less \r\nproductive. Their coping mechanisms are less \r\neffective. Over time, they are vulnerable to abject \r\npoverty and despair. I believe that there is a compelling \r\ncase for “climate justice”, namely, bringing \r\ndevelopmental fairness to bear on the climate change \r\nagenda. \r\n The global financial and economic crisis presents \r\nmajor challenges for all of us in our efforts to maintain \r\nsolidarity with developing countries. Aid budgets are \r\nunder significant pressure. But we will not turn our \r\nbacks on the world’s poorest. In Ireland, despite the \r\neconomic difficulties that we are facing, and because \r\nwe recognize our moral obligation and our interests, \r\nvalues and principles as a member of the international \r\ncommunity, development will remain at the heart of \r\nour foreign policy. We remain committed to the United \r\n A/66/PV.25\r\n \r\n27 11-51384 \r\n \r\nNations target of providing 0.7 per cent of gross \r\nnational income to Official Development Assistance \r\n(ODA). We will continue to work to achieve that \r\ntarget. \r\n As Ireland will sustain its ODA effort, we will \r\nalso maintain our longstanding engagement across \r\ncritical areas of United Nations work. We remain \r\nstrongly supportive of the vital role of the United \r\nNations in peacekeeping and conflict resolution. \r\nRecently a 440-strong battalion of peacekeepers from \r\nthe Irish Defence Forces returned to serve with the \r\nUnited Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, the first \r\ncountry to which we deployed peacekeepers more than \r\nhalf a century ago. \r\n A deep attachment to the values of freedom and \r\nequality and other core human rights principles \r\nunderpins our candidature for election to the Human \r\nRights Council at the elections to be held in 2012. If \r\nelected, we look forward to making a strong \r\ncontribution to the work of enhancing the Council’s \r\nperformance and promoting respect for human rights \r\nworldwide. \r\n We will continue to push for the disarmament \r\nmachinery of the United Nations to become more \r\nresponsive to twenty-first century imperatives. Key \r\nchallenges for the year ahead include the \r\nimplementation of the agreements reached at last \r\nyear’s Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference, as \r\nwell as the negotiation of a robust arms trade treaty. \r\nWe will maintain a strong focus on the implementation \r\nand universalization of the Convention on Cluster \r\nMunitions, adopted in Dublin three years ago. \r\n Regional organizations have always been vital \r\npartners for the United Nations in the areas of peace, \r\nsecurity and conflict resolution. Next year, Ireland will \r\nchair the Organization for Security and Cooperation in \r\nEurope (OSCE). We look forward to making our \r\ncontribution to the resolution of the so-called \r\nprotracted conflicts within the OSCE region. Our \r\nchairmanship will be a practical demonstration of \r\nIreland’s strong commitment to multilateralism and \r\nwill draw on our own national experience of conflict \r\nresolution. \r\n Over the past week, the Assembly has heard of a \r\nformidable array of challenges facing the world. Peace \r\nand security, human rights, the elimination of hunger: \r\nthese are among the great moral imperatives of our \r\ntime. Underlying each of them is the need to assert the \r\nfreedom and equality of all human beings. Now more \r\nthan ever, the United Nations is demonstrating that it is \r\nthe home for these fundamental values and goals and \r\nthe arena in which we can best pursue collective \r\nsolutions. \r\n Ireland will play its full part in the search for \r\nthose solutions. Whether it is to bring peace to parts of \r\nthe world ravaged by conflict, relief to those threatened \r\nby famine and starvation or protection to those \r\nafflicted by human rights abuses, we will make our \r\ncontribution. We will stand up, in the Assembly and \r\nelsewhere, for fairness, for justice, for freedom and for \r\nequality, in the conduct of international relations. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Kenneth Baugh, Deputy \r\nPrimer Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs and \r\nTrade of Jamaica.  \r\n Mr. Baugh (Jamaica): I would like to \r\ncongratulate the President on his assumption of the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth \r\nsession. We are confident that his extensive diplomatic \r\nexperience will inform his leadership at this session. I \r\nassure him of my delegation’s full support.  \r\n During the sixty-fifth session of the General \r\nAssembly, we benefited from the skilled leadership of \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss. I wish to recognize \r\nhis sterling contribution to the work of that session. \r\n We join others in welcoming the newest Member \r\nof the United Nations family — the Republic of South \r\nSudan. The emergence of South Sudan as a sovereign \r\nState underscores the fundamental value and relevance \r\nof the theme of this year’s General Assembly session, \r\nnamely, “The role of mediation in the settlement of \r\ndisputes by peaceful means”. We salute the tenacity of \r\nthe people of South Sudan in their struggle to gain \r\nstatehood after five decades of conflict. We urge all \r\nsides and factions not to allow rivalries and revenge to \r\nimpede growth and development. The international \r\ncommunity must assist South Sudan as it embarks on \r\nthe daunting journey of stabilization and nation \r\nbuilding. \r\n We look out at a global political landscape that is \r\nmarked by turbulence and uncertainty. The \r\ndevelopments over the past several months in the \r\nMiddle East and North Africa in particular are stark \r\nreminders that the legitimate aspirations of citizens for \r\nA/66/PV.25  \r\n \r\n11-51384 28 \r\n \r\nfreedom, inclusive Government and respect for human \r\nrights cannot be indefinitely suppressed. \r\n Longstanding disputes and pockets of political \r\ninstability and conflict continue to fester in several \r\nparts of the world, resulting in social and economic \r\ndislocation and humanitarian crises. If the United \r\nNations is to effectively respond to those situations of \r\nconflict, its preventive diplomacy capacity, including \r\nmediation capacity, must be strengthened. \r\n Many conflicts have their roots in racial and \r\nreligious intolerance, resulting in social exclusion, \r\nmarginalization and the alienation of people. The High-\r\nlevel Meeting to commemorate the tenth anniversary of \r\nthe adoption of the Durban Declaration and Programme \r\nof Action against racism, racial discrimination, \r\nxenophobia and related intolerance, obliged us to \r\nreflect on the global community’s inadequate \r\ncompliance with the objectives of the Programme of \r\nAction. Recognizing the danger in such situations of \r\npotential conflict and providing full support for the \r\nProgramme are congruent with the principles implied \r\nin the theme for this session of the General Assembly. \r\n Related to that is the continued support of the \r\ninternational community for the project to erect a \r\npermanent memorial to the victims of slavery and the \r\ntrans-Atlantic slave trade, as a visible message of the \r\nDurban Declaration and Programme of Action. Jamaica \r\nthanks all those countries that have contributed to the \r\nerection of the memorial and looks forward to its \r\ncompletion within a reasonable time frame. \r\n Peace and development are mutually reinforcing \r\nand intrinsically linked to growth and prosperity. It is \r\ntherefore important that we consciously seek to \r\nstrengthen and support the role of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission, recognizing the linkages between \r\npeacekeeping and peacebuilding and the transition \r\nfrom stabilization to consolidation. \r\n The resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict \r\nis long overdue. It is time to end the occupation of \r\nPalestinian territory. It is time for the people of \r\nPalestine and Israel to live in peace and mutual \r\nsecurity. Jamaica remains unwavering in its support for \r\na just, lasting and comprehensive agreement that \r\nrecognizes the Palestinian State within the pre-1967 \r\nborders and guarantees the security of Israel. The focus \r\nmust now be on ending the stalemate and reviving \r\ndirect negotiations between Israel and Palestine. In that \r\nregard, Jamaica welcomes the declarations to the \r\nGeneral Assembly by both Palestine and Israel of their \r\nreadiness to do so. \r\n Both sides must now re-engage in good faith, \r\ntaking no action that could undermine the possibility of \r\na durable solution. Central to that must be Israel’s \r\ncessation of settlement building and expansion in the \r\noccupied territories and, on the part of the Palestinian \r\nleadership and people, the renunciation of violence \r\nagainst Israel and acceptance of its right to exist. The \r\ndoor to peaceful negotiations will not be forever open, \r\nnor can there be a continuing delay to Palestine’s \r\nassumption of its rightful place in the global \r\ncommunity of States. \r\n The spread of globalization is well advanced, and \r\nour economies and growth prospects are interlinked in \r\na vast network of economic opportunities. In these \r\ndifficult financial times, developing countries are \r\nforced to take painful policy decisions aimed at \r\nrecalibrating our economic plans to address immediate \r\nchallenges while laying the groundwork for the \r\nfulfilment of our long-term development goals.  \r\n The balancing act that this involves can have dire \r\nconsequences for our most vulnerable nationals. We all \r\nhave to take ownership of our own development \r\nprocess and the necessary steps to provide an economic \r\nenvironment that is conducive to growth and \r\nprosperity. To that end, we are compelled to adopt \r\napproaches that are innovative, pro-active and \r\ncollaborative. It is through adopting such approaches \r\nthat many countries and regions have made significant \r\ninroads in the attainment of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). \r\n I wish to refer to the struggles of two \r\nneighbouring Caribbean countries to achieve \r\ndevelopment. Haiti, in the wake of its disruptive \r\ndisaster, and in line with its successful efforts for \r\npolitical organization, needs the continued support of \r\nthe international community to foster its development, \r\nif its democratic gains are to be consolidated. Cuba \r\nmust have the space to foment its own development, \r\nfree from the decades-long embargo that has slowed its \r\ngrowth, but not its will to improve the welfare of its \r\npeople and that of other developing countries. A strong \r\nCuban economy, integrated into the Caribbean \r\nmarketplace, is essential to the region’s development. \r\n We are faced with the reality that, although we all \r\noperate in one global economy, with the same \r\naspirations for growth and sustainable development, \r\n A/66/PV.25\r\n \r\n29 11-51384 \r\n \r\nwe do not all have the same resources or capabilities. \r\nIn addition to being acutely vulnerable to the vagaries \r\nof the global economic environment, the development \r\nprospects of many developing countries are frequently \r\nundermined by environmental degradation and climate \r\nchange.  \r\n Classifications that are ostensibly positive, such \r\nas our own designation as an upper-middle-income \r\ncountry, serve to obscure several of the development \r\nchallenges that we continue to face, particularly in \r\naccessing development financing and assistance, which \r\nare critical to our development process and the \r\nattainment of the MDGs. The range of socio-economic \r\ncharacteristics and levels of development of countries \r\nthat fall in the middle-income category is indicative of \r\nthe need for us to move towards harmonization of the \r\ncriteria used in classification and resources allocation. \r\n Developing countries like ours have undertaken \r\npainful adjustments to achieve fiscal discipline and \r\nmacroeconomic stability within an open economy. We \r\ncontinue to pursue free trade agreements at the \r\nregional, hemispheric and global levels. However, the \r\nmissing link to progress is the urgent need to build \r\ncapacities in developing countries through \r\ninfrastructure development, institution-building and \r\nexpanding and enhancing productive capacity for \r\ncompetitiveness and to meet international quality \r\nstandards.  \r\n Moving from an economy primarily driven by \r\ncommodities to one that is value-added, knowledge-\r\nbased, innovative and technology-driven is a \r\ntransformation that, although challenging for \r\ndeveloping countries, must be achieved. Without \r\neffective partnerships between the large and small \r\neconomies for mutual benefit, balanced trade and \r\nshared growth, that is unlikely to occur.  \r\n I speak here positively of the increasing South-\r\nSouth cooperation that offers hope to many developing \r\ncountries. We have long recognized that we can \r\nmaximize our growth prospects through increased \r\neconomic partnerships and investment opportunities, \r\nwhich ultimately lead to improvements in trade \r\nrelations. Indeed, the reality is that development aid is \r\nan essential resource, which is used by developing \r\ncountries to offset the financial burden involved in the \r\nexecution of major development projects.  \r\n Unfortunately, much development aid and \r\nassistance to developing countries continue to fall short \r\nof the agreed goal of 0.7 per cent of gross national \r\nincome, as some of our developed partners fail to meet \r\ntheir commitments. Closing the gap between \r\ncommitment to development and the provision of \r\nresources that will facilitate the implementation of its \r\nvarious components requires political courage. We \r\ncommend those partners who have maintained or \r\nexceeded their official development assistance targets \r\ndespite their own economic challenges. \r\n We continue to count on the support of our \r\npartners and the international community to help drive \r\nour social and development goals and to keep our \r\nsafety nets in place. International financial and \r\ndevelopment assistance help to strengthen our \r\ndevelopment process and to address setbacks from \r\nexternal shocks on our economic planning and social \r\ninvestments. Development funding is critical in the \r\nrecovery of our agricultural, mining and tourism \r\nindustries, which are often adversely affected by \r\nclimate change and the impact of natural disasters. So, \r\ntoo, are the transfer of technology and capacity \r\nbuilding. \r\n We urge our partners to recommit to the \r\ndevelopment agenda, both here at the United Nations \r\nand within the context of the Bretton Woods \r\ninstitutions. We reiterate our call for the reform of the \r\ninternational financial institutions towards increased \r\ntransparency and accountability, and an increased role \r\nfor the developing countries in decision-making. \r\n We welcome the increased attention that the \r\nGroup of Twenty (G-20) has paid to development \r\nissues and are encouraged by the consultative approach \r\nin its relations with the United Nations. It is imperative \r\nthat the G-20’s activities in respect of development \r\naccord with the central role of the United Nations in \r\neconomic development. \r\n The Doha Development Round of trade \r\nnegotiations, which began in good faith nearly a \r\ndecade ago, has the potential to significantly improve \r\nthe development prospects of most developing \r\ncountries. We therefore urge the full re-engagement of \r\nall parties in the process, so that we might move \r\nbeyond the current impasse and usher in a new era of \r\nmultilateral trade relations. This must take into account \r\nthe preservation of policy space and flexibility for \r\ndeveloping countries in areas that are integral to our \r\nability to build competitiveness and trade capacity. We \r\nremain hopeful that at the eighth Ministerial \r\nA/66/PV.25  \r\n \r\n11-51384 30 \r\n \r\nConference, to be held in December, we will consider a \r\npackage of measures as the basis for a more balanced \r\ntrade regime that will serve as a catalyst for increased \r\neconomic growth and prosperity worldwide. We must \r\ncommit to ensuring that development remains a central \r\nobjective of the negotiations. \r\n We support coordinated and collaborative efforts \r\nwithin the context of the review and implementation of \r\nthe Aid for Trade Initiative in support of developing \r\ncountries. We will continue to work with our \r\ninternational partners and aid and development entities \r\nin expanding the Initiative to build on the supply-side \r\ncapacity and infrastructure of developing countries, so \r\nthat we can take advantage of trade opportunities and \r\nconnections within the global economy. \r\n Jamaica has embarked on an export-led trade \r\npolicy with the full involvement of the business sector \r\nwithin the context of the World Trade Organization \r\nTrade Policy Review institutional framework. The \r\nstrategic formulation of our trade policy process \r\nincludes collaboration with the private sector \r\nparticularly given its central role and expertise in \r\nmanufacturing and exporting. Our success in trade \r\ndevelopment is strongly dependent on partnerships \r\nwith the private sector as we agree to policy directives \r\nand pursue an export-led trade initiative, while being \r\nmindful of our resources and capacity to export, as \r\nwell as business opportunities and market intelligence \r\nglobally. \r\n Other critical challenges such as food security, \r\nenergy security, climate change, poverty and diseases, \r\ncontinue to demand the attention of the international \r\ncommunity. Precisely because of their transnational \r\ncharacter, many of these problems require multilateral \r\ncooperation and action in an inclusive framework that \r\ninvolves both developed and developing countries. \r\n A year ago, world leaders gathered at the General \r\nAssembly to take stock of the progress made towards \r\nthe attainment of the Millennium Development Goals. \r\nWe renewed our commitments to achieving those \r\ntargets by 2015. We acknowledge the support and \r\npartnership in the midst of the global economic \r\nchallenges. Nonetheless, with four years left until the \r\n2015 deadline, we are deeply concerned at the slow \r\npace of delivery on commitments made in several key \r\nareas, namely, ODA, trade, debt relief and access to \r\nnew technologies and affordable essential medicines. \r\n Jamaica renews the appeal made by our Prime \r\nMinister at the summit last year for an emergency \r\nprogramme to re-energize the MDG agenda. Without \r\nsuch a programme, those targets will remain elusive in \r\n2015 and beyond. The fiscal policy requirements \r\nattached to the resources made available for developing \r\ncountries through institutions like the International \r\nMonetary Fund cannot assist in meeting the MDG \r\ntargets in the short run. It is therefore critical that we \r\nreinvigorate the Global Partnership for Development \r\naligned with MDG 8. Critical also must be the \r\nchannelling of resources and the fiscal space to support \r\nprogrammes for economic empowerment and capacity \r\nbuilding. More concessionary loans and grants and \r\ndebt-for-equity swaps should be among the instruments \r\nused. \r\n Jamaica is on track to meet most of the MDGs \r\ndespite the economic and financial challenges. Through \r\nassistance from the Global Fund, we have significantly \r\nincreased access to antiretroviral drugs and reduced the \r\nrates of HIV/AIDS infection, mother-to-child \r\ntransmission and AIDS mortality. At the High-level \r\nMeeting on AIDS held in June, Member States \r\ncommitted to bold new targets for the AIDS response, \r\nincluding scaling up investments. As a result of its \r\nreclassification as an upper-middle-income country, \r\nJamaica will not be eligible to access those funds. This \r\nputs us at risk of reversing the gains made in halting \r\nthe spread of HIV. We again urge that the factors used \r\nby the relevant multilateral agencies in the \r\nmeasurement of a country’s wealth be reviewed, as \r\ntheir classifications often bear no resemblance to the \r\nrealities on the ground. They must more carefully take \r\ninto account a country’s indebtedness and capacity to \r\npay, as well as its fiscal capacity to finance \r\nprogrammes that are taken for granted in respect of \r\nmiddle-income countries. \r\n We are pleased that the international community \r\nembraced the proposal made by the Caribbean \r\nCommunity for United Nations emphasis on \r\nnon-communicable diseases (NCDs), the silent killer of \r\nmillions around the world. The High-level Meeting on \r\nNCDs last week allowed us for the first time to agree \r\nto measures to significantly reduce NCDs. The political \r\ndeclaration we adopted (resolution 66/2, annex), while \r\nnot as ambitious as Jamaica would have preferred, \r\nprovides a good basis to address the prevention and \r\ncontrol of NCDs. We urge the United Nations system \r\nand Member States to expeditiously implement \r\n A/66/PV.25\r\n \r\n31 11-51384 \r\n \r\nmeasures to achieve the agreed targets and indicators \r\non NCDs. \r\n The famine in the Horn of Africa, precipitated by \r\nthe worst drought in half a century, is of grave concern \r\nto us all. It has heightened our awareness of the \r\ndevastating impact of natural disasters on poor \r\ndeveloping countries. We must adopt more concrete \r\nmeasures on food security, building on the progress \r\nmade from the World Summit on Food Security and \r\nworking closely with the World Food Programme and \r\nthe United Nations Office for the Coordination of \r\nHumanitarian Affairs to strengthen international \r\nhumanitarian response and assistance, particularly in \r\nareas that are prone to disasters and conflicts. The \r\nplight of starving populations, including mothers and \r\ninfants in the region, must push us towards the \r\ncommitments of the World Food Summit Plan of \r\nAction. \r\n To sustain the global food market and feed our \r\npopulations, we have to engage in greater investments \r\nin science and research to boost agricultural \r\nproduction — especially in poor rural communities — \r\nas well as to offset the effect of drought and famine. \r\nWe equally have to increase investment in transport \r\nand agricultural infrastructure to facilitate the storage \r\nof food, its marketing and packaging and its \r\ntransportation to marketplaces. \r\n Speculative action in the global market, with the \r\nattendant volatility in commodity prices, has generated \r\nsocio-economic tensions in various countries across the \r\nglobe. The constant increases in food prices not only \r\ncreate further strain on the economy and on social \r\nwelfare, but also threaten food security and deepen the \r\neconomic challenges of countries that are already \r\nstriving to recover from the global financial crisis. \r\nJamaica therefore welcomes the initiative launched by \r\nPresident Sarkozy of France for the G-20 to give \r\nserious consideration to this question of financial \r\nspeculation in the prices of petroleum and food at the \r\nsummit to be held in November. This is a burgeoning \r\ncrisis, which the United Nations must also take \r\nseriously. \r\n Climate change presents a clear and present \r\ndanger to human development, particularly in small \r\nisland developing States and least developed States. \r\nProgress was made at the United Nations Climate \r\nChange Conference in Cancún last December, when \r\ncommon ground was reached between developed and \r\ndeveloping countries on several key issues. We must \r\nnow implement and operationalize those decisions. We \r\nremain disappointed at the slow pace of climate change \r\nfinancing. \r\n The United Nations Climate Change Conference \r\nin Durban in December will provide yet another \r\nopportunity to forge consensus on effective adaptation \r\nand mitigation strategies within the context of an \r\nambitious post-2012 climate change framework. A \r\nsecond commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol is \r\nessential, and we remain optimistic that at Durban we \r\nwill all demonstrate the necessary political will and \r\nseriousness of purpose to achieve that. \r\n At the United Nations we share a common \r\nbackground in the 1983 World Commission on \r\nEnvironment and Development and the 1987 report \r\n“Our Common Future” (A/42/427, annex). We share an \r\nawareness that the nations of the world are \r\ninterdependent, experience interlocking crises and have \r\na common but differently shaded responsibility. We \r\nhave agreed on the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change and the Kyoto \r\nProtocol. We share the conviction that inequality, \r\npoverty and the environment and environmental \r\ndegradation are linked and that development and the \r\nenvironment are inseparable. In the light of that \r\nbackground, we urge a renewed commitment to the \r\npursuit of development that is sustainable, through \r\nincreased attention to all three pillars of sustainable \r\ndevelopment — the environmental, the socio-political \r\nand the economic — and a redoubling of efforts to \r\nintegrate sustainable development principles at the \r\ninternational, regional and, most important, national \r\nlevels, and  \r\n “meet[ing] the needs of the present without \r\ncompromising the ability of future generations to \r\nmeet their own needs”. (A/42/427, annex, \r\nconclusion, para. 1) \r\n As a small island developing State, we have a \r\nvested interest in the successful outcome of the 2012 \r\nUnited Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (Rio+20) to review the implementation \r\nof the commitments made 20 years ago at the \r\nConference in Rio de Janeiro. States and regions are \r\nalready assessing the progress that we have made and \r\nthe gaps that persist in our efforts to chart a more \r\nsustainable course to development in the period since \r\nthe 1992 Conference. Significant gaps that cause \r\nA/66/PV.25  \r\n \r\n11-51384 32 \r\n \r\nconcern relate to the transfer of technology, capacity-\r\nbuilding and the provision of additional financial \r\nresources for development. \r\n In our efforts to strengthen the international \r\nsustainable development architecture, the emphasis \r\nshould be on effectiveness, on the efficacy of \r\ninstitutions that not only facilitate extensive policy \r\ndiscussions, but that also move us towards fulfilment \r\nof the ambitious vision that we all embraced in Rio in \r\n1992. We should also aim for institutional flexibility, \r\nwhich will allow us to address long-standing and \r\nemerging challenges through increased cooperation and \r\ncoordination. \r\n Rio+20 will provide us with an excellent \r\nopportunity to renew our commitment to Agenda 21, \r\nthe Johannesburg Plan of Implementation and, in \r\nrespect of the small island developing States, the \r\nBarbados Programme of Action and the Mauritius \r\nStrategy on its implementation. \r\n As host to the International Seabed Authority, \r\nJamaica attaches great importance to ocean affairs and \r\nthe law of the sea. Next year marks the thirtieth \r\nanniversary of the opening for signature of the United \r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea, drawn up in \r\nMontego Bay. We encourage Member States to \r\nappropriately highlight that landmark event at the \r\ninternational level. \r\n The total elimination of nuclear weapons remains \r\nan important goal for the international community. \r\nWhile we have taken significant steps towards \r\nachieving that goal, significant challenges remain. A \r\nnumber of key players remain outside the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), and the \r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty has still not \r\nentered into force. As we look towards the start of the \r\npreparatory process for the 2015 NPT Review \r\nConference, there must be unquestionable political will \r\nto address those lingering deficiencies in our push to \r\nachieve a world free of nuclear weapons. \r\n We must continue to build on the momentum \r\ngained from last year’s special high-level meeting of \r\nthe General Assembly on transnational organized \r\ncrime, which addressed measures to counter the \r\ngrowing problem, including narco-trafficking and the \r\nillicit trade in small arms and ammunition. \r\n Jamaica, like its partners in the Caribbean \r\nCommunity, continues to face severe threats to our \r\nlong-term socio-economic development from illicit \r\ntrafficking in narcotic drugs, small arms and light \r\nweapons and ammunition. We will remain resolute in \r\nour fight against this menace both locally and abroad. \r\nWe have achieved marked reductions in crime and \r\ncriminal activities over the past year with our \r\nmultifaceted strategy to stem the problems, as well as \r\nthrough the implementation of social intervention and \r\nsocial transformation initiatives to stem the problem of \r\ncrime and violence. We continue to strengthen the \r\ncapacity of our security forces and to improve our \r\njustice system, to ensure that criminals are caught and \r\nprosecuted in a court of law.  \r\n We firmly believe, however, that we will not see \r\nthe full impact of those efforts without an international \r\nregime that regulates the sale and transfer of \r\nconventional weapons, in particular small arms and \r\nlight weapons and their ammunition. To that end, \r\nJamaica is committed to ensuring that the 2012 \r\nDiplomatic Conference on the Arms Trade Treaty \r\nresults in a legally binding, comprehensive, objective \r\nand transparent Treaty. \r\n In order for the United Nations to deliver on all \r\nour expectations, its organizational structure must \r\nreflect the geopolitical realities of the twenty-first \r\ncentury. An effective response to global challenges \r\nrequires a reformed and dynamic United Nations. \r\nReform initiatives, spanning a number of years, have \r\nled to the establishment of UN-Women, the reform and \r\nstrengthening of the Economic and Social Council, a \r\nmore coordinated and efficient response to \r\nhumanitarian crises and a change in the way we \r\nconduct our peacekeeping missions. We must continue \r\nour efforts aimed at revitalizing the General Assembly \r\nso that it can effectively carry out its role and \r\nresponsibility as the chief deliberative and \r\npolicymaking organ of the United Nations. \r\n A glaring failure has been our inability to agree \r\non reform of the Security Council to ensure that it is \r\nmore democratic, responsive and reflective of today’s \r\npolitical environment. For more than 15 years, the \r\ndebates for comprehensive and lasting reform of the \r\nCouncil have achieved very little. The African \r\ncountries and our Latin American and Caribbean region \r\nstill have no permanent seat at the table. That injustice \r\ncannot continue. Comprehensive reform can only be \r\nachieved within the intergovernmental negotiating \r\nprocess. Anything less will be nothing more than a \r\ncontinuation of the status quo. \r\n A/66/PV.25\r\n \r\n33 11-51384 \r\n \r\n As we continue to work together to achieve \r\nsustainable development for all, it is imperative that we \r\nexercise the requisite political will and make good on \r\nour commitments to the global development agenda. \r\nThe far-reaching effects of the multiple and \r\ninterconnected crises of recent years have reinforced \r\nour interdependence and the important role of \r\neconomic cooperation and partnerships in securing \r\nglobal peace and prosperity. \r\n We must redouble our efforts to address the \r\ngrowing challenges of poverty, food insecurity, the \r\nrising costs of food and energy, and climate change. It \r\nis not good enough to engage in extensive \r\ndeliberations, to make commitments and issue \r\ndeclarations without providing the means for their \r\nimplementation, including financing, capacity-building \r\nand technology transfer. We must now go beyond grand \r\nstatements if we are to fully realize sustainable \r\ndevelopment and rekindle the faith of the people we \r\nserve in the United Nations. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Theodore Brent Symonette, \r\nDeputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas. \r\n Mr. Symonette (Bahamas): On behalf of the \r\npeople and the Government of the Commonwealth of \r\nthe Bahamas, I congratulate Mr. Al-Nasser on his \r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-sixth session. I assure him of my delegation’s \r\nfull support and cooperation. I also extend gratitude to \r\nhis predecessor for his stewardship of the Assembly \r\nduring its sixty-fifth session, and I would also like to \r\nextend congratulations to Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his \r\nre-election as Secretary-General. \r\n I also take this opportunity to congratulate and \r\nwelcome the Republic of South Sudan as the \r\n193rd State Member of the United Nations and to \r\nconvey the best wishes of my Government and people \r\nfor its peace and prosperity. \r\n On behalf of the Government and the people of \r\nthe Commonwealth of the Bahamas, I wish to express \r\nregret at the loss of life and the tremendous and wide-\r\nranging destruction caused by hurricanes and tropical \r\nstorms during the summer season. The Bahamas, as \r\nwell as a number of Caribbean islands and, indeed, the \r\nEast Coast of the United States, were particularly hard-\r\nhit by Hurricane Irene. The devastation caused by each \r\nof those storms reinforces the need for global attention \r\nto the adverse impacts of climate change and natural \r\ndisasters. The storms’ trail of destruction, which took \r\nlives, flattened homes and businesses, toppled trees and \r\nspread debris across roadways and bridges, and which, \r\nin some cases, caused almost certain irreversible \r\ndamage to coastal areas and ecosystems, compels, we \r\nbelieve, the international community to take immediate \r\nmeasures to address climatic phenomena which cause \r\nsuch huge losses and which threaten so many \r\ncountries. \r\n For us, the increased frequency and intensity of \r\nnatural disasters, including hurricanes, some due to the \r\neffects of climate change, are among the major \r\nchallenges faced at the national level. Other \r\nenvironmental challenges, including waste and water-\r\nresource management issues, together with economic \r\nand social challenges, all constitute serious constraints \r\nfor the Bahamas. \r\n We are committed to mainstreaming sustainable \r\ndevelopment principles into our national development \r\nstrategies. Progress is being made in the key areas of \r\nprotecting our biodiversity and supporting the \r\ndevelopment of policies promoting renewable energy. \r\nWe look forward to continuing to collaborate with \r\ninternational partners so as to achieve even greater \r\nsuccess in the years ahead. In this vein, the Bahamas \r\nlooks forward to next year’s United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development. We fully \r\nexpect that the Conference will take into account \r\nunmet needs in connection with each of the three \r\npillars of sustainable development, that is, economic, \r\nsocial and environmental. \r\n We face an increasingly complex set of global \r\nchallenges, which has given rise to an equally complex \r\nnetwork of formal and informal global institutions and \r\nmechanisms designed to enhance collective action to \r\naddress these challenges. Consequently, the question of \r\ninternational governance as it relates to the global \r\nagenda has become a pressing issue in recent years. \r\n The global economic crisis of the past three years \r\nhas underscored the need for more effective global \r\ngovernance, as has the long and sometimes \r\ncontroversial debate on reform of the Security Council. \r\nArguably, at the heart of all of these issues, particularly \r\nfor some small developing States such as the Bahamas, \r\nis the need to ensure that our global systems are able to \r\neffectively respond to evolving global challenges in an \r\ninclusive, participatory and transparent manner. \r\nA/66/PV.25  \r\n \r\n11-51384 34 \r\n \r\n With respect to international economic \r\ngovernance, the Bahamas is acutely aware of the \r\ngrowing role of the Group of 20 (G-20) and the need to \r\naddress how the Group would be better able to engage \r\nand consult a wider range of countries, as well as the \r\nUnited Nations as a whole, with a view to helping to \r\ntranslate G-20 deliberations into effective actions on a \r\nglobal scale. Fortunately, the work of the Global \r\nGovernance Group has been largely successful in this \r\nregard. Indeed, the Bahamas joined the Group with the \r\nunderstanding that the United Nations has a central \r\nrole in global economic governance and that serious \r\nengagement with the G-20 would allow for a clearer \r\nunderstanding of their respective strengths and \r\ncomparative advantages. \r\n Reform of the Security Council is no more a \r\nreality today than it was a year ago, or even 10 years \r\nago. This remains, however, an important goal, as it \r\nstands as a harbinger of success for other equally \r\npressing global governance activities that will \r\ninevitably affect each and every country regardless of \r\nits size, economic or political power. The aspirations of \r\nthe marginalized for greater democratization, \r\ninclusiveness, representativeness, transparency and \r\naccountability are no less legitimate at the international \r\nlevel than they are at the national or local levels. If the \r\nCouncil is to fully fulfil its responsibility for \r\ninternational peace and security, it must reflect the \r\ngeopolitical realities of our world in its composition as \r\nwell as in its modus operandi. The Bahamas therefore \r\ncontinues to support Security Council expansion in \r\nboth categories and the reform of its working methods. \r\n The Bahamas believes that the main strength of \r\nthe United Nations is its inclusiveness, as it is perhaps \r\nthe only global body with unquestionable legitimacy. \r\nHence, we envision a greater role for the United \r\nNations in a number of areas, not in order to duplicate \r\nwork done elsewhere, but to help in other areas of \r\ncritical importance to small developing countries, \r\nincluding international cooperation in tax matters. \r\n The Bahamas, along with many Caribbean \r\nCommunity (CARICOM) countries, continues to seek \r\nthe conversion of the Committee of Experts on \r\nInternational Cooperation on Tax Matters into an \r\nintergovernmental subsidiary body of the Economic \r\nand Social Council, the central goal being to give small \r\ndeveloping countries an effective voice when issues of \r\ncooperation on tax matters are being decided by the \r\ninternational community. Likewise, we recommend a \r\ngreater role for the United Nations in the areas of \r\ninternational financial regulation and credit-rating \r\nsystems. \r\n As regards the global economic and financial \r\ncrisis, it is important to note that many small middle-\r\nincome and ostensibly high-income developing States \r\nsuch as the Bahamas continue to grapple with lingering \r\neffects, including serious credit and employment \r\nchallenges — challenges that persist owing mainly to \r\nindebtedness; non-concessionary status with respect to \r\naccess to resources of the international financial \r\ninstitutions; and an increasing rate of erosion of \r\npreferential access to the markets of major \r\ndevelopment partners. \r\n The Bahamas continues to develop national \r\ninitiatives to address these and other related matters. \r\nWe have seen some success in maintaining a \r\nsustainable of Government debt to gross domestic \r\nproduct ratio; implementing measures to provide relief \r\nand assistance to Bahamians; and efforts to modernize \r\nand expand our public infrastructure as well as increase \r\ninvestment in our least developed islands. \r\n These national efforts must be met with \r\nappropriate and urgent actions at the international level \r\nin order to effectively respond to these challenges, as \r\nwell as to help sustain progress in achieving the \r\ninternationally agreed development goals, including \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. Such actions at \r\nthe international level must include the provision of \r\nnew and additional resources to assist developing \r\ncountries, in particular the most vulnerable among us, \r\nas well as the development of the necessary \r\nimplementation mechanisms. \r\n In that connection, the Bahamas wishes to \r\nunderline the importance of implementing the \r\nMonterrey Consensus of the International Conference \r\non Financing for Development. The Bahamas also \r\nwishes to highlight in this regard the critical role that a \r\nuniversal, rules-based, open, non-discriminatory and \r\nequitable multilateral trading system can play in \r\nstimulating economic growth and development in \r\ndeveloping countries. \r\n Migration can be, and has been, a positive force \r\nfor development internationally. Indeed, immigrants \r\nhave contributed to the development of the Bahamas in \r\nmany respects, largely through contributions to \r\neducation, health care and to the development of our \r\ntourism and financial services. Uncontrolled migration, \r\n A/66/PV.25\r\n \r\n35 11-51384 \r\n \r\nhowever, has also proved, and continues to be, a \r\nserious challenge to sustainable development. In this \r\ncontext, the Bahamas welcomes increased dialogue on \r\nimproving international cooperation with respect to \r\ninternational migration and development. We believe \r\nthat proper cooperation can help to ensure that \r\nmigration occurs through safe and regulated channels, \r\nto the benefit of both migrant and receiving States, like \r\nthe Bahamas. The Bahamas will continue to participate \r\nconstructively in the process leading to the second \r\nHigh-level Dialogue on International Migration and \r\nDevelopment, to be held by the General Assembly in \r\n2013, with a view to addressing these and other related \r\nissues. \r\n The Bahamas congratulates the people of Haiti on \r\nthe election and installation of a democratically elected \r\nPresident and Government. We are heartened by the \r\npeaceful and successful manner in which the second \r\nround of elections was concluded in Haiti. Political \r\nstability is fundamental to Haiti’s economic and social \r\ndevelopment. We hope that the issue of the \r\nappointment of a new Prime Minister will be resolved \r\nin the shortest possible time so that the Haitian people \r\ncan continue to recover from last year’s devastating \r\nearthquake and reconstruct their country with a view to \r\nits sustained and sustainable development. \r\n My delegation continues to commend the work of \r\nthe United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti \r\n(MINUSTAH). Over the years, MINUSTAH has played \r\na key role in helping to lay the foundation for long-\r\nterm recovery and stability in Haiti, with its support \r\nactivities for State institutions and the rehabilitation \r\nand training of the Haitian National Police. \r\nMINUSTAH’s role and functions should reflect the \r\ncountry’s development needs, as articulated by the \r\nGovernment. The support and engagement of the \r\ninternational community in Haiti is as pressing and \r\nurgent as ever, and MINUSTAH must continue to be an \r\nimportant factor in this regard. \r\n The issue of international peace and security \r\nremains a critical concern for the Organization, as it \r\ndoes for the entire global community. The Bahamas \r\nunequivocally condemns terrorism in all its forms and \r\nmanifestations and reiterates its commitment to the \r\nfight against it. The terror attacks of 11 September, the \r\nheinous attacks in Mumbai and Norway and at the \r\nUnited Nations headquarters in Nigeria demonstrate \r\nthat our efforts thus far have proved insufficient; hence \r\nthe urgency of our task. \r\n In an archipelago spread over some 100,000 \r\nsquare miles, the porous borders of the Bahamas have, \r\nfor many years, posed a challenge to national security \r\nas well as the rule of law. We are currently confronted \r\nby high levels of crime, too many of which involve the \r\nuse of small arms and light weapons. We are keenly \r\naware of the global threats posed by the illicit trade in \r\nsmall arms and light weapons, which is linked to other \r\naspects of transnational organized crime, including the \r\nillicit drug trade. \r\n The Bahamas, both nationally and internationally, \r\nis acting to reduce the threats that these criminal \r\nelements pose to our society. Nationally, we are \r\ncontinuing a programme of reform of our criminal \r\nlaws, modernizing and expanding our court system and \r\nstrengthening targeted programmes designed to address \r\nsocial ills. Regionally, we are working with other \r\nCARICOM nations to undertake a number of measures \r\nto combat these challenges. Internationally, the \r\nBahamas is committed to the implementation of the \r\nUnited Nations Programme of Action to Prevent, \r\nCombat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms \r\nand Light Weapons in All Its Aspects. \r\n Regulation of the import, export and transfer of \r\nconventional arms is critical if we are to achieve some \r\nmeasure of peace and stability and reduce conflicts. \r\nThe Bahamas supports a strong, effective and \r\nnon-discriminatory arms trade treaty and welcomes the \r\ninclusion of the category of small arms and light \r\nweapons and ammunition within the scope of a future \r\ntreaty. What is clearly evident is the need for an \r\nintegrated global response to supplement actions at the \r\nnational, regional and subregional levels if we are to \r\neffectively prevent, combat and eradicate the illicit \r\ntrade in small arms and light weapons, and thus reduce \r\nthe escalating violence and crime in our societies. \r\n The Government of the Bahamas continues to be \r\ncommitted to the 2001 and 2006 Declarations on \r\nHIV/AIDS (resolutions S-26/2 and 60/262). Our \r\nprogramme, now in its twenty-fifth year, has been very \r\nsuccessful. We would like to take this opportunity to \r\nthank our regional, hemispheric and international \r\npartners for their support. \r\n My Government is also dealing with the \r\nprevention and control of non-communicable diseases \r\n(NCDs), which pose an increasing threat to countries \r\nlike the Bahamas and others of the CARICOM \r\nsubregion. As our Prime Minister said in his national \r\nA/66/PV.25  \r\n \r\n11-51384 36 \r\n \r\naddress here last week (see A/66/PV.3), the health and \r\nsocio-economic costs required for Governments to treat \r\nNCDs are indeed enormous. The Bahamas and its \r\nfellow CARICOM countries welcome last week’s \r\nHigh-level Meeting on the Prevention and Control of \r\nNon-communicable Diseases, and applaud the \r\ninternational community’s attention to NCDs. We trust \r\nthat the adoption of the Political Declaration \r\n(resolution 66/2, annex), while it is not as action-\r\noriented as we envisaged when we undertook the \r\nmandate from our heads of Government four years ago, \r\nwill produce results. We would have preferred the text \r\nto have reflected stronger commitments and specific, \r\ntime-bound targets for addressing non-communicable \r\ndiseases and their risk factors. We look forward, \r\nhowever, to a comprehensive review of this issue in \r\n2014. \r\n With the world community witnessing an \r\nunprecedented wave in the call for social change and \r\ndemocracy across countries in the Arab world and in \r\nNorth Africa, we must ensure, in our desire to promote \r\ngood and effective governance, that respect for human \r\nrights and fundamental freedoms, as well as the \r\npromotion of civil and political rights and the right to \r\ndevelopment, forms the basis of any long-term \r\nsolution. My Government’s commitment to the \r\npromotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms \r\nis unwavering. \r\n This year we celebrate some significant \r\nachievements on the international human rights \r\nagenda: the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of \r\nthe Declaration on the Right to Development \r\n(resolution 41/128) and, more recently, the tenth \r\nanniversary, this week, of the adoption of the Durban \r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action. This year, we \r\nare also observing the International Year for People of \r\nAfrican Descent. \r\n In spite of the objectives of these laudable \r\ninitiatives for the advancement of the international \r\nhuman rights agenda and recent undertakings such as \r\nthe reform of the Human Rights Council, we are still \r\nconfronted with persistent poverty and stark \r\ninequalities, both within and across countries — \r\nracism, racial discrimination and related intolerance, \r\nsome 63 years after the landmark adoption of the \r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights (resolution \r\n217 (III)). These challenges serve as a constant \r\nreminder that we have much more to do to improve the \r\nlives of millions of disadvantaged and marginalized \r\npopulations throughout the world. While it is \r\nadvantageous to adopt declarations and renew \r\ncommitments, it is more important to ensure their \r\neffective implementation at the national, regional and \r\ninternational levels. The United Nations must therefore \r\ncontinue to reflect the ideals of its founding principles \r\nand unite us through a common vision of peace, mutual \r\nrespect and human rights for all. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on Mr. Hailemariam Desalegn, Deputy Prime \r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the \r\nFederal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia. \r\n Mr. Desalegn (Ethiopia): It gives me great \r\npleasure to congratulate the President on his election to \r\nlead the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. I \r\nwish to assure him of the full cooperation of my \r\ndelegation in successfully discharging his high \r\nresponsibilities. I would also like to express our \r\nappreciation to his predecessor for his excellent \r\nstewardship of the Assembly’s previous session. And \r\nallow me to take this opportunity to once again \r\ncongratulate Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on his \r\nreappointment to a second term, and to express our \r\nadmiration for work well done during his first term. \r\n It is with a great sense of brotherhood that I \r\nwarmly welcome the Republic of South Sudan to the \r\nfamily of our global Organization and offer our sincere \r\ncongratulations and best wishes to the newest Member \r\nState. We also welcome the Libyan delegation, which \r\nwe recognized some time ago. We are not oblivious to \r\nthe Herculean challenge that they face. \r\n The globalizing world has always presented \r\nchallenges to Africa and the developing world. \r\nHowever, the negative developments over the past few \r\nyears, which appear to be far from being mitigated, \r\nhave made it even more difficult for countries such as \r\nours to move ahead on the path to development as fast \r\nas we would have liked and our potential and \r\ncommitment would have allowed. There is a need for a \r\nredoubled effort so that the achievements of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals are not frustrated. \r\nThat was also the hope of the fourth United Nations \r\nConference on the Least Developed Countries. For our \r\npart, we feel that we have been on track for almost all \r\nthe targets, and our commitment is to be even more \r\nambitious, in line with our five-year Growth and \r\nTransformation Plan. Nevertheless, the global \r\neconomic situation is a source of concern. \r\n A/66/PV.25\r\n \r\n37 11-51384 \r\n \r\n Within that global context, the Horn of Africa has \r\nbeen hit by the worst adverse climatic conditions in 60 \r\nyears, causing a very tragic drought situation. At this \r\ncritical juncture, the international community should be \r\ngalvanized, particularly in helping to alleviate the \r\ncrisis in Somalia. The call made on Saturday at the \r\nmini-summit on that issue needs to be reiterated and \r\namplified. We should do more for the people of \r\nSomalia and those others in the region who have been \r\naffected by the calamity. \r\n Even more crucial in the Horn of Africa is \r\nsustainable development. Our youth need to have their \r\nhopes for the future not frustrated, and the condition of \r\nour women and children requires much greater \r\nattention. On top of denying people their human rights, \r\npoverty is not a solid foundation on which peace and \r\nsecurity can be built. That need compels us to draw \r\nattention to a number of challenges that we, in the \r\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) \r\nregion, face, particularly with respect to climate \r\nchange. The adverse consequences of climate change \r\nare becoming evident in various ways. The challenges \r\nare global, requiring global solutions, on the basis of \r\ncommon but differentiated responsibility. We do not \r\nbelieve that enough is being done commensurate with \r\nthe gravity of the threat to humanity in general. \r\nMoreover, the whole issue embodies injustice because \r\nAfrica and the developing world happen to be the \r\nworst affected, while contributing the least to climate \r\nchange. \r\n As members of IGAD, we have for some time \r\ntried to bring our collective effort to bear on the \r\nvarious challenges the Horn of Africa faces. Realizing \r\nthe fact that one of the major factors hindering \r\ndevelopment in our region is related to security and the \r\nlack of durable stability, apart from doing our best to \r\nlay the basis for the integration of our subregion \r\nthrough various infrastructure-related projects, we have \r\ncontinued to strengthen our common endeavour for \r\npeace and security in the IGAD region.  \r\n The positive outcomes are there to be seen. No \r\nregional group has been as closely identified with \r\npeacemaking in the Sudan as IGAD. In Somalia, in \r\nclose collaboration with the East African Community, \r\nthe African Union and the United Nations, IGAD has \r\nbeen the lynchpin in the effort to assist the people of \r\nSomalia in achieving peace, stability and national \r\nreconciliation. Now, with the extremists and \r\nAl-Shabaab having been driven out of Mogadishu and \r\nthe tide turning against them, there is new hope in \r\nSomalia, which should be sustained. The Kampala \r\nAccord laid the basis for a breakthrough in Somalia, \r\nfor which we owe gratitude to President Yoweri \r\nMuseveni and Ambassador Mahiga, Special \r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General. \r\n Let me take this opportunity to pay tribute to \r\nUganda and Burundi for the sacrifices that they have \r\nmade, and continue to make, as the two countries that \r\nspearheaded the efforts of the African Union Mission \r\nand the Transitional Federal Government of Somalia to \r\nkeep those such as Al-Shabaab and their supporters at \r\nbay. It must be underlined that it is a fight that has \r\nhumanitarian and development implications, not only \r\nsecurity or political. That is why the successful \r\ncooperation of the IGAD countries for stability and \r\nsecurity in the Horn of Africa, and in the fight against \r\nterrorism and extremism, has been so vital. It requires \r\nthe wholehearted support of the international \r\ncommunity, the General Assembly and, most \r\nparticularly, the Security Council. \r\n I need not go into the details of what the IGAD \r\ncountries have requested of the Security Council in \r\nterms of support for them to succeed in the effort that \r\nthey are making for peace in Somalia and to contain \r\nthose who not only encourage, but also take part in \r\ncarrying out terrorism. It is particularly vital for the \r\nCouncil to act on the conclusions and \r\nrecommendations of a body established by the Council \r\nitself. Sweet talk, devoid of any behavioural change in \r\npractice and on the ground, should not lead the \r\nSecurity Council to wish away concrete evidence \r\npresented to it by a committee of its own creation. \r\n Let us admit that there are double standards in the \r\nfight against terrorism. Our counter-terrorism effort \r\ncannot succeed if we are selective in that struggle. The \r\nPrime Minister of India could not have been more \r\ncorrect when he said from this rostrum last Saturday:  \r\n “There cannot be selective approaches in dealing \r\nwith terrorist groups or the infrastructure of \r\nterrorism. Terrorism has to be fought across all \r\nfronts.” (A/66/PV.22) \r\n We in Ethiopia have never had a short-sighted \r\nperspective on what we need to do to ensure that our \r\nnational interest and our national security are \r\nprotected. In this day and age, it is only through \r\ncollective effort that we can ensure peace, security and \r\nstability. Some might imagine that they would benefit \r\nA/66/PV.25  \r\n \r\n11-51384 38 \r\n \r\nby encouraging discord in their neighbourhood. The \r\nHorn of Africa has suffered because of policies \r\nemanating from that kind of mindset for too long. That \r\nshould be combated. We seek the support of all fair-\r\nminded people in that endeavour.  \r\n For our part, we have been guided by the \r\nobjective of protecting and defending the collective \r\nsecurity interest of the people of our region. That has \r\nguided our policy in the Sudan and in the effort that we \r\nhave been making to nurture mutual confidence \r\nbetween us and both the Republic of Sudan and the \r\nnew nation of South Sudan. We have also followed that \r\nsignpost in conducting our policy with respect to \r\nSomalia. \r\n Ethiopia is not a newcomer to international \r\ndiplomacy. As a founding member of the United \r\nNations, we take our responsibility as members of the \r\nhuman family seriously. We view our vocation to be a \r\nfactor for strengthening international peace and \r\nsecurity and for enhancing friendly relations among \r\nnations, large or small, on the basis of full equality. \r\nThat is why, as we continue to call for the reform of \r\nthe Security Council, we also remain committed to the \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly, the true \r\nrepresentative of the people of the world in the true \r\nspirit of the United Nations Charter, whose very first \r\nphrase is: “We the peoples of the United Nations”. \r\n In that same spirit, Ethiopia wants to express its \r\nposition on the historic turning point that the people of \r\nPalestine and the people of Israel are passing through \r\nand the challenges that they are facing. We are \r\nconvinced that no great wisdom is required to realize \r\nthat, at the end of the day, it is only through peaceful \r\nnegotiation and mutual accommodation that the two \r\nparties can reach the final destination.  \r\n In that regard, it is not enough that the right of \r\nthe Palestinians to a viable State of their own be \r\nacknowledged and be paid lip service. It is also \r\nnecessary that real, tangible and practical steps be \r\ntaken, and in good time, towards the realization of that \r\nobjective. That has not been done. No doubt, that is \r\npartly the explanation for where we are today and at \r\nthis moment. On the other hand, while it is self-\r\ndefeating, and also unjust, to use it as a pretext for \r\ndelaying the realization of the dreams of the people of \r\nPalestine, nonetheless, it is neither proper nor realistic \r\nto underestimate and belittle the security concerns of \r\nIsrael.  \r\n When the time comes for us to pronounce \r\nourselves on this signature issue of the sixty-sixth \r\nsession of the Assembly, the position we take will be \r\nbased on our objective assessment of all dimensions of \r\nthe issue in good faith and in line with what we believe \r\nis dictated by the cause of justice and sustainable \r\npeace. \r\n We are passing through a period not only of \r\nuncertainty, but also of great historic and momentous \r\nchange. The world that emerged from the Second \r\nWorld War is almost no more. Periods such as this need \r\nto be handled delicately. That is why it is so critical \r\nthat more attention be paid to the need for preventing \r\nconflicts and for mediation. We are pleased that the \r\nPresident Al-Nasser has made this one of his top \r\npriorities. We want to assure him that he can expect the \r\nfull cooperation of the IGAD countries.  \r\n Let me conclude by asking for the support of all \r\nMember States for the draft resolution that the IGAD \r\ncountries will be submitting requesting observer status \r\nfor IGAD at the United Nations. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Thongloun Sisoulith, \r\nDeputy Primer Minister and Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs and Trade of the Lao People’s Democratic \r\nRepublic.  \r\n Mr. Sisoulith (spoke in Lao; English \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): The \r\nreappointment of Mr. Ban Ki-moon as Secretary-\r\nGeneral is testimony to his able leadership and great \r\nachievements in guiding the universal Organization \r\nover the past five years. I take this opportunity once \r\nagain, on behalf of the Lao Government and people, to \r\nexpress to him my sincere congratulations and to wish \r\nhim great success in the discharge of his noble duty, \r\nespecially as we seek to overcome ongoing multiple \r\ncrises and challenges. \r\n In the same vein, the Lao People’s Democratic \r\nRepublic is pleased to work closely with all the States \r\nMembers of the United Nations at this sixty-sixth \r\nsession of the General Assembly under the presidency \r\nof Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, a veteran diplomat \r\nwith extensive experience in international affairs and \r\ndiplomacy. I also commend Mr. Joseph Deiss on his \r\nsuccess as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-fifth session. \r\n A/66/PV.25\r\n \r\n39 11-51384 \r\n \r\n Like other delegations, I welcome South Sudan as \r\nthe 193rd Member of the United Nations. \r\n The Government of the Lao People’s Democratic \r\nRepublic has always stood firm in upholding the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes and in preserving \r\ninternational peace and security in view of creating an \r\nenvironment conducive to the promotion of \r\ndevelopment cooperation. In this connection, in recent \r\ndecades the Lao Government has continued to pursue a \r\nconsistent foreign policy of peace, independence, \r\nfriendship and cooperation aimed at ensuring tangible \r\nbenefits for the Lao people, thus contributing to \r\nmaintaining regional and international peace and \r\nsecurity. This policy direction was reaffirmed at the \r\nNinth Congress of the Lao People’s Revolutionary \r\nParty held in March. By pursuing this policy in \r\nresponse to external challenges, over the past decades \r\nthe Lao People’s Democratic Republic has firmly \r\nupheld and maintained political stability and social \r\norder, thereby laying a solid foundation for continued \r\neconomic development and social progress. As a result, \r\nwe have achieved considerable progress in social \r\nadvancement and poverty reduction.   \r\n For the next five years, the Government has \r\nidentified immediate and medium-term targets to \r\naccelerate economic development in all aspects so as to \r\nbuild a strong basis for the implementation of the \r\nnational strategy to transform the country into an \r\nindustrialized and modernized nation and achieve the \r\nultimate goal for graduating from least developed \r\ncountry status by 2020. \r\n In this globalizing and integrated world, all \r\nnations big and small, rich and poor, have become \r\nmore interdependent than ever. None of us can survive \r\nin isolation from the international community. \r\nAlthough the Lao People’s Democratic Republic has in \r\nthe past recorded satisfactory achievements in its \r\nnational socio-economic development endeavour, the \r\ncountry will continue to confront daunting challenges. \r\nAs a small, least developed nation, the country has \r\nbeen vulnerable to external shocks. Therefore, it shares \r\nwith other countries the desire to reside in a peaceful \r\nand secured world.  \r\n That being said, all nations must continue to \r\nenhance development cooperation, to ensure tangible \r\nbenefits for their peoples based on mutual respect, \r\nsolidarity, understanding and assistance, and avoid the \r\nuse of threat, interference and force. Nevertheless, it is \r\nunfortunate that we have faced multiple challenges \r\nover the past year caused by regional conflicts, and \r\nspreading social unrest, coupled with financial and \r\neconomic crisis and devastating natural disasters, \r\nwhich have become more frequent. All this has posed \r\nsevere threats to global peace, stability, security and \r\ndevelopment cooperation.  \r\n Against this backdrop, these multiple challenges \r\nare not only obstructing developing countries, the least \r\ndeveloped in particular, in pursuing their national \r\ndevelopment efforts and achieving the international \r\ndevelopment goals, but are also further reversing \r\ndevelopment. \r\n In such circumstances, we believe that the United \r\nNations, as the only universal Organization, should \r\nfurther enhance its role in order to address the \r\nchallenges in a more timely and just manner in \r\nresponse to the common aspirations of all Member \r\nStates. Towards this end, we must accelerate the United \r\nNations reform process, which has been pending for \r\nyears, to achieve a more concrete outcome. It is more \r\ncritical than ever for all Member States to enhance our \r\ncooperation in a sincere and trustworthy manner, \r\nwithout taking advantage of one another, in the effort \r\nto reform the United Nations bodies and improve their \r\neffectiveness. \r\n Security and political stability remain critical to \r\nadvancing the socio-economic development of all \r\nregions. The United Nations should therefore play a \r\nmore critical role in maintaining international peace \r\nand security by effectively carrying out its duty to \r\naddress regional conflicts, especially with regard to the \r\nsituation in the Middle East, which has gone \r\nunresolved for decades. Against this backdrop, the \r\nUnited Nations should play a more effective \r\nfacilitating role in urging all parties concerned to find a \r\nsolution and realize the vision of two States, Israel and \r\nPalestine, living side by side in peace and security and \r\nwithin internationally recognized borders, as stipulated \r\nin the relevant resolutions of the Security Council. In \r\nthis regard, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic \r\nsupports Palestine’s application on 23 September for \r\nfull membership in the United Nations. \r\n Another important concern remains the issue of \r\nthe economic, trade and financial embargo imposed on \r\nCuba for several decades, which has seriously affected \r\nthe Cuban people. We believe that it is now time for \r\nthat embargo to be lifted unconditionally. \r\nA/66/PV.25  \r\n \r\n11-51384 40 \r\n \r\n Peace and security in South-East Asia have \r\ncontributed to creating an environment conducive to \r\nthe socio-economic advancement of the member \r\ncountries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \r\n(ASEAN). At present, ASEAN is continuing its efforts \r\nto accelerate community-building by 2015 based on \r\nthree pillars: the ASEAN Political-Security \r\nCommunity, the ASEAN Economic Community and \r\nthe ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community. Indeed, we \r\nhave made steady progress in our common endeavour.  \r\n In its community-building efforts, ASEAN aims \r\nto implement free trade areas among its 10 member \r\ncountries, as well as between ASEAN and its dialogue \r\npartners. In the same vein, our organization has further \r\nstrengthened its external cooperation by maintaining \r\nASEAN centrality in all ASEAN-initiated frameworks, \r\nsuch as ASEAN+1, ASEAN+3, the ASEAN Regional \r\nForum, the ASEAN Defense Ministers’ Meeting-Plus \r\nand the East Asia Summit. In addition, ASEAN has \r\nstarted to discuss its long-term vision and role beyond \r\nthe year 2015. All of this has contributed to \r\nmaintaining peace, stability and development \r\ncooperation in the Asia-Pacific Region and in the \r\nworld at large. \r\n The Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) is another \r\nimportant mechanism for facilitating international \r\ncooperation. Over the past 15 years, ASEM has \r\ndeveloped remarkably and become an important forum \r\nfor leaders to consider measures to respond to \r\nemerging regional and global challenges. In that \r\ncontext, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic is \r\nhonoured that ASEAN member countries have \r\nentrusted it with hosting the ninth ASEM Summit, to \r\nbe held early in November 2012 in Vientiane, its \r\ncapital. The Lao Government has made the \r\npreparations for the Summit a top priority. In that \r\nregard, I take this opportunity to invite the leaders of \r\nASEM member countries to attend the Summit. It will \r\nprovide an excellent opportunity for leaders from the \r\ntwo regions to discuss important issues related to \r\npromoting peace and enhancing effective cooperation \r\namong the countries of Asia and Europe in this new \r\nera. \r\n Socio-economic development in a country that \r\nhas suffered the consequences and legacy of war has \r\nnever been easy. One of the main obstacles and \r\nhindrances to our efforts to advance socio-economic \r\ndevelopment is unexploded ordnance, which continues \r\nto have an extensive and serious negative impact on the \r\nlivelihoods of the Lao people, both directly and \r\nindirectly. The Lao Government has made every effort \r\nand mobilized financial means to clear the \r\ncontaminated areas, particularly agricultural and \r\ninhabitable lands across the country, as well as to raise \r\npublic awareness and help victims to reintegrate into \r\nsociety.  \r\n In discharging its duties as President of the First \r\nMeeting of States Parties to the Conference on Cluster \r\nMunitions, over the past year the Lao People’s \r\nDemocratic Republic has received invaluable support \r\nand assistance from the international community, \r\nincluding States parties and non-State parties, \r\ninternational organizations, in particular the United \r\nNations Development Programme, civil society \r\norganizations and international non-governmental \r\norganizations. All have contributed to the early \r\nimplementation of this humanitarian Convention.  \r\n On that note, on behalf of the Lao Government \r\nand people, as well as on my own behalf, I would like \r\nto express my most sincere appreciation to all countries \r\nand international organizations for their support and \r\nassistance. These were clearly reflected in the broad \r\nparticipation in the First Meeting of States Parties, \r\nwhich was hosted by the Lao People’s Democratic \r\nRepublic in November 2010. Furthermore, I would like \r\nto congratulate those countries that have ratified or \r\nacceded to the Convention. The number of States \r\nparties to the Convention has now increased to 63. I \r\nhope that other countries that are not yet States parties \r\nwill consider acceding to it in the near future. \r\n Mr. Alotaibi (Kuwait), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n It is more crucial than ever that the international \r\ncommunity seize the opportunity to fulfil its obligation \r\nto promote and enhance cooperation as a means of \r\naddressing pressing challenges, which no country can \r\ndo on its own. Against that backdrop, the Lao People’s \r\nDemocratic Republic reaffirms its consistent \r\ndetermination to work closely with the international \r\ncommunity, thereby helping to make this world a \r\npeaceful, equal and just place, free of fear and \r\ndeprivation. I am convinced that close cooperation and \r\nmutual assistance will enable us all to achieve our \r\ncommon goals. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Yang Jiechi, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the People’s Republic of China. \r\n A/66/PV.25\r\n \r\n41 11-51384 \r\n \r\n Mr. Yang Jiechi (China) (spoke in Chinese): I \r\nwish to begin by congratulating Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz \r\nAl-Nasser on having assumed the presidency of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its current session. I am confident \r\nthat, with his outstanding ability and great experience, \r\nhe will fulfil his lofty mission. I also wish to thank \r\nMr. Deiss for his contribution as President at the \r\nprevious session. I further wish to take this opportunity \r\nto warmly congratulate the Republic of South Sudan on \r\nbecoming the 193rd member of the United Nations \r\nfamily.  \r\n The first decade of the twenty-first century is \r\nnow behind us. During that decade, the trend towards a \r\nmultipolar world and economic globalization gained \r\nmomentum. Countries became increasingly \r\ninterdependent. Revolutions in science and technology \r\nbrought profound transformations to human society. \r\nHowever, various traditional and non-traditional \r\nsecurity threats and global challenges were intertwined \r\nwith those changes, and the world was far from a \r\npeaceful place.  \r\n As the second decade of the new century begins, \r\nthe world has entered an extraordinary historical stage \r\nin its pursuit of peace and development, and continues \r\nto undergo profound and complex changes. Uncertainty \r\nand instability are increasing despite the generally \r\npeaceful international environment. Development is \r\nbecoming an increasingly serious issue, and promoting \r\ncommon development has become a more important \r\nand pressing task than ever before. \r\n Global development is now at a new critical \r\njuncture. Global recovery remains fragile, international \r\nfinancial markets are volatile and the pursuit of \r\nsustainable development faces daunting challenges. \r\nThe world economy therefore has to meet the crucial \r\ntest of maintaining growth. Some countries in West \r\nAsia and North Africa are in continual political \r\nturmoil. Terrorist threats are spreading and global \r\nchallenges growing. The international community faces \r\na critical test in maintaining stability.  \r\n The gap in development between the South and \r\nthe North is as wide as ever. The number of people \r\nliving in absolute poverty has increased by 64 million \r\nowing to the international financial crisis. Nearly \r\n1 billion people suffer from starvation. Urgent action is \r\nneeded to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. \r\nIt is imperative to step up international cooperation to \r\nhelp the least developed countries (LDCs) meet the \r\nbasic needs of their people. In the face of these \r\nchallenges, we share an important mission to achieve \r\ncommon development, and we also have rare new \r\nopportunities.  \r\n Economic globalization has made the interests of \r\ncountries more closely interconnected. Ensuring \r\nsecurity through cooperation and promoting \r\ndevelopment through stability has become our shared \r\ndesire. Countries are addressing development \r\nchallenges in innovative ways. To overcome the crisis, \r\ndeveloped countries have taken steps to improve their \r\nfiscal conditions, adopted stimulus measures and \r\naccelerated economic structural adjustment. \r\nDeveloping countries as a whole have maintained good \r\ngrowth momentum. In particular, the rapid growth in \r\nsome emerging economies has driven the growth of the \r\nworld economy.  \r\n Progress has been made in the reform of the \r\nglobal economic governance structure, and various \r\nregional cooperation mechanisms are expanding. \r\nEfforts to accelerate the development of a green \r\neconomy and explore new modes of sustainable growth \r\nhave created new momentum and space for common \r\ndevelopment. Faced with new opportunities and \r\nchallenges, we should work as a team to overcome our \r\ndifficulties and pursue mutual benefit and common \r\ndevelopment. This is the responsibility and mission \r\nthat history bestows upon all of us. To fulfil our \r\nmission, we need to take the following steps.  \r\n We should foster sound momentum for global \r\neconomic recovery. The underlying impact of the \r\ninternational financial crisis has yet to dissipate, and \r\neconomic recovery is still fragile and uneven. We \r\nshould intensify consultation and coordination, and \r\nsend a strong message of solidarity and win-win \r\ncooperation so as to strengthen international \r\nconfidence in global recovery and growth. We should \r\nwork for a fair, just, inclusive and orderly international \r\nmonetary and financial system, and promote the voice \r\nand representation of emerging markets and developing \r\ncountries.  \r\n China supports the transition of the Group of \r\n20 (G-20) from a short-term crisis response mechanism \r\nto a long-term mechanism of economic governance. \r\nThe G-20 should play a bigger role in global economic \r\ngovernance and in promoting the full recovery and \r\ngrowth of the world economy.  \r\nA/66/PV.25  \r\n \r\n11-51384 42 \r\n \r\n We support the efforts of emerging markets to \r\nexplore new modes of international economic \r\ncooperation. We strongly oppose protectionism in all \r\nits forms and call for strengthening the multilateral \r\ntrading regime. The concerns of the least developed \r\ncountries should be addressed, and efforts made to \r\nmake the Doha Round achieve its development \r\nobjectives. \r\n We should lay the political foundation for \r\ncooperative development. All countries, big or small, \r\nstrong or weak, rich or poor, are equal members of the \r\ninternational community, and their equal right to \r\ndevelopment should be protected. Mutual respect and \r\nequality are the basic norms governing international \r\nrelations and constitute an important guarantee for \r\ncommon development. In the current context, it is of \r\nparticular and practical importance to adhere to the \r\npurposes and principles of the Charter of the United \r\nNations, to uphold the authority and role of the United \r\nNations, to observe in good faith the principle of \r\nnon-interference in each other’s internal affairs, and to \r\npromote democracy in international relations.  \r\n We should respect the sovereignty and territorial \r\nintegrity of all countries. The internal affairs of each \r\ncountry should be decided by its own people. We \r\noppose interference in other countries’ internal affairs \r\nby whatever means and under whatever pretext.  \r\n The diversity of the world is a valuable asset for \r\nthe development of human society. It should be seen as \r\na positive factor that allows countries to learn from one \r\nanother, and should not be used as an excuse for the \r\nbig to bully the small or the rich to ride roughshod over \r\nthe poor in international relations. We should respect \r\nthe right of each country to pursue the development \r\npath of its choice and we should respect the diversity \r\nof civilizations. We should seek common progress by \r\ndrawing on one another’s strength with an open and \r\ninclusive mind, pursuing common ground while \r\npreserving differences. \r\n We should foster a security environment \r\nconducive to stability and development. History has \r\nrepeatedly shown that stability and development go \r\nhand in hand. Without stability, there can be no \r\ndevelopment; without development, there can be no \r\nstability. In keeping with the purposes and principles of \r\nthe United Nations Charter, we should always use \r\npeaceful means to settle international disputes and \r\nhotspot issues. We should oppose the wilful use or \r\nthreat of force, terrorism, separatism and extremism in \r\nall their forms, and we should uphold the common \r\nsecurity of humankind. \r\n China respects the independent choice of the \r\npeople of the Sudan and South Sudan, and hopes that \r\nthe new-born country of South Sudan will enjoy \r\nstability and development. The international \r\ncommunity should continue to support and encourage \r\nthe Sudan and South Sudan to resolve their outstanding \r\nissues appropriately through dialogue and consultation, \r\npursue amicable relations and common development, \r\nand uphold regional peace and stability. China has \r\nencouraged the Sudan and South Sudan to resolve their \r\ndispute through peaceful negotiation and has worked \r\nhard to advance the peace process between them. We \r\nsupport the proper settlement of the Darfur issue. We \r\nwill continue to work with the international community \r\nto play a constructive role in advancing regional peace, \r\nstability and development. \r\n China has consistently supported the just cause of \r\nestablishing an independent Palestinian State, and \r\nsupports Palestine’s membership in the United Nations. \r\nWe support efforts to achieve a two-State solution \r\nthrough political negotiation so as to establish, on the \r\nbasis of the 1967 borders, an independent Palestinian \r\nState that enjoys full sovereignty, with East Jerusalem \r\nas its capital. We believe that progress should be made \r\nin parallel in the peace talks between Syria and Israel \r\nand Lebanon and Israel, with an ultimate view to \r\nachieving a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in \r\nthe Middle East along with peaceful coexistence \r\nbetween the Arab countries and Israel. We hope that \r\nthe international community and the parties concerned \r\nwill make unremitting efforts to this end and sustain \r\nthe Middle East peace process. \r\n China is greatly concerned about the turbulence \r\nin West Asia and North Africa. We stand for the \r\nprinciple of non-interference. We respect and support \r\nthe efforts of countries in those regions to \r\nindependently handle their internal affairs, and we \r\nrespect their aspirations. We hope that the parties \r\nconcerned will resolve their differences through \r\npolitical dialogue and speedily restore stability and \r\norder in their respective countries.  \r\n Libya has now entered a critical transition from a \r\nstate of war and turmoil to national reconstruction. \r\nChina respects the choice of the Libyan people and \r\nrecognizes the National Transitional Council (NTC) as \r\n A/66/PV.25\r\n \r\n43 11-51384 \r\n \r\nthe governing authority of Libya and the representative \r\nof its people. We hope that, under the leadership of the \r\nNTC, the parties in Libya will launch an inclusive \r\nprocess of political transition through which they will \r\nmaintain ethnic harmony and national unity, restore \r\nstability as soon as possible and begin economic \r\nreconstruction. China supports the leading role of the \r\nUnited Nations in Libya’s post-conflict reconstruction, \r\nand urges the speediest possible operationalization of \r\nthe United Nations Support Mission in Libya.  \r\n China is also greatly concerned about \r\ndevelopments in Syria. We hope that parties in Syria \r\nwill exercise restraint, avoid all violence, further \r\nbloodshed and conflict, and act quickly to ease \r\ntensions. We believe that a Syria-led, inclusive political \r\nprocess aimed at promoting reform through dialogue \r\nand consultation is the right way to resolve the current \r\ncrisis in Syria. The international community should \r\nrespect the sovereignty, independence and territorial \r\nintegrity of Syria, and address the Syrian issue \r\ncautiously so as to prevent further turbulence and \r\nrepercussions on regional peace. \r\n China welcomes the positive developments on the \r\nKorean peninsula. We believe that dialogue and \r\nconsultation are the only effective way to address the \r\nissues of the peninsula. The Six-Party Talks are an \r\neffective mechanism for advancing the denuclearization \r\nof the Korean peninsula and for upholding peace and \r\nstability both on the peninsula and in North-East Asia.  \r\n China has worked hard to promote peace through \r\ndialogue, and has played a unique role in easing \r\ntensions and maintaining peace and stability on the \r\nKorean peninsula. China welcomes the recent \r\nresumption of dialogue between the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea, \r\nas well as between the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea and the United States. We hope that the \r\nparties concerned will seize the opportunity, remain \r\nengaged in dialogue and work for an early resumption \r\nof the Six-Party Talks. \r\n We should promote balanced development \r\nbetween the South and the North. The uneven \r\ndevelopment between South and North is the biggest \r\nimbalance in the global economy. Without balanced \r\ndevelopment, there can hardly be sustainable \r\ndevelopment. Unless underdeveloped countries shake \r\noff poverty and grow their economies, there can be no \r\ncommon global prosperity.  \r\n Achieving the Millennium Development Goals on \r\na global scale and on schedule is an urgent and arduous \r\ntask. Developed countries should honour their \r\ncommitments on official development assistance, open \r\ntheir markets, reduce and cancel debt, and their step up \r\nfinancial and technological support to developing \r\ncountries. International financial institutions should \r\nuse their resources to help developing countries, and \r\nparticularly the LDCs, on a priority basis. Developing \r\ncountries, on their part, should explore growth models \r\nthat are conducive to development and poverty \r\nalleviation in order to achieve a higher level of \r\ndevelopment. \r\n Food security has emerged as a major challenge. \r\nThe Horn of Africa is suffering from massive famine \r\ntriggered by the most severe drought in 60 years. The \r\ninternational community should scale up assistance, \r\nstabilize the price of food and other commodities, and \r\nhelp developing countries enhance their capacity for \r\nautonomous development so that all countries and \r\nregions can enjoy the benefits of common \r\ndevelopment. \r\n The world witnessed major development, \r\ntransformation and adjustment in the first decade of the \r\ntwenty-first century. During this period, China enjoyed \r\nsustained and fast development, and its relations with \r\nthe outside world underwent profound changes. \r\nChina’s achievements in development, and its possible \r\nfuture course, have become a focus of international \r\nattention. Over the past 10 years, China’s economy \r\ncontinued to grow, and its people’s living standards \r\nrose markedly, thanks to the hard work of the Chinese \r\npeople. Today, China has become the world’s second-\r\nlargest economy, largest exporter, second-largest \r\nimporter and largest emerging market. The basic living \r\nneeds of China’s 1.3 billion people are being \r\nadequately met, and the number living in absolute \r\npoverty has fallen drastically. \r\n On the other hand, the difficulties China faces in \r\nterms of development should not be ignored. We \r\nremain a developing country with a large population, a \r\nweak economic foundation and serious imbalances and \r\nlack of coordination in our development. China will \r\nhave to make persistent and strenuous efforts to \r\nachieve its development goals. Guided by our recently \r\nadopted twelfth five-year plan for economic and social \r\ndevelopment, we will pursue scientific development, \r\naccelerate the shift in our growth model, advance \r\nscientific and technological innovation and increase \r\nA/66/PV.25  \r\n \r\n11-51384 44 \r\n \r\nreforms and openness designed to promote long-term, \r\nsteady and fast economic development, as well as \r\nsocial harmony and progress. The world will see a \r\nmore open China, with more sustainable development \r\nand greater social harmony. \r\n China’s development has brought real benefits to \r\nthe Chinese people and contributed to global \r\ndevelopment and prosperity. During the past 10 years, \r\nChina imported close to, on average, $750 billion \r\nworth of goods annually, creating more than 14 million \r\njobs for the relevant countries and regions. At the end \r\nof the twelfth five-year period in 2015, China’s total \r\neconomic output will be around $8.6 trillion. It is \r\nexpected that China will import about $10 trillion in \r\ngoods in the next five years, which will further boost \r\nworld economic growth. China needs the world in \r\norder to be able to continue to develop, and China’s \r\ndevelopment will in turn contribute more to the shared \r\ndevelopment of the world as a whole. \r\n As a developing country, China is committed to \r\nenhancing mutually beneficial cooperation with other \r\ndeveloping countries, based on equality, and to \r\nenhancing its efforts to provide them with assistance \r\nand support. China has cancelled 380 debts incurred by \r\n50 heavily indebted poor countries and LDCs, and will \r\nphase in zero-tariff treatment for 95 per cent of exports \r\nfrom the African LDCs with which China has \r\ndiplomatic relations. We have completed more than \r\n2,100 projects, including building schools and \r\nhospitals, in other developing countries, and trained \r\n150,000 professionals in various fields for them. In \r\nsympathy with the pain of the countries and people in \r\nthe Horn of Africa hit by famine, China has decided to \r\nprovide those countries with RMB443.2 million in \r\nemergency food assistance and cash for purchasing \r\nfood to help them overcome the famine. \r\n China has made notable efforts to achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. As it continues to \r\ndevelop, China will create more opportunities for \r\nworld peace, development and cooperation. To advance \r\ncommon development, we must foster a sound \r\ninternational environment. Over the years, China has \r\nbeen dedicated to creating a peaceful international \r\nenvironment in which it can develop. At the same time, \r\nit has contributed to enhancing world peace through its \r\nown development. China has actively assumed \r\ninternational responsibilities as its capacity permits, \r\nand has worked to promote the peaceful settlement of \r\nissues in troubled areas.  \r\n China participates actively in international \r\npeacekeeping operations; with a total of more than \r\n19,000 personnel deployed in 28 United Nations \r\npeacekeeping missions, China is the largest contributor \r\nof United Nations peacekeeping personnel among \r\nSecurity Council permanent members. China has \r\nprovided assistance in cash and kind to countries hit by \r\nearthquakes and tsunamis, and has sent rescue teams to \r\ncarry out humanitarian relief operations in the affected \r\nareas. China is actively involved in the fight against \r\npiracy and in other areas of international cooperation. \r\nAll these efforts have contributed to maintaining world \r\npeace and stability. \r\n The tide of history is surging forward. In the next \r\ndecade, peace, development and cooperation will \r\nremain trends of the times, and China will not waver in \r\nits pursuit of development and progress. Peaceful \r\ndevelopment is the strategic choice that China has \r\nmade to build a modern, strong and prosperous country \r\nand to make a greater contribution to the progress of \r\nhuman civilization. China will stay on that path, \r\npursuing an independent, peaceful foreign policy and a \r\nwin-win strategy of opening up its society. \r\n We are committed to achieving a better life for \r\nthe Chinese people and greater development and \r\nprosperity for all humankind. We will achieve those \r\ngoals through hard work, reforms and innovation, and \r\nby conducting long-term friendly exchanges and \r\nestablishing equality-based, win-win cooperation with \r\nother countries. A prosperous, harmonious and stable \r\nChina that lives up to its responsibilities will make a \r\ngreater contribution to the prosperity and stability of \r\nthe world and the common development of humankind. \r\nLet us work together to deepen cooperation and \r\nachieve development by sharing opportunities and \r\nmeeting challenges together, and thus build a \r\nharmonious world of lasting peace and common \r\nprosperity. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Taïb Fassi Fihri, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of the Kingdom of \r\nMorocco. \r\n Mr. Fassi Fihri (Morocco) (spoke in Arabic): It \r\nis a great pleasure for me to extend to Mr. Al-Nasser \r\nmy sincere congratulations on his election as President \r\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. His \r\nelection reflects the esteem enjoyed by the brotherly \r\nState of Qatar and the Arab world as a whole. We are \r\n A/66/PV.25\r\n \r\n45 11-51384 \r\n \r\nconfident that his rich diplomatic experience will \r\nensure a successful session. I also take this opportunity \r\nto pay tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Joseph Deiss, for \r\nhis successful efforts throughout his presidency.  \r\n We also reiterate our congratulations to Mr. Ban \r\nKi-moon on his reappointment as Secretary-General. \r\nWe highly value the initiatives undertaken during his \r\nfirst mandate, in particular the establishment of \r\nUN-Women. I also reiterate our strong support for the \r\npriorities set by the Secretary-General for his second \r\nterm.  \r\n This session is taking place in a sensitive \r\ninternational context. The world is facing acute and \r\ncomplex crises, some of which are structural and \r\npersistent, including climate change and the food \r\ncrisis, while others are circumstantial, such as the \r\nunprecedented financial crisis and devastating nuclear \r\naccidents. Yet others, too, have had profound impacts, \r\nsuch as the financial crisis that became a global \r\neconomic crisis with destabilizing social and political \r\nconsequences. A decade after the horrific events of \r\n9/11, there is also the continued threat of international \r\nterrorism with its growing links to transnational \r\norganized crime in all its aspects. In addition, national \r\nand international tensions and armed conflict persist. \r\n Such a critical situation has rarely been witnessed \r\nby the world. We are therefore called upon to reflect \r\nobjectively on the following questions: What type of \r\nUnited Nations do we want in the face of these issues \r\nand challenges? How can we ensure that the United \r\nNations will serve as an influential and efficient legal \r\nand political framework for the collective management \r\nof global affairs? How can we ensure the effectiveness \r\nof the Organization’s bodies and organs in adapting to \r\nthe fast-changing world? And finally, how do we \r\nconfirm the role of the Organization as the principal \r\naxis of a multilateral system based on solidarity and \r\ncoordination with new international groupings of \r\nlimited membership that are endowed with the ability \r\nto promptly respond to new events?  \r\n These questions are not based on an idealistic \r\napproach but emanate from our deep belief in the \r\nhighly important and unique role of the United Nations \r\nas a framework and reference for efficient and just \r\nglobal governance, based on solidarity, and which \r\ndraws its legitimacy from its global membership and \r\nthe capital it has accumulated since its establishment. \r\n To be effective, global governance must serve as \r\nthe natural extension of national, regional and \r\nsubregional governance. All Member States should \r\nshoulder their responsibilities in adopting appropriate \r\nmeasures and actions at the national level so as to lay \r\nthe foundation for and consolidate good governance. \r\n On that basis, the Kingdom of Morocco opted \r\nseveral decades ago to establish a democratic State \r\nbased on good governance, guaranteed individual \r\nfreedoms, the dignity of its citizens and respect for \r\nhuman rights, while upholding the principles of \r\nequality, equal opportunity and social justice, as well \r\nas the struggle against marginalization and social \r\nexclusion. The Kingdom, through the insightful vision \r\nof His Majesty King Mohammed VI, has also based the \r\nestablishment of a democratic and advanced society on \r\ntwo interdependent pillars: strengthened political \r\nreform and the realization of human development. \r\n The recent adoption of the Kingdom’s new \r\nConstitution was an historic landmark in this \r\ndistinctive process and highlighted the cohesion among \r\nall components of the Moroccan nation with its \r\nmultiple branches. It consolidates the principles of the \r\nseparation and balance of powers while preserving the \r\nfull independence of the judiciary and the rule of law. \r\nIt also defines the rights and duties of citizenship and \r\nlays the foundations for political and economic \r\ngovernance through regulatory, mediation, \r\nrepresentation and accountability institutions. It also \r\nstrengthens women’s participation in politics and social \r\nand economic development. In that context, broad \r\nregionalization enjoys a central role in the innovative \r\nconstitutional architecture. It serves as the backbone of \r\ncommunity democracy aimed at achieving \r\ndevelopment based on balance and solidarity among all \r\nregions of the Kingdom. \r\n The Arab world is witnessing profound events \r\nand transformations that, on the one hand, highlight \r\nlegitimate aspirations to freedom, dignity, progress and \r\nuniversal values that are shared by all regions, cultures \r\nand religions. Those events also show, on the other \r\nhand, that social and economic development cannot be \r\nachieved without political transparency and the \r\nevolution of democracy for the benefit of individuals \r\nand communities. There can be neither progress nor \r\nstability in the context of political stagnation, \r\nideological closure, the erosion of legitimacy and the \r\nabsence of any renewed or peaceful transfer of political \r\npower. \r\nA/66/PV.25  \r\n \r\n11-51384 46 \r\n \r\n Lastly, those events have also shown that each \r\nArab country has the capacity to build a political \r\nsystem that reconciles universal values and national \r\nspecificities, and that combines necessary openness \r\nand the preservation of cultural and civilizational \r\nidentity. In that regard, Morocco welcomes the \r\ninstitutional progress made by Tunisia and Egypt and \r\ncalls on the international community to support the \r\nefforts of those two brotherly peoples on the complex, \r\npromising and sensitive path of democratic transition. \r\n Morocco also expresses welcomes the delegation \r\nof the National Transitional Council of the new Libya, \r\nwhich aspires to a better future based on transparency, \r\nreconciliation and consolidation of the rule of law. In \r\nlight of the solidarity and brotherly links between the \r\npeoples of Morocco and Libya, Morocco has from the \r\nvery beginning supported the legitimate aspirations of \r\nthe Libyan people and the actions of the National \r\nTransitional Council at the national and international \r\nlevels. \r\n Morocco is also confident that Libya will regain \r\nits natural international position within the Maghreb \r\ncountries. Moreover, Morocco hopes to see concerted \r\nArab action to prevent further bloodshed and guarantee \r\npeaceful resolution of the crises in brotherly Syria and \r\nYemen through the announced profound, substantive \r\nreforms and based on territorial integrity and ensured \r\nstability. \r\n Those aspirations and changes reflect the free \r\nwill of the peoples and require the effective and serious \r\nsupport of their Arab brothers and partners, in full \r\nrespect for their national specificities, while taking into \r\naccount each country’s progress in the democratization \r\nprocess. In that context, Morocco highly appreciates \r\nthe Group of Eight’s response through the Deauville \r\npartnership.  \r\n Morocco believes that, in addition to its financial \r\nsupport, that promising partnership will act as an \r\nincentive by encouraging the five Arab beneficiary \r\ncountries to rely on their own capacities to enhance \r\neconomic integration, on the one hand, and to share \r\ngood experiences and best practices in the field of \r\ndemocratization and constitutional reforms, on the \r\nother. Morocco is willing to work with its brothers in \r\nthis framework based on the progress it has made in \r\npolitical openness and its experience in the field of \r\ndemocratic transition and distinctive constitutional \r\nreform.  \r\n The events and challenges in the Arab world also \r\nhighlight the need for renewed regional governance \r\nbased on the effective integration of harmonious and \r\ncoordinated groupings, such as the Maghreb Arab \r\nUnion, the Gulf Cooperation Council and the Agadir \r\nAgreement for the Establishment of a Free Trade Zone \r\nbetween the Arabic Mediterranean Nations. The latter \r\ncould be enlarged to include other Arab and \r\nMediterranean countries and could extend its activities \r\nto areas of democratic reform and political dialogue. \r\nThis new governance seeks, under the aegis of the Arab \r\nLeague, to create a new regional Arab order with \r\ninnovative mechanisms and renewed foundations, to \r\nserve human development, economic integration and \r\ndemocratic openness, and to prevent conflicts and the \r\ndanger of separatism. \r\n It is clear that a final settlement to the Palestinian \r\nissue is a necessary factor in accelerating the pace of \r\nthe ongoing Arab endeavour in the interests of all \r\npeoples of the region. The question of Palestine is \r\ntoday at a historical turning point. It is characterized by \r\nthe absence of any prospect of negotiation, the ongoing \r\nsettlement programmes, and the Israeli policy of \r\ndetention, annexation, destruction and displacement, \r\nparticularly in Jerusalem, as well as collective \r\npunishment and the disproportionate use of force \r\nagainst civilians, as reported by the United Nations in \r\nthe report on the freedom flotilla. \r\n Due to the rejection by the Israeli Government of \r\nconstructive international initiatives and proposals by \r\nthe sponsors of the peace process, the situation has \r\ndeteriorated, and prospects have faded for the relaunch \r\nof a serious and genuine negotiating process on the \r\nfinal settlement, in step with reciprocal commitments. \r\nIt is time for the United Nations, through its various \r\norgans and using all available mechanisms, to shoulder \r\nits full responsibility by enabling the Palestinian \r\npeople, under the leadership of its National Authority, \r\nto achieve all its legitimate national rights, in harmony \r\nwith efforts to strengthen the foundation of an \r\nindependent Palestinian State and taking into account \r\nthe momentum of international support and \r\nrecognition.  \r\n Morocco has always been the first to defend the \r\nchoice of peace and the brotherly Palestinian people in \r\nits struggle, and today it cautions against the stalemate \r\nin the peace process, its underlying dangers and the \r\nprevalence of the logic of force. It reiterates its support \r\nfor the request of the Palestinian Authority, in the \r\n A/66/PV.25\r\n \r\n47 11-51384 \r\n \r\nperson of President Mahmoud Abbas, for Palestine to \r\nbecome a full Member of the United Nations as a \r\nsovereign State on the basis of the 1967 borders, with \r\nEast Jerusalem as its capital. Morocco, under the \r\nleadership of His Majesty King Mohammed VI, \r\nChairman of the Al-Quds Committee of the \r\nOrganization of Islamic Cooperation, will spare no \r\neffort in contributing to all constructive initiatives and \r\nsupporting all actions towards the realization of that \r\ngoal as soon as possible.  \r\n Moreover, our collective goal should be the \r\nrevival of the peace process on the basis of clear terms \r\nof reference, a comprehensive agenda, a precise time \r\nframe, an innovative negotiating methodology, and the \r\neffective and strong involvement of the Quartet. In that \r\nregard, the Kingdom of Morocco welcomes the \r\npositive signals in the recent statement made by the \r\nQuartet.  \r\n Consistent with its vision of solidarity and \r\nintegration in the Arab region, Morocco is engaged in \r\nbroad consultations with the members of the Gulf \r\nCooperation Council with a view to establishing an \r\nadvanced and substantive partnership in various \r\nstrategic, political, economic, social, human and \r\nsecurity fields. Morocco, which has strong ties with all \r\nmembers of that important regional group, wishes to \r\nestablish a new model of concrete and distinctive \r\npartnership that would contribute broadly to \r\nsustainable development, stability and the containment \r\nof the threats to the security, territorial integrity and \r\nhigh interests of our countries. In that context, \r\nMorocco reiterates its support for the legitimate rights \r\nof the United Arab Emirates with regard to its three \r\noccupied islands. \r\n Morocco’s Maghreb, Arab, Islamic, \r\nMediterranean and African dimensions, as well as its \r\ncommitment to strengthening South-South cooperation, \r\nas enshrined in its new Constitution, contribute to the \r\ndiversity of the issues on which Moroccan foreign \r\npolicy is based, consistent with its aspirations to \r\nestablish regional governance founded on consultation, \r\ndialogue and solidarity. Recent reforms undertaken in \r\nthe Maghreb countries could give new impetus to \r\nMaghreb integration, consistent with the aspirations of \r\nthe five peoples of the region and their efforts to \r\nachieve development and stability. \r\n In that context, Morocco has worked relentlessly \r\nto activate bilateral relations with brotherly Algeria \r\nthrough ministerial visits, which it hopes will pave the \r\nway towards a comprehensive normalization between \r\nthe two countries, including the reopening of land \r\nborders in accordance with the principle of \r\nconstructive good-neighbourliness.  \r\n Inspired by the same will, Morocco reiterates its \r\nfull commitment to pursuing and intensifying the \r\nnegotiations to find a mutually acceptable political \r\nsolution to the regional dispute over the Moroccan \r\nSahara, on the basis of the Moroccan autonomy \r\ninitiative that the Security Council, through six \r\nsuccessive resolutions, has deemed to be serious and \r\ncredible. This bold and realistic initiative takes into \r\nconsideration, within the framework of the Kingdom’s \r\nterritorial integrity and sovereignty, standards of \r\ninternational legitimacy that go beyond unilateral \r\nrestrictive interpretations that can only aggravate the \r\nstatus quo and lead to deadlock. \r\n Security Council resolution 1979 (2011) renewed \r\nthe emphasis on the fundamental guidelines of the \r\nnegotiating process by calling for all parties to enter \r\ninto substantive and serious negotiations and to show \r\nrealism and a spirit of compromise to reach a midway \r\nsolution, while urging neighbouring countries to fully \r\nengage in the process of negotiations. It is high time \r\nfor each party to shoulder its responsibilities, \r\nparticularly in the light of the events taking place in the \r\nregion, with a view to working seriously and in good \r\nfaith to reach a final political compromise solution to \r\nthis fabricated regional dispute. There is also an urgent \r\nneed to meet the aspirations of our brothers in the \r\ncamps in Tindouf, Algeria, where they are denied their \r\nmost basic human rights and any hope for the future. \r\n From this rostrum, I reiterate the persistent need \r\nto achieve effective Maghreb integration in the context \r\nof the Arab Maghreb Union as an open, complementary \r\nand democratic framework to serve the interests of the \r\npeoples of the five countries — the Greater Maghreb. \r\nSuch integration should contribute in an effective and \r\ninnovative manner to the present dynamic in the Arab \r\nworld. The Arab Maghreb should actively contribute to \r\nEuro-Mediterranean cooperation, in particular in the \r\ncontext of the Union for the Mediterranean, and to \r\ndevelopment and stability in the Sahelo-Saharan \r\nregion. It should be in the position to overcome \r\nterrorist threats and the related dangers of transnational \r\norganized criminal networks. \r\nA/66/PV.25  \r\n \r\n11-51384 48 \r\n \r\n King Mohammed VI made Africa the top priority \r\nof Moroccan foreign policy in October, promoting \r\ncooperation and solidarity in order to meet political, \r\nsocial, economic and security challenges hampering \r\ncomprehensive development in the continent. With the \r\nsame commitment, Morocco has contributed positively \r\nto international and regional efforts to settle several \r\nconflicts, including through its early and ongoing \r\nparticipation in United Nations peacekeeping \r\noperations. In Africa, in particular, Morocco has \r\nactively supported transitional democratic processes in \r\nGuinea, Côte d’Ivoire and Niger, among others.  \r\n Convinced of the need to develop and strengthen \r\na common coordination and negotiation mechanism \r\namong African countries, Morocco has worked in \r\ncooperation with its African brothers to launch the \r\nMinisterial Conference of African Atlantic States with \r\nthe aim of optimizing cooperation opportunities under \r\nthat common mechanism to overcome common \r\nchallenges, in particular those related to security and \r\nenvironment. \r\n There is no doubt that achieving the goal of \r\nsustainable development in developing countries, \r\nparticularly in Africa, remains a daunting challenge, \r\ngiven the persistent gap between international \r\ndevelopment assistance and the heavy debt burden of \r\ndeveloping nations. In that context, we support the \r\nsmall and island countries of the Caribbean Sea and the \r\nPacific and Indian Oceans in their efforts under the \r\nMauritius Strategy.  \r\n With that clear vision and constructive \r\napproaches reflecting the balance between domestic \r\nand foreign policy priorities, the Kingdom of Morocco \r\ncalls on the States members of the General Assembly to \r\nsupport its candidacy for a non-permanent seat in the \r\nSecurity Council for the biennium 2012-2013, in \r\naccordance with the rotation principle of the African \r\nGroup. That bid reflects Morocco’s aspirations to serve \r\npeace and stability, strengthen solidarity and uphold \r\nuniversal ideals. Above all, it serves the goal of \r\nmaintaining international peace and security as a clear \r\nconstitutional commitment of the Kingdom. It \r\nenshrines our more than 50 years of pioneering \r\nexperience, during which more than 50,000 Moroccan \r\npeacekeepers have served in United Nations \r\npeacekeeping operations worldwide.  \r\n In that context, Morocco is participating actively \r\nin the work of the Peacebuilding Commission, which is \r\nan effective instrument to promote international \r\nsolidarity with countries emerging from conflict and \r\nthose starting a peacebuilding and national \r\nreconciliation process. In that spirit and to strengthen \r\nits partners for peace, Morocco is deeply and \r\ntransparently committed to implementing its \r\ninternational obligations on disarmament and the \r\nnon-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. \r\n Its candidacy will support enhanced solidarity \r\namong developing countries through South-South \r\ncooperation and the creation of mechanisms based on a \r\nnew vision that will include humanitarian assistance to \r\nconfront natural disasters and the food crisis, \r\nparticularly in sub-Saharan African countries, as well \r\nas the Caribbean and Pacific island States. Financial \r\nand technical assistance will be provided to the \r\neconomic and social sectors, including agriculture, \r\nhealth care, water and electricity. We currently host \r\nmore than 9,000 students from 42 countries, among \r\nwhom 8,000 have been granted Moroccan scholarships. \r\n Finally, Morocco’s candidacy represents the \r\npromotion of universal values. Thanks to its diversity \r\nand openness, the Kingdom of Morocco has always \r\nserved as a crossroads of civilizations — a land of \r\npeace, tolerance and coexistence among cultures and \r\nreligions. Moreover, given its true commitment to the \r\nuniversal values of human rights, the Kingdom has \r\ntaken several initiatives aimed at strengthening the \r\nculture of human rights. It also played a an important \r\npart in establishing the Human Rights Council review \r\nmechanisms, given its leading role in that United \r\nNations body.  \r\n We are truly confident that the support of the \r\nmembers of the Assembly for the Moroccan candidacy, \r\nwhich represents a specific regional context, will \r\nprovide the Kingdom, during its mandate in the \r\nSecurity Council, with the distinct opportunity to \r\naddress, in a constructive and balanced manner, the \r\nsensitive matters on the Council’s agenda involving \r\nArab and African issues.  \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Guido Westerwelle, Vice-Chancellor \r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs of Germany. \r\n Mr. Westerwelle (Germany) (spoke in German; \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): Seldom has \r\npeople’s yearning for freedom, dignity and self-\r\ndetermination played such a dominant role as it has this \r\nyear. Until now, we have experienced globalization \r\n A/66/PV.25\r\n \r\n49 11-51384 \r\n \r\nfirst and foremost through the ever-greater integration \r\nof the world economy. Today, we see that globalization \r\nmeans so much more; that it has also brought about a \r\nglobalization of values. Those are the values enshrined \r\nin the United Nations Charter, the inalienable rights \r\ncontained in the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights. \r\n In North Africa and in the Arab world, millions of \r\npeople have shaken off the shackles of decades of \r\noppression. They want freedom, democracy and human \r\nrights, as well as better lives for themselves and their \r\nfamilies. That road is anything but easy. A new \r\npolitical system must mature in order to become stable. \r\nThat takes time and patience. However, even the \r\nlongest road begins with the very first step. This is a \r\nyear of momentous steps. \r\n We have not forgotten the moving images of \r\npeople who won dignity and self-respect by their own \r\nefforts, the proud faces on Bourguiba Boulevard in \r\nTunis and in Tahrir Square in Cairo. Those people want \r\nto shape their own future, and their yearning is by no \r\nmeans limited to the Arab world. In Belarus, too, \r\npeople long for an end to repression and tyranny and \r\nfor the opportunity to fully develop their individual \r\npersonalities. \r\n With the fall of the Berlin Wall and reunification \r\nmore than 20 years ago, Germany experienced for \r\nitself the joy of a peaceful revolution. Today we have a \r\nfundamental interest in the success of the political \r\nawakening in the southern Mediterranean region. We \r\nGermans offer our support for the reforms in Morocco \r\nand Jordan, the political awakening in Egypt and \r\nTunisia, and the fresh start in Libya following the \r\noverthrow of the dictator. \r\n Every country and every society will find its own \r\nway into the modern world, either through revolution \r\nor through reform. We want to provide advice and \r\nsupport. We want to help create an independent \r\njudiciary, a pluralistic media landscape, and a vibrant \r\ncivil society. We want to help people come to terms \r\nwith their past and we want to support the \r\nconstitutional process. Above all, however, we want to \r\nassist in the crucial process of building a new social \r\nand economic order, for we all know that the success of \r\nsocial change largely hinges on economic success. \r\nPeople who take to the streets for freedom and self-\r\ndetermination must see first-hand that they, too, can \r\nsucceed with the help of their ideas, their creativity and \r\ntheir commitment. \r\n Germany is therefore working not only for close \r\npartnerships but for increased market access. We want \r\nto foster change through increased trade. We are \r\noffering investments, especially in the small and \r\nmedium-sized enterprises that form the backbone of an \r\nopen and successful society. Most important of all, \r\nhowever, will be to offer young people education and \r\ntraining so that they can make the most of their \r\nopportunities. That is of key importance to successful \r\ntransitions and fresh starts in those countries. \r\n The courageous men and women of Syria deserve \r\na clear sign of our solidarity. The Syrian Government \r\nhas responded to the legitimate demands of the Syrian \r\npeople with brutal force. Germany will continue to \r\npress for a Security Council resolution. This is not only \r\nabout showing solidarity with the Syrian people; it is \r\nalso about the credibility of the international \r\ncommunity. If the repression continues, we Europeans \r\nwill further tighten sanctions against the regime. The \r\nSyrian people should be free to shape their own future. \r\n This week has been dominated by the unresolved \r\nconflict in the Middle East. On Friday here in New \r\nYork, President Abbas expressed the Palestinians’ \r\nexpectations and understandable frustration with the \r\nlack of progress made (see A/66/PV.19). On the same \r\nday, Prime Minister Netanyahu reaffirmed Israel’s \r\njustified desire to exist in peace within secure borders \r\n(see A/66/PV.19). Both sides have legitimate interests. \r\nHowever, these interests are certainly not \r\nirreconcilable. They can be overcome if the parties \r\ninvolved are willing to do so. \r\n Germany is backing a two-State solution. We \r\nsupport a Palestinian State that will allow the \r\nPalestinians to live in dignity and self-determination \r\nand that is independent, sovereign, contiguous and \r\ndemocratic, as well as politically and economically \r\nviable. Over the past few years, we have been heavily \r\ninvolved in the practical development of this statehood \r\nby helping to build an administration, infrastructure \r\nand vocational training, as well as politically, in the \r\nGerman-Palestinian Steering Committee. And we do \r\nnot want that State to be founded sometime in the \r\ndistant and indeterminate future. \r\n Let there be no doubt, however, that the security \r\nof Israel is and will continue to be part of the raison \r\nd’être of the Federal Republic of Germany. Peace \r\nA/66/PV.25  \r\n \r\n11-51384 50 \r\n \r\nbetween Israelis and Palestinians is possible. A \r\nPalestinian State is possible. Two States existing \r\npeacefully side by side are possible. However, they can \r\nbe achieved only through negotiations. The statement \r\nissued by the Middle East Quartet on Friday identified \r\nthe milestones along the way. Germany worked hard \r\nfor that Quartet statement and staunchly supports it. \r\n The confrontation of words here in New York \r\nmust not be allowed to lead to an escalation in violence \r\nin the Middle East. I therefore call on both sides, \r\nPalestinians and Israelis, to enter into direct \r\nnegotiations without delay. On Friday, the two sides \r\nreaffirmed their desire for a negotiated peace. The task \r\nnow is to channel the energy and pressure of recent \r\ndays into a constructive process. The two sides have \r\nbeen called on to come forward within three months \r\nwith comprehensive proposals on territory and security, \r\nand to refrain from all provocative actions. The \r\ninternational community will continue to support the \r\ndifficult road to peace. This includes the Moscow \r\nconference as part of the negotiating timetable for the \r\ncoming months. \r\n I would like to express my appreciation to all \r\nwho have worked so hard in the past few days to create \r\nthis opportunity for a constructive solution. As a \r\nEuropean, I would like to extend my special thanks to \r\nthe European Union’s High Representative, Lady \r\nAshton. Let us make use of the impetus provided by \r\nthe intensive efforts here in New York for the benefit of \r\nthe people of Israel and the Palestinian territories. \r\n The international community has worked \r\ntirelessly for years to ensure that Afghanistan ceases to \r\nharbour a threat to international peace and security. \r\nMany, indeed too many people have already lost their \r\nlives as a result of that threat. On 5 December in Bonn, \r\nunder Afghanistan’s chairmanship, we will discuss the \r\nway forward. The Conference will focus on three major \r\nissues. The first is the complete handover of \r\nresponsibility for security. This summer saw the start \r\nof a process whereby the Afghans are to gradually \r\nassume responsibility for security in their country by \r\n2014. This is a responsible handover of responsibility. \r\n Secondly, the international community will \r\nremain engaged in Afghanistan after 2014. Afghanistan \r\nwill continue to need economic initiatives and more \r\nregional cooperation to help strengthen its sovereignty. \r\nThe New Silk Road initiative, which we launched here \r\nin New York last week, is intended to serve this aim.  \r\n Thirdly, Afghanistan’s internal reconciliation and \r\nsupport from States in the region are critical to lasting \r\npeace. The brutal murder of former President Rabbani \r\nshows that the reconciliation process will continue to \r\nsuffer setbacks. Nevertheless, it must and will go on. \r\nGermany will play its part on the road to Bonn. \r\n While people are seizing the opportunity to build \r\na better future for themselves in freedom and self-\r\ndetermination in a growing number of countries around \r\nthe world, millions in the Horn of Africa are struggling \r\nto survive. The United Nations has played a valuable \r\nrole in providing swift humanitarian assistance. \r\nGermany is doing everything in its power in this and \r\nmany other crises to alleviate the suffering. \r\n The collapse of State authority and the impact of \r\nclimate change are aggravating the already disastrous \r\nsituation. Germany will continue to be in the vanguard \r\nof the fight against climate change. As with \r\ndisarmament and nuclear non-proliferation, as well as \r\nthe protection of human rights, the fight against \r\nclimate change is an integral element of preventive \r\ndiplomacy. It is part of a farsighted peace policy. \r\n By the end of this year, our planet will have more \r\nthan 7 billion inhabitants. In that world, Germany will \r\nplace its hopes in a strong United Nations as a forum \r\nfor political consensus-building, a source of rules with \r\ninternational legitimacy, and a player in the crisis \r\nregions of this world. The United Nations Charter and \r\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights offer more \r\npeople than ever before the direction and inspiration \r\nthey need to strive for a cooperative world order and a \r\nfairer global community. \r\n However, the United Nations has to adapt to our \r\nchanging world. Only then will the decisions made \r\nhere gain political force, effectiveness and acceptance. \r\nNew centres of power are emerging in global politics. \r\nTheir economic dynamism has prompted them to \r\ndemand political participation. The sixty-fifth session \r\nof the General Assembly considered United Nations \r\nreform, but no real progress has been achieved so far. \r\nWe welcome the fact that the new President intends to \r\nagain personally champion this reform. We will do \r\neverything we can to him. \r\n In September 38 years ago, two German States \r\nwere admitted to the United Nations. At that time, my \r\npredecessor in office, Walter Scheel, stated before the \r\nAssembly: \r\n A/66/PV.25\r\n \r\n51 11-51384 \r\n \r\n “Where there is a question of international \r\ncooperation, of preserving peace and of \r\nprotecting the rights of man, there the Federal \r\nRepublic of Germany will always be found. If \r\nthere is anything we have learned from our own \r\nbitter experience it is this: man is the measure of \r\nall things”. \r\n Man is the measure of all things. Germany \r\nremains committed to this principle. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Yousef Bin Al-Alawi Bin \r\nAbdulla, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs of the \r\nSultanate of Oman. \r\n Mr. Abdulla (Oman) (spoke in Arabic): We are \r\npleased to sincerely and warmly congratulate \r\nMr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on his election to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth \r\nsession and to his brotherly country, Qatar, with which \r\nwe share deep fraternal relations. We are confident that \r\nhis diplomatic experience, especially in the field of \r\nmultilateral diplomacy, will have a great impact on the \r\nsuccess of this session. We wish also to express our \r\nappreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Joseph Deiss of \r\nSwitzerland, for his successful efforts in the conduct of \r\nthe previous session. We also extend our \r\ncongratulations to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on \r\nthe international community’s renewed confidence in \r\nhim, as evidenced by his re-election to his post for a \r\nsecond term, so that he can continue his efforts to \r\nrevitalize the role of the United Nations and further \r\ndevelop its work. \r\n Each year, when we address the Assembly from \r\nthis rostrum, we begin by presenting the issue of the \r\nPalestinian people. The international community has \r\nworked to encourage negotiations between the \r\nPalestinian National Authority and the Government of \r\nIsrael, the occupying Power. Unfortunately, the \r\nsituation remains at a standstill. For that reason, the \r\nglobal community, and the United Nations in \r\nparticular, should act to fulfil its responsibility to find a \r\njust and comprehensive solution. We believe that the \r\nestablishment of a Palestinian State on the basis of the \r\nborders of 4 June 1967 and the recognition of that State \r\nas a Member of the Organization will undoubtedly lead \r\nto serious negotiations aimed at reaching a just, lasting \r\nand comprehensive solution to the Arab-Israeli \r\nconflict. \r\n Brotherly Somalia has been the victim of a \r\ndecades-long civil war caused by a weak leadership \r\nthat failed to reach a political consensus to end that \r\nhateful war. We believe that, to save the Somali people \r\nfrom the threefold threat of poverty, ignorance and \r\nfamine, the time is ripe for the United Nations to \r\nintensify its efforts, in cooperation with regional \r\norganizations, including the League of Arab States, the \r\nAfrican Union, the Organization of Islamic \r\nCooperation and the Inter-Governmental Authority on \r\nDevelopment, to devise a plan to bring peace to \r\nSomalia. We would also stress the importance of \r\nincreasing the provision of humanitarian assistance to \r\nthe millions of Somali refugees and displaced persons. \r\nWe are confident that Somalia’s neighbours share our \r\nbelief in the need for political solutions to the chronic \r\ncrisis in that country. We also reiterate to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that we are fully prepared to support the \r\nefforts of the United Nations in that regard. \r\n On 26 January 2011, my country submitted its \r\nperiodic report to the Human Rights Council in Geneva \r\nin the context of the mechanism for the periodic review \r\nof States’ reports. We in the Sultanate of Oman are \r\nsatisfied that we have come a long way in terms of \r\nprotecting human rights at all levels. We consider this a \r\nnational and spiritual commitment aimed at achieving \r\njustice that also supports the dimension of a global \r\nculture of human rights protection. \r\n Our contemporary world is witnessing profound \r\nchanges in the demographic composition of the peoples \r\nof the world, as young people now constitute the \r\nmajority of the world population. As they are the most \r\nambitious group, capable of mapping the future, the \r\ninternational community should take this reality into \r\nconsideration in the elaboration of all manner of plans \r\nin the economic, education and sustainable \r\ndevelopment fields. \r\n As our region is experiencing such profound \r\nchanges, we, like the rest of the world, believe that the \r\naspirations of young people to a better and more secure \r\nworld and decent livelihoods have prevailed and \r\nshould be accepted and welcomed by all Governments. \r\nWe in the Sultanate of Oman, in keeping with the \r\ninstructions given by His Majesty Sultan Qaboos Bin \r\nSaid, have based all of our national economic and \r\nsocial plans on empowering young people to make \r\nmaximum use of their potential to benefit from \r\ntechnology and to achieve a society characterized by \r\nprosperity and sustainable growth. \r\nA/66/PV.25  \r\n \r\n11-51384 52 \r\n \r\n Today’s world is facing numerous crises that \r\nmake it imperative for the international community to \r\nwork jointly to create conditions that are conducive to \r\nfinding solutions. The world may be on the brink of a \r\nwidespread food crisis, and many people live in fear of \r\nfood shortages. Efforts must therefore be made at the \r\ninternational level to expand production through the \r\ncultivation of larger areas and the use of advanced \r\ntechnology to increase yields and to combat \r\ndesertification in vulnerable areas. \r\n The continuing global financial crisis obliges us \r\nto collectively rethink the principles underlying \r\ninvestment and international trade in order to reach \r\nappropriate solutions aimed at reducing the negative \r\nimpacts of the crisis on countries and societies, \r\nparticularly in the developing world.  \r\n An additional issue we must face is that of global \r\nphenomena such as hurricanes, earthquakes and the \r\nhigh level of environmental pollution, all of which lead \r\nto major human and economic losses. We believe that \r\nall countries, particularly the major industrialized \r\ncountries, should join together to find a solution aimed \r\nat reducing industrial and environmental pollution and \r\ngreenhouse-gas emissions based on modern technology \r\nin those fields. \r\n In closing, we are hopeful that all countries will \r\nseize the opportunity offered by the current session to \r\ntake practical steps and measures on all of the issues \r\nunder discussion. We hope that the session will meet \r\nwith every success.  \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Walid \r\nAl-Moualem, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Syrian \r\nArab Republic. \r\n Mr. Al-Moualem (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke \r\nin Arabic): Allow me to congratulate Mr. Nassir \r\nAbdulaziz Al-Nasser on his election to the presidency \r\nof the General Assembly at this session. I wish him \r\nevery success in his efforts to promote the interests of \r\nour international Organization. I also pay tribute to his \r\npredecessor, Mr. Joseph Deiss, and express to him our \r\ngratitude and appreciation for his successful presidency \r\nof the Assembly last year. \r\n It is only natural that I should start by addressing \r\nthe current situation in Syria, our position in that \r\nregard and the circumstances and events unfolding \r\ninside and outside of our country. There is no doubt \r\nthat States’ positions and circumstances are governed \r\nby their geopolitical realities, related problems and \r\ndemands stemming therefrom. At the same time, they \r\nare influenced by repercussions and the price they have \r\nto pay, whether high or low, resulting from positions \r\nthey take in response to those issues.  \r\n The Syrian Arab Republic is located at the heart \r\nof the Middle East region. Syria’s location has \r\ndetermined its major role in the politics and balances \r\nof the Arab world and the region in general. For many \r\ndecades, Syria faced major challenges and difficulties \r\nwith a firm stance against attempts to limit its role and \r\ninfluence and divert it from the national course it had \r\ncharted. It is no secret that Syria has stood firm in \r\nsupport of national sovereignty and independence in its \r\nnational decisions — a position that has remained a \r\nprimary pillar of Syrian foreign policy. \r\n Syria has spared no effort in support of the \r\nlegitimate struggle of the Palestinian people and in \r\nchampioning resistance movements. Syria has upheld \r\nits inalienable right to liberate the entire occupied \r\nSyrian Golan to the line of 4 June 1967. At the same \r\ntime, Syria has extended a hand of friendship to all \r\nStates and established its international relations based \r\non mutual respect and mutual interests. Through \r\nleverage, it has promoted the centrepiece of Syria’s \r\nnational priorities and established policies, namely on \r\nthe Middle East question, in efforts to liberate the land \r\nand restore the rights of the people. \r\n Syria was dragged into another confrontation \r\nfollowing the occupation of Iraq. It had to choose \r\nbetween enduring political siege and isolation or \r\nsubmitting to demands. Again Syria summoned all of \r\nits might to overcome such a policy, despite the \r\nexorbitant price we had to pay at the expense of our \r\ndomestic priorities and interests. We emerged stronger \r\nfrom that battle, having preserved our independent \r\ndecisions and safeguarded our national priorities. \r\n There are two sides to the problem that Syria \r\nfaces today. On the one hand, the country needs \r\npeople-driven political, economic and social reform. \r\nPresident Bashar Al-Assad has already declared that \r\nthose reforms are needed and timely. He has expressed \r\na strong desire to accomplish them. But the force of the \r\npolitical circumstances to which I briefly alluded to \r\nearlier forced internal demands — important as they \r\nwere — to take a back seat to other priorities. Our \r\n A/66/PV.25\r\n \r\n53 11-51384 \r\n \r\noverriding priority was to address external pressures \r\nthat at times were tantamount to blatant conspiracy. \r\n On the other hand, popular demands and needs \r\nhave been manipulated to further objectives alien to the \r\ninterests and expressed desires of the Syrian people. \r\nThose demands have become stepping stones used by \r\narmed groups to sow discord and to sabotage our \r\nsecurity, eventually becoming a new pretext for foreign \r\nintervention.  \r\n Syria has assumed its responsibility to protect its \r\ncitizens through actions to guarantee safety and \r\nstability. It remains vigilant against the danger of \r\nforeign intervention, which takes on different forms \r\nwith each passing day. Challenging that does not \r\ndiminish our concern for popular demands that were \r\nalready accommodated prior to the recent events. In \r\nour view, the needed reforms are those that are now \r\ndue, many elements of which have been already met. \r\nThey are a work in progress that will continue through \r\nnational dialogue and in the context of national unity, \r\nsovereignty and independence. \r\n To shed more light on the situation, I would recall \r\nat this juncture the statement made by President \r\nAl-Assad on 20 June. In his statement, the President \r\nannounced many reform measures based on the \r\nfollowing new laws: the political parties act to \r\nguarantee political pluralism; the information act to lay \r\nthe ground for free and independent media; the \r\nparliamentary elections act and the local administration \r\nact. The proposed reform measures were to be finalized \r\nby a thorough examination and review of the Syrian \r\nConstitution. The review could eliminate certain \r\narticles to allow for political pluralism and democratic \r\npractices. It could even lead to the framing of a new \r\nConstitution that would guarantee all of these things.  \r\n The constitution is the backbone of the political, \r\neconomic and social life of all States. That reform \r\nmeasure will definitely respond to popular demands \r\nand needs. Furthermore, the President left the door \r\nopen to different views and proposals on the reform \r\neffort in general. In the televised interview that \r\nfollowed, the President announced that a timeline had \r\nbeen set to agree on and implement the proposed \r\nreforms in no more than six months. That is an \r\nextremely important position that requires a serious, in-\r\ndepth national dialogue in order to achieve the desired \r\nmechanisms and results.  \r\n A comprehensive dialogue started a few weeks \r\nago in various Syrian governorates. Representatives of \r\nvarious sectors of Syrian society, including opposition \r\nfigures, are participating in the process to examine the \r\ncomprehensive political, economic and social \r\ncomponents of the proposed reform package. \r\n We deeply regret the surge in foreign-inspired \r\nactivities of armed groups in Syria, which have not \r\nwaned and have instead continued to gain momentum. \r\nThat is the other side of the coin. We would have liked \r\nfor those countries that advocated the need for reform \r\nand change to have supported the official Syrian \r\nposition instead of having opted for incitement and \r\ndefiance. In fact, the more ground we have covered \r\ntowards stability and reform, the stronger the foreign \r\nincitement has become. Armed violence has surged in \r\ntandem with multiple economic sanctions. By targeting \r\nthe Syrian economy with sanctions, the United States \r\nand the European Union have jeopardized the interests \r\nand basic daily subsistence needs of the Syrian people.  \r\n This course of action cannot in any way be \r\nreconciled with pronouncements about concern for the \r\ninterests, security and rights of the Syrian people. \r\nFurthermore, it runs counter to the basic principles of \r\nhuman rights, in defence of which those States base \r\ntheir interference in our internal affairs. It must be \r\nrecalled that the Charter of our Organization states that \r\n“Nothing contained in the present Charter shall \r\nauthorize the United Nations to intervene in matters \r\nwhich are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction \r\nof any state”.  \r\n Syria provided our region with a model of \r\npeaceful coexistence among the different segments of \r\nthe Syrian population, a model which deserves to be \r\nemulated. Syria opted for secularism to promote its \r\nnational unity in view of the religious and ethnic \r\ndiversity of the region to which it belongs, a region \r\nthat is the cradle of divine religions and the birthplace \r\nof human civilization. \r\n Any objective and realistic analysis of the events \r\nin and around Syria will demonstrate clearly that one \r\nof the purposes of the unjust anti-Syria campaign \r\ncurrently under way is to attack this model of \r\ncoexistence, which has been a source of pride to our \r\npeople. How can we otherwise explain media \r\nprovocations of financing and arming religious \r\nextremism? What purpose could that serve other than \r\ntotal chaos, which would dismember Syria — and \r\nA/66/PV.25  \r\n \r\n11-51384 54 \r\n \r\nconsequently adversely affect its neighbours? What \r\nelse could this course of action achieve other than to \r\nspread Western hegemony throughout the countries of \r\nthe Mediterranean and to serve Israel’s expansionist \r\ninterests? \r\n I assure the Assembly that our people are \r\ndetermined to reject all forms of foreign intervention in \r\ntheir internal affairs. We shall continue to achieve \r\nsecurity and stability and to implement the \r\ncomprehensive programme of reform through national \r\ndialogue so that, within months, Syria will become a \r\nmodel of political pluralism and an oasis for peaceful \r\ncoexistence among the different segments of its \r\npopulation. \r\n From this rostrum, I call on the States that have \r\nparticipated in the unjust campaign against Syria to \r\nreconsider their positions. To them I say, “Our people \r\nwill not let you implement your plans and will foil \r\nyour schemes”. \r\n I also express our appreciation to the countries \r\nthat have stood by our people’s side in this crisis, \r\npre-empting any harm that could have befallen their \r\ninterests and encouraging them to pursue their \r\naspirations. \r\n For many years, the international community has \r\nconsidered the two-State solution as the basis for \r\nestablishing peace between the Israelis and the \r\nPalestinians. The negotiations between the two sides \r\nthat have continued for years have failed to achieve \r\nany progress towards a solution owing to Israel’s well-\r\nknown positions and measures. Therefore, the \r\ninternational community’s pursuit of the recognition of  \r\n \r\na Palestinian State on the Palestinian territories \r\noccupied in 1967, with Jerusalem as its capital, is \r\nlegitimate. It is a positive step towards restoring all \r\nPalestinian rights. Syria calls on the international \r\ncommunity to support that request. We also condemn \r\nthe Israeli blockade of Gaza and call on the \r\ninternational community to shoulder its responsibility \r\nand force Israel to lift the blockade.  \r\n Our position on declaring the Middle East a \r\nnuclear-weapon-free zone is well established and well \r\nknown. We continue to call for bringing pressure to \r\nbear on Israel to implement international resolutions \r\nthat have called on it to accede to the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and to \r\nsubmit its nuclear facilities to the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency’s comprehensive safeguards regime. \r\nThis measure is of extreme importance to the security \r\nand stability of our region. At the same time, we stress \r\nthat all States have the right to acquire nuclear \r\ntechnologies for peaceful purposes. That right is \r\nguaranteed under the NPT. \r\n We strongly renew the call to lift the embargo \r\nthat has been enforced against Cuba for decades. \r\n We all aspire to a more just and secure world. \r\nThis international Organization has a major role to play \r\nin that regard. It can do so more competently if some \r\npowerful States gave up attempts to further their own \r\nagendas. Nevertheless, we still hope that the \r\ninternational community, through this Organization, \r\nwill be able to follow the right course so as to bring \r\nabout a better world, to which our peoples aspire. \r\n  The meeting rose at 2:40 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
