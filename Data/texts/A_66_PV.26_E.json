(Qatar) \r\n \r\n \r\n In the absence of the President, Ms. Kamara \r\n(Liberia), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 8 (continued) \r\n \r\nGeneral debate \r\n \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Elyor Ganiev, Deputy Prime Minister \r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of \r\nUzbekistan. \r\n Mr. Ganiev (Uzbekistan) (spoke in Russian): \r\nAllow me at the outset to extend my greetings to all \r\nthose who are participating in the work of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-sixth session and to wish them \r\nevery success in their endeavours. It gives me great \r\npleasure to congratulate the Secretary-General, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, on his reappointment to \r\nthat high post for a second term. I also wish to \r\ncongratulate Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on his \r\nelection to the post of President of the General \r\nAssembly at the sixty-sixth session, and wish him \r\nfruitful work. \r\n In 2011, Uzbekistan has been celebrating a \r\nlandmark date in its modern history — the twentieth \r\nanniversary of independence. Only 20 years have \r\npassed since the Republic of Uzbekistan became an \r\nindependent State and joined the ranks of the fully \r\nfledged Members of the United Nations, having gained \r\nthe right to decide and build on its own present and \r\nfuture, but over that period Uzbekistan has made \r\nsignificant progress in building an independent State, \r\ndeveloping the national economy and modernizing the \r\ncountry. \r\n During those years, the Republic of Uzbekistan \r\nhas transformed itself from a sluggish raw materials-\r\nbased economy, with a destructive monoculture of \r\ncotton, an underdeveloped industrial and social \r\ninfrastructure and low-per-capita consumption, into a \r\nmodern country with a steadily developing economy. \r\n The following evidence clearly testifies to the \r\nfact that, over the past 20 years of independent \r\ndevelopment, Uzbekistan’s economy has grown by a \r\nfactor of 3.5 and the population’s total income has \r\nincreased by a factor of 20. Despite the negative \r\nimpact of the ongoing global financial and economic \r\ncrisis, Uzbekistan continues to develop at a steady \r\npace. Over the past five years, the growth in gross \r\ndomestic product (GDP) has averaged 8.5 per cent. \r\nThis year, it is expected that that level will be \r\nmaintained. \r\n Striking achievements have been made in \r\nimplementing the goals set out in the Millennium \r\nDeclaration. During the years of independence, State \r\nexpenditure in the social sector has increased more \r\nthan fivefold. About 60 per cent of the annual budget is \r\ndevoted to the development of health care, education, \r\ncommunal services, social welfare and other sectors. \r\nSome 82.5 per cent of the population has access to \r\nclean drinking water and 83.5 per cent to natural gas. \r\n I would like to underscore in particular the huge \r\nrole and significance in all those changes of education \r\nA/66/PV.26  \r\n \r\n11-51390 2 \r\n \r\nand people’s increasing awareness. Annual expenditure \r\non education in Uzbekistan amounts to 10 to 12 per \r\ncent of GDP, whereas that indicator worldwide does \r\nnot exceed 3 to 5 per cent. An exceptional national \r\nprogramme to train skilled personnel and workers has \r\nbeen launched. From 2009, a mandatory 12-year \r\neducation programme was introduced. Uzbekistan has \r\nset up more than 1,600 modern vocational colleges and \r\nhigh schools. \r\n Such indicators, which are not often seen across \r\nthe world, clearly affirm that our most important goal \r\nis ensure the quality of life and protect the interests of \r\ncitizens. The Uzbek model for the country’s \r\ndemocratization and transition to a socially oriented \r\nmarket economy, adopted in the early years of our \r\nindependence, has served as the basis for those \r\nachievements. \r\n Our country is steadily progressing towards \r\nachieving the goal we have set ourselves, namely, to \r\njoin the ranks of the modern, developed and \r\ndemocratic States and to ensure for its people a high \r\nstandard of living and a dignified place in the world \r\ncommunity. \r\n Today, we have every reason to affirm that we \r\nhave achieved the main goal, that is, the country’s \r\nirreversible and steady reform and democratization. \r\nThe conceptual framework for further deepening the \r\ndemocratic reforms and establishing civil society in the \r\ncountry, developed by the President of Uzbekistan, \r\nIslam Karimov, in November 2010, provides for the \r\nfurther development and strengthening of Uzbekistan’s \r\nlong-term sustainable development model. The \r\nconceptual framework calls for further democratization \r\nof State authority and governance, reforming the \r\njudicial system, establishing and developing civil \r\nsociety institutions, ensuring freedom of speech and \r\ninformation, developing the electoral law, further \r\ndeepening market reform and liberalizing the economy. \r\n In assessing the state of affairs in Central Asia, it \r\nis important to note that, given its geopolitical and \r\ngeostrategic significance and the very rich natural \r\nresources, the region continues to be the focus of the \r\ninternational community’s attention in the context of \r\nthe growing threats and challenges to security and \r\nstability in the world. \r\n First, the war that has been under way in \r\nAfghanistan for more than 30 years continues to be the \r\nmain destabilizing factor, not only in the region but \r\nalso in the entire world. More unfortunately, the \r\nsituation remains tense despite all the measures now \r\nbeing taken by the international community. It is \r\nimportant to underscore, in particular, that today, \r\neveryone is sure that there is no military solution to the \r\nAfghan problem. Almost all leaders, including those \r\ninvolved in resolving the Afghan issue and the direct \r\nmilitary command of the coalition forces in \r\nAfghanistan, are of this view. \r\n We firmly believe that the Afghan people \r\nthemselves must resolve their country’s problems. \r\nOnly through a compromise between the warring \r\nparties with the Afghans themselves being involved in \r\nthat process, as well as the socio-economic recovery of \r\nAfghanistan with the help of the international \r\ncommunity, will it be possible to find a way out of the \r\ncurrent deadlock in Afghanistan’s situation.  \r\n President Karimov already stated that at the \r\nNATO Summit in Bucharest in April 2008. We see the \r\nfuture of Afghanistan as a peaceful and steadily \r\ndeveloping State that poses no threat to neighbouring \r\ncountries, such that the people living in the region can \r\nfully enjoy the benefits of friendly, mutually beneficial \r\nand equal relations. Uzbekistan will continue to pursue \r\na policy of good-neighbourliness and cooperation \r\ntowards Afghanistan on a bilateral basis, in accordance \r\nwith mutual national interests. \r\n Secondly, the tragic events in Kyrgyzstan in June \r\n2010 posed a serious challenge to peace and stability in \r\nthe Central Asian region. More than a year has passed \r\nsince those bloody events. However, to date no \r\npolitical or legal conclusions on all those forces and \r\nspecific individuals who ordered, organized and \r\nperpetrated the crimes have been drawn. Until such \r\ninvestigations are completed and the perpetrators, \r\nirrespective of their nationality, origin or position, are \r\npunished, it is difficult to envisage the restoration of \r\ntrust and cooperation between the Uzbek community \r\nand the Kyrgyz. \r\n Thirdly, the socio-economic development not \r\nonly of our country, but also of the entire Central Asian \r\nregion, is hampered by the ecological catastrophe of \r\nthe Aral Sea. In practically the span of one generation, \r\nit has changed from once being one of the most \r\nexceptional and most beautiful seas into a drying and \r\ndisappearing pool. Today, the Aral Sea basin faces a \r\nrange of ecological, socio-economic and demographic \r\nproblems of global consequences. The Secretary-\r\n A/66/PV.26\r\n \r\n3 11-51390 \r\n \r\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, himself was convinced of \r\nthat while visiting the Aral Sea last year. \r\n In such circumstances, attempts to build huge \r\nhydropower facilities on the upper reaches of the Amu \r\nDarya and Syr Darya rivers are counterproductive and \r\ndangerous, since they pose serious threats to public \r\nsafety in terms both of environmental, social and \r\ntechnical risks and of preserving the volume and \r\ncourse of the river flow. \r\n In addressing such problems, we proceed on the \r\npremise that any use of transboundary watercourses \r\nmust take into account the interests of all States located \r\nin their basins, and should be carried out in accordance \r\nwith international law. I refer in particular to the \r\nConvention on the Protection and Use of \r\nTransboundary Watercourses and International Lakes \r\nof 17 March 1992 and the Convention on the Law of \r\nthe Non-navigational Uses of International Watercourses of \r\n21 May 1997. \r\n We do not ignore the rights of the upstream \r\ncountries to develop their hydropower sector. In our \r\nview, this is a very important sector of the economy. \r\nHowever, it would be safer and more rational to build \r\ncascades of small hydropower plants with the same \r\ntotal production capacity. Our country’s position is not \r\nonly fully consistent with relevant international law \r\nand accepted regulations, but it is also, and most \r\nimportantly, derived from them. \r\n In conclusion, Uzbekistan supports the theme \r\nproposed by the President of the General Assembly for \r\nthis session’s general debate, namely, “The role of \r\nmediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful \r\nmeans”. We fully share his view regarding the \r\nimportance of strengthening multilateral machinery so \r\nas to ensure a stable and just world order that is \r\ncapable of effectively responding to emerging threats \r\nto regional stability and international security. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Össur Skarphéðinsson, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs and External Trade of the Republic of \r\nIceland. \r\n Mr. Skarphéðinsson (Iceland): Let me start by \r\ncongratulating His Excellency Ambassador Nassir \r\nAbdulaziz Al-Nasser on his election as President of the \r\nsixty-sixth session of the General Assembly, and \r\nassuring him that he will have the fullest cooperation \r\nof the Icelandic delegation. \r\n In recent weeks, we have witnessed the worst \r\nhunger crisis of this century in the Horn of Africa. It is \r\na devastating reminder that fighting poverty and \r\nhunger is still the most important and challenging \r\nundertaking of our times. Our collective duty and \r\nresponsibility is to help our weakest brothers and \r\nsisters. As wealthier nations, we must do better in \r\nproviding relief. We must act with more speed and \r\nmore generosity to help those who are deprived of the \r\nbasic necessities of life — food and water. I can say, \r\nmy friends, that in Iceland, we have indeed decided to \r\ndo so. \r\n I am quite happy to be able to tell the Assembly \r\ntoday that the Icelandic Parliament has unanimously \r\nagreed to substantially increase our contribution to \r\ndeveloping nations in the coming financial year. It has \r\nalso accepted a plan to raise our aid to the goal of \r\n0.7 per cent of our gross national income. That is our \r\npledge, as agreed by every political party in the \r\nIcelandic Parliament. \r\n The fight against hunger and poverty is the same \r\nstruggle as the one we wage to protect our planet from \r\nthe ravages caused by the greed of our own species. All \r\nMembers know that, next year, we will celebrate the \r\ntwentieth anniversary of the bright new vision \r\nintroduced at the historic Earth Summit in Rio. Over \r\nthese past 20 years, deep concern for the environment \r\nhas indeed moved to the forefront of the global agenda. \r\nBut the Assembly also knows the sobering truth, which \r\nis that the ambitions of Rio are still a far cry from \r\nbeing realized. Actions are still needed. If ever there \r\nwas a time to act boldly, that time is now. \r\n The key theme of Rio next year will be the “green \r\neconomy”. I assure the Assembly that my country has \r\nexpertise to offer that can help to fuel a green \r\nrevolution. Renewable energy, marine health, the \r\nsustainable use of land and, not least, gender equality, \r\nwhich have always been at the core of the Icelandic \r\nforeign policy, are the four issues that we shall bring to \r\nRio next year. What we really need is indeed a \r\nrevolution, a green revolution. We need a seismic shift \r\nfrom fossil fuels to renewable energy. That is the only \r\nway to turn the ship. \r\n In Iceland, we have some cutting-edge \r\ntechnology on geothermal energy that we want to \r\nshare. That splendid form of renewable energy is the \r\nmost undervalued and overlooked source of cheap \r\npower in the world. Of course, geothermal is most \r\nA/66/PV.26  \r\n \r\n11-51390 4 \r\n \r\ncertainly not a silver bullet, but it needs to be a part of \r\nthe portfolio that we must develop to solve emissions \r\nproblems. Many members know that Central and South \r\nAmerica, East Africa and South-East Asia are home to \r\nvast areas literally brimming with geothermal potential. \r\nIcelandic know-how, coupled with outside financing, \r\ncould go a long way in making those areas self-\r\nsufficient in terms of green energy. \r\n As one of the largest fishing nations, Iceland has \r\nalways been deeply protective of the health of the \r\noceans. Today, climate change threatens to place the \r\nfisheries of the world under a new strain. As we speak, \r\nthe acidification of the oceans resulting from human \r\ncarbon emissions is affecting the health of the marine \r\nenvironment. This is especially true in the Arctic and \r\nits vicinity, which is my home. As a marine biologist, I \r\nfear that, more likely sooner than later, this may affect \r\nthe world’s fishing stocks, which are a vital source of \r\nprotein for more than 1 billion people. This is just one \r\nmore argument why we so urgently need to conclude a \r\npost-Kyoto agreement later this year on the reduction \r\nof greenhouse gases. \r\n Every day, the Arctic bears silent witness to the \r\nimpact of climate change. The snow that I experienced \r\nas a child is today fast becoming a rare event for my \r\ntwo teenage daughters. The sad truth is that the Arctic \r\nglaciers and the Arctic sea ice are melting at a much \r\nfaster rate than anyone ever anticipated. It is of course \r\ntrue that the disappearance of the sea ice will open up \r\nnew and shorter transport routes from the Pacific to the \r\nNorth Atlantic via the Arctic Ocean. We most certainly \r\nwill also see huge areas open up for the exploitation of \r\noil and gas resources. \r\n This will come at a price, however. Climatic \r\nchanges are forcing the peoples of the Arctic, such as \r\nour neighbours in Greenland, to change their living \r\nhabits. These changes will also melt the tundra, which \r\nacts as a carbon buffer against the climate system, and \r\nthus further accelerate the warming of the planet. The \r\nalready-fragile ecosystem of the Arctic will become \r\neven more brittle. \r\n Let us remember what happened in the Gulf of \r\nMexico and let us be aware that oil breaks down very, \r\nvery slowly in the extreme cold of the Arctic. We \r\nshould not allow the exploitation of the Arctic without \r\napplying the strictest rules. That must be the \r\nprecondition for every human move into Arctic \r\nresources. \r\n I am often asked whether a country like Iceland, \r\nwhich is not geographically small but has, admittedly, \r\nslightly fewer people than most, can have any say in \r\naction on issues of global concern, be it in Rio or in \r\nNew York. Well, to lift a phrase from a famous \r\nstatesman who spoke from this very podium a few days \r\nago: “Yes, we can”.  \r\n Twenty years ago, in 1991, we in Iceland watched \r\na television broadcast of thousands of brave Latvians, \r\nLithuanians and Estonians taking their destiny into \r\ntheir own hands. They reached out to the international \r\ncommunity, among them the people of Iceland, and \r\nasked for help in breaking the ice that was impeding \r\ntheir international recognition. \r\n The great British statesman, Lord Palmerston, \r\nonce made a famous statement to the effect that there is \r\nno such thing as eternal friendship between nations and \r\nthat only eternal interests could determine how nations \r\nreacted towards each other. That well-known mantra is \r\nstill taught today in every bad school of political \r\nscience. My friends, if Palmerston’s words had \r\nprevailed, Iceland would have turned a deaf ear to the \r\ncall of the freedom fighters in the Baltics. We did not. \r\nIn the historic year of 1991, Iceland became the first to \r\nrecognize the restored sovereignty of the Baltic States. \r\nWe did that out of respect for the principles that are so \r\nvitally important to small nations: the right to choose \r\nyour own destiny, to carve out your own future — the \r\nundeniable right of small nations to be independent. \r\nPrinciples do matter in politics. \r\n Based on the same principle that led Iceland to \r\nrecognize the Baltic States in 1991, today we support \r\nthe Palestinian struggle for statehood. Based on that \r\nvery same principle, Iceland feels that the international \r\ncommunity should welcome Palestine as a new \r\nMember State in the United Nations, based on the \r\npre-1967 borders — exactly the same criteria as those \r\nlaid down by the European Union, the Quartet and \r\nlately, also by President Barack Obama in his strong \r\nspeech in May. \r\n I have been to Gaza. I have talked to the people: \r\nthe fishermen who no longer can ply their trade, the \r\nyoung people who are unemployed, the families that \r\nneed a roof over their head. I have also been to the \r\nWest Bank. I have seen with my own eyes how the land \r\nof the Palestinians has literally been cut to pieces by \r\nhorrible walls of separation. That is wrong. That is \r\n A/66/PV.26\r\n \r\n5 11-51390 \r\n \r\nunjust. That is against every moral code that Iceland \r\nhas ever stood for as a guardian of human rights.  \r\n We must remember that Palestine today is really \r\ndoing just the same thing as Israel did in 1947, and \r\nIceland and so many other States at the time supported \r\nIsrael’s action. Israel took its case to the United \r\nNations and emerged with statehood. Palestine \r\ndeserves the same. And I think it is hypocrisy to \r\nsuggest otherwise. In the middle of the democratic \r\nrevolution brought on by the fresh breeze of the Arabic \r\nSpring and inspired, not least, by women and young \r\npeople, it would be foolish to deny Palestine its right to \r\nstatehood. Such denial would act against reconciliation \r\nin the region. \r\n It will, perhaps, not come as any surprise to \r\nMembers here, but Iceland will therefore vote “yes”, \r\nwhen a resolution on Palestinian statehood comes to a \r\nvote in the General Assembly. Furthermore, the \r\nIcelandic Government is determined to fully recognize \r\nPalestine and will next week submit to the Parliament \r\nof Iceland a resolution on the recognition of Palestine \r\nas a sovereign and independent State. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Mourad Medelci, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the People’s Democratic Republic of \r\nAlgeria. \r\n Mr. Medelci (Algeria) (spoke in Arabic): His \r\nExcellency Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, President of the \r\nPeople’s Democratic Republic of Algeria, has given me \r\nthe honour of delivering this address to the General \r\nAssembly. At the outset, I wish to congratulate the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly for his assumption \r\nof the presidency at its sixty-sixth session. His \r\nprofessional experience in the United Nations and his \r\npersonal qualities will undoubtedly lead to the \r\nexcellent conduct and success of our work.  \r\n I also pay tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Joseph \r\nDeiss, for his efforts. Finally, I reiterate my \r\ncongratulations to Mr. Ban Ki-moon, Secretary-\r\nGeneral, upon his reappointment and express my \r\ncountry’s satisfaction for the dynamic manner by \r\nwhich he is leading the work and role of the \r\nOrganization. \r\n Now that the Republic of South Sudan has joined \r\nthe family of the United Nations, on behalf of my \r\ncountry, I warmly congratulate the people and the \r\nGovernment of that kindred country.  \r\n The main theme of this session, namely, the role \r\nof mediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful \r\nmeans, was chosen at a time of aggravated tensions, \r\nthe recurrence of economic and financial crises, \r\nincreasing unresolved challenges and diminished \r\nefforts and cooperation in multilateralism.  \r\n Today’s globalized but confused world has \r\nstrayed from its social structures and balances and been \r\ncrisscrossed by new, unregulated influences and \r\nunequal relationships. Therefore, the international \r\nsystem that was established in 1945 requires today \r\nadaptation to current demands in order to respond to \r\nthe expectations of the people of the world.  \r\n Algeria is following with special interest the \r\nongoing events in some countries in its region, which \r\nhave led to numerous lives lost and huge material \r\ndamage. Algeria deplores the violence experienced in \r\nsome countries, and reiterates its call for a political \r\nsettlement of all of those ongoing situations, based on \r\nthe aspirations of the people for freedom, justice and \r\ndemocracy, and respect for each country’s sovereignty \r\nand for international law. \r\n With respect to Libya, Algeria expects a rapid \r\nrestoration of peace and security and the formation of a \r\nGovernment that represents all sections of Libyan \r\nsociety. We are convinced that Libya’s stability is a \r\nfundamental element for the stability of the region as a \r\nwhole. From this podium, Algeria reaffirms its \r\ndetermination to work immediately with the new \r\nLibyan authorities to promote full, exemplary bilateral \r\ncollaboration based on a spirit of brotherhood and \r\nsolidarity. \r\n Recent developments on the Arab stage will not \r\nfail to directly affect the situation prevailing in the \r\nMiddle East. Continued Israeli occupation of Palestine \r\nand other occupied Arab territories, as well as the lack \r\nof genuine prospects for just and lasting peace in the \r\nregion are, in that regard, a source of deep concern for \r\nAlgeria. The stalemated peace process in the Middle \r\nEast, the continued building of settlements and the \r\ncontinued campaign to Judaize the holy city of \r\nAl-Quds continue daily to further distance any prospect \r\nof a just and lasting peace based on the principle of \r\nland for peace. \r\n That situation, which weighs heavy with risk and \r\nuncertainty in an already sensitive region, is both an \r\naffront to the peoples of the region and a challenge for \r\nthe entire international community. Among those \r\nA/66/PV.26  \r\n \r\n11-51390 6 \r\n \r\nchallenges, the inhumane embargo of Gaza and its \r\nseacoast constitutes a genuine collective punishment of \r\nits inhabitants.  \r\n The Palestinian Authority’s initiative, at this \r\nsession, requesting that Palestine be recognized as a \r\nfull Member State of the United Nations is an \r\nopportunity for the United Nations to correct, to some \r\nextent, an injustice that has lasted for over 60 years \r\nnow. This admission will be a clear, unequivocal \r\nresponse by the international community showing its \r\ndetermination to impose international law and to reject \r\na policy of fait accompli.  \r\n In the same context, Algeria reiterates its concern \r\nat the persistence of coercive economic measures and \r\nunilateral sanctions against developing countries. I \r\nwould recall in this respect the embargo that has been \r\nimposed against Cuba for over half a century now.  \r\n There is another issue on the agenda of the \r\nUnited Nations that calls for special attention, namely, \r\nthe situation in the Western Sahara. Indeed, no effort \r\nmust be spared in promoting the path of dialogue and \r\nnegotiation, which is the only way that will enable the \r\nSaharawi people to freely express their right to self-\r\ndetermination. In this context, Algeria reiterates its \r\ncommitment to provide full support to the efforts of the \r\nSecretary-General and his Personal Envoy, and appeals \r\nto both parties, Morocco and the Frente Polisario, to \r\ndemonstrate a spirit of responsibility in settling this \r\nconflict, which has unfortunately lasted all too long. \r\n This year marks the tenth anniversary of the \r\nterrorist attacks of 11 September 2001. The time has \r\ncome for the international community to reiterate its \r\nfull commitment to the fight against international \r\nterrorism. The progress made to date to eradicate this \r\nscourge does not yet satisfy us, nor does it allow us to \r\nlet down our guard. On the contrary, we should remain \r\nready to contribute appropriate solutions to the root \r\ncauses of terrorism and its many ramifications.  \r\n Algeria would thus take this opportunity to stress \r\nthe threefold need to, first, reach the necessary \r\nconsensus to hasten the adoption of an international \r\nconvention against terrorism; secondly, adopt a \r\nprotocol prohibiting the paying of ransoms to terrorist \r\ngroups; and finally, prevent the use of information and \r\ncommunications technologies for criminal purposes.  \r\n In order for this approach to succeed, we must \r\nensure a return to strict respect for the fundamentals of \r\nour cooperation, the preservation of the universal \r\ncharacter of our Organization, the primacy of \r\ninternational law and the full application of the rules of \r\nmultilateralism. \r\n The current weaknesses of world governance are \r\nillustrated on a daily basis in the various crises that we \r\nface. In this respect, I would refer first to the inability \r\nof the United Nations in general, and the Security \r\nCouncil in particular, to manage conflicts that threaten \r\ninternational peace and security or even to ensure the \r\nimplementation of their own resolutions. Secondly, I \r\nwould refer to the recent global economic and financial \r\ncrisis and its devastating effects, in particular its \r\nimpact on developing countries’ economies. This crisis \r\nhas exposed a system subject to the vagaries of the \r\nmarket, which responds more to the need for large \r\nprivate companies to make a profit than to the need for \r\ngrowth and development. This system excludes the \r\ncountries of the South from both the management of \r\nrelevant international institutions and from setting the \r\nrules that govern them. Thirdly, I would mention the \r\ntragic effects of climate change, which are a real threat \r\nto the future of the international community.  \r\n Given these realities, we must adopt, within the \r\nframework of the United Nations, a global, inclusive \r\napproach in order to, first, ensure general reform of the \r\nUnited Nations as a precondition to the establishment \r\nof financial institutions that can respond to the \r\nexpectations of our countries and counter speculative \r\nmovements and the virtual markets’ dominance over \r\nthe realities of the world economy. Secondly, the \r\nreform of the United Nations should make it possible \r\nfor an effective collective security system to emerge \r\nthat will be able to respond to the breadth and \r\ncomplexity of the challenges that the international \r\ncommunity faces. Thirdly, we must ensure the success \r\nof upcoming events and programmes on the United \r\nNations agenda, in order to achieve real awareness-\r\nraising and so that decisive action can be taken to settle \r\nthe problems caused by climate change. \r\n If Algeria is encouraging the adoption of a global \r\napproach at this crucial point of the world’s \r\ndevelopment, it is because it has participated in certain \r\ninitiatives that have demonstrated how effective they \r\ncan be at the regional level. Here, I would refer to the \r\nmany efforts undertaken by the Sahel countries, along \r\nwith their partners, during the international conference \r\non development and the fight against terrorism held \r\nrecently in Algeria. This allowed us to make important \r\n A/66/PV.26\r\n \r\n7 11-51390 \r\n \r\ndecisions on containing the phenomenon of terrorism, \r\nreducing its effects and attacking its root causes. \r\nBeyond the fight against terrorism, the conference also \r\ninsisted on highlighting a priority that is often \r\nforgotten, which is putting the issue of development at \r\nthe very heart of all cooperation efforts. Such \r\ncooperation, which is currently very crucial at the \r\nregional level, requires support from our partners that \r\nresponds to the needs expressed by our countries. \r\n I would like to devote the last part of my \r\ncomments to recent measures undertaken by my \r\ncountry to reinforce political, economic and social \r\nreforms aimed at strengthening the rule of law and \r\ngood governance. On the political and institutional \r\nlevels, these reforms include a review of the \r\nConstitution, the adoption of a new law on information \r\nand the media, the decriminalization of press offences, \r\nan opening of audiovisual media, an amendment of the \r\nlaw on political parties and of the electoral law, and the \r\nstrengthening of the role of women in elected bodies.  \r\n These political reforms are based on our firm \r\ndesire to promote human rights as broadly as possible, \r\nas was reiterated to all the special rapporteurs who \r\nhave visited Algeria since November 2010. \r\n On the economic level, decisive measures have \r\nbeen taken to improve the business climate, free up \r\nproductive energy and reinforce the role of companies \r\nand institutions as the drivers of growth and \r\ndevelopment. On the social level, as Algeria is \r\nconcerned about the future of its youth, it has increased \r\nthe number of its assistance and employment \r\nprogrammes for the various categories of youth so that \r\nthey can make a smooth integration into the labour \r\nmarket. These measures will of course lead to a \r\nstrengthening of the democratic process and of the rule \r\nof law through an inclusive approach that brings \r\ntogether all the political and social forces in my \r\ncountry. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nHighness Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, \r\nSecretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth \r\nAffairs of the United Arab Emirates. \r\n Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al Nahyan (United \r\nArab Emirates) (spoke in Arabic): It is my pleasure to \r\ntake this opportunity to congratulate the President of \r\nthis session, who is the Permanent Representative of \r\nour sister State of Qatar, for his election as President of \r\nthe sixty-sixth session of the United Nations General \r\nAssembly. I am confident that his experience in \r\ninternational political and diplomatic affairs will \r\ncontribute to the success of this session’s work. I wish \r\nhim every success. I also wish to commend his \r\npredecessor, His Excellency Joseph Deiss, for his \r\noutstanding leadership of the previous session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. In addition, I would like to \r\ncongratulate His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-Moon on the \r\nrenewed confidence in him and his reappointment as \r\nSecretary-General of this international Organization for \r\na second term. I would also like to take this \r\nopportunity to congratulate the Republic of South \r\nSudan for joining our international Organization as a \r\nState Member of the United Nations, along with the \r\npeople of Libya for their Transitional National \r\nCouncil’s taking Libya’s seat in the United Nations. \r\n Addressing enormous international challenges \r\ndepends on the extent of consolidated and collective \r\nwork, with the participation of all States, including the \r\nsmall and developing ones, in international decision-\r\nmaking structures, institutions and mechanisms, based \r\non the principles of equality, justice and transparency. \r\n My country has therefore undertaken extensive \r\npreventive diplomatic efforts in order to contain the \r\ntensions and disputes occurring in its surroundings and \r\nbeyond. The United Arab Emirates vigorously seeks to \r\nenhance its humanitarian and economical programmes \r\nto several developing countries, particularly to those \r\ncountries undergoing conflicts or natural disasters, in \r\naddition to its other effective contributions to \r\npeacekeeping operations, protection of civilians, and \r\nre-building efforts. Those contributions represent our \r\nsignificant partnership with several parties, and our \r\ndedication to achieve the noble objectives of \r\nmaintaining and consolidating international peace and \r\nsecurity. \r\n The solid strategic political approach adopted by \r\nthe United Arab Emirates is not limited to bilateral and \r\nregional cooperation; it is also evident in the way we \r\nhandle all issues. My country seeks to establish peace \r\nand security, eliminate tensions from the region and \r\nenhance confidence-building measures. We apply the \r\nsame approach in dealing with the occupation by the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran of the three Emirate islands of \r\nAbu Musa, and the Greater and Lesser Tumbs. Since \r\nthe illegitimate occupation of those islands in 1971, my \r\ncountry has adopted a flexible diplomatic approach to \r\nresolve this issue through peaceful means, either \r\nthrough direct bilateral negotiations, or by referring the \r\nA/66/PV.26  \r\n \r\n11-51390 8 \r\n \r\nmatter to the International Court of Justice. This has \r\nbeen our approach throughout the last four decades. \r\n However, the United Arab Emirates expresses its \r\ndeep concern over the lack of progress in direct, \r\nregional and international contacts made so far with the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran with a view to reaching a \r\npeaceful, just and permanent solution. The actions \r\ntaken by Iran with the aim of changing the legal, \r\nphysical and demographic situation of the islands are \r\nnull and void and have no legal effect whatsoever. \r\nThose Iranian actions also constitute a violation of \r\ninternational law, as well as of the United Nations \r\nCharter. Therefore, we call on the Islamic Republic of \r\nIran to enter into serious and direct negotiations \r\nbetween the two countries, or to refer the issue to the \r\nInternational Court of Justice in light of its continuous \r\nillegal occupation of the three islands, which are an \r\nintegral part of the territorial sovereignty of the United \r\nArab Emirates. \r\n We have been closely monitoring the major \r\ndevelopments and complications surrounding the \r\nPalestinian issue, which unfortunately resulted in \r\nhalting the efforts and chances of resuming peace talks. \r\nIt is time to resolve this issue in all its humanitarian, \r\nlegal and political aspects. The core of the solution for \r\nthis issue lies in the establishment of a full-fledged \r\nsovereign State within the 4 June 1967 borders, with \r\nEast Jerusalem as its capital. Comprehensive and just \r\npeace between Arab countries and Israel would greatly \r\nassist in reducing tensions and deprive the voices of \r\nextremism and violence from using this ongoing issue \r\nas a major justifications for their extremism and \r\nviolence.  \r\n My country has been closely monitoring the \r\nrecent events in the brotherly Kingdom of Bahrain, \r\nwhich have adversely affected its peace and stability. \r\nWhile we are extending every required support to the \r\nKingdom of Bahrain, we denounce any external \r\nintervention in Bahrain’s internal affairs. \r\n We believe that the measures and good efforts \r\nundertaken by His Majesty King Hamad bin Issa \r\nAl Khalifa of Bahrain to promote national dialogue \r\namong all segments of Bahraini society are important \r\nsteps that seek to maintain peace and stability in the \r\nKingdom, preserve civil peace, strengthen national \r\nunity and pursue reforms and progress, in a manner \r\nthat will realize the hopes and aspirations of all the \r\npeople of Bahrain.  \r\n We emphasize that the sovereignty, security and \r\nterritorial integrity of the Kingdom of Bahrain are an \r\nintegral part of the security and stability of the Arabian \r\nGulf region, and also part of the responsibilities of the \r\nArab Gulf Cooperation Council in the region. All \r\nmembers of the Council are keen to consolidate good \r\nneighbourly relations with all States, based on the \r\nprinciples of international law and other international \r\ninstruments. \r\n The United Arab Emirates renews through this \r\ninternational platform its full commitment to the \r\nsovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and \r\nnational unity of Libya. We also stress our commitment \r\nto Security Council resolutions 1970 (2011) and 1973 \r\n(2011) with regard to the protection of civilians. Since \r\nthe beginning of the Libyan crisis, we have focused on \r\nthe humanitarian assistance aspect and the protection \r\nof civilians. We realized these goals within the efforts \r\nof the international community. We will continue to \r\nsupport Libya and its people in the upcoming \r\nreconstruction phase. We believe that the honourable \r\npeople of Libya and its leadership are capable of \r\nidentifying the characteristics of next phase in order to \r\nenhance Libya’s stature within the international \r\ncommunity and strengthen its development and \r\nstability. To this end, my country calls on our \r\ninternational partners to intensify their efforts to \r\nrelease the remaining Libyan frozen assets.  \r\n My country has also made substantial direct \r\ncontributions for the reconstruction of Afghanistan, for \r\nrestoring peace and stability in the country and for \r\nalleviating the suffering of its people. Success in this \r\nregard will be a focal point in countering extremism, \r\nmilitancy, and international terrorism in the Arabian \r\nGulf region. In addition, peace and security in \r\nAfghanistan have a direct impact on regional security \r\nand on the security of the Arab Gulf region. From this \r\nplatform, I call on all Afghani parties to cooperate in \r\nachieving a process of comprehensive national \r\nreconciliation and extending the control of the \r\nGovernment over all Afghani regions. We also look \r\nforward to the international conference on Afghanistan \r\nto be held in Bonn next December.  \r\n Food security is one of the biggest challenges \r\nfacing the world today. It is estimated that in 2010 \r\nmore than 900 million people worldwide suffered from \r\nchronic hunger. The recent tragedy of famine in the \r\nHorn of Africa has demonstrated the urgent need for \r\nconcrete efforts on the part of the international \r\n A/66/PV.26\r\n \r\n9 11-51390 \r\n \r\ncommunity to ensure protection for the most \r\nvulnerable peoples in times of crisis. \r\n In a serious discussion of the issue of food \r\nsecurity, we cannot overlook the significance of water \r\nsecurity, especially in view of the fact that agricultural \r\nproduction consumes around 70 per cent of fresh water \r\nresources globally. My country therefore deems it \r\nimportant to include the issue of water scarcity and \r\nsecurity in future plans aimed at increasing food \r\nproduction worldwide. Living as we do in a region that \r\nsuffers from a scarcity of water, we are more aware of \r\nits importance, which prompts us to stress the need for \r\nthe international community to tackle this challenge \r\ndecisively and urgently. \r\n In December, my country will celebrate its \r\nfortieth anniversary. One of the major successes and \r\npositive indicators of human development that we have \r\nachieved has been the advancement and empowerment \r\nof Emirati women. With the support of our leadership \r\nand society, we have been able to arrive at the optimum \r\nbalance between our traditions and the demands of \r\ndevelopment and participation required to build our \r\nsociety. In this context, I would like to take the \r\nopportunity commend the establishment of the United \r\nNations Entity for Gender Equality and the \r\nEmpowerment of Women (UN-Women). In support of \r\nthis newly established and promising entity, the United \r\nArab Emirates hereby announces its contribution of \r\n$5 million to the UN-Women fund. \r\n In conclusion, we hope that our deliberations at \r\nthis session of the Assembly will contribute to the \r\npromotion and development of all forms of \r\nunderstanding, solidarity and international cooperation \r\naimed at addressing the global issues on our agenda. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Hamrokhon Zarifi, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Tajikistan. \r\n Mr. Zarifi (Tajikistan) (spoke in Russian): Allow \r\nme to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Nassir \r\nAbdulaziz Al-Nasser on his assumption of the post of \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth \r\nsession. I have every confidence that his wealth of \r\nexperience will contribute to the achievement of \r\nimportant results in our collective work. I would also \r\nlike to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon \r\non his reappointment as Secretary-General. \r\n Two weeks ago the people of Tajikistan \r\ncelebrated a solemn event in their modern history — \r\nthe twentieth anniversary of independence for the \r\nRepublic of Tajikistan. Despite numerous difficulties \r\nand challenges, the Republic of Tajikistan, during the \r\nyears of its independence, has succeeded in achieving \r\nconsiderable progress and laying a foundation for \r\ngradual social and economic development. We greatly \r\nappreciate the contributions made by the United \r\nNations and its Member States to the establishment and \r\ndevelopment of an independent, sovereign and \r\ndemocratic Tajikistan, governed by the rule of law. \r\n The maintenance of peace and security remains a \r\ntop priority for the entire international community. For \r\nthis reason, it is essential that Member States shoulder \r\ntheir due responsibilities and take the joint measures \r\nnecessary to bring a speedy halt to wars and conflicts. \r\nWe welcome the settlement in South Sudan and the \r\naccession of the Republic of the South Sudan as the \r\nnew, 193rd Member of the United Nations. Tajikistan \r\nalso calls on all parties concerned to maximize their \r\nefforts towards a speedy and full settlement of the \r\ncontinuing conflict in the Middle East. We support the \r\nState of Palestine in its efforts to take its well-deserved \r\nplace as a fully fledged member of the community of \r\nnations. \r\n The Government of Tajikistan, aware of its \r\nresponsibility for addressing social and economic \r\nissues, has been working consistently to maximize its \r\nown capacity to attain the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. Implementation of our national strategy for \r\ndevelopment of the Republic of Tajikistan is a key \r\npriority of our Government. Proceeding from \r\nprinciples of sustainable development for our economy, \r\nthe Government of Tajikistan has identified three major \r\ngoals: ensuring energy and food security, and tackling \r\nthe country’s isolation in terms of communications. \r\n International trade and direct investments can \r\nalso help in achieving our development goals. We \r\nbelieve that the international trade system must remain \r\nopen, fair, predictable and non-discriminatory. Guided \r\nby these principles, Tajikistan is currently in active \r\ntalks on joining the World Trade Organization (WTO). \r\nIn this regard, we are seeking the support of WTO \r\nmember States to help speed up the process of \r\nTajikistan’s entry. \r\n The problems of climate change and its negative \r\neffects cannot be overcome without the collective and \r\nA/66/PV.26  \r\n \r\n11-51390 10 \r\n \r\ncoordinated efforts of the entire international \r\ncommunity. We know that climate change affects fresh \r\nwater resources as well as exacerbating extreme floods, \r\nlandslides, droughts and other natural disasters. In \r\nTajikistan, where about 60 per cent of the water \r\nresources for the whole of Central Asia originate, more \r\nthan 35 per cent of glaciers have disappeared in the last \r\n30 years. The accelerated melting of glaciers creates \r\nadditional risks for sustainable development and \r\nregional water, energy and food security. In that regard, \r\nat the United National Climate Change Conference in \r\nCopenhagen, the President of Tajikistan put forward a \r\nproposal to set up an international fund for saving \r\nglaciers, which could combine the efforts of the \r\ninternational community in this strategically important \r\narea. We hope that Member States will support this \r\ninitiative. \r\n The comprehensive development of hydroelectricity, \r\ncombined with other types of renewable energy, will \r\nenable us not only to increase the capacity of our \r\nenergy systems but also to enhance their stability and \r\nincreased efficiency, and considerably decrease \r\nharmful emissions into the atmosphere. For more than \r\n10 years, the Republic of Tajikistan has experienced a \r\nsevere electric power shortage in winter. Owing to a \r\nlack of other energy sources, it is vital that Tajikistan, \r\nwhich possesses enormous hydropower potential, begin \r\nto undertake consistent, comprehensive development of \r\nits hydro-energy sector. \r\n Tajikistan is prepared to cooperate closely on all \r\nissues of the rational use of water and energy resources \r\nwith every country in the region and with due \r\nconsideration for common regional interests. This has \r\nbeen repeatedly emphasized by the President of \r\nTajikistan, Mr. Emomali Rahmon, including in the \r\nGeneral Assembly’s general debate at its sixty-third \r\nand sixty-fourth sessions, and in other international \r\nforums on the subject of water. \r\n As is well known, in the second half of the \r\ntwentieth century the Central Asian region was \r\nconfronted with a massive ecological crisis: the drying \r\nup of the Aral Sea. Wilful disregard for rational, \r\ncareful and responsible use of natural resources has led \r\nto the death, for all practical purposes, of the Aral Sea. \r\nThe enormous number of reservoirs that have been \r\nbuilt and continue to be built across vast areas \r\ndownstream of the Aral Sea have also contributed \r\nconsiderably to its drying up. The total water content \r\nof those reservoirs and bodies of water represents \r\n1.5 times the water content of the Aral Sea. \r\nOvercoming this crisis will require not just massive \r\ncapital investment in the water sector but also political \r\nwill and a readiness to implement long-term joint \r\nmeasures for the rational use of water and energy \r\nresources throughout the Aral Sea region.  \r\n It is for this reason that Tajikistan suggested that \r\nthe United Nations should carry out a comprehensive \r\nexpert study of water use in Central Asia, including on \r\nissues related to the effectiveness and rationality of the \r\nuse of existing reservoirs and an investigation of the \r\nenvironmental situation in the region as a whole. \r\n Water is a crucial resource of immense \r\nimportance to sustainable development and to life on \r\nour planet. We need to strengthen international and \r\nregional water cooperation through the effective use of \r\nexisting mechanisms and instruments. With that in \r\nmind, Tajikistan called for the proclamation of 2013 as \r\nthe International Year of Water Cooperation. \r\n Terrorism is one of the major threats to the \r\ninternational peace and security. Tajikistan condemns \r\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We \r\nbelieve that we must swiftly adopt a universal \r\nconvention on international terrorism.  \r\n The prevention of illicit drug trafficking is part of \r\nthe fight against terrorism. The urgency of this problem \r\nis a clear indication of the threat it poses to \r\ninternational stability and security. My country is \r\nmaking its contribution to the fight against the drug \r\ntrade. We have set up an anti-drugs body that \r\ncooperates with other international organizations and \r\nsimilar services of other States in taking measures to \r\nfight illicit drug trafficking in our region.  \r\n Tajikistan reiterates its commitment to the full \r\nand effective implementation of the Ottawa \r\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, \r\nProduction and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and \r\non Their Destruction. My country unreservedly \r\nsupports a mine-free Central Asia. We support the \r\nadoption of measures leading to the demining of mined \r\nareas and the tackling of other mine-related problems. \r\n Tajikistan is concerned at the situation in the \r\nneighbouring country of Afghanistan. It was with great \r\nsorrow that we learned of the tragic death of the former \r\nPresident of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, \r\nMr. Burhanuddin Rabbani. He was one of the most \r\nimportant figures in recent Afghan history and, indeed, \r\n A/66/PV.26\r\n \r\n11 11-51390 \r\n \r\nin the region and the world as a whole. We would like \r\nto express our heartfelt condolences to the people and \r\nthe Government of Afghanistan. \r\n Tajikistan supports the international strategy for a \r\ncomprehensive peace settlement in Afghanistan and \r\npost-conflict rehabilitation. We deem it important to \r\ninvolve Afghanistan in regional integration through \r\neconomic and trade cooperation with neighbouring \r\ncountries. I should like to recall the efforts of the \r\nDushanbe quartet — Afghanistan, Pakistan, the \r\nRussian Federation and Tajikistan — in favour of trade \r\nand economic cooperation, the fight against terrorism \r\nand the fight against drugs and organized crime. \r\n We have opened five bridges on the border \r\nbetween Tajikistan and Afghanistan, and three \r\nadditional bridges are being built. This year we also \r\nconstructed a 220-kilovolt power line linking Tajikistan \r\nand Afghanistan. We are seeking to address the issue of \r\nenergy shortages in Afghanistan and in Pakistan by \r\nbuilding up the hydro-electrical capacity of the Central \r\nAsian countries through the CASA-1000 project. \r\n The continued post-conflict economic development \r\nof Afghanistan is on the agenda of the fifth Regional \r\nEconomic Cooperation Conference on Afghanistan, to \r\nbe held next spring in Dushanbe. \r\n Global problems and regional challenges cannot \r\nbe addressed without a strengthened United Nations. \r\nThe process of reforming the United Nations must be \r\ncarried out in a rational manner, and the renewed \r\nUnited Nations must become a strong partner that is \r\nable to react to events across the world and rise to the \r\nmultiple global challenges that we face in this new age. \r\n Tajikistan will continue to assist the United \r\nNations in every possible way in its efforts to build a \r\npeaceful, secure and healthy planet. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. José Badia, Government \r\nCouncillor for External Relations and for International \r\nEconomic and Financial Affairs of the Principality of \r\nMonaco. \r\n Mr. Badia (Monaco) (spoke in French): Allow \r\nme at the outset to warmly congratulate Mr. Al-Nasser \r\non his election as President of the General Assembly \r\nand to assure him of the support of my delegation \r\nthroughout the sixty-sixth session of the Assembly.  \r\n The Secretary-General, whom I heartily \r\ncongratulate on his unanimous reappointment, \r\nintroduced, at the opening of the general debate, the \r\npriorities that he intends to implement during his \r\nsecond term in office. His vision, which will guide our \r\nendeavours and our deliberations during this period of \r\ninstability and uncertainty, sets forth the parameters for \r\na new form of global governance that will need to, on \r\nthe one hand, respond to the challenges that we face \r\nand to the aspirations of our peoples and, on the other, \r\ntake into consideration the new realities of our time. \r\n Among these new imperatives of the twenty-first \r\ncentury, sustainable development and the building of a \r\nsafer world require a more responsible approach on the \r\npart of all our Governments and the renewal of our \r\nunwavering support for the Organization, whose \r\ncrucial role in the prevention of conflicts, human rights \r\nviolations and natural disasters needs to be \r\nstrengthened and supported. \r\n It was Mr. Al-Nasser’s clear-sighted initiative to \r\nmake the role of mediation in the settlement of disputes \r\nby peaceful means the theme of the general debate. Our \r\ncommunity now has a new Member — the Republic of \r\nSouth Sudan — following a peace process that was \r\nwelcomed by all. Since the beginning of the year, we \r\nhave seen a great impetus towards freedom and \r\ndemocracy among thousands of women and men across \r\nthe Arab world. The Arab Spring has highlighted once \r\nagain the universal nature of the norms and values of \r\nthe Organization. Justice, democracy, human dignity, \r\nequality and freedom have led to renewed hope among \r\npeoples for too long repressed. Today we face a great \r\nchallenge: not to disappoint them. \r\n The Government of the Principality reiterates its \r\nsupport for and its solidarity with all who fight for \r\nrespect for fundamental freedoms and the rule of law, \r\nand in that regard is hopeful that a just, lasting and \r\ncomprehensive settlement will enable the State of \r\nIsrael and a viable, sovereign and democratic \r\nPalestinian State to live side by side in peace and \r\nsecurity. \r\n The past year has been rich in challenges for our \r\nOrganization. We have had to face great natural and \r\nhumanitarian disasters, emergency situations caused by \r\npeople and the fallout of the economic crisis. Each \r\ntime we turn to this Organization to safeguard \r\nhumanity’s shared assets, such as the environment, \r\nhealth and peace.  \r\nA/66/PV.26  \r\n \r\n11-51390 12 \r\n \r\n We also turn to the United Nations to protect our \r\ncollective security. The deadly attack a few weeks ago \r\non the United Nations offices in Abuja, the capital of \r\nNigeria, cruelly reminded us of the innumerable risks \r\nfaced by United Nations personnel across the world — \r\nin Côte d’Ivoire, Afghanistan, Iraq, Darfur, the Sudan, \r\neverywhere where the United Nations has saved lives \r\nor upheld rights. They sometimes pay the ultimate \r\nprice.  \r\n But our Organization has limited resources and \r\ncannot always deal with the multiplication of conflicts. \r\nWe must therefore focus above all on the prevention of \r\nconflicts. What is a better prevention measure than \r\ndevelopment? Last year from this same rostrum His \r\nSerene Highness Prince Albert II of Monaco reiterated \r\nthe Principality’s commitment to achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) (see \r\nA/65/PV.4). Monaco seeks to be a responsible, reliable \r\nand supportive partner, and its priorities continue to be \r\nimproving the quality of life of the most vulnerable \r\npeople. \r\n I wish to underscore the essential role of women \r\nin the prevention and settlement of conflicts and in \r\npeacebuilding. Women and girls must be at the centre \r\nof our development strategies. It is now an established \r\nfact that a society that guarantees equality between \r\nwomen and men and promotes the economic \r\nindependence of women is a more prosperous society. \r\nIf we wish women to be able to realize their potential \r\nin the economic sector, we need to get rid of obstacles \r\nsuch as discriminatory regulations. We need to ensure \r\nthat women have equal access to economic resources, \r\nparticularly to land, credit, science and technology, \r\nvocational training, information, communication and \r\nmarkets.  \r\n In this regard, the Principality of Monaco wishes \r\nto reiterate its support for UN-Women and its \r\nExecutive Director, Ms. Michelle Bachelet. \r\n It is our shared responsibility to show our \r\ncommitment in the crucial gathering of 2012 — the \r\ntwentieth anniversary of the Rio Earth Summit — and \r\nto create a solid basis for the comprehensive \r\ndevelopment of a green economy.  \r\n We are seeking to develop sources of renewable \r\nenergy, more environmentally friendly and healthy. But \r\nin the short term, we are not in a position to abandon \r\nnuclear energy or oil. As we have learned so painfully \r\nthrough the Fukushima accident, we do not know \r\nwhether one day it will be possible to fully control all \r\nthe risks involved in nuclear energy. We thus continue \r\nto burn hydrocarbons, sending their emissions into the \r\natmosphere. These pitfalls pose a great danger to our \r\ncollective security.  \r\n It is time to put an end to the ideological debates \r\nand the divides that separate us and that delay our \r\nefforts to implement a green economy. \r\n The Secretary-General proposed that we establish \r\na new generation of development objectives to succeed \r\nthe MDGs after 2015. The Principality of Monaco \r\nsupports that initiative, which aims to encourage the \r\ninternational community to set ambitious goals and to \r\nprovide the wherewithal to achieve them.  \r\n As part of its contribution to that endeavour, \r\nPrince Albert II wanted Monaco to contribute actively \r\nto the preparatory work for the United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development by organizing \r\nin the Principality, from 28 to 30 November 2011, a \r\nmeeting of high-level experts on the sustainable \r\nmanagement of oceans. His Serene Highness would \r\nlike to see the international community place the seas \r\nand oceans at the top of the political agenda at the \r\nforthcoming Earth Summit.  \r\n In spite of the development of a legal framework \r\nto govern activities in the oceans, the negative impacts \r\nof human activities on oceans and seas are becoming \r\nincreasingly visible. Marine pollution and \r\nunsustainable practices in the exploitation of marine \r\nresources are continuing to endanger marine \r\necosystems, to the detriment of future generations. \r\nClimate change has had a significant impact on oceans, \r\nleading to the phenomena of acidification, rising sea \r\nlevels and coral bleaching. Sustainable management of \r\nthe oceans is an essential pillar of the green economy. \r\n Stronger prevention measures, at the service of \r\nall Member States, both developed and developing, \r\nwill enable the Organization to carry out its role with \r\ngreater efficiency and flexibility. That requires the \r\nstrengthening of its institutions, taking greater account \r\nof the role of the General Assembly, balanced reform \r\nof the Security Council, increasing cooperation with \r\nregional organizations, enhanced interaction with civil \r\nsociety and private sector partnerships.  \r\n I wish to hail the leadership and political courage \r\nof His Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss, President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-fifth session, who \r\n A/66/PV.26\r\n \r\n13 11-51390 \r\n \r\nendeavoured to impose the moral force of the United \r\nNations before the eyes of the entire world.  \r\n The Principality of Monaco will not fail to work \r\nfor the improvement of global governance that our \r\ncommunity hopes and prays for. We share the \r\nconviction regarding the immense importance of the \r\nuniversal values upheld and defended by the \r\nOrganization, values to which future Members must \r\nadhere, as we have done.  \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Cuba.  \r\n Mr. Rodríguez Parrilla (Cuba) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): I am pleased to welcome the Government of \r\nSouth Sudan as a State Member of the United Nations. \r\nI also join the appeal by all African leaders for an \r\nurgent, effective and international response to the \r\nfamine in the Horn of Africa. \r\n While we are engaged in debate here, in Libya \r\nanother preventive war is taking place under the \r\npretext of protecting civilians. The United States and \r\nNATO, supposedly to avoid a massacre, launched a \r\nmilitary attack against a sovereign State without there \r\nbeing any threat whatsoever to international peace and \r\nsecurity. They unleashed a regime change operation. \r\nNATO imposed on the Security Council a dubious \r\nresolution authorizing  \r\n “Member States … acting nationally or through \r\nregional organizations or arrangements … to take \r\nall necessary measures … to protect civilians and \r\ncivilian populated areas under threat of attack” \r\n(resolution 1973 (2011), para. 4). \r\n Afterwards, NATO violated this same resolution \r\nin order to supply weapons, provide financing to one \r\nparty and deploy operatives and diplomatic personnel \r\non the ground. Now everybody has a better \r\nunderstanding of what the concept of responsibility to \r\nprotect means and how it can be used. In this war, in \r\naddition to the most advanced and lethal military \r\ntechnologies, the means of communication have been \r\nused as weapons of war by financial and media \r\nbusinesses, which are profiteering from the war and the \r\nreconstruction operations, as if they were agents of \r\ncrisis containment. \r\n As early as 21 February, Commander-in-Chief \r\nFidel Castro Ruz warned that NATO was irrevocably \r\npreparing a war against Libya. Since then, Cuba has \r\nengaged indefatigably in the defence not of a \r\nGovernment but of a principle. It is unacceptable to \r\nassassinate thousands of innocent people under the \r\ndubious purpose of protecting other civilians. History \r\nhas eloquently demonstrated that peace cannot be \r\nimposed either by war or by force. It is up to the \r\nLibyan people alone to choose their destiny, without \r\nforeign intervention, in the exercise of their right to \r\nself-determination, independence and sovereignty over \r\ntheir natural resources and their country’s territorial \r\nintegrity. \r\n The military intervention in Libya and the \r\ngrowing threat against Syria have been the \r\nopportunistic, defensive responses of the United States \r\nand Europe to the collapse of their system of \r\ndomination and plunder in North Africa and the Middle \r\nEast and to the emergence of genuinely popular \r\nmovements in Tunisia, Egypt and other countries, in \r\norder to secure huge reserves of oil and water and to \r\nconfiscate financial assets in times of global economic \r\nand social crisis. It is the responsibility of the General \r\nAssembly to exercise its full powers to prevent a \r\nmilitary aggression against Syria. The public should be \r\nhave objective information and speak up against war. \r\n President Barack Obama, in his threatening, \r\ndeceitful, rhetorical speeches of 20 and 21 September, \r\ndescribed what happened in Libya as a new model. He \r\nsaid,  \r\n “This is how the international community should \r\nwork in the twenty-first century. More nations are \r\nassuming the responsibility and the costs of \r\nmeeting global challenges. In fact, this is the very \r\npurpose of the United Nations. So every nation \r\nrepresented here today can take pride in the \r\ninnocent lives we saved and in helping Libyans \r\nreclaim their country. It was the right thing to \r\ndo.”  \r\n A top White House official wrote in Foreign \r\nAffairs magazine that the new United States strategy is \r\nmore efficient and less costly. The Bush Administration \r\nstrategy considered occupation; the Obama Administration \r\nstrategy is that of national liberation. The military \r\nintervention strategy in Libya could also be applied in \r\nother cases. \r\n With absolute cynicism, what is proposed is a \r\nmilitary aggression without casualties or the use of \r\ninfantry troops, the costs of which would be mainly \r\nborne by Europe. The destabilization of a country \r\nA/66/PV.26  \r\n \r\n11-51390 14 \r\n \r\nthrough subversion, covert operations and economic \r\nsanctions is described, according to this doctrine, as \r\nthe development of a national movement. That new \r\nregime-change operations model shows that current \r\nUnited States and NATO military doctrines are even \r\nmore aggressive than their previous ones, and that the \r\nso called Euro-Atlantic periphery comprises the entire \r\nplanet. \r\n No one should doubt that Latin America and the \r\nCaribbean are included in that concept. The \r\nredeployment of the Fourth Fleet, the installation of \r\nAmerican bases, troops and military means to intervene \r\nanywhere in the region, the coup d’état against \r\nVenezuela in 2002, followed by an oil coup, the \r\nsedition in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, the military coup in \r\nHonduras and the attempted coup in Ecuador all fit \r\nperfectly in the new strategy. \r\n Can the United States and NATO guarantee today \r\nthat the use of force and this concept of regime change \r\ndo not apply in the case of Latin American and \r\nCaribbean countries that do not submit to their \r\ninterests? Can the European Union say something \r\nabout it? What would the United Nations do in such a \r\nsituation? \r\n The weakness of the global economy, particularly \r\nthe economies of the United States and Europe, \r\ncontinues to show that the economic crisis that began \r\nin the year 2008 has not yet been overcome. In \r\ndeveloped countries, the terrible burden of its \r\nconsequences is borne by workers, the unemployed, \r\nimmigrants and the poor, who are brutally repressed \r\nwhenever they peacefully defend their rights. \r\n We, the countries of the South, repeatedly \r\nplundered, suffer the distortions of a world economic \r\norder that excludes our legitimate interests. We suffer \r\nunder the onerous impact of protectionism and the \r\nsteady increase in the prices of foodstuffs and \r\nhydrocarbons. The peoples of many developing \r\ncountries are victims of the bankrupt neoliberal \r\neconomic model and its sequel of plunder and \r\nexclusion. The social and political consequences are \r\nbeing felt on all continents. \r\n In the face of a global economic crisis and the \r\ndepletion of the planet’s natural resources, what will be \r\nthe response of the extremist right-wing forces that are \r\nalready in power or may come to power as a result of \r\nthe afflictions and hopelessness of voters? In the face \r\nof a growing and universal danger of war, of a new \r\ndivision of the world and of climate change, could we, \r\nthe countries of the South, act together as an essential \r\ncondition of our salvation?  \r\n In the face of so many serious threats, Latin \r\nAmerica and the Caribbean — the region of Bolívar \r\nand Martí — is coming together, determined to finish \r\nwhat they left unfinished. It is impossible to divide us \r\nor to turn us against each other. The Bolivarian \r\nAlliance for the Peoples of Our America is a small but \r\nmorally powerful group of peoples, and the new \r\nCommunity of Latin American and Caribbean States is \r\na fact. The full strength of the Andes will very soon be \r\nexpressed in a summit, which will be an epoch-making \r\nevent in Caracas — the epicentre of independence in \r\nthe Americas, where a Bolivarian people has conquered \r\npower and a continental leader, President Hugo Chávez \r\nFrías, is ever growing. \r\n More than ever, we have to defend the United \r\nNations, but the biggest challenge will be to turn it into \r\nan organization that serves the legitimate interests of \r\nall States, instead of catering to the arbitrary wishes \r\nand abuses of a few rich and powerful countries. We \r\nmust see to it that international law and the purposes \r\nand principles of the United Nations Charter prevail in \r\nthe face of the brute force that aims to block them. It is \r\nnecessary to re-establish the leading role of the General \r\nAssembly and to recast the Security Council.  \r\n The General Assembly has the inescapable moral, \r\npolitical and legal obligation to ensure the recognition \r\nof an independent Palestinian State, with the \r\nboundaries established before 1967 and with East \r\nJerusalem as its capital, as a full Member of the United \r\nNations. This should be accomplished with or without \r\nthe Security Council, with or without the veto of the \r\nUnited States and with or without new peace \r\nnegotiations. \r\n If the inalienable right of the Palestinian people \r\nto independence, sovereignty and self-determination is \r\nrecognized; if the need to re-establish the exercise of \r\nthe human rights of Palestinians is recognized; if the \r\nblockade of Gaza, the economic coercion and \r\nsegregation symbolized by the infamous wall are \r\nrecognized as crimes; if the subjugation of a nation to \r\nconditions jeopardizing its very existence is described \r\nas genocide; if all Member States are supposed to \r\nadopt all legal measures within their reach to protect \r\nPalestinian civilians, then the General Assembly should \r\ntake action now. \r\n A/66/PV.26\r\n \r\n15 11-51390 \r\n \r\n Cuba, a country with a small Jewish community, \r\ncondemns the historical injustice of anti-Semitism, the \r\ncrime against humanity that was the Holocaust, and \r\nrecognizes the right of the State of Israel to exist. Our \r\npeople harbour only fraternal feelings towards the \r\nIsraeli people, who are also victims of this conflict. \r\n Cuba likewise proclaims that the United States \r\nhas the moral, political and legal obligation to stop its \r\ncontinual veto of Security Council resolutions intended \r\nto protect the Palestinian civilians. \r\n The European Union should oppose this veto and \r\nabstain from supporting the empire’s brutal pressure on \r\nmembers of this Assembly and the Council itself. \r\nEurope should denounce it also because it is certain \r\nthat those crimes would not be occurring without the \r\nmilitary supplies, financial support and impunity that \r\nthe United States provides to the Government of Israel. \r\n On 11 September 2001, we Cubans shared the \r\npain of the American people at those atrocious terrorist \r\nacts. We offered selfless solidarity, encouragement and \r\ncooperation. As always, Cuba made crystal-clear \r\nstatements against terrorism and against war. \r\n Ten years later, the world is even more insecure, \r\nbecause instead of turning international consensus \r\nagainst terrorism into a system of international \r\ncooperation to confront it, the United States invaded \r\nand occupied Iraq and Afghanistan, causing the loss of \r\nlife of hundreds of thousands of persons and pain to \r\ntens of millions. It was not possible to hide the use of \r\ndeception, torture, extrajudicial executions or \r\nassassinations, disappearances of individuals, arbitrary \r\ndetentions and the secret renditions and prisons of the \r\nCentral Intelligence Agency in Europe and other \r\nregions. \r\n The Government of the United States desecrates \r\nthe memory of the victims of 11 September when it \r\ncontinues the prolonged inhumane imprisonment of the \r\nfive Cuban anti-terrorist fighters who were unjustly \r\ncondemned, in spurious trials, to sentences of \r\nmaximum severity for seeking information about the \r\nterrorist activities of groups that have operated with \r\nabsolute impunity from United States territory against \r\nCuba, leading to the death of or physical harm to 5,577 \r\nof our citizens. Once again, with all due respect, I urge \r\nPresident Obama to make use of his powers to release \r\nthem as an act of justice or as a humanitarian gesture, \r\nwhich would be highly appreciated by their children, \r\nwives, mothers, fathers and all of our people. \r\n The Cuban Government reiterates its interest and \r\nwillingness to move towards the normalization of \r\nrelations with the United States. Today I reiterate the \r\nproposal to begin a dialogue aimed at solving bilateral \r\nproblems, including humanitarian issues, as well as our \r\noffer to negotiate several cooperation agreements \r\nconcerning drug-trafficking, terrorism, human \r\nsmuggling, natural disasters and protection of the \r\nenvironment, including in the event of oil spills such as \r\nthe one that occurred at the British Petroleum platform \r\nin the Gulf of Mexico. \r\n However, we know that the electoral race has \r\nalready begun in this country, while the economic \r\nsituation is growing worse. \r\n The economic, commercial and financial \r\nblockade of Cuba has been tightened. The damages it \r\nhas caused have totalled $975 billion, based on the \r\ncurrent price of gold. The attempt to subvert the \r\nconstitutional order that Cubans have freely elected is \r\nintensifying. There is increasing pressure from the \r\nextreme right and the Cuban-American mafia to \r\nreverse the minimal steps adopted by the American \r\nGovernment to promote, to some degree, links between \r\nCuban émigrés and their home country and exchanges \r\nbetween both peoples. \r\n In Cuba, President Raúl Castro Ruz has reiterated \r\nthat we will continue, in our own sovereign way, to \r\nchange everything that needs to be changed in order to \r\nmake our economy more efficient and our socialism \r\nbetter, to achieve full justice and to be able to fully \r\npreserve our independence. \r\n As Martí said, “The southern sea will join the sea \r\nof the north and a serpent will hatch from the egg of an \r\neagle before we cease our struggle to make the \r\nhomeland free and prosperous.” \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Uri Rosenthal, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. \r\n Mr. Rosenthal (Netherlands): In May I visited \r\nTunisia, the cradle of the revolutions that have spread \r\nacross the Arab world. I spoke to many people there \r\nwho told me about their deep yearning for freedom, \r\nabout the decades during which their freedom had been \r\nsuppressed and about what the revolution meant for \r\ntheir lives. One of them was Essma Ben Hamida, the \r\nstrong-willed director of a civil society organization \r\nactive in micro-finance. She said literally to me, “If \r\nA/66/PV.26  \r\n \r\n11-51390 16 \r\n \r\ndemocracy would mean that I lose my rights as a \r\nwoman, I do not want democracy.” In one sentence, \r\nMs. Ben Hamida defined one of the key challenges we \r\nface. \r\n The call from the streets of the Arab world for \r\nfreedom and democracy has brought about great \r\nchange. It has inspired people around the world to \r\nclaim their rights.  \r\n But huge challenges remain. And the severe \r\nfinancial and economic crisis is threatening growth and \r\ntrade around the globe. This crisis is undermining \r\npeople’s ability to earn a living and enjoy freedom to \r\nthe fullest extent. It is thus crucial that we manage \r\nthese developments.  \r\n The United Nations and individual Governments \r\nmust support people’s calls for freedom. Freedom is a \r\nright for everyone, a duty for Governments and the \r\nmission of the United Nations. Freedom must be \r\nsupported by three key pillars: first, security; second, \r\ndemocracy and the rule of law; and third, prosperity. \r\n Lack of security is a fundamental threat to \r\npeople’s freedom. Providing security is a responsibility \r\nof Governments and of the international community as \r\na whole. \r\n In March this year, we rose to the challenge. \r\nSecurity Council resolution 1973 (2011) on Libya was \r\ntruly historic. It explicitly referred to the international \r\ncommunity’s responsibility to protect. It highlighted \r\nthe indispensable role of the United Nations. \r\n By contrast, the Council’s failure to reach \r\nconsensus on Syria has been at great human cost. \r\nEvery day we are shocked by new, horrific stories. This \r\nvery weekend peaceful demonstrators were carrying a \r\nsign that read: “Help Syria. It is bleeding.” We need to \r\nlisten to the people of Syria. We need to stop President \r\nAl-Assad’s Government from brutally murdering his \r\nown citizens in an attempt to crush their legitimate call \r\nfor freedom. I urge all members of the Security \r\nCouncil to act decisively and agree on targeted \r\nsanctions against the regime. \r\n Freedom and security are also key issues in the \r\nMiddle East peace process. If we do want peace, we \r\nneed direct negotiations now, not new resolutions at the \r\nUnited Nations. The Netherlands endorses the time \r\nframe outlined by the Quartet and stands ready to assist \r\nwherever it can. We are a major donor to the \r\nPalestinian Authority. We fully support the ambition of \r\nthe Palestinian people to build a viable, democratic and \r\npeaceful Palestinian State. However, this cannot be \r\nviewed separately from the Israeli people’s desire to \r\nlive in a secure, internationally recognized Jewish State \r\nin peace with their neighbours.  \r\n It is really essential that the two parties invest in \r\nmutual confidence, refrain from unilateral steps and \r\nfind a solution together. They should be prepared to \r\nmake the difficult and painful concessions necessary \r\nfor the fulfilment of their peoples’ aspirations. I talked \r\nwith President Abbas. I talked with Prime Minister \r\nNetanyahu. I listened carefully to what they had to say, \r\nand the message is simple and clear: negotiate, \r\nnegotiate, negotiate. \r\n Mr. Thomson (Fiji), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n Democracy and the rule of law are the best \r\nguarantees for freedom, but they require hard work. As \r\nFrancis Fukuyama put it, democracy is more than the \r\nmajority voting in elections. It is a complex set of \r\ninstitutions that restrain and regularize the exercise of \r\npower through law and a system of checks and \r\nbalances. That is what it is about.  \r\n I admire the tremendous courage that people, \r\nyoung and old, have shown to claim their individual \r\nliberty and democratic rights. We must support their \r\nefforts to build truly democratic societies governed by \r\nthe rule of law. The United Nations should play a \r\nleading role by helping with institution-building and \r\ndeveloping the rule of law. To that effect, Slovakia and \r\nthe Netherlands, for their part, are co-chairing the \r\nCommunity of Democracies’ task force that is \r\nsupporting Tunisia’s democratic transition. \r\n The international community should also support \r\ninternet access that is free and uncensored. This is an \r\nessential tool for people to exercise their freedom of \r\nexpression, and we should take great care to make sure \r\nthey can use it. Countries supporting this cause should \r\nreally unite around it. \r\n As Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon recently said, \r\n“Countries do not become fit for democracy; they \r\nbecome fit through democracy.”  \r\n Democracy means freedom and equal rights for \r\neveryone. It provides opportunities to empower \r\nwomen. Women represent 50 per cent of the world’s \r\nhuman capital. It is in every country’s own interest to \r\nensure that women take an active role in society and \r\n A/66/PV.26\r\n \r\n17 11-51390 \r\n \r\nthe economy as well as in the political process in the \r\npolitical power structures. I am convinced that in free \r\nand fair elections, extremists who want to take away \r\nwomen’s rights will not succeed.  \r\n Real democracy also means that the rights of \r\nreligious groups, including Christians, are respected. \r\nSociety as a whole should be tolerant towards those \r\nwith other religions and beliefs. There should be no \r\ndoubt about that. \r\n Freedom offers the best route to prosperity. The \r\nongoing global economic crisis is affecting prosperity \r\neverywhere in our world. \r\n Enabling free trade is vital to economic recovery. \r\nMarket access is crucial for private sector \r\ndevelopment. Breaking down the barriers to trade in \r\nagricultural products can galvanize entrepreneurship in \r\nthe countries that really need it the most. The Arab \r\nregion in particular should benefit from enhanced \r\nexport opportunities to the European Union.  \r\n The beauty of well-regulated free trade is that it \r\nis not a zero-sum game; it benefits everyone and it is \r\npart and parcel of freedom. This is why the World \r\nTrade Organization (WTO) Doha Round must succeed. \r\nThe world should not and cannot revert to \r\nprotectionism. The WTO has an important part to play \r\nin preventing this. The European Union is also \r\nambitiously negotiating free trade agreements with \r\nvarious partners. Of course, these agreements should fit \r\nwithin the multilateral system. \r\n Free trade leads to economic growth, which in \r\nturn should also benefit the poorest countries in this \r\nworld. To further support their growth, we should \r\nenhance their access to education, vocational training \r\nand microfinance for women and the poor. \r\n Freedom belongs to us all. Those who have \r\nfought to gain their freedom will never give it up. \r\nFreedom must be supported through security, \r\ndemocracy and the rule of law, and prosperity. We can \r\nachieve this through the efforts of Member States. \r\nSince the United Nations is the international forum \r\nwhere global issues and actors come together, it is here \r\nat the United Nations that we must join forces. We are \r\nwitnessing international developments unfolding more \r\nrapidly than ever before. The United Nations needs to \r\nadapt to maintain its important role in international \r\nrelations. \r\n For that matter, the Security Council should \r\nbetter reflect changing international relations and \r\neconomic realities. The Netherlands supports a modest \r\nenlargement of the Security Council, but with a limit \r\non the right of veto in order not to undermine the \r\neffectiveness of the Council’s decision-making process. \r\n The Netherlands supports the Secretary-General’s \r\ndrive for budgetary discipline. We have to make careful \r\nchoices about what to finance and what not to. I also \r\nurge emerging economies to take their share of \r\nresponsibility for the sustainability of United Nations \r\nfunding. \r\n The United Nations has an essential role in \r\nfostering the rule of law around the world, as well as in \r\npreventative diplomacy and mediation. The Netherlands \r\nwill play its part, including through the role of The \r\nHague as the international city of peace and justice. \r\nThe Peace Palace, the international courts and the legal \r\ninstitutions attest to our long tradition of international \r\nlaw and active role in its practice. That tradition, may I \r\nsay, goes back to Grotius’s early seventeenth-century \r\nMare Liberum, which laid the foundation for \r\ninternational law. \r\n I would like to congratulate Secretary-General \r\nBan Ki-moon on his reappointment. I call on him to \r\nuse the overwhelming support for his second term as a \r\nmandate to reform the United Nations. A strong and \r\nactive United Nations is essential in a world in which \r\nno country can shape the future single-handedly. To \r\nsucceed, public support for the United Nations is \r\ncrucial. Clear and tangible results are necessary to \r\nsustain the commitment of Governments to the United \r\nNations. An effective and efficient United Nations is in \r\nthe national interests of all its Member States, and is, \r\nindeed, essential for freedom throughout the world. \r\n Through our efforts at the United Nations, we can \r\nsupport the calls for freedom around the world. Then, \r\non my next visit to Tunisia, Essma Ben Hamida, a \r\nstrong-willed woman, can hopefully tell me that \r\nfreedom has brought her both democracy and her rights \r\nand empowerment as a woman. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Ali Ahmed Karti, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Republic of the Sudan.   \r\n Mr. Karti (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): It is indeed \r\nan honour and a source of pride to see our sister State \r\nof Qatar represented in the good person of the \r\nA/66/PV.26  \r\n \r\n11-51390 18 \r\n \r\nPresident leading this year’s session of the General \r\nAssembly. His election was certainly the right choice \r\ngiven his commendable initiatives and contributions to \r\nmaintaining peace and security, both regionally and \r\ninternationally, which bear out his qualifications and \r\ncapabilities. Indeed, we congratulate him on assuming \r\nhis post. Through you, Sir, may I also convey my \r\ncongratulations and gratitude to Mr. Joseph Deiss, \r\nPresident of the Assembly at its sixty-fifth session.  \r\n We would also like to congratulate His Excellency \r\nthe Secretary-General on his reappointment. We commend \r\nhim and his colleagues on their admirable efforts in the \r\nvarious areas in which the Organization is active. We \r\nhope that our deliberations this year will benefit \r\nhumankind and serve to promote peace, harmony and \r\ncooperation among peoples and nations.  \r\n I address the Assembly today as the Sudan \r\napproaches the international community with new \r\nmomentum, having recently provided an exemplary \r\nmodel in choosing peace and stability, even though \r\ntheir price entailed sacrificing a dear part of our \r\ncountry’s territory. During the past six years, the \r\ninternational community has followed the Government \r\nof the Sudan’s degree of commitment to the choice of \r\npeace through the implementation of the \r\nComprehensive Peace Agreement, which we concluded \r\nand signed on 9 January 2005.  \r\n Despite the obstacles and challenges facing the \r\nimplementation of the Agreement from the start, we \r\nhave continued to implement it with perseverance and \r\npatience. That culminated in the holding of the \r\nreferendum on the self-determination of South Sudan \r\nand, eventually, the acceptance of its result. We were \r\nthe first country to recognize the nascent Republic of \r\nSouth Sudan, extending a hand of cooperation and \r\nbrotherhood to it.  \r\n The international community has also followed \r\nthe historic visit that our country’s President, Mr. Omer \r\nHassan Al-Bashir, paid to the city of Juba prior to the \r\nholding of the referendum, as well as his participation \r\nin the celebrations declaring the establishment of the \r\nState of South Sudan on 9 July. His address on that \r\noccasion outlined the guiding principles that \r\nestablished the basis of our warm and friendly \r\nrelations, discarding the negative atmosphere and \r\nbitterness of the past and looking towards the broader \r\nhorizons of cooperation and communication that serve \r\nthe interests of that country’s brotherly people. From \r\nthis rostrum, we reiterate our commitment to that spirit. \r\nWe also reiterate our congratulations to the State of \r\nSouth Sudan as it takes its place among the Members \r\nof the United Nations.  \r\n Allow me to take this opportunity to welcome the \r\nNational Transitional Council as the legitimate \r\nrepresentative of the brotherly people of Libya at the \r\nUnited Nations, following the revolution that Libya \r\nexperienced and the changes it has brought about. \r\n The separation leading to the establishment of the \r\nindependent State of South Sudan does not mean a \r\ndefinitive divorce, in particular as we live in an era of \r\nglobalization and State alliances and groupings that \r\ntranscend political boundaries and traditional \r\nframeworks. Moreover, until recently our two peoples \r\nwere one, connected by common denominators and \r\nvarious historical, cultural and social ties. \r\n Given those facts, we are resolute in our full \r\ncommitment to settling all outstanding issues with \r\nregard to the implementation of the Comprehensive \r\nPeace Agreement, including the situation in the Abyei \r\nregion, in order to complete the border demarcation \r\nand the necessary joint measures and mechanisms \r\nrequired to monitor the border and address economic \r\nissues, including access to oil and oil revenues.  \r\n We also affirm that we are committed to reaching \r\nsecurity and political arrangements that address all the \r\nrecent tensions in Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile \r\nstates. As I have said before, we accepted the choice of \r\nseparation not because we were bored with unity, for \r\nwe had paid dearly for that unity, but because we \r\nwanted sustainable peace and stability. It is therefore \r\nunacceptable and irrational to accept any proxy war \r\nthat destabilizes those two states, or any other border \r\narea between them. That will require understanding of \r\nthe joint vision that takes into account the special \r\ncharacteristics of the demographic character of the \r\nregion and the interaction among the tribes in those \r\nareas. \r\n With regard to the situation in Darfur, the most \r\nrecent peace negotiations in the sisterly State of Qatar \r\nconcluded with the signing of the Doha Document for \r\nPeace in Darfur, which was accepted and supported by \r\nthe various groups in Darfur. That support was \r\nevidenced by the broad participation in the all-Darfur \r\nstakeholders conference, which was held in May and \r\nattended by representatives of internally displaced \r\npersons, civil society and leaders from the legislative, \r\n A/66/PV.26\r\n \r\n19 11-51390 \r\n \r\npolitical and executive branches, as well as tribal and \r\npolitical party leaders, elders and local administration. \r\nThe conference adopted the Doha Document for Peace \r\nin Darfur because it responded to all of the aspirations \r\nof the people of Darfur in terms of peace, development, \r\nstability, justice and political participation. As the \r\nAssembly is aware, the Document has received \r\nconsiderable support from the international community.  \r\n I wish to take this opportunity to reiterate our \r\nappreciation to our sister State of Qatar, the African \r\nUnion and the League of Arab States, which \r\nspearheaded this initiative. We also wish to thank the \r\nJoint Mediation Support Team and all regional and \r\ninternational partners who contributed to the \r\nagreement. From this rostrum, I again emphasize that \r\nwe will continue to implement our national strategy on \r\nDarfur on the basis of its five pillars: security, \r\ndevelopment, the resettlement of refugees and \r\ninternally displaced persons, internal reconciliation and \r\na comprehensive political settlement. We will give top \r\npriority to completing the return of internally displaced \r\npersons and refugees and to creating stable conditions \r\nfor them through development, rehabilitation and \r\nreconstruction projects.  \r\n We expected the Secretary-General to include a \r\nspecial paragraph in his statement to illustrate my \r\nGovernment’s commitment to peace, which was \r\nevident from the signing of the Comprehensive Peace \r\nAgreement and the declaration of the Republic of \r\nSouth Sudan, which my Government was first to \r\nrecognize as a State. We call on our international \r\nOrganization not to be hoodwinked by the policies of \r\nsome countries, which refuse to give credit where it is \r\ndue. The Sudanese leadership, headed by President \r\nOmer Hassan Ahmad Al-Bashir, enabled the people of \r\nthe South to exercise their right to self-determination. \r\nIt made a commitment to do so because of its desire for \r\npeace and stability. Consequently, it is a leadership that \r\ndeserves respect and appreciation, not to be the target \r\nof attempts at incrimination or of the arbitrary levelling \r\nof accusations, for example, by the International \r\nCriminal Court.  \r\n I need not recall the fact that the President is the \r\nleader of the Republic of the Sudan and was \r\nlegitimately elected in fair and transparent elections \r\nconducted under the supervision of international and \r\nregional bodies. Moreover, the unilateral and \r\nunjustified economic sanctions adopted by the United \r\nStates of America against the Sudan in order to weaken \r\nit and erode its development revival are but unjust and \r\ncoercive measures against the people of the Sudan. \r\nThis is happening at a time when we aspire to have the \r\nsupport of the international community as we move \r\ntowards that goal more openly and with greater \r\ndetermination to fulfil our natural role as an active and \r\npioneering member of the international family.  \r\n As a State emerging from conflict, we look \r\nforward to the contribution of the international \r\ncommunity and its financial institutions in terms of \r\ndebt forgiveness and support for development projects. \r\nThat would be consistent with the measures being \r\napplied to all least developed countries, as well as to \r\nthose emerging from conflict and moving into \r\npeacebuilding, which has now become a reality. The \r\nWorld Bank has put forward these and other \r\nrequirements, and has stated that my country has \r\nindeed demonstrated compliance in that regard. \r\n Similarly, from this rostrum, we call on all \r\ninvestors, without exception, to try to benefit from the \r\nSudan and its promising resources, especially those \r\nother than oil, such as mineral resources and metals. \r\nWe urge them to invest in the Sudan’s agricultural \r\nresources, taking into consideration the extent of the \r\ncountry’s arable land and its significant water \r\nresources. This is particularly important in the light of \r\nthe food crises, famines resulting from drought and \r\ndesertification, and the urgent global need for cereals \r\nand grains. The Sudan’s investment law has provided \r\nall necessary facilities to all foreign investors. \r\n The international financial and economic crisis \r\nhas adversely affected most countries of the world. In \r\nthe countries of Africa, the crisis has notably \r\nintensified and exacerbated the difficulties plaguing the \r\neconomies of developing nations, resulting in increased \r\npoverty and food shortages and the decline of social \r\nservices.  \r\n At a time when climate change is leading to \r\nnatural disasters in many countries, I call on the \r\nGeneral Assembly, all donors and the relevant United \r\nNations agencies, funds and programmes to respond \r\nurgently to the devastating famine and the attendant \r\ntragic humanitarian situation, which is affecting some \r\nof our sister republics in the Horn of Africa, in \r\nparticular Somalia. \r\n We also wish to highlight the importance of \r\ngiving issues affecting the African continent a high \r\npriority on the development agenda of the United \r\nA/66/PV.26  \r\n \r\n11-51390 20 \r\n \r\nNations, with a view to supporting and building the \r\ncapacities of African economic institutions. This could \r\nbe accomplished by reactivating the New Partnership \r\nfor Africa’s Development initiative. Priority, support \r\nand financing should be given to projects aimed at \r\ncombating poverty and endemic diseases on the \r\ncontinent, as well as to the relevant programmes linked \r\nto the achievement of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals.  \r\n Since development and peace go hand in hand, \r\nwe wish to emphasize the importance of supporting the \r\ninstitutions of the African Union, especially its Peace \r\nand Security Council and its other various mechanisms, \r\nto build early-warning conflict prevention capacities. I \r\nneed not mention that Chapter VIII of the United \r\nNations Charter clearly emphasizes the importance of \r\nregional arrangements in strengthening and \r\nmaintaining international peace and security.  \r\n We also wish to emphasize the importance of \r\nactivating preventive diplomacy mechanisms and \r\nAfrican peacemaking efforts. I refer in particular to the \r\nexperience of the Panel of the Wise of the African \r\nUnion, headed by former South African President \r\nThabo Mbeki, which is playing a commendable role in \r\nthe Sudan. This attests to the effectiveness of the role \r\nof regional bodies in settling disputes and achieving \r\npeace and security in African countries. \r\n The Sudan had hoped for international consensus \r\non climate and environment issues, in particular \r\nbecause we have been directly affected by them, as has \r\nclearly been the case in Darfur. United Nations reports \r\nhave emphasized the relationship between the negative \r\nimpact of climate change and the intensification of \r\nconflict, especially on the African continent. We had \r\nalso hoped that the efforts made in Copenhagen would \r\nhave been successful and led to an agreement on how \r\nto address this phenomenon and avoid its negative \r\nconsequences.  \r\n We had hoped, too, that developed nations would \r\nassume their historic responsibilities in that regard by \r\nadopting specific strategies and action plans to tackle \r\nthe root causes of climate change in a manner \r\nconsistent with the Rio Declaration on Environment \r\nand Development, adopted at the Earth Summit in \r\n1992. The Sudan attaches the highest priority to the \r\nimplementation of a series of national programmes \r\ndesigned to alleviate the consequences of climate \r\nchange and to raise awareness as to its dire effects. \r\n The Sudan looks forward to participating actively \r\nand effectively in the United Nations Conference on \r\nSustainable Development to be held next year, in order \r\nto help strengthen international efforts to face the \r\nchallenges of sustainable development with a \r\ncollective will that reflects the aspirations of the whole \r\nworld, developing nations in particular, for \r\ndevelopment and a decent life for their peoples. \r\n Various entities of the United Nations, including \r\nthe Security Council, have adopted dozens of \r\nresolutions regarding the question of Palestine, none of \r\nwhich have been implemented. This is because of \r\nIsrael’s blatant defiance of the international community \r\nand because of the support and protection it enjoys \r\nfrom some powerful countries. This demonstrates that \r\nthe Organization is incapable of standing up for the \r\nrights of peoples and to support their legitimate claims, \r\nas enshrined in the Charter. That has given the green \r\nlight to the occupying authorities to continue with their \r\nsettlement policies that seek to entrench the occupation \r\nand banish the Palestinian people, the owners of the \r\nland. \r\n The Sudan therefore fully supports the \r\nPalestinian National Authority’s decision to request full \r\nmembership of the United Nations, which is their legal \r\nright, based on the right to self-determination, one of \r\nthe principles of international law. Moreover, the \r\nPalestinians’ request for recognition as a State is a \r\nlegitimate right that seeks to confirm that, first, the \r\nUnited Nations is committed to its Charter and, \r\nsecondly, to international law. This would also help to \r\nalleviate tensions in the region. The international \r\ncommunity should consider the fact that there may be \r\nno one to negotiate with if it allows Israel to impose \r\nconditions on the world and to deprive the Palestinians \r\nof their legitimate rights. \r\n In conclusion, the reform of the United Nations, \r\nand in particular of the Security Council, is an urgent \r\nand compelling priority requiring speedy action. \r\nWithout efforts to reform the Organization and its \r\nvarious entities, we will weaken the role of developing \r\nnations and have a negative effect on their national \r\ninterests. This will also allow bodies such as the \r\nSecurity Council to become a channel through which \r\nparticular countries impose their own political agendas, \r\nespecially with regard to international peace and \r\nsecurity. Genuine reform of the Security Council and \r\nits working methods is therefore the only way to \r\nprevent it from being exploited by some countries in a \r\n A/66/PV.26\r\n \r\n21 11-51390 \r\n \r\nmanner that could cast doubt on the credibility and \r\nneutrality of the Organization, whose founders \r\ncarefully drafted its Charter so as to make it the widest \r\npossible forum for consultation and debate — debate \r\nthat requires cooperation and interaction among \r\npeoples, nations, cultures and civilizations in order to \r\ncreate a world in which values such as freedom, peace, \r\nsecurity and justice can prevail. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Manuel Salvador dos Ramos, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs and Communities of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe. \r\n Mr. Salvador dos Ramos (Sao Tome and \r\nPrincipe) (spoke in Portuguese; English text provided \r\nby the delegation): The Democratic Republic of Sao \r\nTome and Principe joins other speakers at this global \r\nforum in congratulating the President on his election to \r\nlead the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. \r\nHis election is the acknowledgment by Member States \r\nof the more than 30 years’ experience that he and his \r\ncountry, Qatar, have given in service of promoting \r\ninternational peace and security, sustainable \r\ndevelopment and dynamic, multidimensional \r\ncooperation among developing countries, as well as in \r\ncontinuing the search for solutions to the challenges \r\nfacing multilateral diplomacy today. \r\n We also congratulate the President on the \r\nsignificance of the theme of this session, “The role of \r\nmediation in conflict resolution through peaceful \r\nmeans”, whose relevance and timeliness merit the \r\nattention of all of us here and can help ensure that the \r\noutcome of our collective discussions will support the \r\nUnited Nations in its effective guidance of global \r\ndemocratic governance and in implementing coherent \r\nand consistent mechanisms aimed at achieving lasting \r\npeace and a more secure world. \r\n We further congratulate Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his \r\nreappointment to the post of Secretary-General, and \r\nthank him for the effort and skill with which he has \r\nguided the Organization, whose challenges and \r\nresponsibilities seem more pressing than ever in the \r\ncurrent international context. We would also like to pay \r\ntribute to the outgoing President, Mr. Joseph Deiss of \r\nSwitzerland, who carried out his duties with zeal and \r\ndedication during the past year. \r\n The theme of this session of the Assembly gives \r\nus an opportunity to reflect deeply together on the \r\nimpact of international mediation on the resolution of \r\nconflicts in various regions of our planet. We would \r\nlike to bring to this reflection a discussion of the \r\ncentral role that the United Nations should play in \r\nmediating such conflicts. This exercise should help us \r\nformulate concrete proposals for strengthening the \r\ncapabilities of our Organization in this area. \r\n Mediation as a method of resolving conflicts \r\nbetween States began to be used in 1907 in the form of \r\ngood offices and mediation on the basis of The Hague \r\nConvention for the peaceful regulation of international \r\nconflicts. United Nations reports on peacekeeping \r\noperations should therefore remind us that the \r\nrestoration of peace focuses on ongoing conflicts and \r\nstrives to de-escalate them through diplomacy and \r\nmediation. The widespread use of international \r\nmediation to resolve crises as a fundamental technique \r\nof peaceful conflict resolution has not always matched \r\nour expectations or produced the expected results. \r\n It is for that reason that Sao Tome and Principe \r\nbelieves that rather than settling for its role in \r\npeacekeeping, international mediation must evolve to \r\nbecome a fundamental factor in peacebuilding. In that \r\nregard, the United Nations should be responsible for \r\ndealing with what appears today to be a trend towards \r\nthe professionalization of international mediation, \r\nwhich relegates to the background the legal \r\ninstruments ratified by specialized institutions to deal \r\nwith a given conflict. Defining the legal status of the \r\nmediator and the methodology of mediation, as well as \r\ngreater involvement by diplomats and experts with \r\nexperience in international law, seems to us to be \r\nnecessary and important steps that the United Nations \r\nshould take in the future. \r\n The State of Sao Tome and Principe has followed \r\nwith concern the growing international climate of \r\ntension, characterized by proliferating claims in \r\nvarious regions, some of them violent and destructive. \r\nOur concern is all the more worrisome given our \r\ndistinct feeling that in such circumstances the \r\nmechanisms available to the United Nations for dealing \r\nwith such matters effectively and accurately are pushed \r\ninto the background. We regret the absence of a \r\nresponsible partnership between the African Union and \r\nthe Security Council designed to resolve the crisis in \r\nLibya. \r\n It is therefore urgent that we strengthen the role \r\nof the United Nations by reforming the entire \r\nsystem — a process that should not drag on. This \r\nA/66/PV.26  \r\n \r\n11-51390 22 \r\n \r\nreform should include the Security Council and some \r\nof the specialized agencies of the United Nations, \r\naligning them with the aspirations and demands of the \r\nmodern world. \r\n On 9 July, Africa saw the birth of one more free \r\nand independent nation: the Republic of South Sudan. \r\nThe Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe, \r\nwhich has already recognized the brotherly State of \r\nSouth Sudan, congratulates its people on this \r\nachievement and wishes its leaders every success in \r\nbuilding a peaceful and prosperous nation. Similarly, \r\nwe appeal to the entire international community to \r\nmake a joint effort to support the new authorities and \r\npolitical actors of that country in order to maintain the \r\nnational sovereignty of the new State and to promote a \r\nclimate of national unity and political stability. \r\n East Africa is facing a serious food crisis caused \r\nby phenomena that are beyond the control of men and \r\nby the political and military conflict still raging in \r\nparts of Somalia. It is incumbent upon us all to \r\ncontribute without delay to finding a lasting solution to \r\nthis serious situation. The Government of Sao Tome \r\nand Principe proclaims its readiness to participate in \r\nactivities contributing to the alleviation of the suffering \r\nof the people of that region. We join other Members of \r\nthe United Nations in appealing to the international \r\ncommunity to provide more financial resources to \r\nsupport efforts to normalize the situation in the region. \r\nIn the particular case of Somalia, we would appeal for \r\nan increase in official development assistance. \r\n The United Nations is still addressing the pending \r\nquestion of the Western Sahara and has adopted several \r\nresolutions aimed at settling the conflict between the \r\nKingdom of Morocco and the Frente Polisario. Sao \r\nTome and Principe would like to see the two parties sit \r\nat the negotiating table and urges the United Nations to \r\nproceed with the population census, in accordance with \r\nits own resolutions, with a view to completing this long \r\nprocess of negotiation. \r\n Democracy has the virtue of giving a voice to \r\npeople so they can choose their leaders through \r\npopular, free, direct and transparent elections by secret \r\nballots cast in voting booths. The uprisings that started \r\nin January in North Africa have expressed the \r\nsentiments and will of the people of Tunisia, Egypt and \r\nLibya to turn the page of their contemporary history. It \r\nis in this conviction that the Democratic Republic of \r\nSao Tome and Principe recognizes the new governing \r\nauthorities in these countries as legitimate \r\nrepresentatives of their peoples.  \r\n We welcome the presence of the National \r\nTransitional Council within the United Nations, and \r\nurge the authorities of that country to conduct an \r\ninclusive process of peaceful transition to ensure \r\npeace, stability and social progress in that part of \r\nAfrica. Furthermore, our country is of the view that \r\npolitical changes should take place not under violent \r\ncircumstances, but without any pressure or political \r\ninterference. \r\n The Middle East continues to be shaken by an \r\nunprecedented wave of conflicts within the borders of \r\nsome Middle Eastern countries as well as in the \r\nbroader region. The people of Syria, Yemen and \r\nBahrain have demanded reforms in State institutions. \r\nHowever, we see the Israeli-Palestinian conflict \r\ncontinue. We reaffirm our support for the Palestinian \r\npeople’s right to guide their destiny, and we advocate, \r\nin accordance with the relevant United Nations \r\nresolutions, for the existence of a Jewish State. We take \r\nthis opportunity to appeal to the Government of the \r\nUnited States of America and the European Union to \r\nexert their influence to persuade the Government of the \r\nState of Israel to stop building settlements in the \r\noccupied territories. \r\n The trade embargo imposed on Cuba decades ago \r\nis a major concern for our countries, and for Sao Tome \r\nand Principe in particular. We urge the lifting of the \r\nsanctions so that Cuba can participate on equal footing \r\nwith other States in the process of building an \r\ninternational society that is more balanced and fair. \r\n Global security is vital to the sustainable \r\ndevelopment of our countries. The threats emerging in \r\nthe world today — particularly transnational crime, \r\npiracy, trafficking and the sale of weapons and \r\ndrugs — are a real source of concern for Sao Tome and \r\nPrincipe, a country with extensive sea borders in the \r\nGulf of Guinea. These phenomena are threats that \r\ncannot be ignored and require greater interaction with \r\nthe Member States with which we share these extensive \r\nmaritime borders. They also require our commitment to \r\nconflict prevention, management and resolution \r\nmechanisms, based on efforts to fight organized crime \r\nand with a view to ensuring our collective security. \r\n In this connection, we highlight the fact that the \r\n32nd meeting of the United Nations Standing Advisory \r\nCommittee on Security Questions in Central Africa, \r\n A/66/PV.26\r\n \r\n23 11-51390 \r\n \r\norganized by the United Nations Office for \r\nDisarmament Affairs through its Regional Centre for \r\nPeace and Disarmament in Africa in Lomé, was held in \r\nSao Tome and Principe in March. \r\n On behalf of the Government of the Democratic \r\nRepublic of Sao Tome and Principe, I would like to \r\nthank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his timely \r\nand correct decision to give Africa its own central \r\nOffice, which we believe will contribute greatly to the \r\npromotion and development of actions to prevent, \r\nmanage and resolve conflicts in the region and will \r\nassist countries of the region in coping with possible \r\nthreats to their sovereignty. \r\n The profound changes wrought in the \r\ninternational political scene, resulting from structural \r\nchanges in the world economy, pose new challenges to \r\ncountries like Sao Tome and Principe. My country, a \r\nmicro-island State, advocates greater access to the \r\nvarious opportunities available at the international \r\nlevel, in particular the possibility of obtaining more \r\nofficial development assistance and facilities to attract \r\nforeign investment. \r\n It is our collective responsibility to take measures \r\nto address the harmful effects of climate change and \r\nensure the continuity of the clean development \r\nmechanism, particularly for the least developed \r\ncountries. We appreciate the political willingness of \r\nMember States to further pursue the building of the \r\nnecessary consensus to achieve significant and legally \r\nbinding results in Durban, South Africa, at the next \r\nConference of the Parties to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change, thus \r\nguaranteeing the second commitment period of the \r\nKyoto Protocol. \r\n However, climate change has caused imbalances \r\nin the microclimate of our country, with drastic \r\nconsequences for our domestic production, thereby \r\nthreatening the food security in Sao Tome and Principe. \r\nFrom this perspective, and in order to combat this \r\nscourge, civil society in Sao Tome has been advocating \r\nthe need to enhance the study of the causes and adverse \r\neffects of climate change in Sao Tome and Principe. To \r\nfulfil this goal, the authorities of my country would \r\nlike to continue to rely on the invaluable collaboration \r\nand availability expressed thus far by the international \r\ncommunity in general and the specialized entities of \r\nthe United Nations in particular. \r\n I cannot end this speech without addressing the \r\nsituation of the two straits.  \r\n Taking into account that has Taiwan not only \r\nenormous potential, but also a population of around \r\n23 million people, its participation in United Nations \r\nspecialized agencies, as has been the case since 2009 \r\nwith respect to the World Health Assembly, could make \r\na substantial contribution to the international \r\ncommunity. In this regard, we urge the relevant United \r\nNations bodies to seek ways and means to ensure the \r\nparticipation of Taiwan in some of the mechanisms and \r\nagencies of the United Nations system, in particular the \r\nInternational Civil Aviation Organization and the \r\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange. \r\n The Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and \r\nPrincipe has just concluded the consolidation of its \r\ndemocratic process and transition of power through an \r\nelection by universal suffrage, which was direct and \r\nanonymous. The President-elect took office on \r\n3 September. Domestically, our Government is working \r\nto reduce poverty and promote economic growth and \r\ninstitutional reform, particularly in the area of justice, \r\nin order to strengthen the capacities of the country’s \r\ndemocratic institutions and development. \r\n With regard to the Millennium Development \r\nGoals set by the United Nations for 2015, the \r\nDemocratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe has \r\nmade significant progress, particularly in the areas of \r\neducation and health. We recognize, however, that \r\ngreater efforts should be made to attain the desired \r\nobjectives. In that regard, our State wishes to continue \r\nto benefit from the continued and multifaceted support \r\nof the international community. \r\n To conclude, I would like to reiterate the \r\nreadiness of the Government of the Democratic \r\nRepublic of Sao Tome and Principe to participate in \r\nefforts to mobilize our collective will and our synergies \r\nin pursuit of the noble principles and objectives that \r\nunderpin the creation of the United Nations. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Mohamed Mouldi Kefi, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Tunisia. \r\n Mr. Kefi (Tunisia) (spoke in Arabic): First, I \r\nwould like to extend to Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser \r\nand our brotherly country, Qatar, my sincere \r\ncongratulations on his election as President of the \r\nA/66/PV.26  \r\n \r\n11-51390 24 \r\n \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. We are \r\ndeeply confident that he will contribute actively to the \r\nsuccess of its work. I would also like to express my \r\ngratitude and appreciation to Mr. Joseph Deiss for his \r\nlaudable and tireless efforts as President at the \r\npreceding session of the Assembly.  \r\n I take this opportunity to again congratulate \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon on his reappointment \r\nto a second term. We are ready and determined to \r\nprovide all possible support to ensure the success of \r\nthe plan, to be announced in the coming weeks, \r\ndetailing his vision of the priorities of the Organization \r\nover the next five years. \r\n On behalf of my country, Tunisia, I would like \r\nalso to welcome the sisterly Republic of South Sudan \r\nto the United Nations and wish the new State \r\nprosperity and progress and its leaders great success in \r\ntheir noble mission. \r\n Allow me to pay tribute from this rostrum to the \r\nmemory of the martyrs and youths of Tunisia’s valid \r\nand peaceful revolution, a revolution for freedom and \r\ndignity that brought the Arab Spring to the world. This \r\nhistoric event infused new hope into the conscience of \r\nhumankind, which yearns for justice and democracy \r\nand places the highest value on freedom and human \r\nrights. \r\n This spontaneous revolution — which had no real \r\npolitical or ideological leadership and did not involve \r\nany foreign intervention — has indeed succeeded in \r\nputting an end to one of the most dictatorial regimes in \r\nour region. The revolution exposed its practices and \r\nthose of similar regimes, which in their hysterical lust \r\nfor power blocked all political views, stifled freedom \r\nof expression and deprived young people of their hope \r\nfor a better future, self-fulfilment and effective \r\nparticipation in political, economic and social life. \r\n What happened in Tunisia is but the natural \r\noutgrowth of decades of tension and frustration. At the \r\nsame time, it expressed the aspirations of its people to \r\nlive in dignity and freedom. It was a decisive turning \r\npoint in the country’s history that enabled us to regain \r\nour natural place in the community of nations and \r\npowers. It exemplified the strength of the common \r\nhuman values of freedom, democracy, tolerance, equal \r\nopportunities and respect for human rights, in all of \r\ntheir aspects. \r\n Today, having removed all obstacles to its \r\npolitical, economic, social and cultural progress, \r\nTunisia is at a turning point in its history and is on the \r\nthreshold of a new stage. It yearns for the \r\nestablishment of a genuine democracy, founded on \r\nstrong guarantees that uphold the people’s sovereignty \r\nand enable them to exercise their rights and determine \r\ntheir destiny in a political system that is truly \r\npluralistic and that enjoys peaceful transition of power, \r\nin accordance with the objectives of the glorious \r\nrevolution and the faithful memories of our brave \r\nmartyrs. \r\n In seeking to achieve the goals of the revolution, \r\nthe provisional Tunisian Government has made every \r\neffort to preserve all mechanisms needed to restore \r\nstability and security in the country, ensure the \r\ncontinuity of the State and its institutions and protect \r\nthe interests of all segments of society.  \r\n We have therefore created the Higher Authority \r\nfor the Protection of the Revolution, Political Reform \r\nand Democratic Transition. It brings together a range \r\nof political views and orientations, as well as \r\nrepresentatives of civil society and national \r\norganizations. It has been entrusted with drawing up a \r\nroad map to ensure a successful transitional period in a \r\nconsensus-based and harmonious atmosphere. \r\n The work of the Higher Authority, along with the \r\nconsultations it held with the various national parties, \r\nresulted in a balanced and integrated plan of action \r\nfrom the legal and practical perspectives. This strategy \r\nwill map out Tunisia’s political future in accordance \r\nwith the aspirations of its people for a democratic, \r\npeaceful and quiet transition. \r\n The main features of this strategy were evidenced \r\nin the interim President’s decision to suspend the \r\nTunisian Constitution, dissolve the two chambers of \r\nParliament and establish a provisional public \r\nadministration comprised of an interim President and a \r\nprovisional Government. This Government, whose \r\ncompetence and integrity are well known, will be \r\nresponsible for running national affairs until a national \r\nconstituent assembly is elected. The latter will draft a \r\nnew constitution and establish a legal framework for \r\nthe upcoming transitional period and thereby gain \r\ncredibility in the eyes of the people. \r\n Important strides have thus been made in \r\npreparations for the national constituent assembly \r\nelections, to be held on 23 October. We will spare no \r\n A/66/PV.26\r\n \r\n25 11-51390 \r\n \r\neffort to enable the Tunisian people to elect their \r\nrepresentatives in a popular, free, pluralistic, \r\ntransparent and fair fashion. \r\n We have established an independent higher \r\nnational authority to monitor the various stages of the \r\nelectoral process and have endowed it with the \r\nnecessary legal foundations and financial support so \r\nthat it can fulfil its mission independently and \r\neffectively under the best possible conditions. This \r\nhighlights the fairness of our national approach and the \r\nclear vision of the political actors involved. \r\n In that respect, it is worth recalling that for the \r\nfirst time in its history, Tunisia has adopted by \r\nconsensus the principle of mandatory parity in its voter \r\nregistries. That will enable us to maximize the potential \r\nof Tunisian society, men and women alike, and to \r\npreserve the well-deserved position held so \r\ncompetently by women in the fabric of Tunisian \r\nsociety. My colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof the Netherlands, made a comment in that regard a \r\nfew minutes ago.  \r\n In parallel with the progress made in the political \r\nfield, the provisional Government is pursuing its \r\ncomprehensive reforms in all sectors and fields. \r\nUpholding human rights and protecting public \r\nfreedoms are the Government’s highest priorities. \r\n Tunisia believes deeply in the universal values of \r\nsolidarity, justice and international cooperation. In that \r\nrespect, we urgently appeal to the entire international \r\ncommunity, including Governments, international and \r\nregional organizations and civil society activists, to \r\nlend their support to our country’s efforts to repatriate \r\nthe assets stolen from the Tunisian people by the \r\nformer President and all of his family members and in-\r\nlaws. The Tunisian people have the right to those funds \r\nand are in urgent need of them during this critical \r\nperiod fraught with tremendous economic and social \r\nchallenges. \r\n Tunisia also calls on all States that have received \r\nrequests for extradition of persons involved in those \r\ncrimes to respond positively to those legitimate \r\nrequests. That will allow Tunisian justice to hold \r\naccountable all those who committed crimes against \r\nthe Tunisian people, within the framework of a fair \r\ntrial that guarantees the rights of the defendant under \r\nTunisian law and international instruments. \r\n We thank the friendly, kindred countries that have \r\nresponded favourably to those requests. We hope that \r\nall States will efficiently and swiftly respond to \r\nTunisia’s requests, pursuant to the noble principles of \r\ninternational cooperation and solidarity and to ensure \r\nthat the values of justice, equality and fairness before \r\nthe law will be respected by all. \r\n The Government of Tunisia, with the support of \r\nnational and international economic actors, has \r\nresponded to the challenges generated by the delicate \r\npost-revolutionary situation, including its negative \r\neffects on our national economy. Humanitarian and \r\neconomic conditions related to the crisis in sisterly \r\nLibya have further complicated the situation and \r\nhampered our Government’s task. Creating jobs, \r\nreducing the unemployment rate and eliminating social \r\nand economic disparities have become major \r\nchallenges of the country. \r\n Tunisia has been endowed with many national \r\nassets that will enable us to achieve our goals. We face \r\nnumerous challenges in our endeavours for a \r\ndemocratic transition and for economic and social \r\ndevelopment, including the economic recession, which \r\nis apparent in certain areas. Therefore our country \r\nremains in need of continuous support and assistance \r\nfrom the international community. \r\n I would like to seize this opportunity to convey \r\nmy special thanks to the Group of Eight and the \r\ninternational and regional financial institutions that did \r\nnot hesitate to support Tunisia’s democratic transition \r\nand economic revival processes, especially within the \r\nframework of the Deauville Partnership. I would also \r\nlike to thank United Nations bodies, regional groups \r\nand friendly and sisterly countries for their precious \r\ncontributions, whether in assisting the successful \r\ndemocratic transition or reducing the impact of the \r\neconomic crisis in Tunisia and its social repercussions.  \r\n I also welcome the seminal efforts of States and \r\norganizations alike for their assistance in responding to \r\nthe massive influx of hundreds of thousands refugees \r\ninto Tunisia following the events that occurred in \r\nkindred Libya. Tunisia’s deep integration into its \r\nregional and international surroundings is a top priority \r\nfor our foreign policy, which we are keen to develop \r\nthrough good relations with all States and \r\norganizations, based on cooperation, mutual respect, \r\ngood-neighbourliness and respect for common \r\ninterests. \r\nA/66/PV.26  \r\n \r\n11-51390 26 \r\n \r\n Tunisia considers relations with its immediate \r\nneighbours — the countries of the Arab Maghreb \r\nUnion — especially important. We reiterate our call for \r\nresumed coordination among all of the Union’s \r\nmember States to initiate a new phase of promoting \r\nintegration through the establishment of durable and \r\njoint institutions, mainly in development and the \r\neconomy, for the benefit of all of the peoples of our \r\nregion. \r\n In speaking of our Maghreb region, I take the \r\nopportunity to pay tribute also to the kindred Libyan \r\npeople and to reiterate the warm respect and \r\ncongratulations of the Tunisian people for their \r\nvictorious revolution. It represents a crucial, historic \r\nchange in the region that will pave the way for the \r\nemergence of a democratic political system in Libya. \r\nThose developments will have a profound, positive \r\nimpact on Tunisian-Libyan relations and on the \r\nestablishment of the Arab Maghreb Union. \r\n As an Arab, Islamic and African country, Tunisia \r\nremains proud and deeply attached to its various \r\norigins. It will continue to support the political and \r\nregional organizations and groupings of which it is a \r\nmember, as well as its economic and development \r\npartnerships. \r\n Tunisia will remain faithful to mutual action \r\nwithin the Arab forum and to supporting the issues of \r\nconcern to the League of Arab States, including the \r\ncause of Palestine.  \r\n Tunisia reaffirms its unwavering and principled \r\nposition in support for its Palestinian brothers and \r\nsisters and for their request for full recognition as a \r\nState Member of the United Nations, as expressed by \r\nthe President of the Palestinian Authority, \r\nMr. Mahmoud Abbas, before the Assembly this past \r\nFriday (see A/66/PV.19). Tunisia thus calls on the \r\ninternational community to support the legitimate \r\nPalestinian bid for full membership in the United \r\nNations, as well as its territorial integrity as an \r\nindependent State within legally recognized borders, \r\nwith the Holy City of Jerusalem as its capital. At the \r\nsame time, Tunisia strongly condemns the unjust \r\nembargo imposed by Israel on the Gaza Strip and its \r\nrecent military aggression there, which resulted in \r\nmany innocent victims.  \r\n While congratulating the kindred Egyptian people \r\nfor their young peoples’ successful revolution based on \r\ntheir legitimate aspirations for freedom and dignity, \r\nTunisia expresses its hope that peace and stability will \r\nbe restored in Syria and Yemen in order to meet the \r\naspirations of their peoples for democracy, freedom \r\nand reforms. In parallel, Tunisia reaffirms its rejection \r\nof any attempt to exploit the situation in those two \r\nfriendly countries. Tunisia reiterates its call to end the \r\nIsraeli occupation of the Syrian Golan and the \r\nremaining occupied Lebanese territories, in accordance \r\nwith international law. \r\n As an African country, Tunisia attaches particular \r\nimportance to its geographic position in the continent \r\nand to its belief in the importance of geographic \r\nintegration and strengthened cooperation and solidarity \r\nwith the sisterly African countries. Tunisia remains \r\nfaithful to enhancing this belief while reaffirming \r\nrespect for the principles and objectives of the African \r\nUnion and its unwavering support for all initiatives \r\naimed at promoting development in the continent and \r\npreserving its peace and stability and its capabilities. \r\n Given the strategic importance of its relations \r\nwith the European Union, Tunisia will further enhance \r\nthose relations with an eye to establishing a closely \r\nknit partnership based on mutual respect and common \r\ninterests. Here, Tunisia expresses its hope that the \r\nEuropean Union and all of the friendly European \r\ncountries will be among the first to support the \r\nTunisian people and to assist them in the successful \r\nimplementation of their transitional phase in the \r\npolitical, financial and economical sectors.  \r\n Tunisia will also strengthen cooperation in its \r\nrelations with the countries and the peoples of the \r\nMediterranean under the Union for the Mediterranean.  \r\n Our country attaches a particular importance also \r\nto fostering its relations with Australia, Latin American \r\nand the Asian countries, as well as with their major \r\nregional groups, within the framework of an open and \r\nbalanced foreign policy approach aimed at establishing \r\na multifaceted partnership. \r\n Tunisia will strive to re-establish its position \r\nwithin the United Nations in a way that reflects its \r\npeoples’ awareness and aspirations as well as its rich \r\nhistory and positive contributions in its international \r\nrelations. In that context, we highlight our commitment \r\nto the principles of international law and international \r\nlegitimacy and call for launching the process of \r\nreforming the United Nations, mainly through \r\nenlargement of the Security Council’s membership in \r\n A/66/PV.26\r\n \r\n27 11-51390 \r\n \r\norder to ensure permanent representation of the African \r\ncontinent. \r\n Tunisia’s provisional Government welcomed the \r\nconvening by the General Assembly, in July 2011, of \r\nthe High-level Meeting on Youth and its outcome \r\ndocument (resolution 65/312), which contains \r\nimportant recommendations reflecting the aspirations \r\nof young people throughout the world and based on the \r\nawareness that unemployment had become a universal \r\nphenomenon and thus one of the major challenges. We \r\nreiterate our call to all concerned parties to develop a \r\nglobal strategy to fight unemployment. \r\n While organizing the elections to the National \r\nConstituent Assembly next October is a priority for our \r\ncountry, we reiterate our adherence to regional and \r\ninternational commitments and responsibilities. We \r\nreaffirm our work, as a peace-loving country, for \r\ninternational legality and to uphold the principles and \r\nvalues of the United Nations. We are determined to \r\nplay an active and vital role in international relations, \r\nin line with the aspirations of our people, who have \r\nconducted a peaceful revolution to recover their rights, \r\nfreedom and dignity. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. R.M. Marty M. Natalegawa, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia. \r\n Mr. Natalegawa (Indonesia): Allow me, Sir, to \r\ncongratulate His Excellency Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz \r\nAl-Nasser on his election to preside over the Assembly \r\nat the sixty-sixth session. Let me also commend his \r\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss, for his \r\nleadership in guiding us over the Assembly’s sixth-fifth \r\nsession. May I take this opportunity to congratulate \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon on his reappointment. \r\n Indonesia would also like to welcome South \r\nSudan as a Member of the United Nations.  \r\n Our world continues to be full of challenges, \r\npolitical and military tensions and conflicts, as well as \r\nthreats of nuclear weapons and of acts of piracy and \r\nterrorism. There is the financial and economic crisis. \r\nWorse and more fundamental still, in many corners of \r\nthe world there is abject poverty and hunger, \r\nenvironmental threats and natural disasters, energy and \r\nfood insecurity, intolerance and discrimination. There \r\nare authoritarian regimes bent on suppressing the \r\nclamour for democracy and respect for human rights. \r\n We believe that in convening in this historic Hall, \r\nas we do every year, we must seek more than simply to \r\nreview the past year, to lament opportunities lost and to \r\ncongratulate ourselves on the gains made. Rather, we \r\nmust ensure that, moving forward, as nations we stand \r\nunited — United Nations — in addressing and \r\nanticipating the challenges ahead.  \r\n In particular, we must stand united in \r\ntransforming challenges into opportunities for nations \r\nto forge mutually beneficial partnerships, anchored in \r\nthe principles of the United Nations Charter. We must \r\nchange challenges into opportunities to promote a new \r\nkind of international relations that accentuates \r\npartnership rather than confrontation, and that places \r\nprimacy on the building of bridges rather than the \r\ndeepening of fault lines and divisions, and on nations \r\naggressively waging peace and development. \r\n Waging peace and development in the Middle \r\nEast must, first and foremost, entail correcting the \r\nhistoric injustice to the Palestinian people that has been \r\nallowed for too long. Indonesia’s support for the \r\nlegitimate aspirations and rights of the people of \r\nPalestine to live in freedom, peace, justice and dignity \r\nin their own homeland has been steadfast and will \r\ncontinue unabated. \r\n Indonesia therefore strongly supports Palestine’s \r\npresent quest for full membership in the United \r\nNations. Such membership is consistent with the vision \r\nof the two-State solution and of a just and \r\ncomprehensive peace in the Middle East. Indeed, the \r\nrecent heightened worldwide focus on the issue of \r\nPalestine can, and must, be channelled in a \r\nconstructive way towards the promotion of an inclusive \r\npartnership among nations that leads to the fulfilment \r\nof the historic responsibilities shouldered by our \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n The continued denial of the most basic rights of \r\nthe Palestinian people becomes all the more glaring in \r\nthe face of the welcome democratic transformation that \r\nis under way in parts of North Africa and the Middle \r\nEast. Like many, Indonesia has been deeply concerned \r\nby the untold losses and casualties suffered by innocent \r\ncivilians. The bloodshed and use of force must be \r\nbrought to an immediate end, for, ultimately, political \r\nsolutions must be found. That means that conditions \r\nconducive for people to shape their own future must be \r\npromoted. Thus in Libya, for example, Indonesia \r\nA/66/PV.26  \r\n \r\n11-51390 28 \r\n \r\nsupports the National Transitional Council in its efforts \r\nto promote a peaceful and democratic transition. \r\n A decade or so ago now, Indonesia too went \r\nthrough a tumultuous process of democratic change. \r\nToday, as the third largest democracy, Indonesia is \r\nreaping the democratic dividends of such change. That \r\nis why we believe that political development and \r\ndemocratization should constitute a priority item on \r\nour agenda, to allow States to share lessons learned and \r\nexperiences in their unique paths towards \r\ndemocratization. That is why we took the initiative of \r\nlaunching the Bali Democracy Forum — the only \r\nintergovernmental forum for the sharing of experience \r\nand cooperation on political development in Asia. It is \r\na forum for partnership in the promotion of democracy. \r\n Global partnership is particularly key in \r\naddressing the challenges of development in order to \r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals and to \r\nprevent the recurrence of famine, which we are \r\ncurrently witnessing in the Horn of Africa. Thus we \r\nmust act in concert and in a focused and sustainable \r\nway to ensure food security for the most vulnerable. \r\nThat means increased investment in the agricultural \r\nresearch and development sector and increased \r\nproduction and productivity. \r\n I wish to highlight one particular driver of \r\neconomic growth and development. An enhanced role \r\nfor women in the economy is not only right, but also \r\nsmart, leading to both increased growth and more \r\nbalanced, sustainable and equitable growth. \r\n Achieving food security also requires that we \r\nconfront the reality of climate change. The \r\ninternational community must find the political \r\ncommitment to generate momentum for climate \r\nchange, towards a new climate regime after 2012. The \r\nforthcoming seventeenth Conference of the Parties to \r\nthe Climate Change Convention in Durban and the \r\nRio+20 Conference on Sustainable Development in \r\nBrazil next year must deliver. \r\n However, let us not wait. In Indonesia, we are \r\ncommitted to being proactive and to being part of the \r\nglobal solution to climate change. Through the REDD-\r\nplus programme — Reducing Emissions from \r\nDeforestation and Forest Degradation — we are using \r\nour natural rainforests as an important part of our \r\nmitigation efforts. \r\n Our commitment to work in partnership in \r\naddressing climate change must not founder before the \r\nlooming and renewed threat of the global financial and \r\neconomic crisis. In the face of that challenge, we must \r\ntake bold measures. The reform of international \r\nfinancial and economic governance must be expedited. \r\nEnhanced coordination of national economic policies is \r\nessential. We must learn to step out of our comfort \r\nzone and address those critical needs in concert. As \r\nemerging economies are now an important engine of \r\nglobal economic growth, they must have a greater \r\nopportunity to contribute to promoting solutions. \r\n The challenges confronting us are persistent and \r\nformidable, but we have the opportunity and the \r\ncapacity to address them and, most of all, to turn \r\nchallenges into opportunities. For a start, since those \r\nchallenges defy national solutions, they can at the same \r\ntime motivate countries to strike partnerships and build \r\ncooperation. In that regard, allow me to highlight two \r\nbasic points. \r\n First, we need to strengthen multilateralism in \r\norder to address global challenges. That means the \r\ncentral role of the United Nations. To be able to \r\naddress new and emerging challenges, and, not least, to \r\nidentify new opportunities, full support for and reform \r\nof the United Nations are key. That is the only way that \r\nthe United Nations can remain relevant and to ensure \r\nthat multilateralism flourishes. \r\n Through reform, we must ensure that the United \r\nNations and its decision-making processes are more \r\neffective, efficient, transparent and inclusive. We must \r\npersevere in strengthening the General Assembly, the \r\nEconomic and Social Council and their subsidiary \r\norgans, as well as the Human Rights Council. We must \r\nsupport the Peacebuilding Commission as it helps \r\ncountries emerging from conflict. \r\n The Security Council must better reflect the \r\ncurrent world situation. It should become more \r\nrepresentative, more transparent and, thus, more \r\neffective. All key issues of United Nations reform \r\nshould be addressed as integral parts of a \r\ncomprehensive package. \r\n Secondly, cooperation and partnership between \r\nthe United Nations and regional organizations are key \r\nto addressing today’s global challenges. Thus, there \r\nshould be synergy between global and regional efforts. \r\nThat is particularly true in conflict prevention and \r\nresolution, linked to the theme of this year’s General \r\n A/66/PV.26\r\n \r\n29 11-51390 \r\n \r\nAssembly session, “The role of mediation in the \r\nsettlement of disputes by peaceful means”. \r\n In South-East Asia, as Chair of the Association of \r\nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Indonesia has \r\nworked ceaselessly to develop the region’s capacity to \r\nprevent and to manage potential conflicts, and to \r\nresolve them. Our efforts have been focused not only \r\non the further development of ASEAN’s conflict \r\nprevention and resolution mechanisms, but also on \r\ndeveloping and nurturing the necessary comfort level \r\namong ASEAN member States to resort to such \r\nmechanisms. \r\n As a result, we expect South-East Asia to remain \r\na net contributor to international peace and security, as \r\nwell as to economic development and prosperity. \r\nBeyond its own subregion, anchored in a strong \r\nASEAN Community, we are indeed set to attain those \r\nachievements by 2015. ASEAN continues to be the \r\ndriving force in promoting a regional architecture \r\nthroughout Asia-Pacific that is conducive to the \r\nmaintenance of regional peace and stability, which is \r\nprecisely the kind of conditions that have enabled \r\ncountries in the region to pursue a development path \r\nuninterrupted by wars and conflicts. \r\n In the current regional setting, in Indonesia we \r\ndescribe that as conditions that are marked by a \r\ndynamic equilibrium, where dominant power is absent \r\nowing to a lack of the promotion of block politics and \r\noften self-fulfilling geopolitical fault lines. Rather, \r\nthere exists a new kind of international relations, with \r\nits emphasis on common security, common prosperity \r\nand common stability. \r\n This November, a revamped East Asia Summit \r\nwill convene in Bali, Indonesia, with the participation \r\nof the Russian Federation and the United States for the \r\nfirst time. That will be part of an important regional \r\narchitecture. \r\n As ASEAN builds its Community and continues \r\nits central role in maintaining a stable and peaceful \r\nenvironment in the Asia-Pacific region, it sets a new \r\nchallenge and a new vision for itself, that is, to develop \r\ngreater cohesion and a common platform on global \r\nissues ─ an ASEAN that is a net contributor to the \r\nsolution of many of the world’s ills and challenges. \r\nThat is in keeping with ASEAN’s theme for 2011, \r\n“ASEAN Community in a Global Community of \r\nNations”. \r\n To conclude, I wish to assure Members of the \r\nUnited Nations that Indonesia will be relentless and \r\nunceasing in promoting the ideals embodied in the \r\nCharter of the United Nations in promoting peace. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. John Baird, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of Canada. \r\n Mr. Baird (Canada): Nearly 66 years ago, in \r\n1946, one of my predecessors was privileged to \r\nrepresent Canada at the first session of the General \r\nAssembly. It is an honour to follow in those footsteps \r\nand to renew Canada’s commitment to the founding \r\nprinciples of the United Nations, namely, to maintain \r\ninternational peace and security; to prevent and \r\nremove threats to peace; to suppress acts of aggression; \r\nto respect the principle of equal rights and the self-\r\ndetermination of peoples; to strengthen universal \r\npeace; and to promote and encourage respect for \r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms for all. This \r\nHall symbolizes the promise of humankind and what \r\nwe can accomplish by working together to uphold \r\nthose founding principles. \r\n Yet, only a short distance from here is an entirely \r\ndifferent symbol ─ ground zero. The date 9/11 was a \r\nstark reminder that evil exists, that life is fragile, that \r\nfreedom has enemies, and that the poison of radical \r\nterrorism is all too real. It serves as a reminder that, as \r\nfar as humankind has advanced, threats to peace, \r\nsecurity and human dignity remain. \r\n In that context, I wish to share reflections on \r\nthree areas: first, the principles that motivate Canada’s \r\napproach to foreign policy; secondly, the basis for \r\nCanada’s support of multilateral organizations and \r\nmultilateral action; and thirdly, a way forward for the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n The founding principles of these United Nations \r\nare more than mere words. It is our duty to pull them \r\nfrom the printed page, to breathe life into them and to \r\npractise them every day. In everyday practice, it is not \r\neasy to uphold principles. It requires struggle and \r\nsacrifice. Some pay the ultimate price. \r\n The world remembers Secretary-General Dag \r\nHammarskjöld, who was killed 50 years ago this \r\nmonth. We honour him for his integrity, his principles \r\nand for his great courage in confronting power. We also \r\nremember that it was Canada’s Prime Minister, John \r\nDiefenbaker, who, just a year earlier, stood at this very \r\nA/66/PV.26  \r\n \r\n11-51390 30 \r\n \r\nrostrum to respond to unjust attacks against him. \r\nCanada did not hesitate to defend the Office and the \r\nperson of the Secretary-General. \r\n That is the Canadian tradition — standing for \r\nwhat is principled and just, regardless of whether it is \r\npopular, convenient or expedient. Over the past \r\ncentury, the world was infected by a lethal combination \r\nof utopian ideology and brutal despotism that spawned \r\ntotalitarian regimes that enslaved their own peoples. \r\nApologists tried to persuade us that the ideology of \r\nCommunism was benign. Canadians knew better. We \r\ntook a stand for freedom and fundamental human \r\nrights. We stood against oppression in Germany and in \r\nUkraine. We stood with its brave people, and those of \r\nthe other captive nations of central and Eastern Europe. \r\n Canada does not go along in order to get along. \r\nWe will go along only if we go in a direction that \r\nadvances Canada’s values: freedom, democracy, human \r\nrights and the rule of law. Also, Canada would not go \r\nalong to support the farce of a major proliferator of \r\nnuclear arms presiding over the Conference on \r\nDisarmament. When North Korea relinquished the \r\npresidency, we resumed our engagement in the \r\nConference. Canada’s tough economic sanctions \r\nagainst that rogue regime remain in place, and we \r\ncontinue to advocate and advance reform in how the \r\nPresident of that important body is selected. \r\n We would not go along with appeasement of the \r\nformer Al-Qadhafi regime, nor would we look the other \r\nway when the Lockerbie mass murderer received a \r\nhero’s welcome and the Colonel’s embrace. We would \r\nnot look the other way as the Al-Qadhafi regime, \r\nblatantly disregarding human rights and the rule of law, \r\nwaged war on the people of Libya. \r\n Canada backs our principles with action: \r\nproviding military support to NATO’s Operation \r\nUnified Protector; recognizing the National Transitional \r\nCouncil as Libya’s transitional Government; co-founding \r\nthe Libya Contact Group; and giving early, strong and \r\ncontinuing support to the Libyan people’s struggle \r\nagainst tyranny. \r\n Canada would not simply go along or look \r\nelsewhere when the Al-Assad regime started killing \r\nSyrian men, women and children in a despicable and \r\ndesperate attempt to cling to power. We imposed tough \r\nsanctions on the regime and its backers. \r\n Canada will not go along with a double standard \r\nthat castigates some United Nations Members for \r\nalleged failings, while ignoring the notorious abuses of \r\nothers. We supported the aspirations of those peoples \r\nwho sought brighter futures for themselves and their \r\ncountries during the Arab spring that has just passed. \r\n However, we will not go along with the unilateral \r\nactions of the Palestinian Authority. Just a few days \r\nago, the Quartet laid the foundation for a return to \r\nnegotiation. Our Government’s position has been \r\nclear — the only solution to the issue is one that is \r\nnegotiated by the two parties themselves. We continue \r\nto encourage both sides to accept those principles and \r\nto return to direct talks, based on a two-State solution, \r\nwithout delay or precondition.  \r\n We uphold Israel’s right to exist. We uphold its \r\nfundamental right, like any Member State, to defend \r\ninnocent civilians against acts of terrorism. Just as \r\nFascism and Communism were the great struggles of \r\nprevious generations, terrorism is the great struggle of \r\nours. Far too often, the Jewish State is on the front line \r\nin our struggle and its people are the victims of terror. \r\n Canada will not accept or stay silent while the \r\nJewish State is attacked for defending its territory and \r\nits citizens. The Second World War taught us all the \r\ntragic price of going along just to get along. It was \r\naccommodation and appeasement that allowed Fascism \r\nto gather strength. As Winston Churchill said, an \r\nappeaser is one who feeds a crocodile, hoping it will \r\neat him last. \r\n We respect State sovereignty, but Canada will not \r\ngo along or look the other way when a minority is \r\ndenied its human rights or fundamental freedoms. It is \r\nour common duty to uphold the rights of the afflicted \r\nand to give a voice to the voiceless.  \r\n As citizens of the global community, we have a \r\nsolemn duty to defend the vulnerable, to challenge \r\naggression and to protect and promote human rights \r\nand human dignity, at home and abroad: women, \r\nChristians, Baha’i and other victims of persecution in \r\nIran; Roman Catholic priests, other Christian clergy \r\nand their laity, driven to worship underground in \r\nChina; Christians being driven out of Iraq by Al-Qaida; \r\nand Copts being assaulted and killed in Egypt. In \r\nBurma, the regime discriminates against several forms \r\nof Buddhism and restricts the activities of Muslims. In \r\nother places, the Ahmadiyya community faces real \r\nviolence. Gays and lesbians are threatened with the \r\n A/66/PV.26\r\n \r\n31 11-51390 \r\n \r\ncriminalization of their sexuality in Uganda, and other \r\nminorities are subjected to persecution, oppression or \r\nviolence. Our nationalities are many but we share one \r\nhumanity. \r\n I am pleased to report that Canada will be \r\ncreating an office of religious freedom within our \r\nGovernment at the heart of my own Department. The \r\noffice will promote freedom of religion and of \r\nconscience as key objectives of Canadian foreign \r\npolicy. The long history of humankind has proved that \r\nreligious freedom and democratic freedom are \r\ninseparable. As Franklin Roosevelt observed on the eve \r\nof global war,  \r\n “[w]here freedom of religion has been attacked, \r\nthe attack has come from sources opposed to \r\ndemocracy. Where democracy has been \r\noverthrown, the spirit of free worship has \r\ndisappeared. And where religion and democracy \r\nhave vanished, good faith and reason in \r\ninternational affairs have given way to strident \r\nambition and brute force”.  \r\n That brings me to Canada’s support of \r\nmultilateral institutions and multilateral action. Some \r\nyears ago, a former Secretary-General referred to \r\nenlightened multilateralism as the guarantor, not the \r\nenemy, of State sovereignty and the integrity of State. \r\nState sovereignty is not created by multilateral \r\ninstitutions. Instead, multilateral institutions exist and \r\nderive legitimacy from the independent decisions of \r\nsovereign States. \r\n Canada’s position in that regard was explained by \r\nour Prime Minister just last year. Referring to \r\nmultilateral action to address the world economic \r\ncrisis, Stephen Harper said that he saw world \r\nleadership, at its best, as a glimpse of a hopeful future \r\nwhere we act together for the good of all; the world we \r\nhave been trying to build since 1945; the world we \r\nwant for our children and for our grandchildren. It can \r\nbe done if we act together.  \r\n Enlightened sovereignty, multilateral institutions \r\nand multilateral action result from a collection of \r\nsovereign decisions based on individual States’ own \r\ninterests, not narrow self-interest in sovereignty’s \r\nname, but an expanded view of mutual interest in \r\nwhich there is room for all to grow and for all to \r\nprosper. Canada calls that enlightened sovereignty. It is \r\nthe natural extension of enlightened self-interest. \r\n As Canada’s Prime Minister noted when he \r\naddressed the General Assembly last year, the United \r\nNations Charter is animated by “the idea that what is \r\ngood for others may well be the best way to pursue \r\none’s own interests” (A/65/PV.11, p. 46) — in other \r\nwords, enlightened sovereignty. \r\n The world knows that we can accomplish great \r\nthings by working together. This year, collective action \r\nunder United Nations sanction helped to limit the loss \r\nof life in Libya and ultimately ended a criminal, \r\nillegitimate regime’s war on the people whom it \r\nclaimed to represent. Canada was tremendously proud \r\nto take part in its demise. Our Royal Canadian Air \r\nForce flew 10 per cent of the total strike sorties against \r\nAl-Qadhafi’s forces and our Royal Canadian Navy \r\nhelped enforce the maritime blockade. \r\n Canada has paid heavily, both in dollar terms and \r\nin a costly human toll, to fulfil our United Nations \r\nobligation to support the lawful Government of \r\nAfghanistan. We used our chairmanship of the Group \r\nof Eight to reach out to leaders from Africa and the \r\nAmericas and to secure an agreement to enact the \r\nMuskoka Initiative for maternal, newborn and child \r\nhealth. \r\n That progress will help to meet the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goal of reducing the appalling mortality \r\namong mothers and children in developing countries. \r\nWorking with like-minded nations, Canada continues \r\nto make significant financial contributions towards \r\npeace, humanitarian assistance, development aid and \r\nsecurity in the Sudans. Collective action does not mean \r\nuniformity. \r\n For example, Canada works closely with like-\r\nminded countries to advance human rights and \r\ndemocracy in Burma. At the same time, we imposed \r\nthe toughest sanctions in the world against that \r\ncountry’s repressive military regime. Similarly, when \r\nCanada placed strong restrictions on Syria’s current \r\nregime, we acted independently, but in close \r\nconsultation and cooperation with other nations. \r\n In the defence of freedom and human rights, form \r\ncannot prevail over substance. The determinant is \r\nwhich route produces the best results. While \r\nmultilateral action should be preferred, failure to \r\nachieve consensus must not prevent the willing from \r\nacting to uphold human rights and the founding \r\nprinciples of the United Nations. \r\nA/66/PV.26  \r\n \r\n11-51390 32 \r\n \r\n Margaret Thatcher was once reported to have said \r\nthat “consensus seems to be the process of abandoning \r\nall beliefs, principles, values and policies. So it is \r\nsomething in which no one believes”. That leads to my \r\nthird topic — the challenges to the relevance and the \r\neffectiveness of this important Organization. \r\n Canada has been a consistently reliable and \r\nresponsible participant in United Nations initiatives \r\naround the world. We are the seventh largest \r\ncontributor to United Nations finances. The citizens of \r\nthe world deserve that the United Nations abide by the \r\nsame principles observed by so many Governments of \r\nMember States: accountability, transparency and \r\nethics; financial responsibility and fiscal austerity; \r\nefficiency and the elimination of waste and \r\nduplication; regular reviews to sunset unnecessary, \r\nredundant and obsolete mandates; and zero tolerance \r\nfor conflicts of interest, fraud and corruption. \r\n Yet, the challenges faced by this Organization \r\nextend beyond financial probity and operational \r\neffectiveness. This Organization is a forum for debate \r\nand dialogue, but it must also be a force for positive \r\naction to make the world a better place. As a former \r\nCanadian Prime Minister, John Diefenbaker, told this \r\nAssembly during his defence of the world’s persecuted \r\nminorities: “We are not here in this Assembly to win \r\nwars of propaganda. We are here to win victories for \r\npeace.” (A/PV.871, para. 225)  \r\n The relevance and effectiveness of the United \r\nNations are imperilled when the founding principles \r\nare observed in word but not in deed. Such is the case \r\nwhen the presidency of the Conference on \r\nDisarmament passes to a regime involved in the illicit \r\ntransfers of weapons, material and technology; or when \r\nIran, which mocks the values of this Organization \r\nthrough such outrages as refusing to allow entry to  \r\n \r\nUnited Nations observers on human rights, is permitted \r\nto seek leadership roles, such as the vice-presidency of \r\nthe General Assembly and a seat on the Commission on \r\nPopulation and Development; or when objection is \r\ntaken on petty, procedural or process-based grounds to \r\nreporting that speaks about credible allegations of war \r\ncrimes committed in Sri Lanka; or when blatant \r\nviolators of women’s rights are welcomed to the \r\nConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of \r\nDiscrimination against Women, often despite \r\nreservations that are incompatible with the object and \r\npurpose of the very Convention. \r\n Canada has consistently opposed the debasement \r\nof multilateral institutions by conduct that is \r\ninconsistent with their values. For example, this year \r\nmarks the fiftieth anniversary of Canada’s principled \r\nrefusal to support membership in the Commonwealth \r\nof Nations by South Africa’s then apartheid regime. \r\n The greatest enemies of the United Nations are \r\nnot those who publicly repudiate its actions. The \r\ngreatest enemies of the United Nations are those who \r\nquietly undermine its principles or, even worse, who sit \r\nidly, watching its slow decline. We cannot sit idly. \r\n Canada is a vigorous defender of freedom, \r\ndemocracy and the rule of law. As our Prime Minister \r\nremarked earlier this month,  \r\n “we are not a country that makes war for gain or \r\nfor territory. We do not fight for glory. If we \r\ncovet honour, it is only a reputation for doing the \r\nright thing in a good cause”. \r\n That is all. That is enough. If I may be so bold, \r\nthat is why the countries of the world came together in \r\nthe United Nations ─ to do the right thing in a good \r\ncause. The cause is peace, justice, freedom and \r\nopportunity for all. \r\n  The meeting rose at 6.35 p.m. \r\n"
