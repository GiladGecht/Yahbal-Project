(Qatar) \r\n \r\n \r\n In the absence of the President, Mr. Thomson \r\n(Fiji), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 6.35 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 8 (continued) \r\n \r\nGeneral debate \r\n \r\n The Acting President: I now call on Her \r\nExcellency Ms. Aurelia Frick, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs, Minister for Justice and Minister for Cultural \r\nAffairs of Liechtenstein. \r\n Ms. Frick (Liechtenstein): It is a great honour to \r\nagain address this Assembly, especially at the first \r\ngeneral debate ever opened by a woman. What an \r\ninspiration! This debate has already proven that the \r\nGeneral Assembly can indeed play a central role in \r\nmultilateral diplomacy, in particular at this time of \r\ngreat change and turmoil.  \r\n I would like to express the solidarity of my \r\ncountry, Liechtenstein, with all of the peoples of the \r\nworld that have, in recent months, sought to attain \r\nfreedom from oppression and tyranny. We admire the \r\ncourage of all of those women and men, young and old, \r\nwho have stood up for their rights, often at great \r\npersonal risk. We, the United Nations, must stand by \r\nthem. I also wish to welcome South Sudan as the \r\n193rd State Member of the Organization. The United \r\nNations has yet again proven its ability to settle \r\ncomplex and violent conflicts by peaceful means. \r\n Mr. Allam-mi (Chad), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n The developments in northern Africa and the \r\nMiddle East may have roots mainly in the lack of \r\nconnections between Governments and their people. \r\nWhile they may be primarily internal in nature, there is \r\nalso an international dimension to the rapid changes we \r\nare witnessing. The events since February have put the \r\nOrganization itself to the test, and more challenges can \r\nbe expected to occur.  \r\n In recent years we have sharpened tools and \r\nconcepts that are essential in helping us solve or \r\nprevent conflicts. So how did we apply them during \r\nthese challenging times?  \r\n First, how well did we carry out our commitment \r\nto protect civilians? The United Nations has made \r\nmuch progress in developing the concept of the \r\nresponsibility to protect. The concept has three pillars: \r\nin the first instance, the primary responsibility of the \r\nState concerned, and then the second pillar, according \r\nto which other States have a responsibility to assist in \r\nthe protection of civilians. In two recent instances, \r\nhowever, the international community has had to act \r\nunder the last and third pillar. We commend the \r\nSecurity Council for taking swift action to protect \r\ncivilians in Libya and in Côte d’Ivoire. In both \r\ninstances, the Council authorized the use of force only \r\nas a last resort, but also without undue delay. \r\n Some have criticized the actions taken and argued \r\nthat they were aimed at regime change. Let us not \r\nforget, however, that the regimes in question had a \r\nA/66/PV.27  \r\n \r\n11-51398 2 \r\n \r\nchoice. It was they who chose to attack civilians. It was \r\nthey who forced the international community to act. At \r\nthe same time, we sympathize with those who \r\nperceived a selective application of the responsibility \r\nto protect. As the stalemate in the Security Council on \r\nSyria showed, politics continues, at times, to trump \r\nprinciple. In response, however, we need more \r\nprincipled action, not more politics. \r\n Secondly, have we lived up to our promise to \r\nensure accountability for the worst crimes? Have we \r\nlived up to the promise of “Never again!”, which we \r\ngave in the aftermath of Rwanda and Srebrenica? Once \r\nmore, the international response to crimes committed \r\nin Libya has provided a glimmer of hope. The Security \r\nCouncil’s unanimous referral of the Libya situation to \r\nthe International Criminal Court (ICC) was a historic \r\ndecision. The ICC responded appropriately with swift \r\naction. Furthermore, the Court is also undertaking \r\npreliminary investigations regarding Côte d’Ivoire. The \r\ncentral role played by the Court in those situations and \r\nin many others has illustrated the profound paradigm \r\nshift brought about by the Rome Statute.  \r\n The core principle of that shift is now firmly \r\nentrenched in the fabric of international law: there \r\nmust be accountability for genocide, war crimes and \r\ncrimes against humanity. But accountability has not yet \r\narrived everywhere that it is needed. Serious \r\nallegations of crimes committed in Sri Lanka and in \r\nSyria, for instance, have not yet found an appropriate \r\nand transparent justice mechanism. Again, the primary \r\nresponsibility to ensure an end to impunity falls on the \r\nStates concerned. International mechanisms, such as \r\nthe ICC, can and must only become active where States \r\nfail to live up to their responsibilities. \r\n Thirdly, how effective have we been in using \r\nmediation as a tool in the peaceful settlement of \r\ndisputes? This topic, which was rightfully chosen as \r\nthe central theme of the presidency, is at the very heart \r\nof the Organization’s mandate. We support the \r\nSecretary-General’s call to raise prevention from an \r\nabstract concept to a core operating principle. It is \r\nsimply paradoxical that only a small fraction of the \r\nSecretariat’s resources is dedicated to mediation, while \r\nwe spend $7 billion per year on peacekeeping.  \r\n In many situations, the good offices provided by \r\nneutral and trusted actors, such as envoys of the \r\nSecretary-General, can make a real difference on the \r\nground. Such actions involve highly intense, often \r\nheroic efforts, which deserve much stronger support \r\nfrom us as Member States. Mediation efforts are \r\nincreasingly influenced by accountability mechanisms. \r\nThe General Assembly itself acknowledged this fact in \r\nits first ever resolution on strengthening mediation, \r\nwhere it emphasized, that “justice is a fundamental \r\nbuilding block of sustainable peace” (resolution \r\n65/283, thirteenth preambular paragraph).  \r\n In this new age of accountability, mediators can \r\nnever offer amnesty from criminal prosecution or \r\nwithdraw arrest warrants issued by the ICC. That is not \r\nonly a matter of principle, but a matter of law. The ICC \r\nwould never be bound by such promises. At times, the \r\nimperatives of peace and justice may compete with \r\neach other temporarily and make the mediator’s job \r\nmore difficult. Over the long run, however, they are not \r\nonly compatible, but mutually reinforcing. That \r\nmessage is sent around the globe upon each ratification \r\nof the Rome Statute. And we are particularly happy to \r\nnote that the message has been sent 118 times so far, \r\nmost recently by the Philippines and the Maldives. \r\n Fourthly, have we done enough to include women \r\nin efforts at conflict prevention and resolution and to \r\nmake them agents of change, instead of bystanders? \r\nHave we done enough to protect them during conflict, \r\nin particular, from sexual violence? We have \r\ncollectively sent strong signals in this regard. \r\nLiechtenstein particularly supports the Security \r\nCouncil’s work on women, peace and security. We \r\nwelcome the new focus on the role of women brought \r\nabout by the creation of UN-Women. Women have \r\nbeen a driving force in the Arab Spring. But as some \r\ncountries transition to a new era, women risk being left \r\nbehind once again.  \r\n The United Nations is often involved in \r\ntransitional processes. It must ensure a strong role for \r\nwomen and apply a gender perspective. Most \r\nimportant, the United Nations must lead by example \r\nand appoint more women as leaders in mediation and \r\nother transitional processes. It was therefore with great \r\npleasure that I signed the joint statement on advancing \r\nwomen’s political participation, earlier today. \r\n Regarding the protection of women and girls \r\nfrom sexual violence, we place high hopes in the new \r\nmonitoring and reporting mechanism. Expert teams \r\nwill help strengthen domestic accountability \r\nmechanisms. The greatest responsibility, however, lies \r\nwith peacekeepers on the ground. They are mandated \r\n A/66/PV.27\r\n \r\n3 11-51398 \r\n \r\nto go into harm’s way and protect civilians. They must \r\nfulfil that mandate even more effectively when faced \r\nwith situations of sexual violence. Most important \r\nthough, we must once and for all eradicate all instances \r\nof sexual abuse committed by peacekeepers \r\nthemselves. It is not enough to simply repatriate Blue \r\nHelmet soldiers who have committed such crimes. Zero \r\ntolerance for sexual abuse must finally become a \r\nreality. \r\n Fifthly, have we done enough to address the root \r\ncauses of the unrest in many countries, including \r\npoverty, unemployment, corruption, lack of freedom \r\nand human rights? Those root causes and the strong \r\npopular opposition against them, remind us of a simple \r\ntruth: economic and social development are \r\ninextricably linked with good governance, human \r\nrights and the rule of law.  \r\n The international community has many tools at \r\nits disposal to assist countries in reforming their \r\nsystems of governance. We strongly support United \r\nNations activities to promote the rule of law and \r\ncombat corruption and make financial contributions to \r\nthat end. There is no shortage of assistance and \r\ncapacity-building programmes. What is needed is \r\ngreater political will to actually make use of them. It is, \r\nhowever, the task of the United Nations to improve the \r\nmanner in which rule-of-law assistance programmes \r\nare delivered and coordinated. We would welcome a \r\nstronger role for the Rule of Law Coordination and \r\nResource Group in this regard, and hope that progress \r\ncan be made at next year’s high-level meeting on the \r\nrule of law. \r\n The events of recent months have shown us once \r\nagain how irresistible the call for freedom can be. And \r\nthey have shown us, once more, how indispensable the \r\nOrganization is when it comes to assisting peoples that \r\naspire to such freedom through democracy. Despite all \r\nthe criticism, I am convinced that the United Nations \r\nhas in recent years become more effective in delivering \r\non its mandate. If we work together here, we will \r\nachieve results much more efficiently than through \r\nindividual actions. Great opportunities lie ahead of \r\nus — let us accept the challenge. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Samuel Santos López, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of Nicaragua. \r\n Mr. Santos López (Nicaragua) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): At this general debate of the sixty-sixth \r\nsession of the General Assembly, I convey to the \r\nAssembly a Christian, socialist greeting of solidarity \r\nfrom the people of Nicaragua and Comrade President \r\nCommander Daniel Ortega Saavedra. We trust that our \r\nwork will contribute to strengthening the Organization \r\nthrough an appropriate focus on its purposes, principles \r\nand possible contributions so that we can successfully \r\ndeal with the challenges before us as a community of \r\nStates, peoples and nations. \r\n One year ago, during our discussions at the sixty-\r\nfifth session of the General Assembly, we extensively \r\naddressed the serious and multifaceted international \r\ncrisis experienced by humankind. At that time we \r\ncalled it an apocalyptical crisis. One year later, the \r\nevolution of world events has confirmed our \r\nprofoundest fears that our civilization is now at a \r\ncritical stage and that peace between States and \r\npeoples is dangerously at risk. \r\n Expectations that the international economic and \r\nfinancial situation would improve have dissipated \r\nbefore the relentless reality of a profound crisis; its \r\ngravest effects still continue to affect deeply our \r\npeoples. The international financial system, which is \r\ncontrolled by speculators, again plunged into a tailspin. \r\nThe measures taken have had a temporary, non-lasting \r\neffect owing to the ever increasing greed of bankers. \r\nWe are now witnessing the effects of the United States \r\ninternal debt problem, which has generated great losses \r\nin most exchange markets. \r\n At present, as before, we affirm that we reject the \r\nlanguage of war between peoples and we reject war as \r\na means to resolve conflicts between States. In the light \r\nof the events in the brotherly Arab socialist popular \r\nrepublic of Libya, we reiterate our declaration of \r\nprinciple and express our solidarity with the brotherly \r\nLibyan people. \r\n The blunt and shameful manipulation of Security \r\nCouncil resolution 1973 (2011) regarding Libya — the \r\nillegal war being carried out by NATO members — is \r\nthe most recent example of the pathological need of \r\nparticular States to attempt to subordinate the peoples \r\nof the world at any cost. It is the most recent example \r\nof attacks against the sovereignty of a State Member of \r\nthe United Nations in violation of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n Nicaragua expresses its firmest rejection of the \r\nuse of the misnamed responsibility to protect in order \r\nto intervene in our countries, bomb civilians and \r\nA/66/PV.27  \r\n \r\n11-51398 4 \r\n \r\nchange free and sovereign governments. We cannot \r\nallow the imposition of this new model of imperialist \r\naggression nor the continued aggression against our \r\npeoples. Interference and intervention will not resolve \r\ncrises; only dialogue and negotiation among brothers \r\nand sisters will resolve political crises among peoples. \r\n The unacceptable policy of double standards has \r\nbecome a constant of those Powers, which clearly \r\naspire to hegemony. Where are those countries, the \r\nsupposed defenders of oppressed peoples, the self-\r\nproclaimed civilian protection apostles, when an \r\nattempt is being made to recognize the inalienable \r\nrights of the Palestinian people, their right to live in \r\npeace, their right to a sovereign State enjoying full \r\nrecognition as a State Member of the United Nations? \r\nThis is clearly an instance of double morals, double \r\nstandards. After six decades of conflict, the Palestinian \r\npeople are now to be denied their right to a State, while \r\na mere 10 days ago, with unheard of haste and, I must \r\nnote, a certain irony, the General Assembly recognized \r\na transitional council that has not yet formed a \r\nGovernment. \r\n We reject the logic of denying the very existence \r\nof a Palestinian State. From the moment of triumph of \r\nour revolution in 1979 — the Sandinista revolution — \r\nNicaragua has been a proud witness to the noble \r\nstruggle of the Palestinian people and their substantial \r\nconcessions aimed at achieving peace. \r\n Before the General Assembly, Nicaragua ratifies \r\nits recognition of the Palestinian State within its 1967 \r\nborders with East Jerusalem as its capital. We call, here \r\nand now, for the proclamation of Palestine as the \r\n194th State Member of the United Nations. \r\nRecognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian \r\npeople can only serve to promote Middle East peace \r\nand stability. At present, more than ever, such \r\nrecognition must become a reality. Clearly, Palestine’s \r\nright is linked to the existence of the State of Israel, a \r\nState we recognize in juridical and political terms. May \r\nboth States exist, so that both peoples may live in \r\npeace and work for their well-being and development: \r\nThat is the universal appeal. \r\n Resolutions adopted by the General Assembly for \r\nmore than two decades have demanded an end to the \r\nUnited States of America’s economic embargo against \r\nCuba. They must be fully implemented. Despite \r\nexpectations, the facts confirm that nothing has \r\nchanged. Sanctions against Cuba remain intact and are \r\nrigorously implemented. That criminal blockade \r\nviolates international law; it is contrary to the purposes \r\nand principles of the Charter of the United Nations and \r\nconstitutes a crime against a sovereign State’s right to \r\npeace, development and security. In its essence and its \r\nobjectives, it is an act of unilateral aggression and a \r\npermanent threat to a country’s stability. \r\n Despite that criminal blockade, Cuba continues \r\ndaily to strengthen its solidarity and fraternal relations \r\nwith all peoples of the world. Cuba’s armies of white \r\ncoats and educators are ever more numerous in \r\ndemonstrating their country’s solidarity. We also echo \r\nthe call for an end to the injustice against the five \r\nCuban heroes who have been unjustly imprisoned for \r\n13 years as of this past 12 September, for having \r\nalerted their people to the activities of terrorist \r\norganizations against Cuba. \r\n As unlikely as it may seem, the process of \r\ndecolonization has not ended, and there remain entire \r\npeoples who have been denied their right to \r\nindependence and self determination. We welcome and \r\nmaintain our solidarity with the peoples of Puerto Rico, \r\nthe Western Sahara and the struggle of the Frente \r\nPolisario and with Argentina with regard to the \r\noccupation of the Malvinas Islands. \r\n Observations made in the Assembly in 2010 \r\nregarding the need to achieve a balance between \r\nhuman beings and Mother Earth remain relevant; they \r\nhave even led us to conclude that, far from \r\ndiminishing, pressures on the planet have increased; \r\nthreats have escalated and real and potential dangers \r\nhave multiplied. \r\n Among those, the Fukushima disaster in Japan \r\nhad the virtue of bringing into view the chilling global \r\nrisk of radiation. The Japanese crisis has rightly been \r\ndescribed as a nuclear war without war. Its present and \r\nfuture repercussions, which have not yet been fully \r\nestablished, are considered by recognized scientists to \r\nbe more serious than those of the Chernobyl disaster. \r\n While expressing our solidarity with the \r\nGovernment and the heroic people of Japan — the \r\nvictims of the earthquake that levelled their territory \r\nand those affected by the Fukushima accident — we \r\nvehemently call on States with nuclear reactor \r\ninstallations to take all measures to avoid similar \r\naccidents that would gravely endanger people’s health \r\nand would harm the environment. \r\n A/66/PV.27\r\n \r\n5 11-51398 \r\n \r\n The upcoming Durban Climate Change \r\nConference and the Rio+20 Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment will provide renewed opportunities — \r\nwhich we must not allow ourselves to squander — to \r\ntruly break with destructive logic and redirect \r\nhumankind towards development that is in harmony \r\nwith Mother Earth and respectful of the lives of the 7 \r\nbillion human beings now populating the planet. \r\n We all know that we have been incapable of \r\nachieving an accord on climate change. Although the \r\nsixteenth Conference of the Parties to the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change \r\nestablished a Green Fund and called for the \r\nmobilization of financing for developing countries, that \r\naccord is far from addressing the serious damage being \r\ndone to the environment and Mother Earth or the \r\nhistorical responsibility of the developed countries, \r\nwhich are bent on dealing a final blow to the Kyoto \r\nProtocol so as to continue their uncontrolled emissions \r\nof greenhouse effect gases. \r\n In Rio and in Durban we will be called upon to \r\nrenew our political will and adopt genuine, concrete \r\ncommitments based on previous progress and \r\ncommitments. The issue is of transcendental \r\nimportance for our planet and for human beings. \r\nDevelopment must not sacrifice life. We recall that the \r\nUniversal Declaration on the Common Well-Being of \r\nMother Earth and of humankind is an essential guide \r\nfor our debates and actions. \r\n Looking at other issues, Nicaragua salutes the \r\ninternational community’s invitation to Taiwan to \r\nparticipate in the assemblies of United Nations \r\nspecialized agencies directly related to the well-being \r\nof the 23 million Taiwanese. We urge other \r\ninternational forums to adopt similar positions. \r\n The global economic and financial crisis has \r\ncompounded the already serious food crisis, primarily \r\nin impoverished countries. We know that this crisis \r\nalso has structural causes in the present capitalist \r\ndevelopment model — a model that discourages \r\ninternal production and impedes technology transfer to \r\nthe agricultural sector of impoverished countries, a \r\nmodel without available credit or technical training for \r\nsmall and medium producers, which results in \r\nproduction difficulties. \r\n Climate change has become an additional major \r\nfactor in the deepening of the food crisis. The trend \r\ntowards higher oil prices at the international level has \r\ncaused some countries with an agricultural base to \r\nbegin producing biofuel. That phenomenon has \r\nsignificantly changed food supply and demand and has \r\nreinforced the trend toward higher prices. \r\n From the ethical point of view, as well as \r\npolitical, economic and social, it is essential to take \r\nimmediate concerted action to avoid the continuing \r\nincrease in the number of hungry people and to \r\ndevelop sustainable policies for guaranteeing food \r\nsecurity worldwide. \r\n We renew our commitment to the cause of \r\ngeneral and complete disarmament. It is imperative \r\nthat we establish peace on Earth and provide the \r\n7 billion human beings who inhabit it, and Mother \r\nEarth itself, with the opportunity to survive the \r\ndestructive tendencies promoted by the dominant \r\neconomic model, so that humankind may develop in an \r\nenvironment conducive to manifesting our enormous \r\nspiritual and material capacities. No other way will \r\nenable us to achieve a better future. \r\n It is therefore unjustifiable and unacceptable that \r\nthe present world continues to spend more on the \r\ndevelopment and testing of all types of weapons and \r\nless on protecting the life and development of human \r\nbeings. While millions of persons suffer the effects of \r\nthe economic and financial crisis, global military \r\nexpenditures have skyrocketed. Over the past 10 years, \r\nthose expenditures have increased by 50 per cent, to \r\n$1.5 trillion today. More than 8 million small arms and \r\nlight weapons and more than 16 billion munitions are \r\nproduced every year, the equivalent to more than \r\n2.5 munitions for every single person on the planet. \r\nThat arms proliferation causes irreparable direct and \r\nindirect harm to peoples and their economies. \r\n We can end that proliferation if we decide to. It is \r\nnot true that the arms sector is vitally important to the \r\nworld economy. In fact, despite what the producers of \r\nsmall arms and light weapons would have us believe, \r\ntheir trade and the trade in munitions and components \r\nrepresent less than 0.01 per cent of the world’s \r\nindustrial transactions. \r\n We are firmly convinced that because the Korean \r\npeninsula remains a focal point of international \r\ntension, any solution must take place through goodwill \r\nand sincere dialogue between the parties in order to \r\nmaintain peace and stability. \r\nA/66/PV.27  \r\n \r\n11-51398 6 \r\n \r\n The factors called new threats to security have \r\nbecome an outright scourge for most of our countries. \r\nDrug trafficking, human trafficking, illegal arms \r\ntrafficking, and the trafficking of immigrants, among \r\nothers, constitute ethical, political and economic \r\nchallenges for Central America, which is stigmatized \r\ntoday in some international reports as one of the most \r\nviolent regions on Earth. That stigmatization is \r\ndeliberate and carries serious consequences for our \r\ncountries. It transforms us into protagonists of the \r\nproblem rather than the victims we truly are, victims of \r\nthe lucrative businesses that constitute those new \r\nthreats. Through transnational networks they utilize our \r\nterritories as a bridge from South to North and from \r\nNorth to South, in a dance of millionaires as thousands \r\nof people are assassinated along illegal routes and \r\nporous borders. \r\n The International Conference of Support for the \r\nCentral American Security Strategy, held in Guatemala \r\nlast June, exposed the seriousness of a situation that \r\nexists not only in our region, but in all of the countries \r\nof the world. That is why the principle of shared but \r\ndifferentiated and proportional responsibility must \r\nguide mutual commitments. It is urgent that we move \r\nin the right direction before it is too late for us all. \r\n Nicaragua is going through a time of change \r\naimed at reversing the negative effects of 16 long years \r\nunder neoliberal Governments. We are recovering \r\nvalues, restoring rights, strengthening capacities and \r\nconstructing a new model based on replacing the \r\nneoliberal model of untrammeled capitalism with one \r\nbased on Christian, socialist and solidarity principles. \r\nWe are articulating popular democracy through the \r\nnational human development plan. Together these \r\nconstitute the backbone of a new phase of the \r\nSandinista revolution. \r\n These achievements are due in large part to \r\nNicaragua’s integration into the Bolivarian Alliance for \r\nthe Peoples of Our Americas, an initiative stemming \r\nfrom the genius of Fidel Castro, the Commander in \r\nChief of the Cuban revolution, and of Commander-\r\nPresident Hugo Chávez Frías. This brotherhood, \r\nunique in today’s world, enables solidarity, \r\ncomplementarity and fair trade between our peoples \r\nand advances the historical cultural unity of our \r\npeoples. \r\n At the same time, our national human \r\ndevelopment plan is aimed specifically at promoting \r\nthe country’s economic and social health by adding \r\njobs and reducing poverty and inequality, on a basis of \r\nsovereignty, security and integration. The restoration of \r\nthe human and constitutional right of all Nicaraguans \r\nto free education is reflected in the fact that, in a \r\ncountry with a total population of 6.5 million, \r\n1,821,682 students are now enrolled in schools. This \r\nyear we are launching the battle for universal primary \r\neducation, aiming at universal sixth grade education by \r\n2012. The goal is to achieve universal enrolment in the \r\nthird year of secondary school by 2015. \r\n The restoration of the human and constitutional \r\nright of the Nicaraguan people to free health care \r\nmeans providing better access to, and improving the \r\nquality of, health services, reducing maternal and \r\ninfant mortality, paying more attention to the \r\ndevelopment of young people, expanding community \r\nfamily health services, and the first large-scale \r\nregistering of people with disabilities. Our Programa \r\nAmor is designed for boys and girls under six years old \r\nand for street children and adolescents, and those who \r\nwork during school terms, in order to restore to them \r\ntheir fundamental rights. \r\n In structural areas, we are making progress in \r\ntransforming the energy matrix so that by 2017, 90 per \r\ncent of energy will be from renewable sources and \r\n10 per cent from fossil fuels, radically inverting the \r\npyramid we inherited in 2006. We are enjoying \r\nmacroeconomic stability, with gross national product \r\ngrowth projected at 4 per cent or more. Our \r\nimprovement policies have increased direct foreign \r\ninvestment in our country’s strategic sectors. We have \r\nhad outstanding successes in confronting drug \r\ntrafficking and transnational organized crime. \r\nNicaragua is now recognized as one of the safest \r\ncountries in Latin America and the Caribbean, and the \r\nsafest in Central America. We have had indisputable \r\nsuccesses in reducing poverty and inequality, as has \r\nbeen recognized by international financial institutions. \r\n We are fervent supporters of the integration and \r\nunity of Central America, Latin America and the \r\nCaribbean. Within the framework of the Bolivarian \r\nAlliance for the Peoples of Our America, we are \r\nsecuring our model through complementarity, \r\ninvestments, fair trade and solidarity.  \r\n With our neighbours and brothers in Honduras \r\nand El Salvador, we are working together for the \r\nsustainable development of the Gulf of Fonseca. \r\n A/66/PV.27\r\n \r\n7 11-51398 \r\n \r\nComrade President Daniel Ortega Saavedra has also \r\nmade several approaches to the Government and \r\npeople of our neighbour to the south, Costa Rica, \r\nconcerning the possibility of joint development of our \r\ncommon border, particularly in terms of protecting and \r\nrestoring the environment and working on sustainable \r\neconomic and social development for the benefit of \r\nboth our peoples. Throughout this process, young \r\npeople and women have been at the forefront of the \r\ndirect democracy model that is the essence and \r\ncontinuity of the Sandinista revolution. \r\n Nicaragua can demonstrate the profound, \r\nconcrete and verifiable economic, social, political, \r\nlegislative and cultural achievements our people are \r\nundergoing. In the context of the serious crises that so \r\nmany countries, developed and developing, are going \r\nthrough, our Christian, socialist, solidarity model is an \r\ninspiration for an ever better future.  \r\n We are aware of our difficulties and limitations. \r\nWe know that the weight of the historical structure that \r\nwe inherited is still a liability that we must cast off in \r\nour national development process. The burdens of \r\npoverty and underdevelopment require sound policies \r\nand sustained effort and political and governing \r\nsystems that have the necessary commitment to our \r\npeople’s aspirations. I can assure the Assembly that \r\nthrough our Government of national reconciliation and \r\nunity we will achieve that and more. \r\n As we have said before, it is not easy for \r\ndeveloping countries such as ours to deal with an issue \r\nof the breadth and depth of the global economic and \r\nfinancial crisis. We have yet to recover from the harsh \r\neffects of the last wave, while the new threat of another \r\nand greater crisis is bearing down on us. According to \r\nthe International Monetary Fund, Central America’s \r\nresponse to the previous world economic and financial \r\ncrisis was in large part successful. We were able to deal \r\nwith the situation successfully — success with costs \r\nthat in Nicaragua’s case were not passed on to the \r\npoorest, because the measures we adopted were based \r\non the interests of our country as a whole. \r\n As we consider international developments, we \r\nmust also turn our attention to our own Organization. \r\nGlobal democratization must be accompanied by \r\ndemocratization of the United Nations without further \r\ndelay.  \r\n In his book La reinvención de la ONU: una \r\npropuesta, our comrade and friend, the former \r\nPresident of the Assembly, General Father Miguel \r\nd’Escoto Brockmann — who is with us here — states \r\nthat it is urgent that we give true meaning to \r\ndemocracy and independence in the United Nations, so \r\nthat the opinions of all can be heard and so that those \r\nopinions really count in the decision-making process, \r\nwith no one being excluded. \r\n This proposal, adopted by our national \r\nreconciliation and unity Government, consists of \r\nproposals on the United Nations charter, the statute of \r\nthe International Court of Justice and the statute for the \r\nInternational Tribunal for Climate Justice and \r\nEnvironmental Protection, as well as a proposal on a \r\ndraft universal declaration on the common good of \r\nmother earth and humankind. \r\n Reinvention and re-grounding are key concepts \r\nthat will pave the way for an international system \r\nbased on genuine multilateralism that is in harmony \r\nwith the changes the world has undergone during the \r\npast few decades. We must restore a true political \r\ndimension to international law and to the rights of \r\npeople. \r\n Developed societies are sinking into the despair \r\ncaused by unemployment, the lack of social security, \r\nfinancial insolvency, the implosion of established \r\nlabour rights and an uncertain future. Global Powers \r\nare waging wars of aggression with no moral or \r\npolitical base, causing material destruction and \r\nenormous human suffering. Economic and financial \r\nrecovery are nowhere in sight; on the contrary, \r\nspecialists foresee a recession even more serious than \r\nthe one we have recently experienced. \r\n Where do we find the solution we so urgently \r\nneed? Where do we regain hope in the possibility of a \r\ndifferent present and future world, in which there is \r\npeace between States and nations? In which \r\ndevelopment efforts and impressive scientific and \r\ntechnological advances are equitably shared? In which, \r\nas the Greek sophist Protagoras put it, man is the \r\nmeasure of all things? \r\n According to many prominent thinkers on the \r\nglobal reality, the final crisis of the capitalist \r\ndevelopment model has arrived. There is no time for \r\nreforms. As Leonardo Boff has said,  \r\n “We need to find another way of thinking, one \r\nbased on principles and values that can sustain a \r\nnew test of civilization. If not, we will have to \r\nA/66/PV.27  \r\n \r\n11-51398 8 \r\n \r\naccept a path that leads straight to the edge of the \r\nprecipice. Dinosaurs already took that path.”  \r\n Nicaragua is proceeding on the belief that a better \r\nfuture is possible if only we are capable of steering in a \r\nnew direction, if we struggle for justice and peace, and \r\nif we commit ourselves to the development and \r\ndefence of the common good of the Earth and of \r\nhumankind. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Basile Ikouebe, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs and of la Francophonie of the Republic \r\nof the Congo. \r\n Mr. Ikouebe (Congo) (spoke in French): I am \r\nhonoured to take the floor from this rostrum on behalf \r\nof the President of the Republic, His Excellency \r\nMr. Denis Sassou Nguesso. \r\n This past week, in this place, we took part in \r\nHigh-level Meetings that addressed the major concerns \r\nat the very heart of the actions of the United Nations \r\nand those of its Member States: non-communicable \r\ndisease; the situation in Libya; desertification, land \r\ndegradation and drought in the context of sustainable \r\ndevelopment and the eradication of poverty; the \r\ncommemoration of the tenth anniversary of the \r\nadoption of the Durban Declaration and Programme of \r\nAction on Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia \r\nand Related Intolerance; nuclear safety; and terrorism. \r\nClearly, the conclusions that we reached at those \r\nmeetings reflect not only the political will and \r\ncommitment of Member States to provide collective \r\nresponses to those concerns, but also corroborate our \r\nfaith in multilateralism.  \r\n In unison we have welcomed the Republic of \r\nSouth Sudan, and we congratulate them on concluding, \r\nafter many years of patience, the long and laborious \r\nprocess of negotiation that brought us the 193rd State \r\nMember of the United Nations. In joining the warm \r\nwords of welcome expressed by the delegations before \r\nme, I wish to reiterate the Congo’s support for this \r\nyoung brother country and to underscore the \r\ncommitment of my Government to develop close ties \r\nof friendship and cooperation with it.  \r\n Since its creation, the United Nations has put a \r\ngreat deal of effort into the noble endeavour of freeing \r\npeoples still under the yoke of colonialism and \r\ndomination. The history of the United Nations is \r\nintertwined with the emancipation of peoples. The time \r\nhas therefore come to do justice to the legitimate \r\naspirations of the Palestinian people. The Congo hopes \r\nto see a sovereign Palestinian State emerge, master of \r\nits own fate, in this great universal family, within \r\nsecure and guaranteed borders and living in peace \r\nalongside the people of the State of Israel in a spirit of \r\ngood neighbourliness and cooperation. \r\n With respect to the situation in Libya, particularly \r\nas regards the consequences for the subregion, we \r\nagree that the restoration of peace and security remains \r\na high priority. For this reason, I wish to express my \r\nGovernment’s support for the United Nations Support \r\nMission in Libya. \r\n In the quest for a peaceful solution to the Libyan \r\ncrisis, the Congo, together with other African States \r\nmembers of the Ad Hoc High-level Committee of the \r\nAfrican Union, urges the authorities of the National \r\nTransitional Council to meet their commitments, \r\nparticularly with respect to preserving national unity; \r\ninvolving all Libyan stakeholders, without exception, \r\nin rebuilding the country; protecting foreigners, \r\nparticularly African migrant workers; and opening an \r\ninclusive political process for ending the crisis.  \r\n In our immediate neighbourhood, both the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and Cameroun will \r\nhold major elections in several weeks. My delegation \r\nwould like to see that process take place smoothly, in \r\ncalm and peace, in order to help democracy take root \r\nand to strengthen political stability. \r\n The intolerable situation in the non-State of \r\nSomalia and the ongoing civil war that has been under \r\nway for 20 years, along with the unprecedented \r\nhumanitarian crisis, once again challenge the \r\ninternational community. We encourage the \r\nTransitional Federal Government to continue and \r\nstrengthen its efforts to achieve peace within the \r\nframework of the Djibouti Agreement, with the \r\nparticipation of all groups that wish to cooperate, and \r\nto renounce armed violence. Here, I would like to \r\ncommend the actions of the African Union Mission to \r\nSomalia, particularly for having made it possible to \r\nsecure Mogadishu.  \r\n Mr. Körösi (Hungary), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n We welcome the wave of international solidarity \r\nfor the Horn of Africa. In keeping with this \r\n A/66/PV.27\r\n \r\n9 11-51398 \r\n \r\nmomentum, the Congo has made a contribution for the \r\nvictims of the drought in Somalia. \r\n The President has properly placed the role of \r\nmediation in the peaceful settlement of disputes at the \r\ncentre of the general debate. For the prevention and \r\nresolution of conflicts, this is indeed a necessary tool \r\nthat has proven itself over the years and in all areas.  \r\n The experience of mediation in Africa since the \r\nindependence of the African States is replete with \r\nlessons regarding the role of this mechanism in settling \r\nthe numerous internal crises or inter-State conflicts that \r\nour countries have experienced. In the past, the \r\nOrganization of African Unity used meditation almost \r\nsystematically. Today, the African Union continues to \r\nbenefit from it. Furthermore, mediation is consistent \r\nwith the African culture and tradition of dialogue. It is \r\nby drawing from the very source of this tradition that \r\nthe Congo was able to launch a productive internal \r\ndialogue that enabled it to overcome the socio-political \r\nturmoil of the 1990s. \r\n The relevant provisions of the United Nations \r\nCharter enshrine the obligation of Member States to \r\nseek, in any dispute,  \r\n “a solution by negotiation, enquiry, mediation, \r\nconciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement, \r\nresort to regional agencies or arrangements, or \r\nother peaceful means of their own choice”.  \r\nThese provisions offer a wide range of possibilities \r\nfrom among which to select the means appropriate to \r\nbring about a peaceful settlement. \r\n Today more than ever, the quest for peace by \r\nnegotiation remains the only way to guarantee lasting \r\npeace. The threat or use of force should be considered \r\nonly after having exhausted all possible political \r\nsolutions. The Security Council should therefore \r\nstrictly limit the conditions under which the use of \r\nforce is authorized so as to avoid any manipulation or \r\ndeterioration of a situation.  \r\n Similarly, the abuse of the international justice \r\nsystem, which has become a political weapon targeting \r\nAfrica in particular, is a dangerous aberration that must \r\nbe corrected. \r\n Beyond its main theme, the current session is \r\nbeing held, as have preceding sessions, at a time in our \r\nshared history when the United Nations is solidly \r\nmobilized around its three main pillars of activity, \r\nnamely, international peace and security, economic \r\ndevelopment and sustainable development, as well as \r\nthe related aspects of protecting the environment and \r\nhuman rights. With respect to the range of challenges \r\nold and new that the United Nations is expected to \r\nmeet, it will be viewed as effective and legitimate only \r\nif it adapts to the new realities of our world. \r\n United Nations reform is therefore urgent. It must \r\nbe based on the principles of democracy, justice and \r\nequality. The position of the African Union on Security \r\nCouncil reform is well known in this body. The \r\nreforms will be contingent on the willingness of all \r\nMember States to make the Organization an institution \r\nthat embodies modern values and that is open to the \r\nfuture. \r\n In order for the United Nations to effectively and \r\nefficiently fulfil its key role in steering global affairs, \r\nits Member States must carry out reforms, first to \r\nrestore the central role of the General Assembly as the \r\nmost representative deliberative body, and then to \r\nfoster the participation of more developing countries in \r\nthe decision-making process.  \r\n The global challenges identified by heads of State \r\nand Government at the Millennium Summit, held in \r\nSeptember 2000, include sustainable development and \r\nenvironmental protection. These issues have figured \r\nprominently in international negotiations for many \r\nyears and influence the implementation of the two \r\nUnited Nations framework conventions on the \r\nenvironment.  \r\n The causes of climate change and their impact on \r\nhuman life and the environment are well known. \r\nRegardless of the explanations proffered, \r\nenvironmental pollution is caused by human activity. \r\nConsequently, we hope that the negotiations on a post-\r\nKyoto climate regime will conclude with the adoption, \r\nat the seventeenth session of the Conference of the \r\nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention \r\non Climate Change, to be held soon in Durban, of an \r\ninternational instrument that could be opened for \r\nsignature at the Rio+20 Conference.  \r\n In Central Africa, the countries of the Congo \r\nForest Basin, for their part, have made a commitment \r\nto sustainably manage their forests through \r\nconservation, forest certification, combating illegal \r\nlogging, good forest governance, the gradual \r\nstreamlining of the logging industry and \r\nimplementation of the process to reduce emissions \r\nA/66/PV.27  \r\n \r\n11-51398 10 \r\n \r\nfrom deforestation and forest degradation in \r\ndeveloping countries. This effort, which should be \r\ncontinued, has resulted in very low deforestation rates. \r\nThis is one of Central Africa’s major contributions to \r\nglobal efforts to reduce greenhouse gases. The \r\ninternational community should support and encourage \r\nit. \r\n On the initiative of the Republic of the Congo, \r\nthe first summit on the world’s three tropical forest \r\necosystems was held in Brazzaville from 29 May to \r\n3 June. That summit, which brought together the \r\ncountries of the Amazon, South-East Asia and Congo \r\nBasins, resulted in the conclusion of a cooperation \r\nagreement on these three tropical forest ecosystems \r\nwith the support of United Nations agencies and other \r\npartners. The agreement is to be signed in Rio de \r\nJaneiro on the sidelines of the World Summit on \r\nSustainable Development, to be held in June 2012. In \r\nthat regard, I wish to express the gratitude of the \r\nCongolese Government to Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon for his personal support to this initiative. \r\n As the Assembly is aware, the conservation and \r\nsustainable management of forests requires substantial \r\nhuman, material and financial resources, which forest \r\ndeveloping countries do not have. Those countries are \r\ndesperately awaiting the release of the “fast start” \r\nfunds that developed counties announced at \r\nCopenhagen and the delivery of the innovative, \r\npredictable and permanent sources of funding agreed at \r\nCancún, as well as technology transfer and capacity-\r\nbuilding.  \r\n In mentioning these climate and environmental \r\nissues, I cannot but think of Mrs. Wangari Maathai, \r\nwho passed away yesterday. I pay tribute to the \r\nmemory of this first Nobel Prize-winning woman of \r\nAfrican politics, who the world will remember as an \r\navant-garde activist in the fight to protect the \r\nenvironment. Her commitment to reforestation and \r\nrestoring biodiversity won her the recognition of the \r\ncountries of Central Africa, who designated her as a \r\nGoodwill Ambassador for the Congo Basin Forest. I \r\nshould like to take this opportunity to express my \r\ndeepest condolences to the Government and the people \r\nof Kenya, as well as to the family of the deceased.  \r\n The events taking place in the Arab world are \r\nreplete with lessons, as were the enormous changes \r\nthat transformed the European landscape after the fall \r\nof the Berlin Wall, in 1989. Everywhere, the hymn of \r\nfreedom and democracy has resounded. We know that \r\nthe overthrow of a political regime does not necessarily \r\nbring freedom and democracy. They must be won and \r\nnurtured by other victories that cannot be imposed \r\nfrom without. The world has changed and we must face \r\nthe facts inherent in these new geopolitical challenges, \r\nwhich have led to the emergence of new forces on the \r\ninternational stage. Freedom of expression thrives here, \r\nin the United Nations. Let democracy not stop on its \r\nthreshold. The United Nations must be the sanctuary of \r\nthose who are building the future. A safer, fairer and \r\nmore prosperous world for all will then emerge. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Georges Rebelo Chikoti, Minister of \r\nExternal Relations of Angola. \r\n Mr. Chikoti (Angola) (spoke in Portuguese; \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): I would like \r\nto take this opportunity to congratulate the President of \r\nthe General Assembly on his election to preside over \r\nthe work of the Assembly at its sixty-sixth session and \r\nto assure him of Angola’s support and cooperation in \r\nensuring success in the work of this session. I also \r\nwant to express our gratitude to his predecessor, \r\nMr. Joseph Deiss, for the competent and impartial \r\nmanner in which he conducted the proceedings of the \r\nAssembly at its sixty-fifth session.  \r\n Allow me to also congratulate the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on his reappointment and to assure him of my \r\nGovernment’s support for the success of his very \r\ncomplex and demanding mission in the service of \r\npeace and cooperation among nations, a cornerstone of \r\nthe mandate embodied in the Charter of the \r\nOrganization. \r\n We congratulate the Republic of South Sudan on \r\nits admission as a Member of the United Nations. We \r\nwish South Sudan a future of peace and prosperity and \r\nwould like to say that the Government of Angola \r\nstands ready to cooperate with this new State’s efforts \r\nto consolidate its independence and its socio-economic \r\ndevelopment. \r\n We also welcome the establishment of \r\nUN-Women. We are certain that it will give further \r\nimpetus to the promotion and empowerment of women \r\nand the achievement of their legitimate rights. \r\n This session of the General Assembly takes place \r\nat a particularly complex juncture in the international \r\nsituation, which is characterized by so many crises that \r\n A/66/PV.27\r\n \r\n11 11-51398 \r\n \r\nI believe it is not an exaggeration to say that they \r\nchallenge the very foundations of our international \r\nOrganization. If we were to list them, although not \r\nexhaustively, we could mention the current economic \r\nand financial crisis, which triggered the most serious \r\nsocial crisis witnessed to date by our generation; a \r\ndangerous environmental crisis of unpredictable \r\nconsequences for the future of humankind, which will \r\nbe irreversible unless the international community as a \r\nwhole applies immediate and courageous measures; \r\nand a general escalation of violence and outbreak of \r\nconflict, which, combined with the environmental \r\ncrisis, has caused the most serious humanitarian crisis \r\nthat humankind has witnessed since the end of the \r\nSecond World War. In brief, we are living in dangerous \r\ntimes, where a combination of factors is endangering \r\nstability, peace and security in the world. \r\n The analysis of the current international situation \r\nmade by the majority of the speakers who preceded \r\nme, and which we agree with, constitutes an appeal to \r\nour collective responsibility. \r\n A particularly disturbing factor is the current \r\neconomic and financial crisis, which has affected \r\nvirtually every country in the world, in particular \r\ndeveloping countries, with serious consequences for \r\npolitical stability and social cohesion. \r\n It is therefore urgent that we find solutions to \r\nthese problems. That will require strengthening \r\ninternational cooperation on the basis of greater justice \r\nand equality. Moreover, it is urgent that we take \r\nmeasures aimed at deepening economic reforms within \r\nStates that promote economic growth and social \r\ndevelopment. \r\n Angola is extensively affected by the \r\ninternational economic and financial crisis. We have \r\ntherefore adopted a set of measures to mitigate its most \r\nadverse effects. Without prejudice to the maintenance \r\nof macroeconomic balance, we have focused \r\nconsiderable resources on social development and \r\ncombating poverty. \r\n The theme of this session of the General \r\nAssembly — “The role of mediation in the settlement \r\nof disputes through peaceful means” — reflects the \r\ndeep concern of the international community with \r\nregard to the need for an integrated approach to \r\nresolving conflicts that affect it. That is what makes it \r\nnecessary to implement mediation efforts after \r\nconflicts have started. Conflict prevention should be \r\nthe key element in the management of any area of \r\ntension. \r\n Respect for fundamental rights and freedoms, the \r\nrule of law and good governance are key elements in \r\nensuring that any human society can live in peace and \r\nharmony. They are also the main guarantors of \r\neffective conflict prevention. \r\n There are other elements I would like to mention \r\nthat are also important causes of the spread of conflict. \r\nI am referring here to external interference, which, in \r\ngross violation of international law, frequently \r\nobstructs efforts at mediation and peaceful resolution \r\nand prevents the reaching of solutions to conflicts. \r\n Angola has paid a very high price as a result of \r\nsuch interference, which for too long compounded a \r\nfratricidal conflict that Angolans were finally able to \r\nsettle and wisely overcome with magnanimity, fairness \r\nand inclusion, thanks to the leadership of our President. \r\nThe role of Angola and its contribution to internal and \r\nregional peace should be seen in the broader context of \r\nconflict resolution. In that regard, the implementation \r\nof the landmark Security Council resolution 435 (1978) \r\nled to the independence of Namibia and created the \r\nconditions for peaceful coexistence in a region that had \r\nendured extreme hostility and constituted a permanent \r\nthreat to world peace. \r\n Imbued with a spirit of fraternity, the \r\nGovernment of Angola has spared no effort in pursuing \r\nits policy of effective reconciliation, which has allowed \r\nthe reconciliation of all its children who were \r\npreviously involved in the conflict. There has been \r\ngenuine investment in peace, which has been a decisive \r\nfactor in the process of post-conflict reconstruction. \r\nAngola has served as a reference point for the \r\nresolution of several conflicts on the African continent. \r\nMoreover, we have spared no effort in sharing our \r\nexperiences with other peoples and countries.  \r\n Also in the context of conflict resolution, it is \r\nimportant to strengthen the role of multilateralism \r\nwhile adhering to the principle of shared responsibility \r\nand shared benefits, recognizing the legitimate \r\ninterests of all parties and engaging in consultations \r\nand dialogue in the search for workable solutions to \r\ninternational peace and security issues. \r\n There is therefore a need to refer to the \r\ninstruments of cooperation between the Security \r\nCouncil and the African Union, as well as to the role of \r\nA/66/PV.27  \r\n \r\n11-51398 12 \r\n \r\nthe United Nations and regional institutions in \r\npreventing and resolving conflicts. It is of crucial \r\nimportance to strengthen the action of regional \r\norganizations in the management of situations that may \r\nconstitute threats to peace and security. In that \r\nconnection, the Security Council has the primary role \r\nin preventing and resolving conflicts and in \r\nmaintaining peace, in accordance with the powers \r\nconferred upon it by the Charter of the United Nations.  \r\n The central theme of our debate has drawn \r\nattention to the need for reform of the Security \r\nCouncil, including the imperative of achieving fair \r\nrepresentation for all regions and increasing the \r\nnumber of permanent members, thereby adapting the \r\nCouncil to contemporary reality. \r\n With regard to peaceful cooperation at the \r\nregional level, Angola is a member of the Southern \r\nAfrican Development Community (SADC), the \r\nEconomic Community of Central African States, the \r\nGulf of Guinea Commission and the Community of \r\nPortuguese-speaking Countries (CPLP), which, with \r\nseveral partners, has acted on the basis of preventive \r\ndiplomacy in the search for peaceful solutions to the \r\nvarious crises that have arisen. \r\n With regard to the constitutional crisis in \r\nMadagascar, SADC mediated the recent signing by all \r\nparties involved of the road map for the \r\nimplementation of the reconciliation process, which is \r\nintended to lead to elections and the restoration of \r\nconstitutional order. That was an important \r\nbreakthrough in the process, which Angola welcomes. \r\n Guinea-Bissau, our brotherly country and partner \r\nin the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries, \r\nhas been the subject of special attention by Angola. As \r\npart of the CPLP, Angola and other member States \r\nhave striven to establish a strategic partnership with \r\nthe Economic Community of West African States under \r\nthe coordination of the United Nations, aiming to bring \r\npolitical stability to the country so that it can carry out \r\nmajor structural reforms, in particular the reform of the \r\ndefence and security sectors. We welcome the positive \r\ndevelopments that the country is now experiencing and \r\nwe encourage the authorities of Guinea-Bissau to \r\nvigorously pursue the process of stabilization. \r\n The drought in the Horn of Africa is a cause of \r\ndeepest concern for my country and the entire \r\ninternational community. The consequences of drought \r\nin Somalia are felt even more profoundly due to the \r\nprevalence of armed conflict, which compounds the \r\nhumanitarian crisis, shocks the world’s conscience and \r\ncalls for a redoubled effort by the international \r\ncommunity. Angola has joined the international \r\nhumanitarian assistance efforts under way, as well as \r\nthe search for political solutions to end the armed \r\nconflict and open new prospects for a better future for \r\nthe Somali people. \r\n With regard to the situation in Libya, the Angolan \r\nGovernment hopes that the Libyan people can find \r\nstability in the very near term. That can only be \r\nachieved through the free exercise of their democratic \r\nrights. In that regard, Angola urges the National \r\nTransitional Council to promote genuine national \r\nreconciliation and to form an inclusive Government, as \r\nthose are prerequisites for ensuring that Libya can \r\nregain its rightful place in the African and international \r\narenas. However, we must make use of lessons learned \r\nwith a view to achieving more effective cooperation \r\nbetween external partners and the African Union in \r\nseeking joint solutions based on international law and \r\nmutual respect. \r\n Angola remains concerned about the limited \r\nprogress in addressing the problem of Western Sahara, \r\nwhich remains an important issue on the international \r\nagenda. We call on the warring parties to resume \r\nnegotiations under the auspices of the United Nations \r\nand the African Union, so that the people of Western \r\nSahara can exercise their right to self-determination. \r\n The situation in the Middle East, particularly in \r\nthe Palestinian territories, is one of the most serious \r\nproblems facing the international community. Angola \r\nis witnessing with great concern the escalation of the \r\nconflict and the lack of progress towards a solution of \r\nthe Palestinian question. In line with the general \r\nposition of the international community regarding the \r\nconflict, my country advocates the establishment of an \r\nindependent Palestinian State, living side by side with \r\nthe State of Israel, in peace and security, within secure \r\ninternationally recognized borders. \r\n As in previous sessions, the sixty-sixth session of \r\nGeneral Assembly will address the embargo imposed \r\non Cuba, which violates the rules of international free \r\ntrade. In spite of the timid steps taken towards \r\nnormalizing the situation, Angola reiterates its position \r\nof principle by reaffirming the need to end the embargo \r\nagainst Cuba. \r\n A/66/PV.27\r\n \r\n13 11-51398 \r\n \r\n Angola has been making its contribution to \r\nfinding solutions to the most pressing problems. Within \r\nthe broader international community, we have sought \r\nto cooperate with all countries based on mutual respect \r\nand interests, upholding the highest ideals of peace and \r\ncooperation for development. We will continue on this \r\npath, firmly believing that the defence and promotion \r\nof these principles contribute to the development and \r\nadvancement of all peoples. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. John M. Silk, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Republic of the Marshall Islands. \r\n Mr. Silk (Marshall Islands): On behalf of \r\nPresident Jurelang Zedkaia, I bring warm greetings \r\nfrom the Republic of the Marshall Islands to the \r\nGeneral Assembly. The Marshall Islands also welcomes \r\nSouth Sudan as the newest Member of the \r\nOrganization. \r\n The Marshall Islands congratulates the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for making nuclear disarmament and nuclear \r\nsafety a top priority at the United Nations during his \r\nsecond term. Fifty-seven years ago, at the dawn of the \r\nCold War, the United Nations held the Marshallese \r\npeople in trust. Marshallese leaders petitioned the \r\nUnited Nations to put a halt to the testing of nuclear \r\nweapons. The United Nations responded with \r\nTrusteeship Council resolutions 1082 (XIV), adopted \r\nin 1954, and 1493 (XVII), adopted in 1956. Acting \r\nwith assurances of our protection, the United Nations \r\nand its administering authority, the United States, \r\ndetonated 67 large-scale nuclear explosions in the \r\nMarshall Islands. For decades, Marshallese leaders \r\nhave returned to the United Nations to speak of the \r\ncontinuing impacts — cancer, fear and continued exile \r\nfrom our homeland — and of a science where \r\ngoalposts are always moving. \r\n Three weeks ago, the leaders of the Pacific \r\nIslands Forum, in their communiqué, not only \r\nrecognized the special responsibility of the United \r\nStates of America but also agreed to support the \r\nMarshall Islands at the United Nations, including in \r\naddressing the issue of the Secretary-General’s report. \r\nThe United Nations has a clear responsibility to \r\nacknowledge and address the consequences of nuclear \r\ntesting undertaken under its watch — and a special \r\nresponsibility has already been acknowledged by the \r\nparties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons. \r\n Last year, the General Assembly requested the \r\nSecretary-General to report on the effects of atomic \r\nradiation in the Marshall Islands. Such a report would \r\nrepresent the potential for the Marshall Islands, the \r\nUnited States and the United Nations to take a very \r\npositive step forward towards understanding our past, \r\nbringing closure to this sad chapter in our history and \r\nbeginning to understand how the international \r\ncommunity can assist us in addressing future \r\nremediation challenges. The involvement of the United \r\nNations is key. \r\n Sadly, I am concerned that the Secretary-General \r\nhas thus far neglected this critical opportunity. The \r\nUnited Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of \r\nAtomic Radiation, which was invited to contribute to \r\nthe Secretary-General’s efforts to assemble a report, \r\nhas termed the General Assembly’s deliberate mandate \r\nto be “not appropriate” and “an apparent error” in need \r\nof formal correction (A/66/46, para. 13). \r\n That is not only insensitive but it reveals that \r\nperhaps the United Nations itself has yet to come to \r\nterms with, or even to merely acknowledge, its \r\ndecisions on nuclear safety taken 60 years ago. That \r\nnegative approach could preclude efforts to bring to the \r\nattention of this body important scientific work that has \r\nbeen done in assessing the consequences of the nuclear \r\ntesting in the Marshall Islands. \r\n It is our hope that United Nations will have the \r\ncourage and will to rise above the past and make a \r\ndifference, rather than allow itself to remain controlled \r\nby history, and make excuses. As I said earlier, for \r\ndecades, Marshallese leaders have returned to the \r\nUnited Nations to repeatedly speak of the legacy of the \r\nnuclear testing in our country. It is my hope that one \r\nday a new generation of Marshallese leaders will come \r\nto this forum not to speak of this sad legacy, but rather \r\nto proclaim that the work is done and that all is well. \r\n The impacts of nuclear testing are not the only \r\nhistorical legacy from international actors in the \r\nMarshall Islands. Unexploded ordnance from the \r\nSecond World War and oil leakage are persistent issues \r\nfor our outer island communities. They pose threats to \r\nour human security, public health and environmental \r\nsafety. We welcome the attention of Pacific Island \r\nForum leaders, and we join the call for assistance from \r\ninternational bodies and development partners. \r\n The Republic of the Marshall Islands is not just a \r\nsmall island State; we are a large ocean nation. \r\nA/66/PV.27  \r\n \r\n11-51398 14 \r\n \r\nTogether, the oceanscape of the Pacific islands is an \r\narea that covers 10 per cent of the world’s surface and \r\nis four times the size of Europe. The way we manage \r\nour maritime space is therefore a central pillar in our \r\nbasic development aspirations, and has significant \r\nimplications for the health of global oceans. \r\n International commitments to ensure sustainable \r\nfisheries and to visibly advance our development \r\naspirations can no longer be paid mere lip service and \r\nthen later be ignored by our partners in regional \r\nprocesses, including the Western and Central Pacific \r\nFisheries Commission. The Marshall Islands presently \r\nonly sees a penny of benefit for every dollar of the \r\nmarket value of our Pacific tuna. The conservation \r\nmeasures by the parties to the Nauru Agreement, \r\nincluding the Vessel Day Scheme and high seas \r\nclosures, must be implemented by our partners, not \r\nonly to reduce pressure on overfished stocks but also to \r\nensure our rightful place as a full economic actor. \r\n Twenty years ago, global leaders meeting at Rio \r\nde Janeiro set forward a high international benchmark \r\nfor sustainable development, crafting a range of \r\nstrategies and commitments. Next year, the critical \r\nUnited Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment must not only focus on moving towards a \r\nglobal green economy but must also pay specific \r\nattention to a global “blue economy” — one that \r\nensures specific, measurable and time-bound targets \r\nfor guaranteeing the sustainability of the global oceans \r\nand their fish stocks, particularly in regions dotted by \r\nsmall island States like my own. Greater commitment \r\nis needed to utilize targeted global high seas closures, \r\nthereby ensuring sustainable fisheries, as we are \r\nalready doing in the Pacific. The hour is past for vague \r\nrhetoric. Leaders must respond with action rather than \r\ncontinued neglect for the world’s oceans. \r\n The Marshall Islands warmly welcomed the visit \r\nthis month by the Secretary-General to the Pacific \r\nregion. The Secretary-General was able to see for \r\nhimself the vulnerability and existential threat facing \r\nlow-lying island States. He has now rightfully \r\nchallenged world leaders to respond. What were once \r\ntheoretical and distant risks are now on the verge of \r\nbecoming our reality. \r\n International climate negotiations are at serious \r\nrisk of entering a phase of political stalemate. \r\nNegotiators have spent more than two decades in \r\ncomplicated processes that have delivered very little in \r\nterms of practical action to mitigate the climate change \r\nproblem. Often blocked by only a handful of countries, \r\nthe international community is still unable to commit \r\nto emissions cuts and targets sufficient to ensure the \r\nsurvival of the Marshall Islands and other low-lying \r\nnations. \r\n The Marshall Islands can wait no longer. We are \r\nnow choosing creative paths to drive urgency into our \r\nbroken negotiations and to pursue practical initiatives \r\nto address the threats and risks. First, the Marshall \r\nIslands joined with the Government of Mexico in \r\nurging the United Nations in its coming Climate \r\nChange Conference to consider the use of voting as a \r\nmeans of last resort. Secondly, in July, we joined with \r\nour Pacific small island developing States colleagues to \r\npush for the Security Council to recognize that climate \r\nchange now poses an incontrovertible threat to \r\ninternational peace and security.  \r\n We reiterate our call for the Secretary-General to \r\nreport on those threats. Petty arguments about forums \r\nand mandates cannot be allowed to prevail at the risk \r\nof our statehood. All organs of the United Nations must \r\nnow be proactively engaged. We do not need \r\nsympathy; we need solutions and political innovation. \r\n Thirdly, the Marshall Islands is carefully studying \r\noptions for clarifying the relevant international \r\nobligations related to climate change and how it affects \r\nour statehood. Working with our close neighbour, the \r\nRepublic of Palau, we are committed to pursuing \r\nrequests for legal advisory opinions from international \r\ntribunals in order to recognize the international legal \r\nprinciples that address questions of our survival and \r\nsecurity in the context of climate risks. We have also \r\nagreed to work with Palau and other vulnerable and \r\nlow-lying countries to formulate and advance our own \r\nlegally binding climate agreement. We, the most \r\nvulnerable, must act when others lack the political will \r\nto do so.  \r\n As a significant global economic leader, Taiwan \r\ncan make substantial contributions to the international \r\ncommunity. The Republic of the Marshall Islands \r\nwelcomes increased dialogue on key cross-Strait \r\nissues. That progress deserves recognition by the \r\ninternational community. Given that the primary \r\npurpose of the United Nations is to maintain \r\ninternational peace, the world cannot afford to \r\noverlook Taiwan’s strong efforts in promoting peace \r\n A/66/PV.27\r\n \r\n15 11-51398 \r\n \r\nand stability in the Asia-Pacific region, including with \r\nregard to climate change. \r\n The 2009 invitation by the World Health \r\nOrganization for Taiwan to participate as an observer \r\nhas not only benefited global medical progress, \r\nincluding on non-communicable diseases, but also \r\nserves as an effective model for its wider participation \r\nin other key organizations. We urge the United Nations \r\nand its Member States to consider that model and \r\ndevelop effective means for Taiwan’s participation in \r\nspecialized agencies, including the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change and the \r\nInternational Civil Aviation Organization. \r\n The Security Council must transform itself into \r\nan effective and contemporary body. The Security \r\nCouncil should be restructured to accommodate those \r\nnations whose size, leadership and responsibility, in \r\nparticular the Group of Four — Japan, Germany, India \r\nand Brazil — warrants a permanent presence in the \r\nCouncil. Further efforts should be made to ensure that \r\nAfrica and small nations, including island States, have \r\nimproved access and an amplified voice. \r\n The General Assembly witnessed a historic \r\nmoment last week, in which, for the first time, the \r\ngeneral debate was initiated by a woman, namely, \r\nPresident Rousseff of Brazil. The Marshall Islands \r\nwelcomes the Secretary-General’s renewed priority on \r\naddressing gender, including a strengthened \r\nUN-Women institution, particularly in the Pacific. \r\n The message for nuclear weapons, global security \r\nand climate change is the same: international law is not \r\nan empty promise. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Antoine Gambi, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Central African Republic. \r\n Mr. Gambi (Central African Republic) (spoke in \r\nFrench): At the outset, I would like to convey to the \r\nPresident, on behalf of His Excellency Army General \r\nFrançois Bozizé, Head of State and President of the \r\nCentral African Republic, who it is my honour to \r\nrepresent here, our heartfelt congratulations on his \r\nelection to preside over the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-sixth session. He can rest assured of our full \r\nreadiness to cooperate with him to ensure the success \r\nof his challenging task. I would also like to pay well-\r\ndeserved tribute to his predecessor, His Excellency \r\nMr. Joseph Deiss, for the talent and dedication that he \r\ndemonstrated as he steered our work throughout the \r\nsixty-fifth session of the Assembly. To His Excellency \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon, I convey my heartfelt \r\ncongratulations on his reappointment to the head of the \r\nOrganization.  \r\n Lastly, the Central African Republic welcomes \r\nthe admission of South Sudan, a brotherly \r\nneighbouring country, as the 193rd Member State of \r\nthe United Nations. \r\n In proposing “The role of mediation in the \r\nsettlement of disputes through peaceful means” as the \r\ncentral theme of the general debate of the sixty-sixth \r\nsession of the Assembly, the President has placed our \r\ndeliberations at the very heart of those problems that \r\nare of current concern to the international community. \r\nIt must be recalled that the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security around the world \r\ncontinues to be the primary mission of the \r\nOrganization, and that, for Member States, mediation \r\ncontinues to be an indispensable tool in the peaceful \r\nsettlement of conflicts. The Central African Republic \r\nremains committed to the principles of the United \r\nNations Charter, which enshrines language pertaining \r\nto the peaceful settlement of conflicts — principally \r\nthrough mediation and prevention. \r\n The international community faces many \r\nchallenges to which we need to provide tailored \r\nresponses in order to together build a better world.  \r\n We attach particular attention to the issue of \r\nclimate change and the environment. Protecting the \r\nenvironment and combating climate change are major \r\nchallenges, as well a priority for the international \r\ncommunity, given the many and varied risks that they \r\npose to ecosystems and economies.  \r\n The commemoration, next year, of the twentieth \r\nanniversary of the first Earth Summit on sustainable \r\ndevelopment will be devoted to forests. Tropical \r\nforests, including those in the Central African \r\nRepublic, are exposed to various harmful and \r\ndestructive activities associated with the pressure \r\nexerted by social problems and natural disasters. The \r\ncountries concerned have recognized the need to \r\nformulate land-use policies in order to conserve their \r\nbiodiversity, both in terms of flora and fauna, in these \r\nregions.  \r\n Furthermore, the drought that is currently \r\nafflicting the Horn of Africa, where approximately \r\nA/66/PV.27  \r\n \r\n11-51398 16 \r\n \r\n12 million human lives are threatened, is a source of \r\nmajor concern and requires broad-scale mobilization \r\nby the international community.  \r\n That brings me to the issue of food security. The \r\nCentral African Republic will support a draft resolution \r\non food development, some provisions of which would \r\nbe incorporated in the various resolutions of the \r\nAssembly and in other United Nations meetings \r\nthroughout the year. \r\n Nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament \r\nremain a priority. The Central African Republic \r\nwelcomes the renewed interest in disarmament on the \r\npart of the international community. Greatly concerned \r\nby the nuclear threat to all of humankind, non-nuclear-\r\nweapon States are entitled to call upon those who \r\npossess nuclear weapons to fully shoulder their \r\nresponsibilities by implementing specific measures to \r\nbring about genuine nuclear disarmament. For its part, \r\nthe Central African Republic will spare no effort to \r\nsupport any United Nations initiative to that end. \r\n Today, terrorism remains a scourge of the \r\ninternational community. In resolution 1963 (2010), the \r\nSecurity Council declared its intent to hold a special \r\nmeeting of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) on \r\n28 September 2011, open to all United Nations \r\nMember States, to mark the tenth anniversary of the \r\nadoption of its resolution 1373 (2001) establishing the \r\nCTC. It should be recalled that the CTC has done a \r\ngreat deal in assisting Member States in undertaking \r\nactions to combat this scourge by strengthening the \r\nimplementation of standards and border controls, as \r\nwell as in the fight against the financing of terrorism. \r\n The Central African Republic remains committed \r\nto the universal values of human rights, democracy and \r\ngood governance. We reaffirm our commitment to \r\nworking throughout this sixty-sixth session with the \r\nother Members of the United Nations to provide \r\nresponses that uphold those values.  \r\n The fight against impunity and against violations \r\nof human rights is a given for our community. We hope \r\nto see it placed within an overall approach that does \r\nnot hinder the process of political crisis and conflict \r\nresolution around the world or undermine regional and \r\ninternational efforts provided for by the United Nations \r\nCharter. \r\n The Central African Republic attaches special \r\nimportance to the reform of this Organization and all \r\nits bodies with regard to their structures, modes of \r\noperation and work methods. For this reason, we \r\nremain committed to the African position regarding the \r\nSecurity Council. Indeed, in all the ongoing crises in \r\nthe world, the Security Council has gradually imposed \r\nthe authority of the United Nations, placing it at the \r\nservice of international peace and security. Its action is \r\nand remains legitimate. Its authority will be further \r\nstrengthened when we reach an agreement on its \r\nexpansion, which will enable us to take the emergence \r\nof new Powers into account by giving a more equitable \r\nplace to all continents. \r\n Like many African States, my country has been \r\nengaged on the path towards democratic governance \r\nsince the 1990s. As part of our democratic process, we \r\nhave endeavoured to improve the management of \r\npublic policy on the political, economic and social \r\nfronts. We are aware that much remains to be done in \r\nthese spheres.  \r\n The renewed trust of the Central African in His \r\nExcellency General of the Army François Bozizé \r\nYangouvonda, President of the Republic and Head of \r\nState, has given him the opportunity to pursue the \r\nsuccessful task he began on 15 March 2003. We are \r\ndetermined to break with instability and at long last to \r\nturn the page on political-military upheavals. That will \r\nenable him to focus on reconstruction. In other words, \r\nwe will do everything to consolidate that peace that \r\nguarantees enduring development. Without peace and \r\nsecurity, there can be no economic development that \r\nbenefits the population as a whole.  \r\n It is from this standpoint that the Central African \r\nGovernment held a round table in Brussels with our \r\ndevelopment partners on 16 and 17 June in order to \r\nraise the awareness of the international community \r\nwith respect to the funding needs of the programmes \r\noutlined in the second poverty reduction strategy paper. \r\n The matter of security remains at the very heart \r\nof our concerns. Part of the population of the Central \r\nAfrican Republic continues to suffer the aggression of \r\nrebels belonging to the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) \r\nof Joseph Kony. The activity of the LRA, a cruel and \r\nbarbaric rebellion from a country that shares no \r\nborders with the Central African Republic, remains the \r\nsource of atrocities, destruction, looting, rape, forced \r\nrecruitment and the deportation of men, women and \r\nchildren. Mobilization on all sides and the shared \r\n A/66/PV.27\r\n \r\n17 11-51398 \r\n \r\nallocation of resources are needed to eradicate that \r\nscourge once and for all. \r\n The Government of the Central African Republic \r\ngreatly appreciates the initiatives of the United \r\nNations, the African Union and the United States on \r\nthis issue. We continue to believe that the Republic of \r\nSouth Sudan will join other affected countries in this \r\nrelentless struggle against a cross-border enemy that \r\nharbours vague ambitions harmful to the stability \r\nrequired for development of our subregion. \r\n The December 2010 withdrawal of the United \r\nNations Mission in the Central African Republic and \r\nChad left a security vacuum that my country is trying \r\nto fill despite our limited resources. The same holds \r\ntrue for Mission for the Consolidation of Peace in the \r\nCentral African Republic deployed by the Economic \r\nCommunity of Central African States, whose mandate \r\nexpires at the end of December 2013. \r\n Reinforcing the capacities of our defence and \r\nsecurity forces, which are slated to take over from the \r\ninternational forces, is still far from complete. I should \r\nlike here to thank the United Nations through its \r\nPeacebuilding Fund, which has been supporting the \r\nCentral African Republic in its tireless quest for peace \r\nand stability. \r\n In the light of all this, I appeal once again to the \r\ninternational community to take urgent action in order \r\nto build peace and prevent conflict in the Central \r\nAfrican Republic. We welcome in advance all \r\ncommitments that have been or will be made on our \r\nbehalf. We are convinced that the dividends of those \r\nefforts will benefit both the Central African Republic, \r\nwhich lies at the heart of the African continent, and the \r\nentire subregion. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Surujrattan Rambachan, Minister of \r\nForeign Affairs and Communications of the Republic \r\nof Trinidad and Tobago. \r\n Mr. Rambachan (Trinidad and Tobago): \r\nMr. President, I congratulate Mr. Al-Nasser on his \r\nelection to preside over the sixty-sixth session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, and extend the best wishes of the \r\nPrime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago, Mrs. Kamla \r\nPersad-Bissessar, and of the Government and people of \r\nmy country, on whose behalf I address the Assembly. \r\n I also welcome South Sudan as the newest \r\nMember of the United Nations. \r\n More than six decades ago, the United Nations \r\nwas established, among other things, to save \r\nsucceeding generations from the scourge of war, \r\npromote social progress and better standards of life in \r\ngreater freedom, and employ international machinery \r\nfor the promotion of the economic and social \r\nadvancement of all peoples. \r\n Notwithstanding instances of conflicts that have \r\nthreatened to reverse the gains achieved since 1945, the \r\nUnited Nations, with the support of Member States, has \r\nachieved some success in maintaining international \r\npeace and security. An important ingredient fuelling \r\nthis success has been the promotion by the United \r\nNations of the principle of the settlement of disputes \r\nthrough pacific or peaceful means. \r\n The Government of Trinidad and Tobago is very \r\nsupportive of the President’s choice of the theme for \r\nthis debate, “The role of mediation in the settlement of \r\ndisputes by peaceful means”. It provides, in our view, \r\nan opportunity for members of the international \r\ncommunity to reaffirm their commitment to this \r\nimportant principle, which is not only enshrined in the \r\nCharter of the United Nations but also widely accepted \r\nas forming part of customary international law.  \r\n The Charter is the primary legal instrument \r\ngoverning the conduct of international relations among \r\nStates. Indeed, Article 33 imposes a binding legal \r\nobligation on parties to disputes to settle them first of \r\nall through peaceful means. Under Chapter VII, the \r\nSecurity Council is also required, as a first resort, to \r\nuse peaceful means to resolve disputes that constitute \r\nthreats to peace, breaches of the peace, and acts of \r\naggression. \r\n We meet at a time when peoples everywhere are \r\nseeking more direct roles in the governance of their \r\nsocieties; when they are not prepared to be silent \r\nspectators to their plight; when ordinary, law-abiding \r\ncitizens are prepared to die for the cause of freedom \r\nfrom tyranny and for democracy; when leadership that \r\nis anything less than democratic is unacceptable; when \r\nsocial media have united the peoples of the world into \r\na global community with one aspiration — the dignity \r\nof the human person; and when the hunger of the souls \r\nof peoples of many nations for democracy cannot be \r\nappeased by false promises of a distant utopia. Above \r\nall, we are witnessing levels of youth alienation and \r\nrestlessness that challenge leaders to bridge the gap \r\nbetween old cultures and traditions of governance with \r\nA/66/PV.27  \r\n \r\n11-51398 18 \r\n \r\nnew aspirations. There will be no future that is \r\npeaceful unless the cynicism of the young is addressed. \r\n Developments in the Middle East and in North \r\nAfrica reveal a global growing dissonance among the \r\nmasses with regimes that trample on the freedoms \r\nfundamental to democracy and do not allow for \r\nparticipation in governance. In a world linked by social \r\nmedia, the risk of a people’s uprising that transcends \r\ncontinents and borders is real. It is a kind of social \r\nchaos that as leaders we must all prevent. If we do not, \r\nthe gains we have made will be lost and a kind of \r\nanarchy could be set in motion. \r\n What are the reasons for all of this? They have to \r\ndo with the perception of a denial that people feel \r\nexists today. That denial is political in nature in terms \r\nof shared governance; it is also material in nature, as it \r\nrelates to the way people feel about how resources are \r\nallocated in their countries; it is also spiritual in nature, \r\nbecause of the general emptiness that people feel when \r\nit comes to realizing their human potential.  \r\n Politically, the age of totalitarianism and \r\nanti-democratic leadership styles is over. When it \r\ncomes to the use of their countries’ material resources, \r\npeople wish to see more equitable distribution and \r\napplication in ways that improve basic standards of \r\nliving. The ability to eat even a single meal or to \r\nreceive basic health care, education, affordable public \r\ntransport and housing is today at the top of the list of \r\npeople’s priorities. As leaders of the world, we must \r\nstop and we must answer. Now more than ever, the \r\nworld must allocate its resources equitably, ethically, \r\nsustainably and transparently. \r\n While we at the United Nations generally talk \r\nabout mediation as settling differences among nations, \r\nperhaps the real mediation has to be between \r\ngenerations. Leaders must now adopt styles of \r\nleadership that embrace active listening to the views of \r\nthose governed. Leaders must develop approaches that \r\nbuild consensus and promote participation, since \r\npeople now demand a greater say in how their futures \r\nare shaped. They want to author that future, not be \r\ndictated to. They want to arrive at a destiny that they \r\nhave shaped, not one that is shaped for them.  \r\n The defeat of economic and social demons will \r\ncome about only when there is unity of purpose, \r\nnationally and globally — a reality that is possible only \r\nwhen the energies of all stakeholders are harnessed \r\naround a common vision. A common vision cannot be \r\nfostered when conflicts, internal or external, are \r\nallowed to fester. This results in the further alienation \r\nof people who often resort to violence and socially \r\ndisruptive behaviour to solve disputes. \r\n Trinidad and Tobago has always advocated the \r\nsettlement of disputes by peaceful means. This is based \r\non our support for an international order founded on \r\nrespect for the rule of law. In this regard, we hold \r\nsacred the territorial sovereignty of States and the \r\ninalienable human rights and fundamental freedoms of \r\nindividuals. We also view the promotion of justice as \r\nindispensable to the maintenance of peace and security \r\nat the national, regional and global levels. \r\nNevertheless, none of these objectives would be \r\nattainable if there were no systems encouraging \r\nMember States to settle disputes peacefully. That is \r\nwhy we have always been vociferous in our support of \r\nthe work of the International Criminal Court and other \r\ntribunals established to promote peace by dispensing \r\njustice. \r\n Trinidad and Tobago relies heavily for its \r\neconomic development on the exploration and \r\nexploitation of the living and mineral resources of the \r\nmaritime zones within our national jurisdiction. In \r\ndoing this, we have had to delimit our maritime \r\nboundaries with neighbouring coastal States in \r\naccordance with the relevant provisions of the 1982 \r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and \r\nother applicable rules of international law. I can assure \r\nthe Assembly that this has been done by peaceful \r\nmeans, either through diplomatic negotiations or by \r\narbitration pursuant to the provisions of annex VII of \r\nthe Convention. \r\n Trinidad and Tobago recognizes the importance \r\nof the need to settle disputes by peaceful means. \r\nConsequently, we have become parties to several \r\nconventions for settling commercial and investment \r\ndisputes. These have been given the force of law in our \r\njurisdiction. For example, our 1996 Foreign Arbitral \r\nAwards Act gives effect to Trinidad and Tobago’s \r\nobligations under the 1958 Convention on the \r\nRecognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral \r\nAwards. Additionally, as a State party to the \r\nConvention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes \r\nbetween States and Nationals of Other States, we also \r\nrecognize that, like States, foreign nationals who invest \r\nin Trinidad and Tobago must be in a position to avail \r\nthemselves of the conciliation and arbitration services \r\nprovided by the International Centre for Settlement of \r\n A/66/PV.27\r\n \r\n19 11-51398 \r\n \r\nInvestment Disputes, which is an impartial \r\ninternational forum for resolving potential investment \r\ndisputes. Such treaties not only provide the requisite \r\nreassurance for investors, who know that any dispute \r\nthat may arise will be settled through an objective \r\nprocess; they also serve as incentives for would-be \r\ninvestors to do business in Trinidad and Tobago. \r\n We in Trinidad and Tobago support the position \r\ntaken by the International Court of Justice and the \r\nInternational Law Commission that all Member States \r\nare bound to refrain in their international relations \r\nfrom the threat or use of force against the territorial \r\nintegrity or political independence of any State, or in \r\nany other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the \r\nUnited Nations. It is for these reasons that we have \r\nalways upheld the position that border disputes in our \r\nregion or any part of the globe should he settled \r\npeacefully. It will be recalled that as far back as 1970, \r\nTrinidad and Tobago, through the good offices of our \r\nformer Prime Minister, the late Mr. Eric Williams, \r\nfacilitated the conclusion of the Protocol of Port-of-\r\nSpain, whereby Guyana and Venezuela agreed to a \r\n12-year moratorium on their border dispute. \r\n Since then, Trinidad and Tobago has supported \r\nother initiatives mounted by the Caribbean Community \r\n(CARICOM), the Organization of American States and \r\nthe United Nations aimed at resolving this dispute by \r\npeaceful means. Elsewhere in our region, we have \r\nencouraged the use of good offices and mediation to \r\nresolve the border dispute between Belize and Guyana, \r\nas well as internal disputes in Haiti. Our support for \r\nthese regional initiatives is in keeping with the \r\nprovisions of Article 52 of the Charter, which envisions \r\na role for regional organizations in the pacific \r\nsettlement of disputes. \r\n Further afield, we have always advocated that the \r\nMiddle East conflict should be settled peacefully. \r\nTrinidad and Tobago supports the quest of Palestinians \r\nfor a State of their own with secure borders, alongside \r\nthe State of Israel, whose borders must also be secure \r\nand free from terrorist attacks. The United Nations \r\nmust continue to show leadership and work with the \r\nArab League and other entities to resolve the decades-\r\nold conflict between Israel and Palestine so that there \r\ncan be lasting peace in the region. For far too long, we, \r\nlike the rest of the world, have witnessed the \r\nhorrendous loss of life and destruction of infrastructure \r\nwhich have erased the hopes and prospects of many \r\nyoung people for a bright future in the place of their \r\nbirth. \r\n The efforts of States at the national or regional \r\nlevels for the settlement of disputes emphasize their \r\nprimary responsibility under the Charter to settle \r\ndisputes peacefully. These are supplementary to and \r\nreinforce the role of the United Nations as mandated \r\nunder the Charter. Trinidad and Tobago therefore \r\nwelcomes the renewed emphasis placed by the United \r\nNations on mediation and other means for the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes, as demonstrated in the report of \r\nthe Secretary-General dated 8 April 2009 (S/2009/189), \r\nas well as the adoption on 22 June 2011 by the General \r\nAssembly of its resolution 65/283, entitled \r\n“Strengthening the role of mediation in the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes, conflict prevention and \r\nresolution”. \r\n During her contribution to the general debate last \r\nyear (see A/65/PV.20), The Honourable Prime Minister \r\nof Trinidad and Tobago, Mrs. Kamla Persad-Bissessar, \r\ntook the political initiative to call on the General \r\nAssembly to adopt a resolution on women, \r\ndisarmament, non-proliferation and arms control. That \r\nresolution, which was eventually adopted by the \r\nAssembly as resolution 65/69, calls on States to \r\npromote the equitable representation of women in all \r\ndecision-making processes with regard to matters \r\nrelated to disarmament, non-proliferation and arms \r\ncontrol. \r\n One year later, the United Nations continues to \r\nmake strides in placing women at the centre of all of its \r\nactivities. This has been reflected, for example, in the \r\nestablishment of the United Nations Entity for Gender \r\nEquality and the Empowerment of Women \r\n(UN-Women). Consistent with this action, Trinidad and \r\nTobago applauds the decision taken by Member States \r\nin resolution 65/283, which recognizes the importance \r\nof the full and effective participation of women at all \r\nlevels, at all stages and in all aspects of the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes, conflict prevention and \r\nresolution, as well as the need to address the lack of \r\nwomen as chief or lead peace mediators. \r\n Women are among the most vulnerable during \r\nconflicts, internal or otherwise, and hence must be \r\ninvolved in all vehicles relating to the settlement of \r\ndisputes and conflict prevention. The absence of \r\nwomen in the process could result in the development \r\nof peace agreements which are not comprehensive in \r\nA/66/PV.27  \r\n \r\n11-51398 20 \r\n \r\nscope and which may not address those issues that \r\naffect women during periods of conflict and which \r\ncontinue thereafter. \r\n The inclusion of women in the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes and conflict prevention is related \r\nto their involvement in the political process. Women, in \r\nwhatever part of the world, must not be left out of the \r\npolitical decision-making process. The Honourable \r\nPrime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago continues to \r\ndemonstrate her commitment to the participation of \r\nwomen in Government in meaningful ways, both \r\nnationally and internationally. Her advocacy with \r\nrespect to this issue resulted in the hosting in Trinidad \r\nand Tobago in 2011 of regional seminars to promote \r\nthis democratic and just cause.  \r\n Bearing in mind the significance of this subject, \r\nPrime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar, together with \r\nother States, the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme and UN-Women, successfully co-hosted a \r\nhigh-level colloquium on women’s political \r\nparticipation last Monday in the margins of the General \r\nAssembly. It was gratifying and fulfilling to see a room \r\noverflowing with women from all over the world \r\nchampioning the common cause of gender equality. \r\nThe event clearly demonstrated that the small size of a \r\ncountry is not a deterrent to the realization of big \r\ndreams and the fulfilment of wholesome ideals in the \r\npursuit of human development.  \r\n As part of the colloquium, the Prime Minister of \r\nTrinidad and Tobago was among those leaders who \r\nsigned a declaration on advancing women’s political \r\nparticipation. It is the hope of Trinidad and Tobago that \r\nthe outcome of this event will promote greater global \r\nconsciousness and discussions on the participation of \r\nwomen in Government and the advancement of \r\ndemocracy globally. In keeping with the objective of \r\nthis meeting, Trinidad and Tobago calls on Member \r\nStates to implement the provisions of resolution 65/283 \r\non the inclusion of women as mediators in the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes and conflict prevention. At the \r\nsame time, we would also welcome greater efforts to \r\nrecruit lead mediators from developing countries and \r\nfrom small countries, particularly small island \r\ndeveloping States, including in the Caribbean, \r\nconsistent with the principle of equitable geographic \r\ndistribution in the recruitment of United Nations \r\npersonnel. \r\n Like women, our young people are also very \r\nsusceptible to the negative effects of strife and \r\ntherefore they, too, must be protected. A number of \r\ncases before the International Criminal Court (ICC) \r\nshow that the perpetrators are on trial or under \r\ninvestigation for committing war crimes because they \r\nconscripted or enlisted children under the age of 15 \r\ninto their national armed forces or used them to \r\nparticipate actively in hostilities. In addition to \r\nmechanisms aimed at bringing the accused to justice, \r\nwe support all those aimed at rehabilitating young \r\npeople who have survived conflict so that they can \r\nadvance, reach their fullest potential and contribute to \r\nthe development of their societies. This can be \r\nachieved if they are able to enjoy their basic human \r\nrights. Thus we call on States that are in a position to \r\ndo so to contribute to UNICEF, the International \r\nCommittee of the Red Cross and the ICC Trust Fund \r\nfor Victims, which assist in the rehabilitation of \r\nchildren and other victims of armed conflict. \r\n Trinidad and Tobago endorses a number of other \r\nelements contained in resolution 65/283 relating to the \r\nstrengthening of the position of the United Nations in \r\nassisting States to develop their capacity to employ \r\nmediation and other peaceful means to resolve \r\ndisputes. While the adoption of the resolution is \r\nlaudable, it is only a means to an end. Member States \r\nmust ensure that all aspects of the resolution are \r\nimplemented fully. In this regard, Trinidad and Tobago \r\nwishes to underscore the importance of the provision \r\nof adequate resources to the Department of Political \r\nAffairs and its Mediation Support Unit. Without the \r\nrequired resources, the Secretary-General will not be \r\nable to effectively use his good offices and other \r\nmediation capacities to help resolve existing and future \r\ndisputes. \r\n The escalation of armed conflict and armed \r\nviolence is fuelled by several factors. One component \r\nis the illegal proliferation of conventional arms, \r\nincluding small arms and light weapons which have \r\nbeen diverted from the legal market to the illicit trade. \r\nThe United Nations, in keeping with its obligations \r\nunder the Charter to promote and maintain \r\ninternational peace and security, has recognized the \r\nimpact of the illegal trade in conventional arms on the \r\npeace and security of countries and regions and has \r\nadopted several resolutions and implemented different \r\nprogrammes to address this matter. \r\n A/66/PV.27\r\n \r\n21 11-51398 \r\n \r\n But for us in Trinidad and Tobago and the \r\nCARICOM region, the most ambitious measure \r\nundertaken so far is the decision to convene a \r\nconference in July 2012 to negotiate the text of an arms \r\ntrade treaty. Trinidad and Tobago and its CARICOM \r\npartners have been very active in the deliberations of \r\nmeetings of the Preparatory Committee examining \r\npossible elements for inclusion in the treaty. As we \r\napproach the 2012 conference and begin to reflect on \r\nitems to be included in the agreement, considerable \r\ncare must also be taken to ensure that there are \r\nadequate provisions for the settlement of disputes \r\nwhich may arise among future States parties on the \r\ninterpretation and application of the provisions of the \r\narms trade treaty. \r\n The absence of peaceful means to resolve \r\nconflicts has led to genocide, war crimes and other \r\npernicious misdeeds of concern to the international \r\ncommunity. In many cases, they have stymied \r\neconomic growth and social progress and have \r\ndestroyed human lives. They have limited the capacity \r\nof many States in conflict, especially those in the \r\ndeveloping world, to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. We must save current and future \r\ngenerations from the plague of war brought about by \r\nintolerance, xenophobia, border disputes and \r\ndisagreements over the allocation of resources. We in \r\nTrinidad and Tobago feel that a concrete way of doing \r\nthis — an intervention strategy — is to focus, as my \r\ncountry is focusing, on universal preschool education, \r\nbecause we believe that the human values that are \r\ninculcated in children from birth until ages 5 or 6 help \r\nthem to appreciate the value of peace and the value of \r\ninterpersonal peace. \r\n Additionally, the United Nations and other \r\nintergovernmental organizations must address the \r\nimpatience and restlessness of today’s young people, \r\nwho are fed up with the misallocation of resources and \r\nthe lack of both transparency and peoples’ involvement \r\nin the processes of governance. Their desires to \r\nreshape the world to reflect greater participation, \r\nempathy and democratic principles ought not be \r\nignored by leaders. We are convinced that those \r\naspirations will be achieved if mediation and other \r\npeaceful means of solving disputes, among other \r\nstrategies, are adopted — and not just among nations, \r\nbut among individuals and internally within countries.  \r\n Trinidad and Tobago remains committed to \r\nworking with regional partners, the United Nations and \r\nother actors to promote global peace. We must \r\nstrengthen our capacity to use mediation, \r\ncomplemented by the introduction of new approaches \r\nto Government and governance, such as the greater \r\nparticipation of women and a desire to build consensus. \r\n We believe that unless leaders listen more, unless \r\nwe employ mediation to resolve disputes, unless we \r\nincorporate our disenfranchised women in governance, \r\nunless we listen to the real message of today about \r\ngreater participation in governance, and unless we \r\nrealize that humankind has common challenges as it \r\naddresses issues like climate change, then the world \r\nwill have missed a golden opportunity to advance the \r\ncause of humankind and promote global peace. \r\n Let us therefore endeavour to resolve our \r\ncommon global challenges, for to do otherwise would \r\nbe to fail succeeding generations of humankind, for \r\nwhich we who meet here today will never be forgiven \r\nnor forgotten. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Gilbert Saboya Sunyé, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs and Institutional Relations of the \r\nPrincipality of Andorra.  \r\n Mr. Saboya Sunyé (Andorra) (spoke in Catalán; \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): First of all, I \r\nwould like to avail myself of this opportunity to \r\ncongratulate Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on his \r\nwell-deserved reappointment, and Mr. Nassir \r\nAbdulaziz Al-Nasser on his election as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. \r\n It is with pride, a sense of responsibility and a \r\nwill for cooperation and proactivity that I address this \r\nHall in the name of the Principality of Andorra and the \r\nGovernment that I have the honour to represent. The \r\nUnited Nations and the system of international law that \r\nemanates from it place all States on an equal footing. \r\nThat is especially important for States like Andorra, \r\nsmall in terms of territorial dimension but large in \r\nvalues and in history. \r\n Recent years have been marked by a profound \r\ncrisis of multiple aspects — economic, social, \r\nenvironmental and political — but most especially a \r\ncrisis of values. Now that we must all lay the \r\nfoundation for recovery, we need to be quite clear \r\nabout the values and principles on which we wish to \r\ncontinue constructing the world. We do not need to go \r\nmuch further than the founding spirit of the General \r\nA/66/PV.27  \r\n \r\n11-51398 22 \r\n \r\nAssembly, an institution in which all — large and \r\nsmall, the wealthier and the less endowed — address \r\none another on equal terms to promote peace, liberty \r\nand justice.  \r\n Just as the United Nations arose after a world war \r\nthat turned the world as it had existed until then upside \r\ndown, now again we have to be able to define the \r\nmoral and political bases of a new order. One priority \r\nset by the United Nations is inclusive and sustainable \r\ndevelopment. There can be no sustainability without \r\ninclusion. And if the Assembly, which arose from the \r\ndebris of a devastating war, is to give a voice to all the \r\npeoples of the planet, we have to be capable now of \r\nensuring that no one is excluded from the future that \r\nwe forge together. \r\n We must take care that the economic recovery \r\nfrom the recession does not further accentuate the \r\ninequalities — understood as a lack of equity — that \r\nalready exist. Thus, just as international law protects \r\nnations like ours that have no military potential, so too \r\neconomic growth must be especially attentive to the \r\nmore vulnerable in order to prevent the consequences \r\nof the recession from falling systematically on them. \r\n Thirty years ago, in 1981, the United Nations \r\nheld its first Conference on the Least Developed \r\nCountries. The fourth Conference was held last spring, \r\nattesting to the difficulty of achieving significant \r\nchanges to improve the weakness and vulnerability of \r\nthose States. Further, we observe with concern how, \r\nagainst the background of the global recession, some of \r\nthe more developed countries often adopt protectionist \r\nattitudes. On the conviction that a freer world is a more \r\njust world, we also have to state that a more open and \r\nless protectionist world leads to a more equitable \r\nbalance and improvements for the disadvantaged. \r\n Andorra, with its small scale, secular stability and \r\nseclusion among mountains, is dealing with the far-\r\nreaching process of opening its economy. We also have \r\nplanned the construction of a model of inclusive \r\ngrowth that leaves no one out — a model that cannot \r\nbe constructed by turning one’s back on the \r\ninternational community or by being isolated from the \r\nworld. \r\n I have been talking about economic opening, but \r\nthe opening to the world cannot be strictly economic, \r\nand it is crystal clear that recovery from the crisis and a \r\nnew phase of growth will not come about solely as a \r\nresult of economic measures. The search for an \r\ninclusive and sustainable balance must necessarily \r\ninvolve addressing factors that are not strictly \r\neconomic but that do accentuate inequalities between \r\ncountries. \r\n In that connection, we note the work done at the \r\n2011 High-level Meeting of the General Assembly on \r\nAIDS held in June and the Political Declaration on \r\nHIV/AIDS (resolution 65/277) adopted by the \r\nparticipating States, stating their intension to intensify \r\ntheir efforts in the fight against this pandemic. In spite \r\nof the advances achieved in recent years, HIV is a \r\nsymbol of how necessary it is for progress to reach \r\neveryone equally. While in the more developed \r\ncountries AIDS has become a chronic illness \r\nappropriately treated, in the more disadvantaged \r\nareas — especially in sub-Saharan Africa — the \r\ndisease is still lethal, especially in the communities \r\nwith the fewest resources.  \r\n Above and beyond the increase of resources for \r\nresearch and treatment and greater North-South \r\ncooperation, I am convinced that the extension of \r\ndemocracy and human rights is also a key factor in the \r\nfight against a pandemic that overwhelms the poorest, \r\nbut that also hits peoples submerged in ignorance and \r\noppression. \r\n With all of that, the extent of the commitments \r\nmade and the progress achieved by various States in \r\nthe fight against HIV should be a source of \r\nsatisfaction, since seldom has the international \r\ncommunity been capable of articulating a response so \r\nrapid and unanimous when faced with a threat on this \r\nscale. It would be wonderful if the same level of \r\nawareness and commitment could be achieved in the \r\nfight against non-communicable diseases, such as \r\ncardiovascular disease, cancer and diabetes. Those \r\nalso — although perhaps not so clearly as in the case of \r\nAIDS — are diseases that accentuate the inequalities \r\namong countries. That principle was recognized in the \r\nPolitical Declaration (resolution 66/2) of the High-\r\nlevel Meeting of the General Assembly on the \r\nprevention and control of non-communicable diseases \r\nheld recently. \r\n Such successes cannot allow us to forget that one \r\nof the most serious challenges facing the international \r\ncommunity and this Assembly, which is its highest \r\nrepresentation, is the fight against climate change. To \r\ndate, humankind was used to overcoming recessions \r\nand times of crisis, entering a new phase of growth, \r\n A/66/PV.27\r\n \r\n23 11-51398 \r\n \r\nwithout thinking of the negative external effects of that \r\ngrowth. We now know that growth cannot be at any \r\nprice and that development must be sustainable in \r\neconomic terms, but also, and more particularly, in \r\nenvironmental terms.  \r\n That is why the threat of climate change is as \r\ngreat as or stronger than that of the global recession. \r\nSome developed countries, in particular those that \r\nsurvive on their own natural resources, are seriously \r\nthreatened by climate change. That may also be the \r\ncase for Andorra, which bases a good part of its \r\neconomic welfare on snow and mountain tourism. That \r\nis why we will always support any initiative aiming at \r\ngreater awareness of the need to combat climate \r\nchange, and take steps to adapt to what is probably \r\nalready a reality. In that context, we should underscore \r\nthe entry into force in Andorra of the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change on 31 May. \r\n We should never lose sight of the fact that the \r\nmain goal of the United Nations is to guarantee peace \r\nand security in a context of freedom and respect for \r\nhuman rights. Just as in the past, States emerged to \r\nensure the social peace and individual freedom of their \r\ncitizens, the United Nations also have their raison \r\nd’être in the maintenance of peace and security and the \r\nrule of international law. \r\n Today, we speak of inclusive and sustainable \r\neconomic growth and of a new and profound awareness \r\nof the threat of climate change. We cannot forget that \r\nsuch issues are closely linked to the promotion of a \r\nsafer world. Growth that leaves more vulnerable \r\ngroups behind and that excludes the least developed \r\ncountries, added to the effects of climate change, leads \r\nto a less safe and less stable world. \r\n This year marks the tenth anniversary of the \r\ntragic attacks of 11 September here in New York, the \r\nseat of United Nations Headquarters. As President \r\nObama recalled last Wednesday (see A/66/PV.11), we \r\nare today seeing the symbol of New York’s renewal \r\nrise at ground zero, where 10 years ago there was an \r\nopen wound and twisted steel, a shattered heart in the \r\ncentre of the city. \r\n This year, we close the first decade of the \r\nmillennium without having resolved the threat to the \r\nsecurity of our world, that is, international terrorism. \r\nDespite progress on that front, the threat continues. \r\nTerrorism arises from hatred and wickedness. \r\nHowever, we must be aware that it dwells, in \r\nparticular, where there is a lack of economic prospects, \r\nilliteracy, lack of culture, poverty, marginality — \r\nwhere, in short, there is a lack of democracy. \r\n That is why, in the promotion of a safer world, \r\nour efforts will always be needed to combat all kinds \r\nof discrimination. In that regard, I wish to underscore \r\nthe political declaration against racism, racial \r\ndiscrimination and xenophobia and related intolerance \r\nthat was adopted at that time during the General \r\nAssembly. It is also 10 years since the Durban \r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action. Today, as the \r\nStates represented here, we say that we cannot afford to \r\nlower our guard since, in an increasingly globalized \r\nand complex world, the threat of discrimination is \r\ngrowing. \r\n At the beginning of my statement, I spoke of the \r\nneed to continue building the world on the principles \r\nand values that inspire this Assembly. Allow me now to \r\nrecall the spirit and the philosophy of the twenty-eighth \r\nPresident of the United States, President Wilson, father \r\nof the League of Nations, the precursor of today’s \r\nUnited Nations. Wilson taught us that it was of little \r\nuse to be democrats at home if we were not capable of \r\nexporting democracy beyond our borders, and that a \r\nState that turned its back on countries still living under \r\noppression and in which the most fundamental rights \r\nand freedoms were not respected could not presume to \r\nbe democratic. \r\n That is why we must welcome with an especially \r\npositive attitude what we have called the Arab Spring. \r\nWe sincerely hope that those movements for \r\ndemocracy strengthen in the future. In that context, in \r\nJuly, we supported South Sudan becoming the \r\n193rd member of the United Nations. Today, we are \r\npleased at that reality and we most warmly welcome it. \r\nA more democratic world is a more dynamic world, but \r\nalso safer because it is fairer. Most failures of security \r\nin our world, as I said a moment ago, are fuelled by \r\ninjustice. \r\n Likewise, with regard to the Israeli-Palestinian \r\nconflict, we must keep encouraging dialogue and \r\nmediation. The Palestinian people’s aspiration to have \r\na democratic and peaceful State is as legitimate as the \r\nIsraeli desire to obtain guarantees for its existence and \r\nsecurity. The final aim of a mutual recognition of two \r\nStates by two peoples, on the basis of the 1967 lines \r\nwith the agreed and equivalent exchanges, is now \r\nunder discussion.  \r\nA/66/PV.27  \r\n \r\n11-51398 24 \r\n \r\n A possible intermediate step, in a shorter term, by \r\nbecoming an observer State could represent an element \r\nof hope for the Palestinian people, provided that it is \r\nnot used for purposes that are incompatible with \r\ncontinuing negotiations, but for the aforementioned \r\ngoal. Israel also must contribute to that spirit, avoiding \r\nattitudes that could affect the final status. \r\n Andorra is a country that has lived for more than \r\n700 years without an army, without taking part in any \r\nwar and without internal conflicts. The perpetual peace \r\nand permanent stability, of which we Andorrans are \r\nproud, is not founded on an autocratic regime that \r\ncontrols its people with an iron fist or on a whim \r\nresulting from the deterrence of larger or more \r\npowerful neighbours. No, the ultimate reason for a \r\npeace and security maintained for more than seven \r\ncenturies has been the ongoing effort to respect \r\nindividual rights and freedoms and the rule of justice \r\nand of fairness, and the existence of mechanisms of \r\nsolidarity, as was well demonstrated in the recent \r\nuniversal periodic review. \r\n Our democracy and our centuries-old \r\nparliamentary system are not the fruit of peace and \r\nstability, but the reverse. Peace, security and stability \r\nare the fruits of democracy because, without \r\ndemocracy, there is no possibility of peace or lasting \r\nsecurity either in Andorra or anywhere in the world. \r\n From the position of humility that governs our \r\nsupport for the United Nations, we wish to reaffirm \r\nhere the idea of commitment as a fundamental value \r\nand the linchpin of our political action. That \r\ncommitment is understood as a deep belief not only in \r\npeace and equal opportunities, but also as an \r\ninvolvement in and shouldering of individual \r\nresponsibilities regarding a common project and, last \r\nbut not least, as a wish for dialogue and understanding. \r\nOn Wednesday, President Sarkozy stated in this \r\nAssembly: “Let us choose the path of compromise, \r\nwhich is neither renunciation nor repudiation, but \r\nwhich allows us to move forward, step by step” \r\n(A/66/PV.11). Andorra will continue to work towards \r\nsuch a commitment within the Organization. \r\n The Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the general debate for this meeting.  \r\n Several representatives have requested to exercise \r\ntheir right of reply. I wish to remind members that \r\nstatements in exercise of the right of reply are limited \r\nto 10 minutes for the first intervention and to five \r\nminutes for second interventions, and should be made \r\nby delegations from their seats. \r\n Mr. Mostahkam (Islamic Republic of Iran): \r\nToday, the representative of the United Arab Emirates \r\nreferred in his remarks to three Iranian Islands located \r\nin the Persian Gulf. My delegation would like to make \r\nit clear that those islands are an eternal part of Iranian \r\nterritory and are under the sovereignty of the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran. As such, we regret the use of \r\ninappropriate qualifications for these Iranian islands in \r\nthe Persian Gulf. \r\n The Islamic Republic of Iran, while stressing its \r\ndetermination to continue its friendly relations with the \r\nneighbouring United Arab Emirates, reiterates that all \r\nactions and measures taken on the Iranian island of \r\nAbu Musa have been in exercise of its sovereign rights \r\nand in accordance with the arrangements emanating \r\nfrom the documents exchanged in 1971. The Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran stands ready to continue its bilateral \r\ntalks with relevant officials of the United Arab \r\nEmirates with a view to removing any \r\nmisunderstanding that may exist in this regard. \r\n Moreover, the Islamic Republic of Iran wishes to \r\nstress that the only correct and historically and \r\nuniversally recognized name for the sea between Iran \r\nand the Arabian peninsula is, as the United Nations has \r\nitself also emphasized, the Persian Gulf. Therefore, any \r\nuse of fabricated names for that body of water is totally \r\ngroundless, absolutely unacceptable and of no legal, \r\ngeographical or political value. \r\n Mr. Salem (Egypt): My delegation has requested \r\nto speak in exercise of the right of reply to the utterly \r\nfalse allegations made by the Foreign Minister of \r\nCanada against Egypt. We would advise the Foreign \r\nMinister to follow closely the events that took place \r\nduring the 25 January revolution in Egypt and the \r\nsocial solidarity it set as an example to the entire \r\nworld.  \r\n He should note that Muslims and Copts stood \r\ntogether, side by side, during that revolution and \r\nremained so thereafter. Since 25 January, no Copt has \r\nbeen harassed and no church been trespassed. We are \r\nnot surprised that those false allegations come from \r\nCanada which, among other things, baselessly \r\nconsiders itself a custodian of human rights in the \r\nworld, making false accusations against sovereign \r\ncountries without carefully studying the true facts or \r\nthe conditions and circumstances surrounding them. \r\n A/66/PV.27\r\n \r\n25 11-51398 \r\n \r\n Mr. Al-Yafei (United Arab Emirates) (spoke in \r\nArabic): I find myself compelled to exercise my right \r\nof reply in response to the representative of Iran, who \r\nspoke a few minutes ago, misleading the Assembly \r\nabout his country’s occupation of three islands \r\nbelonging to the Emirates: the Greater and Lesser \r\nTunbs and Abu Musa. I will also address the false, void \r\nand illegal allegations made about those islands.  \r\n My Government has repeatedly made known its \r\nestablished, principled position vis-à-vis its national \r\ncause and reiterates its severe disappointment at the \r\nrepeated allegations made by the representatives of \r\nIran annually in this Hall to the effect that their \r\ncountry’s occupation of the three islands that belong to \r\nmy country is a misunderstanding. \r\n That position flies in the face of all \r\ndocumentation and all historic, demographic and legal \r\nfacts and realities that prove that the three islands are \r\nan integral part of the territory of the United Arab \r\nEmirates and its national sovereignty, and that they are \r\nalso part of the continental shelf, air space and \r\nexclusive economic zone of the Emirates. These facts \r\nare indivisible and cannot be diminished.  \r\n Therefore, based on the purposes and principles \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations and the rules of \r\ninternational law, my country reiterates its categorical \r\nrejection of the Iranian occupation and all military and \r\ncivilian measures that Iran continues to adopt with a \r\nview to changing the demographic and historic nature \r\nof the islands, consolidating their occupation and \r\ncircumventing the question of occupation by invoking \r\nmarginal issues that are the result of its occupation of \r\nthe islands, without addressing the issue of the \r\noccupation itself. \r\n We hope that the international community will act \r\nto urge the Muslim Iranian Government to translate its \r\ngood and peaceful intentions into deeds, whether \r\nthrough unconditional bilateral negotiations between \r\nthe two countries or by petitioning the International \r\nCourt of Justice for a legal opinion on this matter. That \r\nwould put an end to the occupation of the three islands \r\nand return them to the sovereignty of the United Arab \r\nEmirates. \r\n  The meeting rose at 9.20 p.m. \r\n"
