(Qatar) \r\n \r\n \r\n In the absence of the President, Mr. Meetarbhan \r\n(Mauritius), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 9.10 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 8 (continued) \r\n \r\n  General debate \r\n \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Hamady Ould Hamady, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs and Cooperation of the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Mauritania. \r\n Mr. Ould Hamady (Mauritania) (spoke in \r\nArabic): It is my honour and pleasure at the outset of \r\nthis brief statement to welcome and congratulate the \r\nRepublic of South Sudan upon its accession to \r\nmembership in the United Nations and for its \r\nparticipation for the first time in the work of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n I am also happy to warmly congratulate \r\nMr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on his election to the \r\npresidency of the Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. \r\nAllow me to express our full confidence in him as he \r\nundertakes the exceptional efforts required to \r\nstrengthen the progress achieved to date in terms of \r\ninternational peace and security, taking into account \r\nthe need to preserve the well-being, stability and \r\nprogress of our world. I pay tribute to the effectiveness \r\nof Qatari diplomacy and its important role in \r\nstrengthening international peace and security.  \r\n I also pay tribute to the valuable efforts made by \r\nMr. Al-Nasser’s predecessor, Mr. Joseph Deiss, who \r\nupheld the principles of dialogue and consultation in \r\norder to reach the best solutions on international issues. \r\nI also warmly congratulate Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon on his reappointment to head the \r\nOrganization and wish him full success. I commend his \r\npersistent Herculean efforts to resolve many issues, \r\nincluding strengthening international peace and \r\nsecurity, achieving the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs), combating climate change and mitigating the \r\nthreats of famine and endemic disease, as well as all of \r\nthe challenges that hinder the well-being of humanity. \r\n The sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly \r\nis taking place at a sensitive political juncture in our \r\nregion. The popular uprisings in many Arab countries \r\nhave led to revolutions calling for democracy, justice, \r\nfreedom and decent living conditions. My country was \r\nat the forefront of meeting these demands and \r\naspirations. Over the past few years, we have \r\nexperienced radical change in the form of a peaceful \r\nand flexible transition from a totalitarian regime that \r\nhad suppressed freedoms and emptied the public \r\ncoffers to a democratic system and credible institutions \r\nthat have consolidated the rule of law and guaranteed \r\nindividual and collective freedoms and the rights of all \r\nsectors of Mauritanian society, based on justice and the \r\nrule of law. \r\n Those measures have included the organization of \r\nfree, fair and transparent presidential elections that \r\nwere monitored by international observers and even \r\nendorsed by their opponents. Our country has also \r\nA/66/PV.28  \r\n \r\n11-51670 2 \r\n \r\nbegun enjoying a sincere political openness at all levels \r\nof society. A few days ago, we launched a genuine \r\nnational political dialogue open to all of the country’s \r\npolitical parties. In addition, media airwaves have been \r\nfreed and licences issued to 10 radio and television \r\nstations to begin broadcasting in the near future. \r\n In the context of good governance, my country \r\nhas enshrined transparency in its administration and its \r\nstrengthened and independent judiciary. We have \r\nachieved remarkable levels of growth through \r\nambitious programmes to improve our population’s \r\nstandard of living. These programmes focus first and \r\nforemost on the most vulnerable sectors of society — \r\nlow-income citizens and those living in poor \r\nneighbourhoods and isolated rural areas — allowing \r\nmy country to achieve a stable domestic situation that \r\nwill in turn foster efforts in our young, effective \r\ndiplomacy.  \r\n We are a member of the African Union Peace and \r\nSecurity Council and chair the Good Offices \r\nCommission, established to bring together opposition \r\nparties in Libya and Côte d’Ivoire. We are fully \r\nconvinced that dialogue and mediation are the best \r\nways to resolve conflict and address crises, as \r\nindicated in the theme of the general debate of this \r\nsixty-sixth session. \r\n Since the election of His Excellency \r\nMr. Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz as President, we have \r\nendeavoured to strengthen our presence within regional \r\nand international organizations, including the United \r\nNations and its various specialized bodies, the Arab \r\nMaghreb Union, the League of Arab States, the African \r\nUnion, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and \r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement, to name a few. We have \r\nalso joined regional African and Caribbean groups to \r\nshow support for their systems and decisions and as \r\npart of our strategy to broaden our principled foreign \r\npolicy. \r\n In that context, we reiterate our support for \r\nefforts to reform the United Nations and its various \r\nbodies, including the Security Council. We ask that \r\nAfrica be given permanent representation, as it is the \r\nonly continent that has lacked a permanent seat on the \r\nSecurity Council since the establishment of the United \r\nNations. Our continent has 1 billion inhabitants and \r\nhosts more than two-thirds of United Nations \r\npeacekeeping operations. We also call for permanent \r\nrepresentation for the Group of Arab States, whose \r\npopulation makes up more than 11 per cent of the \r\nworld’s inhabitants.  \r\n Consultations on Security Council reform have \r\nbeen ongoing for many years, and we call for \r\ncontinued consultations in order to achieve a \r\ncomprehensive platform, supported unanimously by \r\nMember States, for reform of the United Nations and \r\nits working methods and decision-making processes. In \r\nthat regard, my country believes that we should begin \r\nwith the make-up of the Security Council, the \r\ndefinition of its competence and responsibilities, and \r\ninstitutional relations between the Council and the \r\nGeneral Assembly in order to ensure the Organization’s \r\neffectiveness and to fairly and accurately reflect, in a \r\nbalanced manner, the will of the entire international \r\ncommunity.  \r\n In that context, I remind the Assembly that \r\nMauritania is a candidate for a non-permanent seat on \r\nthe Security Council for the biennium 2012-2013, \r\nrepresenting the Group of African States. Support for \r\nour candidacy was expressed by our continental \r\norganization, the African Union, at its Addis Ababa \r\nsummit in January and Malabo summit in June. It also \r\nsupports our conviction and profound belief in the \r\nmission and principles of the United Nations and our \r\nsincere will to effectively contribute to the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, play a \r\npositive role in the Security Council, and assume \r\ngreater responsibilities in order to attain the noble \r\nobjectives for which this Organization was created. \r\n I note that Mauritania has adopted a policy of \r\npeaceful coexistence and good-neighbourly relations \r\nwith the countries of its region. It is not party to any \r\nconflict and enjoys excellent and friendly relations \r\nwith all countries of the world. I take this opportunity \r\nto sincerely thank all of the friendly, kindred States that \r\nhave supported our candidacy. \r\n We note with deep satisfaction the gargantuan \r\nefforts made during the sixty-fifth session, including \r\nthe High-level Meeting on Youth and the High-level \r\nPlenary Meeting on the MDGs and the need to \r\nimplement them. Nevertheless, we note and deplore the \r\nfact that the populations of most States continue to live \r\nin dire economic conditions that are not conducive to \r\nthe achievement of the MDGs.  \r\n In that context, allow me to recall the steep rise in \r\nunemployment, especially among young people; the \r\nincreased rate of abject poverty, especially in the most \r\n A/66/PV.28\r\n \r\n3 11-51670 \r\n \r\nvulnerable sectors of society; the decelerated growth in \r\ngross domestic product; the global recession; decreased \r\nofficial foreign investment, especially in Africa; the \r\nvolatility of basic commodity prices, which has had \r\ndevastating effects on the buying power of large \r\nsectors of the populations of developing countries; \r\nreduced net transfers to developing countries; \r\ndecreased tourist revenue; increased maternal and \r\nnewborn death rates; and the increased debt burden. \r\n This latter issue is already a terrible economic \r\nburden on developing countries, and leads to the \r\nemptying of public coffers that are modest to begin \r\nwith, especially in the light of their infrastructure and \r\npublic service needs. In such economic conditions, the \r\neconomies of the least developed countries face many \r\nenormous obstacles, making it increasingly difficult to \r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals. As we \r\napproach the deadline for achieving the MDGs, many \r\ndeveloping countries remain far from doing so.  \r\n We call on wealthy developed States to \r\ncontribute, in accordance with their promises, to the \r\nrevival of these least developed countries so that they \r\ncan provide acceptable levels of public services and \r\nguarantee civil peace, security and stability, and to \r\nstrengthen the social fabric of these countries, which in \r\nturn will contribute to international peace and security. \r\n Non-communicable diseases are another \r\nimportant public health issue. The extent of the spread \r\nof these diseases is truly catastrophic, and mortality \r\nrates are higher than those of all other diseases. \r\nFurthermore, their effects on health and the social and \r\neconomic fields are a further obstacle to the attainment \r\nof the MDGs, especially Goals 4 and 5 relative to \r\nmaternal and child health, which are closely linked to \r\nnon-communicable diseases. This is especially true \r\nbecause malnutrition in pregnancy and early childhood \r\nis the source of hypertension and diabetes later in life.  \r\n This is why I note with satisfaction that my \r\ncountry has risen to the challenge posed by these \r\ndiseases by establishing extensive health infrastructure \r\nand strengthening the human resources available to \r\ndeal with such diseases. We have also built a \r\nspecialized oncology hospital with the latest \r\ntechnology, a modern hospital for cardiovascular \r\ndisease, a diabetes treatment centre and over 50 dialysis \r\ncentres. All of these have been established in record \r\ntime, less than two years since the accession to power \r\nof Mr. Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz following the \r\npresidential elections of 18 July 2009.  \r\n Our country is closely following the situation in \r\nthe Western Sahara. We reaffirm our support for the \r\nefforts of the Secretary-General and his Special \r\nRepresentative to reach a comprehensive, lasting and \r\njust solution that enjoys the support of both countries, \r\nin order to strengthen peace and security in the area \r\nand to create an Arab Maghreb that is open to progress \r\nand development and responds to the aspirations of its \r\npeoples. This is a strategic option for my country. \r\n I believe that the Israeli-Arab conflict is a source \r\nof tension and a threat to peace and security in a \r\nsensitive and vital region of the world. My country \r\nsupports efforts for peace that will guarantee the \r\nrecovery of all the rights of the Palestinian people and \r\nthe creation of an independent Palestinian State within \r\nthe 4 June 1967 borders, with its capital in Jerusalem, \r\ncoexisting in peace and security with the State of \r\nIsrael.  \r\n This is why the Islamic Republic of Mauritania \r\ncalls on the international community to recognize \r\nPalestine as an independent sovereign State and to \r\nfacilitate its full membership of the United Nations on \r\nthe basis of the request made last week by \r\nMr. Mahmoud Abbas, Executive Secretary of the \r\nPalestine Liberation Organization and President of the \r\nPalestinian Authority. We must be faithful to the \r\nhistoric responsibilities of the international community \r\ntowards Palestine; uphold justice, credibility and \r\nfairness with regard to this question; and ensure respect \r\nfor the relevant resolutions of international legitimacy. \r\nWe condemn the ongoing blockade of the Gaza Strip \r\nand the acts committed by the Israeli military machine, \r\nkilling civilians and destroying Palestinian facilities.  \r\n We call for concerted Arab, regional and \r\ninternational efforts to assist our Libyan brothers and \r\nsisters. We seek an end to the killings and a response to \r\nthe legitimate aspirations to reform and change of our \r\nkindred people of Libya in order to guarantee their \r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity. We call on the \r\ninternational community to support the Libyan people \r\nand provide for all their needs in various areas so as to \r\nensure the success of the transitional phase.  \r\n We also call on the international community to \r\nintensify and accelerate the international response to \r\nthe tragic humanitarian situation resulting from the \r\nacute drought in the Horn of Africa. Speedy assistance \r\nA/66/PV.28  \r\n \r\n11-51670 4 \r\n \r\nmust be provided to the hundreds of thousands of \r\nSomalis citizens who have been forced to become \r\nrefugees and are enduring tragic living and security \r\nconditions. Although our means are modest, we have \r\nprovided assistance in the amount of $1 million to \r\nsupport the efforts of the African Union on behalf of \r\nthe people of Somalia.  \r\n For many years now, our region, the African \r\nSahel, has been the stage for the expansion of \r\norganized crime networks that traffic in drugs, \r\nweapons, ammunition and human beings, and are \r\nresponsible for illegal migration flows across the area, \r\nkidnappings, abductions and terrorism. They pose a \r\nreal threat to the peace and stability of our region.  \r\n We are convinced that there is a direct and close \r\nrelationship between peace, development and \r\ndemocracy. For this reason, we believe that peace and \r\nsecurity are preconditions to achieving development \r\nand democracy and to strengthening the rule of law \r\ninstitutions. We have adopted laws, prepared plans and \r\ntaken steps to guarantee peace, security and safety for \r\nour citizens and foreign citizens living legally in \r\nMauritania. Our security system has responded firmly \r\nand courageously to the threats of criminal terrorist \r\ngroups against our security and that of our guests. We \r\nhave succeeded in guaranteeing peace within our \r\nborders and security at border points, as attested to by \r\nall. We work in full understanding and coordination \r\nwith Algeria, Mali and Niger to suppress the activities \r\nand free movement of these criminal terrorist groups. \r\n The culture of peace, the ideals of tolerance \r\namong nations and civilizations, and upholding justice \r\nand law among peoples are the best ways to advance \r\non the road to peace and security in our world. \r\nHowever, when issues remain pending for years; when \r\nthere is a growing gap between rich and poor; when \r\ninternational economic institutions are fragile and \r\nweak; and when justice, fairness and equality are so \r\nslow to be provided, tensions will increase and \r\nextremism and terrorism spread. We in Mauritania \r\nreject terrorism in every form, and we adhere to the \r\npeaceful principles of Islam — principles of tolerance \r\nand brotherhood that reject violence and extremism. \r\nWe believe that the international community should \r\nconsider seriously why terrorism exists and root it out \r\nvigorously. \r\n The international community must honour the \r\ncommitments it has made since the Organization was \r\nestablished, but it can do so only if all the States and \r\npeoples of the world are able to benefit from available \r\npotential and resources and if development efforts in \r\ndeveloping countries are supported so that people can \r\nlive in dignity, freedom and equality. That is the only \r\nway we can achieve the noble goals that this \r\nOrganization set for itself when it was created. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on Her \r\nExcellency Ms. Antonella Mularoni, Minister for \r\nForeign and Political Affairs, Telecommunications and \r\nTransportation of the Republic of San Marino. \r\n Ms. Mularoni (San Marino): On behalf of the \r\nGovernment of the Republic of San Marino, I wish to \r\ncongratulate Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on his \r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-sixth session. His long experience as Ambassador \r\nof Qatar to the United Nations and his deep knowledge \r\nof this Organization will be valuable resources in \r\nhelping us move ahead with the reforms needed in the \r\nmost important areas of United Nations activity. Over \r\nthe past few years, Qatar has played a significant \r\nmediation role in the Arab world. The delegation of \r\nSan Marino will cooperate fully in the work to be done. \r\n I also wish to sincerely thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his energy and \r\npraiseworthy efforts, for the interest he constantly \r\ndisplays in all United Nations Member States, and for \r\nhis constant and crucial presence in every politically \r\nimportant situation and emergency worldwide. His \r\nreappointment to a second term is important to \r\npromoting reform of the United Nations, guaranteeing \r\nthe Organization’s full effectiveness and preventing \r\nany action aimed at decentralizing global governance. \r\n I take this opportunity to express my sincere \r\ngratitude for the excellent work done by the United \r\nNations, under the careful and effective leadership of \r\nthe Secretary-General, in South Sudan. By putting an \r\nend to the violence and atrocities that have plagued \r\nthat part of Africa for several years, the United Nations \r\naction led to the Republic of South Sudan’s declaration \r\nof independence and its admission to our Organization \r\nas a new Member in July. \r\n On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the \r\ntragic attack on the World Trade Center in New York, I \r\nwould like to stress the importance of effectively \r\ncombating terrorism and taking action to prevent the \r\nformation and development of terrorist groups. A \r\n A/66/PV.28\r\n \r\n5 11-51670 \r\n \r\ncrucial task of policymakers is to create conditions in \r\nwhich terrorism cannot find a breeding ground. \r\n This year’s theme of the general debate, “The \r\nrole of mediation in the settlement of disputes by \r\npeaceful means”, unquestionably represents the \r\npurposes of diplomacy and the fundamental reason \r\nwhy States decided to cooperate within the framework \r\nof international bodies and mechanisms, headed by the \r\nUnited Nations. In a certain sense, it is also closely \r\nconnected to the reform process of our Organization. \r\n The principle of the peaceful settlement of \r\ndisputes between States is enshrined in the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations and in many General Assembly \r\nresolutions, and the Republic of San Marino can only \r\nsupport that principle. Indeed, our country has always \r\ntried to settle conflicts by peaceful means and has \r\nalways believed in the power of dialogue, democracy \r\nand tolerance — values on which peaceful coexistence \r\namong peoples is based. With a view to achieving this \r\nprinciple in order to maintain international peace and \r\nsecurity, the Republic of San Marino supports the role \r\nand authority of the General Assembly and the Security \r\nCouncil. \r\n This year we have witnessed a massive popular \r\nuprising spreading across the squares of cities in North \r\nAfrica and the Middle East. These are protests for \r\ndemocracy and freedom, respect for human rights and \r\nsocial justice. At the forefront of this revolution are \r\nyoung people from the middle classes. Despite their \r\neducation, they have found themselves excluded from \r\nthe labour market or suffering under poor working \r\nconditions. \r\n The unusual scale of the Arab revolution, which \r\nhas taken the world by surprise, demonstrates that \r\nmajor political and institutional changes are needed, \r\nbecause our economic and social foundations have also \r\nchanged as a result of globalization. We cannot \r\nconsider this spontaneous uprising of people looking \r\nfor freedom, justice and democracy only in terms of \r\nsecurity. If the United Nations intends to play a pivotal \r\nrole in managing global governance, it should also be \r\nable to interpret the need for such changes and to \r\nsupport them, as far as possible. San Marino believes \r\nthat the United Nations must continue to play a leading \r\nrole in managing global governance. The deeply \r\ndemocratic nature of our Organization, with its \r\nuniversal participation and undisputed legitimacy, as \r\nwell as the richness and diversity of cultures and \r\ntraditions that are represented here, allow us to adopt \r\nan approach aimed at harmonizing the interests of the \r\nentire international community and at achieving \r\nsustainable human development. \r\n The global economic and financial crisis, the \r\ndevastating consequences of which are evident to all, \r\nhas unfortunately demonstrated that our existing \r\ninstitutions are unable to respond rapidly and \r\nadequately to such crises. This has led to a growth in \r\nthe influence of some informal groups, such as the \r\nGroup of Eight and the Group of 20 (G-20), on the \r\nmanagement of global economic governance. San \r\nMarino is grateful to those groups and for the role they \r\nhave played.  \r\n However, we believe it important to emphasize \r\nthat in their decision-making process, which should be \r\nmore transparent and inclusive, it is essential that they \r\ntake into account the interests, worries and aspirations \r\nof States outside their groups, particularly developing \r\ncountries. The actions of such informal groups should \r\nbe complementary to those of the United Nations, \r\nwhich will require the development of specific \r\nmechanisms to regulate their relations with our \r\nOrganization. We welcome the Secretary-General’s \r\nparticipation in the G-20 meetings and the \r\nconsultations held by the rotating presidencies with the \r\nUnited Nations. However, we stress the importance of \r\ntransparency in relations between these informal \r\ngroups and the United Nations system, the only \r\nOrganization in a position to take decisions whose \r\nlegitimacy no one can challenge. \r\n The Republic of San Marino is concerned about \r\nthe consequences of the economic and financial crisis \r\nand other crises closely and inevitably linked to it. \r\nUnemployment is a very serious problem that faces \r\nevery country without distinction. Furthermore, in \r\nmany States the youth unemployment rate is twice as \r\nhigh as that for adults. Long-term unemployment has \r\nalso risen in the past few years. We believe that the \r\nUnited Nations should pay special attention to the issue \r\nof unemployment.  \r\n Unfortunately, the negative effects of the global \r\neconomic and financial crisis are still visible today. \r\nAlthough the international economy experienced a \r\nmodest recovery last year, we have not yet emerged \r\nfrom the 2008 crisis. And beyond the problem of \r\nunemployment, we are now confronting a global \r\nsovereign debt crisis. \r\nA/66/PV.28  \r\n \r\n11-51670 6 \r\n \r\n Is there a good recipe for recovery from the \r\ncrisis? Is a rigorous economic policy sufficient? Do \r\ninnovative measures for relaunching the world’s \r\neconomy exist? Can these measures be shared, or are \r\nwe facing a deep systemic crisis requiring an in-depth \r\nanalysis of the way our societies function and a \r\nrethinking of current business models? I believe that if \r\nthe United Nations focused on these important issues, \r\nits leading role in global governance could not be \r\nquestioned by anyone. \r\n The destinies of our peoples are linked to global \r\nthreats in an increasingly direct way. Today, the threats \r\nof climate change and biodiversity loss, economic, \r\nfinancial and employment crises, food security, public \r\nhealth, disarmament and the non-proliferation of \r\nweapons and the fight against terrorism are recognized \r\nas being interdependent. On that basis, we should \r\ncreate a new form of international cooperation and \r\nmultilateralism so as to coordinate our policies at the \r\ninternational, national and regional levels. We have a \r\nduty to guarantee the full effectiveness of the \r\nOrganization’s activities with a view to preserving and \r\nstrengthening its essential value as a point of reference \r\nfor the international community. \r\n The interdependence of such threats is more \r\nevident now than ever before. That is the case, for \r\nexample, of the impact of climate change on world \r\nfood security, which in turn poses a threat to security \r\nand peace, not only in Africa, where perhaps this \r\nrelationship can more easily be observed, but \r\nthroughout the world. Food insecurity fuels violent \r\nsocial conflicts. Climate change leads to a reduction in \r\nglobal food production, the most damaging effects of \r\nwhich are experienced in Africa and Asia. \r\n The populations of countries in a post-conflict \r\nsituation, countries that depend more directly on \r\nagriculture or the poorest developing countries will \r\nhave more difficulties than others in coping with rising \r\nfood prices due to droughts or other disasters caused by \r\nclimate change. Our country is following the \r\nhumanitarian emergency in the Horn of Africa with \r\ngreat concern. The populations of Somalia, Kenya, \r\nEthiopia and Djibouti are the victims of a severe \r\ndrought. This is a humanitarian emergency affecting \r\nover 12 million people, including many women and \r\nchildren. \r\n The Republic of San Marino is grateful to the \r\nSecretary-General for his rapid and significant actions \r\nin benefit of the affected populations. We also thank \r\nthe Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs \r\nand the Central Emergency Response Fund for their \r\nimmediate response and their substantial contribution \r\nto resolving the humanitarian emergency in the Horn of \r\nAfrica, and Member States for their financial \r\ncommitments. \r\n Another but no less important effect of climate \r\nchange is sea-level rise, which has an impact on the \r\nvery existence of many Member States. This problem \r\naffects not only small islands, but also large islands \r\nand countries with extensive coastlines. Therefore, this \r\nphenomenon affects a significant number of United \r\nNations Member States. \r\n The implications, interdependence and effects of \r\nserious global threats on populations and world peace \r\nand security are increasingly evident. With a view to \r\naddressing such challenges, we need a strong United \r\nNations, as well as effective and coordinated action in \r\nour economic, environmental and food policies at all \r\nlevels — both globally and regionally. These policies \r\nshould be designed to achieve sustainable, inclusive \r\nand equitable economic growth.  \r\n As I mentioned earlier, this year’s theme is \r\ninevitably linked to the reform of the United Nations. \r\nThat reform will be fundamental to future world \r\nstability and the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security. It must remain the target of all our efforts.  \r\n The Republic of San Marino has been following \r\nwith interest the Security Council reform process since \r\n1994. In that regard, it is grateful to Ambassador Tanin \r\nfor the wisdom and impartiality with which he has \r\npresided over the intergovernmental negotiations on \r\nSecurity Council reform and for his tireless efforts to \r\nreach the broadest possible political agreement. We are \r\nconvinced that intergovernmental negotiations are the \r\nright framework within which to find a solution that \r\nreflects the interests and positions of all Members. It is \r\nessential to move beyond respective initial positions in \r\norder to negotiate the broadest possible agreement. The \r\nRepublic San Marino believes that the five key issues \r\nof reform — categories of membership, the question of \r\nthe veto, regional representation, the size of an \r\nenlarged Council and its working methods, and its \r\nrelationship with the General Assembly — are closely \r\ninterrelated and need to be considered as a whole.  \r\n Another major reform in the United Nations to \r\nwhich our country attaches great importance is the \r\n A/66/PV.28\r\n \r\n7 11-51670 \r\n \r\nrevitalization process of the General Assembly. The \r\nRepublic of San Marino supports this reform process \r\nand, in that regard, wishes to thank Lithuania and Saint \r\nVincent and the Grenadines for having co-chaired the \r\nAd Hoc Working Group on the Revitalization of the \r\nGeneral Assembly this year. \r\n The revitalization of the General Assembly is a \r\npolitically necessary reform and, at the same time, \r\nessential to the future of the United Nations. It is a \r\nreform that should involve all States in reaching an \r\nagreement based, again, on the broadest possible \r\npolitical consensus and aimed at reaffirming the central \r\nrole of the General Assembly as the most \r\nrepresentative body of the United Nations, as well as \r\nthe role and leadership of its President. Reform should \r\nmake the work of the General Assembly more \r\neffective, prevent duplication of its activities, and \r\nimprove its relations with the other United Nations \r\nbodies. Nevertheless, the revitalization of the General \r\nAssembly should not concern these aspects alone, \r\nhowever important they may be. The Assembly should \r\nbecome a key forum where solutions can be found to \r\nthe problems posed by the global threats that \r\nincreasingly unite the destinies of our peoples. \r\n There are many issues and themes on which the \r\nUnited Nations focuses its attention, and it is \r\nimpossible to address all of them. Therefore, I will \r\nhighlight some aspects that are perhaps lesser known, \r\nbut no less important. \r\n About 15 per cent of the world’s population has \r\nsome kind of disability, while between 2 to 4 per cent \r\nsuffers from severe disabilities. Since the adoption in \r\n2006 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with \r\nDisabilities, we have witnessed a clear affirmation of \r\nthe rights of the disabled. Today, the Convention has \r\nbeen ratified by over 100 countries. The international \r\ncommunity has taken important steps forward in terms \r\nof equality for and non-discrimination towards \r\ndisabled people, as well as their full inclusion and \r\nparticipation in the social, political and cultural life of \r\nsocieties. However, much remains to be done in order \r\nto implement the Convention, including the \r\nestablishment of legislative frameworks and policies at \r\nthe national and international levels. \r\n The international community should also deal \r\nwith the strong relationship between disability and \r\npoverty, and include that issue in future political \r\nstrategies. A similar approach is fundamental in efforts \r\nto achieve the Millennium Development Goals. At \r\npresent, 80 per cent of persons with disabilities live in \r\ndeveloping countries and most live below the poverty \r\nline. In addition, many of the children who do not \r\nattend school have some kind of disability. Therefore, \r\nit is clear that targeted strategies and policies taking \r\ninto due account the situation of children with \r\ndisabilities should be adopted to achieve the Goal of \r\nuniversal primary education.  \r\n More than 8 million children under five years of \r\nage and 350,000 mothers die every year. Today, \r\n67 million children are still out of school, and \r\n195 million children under five years of age suffer \r\nfrom chronic malnutrition, which remains the major \r\ncause of childhood death. Every day, more than \r\n1,000 babies are born with HIV and about 5 million \r\nyoung people between 15 and 24 years of age are \r\nliving with this virus. \r\n Children continue to be the most vulnerable to \r\nand most affected by violence, abuse and exploitation. \r\nCurrently, more than 200 million children, especially \r\nthose in developing countries, do not have a birth \r\ncertificate. Sadly, most can barely access basic \r\nservices, such as health care and education, or enjoy \r\ntheir rights. Also, it is difficult to protect them. This \r\nthreatens to seriously undermine the achievement of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. The Republic of \r\nSan Marino joins the international community in \r\nsupporting resolution 65/1, entitled “Keeping the \r\npromise: united to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals”.  \r\n Gender equality is rightly placed high on the \r\nagenda of the United Nations. In many countries, \r\nmaternal mortality figures are still worrying, especially \r\nin the poorest areas of the world. Furthermore, young \r\npeople, girls and women are the most affected by HIV. \r\nUnfortunately, trafficking in women and children \r\nremains a serious problem. Women and girls continue \r\nto be subjected to humiliating practices, such as the \r\npayment of the bride price, child marriage, kidnapping \r\nand sexual violence, including domestic violence. \r\n Protecting the rights of women in conflict and \r\npost-conflict situations continues to be another high \r\npriority for the United Nations. Women facing such \r\nsituations are very often victims of sexual violence, \r\nmass rape, torture and arbitrary executions.  \r\n Schooling and education are vital to countering \r\ndiscrimination and favour the empowerment of women. \r\nA/66/PV.28  \r\n \r\n11-51670 8 \r\n \r\nImproving the quality of and access to education for \r\nwomen and children requires providing them with \r\ninstruments to improve their economic and social \r\nliving conditions. \r\n I have talked about groups of people who live in \r\nextremely difficult conditions in many areas of the \r\nworld and represent a very large share of the world’s \r\npopulation. The primary task of each individual and \r\nState is to support every effort to help them live in \r\ndecent conditions and feel fully included in society. \r\nTheir progress will be our progress, and their smile \r\nwill be the light allowing us to look to the future with \r\noptimism. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. K. Shanmugam, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Republic of Singapore. \r\n Mr. Shanmugam (Singapore): Allow me to \r\ncongratulate Ambassador Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser \r\non his election as President of the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-sixth session. I would also like to congratulate \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon on his unanimous \r\nreappointment to a second term. \r\n I extend my warmest congratulations to South \r\nSudan on becoming the newest Member of the United \r\nNations family. We wish President Al-Nasser and \r\nSecretary-General Ban success in the year ahead. \r\n The world has seen difficult times since the \r\nglobal economic crisis of 2008. This has been \r\ncompounded by natural and man-made disasters, which \r\nhave grown in scale and severity. The repercussions of \r\nthose events produce unpredictable outcomes. \r\nGovernments have to grapple with the challenge of \r\nreviving growth and creating jobs for our citizens, even \r\nas the uncertain global economic recovery comes under \r\nthreat from the severe fiscal and debt crisis in the \r\nUnited States and eurozone. Fears about the risk of a \r\ndouble-dip recession remain. \r\n Other important global challenges need serious \r\nattention and resources as well. Those include long-\r\nterm issues such as sustainable development, climate \r\nchange and water security. There are also immediate \r\nconcerns such as food security, job creation and \r\nmaking our cities more livable. These are issues that \r\nrequire urgent joint action by the global community. \r\n By next month, we will have 7 billion people to \r\nfeed, clothe and find meaningful employment for. That \r\nis a stark reminder of the magnitude of our task. The \r\nUnited Nations must play an important role in dealing \r\nwith these challenges. First, the United Nations, the \r\nWorld Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the \r\nWorld Trade Organization can help ensure that the \r\nglobal economic framework remains conducive to \r\ngrowth amidst the maelstrom of economic instability. \r\n We are in for a bumpy ride, with growth in all the \r\nmajor markets slowing, and there is no guarantee of \r\nquick recovery. At the same time, we face a worrisome \r\nrise in protectionist sentiments. A recent report by the \r\nWorld Trade Organization showed that the Group of 20 \r\n(G-20) countries introduced 122 new trade-restrictive \r\nmeasures from 2010 to April 2011. Too many countries \r\nare focused more on domestic political concerns than \r\non implementing their multilateral commitments and \r\ntaking concerted action at the global level. That is why \r\nthe prospects for a breakthrough in the Doha \r\nDevelopment Round continue to be slim.  \r\n As the pre-eminent multilateral institution in the \r\nworld, the United Nations should take a strong stand, \r\nmake a united pledge against trade-restrictive measures \r\nand continue to push for free trade. Fighting \r\nprotectionist pressures collectively is important for the \r\nlong-term sustainability of our economies. The \r\nphilosophy of common enrichment that imbues the \r\nUnited Nations Charter must replace short-sighted \r\nstrategies of survival if we are to truly take the path \r\ntowards sustainability. Due to its sheer membership \r\nsize and functions, the United Nations will need time \r\nto achieve consensus and make decisions. That leaves \r\nthe door open for ad hoc coordination by smaller, \r\ninformal groups, especially during critical periods like \r\nthe fall of 2008. There is a role for smaller, regional \r\ngroupings like the G-20 and the Group of Eight, which \r\nmay be more efficient and dynamic in decision-\r\nmaking.  \r\n A certain amount of fluidity is a given in global \r\ngovernance for some time to come, and even necessary \r\nin order to tackle increasingly complex and varied \r\nglobal problems. But ultimately, a balance needs to be \r\nstruck between efficiency and genuine legitimacy. The \r\nG-20 accounts for over 80 per cent of world trade and \r\ngross domestic product, but that still leaves the \r\nmajority of countries and a significant number of \r\npeople outside of that group. There is scope for the \r\nUnited Nations to play a meaningful role by ensuring \r\nthat all groupings take into account and promote the \r\ngreater interest. The United Nations must also act \r\ntogether with such groupings as complementary parts \r\n A/66/PV.28\r\n \r\n9 11-51670 \r\n \r\nof the international system, not as mutually exclusive \r\ncompetitors. \r\n The United Nations also has an important role in \r\ntackling two other challenges — food and water \r\nsecurity, which are two sides of the same coin. The \r\nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United \r\nNations has reported an escalation of international food \r\nprices to levels not seen in decades. And according to \r\nthe World Bank, rising food costs have pushed \r\n44 million people into extreme poverty and hunger \r\nsince June 2010. The hunger crisis in the Horn of \r\nAfrica is but one face of this devastation. \r\n Equally critical is the challenge of water security. \r\nThe United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) \r\nhas pointed out that about one-third of the world’s \r\npopulation lives in countries with moderate to high \r\nwater stress, with a disproportionate impact on the \r\npoor. With current projected global population growth, \r\nthe task of providing water for human sustenance will \r\nbecome increasingly difficult, and increasing \r\ncompetition over this scarce but vital resource may fuel \r\ninstability and conflict within and between States. \r\n The United Nations is doing a great deal in both \r\nareas to proactively foster collaboration among \r\nMember States. UNEP has long actively addressed the \r\nwater issue, together with partner United Nations \r\nagencies and other organizations. Looking ahead, the \r\nUnited Nations can do more to build synergies of \r\ntechnology, policy and capacity in this field. In this \r\nregard, events like the annual World Water Week in \r\nStockholm come to the forefront of the public’s minds \r\nwhen talking about championing water issues. \r\n Likewise, since 2008, Singapore has organized \r\nthe Singapore International Water Week, a global \r\nplatform that brings together policymakers, industry \r\nleaders, experts and practitioners to address challenges, \r\nshowcase technologies, discover opportunities and \r\ncelebrate achievements in the water world. In \r\nSingapore, we have always regarded water as a \r\nstrategic resource. We have invested considerable \r\nresources in researching and testing new technologies. \r\nWe would be happy to share our experiences. \r\n I am certain that there are also many other \r\nsuccess stories of countries that have adopted modern \r\ntechnology and sound policies to overcome their water \r\ninsecurity. That is why Singapore is happy to be a \r\nmember of the Green Group, an informal grouping \r\ninitiated by Slovenia, whose members discuss ways to \r\naugment our collective experiences in water \r\nmanagement. That model can be replicated by the \r\nUnited Nations to include more Member States. \r\n We also need to look at the processes, procedures \r\nand leadership within the United Nations. The \r\nefficiency of our responses can and should be reviewed \r\nand improved upon. At present, there is a disconnect \r\nbetween the proliferation of resolutions, which we \r\ndebate year after year, and actual present realities. \r\nThere is a great need to coordinate better between New \r\nYork and the ground. The immense good work in the \r\nfield that various United Nations personnel, such as our \r\nhumanitarian and aid workers, are doing has to be \r\nbetter related to what Member States do at \r\nHeadquarters. \r\n While established processes are important, that \r\nshould not hamper innovative thinking and solutions. \r\nFor example, we should set definitive timelines and \r\nspecific objectives for resolutions, and retire others. \r\nLet us focus on what needs to be done, who should do \r\nit, and by when it should be done. This will ensure that \r\nthere are targeted outcomes and real implementation. \r\nThis may seem like a small, procedural change, but to \r\nborrow a phrase, sometimes little things can make a \r\nbig difference.  \r\n The alternative is to leave the shaping of the new \r\nglobal governance to other groupings, which will by \r\ndefinition be less inclusive. That will lead to a further \r\nmarginalization of the small and the weak. The United \r\nNations needs to find ways to work with limited \r\ngroupings as complementary parts of the international \r\nsystem. This is what the Global Governance Group, or \r\n3G, has sought to achieve. \r\n To act as a bridge between the United Nations \r\nand the Group of 20, the 3G has provided ideas to \r\nstrengthen the latter’s engagement with the United \r\nNations. The 3G has focused on areas of ongoing and \r\npotential cooperation such as development, tackling the \r\nproblem of food security and fostering the growth of \r\nlivable cities. It has also called for a comprehensive \r\napproach to addressing the different factors affecting \r\nfood security and the volatility of food prices. That \r\nincludes a call for a renewed political commitment to a \r\nuniversal, rules-based, open, non-discriminatory and \r\nequitable multilateral trading system under the World \r\nTrade Organization, which we believe is critical to \r\nachieving food security. \r\nA/66/PV.28  \r\n \r\n11-51670 10 \r\n \r\n The United Nations remains the only truly \r\nuniversal and international organization. There is no \r\nalternative to the United Nations. The steady expansion \r\nof its membership from 51 at its founding in 1945 to \r\n193 today is a testament to the value that countries \r\naccord to membership in this Organization. \r\n The United Nations is uniquely placed to \r\ninfluence our collective future. However, we should \r\nnot take this position for granted, for the \r\nOrganization’s ability to influence global issues is \r\nultimately dependent on the decisions that we as \r\nMember States take at the United Nations. \r\n Sixty-five years ago, following the devastation of \r\nWorld War II, we managed to forge a consensus that \r\nwas underpinned by the notion of inclusive global \r\ncitizenship and manifested by the establishment of a \r\nset of international institutions, practices and norms. At \r\nthe forefront was the United Nations Charter.  \r\n Globalization and economic integration have \r\nsince redefined global governance and decision-\r\nmaking. The United Nations needs to adjust its \r\nprocesses to this new environment. But at the core, its \r\nvalues remain the same: to maintain international peace \r\nand security and to promote development, human \r\nrights and respect for the rule of law. \r\n It is up to us, the Member States, to rally the \r\nnecessary political will to put aside narrow self-\r\ninterests and act for our collective good and secure the \r\nwell-being of our future generations. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency, Mr. Sergei Martynov, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Republic of Belarus. \r\n Mr. Martynov (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): \r\nMuch has been said from this rostrum in recent years \r\nabout global governance. Yet in fact there is a \r\npervasive feeling that chaos is inexorably engulfing our \r\nplanet. Indeed, one global crisis comes hard on the \r\nheels of another. International law is being shamelessly \r\ntrampled. Inequality and poverty are on the rise, and \r\nabove all, an ever increasing number of people in the \r\nworld are exposed to suffering. \r\n This is the logical outcome of the world operating \r\nwithout a system and order. Twenty years ago, the \r\ninternational community had its own constitutional \r\nmoment as a result of the end of an epochal \r\nconfrontation, an opportunity to elaborate a \r\ncomprehensive strategy for stable development of the \r\nworld in the future. We missed that opportunity, first of \r\nall because egoism and gloating rather than common \r\nsense took the upper hand in the mindset of the \r\nso-called winners. \r\n The lack of common vision excluded the \r\npossibility of our taking effective concerted action. As \r\na result, the international community today is only \r\nreacting to ever-rising global challenges, having no \r\nrecourse to instruments that might prevent them. The \r\nsituation is bound to persist unless we arrive together \r\nat a set of long-term, efficient measures. We need a \r\nglobal strategy against chaos. \r\n The failures of the international community over \r\nthe past twenty years suggest that for such a strategy to \r\nbecome a strategy for success, it would have to be built \r\naround the following three foundations: strengthening \r\ninternational law, establishing global partnerships and \r\nrevitalizing the United Nations. \r\n The history of mankind has always been the \r\nhistory of the opposition of power and law. Only in the \r\npast century has that argument been resolved, and only \r\nde jure, in favour of the latter. By the way, it is hardly \r\nan exaggeration to say that a civilization is shaped by \r\nits transition from power to law. \r\n Belarus is firmly convinced that a strategy \r\nagainst chaos cannot succeed if we fail to preserve and \r\nstrengthen the system of international law as a \r\ndeterrent against lawlessness and impunity. Clearly, \r\nthere is more than enough reason to be concerned, \r\nsince power, de facto, dominates law more often than \r\nnot.  \r\n This year we have witnessed far-reaching \r\nchanges in the Middle East. The countries of that \r\nregion have the inalienable right to determine their \r\nown way of development. All of us must respect the \r\nchoice made by those States and refrain from \r\ninterfering in their internal affairs. That is our \r\ninternational obligation as Member States of the United \r\nNations. \r\n Unfortunately, not every country complies with \r\nits international obligations concerning the free choice \r\nof development paths. For decades the United States of \r\nAmerica has maintained an economic, trade and \r\nfinancial blockade against freedom-loving Cuba. That \r\nis a clear violation of United Nations principles and \r\ndecisions. \r\n A/66/PV.28\r\n \r\n11 11-51670 \r\n \r\n Belarus has also found itself the target not only of \r\nmalicious attacks but also of economic sanctions for \r\nthe choice that the Belarussian nation made with the \r\nelection of its own President. Belarussians will never \r\nrenounce their right of choice. Determining our own \r\npath of development is a sacred value to us. Neither \r\nsanctions nor blackmail and threats will alter our \r\nstance. Justice is on our side. \r\n Belarus has never tried to teach anyone how to \r\nlive. We consistently advocate the need to respect the \r\ndiverse development paths of the world’s nations. The \r\nRepublic of Belarus stands ready to develop mutually \r\nbeneficial cooperation with all countries, even those \r\nwith whom we continue to have acute differences. \r\nAfter all, we are simply asking that others treat us as \r\nwe treat them, with respect and equality. That is our \r\nright too. \r\n The great Albert Einstein once said: “Problems \r\ncannot be solved at the same level of awareness that \r\ncreated them.” The growing transnational challenges \r\nand threats cannot be successfully addressed through \r\ntraditional foreign policy tools such as balance of \r\npower, spheres of influence, sanctions and threats. We \r\nneed new forms of cooperation that factor in the two \r\ncontemporary global shifts that foreign policy analysts \r\ncorrectly emphasize: from the West to the rest, and \r\nfrom States to non-State actors. \r\n We believe that global partnerships among States, \r\ninternational organizations, civil society and the \r\nprivate sector represent the best form of cooperation \r\nfor facing those and any other challenges. \r\n Global partnerships constitute an integral part of \r\nthe strategy against chaos. It is just such partnerships \r\nthat can ensure a real pooling of efforts by interested \r\nstakeholders in today’s world in order to oppose the \r\nwhole array of challenges and threats that recognize no \r\nborders. We are certain that at the international level \r\nthere is no alternative to integration and inclusiveness. \r\nGlobalization and interdependence have made all of us \r\nequally vulnerable to transnational problems. Thus, \r\nthere cannot be well-being and stability in the world \r\nfor the few while others live in poverty and suffering.  \r\n The profound changes in Africa and the Middle \r\nEast caused by the growing problems of poverty and \r\ninequality dictate the need to achieve a global \r\npartnership for development. Last year’s High-level \r\nMeeting at the United Nations and the Seoul Meeting \r\nof the Group of 20 made important contributions to the \r\nefforts in this field. At the same time, the relentless rise \r\nof oil, food and energy prices across the globe points \r\nout a new strain on development, hence the need for \r\nmore proactive and unconventional approaches. \r\n Among such specific approaches, we consider it \r\nimportant to address the issue of the transfer of \r\neffective, cutting-edge energy technologies to \r\ndeveloping and middle-income countries. That is also a \r\nkey element for overcoming the problems of climate \r\nchange. What is crucial here is that such technologies \r\nalready exist and are established in many parts of the \r\nglobe. Therefore, the difficulties are not technical.  \r\n Ultimately, let us grasp one point: today it is \r\nimpossible to have a green paradise for the affluent \r\ncountries while the poor ones live in a contaminated \r\nhell. The finite nature of Earth rules out such a \r\nscenario.  \r\n As a practical step, Belarus would like to suggest \r\nsetting up a global mechanism — through a General \r\nAssembly resolution on new and renewable sources of \r\nenergy and under the outcome document of the Rio+20 \r\nConference — under the aegis of the United Nations to \r\nensure access to modern energy technologies for all \r\ncountries of the world. That would be our best \r\ncontribution to the International Year of Sustainable \r\nEnergy for All that we are to celebrate in 2012. \r\n Over the past year, we have made important \r\nstrides in forging the Global Partnership against \r\nSlavery and Trafficking in Human Beings in the \r\nTwenty-first Century, initiated by Belarus. The \r\nimplementation of the Global Plan of Action to Combat \r\nTrafficking in Persons is under way. Interested States, \r\ninternational organizations and civil society, along with \r\nthe private sector, are already actively participating in \r\nthe process. It is gratifying that these efforts have \r\nfocused on protecting the rights of victims.  \r\n Throwing its full weight behind such an \r\napproach, Belarus was among the first States to make a \r\nvoluntary contribution to the United Nations Voluntary \r\nTrust Fund for Victims of Trafficking. We are grateful \r\nto those countries that joined in the work of the Group \r\nof Friends United against Human Trafficking. \r\n Among the prospects for establishing global \r\npartnerships, we see as highly promising the theme of \r\nsupporting youth. At the Assembly’s High-level \r\nMeeting on Youth last year, Belarus came up with the \r\ninitiative to create a partnership to that effect. We \r\nA/66/PV.28  \r\n \r\n11-51670 12 \r\n \r\nwelcome the High-level Meeting on Youth held in July \r\nthis year in the context of the International Year of \r\nYouth. We hope that the event will be followed by the \r\ndevelopment of efficient global policies to protect the \r\ninterests of youth. \r\n There is a natural place where a strategy for \r\ndevelopment for the future must be devised and \r\nimplemented. That place is the United Nations. The \r\nquestion today is, to what extent is the United Nations \r\nfit to take this task upon itself? Let us be frank. We all \r\nhave claims against the United Nations. Indeed, the \r\nmajor task of the Organization over the past years \r\nseems to have been to survive various crises rather than \r\nto solve, let alone prevent, them.  \r\n Is the United Nations to blame for this state of \r\naffairs? Let us be outspoken once more and say “No”. \r\nThe United Nations is us. It is us, the Member States, \r\nwho are at fault, because together we failed both to \r\ngrasp what kind of world we wanted to build and to \r\nadjust the United Nations to the new realities. \r\nTherefore, it is hardly surprising that the United \r\nNations has more frequently served as a stage for \r\nindividual actors rather than as a platform for common \r\naction. \r\n The need to revitalize the Organization stands out \r\nsharply as never before. We need to reform the \r\nprincipal organs of the United Nations and the \r\nfundamental orientation of its activities. \r\n The Security Council should not stay fixed in a \r\nform that was appropriate in era of realpolitik. In the \r\ninterests of developing countries above all, we are \r\nconvinced that the Council must be enlarged in both \r\ncategories. Bringing the Council’s working methods \r\ninto conformity with the spirit of the age must serve to \r\nenhance the authority and efficiency of its work. \r\n The world is plagued by severe economic \r\nproblems, yet the substantial economic capacities of \r\nthe United Nations have not been properly utilized. \r\nThe activities of the Economic and Social Council \r\nshould be aligned with solutions to the urgent problems \r\nof Member States to a much greater extent than they \r\nare now. Belarus is eager to contribute to this work, \r\nincluding as member of the Council, provided that next \r\nmonth Member States do Belarus the honour of \r\nelecting it to that vital United Nations body. \r\n Strengthening the United Nations is impossible \r\nwithout striking a balance among the interests of \r\nvarious groups of countries. Several years ago, Belarus \r\nwas among the Member States that initiated efforts to \r\nhave the General Assembly pay greater attention to the \r\nproblems of middle-income countries. We are glad to \r\nsee that since then there has been a growing \r\nunderstanding of the significance of that group of \r\ncountries in world political and economic processes. At \r\nthe current session Belarus, together with like-minded \r\ncountries, will continue efforts to guide United Nations \r\norgans conducting operational activities towards a \r\nmore robust and efficient response to the specific needs \r\nof that group of countries and its many members. \r\n The authority of the United Nations among the \r\nworld’s ordinary people is high in places where it \r\nreally helps in the transition from chaos and violence \r\nto order and stability through its peacekeeping \r\nactivities. In our view, efforts to strengthen this domain \r\ndemand the widest support. Responding to the request \r\nof the Secretary-General, Belarus started contributing \r\nas it could by taking part in peacekeeping operations. \r\n There is also the need to enhance the mediation \r\nrole of the United Nations in the settlement of disputes \r\nby peaceful means. For that it is important not only to \r\nbuild up the Organization’s internal capacities, but to \r\nensure active United Nations cooperation with regional \r\norganizations, for instance the Collective Security \r\nTreaty Organization (CSTO), which know best the \r\nproblems in their own areas of responsibility. As the \r\ncurrent Chair of the CSTO, Belarus stands ready to \r\nassist in this effort as much as it can. \r\n Martin Luther King once said, “The time is \r\nalways right to do what is right.” Let us heed this \r\nreasonable advice and, as the international community, \r\ndo without delay what we must do. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Abubakr A. Al-Qirbi, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Yemen. \r\n Mr. Al-Qirbi (Yemen) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, allow me to congratulate our brother Mr. Nassir \r\nAbdulaziz Al-Nasser on his assumption of the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly. I am fully \r\nconfident that, given his renowned experience and \r\nwisdom, he will ably execute the functions of his \r\nposition. I wish him every success in his work. I would \r\nlike to express our thanks and appreciation to \r\nMr. Joseph Deiss for his constructive efforts in \r\npresiding over the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth \r\nsession. \r\n A/66/PV.28\r\n \r\n13 11-51670 \r\n \r\n Our thanks also go to Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his \r\ndeserved re-election as Secretary-General of the United \r\nNations. We wish to express our thanks and \r\nappreciation to him, as well as to the entire Secretariat \r\nstaff for their work over the past year, in particular for \r\ntheir follow-up of the situation in my country. \r\n We wish to congratulate the people of the \r\nRepublic of South Sudan on that country’s \r\nestablishment and accession to the United Nations. We \r\nalso wish to congratulate the National Transitional \r\nCouncil of Libya for its presence among us and for its \r\nrepresentation of the brotherly Libyan people. \r\n Since January, my country has been experiencing \r\nan acute political crisis. The political opposition that \r\nhas been one of the main components of our system \r\nsince the unified State of Yemen was established in \r\nMay 1990 decided to relinquish all common \r\ndenominators and rejected the principle of consensus, \r\nrefusing to implement the agreement reached since \r\n2006 following its defeat in the presidential elections. \r\nIt has created crises, raising its demands and rejecting \r\nall compromises and solutions. Realizing that \r\ndemocratic means would not enable it to seize power, \r\nthe opposition resorted to political manoeuvres, \r\nincluding violence, threatening the outbreak of civil \r\nwar and complete devastation in Yemen. That could \r\nundermine all the achievements of the Yemeni people \r\nin the modern era, as well as their struggle to establish \r\na democratic political system and to protect their \r\nnational identity, social fabric, unique human harmony \r\nand the system that we have managed to build. \r\n At the beginning of the 1990s, Yemen’s national \r\nmovement made great progress by establishing a \r\nunified State of Yemen, founded on pluralistic \r\ndemocratic principles and coupled with various civil \r\ninstitutions that promoted and respected human rights. \r\nHowever, those who wished narrow, individual and \r\npartisan interests to prevail did not support that historic \r\nachievement. Therefore, they tried to stir up trouble, \r\nusing the conflicts and mistakes made in Yemen in the \r\nearly days of our unified State, as well as the \r\nchallenges to development — the uncontrolled \r\npopulation growth, the prevailing poverty, the lack of \r\nnational resources, increasing drought and \r\ndesertification, and the scarce water and oil resources, \r\nwhich were the main source of income.  \r\n All those factors have made it impossible for \r\nthousands of university graduates to find employment, \r\nwhich has led to social and political tensions and \r\nfrustration. But all the opposition forces used the tidal \r\nwave of change witnessed by Arab countries to prevent \r\nYemen from achieving democratic change through \r\nelections. However, we respected young people’s \r\ndemand for change and started a dialogue with them in \r\norder to meet their demands for reform. We have \r\ncreated tens of thousands of jobs in order to alleviate \r\nunemployment.  \r\n However, the opposition parties abused and \r\nmisused the protests of our young people in order to \r\nseize power, and some of their elements have carried \r\nout subversive acts to sabotage the youth movement \r\nand its just demands. The opposition parties rejected \r\nthe results of the democratic elections that were \r\nconducted under the international monitoring of the \r\nEuropean Union, the Democratic National Institute and \r\nseveral international organizations, which verified that \r\nthe elections were fair, democratic and transparent. \r\n Our Government showed its readiness to meet the \r\nrequests of our young people and their legitimate \r\ndemands to build a better future for us and for \r\nprosperity — a future that is hindered by my country’s \r\nweak economy, limited national resources and the \r\nprevalence of poverty and unemployment, as well as by \r\nterrorism and the repercussions of the global financial \r\ncrisis. Our Government kept on calling on our \r\ndevelopment partners and friends and international \r\norganizations to provide financial and economic \r\nsupport in order to achieve sustainable development in \r\nYemen, which would ensure security and stability in \r\nour country. \r\n The main reason for, and primary cause of, the \r\ncurrent upheaval in Yemen is the dissatisfaction of the \r\nopposition and its refusal to endorse the election that \r\ntook place in 2006. In that election our people showed \r\nconfidence in the President of the Republic and chose \r\nhim as our President. The opposition’s rejection of that \r\nprocess has led to the crisis that we are witnessing \r\ntoday at the economic, development, security and \r\npolitical levels.  \r\n Despite the intransigence of the opposition, the \r\nPresident of the Republic offered compromise in order \r\nto achieve reconciliation between the opposition and \r\nthe Government. That has led to the postponement of \r\nparliamentary elections for two years. However, the \r\nefforts of our President continue through his initiatives \r\nbefore Parliament and the Consultative Council, \r\nA/66/PV.28  \r\n \r\n11-51670 14 \r\n \r\nwhereby he affirmed that he had no intention of \r\nrunning in the presidential elections and that he \r\naccepted the amendments to the Constitution and the \r\nelectoral law, as well as an entire package of political \r\nreforms. \r\n Our country has incurred heavy losses, estimated \r\nat more than $2 billion, as a result of the chaos caused \r\nby the opposition parties, which have tried to cut off \r\nroads, blow up oil pipelines and cut power lines in \r\nmany of our cities, in particular in the capital, Ta’izz, \r\nAden and Abyan. However, the Government continued \r\nto seek a peaceful solution to the political crisis, \r\ncalling on the opposition to come to the table and begin \r\ndialogue. We in Yemen are confident that the recent \r\ndivision will be overcome by returning to \r\nconstitutional legality and remedying certain \r\nshortcomings. \r\n The Government offered a new opportunity for \r\ndialogue by endorsing the initiative of the Gulf \r\nCooperation Council (GCC) as the foundation for a \r\nsolution to the political crisis, especially given that His \r\nExcellency President Ali Abdullah Saleh decided to \r\nentrust his Vice-President with all constitutional \r\npowers, to initiate dialogue with the signatories of the \r\nGulf initiative and to create a mechanism that would \r\nguarantee a smooth and democratic transfer of power. \r\nThat would allow for reconciliation, reform, change \r\nand reconstruction in Yemen without any violation of \r\nsecurity, the Constitution or democratic principles. \r\n We believe that Yemen, as a country that opted \r\nfor dialogue as a means of overcoming the political \r\ncrisis, will provide a model for change in which all \r\nparties are winners and the status of women is \r\nenhanced. The President, following his return to \r\nSana’a, declared in no uncertain terms that he \r\nsupported the GCC initiative and was committed to it. \r\nHe called on all parties to initiate dialogue and to reach \r\na compromise with a view to its implementation. \r\n My country is continuing to make every effort to \r\nfight Al-Qaida and its terrorist acts in our country \r\ndespite our Government’s limited resources. We have \r\ndealt some serious blows to Al-Qaida in Abyan \r\nprovince in recent weeks. What we need at the \r\ninternational level is an integrated global strategy that \r\nwould help us build our national capacities and thereby \r\nenable us to fight extremism and terrorist ideology. \r\nSuch a strategy would not involve military force only \r\nbut would be of a social, educational and political \r\nnature and would strive to eradicate poverty and \r\nachieve universal justice. \r\n The Republic of Yemen attaches primary \r\nimportance to human rights, which is one of the main \r\npillars of the United Nations. Since the return of unity \r\nto Yemen in 1990, my country has made great strides in \r\nthis area. We have established a Ministry for Human \r\nRights and have become a signatory and party to a \r\nnumber of international human rights instruments and \r\nconventions, on whose implementation we submit \r\nperiodic reports. We have also submitted our national \r\nreports within the context of the universal periodic \r\nreview of the Human Rights Council, with which we \r\ncooperate. \r\n In that connection, we welcome the outcome of \r\nthe review conducted by the Human Rights Council in \r\nGeneva and New York, in which we participated \r\nactively. There is no doubt that during the political \r\ncrisis many human rights violations have been \r\ncommitted by all parties. The Government nonetheless \r\nshowed a readiness to conduct independent national \r\ninvestigations and to bring the perpetrators to justice. \r\nThe Government also opened its doors to the fact-\r\nfinding mission sent by the Human Rights Council. In \r\nresponse to an invitation by our Government, the \r\nmission visited Yemen in July and submitted its report \r\nto the Council on 19 September. However, my country \r\nbelieves that resolving the political crisis is the key to \r\nstopping all violations of human rights. \r\n The Government of Yemen, during its \r\nchairmanship of the Group of 77 and China in 2010, \r\ncontinued to actively and sincerely work to achieve \r\nconsensus and unity within the Group, which led to a \r\nconsensus on many issues of interest to the Group, \r\nincluding, inter alia, climate change, the outcome \r\ndocument of the High-level Plenary Meeting of the \r\nGeneral Assembly on the Millennium Development \r\nGoals, and United Nations reform. In that connection, \r\nwe wish every success to the Republic of Argentina \r\nduring its chairmanship of the Group. We also wish \r\nevery success to the fraternal Republic of Algeria, \r\nwhich will chair the Group in 2012. \r\n The Israeli-Arab conflict represents the main \r\nthreat to international peace and security. An objective \r\nunderstanding of the conflict clearly shows Israel’s \r\nintransigence and its Government’s policy of \r\nestablishing settlements, its rejection of the legitimate \r\nand inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, its \r\n A/66/PV.28\r\n \r\n15 11-51670 \r\n \r\nrefusal to abide by international legality, and its \r\nrejection of the Arab Peace Initiative. We call upon the \r\ninternational community and the peace sponsors, \r\nincluding the United States of America, to continue \r\ntheir efforts to achieve universal recognition of a \r\nsovereign State of Palestine and to allow it to join the \r\nUnited Nations as a fully fledged Member of the \r\nOrganization and other world organizations and organs. \r\n Allow me in closing to reiterate my thanks to the \r\nSecretary-General for his efforts in following the crisis \r\nin Yemen. I wish also to thank all the United Nations \r\nagencies for their humanitarian efforts in my country \r\nduring this political crisis. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Sergey Lavrov, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Russian Federation. \r\n Mr. Lavrov (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): This year the session of the General \r\nAssembly is opening at a time when international \r\nrelations are in a state of turbulence. The Middle East \r\nand North Africa have gone through a period of large-\r\nscale changes, and the situation is volatile in certain \r\nother parts of the world. We have not yet been able to \r\nput the global economy back on the track of \r\nprogressive sustainable development. The increasing \r\nnumber of alarming factors has been accompanied by \r\nan exacerbation of social, inter-ethnic and intercultural \r\nconflicts as well as outbreaks of extremism. \r\n Just as a ship caught in adverse weather \r\nconditions needs a united crew and a compass to find \r\nthe right course, the international community today \r\nneeds in particular to deploy joint efforts to respond to \r\ncommon challenges and set clear guidelines to \r\nstrengthen global governance mechanisms. We are \r\nconvinced that such guidelines should include, first and \r\nforemost, the rule of international law; clear, strict and \r\nresponsible reliance on the fundamental principles of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations; and the will to \r\nimplement a positive unification agenda. \r\n The United Nations remains a pillar of \r\ninternational relations and equitable multilateral \r\ncooperation in the interests of all States. It has a unique \r\nlegitimacy and the necessary authority to respond \r\nadequately to the variety of contemporary risks and \r\nthreats. It is the United Nations that should continue to \r\nprovide political, legal and moral leadership in dealing \r\nwith global challenges, to establish equitable principles \r\nand standards of interaction, to monitor their \r\nimplementation and to render necessary assistance and \r\nsupport for the States that need it. \r\n Ten years ago on September 11, a horrible \r\nterrorist attack was committed in this city. We are \r\nconvinced that it is necessary to strengthen multilateral \r\ncooperation in countering international terrorism on \r\nboth the global and regional levels. However, the \r\nadditional mechanisms to be created in this area should \r\nbe incorporated in our common work within the United \r\nNations, with due account taken of its central \r\ncoordinating role in combating terrorism. \r\n Wide international cooperation is needed to keep \r\nthe situation in the global economic and financial \r\nsystem under control. One can hardly deny the \r\nimportance of the role that the Group of Twenty (G-20) \r\nplays in the post-crisis recovery of the world economy. \r\nToday, it is important to finalize the process of \r\nreforming the global financial and economic \r\narchitecture and to implement everything we have \r\nagreed on, rather than to stop halfway. The efficiency \r\nof these efforts will only grow if the G-20 strengthens \r\nits dialogue with the United Nations and its specialized \r\nagencies.  \r\n A significant contribution to the reform of the \r\nglobal economy and finance is being made by \r\nBRICS — Brazil, Russia, India, China and South \r\nAfrica — a global-scale association of five major, \r\nrapidly growing economies that reflects the realities of \r\nthe evolving multipolar world. BRICS does not aim at \r\nconfrontation with anyone. Its goal is to enhance \r\nproductive multilateral collaboration to address the \r\nurgent problems of the contemporary world. \r\n Sustainable development requires a reliable \r\nsupply of energy resources for the global economy. \r\nRussia has proposed drafting a convention on \r\ninternational energy security that would cover all \r\naspects of global energy cooperation, taking into \r\naccount the balance of interests of all actors in the \r\ninternational market. We call for the start of the \r\npractical preparation of this document. \r\n As in economics, the logic of joint consolidated \r\nactions should prevail in matters of security and the \r\nelimination of surplus weapons worldwide. Russia and \r\nthe United States made another important step towards \r\nnuclear disarmament when they signed the Treaty on \r\nStrategic Offensive Arms and began its \r\nimplementation. Its practical realization will allow us \r\nto make sure that the Treaty is effective and viable and \r\nA/66/PV.28  \r\n \r\n11-51670 16 \r\n \r\nto see how its fundamental principles are implemented. \r\nWe call on all States with nuclear weapons capability \r\nto join the Russian-American efforts. We believe that \r\nfurther progress in nuclear arms reductions is possible \r\nonly on a multilateral basis. \r\n Moreover, progress in this area is inseparable \r\nfrom coordinated efforts to move forward on all \r\naspects of strengthening international security and \r\nstrategic stability. This includes development of \r\nuniversally acceptable approaches to missile defence \r\nissues, an accounting on the impact of strategic \r\nconventional arms, prevention of the weaponization of \r\nspace and elimination of qualitative and quantitative \r\nimbalances in conventional arms. \r\n The deployment of strategic missile defence \r\nelements in various parts of the world alters the overall \r\nconfiguration of international security. It is not enough \r\nto make statements that the increase in global missile \r\ndefence capabilities would not undermine the basics of \r\nstrategic stability. The issue is far too serious. We need \r\nsolid legal guarantees that missile defence potential \r\nwill actually be adequate to the declared objectives and \r\nwill not disrupt global and regional balances. This \r\nholds equally true for both Europe and the Asia-Pacific \r\nregion, where the missile defence factor is beginning to \r\naffect the strategic environment. \r\n It is of primary importance for us to prevent the \r\nundermining of the non-proliferation regime. We call \r\nfor universalization of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \r\nof Nuclear Weapons, strengthening of the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards system and \r\nthe entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-\r\nTest-Ban Treaty. Russia has been one of the main \r\ninitiators of the proposal to convene in 2012 a \r\nconference on establishing a zone free of weapons of \r\nmass destruction and their means of delivery in the \r\nMiddle East and is now working intensively, together \r\nwith its partners, on the preparations for this important \r\nforum. \r\n The early resolution of the nuclear problems of \r\nIran and the Korean Peninsula would contribute to the \r\nstrengthening of the non-proliferation regime. We see \r\nno alternative to their political and diplomatic \r\nsettlement and to taking concrete steps to create the \r\nconditions for the resumption of negotiations. We call \r\non all partners to address these tasks with utmost \r\nresponsibility. \r\n The situation around Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi-1 \r\nnuclear power plant has highlighted the need to \r\nimprove the international legal framework in order to \r\nensure the safety of nuclear power facilities. The \r\nRussian Federation has made proposals to enhance the \r\nmechanisms of the Convention on Nuclear Safety and \r\nthe Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear \r\nAccident and to strengthen the relevant IAEA norms. \r\nWe urge support for these initiatives. \r\n In the age of new telecommunications \r\ntechnologies, international information security has \r\nbecome a challenge that requires coordinated efforts by \r\nthe international community. Reliable protection of the \r\nfield of information from malicious and criminal \r\nattacks is the goal of the initiative that Russia and its \r\npartners are promoting at the United Nations. During \r\nthis session, we will put forward proposals on \r\ndeveloping specific rules of conduct in this area. \r\n In a polycentric world, an effective international \r\narchitecture can be created only if it rests on regional \r\nbuilding blocks. The enhancing of global governance at \r\nthe regional level and the increasing role of regional \r\norganizations are an integral part of modern \r\ninternational relations. Integration associations and \r\norganizations in the Commonwealth of Independent \r\nStates area contribute to these processes. The Eurasian \r\nEconomic Community, with its $10 billion anti-crisis \r\nfund, operates in the financial and economic sphere. A \r\ncustoms union between Russia, Kazakhstan and \r\nBelarus has been created, and single economic space is \r\ntaking shape with a view to establishing a Eurasian \r\nunion. \r\n The Collective Security Treaty Organization \r\n(CSTO) is a key tool for ensuring stability within the \r\narea of its responsibility. The signing of the joint \r\ndeclaration on cooperation between the United Nations \r\nSecretariat and the CSTO secretariat in March 2011 \r\nwas a major step in the collaboration between these \r\ntwo organizations, primarily in the field of \r\npeacekeeping. We are ready to start working on its \r\npractical modalities. Russia consistently calls for \r\ninteraction between regional organizations, under the \r\nauspices of the United Nations, to strengthen global \r\nstability on the basis of the solid legal framework of \r\nthe Charter. \r\n Priority should be given to equal and indivisible \r\nsecurity, predictability, transparency and mutual \r\nrespect, taking into account one other’s interests. This \r\n A/66/PV.28\r\n \r\n17 11-51670 \r\n \r\nis exactly the aim of Russian President Medvedev’s \r\ninitiative to sign a treaty on European security. Its \r\npractical implementation would allow us to finally put \r\na period to the post-cold war era, to establish a \r\nuniversal and clear framework for a reliable solution to \r\nsuch issues as missile defence and arms control, and to \r\ncreate a common space of security and development \r\nwithout dividing lines. \r\n Achieving equal and indivisible security is an \r\nurgent issue for the Asia-Pacific region, with the \r\nRussian Far East and Eastern Siberia as integral parts. \r\nThe joint initiative launched by the leaders of China \r\nand Russia in September 2010 is aimed at creating a \r\ncomprehensive architecture for security and \r\ncooperation in the Asia-Pacific region on a bloc-free \r\nlegal basis. We could move closer to this goal by \r\npromoting a network of multilateral diplomacy, an idea \r\nthat has been supported by the members of the \r\nShanghai Cooperation Organization. \r\n Progress in the settlement of regional conflicts \r\nwould contribute to a more stable international \r\nenvironment. Today, special attention is given to the \r\ndevelopments in the Arab world.  \r\n Russia condemns the use of violence against \r\ncivilians and supports the aspirations of Arab peoples \r\nfor the revival of their States and their democratic \r\ndevelopment and social and economic prosperity. At \r\nthe same time, actions by the outside forces must be \r\nbased on full respect for international law and be \r\ninstrumental to the search for a political settlement \r\nbetween the authorities and the opposition. The \r\nattempts to go beyond the Security Council mandate \r\nare unacceptable, since they undermine its authority \r\nand compound the suffering of innocent civilians. \r\n In this context, it seems quite pertinent that States \r\nand regional organizations commit themselves to \r\nstrictly complying with the existing norms of \r\ninternational law, including humanitarian law, in order \r\nto protect civilians during armed conflict. This step, \r\nwhich further enhances the existing legal basis of \r\ninternational relations, would contribute to the \r\nstrengthening of regional and global security in its \r\nmodern, multidimensional interpretation. \r\n The leading role in elaborating modalities for \r\npost-conflict resolution in Libya must be played by the \r\nUnited Nations and in particular the Security Council. \r\nThat is precisely the goal of Security Council \r\nresolution 2009 (2011) of 16 September 2011, which \r\nestablished the United Nations Support Mission in \r\nLibya. We believe that it is time to take additional \r\nsteps, including the lifting of the no-fly zone. \r\n As for Syria, it is inadmissible to boycott \r\nproposals for a national dialogue, stir up confrontation \r\nand provoke violence, while neglecting the reforms — \r\nlate in coming, but still achievable — proposed by \r\nPresident Al-Assad. It is important to encourage the \r\nauthorities and the opposition to start negotiations and \r\nagree on the future of their country. We hope that the \r\nLeague of Arab States will make the necessary efforts. \r\n The situation in the Middle East could be \r\nsignificantly improved by progress in the negotiation \r\nprocess, on the basis of the main parameters defined \r\nand recorded in Security Council resolutions, the \r\nMadrid terms of reference and the Arab Peace \r\nInitiative, and reiterated in the Quartet ministerial \r\nstatement of 23 September. The only viable basis for a \r\nsettlement is the coexistence of Palestinian and Israeli \r\nStates in peace and security. We support the \r\nPalestinians’ application to the Security Council and \r\nwelcome the readiness reiterated by the President of \r\nthe Palestinian National Authority, Mr. Abbas, to hold \r\ntalks with Israel on the basis of the existing \r\ninternational legal framework. \r\n We encourage the Cypriot communities to \r\ncontinue negotiations under United Nations auspices to \r\nachieve a comprehensive, just and viable settlement on \r\nthe basis of the relevant Security Council resolutions. \r\n We call upon all parties to the Nagorno-Karabakh \r\nsettlement process to take advantage of the additional \r\nopportunities arising from the efforts made in the \r\ncontext of Russia’s mediation. We will promote \r\nconfidence-building and ceasefire enforcement \r\nmeasures within the framework of the Troika of the \r\nco-Chairs of the Organization for Security and \r\nCooperation in Europe Minsk Group, together with \r\nAmerican and French partners. \r\n We hope that the decision taken in Moscow on \r\n22 September on resuming official talks on a \r\nTransdniestrian settlement will encourage the parties to \r\nseek ways to arrive at mutually acceptable agreements. \r\n We are strongly committed to doing our utmost to \r\nprevent a repetition of a scenario involving the use of \r\nforce in the Caucasus, as happened in August 2008 as a \r\nresult of a reckless venture by the ruling regime in \r\nTbilisi. Russia is ready to act as a guarantor of \r\nA/66/PV.28  \r\n \r\n11-51670 18 \r\n \r\narrangements on the non-use of force between \r\nAbkhazia, Georgia, and South Ossetia, taking into \r\naccount the earlier relevant statements made by the \r\nleaders of these three parties. We would welcome it if \r\nthe United States and the European Union made similar \r\ncommitments. As guarantors, we would be ready to \r\ntake steps to prevent the resumption of violence in the \r\nregion and, in the case of the wrongful use of force by \r\neither side, to work towards an early resolution of the \r\nsituation on the basis of the existing norms of \r\ninternational law. \r\n Russia is providing significant support for the \r\nefforts to stabilize the situation in Afghanistan. At the \r\nsame time, we call on the International Security \r\nAssistance Force to more effectively fight the growing \r\nAfghan drug threat. Central Asia and Russia are \r\nalready facing a “heroin aggression”, while the profits \r\nfrom drug trafficking are being used as the main source \r\nof financing the clandestine extremist underground in \r\nthe region. The fight against this evil should be \r\nuncompromising, and it should target the entire drug \r\nbusiness chain. \r\n The problems on the African continent should be \r\na focus of continuous attention on the part of the \r\nUnited Nations. Such attention should include \r\ndevelopment assistance as well as efforts to overcome \r\nthe current humanitarian crisis in the Horn of Africa \r\nand resolve the numerous ongoing conflicts, while \r\nmaintaining the leading role of the African Union. \r\n The eradication of piracy remains a priority. It is \r\nnecessary to accelerate the establishment of an \r\ninternational anti-piracy court mechanism in the \r\nregion, in accordance with the Security Council \r\nresolution adopted on the initiative of Russia. \r\n Experience has shown that pressure and unilateral \r\nsanctions cannot be a cure-all in addressing various \r\nconflict situations; they only complicate efforts to \r\nresolve them. We urge that an end be put to any actions \r\nthat circumvent the Security Council. We also call for \r\nthe lifting of the blockade of Cuba. Cooperation rather \r\nthan isolation should be the method for settling \r\nconflicts in the twenty-first century. \r\n The ongoing transformation in contemporary \r\ninternational relations makes it a priority task on the \r\nglobal agenda to expand intercultural, interreligious \r\nand inter-civilization dialogue in order to devise \r\napproaches to the problems of the modern world that \r\nare based on shared values. The degradation of \r\nfundamental moral values leads to the degradation of \r\nsociety. The recent tragic events in Norway, riots in \r\nGreat Britain, protests by young people in other \r\ncountries, and calls to suppress Christian minorities in \r\nthe Middle East and North Africa — all of those events \r\nare the result of a deterioration in moral and ethical \r\nvalues. There can be no freedom without responsibility \r\nand no democracy without self-restraint. There is a \r\nclear and urgent need to counter the threats posed by \r\nnationalism, ethnic and religious intolerance. We \r\ntherefore reiterate the importance of the recent High-\r\nlevel Meeting of the General Assembly to \r\ncommemorate the tenth anniversary of the adoption of \r\nthe Durban Declaration and Programme of Action \r\nagainst racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and \r\nrelated intolerance. \r\n Attempts to falsify or revise history are \r\ninadmissible, all the more so given that we are marking \r\nthe sixty-fifth anniversary of the Nuremberg Tribunal \r\nverdict. Political correctness and talk of freedom of \r\nspeech cannot serve as a cover when, in certain \r\nEuropean countries, people who brought disgrace upon \r\nthemselves by cooperating with the Nazis are being \r\ntalked and written about in an increasingly elevated \r\ntone. Russia will never forget the countless military \r\ncrimes committed by Hitler and his associates in our \r\nland and throughout Europe during the years of the \r\nNazi aggression. \r\n The rapid changes taking place in the world make \r\nit imperative to strengthen the role of the United \r\nNations and to adapt it to contemporary realities while \r\npreserving — naturally — its inter-State character and \r\nthe immutability of its Charter principles. A \r\nfundamental element of the Organization’s renewal is \r\nthe reform of the Security Council. We support a \r\nsolution that is based upon the broadest possible \r\nagreement. \r\n The world community faces many challenges, \r\nand the United Nations, as a major mechanism for \r\nglobal regulation, is today in demand as never before. \r\nTogether we will find practical ways to effectively \r\novercome the threats of the twenty-first century. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Wilfred Elrington, Attorney General \r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade of \r\nBelize. \r\n Mr. Elrington (Belize): It is an honour for me to \r\ndeliver this address on behalf of the people and the \r\n A/66/PV.28\r\n \r\n19 11-51670 \r\n \r\nGovernment of Belize. It is a particular privilege to do \r\nso with Mr. Al-Nasser at the helm of the Assembly. I \r\nsay so because Belize has the distinct pleasure of \r\nhaving him as the Ambassador of Qatar to Belize, a \r\nrole in which he has distinguished himself and his \r\nnation, much as he is doing in his role as President of \r\nthe Assembly. \r\n Today’s world is characterized by disputes \r\nbetween neighbouring States which have resulted and \r\ncontinue to result in untold damage, loss of life and \r\nfinancial ruin to the feuding States. Thus Mr. Al-Nasser’s \r\nselection of the theme “The role of mediation in the \r\nsettlement of disputes” for this year’s general debate is \r\na timely and appropriate one. We in Belize fully \r\nsubscribe to the view that mediation is a much more \r\nsensible means of putting an end to disputes than the \r\nuse of force or threats of force, especially in the case of \r\nneighbouring States whose people have to live side by \r\nside and who are often dependent upon one another for \r\nsurvival and security. \r\n But today’s world is also characterized by \r\nwidespread anxiety, insecurity, unrest, violence and \r\ninstability. This is manifested in our financial markets \r\nas well as in the streets of cities in the developed and \r\nthe developing world. Threats, both natural and man-\r\nmade, appear to be proliferating. Debt crises are now \r\nso globalized that they are dwarfing national fiscal and \r\npolicy space. Drugs, arms and human trafficking \r\ndominate the global stage, while Mother Nature is \r\nundergoing extreme changes, leaving death, destruction \r\nand disaster in her wake. \r\n Thus far, unfortunately, international responses to \r\nthese catastrophic occurrences have been both \r\nuninspiring and inadequate. \r\n Notwithstanding the armoury of human rights \r\nthat are enshrined in our own Human Rights Charter, \r\nfar too many people are still destitute, are still dying \r\nfrom hunger, are still casualties of preventable or \r\ncurable diseases, are still illiterate, are still jobless and \r\nare still marginalized and excluded from their very own \r\nsocieties. \r\n Three years after the 2008 economic and \r\nfinancial crisis, the global economy is once again \r\nbracing for another setback, as the recovery in major \r\nindustrialized economies stutters and risks a very real \r\ndanger of reversal. Terrorism remains no less of a \r\nglobal threat. Mortality from non-communicable \r\ndiseases now rivals mortality from communicable \r\ndiseases. And greenhouse gas emissions continue to \r\nfuel global warming at a perilous rate. \r\n Faced with the plethora of ills that now beset our \r\nworld, we in Belize entertain no doubt that if any \r\ninstitution holds the key to solving the world problems \r\nit is this Organization, the United Nations, and its \r\nvarious agencies and institutions. Belize is therefore \r\nlooking to the United Nations to lead the charge and to \r\npartner with us in combating three of the most serious \r\nthreats that presently confront us, namely, the threat \r\nposed by climate change, the threat posed by crime and \r\nviolence and the threat posed by chronic \r\nnon-communicable diseases. \r\n For small island and coastal States like Belize, \r\nglobal warming poses an existential threat. We have \r\nalready been overwhelmed by the nature, scale and \r\nfrequency of the damage that extreme weather \r\nconditions, triggered by global warming, have wrought \r\non our infrastructure and marine and terrestrial \r\norganisms. While we appreciate that each of us is \r\nprimarily responsible for our own welfare and we are \r\ntaking such measures as are within our competence to \r\ncope with our changing circumstances, climate change \r\nis a global problem that requires a global response \r\nbased on the principle of common but differentiated \r\nresponsibility. \r\n The President took the Chair. \r\n To that end, some small island and coastal States, \r\nincluding Belize, are moving resolutely towards low-\r\ncarbon and no-carbon emission economies. Today, \r\n24 of our small island developing States (SIDS) have \r\nbecome partners in an innovative, sustainable energy \r\ninitiative called SIDS DOCK, aimed at transforming \r\nour energy sector and catalyzing our sustainable \r\neconomic development. However, in order to succeed \r\nin our initiative we will require delivery or transfer of \r\nthe often promised environmentally friendly \r\ntechnology and the new and additional funding \r\npromised by the international community. \r\n In that regard, we consider the upcoming Durban \r\nConference on climate change of high importance. We \r\nbelieve that every effort should be made at the \r\nConference to forge a climate change regime that will \r\nincentivize significant emission reductions and the \r\nprotection and preservation of existing forests, while \r\nsimultaneously creating disincentives to polluting \r\nactions. Additionally, clear, legally binding rules must \r\nA/66/PV.28  \r\n \r\n11-51670 20 \r\n \r\nbe hammered out with a view to guaranteeing the \r\nenvironmental integrity of our countries. \r\n Over the last decade, crime and violence in \r\nBelize and the rest of Central America have escalated \r\ndrastically, resulting in some 18,167 homicides. \r\nHowever, none of the arms used in those murders was \r\nproduced in Central America. Those arms are the \r\nproduct of the illicit trafficking in guns and drugs \r\nbetween South and North America. The transnational \r\nnature of those crimes is exacerbated by cross-border \r\ncollaboration among criminals. Confronting that type \r\nof criminal activity successfully will clearly require the \r\ncollaboration and cooperation of the international \r\ncommunity. \r\n We in Belize have stepped up our national efforts, \r\nin conjunction with our neighbours in Central America, \r\nthe Caribbean and the United States, to combat those \r\ncriminal activities. But the going is difficult and \r\nprogress is slow. We need more help from the \r\ninternational community. Ideally, we would need a \r\nuniversally applicable normative framework to regulate \r\nthe trade in arms, such as an arms trade treaty that is \r\nlegally binding, robust and comprehensive; one that \r\nestablishes the highest possible standards for the \r\ntransfer of conventional arms, especially small arms, \r\nlight weapons and ammunition. \r\n I now turn to some of the silent killers that are \r\nravaging our Latin American and Caribbean \r\ncommunities — the chronic non-communicable \r\ndiseases (NCDs), such as hyper-tension, diabetes and \r\nobesity. In the Caribbean today, NCDs are responsible \r\nfor 62 per cent of deaths, 40 per cent of which occur \r\nprematurely. If the current trend continues, \r\nnon-communicable diseases will account for three out \r\nof four deaths in the Caribbean by the year 2030.  \r\n Again, those diseases can be combated \r\neffectively only through collaborative efforts of the \r\ninternational community. In that connection, we \r\nwelcome the conclusion of the recently held High-level \r\nMeeting on non-communicable diseases (A/66/PV.3 \r\nand A/66/PV.4), as well as the first comprehensive \r\nglobal political declaration addressing chronic \r\nnon-communicable diseases (resolution 66/2). It should \r\nserve as a template for action at all levels. We will \r\neagerly await the development of indicators and global \r\ntargets aimed at achieving a 25 per cent reduction in \r\nnon-communicable disease-related deaths by 2025. \r\nThat will, no doubt, necessitate close collaboration and \r\ncooperation among Governments, international \r\norganizations, civil society and the private sector to \r\nfacilitate access to medicines and healthy foods. Belize \r\nis committed to supporting that initiative \r\nunconditionally. \r\n Belize is of the view that, given the quantum and \r\nscale of the problems which confront the world today \r\nand the unquestioned need for an ever-increasing \r\namount of resources, the international community \r\ncannot afford not to avail itself of every source of \r\nassistance at hand. And in that regard, we wish to urge \r\nthat the Republic of China, Taiwan, be allowed to \r\nparticipate meaningfully in the work of the United \r\nNations. In a similar vein, we would urge that the \r\nembargo against Cuba, which the Assembly has \r\ndenounced for many years, be brought to a speedy end. \r\n Finally, while Belize appreciates the limitations \r\nof this United Nations, we also appreciate that there \r\nexists no better institution than this one, which is \r\ndedicated to world peace, security, justice and \r\ndevelopment. And even as we seek its reform, we \r\nrecognize its primacy in international affairs and global \r\ngovernance. I am, therefore, pleased to assure you that \r\nBelize is fully committed to work within this \r\nOrganization, through it and with it as it carries out its \r\nmandates. \r\n The President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Djibrill Ypènè Bassolé, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs and Regional Cooperation of Burkina Faso. \r\n Mr. Bassolé (Burkina Faso) (spoke in French): \r\nThe annual general debate of the General Assembly \r\nalways serves as an opportunity for the international \r\ncommunity to consider the state of the world through a \r\nseries of exchanges and thus combine innovative ideas \r\nto support our desire to create a community that will \r\nensure a better future for all. Burkina Faso always \r\nparticipates in this meeting of the world partnership \r\nwith great interest. \r\n Before I go any further, please allow me, \r\nMr. President, to offer you sincere and warm \r\ncongratulations from the Government and people of \r\nBurkina Faso on your election to the presidency of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-sixth session, for which \r\nyou have chosen the theme of strengthening mediation \r\nas a means of preventing and settling conflicts. Burkina \r\nFaso fully supports this choice and is committed to \r\nsharing with the international community its \r\nexperience in peace negotiations, particularly with \r\n A/66/PV.28\r\n \r\n21 11-51670 \r\n \r\nregard to the role of mediator for the Economic \r\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) that \r\nPresident Blaise Compaoré played in settling the crises \r\nin Côte d’Ivoire and Guinea. \r\n I would also like to commend your predecessor, \r\nMr. Joseph Deiss, on the efficiency with which he \r\nguided the work of the sixty-fifth session. And I \r\ncongratulate Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on his \r\nsuccessful reappointment to the leadership of the \r\nUnited Nations. I wish him health and every success \r\nfor his second term. \r\n I salute the Republic of South Sudan’s \r\nachievement of independence and international \r\nsovereignty, and welcome it to the great family that is \r\nthe United Nations. The Government of Burkina Faso \r\noffers its sincere and willing cooperation to the South \r\nSudanese people and authorities. \r\n Much has happened since our last session to \r\naffect the development of the world and our States. \r\nSome countries have been victims of natural \r\ncatastrophe; others have experienced financial, \r\npolitical and social crises. At the beginning of the year \r\nmy country, Burkina Faso, also had to deal with social \r\ndemands arising from the difficult national and \r\neconomic situation. Fortunately, those demands, which \r\nwere followed by social unrest, were resolved, thanks \r\nto a sustained and inclusive dialogue initiated by \r\nPresident Compaoré. This dialogue, involving all of the \r\ncountry’s social classes, enabled the Government to \r\nconduct an exchange of views with every element of \r\nour society on their concerns, with the aim of arriving \r\nat suitable solutions. \r\n Furthermore, the Government of Burkina Faso, \r\nwithin the framework of strengthening the rule of law \r\nand improving and reinforcing our system of political \r\nand institutional governance, established an advisory \r\ncouncil for political reform aimed at continuing with \r\nthe political and institutional reforms that began \r\nseveral years ago. In the economic and social areas, as \r\npart of our accelerated growth and sustainable \r\ndevelopment strategy, my Government, despite its \r\nmodest budget and many other constraints and \r\npriorities, continued its efforts to build a functioning \r\neconomy, with a particular emphasis on strengthening \r\ncertain key sectors, including education, health, water, \r\ntraining and youth employment; on improving \r\nsocio-economic infrastructure, especially roads; and on \r\nencouraging the business environment. \r\n Needless to say, this progress was made possible \r\nthanks to the cooperation and support of our bilateral \r\nand multilateral partners. I take this opportunity to \r\nacknowledge and thank them for their continuing \r\ncommitment to supporting us and for their backing for \r\nour efforts to meet the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. \r\n At the subregional and continental levels, \r\nBurkina Faso, working within the framework of the \r\nWest African Economic and Monetary Union, \r\nECOWAS and the African Union, will continue to be \r\nconstructively involved in strengthening the integration \r\nprocess. While we proclaim our faith and deep \r\nattachment to the regional integration process taking \r\nplace in Africa, we are convinced that regional \r\nintegration must be pragmatic and based on concrete \r\nachievements, which represent the only way we can \r\nrealize our peoples’ legitimate aspirations. At the \r\nregional level, we recognize the value of all the \r\ninitiatives that the African Union has taken to manage \r\nand settle conflicts on our continent. Burkina Faso \r\nreaffirms its continuing readiness to contribute to \r\nmaintaining peace, security and stability all over \r\nAfrica. \r\n The world is currently experiencing times of \r\nenormous uncertainty and anxiety as a result of \r\ninternational economic and financial instability, \r\nincreased poverty, continuing deterioration of the \r\nenvironment and a growing number of natural \r\ndisasters. In particular, the recent international \r\nfinancial crises are dangerously compromising the \r\nbalance of our economies and putting our social \r\ncohesion to a terrible test. They demand a response, \r\nconstant vigilance and firm solidarity on all our parts. \r\n The harmful effects of climate change have \r\nspared no country; natural disasters, in particular, have \r\ncompromised and shaken the foundations of \r\ndevelopment for many of us, especially the least-\r\ndeveloped countries, which are especially vulnerable \r\nand suffer the most. In tackling this scourge, special \r\nattention and renewed effort on the part of the \r\ninternational community are more necessary than ever \r\nin regard to climate issues, as well as every other \r\nenvironmental concern. Among other initiatives, \r\nBurkina Faso commends that of Mrs. Hilary Clinton, \r\nSecretary of State of the United States, for the Global \r\nAlliance for Clean Cookstoves, from which countries \r\nsuch as Burkina Faso could benefit greatly. \r\nA/66/PV.28  \r\n \r\n11-51670 22 \r\n \r\n The High-level Meeting held during this session \r\non the theme “Addressing desertification, land \r\ndegradation and drought in the context of sustainable \r\ndevelopment and poverty eradication”, as well as the \r\nsigning by various countries, including Burkina Faso, \r\nof the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic \r\nResources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of \r\nBenefits Arising from Their Utilization to the \r\nConvention on Biological Diversity, are also events \r\nworthy of commendation. \r\n Burkina Faso considers particularly important all \r\nissues connected to the advancement of women and, to \r\nthat end, has spared no effort to improve the social and \r\nlegal status of women in our country. We therefore \r\ncommend the Organization’s establishment of \r\nUN-Women, and hope that this new body, which \r\nshould be adequately funded, will be a genuine catalyst \r\nfor United Nations activities in defence of women’s \r\nrights. More specifically, we hope it will provide \r\nstrengthened support for pro-women policies in \r\ndeveloping countries. We are pleased that during this \r\nsession the African Group will be introducing a draft \r\nresolution intended to ban female genital mutilation \r\nworldwide. We hope that it will be supported by the \r\nentire international community. \r\n For more than a decade we have been working on \r\nthe process of reforming the United Nations in order to \r\nenable it to be in step with the demands of a world in \r\nconstant change. Unfortunately, despite significant \r\nprogress, much still remains to be done. Burkina Faso \r\nbelieves that the reforms must take into account the \r\ninterests of all Member States and increase our \r\nOrganization’s effectiveness in managing the peace and \r\nsecurity, stability and development of all parties. \r\n At the dawn of the third millennium, our hope \r\nand wish was that this millennium would see us \r\nreconcile with one another and bring peace, security \r\nand stability. Sadly, our planet is still beset by \r\nnumerous conflicts, many of which bear the mark of \r\ninternational terrorism, which, needless to say, Burkina \r\nFaso firmly condemns in all its forms and \r\nmanifestations. That is why Burkina Faso, which \r\nfervently advocates for the prevention and settlement \r\nof conflicts through dialogue, commends the adoption \r\nby the General Assembly of resolution 65/283 on \r\nstrengthening the role of mediation in peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes and conflict prevention and \r\nresolution. We are pleased that that resolution was \r\nintroduced by the Group of Friends of Mediation, of \r\nwhich Burkina Faso is a member. \r\n As we did in Guinea, Côte d’Ivoire, Togo and \r\nDarfur, Burkina Faso is fully prepared to contribute \r\nwherever it is called upon for mediation, peacekeeping \r\nand peacebuilding. The organization of free and \r\ntransparent elections in Guinea and Côte d’Ivoire came \r\nas a result of the successful facilitation efforts of \r\nMr. Blaise Compaoré, President of Burkina Faso. \r\n The Ouagadougou Political Agreement allowed \r\nCôte d’Ivoire to emerge from crisis. What it needs now \r\nis peacebuilding and reconciliation. We take this \r\nopportunity to thank the Secretary-General, who \r\neffectively supported the efforts of ECOWAS and the \r\ninter-Ivorian dialogue facilitator. Beyond facilitation, \r\nwe are prepared to assist all countries in our subregion \r\nin their quest for peace and stability in post-conflict \r\nsituations. We call on the international community to \r\nsupport peacebuilding efforts, especially in Côte \r\nd’Ivoire and Guinea.  \r\n Burkina Faso participates in the African Union-\r\nUnited Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur, with a \r\nforce of 800 men. The signing on 14 July 2011 of the \r\nDoha Document for Peace in Darfur between the \r\nGovernment of the Sudan and the Liberation and \r\nJustice Movement represents significant progress \r\ntowards restoring lasting peace. \r\n Thanks to the trust placed in us by the African \r\nUnion and the United Nations we were able to support \r\nthe peace process, and we call on all parties to the \r\nconflict to sign the Doha Document. We express our \r\nrecognition and profound gratitude to the Emir of \r\nQatar, His Highness Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa \r\nAl-Thani, for his support, which was critical to the \r\nsuccess of the process. \r\n In the framework of the Implementation Follow-\r\nup Committee, my country will continue to contribute \r\nto peacebuilding. We call on the Justice and Equality \r\nMovement, the Sudan Liberation Movement and the \r\nGovernment of the Sudan to bring hostilities to a \r\ncomplete halt in Darfur as soon as possible. \r\n In North Africa a will for change has found \r\nexpression in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya. Burkina Faso \r\nexpresses its solidarity with those countries in their \r\nquest for freedom and democracy. We reiterate our will \r\nto strengthen fruitful links of cooperation. Burkina \r\nFaso reaffirms its recognition of the Transitional \r\n A/66/PV.28\r\n \r\n23 11-51670 \r\n \r\nNational Council in Libya, and we encourage it to \r\ncontinue to promote democracy, national cohesion, \r\nstability and security for all people living in Libya.  \r\n In the Middle East we closely follow the progress \r\nof the Palestinian question, and we support Palestine’s \r\nrequest to be admitted to the United Nations as a full \r\nMember State. We reiterate our call for a lasting, \r\ncomprehensive peace in the region that guarantees the \r\nfreedom and right to self-determination of the \r\nPalestinian people and the security of the State of \r\nIsrael. \r\n Burkina Faso believes in multilateralism, in \r\nsolidarity among peoples and in the virtue of dialogue \r\namong nations. My delegation notes with great \r\nsatisfaction the peaceful climate that currently prevails \r\nin the relationship between the Republic of China on \r\nTaiwan and the People’s Republic of China. That will \r\nfavour the granting to the Republic of China on Taiwan \r\nthe place that it deserves in the concert of nations, \r\nincluding its genuine participation in the activities of \r\ninternational organizations such as the International \r\nCivil Aviation Organization and conferences such as \r\nthose on the United Nations Climate Change \r\nConvention.  \r\n In conclusion, I wish to express the desire that the \r\nvirtues of international solidarity and dialogue among \r\nnations will continue to inspire the United Nations, \r\nwhich is the pre-eminent forum for multilateralism, so \r\nthat together we can respond to the challenges that our \r\nworld faces. \r\n The President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Wunna Maung Lwin, Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof the Republic of the Union of Myanmar. \r\n Mr. Lwin (Myanmar): Allow me to extend our \r\ncongratulations to Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on \r\nhis assumption of the Presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-sixth session. I am confident that \r\nwith his wide knowledge, experience and diplomatic \r\nskills, we will be able to achieve fruitful results in our \r\ndeliberations in addressing important and critical issues \r\non the international agenda. \r\n I would also like to convey our appreciation to \r\nMr. Joseph Deiss for his able leadership and \r\ncontributions to the sixty-fifth session of the General \r\nAssembly. May I also take this opportunity to once \r\nagain extend our congratulations to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his reappointment, and \r\nwe wish to express our sincere appreciation to him for \r\nhis dedication and untiring efforts for the cause of the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n Since I am addressing the General Assembly for \r\nthe first time after the emergence of the constitutional \r\nGovernment and as the Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nthe Republic of the Union of Myanmar, I would like to \r\napprise the Assembly of recent developments and \r\nsignificant changes taking place in my country. The \r\nRepublic of the Union of Myanmar has emerged as a \r\nnew democratic nation in accordance with the \r\nConstitution approved by the overwhelming majority \r\nof the people.  \r\n Multiparty democratic general elections were \r\nheld in Myanmar in November 2010 in line with the \r\nseven-step roadmap. Thirty-seven political parties, \r\nincluding 19 parties from different national ethnic \r\ngroups, contested in the elections. Today, elected \r\nrepresentatives are exercising their democratic rights in \r\nthe legislative bodies. \r\n The President, in his inaugural speech to the first \r\nregular session of the Pyidaungsu Hluttaw on 30 March \r\n2011, stated that all elected Hluttaw members, \r\nincluding the President, are duty-bound to honour and \r\nsafeguard the Constitution of the Republic of the \r\nUnion of Myanmar. The new Government pledged that \r\nall citizens shall enjoy equal rights under the law and is \r\ndetermined to strengthen the judiciary. The \r\nGovernment also assured the nation that it will amend \r\nand revoke existing laws and adopt new laws as may \r\nbe deemed necessary to implement the provisions of \r\nthe fundamental rights of the citizens. \r\n With a view to maintaining and promoting \r\nfriendly relations with all countries in the world, \r\nMyanmar is reaching out to the international \r\ncommunity. In the past five months, Myanmar has \r\nreceived the visits of State leaders and high-level \r\ndelegations from our neighbouring countries, as well as \r\nfrom other regions and international organizations. In \r\nreturn, President Thein Sein paid official visits to the \r\nRepublic of Indonesia and the People’s Republic of \r\nChina. The President also attended the eighteenth \r\nsummit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \r\n(ASEAN) in Jakarta. \r\n The new Government has launched a series of \r\neconomic, social and policy reforms designed to \r\nimprove the socio-economic life of the people of \r\nMyanmar. One of those measures is the stepping up of \r\nA/66/PV.28  \r\n \r\n11-51670 24 \r\n \r\nits efforts to reduce poverty. In Myanmar, about 70 per \r\ncent of the population resides in rural areas and \r\nengages in agricultural and livestock farming. In order \r\nto boost production and enhance the economic \r\ndevelopment of rural areas, the Government has \r\nadopted forward-looking economic policies. Those \r\npolicies will lead to sustained, inclusive and equitable \r\neconomic growth, which will in turn increase \r\nemployment opportunities, promote agriculture \r\ndevelopment and reduce poverty.  \r\n Towards that end, the new Government has \r\nadopted the National Rural Development and Poverty \r\nReduction Plan to alleviate poverty and to improve the \r\nlivelihood of people residing in rural areas. A central \r\ncommittee and various work committees have been \r\nformed to supplement the eight tasks laid down under \r\nthe National Plan. Furthermore, the new Government \r\nhas increased pension allowances for retired service \r\npersonnel commensurate with the changing economic \r\nand social conditions of the country. With a view to \r\nencouraging foreign trade, the Government reduced the \r\nexport tax from 8 per cent to 2 per cent and granted \r\nexport tax exemptions for all agricultural and timber \r\nproducts. \r\n It is regrettable that the Government’s efforts to \r\nimprove the livelihood of the people of Myanmar are \r\nbeing hampered by economic sanctions. I would \r\ntherefore like to call upon countries that have imposed \r\nunilateral sanctions on my country to lift those \r\nrestrictions. It will also contribute to our efforts to \r\nachieve our Millennium Development Goal (MDG) \r\ntargets. \r\n Myanmar attaches great importance to the \r\npromotion and protection of human rights. The \r\nfundamental rights of the country’s citizens are \r\nguaranteed by relevant provisions of the State \r\nConstitution. With a view to promoting and \r\nsafeguarding the fundamental rights of its citizens as \r\nset forth in the Constitution, the Myanmar National \r\nHuman Rights Commission was formed on \r\n5 September 2011. \r\n Myanmar’s cooperation with the United Nations \r\nhas been clearly demonstrated by the Government’s \r\nacceptance of the fourth visit of Mr. Tomás Ojea \r\nQuintana, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of \r\nhuman rights in Myanmar in August 2011. \r\nMr. Quintana recognized and welcomed the steps taken \r\nby the Government to improve the human rights \r\nsituation in the country. He also welcomed the \r\nGovernment’s stated commitments to reform and the \r\npriorities set forth by the President. \r\n Myanmar has been cooperating closely with the \r\nUnited Nations Human Rights Council. Myanmar’s \r\nUniversal Periodic Review (UPR) report was submitted \r\nand reviewed by the UPR Working Group last January \r\nand adopted at the seventeenth session of the Human \r\nRights Council last June. Myanmar has agreed to \r\naccept 52.4 per cent of the total recommendations. We \r\nstrongly believe that the UPR process is the most \r\ndependable and non-controversial monitoring \r\nmechanism for addressing and rectifying the human \r\nrights situations of all countries. \r\n As for national reconciliation, the Government \r\noffered an olive branch to all the ethnic armed groups \r\nin the country through Announcement No. 1/2011 on \r\n18 August, and some of those groups have accepted the \r\nGovernment’s offer. The Government also granted an \r\namnesty on 16 May 2011, with 20,000 inmates having \r\nbeen released by the end of July. I would like to take \r\nthis opportunity to inform the General Assembly that \r\nthe President, in exercising the mandate vested in him \r\nby the Constitution, will grant a further amnesty at an \r\nappropriate time in the near future. \r\n The President invited people to work together for \r\nthe interest of the nation despite differences. \r\nAccordingly, he received Daw Aung San Suu Kyi on \r\n19 August 2011, and, putting aside differing views, \r\nthey had candid and cordial discussions with a view to \r\nfinding common ground and exploring a potential \r\ncooperation in the interest of the nation and its people. \r\n The foregoing are some of the significant items \r\nof progress we have achieved in our democratization \r\nprocess. \r\n As an agro-based country, Myanmar is following \r\nwith keen interest the issues involving the effects of \r\nclimate change. Since agriculture is highly dependent \r\non the climate, the implications of the climatic \r\nsituation on agriculture cannot be ignored. Lately, \r\nfloods and droughts have devastated crops and \r\nagricultural production in our region. It is evident that \r\ndeveloping countries are the most vulnerable and will \r\ntherefore be the first to suffer from global warming and \r\nclimate change. \r\n We therefore look forward to reaching tangible \r\noutcomes at the upcoming seventeenth Conference of \r\n A/66/PV.28\r\n \r\n25 11-51670 \r\n \r\nthe Parties to the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change and the seventh \r\nSession of the Conference of the Parties serving as the \r\nmeeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol in Durban, \r\nSouth Africa. Although the road to Durban will be a \r\ndifficult one, my delegation shares the view that our \r\ndiscussions on the issue should be placed within the \r\ncontext of promoting sustainable development. In that \r\nregard, we would also like to stress that all three \r\npillars, namely, economic development, social \r\ndevelopment and environmental protection, need to be \r\npromoted in an integrated, coordinated and balanced \r\nmanner. \r\n Myanmar strongly condemns terrorism in all its \r\nforms and manifestations. In today’s world, terrorism \r\nand transnational organized crime are increasingly \r\nthreatening human society. Myanmar is also among \r\nthose countries that have been victim of the scourge of \r\nterrorism. In that regard, we would like to express our \r\ndeepest condolences to the bereaved families of \r\nvictims of terrorism around the world. We welcome the \r\nSecretary-General’s commitment to conducting a \r\nglobal threat review in order to re-assess security \r\nthreats in the wake of the deadly attack in Abuja, \r\nNigeria. Myanmar stands ready to cooperate at the \r\nregional and international levels to prevent and combat \r\nterrorism and transnational organized crimes. Without \r\na stable and peaceful environment, sustainable \r\ndevelopment would not be possible for the people of a \r\ncountry or in a region and beyond. \r\n The Millennium Declaration set 2015 as the \r\ntarget date for achieving the Millennium Development \r\nGoals, which were formulated to address the welfare \r\nand needs of people around the world. Despite some \r\nprogress, development efforts have been hindered by \r\nvarious factors, such as slow economic growth, \r\ndiminishing resources, increasing food prices and \r\nongoing concern over food security, increasingly \r\nfrequent natural disasters and the challenges posed by \r\nclimate change. Each country has the primary \r\nresponsibility to generate its ways and means for \r\nachieving social and economic development. However, \r\nnational efforts to that end need to be supported by the \r\ninternational community. \r\n For our part, Myanmar is determined to promote \r\nbetter living standards and the equitable development \r\nof its people. To generate income, microfinance \r\nschemes have been introduced at the grassroots level. \r\nAccording to the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme, the poverty rate in Myanmar has \r\ndecreased from 32 per cent to 26 per cent in recent \r\nyears. However, we have to redouble our efforts to \r\nachieve MDG 1 by the year 2015. \r\n The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \r\nWeapons is the cornerstone of international efforts to \r\nprevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons, promote \r\nnuclear disarmament and cooperation, and ensure \r\naccess to nuclear energy. As a signatory to the Treaty, \r\nMyanmar remains committed to the three pillars of the \r\ntreaty. As a strong advocate of nuclear disarmament, \r\nMyanmar has been tabling a draft resolution on nuclear \r\ndisarmament every year since 1995, one which enjoys \r\nwide support from Member States. Myanmar firmly \r\nopposes the proliferation and production of nuclear \r\nweapons and strongly supports any efforts leading to \r\nthe realization of a world free of the threat of nuclear \r\nweapons and their by-products. \r\n Recently, the world around us has changed. We \r\nhave seen changes in Governments and political \r\nlandscapes. Myanmar has transformed and is moving \r\ntowards becoming a democratic nation in a smooth and \r\npeaceful manner. We have now embarked on a series of \r\nreforms in various sectors to bring about \r\ndemocratization and economic development and \r\nimprove the lives of our people. \r\n The steps taken by the Government of Myanmar \r\nare concrete, visible and irreversible. We will ensure \r\nthat the reform process is incremental, systematic and \r\ndynamic. Myanmar is strongly determined to continue \r\nimplementing the democratization process despite all \r\nof the current challenges. At this critical juncture, the \r\nencouragement, understanding and support of the \r\ninternational community are crucial to Myanmar’s \r\ntransition to democracy. \r\n The President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Pham Binh Minh, Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nthe Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. \r\n Mr. Pham Binh Minh (Viet Nam): On behalf of \r\nthe Vietnamese delegation, I wish to congratulate you, \r\nSir, on your unanimous election as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. I am \r\nconfident that your diplomatic skills and experience \r\nwill help to ensure the great success of the current \r\nsession. I would like to take this opportunity to express \r\nmy deep appreciation to Mr. Joseph Deiss for his \r\nsignificant contributions to the fruitful outcome of the \r\nsixty-fifth session. \r\nA/66/PV.28  \r\n \r\n11-51670 26 \r\n \r\n The Vietnamese delegation also wishes to \r\ncongratulate His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his \r\nreappointment as Secretary-General. We believe that, \r\nwith the cooperation of Member countries, the \r\nSecretary-General will make ever greater contributions \r\nto the operations of the United Nations and, thus, to \r\nglobal peace and development. We most warmly \r\nwelcome the Republic of South Sudan as the \r\n193rd Member of the Organization. \r\n Today, peace, cooperation and development \r\nremain the over-arching themes of our time. Yet \r\ntensions and conflicts persist in most continents and \r\nregions, owing to unresolved differences within nations \r\nand the threat and use of force. Climate change, natural \r\ndisasters, pandemics, transnational crime, the \r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and \r\ninternational terrorism are still the challenges that \r\ndemand effective responses. The world economy’s \r\nunstable recovery, coupled with economic downturns \r\nin many developed nations, has exposed developing \r\ncountries to the risks of even more unequal terms of \r\ntrade, rising protectionism, dwindling financial \r\nresources and the erosion of gains relating to the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). Multilateral \r\nnegotiations on issues of common interest, such as \r\ndisarmament and climate change, have not yielded \r\nresults that meet our expectations. \r\n The current situation compels nations to promote \r\ndialogue and cooperation so as to surmount common \r\nchallenges, man-made and natural alike. Peace, \r\nsecurity and stability remain the intense desire of all \r\nnations and are prerequisites for development. The key \r\nto success lies in each nation’s own efforts, as well as \r\nin enhanced international cooperation and \r\nmultilateralism based on respect for the fundamental \r\nprinciples of international law and the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, while taking into account the \r\nlegitimate interests of all countries, especially \r\ndeveloping ones. In that regard, Viet Nam commends \r\nyou, Mr. President, on the theme that you have \r\nproposed for the general debate, namely, the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes. \r\n As rightly pointed out by the Secretary-General, \r\nnever has the United Nations been so relevant and so \r\nurgently needed by so many people around the world. \r\nIt must deliver concrete results that make a real \r\ndifference in the daily lives of the world’s people. With \r\nits universal membership, the Organization \r\nundoubtedly enjoys a unique legitimacy and should \r\nthus be at the forefront of global governance and \r\nmultilateral cooperation. \r\n Over the past several years, the United Nations \r\nhas played a crucial role in ending conflicts and \r\npromoting peace processes in various regions. We \r\ndeeply value the initiatives that place the needs of the \r\npoorest and most vulnerable at the centre of the \r\ninternational agenda, as well as initiatives to mobilize \r\nresources and capacities to fulfil internationally agreed \r\naction plans, including the MDGs; facilitate \r\nmultilateral negotiations on climate change, as well as \r\non disarmament and the non-proliferation of weapons \r\nof mass destruction; provide solutions to such pressing \r\nissues as desertification, non-communicable diseases, \r\nnuclear safety and security; and respond to the global \r\nfinancial and economic crisis. We cannot help \r\nmentioning the efforts of the United Nations funds, \r\nprogrammes and specialized agencies to establish \r\nnorms and set agendas in accordance with their \r\nmandates, so as to assist developing countries in their \r\ndevelopment endeavours. \r\n At the same time, the international community \r\nlooks to the Organization as a source of inspiration and \r\nstrength, as a universal organization that can act \r\ndecisively to counter any tendency that may undermine \r\nits credibility or contradict its fundamental values and \r\nfounding purposes and principles. The Organization is \r\ntherefore expected to uphold the values of peace and \r\nsecurity, international law and multilateralism. It is \r\nalso expected to become more responsive and effective \r\non the ground, with the ultimate objective of better \r\nserving the needs and interests of Member States, in \r\nparticular the developing countries. \r\n As world peace and security are always our top \r\npriority, the United Nations should continue its \r\nconcerted and coherent efforts to promote the peaceful \r\nsettlement of civil wars and local conflicts in various \r\nregions of the world, especially those in North Africa \r\nand the Middle East, while preventing others from \r\nerupting.  \r\n We must cultivate a culture of peace and dialogue \r\nand promote the peaceful settlement of disputes. In that \r\nregard, Viet Nam supports efforts to end violence and \r\nstrengthen national reconstruction and reconciliation in \r\nAfghanistan and Iraq. As regards Palestine’s \r\napplication for full membership in the United Nations \r\nOrganization, Viet Nam wishes to underline the fact \r\nthat we recognized the State of Palestine in 1988. We \r\n A/66/PV.28\r\n \r\n27 11-51670 \r\n \r\nhave always supported the just struggle of the \r\nPalestinian people for their inalienable rights, \r\nincluding the right to establish an independent and \r\nsovereign State that coexists peacefully with Israel \r\nwith the pre-June 1967 borders. In that spirit, we affirm \r\nour strong support for Palestine’s efforts to soon \r\nbecome a full United Nations Member. \r\n We support United Nations efforts to translate the \r\noutcomes of the 2010 Review Conference of the \r\nParties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons and the recently concluded High-\r\nlevel Meeting on nuclear safety and security into \r\nconcrete results. We also support the Organization’s \r\nefforts to revitalize the work of the Conference on \r\nDisarmament and move multilateral disarmament \r\nnegotiations forwards. \r\n In parallel with security concerns, the \r\ninternational community, with the United Nations at \r\nthe centre, should work for more equal international \r\nrelations, a fairer international economic and financial \r\narchitecture and more just institutions. Developing \r\ncountries must have a greater role and say in \r\ninternational governance. They should be enabled to \r\ntake part in the globalization process in a more \r\nproactive and effective manner. Developed countries, \r\nfor their part, should deliver on their obligations and \r\ncommitments, including the maintenance of \r\nmacroeconomic stability, contribution to the successful \r\nconclusion of the Doha Round, the elimination of \r\nunfair trade measures and an increase in development \r\nassistance.  \r\n Given the continued need to draw on the thinking \r\nand action towards a more stable and healthy global \r\neconomic environment, we wish to recommend that the \r\nUnited Nations convene a meeting in the General \r\nAssembly or the Economic and Social Council to \r\nfollow up the Outcome of the Conference on the World \r\nFinancial and Economic Crisis and Its Impact on \r\nDevelopment (resolution 63/303), which was held in \r\nJune 2009. \r\n In the meantime, the United Nations should \r\nundertake measures to prevent the unilateral use of \r\neconomic means against developing countries. Viet \r\nNam strongly calls for an end to the economic embargo \r\nagainst the Republic of Cuba. \r\n Moreover, to promote inclusive and sustainable \r\ndevelopment, political commitment and efforts, with \r\nthe central coordinating role played by the United \r\nNations, must be doubled for the attainment of \r\nequitable and sustainable development for all. Four \r\nyears from the agreed target date of 2015, it is essential \r\nthat the global partnership for development be \r\nexpanded, both in breadth and depth, so as to provide \r\ncountries in need with relevant policy experience, \r\nresources and best practices to achieve the MDGs and \r\nmaintain the process thereof.  \r\n Equally important is to begin developing a vision \r\nfor a global development platform for the post-2015 \r\nperiod. We must also work much harder together to \r\nensure the fruitful outcomes of the forthcoming \r\nseventeenth session of the Conference of Parties to the \r\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange in South Africa and the United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development in Brazil. \r\n Viet Nam is committed to working with other \r\nMember States to revitalize the General Assembly as \r\nthe principal deliberative, policymaking and \r\nrepresentative organ, to enhance the overarching role \r\nof the Economic and Social Council in the \r\ndevelopment sphere, and to enlarge Security Council \r\nmembership and improve its working methods. We also \r\nlook forward to more coherent, consistent and effective \r\ndevelopment activities of the United Nations system so \r\nas to align them effectively with the national priorities \r\nof recipient countries. In an effort to contribute to \r\nUnited Nations reforms, Viet Nam has been active in \r\nimplementing the Delivering as One initiative and, \r\ntogether with the United Nations and other partners, \r\nhas made tangible progress. \r\n Viet Nam welcomes the adoption of resolution \r\n65/281 on the review of the Human Rights Council. We \r\nwish to stress that the operation of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil and other United Nations human rights \r\nmechanisms should continue to be improved in order to \r\nbecome more effective, consistent and efficient, while \r\nfocusing more on dialogue and experience-sharing. To \r\nfurther contribute to that end, we have presented Viet \r\nNam’s candidature for membership of the Human \r\nRights Council for the term 2013-2016. \r\n The year 2011 is important for Viet Nam since we \r\nhave successfully organized the eleventh party \r\ncongress and the elections of State bodies. We have \r\nalso adopted a socio-economic development strategy \r\nfor the next decade. During the past 25 years of \r\ncomprehensive renewal, Viet Nam has made significant \r\nachievements in many aspects and the country has \r\nA/66/PV.28  \r\n \r\n11-51670 28 \r\n \r\nintegrated extensively into international life. We have \r\nmanaged to establish and strengthen stable and long-\r\nterm frameworks of relations with major countries and \r\nglobal and regional economic and political centres.  \r\n Building on those achievements, in the coming \r\nperiod, Viet Nam is determined to comprehensively \r\nstep up the renewal process, with higher quality and \r\neffectiveness, as well as national industrialization and \r\nmodernization, in combination with the development of \r\na knowledge-based economy. \r\n In an effort to broaden and deepen our relations \r\nwith other countries, Viet Nam will continue an \r\nindependent foreign policy for peace, cooperation and \r\ndevelopment. Viet Nam is a reliable friend and partner, \r\nas well as a responsible member of the international \r\ncommunity, working for the prosperity of every nation, \r\nnational independence, global peace, democracy and \r\nsocial progress.  \r\n We shall enhance international integration and \r\nproactively participate in and contribute to regional \r\nand international multilateral forums, such as the \r\nUnited Nations, the Asia-Europe Meeting, the Asia-\r\nPacific Economic Cooperation, the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement and the Group of 77 and China, on solving \r\nglobal issues of nuclear security, nuclear disarmament, \r\ncrime prevention, climate change, sustainable \r\ndevelopment and cooperation on the Mekong River.  \r\n Furthermore, we are always willing to share with \r\nother countries our experiences in South-South and \r\ntripartite cooperation, financing for development, \r\nenhancing aid effectiveness and mainstreaming the \r\nMDGs into national socio-economic strategies. \r\n We shall work closely with the other members of \r\nthe Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) \r\nand other stakeholders for peace, stability, cooperation \r\nand development in South-East Asia, East Asia and \r\nbeyond through ASEAN-led mechanisms and \r\ninstruments, such as the Treaty of Amity and \r\nCooperation in Southeast Asia, the South-East Asia \r\nNuclear-Weapon-Free-Zone, the ASEAN Regional \r\nForum and the East Asia Summit. \r\n In that regard, Viet Nam welcomes and supports \r\ncontributions to peace and security in the Eastern Sea. \r\nLike other ASEAN members, Viet Nam is strongly \r\ncommitted to dialogue and confidence-building \r\nmechanisms and stands ready to support and \r\nparticipate in any effort to find peaceful settlements to \r\ndisputes, in accordance with international law, \r\nincluding the 1982 United Nations Convention on the \r\nLaw of the Sea, and that are acceptable to all parties \r\nconcerned. Pending such a solution, we will, along \r\nwith the parties concerned, strictly observe the \r\nDeclaration on the Conduct of Parties in the Eastern \r\nSea. We welcome the stated commitments to working \r\ntogether towards the conclusion of a code of conduct in \r\nthe foreseeable future. \r\n This year’s session of the General Assembly is \r\ntaking place at a crucial juncture as the world is faced \r\nwith daunting challenges. It is my firm belief that only \r\nby undertaking joint efforts and enhancing multilateral \r\ncooperation could we meet the expectations and \r\naspirations of our peoples and manage to set out the \r\nright direction for the long-term development of the \r\nUnited Nations. Viet Nam remains strongly committed \r\nto that endeavour. \r\n The President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Elmar Mammadyarov, Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof the Republic of Azerbaijan. \r\n Mr. Mammadyarov (Azerbaijan): I would like to \r\njoin previous speakers in congratulating you, Sir, on \r\nyour election as President of General Assembly at the \r\nsixty-sixth session, and wish you every success in that \r\nhighly responsible post. I thank your predecessor, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Joseph Deiss, for his productive work \r\nduring the last session. \r\n I also express my profound respect and gratitude \r\nto the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ban \r\nKi-moon, for his leadership and dedication to \r\nrevitalizing the United Nations Organization. \r\n With regard to the theme of this year’s general \r\ndebate, we welcome the adoption at the sixty-fifth \r\nsession of resolution 65/283 on strengthening the role \r\nof mediation in the peaceful settlement of disputes, \r\nconflict prevention and resolution. In that document, \r\nthe General Assembly reiterated that all Member States \r\nshould strictly adhere to their obligations, as laid down \r\nin the United Nations Charter, and reaffirmed, inter \r\nalia, the commitment to respect the sovereignty, \r\nterritorial integrity and political independence of all \r\nStates. \r\n Azerbaijan looks forward to the relevant guidance \r\nfor more effective mediation, as indicated in the \r\nresolution, and we are ready to actively contribute to \r\nits elaboration. Unfortunately, we have to admit that \r\n A/66/PV.28\r\n \r\n29 11-51670 \r\n \r\nnot all States approach their international obligations \r\nresponsibly and comply with the generally accepted \r\nnorms and principles of international law. \r\n For almost two decades, we have witnessed the \r\nflagrant violation of the United Nations Charter and \r\nother documents of international law by the Republic \r\nof Armenia, which has perpetrated aggression against \r\nthe sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic \r\nof Azerbaijan. As a result of that aggression, almost \r\n20 per cent of the territory of Azerbaijan remains under \r\noccupation and about 1 million Azerbaijani refugees \r\nand internally displaced persons are unable to return to \r\ntheir homes. \r\n In 1993, the Security Council adopted four \r\nresolutions (resolutions 822 (1993), 853 (1993) 874 \r\n(1993) and 884 (1993)) demanding the immediate, \r\ncomplete and unconditional withdrawal of Armenian \r\nforces from all the occupied territories of Azerbaijan \r\nand reaffirmed the sovereignty, territorial integrity and \r\ninviolability of the internationally recognized borders \r\nof Azerbaijan. The same appeals were made also by \r\nother international organizations. Unfortunately, \r\nArmenia continues to ignore the calls of the \r\ninternational community. \r\n What is even more worrisome is that, instead of \r\npreparing its people for a peaceful, prosperous and \r\nstable future in friendship and cooperation with the \r\nneighbouring countries, the leadership of Armenia \r\ncontinues to publicly incite the future generations to \r\nnew wars, violence and aggression and to propagate, \r\nby all means, the dangerous ideas of animosity and \r\nhatred towards not only Azerbaijan, but also other \r\npeoples of the region. \r\n Illegal activities in the occupied territories of \r\nAzerbaijan, including the implantation of ethnic \r\nArmenian settlers, as well as the destruction and \r\nappropriation of historical and cultural heritage, \r\nrepresent another source of serious concern. Such \r\nactivities serve to further consolidate the current status \r\nquo of the occupation, securing the results of ethnic \r\ncleansing and colonization of the seized lands, as well \r\nas to seriously hamper the prospects for conflict \r\nresolution. Earlier in this Hall, we heard a very \r\naggressive and unconstructive statement by the \r\nPresident of Armenia. He openly confirmed that \r\ndestructive policy of Armenia. (see A/66/PV.19) \r\n The Field Assessment Mission conducted by the \r\nMinsk Group Co-Chairs of the Organization for \r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe in October 2010 to \r\nthe occupied territories of Azerbaijan, stated, inter alia, \r\nthat the status quo of the occupation was unacceptable \r\nand urged Armenia to put an end to its illegal practices \r\nin those territories.  \r\n As a country suffering from the occupation of its \r\nterritories and the forcible displacement of hundreds of \r\nthousands of its citizens, Azerbaijan is the most \r\ninterested party in the earliest negotiated settlement of \r\nthe conflict. Our position is well known to the \r\ninternational community. It is based on strict adherence \r\nto the norms and principles of international law, \r\naccording to which the acquisition of territory by force \r\nis inadmissible and must be rejected resolutely and \r\nunconditionally. \r\n It is absolutely illogical that the leadership of \r\nArmenia, which has implemented the total ethnic \r\ncleansing of not only the occupied territories of \r\nAzerbaijan, but also of the Azerbaijani population in its \r\nown territory, is trying to apply the principle of self-\r\ndetermination. It is obvious that one cannot expel \r\npeoples from their homes on ethnic grounds and, at the \r\nsame time, speak about self-determination for those \r\nwho remain on the same grounds. \r\n Azerbaijan recognizes that the right of peoples to \r\nself-determination can be implemented only  \r\n “at all times in conformity with the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations \r\nand with the relevant norms of international law, \r\nincluding those relating to territorial integrity of \r\nStates”,  \r\nas enshrined in the Helsinki Final Act. \r\n Azerbaijan is confident that the conflict \r\nresolution must start with the withdrawal of Armenian \r\narmed forces from the occupied territories, within the \r\nfixed timetable, followed by the restoration of \r\ncommunications, the return of refugees and internally \r\ndisplaced persons, and the creation of conditions for \r\nthe peaceful coexistence of Azerbaijanis and \r\nArmenians in the Nagorno Karabakh region within the \r\nterritorial integrity of Azerbaijan. That step-by-step \r\napproach, which has been proposed by mediators and \r\nsupported by the international community, except, \r\nunfortunately, the leadership of Armenia, can bring \r\ndurable peace, stability and predictability to the region. \r\n Azerbaijan still maintains its interest, motivation \r\nand patience in that very hard and sensitive process of \r\nA/66/PV.28  \r\n \r\n11-51670 30 \r\n \r\nnegotiations. We believe that the international \r\ncommunity will convince the Armenian side to respect \r\nthe generally accepted norms and principles of \r\ninternational law and cease abusing the right of \r\nAzerbaijanis to live within their own territories, \r\nincluding the Nagorno Karabakh region. In return, we \r\nare ready to guarantee the highest level of self-rule for \r\nthat region within the Republic of Azerbaijan. \r\n I would like to touch upon another important \r\nissue of the international agenda — Palestine. \r\nAzerbaijan reaffirms its adherence to the position \r\nexpressed by the majority of the United Nations \r\nMember States. We reiterate our long-standing \r\nsolidarity with the people and leadership of Palestine, \r\nand believe that the time has come to reach a \r\nbreakthrough in that long-standing and very important \r\nissue. The time has come for Palestine to be fully \r\nrepresented at the United Nations. \r\n Azerbaijan is determined to contribute further to \r\nthe realization of the development goals and objectives \r\nagreed within the United Nations. In recent years, \r\nAzerbaijan has enhanced its humanitarian assistance to \r\nsupport international and national efforts aimed at \r\neradicating poverty and promoting sustainable \r\ndevelopment and global prosperity for all. We pay \r\nparticular attention to addressing the special needs and \r\nvulnerabilities of developing and least developed \r\ncountries, as well as those recovering from natural \r\ndisasters and suffering from climate change, in \r\nparticular small island States. \r\n The recent humanitarian crisis in the Horn of \r\nAfrica once again demonstrated the importance of \r\nglobal solidarity. Azerbaijan has provided urgent aid to \r\nsupport the ongoing efforts towards the eradication of \r\nfamine in that region. The Government of Azerbaijan is \r\ncurrently considering additional funding to support the \r\ninternational community in ramping up its efforts to \r\nrespond to the humanitarian situation and contribute to \r\na mid- and long-term sustainable solution to the crisis \r\nin the Horn of Africa. \r\n Proceeding from the fruitful cooperation between \r\nthe United Nations and the Government of Azerbaijan, \r\nresolution 64/186, entitled “Building connectivity \r\nthrough the Trans-Eurasian Information Super \r\nHighway”, initiated by Azerbaijan, was adopted at the \r\nsixty-fourth session of the General Assembly on \r\n21 December 2009. As the main coordinator of the \r\nproject, Azerbaijan has conducted a feasibility study \r\nand is financing the Secretariat of the project. We have \r\ntaken a number of steps towards the establishment of a \r\nconsortium, comprising of major telecommunications \r\noperators in the region. \r\n Azerbaijan has always been a place of \r\ncoexistence and tolerance among various faiths, ethnic \r\ngroups and philosophies. It is one of the unique places \r\nwhere different cultures and civilizations meet at the \r\ncrossroads between East and West and North and \r\nSouth. \r\n As a bridge between cultures and an active \r\nmember of the Group of Friends of the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations, Azerbaijan feels responsible for \r\npromoting interreligious and intercultural dialogue \r\nbased on mutual respect and understanding. Thus, over \r\nthe past years, we hosted a number of high-profile and \r\naction-oriented events, including the Summit of World \r\nReligious Leaders in April 2010, the World Forum for \r\nIntercultural Dialogue from 7 to 9 April 2011 and other \r\nsimilar events. \r\n Desiring to contribute further to the maintenance \r\nof international peace, security, stability and prosperity, \r\nAzerbaijan has put forward its candidature for a \r\nnon-permanent seat on the Security Council for the \r\nterm of 2012-2013. The elections will be held this year \r\non 21 October at the General Assembly. \r\n The year 2012 marks the twentieth anniversary of \r\nAzerbaijan’s membership in the United Nations, \r\nalthough, unlike other candidates from the Group of \r\nEastern European States, we have never had an \r\nopportunity to become a member of the Security \r\nCouncil. Azerbaijan’s election to the Security Council \r\nwould contribute to redressing the underrepresentation \r\nof small developing States and bring a more balanced \r\nmembership to that United Nations organ. The \r\nGovernment of the Republic of Azerbaijan would \r\nhighly appreciate the valuable support of the States \r\nMembers of the United Nations for its candidature for \r\na non-permanent seat in the Security Council. \r\n The President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nDato Sri Anifah Aman, Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nMalaysia. \r\n Mr. Aman (Malaysia): I would like to take this \r\nopportunity to congratulate you, Sir, on your election \r\nas President of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth \r\nsession. I have no doubt that, under your able \r\nleadership, the Assembly will be able to complete its \r\n A/66/PV.28\r\n \r\n31 11-51670 \r\n \r\ndeliberations and proceedings successfully. In that \r\nrespect, I wish to assure you of Malaysia’s full support \r\nfor your presidency. Permit me also to congratulate His \r\nExcellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his reappointment as \r\nSecretary-General. \r\n The theme you have chosen for the general \r\ndebate, “The role of mediation in the settlement of \r\ndisputes by peaceful means”, is apt, fitting and timely. \r\nIndeed, the United Nations itself was established as an \r\ninstrument of mediation to promote peace, security and \r\nstability among the nations of the world. Many in this \r\nbody have spoken about the importance of settling \r\ndisputes through mediation. Malaysia shares that view. \r\n In the final analysis, peace can be achieved only \r\nif people are willing to engage in mediation. Now, \r\nmore than ever before, mediation must be made to \r\nwork in the Middle East crisis, as it is the only option \r\navailable for the achievement of lasting peace. \r\n Year after year after year, we have hoped for a \r\npeaceful and just resolution of the Palestinian issue. In \r\nthe time that we have spent hoping, we have also come \r\nto realize that mediation is the only means of providing \r\na sustainable resolution to all conflicts and crises. As \r\nsuch, all of us have a role to play in ensuring that it is \r\neffective. Patience and prudence have their merits, but \r\npatience and prudence must not result in paralysis. This \r\nbody and the Security Council have adopted numerous \r\nresolutions on Palestine, yet there has been no tangible \r\noutcome.  \r\n We support the application of the Palestinians to \r\nthe United Nations and welcome the readiness of both \r\nparties to hold talks on the basis of the existing \r\ninternational legal framework. In that connection, \r\nMalaysia fully supports the legitimate rights of the \r\nPalestinian people to an independent State of Palestine, \r\nbased on the two-State solution, taking into account the \r\nsecurity concerns of both parties. \r\n For some time now, our world has been battered \r\nby unprecedented political challenges, devastating \r\nnational calamities and financial crises. During that \r\ntime, our institutions and mechanisms have seemed \r\nincapable of handling these challenges and the pace at \r\nwhich they surface. To compound the situation, while \r\nwe address long-standing causes of international \r\ninstability, non-traditional threats to peace and security, \r\nsuch as terrorism, pose additional challenges.  \r\n As we share the grief of those who lost their \r\nloved ones in the 9/11 attack 10 years ago, we must \r\nstrengthen our resolve to eradicate terrorism in all its \r\nforms and manifestations. That can be achieved only \r\nby addressing the root causes of terrorism, which \r\nwould cut off sympathy and support for those \r\ncommitting acts of terrorism. We must at the same time \r\nwin the hearts and minds of the people to ensure that \r\nour victory over terrorism is not short-lived. \r\n But the winning of hearts and minds is only half \r\nof what I would call the battle of perceptions. The \r\nother half consists of combating expressions of \r\nextremist sentiments. Despite our continuing efforts to \r\npromote world peace and harmony, we still witness the \r\nincreasing trend to perpetuate and fuel Islamophobia. \r\nThere have been attempts to pit Islam against the West, \r\ndemonize Islam and to link Islam with terrorism. Those \r\nirresponsible acts further intensify the divide between \r\nthe broader Muslim world and the West.  \r\n The real issue is not between Muslims and \r\nnon-Muslims but between moderates and extremists in \r\nall religions, whether Islam, Christianity or Judaism. It \r\nis in light of the growing tide of extremist sentiments \r\naround the globe that the Prime Minister of Malaysia \r\ncalled for the creation of a global movement of \r\nmoderates at this Assembly last year (see A/65/PV.19). \r\nThis clarion call has come at the right moment in \r\nhistory. We must ensure that the voices of moderation, \r\nwhich currently constitute the silent majority, prevail \r\nover those of extremism in efforts to find solutions to \r\nthe growing challenges faced by the international \r\ncommunity. \r\n There has been wide acceptance of this \r\nmovement at the highest levels of global political \r\nleadership, such as the Asia-Europe Meeting and the \r\nEast Asia Summit. More recently, the Association of \r\nSoutheast Asian Nations has endorsed the movement of \r\nmoderates as its contribution to global developments. \r\nMalaysia will work diligently to ensure that the global \r\nmovement of moderates will complement the ongoing \r\nactivities of the United Nations Alliance of \r\nCivilizations and other intercultural and interfaith \r\ndialogues so that moderation will triumph over \r\nextremism. \r\n We cannot turn a blind eye to the needs of States \r\nthat are severely affected by natural calamities. The \r\nsituation in Somalia has touched the hearts of many. \r\nFor our part, Malaysia last month pledged $1 million to \r\nA/66/PV.28  \r\n \r\n11-51670 32 \r\n \r\nthe Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) Trust \r\nFund for Somalia and dispatched a humanitarian \r\nmission to mitigate the sufferings of our Somali \r\nbrothers and sisters. A valiant Malaysian son lost his \r\nlife carrying out this mission. However, such incidents \r\nwill never deter us from continuing to provide \r\nhumanitarian assistance to all other countries in need. \r\n In the field of the environment, we seem to be \r\nlosing focus. We know that we are not lacking in good \r\nplans, but that we lack political will and the means to \r\nimplement those agreed plans. As much as we are \r\nconcerned about implementation failures, we are also \r\nconcerned at the paralysing differences in on the areas \r\nof institutional framework and sustainable \r\ndevelopment. The failure of the Commission on \r\nSustainable Development to deliver a successful \r\noutcome last May clearly demonstrated that.  \r\n The lack of progress and unwillingness to honour \r\ncommitments under the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change is another example. We \r\nmust ensure that the principle of common but \r\ndifferentiated responsibilities, coupled with historical \r\nresponsibility, is enshrined in all our endeavours to \r\nachieve a successful conclusion on climate change \r\nnegotiations and sustainable development. \r\n In moving towards the United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development, there are new \r\nthoughts on strengthening the institutional frameworks \r\nfor the environment. If the current institutional \r\nframeworks are unable to meet the daunting \r\nenvironmental challenges, we may have to look at new \r\nmechanisms that are inclusive and participatory, with \r\nequitable decision-making responsibilities. \r\n Nuclear disarmament occupies a central role in \r\nthe work of the United Nations. This is reflected by the \r\nfact that the very first resolution adopted by the \r\nGeneral Assembly spoke, among other things, of “the \r\nelimination from national armaments of atomic \r\nweapons and of all other major weapons adaptable to \r\nmass destruction” (resolution 1(I), para. 5 (c)). Yet \r\n65 years on, it remains a silent dream. All States need \r\nto do their part in order to achieve more substantive \r\nprogress in this area. \r\n Malaysia is committed to working with other \r\nMember States to realize the goal of a nuclear-weapon-\r\nfree world. We will continue to advocate the total \r\nelimination of nuclear weapons through a nuclear \r\nweapons convention. To progress further on that issue, \r\nconsensus is required on commencing the multilateral \r\nnegotiations process. This, in turn, will require good \r\nfaith on the part of the States possessing nuclear \r\nweapons. I call on all those States to demonstrate such \r\ngood faith. \r\n It is apparent that the current international \r\nfinancial architecture is unable to cope with recent \r\ndevelopments in the world financial markets. The \r\nWorld Bank has warned that we are about to enter a \r\ndanger zone. We need a new financial architecture that \r\nwill be transparent, equitable, representational and \r\nparticipatory and that will reduce volatility. Lessons \r\ncan be learned from the economies of developing \r\ncountries that embarked on economic reform and \r\nstrengthened their financial institutions following the \r\nAsian financial crisis. Let us put pride aside and learn \r\nfrom each other. \r\n In our quest to move up the value chain and \r\nenhance competitiveness, Malaysia has embarked on \r\nits own transformation programmes based on the \r\nconcept of One Malaysia, the Government transformation \r\nprogramme, the economic transformation programme \r\nand the new economic model. As part of the \r\ntransformation programme, Malaysia has taken a giant \r\nleap in reforming its internal security and emergency \r\nlaws, which will be replaced by legislation to prevent \r\nsubversive action, terrorism and organized crime. \r\n Malaysia is transforming and reforming itself to \r\nbetter adapt to a changing global landscape. We believe \r\nthat the United Nations must do the same. We would \r\nlike to see a comprehensive reform of the United \r\nNations so that it will be able to face current realities \r\nand address present challenges. Most particularly, the \r\nSecurity Council should be comprehensively reformed \r\nto make it more legitimate, representative, democratic \r\nand transparent. The Council must be effective, \r\ntransparent and accountable to the larger United \r\nNations membership in order to strengthen its \r\nmediation capacities. It must not remain beholden to \r\nthe veto holders. \r\n In that respect, I return to the President’s theme. \r\nWe need to adopt mediation in the search for peace. To \r\nthat, I would add the principles of transformation and \r\nmoderation. A combination of mediation, transformation \r\nand moderation will constitute a winning formula to \r\nrealize lasting world peace. Let us take up the \r\nchallenge with the fortitude required and together \r\nimplement it for a united and a better world for all. \r\n A/66/PV.28\r\n \r\n33 11-51670 \r\n \r\n The President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Arthur Peter Mutharika, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Republic of Malawi. \r\n Mr. Mutharika (Malawi): First of all, let me say \r\nhow pleased I am to come before the General \r\nAssembly and to address it on behalf of His Excellency \r\nMr. Bingu Wa Mutharika, President of the Republic of \r\nMalawi. The President was unable to attend due to \r\nother State commitments, but he sends his greetings to \r\nyou, Sir, the Secretary-General and all the peoples of \r\nthe United Nations.  \r\n At the outset, I would like to extend my sincere \r\ncongratulations to you, Sir, on your election as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly. Your election is a \r\nmanifestation of the confidence that the people of the \r\nUnited Nations have in your leadership. I wish you \r\nwell as you lead this body in the next several months. \r\n Allow me also to take this opportunity to \r\ncongratulate Mr. Joseph Deiss, the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-fifth session, for his \r\neffective leadership during his tenure. I had the \r\nopportunity of working with him in Istanbul, and he \r\nwas very helpful to me personally as a new participant \r\nin those international activities. He also showed much \r\ninterest in Africa. I hope that, whatever he does in \r\nfuture, he will continue to show interest in Africa.  \r\n Let me also take the opportunity to congratulate \r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon on his unanimous reappointment as \r\nSecretary-General. His endorsement has demonstrated \r\nthe international community’s confidence in his \r\nleadership. I remember his visit to Malawi this past \r\nyear, when he came to visit the Millennium Village. \r\nThe people of Mwandama village anxiously await his \r\nreturn, and they have sent word through me to ask him, \r\nwhenever he has time, to come back to Malawi.  \r\n Let me take this opportunity to join other \r\nspeakers in congratulating our brothers and sisters of \r\nSouth Sudan for achieving their independence. I am \r\nparticularly excited about this because, when South \r\nSudan gained its independence, Malawi was Chair of \r\nthe African Union and played a small part in its \r\nemergence as an independent State. I am very excited \r\nabout that. The emergence of South Sudan is, I believe, \r\na good manifestation of the importance of mediation \r\nand negotiation in the settlement of disputes by \r\npeaceful means. There is no question in my mind that \r\nthe remaining issues that exist between South Sudan \r\nand the Sudan will also be resolved in a peaceful \r\nmanner. I therefore wish them well. \r\n The theme of this general debate is “The role of \r\nmediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful \r\nmeans”. I consider this an opportune time to discuss \r\nthat particular issue because today we are faced with \r\nnew problems, including inter-State and intra-State \r\nproblems. There is a new phenomenon of people who \r\nbecome divided over ethnic, linguistic, religious or \r\ncultural differences within States. Methods must \r\ntherefore be found to resolve disputes within States. \r\n I therefore wish to commend the United Nations \r\nand to encourage the establishment of durable \r\nmechanisms to ensure that disputes between and within \r\nStates are resolved in a peaceful manner. In that \r\ncontext, I congratulate the African Union, regional \r\norganizations and other international organizations for \r\nthe mediation work they have done, especially in \r\nAfrica. I would like to encourage developing countries, \r\nespecially African States, to make sure to adopt the \r\npractice of resolving disputes in universities and to \r\ntrain people at regional and local levels in dispute \r\nsettlement and resolution techniques. \r\n There are a number of issues facing the United \r\nNations and the world, but my country has identified \r\nfive that I hope will be put at the forefront of the \r\nUnited Nations agenda at this and future sessions. The \r\nfirst issue is that of disaster relief and management. \r\nDisasters have now become a major problem in most of \r\nour countries. They strain the resources of the least \r\ndeveloped countries, particularly in Africa. We face \r\nproblems of floods, heavy rains, droughts, earthquakes, \r\nheavy winds and hurricanes almost every day. Such \r\ndevelopments have the effect of turning back the \r\nprogress made with respect to the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. Therefore, I would like to invite \r\nthe international community to set up mechanisms in \r\nAfrica and elsewhere in the developing world that can \r\nassist us in managing disasters. \r\n My country also attaches importance to the issue \r\nof climate change. Climate change has become an \r\nextremely difficult issue in Africa, where crops are \r\ndestroyed because there is either too much rain or too \r\nlittle rain, too much wind or too much sunshine. All \r\nthese possibilities are due to climate change. Therefore, \r\nI encourage the international community to come up \r\nwith mechanisms to manage climate change. I know \r\nthat countries like Malawi have not contributed to the \r\nA/66/PV.28  \r\n \r\n11-51670 34 \r\n \r\nincidence of climate change. Nevertheless, we feel we \r\ndo have a collective responsibility to make sure that \r\nthe issue of climate change is addressed. I hope that the \r\nupcoming seventeenth Conference of the Parties to the \r\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange, scheduled to take place in South Africa, will \r\naddress this particular problem.  \r\n The third area to which my country attaches \r\nimportance is the issue of peace and security. As we are \r\nall aware, no matter how much development we \r\nachieve, it will be meaningless if there is no peace and \r\nsecurity in our countries. Unfortunately, in our \r\ncountries, especially in Africa, we now face a lot of \r\nchallenges. There are movements of people who are \r\nbent upon bringing about unconstitutional changes of \r\nGovernment, thereby causing instability.  \r\n In the case of Malawi, we are committed to \r\nmaintaining peace and security. We are also committed \r\nto democracy and good governance. In this regard, \r\nMalawi has, for example, instituted a number of \r\nbodies, such as the Malawi Human Rights \r\nCommission, an ombudsman, an anti-corruption bureau \r\nand the Department of the Auditor General. All these \r\ninstitutions are institutions of good governance aimed \r\nat improving the governance in our part of Africa, and \r\ncertainly in Malawi.  \r\n Another issue that is of importance to Malawi in \r\nparticular and to Africa in general is the issue of self-\r\ndetermination. We still have over 2 million people in \r\ndifferent parts of the world living under colonial \r\ndomination. I want to urge the international community \r\nto make sure that by the end of the Third International \r\nDecade for the Eradication of Colonialism — from \r\n2011 to 2021 — all the territories under colonial \r\ndomination will be free and independent. I think that \r\nself-governance is a very important concept. The self-\r\ndetermination of colonized peoples is enshrined in the \r\nCharter of the United Nations.  \r\n Of course, there is another element of self-\r\ndetermination which the United Nations obviously has \r\nto address, namely, that of self-determination outside \r\nthe colonial context. It is an extremely complicated \r\nproblem that needs to be addressed and studied. First \r\nof all, what does self-determination mean within the \r\ncontext of non-colonial States? What are peoples \r\nwithin the context of non-colonial States? It is an issue \r\nthat obviously we must address because it is an \r\nimportant one. \r\n Finally, my Government attaches great \r\nimportance to the role of the Security Council. There is \r\nno question that the Council has played an extremely \r\nimportant role since the creation of the United Nations \r\nin 1945. However, I think it is obvious to everybody \r\nthat the structure created in 1945 is no longer \r\napplicable to the present situation. We need therefore \r\nto make sure that the Security Council is democratized. \r\nWe need to make sure that majority of countries, \r\nespecially those most affected by the Security Council, \r\nlike Malawi and others in Africa, are given a role to \r\nplay in the Council. I therefore would like to endorse \r\nAfrica’s common position, known as the Ezulwini \r\nConsensus, that two permanent member seats and five \r\nnon-permanent seats in the Security Council should be \r\ngiven to Africa.  \r\n The President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Surapong Tovichakchaikul, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Kingdom of Thailand. \r\n Mr. Tovichakchaikul (Thailand): On behalf of \r\nthe delegation of the Kingdom of Thailand, allow me \r\nto extend to you, Sir, our warmest congratulations on \r\nyour election as President of the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-sixth session. It is a personal honour for me to \r\nspeak for the first time before this gathering of the \r\nworld’s nations. Please be assured of my delegation’s \r\nfull support and cooperation in the conduct of the work \r\nof this body. \r\n The year 2011 has already become a monumental \r\nyear in modern history. The call for reforms in the \r\nMiddle East and North Africa has led to unprecedented \r\ntransitions and popular uprisings. The so-called Arab \r\nSpring underscores the significance of people’s \r\nlegitimate aspirations and the need to respond \r\nadequately to them. In this age of globalization, \r\ninformation, ideas and values flow beyond borders.  \r\n For Thailand, after experiencing some political \r\nunrest, the country has taken another step forward in its \r\ndemocratic process. The general elections held on \r\n3 July this year went smoothly, which is a testament to \r\nthe resilience of Thai democracy. The new Government \r\nhas been successfully formed, with a solid mandate \r\nfrom the people. Indeed, the voter turnout was the \r\nhighest in Thailand’s electoral history. The \r\nAdministration of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra \r\nis now working resolutely to deliver on the promises it \r\nmade during the election campaign. In implementing \r\npeople-centred policies, it seeks to establish a strong, \r\n A/66/PV.28\r\n \r\n35 11-51670 \r\n \r\nequitable and sustainable economic infrastructure in \r\nthe country. More importantly, the Government is \r\ndetermined to promote reconciliation and uphold the \r\nrule of law to serve as a basis for harmony and unity \r\nwithin the country. \r\n As far as our foreign relations are concerned, the \r\nGovernment will further enhance relations with \r\nneighbouring countries and our friends outside the \r\nregion. Special emphasis is placed on promoting trust, \r\nconfidence and mutual respect, which is particularly \r\nimportant as we prepare for the realization of the \r\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations Community in \r\n2015. We will also strengthen international cooperation \r\nat all forums and levels, particularly with the United \r\nNations. \r\n Thailand seeks to play a responsible and \r\nconstructive role in the current international order. \r\nThailand is convinced that the three pillars of the \r\nUnited Nations ─ peace and security, development and \r\nhuman rights ─ are all interconnected and mutually \r\nreinforcing. They are issues that need to be addressed \r\ncomprehensively in order to achieve the ultimate goal \r\nof human security for our peoples. They are also issues \r\nthat Thailand will emphasize in its cooperation with \r\nthe United Nations. \r\n In terms of peace and security, Thailand believes \r\nthat this year’s theme for the General Assembly’s \r\ngeneral debate, as proposed by you, Mr. President, is \r\nvery timely. Mediation is a crucial tool for helping to \r\nresolve disputes peacefully. The recent birth of the \r\nRepublic of South Sudan and its swift admission to the \r\nUnited Nations are clear testaments to the constructive \r\nrole of Mediterranean and the continued engagement of \r\nthe United Nations in conflict resolution. Thailand \r\nwelcomes the Republic of South Sudan into the global \r\ncommunity, and wishes to forge bilateral relations and \r\na partnership for development with this new State. \r\n Thailand is convinced that the peaceful resolution \r\nof conflicts is the most desirable and cost-effective \r\napproach in terms of both human lives and financial \r\nexpense. For that reason, political will remains a key \r\ningredient without which such an approach cannot be \r\nsuccessful.  \r\n Wishing to do our part, Thailand has actively \r\nsupported the comprehensive peace operations and \r\npeacekeeping missions of the United Nations in more \r\nthan 20 locations around the world. We are currently \r\ndeploying an infantry battalion with the African Union-\r\nUnited Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur. We have \r\nalso sent police and military officers to the United \r\nNations peacekeeping missions in Timor-Leste and \r\nHaiti, and we are about to deploy military officers to a \r\nUnited Nations operation in Kashmir. In addition, since \r\nautumn 2010 Thailand has sent two counter-piracy task \r\ngroups to join international efforts to patrol and protect \r\nships from pirate attacks in the Gulf of Aden area. \r\nThese are just a few examples of our effort to play a \r\nmeaningful role in maintaining international peace and \r\nsecurity. \r\n If international stability is one of our primary \r\ngoals, Thailand firmly believes that a key foundation \r\nfor lasting peace is sustainable development. \r\nSustainable development is an essential tool for \r\neradicating poverty and inequality, which are root \r\ncauses of insecurity. As the guiding principle of our \r\nsocial and economic policy, Thailand has long taken a \r\npeople-centred approach and adheres to the \r\nsufficiency-economy philosophy of His Majesty King \r\nBhumibol Adulyadej, which focuses on living in \r\nmoderation and striking a balance between economic \r\ngrowth and the sustainable management of natural \r\nresources. \r\n Our Government is also working resolutely to \r\nensure, among other things, equal opportunity for all, \r\nfree primary and secondary education, and universal \r\nhealth care coverage. Although we have achieved most \r\nof the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) ahead \r\nof schedule, we are resolutely pursuing the MDG Plus \r\ntargets. In the greater scheme of things, we are \r\ndetermined that no one in Thai society should be left \r\nbehind. \r\n In order for sustainable development to be \r\nrealized, cooperation among all sectors of society and \r\npartnerships with the international community are \r\nessential. Thailand has been active in promoting \r\npartnerships between developed and developing \r\ncountries, and stands ready to serve as a bridge \r\nbetween both groups through triangular cooperation. At \r\nthe same time, we will continue to strengthen South-\r\nSouth cooperation with our fellow developing \r\ncountries, including those in the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement and the Group of 77 and China. \r\n Thailand has also assumed a more creative and \r\nproactive role in cooperation with the international \r\ncommunity in various development areas. Over the \r\nyears, relations between the United Nations and \r\nA/66/PV.28  \r\n \r\n11-51670 36 \r\n \r\nThailand have evolved from a traditional donor-\r\nrecipient relationship to one of partners in \r\ndevelopment. \r\n Neither development nor peace and security can \r\nbe sustainable if respect for human rights lags behind. \r\nThailand firmly believes that human rights represent \r\ntruly universal values. Respect for them must be a \r\nfundamental principle in every society. For Thailand, \r\nhuman rights issues are at the core of our domestic and \r\nforeign policy agendas. In terms of foreign policy, \r\nThailand has striven to play a constructive role at the \r\nregional and international levels, especially through \r\nour membership of the Human Rights Council. During \r\nour presidency of the Council, Thailand was proud to \r\ndirect the crucial task of reviewing its methods of work \r\nand operations in order to make it more relevant and \r\ncredible. This was particularly important when it came \r\nto responding to urgent human rights situations in a \r\nmore timely and effective manner. \r\n Every Government must find its own solutions \r\nand move at its own pace in a manner appropriate to its \r\nspecific context and conditions. Meanwhile, it is \r\nincumbent on the international community to support \r\nand promote constructive dialogue and engagement \r\nwith countries of concern, while respecting their \r\nsovereignty, territorial integrity and the will of the \r\npeople. Such support and dialogue should aim at \r\nstrengthening States’ capacity to meet their human \r\nrights obligations. Here it is important, in Thailand’s \r\nview, to find common ground on the value of technical \r\ncooperation in enhancing human rights. We have been \r\nholding consultations on an initiative to enhance the \r\nefficiency of the Human Rights Council in providing \r\ntechnical cooperation to countries in need. Thailand \r\nhopes that this initiative will receive the broad-based \r\nsupport of countries from all regions in the Council. \r\n With our genuine commitment to the promotion \r\nand protection of human rights, Thailand is determined \r\nto continue playing a constructive role in the Council. \r\nIn that regard, we will proudly stand for election once \r\nagain for the 2015-2017 term. As Thailand continues to \r\nenhance its participation as a member of the Human \r\nRights Council, we are determined to further contribute \r\nto human rights work and to strengthen the rights of \r\nvulnerable groups, both at home and abroad. We attach \r\nspecial importance to such groups, be they children, \r\nwomen, people with disabilities or the elderly.  \r\n One notable example is in the area of women’s \r\nrights. In December 2010, the General Assembly \r\nadopted the United Nations Rules for the Treatment of \r\nWomen Prisoners and Non-custodial Measures for \r\nWomen Offenders, or the Bangkok Rules (resolution \r\n65/229), based on an initiative of Her Royal Highness \r\nPrincess Bajrakitiyabha. The Rules aim to enhance the \r\nhuman rights of female prisoners in criminal justice \r\nsystems by fully recognizing gender sensitivity and the \r\nspecific needs of women. Thailand is committed to \r\npromoting the implementation of the Bangkok Rules \r\nworldwide and looks forward to continuing to work \r\nclosely with all relevant stakeholders. Moreover, the \r\nrecent election of the country’s first female Prime \r\nMinister confirms that Thai society is open to women \r\nand that we continue to promote gender equality and \r\nthe empowerment of women. \r\n It should be evident from all I have said that the \r\nUnited Nations is a cornerstone of Thailand’s foreign \r\npolicy, and that Thailand has been an active player in \r\nall three pillars of the United Nations. Peace and \r\nsecurity, development and human rights are truly \r\ninseparable and should be strengthened simultaneously. \r\nGiven our past experience and continued contributions \r\nto all three, especially the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security, Thailand has presented its \r\ncandidature for a non-permanent seat on the Security \r\nCouncil for the 2017-2018 term. We seek the support \r\nof our friends in the United Nations in this regard. We \r\nare convinced that such a position would enable us to \r\nfulfil our commitment to work closely and \r\nconstructively with all Members of the United Nations. \r\nLet us rise to the challenge together. \r\n The President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Nassirou Bako Arifari, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs, African Integration, Francophonie and \r\nBeninese Abroad of the Republic of Benin. \r\n Mr. Bako Arifari (Benin) (spoke in French): I \r\nshould like at the outset to convey to you, Sir, my \r\nheartfelt and sincere congratulations on your well-\r\ndeserved election as President of the General Assembly \r\nat its sixty-sixth session and to wish you every success \r\nin discharging your mandate.  \r\n I should like also to reiterate my heartfelt \r\ncongratulations to Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his \r\nreappointment as Secretary-General. I assure him of \r\nthe full cooperation of the Government of Benin and \r\nthe personal support of its Head of State in the vast \r\n A/66/PV.28\r\n \r\n37 11-51670 \r\n \r\nundertaking that is the modernization of the United \r\nNations, which he has been working towards since he \r\ntook the helm of the Organization.  \r\n I should like also to pay a well-deserved tribute \r\nto Mr. Joseph Deiss for the outstanding manner in \r\nwhich he carried out his mission as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. \r\n I should like to commend the selection of the \r\ntheme of the sixty-sixth session, “The role of mediation \r\nin the peaceful settlement of disputes”. This reflects a \r\nrecognition of the importance of dialogue and of the \r\nresponsibility of third parties in the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security. \r\n Conflicts, crises and wars represent a large part \r\nof the challenges faced by humankind. They undermine \r\npoorer States, whose efforts are often undone by \r\nindiscriminate violence, as deadly as it is destructive.  \r\n This legitimate interest in the use of mediation \r\nshould serve as a catalyst for raising the awareness of \r\nstakeholders in all regions of the world as to the need \r\nto accord greater importance to dialogue in resolving \r\nproblems, nationally and in the context of inter-State, \r\nbilateral, regional and international relations. \r\n We would therefore like to commend the \r\npartnership between the United Nations and the \r\nAfrican Union within the context of the special \r\npolitical missions, which are an optimum framework \r\nfor mediation. Such partnerships can help to avert \r\nredundancy and duplication, which can be counter-\r\nproductive and doom mediation efforts to failure. \r\n Benin, for its part, which owes much to dialogue, \r\nvery early on grasped the importance of that tool in the \r\nprevention and resolution of crises at the national level. \r\nIn that respect, I believe it appropriate here to draw the \r\nattention of the international community to the fact that \r\nthe Government of Benin has given high priority to the \r\nissue of mediation in its programme of action and, in \r\nthat context, established the Office of the Ombudsman. \r\nWe would also like to commend the creation, at the \r\nregional level, of the Association of Ombudsmen of \r\nMember Countries of the West African Economic and \r\nMonetary Union, which Benin chairs; indeed, most of \r\nthe countries in the Union are relying on this important \r\ntool for the maintenance of peace. \r\n Perhaps we should go even further and establish \r\ncivil entities for mediation and the restoration of peace, \r\nwhose members would meet with the parties to a \r\nconflict so as to re-establish dialogue among them and \r\nto prevail upon them to resolve their disputes \r\npeacefully. \r\n The current state of the world makes clear the \r\nurgent need to strengthen multilateralism, with a view \r\nto averting the collective collapse that could result if \r\nappropriate or consensual solutions are not rapidly \r\nfound to the global problems afflicting the world today. \r\nAt the national level, we require greater cohesion \r\namong the vital forces of the country and greater \r\ndetermination in the context of actions aimed at \r\neliminating the obstacles that impede development. \r\nWith respect to preserving democratic institutions, \r\nwhen the fundamental values enshrined in the Charter \r\nare at stake, the United Nations must be at the forefront \r\nof the efforts of the international community. \r\n In that regard, impartiality cannot be synonymous \r\nwith neutrality, which would be unfathomable and \r\nmake the United Nations a passive bystander to the \r\ntriumph of aggression over the rule of law. I should \r\ntherefore like to thank the Secretary-General for the \r\ncourageous choices he has made.  \r\n In Benin, democracy has been strengthened by \r\nthe tireless commitment of the United Nations to \r\nensuring electoral transparency, which it accomplished \r\nthrough its support for the creation of a computerized \r\npermanent voters’ list, which prevents any \r\nmanipulation or other fraudulent manoeuvres and \r\nthereby ensures fairness in our country’s elections. \r\n Based on the success of our young democracy in \r\nBenin, my Government has been working to \r\nconsolidate cooperative governance at both the \r\nnational and local levels, so as to maximize the impact \r\nof the resources that have been mobilized and \r\nearmarked for the promotion of the well-being of all \r\nthe citizens of our country. Accordingly, far-reaching \r\nreforms have been undertaken to reorganize the State \r\nand rid the country of the structural and behavioural \r\nincoherence that has impeded the State in its efforts to \r\ngovern effectively. \r\n The strengthening of democratic institutions and \r\na fresh balance of powers is at the very heart of the \r\nconstitutional review that is under discussion. Such a \r\nreview must in no way affect the principal mechanisms \r\nthat ensure the alternance of power, that is, the number \r\nof terms allowed the President of the Republic — \r\nstrictly limited to two — and the age limitation of \r\nA/66/PV.28  \r\n \r\n11-51670 38 \r\n \r\n70 years, beyond which one cannot run for the highest \r\noffice in Benin. \r\n The fight against corruption is a crucial aspect of \r\nthat effort to streamline the State apparatus. The \r\nadoption in late August 2011 of a new law to fight \r\ncorruption is in keeping with the national dynamic of \r\nensuring transparency in the management of the State’s \r\nresources and in the resolute fight undertaken against \r\nany practices that deny citizens the ability fully to \r\nenjoy the fruits of their labour. That new law enables \r\nus to better combat the various forms of illicit \r\nenrichment, as today it is up to the accused to justify \r\nthe source of his wealth, not the accuser. This is a \r\nrevolutionary development in the context Benin’s \r\njudicial and legislative mechanisms. \r\n At the global level, we believe in the benefits of \r\nmultilateralism. That is why we see an ever greater \r\nneed for the United Nations, which should be given a \r\nmore assertive role in global governance — a United \r\nNations that would spearhead and lead of actions \r\naimed at promoting, within an inclusive framework, \r\ncomprehensive and sustainable solutions to the \r\nmanifold crises that are affecting the world and having \r\ndirect repercussions for human rights.  \r\n Our Government, throughout its term in the \r\nHuman Rights Council, intends, together with other \r\nmembers of the Council, to work to promote and \r\nprotect universally recognized human rights, in a spirit \r\nof cooperation. Benin firmly believes in the \r\nuniversality, the indivisibility and the interdependence \r\nof all human rights. It has faith in international \r\ncooperation as the most effective means for promoting \r\nand protecting all universally recognized human rights. \r\n Let us recognize the ongoing efforts made in past \r\nyears by each of our countries, and collectively through \r\ninternational organizations both regional and universal, \r\nto manage the consequences of the various crises that \r\naffect the world, particularly developing countries — \r\nfood, energy, financial, economic and environmental \r\ncrises.  \r\n However, the international economic situation \r\nremains sluggish and uncertain. Indeed, the long-\r\nawaited international economic recovery remains slow \r\nand tenuous, while financial and stock market \r\nturbulence continues to affect the international market. \r\n Even today, more than two thirds of the \r\n800 million people in the least developed countries \r\n(LDCs) are living in poverty. The economic indicators \r\nof those nations — which have made prodigious efforts \r\nand heavy sacrifices to emerge from underdevelopment — \r\ncall for great prudence with regard to attaining the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015. \r\n Despite that rather bleak picture, we should \r\ncontinue our efforts to ensure that our countries can \r\nmake progress in the spheres of good governance, \r\ndevelopment, health, water, sanitation, primary \r\neducation for all and the empowerment of women and \r\nyouth. \r\n The developing countries, particularly the LDCs, \r\nneed more than ever the transfer of modern technology \r\nto increase and diversify production, take a greater part \r\nin international trade and build the infrastructure \r\nrequired for development. The developed countries and \r\nthe countries of the South that are experiencing \r\nsignificant economic growth should establish facilities \r\nto that end, as was agreed at the Fourth United Nations \r\nConference on the Least Developed Countries, held in \r\nIstanbul from 9 to 13 May 2011. The new programme \r\nof action adopted at that Conference clearly reflects \r\nour shared ambition to ensure that half those countries \r\nmove to the category of middle-income nations by \r\n2020.  \r\n But however noble the goals set forth in the \r\nIstanbul Programme of Action may be, they cannot be \r\nachieved unless we respect the commitments already \r\nmade. For that reason, despite the cyclical difficulties \r\nthat characterize the current global economic situation, \r\nwe must remain firm in our resolve to move forward.  \r\n There is no stable financial support for the \r\ndevelopment efforts of the LDCs without stable \r\nsources of financing. Therefore the Government of \r\nBenin strongly supports the innovative financing \r\ninitiative for development. We call on the nations of \r\nthe Group of 20 to take a closer look at that initiative \r\nso that taxation of financial transactions becomes a \r\ntangible reality during the weeks and months to come. \r\n Threats related to climate change — particularly \r\nthe continuing deterioration of the environment and \r\ndrought, a source of famine in some parts of Africa — \r\nand the recurrence of natural disasters greatly \r\nundermine the future prospects of the LDCs.  \r\n Benin commends the United Nations preparatory \r\nwork for the Rio+20 Summit planned for Brazil in June \r\n2012. We hope those meetings will lead to robust \r\n A/66/PV.28\r\n \r\n39 11-51670 \r\n \r\nmeasures and decisions that match the perils that await \r\nus. \r\n The threats that curtail our ambitions stem from \r\nother factors as well, such as the surge in transnational \r\norganized crime, which is quite pernicious. My \r\ncountry, Benin, has in recent months been the target of \r\nextremely serious and savage acts of piracy, armed \r\nrobbery at sea and an influx of narcotics and \r\ncounterfeit medicines. This scourge has not spared \r\nother countries of the Gulf of Guinea, which have also \r\nbeen affected to varying degrees. We are particularly \r\ndistressed not only by the escalating number of such \r\nattacks and the increasingly sophisticated methods the \r\npirates employ, but also and especially by the \r\nexpansion of their field of action and the immediate \r\neffect of these attacks on port activities in Benin. \r\n That situation complicates Benin’s efforts to find \r\nthe resources to handle the economic and financial \r\ndifficulties related to external shocks, the repercussions \r\nof which severely impact the economy of small \r\ncountries like ours. It also seriously hampers our \r\nability to achieve the MDGs. The Government of \r\nBenin is working with our neighbour Nigeria to \r\nmobilize the countries of the Gulf of Guinea subregion \r\nfor a coordinated response by developing and \r\nimplementing a regional approach that involves joint \r\nmanoeuvres to be launched shortly by the armed forces \r\nof Benin and Nigeria along the coast of Benin. \r\n I call for the effective solidarity of States with \r\nexpertise in the area of maritime operations to come to \r\nour assistance. Our resources are laughable, given the \r\nmagnitude of the threat. Clearly, the fight against \r\npiracy requires technical and financial resources that a \r\ndeveloping State cannot provide alone. Here I would \r\nlike to thank the United States, France, China and other \r\ncountries that have already shown spontaneous \r\nsolidarity toward Benin. \r\n The matters to which we need to find solutions \r\ngrow ever more complex. The United Nations must \r\ncontinually improve its ability to closely define the \r\nchallenges facing humanity and to help States \r\nformulate appropriate responses while preserving the \r\ndelicate balance of interests of all stakeholders, as \r\nevidence of its efficiency and efficacy.  \r\n Along these lines, the negotiations to reform the \r\nSecurity Council must be intensified with the adoption \r\nof a specific timetable for their outcome, to be \r\ncredible. My sense is that 2015 could be considered a \r\ndeadline for completing negotiations and establishing \r\nan inclusive Security Council that would redress the \r\nhistorical injustice done to Africa with respect to its \r\npermanent representation in that body, which crowns \r\nthe collective security system established by the United \r\nNations Charter.  \r\n Benin says no, no, and a third time no. The time \r\nhas come to put an end to an intolerable injustice that \r\nexcludes an entire continent — the only one, Africa — \r\nfrom the supreme decision-making body with respect \r\nto international security.  \r\n I am certain that completion of Security Council \r\nreform will lead to greater trust and less suspicion in \r\nthe management of today’s great challenges in the \r\nrealm of international peace and security. \r\n My country has always advocated strengthening \r\nconflict prevention as a means to ensure international \r\npeace and security at less cost. Efforts to that end must \r\nbe tirelessly pursued.  \r\n Prevention also includes effectively supporting \r\nyoung people to prepare them for their responsibilities, \r\nprotect them from the risks they face and channel their \r\nenergies towards participation in the development of \r\ntheir countries. We need to remove the obstacles that \r\ndeter or prevent them from fulfilling their potential and \r\ndivert them to risky behaviour of all kinds that harm \r\npublic order and the stability of States.  \r\n That is why my Government was firmly \r\ncommitted to the holding of the United Nations High-\r\nlevel Meeting on Youth. Now that it has taken place, \r\nwe need to do our utmost to ensure that its conclusions \r\non youth are translated into specific actions as soon as \r\npossible. The great interest in that High-level Meeting \r\nshown by young people around the world reflects their \r\nwill to become more involved in the search for \r\nappropriate solutions to the challenges facing \r\nhumankind.  \r\n The Government of my country also believes that \r\nit would be useful for the United Nations to hold youth \r\nhearings every year, or every other year, to enable \r\nyouth from around the world to address a specific \r\nsubject, with broad participation of young delegates \r\nand young leaders of non-governmental organizations. \r\nSuch regular mobilization of the world’s young people \r\nin the heart of the United Nations would make our \r\nworld Organization more inclusive and closer to our \r\npeoples.  \r\nA/66/PV.28  \r\n \r\n11-51670 40 \r\n \r\n For us in Benin — and I quote the President of \r\nthe Republic, Mr. Boni Yayi — “there is no doubt that \r\nonly those societies that give young people \r\nopportunities will be able to meet the challenges to \r\ncome”. \r\n From 16 to 20 November 2010, Benin hosted an \r\ninternational symposium on the fiftieth anniversary of \r\nthe independence of African countries. That meeting \r\nculminated in the drafting of an important historic \r\ndocument entitled “The Fiftieth Anniversary \r\nManifesto”. The African Union, at its most recent \r\nsummit, held in Malabo on 30 June and 1 July, adopted \r\nthe Manifesto as a reference document for the \r\nrenaissance of the African continent.  \r\n The Anniversary Manifesto details, in the context \r\nof globalization, felicitous prospects with regard the \r\nchallenges facing Africa in the coming 50 years, which \r\nwill require new partnership approaches to promote \r\ndevelopment and more effective collective action for \r\nthe renaissance of the continent. I firmly hope that the \r\nManifesto will be taken to heart equally by the United \r\nNations and lead to synergy and better coordination of \r\nefforts to mobilize the international community for the \r\neconomic development of African countries so as to \r\nmeet the legitimate aspirations of the people of the \r\ncontinent. \r\n In conclusion, I want to note that recent history \r\nteaches us that the greatest threats to international \r\npeace and security come from peoples who have long \r\nbeen frustrated. The Palestinian question makes the \r\nArab nation a frustrated nation. The United Nations \r\ntoday has the means to find a just and lasting solution \r\nto the Palestinian problem, and it must not fail to meet \r\nits historic responsibility.  \r\n We support a free and independent Palestinian \r\nState living in peaceful coexistence with the State of \r\nIsrael. Benin gives ongoing support to the one-land, \r\ntwo-State solution and calls upon the Security Council \r\nto facilitate the prompt resolution of the problem, to \r\nbring relief to the Palestinian people, who endure daily \r\nsuffering.  \r\n We believe in the virtue of mediation. The choice \r\nof that option as a way to resolve conflicts around the \r\nworld in this sixty-sixth session of the Assembly offers \r\na last chance for the two parties to re-engage in \r\ndialogue to finally bring lasting peace to the Middle \r\nEast and to the world. The peace that we all so wish for \r\nmust be based on universal respect for the cardinal \r\nprinciples and fundamental values contained in the \r\nUnited Nations Charter.  \r\n The President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nArchbishop Dominique Mamberti, Secretary for \r\nRelations with States of the Observer State of the Holy \r\nSee. \r\n Archbishop Mamberti (Holy See) (spoke in \r\nFrench): I have the pleasure of congratulating you, Sir, \r\non your election to the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-sixth session. I assure you of the \r\nfull and sincere collaboration of the Holy See. I also \r\ncongratulate the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, \r\nwho during this session, on 1 January 2012, will begin \r\nhis second term.  \r\n I would also like to cordially welcome the \r\ndelegation of South Sudan, which became the \r\n193rd Member State of the Organization last July. \r\n Every year, the general debate offers the \r\nopportunity to address the principal questions that \r\nconcern humanity in search of a better future for all. \r\nThe challenges facing the international community are \r\nmany and difficult. They bring ever more clearly in \r\nfocus the profound interdependence within the family \r\nof nations, which sees in the United Nations an \r\nimportant agent, despite its limitations, for identifying \r\nand implementing solutions to major international \r\nproblems.  \r\n Without attempting an exhaustive survey, my \r\ndelegation wishes to reflect on a few of the priority \r\nchallenges so that the concept of the family of nations \r\ncan increasingly take shape. \r\n The first challenge is a humanitarian one. It calls \r\nthe whole international community — or better, the \r\nfamily of nations — to look after its weakest members. \r\nIn certain parts of the world, such as the Horn of \r\nAfrica, we are, sadly, facing grave humanitarian \r\nemergencies that force millions of people — the \r\nmajority women and children — to leave their homes, \r\nlarge numbers of them being victims of drought, \r\nfamine and malnutrition.  \r\n The Holy See renews its appeal to the \r\ninternational community, expressed many times by \r\nPope Benedict XVI, to amplify and support \r\nhumanitarian policies in those areas and to work to \r\nconcretely address the various factors that amplify \r\ntheir vulnerability. \r\n A/66/PV.28\r\n \r\n41 11-51670 \r\n \r\n These humanitarian emergencies make clear the \r\nneed to find innovative ways to put to work the \r\nprinciple of the responsibility to protect, at the base of \r\nwhich is the recognition of the unity of the human \r\nfamily and the innate dignity of every man and every \r\nwoman. As is known, that principle points to the \r\nresponsibility of the international community to \r\nintervene in situations in which Governments on their \r\nown cannot — or do not wish to — comply with their \r\nprimary responsibility to protect their populations \r\nagainst grave violations of human rights and the effects \r\nof humanitarian crises. If States are no longer capable \r\nof guaranteeing that protection, the international \r\ncommunity must intervene with the juridical means \r\nforeseen in the United Nations Charter and other \r\ninternational instruments. \r\n However, it must be recalled that there is a risk \r\nthat that principle may be invoked in certain \r\ncircumstances as a pretext to use military force. It is \r\ngood to recall that even the use of force in keeping \r\nwith the United Nations rules should be a temporary \r\nsolution, a true emergency measure, accompanied and \r\nfollowed by a concrete commitment to pacification. \r\n For that reason, in taking up the challenge of the \r\nresponsibility to protect, we must engage in a deeper \r\nsearch for the means to prevent and manage conflicts, \r\nexploring all possible diplomatic avenues through \r\nnegotiation and constructive dialogue, noting and \r\nencouraging even the weakest signs of willingness to \r\nnegotiate or desire for reconciliation on the part of the \r\nparties involved. \r\n The responsibility to protect must be thought of \r\nnot as military intervention alone — which should \r\nalways be the last recourse — but above all as a \r\nrequirement that the international community be united \r\nin facing crises. It must create forums for genuine, \r\nsincere negotiations, support the moral force of law, \r\nseek the common good and encourage Governments, \r\ncivil society and public opinion to find the causes of \r\nand offer solutions to crises of all kinds. I must act in \r\nclose collaboration and solidarity with the affected \r\npopulations and place above all else the integrity and \r\nsecurity of all citizens.  \r\n It is therefore important that the responsibility to \r\nprotect, understood in that sense, should be the \r\ncriterion and motivation that underlies all the work of \r\nStates and of the United Nations to restore peace, \r\nsecurity and the human rights. Moreover, the long and \r\ngenerally successful history of peacekeeping \r\noperations and the more recent initiatives in \r\npeacebuilding can offer valuable lessons for conceiving \r\nmodels for implementing the responsibility to protect \r\nin full respect for international law and for the \r\nlegitimate interests of all the parties involved. \r\n Respect for freedom of religion is a fundamental \r\nfactor in peacebuilding, the recognition of human \r\ndignity and the safeguarding of the human rights. This \r\nis the second challenge I would like to reflect on. \r\n The situations in which the right to freedom of \r\nreligion is violated or is denied to believers of different \r\nreligions are unfortunately many. We have witnessed \r\nrising intolerance for religious reasons. Christians are \r\nthe religious group that currently suffers the greatest \r\npersecution because of their faith.  \r\n The lack of respect for freedom of religion \r\nthreatens security and peace and hinders authentic \r\nintegral human development. The particular weight of \r\na given religion in a nation should never mean that \r\ncitizens of other faiths are discriminated against in \r\nsocial life or, worse still, that violence against them is \r\ntolerated. In that connection, it is important that a \r\ncommon commitment to recognize and promote the \r\nreligious freedom of every person and every \r\ncommunity be promoted by engaging in sincere \r\ninterreligious dialogue, encouraged and supported by \r\nGovernments and international bodies.  \r\n I reiterate the concerned appeal made by the Holy \r\nSee to authorities and religious leaders to adopt \r\neffective measures for the protection of religious \r\nminorities, wherever they are threatened. In that way, \r\nbelievers of all faiths everywhere will be able to live in \r\nsecurity and continue to make a contribution to their \r\nsociety.  \r\n In thinking about the situation in some countries, \r\nI would like to repeat in particular that Christians are \r\ncitizens like any other citizens, connected to their \r\nhomeland and faithful to all of their national duties. It \r\nis natural that they should enjoy all the rights of \r\ncitizenship, freedom of conscience and worship, \r\nfreedom in teaching and education and freedom in the \r\nuse of communications media. \r\n Moreover, in some countries, although much \r\nimportance is placed on pluralism and tolerance, \r\nparadoxically there is a tendency to consider religion \r\nas something foreign to modern society or even as a \r\nA/66/PV.28  \r\n \r\n11-51670 42 \r\n \r\ndestabilizing force. Various means are sought to \r\nmarginalize religion and prevent it from having any \r\ninfluence on social life.  \r\n But how can anyone deny the contribution of the \r\nworld’s great religions to the development of \r\ncivilization? As Pope Benedict XVI stressed, the \r\nsincere search for God has led to greater respect for \r\nhuman dignity. For example, Christian communities, \r\nwith their heritage of values and principles, have \r\ncontributed much to making individuals and peoples \r\naware of their own identity and their dignity, as well as \r\nto the establishment of rule-of-law institutions and the \r\nrecognition of human rights and their corresponding \r\nresponsibilities. From that standpoint, it is important \r\nthat believers, today as yesterday, feel free to offer \r\ntheir contribution to the promotion of a more just \r\nhuman order, not only through their responsible \r\ninvolvement in civic, economic and political life, but \r\nalso through the witness of their charity and faith. \r\n A third challenge that the Holy See would like to \r\nbring to the attention of the Assembly is the continuing \r\nglobal economic and financial crisis.  \r\n We all know that a fundamental element of the \r\ncurrent crisis is the deficit in ethics in the economic \r\nstructures. Ethics are not an external element of the \r\neconomy; the economy has no future if it has no moral \r\nelement. In other words, the ethical dimension is \r\nessential in addressing economic problems. The \r\neconomy does not function only through market self-\r\nregulation, and even less through agreements that are \r\nlimited to accommodating the interests of the most \r\npowerful.  \r\n The economy needs an ethical raison d’être in \r\norder to work for humankind. The notion of producing \r\nresources and goods — that is, the economy — and of \r\nmanaging them strategically — that is, politics — \r\nwithout seeking to do good through those same acts — \r\nthat is, without ethics — has proven to be a naïve or \r\ncynical illusion, and always fatal. Moreover, every \r\neconomic decision has a moral consequence.  \r\n The economy therefore needs ethics to function \r\nproperly — not just any ethic, but a people-centred \r\nethic that can offer prospects to new generations. \r\nEconomic and commercial activities oriented towards \r\ndevelopment should be able to effectively reduce \r\npoverty and alleviate the suffering of the most \r\ndisenfranchised.  \r\n In that regard, the Holy See encourages \r\nstrengthening official development assistance in \r\naccordance with the Group of Eight commitments \r\nmade at Gleneagles. My delegation hopes that the \r\ndebates on this theme at the forthcoming High-level \r\nDialogue on Financing for Development will bring the \r\nexpected results.  \r\n Furthermore, the Holy See has repeatedly \r\nstressed the importance of new and more in-depth \r\nthinking on the meaning of the economy and its \r\nobjectives, as well as a forward-looking review of the \r\nglobal trade and financial architecture to correct its \r\ndysfunctions and distortions. This review of \r\ninternational economic rules must form part of wider \r\nefforts to forge a new global development model. \r\nIndeed, the state of our planet’s environmental health, \r\nand above all the cultural and moral crisis of \r\nhumankind — the symptoms of which have been \r\nevident around the world for some time — demand \r\nthis. \r\n These considerations should also inspire the work \r\nof the forthcoming United Nations Conference on \r\nSustainable Development, to be held in June, on the \r\nconviction that “Human beings are at the centre of \r\nconcerns for sustainable development”, as stated in the \r\nPrinciple 1 of the 1992 Rio Declaration on Environment \r\nand Development.  \r\n The sense of environmental responsibility and \r\npreservation should be guided by our awareness of \r\nbeing a family of nations. The idea of “family” \r\nimmediately evokes something more than merely \r\nfunctional relationships or a simple convergence of \r\ninterests. A family is by nature a community based on \r\ninterdependence, mutual trust, mutual aid and sincere \r\nrespect. Its full development is based not on the \r\nsupremacy of the strongest, but on the attention paid to \r\nthe weakest and most marginalized, and its \r\nresponsibility extends to future generations. Respect \r\nfor the environment should make us more attuned to \r\nthe needs of the most disenfranchised. It should create \r\na development strategy centred on the individual that \r\npromotes solidarity and the shared responsibility of all, \r\nincluding future generations. \r\n This strategy can only benefit from the United \r\nNations Conference on the Arms Trade Treaty, planned \r\nfor 2012. An unregulated and non-transparent arms \r\ntrade has significant negative repercussions. It hampers \r\nintegral human development and heightens the risk of \r\n A/66/PV.28\r\n \r\n43 11-51670 \r\n \r\nconflicts, especially internal conflicts, and instability. \r\nIt fosters a culture of violence and impunity, which is \r\noften linked to such criminal activities as drug \r\ntrafficking, trafficking in human beings and piracy. \r\nThese are becoming ever more serious international \r\nproblems.  \r\n The results of the current arms trade treaty \r\nprocess will test the true willingness of States to \r\nassume their moral and legal responsibilities in that \r\nregard. The international community, conscious of the \r\ngreat numbers of people affected by the illegal trade in \r\narms and ammunition and aware of their suffering, \r\nmust focus on concluding an arms trade treaty that is \r\neffective and enforceable. Indeed, the primary \r\nobjective of the treaty should be not only to regulate \r\nthe trade in conventional arms and obstruct the black \r\nmarket, but also and most importantly to protect human \r\nlife and build a world more respectful of human \r\ndignity. \r\n Indeed, the United Nations’ contribution to \r\nbuilding a world more respectful of human dignity will \r\ndemonstrate its ability to effectively carry out its \r\nmission, which is to help the family of nations to \r\npursue the common objectives of peace, security and \r\nintegral development for all. \r\n The Holy See is also concerned about the events \r\nunfolding in some countries of North Africa and the \r\nMiddle East. I would like to take this opportunity to \r\nrenew the appeal made by the Holy Father Benedict \r\nXVI, who called on all citizens, particularly young \r\npeople, to do their utmost to promote the common \r\ngood and build societies in which poverty is overcome, \r\nin which every political choice is inspired by respect \r\nfor human beings and in which peace and harmony will \r\ntriumph over divisions, hatred and violence. \r\n A final observation concerns Palestine’s request \r\nfor recognition as a Member State of the United \r\nNations, made here on 23 September by the President \r\nof the Palestinian National Authority, Mr. Mahmoud \r\nAbbas. The Holy See views this initiative as an attempt \r\nto find a definitive solution, with the support of the \r\ninternational community, to the question already \r\naddressed by the General Assembly in its resolution \r\n181 (II) of 29 November 1947. That fundamental \r\ndocument sets down the legal framework for the \r\nexistence of two States. One of them has already been \r\nborn, while the other has not yet been established, \r\nalthough nearly 65 years have passed. \r\n The Holy See is convinced that if one desires \r\npeace, brave decisions must be taken. It hopes that the \r\ncompetent bodies of the United Nations are resolved to \r\nhelp effectively implement the final objective, that is, \r\nachieving the Palestinians’ right to have their own \r\nindependent and sovereign State and the Israelis’ right \r\nto security, both States with internationally recognized \r\nborders.  \r\n The response of the United Nations, whatever it \r\nmay be, will not be a complete solution. Lasting peace \r\ncan be achieved only through good-faith negotiations \r\nbetween Israelis and Palestinians, avoiding actions or \r\nconditions that contradict declarations of goodwill. The \r\nHoly See therefore urges the parties to return to \r\nnegotiations with resolve. It urgently appeals to the \r\ninternational community to increase its commitment \r\nand stimulate its creativity and initiatives in order to \r\nreach a lasting peace, in respect for the rights of the \r\nIsraelis and the Palestinians. \r\n The President: As representatives are aware, this \r\nafternoon the General Assembly will conclude its \r\ndeliberations on agenda item 8, “General debate”. It is \r\nmy intention to present some concluding remarks at the \r\nend of that meeting.  \r\n  The meeting rose at 1.30 p.m. \r\n"
