(Qatar) \r\n \r\n \r\n  In the absence of The President, Mr. Thomson \r\n(Fiji), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 6.20 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 8 (continued) \r\n \r\nGeneral debate \r\n \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Libran Cabactulan, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of the Philippines. \r\n Mr. Cabactulan (Philippines): Allow me at the \r\noutset to congratulate Ambassador Nassir Abdulaziz \r\nAl-Nasser on his election and to offer the Philippines’ \r\nfull support for his leadership in this sixty-sixth session \r\nof the General Assembly. \r\n Our collective experience as one United Nations \r\nhas brought into focus the reality that only when \r\nnations work together in firm and determined resolve \r\ncan we begin to address the many difficulties that \r\nconfront us. Two global wars exposed our vulnerability \r\nto leaders and nations that do not hesitate to use \r\nviolence to resolve disputes and underscored the need \r\nfor an international system to govern the behaviour of \r\nStates. \r\n That is the rules-based framework that underpins \r\neverything we want to build, raise and do as one \r\nUnited Nations. That framework — built on our shared \r\nvalues and common aspirations — provides the way by \r\nwhich we can effectively move together as one global \r\ncommunity towards our common objectives. For the \r\nPhilippines, therefore, this session’s theme — “The \r\nrole of mediation in the settlement of disputes by \r\npeaceful means” — is most relevant and opportune.  \r\n A rules-based system will work in a sustained \r\nmanner only if the rules themselves are based on \r\nprinciples of justice and equity. Recent events across \r\nthe globe, particularly in the Middle East, have shown \r\nus that individuals rise together for what they believe is \r\njust and equitable. Individuals clamour for the rule of \r\nlaw based on equity and fairness. When they realize the \r\ninjustice of repressive and iniquitous rule, they do not \r\nhesitate to bring effective and positive change.  \r\n We must continue to work to eliminate nuclear \r\nweapons and curtail the illicit trade in conventional \r\nweapons and in small and light arms in order to \r\npreserve peace and our very existence. The successful \r\n2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on \r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons showed the \r\ncollective resolve of States parties to move further \r\nforward in ridding the world of those weapons. We \r\nhave already agreed to convene a conference by 2012 \r\non the establishment of a Middle East zone free of \r\nnuclear weapons and other weapons of mass \r\ndestruction. The holding of that conference will take us \r\ncloser to our goal.  \r\n To build peace, we need to provide and \r\nstrengthen conditions that encourage the full progress \r\nand prosperity of all nations and peoples. We must \r\nensure that international trade and development \r\nsupport that end. The Philippines therefore calls for a \r\nfair, open and rules-based multilateral trading system \r\nA/66/PV.30  \r\n \r\n11-51687 2 \r\n \r\nand the conclusion of the Doha Round. We must \r\nlikewise redouble our efforts to achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. The target date of \r\n2015 is upon us and much work remains to be done. \r\n Mr. Archondo (Bolivia), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n The Philippines is one of world’s 17 mega-\r\ndiverse countries and has a great stake in ensuring that \r\nglobal biodiversity is protected and maintained. We \r\nhave been described as the epicentre of global marine \r\nbiodiversity, and we host the Association of Southeast \r\nAsian Nations (ASEAN) Center for Biodiversity. As \r\nwe look forward to the United Nations Conference on \r\nSustainable Development next year, we join the call for \r\na more powerful expression of the entire world’s \r\npolitical commitment to sustainable development. \r\n With the human person at the core of all our \r\nefforts, we must always strive to uphold human dignity \r\nand human rights. That holds true for migrant workers. \r\nThe Philippines has close to 10 million Filipinos \r\noverseas, contributing to global socio-economic \r\ndevelopment. In line with the rules-based approach, the \r\nPhilippines supports the establishment of guidelines \r\nthat would ensure the welfare of all migrant workers. \r\n Additionally, we must renew our resolve to \r\naddress the evils of human trafficking. The Philippines \r\nis a founding member of the Group of Friends United \r\nagainst Human Trafficking, an informal association of \r\nUnited Nations Member States that seeks to help \r\nreinvigorate and consolidate the global fight against \r\ntrafficking in persons. At the core of the initiative is the \r\nimplementation of the United Nations Global Plan of \r\nAction to Combat Trafficking in Persons. \r\n Aside from establishing rules to protect migrant \r\nworkers and to prevent human trafficking, the global \r\ncommunity needs to explore measures to more \r\neffectively assist developing countries in evacuating \r\ntheir nationals in instances of disaster or internal \r\nconflict. The Philippines also supports efforts at the \r\nUnited Nations to enhance partnerships, including with \r\nprivate sector actors, in strengthening the international \r\nhumanitarian and emergency response system. \r\n The Philippines recognizes that the promotion \r\nand protection of human rights are of vital importance \r\nto securing peace and socio-economic development, \r\npromoting the rule of law and strengthening \r\ndemocracies. The Philippines Government likewise \r\nrecognizes women as agents of socio-economic growth \r\nand change, and thus strongly advocates their full \r\nparticipation in nation-building. \r\n The Philippines is pleased to announce that, on \r\n30 August, we deposited our instrument of ratification \r\nof the Rome Statute of the International Criminal \r\nCourt. This was an historic moment for my country and \r\nmy people. We have stood up against the impunity of \r\ncolonial rule and of a dictatorship. Now, we stand \r\ntogether with the rest of the world in saying “never \r\nagain” to impunity in any corner of our world. \r\n Firm in the desire to contribute to global efforts \r\nto safeguard the world against impunity, the \r\nPhilippines has fielded a candidate for election to the \r\nCourt, Ms. Miriam Defensor-Santiago, an experienced \r\ntrial judge and international legal scholar with a \r\ndistinguished and long career in public service. We ask \r\nall our partners and friends to support her candidature. \r\n As we look to strengthen the ramparts of peace, \r\nwe recognize the important role and contributions of \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping and peacebuilding. The \r\nPhilippines stands ready to do its part to ensure that the \r\nlines of peace are fortified and continuously expanded. \r\nThe Philippines lauds the heightened interaction and \r\ndialogue among the Secretariat, the General Assembly, \r\nthe Security Council, troop- and police-contributing \r\ncountries and other key stakeholders in the global \r\npeacekeeping agenda. \r\n As we strive to reinforce peacekeeping operations \r\non land, so too should we continue to exert efforts in \r\nmaintaining stability and security at sea. Maritime \r\npiracy, after all, imperils the lives of seafarers and \r\ndisrupts global trade. Today, around 70 Filipino \r\nseafarers are still being held hostage by pirates \r\noperating in the Gulf of Aden and the wider Indian \r\nOcean. We must continue to work diligently to counter \r\nthese sea pirates, who have no place in our modern, \r\ncivilized world.  \r\n To strengthen the international rules-based \r\nregime, the Philippines advocates reforming the United \r\nNations, particularly the Security Council, to make it \r\nmore resilient, relevant and responsive. The record \r\nshows that it is only the Philippines that has presented \r\nspecific drafts resolutions concretely setting forth \r\nproposals on the five key issues: categories of \r\nmembership, question of the veto, size of the enlarged \r\nSecurity Council and working methods, relationship \r\n A/66/PV.30\r\n \r\n3 11-51687 \r\n \r\nbetween the General Assembly and the Security \r\nCouncil, and the question of regional representation. \r\n Terrorism continues to cast its dark shadow on all \r\nof us. The decapitation of terrorist organizations has \r\nnot put an end to terrorism. We need to address the root \r\ncauses and conditions that turn individuals with so \r\nmuch passion into beasts that know nothing but \r\nviolence to achieve their ends. Among many things, we \r\nneed to further examine how economic \r\ndisenfranchisement, intolerance and radicalization \r\ncontribute to the growth of terrorist groups. \r\n The rule of law, including the 1982 United \r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), \r\nis the key to finding solutions to disputes over \r\nconflicting claims in the West Philippine Sea. As we \r\nprepare to commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of \r\nUNCLOS next year, let all States parties remember not \r\njust our rights, but also our obligations, for the rule of \r\nlaw is the bedrock on which the growth and \r\ndevelopment of our community of nations is built. \r\nAdherence to the rule of law provides stability and \r\ncertainty in the conduct of relations among States. In a \r\nworld defined by unequal distribution of economic, \r\nmilitary and political resources and might, the rule of \r\nlaw is the great equalizer, ensuring that rights are \r\nprotected and responsibilities complied with. \r\nAdherence to the rule of law prevents conflicts. In \r\ninstances of dispute, particularly of a territorial nature, \r\nthe rule of law ensures a peaceful settlement and \r\nresolution. \r\n The rule of law has guided the Philippines in all \r\nits actions as a responsible member of the international \r\ncommunity. The Philippines realizes that only when the \r\nrule of law prevails can all stakeholders and the world \r\nbenefit from a region of such importance strategically \r\nand in terms of resources. We adhere to ASEAN’s 1992 \r\nManila declaration on the West Philippine Sea and the \r\n2002 declaration on the conduct of parties in the West \r\nPhilippine Sea. We call on other parties to do so as \r\nwell. We also welcome the efforts and support of other \r\nstakeholders in working towards a lasting, just and \r\npeaceful solution to the conflicting claims in our \r\nregion.  \r\n Allow me to conclude by saying that \r\nunderpinning the success of all our efforts in the \r\nUnited Nations is adherence to the rule of law and a \r\nrules-based international system. Out of the horrors of \r\nwar, we have resolved as one global community to \r\nbuild and strengthen the ramparts of peace and \r\ndevelopment. Those ramparts, strong as they may be, \r\ncan easily disintegrate when even just one nation \r\nbehaves contrary to the rules and norms we have all \r\nagreed to abide by. It is our obligation as individual \r\nsovereigns States and as a collective global community \r\nthat all nations, large or small, behave responsibly \r\nthrough the adherence to the rule of law and a rules-\r\nbased regime. Only then can we hope to enjoy the \r\nbenefits of our world and live together in greater peace, \r\nprogress and prosperity. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Vince Henderson, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of the Commonwealth of Dominica. \r\n Mr. Henderson (Dominica): On behalf of my \r\ndelegation and the Government and the people of the \r\nCommonwealth of Dominica, I would like to \r\ncongratulate His Excellency Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz \r\nAl-Nasser on his assumption of the presidency of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-sixth session, and to \r\nassure him of our full cooperation. We are confident \r\nthat with his skills and experience, he will bring \r\nleadership to this Assembly as it addresses the \r\nextensive and important agenda of this sixty-sixth \r\nsession.  \r\n I also extend a special welcome to the newest \r\nmember of this Assembly, the Republic of South \r\nSudan, which became the 193rd Member of the United \r\nNations in July. \r\n I would also like to convey Dominica’s \r\nappreciation to Mr. Al-Nasser’s predecessor, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Joseph Deiss, for having so ably guided \r\nthe proceedings of the sixty-fifth session of the General \r\nAssembly. We also express our gratitude for the \r\ncontinued efforts of His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-Moon \r\nand for his leadership at this most challenging time. \r\n This meeting is being convened at a time of \r\ntremendous global insecurity. Never in the history of \r\nhumankind have we had to struggle for our own \r\nexistence as we have done in this past decade. We are \r\nstill faced with unstable global financial markets, \r\nissues of food availability and affordability, increasing \r\nunrest in some regions and the high cost of energy, and \r\nwe seem set to endure the mounting consequences of \r\nMother Earth’s response to decades of global warming. \r\n Countries like Dominica, located in the \r\nCaribbean Sea, are again in hurricane season, a period \r\nA/66/PV.30  \r\n \r\n11-51687 4 \r\n \r\nof high vulnerability that we in the Caribbean \r\nexperience for a period of four to six months each year. \r\nFresh in our minds are the recent unfortunate events \r\nthat took place in the eastern United States. For the \r\nfirst time in its recorded history, the city in which we \r\nare convened came to a complete standstill because of \r\nHurricane Irene in late August. \r\n We in the Caribbean understand clearly the \r\nchallenges faced in the aftermath of hurricanes, as \r\nthese are the kinds of disasters that small island States \r\nsuch as Dominica are forced to routinely schedule on \r\nour calendar of events and brace for every six months. \r\nFor us, each year’s recovery efforts could become next \r\nyear’s destruction point. On behalf of my delegation, I \r\nextend my condolences to and empathize with all those \r\nwho were affected by Hurricane Irene. \r\n For reasons such as these, each year we come \r\nbefore this Assembly to report on the deterioration not \r\nonly of the environment, but also of climate change \r\nnegotiations. With full knowledge that these impacts \r\nare projected to increase over time, we believe that we \r\ncan build on a number of outcomes agreed to in \r\nCancún. We also believe that although some responses \r\nmight not meet every Member State’s expectation, they \r\ncould act as catalysts and springboards for new \r\napproaches and new solutions in Durban. \r\n As witnesses to environmental degradation at a \r\ntime when reliance on the ecosystem to provide energy \r\nfor basic needs continues to intensify, we as a people \r\ncannot continue to ignore the subject of climate \r\nchange. We believe that climate change is an energy-\r\nrelated issue and that the provision of reliable, \r\naccessible and affordable energy and its by-products \r\nare critical to sustainable development and the \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals. \r\n Despite unfulfilled promises and a slow start to \r\nfast-start funding, we must report on actions advanced \r\nsince Cancún that have helped position the small island \r\ndeveloping States (SIDS) to transform their energy \r\nsectors. Specifically, I refer to the SIDS Sustainable \r\nEnergy Initiative, also known as SIDS DOCK.  \r\n Almost 30 SIDS have signed an agreement to \r\nestablish this initiative, created by the Alliance of \r\nSmall Island States (AOSIS) under the chairmanship of \r\nGrenada and in partnership with the Government of \r\nDenmark, the United Nations Development Programme \r\nand the World Bank. We wish to thank the Government \r\nof Denmark for its significant financial contribution to \r\noperationalizing this facility and for the leadership that \r\nit has given and continues to give to the process. My \r\ndelegation expresses its gratitude to the other members \r\nof AOSIS for staying the course and reaffirms \r\nDominica’s commitment to the initiative. \r\n SIDS DOCK was the outstanding outcome for \r\nSIDS at Cancún, and, as we set our sights on Durban, \r\nthe expectation is that other partners will support the \r\ninitiative, which is set to transform the energy sector in \r\nSIDS. It is our hope that sufficient progress will be \r\nmade in negotiating appropriate measures that might be \r\nimplemented to address the losses and damage \r\nassociated with the adverse effects of climate change, \r\nincluding impacts related to extreme weather as well as \r\nslow-onset events. \r\n These two initiatives are within the framework of \r\nthe Bali Road Map and Action Plan and reflect actions \r\nthat are geared towards the fulfilment of commitments \r\nand giving effect to the Cancún decisions. \r\n It is no secret that the Kyoto Protocol is in \r\nserious trouble. While it represents less than 30 per \r\ncent of greenhouse-gas emissions, it remains the only \r\nlegally binding global agreement in our quest to \r\naddress the growing threat of climate change. In order \r\nto build on the gains made under the first commitment \r\nperiod, we must ensure that the broad principles \r\nsecured in the Kyoto Protocol are maintained in any \r\nlegally binding global agreement at Durban. \r\n A sustainable energy sector is the foundation for \r\nsustainable development in small island States such as \r\nDominica. For the past decade, Dominica has been \r\nworking towards the development of our geothermal \r\npotential, with the assistance of international agencies \r\nand development partners. \r\n With the support and contribution of the \r\nEuropean Union, the Government of France and the \r\nRegional Councils of Guadeloupe and Martinique, we \r\nare now closer to the realization of our goal. \r\nPreparation for drilling has begun, and the three test \r\nwells will be complete by the end of 2011. \r\n The development of our geothermal potential will \r\nprovide us with the capacity to meet our domestic \r\nneeds and supply electricity to our neighbouring \r\nislands, especially the French territories of Guadeloupe \r\nand Martinique, through our connection via submarine \r\ncables. With this displacement of hundreds of \r\nmegawatts of fossil-generated power, coupled with our \r\n A/66/PV.30\r\n \r\n5 11-51687 \r\n \r\nsustainable development practices, Dominica’s target is \r\nto be not only carbon-neutral but also carbon-negative \r\nby the year 2020. \r\n Like Dominica, many SIDS are pursuing their \r\nown renewable-energy initiatives. However, \r\nunsustainable debt burdens and lack of technology \r\nhave made such initiatives almost impossible for some \r\nSIDS. We invite other developed countries and \r\ninternational institutions to join the Government of \r\nDenmark in SIDS DOCK and the Government of \r\nNorway in its “Energy for all” initiative, by providing \r\nthe critical support that SIDS so desperately need. \r\n We in the SIDS are committed to playing our \r\npart; suffice it to say, however, that there are still some \r\nmajor obstacles impeding the pace of progress, \r\nparticularly financing for SIDS-appropriate technology \r\nand transfer. As part of the United Nations Conference \r\non Sustainable Development (Rio+20) process, \r\nDominica calls on the Secretary-General to establish a \r\nspecial SIDS-appropriate technology fund to address \r\nthe issue of innovative financing for sustainable energy \r\ntechnology transfer and development for small island \r\nStates. In that regard, we also ask that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral consider appointing a goodwill ambassador \r\ntasked with advocating on behalf of SIDS and helping \r\nthe Secretary-General in supporting the Fund. The \r\neffective transfer and development of SIDS-appropriate \r\ntechnology is essential for SIDS to build resilience to \r\nthe present and future impacts of climate change. \r\n In addition to looking forward to securing a \r\nrenewed political commitment for sustainable \r\ndevelopment at Rio+20, the SIDS expect that the \r\ninternational community will reaffirm their support \r\nwith the new and additional resources required to \r\nimplement the programmes and activities agreed to, \r\nfrom Agenda 21 to the Barbados Programme of Action \r\nand the Mauritius Strategy for the further \r\nimplementation of the Barbados Programme of Action.  \r\n Any renewed commitments and agreements \r\nreached at Rio+20 must address the major impediments \r\nto implementing these summit outcomes, including the \r\nlimited technical, financial and human resources, as \r\nwell as the impact of exogenous factors, particularly \r\nthe global financial crisis. \r\n There is no denying the importance of national \r\nsecurity to a society; thus the unregulated, \r\nnon-standardized and highly dangerous trade in arms \r\nand ammunition poses great threats to law and order in \r\nour societies. The Caribbean region is not a \r\nmanufacturer of arms or ammunition, yet large \r\nquantities of illegal firearms and ammunition often \r\nassociated with the illegal drug trade are transferred \r\nacross our borders, infiltrating our society and causing \r\nmayhem and death, overburdening our health-care \r\nsystem and contributing to the destabilization of \r\neconomic progress and well-being. The region has lost \r\nsome of its most productive members to this \r\nunregulated transfer of arms. This is an unsustainable \r\nsituation for any country, but even more so for small \r\nisland States. \r\n Negotiations on an arms trade treaty are \r\nwelcome, and, as stated in the Caribbean Community \r\nDeclaration on Small Arms and Light Weapons, \r\nDominica is committed to full and active participation \r\nin all efforts related to the issue of small arms. Of \r\nparticular importance is the 2012 review of the 2001 \r\nProgramme of Action to Prevent, Combat and \r\nEradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light \r\nWeapons in All Its Aspects, as well as the 2012 United \r\nNations Conference on the Arms Trade Treaty. \r\n In the absence of these and other initiatives to \r\nhelp combat global insecurity, threats to global peace \r\nand security will continue to multiply in both intensity \r\nand form. Multilateralism must take centre stage in the \r\nstruggle to deal with these challenges. The work of the \r\nUnited Nations is therefore paramount in maintaining \r\nworld peace and security. In its maintenance of this \r\nrole, the United Nations must be able to clearly \r\ndemonstrate legitimacy and fairness in its actions, \r\ncognizant always of the need to protect the most \r\nvulnerable. \r\n The ability of the Security Council to adequately \r\nrespond to new and changing world dynamics rests \r\nwith its acceptance of the need for continuous reform \r\nto adapt to the times, including a recognition of the \r\nincrease in size of the United Nations membership and \r\nglobal economic power shifts. Reform reflects more \r\nthan representation and, in this situation, should \r\npromote adaptation to the needs of Members and the \r\ndrafting of strategies that would contribute to ending \r\nwars and halting disputes. \r\n In that regard, we welcome Mr. Al-Nasser’s \r\nproposal of “The role of mediation in the settlement of \r\ndisputes by peaceful means” as the theme for the high-\r\nlevel debate at the opening of this session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\nA/66/PV.30  \r\n \r\n11-51687 6 \r\n \r\n Earlier I spoke of the threats which plague \r\nmankind in this era of globalization. I also highlighted \r\nthe need for multilateralism and for cooperation \r\nbetween and among States. These challenges can be \r\novercome only in a global environment where there \r\nexists respect for one another’s territorial integrity, \r\nnon-interference in one another’s domestic affairs, \r\nrespect for sovereignty and the right of self-\r\ndetermination. It is in this context that we again call on \r\nthe United States of America to discontinue its \r\neconomic blockade against the people of the Republic \r\nof Cuba. \r\n I also welcome the support of the President of the \r\nAssembly in keeping our sister island of Haiti on the \r\nglobal stage. There are few words left to describe the \r\ndire misery in which our brothers and sisters in Haiti \r\nare living. The paralysis of reconstruction and \r\ndevelopment activities has been the hallmark of the \r\naftermath of the earthquake that devastated that \r\ncountry in January 2010.  \r\n We recognize the tremendous challenges to the \r\nreconstruction efforts and wish to thank those \r\ncountries, institutions and individuals who have \r\ncontributed and continue to contribute towards this \r\nprocess. We again call on those who have made \r\npledges to make good on their commitments in order to \r\naccelerate the reconstruction efforts. \r\n The presence of the United Nations Stabilization \r\nMission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) remains critical to the \r\nreconstruction efforts by providing security and \r\nsupport to the people of Haiti. We therefore urge the \r\nSecurity Council to extend the tenure of MINUSTAH \r\nto facilitate the efforts of the new Administration of \r\nHis Excellency President Michel Martelly. \r\n We all accept that it is critical to collectively \r\naddress the impact of climate change, to resolve \r\nconflicts throughout the world and to enhance peace \r\nand security for humanity. All these efforts, however, \r\nwill be of little value to our peoples if we are not able \r\nto ensure that they are healthy. The United Nations has \r\nshown exemplary leadership in dealing with the fight \r\nagainst HIV/AIDS, together with its partners. This \r\nsame leadership must now be given to the fight against \r\nnon-communicable diseases. \r\n The frightening statistics of 2008 issued by the \r\nWorld Health Organization, which estimated that \r\n36 million deaths worldwide were due to \r\nnon-communicable diseases (NCDs), suggests that this \r\nphenomenon is not unique to any one region and \r\ntherefore cannot be downplayed. NCDs pose one of the \r\ngreatest challenges to the health and development of \r\nDominica, the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and \r\nthe rest of the world. The severe impacts of \r\nnon-communicable diseases continue to place \r\ntremendous pressures on our health-care systems, \r\nproductivity and already overburdened and struggling \r\neconomies. \r\n It was for these reasons that the CARICOM \r\nHeads of Government issued the Port of Spain \r\nDeclaration in 2007 to promote healthy lifestyles and \r\nto combat NCDs in our region. Prior to and since the \r\ndeclaration, the Dominican Government has adopted a \r\nnational policy on NCDs. We have further \r\nimplemented a number of measures as part of our \r\nmultisectoral efforts to include education; the \r\nstrengthening of our primary health-care system with \r\nthe contribution of our partners, the Bolivarian \r\nRepublic of Venezuela and the Republic of Cuba; the \r\npromotion of healthy lifestyles; greater access to \r\ntreatment and free health care; and appropriate \r\nlegislative and policy changes. The Government of \r\nDominica endorses the leadership taken by the \r\nCaribbean Community in this regard. We remain \r\ncommitted to the well-being of every citizen. \r\n We join our CARICOM colleagues in thanking \r\nthe United Nations Member States and Secretariat for \r\nconvening the successful High-level Meeting on \r\nNCDs. We look forward to the implementation of the \r\nPolitical Declaration (resolution 66/2) and call on the \r\ndeveloped countries to partner with us in our various \r\nefforts to combat NCDs. \r\n Finally, Dominica wishes to reaffirm its \r\nconfidence in the United Nations system as the \r\nultimate negotiating and deliberating body for \r\naddressing major challenges confronting the world. \r\nThe Assembly can count on Dominica’s commitment to \r\nworking in close collaboration with the United Nations \r\nagencies and respective Member States to strengthen \r\nthe mission of this body. We cannot overemphasize the \r\nfact that, notwithstanding its many limitations and \r\nimperfections, the United Nations system is critical to \r\nmaintaining world peace and security and an \r\ninternational humanitarian system. The world today is \r\na much better place because of the United Nations. \r\n A/66/PV.30\r\n \r\n7 11-51687 \r\n \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Donatus Keith St. Aimee, chairman \r\nof the delegation of Saint Lucia. \r\n Mr. St. Aimee (Saint Lucia): Not since the \r\nprelude to the two world wars have there been so much \r\nuncertainty and anxiety within the international system. \r\nThe sands are indeed shifting, as the President of the \r\nAssembly stressed at the opening of this sixty-sixth \r\nsession (see A/66/PV.1). \r\n The shifts in the struggles for freedom and the \r\nstruggles for rights, some of which we in Saint Lucia \r\ntake for granted; the shifts in the number of natural \r\ndisasters that devastate country after country; financial \r\nmeltdowns, increases in the price of energy and food, \r\nand food shortages have all converged and met at a \r\nmoment when the challenge to cope weighs upon us \r\nall. However, the weight carried by a small island State \r\nbears down like an elephant on an ant, and although the \r\nant is capable of carrying many times its own weight, it \r\nwould never choose to carry an elephant.  \r\n The current world economic and financial \r\nsituations are not of our making but they affect us more \r\nthan anybody else. It continues to confound us how the \r\nStates of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), with \r\nthe exception of Haiti of course — small island States \r\nlike us, with limited resources, limited populations, \r\nlimited land mass and small economies — can be \r\nclassified as middle-income. With that classification, \r\nwe are not eligible for special arrangements in finance \r\nand trade. There must be something wrong with that \r\nclassification. We continue to argue that the \r\nmethodology employed for such categorization puts \r\nsmall island developing States (SIDS) at a great \r\ndisadvantage in terms of receiving favourable aid and \r\ntrade packages, thereby adversely affecting our \r\ndevelopment strategies. \r\n The continued attrition of trade preferences at the \r\nmultilateral level challenges our very small — and, I \r\nreiterate, very vulnerable — economies and requires \r\nour Governments to employ creative structural \r\narrangements and adjustments and fiscal exercises to \r\nkeep our economies afloat. The present application of \r\nthe terms of trade and conditions of aid are very \r\nunfavourable to us. \r\n Emphasis therefore has to be placed on the \r\nconsideration of a balanced approach to foreign \r\ninvestment and environmental integrity, and investors \r\nmust not place undue pressure on small States. Rather, \r\nthere should be an understanding of our challenges and \r\nour willingness to work in a win-win situation. \r\nFavourable mechanisms for finance and technology \r\ntransfer would enable small island States to take \r\nadvantage of the benefits that these offer as \r\nprerequisites for sustainable development. This is all \r\nwe ask, nothing more — a chance to claim our part. \r\n We stress our vulnerability to natural disasters \r\nand their disproportionate effect on small island \r\neconomies, and we seek rapid and meaningful response \r\nmechanisms at the regional and international levels in \r\norder to enable our vulnerable economies to recover as \r\nquickly as possible. Almost every year, gains made \r\nduring the first half of the year are eroded in the last \r\nquarter by weather-related phenomena. \r\n Saint Lucia is still recovering from Hurricane \r\nTomas, which struck the island in October 2010. Let \r\nme take this opportunity to thank those who \r\ncontributed so generously to our recovery. Of course, \r\nwe will still accept any generous contributions. \r\n Saint Lucia, like other SIDS, recognizes the vital \r\nrole that oceans play in national and global economic \r\ndevelopment. In light of this, the Government of Saint \r\nLucia remains committed to ensuring the sustainable \r\ndevelopment of both coastal and marine resources.  \r\n For a number of years now, Saint Lucia has had \r\nlegislation in place that speaks to effective fisheries \r\nmanagement with laws on open and closed seasons for \r\ncertain fisheries such as lobsters and, in order to \r\nprevent the capture of juvenile fish, mesh-size limits \r\nfor nets and fish-trap fisheries. The Government is also \r\ntargeting large pelagic fish and other species not \r\ntraditionally harvested by local fishers, in order to \r\nreduce pressure on coastal and reef fishing. In addition, \r\na number of marine reserves and marine management \r\nareas have been established, with the most well-known \r\nof these being the Soufriere Marine Management \r\nAssociation, which has been used to inform the \r\nestablishment of other marine parks within the \r\nCaribbean and, I may add, globally. \r\n The President took the Chair. \r\n The Government of Saint Lucia has adopted an \r\ninstitutional framework for integrated coastal zone \r\nmanagement and is working towards ensuring its \r\nsuccessful implementation through a Caribbean coastal \r\nzone management unit and a coastal zone management \r\nadvisory committee. \r\nA/66/PV.30  \r\n \r\n11-51687 8 \r\n \r\n I dwell on the issue of oceans and seas because \r\nthe impacts of climate change and sea-level rise are \r\nreal to SIDS, and Saint Lucia, through a number of \r\nprojects and programmes, is seeking to build the \r\nisland’s resilience to these impacts through the formal \r\nadoption of a national building code and the \r\ndevelopment of environmental impact, physical \r\nplanning and development regulations.  \r\n Nevertheless, Saint Lucia has recognized the \r\nimportance of having access to data and models at the \r\nnational and local levels in defining and informing the \r\ncountry’s response to climate change, and in this regard \r\nis taking a number of steps to build the requisite \r\ndatabase by working with various national, regional \r\nand global organizations. \r\n The Caribbean Sea is an important international \r\nshipping route for both tourism and trade. Considered \r\nby the United Nations Environment Programme \r\n(UNEP) to be a biodiversity hotspot, the Caribbean Sea \r\nis and will remain our livelihood. It keeps us afloat, but \r\nit can also drown us if we do not manage it properly; \r\nthat is what seas do. It therefore needs special \r\nattention, and our Government is promoting an \r\nintegrated management approach to the Caribbean Sea \r\narea in the context of sustainable development. We \r\ntherefore support the work of the UNEP Caribbean \r\nEnvironment Programme, and we hope that funding \r\nwill be made available to that programme to enable us \r\nto achieve our goals. \r\n For all these reasons, Saint Lucia would like to \r\ncall on the international community to ensure that there \r\nis a strong focus on oceans in the preparatory \r\nnegotiations for the upcoming United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20). We \r\ncannot forget the importance of oceans to SIDS in \r\nproviding energy and food security, and to the world as \r\na whole in regulating our climate. Oceans are a \r\nregulatory mechanism for climate. \r\n As countries worldwide prepare for the Rio+20 \r\nEarth summit, we note that the green economy is a \r\nmajor theme for discussion. Renewable energy and \r\nenergy efficiency are at the heart of the green economy. \r\nPetroleum giants like British Petroleum and Shell are \r\nnow turning to investments in solar and wind energy. \r\nCountries such as Germany, the Netherlands and Brazil \r\nhave positioned themselves as strong proponents of \r\nrenewable energy. Sustainable energy technologies \r\nhave been and continue to be a subject of significant \r\nresearch and development, with very promising results.  \r\n At the policy level, a number of countries, \r\nincluding my own, have articulated noble and \r\nambitious energy policies to steer us into the future. In \r\nnegotiations taking place pursuant to the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change, \r\nclimate change mitigation is inextricably linked to \r\nsustainable energy development and continues to \r\ngenerate much debate as State parties seek to find \r\nlasting solutions to the problem of greenhouse gas \r\nemissions. \r\n But while the United Nations endeavours to \r\npromote equity and equality among individual \r\ncountries, our capacities are not the same. Countries \r\nlike ours yearn to enjoy the benefits of sustainable, \r\nrenewable energy sources, but despite having \r\nsignificant potential for renewable energy, we have not \r\nyet been able to meaningfully develop these resources. \r\nIt is therefore imperative that the international \r\ncommunity take decisive action to assist small island \r\nStates, isolated as we are, in achieving energy security \r\nthrough renewable energy and energy efficiency \r\nprogrammes. Financing is a critical element in the \r\ndevelopment of new and renewable forms of energy. \r\n So far, SIDS have largely been overlooked, as \r\ninvestments are made in larger economies where \r\ngreater economies of scale and profits beckon. Even \r\nwith the existence of avenues such as the clean \r\ndevelopment mechanism, which should also promote \r\nsustainable energy projects, the results have not been \r\nvery encouraging for SIDS. We hope that, not too long \r\nfrom now, that situation may change. \r\n We applaud the efforts and resources put into the \r\nconservation and preservation of the world’s forests to \r\nreverse desertification. We think, however, that \r\nconsiderable attention should also be given to what I \r\nterm “small stands of trees” in our small island States. \r\nAlthough we call them forests, to those who have very \r\nlarge forests they are small stands of trees, but they are \r\nimportant to us because they are critical and crucial to \r\nsoil fertility and therefore guarantee production and \r\nproductivity in agriculture, thereby promoting food \r\nsecurity and the alleviation of poverty. \r\n Similarly, Saint Lucia welcomes the adoption of \r\nthe Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit-sharing \r\nand is grateful to the Government of Japan for \r\nproviding an implementation fund for developing \r\n A/66/PV.30\r\n \r\n9 11-51687 \r\n \r\ncountries. We see that as a great opportunity to help \r\nour communities to benefit from their biological \r\nresources and the traditional knowledge associated \r\nwith them, so that they too can play their role in the \r\nconservation of biological diversity. In accordance with \r\nthe declaration of 2011-2020 as the United Nations \r\nDecade on Biodiversity, we urge all countries to work \r\nclosely together to conserve biological resources for \r\nthe present day and posterity. \r\n The recently concluded High-level Meeting on \r\nnon-communicable Diseases provided an opportunity \r\nto deepen relations and collaboration with Member \r\nStates, regional and international agencies and \r\ndevelopment partners, and to share technical expertise, \r\nbest practices and resources as we continue to strive to \r\nmeet clearly defined goals and objectives. As a \r\nmember of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), \r\nwhich spearheaded this initiative, Saint Lucia wishes to \r\nplace on record its appreciation for the commitment of \r\nall Member States, United Nations agencies, \r\nparticularly the World Health Organization, and other \r\ninterested groups in addressing the scourge of \r\nnon-communicable diseases. We nevertheless need to \r\nset targets, implement programmes and measure \r\nsuccess if we are to make progress beyond just another \r\nmeeting. \r\n Saint Lucia, like all of the other CARICOM \r\nmember States, is grappling with security threats \r\nengendered by the illicit trade in small arms and light \r\nweapons and trafficking in narcotics. The associated \r\nrise in crime and violence involving the use of firearms \r\nhas had a significant adverse effect on the socio-\r\neconomic and human development of our countries. \r\nSaint Lucia will therefore spare no effort in working \r\ntowards concluding an arms trade treaty that is legally \r\nbinding, robust and comprehensive; contains the \r\nhighest possible standard for the transfer of \r\nconventional arms, including small arms, light \r\nweapons and ammunition; is effective in regulating the \r\narms trade, particularly in preventing diversion; and is \r\nuniversal in subscription. \r\n Saint Lucia welcomes the Republic of South \r\nSudan as the most recent member of our community \r\nand wishes it progress, peace and prosperity. We look \r\nforward to welcoming the State of Palestine to this \r\nbody after successful negotiations have been \r\nconcluded. That is our hope. \r\n The anachronistic, half-century blockade imposed \r\non the people of our neighbour, Cuba, suffocates that \r\npeople’s right to prosperity and progress. The outdated \r\nmechanism’s illogical application does not fit twenty-\r\nfirst century geopolitics, economics or \r\nhumanitarianism. We therefore add our voice to others \r\nthat have spoken before us in calling for an end to this \r\nblockade and to all limitations on the rights of the \r\nCuban people to progress and prosperity. \r\n In the spirit of the greater good, we are pleased \r\nthat, since 2009, Taiwan has been able to participate in \r\nthe World Health Association (WHA), in recognition of \r\nthe fact that global health issues require universal \r\nparticipation and cooperation to overcome those major \r\nproblems that affect the peoples of every corner of the \r\nglobe. \r\n Sustainable development, like health, is one of \r\nthose issues that require global participation and \r\ncooperation. Taiwan is a leading economic and \r\ntechnological powerhouse and can contribute \r\nsubstantially not only to health but to a range of global \r\nissues that face the world today. We urge the United \r\nNations to find suitable means to permit Taiwan to \r\nparticipate in its specialized agencies and mechanisms, \r\nincluding the International Civil Aviation Organization \r\nand the United Nations Framework Convention on \r\nClimate Change all of which have worldwide \r\nimplications, along the lines of the WHA model. \r\nSurely, 25 million people living on planet Earth can \r\ncontribute to this body of peoples. \r\n In conclusion, the shifting sands are revealing an \r\ninternational system on the brink of change. We are at \r\na moment when a decision taken here in this great \r\nAssembly will reverberate throughout history. \r\nDecisions taken here can create a State or divide a \r\nState; they can bring peace or bring renewed conflict. \r\nThe theme for this general debate — “The role of \r\nmediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful \r\nmeans” was well chosen. Let it guide our work this \r\nyear and beyond. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Carsten Staur, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of the Kingdom of Denmark. \r\n Mr. Staur (Denmark): First of all, I would like to \r\nalign myself with the statement made by the President \r\nof the European Council, Mr. Herman van Rompuy, on \r\nbehalf of the European Union (see A/66/PV.15). \r\nDenmark appreciates the adoption earlier this year of \r\nA/66/PV.30  \r\n \r\n11-51687 10 \r\n \r\nresolution 65/276, giving the European Union (EU) the \r\nopportunity to address the General Assembly at this \r\njuncture of its deliberations. The Lisbon Treaty marks a \r\nnew phase of European cooperation that will benefit \r\nthe United Nations as well. \r\n The past year has once again demonstrated how \r\nquickly events can unfold and how unexpected crises \r\ncan break out in different parts of the world. These \r\ninclude a violent conflict in Côte d’Ivoire before a \r\ndemocratically elected president could finally take his \r\nrightful place; devastating earthquakes and tsunamis in \r\nJapan, followed by nuclear contamination; the current \r\nand still more severe humanitarian crisis in the Horn of \r\nAfrica; and Pakistan being struck by overwhelming \r\nfloods. \r\n There have also been events of historic \r\nproportions that are still unfolding in North Africa and \r\nthe Middle East. From Tunisia to Egypt, from Libya to \r\nSyria, from Bahrain to Yemen and beyond, people are \r\ndemanding their rights and their freedom. They are \r\nstanding up for core human aspirations and values. \r\nThey want to shape their own lives, economically and \r\npolitically. Theirs is a call for political participation, \r\nfor freedom of speech and for the right of peaceful \r\nassembly; a call for dignity, for accountability, for \r\njustice and for jobs. It has sparked hope for a better life \r\nfor the people of the region. The international \r\ncommunity, with the United Nations in the lead, has a \r\nstrong responsibility to support these historic \r\naspirations. \r\n The winds of change currently sweeping across \r\nthe Middle East and North Africa have confirmed once \r\nagain that the desire for freedom, democratic reforms \r\nand respect for human rights is universal. A few days \r\nago, countries met under the auspices of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to express their admiration for the courage of \r\nthe Libyan people in their struggle to take control of \r\ntheir own future. Denmark is proud to have supported \r\nthe legitimate aspirations of the Libyan people and to \r\nhave contributed to the protection of the lives of \r\nLibyan civilians.  \r\n A few days ago, the Assembly welcomed the \r\nNational Transitional Council (NTC) as the \r\nrepresentative of Libya. Being here today with the \r\nNTC in the seat of Libya is tangible evidence of the \r\nprogress achieved by the Libyan people in determining \r\ntheir own destiny. Along with the international \r\ncommunity, Denmark continues to support the \r\naspirations of the Libyan people. It is encouraging that \r\nthe Security Council has now authorized a new United \r\nNations Mission to support Libyan national efforts. \r\n Developments across the Middle East and North \r\nAfrica make it clear that in the twenty-first century, \r\nGovernments must be politically accountable, respect \r\npeople’s rights and dignity, and deliver economic \r\nopportunities. The only credible response to those \r\nlegitimate popular demands is sustainable political and \r\neconomic reforms. \r\n Unfortunately, we sometimes witness countries \r\nfail to live up to their responsibility and obligations as \r\nmembers of the international community. As we speak, \r\nevents continue to unfold across the region, including \r\nin Syria. More than 2,600 people in Syria have died \r\nduring the popular uprising. We strongly condemn the \r\nviolence and the killings of peaceful demonstrators. It \r\nis high time to respect the right of peaceful protesters \r\nand their legitimate demands. To increase the pressure \r\non the Syrian regime, we have adopted sanctions and \r\nhope others will join us. \r\n Some of the prerequisites for a sustainable \r\ntransition to a flourishing democracy are free, fair and \r\ntransparent elections, free media, the protection of \r\nminorities, a functioning government and an \r\nindependent judiciary that upholds the rule of law. \r\nDemocratic change must come from within. It has to be \r\nhome-grown and based on local leadership, ownership \r\nand participation. Surely, this does not exclude \r\ninternational assistance, including from the United \r\nNations. \r\n Afghanistan has come a long way since the fall of \r\nthe Taliban regime. We hope that Afghanistan will take \r\nyet another step in its transition process at the \r\nupcoming Conference in Bonn in December. Moving \r\ntowards 2014, the United Nations system, in close \r\ncooperation with the Afghan authorities, will also have \r\nto undertake a thorough review of its activities in \r\nAfghanistan in order to continuously maximize its \r\ncontribution to good governance, anti-corruption and \r\nsustainable socio-economic development. \r\n What we see around the world is not only a call \r\nfor political reforms; it is also a call for inclusive \r\neconomic development, for jobs pure and simple, and \r\nfor improved standards of living. And not least, it is a \r\ncall from and about youth. Governments will need to \r\nstrengthen economic and social reforms, ensuring that \r\n A/66/PV.30\r\n \r\n11 11-51687 \r\n \r\nthey generate inclusive growth and shared prosperity \r\nfor all and not just for the few and already privileged.  \r\n The Millennium Development Goals have \r\nsucceeded in galvanizing action, not least in health and \r\neducation, and all countries have a joint obligation to \r\nensure that the goals we agreed in 2000 will actually be \r\nfulfilled by 2015. The development challenge is \r\npressing in sub-Saharan Africa, a region long marked \r\nby poverty and conflict, but in recent years also \r\ncharacterized in many countries by strong economic \r\ngrowth and optimism. \r\n National ownership and clear political \r\ncommitments remain the keys to success. But for many \r\nof the poorest countries, development cooperation \r\ncontinues to be an important tool and a catalyst in their \r\nefforts to ensure that the poorest people will also be \r\nable to enjoy the full potential of globalization. \r\nDenmark is doing its part to assist, based on a sound \r\ntrack record in international development cooperation. \r\nWe are one of only five countries which at present \r\nfulfil the internationally agreed development goal of \r\ndelivering at least 0.7 per cent of gross national \r\nproduct as development assistance. We would like to \r\nwelcome others to this “point-seven” club. \r\n We shall not succeed, however, without focusing \r\nin particular on countries affected by conflict or \r\nfragility. We especially look to the United Nations to \r\ncoordinate efforts in those countries. That is where the \r\nUnited Nations can make a real difference. \r\n The advancement of women’s equality and the \r\nempowerment of women are important aspects of this \r\nprocess. We welcome the creation of UN-Women and \r\nlook forward to working closely with that new entity in \r\nthe area of gender mainstreaming. No less important is \r\nthe issue of sexual and reproductive health and the \r\nrights of women. \r\n The United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (Rio+20), to be held in Rio de Janeiro in \r\nJune 2012, presents a unique opportunity to revitalize \r\nthe discussion and understanding of sustainable \r\ndevelopment. Rio+20 will be an opportunity to put \r\nsustainable development at the top of the global \r\ndevelopment agenda. \r\n Denmark welcomes the focus on green economy \r\nand the institutional framework for sustainable \r\ndevelopment. Transitioning to a green economy is \r\nnecessary if the world is to cope with the multiple \r\nchallenges of resource scarcity, poverty eradication and \r\nclimate change. Economic growth will be crucial in the \r\ndecades ahead, but it will have to be green. Today, \r\n1.4 billion people are without access to modern sources \r\nof energy. Universal access to energy will contribute to \r\nlifting hundreds of millions out of poverty. \r\n Poland and Denmark, as part of the EU trio \r\npresidency for 2011 and 2012, are working jointly to \r\nstrengthen the green growth agenda and contribute to \r\nthe global objective of sustainable development, in \r\naccordance with the trio presidency programme. Next \r\nmonth, Denmark will host the first Global Green \r\nGrowth Forum in Copenhagen. The Forum will lend \r\nnew momentum to public-private cooperation on \r\nconcrete initiatives that will inspire regulatory \r\ninterventions, remove key barriers and identify \r\nopportunities and solutions for a renewed push to \r\nadvance green growth globally. \r\n Earlier this year, we witnessed the birth of a new \r\nState as we welcomed the 193rd Member of the United \r\nNations. The Republic of South Sudan is the fulfilment \r\nof the democratically expressed will to self-\r\ndetermination by the overwhelming majority of the \r\nSouth Sudanese people. We congratulate the people of \r\nSouth Sudan on their historic achievement. \r\n The Palestinian cause and quest for statehood are \r\nhigh on the agenda here in New York, and rightly so. \r\nThe present regional context reminds us all, including \r\nthe two parties, that direct political peace negotiations \r\nmust now be resumed. Within a specific time frame, \r\nthey must produce a lasting peace and an end to \r\nconflict based on the two-State solution, with both \r\nStates living side by side in peace and security. \r\n Let me also take this opportunity to congratulate \r\nthe Secretary-General on his appointment to a second \r\nfive-year term. We have all been inspired by his tireless \r\nefforts in the field of peace and security and human \r\nrights and by his strong leadership on climate change \r\nand sustainable development. At a time when the \r\nUnited Nations is ever more relevant, Denmark lends \r\nits full support to the Secretary-General and to his \r\nstewardship of the Organization. The challenges we \r\nface call for international resolve and for joint action. \r\nIn the Secretary-General’s own words, “We need \r\nresults that people can see and touch, results that \r\nchange lives and make a difference” (A/65/PV.101, \r\np. 9). That is why we turn to the United Nations. \r\nA/66/PV.30  \r\n \r\n11-51687 12 \r\n \r\n That is the end of my prepared statement, but I \r\nam aware that I am the last speaker in the general \r\ndebate of the sixty-sixth session of the General \r\nAssembly. Let me therefore also take this opportunity \r\non my own behalf — and I am sure also on behalf of \r\nspeakers before me — to thank the conference service \r\nstaff and the interpreters for their tireless efforts and \r\nlong working days, which have facilitated this unique \r\ninternational debate. \r\n The exchange of views that we have during the \r\ngeneral debate allows each and every one of us a \r\nprivileged glimpse into the positions, the values and \r\nthe political priorities of all 193 Member States. The \r\ndebate provides a strong and clear indication of what \r\nissues really engage Governments. It demonstrates \r\nwhat parts of the very broad United Nations agenda \r\neach and every Government is most preoccupied with, \r\nwhat their concerns are and which outcomes and \r\nsolutions they seek. From this debate, we get a unique \r\nand straight look into the soul of global politics. It \r\nhelps us understand each other, including when we \r\ndisagree, and it informs our work together in the \r\nAssembly in the months to come. \r\n So we may congratulate each other on a job well \r\ndone, now at the end of the debate, but it is only the \r\nbeginning. The true value of this debate will be seen \r\nonly later, and it will depend on all of us coming \r\ntogether to find common ground and workable \r\nsolutions. \r\n The President: We have heard the last speaker in \r\nthe general debate. \r\n Several representatives have requested to speak \r\nin exercise of the right of reply. May I remind members \r\nthat statements in exercise of the right of reply are \r\nlimited to 10 minutes for the first intervention and to \r\nfive minutes for the second intervention, and should be \r\nmade by delegations from their seats.  \r\n Mr. Kohona (Sri Lanka): This statement is made \r\nin exercise of the right of reply to the remarks made by \r\nthe Minister for Foreign Affairs of Canada in the \r\ngeneral debate on 26 September (see A/66/PV.26).  \r\n The Sri Lanka delegation is deeply anguished by \r\nthe remarks made by the Canadian Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs, Mr. John Baird, despite our extensive efforts to \r\nkeep the Canadian delegation in Geneva informed of \r\nthe reasons for and background to Sri Lanka’s \r\nobjections to the Canadian initiative on an interactive \r\ndialogue on the lessons learned and reconciliation \r\ncommission process in Sri Lanka at the March 2012 \r\nsession of the Human Rights Council, including \r\ndomestic mechanisms put in place. The Sri Lankan \r\nobjections have been endorsed by a wide cross-section \r\nof members of the Council. \r\n In the United Nations, an Organization comprised \r\nof 193 countries that subscribe to a range of social, \r\neconomic and political philosophies, procedure and \r\nprocess are critically important to ensuring good \r\ngovernance and equity and to preventing \r\nintergovernmental organizations such as the United \r\nNations from being abused for narrow, domestic \r\npolitical advantage and selective application of \r\nprinciple. The rule-based framework of the United \r\nNations system, which we all value, must be \r\nsafeguarded for the protection of all against such \r\nabuse. \r\n Mr. Nazarian (Armenia): I have asked for the \r\nfloor to exercise my delegation’s right of reply to the \r\nstatement made by the Azerbaijani Foreign Minister \r\nthis morning (see A/66/PV.28). The references in that \r\nstatement to Armenia and Nagorno Karabakh can be \r\nattributed only to the imagination of the speaker, who \r\nstill presumes that cold war-style propaganda and \r\nrepeated anti-Armenian statements at the United \r\nNations can be an effective tool for strengthening his \r\ncountry’s position in the ongoing efforts of the \r\nco-chairs of the Organization for Security and \r\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE) Minsk Group to find a \r\ncomprehensive — I repeat, a comprehensive — and \r\npeaceful settlement to the Nagorno Karabakh issue, \r\nand not the step-by-step solution referred to by the \r\nAzerbaijani Foreign Minister.  \r\n That statement revealed that the Foreign Minister \r\nof Azerbaijan, while preaching adherence to \r\ninternational law, has apparently taken it upon himself \r\nto single-handedly interpret — or rather, \r\nmisinterpret — the United Nations Charter and \r\nstatements made by the Armenian President and the \r\nMinsk Group co-chairs on the field assessment mission \r\nto the territories surrounding Nagorno Karabakh.  \r\n It is regrettable that Azerbaijan is once again \r\nmisusing and misinterpreting the field assessment \r\nmission report, as it did in 2005, to justify its \r\nmilitaristic rhetoric and move the discussions on the \r\nNagorno Karabakh conflict to other formats. \r\nAzerbaijan’s own interpretation of the report \r\n A/66/PV.30\r\n \r\n13 11-51687 \r\n \r\ncontradicts the explanations and recommendations \r\npresented earlier by the Minsk Group co-chairs. \r\n The accusations contained in the statement by the \r\nAzerbaijani Foreign Minister are not only baseless and \r\ncounterproductive but, more importantly, they \r\nendanger the negotiation process. First of all, none of \r\nthe four Security Council resolutions on Nagorno \r\nKarabakh contains a single word on the so-called \r\nArmenian aggression. On the contrary, it was \r\nAzerbaijan that first launched a large-scale armed \r\noffensive against the civilian population of Nagorno \r\nKarabakh in response to the peaceful and constitutional \r\nexpression of the will of its people to exercise their \r\nright to self-determination.  \r\n Secondly, the aforementioned resolutions do not \r\ncontain a word about the withdrawal of Armenian \r\nmilitary forces from Nagorno Karabakh. That is simply \r\nbecause they have never been there.  \r\n Thirdly, the defence army of Nagorno Karabkh \r\ncontrols only 8.5 per cent of Azerbaijani territory, \r\nwhich serves as a security buffer zone, as opposed to \r\nthe 20 per cent quoted in the statement of Azerbaijan. \r\nMoreover, Azerbaijan itself controls 15 per cent of the \r\nterritory of Nagorno Karabakh.  \r\n Finally, the Azerbaijani Foreign Minister claims \r\nthat there are 1 million refugees in the country — a \r\nfigure that does not correspond to any official data \r\nprovided by international organizations. Such \r\nexaggerations and distortions of facts and figures \r\nundermine the work of the United Nations and other \r\ninternational forums, artificially delaying constructive \r\nsteps to meet the needs and alleviate the suffering of \r\nthe people of Nagorno Karabakh. Even if Azerbaijan is \r\nmisleading its own people’s public opinion by \r\ndistorting facts, it cannot do so to the international \r\ncommunity. \r\n Armenia has always supported the settlement of \r\nthe conflict between Azerbaijan and Nagorno Karabakh \r\nthrough the exclusive use of peaceful means, and has \r\nrepeatedly proven that in practice. Armenia has given a \r\nclear answer to the latest version of the basic principles \r\nproposed by the three co-Chairs of the OSCE Minsk \r\nGroup as a basis for negotiation of the settlement. If \r\nAzerbaijan is willing to agree unequivocally to it, it \r\nwill be possible to see progress in the settlement \r\nprocess. \r\n Mr. Musayev (Azerbaijan): I would like to \r\nexercise the right of reply to the remarks made by the \r\nrepresentative of Armenia. Those remarks represent yet \r\nanother piece of evidence that testifies to Armenia’s \r\napparent disregard of its obligations under the Charter \r\nof the United Nations and international law, and also \r\ndemonstrate how far that Member State is from being \r\nengaged in a constructive search for peace in the \r\nregion.  \r\n It is curious that the delegation of Armenia — the \r\ncountry that bears primary responsibility for \r\nunleashing the war of aggression against Azerbaijan, \r\ncarrying out ethnic cleansing on a massive scale, \r\ncommitting other heinous crimes during the conflict, \r\nand advocating an undisguised racist ideology — \r\nshould attempt to criticize my country and lecture it on \r\nissues pertaining to such notions as peace, human \r\nrights, negotiations and conflict resolution. \r\n The delegation of Armenia must be well aware \r\nthat what it considers to be the exercise of the right to \r\nself-determination by the Armenian ethnic minority \r\nliving in Azerbaijan has been unequivocally \r\ncharacterized by the Security Council and the General \r\nAssembly, as well as by other authoritative \r\ninternational organizations, as the illegal use of force \r\nagainst the sovereignty and territorial integrity of \r\nAzerbaijan, and other egregious violations of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations and international law. \r\nThe illegality of the separatist entity and its structures \r\nestablished by Armenia on the occupied territory of \r\nAzerbaijan has been repeatedly pointed out at the \r\ninternational level in the most unambiguous manner. \r\n The Government of Armenia, which has purged \r\nboth the territory of its own country and the occupied \r\nareas of Azerbaijan of non-Armenians, and has thus \r\nsucceeded in creating a mono-ethnic culture there, \r\nshould be the last to advocate the unilateral secession \r\nof ethnic minority groups from sovereign States.  \r\n The remarks of the delegation of Armenia have \r\nnot deviated from the usual speculations and \r\nmisinterpretations as to the true value and content of \r\nthe conflict settlement process and mediation efforts. \r\nIntensified attacks over the past month on Azerbaijani \r\ncivilians and civilian objects across the front line, and \r\nan unprecedented increase in hostile statements by the \r\nArmenian leadership — full of historical falsifications \r\nand factual distortions concerning the root causes of \r\nthe war and the conflict settlement process — have \r\nA/66/PV.30  \r\n \r\n11-51687 14 \r\n \r\nconfirmed the validity of our serious concerns about \r\nthe destabilizing effect of Armenia’s policy, and \r\nrepresent a direct threat to peace, security and stability \r\nin the region. \r\n We are confident that Armenia’s destructive \r\npolitical agenda is fated never to be realized. Armenia \r\nwill be obliged to cease its provocative policy, to \r\nensure that its occupation of Azerbaijani territory is \r\nended, to renounce its territorial claims on \r\nneighbouring nations, and to establish civilized \r\nrelations with all countries of the region. Azerbaijan \r\nsincerely believes that there is no alternative to peace, \r\nstability and mutually beneficial regional cooperation. \r\n The President: We have heard the last speaker in \r\nexercise of the right of reply. \r\n I will now offer some concluding remarks on the \r\ngeneral debate. \r\n \r\nStatement by the President \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): Now that we \r\nhave come to the end of the general debate of the sixty-\r\nsixth session of the General Assembly, permit me to \r\nexpress my sincere gratitude for members’ \r\nparticipation in this open, constructive and \r\ncomprehensive dialogue among world leaders. \r\n Before making my statement, I cannot fail to \r\nexpress, on behalf of the General Assembly and on my \r\nown behalf, our deep sadness and shock at the death of \r\nMs. Wangari Maathai of Kenya, the Nobel Peace Prize \r\nlaureate. I offer her family and the people and \r\nGovernment of Kenya our sincere condolences. \r\n This has unquestionably been a historic and \r\nmemorable debate. Many Member States have \r\nacknowledged the hope we have felt as we have \r\nwatched so many transformations taking place around \r\nthe world whereby people have actively questioned and \r\nchallenged their governing regimes. World leaders \r\nhave praised the courage of those who have fought for \r\nfreedom, dignity and democracy, and made it clear that \r\nGovernments cannot oppress their peoples without \r\nbeing held accountable. \r\n We have also welcomed new leaders who have \r\ncome to this Hall to convey their countries’ hopes and \r\nneeds. Those leaders have called on the international \r\ncommunity to help them fulfil the aspirations of their \r\npeoples to establish the rule of law, achieve \r\ntransparency and economic prosperity, uphold justice \r\nand respect human rights. In this context, I should be \r\nremiss if I did not encourage the international \r\ncommunity to stand united in support of the \r\ntransformational process of the Libyan-led transition. \r\n We have also witnessed the renewed hope and \r\ndetermination of the Palestinian people. In a truly \r\nhistoric moment, President Mahmoud Abbas \r\nannounced that he had submitted an application to the \r\nSecretary-General for Palestine’s admission to the \r\nUnited Nations. The Security Council is now \r\nconsidering the issue, and the General Assembly will \r\nfollow suit if that is what Member States decide.  \r\n In general, I have been impressed by the fact that \r\na majority of international leaders have called for a just \r\nand comprehensive peace settlement in the Middle East \r\naimed at establishing two viable, sovereign and \r\nindependent States, Israel and Palestine, living side by \r\nside in peace and security. Building on that consensus \r\namong nations, it is my hope that at this session we \r\nwill be able to mobilize our efforts for a \r\ncomprehensive settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict, \r\nin accordance with the terms of reference and \r\ninternational law. \r\n As we gather now to consider such complex \r\nissues, it has become clear that the role of mediation is \r\nenjoying unprecedented importance. With regard to the \r\ntheme of this year’s general debate “The role of \r\nmediation in the settlement of disputes”, many \r\ndelegations have welcomed the theme and underscored \r\nthe increasing importance of the role of mediation and \r\nprevention of disputes, in accordance with the United \r\nNations Charter. Member States have shared various \r\nexamples of mediation efforts in their regions. They \r\nhave acknowledged that mediation is a cost-effective \r\ntool and that regional and subregional organizations \r\nplay a vital role in the peaceful settlement of disputes.  \r\n Member States have also noted that the effective \r\nparticipation of women in mediation efforts is \r\nabsolutely vital, and that the increased involvement of \r\ncivil society is also important and needed. In addition, \r\nwidespread support has been expressed for the \r\nSecretary-General’s efforts in conflict prevention, and \r\ncalls made for United Nations capabilities in that \r\nrespect to be enhanced. As President of the General \r\nAssembly, I will give high priority to mediation in the \r\ncoming year.  \r\n I have also welcomed the substantive discussions \r\non the peaceful settlement of disputes and by the fact \r\n A/66/PV.30\r\n \r\n15 11-51687 \r\n \r\nthat many Member States have raised issues related to \r\nthe other priority areas that I have identified for this \r\nyear. (see A/66/PV.1) \r\n On United Nations reform and revitalization, we \r\nhave heard many calls for continuing comprehensive \r\nreform of the United Nations so that it truly embodies \r\nthe spirit of universality and can more effectively \r\naddress the ever-changing global landscape. With its \r\nunique legitimacy and unparalleled convening power, \r\nthe General Assembly should proactively address \r\nmajor and emerging global issues in a forward-looking \r\nmanner. \r\n There is broad agreement on the urgent need for \r\nearly and consensual reform and expansion of the \r\nSecurity Council. Such reform is inevitable if the \r\nCouncil is to reflect our current realities and be more \r\nrepresentative, inclusive, democratic and transparent. I \r\nwould like to strongly urge Member States to revitalize \r\nthat reform process, to reaffirm their commitment to \r\nthe reform of the Security Council, and to generate the \r\npolitical will necessary to proceed in that effort in a \r\ntimely manner. I believe if any process is to succeed, it \r\nmust be based on the will and resolve of Member \r\nStates.  \r\n With regard to the topic of improving disaster \r\nprevention and response, Member States have also \r\nemphasized the importance of international \r\ncooperation in disaster prevention and recovery. Many \r\nMember States have expressed their serious concern \r\nabout the humanitarian crises plaguing the Horn of \r\nAfrica. They have identified these as a major threat to \r\nstability and prosperity in the region. At this session, \r\nMember States should draft a resolution aimed at \r\nimproving disaster prevention and response. This is a \r\nsignificant opportunity for the membership to clearly \r\ndemonstrate its commitment to addressing the grave \r\nhumanitarian situation in the Horn of Africa. As \r\nPresident of the General Assembly, I am fully \r\ncommitted to focusing the attention of the General \r\nAssembly on that humanitarian crisis.  \r\n On the two issues of sustainable development and \r\nglobal prosperity, Member States have acknowledged \r\nthe need to work cooperatively and to reflect \r\ncreatively, in particular since the world’s population \r\nwill reach 7 billion inhabitants next month. A common \r\ntopic that has emerged during the debate is the pressing \r\nneed to rethink the global approach to sustainable \r\ndevelopment, which should include the consideration \r\nof issues such as energy, water and food security.  \r\n We have also heard repeated calls for redoubled \r\nefforts and enhanced resolve to achieve progress in \r\nattaining the Millennium Development Goals. The \r\nUnited Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment will provide a significant opportunity to \r\nconsider new strategies for sustainable development \r\nand the eradication of poverty.  \r\n Many Member States have also called on the \r\nUnited Nations to address climate change by \r\nsupporting the different countries concerned and their \r\nefforts to adapt to its effects, and for developed \r\ncountries to address their emission reduction targets. \r\nThe seventeenth session of the Conference of Parties to \r\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange, to be held in Durban this year, will also \r\nprovide an opportunity to make progress in that \r\nrespect.  \r\n With regard to the ongoing global economic and \r\nfinancial crisis, there has been general \r\nacknowledgement of the central role and broad \r\nlegitimacy of the United Nations in providing solutions \r\nto the global challenges of governance. During the \r\ndebate, many Heads of State and Government have \r\ncalled on the United Nations to take the leading role in \r\nreforming the world economic and financial order.  \r\n Various other important issues have also been \r\nraised during the general debate. Member States have \r\nnoted the importance of providing adequate financial \r\nand human resources to the United Nations, as well as \r\nthe need for shared financial responsibility and fiscal \r\ndiscipline. There has also been broad support for the \r\nSecretary-General’s measures for United Nations \r\nreform. \r\n Many delegations have reaffirmed that \r\ninternational peace and security can be best served \r\nthrough the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free \r\nworld. Maintaining the highest nuclear safety and \r\nsecurity standards has also been underscored. I \r\nencourage Member States to step up their efforts to \r\nrevitalize the United Nations disarmament machinery \r\nand to promote negotiations on new disarmament \r\ninstruments within the Conference on Disarmament.  \r\n We should now turn our attention to the next \r\ncrucial step, namely, the implementation of our \r\ncommitments, in particular those of the General \r\nA/66/PV.30  \r\n \r\n11-51687 16 \r\n \r\nAssembly. That is the most important element of our \r\nwork since it is the actual translation of words into \r\ndeeds. I will focus, in particular, on the full and \r\neffective implementation of the relevant programmes \r\nof action adopted by the General Assembly in the \r\ninterests of threatened and disadvantaged States.  \r\n On the context of our shared responsibilities, we \r\nshould be eager to achieve consensus and to adopt \r\nsustainable solutions to major world challenges. I will \r\nbe steadfast in my commitment to working closely with \r\neach and every member so that we may strengthen our \r\nefforts towards a united global partnership. In heeding \r\nthe calls made by Member States during the general \r\ndebate, I will also strive at this session to focus \r\nattention on South-South and triangular cooperation, as \r\nwell as on dialogue among civilizations and advancing \r\nthe culture of peace. \r\n Permit me to end on a more personal note. As I \r\nsaid at the opening of this session, I consider the \r\nmembers of the Assembly to be my family and my \r\nfriends. I will therefore rely on their full cooperation in \r\nthe year ahead. I truly believe that the spirit of \r\nfriendship and open dialogue that has characterized our \r\nrelationship will play a vital role in implementing the \r\nagenda before us during the year. \r\n Coming together is only the start. Working \r\ntogether, we will complete our task. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n May I take it that it is the wish of the General \r\nAssembly to conclude its consideration of agenda \r\nitem 8? \r\n It was so decided.  \r\n  The meeting rose at 7.50 p.m. \r\n"
