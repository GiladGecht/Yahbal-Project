(Qatar) \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.  \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 110 (continued) \r\n \r\nReport of the Secretary-General on the work of  \r\nthe Organization (A/66/1) \r\n \r\n The President: Members will recall that the \r\nSecretary-General presented his annual report (A/66/1) \r\nto the General Assembly at its 11th plenary meeting, on \r\n21 September. \r\n Mr. Nishida (Japan): First of all, I would like to \r\nbegin by congratulating you, Sir, on your assumption \r\nof duties as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-sixth session. Japan highly respects your strong \r\nleadership during the current session and reaffirms its \r\ncommitment to contribute to your work. Let me also \r\nconvey to His Excellency Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon Japan’s deep appreciation for his tireless \r\nefforts in guiding the diverse activities of the United \r\nNations and for his latest report on the work of the \r\nOrganization (A/66/1).  \r\n I have distributed copies of my written statement \r\nin the Hall, so I will make my oral statement concise \r\nby focusing on the elements that I find most important. \r\n As the Secretary-General mentioned several \r\ntimes in his report, this has been a year of \r\nextraordinary challenges for my country, Japan. As six \r\nmonths have passed since the great East Japan \r\nearthquake, Japan reiterates her sincere gratitude for \r\nthe helping hands extended from all over the world. \r\nThe Government of Japan has been utilizing all of its \r\nresources to restore and reconstruct the disaster-\r\naffected areas. At Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power \r\nstations, efforts are being made to move up the existing \r\ntarget period in order to achieve cold shutdown status \r\nby the end of the calendar year.  \r\n Although some countries are, regrettably, still \r\nimposing undue restrictions on imports from Japan, our \r\nGovernment will continue to provide prompt and \r\naccurate information on this matter, with maximum \r\ntransparency. \r\n Foremost among the challenges confronting the \r\nUnited Nations is the achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). In order to achieve the \r\nMDGs by the target date of 2015, the global \r\ncommunity must demonstrate clear political will and \r\nwork together with all stakeholders to deliver concrete \r\nresults in the remaining period. For its part, Japan \r\nreiterates its unshaken commitment to the MDGs, \r\nfocusing in particular on health and education. \r\n With regard to human security, a significant step \r\nforward was the adoption in July 2010 of resolution \r\n64/291, entitled “Follow-up to paragraph 143 on \r\nhuman security of the 2005 World Summit Outcome”. \r\nBased on that resolution, a report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral will be issued during the sixty-sixth session, \r\nand Japan hopes to discuss this very important subject \r\nin the General Assembly. \r\n United Nations peacekeeping operations \r\nrepresent the realization of the most fundamental \r\nprinciples of the Organization. Japan is eager to \r\ncontribute to the United Nations Mission in South \r\nA/66/PV.31  \r\n \r\n11-52968 2 \r\n \r\nSudan in the fields in which it excels. That will include \r\ndispatching Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) \r\npersonnel to Mission headquarters as staff officers and \r\npossibly sending a JSDF engineering unit after \r\nnecessary field study. \r\n Japan continues to work to support and advance a \r\nseamless approach to peacebuilding. The Peacebuilding \r\nCommission has the mandate to promote such an \r\nintegrated strategy with the aim of disrupting the \r\nvicious circle of conflict and poverty and to fill some \r\nof the most conspicuous gaps. \r\n The United Nations must also play a proactive \r\nrole in the Middle East peace process. Japan fully \r\nunderstands the earnest aspirations of Palestinians to \r\nbuild their own nation and strongly hopes for an \r\nimmediate resumption of direct negotiations between \r\nthe parties. Japan calls on all concerned to refrain from \r\nany provocative actions that could impede the peace \r\nprocess. A complete freeze on settlement activities is \r\nessential in that connection. Japan is committed to \r\ncontribute continuously to the efforts of the \r\ninternational community for the realization of a two-\r\nState solution. \r\n As regards a new Libya, it is essential that the \r\ninternational community provide continued support. \r\nJapan commends United Nations leadership in the \r\ncoordination of international assistance. Japan will \r\nsupport the country’s nation-building efforts, utilizing \r\nits expertise and technological capacity. In that regard, \r\nJapan decided to contribute $2 million through the \r\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross and to \r\nsupport the initial release of up to $1.5 billion of frozen \r\nLibyan assets. \r\n In our efforts to promote global peace and \r\nsecurity, nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation is \r\na primary goal for all nations, including Japan. That is \r\nwhy Japan will again this year submit a draft resolution \r\ncalling for united actions towards the total elimination \r\nof nuclear weapons. \r\n Our ultimate goal regarding climate change is an \r\nexpeditious adoption of a new, single and \r\ncomprehensive legal document that will establish a fair \r\nand effective international framework in which all \r\nmajor economies participate. To that end, it is \r\nimportant to make progress at the upcoming \r\nseventeenth Conference of the Parties to the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change in \r\nDurban.  \r\n International support should be seamlessly \r\nimplemented beyond 2012. Japan will continue to \r\ncontribute, including through the early establishment of \r\nthe Green Climate Fund. Japan believes that a \r\ntransition to a green economy is an effective and \r\nappropriate approach to achieve sustainable \r\ndevelopment. In that regard, the United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development should \r\nprovide the opportunity to express the determination \r\nand concrete policies necessary for the transition to a \r\ngreen economy. \r\n In the area of human rights, Japan remains \r\ncommitted to its active role in the discussions in the \r\nGeneral Assembly, the Third Committee and the \r\nHuman Rights Council. The work and the functions of \r\nthe Human Rights Council should be continuously \r\nreviewed. \r\n Gender equality and the empowerment of women \r\nmust be actively integrated into the work of the United \r\nNations. Having seen the establishment of UN-Women \r\nin the past year, we view the current momentum as \r\nopportune for renewal of our commitment to promoting \r\nthe advancement of gender equality and women’s \r\nempowerment. \r\n Comprehensive reform of the United Nations \r\ncannot be considered successful without the \r\nachievement of substantive Security Council reform. \r\nThe intergovernmental negotiations held during the \r\nAssembly’s sixty-fifth session provided increased \r\nmomentum to that endeavour. We must accelerate the \r\nstagnated reform process with proactive commitment \r\nand a great sense of urgency. To that end, \r\nMr. President, we are counting on your keen awareness \r\nof the need for early reform of the Security Council \r\nand your outstanding leadership to bring the process \r\nforward in a transparent manner, in order to achieve a \r\nconcrete outcome during the current session. \r\n The intractable stagnation of the world economy \r\nat present has adversely affected the financial situation \r\nof Member States. Mindful of our efforts to ensure \r\ntransparent, accountable and efficient management of \r\nthe United Nations, we call for rationalization of the \r\nSecretariat. Redeployment of existing resources should \r\nbe the first approach in addressing newly mandated \r\nfunding requirements. In the forthcoming consultations \r\non the 2012-2013 proposed programme budget and the \r\npeacekeeping operations mission budget, utmost \r\nattention must be paid to financial discipline and cost-\r\n A/66/PV.31\r\n \r\n3 11-52968 \r\n \r\neffectiveness. In that regard, Japan welcomes the \r\nefforts made by the Secretary-General to reduce the \r\nlevel of his proposed programme budget by 3 per cent. \r\n I close today by affirming once more Japan’s \r\nwillingness to participate in and firm commitment to \r\nthe efforts to ensure a more effective and efficient \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n Mr. Wang Min (China) (spoke in Chinese): The \r\nChinese delegation welcomes the report of Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon on the work of the Organization \r\n(A/66/1).  \r\n At present the world is undergoing major \r\ndevelopment, transformation and change. Multipolarization \r\nand economic globalization are deepening. New \r\nchanges have appeared in global economic governance. \r\nAt the same time, the profound impact of the \r\ninternational financial crisis has yet to be eliminated, \r\nand economic recovery is still faced with uncertainties. \r\nIn addition, the debt crisis remains acute and bulk \r\ncommodity prices continue to rise. The international \r\nsecurity situation has become more and more \r\ncomplicated, and regional hot spots keep appearing. \r\nSituations in West Asia and in North Africa are still \r\nturbulent. \r\n Over the past year, faced with multifaceted \r\nthreats and challenges, the United Nations has actively \r\npromoted multilateral cooperation. It has played an \r\nimportant role in implementing the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), responding to natural \r\ndisasters, providing humanitarian relief, deploying \r\npeacekeeping operations, facilitating post-conflict \r\nreconstruction and addressing issues related to climate \r\nchange and global health. In addition, it has done a lot \r\nin areas such as safeguarding energy and food security, \r\ncombating terrorism and protecting human rights. \r\n Here I take the opportunity to express my \r\ndelegation’s appreciation to the Secretary-General for \r\nhis hard and outstanding work over the past year.  \r\n The world is currently at a new critical juncture \r\nin its development efforts. Sustainable development \r\nremains an arduous task. The unevenness in North-\r\nSouth development is still pronounced. Achieving the \r\nMDGs is a pressing issue.  \r\n The United Nations should play a leading and \r\ncentral role in international development. The most \r\nurgent task is to implement the various objectives and \r\nprogrammes. We should pay particular attention to the \r\nspecial difficulties of the developing countries.  \r\n Next year the United Nations will hold the United \r\nNations Conference on Sustainable Development in \r\nBrazil, which will have a major impact on the \r\ninternational environment and development agenda. \r\nChina hopes that the Conference will take stock of \r\ninternational cooperation in those fields over the past \r\ntwo decades, galvanize consensus and take specific \r\nactions to promote the global cause of sustainable \r\ndevelopment. \r\n The Conference and the preparatory process \r\nshould carry forward the Rio spirit and principles of \r\nthe 1992 Conference in Rio, especially the principle of \r\ncommon but differentiated responsibilities, and \r\npromote progress in the three pillars of sustainable \r\ndevelopment in a balanced and coordinated fashion. At \r\nthe same time, they should respect the autonomy of \r\nStates in pursuit of sustainable development and pay \r\nspecial attention to the concerns of developing States.  \r\n Over the past few years food security has been a \r\nbig challenge. The most severe drought in the past \r\n60 years is occurring in the Horn of Africa, leading to \r\nwidespread starvation. Food security has bearing not \r\nonly on the economies and livelihoods of countries and \r\ntheir people, but also on global development and \r\nsecurity.  \r\n The unequal balance between food supply and \r\ndemand is detrimental to the realization of sustainable \r\npeace in the world and common prosperity. To \r\nsafeguard food security in the world, the international \r\ncommunity should adopt the principle of common \r\ndevelopment and take effective measures for \r\ncoordination, stabilize the prices of bulk commodities \r\nsuch as food, and prevent excessive speculation. \r\n The United Nations is the most universal \r\nrepresentative and authoritative international, \r\nintergovernmental organization. It is also the platform \r\non which to practice multilateralism. Since its \r\nfounding, the United Nations has played an \r\nirreplaceable role in maintaining world peace and \r\npromoting common development.  \r\n In light of the changing international situation, \r\nChina supports the conduct of necessary and \r\nreasonable reform by the United Nations so as to \r\nenhance the Organization’s authority and efficiency \r\nand to respond to new challenges and threats, and thus \r\nA/66/PV.31  \r\n \r\n11-52968 4 \r\n \r\nto better implement the obligations entrusted by the \r\nUnited Nations Charter. That is based on the United \r\nNations need for self-perfection and development. It is \r\nalso the common vision and expectation of its \r\nMembers.  \r\n United Nations reform should be all-dimensional \r\nand multisectoral. It should also achieve good results \r\nin the field of development and give necessary \r\nguarantees, in mechanisms and resources, to promote \r\nthe realization of the MDGs, so that the majority of \r\ndeveloping countries can benefit from the reform.  \r\n This year is the fortieth anniversary of the \r\nPeople’s Republic of China’s resumption of its \r\nlegitimate membership in the United Nations. Over the \r\npast 40 years China has participated comprehensively, \r\nactively and deeply in United Nations affairs. The level \r\nof cooperation between the two parties has been \r\nincreasing and the areas of cooperation have been \r\nexpanding, and good results have been achieved.  \r\n China has all along advocated for, and supported, \r\nthe United Nations to play a central role in \r\ninternational affairs and has made unremitting efforts \r\nto that end. As always, China will continue to abide by \r\nthe purposes and principles of the United Nations \r\nCharter and support the Organization in displaying its \r\nadvantages so that it will become an envoy in \r\nmaintaining world peace, a pioneer for common \r\ndevelopment and an example for international \r\ncooperation.  \r\n China will continue to actively undertake its \r\ninternational obligations to the best of its abilities, \r\nadhere to the path of peaceful development, follow an \r\nindependent and peaceful foreign policy, be committed \r\nto creating a peaceful international environment, and \r\nfacilitate the common development of the world. \r\n Mr. Srivali (Thailand): During the past few \r\nyears, the world has undergone multiple crises, natural \r\nand man-made. Often, such crises have demanded \r\ncollective responses, and the international community \r\nhas admirably risen to the occasion. However, some \r\ncrises are more complex and have defied easy \r\nsolutions. Early warning, monitoring and preventive \r\nmechanisms are desirable but are not always easy to \r\nimplement. The United Nations thus continues to be \r\nindispensable in setting common goals and leading the \r\ncoordination of international efforts.  \r\n As its Member States, we must each play our part \r\nin supporting the work of this institution, for, as \r\nimperfect as it may be, it remains our best hope in the \r\nface of the new challenges that will surely come our \r\nway. \r\n Thailand concurs with the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the work of the Organization (A/66/1). We \r\nagree that we must find innovative ways to deal \r\neffectively with the current challenges and work \r\ntogether with States and non-State partners to prepare \r\nfor the many tests ahead. Most importantly, Thailand \r\ncommends the Secretary-General for prioritizing the \r\nneed to deliver results to those most in need, and for \r\nemphasizing the need to promote sustainable \r\ndevelopment well beyond 2015, the agreed date for the \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals. \r\n The demands placed on the United Nations \r\nindeed constitute a tall order, especially given resource \r\nconstraints and often complex and unpredictable \r\nconditions. Nevertheless, Thailand firmly believes that \r\nthe United Nations, as an indispensable institution, can \r\nand must adapt to deliver the results expected of it. \r\n On the topic of delivering results for those most \r\nin need, I would like to share some of Thailand’s \r\nviews. \r\n First, sustainable development must place people \r\nat the centre. National and community-level ownership \r\nmust be promoted. Development models must go \r\nbeyond aggregate numbers but be nuanced enough to \r\ntake into account specific local contexts and real needs. \r\n Secondly, in post-crisis reconstruction, \r\ninternational assistance should be guided by a long-\r\nterm view. Domestic institutions must be strengthened \r\nso that they have the capacity to deliver services to \r\nthose in need long after the international news crews \r\nand the aid workers have left the scene. \r\n Thirdly, good governance ensures effective \r\nadministration and policy implementation. Communication \r\nshould be two-way, so that the people are kept well \r\ninformed and are well and truly heard. \r\n Fourthly, international cooperation — whether \r\nNorth-South, South-South, bilateral or triangular — is \r\nvital for the exchange of knowledge, best practices and \r\nskills. The United Nations can do much to facilitate \r\nthat process, especially in the areas of disaster-risk \r\nreduction and post-disaster response. \r\n A/66/PV.31\r\n \r\n5 11-52968 \r\n \r\n In facing global crises, natural or man-made, the \r\nUnited Nations should strive to be a builder of trust, \r\nbuilding on its unique global membership and \r\ncomprehensive work agenda. Trust among nations and \r\nin the United Nations system is necessary to ensure the \r\nsmooth, effective and expeditious delivery of results. \r\n In this light, Thailand supports reform of the \r\nUnited Nations to strengthen its effectiveness, \r\naccountability and transparency, as well as to \r\nencourage and ensure greater participation of all \r\nMember States. \r\n Regarding the work of the Organization, Member \r\nStates should be closely consulted and kept informed \r\non the work and initiatives of the Secretariat, United \r\nNations mandate holders, agencies, funds and \r\nprogrammes on a regular basis and in a transparent \r\nmanner. \r\n Furthermore, close consultations between the \r\nUnited Nations country team and the Government \r\nconcerned regarding the country programme will \r\nensure that the activities of the United Nations on the \r\nground truly reflect priority needs and that their \r\nimplementation yields optimal results. \r\n In closing, I would like to reiterate Thailand’s \r\nsupport for the realization of the vision that the \r\nSecretary-General has outlined in his comprehensive \r\nreport. \r\n Mr. Khan (Indonesia): On behalf of my \r\ndelegation, allow me first of all to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report on the work of the Organization. \r\nWe share many of his assessments of the current world \r\nsituation and the activities of the United Nations during \r\nthe past year. \r\n However, we must ensure that the United Nations \r\ndelivers. We must deliver in order to achieve the \r\nMDGs and other internationally agreed development \r\ngoals. We must deliver to bring peace to places of \r\nconflict. And, we must deliver to promote human \r\nrights, the rule of law and democracy. It is in this \r\ncontext that my delegation welcomes the report before \r\nus (A/66/1), which focuses on three critical areas. I \r\nwish to take this opportunity to share some thoughts on \r\neach of those three issues. \r\n First, in order for the United Nations to deliver \r\nresults to the people, addressing development is key. \r\nThe global partnership on development is of vital \r\nimportance because of the fast approaching deadline of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). It is even \r\nmore vital because of the persistent effects of the \r\neconomic and financial crisis, together with high food \r\nand energy prices. \r\n In that regard, we must continue to encourage all \r\npartners, including developed countries, international \r\norganizations and international financial institutions, to \r\nwork together to ensure the achievement of MDG \r\ntargets. The volatile food crisis and the impact of \r\nclimate change have exacerbated the situation in \r\nAfrica, particularly in the Horn of Africa. \r\n While we fully concur with the need to increase \r\ndevelopment assistance to Africa, we should also find \r\nan effective way to translate our pledges into specific \r\nand concrete programmes targeted specifically at the \r\nimmediate needs of the continent. \r\n With regard to peace and security, we must make \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping missions reliable at all \r\ntimes and under all conditions. We must ensure \r\navailability of their equipment and other resources, as \r\nwell as adequate training of personnel, so that they will \r\nbe equal to the complexity of their mandated tasks. \r\n We continue to face natural disasters that create \r\nunprecedented humanitarian challenges requiring \r\ninternational response. We must build a robust \r\nemergency response and disaster preparedness scheme \r\nas a long-term investment that will contribute to the \r\nachievement of humanitarian and development \r\nobjectives. \r\n We need to reaffirm that all human rights are \r\nuniversal, indivisible, interdependent and inter-related, \r\nand must therefore be treated in a fair and equal \r\nmanner, on the same footing, and with the same \r\nemphasis.  \r\n While welcoming the commitments and various \r\nmeasures undertaken by Governments to reform and \r\nmeet the demands of the people, we are concerned \r\nabout the escalation of tension and violence. We \r\nunderline the need for an inclusive and people-led \r\npolitical process aimed at effectively addressing the \r\nlegitimate aspirations of citizens. \r\n Secondly, in securing global goods, even with the \r\npromising progress on climate change, there is still \r\nmuch that has to be achieved between now and the \r\nUnited Nations Climate Change Conference in Durban \r\nlater this year. What is of the most concern is the \r\ndownward spiral we are witnessing in the negotiations \r\nA/66/PV.31  \r\n \r\n11-52968 6 \r\n \r\nsince the United Nations Climate Change Conference \r\nin Cancún in 2010. This is the most crucial year for \r\nclimate change negotiations. \r\n Public health issues constitute the major \r\ncomponent of the MDGs, in terms of nutrition, \r\nmaternal health, child health, water and sanitation, as \r\nwell as HIV/AIDS and other communicable diseases. \r\nFurthermore, poverty alleviation and gender \r\nmainstreaming are closely linked to public health \r\nintervention. \r\n We are remained concerned that each year, \r\nmillions of women and children die of preventable \r\ncauses. Consequently, we must make a decisive move \r\ntogether to improve the health of every woman and \r\nevery child around the world. \r\n We are further concerned about the many forms \r\nof threat to international peace and security. We are \r\nworried that the continued existence of nuclear \r\nweapons and the increasing arms race cast a shadow \r\nover the stability and security of the world. \r\n We are alarmed by continued terrorist acts around \r\nthe globe. However, all measures to counter terrorism \r\nmust be consistent with the rule of law and a deep and \r\nabiding respect for human rights. They must be in \r\naccordance with international law, including the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. \r\n We believe that reinvigorated multilateral \r\ndisarmament diplomacy with enhanced engagement by \r\nall relevant stakeholders, including civil society, could \r\ngalvanize political power.  \r\n Thirdly, we can only create a stronger United \r\nNations, if we have a reformed Organization. We must \r\npersevere in strengthening the General Assembly, the \r\nEconomic and Social Council and their subsidiary \r\norgans, as well as the Human Rights Council. The \r\nPeacebuilding Commission should play a stronger role \r\nin helping countries emerging from conflict. As to the \r\nSecurity Council, it needs to be reformed to reflect the \r\ncurrent world situation and to make it more \r\nrepresentative, accountable and effective. \r\n We are very much appreciative of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s effort to strengthen the Organization by \r\noverseeing a strategy to promote gender balance and by \r\nadopting various policies designed to empower and \r\npromote women in the Secretariat. \r\n We consider system-wide coherence as an \r\nintegrated process, instead of a divided one. We believe \r\nthat all five relevant areas within the system-wide \r\ncoherence are strongly interconnected and need to be \r\ndiscussed in a comprehensive and balanced manner. \r\n We also believe that cooperation and partnership \r\nbetween the United Nations and regional organizations \r\nare key in addressing today’s global challenges. As \r\nChair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \r\n(ASEAN), we are also ready and willing to enter into a \r\nstrategic partnership with the United Nations. We will \r\nlend our efforts to develop greater cohesion and a \r\ncommon platform on global issues in order to pursue \r\nthe goal of an ASEAN community within a global \r\ncommunity of nations. \r\n We acknowledge that the formulation and \r\nimplementation of global policy cannot be achieved by \r\nGovernments alone. The role of civil society and the \r\nbusiness community is essential. If we want our work \r\nto achieve the goals of the United Nations, engagement \r\nand partnership with them are required. \r\n Let me conclude on a more personal note. If we \r\nmaintain a spirit of friendship and open dialogue, we \r\nwill be able to advance the agenda before us at the \r\nsixty-sixth session of the General Assembly. In this \r\nrespect, Mr. President, you can count on the \r\ncooperation and support of my delegation. \r\n Mr. Nkombela (South Africa): My delegation \r\nwould like to thank the Secretary-General for his report \r\ncontained in document A/66/1. I wish to refer to the \r\nfollowing elements of the Secretary-General’s report. \r\n My delegation would like to re-emphasize the \r\nfact that development is impossible without the \r\nempowerment of women. The United Nations should \r\nput women at the centre of development so as to \r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals. \r\n The United Nations should continue to prioritize \r\nthe development needs of Africa in its pursuit for \r\nsustainable and inclusive economic growth. This year \r\nmarks the tenth anniversary of the New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD), which is the \r\ncontinent’s premier framework for economic, social \r\nand political advancement. The past ten years have \r\nprovided increased confidence and hope about what is \r\nachievable in Africa. The Organization’s support for \r\nthe efforts to achieve the successful implementation of \r\nNEPAD is therefore prudent. \r\n A/66/PV.31\r\n \r\n7 11-52968 \r\n \r\n My delegation commends the United Nations in \r\nits support of national authorities in the area of \r\nhumanitarian assistance. We would encourage it to \r\nredouble its efforts to provide humanitarian assistance \r\nto the Horn of Africa, which, owing to drought, is \r\nexperiencing the most severe food crisis in the world \r\ntoday. \r\n South Africa will host the Conference of the \r\nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention \r\non Climate Change in Durban from 28 November to \r\n9 December. The question we in the Organization need \r\nto focus on is how to deal with the issue of the second \r\ncommitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. The \r\noutcome should guarantee progress and produce some \r\nsense of the legal framework vis-à-vis both the Kyoto \r\nProtocol and the Convention. That is the most pressing \r\nissue. Substantive progress is also needed on the means \r\nof implementation, especially on the set of finance-\r\nrelated issues, which includes the design of the Green \r\nClimate Fund and the functions of the Standing \r\nCommittee, as well as sources of funding and the scale \r\nof finance. \r\n My delegation is concerned about the continuing \r\nstalemate in the disarmament machinery of the United \r\nNations. One of the outcomes of the first Special \r\nSession on Disarmament (SSOD-I) was recognition of \r\nthe need for “a single multilateral disarmament \r\nnegotiating forum of limited size taking decisions on \r\nthe basis of consensus” (resolution S-10/2, para. 120), \r\nnamely, the Conference on Disarmament. In the light \r\nof the past achievements of the Conference, it is \r\nregrettable that that institution has for many years now \r\nfailed to fulfil its basic mandate. As a result of the \r\ncontinuing deadlock, many have understandably started \r\nto question the Conference’s relevance and value as a \r\nforum for pursuing disarmament goals. \r\n Another result of SSOD-I was the establishment \r\nof the United Nations Disarmament Commission as a \r\ndeliberative body on disarmament and subsidiary organ \r\nof the General Assembly. The Commission is also not \r\nfulfilling its mandate, and this year again failed to \r\nproduce any concrete recommendations. My delegation \r\nconsiders this an unfortunate trend in an Organization \r\nlike ours that was established with the aim of ensuring \r\ninternational peace and security. \r\n It is my delegation’s opinion that there can be no \r\ndevelopment without peace. In that context, we would \r\nlike to stress the need for a more concerted \r\ninternational effort to promote peace and security, \r\nparticularly in Africa. The United Nations should \r\nrecognize the need to develop a strong partnership with \r\nthe African Union and its subregional organizations in \r\norder to encourage an early response to disputes and \r\nemerging conflicts. It is also important that the \r\nSecurity Council be reformed so that it reflects global \r\ngeopolitical realities. The African and Latin American \r\ncontinents have waited too long to gain permanent \r\nrepresentation. \r\n In conclusion, we thank the Secretary-General \r\nand the Secretariat for their service to this institution. \r\n Mr. Abdelaziz (Egypt): At the outset, I would \r\nlike to thank the Secretary-General for his valuable \r\nreport on the work of the Organization (A/66/1), which \r\nreflects his clear vision and firm determination to \r\nenhance multilateralism and strengthen the role and \r\nauthority of the United Nations. As this report is the \r\nSecretary-General’s last report on his first term in \r\noffice, and comes on the heels of his second term, I \r\nwould like once again to congratulate him on the \r\nconfidence of Member States that resulted in his \r\nunanimous appointment to a second term. \r\n Over the year covered in the report, the \r\nSecretary-General has shown leadership and \r\ndetermination in dealing with many of the issues in the \r\ninternational arena, from supporting the results of the \r\nfree and fair elections in Côte d’Ivoire; to backing the \r\nreturn to normalcy in Somalia and Afghanistan and \r\nmany other parts of the world; to playing a leading role \r\nin the search for a solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict, \r\nto name only a few. His support of Egypt after the \r\nrevolution of 25 January is yet another milestone in his \r\nachievements. We thank him for his visit in March, \r\nwhich opened the door for much-needed support from \r\nthe United Nations for the transitional Government’s \r\nefforts to return life to normalcy and establish solid \r\nfoundations for a democratic society that has full \r\nrespect for human rights and fundamental freedoms \r\nand applies the rule of law. \r\n Over the few days of the high-level segment of \r\nthis session, the Secretary-General convened eight \r\nhigh-level meetings, on both a thematic and a country \r\nbasis, setting a new record for a proactive approach \r\nthat should be followed — from dealing with terrorism, \r\nto nuclear safety and security, to enhancing the \r\neffectiveness of the disarmament machinery, to human \r\ntrafficking and to extensive discussions of situations in \r\nA/66/PV.31  \r\n \r\n11-52968 8 \r\n \r\nmany countries around the world. We greatly \r\nappreciate the Secretary-General’s initiative in that \r\nregard. \r\n What do we now expect from the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in the first year of his second term? We expect \r\nfull support for the establishment of a sovereign, \r\nindependent Palestinian State, with East Jerusalem as \r\nits capital, a State that is a full Member of the United \r\nNations, in fulfilment of a long-overdue international \r\ncommitment. We expect speedy progress, working \r\nalong with the three depositary States of the Treaty on \r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, in selecting \r\na facilitator and a host country that enjoy the consensus \r\nof the regional countries, and to proceed energetically \r\nwith convening a 2012 conference on establishing a \r\nzone free of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass \r\ndestruction in the Middle East. We expect redoubled \r\nattention to Africa’s developmental needs and those of \r\nthe least-developed countries. We expect more \r\nconcerted efforts on the part of the United Nations and \r\nthe international community to assist the Republic of \r\nSouth Sudan in building its national capacities in \r\nvarious fields. \r\n We expect a proactive approach that will ensure \r\nthe success of the 2012 United Nations Conference on \r\nSustainable Development and set in motion an active \r\naction plan towards sustainable development, based on \r\nits three pillars. We expect a successful conclusion at \r\nthe coming Conference of the Parties to the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change in \r\nDurban that will save our planet. We expect reform of \r\ngovernance structures at the international level that \r\nwill enhance the voice and participation of developing \r\ncountries in the United Nations and enhance the \r\nOrganization’s role vis-à-vis other emerging structures. \r\n We expect more attention to be paid to younger \r\ngenerations and their education, training and \r\nemployment. We expect a strong drive towards full \r\nrespect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, \r\nand more coordinated efforts to combat terrorism and \r\norganized crime, and to deepen the roots of \r\nunderstanding between civilizations and religions. \r\n The expectations are very high, and cover a wide \r\nrange of issues, not all of which I can touch on here. \r\nBut Egypt trusts that the Secretary-General is keeping \r\nan eye on each of them, and will spare no effort to \r\nachieve them. For him to succeed, however, we need a \r\nstrong political commitment from each and every one \r\nof us to achieving those objectives and more, and to \r\nkeeping the United Nations at the core of \r\nmultilateralism. \r\n Mr. Diallo (Senegal) (spoke in French): I should \r\nlike to take the opportunity afforded, at the start of the \r\nsession, by the review of the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the work of the Organization (A/66/1) to \r\nonce again congratulate you warmly, Mr. President, on \r\nbehalf of my delegation, on your election to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth \r\nsession. As you strive to fulfil your exciting mission, \r\nSir, you can count on the active support of the \r\nSenegalese delegation. \r\n All the thinking that we shared during the general \r\ndebate only a few days ago calls for a new way of \r\nthinking and acting by the international community in \r\ncrafting bold solutions with a view to freeing our world \r\nfrom the many base actions that prevent humankind \r\nfrom thriving. In that respect, it appears clear to us that \r\nwe need to take a closer look at mediation paths so that \r\nwe can, on the one hand, prevent conflicts with their \r\nalways tragic consequences, and, on the other, wrestle \r\ndown the exorbitant costs of peacekeeping operations. \r\nHere, emphasis should be placed on the underlying \r\ncauses of crises by combating, in particular, cross-\r\nborder crime, drug trafficking, the illicit flow of arms \r\nand all forms of human rights violations, while at the \r\nsame time promoting good governance and democracy. \r\n While it is undeniable that as a result of such \r\nactivities the United Nations is the crucial platform in \r\nthe search for solutions to existing concerns, we must \r\nrecognize that, given the complexity of emerging \r\nchallenges, any weakness, slowness or negligence \r\nmight undermine the effectiveness of the creditable \r\nactions that we conduct. \r\n Accordingly, we should pay particular attention \r\nto the changes that have occurred in the Middle East, \r\nwhich will certainly have a decisive impact on peace \r\nand stability in the region. As a universal Organization, \r\nthe United Nations has the main responsibility to use \r\nits prerogatives to find optimal responses to the \r\nobstacles before us in our ongoing quest for peace. We \r\nmust break through the status quo to find vital \r\nsolutions for creating conditions for coexistence in \r\npeace and security between Israelis and Palestinians.  \r\n That will without a doubt require the \r\nestablishment next to Israel of an independent, \r\nsovereign and viable Palestinian State, in secure and \r\n A/66/PV.31\r\n \r\n9 11-52968 \r\n \r\ninternationally recognized borders. That is the only \r\npossible means of salvation in the region.  \r\n We welcome the determined action of the \r\ninternational community that has allowed our sister \r\nrepublic of Côte d’Ivoire to emerge, finally, from the \r\nimpasse that it was in as a result of 10 years of crisis, \r\nwith disastrous consequences for the entire West \r\nAfrican subregion. Similarly, thanks to our joint \r\nefforts, the security situation in a number of African \r\ncountries, particularly in Guinea, Guinea-Bissau and \r\nthe Sudan, has made significant progress.  \r\n But that progress must not cause us to lose sight \r\nof the tragic situation in Somalia, which deserves \r\ngreater attention from us. Saving future generations \r\nfrom the scourge of war requires that we be determined \r\nto promote and protect human rights, as we can see in \r\nthe major upheavals throughout the world. In fact, we \r\nhave a common responsibility to act so that the \r\natrocities resulting from the commission of serious \r\ncrimes of violence do not recur. We must also work for \r\nthe emergence of an international criminal justice that \r\nis effective, just, impartial and apolitical. \r\n It would also be appropriate, even though \r\nsatisfactory progress has been made, to ask how the \r\nUnited Nations intervenes in its theatres of operation \r\nand to pursue reforms already undertaken for greater \r\neffectiveness of peacekeeping operations, which should \r\nbe part of peacebuilding. Without sustainable peace, all \r\nefforts at development are doomed to failure. In that \r\nrespect, we should mobilize our efforts to ensure the \r\nadoption in 2012 of a robust arms trade treaty. \r\n Today more than ever, the globalization of crises \r\nthat transcend borders reminds us of the vital need for \r\na multilateral approach, one that is more engaged and \r\ninclusive, if we wish to have a positive collective \r\nimpact on the future of humankind. In truth, more than \r\na need, it is for us an urgent necessity that we rethink \r\nand reformulate the methods and means of action that \r\nhave guided us up to now. \r\n As the Secretary-General says in his report, we \r\nare struck by the observation that our progress has been \r\ntimid in our common objective of achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015. It \r\nhas been clearly established that we can now succeed \r\nonly if we are effective in honouring our commitments \r\nwithin the existing frameworks and partnerships in \r\norder to, inter alia, manage debt, promote free and \r\nequitable trade, improve the volume, quality and \r\nmechanisms for providing assistance, and facilitate \r\naccess to modern technologies. \r\n What is most important for us in Africa is \r\nre-establishing a global order where our continent \r\nwould fully play the role that it should have. In that \r\nrespect, the Secretary-General is correct in affirming \r\nthat Africans need neither pity nor charity; what they \r\ndo need are the tools that would allow them to create \r\njobs and income. Transparency, openness, inclusion — \r\nthose should be the key words of the new order that we \r\nwish to build together. \r\n In conclusion, Mr. President, I would like to \r\nshare with you the conviction that, if we are united in \r\none and the same movement, we will be in a better \r\nposition to prevent the risks of disaster and reach a new \r\nglobal agreement on climate change. There can be no \r\ndenying ─ those are the challenges and threats of the \r\ntwenty-first century. Similarly, we should do \r\neverything we can to succeed in our crusade against \r\nterrorism by, among other things, getting down to \r\nadopting a global convention on that subject. The \r\nchallenges are, of course, enormous, but the wager can \r\nbe won if we match the complexity of the task with \r\nfaith and commitment. \r\n Mr. Rosenthal (Guatemala) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nWe thank the Secretary-General for his report, which \r\nhe presented to us, as he does every year, under the \r\nsymbol A/66/1. We agree with him that we are living in \r\na time of global transition and, we would add, \r\nuncertainty. Certainly, to paraphrase the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, the status quo is being weakened, and we are \r\nmoving towards something new, the precise contours \r\nof which have not yet emerged.  \r\n Economies that were traditional leaders of the \r\nworld economy are now facing serious structural \r\nproblems, which tends to reduce their performance. At \r\nthe same time, some emerging economies appear to be \r\nreplacing the traditional leaders as the drivers of world \r\neconomic growth. The gap that separates the poorest \r\nfifth of the world from the richest tenth appears to be \r\ngrowing, adding new reasons for the frustrations of \r\ntens of millions of persons, especially youth, who feel \r\ndisplaced and without a future. \r\n In addition, over the brief time that has elapsed \r\nsince the report was first circulated, short-term \r\nprospects for the world economy have worsened, in the \r\nlight of the indicators from both the European Union \r\nand the United States of America. Again, just as \r\nA/66/PV.31  \r\n \r\n11-52968 10 \r\n \r\nhappened in 2008 and 2009, there is a danger that those \r\ntrends will extend to the rest of the global economy. \r\n At the same time, the displaced persons alluded \r\nto earlier have acquired a voice they never had before, \r\nthanks to the new communications technologies at their \r\ndisposal. We are observing unprecedented changes in \r\nsome countries, where structures of authoritarian \r\npower, carefully built over decades, are giving way to \r\nthe voice of the previously displaced, who demand a \r\nbetter future. That constitutes a source of hope for \r\nsome of us, and a threat to stability for others. Change, \r\nafter all, always entails risks, but also opportunities. \r\n There are other unprecedented phenomena. All \r\nhumankind is facing a challenge whose presence was \r\ndiscernible for a number of decades, but which is now \r\nmaking itself evident with more tangible impacts. We \r\nrefer to the irreversible harm we are inflicting on our \r\ncommon habitat, the earth, not only by preying on its \r\nnatural resources, but also through the emission of \r\ngreenhouse gases, which have been shown to have \r\ndisastrous consequences on the environment. The \r\nabnormal number of droughts, on the one hand, and \r\ntorrential floods, on the other, which have stressed to \r\nthe limits the resources of the humanitarian aid that the \r\nUnited Nations provides, is yet another tangible \r\nmanifestation of this phenomenon. \r\n Finally, on matters of peace and security, we face \r\na panorama that, in the best of cases, can be \r\ncharacterized as consisting of lights and shadows. \r\nWhile some progress has been achieved in the fight \r\nagainst terrorism, new hot spots of indiscriminate \r\nviolence flare in places such as Afghanistan and \r\nPakistan, along with a resurgence of piracy on the high \r\nseas. While we celebrate the peaceful solution of a \r\nlongstanding dispute, reflected in the creation of the \r\nnew State, South Sudan, new outbreaks of tension are \r\nappearing, both in Africa and in the Middle East. \r\n This translates into a complex and packed agenda \r\nfor the United Nations, in all its dimensions: \r\nmaintaining peace and security, defending human \r\nrights, promoting sustainable and long-term \r\ndevelopment, providing humanitarian assistance and \r\nresponding to new challenges, which range from \r\ncombating transnational crime to climate change. \r\nHence, the eternal question of whether the \r\nOrganization is adequately equipped and organized to \r\ndeal with such challenges, when its current structure \r\nwas designed for a different world, that of the second \r\nhalf of the 20th century. \r\n The report of the Secretary-General addresses all \r\nof those challenges in its first four chapters, which \r\ncover the traditional four pillars of development, peace \r\nand security, humanitarian affairs, human rights and \r\nrule of law. The report then presents a novel \r\nconfiguration entitled “Securing global goods”, which \r\nincludes climate change, global health, countering \r\nterrorism, and disarmament and non-proliferation. In \r\neach case, an attempt is made to take the measure of \r\nprogress already made and the long road yet to be \r\ncovered. One can agree or disagree with the \r\nassessments, but it should be recognized that the \r\nSecretary-General’s presentation is nuanced and takes \r\ninto account the enormous differences experienced by \r\ndifferent countries, and the crucial importance of \r\nanalyzing each case on its own merits. \r\n The next-to-last chapter of the report addresses \r\nour own Organization, again with an analysis of \r\nprogress in the matter of system-wide coherence. The \r\ncreation of UN-Women is offered as a paradigmatic \r\nexample of progress and reform. It is important to \r\nacknowledge the important advances that have been \r\nmade in adapting the Organization to new demands. \r\nThe best example lies in the significant transformations \r\nintroduced in the various United Nations peacekeeping \r\noperations dispersed across the globe. Important \r\nimprovements are also reported in the capacity of the \r\nOrganization to deal with natural disasters.  \r\n But there are other areas, such as the reform of \r\nthe three main intergovernmental bodies, and \r\nespecially the Security Council, where we remain \r\nstalled after two decades of fruitless dialogue. \r\nResponsibility for the latter situation lies, of course, \r\nwith our own intergovernmental forum, the General \r\nAssembly, which has not found the way to reach a \r\nconsensus, for reasons that are well known. \r\n The last chapter of the report arrives at a \r\nconclusion with which we believe that all delegations \r\ncan concur: the need for the United Nations has never \r\nbeen greater than it is now, given the need to address \r\nthe diverse requirements and demands of today’s \r\nworld. Here, the Secretary-General makes a clarion call \r\nfor all Member States and the Secretariat to work \r\ntogether. Speaking for my own delegation, we answer \r\nthat call in the affirmative. \r\n A/66/PV.31\r\n \r\n11 11-52968 \r\n \r\n Mrs. Kolontai (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): The \r\nByelorussian delegation welcomes the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report on the work of the Organization \r\n(A/66/1). We note the constructive nature of the report \r\nwith its approaches to planning the work of the \r\nOrganization for the medium and long terms. \r\n We welcome the report’s content as a conceptual \r\napproach to dealing with a host of topical questions on \r\nthe international agenda. First of all, the report notes \r\nmeasures aimed at accelerating progress in the \r\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals, \r\nwhich were set forth in the Millennium Declaration \r\n(resolution 55/2). \r\n We support the Secretary-General’s commitment \r\nto working towards the development of ideas for a \r\nframework programme for development for the post-\r\n2015 period, with concrete recommendations to be \r\nmade in 2012. In this regard, we place high hopes on \r\nthe United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, to be held in Rio de Janeiro next June. \r\nBelarus is ready to play an active role in preparing for \r\nthe Conference and to work on its outcome document. \r\n Faced with the threat of a new wave of global \r\ncrises, the United Nations must play a leading role in \r\nrestoring the world economy. We note, in that \r\nconnection, the efforts of the Organization to seek a \r\nbalance between the interests of various groups of \r\nStates and cooperation with middle-income countries. \r\nWe are convinced that coordinated measures on the \r\npart of the United Nations to orient the operational \r\nbodies of the Organization towards a fuller and more \r\neffective response to the particular needs of this large \r\ngroup of countries would help improve the situation. \r\nBearing in mind the destructive potential of the global \r\ncrisis in terms of using socio-economic pretexts to stir \r\nup clashes between countries, we believe it necessary \r\nfor the United Nations to focus on a systematic \r\nhandling of current issues and to make as much use as \r\npossible of the entire arsenal of instruments of \r\npreventive diplomacy.  \r\n We view preventive diplomacy as one of the most \r\neffective ways of preserving peace. Belarus is \r\nunequivocally against the use of force in settling \r\nconflicts, because it often has unpredictable negative \r\nconsequences and does not meet the interests of long-\r\nterm stabilization. We believe that there is no \r\nalternative to a political dialogue.  \r\n In that regard, we emphasize the need to \r\nstrengthen the Organization’s capabilities in peace \r\nmediation, by strengthening measures aimed at \r\npreventing the initial causes of conflicts and making \r\nfuller use of opportunities afforded by regional and \r\nsubregional organizations, such as the Collective \r\nSecurity Treaty Organization (CSTO), which are in the \r\nbest position to know about the problems within their \r\nareas of responsibility. Belarus, as chair of the CSTO, \r\nis prepared to do everything it can to help here. \r\n We share the Secretary-General’s serious concern \r\nregarding the lack of noticeable progress in the work of \r\nthe Conference on Disarmament. It is our position that \r\nthe Conference on Disarmament is a unique negotiating \r\nbody on questions of disarmament and international \r\nsecurity and has global significance. In our opinion, \r\nprogress in the Conference depends on the political \r\nwill of the group of the world’s leading States with \r\nrespect to starting a negotiating process for nuclear \r\ndisarmament.  \r\n Belarus supports efforts aimed at crafting a new \r\ninternational instrument that would help deal with key \r\nproblems stemming from the uncontrolled spread of \r\nconventional weapons on a global scale. To become \r\nuniversal, such an instrument would have to be adhered \r\nto by all States without exception; it would have to be \r\ndiscussed only at the United Nations, and a final \r\ndecision would have to be adopted strictly on the basis \r\nof consensus. To be effective, it must be aimed at \r\nachieving concrete goals and purposes flowing from \r\nthe key problems affecting the interests of all States \r\nMembers of the United Nations. \r\n International terrorism remains a significant \r\nthreat to international peace and security. Recent acts \r\nof terrorism have confirmed that even socially well-off \r\nand politically stable States are vulnerable in the face \r\nof such threats. We are convinced that this evil can be \r\neliminated only by consolidating the mutually \r\nreinforcing efforts of Governments and organizations \r\nat the regional and international levels. Important \r\nmeasures include completing work on the \r\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism, \r\nstrict compliance with the Global Counter-Terrorism \r\nStrategy, providing international assistance and \r\nbuilding up the capacities of States to combat \r\nterrorism. \r\n We would also like to draw the Assembly’s \r\nattention to the need to develop global measures to \r\nA/66/PV.31  \r\n \r\n11-52968 12 \r\n \r\ncounter the use of information technologies for \r\npropagandizing violence, recruitment for terrorist \r\ngroups, and popularizing or justifying terrorism. We \r\nshare the position of the Secretary-General on the need \r\nto increase the effectiveness of measures designed to \r\nuphold the rule of law. We express the hope that, at the \r\nopening of the sixty-seventh session of the General \r\nAssembly, a high-level event on the rule of law will \r\nhelp preserve and strengthen the existing system of \r\ninternational law as a deterring factor against \r\nlawlessness and legal nihilism. \r\n With respect to the concept of responsibility to \r\nprotect, we know that it needs to be clearly formulated \r\nwith an exhaustive list of criteria and conditions for \r\nimplementation. The concept cannot and must not be \r\nused to put pressure on sovereign States. The \r\nresponsibility to protect should not condone violations \r\nof the principles of the sovereign equality of States or \r\nnon-interference in their sovereign rights or the \r\nnon-use of force. \r\n The use of military force by the international \r\ncommunity must exceptional in practice and must be \r\ncarried out in strict conformity with the Charter. We \r\nbelieve it necessary to provide for the appropriate \r\ninternational legal strengthening of the principle of \r\nresponsibility to protect, and mechanisms to prevent \r\nabuses must be based on strict compliance by Member \r\nStates with the Charter of the United Nations and the \r\nobligatory rules of international law.  \r\n Global partnerships can serve as an important \r\ninstrument in preventing crises, a concept that Belarus \r\nhas been actively supporting. We are pleased to note \r\nthe further strengthening of partnering relationships \r\nbetween the United Nations and other international \r\norganizations, groups of Member States, civil society \r\nand the private sector, for the purposes of development. \r\nWe take note of the measures adopted aimed at \r\nensuring a system-wide coherence in the United \r\nNations.  \r\n In that regard, we welcome the beginning of the \r\noperation of the recently created gender entity, \r\nUN-Women. We express confidence that this office \r\nwill provide the necessary support to States in order to \r\nimprove the situation of women on the ground. We \r\nbelieve that among the key thrusts of the work of \r\nUN-Women should be to combat human trafficking as \r\none of the negative phenomena that hold women back \r\nin their rights and opportunities. We hope that the \r\nagenda of this new organization, fulfilling the \r\nmandates that were initially assigned to it, will become \r\nan active member of the Inter-Agency Coordination \r\nGroup against Trafficking in Persons and will make a \r\ncontribution to implementing the Global Plan of Action \r\nto Combat Trafficking in Persons adopted by the \r\nGeneral Assembly.  \r\n We support the Secretary-General’s idea on the \r\nneed to support youth and provide young people with \r\nbroad opportunities to receive an education or \r\nvocational training, acquire technical skills and benefit \r\nfrom job placement services. Young people are the \r\npotential and driving force of any society. We welcome \r\nthe recent holding, within the context of the \r\nInternational Year of Youth, of a high-level meeting. \r\nWe hope that now work will begin on effective global \r\npolicies to defend the interests of youth. \r\n The tragedy in Fukushima confirms the need to \r\nstrengthen United Nations agencies responsible for \r\nconducting scientific assessments of the consequences \r\nand effects of atomic radiation and deriving effective \r\nways to overcome them. Belarus notes in that regard \r\nthe work done by the United Nations Scientific \r\nCommittee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation. \r\nHowever, the appearance of new countries that have \r\ndeveloped the necessary scientific potential and \r\nknowledge on the effects of atomic radiation has not \r\nbeen yet been reflected in the membership of the \r\nCommittee. We are convinced that it would increase \r\nthe effectiveness of the Committee’s work if we \r\nappointed six candidate States as members during the \r\nsixty-sixth session of the General Assembly. We hope \r\nthat Members States of the United Nations will do \r\neverything possible to strengthen the Committee with \r\nthe advisory support of the Secretariat of the \r\nOrganization and that the Assembly will take the \r\nnecessary decisions to improve the performance of the \r\nCommittee in the long term. \r\n On the list of measures in the fight against \r\nclimate change, we focus on realistic steps to create an \r\neffective model for cooperation, regulated by \r\ninternational agreements on reducing greenhouse gas \r\nemissions. We have tried to make our contribution to \r\nsuch multilateral efforts, and we initiated the adoption \r\nof the amendment to annex B of the Kyoto Protocol \r\nestablishing quantitative commitments on such \r\nemissions. The amendment will enter into force when \r\nthe parties have satisfied their domestic procedures. In \r\nthat regard, we ask delegations to speed up the \r\n A/66/PV.31\r\n \r\n13 11-52968 \r\n \r\nadoption of the necessary domestic legislation required \r\nto implement the Convention, which would thus help \r\nus follow through on international efforts to fight \r\nclimate change.  \r\n An important step in that effort will be achieving \r\na comprehensive agreement at the United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development. We hope that \r\nthe Conference will be successful and give an impetus \r\nto establishing a global mechanism under United \r\nNations auspices that would provide access to modern \r\nenergy technologies for developing and middle-income \r\ncountries. The transfer of those technologies will help \r\ndefend our planet from irreversible changes.  \r\n We share the opinion of the Secretary-General \r\nthat a strong and unified United Nations is in the \r\ninterest of its Member States. Such an Organization \r\nwould be able, of course, to deal with the complex \r\nchallenges we have before us. That is why the question \r\nof United Nations reform stands out as sharply as ever. \r\nWithout such reform, we can never have the tools we \r\nneed to prevent global crises. We call on the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to pursue efforts in that direction. We consider \r\nour joint efforts to revitalize the work of the Assembly \r\nand to reform the Security Council and the Economic \r\nand Social Council to be a priority. \r\n Mr. Khan (India): At the outset, permit me to \r\nextend my warm felicitations to you, Sir, on your \r\nassumption of the important post of President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. You can \r\ncount on the full cooperation and constructive support \r\nof my delegation as you steer our work over the \r\ncoming year. \r\n Less than a week has passed since our leaders \r\nassembled here in the Hall to share their perspectives \r\nand visions on the current international system. When \r\nour Prime Minister, Mr. Manmohan Singh, addressed \r\nthe Assembly on 24 September (see A/66/PV.22), he \r\nspelled out some of the daunting challenges that \r\nconfront the international community at this time of \r\nflux and uncertainty. \r\n Terrorism is a scourge of humankind. It is a \r\nglobal problem that requires global solutions. It has \r\nspared no country, region or city in the world, be it \r\nNew York, London, Abuja or Mumbai, to name but a \r\nfew places. I am happy that the Security Council’s \r\nCounter-Terrorism Committee, which India has the \r\nhonour of chairing, adopted an outcome document on \r\nthe occasion of the tenth anniversary of Security \r\nCouncil resolution 1373 (2001) that contains two \r\nconsensus benchmarks, namely, that the international \r\ncommunity has zero tolerance for terrorism and that no \r\ncause or grievance whatsoever can justify it. India \r\nbelieves that the adoption of a comprehensive \r\nconvention against international terrorism would \r\nprovide a solid legal basis for the fight against \r\nterrorism. In our view, the United Nations Global \r\nCounter-Terrorism Strategy is incomplete in the \r\nabsence of such a convention. \r\n On the important issue of reforming the Security \r\nCouncil, negotiations during the sixty-fifth session \r\ndemonstrated, without a shred of doubt, Members’ \r\nstrong support for expanding both the permanent and \r\nnon-permanent Security Council membership \r\ncategories. We welcome the decision of the President \r\nto reappoint Ambassador Zahir Tanin as Chair of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. We urge Ambassador \r\nTanin to immediately convene an informal plenary \r\nmeeting to discuss Council reform. \r\n Last year, the United Nations played a significant \r\nrole in helping the people of South Sudan realize their \r\naspirations. It was with a sense of accomplishment that \r\nIndia, along with the rest of the international \r\ncommunity, welcomed that new country into our fold. \r\nThe path ahead is by no means easy, but we are \r\nconfident that, with adequate resolve, patience and \r\nperseverance, we can help that newborn nation as it \r\nembarks upon the task of nation-building. \r\n This year we also have another opportunity to \r\ntranslate the dreams of the Palestinian people into \r\nreality. As Prime Minister Singh said to the Assembly \r\non 24 September, we look forward to welcoming \r\nPalestine as an equal Member of the United Nations. \r\n This month, the population of our planet is set to \r\npass the 7 billion mark. This is not a mere statistical \r\nmilestone but yet another reminder of the grinding \r\npoverty, inequality and deprivation that continue to be \r\nthe fate of an unacceptably large cross-section of \r\nhumankind. It also shines a spotlight on the many \r\nunfinished tasks ahead of us on the global development \r\nagenda. We have made some progress since the world \r\ncommunity met in New York in September 2010 to \r\nreview progress on the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs), although overall the picture is mixed. Our \r\ndeep political commitment notwithstanding, the hard \r\ntruth is that countries have done little to advance \r\nMDG 8, namely, developing a global partnership for \r\nA/66/PV.31  \r\n \r\n11-52968 14 \r\n \r\ndevelopment. In that regard, the commitment made by \r\ndeveloped countries to provide 0.7 per cent of gross \r\nnational produce in official development assistance \r\nshould be met as soon as possible. Equally significant \r\nis the need for ensuring affordable access to \r\ntechnology and building capacity. \r\n Poverty reduction, gender empowerment, \r\nmaternal health and infant mortality figures continue to \r\nshow variable trends, with marked disparities between \r\nregions. The acute rural-urban divide in all the \r\nindicators makes the progress lopsided. What is most \r\nworrisome is that despite significant reductions in \r\nextreme poverty in the developing world, the \r\nproportion of people who go hungry has remained \r\nstatic. This glaring disconnect calls for renewed \r\nattention to the mechanisms governing access to food \r\nin the developing world. \r\n We believe it is important that the United Nations \r\nsystem focus on the needs of the most vulnerable \r\npopulations in developing countries. Sustained priority \r\nmust be given to the special needs of least-developed \r\ncountries, landlocked developing countries and small \r\nisland developing States. Member States and the \r\nUnited Nations system must encourage timely action \r\non the Istanbul commitments. We must also pay \r\nparticular attention to Africa, in recognition of its \r\nspecial needs. \r\n The focus on women’s issues in the United \r\nNations system has received a substantial boost \r\nthrough the transformative step that Member States \r\ntook last year to create a unified gender entity, \r\nUN-Women. We are happy to note that the new entity \r\nhas embarked on its important tasks with purpose and \r\nvigour, even as it settles into its new structures and \r\nmandate. \r\n My delegation’s efforts at the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change Conference \r\nwill be to ensure expeditious negotiations that lead to \r\nan ambitious, balanced and fair outcome. In doing so, \r\nwe should be mindful that its defining features should \r\nbe the principles of equity, common but differentiated \r\nresponsibility, and respective capabilities. I would also \r\nlike to draw the Assembly’s attention to the United \r\nNations Conference on Sustainable Development to be \r\nheld in Rio de Janeiro next year, which holds great \r\npromise for the global sustainable development \r\nagenda. We must seize the opportunity to return \r\nsustainable development, as defined by the principles \r\nof the Rio Declaration on Environment and \r\nDevelopment (A/CONF.151/26 (Vol. 1)), to the centre \r\nof the global development matrix. \r\n We appreciate the efforts of the secretary-General \r\nin advocating the principles of the promotion and \r\nprotection of human rights and the rule of law. We also \r\nrecognize their synergistic link with human welfare \r\nand socio-economic development, including the \r\nachievement of the MDGs. The review of the Human \r\nRights Council last year was a welcome development. \r\n Peacekeeping constitutes the most visible \r\nenterprise of the United Nations. India has had the \r\nproud privilege of contributing more than 100,000 \r\npeacekeepers to peacekeeping operations in the past six \r\ndecades. As one of the largest contributors of troops \r\nand resources, India is acutely conscious of the \r\ndramatic changes that have taken place in the \r\npeacekeeping landscape. We remain supportive of all \r\nthe Secretary-General’s efforts to strengthen the \r\ncapability of peacekeepers to keep the peace in \r\nincreasingly difficult and complex situations by taking \r\nthese changed realities into account. \r\n It is imperative to ensure that any decision on \r\npeacekeeping mandates not be isolated from equally \r\nimportant decisions on resources and capacity, in order \r\nto achieve the satisfactory execution of those \r\nmandates. Equally, India is conscious of the fact that \r\npeacekeeping cannot be a substitute for the tasks of \r\nnation- and peacebuilding. The Government of India is \r\ncommitted to the principle and practice of \r\npeacebuilding. \r\n India attaches the highest priority to the goal of \r\nuniversal disarmament. We continue to be guided by \r\nthe visionary action plan for a nuclear-weapon-free and \r\nnon-violent world presented by Prime Minister Rajiv \r\nGandhi in 1988, which sets out a road map for \r\nachieving nuclear disarmament in a time-bound, \r\nuniversal, non-discriminatory, phased and verifiable \r\nmanner. We further welcome the attention given to the \r\nissue of nuclear safety and security. And we support \r\ninternational efforts under the aegis of the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency to enhance levels of safety and \r\nsecurity. \r\n In conclusion, we look forward to forging ahead \r\non the crucial issues before us during the current \r\nsession of the General Assembly and to working \r\ntowards meaningful and results-oriented outcomes. \r\n A/66/PV.31\r\n \r\n15 11-52968 \r\n \r\n Mr. Khair (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, allow me to congratulate you, Sir, on your \r\nelection as President of this session of the General \r\nAssembly. I am sure that, thanks to your wisdom and \r\nexperience, the work of this session will be a success.  \r\n I would also like to thank the Secretary-General \r\nfor his report on the work of the Organization this year \r\n(A/66/1). And I wish to emphasize the importance of \r\nthis debate on the report. It is fortunate that, following \r\nthe general debate, the sixty-sixth session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly begins its deliberations with this \r\nreport, which takes stock of the Organization’s work as \r\nit pertains directly to the world’s hopes and \r\nexpectations for achieving development and \r\nstrengthening international peace and security. We face \r\na number of international challenges and crises that \r\ncall for a prompt and robust response in order to \r\nachieve security and development for the whole world. \r\n The report is focused on the special needs of \r\nAfrica. We would like to stress the importance of \r\nproviding support for development in Africa. Along \r\nwith the New Partnership for Africa’s Development, \r\nthat should be considered a top priority for the United \r\nNations. It is also important to increase resources to \r\nAfrica and to address the continent’s debt problem, \r\nespecially with regard to least developed countries, \r\nmost of which are in Africa. We hope that such support \r\nwill be coupled with support for the implementation of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), in \r\nparticular in the cultural and social fields. \r\n My country places particular importance on the \r\nimplementation of the internationally agreed MDGs. \r\nWe hope that the Economic and Social Council will \r\nplay a leading role in monitoring and following up the \r\ncommitments made in connection with the \r\nimplementation of the MDGs. It is also important to \r\ntake stock of the obstacles faced by developing \r\ncountries in achieving the MDGs. \r\n We had hoped that the Secretary-General’s report — \r\nspecifically under heading B of chapter II, entitled \r\n“Peacebuilding” — would have commended the \r\nGovernment of the Sudan for its commitment to peace, \r\nespecially given the signing of the Comprehensive \r\nPeace Agreement, which led to the declaration and \r\nestablishment of South Sudan. The Sudan promptly \r\nrecognized South Sudan. We therefore call on the \r\nOrganization not to heed the policies of some countries \r\nthat do not want to give credit to those that deserve it. \r\nWe would also like to draw the Assembly’s attention to \r\nthe fact that the Sudanese leadership, under President \r\nOmar Hassan Ahmad Al-Bashir, has enabled the people \r\nof South Sudan to realize their right to self-\r\ndetermination, for the sake of peace and stability in the \r\ncountry. My country continues to call for good \r\nneighbourly relations with the Government of South \r\nSudan based on understanding and common interests. \r\n In conclusion, we hope that the next report of the \r\nSecretary-General will include a plan to step up \r\ninternational cooperation, in particular in the areas of \r\nscience and technology, given their importance in \r\nbolstering economic and socially sustainable \r\ndevelopment for our people. We hope that this will \r\nhelp us to benefit from the progress made at the \r\ninternational level on the peaceful use of nuclear \r\nenergy. \r\n We also hope that the work of the Organization \r\nwill be based on professionalism, impartiality and \r\nneutrality, in line with the letter and spirit of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations and with a view to \r\nfostering cooperation among States at this critical \r\njuncture in world history. The Organization should \r\ndistance itself from any narrow-minded agenda that \r\nseeks to target some countries on the basis of \r\nselectivity and policies based on double standards. And \r\nwe hope that the Organization will soon be reformed in \r\norder to help us maintain international peace and \r\nsecurity and achieve our development goals. \r\n Mr. Acharya (Nepal): I wish to thank the \r\nSecretary-General for the comprehensive presentation \r\nof his report (A/66/1) on the work of the Organization. \r\nIn particular, we take note of the analysis and reporting \r\non major developments and trends and the need for the \r\nreinvigoration of global cooperation under the United \r\nNations. As rightly stated in the report, we have a \r\ncollective responsibility to secure and promote global \r\ngoods. Given their complexity and interrelated and \r\nwide-ranging nature, they require global cooperation of \r\nthe highest order. \r\n As we consider the symbiotic relationship \r\nbetween peace, security and development we are glad \r\nto see that the report first turns its attention to the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). The MDGs, \r\nwhich all countries must achieve by 2015, remain our \r\nkey development objectives. However, the conditions \r\nand opportunities for achieving them are not the same \r\nfor all. Against a backdrop of structural constraints and \r\nA/66/PV.31  \r\n \r\n11-52968 16 \r\n \r\nmultiple vulnerabilities, accentuated by the adverse \r\nimpacts of climate change and a series of mutually \r\nexacerbating crises, least developed countries (LDCs) \r\nare likely to miss many of the important MDG targets.  \r\n For LDCs, the medium-term goal is to graduate \r\nfrom their status. That hinges on achieving the MDGs \r\nand on building their productive capacity, \r\ninfrastructure and institutions as a development \r\nmultiplier. Graduation from LDC status requires strong \r\npolitical will and determination on the part of LDCs \r\nand their development partners, as well as effective and \r\nrobust international support measures in a sustained \r\nand predictable manner. We call for the full, timely and \r\neffective implementation of the Istanbul Programme of \r\nAction. \r\n The credibility of the United Nations lies in its \r\nability to fulfil the primary responsibility for the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security as \r\nenshrined in the Charter. A continuous evolution in the \r\nexternal environment demands continued adjustment in \r\nthe approach of the United Nations, while fundamental \r\nprinciples remain constant.  \r\n A holistic approach to peace and security is \r\nneeded to address diverse and complex threats in the \r\nmodern world. In recent years, demands have increased \r\nphenomenally for greater United Nations involvement \r\nin preventive diplomacy, crisis management, conflict \r\nresolution and the building of sustainable peace. \r\nIncreased responsibility demands increased political \r\ncommitment and matching resources. \r\n Peacekeeping, which remains a flagship \r\nenterprise of the United Nations, is constantly \r\nevolving. In our view, unity of purpose among the \r\nmembers of the Security Council and the mobilization \r\nof its entire political capital, based on merits and \r\nprinciples and a coherent strategic framework with an \r\nexplicit mandate, will largely determine the success of \r\npeacekeeping operations on the ground.  \r\n Equally important is the need to have an \r\ninstitutionalized consultative framework with troop- \r\nand police-contributing countries and the provision of \r\nadequate human and material resources. The safety, \r\nsecurity and motivation of peacekeepers should form \r\nan integral part of a successful peacekeeping mission. \r\nWe remain steadfast in our commitment to contributing \r\nto peacekeeping. \r\n We underscore the important role of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission. The consolidation of \r\nnational ownership and capacity-building and strong \r\nsupport for economic regeneration and youth \r\nemployment, together with stabilization of the security \r\nsituation and coherence and effective coordination \r\namong all stakeholders, are some of the defining \r\nfeatures of successful peacebuilding efforts. \r\n Conflicts, natural disasters, poverty, hunger and \r\nmultiple crises have aggravated humanitarian \r\nchallenges worldwide. We call for greater United \r\nNations capacity, both in terms of resources and \r\nmanpower. We welcome the efforts of the United \r\nNations to further improve needs-based joint planning \r\nefforts. We call for United Nations assistance in \r\ndeveloping streamlined and effective disaster risk \r\nreduction strategies to minimize people’s exposure to \r\nnatural hazards, especially in LDCs. \r\n Nepal’s commitment to human rights is \r\nunequivocal. Peace, development and human rights \r\nmust be pursued in a coherent and holistic manner. The \r\nright to development must form an integral part of the \r\nglobal human rights agenda. \r\n Global warming has frequently led to erratic and \r\nextreme weather, affecting human health, ecosystems \r\nand biodiversity. My country, which is both a least \r\ndeveloped and landlocked country, is highly vulnerable \r\nto climate change, which has precipitated the melting \r\nof snow in the Nepalese Himalayas — the perennial \r\nsource of freshwater for over 1 billion people in South \r\nAsia. Approximately two dozen of our glacial lakes \r\ncould overflow their banks at any time, causing a huge \r\nloss in lives and property. That is why we have \r\nlaunched the initiative to promote a sustainable \r\nmountain development agenda, with a view to \r\nhighlighting their special vulnerabilities and fragilities. \r\n We are deeply worried by the lack of progress on \r\nclimate talks. We call for ambitious goals, with due \r\nregard for the equitable aspects of climate change. \r\nNepal attaches high importance to the Rio+20 \r\nConference on sustainable development, to be held \r\nnext year. The Conference will be an important \r\noccasion to collectively advance the sustainable \r\ndevelopment agenda, with a central focus on human \r\nwell-being, while taking into account the \r\nvulnerabilities of LDCs. \r\n Nepal calls for the general and complete \r\ndisarmament of all weapons of mass destruction in a \r\n A/66/PV.31\r\n \r\n17 11-52968 \r\n \r\ntime-bound manner. The Regional Centre for Peace and \r\nDisarmament for Asia and the Pacific, located in \r\nKathmandu, could be instrumental in revitalizing the \r\nKathmandu process to facilitate dialogues and \r\ndeliberations on confidence-building in the region. \r\n Terrorism must be defeated in all its forms and \r\nmanifestations. The early conclusion of a \r\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism is \r\ncritical to strengthening global partnership and to \r\ncollaboration in fighting that deadly menace. \r\n The global health agenda must receive continued \r\npriority. It is also important that the Political \r\nDeclaration on HIV/AIDS (resolution 60/262) and the \r\nPolitical Declaration of the High-level Meeting of the \r\nGeneral Assembly on the Prevention and Control of \r\nNon-communicable Diseases (resolution 66/2, annex), \r\nwhich was held just a few days ago, be implemented \r\nwith priority, fully ensuring the resource requirements \r\nof developing countries, in particular of LDCs. \r\n We must ensure that the power and authority of \r\nthe General Assembly are enhanced commensurate \r\nwith its standing as the only universally representative \r\nbody.  \r\n Nepal supports the expansion of the membership \r\nof the Security Council in both categories. The reform \r\nagenda must address all interrelated issues, such as \r\nrepresentation, as well as transparency and \r\naccountability in the working methods of the Security \r\nCouncil. The role and contribution of smaller States in \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security \r\nshould also be duly acknowledged. \r\n The Economic and Social Council must take a \r\nleading role in ensuring coherence and consistency in \r\nglobal economic, financial and trading systems and in \r\npromoting global economic relations, in close \r\ncooperation with the Bretton Woods and other relevant \r\ninstitutions. The United Nations has a crucial role in \r\nshaping the policy debate on, and establishing global \r\nnorms in, economic and financial matters, which must \r\nbe strengthened. Nepal welcomes all efforts aimed at \r\npromoting system-wide coherence, including the \r\noperationalization of UN-Women. \r\n In conclusion, Nepal’s commitment to the \r\npurposes and principles of the United Nations Charter \r\nis profound and resolute. For us, the United Nations \r\nrepresents a solid manifestation of multilateralism. \r\nDespite tumultuous developments over the years, the \r\nUnited Nations has preserved its standing as a \r\ncentrepiece of international relations. As the world \r\nbecomes more integrated and the problems facing \r\nhumankind become more complex and diverse, the \r\nUnited Nations remains a pivotal and indispensable \r\norganization for us all. \r\n Mr. Gumende (Mozambique): As this is the first \r\ntime that I take the floor at the General Assembly, \r\nallow me to start by congratulating you, Mr. President, \r\nand all the members of the Bureau on your unanimous \r\nelection to preside over the sixty-sixth session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. We would also like to take this \r\nopportunity to express the full support of the \r\ndelegation of Mozambique as you discharge of your \r\nnoble mission and responsibilities. \r\n The delegation of Mozambique welcomes this \r\nyear’s annual report (A/66/1), a document that \r\nhighlights the main achievements of the past session, \r\nthe challenges that the Organization had to overcome \r\nand, above all, the remaining commitments to be met. \r\nIn that regard, it constitutes an important guide for the \r\nwork ahead. We thank the Secretary-General for the \r\ncomprehensive report and all United Nations staff for \r\nthe positive results, which could be achieved only with \r\ntheir dedicated engagement and commitment to deliver \r\non the work of the Organization. \r\n In the past five years, we have witnessed a fast-\r\nchanging world, marked by the prevailing combined \r\neffects of various crises and aggravated by the \r\nmagnitude and frequency of natural disasters, to \r\nmention just one. In that challenging environment, the \r\nUnited Nations has shown its ability to adapt and \r\ntransform itself to cope with new and complex \r\nrealities. Today, the Organization remains our source of \r\nstrength and inspiration, as it is under its umbrella that \r\nwe congregate to strive to foster inclusive and \r\nsustainable responses to new and old challenges alike. \r\nThe report has several examples of that resilience, from \r\nresponses to threats to peace and security to those \r\ntaken in the context of humanitarian disasters. \r\n We note with satisfaction that the United Nations \r\nhas strengthened its partnership with regional and \r\nsubregional organizations, an important step in \r\nimproving early warning mechanisms, conflict \r\nprevention and crisis management. As underlined by \r\nHis Excellency President Armando Guebuza in his \r\nstatement during the general debate, \r\nA/66/PV.31  \r\n \r\n11-52968 18 \r\n \r\n  “We reaffirm our recognition of the role of \r\nthe regional and subregional organizations as \r\npillars in the promotion and maintenance of \r\npeace, security and stability”. (A/66/PV.13, p. 9) \r\n We note with concern that, four years before the \r\n2015 deadline for the achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, the Secretary-General has once \r\nagain reiterated the call made last year for the \r\nnecessary financial resources to be made available if \r\nwe are to succeed in achieving the targets to which we \r\ncommitted ourselves. The situation is even graver in \r\nAfrica, a continent where the total number of people \r\nliving in extreme poverty and facing food insecurity \r\ncontinues to rise due to a sharp increase in food and \r\nenergy prices in 2011. In addition, the economic \r\nperformance of several African countries is not being \r\ncomplemented by the disbursement of the additional \r\nfinancial support pledged by development partners, \r\nincluding that promised six years ago at the Group of \r\n20 Summit at Gleneagles. \r\n In that regard, we await with expectation the \r\nproposed recommendations for a post-2015 \r\ndevelopment framework, as well as the outcome of the \r\nHigh-level Panel on Global Sustainability, as they will \r\noutline our future path to equitable and sustainable \r\ndevelopment. It is vital that, as we approach 2015, the \r\ninternational community reaffirm its commitment to an \r\ninclusive global development agenda that caters for the \r\nneeds of every Member State, from the least developed \r\ncountries to the most developed ones. We should work \r\ntogether to ensure that the next framework sustains and \r\nconsolidates the gains made so far, reinforces the \r\ncommitments to overcome the shortfalls, and identifies \r\nways to tackle the new challenges before us. \r\n The recent social uprisings in North Africa and \r\nthe Middle East bear testimony to the vulnerability of \r\npeace and stability in the absence of adequate \r\nsatisfaction of basic human needs and rights. We salute \r\nthe United Nations for its timely involvement in \r\nfostering dialogue and in supporting the authorities of \r\nthe affected countries as they endeavour to respond to \r\nthe needs of their people in an emergency situation. \r\n As those countries return to normalcy, the role of \r\nthe United Nations continues to be of paramount \r\nimportance in helping to build democratic institutions \r\nand respond to the social needs of the people. Our \r\nexperience of transition from conflict to peace shows \r\nthat an impartial and credible partner, such as the \r\nUnited Nations, is critical in building confidence and \r\nfostering dialogue among the various national \r\nstakeholders. The United Nations also plays a critical \r\nrole by making appropriate expertise available in \r\nvarious relevant domains that we all recognize. \r\n In efforts to support the ongoing transition \r\nprocesses, the role of the international community \r\ncannot be overemphasized. In that regard, we applaud \r\nthe political decision to establish the United Nations \r\nSupport Mission in Libya. \r\n As one of the eight pilot countries working on the \r\nDelivering as One initiative since 2007, Mozambique \r\nfollows with particular interest the activities of the \r\nOrganization to reinforce system-wide coherence at all \r\nlevels. We therefore welcome the progress made in that \r\nregard, including activities related to the \r\nimplementation of the Plan of Action for the \r\nHarmonization of Business Practices in the United \r\nNations System. It is worth noting that, in its country-\r\nled evaluation of Delivering as One, Mozambique \r\nidentified among the challenges the need to fast-track \r\nthe strategic consolidation of the delivering as one \r\nexperience by decentralizing roles and responsibilities \r\nbetween United Nations Headquarters and country \r\noffices, and the need to move forward with \r\nstreamlining and harmonization among United Nations \r\nagencies at the country and Headquarters levels. \r\n Mozambique has made significant progress in \r\nleading a partnership with the United Nations system \r\nthat is much more coherent in its support to national \r\npoverty reduction plans and strategies. For example, \r\nthe Government has just signed a new multi-year \r\nUnited Nations Development Assistance Framework \r\n(UNDAF) for 2012-2015 which, for the first time, \r\nbrings together all United Nations activities in the \r\ncountry into a common framework that is fully aligned \r\nwith our poverty reduction strategy paper. The \r\nimplementation of the new UNDAF will focus on \r\nbuilding on the lessons drawn from delivering as one \r\nand moving even further towards system-wide \r\ncoherence in the coming years. \r\n In that regard, Mozambique is pleased to see that \r\nthe Secretary-General’s report acknowledges some of \r\nthose lessons, such as the importance of strong \r\nGovernment leadership, the importance of strong \r\nUnited Nations system-wide leadership and \r\ncoordination at country level and the need to reinforce \r\n A/66/PV.31\r\n \r\n19 11-52968 \r\n \r\nthe common funding programming systems to avoid \r\ncompetition and fragmentation. \r\n Mozambique has paid particular attention to \r\nachieving tangible poverty reduction results as a \r\nhallmark of the Government’s poverty reduction \r\nprogrammes. We are therefore pleased that the new \r\nUNDAF anchors that same vision for the next \r\ngeneration of delivering as one. Good examples are \r\nalready visible and having an impact in the areas of \r\nnutrition, social protection and climate change \r\nadaptation, where joint United Nations programmes in \r\nsupport of Government goals has meant more effective \r\nsupport and results. \r\n Mozambique is of the view that there is no \r\nturning back on the accelerated United Nations reform \r\nprocess at the country level. We look forward to \r\nactively contributing to these and other lessons learned \r\nduring the ongoing independent evaluation of \r\nDelivering as One and at the intergovernmental \r\nmeeting of the programme country pilots, to be held in \r\nUruguay in November. \r\n Finally, we would like to reaffirm the continued \r\nengagement and commitment of Mozambique in \r\nsupport of United Nations work to deliver on the five \r\nimperatives highlighted by the Secretary-General in his \r\nopening statement (see A/66/PV.11) at the current \r\nsession: sustainable development, prevention, building \r\na safer and more secure world, supporting nations in \r\ntransition and empowering women and youth. \r\nTogether, no challenge is too large; together, nothing is \r\nimpossible.  \r\n The President: We have heard the last speaker in \r\nthe debate on this item for this meeting. \r\n May I take it that the General Assembly takes \r\nnote of the report of the Secretary-General on the work \r\nof the Organization, which is contained in document \r\nA/66/1? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President: The Assembly has thus concluded \r\nthis stage of its consideration of agenda item 110. \r\n  The meeting rose at 12:05 p.m. \r\n"
