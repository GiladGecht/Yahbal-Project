Corrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum. \r\n11-53871 (E) \r\n*1153871*   \r\nPresident: Mr. Al-Nasser . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Qatar) \r\n \r\n \r\n In the absence of the President, Mr. Zinsou \r\n(Benin), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.  \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 138 (continued) \r\n \r\nScale of assessments for the apportionment of the \r\nexpenses of the United Nations \r\n \r\n  Report of the Fifth Committee (A/66/492) \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): If there \r\nis no proposal under rule 66 of the rules of procedure, I \r\nshall take it that the Assembly decides not to discuss \r\nthe report of the Fifth Committee that is before it. \r\n It was so decided.  \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): \r\nStatements will therefore be limited to explanations of \r\nvote. The positions of delegations regarding the \r\nrecommendation of the Fifth Committee have been \r\nmade clear in the Committee and are reflected in the \r\nrelevant official records. \r\n May I remind members that, under paragraph 7 of \r\ndecision 34/401, the General Assembly agreed that \r\nwhen the same draft resolution is considered in a Main \r\nCommittee and in plenary meeting a delegation should, \r\nas far as possible, explain its vote only once, either in \r\nthe Committee or in the plenary meeting, unless that \r\ndelegation’s vote in plenary meeting is different from \r\nits vote in the Committee. May I also remind \r\ndelegations that, also in accordance with General \r\nAssembly decision 34/401, explanations of vote are \r\nlimited to 10 minutes. \r\n Before we take action on the recommendation \r\ncontained in the report, I should like to inform \r\nrepresentatives that we are going to proceed to take a \r\ndecision in the same manner as in the Fifth Committee. \r\n The Assembly will now take a decision on the \r\ndraft resolution recommended by the Fifth Committee \r\nin paragraph 6 of its report. The Committee adopted \r\nthe draft resolution, entitled “Scale of assessments for \r\nthe apportionment of the expenses of the United \r\nNations: requests under Article 19 of the Charter”, \r\nwithout a vote. May I take it that the Assembly wishes \r\nto do the same? \r\n The draft resolution was adopted (resolution \r\n66/4). \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly has thus concluded this stage of its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 138. \r\n \r\nAgenda items 63 and 13 \r\n \r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development: progress \r\nin implementation and international support \r\n \r\n (a) New Partnership for Africa’s Development: \r\nprogress in implementation and  \r\ninternational support \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/66/202) \r\n \r\nA/66/PV.32  \r\n \r\n11-53871 2 \r\n \r\n (b) Causes of conflict and the promotion of durable \r\npeace and sustainable development in Africa \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/66/214) \r\n \r\n2001-2010: Decade to Roll Back Malaria in \r\nDeveloping Countries, Particularly in Africa \r\n \r\n  Note by the Secretary-General (A/66/169) \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): In his \r\nreport on the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) (A/66/202), the Secretary-\r\nGeneral stresses the progress that African countries \r\nhave made in implementing what we can rightly call \r\nAfrica’s own vision for its development. Appropriately, \r\nthe report coincides with NEPAD’s tenth anniversary. \r\n NEPAD’s objectives are by now well known: \r\nimplementing priority programmes and projects at the \r\nregional and continental level, strengthening \r\npartnerships, mobilizing resources, seeking \r\ncooperation efforts in order to advance development in \r\nAfrica, creating a favourable environment for private \r\nsector development, creating links among institutions, \r\nand using existing technical resources in support of the \r\nNEPAD agenda. \r\n Today we can confirm that the New Partnership \r\nfor Africa’s Development is making encouraging \r\nprogress in many areas — particularly peace and \r\nsecurity, democracy and revitalization of the \r\neconomy — that are foundation stones for new \r\nnational, regional and continental efforts, as are \r\npartnerships with the international community. The \r\nprogramme has laid a foundation for Africa’s recovery \r\nin all areas — health, infrastructure, agriculture and \r\nfood security — and for renewed international \r\ncooperation for the development of the continent. \r\n But many challenges remain to be addressed, \r\nprimarily through the efforts of African countries — \r\nsince NEPAD should be implemented through national \r\nprogrammes adopted by the countries themselves — \r\nbut also with the support of the international \r\ncommunity. The debate we will begin today focuses on \r\nthis. \r\n Mr. Kleib (Indonesia): I have the privilege to \r\naddress the General Assembly on behalf of the \r\n10 member countries of the Association of Southeast \r\nAsian Nations (ASEAN). Since this is the first time for \r\nASEAN as a group to deliver its statement in the \r\nplenary at this session, I wish to offer on ASEAN’s \r\nbehalf our congratulations through you, Sir, to \r\nAmbassador Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on his \r\nassumption of the presidency of the Assembly at its \r\nsixty-sixth session. We are committed to supporting \r\nand cooperating with the presidency during this session \r\nin order to ensure its successful conclusion. \r\n I would also like to thank the Secretary-General \r\nfor his comprehensive reports under agenda items 63 \r\n(A/66/202 and A/66/214) and 13 (A/66/169). \r\n Striking events and important changes have taken \r\nplace all over the world in the last few years. Africa is \r\none of the places where we have witnessed positive \r\nshifts, but at the same time difficult humanitarian \r\nsituations.  \r\n Although domestic leadership is a key to Africa’s \r\ndevelopment, the international community plays an \r\nimportant role in supporting their efforts. ASEAN \r\naffirms its commitment to continue building synergies \r\nand friendship with Africa through the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) and \r\nthe New Asian-African Strategic Partnership adopted \r\nby all leaders of Asian and African countries in 2005. \r\n In conjunction with the tenth anniversary of the \r\nadoption of NEPAD, we need to think afresh how \r\nresources and creative energies could be better \r\nchannelled. Let us explore opportunities to build on the \r\nprogress made in implementing NEPAD projects. More \r\nimportantly, since people are a country’s most \r\nimportant asset, we should also focus on capacity-\r\nbuilding and human resource development in Africa. \r\nAs emphasized in the Secretary-General’s report, the \r\ntenth anniversary of NEPAD should be viewed as a \r\nturning point from business as usual towards policy \r\nactions and results. \r\n Action is vital, considering that one of the \r\ndistressing facts coinciding with NEPAD’s tenth \r\nanniversary is uneven progress on the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), where Africa lags far \r\nbehind other regions. More can be done to support \r\nimplementation of the eight MDGs.  \r\n On trade, although there has been virtually no \r\nprogress on the conclusion of the Doha Round, \r\nASEAN and NEPAD have a common interest in \r\nupholding the primacy of the multilateral trading \r\nsystem. We should continue to renew our commitment \r\nto finding solutions for common interests and concerns \r\nin this negotiation process.  \r\n A/66/PV.32\r\n \r\n3 11-53871 \r\n \r\n ASEAN views the African Peer Review \r\nMechanism as an innovative instrument for \r\nstrengthening Africa’s position for advancing good \r\ngovernance and socio-economic development. We are \r\npleased to hear that 30 countries have joined the \r\nMechanism, and we would like to encourage more \r\nAfrican countries to join. ASEAN therefore urges \r\nstrategic partners to lend their support to this process. \r\n Our discussion this year is taking place against \r\nthe backdrop of the devastating impact of climate \r\nchange, especially in East Africa and the Horn of \r\nAfrica. It is therefore important that our work in the \r\nplenary here contribute to the larger goal of reaching a \r\nsuccessful outcome of the United Nations Climate \r\nChange Conference in Durban and of the preparation \r\nfor the Conference on Sustainable Development next \r\nyear. \r\n Climate change also has an impact on health in \r\nAfrica. The 2001 Third Assessment Report of the \r\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change showed \r\nthat with even a small rise in temperature the risk of \r\nmalaria transmission would be greatly increased. While \r\nprogress has been made towards meeting the goal of \r\nmalaria control, and the recorded cases and deaths due \r\nto malaria in African countries have fallen by 50 per \r\ncent, malaria continues to affect the more vulnerable, \r\nand it remains a leading killer of children under five \r\nyears old. \r\n ASEAN and Africa share the same concern on the \r\nneed to combat malaria. ASEAN urges all countries \r\nand development partners to show their political will in \r\nfighting this infectious disease. Furthermore, ASEAN \r\nsupports the recommendations in the global plan for \r\nartemisinin resistance containment, not only to increase \r\npeople’s awareness of this risk but also to preserve \r\nartemisinin-based combination therapies as an effective \r\ntreatment for falciparum malaria. There is also an \r\nurgent need to build a human network for infectious \r\ndisease control through promoting human resources \r\nand capacity-building \r\n ASEAN believes that in order to achieve stability \r\nand security and spur legitimate economic activity it is \r\nabsolutely vital that the parties concerned take \r\neffective and sustained measures against the many \r\nchallenges they face, including maritime security, drug \r\ntrafficking, organized crime, youth unemployment and \r\nextreme poverty, which are all often mutually \r\nreinforcing. \r\n ASEAN emphasizes the importance of post-\r\nconflict peacebuilding strategies when dealing with \r\ncountries emerging from conflict in the region. To that \r\nend, ASEAN reaffirms its commitment to the role and \r\nwork of the Peacebuilding Commission (PBC). In \r\nASEAN’S view, the promotion of the peacebuilding \r\nagenda in those countries will contribute not only to \r\nthe creation of environments conducive to the \r\nattainment of durable peace but also to sustainable \r\ndevelopment in Africa.  \r\n ASEAN supports all initiatives focusing on \r\nenhancing youth employment, as many young people \r\nengage in illicit activities because of poverty and \r\nunemployment. We believe that the PBC can assist \r\ncountries to encourage and support home-grown \r\nprogrammes, including on youth employment, \r\nvocational training for youth and education. \r\n ASEAN also commends the role and work of \r\nregional and subregional organizations, such as the \r\nAfrican Union, NEPAD and the Economic Community \r\nof West African States, in assisting countries in the \r\nregion, in particular those under the PBC agenda. \r\n Finally, ASEAN countries stress the importance \r\nfor the United Nations, development partners and the \r\ninternational community to continue to strengthen their \r\nwork and focus on assisting African countries. While \r\nwe believe inclusiveness is important, we also \r\nrecognize the need for effective, timely decision-\r\nmaking and implementable results. \r\n Mr. Kamau (Kenya): On behalf of the African \r\nStates, I wish to express our gratitude to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his reports on the New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD), including on progress \r\nin implementation and international support (A/66/202) \r\nand on the causes of conflict and the promotion of \r\ndurable peace and sustainable development in Africa \r\n(A/66/214), and his report on the Decade to Roll Back \r\nMalaria in Developing Countries, Particularly in Africa \r\n(A/66/169). We also thank both traditional and new \r\ndevelopment partners for their support for the NEPAD \r\nprogrammes and projects. \r\n As we celebrate the tenth anniversary of NEPAD \r\nthis year, we are all reminded of the need to strengthen \r\ngovernance structures and institutions, deepen the \r\ndemocratic ethos, and reform our investment climate \r\nand make it business-friendly in order to increase our \r\ncollective competitiveness. Enhancing the quality of \r\neducational institutions, particularly for higher \r\nA/66/PV.32  \r\n \r\n11-53871 4 \r\n \r\neducation, and making them practical is also of the \r\nutmost importance. \r\n The African Group expects that our development \r\npartners will renew their political commitment to \r\nensure meaningful support to programmes and projects \r\nto meet Africa’s development needs. The Group is of \r\nthe opinion that an enabling international environment \r\nis indispensable. Our priorities are many, but the most \r\nurgent ones include industrialization, infrastructure \r\ndevelopment, agricultural transformation and the \r\nbuilding of human capital, as well as, of course, the \r\nfundamental aspects related to trade, which include \r\nmarket access and the development of a modern \r\nservice infrastructure. \r\n Partnerships with both traditional and new \r\ndevelopment partners should therefore seek to integrate \r\nAfrica into the global economy through \r\nindustrialization, diversification, infrastructure and \r\nhuman capital development. Furthermore, a \r\ndevelopment reorientation from the export of primary \r\nproducts to manufactured or processed goods is urgent \r\nand must be pursued. NEPAD recognizes the critical \r\nrole of the private sector, both domestic and foreign-\r\nowned, as the continent’s engine of economic growth.  \r\n Africa continues to be plagued by long-term and, \r\nin some cases, interrelated crises, including violent \r\nconflicts that have caused immense human suffering. \r\nIn the light of the serious implications of conflict for \r\nseveral aspects of the development of Africa, initiatives \r\nfrom peacebuilding to post-conflict reconstruction and \r\ndevelopment have been launched throughout the \r\ncontinent. \r\n A central theme in the African Union/NEPAD \r\nagenda is bringing together the issues of peace and \r\nsecurity, governance and constitutionalism, economic \r\ndevelopment, and international partnerships — and the \r\nway those partnerships drive governance and economic \r\ndevelopment. African countries will continue to pay \r\nspecial attention to those matters. \r\n Trade is an important tool for economic growth \r\nand development. However, Africa’s share of global \r\ntrade remains negligible. Africa accounts for only 3 per \r\ncent of world trade, while its share in global \r\nmanufactured exports is close to zero. The African \r\nGroup has put in place measures aimed at increasing \r\nthe volume of intraregional trade throughout the \r\ncontinent through regional blocs.  \r\n On the same note, Africa wants to improve its \r\nexternal trade with all its partners. However, the \r\nfaltering process in concluding the Doha Round is \r\nimpeding Africa’s market access to trade. We call on \r\nall parties to show flexibility and conclude the trade \r\ntalks as a matter of urgency. Aid for trade should be \r\nfurther emphasized to improve our supply-side \r\nconstraints and enhance our participation in \r\ninternational trade. \r\n Foreign direct investment flows to Africa should \r\nalso target labour-intensive infrastructure development \r\nprojects. They should include transfer of knowledge \r\nand technology and should build up the service sector, \r\nsuch as banking, insurance and medicine, and the \r\nindustrial sector, such as aeronautical and automotive \r\ncomponents, information and communications \r\ntechnology, off-shore food processing, et cetera. \r\n We urge development partners to take urgent \r\ncollective actions to fulfil all their aid commitments to \r\nAfrica, as official development assistance contributes \r\nto economic growth in important ways. The continent \r\nurges partners to fulfil their commitments to double \r\nofficial development assistance to Africa to support \r\nAfrica’s development. I also wish to point out that \r\nemphasis should shift from aid effectiveness to \r\ndevelopment effectiveness, to better measure the \r\nimpact of the resources that have been contributed to \r\nAfrica. \r\n With regard to the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs), Africa has made significant progress. \r\nHowever, the continent remains off-track on the way to \r\nachieving some of the MDGs by 2015. Concerns \r\nremain with regard to quality education, infant and \r\nmaternal health, malnutrition, safe drinking water and \r\nbasic sanitation. Social protection programmes and job \r\ncreation are required to reduce poverty and contribute \r\nto the achievement of the MDGs as well. \r\n The role of the NEPAD Agency as a planning unit \r\nis to facilitate and coordinate the implementation of \r\nregional and continental programmes and the \r\nmobilization of resources for the implementation of \r\nAfrica’s priority programmes and projects. It remains \r\ncentral to the collective manner in which the African \r\nUnion and Africa will be doing business collectively. \r\nThe role of the NEPAD Agency in conducting and \r\ncoordinating research and in knowledge management \r\nwill create an enabling environment to help Africa \r\nachieve the food security, agricultural development and \r\n A/66/PV.32\r\n \r\n5 11-53871 \r\n \r\ninfrastructure expansion — all, we hope, in the next \r\n5 to 10 years. \r\n In that regard, the African Group looks forward to \r\nconstructive engagements during the forthcoming \r\ninformal consultations on the need to establish a \r\nmonitoring mechanism to follow up on all \r\ncommitments related to Africa’s development needs. \r\nWith the mechanism in place, the Group hopes that \r\ncommitments by both African Governments and their \r\ndevelopment partners will be reviewed and enhanced, \r\npossibly by the beginning of the sixty-seventh session \r\nof the General Assembly. \r\n Malaria infects over 170 million Africans each \r\nyear, crippling economic growth and undermining the \r\ngrowth of gross domestic product (GDP), to the tune of \r\na 2 per cent loss in growth every year. In the African \r\nLeaders Malaria Alliance (ALMA) heads of State and \r\nGovernment are determined to remove that debilitating \r\nimpediment to progress once and for all. As members \r\nof the African Union and of ALMA, heads of State and \r\nGovernment pledged to end the scourge of malaria. \r\nThose efforts have the potential to bear fruit and save \r\nat least $12 billion per annum in direct costs, freeing \r\nup much needed resources for implementation, service \r\ndelivery and acceleration of development. \r\n It is encouraging to know that in high-burden \r\nAfrican countries that have achieved high rates in \r\nproviding their populations with insecticide-treated \r\nnets and treatment programmes, recorded cases and \r\ndeaths due to malaria have fallen by 50 per cent. This \r\nhas greatly supported the achievement of MDG 6 and \r\nhas helped to reverse the incidence of malaria \r\nthroughout the continent. In addition, the findings that \r\nthe lives of more than 750 million children across \r\n34 malaria-endemic African countries have been saved \r\nthrough vector control have been very encouraging. \r\n In conclusion, I wish to state that the United \r\nNations Conference on Sustainable Development — \r\nthe Rio+20 Summit — to be held in June next year in \r\nBrazil constitutes an important opportunity to reaffirm \r\nand renew political commitment to implement previous \r\ndecisions and undertakings in accordance with the Rio \r\nDeclaration, Agenda 21, the Johannesburg Plan of \r\nImplementation and all of the relevant outcomes of the \r\nmajor conferences and summits on sustainable \r\ndevelopment. The Conference must therefore aim to \r\nachieve substantive progress on its objectives and \r\nthemes.  \r\n In that regard, the African Group is committed to \r\nworking with all partners and stakeholders to take \r\nforward the needed action to ensure the success of the \r\nConference. Accordingly, the continent is already \r\nholding consultative meetings in line with the Malabo \r\nDeclaration adopted by the heads of State and \r\nGovernment of the African Union in June. We will \r\nwork towards the formulation of a common position \r\nduring the forthcoming Africa regional preparatory \r\nconference on Rio+20, scheduled to take place at the \r\nAfrican Union headquarters in October. The African \r\nGroup wishes to reiterate that the objectives and \r\nthemes of the Conference are mutually supportive and \r\nmust be pursued in a comprehensive and integrated \r\nmanner. \r\n Mr. Talbot (Guyana): In today’s debate on the \r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), I \r\nhave the honour, on behalf of the member States of the \r\nCaribbean Community (CARICOM), to renew our \r\nsolidarity and partnership in the cause of Africa’s \r\nprogress.  \r\n I wish to begin by paying tribute on behalf of our \r\nCommunity to the life and memory of a distinguished \r\ndaughter of Africa: the noted environmentalist, \r\nwomen’s activist and Nobel laureate Wangari Maathai \r\nof Kenya, whose passing is a loss not only to her native \r\nhome, but to Africa and to the world. Ms. Wangari \r\nserved the cause of peace and sustainable development \r\nas a champion for the downtrodden. \r\n CARICOM also extends sincere congratulations \r\nto the three joint recipients of the 2011 Nobel Peace \r\nPrize, two of them from Africa: Her Excellency \r\nMrs. Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, President of Liberia, her \r\ncompatriot Ms. Leymah Gbowee and Ms. Tawakkul \r\nKarman of Yemen. They have distinguished themselves \r\nas a potent force for change in the face of towering \r\nodds. We hope that women everywhere will take \r\ncourage and inspiration from that development. \r\n In this tenth anniversary year of the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development, CARICOM \r\nreaffirms its strong support for NEPAD. The New \r\nPartnership represents Africa’s blueprint for \r\nsocio-economic advancement for the benefit of the \r\nmore than one billion people who call the continent \r\nhome. CARICOM’s support for NEPAD is based on \r\nfundamental respect for Africa’s ownership and \r\nleadership of its own development process. The \r\nsuccess of NEPAD will contribute to enabling Africans \r\nA/66/PV.32  \r\n \r\n11-53871 6 \r\n \r\nto fulfil the promise of their potential and Africa to \r\nassume its rightful place in the global economy. \r\n Much has changed on the continent since our last \r\ndebate on these issues, during the sixty-fifth session \r\n(see A/65/PV.30 and A/65/PV.31). We have witnessed \r\nmomentous developments in North Africa and the \r\nMiddle East as people have sought to give renewed \r\nexpression to their quest for higher standards of life in \r\nlarger freedom. Those developments have doubtless \r\nbegun to change the face of Africa. The role of youth \r\nin that context will be instructive for future policy in \r\nAfrica, where on average some 60 per cent of the \r\npopulation is under the age of 25. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral has therefore rightly called attention to issues \r\npertaining to youth, education and employment on the \r\ncontinent. \r\n The past year has also seen the birth of a new \r\nAfrican State, the Republic of South Sudan. \r\nCARICOM countries welcome the Republic of South \r\nSudan into the community of independent States and \r\noffer our support to the South Sudanese people and \r\nGovernment as they embark on building the new \r\nRepublic. The actions taken so far by the international \r\ncommunity in support of that country also enjoy the \r\nappreciation of our Community. At the same time, we \r\nrecognize that several issues remain to be resolved \r\nbetween South Sudan and the Republic of the Sudan. \r\nWe urge that they be settled peacefully through \r\nnegotiations. \r\n On another front, CARICOM has been deeply \r\ntroubled by the havoc being wreaked on human life as \r\na result of the devastating famine that has struck the \r\nHorn of Africa. A number of our member States have \r\nmade tangible contributions to the humanitarian \r\nresponse effort. We urge the international community \r\nto ensure that life-giving support is extended to all \r\naffected populations throughout the region. \r\n As the Secretary-General’s report attests, recent \r\ndevelopments in Africa point to the promise and the \r\npitfalls that lie ahead for the region. The continent has \r\nrecorded positive economic growth and an \r\nimprovement in socio-economic and development \r\nindicators. At the same time, the number of people \r\nliving in extreme poverty has increased. Africa faces \r\nthe greatest risk in all the developing world of falling \r\nshort in the achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and will therefore necessarily \r\nremain a key focus for development efforts over the \r\nnext five years.  \r\n United Nations efforts in conflict prevention, \r\npeacekeeping and peacebuilding also remain critical to \r\nAfrica’s quest for durable peace and sustainable \r\ndevelopment. We welcome the focus in this regard on \r\npreventive diplomacy. CARICOM supports continued \r\nactive engagement in these areas so that the spectre of \r\nconflict and division will yield to a new paradigm \r\nwhere the vast resources of its many great people will \r\nbe deployed in service of their welfare and to lay the \r\nfoundations for enduring progress.  \r\n The successes recorded in recent years in United \r\nNations peacekeeping in Africa and the emergence of \r\nmore African countries from conflict are encouraging \r\nsigns, although recovery in some instances is fragile \r\nand the risk of relapse is still very present. These facts \r\nunderscore the importance of United Nations \r\npeacebuilding efforts and the imperative of creating the \r\nnecessary conditions both inside and outside the \r\ncontinent for those efforts to prosper. \r\n In many ways, therefore, Africa represents a \r\nbeacon of opportunity for international cooperation and \r\npartnership. The international community has to stay \r\nthe course, create a favourable economic environment, \r\nhonour its commitments and expand opportunities \r\nAfrica’s trade. Developed countries must fulfil their \r\ncommitments to Africa.  \r\n At the same time, South-South cooperation and \r\npartnerships are an integral part of the international \r\nresponse and are fundamentally altering the continent’s \r\neconomic relationships with the rest of the world. The \r\nCaribbean Community stands ready as a partner with \r\nAfrica to advance our mutual objectives in the \r\npolitical, economic, social, environmental and cultural \r\ndomains. \r\n Our two regions face a number of challenges in \r\ncommon, not least in the area of health. The scourge of \r\nHIV/AIDS continues to seriously affect our respective \r\npopulations. This unwelcome reality is nevertheless an \r\nopportunity for collaboration and the exchange of \r\nexperience and best practices. CARICOM is grateful \r\nfor the support extended by African countries to the \r\nCARICOM initiative on the prevention and control of \r\nnon-communicable diseases, which resulted in the \r\nadoption a Political Declaration (resolution 66/2) at the \r\nHigh-level Meeting on the Prevention and Control of \r\nNon-Communicable Diseases. The Declaration \r\n A/66/PV.32\r\n \r\n7 11-53871 \r\n \r\nprovides a framework for concerted action by the \r\ninternational community on this issue. CARICOM also \r\nstrongly supports efforts to roll back malaria on the \r\ncontinent and thereby enhance the lives and livelihoods \r\nof over 170 million Africans. \r\n CARICOM takes note of the progress recorded \r\nunder the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture \r\nDevelopment Programme in the priority areas of \r\nagriculture and food security, as well as of the actions \r\ntaken in respect of the development of infrastructure, \r\ntransport and energy. The growth of agriculture is \r\ncritical to Africa’s development prospects. CARICOM \r\nstrongly supports and encourages the work currently \r\nunder way to promote an African green revolution with \r\na view to ensuring that Africa will be self-sufficient in \r\nfood by 2015. We urge the international community to \r\ncontinue and strengthen its support for Africa’s efforts \r\nto realize these objectives. \r\n The challenge posed by climate change is a test \r\nof our common future. Africa will host the seventeenth \r\nConference of the Parties to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change in \r\nNovember and December. An ambitious and \r\ncomprehensive global response to the threat posed by \r\nclimate change is especially urgent for the many \r\ncountries in Africa, the Caribbean, the Pacific and \r\nelsewhere that are on the frontlines of this looming \r\ncatastrophe. We call for an urgent scaling-up of \r\ninternational action to ensure the delivery of credible \r\nresults when the Conference meets in Durban, South \r\nAfrica. \r\n CARICOM is ever mindful of the complex \r\ninterrelationships between governance, peace and \r\ndevelopment. The Caribbean Community promotes and \r\nencourages the adherence to democratic principles, \r\ngood governance, the rule of law and the protection of \r\nhuman rights. We support the ongoing efforts of \r\nAfrican countries to improve economic and political \r\ngovernance and to strengthen mechanisms for the \r\nparticipation, inclusion and empowerment of all \r\nsegments of African society.  \r\n The instrumental role of the African Peer Review \r\nMechanism in these efforts is worthy of note, as is the \r\nsupport of the Mechanism as reflected by the \r\n30 African countries that have so far subscribed to it. \r\nCARICOM also believes that focused efforts must \r\ncontinue to be made to eliminate the combination of \r\ninternal and external factors that engender conflict and \r\nstymie development. \r\n The African continent, which served as a cradle \r\nof ancient civilization and the birthplace of the Arab \r\nSpring, now beckons as a new frontier of human \r\nprogress. As Africa charts its way forward, the \r\ncontinued support of the international community \r\nremains vital to its success. But that success will not be \r\nAfrica’s alone; the fruits of progress on the continent \r\nwill inevitably contribute to progress in other parts of \r\nthe world. CARICOM will continue to stand as a \r\nwilling partner in the cause of Africa’s progress. \r\n Mrs. Kaur (India): It gives me great pleasure to \r\nattend today’s joint debate on the New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD) and the promotion of \r\npeace and development in Africa, including in its \r\nefforts to fight malaria.  \r\n In the immortal words of India’s first Prime \r\nMinister, Mr. Jawaharlal Nehru, Africa is our sister \r\ncontinent. India’s links with Africa are civilizational; \r\nthey are anchored in centuries of trade across the \r\nIndian Ocean, in the shared struggle against the yoke \r\nof colonialism, in our endeavour of post-colonial \r\nnation-building, and in our common quest to unshackle \r\nour people from the bondage of poverty, disease, \r\nhunger, illiteracy and apartheid. We also owe a debt of \r\ngratitude to that great continent for being the political \r\nbirthplace of the father of our nation, Mahatma \r\nGandhi, who first tested his central precepts of non-\r\nviolence and peaceful resistance in South Africa. \r\n After the adoption of NEPAD, it is befitting to \r\nrecognize the noteworthy progress made so far in \r\npursuing sectoral priorities in agriculture, \r\ninfrastructure, health, education, science, information \r\ntechnology and the environment. Nevertheless, this \r\ndecadal milestone also offers an opportunity for sober \r\nreflection on the unfinished tasks ahead in fulfilling the \r\nvision of socio-economic growth and sustainable \r\ndevelopment that was envisaged when the framework \r\nwas first conceived. \r\n Particularly relevant to this discussion is the \r\npivotal contribution of international cooperation to \r\nAfrica’s development, especially in its efforts to make \r\nprogress towards the Millennium Development Goals \r\nand in surmounting the difficult challenges confronting \r\npost-conflict and transitional societies in Africa. \r\nA/66/PV.32  \r\n \r\n11-53871 8 \r\n \r\n As rightly emphasized by the Secretary-General \r\nin his report (A/66/202), the international community \r\nneeds to step up its efforts and bridge the gap between \r\npromise and delivery. The shortfall of $18 billion in \r\nmeeting official development assistance commitments \r\nto Africa is a cause for concern. In these times of \r\npolitical uncertainty and fragile transitions in many \r\nAfrican countries, it is more crucial than ever for the \r\ncontinent’s development partners to stay the course and \r\nhelp African countries to achieve their development \r\ngoals. \r\n On India’s part, we have together with our \r\nAfrican partners, transformed our age-old and special \r\nengagement into an enduring and multidimensional \r\nrelationship. Having been carefully nurtured over \r\nsuccessive years, our partnership with Africa today is \r\naligned with the priorities integral to the development \r\ngoals of Africa and is built on the foundations of \r\nmutual equality and common benefit. Sectoral areas of \r\ncooperation that have been accorded high priority \r\ninclude infrastructure development, capacity-building, \r\nagriculture, health, food security and technical \r\ncooperation. \r\n Earlier this year, we reaffirmed our abiding \r\ncommitment to working with our African partners at \r\nthe Second India-Africa Forum Summit, held in Addis \r\nAbaba in May. At the Summit, India announced fresh \r\nlines of credit worth $5 billion over the next three \r\nyears for Africa and an additional $700 million in grant \r\nassistance for human resource development, \r\ntechnology transfer and the creation of new institutions \r\nand training programmes, in consultation with the \r\nAfrican Union, the regional economic communities and \r\nour African partners. \r\n In keeping with NEPAD’s emphasis on \r\ninfrastructure development, we have also decided to \r\nsupport the development of the new Ethio-Djibouti \r\nRailway in the amount of $300 million. We are also \r\ndiscussing with the African Union how to increase \r\ncapacity in the development of regional railway \r\nstructures. \r\n Building on the success of the Pan African \r\ne-Network project, which shares with all African \r\ncountries our expertise in the fields of health care, \r\neducation through satellite, fibre optics and wireless \r\nlinks, we are looking at setting up an India-Africa \r\nvirtual university. The proposed university will set \r\naside 10,000 new scholarships for African students. In \r\naddition, we are going to significantly raise the number \r\nof African beneficiaries of our scholarships and \r\ntraining slots, including under our flagship technical \r\nand economic assistance initiative, the Indian \r\nTechnical and Economic Cooperation Programme. We \r\nhave committed ourselves to offering more than 22,000 \r\nscholarships to African students over the next three \r\nyears. \r\n With a view to encouraging trade and investment \r\nflows, there is also a proposal to establish an India-\r\nAfrica business council. India is already unilaterally \r\nmaking available duty-free and quota-free market \r\naccess for goods from 34 of the least developed \r\ncountries (LDCs) in Africa, which covers 94 per cent \r\nof India’s total tariff lines and provides preferential \r\nmarket access on tariff lines that comprise 92.5 per \r\ncent of the global exports of all the LDCs. \r\n India’s private sector has played an increasingly \r\nimportant role in recent years in supporting trade and \r\ninvestment flows. Indian companies have made large \r\ninvestments in African industry, agriculture, services, \r\nhuman resource development and infrastructure. The \r\nIndian conglomerate Tata has emerged as the second \r\nlargest investor in sub-Saharan Africa. New initiatives \r\nto establish an India-Africa food processing cluster, an \r\nIndia-Africa integrated textiles cluster, an India-Africa \r\ncivil aviation academy, an India-Africa centre for \r\nmedium-range weather forecasting, and an India-Africa \r\ninstitute for agriculture and rural development are all \r\non the anvil. \r\n India has also contributed actively in efforts to \r\nmaintain peace and security on the African continent \r\nthrough our six-decade involvement in United Nations \r\npeacekeeping efforts. Our most substantial presence \r\nremains in Africa, including in the latest peacekeeping \r\nmission in South Sudan. Further, India will contribute \r\n$2 million to the African Union Mission in Somalia, in \r\nline with our consistent support to the development of \r\nAfrican capacities in the maintenance of peace and \r\nsecurity. We have consistently held the position that the \r\ninternational community must further encourage \r\nregional and subregional organizations in Africa to \r\nplay a more important role both in peacekeeping and in \r\npeacebuilding issues within Africa. \r\n Before concluding, I would like to speak on the \r\nglobal anti-malaria campaign, particularly in Africa, \r\ndealt with in the World Health Organization report \r\ntransmitted by the Secretary-General (A/66/169). The \r\n A/66/PV.32\r\n \r\n9 11-53871 \r\n \r\nreport emphasizes the need to intensify efforts to reach \r\nrecently revised and more ambitious targets by 2015. \r\nThe analysis presented in the report draws on empirical \r\nevidence to suggest a strong link between the injection \r\nof significant funding and the rise in the number of \r\nlives saved as a result of anti-malaria efforts. The fact \r\nthat funding has stagnated in the past two years is \r\ntherefore particularly worrisome. We would urge all \r\ndonors to step up efforts at this critical juncture. \r\n India’s own cooperation agenda with Africa \r\nincludes capacity-building programmes for medical \r\nand health specialists to tackle such pandemics as \r\nmalaria, filariasis, polio, HIV and tuberculosis. India’s \r\nprivate sector has been investing in establishing \r\npharmaceutical manufacturing facilities in African \r\ncountries. We are willing to do more. \r\n In conclusion, India’s vision of the twenty-first \r\ncentury sees a great and dynamic role for Africa as an \r\nemerging growth pole of the world. We will offer our \r\nfullest cooperation to translate this vision into reality. \r\nWe will take our partnership, founded on mutual \r\nsolidarity and kinship, from pillar to pillar, to harness \r\nthe great potential of the more than 2.1 billion Indians \r\nand Africans. \r\n Mr. Benmehidi (Algeria) (spoke in French): \r\nToday’s debate on progress in the implementation of \r\nthe New Partnership for Africa’s Development \r\n(NEPAD) and international support for that initiative is \r\nimportant on three counts. \r\n It enables us to engage the international \r\ncommunity with the celebration of the tenth \r\nanniversary of NEPAD. It also allows this universal \r\nforum to assess the multidimensional changes that have \r\ntaken place in Africa since NEPAD began and the \r\nlaunch of its renewal programme. Finally, it is a \r\nvaluable framework for assessing the contributions of \r\nthe international community and to give new impetus \r\nto the global partnership in support of the dynamic \r\nbeing pursued towards new progress in Africa. \r\n We note first that NEPAD was born of the \r\nrealization that we needed to raise Africa out of its \r\nmarginalization and that Africans themselves needed to \r\ntake ownership of the political, economic and social \r\ndevelopment of the continent. Africa must itself make \r\nthe main effort in its process of renewal, which will \r\nrequires a qualitative change in its relationship with the \r\nrest of the world, replacing traditional modes of \r\ncooperating with a genuine partnership based on \r\nreciprocal commitments. \r\n That is why, since it was launched, NEPAD has \r\nbeen a credible approach to fomenting change to \r\nrespond consistently to the interrelated challenges of \r\npeace and security, good governance and the \r\noptimization of the human and economic potential of \r\nAfrica. \r\n After 10 years of implementation of this \r\nmultidimensional approach to development, we can \r\nnow see significant results in three strategic areas.  \r\n In the area of peace and security, undeniable \r\nprogress has been made in conflict prevention, \r\nsettlement and management. That willingness on the \r\npart of Africa to strengthen its leadership in the area of \r\npeace and security on the continent is opening the way \r\nfor greater opportunities to solve long-standing \r\nconflicts and solve new crises.  \r\n On the subject of governance, it is widely \r\nrecognized that democracy is now widespread and that \r\nits further entrenchment is making good progress. \r\nLikewise, our economies are being increasingly well \r\nmanaged. In the area of human development, \r\nsignificant progress has been made through an increase \r\nin public expenditure on education and health care and \r\nreforms to improve the quality of and access to \r\neducation. Particular attention has been paid to \r\nagricultural development through increased \r\ninvestment, research and the introduction of techniques \r\ndeveloped to increase production of basic foodstuffs, \r\nwhich is vital to food security.  \r\n All of those factors together have contributed to \r\nan average growth rate of 5 per cent over the past \r\ndecade, for the first time exceeding the rate of \r\npopulation growth. Incidentally, the pace of growth \r\ncould have been even higher if the international \r\nenvironment had been more favourable, but the global \r\nfinancial, economic, food and climate crises have \r\naffected the dynamics of growth and the fight to reduce \r\npoverty, compromising our ability to achieve some of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. \r\n Allow me to underline that NEPAD has become \r\nthe reference point for the activities of international \r\npartners and institutions that support African \r\ndevelopment programmes. For their part, the agencies \r\nof the United Nations system have integrated the \r\napproach and goals of NEPAD into their respective \r\nA/66/PV.32  \r\n \r\n11-53871 10 \r\n \r\noperations. That has undoubtedly contributed to \r\nimproving the consistency of international cooperation.  \r\n The dynamic process that Africa has undertaken \r\nand the convergence of approaches with its partners \r\nhave made it possible to develop a promising \r\npartnership. We are all aware that the challenges of \r\nachieving stability and development and the fight \r\nagainst poverty require even further collective effort to \r\nmaintain and accelerate the process of African renewal. \r\nThe priority areas for a strengthened partnership in this \r\nnew phase are the promotion of investment in job \r\ncreation, the development of infrastructure networks at \r\nthe national and regional levels, the facilitation of \r\naccess to markets for African exports, the \r\ndiversification of our economies, and regional \r\nintegration.  \r\n The excellent report of Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon on NEPAD (A/66/202) reflects the clear \r\nresolve of the United Nations to engage even further \r\nand in a more coordinated way in responding to the \r\npriorities and needs of Africa and to help it in its drive \r\nto spur renewed efforts. The development of Africa, so \r\nvital to its peoples, should also be seen as an \r\nopportunity for the world economy and as a \r\ncontribution to the economic and social progress of all \r\nof humankind. \r\n Mr. Sene (Senegal) (spoke in French): At the \r\noutset, I should like to extend the thanks of the \r\nRepublic of Senegal to the President of the Assembly \r\nfor convening this important debate on the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD). This \r\nyear we celebrate the tenth anniversary of its adoption \r\nin July 2001 in Lusaka as a result of combining the \r\nMillennium Africa Recovery Plan and the Omega Plan \r\nof President Abdoulaye Wade of Senegal. \r\n In the same vein, I would like to express my \r\ndelegation’s appreciation to the Secretary-General for \r\nthe excellent reports he has prepared, featuring \r\npertinent and useful recommendations for the \r\nsocio-economic renewal of the African continent. \r\n The continent-wide initiative that is NEPAD has \r\nalways been founded on a concept of development \r\nfrom within and a will for remediation of the \r\ninstitutional and infrastructural disparity between \r\nNorth and South through a partnership of equals that \r\ncircumvents the constraints of assistance. NEPAD \r\noffers a new concept of the nature and focus of the \r\nrelations Africa should have with the rest of the world. \r\nNEPAD’s ambitious programme exhorts Africa to take \r\nprinciple responsibility for its own development, but it \r\nalso posits actions on the part of the international \r\ncommunity to assist our continent in its tireless efforts \r\nto free itself from the circumstances of \r\nunderdevelopment. \r\n As the Secretary-General highlights so well in his \r\nreport (A/66/202), it is clear today that, in the course of \r\nNEPAD’s first 10 years, Africa has made significant \r\nprogress in many respects, especially in quelling \r\nhotbeds of tension, restoring economic growth, good \r\ngovernance and democracy, as well as in promoting \r\nhuman rights and gender equality.  \r\n We must admit, however, that despite the \r\nencouraging signs pointed out by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, progress remains slow and difficulties \r\ncontinue to weigh heavily on our continent’s potential. \r\nIndeed, in many other areas we find the grim portrait of \r\nfailure, made bleaker by the recent economic, food, \r\nenergy and environmental crises, which have kept \r\nAfrica in intractable difficulties and left it at a \r\ncrossroads in its quest for development. \r\n Even more worrying and dire are the high \r\nstatistics on poverty, which runs at two-fifths of the \r\nAfrican population; on HIV, which has infected more \r\nthan 20 million people; on malaria, which is rampant \r\non our continent and kills 9 out of 10 of those infected \r\nworldwide; and on infant and maternal mortality. \r\nClearly, Africa will have trouble finding its economic \r\nwings if we do not mitigate those overwhelming \r\nconstraints.  \r\n It is through pledges and funding that the \r\ninternational community can really help Africa’s \r\ninitiatives. Today, the formulation of the NEPAD \r\nsectoral priorities has led to on the launch of several \r\nbuilding projects, whose success will require major \r\ninternational support. Of the $64 billion pledged at \r\nGleneagles, Africa has received only $46 billion. At the \r\nsame time, the pledge to increase by $25 billion the \r\ntotal of official development assistance to Africa has \r\nyet to be honoured. That is one illustration, among \r\nmany others, that show that the international \r\npartnerships have been slow in rising to the meet their \r\nstated expectations and goals. \r\n Of course, as I said earlier, the need for \r\ninternational assistance does not at all relieve every \r\nAfrican State of its primary responsibility to set in \r\nmotion its own development. Senegal commends the \r\n A/66/PV.32\r\n \r\n11 11-53871 \r\n \r\nSecretary-General’s recommendations that African \r\ncountries further strengthen mechanisms to ensure the \r\nparticipation, inclusion and involvement of all strata of \r\nsociety in policy and development.  \r\n The tenth anniversary of NEPAD could represent \r\na turning point in the actualization of its sectoral \r\npriorities. Resolve and leadership will be necessary to \r\ntransform the vision of Africa’s development and \r\ninternational pledges into real results and political \r\naction. We agree with the Secretary-General that \r\n “the option of ‘business as usual’ should not be \r\nan alternative as it would lead to broken promises \r\nand further delay the achievement of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals and the \r\nimplementation of NEPAD”. (A/66/202, p. 2) \r\n Senegal also welcomes the decision to integrate \r\nNEPAD into the institutional architecture of the \r\nAfrican Union Commission via the creation of the \r\nNEPAD Planning and Coordination Agency in \r\nFebruary 2010. We welcome full discussion of that \r\nmeasure, which assures the increased consistency and \r\neffectiveness of our institutional mechanisms. Senegal \r\nalso welcomes the choice made by NEPAD’s new \r\nleadership, along with the African Union Commission, \r\nto promote the continent’s development through road \r\nand railway infrastructure projects. As the lead \r\nengineer of the project to link Dakar and Djibouti, \r\nSenegal pledges to ensure the completion this \r\nambitious programme for the economic and political \r\nintegration of the continent. \r\n In the context of the African renaissance, the \r\ntouchstone of NEPAD, my country appeals to the \r\ninternational community to support initiatives whose \r\nimplementation will have a more than positive impact \r\non the future of our continent. I refer to the \r\nstrengthening of the African Peer Review Mechanism, \r\nan important lever for promoting good governance, \r\nincreasing public spending on agriculture to 10 per \r\ncent, in accordance with the Maputo Declaration, and \r\nprotecting the environment with the Great Green Wall, \r\nwhich would cross the Sahel from the Atlantic to \r\nDjibouti. These African initiatives deserve the support \r\nand assistance of the international community. \r\n African development will perforce require \r\nstability and lasting peace. In this connection, we \r\nwelcome the return of Côte d’Ivoire to constitutional \r\norder. After a period of great pain, that country is now \r\ndemonstrating to the world its ability to overcome the \r\npast and its attachment to the cardinal principles of \r\ndemocracy, justice and peace that were so dear to the \r\nfounder of the Ivorian nation, the late President Félix \r\nHouphouët-Boigny. My country believes in the genius \r\nof the Ivorian people and reiterates its unwavering \r\nsupport for that brotherly country and friend as it \r\nembarks on a sensitive phase of its march towards \r\nstability, peace and progress.  \r\n We express the same hope for peace and restored \r\nstability with regard to Somalia, Darfur and \r\nMadagascar, as well as Tunisia, Egypt and Libya. All \r\nthose countries need the special attention of the United \r\nNations if they are to achieve sustainable peace. \r\nFollowing the events collectively referred to as the \r\nArab Spring, which brought unexpected shocks to the \r\nstability of that region of Africa, Senegal reiterates its \r\nurgent call for implementation of the reforms that \r\nwould place our continent on the pedestal of lasting \r\npeace.  \r\n Senegal also wants the United Nations to focus \r\nenhanced and reinvigorated attention on the new State \r\nof South Sudan, whose arrival on the international \r\nscene marked the end of decades of crisis and tension \r\nand was the object of numerous mediation efforts, the \r\nmost decisive of which took place in Eldoret in Kenya. \r\n Africa is also facing the challenge of malaria, \r\nwhich is seriously undermining our efforts towards \r\neconomic recovery. This devastating illness continues \r\nto kill thousands of Africans, especially young people, \r\nwomen and children. We recognize the immense \r\nsacrifices that have led to increased funding for the \r\nGlobal Fund to fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and \r\nMalaria. \r\n The media continue to portray Africa as the \r\ncontinent most afflicted by economic, financial, \r\nenvironmental, energy and food crises. Africa is home \r\nto 32 of the world’s 48 least developed countries. Yet it \r\nis struggling and mobilizing with immeasurable \r\ndetermination and self-denial to emerge from the \r\nlabyrinths of poverty. It faces towering obstacles, both \r\nendogenous and exogenous, and will emerge into \r\nhealth only in the context of just and equitable \r\npartnership based on truth and sincerity, far from the \r\nlofty promises and commitments that are rarely \r\nhonoured.  \r\n Mr. Al-Shammari (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nMy delegation is honoured to participate in today’s \r\ndebate on the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nA/66/PV.32  \r\n \r\n11-53871 12 \r\n \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD). We read very closely the \r\nreport of the Secretary-General (A/66/202) on the \r\nprogress made in the implementation of and \r\ninternational support for NEPAD. Kuwait attaches \r\ngreat importance to our partnership with Africa and its \r\nconcerns and interests, given our close and historic ties \r\nwith its countries. \r\n It has been 10 years since the adoption by African \r\ncountries of NEPAD, which seeks to achieve equitable \r\ndevelopment on a large scale, to reduce poverty and to \r\nenable Africa to become economically integrated into \r\nthe world economy. We hope that sustainable \r\ndevelopment, which has repeatedly been emphasized in \r\nresolutions adopted at a number of conferences held by \r\nAfrican countries, will allow us to establish a fair \r\npartnership between developed and developing \r\ncountries in order to contribute to the stability of \r\neconomic relations between those nations. We also \r\nhope that it will lead to a fair and balanced world trade \r\nthat will respond to Africa’s special needs. \r\n At the high-level panel to evaluate progress made \r\nin the implementation of NEPAD, Deputy Secretary-\r\nGeneral Asha-Rose Migiro emphasized the slow pace \r\nof progress being made on the African continent \r\ntowards the achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. That reality, I believe, should spur \r\nus even further to help Africa overcome the obstacles it \r\nfaces in making progress towards development.  \r\n The efforts of African countries to emerge from \r\nthe vicious cycle of debt and to free up funds for \r\ndevelopment are among the major challenges that the \r\ncontinent is facing. Some highly indebted countries \r\nhave benefited from bilateral debt cancellation by \r\ndonor countries, while the International Monetary Fund \r\nhas launched an initiative for highly indebted poor \r\ncountries.  \r\n Debt cancellation is a positive step to which \r\nKuwait contributed even before the establishment of \r\nNEPAD. We call for the alleviation of the debt burden \r\nof highly indebted poor African countries, in line with \r\nthe statement made by the late Emir Sheikh Jaber \r\nAl-Ahmad Al-Sabah of Kuwait at the forty-third \r\nsession of the General Assembly in 1988, in which \r\nasked countries to cancel the debt weighing heavily on \r\nthe economies of developing countries and countries \r\nexperiencing significant economic difficulties (see \r\nA/43/PV.8). In this respect, we stress the comment in \r\nthe Secretary-General’s report that  \r\n “efforts to relieve the external debt burden of \r\nAfrican countries within the framework of the \r\nheavily indebted poor countries… debt initiative, \r\nthe multilateral debt relief initiative… and at the \r\nbilateral level, the amount of debt and debt \r\nservicing has been drastically reduced since its \r\npeak in the mid-1990s” (A/66/202, para. 54). \r\n The total external debt of sub-Saharan countries \r\nused to be 73 per cent of gross national product (GNP). \r\nThat rate was reduced to 25 per cent of GNP by 2010, \r\nwhich has freed up the funds necessary to enable those \r\ncountries to spend more on initiatives to reduce \r\npoverty and achieve the Millennium Development \r\nGoals.  \r\n Kuwait continues to provide development aid to \r\ndeveloping countries, and to African countries in \r\nparticular, through its public and private institutions. \r\nThis ongoing policy is based on our belief that \r\nsupporting the economies of African countries is \r\nimportant to helping them achieve the MDGs, which \r\nwill ultimately benefit everyone and enable us to \r\nimprove partnerships and cooperation and to strengthen \r\nthe international economic and trading systems. \r\n The Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic \r\nDevelopment helps to strengthen a number of African \r\nand international development funds, such as the \r\nAfrican Development Fund, the Arab Bank for \r\nEconomic Development in Africa and the Special \r\nProgramme for sub-Saharan Africa, as well as a \r\nnumber of financial institutions that fund African \r\ndevelopment. Kuwait has spent approximately \r\n$500 million on such initiatives. We have also helped \r\nto support the provision of basic foodstuffs and of \r\nfunds to combat HIV/AIDS. \r\n In conclusion, let me stress that African countries \r\nthemselves must strengthen their own efforts in this \r\ninternational initiative. They must reach out to the \r\ndonor countries and more emphatically raise the \r\nawareness of the international community of the need \r\nto create a NEPAD that is integrated into Africa’s \r\nstructures and operations, with the help of the public \r\nand private sectors and civil society. A partnership is \r\nnot a short-term thing; it is an ongoing process, and we \r\ncommend the pioneering role of international \r\ninstitutions in mobilizing support for this initiative. \r\nAfrican countries have made significant efforts to \r\nconvince the international community that their \r\n A/66/PV.32\r\n \r\n13 11-53871 \r\n \r\ndevelopment should be a priority and that peace and \r\nstability are essential to creating that development. \r\n It is high time that the international community \r\nmade meaningful progress in honouring its \r\ncommitments and began to help African countries to \r\nimplement a number of specific NEPAD programmes \r\nand projects, as well as in guaranteeing the climate of \r\npeace that is so essential to development. \r\n Mr. Quinlan (Australia): I thank the President \r\nfor convening this debate on the New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD) and the Decade to \r\nRoll Back Malaria in Developing Countries, \r\nParticularly in Africa. \r\n As we mark the tenth anniversary of the adoption \r\nof NEPAD, and draw closer to the deadlines we have \r\nset ourselves for the achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), it is essential that we \r\ntake stock of these issues. I will briefly address each in \r\nturn. \r\n Australia itself has rapidly expanded its \r\nengagement with the countries and institutions of \r\nAfrica in recent years. We needed to, and we have done \r\nso because we recognize Africa’s growing global role \r\nand leadership, and the opportunities and dynamism \r\nthat the continent offers. Our relationship with the \r\nAfrican Union and our development cooperation are \r\nimportant parts of this. We have tripled development \r\ncooperation with Africa since 2007. We expect it to \r\ndouble again by 2015, in an overall development \r\nassistance budget that will also have doubled by then, \r\nto around $10 billion. \r\n Our development cooperation is focused on \r\nsupporting African priorities, including those \r\nexpressed, importantly, through NEPAD, in order to \r\nachieve the MDGs. We seek to make a practical \r\ncontribution in areas where we have expertise and \r\nexperience: agriculture and food security, maternal and \r\nchild health, water and sanitation, mining governance \r\nand human resource capacity-building. NEPAD helps \r\nus, as a growing donor, by setting priorities and \r\nhelping us coordinate with regional and national \r\ninitiatives.  \r\n We welcome the integration of NEPAD into the \r\nstructures and processes of the African Union. \r\nNEPAD’s Comprehensive Africa Agriculture \r\nDevelopment Programme, as an example, has helped \r\nAustralia focus our food security assistance, \r\ncoordinating with others and avoiding duplication. I \r\nwould also like to commend the work of the African \r\nPeer Review Mechanism, a product of NEPAD, which \r\nis providing Member States with frank analysis of their \r\nprogress on governance. \r\n We should all recognize NEPAD’s achievements; \r\nwe know that. However, we must also note a few \r\nsignificant challenges as we look forward. These \r\ninclude the dangerous global economic outlook and the \r\nstalling of the Doha Round of trade negotiations. \r\nAustralia will continue to press for an ambitious, \r\ncomprehensive outcome of Doha that liberalizes trade, \r\nincluding, importantly, agricultural trade. Agricultural \r\ntrade liberalization, combined with effective aid-for-\r\ntrade activities in the region, will help Africa trade its \r\nway out of poverty. \r\n NEPAD can continue to play a useful role in \r\nsupporting improved intraregional trade, which, \r\nalthough increasing, remains too low. This could \r\ninclude supporting regional integration efforts, such as \r\nthe rationalization of regional trade agreements. \r\nNEPAD could also play an enhanced role in helping \r\nattract private sector investment in support of much-\r\nneeded and essential infrastructure development. \r\n When it comes to Africa’s development, it is \r\nimportant that donor countries do what they say they \r\nwill do, and that they honour their commitments — \r\nthat we honour our commitments. This is what \r\nAustralia seeks to do. In this spirit, we look forward to \r\nworking on the process, to be facilitated by Kenya and \r\nSweden, for establishing a monitoring mechanism to \r\nfollow up on commitments related to Africa’s \r\ndevelopment. \r\n I now turn briefly to the issue of malaria. I would \r\nlike to thank the Secretary-General and the World \r\nHealth Organization (WHO) for the report on the \r\nDecade to Roll Back Malaria (A/66/169). Australia \r\nacknowledges the impressive global gains made in \r\nmalaria control. These include saving the lives of \r\nalmost three-quarters of a million children across \r\n34 malaria-endemic African countries, representing \r\n98 per cent of the at-risk population in Africa. \r\nHowever, much more needs to be done to ensure that \r\nMDG 6 and its targets are achieved by 2015.  \r\n As we have heard, malaria continues to have a \r\nserious human and economic impact worldwide, and \r\nthe vast majority of cases and deaths still, of course, \r\noccur in Africa. As the representative of Kenya has just \r\nA/66/PV.32  \r\n \r\n11-53871 14 \r\n \r\nnoted, more than 170 million Africans are affected \r\neach year. Young children and pregnant women are \r\nparticularly afflicted. \r\n Australia’s own commitment to malaria \r\nprevention and control in Africa and other affected \r\nregions is demonstrated by our three-year, \r\n$210-million commitment to the Global Fund to Fight \r\nAIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and our multi-year \r\ncommitment through the WHO. We also support \r\nnational malaria programmes in our own immediate \r\nregion, the Asia-Pacific. Since 2003, for example, \r\nAustralia has helped reduce malaria cases by 80 per \r\ncent in Vanuatu and by more than half in the Solomon \r\nIslands. These results show that targeted action by \r\nnational Governments and their development partners, \r\nworking very closely together, can achieve significant \r\nprogress. \r\n But, of course, problems remain in this region. \r\nWe are particularly concerned about the threat posed \r\nby the emergence of drug-resistant malaria in the \r\nMekong region in Asia. The cost in terms of lives and \r\neconomic impact could be significant, particularly if \r\ndrug-resistant malaria spreads to Africa and the Pacific. \r\nAustralia, in partnership with the WHO, the Global \r\nFund and others, is commissioning research to inform a \r\nmulti-donor strategy to address drug-resistant malaria \r\nin the Mekong region. The results, of course, will \r\napply beyond. \r\n In concluding, I should say that Australia remains \r\nvery firmly committed to achieving the targets for \r\nMDG 6 by 2015, and, ultimately, to contributing to \r\nsaving the lives of millions by bringing an end to the \r\nmalaria epidemic worldwide. To do that, we must \r\naccelerate global efforts, including through effective \r\npartnerships, innovative research and increased \r\nfinancial investment. We are committed to doing so but \r\nit is, of course, a collective responsibility. \r\n Mr. Wang Min (China) (spoke in Chinese): As \r\nthe blueprint for development designed by African \r\ncountries themselves and the programme for economic \r\nand social development established by the African \r\nUnion, the New Partnership for Africa’s Development \r\n(NEPAD) embodies the strong desire of African \r\ncountries to make joint efforts for common \r\ndevelopment. With the support of the international \r\ncommunity, in recent years NEPAD has gained more \r\nsubstance, improved its mechanisms and set priority \r\nareas, such as agriculture and infrastructure, thus \r\nplaying a positive role in promoting the development \r\nand revitalization of Africa.  \r\n However, owing to factors such as the volatility \r\nof the international financial market, the political \r\ninstability of some areas, frequent natural disasters, \r\nrising food prices and the energy shortage, Africa still \r\nlags behind other regions of the world in achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). On the \r\noccasion of NEPAD’s tenth anniversary, the \r\ninternational community should use that opportunity to \r\ntake stock and to sum up experience. On that basis, it \r\nshould increase support to Africa to help it make \r\ngreater strides in implementation so as to promote the \r\nstability and prosperity of the continent. \r\n First, aid commitments should be effectively \r\nhonoured. Although the total volume of official \r\ndevelopment assistance has shown some increase in \r\nrecent years, it still falls far short of the committed \r\ngoals and Africa’s actual needs. The 2010 High-level \r\nMeeting on the MDGs called on the international \r\ncommunity to implement its aid commitments to Africa \r\n(see resolution 65/1). The Fourth United Nations \r\nConference on the Least Developed Countries adopted \r\nthe Istanbul Programme of Action, giving new impetus \r\nto efforts for the accelerated attainment of the MDGs \r\nin Africa.  \r\n The international community, in particular \r\ndeveloped countries, should effectively honour the \r\ncommitments made, increase assistance and support to \r\nAfrica, work to help Africa build capacity for self-\r\ndevelopment, and make active efforts to create \r\nfavourable international economic, trade and financial \r\nconditions for Africa. \r\n Secondly, the ownership of African countries \r\nshould be respected. In providing help to African \r\ncountries, the international community should have \r\nfaith in the wisdom of the Government and people of \r\nAfrican countries; respect the ownership and leadership \r\nof the recipient countries; respect the development path \r\nchosen by African countries themselves based on their \r\nnational conditions; support them in addressing African \r\naffairs by themselves; help Africa maintain and \r\nconsolidate peace and stability; and provide safeguards \r\nfor its development. \r\n Thirdly, active efforts are needed to tackle the \r\nchallenge of climate change. Confronted with the \r\nmultiple challenges posed by climate change, such as \r\nfrequent floods and droughts, desertification, poor \r\n A/66/PV.32\r\n \r\n15 11-53871 \r\n \r\nharvests and the degradation of the ecological \r\nenvironment, African countries urgently need to \r\nenhance their capacity for adaptation. The international \r\ncommunity should understand and support the \r\nlegitimate concerns and claims of African countries, \r\nhelp them cope with climate change as an integral part \r\nof the effort to enhance their capacity for sustainable \r\ndevelopment, and promote the full and balanced \r\ndevelopment of Africa in a comprehensive and \r\nintegrated way. \r\n Fourthly, South-South cooperation should be \r\nstrengthened. Recent years have seen vibrant trade and \r\ninvestment activities among countries of the South and \r\nthe establishment of new mechanisms and initiatives \r\namong developing countries. That has injected new \r\nvitality into South-South cooperation and vigorously \r\npromoted the economic and social development of \r\nAfrica. That kind of cooperation should be further \r\nstrengthened.  \r\n At the same time, I wish to emphasize that South-\r\nSouth cooperation is a form of mutually beneficial \r\ncooperation among developing countries. It is different \r\nfrom North-South cooperation and can only be a \r\nsupplement to, and not a substitute, for the latter. \r\n Fifthly, efforts should be made to achieve durable \r\npeace. Recently, Africa has made good progress in \r\nconflict prevention, management and settlement and in \r\npost-conflict reconstruction. The United Nations \r\nsystem, Member States and regional and subregional \r\norganizations should work in coordination and \r\ncooperation, focus on the elimination of the causes of \r\nconflict in Africa, and strengthen efforts in conflict \r\nprevention and peace consolidation.  \r\n The United Nations should strengthen \r\ncooperation with the African Union in peace, security, \r\npolitical and humanitarian areas, and support it and \r\nother regional organizations in enhancing their \r\npeacekeeping capability. The Peacebuilding \r\nCommission should reinforce its partnership with the \r\ncountries concerned, respect national ownership and \r\naddress their special needs in terms of reconstruction \r\nand social integration in a coordinated way, thus laying \r\na solid foundation for durable peace and sustainable \r\ndevelopment. \r\n China is the largest developing country in the \r\nworld. Its development remains an arduous and long-\r\nterm task. In that context, China provides assistance to \r\nAfrica within the framework of South-South \r\ncooperation as part of mutual assistance between \r\ndeveloping countries. China’s assistance to Africa dates \r\nback to 1956. The Forum on China-Africa \r\nCooperation, established in 2000, is an important \r\ncontemporary platform for dialogue between China and \r\nAfrican countries and an effective mechanism for \r\npragmatic cooperation. As of the end of 2009, there \r\nwere 51 African countries that had received assistance \r\nfrom China on a regular basis.  \r\n In providing assistance to Africa, we have \r\nadhered to the principles of equality and mutual \r\nbenefit, stressing practical results and keeping pace \r\nwith the times, without attaching any political \r\nconditions, with a view to helping African countries \r\nbuild up capacity for self-development. We have thus \r\ncreated a unique form of South-South cooperation.  \r\n China has always attached importance to and \r\nsupported NEPAD. The priority areas of China-Africa \r\ncooperation are largely consistent with NEPAD’s \r\npriority areas of agriculture, infrastructure, \r\nconstruction and human resources development. China-\r\nAfrica cooperation has made and will continue to make \r\npositive contributions to the implementation of \r\nNEPAD. \r\n As an active response to the call to roll back \r\nmalaria in developing countries, particularly in Africa, \r\nChina undertook effective cooperation with African \r\ncountries in combating malaria. Over the past three \r\nyears, China has built 30 malaria prevention and \r\ntreatment centres in African countries and provided \r\nartemisinin anti-malaria medicines worth ¥190 million, \r\nor about $30 million, contributing in no small measure \r\nto the implementation of the Global Malaria Action \r\nPlan. \r\n There is a saying in Chinese that just as distance \r\nwill test a horse’s strength, so will time reveal a \r\nperson’s heart. Going forward, whatever the future \r\nvicissitudes in the world situation may be, the \r\nfriendship of the Chinese people for the African people \r\nwill remain the same, and our determination to deepen \r\nmutually beneficial cooperation with Africa and \r\nachieve common development will endure. China will \r\nas always support the implementation of NEPAD to \r\nhelp Africa realize its tremendous potential and enable \r\nthe African people to truly benefit from global \r\neconomic and social development. \r\n Mrs. Jusu (Sierra Leone): Sierra Leone fully \r\nassociates itself with the statements made by the \r\nA/66/PV.32  \r\n \r\n11-53871 16 \r\n \r\nrepresentatives of Kenya and Argentina on behalf of \r\nthe African Group and the Group of 77 and China, \r\nrespectively. We join other delegations in thanking the \r\nSecretary-General for his comprehensive and forward-\r\nlooking reports. My delegation further expresses its \r\nappreciation to the Special Adviser on Africa, Under-\r\nSecretary-General Cheick Sidi Diarra, and his \r\ndedicated team for their advisory and advocacy work in \r\npromoting Africa’s development agenda. \r\n We are reviewing reports on the progress of \r\nimplementation of the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (A/66/202), the implementation of the \r\nrecommendations contained in the report of the \r\nSecretary-General on the causes of conflict and the \r\npromotion of durable peace and sustainable \r\ndevelopment in Africa (A/66/214) and Decade to Roll \r\nBack Malaria (A/66/169), at a very crucial and \r\nchallenging moment in global peace and security as \r\nwell as the global economic architecture. \r\n The tenth anniversary of the New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD) provides an \r\nopportunity for deeper reflection on the success and \r\nchallenges in actualizing Africa’s transformation \r\nagenda and how to leverage the various opportunities \r\nto advance sustainable development in Africa. Clearly, \r\nthe entire global community is grappling with the \r\ndeepening effect of an unprecedented economic and \r\nfinancial crisis, which undoubtedly is having a much \r\ngraver impact on the developing world. In particular, \r\nthe least developed countries, most of which are in \r\nAfrica, remain challenged by the task of attaining \r\ninternationally agreed development goals, including \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), by the \r\ntarget date of 2015. \r\n Despite the gloom, there are visible prospects on \r\nthe horizon. With the support of the international \r\ncommunity, significant progress has been made in \r\nfostering the objectives of the New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development. With accelerated growth over \r\nthe past decade, improvement in governance, the \r\nspectre of conflict receding and improvement in \r\nleadership, it is clear that Africa is at a critical turning \r\npoint. Steady progress has also been recorded in \r\nmalaria control and prevention mechanisms, with many \r\nhouseholds sleeping under insecticide-treated bed nets.  \r\n As a further commitment, some African Heads of \r\nState, including the President of Sierra Leone, have \r\ncommitted to achieving the Secretary-General’s goal of \r\nensuring universal access to malaria control \r\ninterventions and launched the African Leaders Malaria \r\nAlliance with the goal of ending preventable malaria \r\ndeaths by 2015. \r\n The integration of NEPAD into the African Union \r\nis a milestone in advancing the socio-economic \r\ntransformation agenda of the continent. It provides a \r\nwindow for strategic partnership to explore areas of \r\ncooperation to address such global challenges as the \r\ndebt issue, climate change, trade and regional \r\nintegration and sustainable development. We are \r\nencouraged by the ongoing implementation of NEPAD \r\nprojects ranging from the Comprehensive Africa \r\nAgriculture Development Programme, infrastructure, \r\nthe environment, gender mainstreaming, education and \r\ntraining in information and communication \r\ntechnologies. \r\n At the level of governance, advances in the \r\nimplementation of the African Peer Review Mechanism \r\nhave demonstrated the continent’s resolve and \r\ncommitment in promoting democracy, good \r\ngovernance, peace and stability in the continent. \r\nWorthy of note and commendation is its system of \r\nearly warning of impending threats to peace and \r\nstability in Africa. \r\n In order to build on these gains and further \r\nstrengthen our development strides, it is in the best \r\ninterest of the African countries to increase domestic \r\nsavings and lessen dependence on foreign aid. In that \r\nregard, foreign direct investment aimed at creating \r\npublic-private partnerships and a vibrant private sector \r\nremains a viable option in addressing unemployment \r\nand underemployment, as well as in promoting \r\nsocio-economic development. Among the key strategic \r\nissues, it is important to support continental resource \r\nmobilization and public-private partnerships to finance \r\nthe implementation of NEPAD.  \r\n African Governments and national and regional \r\ninstitutions, including the regional economic \r\ncommunities, need strengthened development roles to \r\nsupport the promotion of intra-Africa trade and other \r\nkey objectives. In that regard, my delegation calls upon \r\nthe NEPAD Planning and Coordinating Agency to \r\nfocus the next decade on implementation aimed at \r\nimproving Africa’s global standing and on improving \r\nthe linkages with the continent’s regional economic \r\ncommunities. The decision taken at the fourteenth \r\nAfrican Union Assembly in February 2010 to integrate \r\n A/66/PV.32\r\n \r\n17 11-53871 \r\n \r\nNEPAD into the structures and processes of the African \r\nUnion added further impetus to the role of NEPAD as \r\nthe continent’s flagship development programme. \r\n The establishment of the NEPAD Planning and \r\nCoordinating Agency as both a technical body of the \r\nAfrican Union to replace the NEPAD secretariat and as \r\nthe main institutional vehicle to deliver NEPAD’s \r\nvision and agenda was also a significant milestone. \r\n On our part as a country, despite the present food \r\nand economic crises, Sierra Leone has made \r\ntremendous progress in implementing its agenda for \r\nchange which is aligned with the Joint Vision of the \r\nUnited Nations Family for Sierra Leone. That \r\ndevelopment and the peacebuilding framework have set \r\nclear priorities targeting the drivers of growth and \r\nnecessary conditions for human development in key \r\nareas such as energy, agriculture, infrastructure, health, \r\nyouth unemployment and education. The strategies for \r\ndelivering those priorities include, among other things, \r\nimproving public service capacities and enhancing \r\npublic and private sector partnerships and our domestic \r\nfinancial system. In that regard, we are intensifying our \r\ncooperation in the context of triangular and South-\r\nSouth cooperation. \r\n There is an increasing awareness that the \r\nresponsibility for peace and security in Africa, \r\nincluding the capacity to address the root causes of \r\nconflict and to resolve conflicts in a peaceful manner, \r\nlies primarily with African countries themselves. The \r\nAfrican Union and the subregional organizations have \r\nundertaken to strengthen their capacity in conflict \r\nprevention and resolution. They are also taking the lead \r\nin peacekeeping operations on the continent.  \r\n The peaceful independence referendum in \r\nSouthern Sudan, the adoption of a new Constitution in \r\nKenya, the transition of Guinea and Niger from \r\nmilitary to civilian rule, resolving the post-elections \r\ncrisis in Ivory Coast, responding to the humanitarian \r\nsituation caused by drought in the Horn of Africa, \r\nactively seeking a peaceful resolution to the uprisings \r\nin some parts of North Africa, and the peacekeeping \r\nefforts in Darfur and Somalia are clear indications of \r\nthe continent’s preparedness to rise to the occasion, \r\nwith the much-needed support of the international \r\ncommunity and the United Nations. \r\n While these efforts are ongoing, we are also \r\nwitnessing a new wave of challenges involving violent \r\nprotests and uprisings, transnational organized crime \r\nand narcotic drug trafficking, piracy and issues of \r\ngovernance, human rights and corruption. Furthermore, \r\nwhile the reduction of extreme poverty and hunger \r\nremains the main development challenge, most African \r\ncountries are also grappling with the problems of the \r\nyouth bulge and unemployment, climate change and \r\ninadequate productive capacity.  \r\n Those challenges frustrate efforts by African \r\ncountries to achieve the MDGs. Coordinated \r\npartnerships must therefore be forged to strengthen \r\ncapacities to respond to crises and security threats \r\nassociated with the above challenges, particularly in \r\nconflict and post-conflict countries, for such \r\npartnerships remain vital in ensuring durable peace. \r\n In this connection my delegation commends the \r\ncomprehensive review, requested in 2010, of the \r\nimplementation of the 1998 recommendations of the \r\nSecretary-General on the causes of conflict and the \r\npromotion of durable peace and sustainable \r\ndevelopment in Africa, in the light of new and \r\nemerging issues affecting human security in Africa. My \r\ndelegation notes the policy proposals and \r\nrecommendations in that report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral (A/66/214). \r\n The Doha Round remains stalled. Various \r\ninternational commitments, including those made at \r\nMonterrey and Gleneagles, are yet to be fulfilled. \r\nSlower progress is recorded in addressing poverty \r\nreduction, unemployment, environmental sustainability \r\nand most health-related goals. Moreover, factors such \r\nas the additional burden imposed by the adverse impact \r\nof the global financial, food and energy crises, climate \r\nchange and weak employment growth on the continent \r\nhave constrained achievement of the MDGs.  \r\n We therefore call upon our partners to intensify \r\ntheir efforts. First, distorting trade barriers must be \r\neliminated by promoting and facilitating market access \r\nto developing countries, especially the least developed \r\ncountries. Secondly, we ask them to deliver on their \r\ncommitment to achieve the official development \r\nassistance target of between 0.15 and 0.7 per cent for \r\nthe developing and least developed countries, \r\nrespectively. Thirdly, the unsustainable debt burden of \r\nheavily indebted poor countries must be addressed. \r\n In conclusion, allow me to reiterate Sierra \r\nLeone’s commitment to furthering the objectives of \r\nNEPAD: the promotion of good governance, \r\nsustainable peace and development on the continent. \r\nA/66/PV.32  \r\n \r\n11-53871 18 \r\n \r\n Mr. Abdelaziz (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I wish to express our appreciation to the \r\nSecretary-General for his reports on the progress \r\nachieved in the implementation of the New Partnership \r\nfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD) (A/66/202), on the \r\nimplementation of the recommendations in the report \r\nof the Secretary-General on the causes of conflict and \r\nthe promotion of durable peace and sustainable \r\ndevelopment in Africa (A/66/214), and on the Decade \r\nto Roll Back Malaria in Developing Countries, \r\nParticularly in Africa (A/66/169).  \r\n I wish to align myself with the statement made \r\nearlier by the representative of Kenya on behalf of the \r\nAfrican Group. \r\n The adoption of NEPAD, 10 years ago, embodied \r\nAfrica’s common resolve to address the dual scourges \r\nof poverty and marginalization that have characterized \r\nour continent for decades, and to do so through an \r\nAfrican-owned common vision and action plan that \r\nwas rightly based on our needs and priorities. That \r\nvision was based on accountability and regional \r\ncomplementarity.  \r\n As a founding member of the NEPAD initiative, \r\nEgypt is proud of the major strides the African \r\ncountries have made over the past decade in the main \r\nthematic areas of the NEPAD agenda, particularly in \r\nagriculture and food security, regional integration, \r\ninfrastructure, human development, information and \r\ncommunication technology, the empowerment of \r\nwomen and capacity-building. \r\n By the same token, the establishment and \r\noperationalization of the African Peer Review \r\nMechanism — which includes 30 countries and \r\nrepresents more than 75 per cent of the total African \r\npopulation — is another manifestation of Africa’s \r\ncommitment to promote good governance and respect \r\nfor human rights and democratic values, which go hand \r\nin hand with other achievements in the developmental \r\nfields. \r\n Our commemoration of the tenth anniversary of \r\nNEPAD provides an important opportunity to reflect \r\nnot only on the achievements of NEPAD but also on \r\nthe challenges facing us and how to address them. In \r\nthis regard, Egypt believes that in order to consolidate \r\nthe progress made towards achieving NEPAD’s main \r\nobjectives — reducing poverty, putting Africa on a \r\nsustainable development path, increasing Africa’s \r\nintegration into the world economy and empowering \r\nwomen — African Governments and their development \r\npartners must step up their efforts in a way that leads to \r\nstronger partnerships and continued economic growth \r\nin the interest of all sectors of society.  \r\n Achieving NEPAD objectives undoubtedly \r\nrequires fairer trade terms for Africa, alleviating the \r\ndebt burden, increasing foreign direct investment \r\ninflows to Africa and addressing the marginalization of \r\nthe continent in international economic decision-\r\nmaking processes. Africa’s development partners must \r\nalso fully meet the official development assistance and \r\nother aid commitments they have made in various \r\nforums, including the Group of Eight Gleneagles \r\nSummit, the General Assembly in the political \r\ndeclaration on Africa’s development needs (resolution \r\n63/1), the High-level Meeting of the General Assembly \r\non the Millennium Development Goals, and the Fourth \r\nUnited Nations Conference on the Least Developed \r\nCountries — the majority of which are African \r\ncountries. \r\n In this context, we look forward to the \r\nconsultations on the establishment of a review \r\nmechanism to follow up on all commitments related to \r\nthe development of Africa in order to make such a \r\nmechanism operational by the end of the Assembly’s \r\nsixty-sixth session, as agreed in resolution 65/284. \r\n In the same vein, Egypt attaches great importance \r\nto the United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment and stresses that its outcome should fully \r\ntake into consideration the enormous developmental \r\nchallenges faced by Africa. \r\n Over the past months, Africa has experienced \r\nprofound changes that we believe are evidence that we \r\nare on the right path towards freedom, democracy and \r\nsocial justice. The democratic change in Côte d’Ivoire, \r\nthe changes moving towards freedom and respect for \r\nhuman rights in North Africa, the transition in Guinea \r\nand Niger, and most recently the peaceful transfer of \r\npower in Zambia are manifestations of our continent’s \r\ncommitment to fulfil its obligations regardless of the \r\nmany challenges it faces. \r\n However, if our continent is to continue on this \r\npath with resolve and persistence, more concerted \r\nnational, regional and global efforts must be directed \r\ntowards addressing the multiple and interlinked \r\nchallenges that still exist in Africa. These include \r\nintra-State conflicts, social exclusion, unconstitutional \r\nchanges of Governments, election-related violence, \r\n A/66/PV.32\r\n \r\n19 11-53871 \r\n \r\nillegal exploitation of natural resources, terrorism, \r\npiracy, food security, climate change, and illicit \r\ntrafficking in small arms, light weapons and drugs. \r\n As the interlinkage between security, \r\ndevelopment and respect for human rights has become \r\nthe fundamental basis for the work of the United \r\nNations, Egypt concurs with the Secretary-General that \r\nthere is a need to refocus existing development \r\nstrategies in order to establish stronger institutional \r\nframeworks that can better tackle the interconnected \r\nchallenges of peace and development. In particular, \r\nmore attention must be given to the problems faced by \r\nthe youth, who are the leading force of social \r\ndynamism and development in our continent. Egypt \r\nunderlines the need for all stakeholders to adopt a \r\ncomprehensive approach that focuses all their existing \r\ntools in the areas of preventive diplomacy, \r\npeacekeeping and peacebuilding on addressing the \r\ncauses of conflicts, including the socio-economic \r\nengines of those conflicts. \r\n In this context, Egypt commends the increasing \r\npartnership between the African Union (AU) and the \r\nUnited Nations, which has proven to be of significant \r\nimportance in addressing many challenges to peace and \r\nsecurity in Africa, particularly in Somalia, Côte \r\nd’Ivoire, Guinea and Niger. Egypt believes that the \r\nestablishment of the United Nations Office to the \r\nAfrican Union will positively impact AU-United \r\nNations cooperation in all areas of peace, security and \r\ndevelopment. \r\n The international community took considerable \r\nsteps during the Decade to Roll Back Malaria in \r\nDeveloping Countries, Particularly in Africa, that \r\nresulted in the successful elimination of the disease in \r\nnearly half of malaria-infected countries. In addition, \r\ntangible reductions in the infection rate were achieved \r\nin a number of other countries as a result of the \r\nprogrammes implemented in cooperation with the \r\nUnited Nations, non-governmental organizations, civil \r\nsociety organizations and the private sector. As a result \r\nof the increase in available funding for such \r\nprogrammes in Africa, access to prevention and \r\ntreatment was improved for nearly two thirds of \r\nAfricans.  \r\n However, the continuing proliferation of the \r\ndisease in many countries reaffirms the need to \r\ncontinue support and to ensure the sustainability of \r\nfunding so that the Millennium Development Goals can \r\nbe achieved by 2015, especially Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goal 6 and especially in Africa, where \r\nthe risk of infection is the highest in the world. \r\n The eradication of malaria requires a \r\ncomprehensive approach in which the implementation \r\nof national prevention and treatment programmes is \r\ncomplemented with successful, sustainable \r\ndevelopment efforts. This is particularly true with \r\nregard to revamping the infrastructure of the economic, \r\neducational and health sectors of African countries. \r\nThis would lead to early detection of and treatment for \r\ndiseases. We must spread awareness and prepare \r\ntrained personnel, and that cannot be financed by the \r\nAfrican countries alone.  \r\n Egypt reaffirms the vital role played by regional \r\norganizations and initiatives in this connection and the \r\nneed for access to the required assistance. In particular, \r\nthe African Leaders Malaria Alliance initiative has \r\nhelped sustain the national efforts of African \r\nGovernments, particularly as regards mobilizing \r\ninternational support for the implementation of \r\nprevention and treatment programmes and promoting \r\npreventive measures to combat the spread of malaria. \r\n The success of efforts to combat malaria is \r\ndirectly linked to the need to resolve the trade-related \r\nproblems connected to the intellectual property rights \r\nof existing malaria detection means and medications. \r\nThe international community has a responsibility to \r\nensure the effectiveness of the efforts to eliminate \r\nmalaria and thwart the risk of its continued \r\nproliferation in order to realize Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goal 6 by 2015. \r\n Mr. Mashabane (South Africa): This year, we \r\ncelebrate the tenth anniversary of the New Partnership \r\nfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD), which is the \r\nblueprint for the socio-economic development of \r\nAfrica’s 1 billion people and a vision for Africa’s \r\nrenewal, with the primary objective of eradicating \r\npoverty and achieving sustainable growth and \r\ndevelopment. \r\n When taking stock of the level and rate of success \r\nof cooperation within NEPAD, there is no doubt that it \r\nhas made an important contribution to accelerating the \r\npace of development in African countries. However, \r\nthe success of NEPAD is threatened by the ongoing \r\nfinancial and economic crisis, the energy crisis, the \r\nfood security crisis and the challenges of climate \r\nchange. \r\nA/66/PV.32  \r\n \r\n11-53871 20 \r\n \r\n Africa currently faces a humanitarian emergency \r\nin the Horn of Africa, which because of drought is \r\nexperiencing the most severe food crisis in the world \r\ntoday. Most African countries remain off track in terms \r\nof achieving Millennium Development Goal 1, on the \r\neradication of extreme poverty and hunger, due to the \r\nfood security crisis. \r\n In Africa, agriculture is the primary source of \r\nfood. The African leaders have established the NEPAD \r\nComprehensive Africa Agriculture Development \r\nProgramme (CAADP), which is a framework for \r\nagricultural development. The African leaders have \r\ncommitted to raising the share of their national budget \r\nallocated to agriculture to 10 per cent and, through \r\nCAADP, have called for annual agricultural growth \r\nrates of 6 per cent. \r\n The international community needs, therefore, to \r\nsupport these efforts by the African leaders by \r\ndelivering on their commitments, under the 2009 \r\nL’Aquila Joint Statement on Global Food Security, to \r\nmobilize $20 billion over three years for agricultural \r\ndevelopment, and those made at the 2009 World \r\nSummit on Food Security to increase aid substantially \r\nso that Africa can attain the objectives contained in the \r\nCAADP. \r\n Africa has increasingly emphasized the \r\nimportance of infrastructure for both economic growth \r\nand social development. In this context, the African \r\nGovernments have made commitments in energy, \r\ntransport, water and information and communications \r\ntechnology under the Programme for Infrastructure \r\nDevelopment in Africa to strengthen national planning \r\nframeworks and reform the regulatory environment to \r\nimprove the efficiency of existing infrastructure. \r\n His Excellency the President of the Republic \r\nSouth Africa, Jacob Zuma, has been elected to lead this \r\ninfrastructure development programme. South Africa is \r\ndoing its best for the African continent to achieve \r\nimproved access to integrated regional and continental \r\ninfrastructure networks and services. South Africa calls \r\nfor more investment in agriculture and infrastructure \r\non the continent. \r\n We also call for strengthening the role of the \r\nUnited Nations system in supporting NEPAD \r\ncooperation. It is vital, as we do so, that the \r\ninternational community come on board so as to \r\nenhance the NEPAD vision for Africa’s development. \r\n The world has made remarkable progress in the \r\nfight against malaria. Statistics indicate that globally, \r\nmalaria deaths have dropped greatly. However, much \r\nmore still needs to be done, especially on our \r\ncontinent, Africa, where malaria is affecting many \r\nyoung children and pregnant women. Over 90 per cent \r\nof deaths occur in Africa. Moreover, the economic \r\nimpact on the continent is huge, as an estimated \r\n$12 billion in productivity is lost annually. \r\n We commend the work done by the Roll Back \r\nMalaria Partnership to coordinate global action against \r\nmalaria. A number of new agencies end initiatives have \r\ncontributed immensely to the fight against malaria, \r\nincluding the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis \r\nand Malaria, the United States President’s Malaria \r\nInitiative, the World Bank Booster Programme for \r\nMalaria in Africa, the Bill \u0026 Melinda Gates \r\nFoundation, the International Drug Purchase Facility, \r\nthe African Leaders Malaria Alliance and the Office of \r\nthe United Nations Special Envoy for Malaria. We \r\nneed to develop more such alliances to conquer the \r\nscourge of malaria. We should further strengthen \r\nprivate and public sector partnerships and not leave \r\ncivil society behind in our endeavours. \r\n Some of the most important partnerships are \r\nthose between neighbouring countries. In the Southern \r\nAfrican region, there are a few cross-border initiatives \r\nthat have been very successful. In the Lubombo \r\nInitiative, a cross-border partnership between \r\nMozambique, Swaziland and South Africa, malaria \r\nincidence rates have dropped by 85 to 90 per cent, with \r\nthe number of deaths reduced by 90 per cent. \r\n In the MOZIZA Project, a partnership between \r\nMozambique, Zimbabwe and South Africa, a \r\nsignificant reduction in malaria cases has been realized \r\nfor the period 2000-2010 by using indoor residual \r\nspraying with DDT as the main strategy. So far, DDT \r\nhas been found to be the most effective agent in the \r\ncontrol of the malaria vector. Countries in the Southern \r\nAfrican region that adopted the use of DDT in indoor \r\nresidual spraying have significantly reduced the \r\nnumber of malaria cases by up to 80 per cent; four of \r\nthem have reached the pre-elimination stage. Vector \r\ncontrol is vital for the African region to deal effectively \r\nwith malaria. \r\n Other strategies that can help advance the success \r\nof malaria control include investment in new \r\ntechnologies, such as rapid diagnostic kits, long-lasting \r\n A/66/PV.32\r\n \r\n21 11-53871 \r\n \r\ninsecticide-treated nets, and effective anti-malaria \r\ndrugs such as vaccines, all made available at affordable \r\ncost. Some countries have done well by taking \r\nadditional measures, such as waiving taxes and tariffs \r\nfor the products needed for malaria control. \r\n Working together, we can achieve our goal of \r\neliminating malaria by 2015, so that all our people can \r\nenjoy the high standard of physical and mental health \r\nthat they deserve. We can do this successfully through \r\nincreased access to prevention, diagnosis and \r\ntreatment. \r\n Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): Russia has consistently called for greater \r\ninvolvement by the United Nations in addressing the \r\nchallenges facing Africa. We firmly believe that \r\nwithout the active, full-fledged engagement of African \r\ncountries in international affairs it will be impossible \r\nto launch fruitful cooperation on a global scale and to \r\nestablish an integral and stable global security system \r\nbased on the supremacy of international law. \r\n In order to make this a reality, we need first to \r\novercome the most acute problems that prevent the \r\nnormal economic and social development of the \r\nAfrican continent, namely, poverty, famine and disease. \r\nWe call for a comprehensive and integrated approach \r\nto a solution, and for an effective global partnership to \r\nachieve these goals based on a combination of \r\ninternational support with efficient measures by \r\nAfricans themselves. \r\n In recent years, African countries have started to \r\ntake a more active part in global political, economic \r\nand humanitarian processes. They play a notable role \r\nin the United Nations and other multilateral forums, \r\nmaking significant contributions to the development of \r\ncoordinated approaches to resolving key contemporary \r\nproblems. Africa has confidently embarked on a path \r\ntowards broad-based transformation and modernization. \r\nMuch has been done to speed up growth rates and \r\nstrengthen political, economic and cultural unity. We \r\ncall for more active and coordinated efforts on the part \r\nof Governments, international financial institutions, the \r\nbusiness community and non-governmental \r\norganizations to ensure the achievement of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals on schedule.  \r\n This year marks the tenth anniversary of the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), an \r\ninitiative of the African Union that represents the \r\naspirations of the countries of that continent to \r\ndetermine their future independently and assume basic \r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of peace and \r\nsecurity, economic governance, the sustainable use of \r\nnatural resources, the fight against corruption and the \r\neffective use of development assistance. \r\n Russia regards NEPAD as an essential benchmark \r\nand instrument for ensuring the sustainable \r\ndevelopment of Africa and actively participates in \r\ncoordinated efforts to provide comprehensive \r\nassistance both bilaterally and within the framework of \r\nexisting international mechanisms, including the Group \r\nof Eight Africa Action Plan. \r\n One of the major areas of Russia’s assistance to \r\nAfrica is the alleviation of the debt burden of countries \r\nof that region. As of late 2010, Russia has written off \r\nAfrican debt in the amount of $20 billion. We are \r\npresently holding consultations with a number of \r\nAfrican countries on signing inter-Governmental \r\nagreements to use that forgiven debt to finance \r\ndevelopment projects. The estimated total remaining \r\ndebt to be cancelled is over $500 million. By the end of \r\n2011, Russia will contribute $50 million to the World \r\nBank Trust Fund to support vulnerable countries, first \r\nand foremost in sub-Saharan Africa.  \r\n Russian humanitarian aid to the countries of the \r\nregion totalled $6 million in 2010. African countries \r\nenjoy broad trade preferences. Traditional export \r\nproducts of the least developed countries, most of \r\nwhich are in Africa, have been exempted from import \r\ncustoms duties in Russia.  \r\n We also provide substantial assistance to African \r\ncountries in the form of professional training. \r\nCurrently, more than 4,500 Africans are studying in \r\nRussian universities. Approximately 50 per cent of \r\nthem are on federal budget scholarships. In the \r\n2010-2011 academic year, the quota of Government \r\nscholarships for Africa was increased. From 2008 to \r\n2012, we will have allocated $42.9 million to the \r\nWorld Bank programme to improve the quality of basic \r\neducation in developing countries, including in Africa. \r\n Substantial assistance is provided to African \r\ncountries in the area of public health. The total amount \r\nof our voluntary contributions to the Global Fund to \r\nFight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria reached \r\n$40 million. By the end of 2011, we will have \r\ncontributed $20 million towards the implementation of \r\nthe World Bank programme to combat malaria, and an \r\nadditional $18 million to the World Health \r\nA/66/PV.32  \r\n \r\n11-53871 22 \r\n \r\nOrganization for the elimination of polio in Africa. In \r\n2010-2011, Russia continues to participate in \r\nsupporting the budget of the Secretariat of the Africa \r\nPartnership Forum in the amount of $200,000 annually. \r\n As a permanent member of the Security Council, \r\nRussia makes a significant contribution to the \r\nelaboration of strategic policy and practical measures \r\nfor the international community to strengthen peace \r\nand security in the region. We participate in many \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations in Africa. We \r\nhave significantly expanded our training programmes \r\nfor African peacekeepers and law enforcement officers. \r\nWe believe that a key factor in ensuring a prosperous \r\nfuture for the African continent is the prevention and \r\nresolution of armed conflict. We note with satisfaction \r\nthe active work of the African Union to create an \r\nAfrican standby force and an early warning system for \r\nconflicts. We welcome the open dialogue between the \r\nUnited Nations Security Council and the Peace and \r\nSecurity Council of the African Union on the \r\nresolution of acute crisis situations.  \r\n Those positive developments clearly require \r\nadditional support. A more durable peace on the \r\ncontinent requires active involvement on the part of \r\nAfricans. Measures need to be taken to combat illicit \r\narmed factions, to strengthen good neighbourly \r\nrelations and to expand cooperation in order to ensure \r\nborder security. Borders should be strengthened to \r\nprevent the spillover of conflicts and the infiltration of \r\nweapons and mercenaries, as well as to suppress mass \r\nviolations of international human rights law and \r\nimpunity for crimes against humanity.  \r\n Russia provides consistent political support to the \r\nrelevant efforts by the African community and is \r\nprepared to further assist in strengthening Africa’s \r\ncrisis prevention capacity. We are certain that all \r\nimpediments to the transformation of Africa into a \r\ncontinent of security and stability and sustainable \r\ndevelopment can be overcome on the solid basis of \r\ninternational law, African unity and the solidarity of \r\nthe friends of Africa with African nations. Naturally, \r\nRussia considers itself a friend of Africa. \r\n Mr. Prosor (Israel): The great Rabbi Hillel once \r\ndeclared, “If I am only for myself, what am I? And if \r\nnot now, when?” As we take up this important debate, I \r\nam reminded of his famous words. At this critical \r\nmoment, the international community must move \r\nforward with the urgency of Rabbi Hillel’s call, \r\nactively partnering with the New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD) to build a brighter \r\nfuture for the African continent. \r\n Today Africa stands at a turning point. Significant \r\nprogress has been made in the continent’s \r\ndevelopment. However, while we see the promise of \r\ngreat opportunities on the horizon, the challenges of \r\nthe present endure. We continue to witness drought and \r\nfamine, hunger and poverty, conflict and instability. All \r\nof these remain significant obstacles to unlocking the \r\nvast potential of Africa and its people. \r\n My country has been deeply engaged in African \r\ndevelopment for more than five decades. In 1958, \r\nGolda Meir, then serving as Israel’s Foreign Minister, \r\nundertook a historic visit to the newly independent \r\nStates of Africa. She saw first-hand that many of those \r\ncountries faced development challenges similar to \r\nIsrael’s, such as a difficult climate and poor farming \r\nconditions. \r\n Golda Meir resolved to share Israel’s growing \r\nexpertise, driven by her Zionist values and the spirit of \r\nwhat we call tikkun olam, the Jewish principle that \r\ncalls on us to “mend the world” and make it a better \r\nplace. At that time, Israel was in its infancy. We were a \r\ndeveloping nation facing a range of overwhelming \r\nchallenges. Yet she saw assistance to the newly \r\nindependent nations of Africa as an imperative. She \r\nsaid that like them, we had shaken off foreign rule; like \r\nthem, we had to learn for ourselves how to reclaim the \r\nland, how to increase the yields of our crops, how to \r\nirrigate, how to live together, and how to defend \r\nourselves. \r\n Thousands of Israeli experts of every sort — \r\nscientists, doctors, engineers, teachers and irrigation \r\nexperts — set out for the continent. Among them were \r\nmy parents, who brought me with them. As a young \r\nchild in what was then Tanganyika, I remember vividly \r\nhow Israelis worked hand in hand with their African \r\ncounterparts to share our knowledge. They worked \r\ntogether on the ground, out in the fields of farms, in the \r\nhalls of schools, and in the corridors of hospitals. The \r\nconnections that were forged in those days have \r\nblossomed into an extensive programme of cooperation \r\noverseen by MASHAV, Israel’s agency for \r\ninternational cooperation. \r\n That programme has expanded as Israel has \r\nadvanced on its own journey from a developing nation \r\nto a member of the Organization for Economic \r\n A/66/PV.32\r\n \r\n23 11-53871 \r\n \r\nCooperation and Development. In Israel, we have \r\ntransitioned from growing oranges to producing \r\nOrange mobile phones, and from cultivating apples to \r\ndesigning Apple computers. \r\n Allow me to highlight a few examples of Israel’s \r\ndevelopment cooperation in Africa today. \r\n In Ghana, Israel administers a network of \r\ncommunity-based prenatal and healthy-baby clinics, \r\nknown as tipat chalav, which is Hebrew for “a drop of \r\nmilk”. Initially developed for mothers and children in \r\nIsrael, these clinics have proved highly effective in \r\nreducing child mortality and improving maternal health \r\nin Ghana. \r\n Israel has focused extensively on education in \r\nAfrica. In 2010 alone, MASHAV trained more 1,200 \r\npeople from more than 35 African countries, both in \r\nIsrael and in their own countries. We are also providing \r\nsupport for United Nations educational programmes \r\nsuch as UNESCO’s teacher-training initiative for \r\nsub-Saharan Africa. \r\n Israel continues to provide immediate relief to \r\nAfrican nations following major crises, such as the \r\nacute humanitarian situation now facing the Horn of \r\nAfrica. In response to the crisis, Israel contributed to \r\nthe World Food Programme, supporting the delivery of \r\nfood packages to Somali refugees in Kenya. We have \r\nalso donated funds to the Ethiopian Government, \r\nwhich have been used to purchase locally produced \r\nfood aid for Somali refugees there. To address the \r\nlong-term challenges posed by the drought, MASHAV \r\ncontinues to expand its programmes that have a \r\nspecific focus on agriculture and food production. For \r\nexample, today Israel is partnering with Ghana and \r\nGermany to improve the efficiency of smallholder \r\nGhanaian citrus farmers. That project combines \r\nagricultural assistance, capacity-building and elements \r\nof microfinance and microcredit. \r\n Another highly successful Israeli project is the \r\nTechno-agricultural Innovation for Poverty Alleviation \r\nprogramme (TIPA). It has been implemented in a \r\nnumber of African countries, including as part of a \r\ntriangular partnership with Italy in Senegal. TIPA relies \r\non relatively simple, low-cost drip irrigation \r\ntechniques that allow farmers to produce crops year-\r\nround and improve the quality of their fruits and \r\nvegetables. \r\n The results of the project speak for themselves. \r\nFarmers have moved from poverty to self-sufficiency. \r\nHunger has been drastically reduced in many \r\ncommunities. Rural women have found new \r\nopportunities for empowerment. Projects such as TIPA \r\nhighlight the importance of sharing agricultural \r\ntechnology to promote sustainable development. To \r\nbring focus to this effort, Israel will be submitting its \r\nbiennial draft resolution on agricultural technology for \r\ndevelopment to the Second Committee this year. \r\n NEPAD has served as an invaluable framework \r\nfor advancing major goals on the African continent, \r\nspurring important progress. While African nations \r\nhave primary responsibility for their social and \r\neconomic development, the international community \r\nmust support and facilitate those efforts, driven by our \r\ncommon destiny and common humanity. \r\n As we take in the encouraging progress that has \r\nbeen made and resolve to meet the challenges ahead, \r\nlet us be big in our dreams and bold in our actions. \r\nGolda Meir’s clear vision of the fundamental \r\nconnection between the people of Israel and the people \r\nof Africa endures. In the same spirit as the early \r\nZionist pioneers who left their newly reborn nation to \r\nhelp plant the seeds of new nations in Africa, Israelis \r\ncontinue to stand with our brothers and sisters on the \r\ncontinent as they seize the promise of new \r\nopportunities.  \r\n In Hebrew we say hineni, meaning “Here I am”. \r\nOn Africa’s journey towards growth and prosperity, \r\nIsrael is here — as a supporter, as a partner and as a \r\nfriend. \r\n Mr. Osman (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): My \r\ndelegation wishes at the outset to congratulate \r\nMr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on his election to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth \r\nsession. We firmly believe that thanks to his wisdom \r\nand skills, we will achieve the objectives we have set \r\nfor this session. \r\n Development efforts in Africa since the launching \r\nof the New Partnership for Africa’s Development \r\n(NEPAD) have not lived up to our expectations. We \r\nhave reached the midway point in the implementation \r\nof the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), slated \r\nfor achievement by 2015; however, Africa remains the \r\nonly continent that continues to face major obstacles in \r\neliminating poverty and want — hence the need to \r\nredouble our efforts in the area of international \r\nA/66/PV.32  \r\n \r\n11-53871 24 \r\n \r\ncooperation to implement NEPAD projects and to \r\nhonour the commitments made. That needs to be done \r\nas swiftly as possible in order to permit the African \r\ncontinent to achieve its sustainable development goals.  \r\n The response to Africa’s development needs, the \r\nevaluation of the implementation of commitments, and \r\naddressing existing challenges are all positive steps \r\ntowards strengthening NEPAD. The report of the \r\nSecretary-General on progress in the implementation of \r\nand international support for NEPAD (A/66/202) \r\nunderscores the commitment of Heads of State and \r\nGovernment and the United Nations to focus on the \r\nneeds of Africa, as set forth in the Millennium \r\nDeclaration (resolution 55/2) and reflected in the \r\nMonterrey Consensus and the Johannesburg Plan of \r\nImplementation.  \r\n Above and beyond the harnessing of financial, \r\nhuman and technical resources for the elimination of \r\npoverty, hunger and underdevelopment, we need to \r\ntranslate our commitments into concrete action. In this \r\nconnection, we call on the international community to \r\nhonour its commitments to eradicating poverty and \r\nstrengthening sustainable development in the context \r\nof a new, fair and comprehensive world economic \r\norder that takes into account the needs of developing \r\ncountries, especially in Africa, and enables them to \r\ngain access to international markets. \r\n The role of regional organizations in peacebuilding in \r\nAfrica is crucial to the cause of building lasting peace, \r\nparticularly in post-conflict countries. In this connection, \r\nwe call for the full implementation of the 10-year capacity-\r\nbuilding programme for the African Union, which is \r\ndesigned, inter alia, to enhance Africa’s peacekeeping \r\ncapacities. We also call for the consolidation of related \r\nmechanisms in the context of NEPAD. \r\n Peace is a prerequisite for economic and social \r\ndevelopment. The Sudan has extensive experience in \r\nconflict resolution and peacebuilding. Resource-\r\nsharing arrangements are essential components of the \r\ncomprehensive peace agreements in South Sudan, East \r\nSudan and Darfur.  \r\n Paragraph 7 of the Secretary-General’s report on \r\nthe causes of conflict and the promotion of durable \r\npeace and sustainable development in Africa \r\n(A/66/214) refers to the situation in Abyei. Let me say \r\nthat, since the entry of the Sudanese Armed Forces into \r\nAbyei, security and stability have been restored and \r\nthere have been no incidents of destabilization there. \r\nThe Government of the Sudan is committed to \r\nimplementing Security Council resolution 1990 (2011) \r\non the deployment of forces in Abyei and is \r\ncooperating with all parties to facilitate the deployment \r\nof Ethiopian peacekeepers in the region. In this way, \r\nthe situation in Abyei can be kept under control until a \r\ndefinitive peaceful settlement is reached that enables \r\nall inhabitants of the region, regardless of their ethnic \r\norigin, to engage in economic activities.  \r\n The report also mentions that military attacks in \r\nSouthern Kordofan have led to large population \r\ndisplacements from that region. My delegation notes \r\nthat the attacks were the result of clashes between \r\nnorthern and southern rebel movements that were \r\ntriggered when the leader of the southern forces lost \r\nthe gubernatorial election in Southern Kordofan. The \r\nrebels took up arms against the population, which \r\nindeed resulted in large displacements. The Sudanese \r\nArmed Forces then intervened in accordance with our \r\nConstitution and national duty, with a view to restoring \r\npeace in the south. In the wake of these events, the \r\ndisplaced persons have returned to their homes and \r\nresumed their agricultural activities for the \r\ndevelopment of the region. \r\n We call on the United Nations to persuade the \r\nrebels to honour their commitments under the \r\nComprehensive Peace Agreement, return to \r\nnegotiations, demobilize and lay down their arms in \r\norder to reach a peaceful settlement, which is a \r\nprerequisite for countries in conflict to achieve \r\nsustainable development within the framework of \r\nNEPAD. In this context, we reiterate our unwavering \r\ncommitment to the peaceful settlement of all conflicts \r\nthrough negotiation. \r\n Turning now to agenda item 13, “Decade to Roll \r\nBack Malaria in Developing Countries, Particularly in \r\nAfrica”, as the Assembly knows, malaria affects a very \r\nlarge number of people; more than 3.3 billion — half \r\nthe world’s population — have been exposed to this \r\nserious disease. The Sudan is also affected by malaria, \r\nregistering more than 7 million cases a year. According \r\nto scientific studies, the negative impact of climate \r\nchange has increased the prevalence of the disease. The \r\nincrease in temperatures is leading to a longer life \r\ncycle for the mosquitoes that carry the parasite. The \r\neconomic and social impact of malaria has been great \r\nin my country. Consequently, we have developed a \r\nnational anti-malaria strategy and established a special \r\n A/66/PV.32\r\n \r\n25 11-53871 \r\n \r\nunit to control the spread and monitor the progress of \r\nthe disease. \r\n Let me conclude by saying that the economic \r\nslowdown worldwide, the increase in food prices, and \r\nclimate change are all factors that have led to slower \r\nprogress in the implementation of NEPAD and in \r\nfighting malaria, and are hampering the attainment of \r\nthe MDGs by 2015. Our development partners must \r\ntherefore step up their efforts to honour their \r\ncommitments with a view to resolving the debt morass \r\nin which many African countries are mired. Many \r\nAfrican countries, especially post-conflict countries, \r\ncontinue to suffer from high indebtedness and are \r\nconsequently experiencing slower sustainable \r\ndevelopment. \r\n Mr. Husain (Canada) (spoke in French): Canada \r\nonce again welcomes the opportunity to participate in \r\nthis debate. The African continent has enormous \r\npotential, and we note with satisfaction its recent \r\nremarkable economic growth, higher than that of many \r\nother regions of the world. The significant progress \r\nAfrica has made, especially in strengthening \r\ndemocracy and promoting peace and security, is a sign \r\nof a promising future. Canada is also encouraged by \r\nthe maturation of African institutions, which promotes \r\nregional integration and security. \r\n However, Canada also recognizes that African \r\ncountries continue to face major challenges. Much \r\nremains to be done to work with African countries in \r\norder to address those challenges and assist them in \r\nmeeting their development objectives.  \r\n Canada is doing its part to help Africa achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. Almost half of \r\nCanada’s bilateral development assistance has gone to \r\nAfrica in recent years, and Canada has met its Group of \r\nEight (G-8) commitment to double aid to Africa from \r\nthe 2003-2004 levels to $2.1 billion. Furthermore, \r\nCanada has reached its commitment to double \r\ninternational assistance by the years 2010 to 2011 from \r\nthe 2001-2002 levels, bringing Canada’s total \r\ninternational assistance to approximately $5 billion. As \r\npart of the joint G-8 pledge on food security, Canada \r\nwill more than double its investment in food security \r\nand sustainable agricultural development by providing \r\n$600 million in increased funding over three years, \r\nreaching $1.18 billion in overall funding. Canada has \r\nuntied all its food aid. \r\n As President of the G-8 in 2010, Canada ensured \r\nthat African issues were a key part of the agenda. \r\nConsultations with African countries in the lead up to \r\nthe G-8 Summit helped to shape the Muskoka Initiative \r\non maternal, newborn and child health, which will \r\ngenerate funds reaching more than $7 billion, with \r\nmost of Canada’s contribution to the Initiative being \r\nallocated to Africa.  \r\n In addition, private-sector investment, which \r\nplays a crucial role in Africa’s development, has added \r\nto Canada’s traditional aid to Africa. Export \r\nDevelopment Canada has added its support for \r\nbusinesses with over Can$1.3 billion worth of business \r\nin sub-Saharan Africa. More precisely, it has assisted \r\n194 Canadian companies in 38 countries in Africa in \r\n2010. That same year, Canadian bilateral trade with \r\nAfrica reached almost $13 billion in 2010, a 72.5 per \r\ncent increase over the past five years. \r\n When it comes to corporate social responsibility, \r\nCanada not only encourages Canadian companies to \r\nabide by strict standards, it insists on it. To further \r\nencourage Canadian investment in Africa, we need to \r\nencourage our African partners to continue to work \r\ntoward reforming their business environments to create \r\nmore transparent rules and better governance. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n Canada sees the development of key African \r\nmultilateral institutions, such as the African Union, the \r\nUnited Nations Economic Commission for Africa and \r\nthe African Development Bank, as vehicles to help \r\nachieve an enabling environment for stability, regional \r\nintegration, and socio-economic development. \r\n Canada strongly supports the African Peer \r\nReview Mechanism as a key initiative in promoting \r\nAfrican ownership and accountability for democratic \r\ngovernance and economic management, and we have \r\ncontributed over $5 million to the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme Trust Fund.  \r\n Canada also maintains a strong commitment to \r\nregional and multilateral initiatives to advance global \r\nmalaria prevention and control efforts. In September \r\n2010, Prime Minister Harper announced that, with our \r\ncontribution of $540 million to the Global Fund to \r\nFight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, Canada’s \r\ncontribution to date will rise to more than $1.5 billion. \r\nThat is the single largest contribution by Canada to a \r\nglobal health organization.  \r\nA/66/PV.32  \r\n \r\n11-53871 26 \r\n \r\n Canada continues to engage with our African \r\ncounterparts to work towards solutions to protracted \r\nconflicts across the continent, both through direct \r\nbilateral contacts and through our engagement in \r\nsupport for continental and regional African \r\ninstitutions such as the African Union (AU). Although \r\nchallenges remain, those organizations are increasingly \r\ndemonstrating clear capacity and leadership to address \r\npeace and security challenges on the continent. \r\n Despite the peaceful secession of South Sudan on \r\n9 July 2011, the security situation in both the Sudan \r\nand South Sudan is fragile, particularly along their \r\nshared border. The contested region of Abyei remains a \r\ndeep concern, while devastating conflict has \r\nre-emerged in the border states of Southern Kordofan \r\nand Blue Nile, severely affecting over 300,000 people. \r\nHumanitarian access to affected populations in those \r\ntwo states remains severely constrained. International \r\nsupport continues to be necessary to address \r\noutstanding North-South issues, the fragile political \r\nsituation in both countries and the conflicts in Darfur \r\nand along the border. \r\n Since 2006, Canada has contributed over \r\n$885 million in support of peace and humanitarian \r\nobjectives in the two Sudans, including support for the \r\nimplementation of the Comprehensive Peace \r\nAgreement and the Darfur peace process, as well as for \r\nthree Security Council-mandated peacekeeping \r\nmissions. Canada fully supports the considerable \r\nengagement and contribution that the African Union \r\nand African countries are making to enhance peace and \r\nsecurity in the two Sudans, most notably through the \r\nAfrican Union High-level Implementation Panel, the \r\nUnited Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei and \r\nthe African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in \r\nDarfur. \r\n In the Great Lakes region, Canada continues to \r\nsupport regional peace and stability through the \r\nInternational Conference on the Great Lakes Region \r\n(ICGLR), which implements regional solutions to deal \r\nwith the complex challenges there. As co-chair of the \r\nGroup of Friends and Special Envoys to the ICGLR, \r\nCanada is a strong supporter of the Lusaka Declaration \r\nendorsed by the ICGLR heads of State in December \r\n2010, emphasizing the current momentum in the fight \r\nagainst the illegal exploitation of natural resources. \r\n Canada’s contributions to the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo have totalled $350 million since \r\n2006, including for humanitarian and long-term \r\ndevelopment assistance, support to the United Nations \r\nOrganization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo and support for the 2011 \r\nelections. \r\n Finally, Canada remains greatly concerned by the \r\nhumanitarian crisis arising from the severe drought that \r\nis being felt throughout the Horn of Africa. So far in \r\n2011, Canada has contributed more than $72 million to \r\nhumanitarian agencies for emergency lifesaving \r\nassistance to those in need in the region. In addition, in \r\nJuly this year, Canada established the East Africa \r\nDrought Relief Fund, to which the Government of \r\nCanada pledged to contribute one dollar for every \r\ndollar an individual Canadian donated to a registered \r\nCanadian charity responding to the drought between \r\n6 July and 16 September 2011. The preliminary tally, \r\nas of October 4, is estimated to be just over \r\n$70 million, with total contribution amounts to be \r\nverified by mid-October. Once that is completed, the \r\nGovernment of Canada will contribute an equivalent \r\namount to the Fund.  \r\n Canada is concerned by the problems that \r\nconfront Somalia, including lawlessness, piracy and \r\nthe longstanding conflict, which have further \r\nexacerbated the effects of the drought. Canada has \r\nbeen actively involved in efforts to bring stability to \r\nSomalia, including a contribution of $1 million to the \r\nAfrican Union Mission in Somalia Trust Fund.  \r\n In closing, despite the many economic and social \r\ndevelopment challenges they face, African countries \r\nhave made great strides in recent years. Canada looks \r\nforward to continuing to work with our African \r\npartners and the international community towards \r\nrealizing Africa’s full potential. \r\n Mr. Sammis (United States of America): The \r\nUnited States would like to thank the Special \r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Sidi \r\nDiarra, and the Office of the Special Adviser on Africa, \r\nfor organizing the 7 October panel discussion on the \r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) \r\nand the Millennium Development Goals, and \r\nyesterday’s briefing in advance of today’s General \r\nAssembly consideration of those topics. \r\n NEPAD is an important African-owned and \r\nAfrican-led initiative for eradicating poverty and \r\nputting African economies on a path of sustainable \r\ngrowth. The United States fully supports the common \r\n A/66/PV.32\r\n \r\n27 11-53871 \r\n \r\nvision of African States for achieving the NEPAD goals \r\nand objectives, especially in the areas of agriculture, \r\ninfrastructure, education, health, the empowerment of \r\nwomen, and the environment. We also welcome the \r\nefforts of the United Nations, the African Union, the \r\nAfrican Development Bank, the African Peer Review \r\nMechanism (APRM) secretariat, African subregional \r\norganizations and international partners in assisting \r\nAfrican States to fully implement NEPAD. \r\n The United States welcomes the progress made in \r\nthe past year by the organizations and supporters of \r\nNEPAD in areas critical to economic growth and \r\nsustainable development highlighted in the report \r\n(A/66/202). We support Africa’s efforts to enhance its \r\neconomic growth and enjoy the benefits of integration \r\ninto the global economy. Alongside an enabling \r\nbusiness environment, progress in developing Africa’s \r\ninfrastructure is especially important to private-sector \r\neconomic growth and development. We commend the \r\nNEPAD Planning and Coordinating Agency for its \r\nefforts, alongside those of the African Union, the \r\nUnited Nations and the African Development Bank, to \r\ndrive and secure infrastructure gains across the \r\ncontinent. We encourage NEPAD to continue its review \r\nof infrastructure projects, and its work in line with its \r\nstrategic objectives. \r\n Food security remains an urgent challenge in \r\nAfrica. The United States is committed to \r\nstrengthening agricultural development in Africa, and \r\nhas committed $3.5 billion worldwide over three years \r\nthrough its global hunger and food security initiative, \r\nFeed the Future. The United States is encouraged by \r\nthe implementation of the Comprehensive Africa \r\nAgriculture Development Programme (CAADP) and \r\nNEPAD’s efforts to increase the number of countries \r\ncreating country compacts so as to meet their \r\nagricultural investment goals and target growth rates. \r\nOur Feed the Future initiative draws on CAADP \r\nprinciples and progress, both of which are essential to \r\nproviding security against famine and malnutrition. \r\n The crisis in the Horn of Africa is the most severe \r\nhumanitarian emergency in the world today. Tens of \r\nthousands, mostly children, have already died, and \r\n750,000 more Somalis are at risk of death in coming \r\nmonths, unless the international humanitarian \r\ncommunity can get access to those in need of critical \r\nassistance. NEPAD’s efforts serve to mitigate the \r\nimpact of the current crisis and provide insurance \r\nagainst such crises occurring in the future. \r\n While Africa is host to the largest number of \r\nleast-developed countries (LDCs), some African LDCs \r\nhave shown strong growth over the past decade. To \r\nensure that progress towards the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) is sustained, we must \r\nsupport well-governed African institutions that \r\npromote policies enabling economies to generate \r\nbroad-based, sustained economic growth and \r\nemployment. Such policies should include \r\naccountability, transparency, investment in an \r\nentrepreneur-friendly business climate, strengthened \r\nindigenous capacity for innovation, investment in \r\nwomen and girls, and attention to basic services, \r\nincluding health and education. \r\n With regard to meeting the MDGs in Africa by \r\n2015 and improving food security on the continent, the \r\nUnited States supports an improved, comprehensive \r\nmonitoring mechanism. Such a mechanism should \r\nbuild on existing processes and add value by \r\nleveraging the membership and contributions of the \r\nUnited Nations, as stated in the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral during the previous session of the General \r\nAssembly (A/65/152). Such a mechanism should be \r\npractical, effective and cost-neutral. It would require \r\nthe combined efforts of the United Nations system, the \r\nAfrican Development Bank, non-governmental \r\norganizations (NGOs) and other African institutions to \r\nensure comprehensive and authoritative results. \r\n The United States calls on the United Nations, the \r\nAfrican Union and NEPAD to work together to ensure \r\nthe creation of a results-driven process. The \r\nOrganization must ensure that the more than 25 United \r\nNations agencies working alongside the African Union \r\nand NEPAD are making efficient and effective use of \r\ntheir resources and are responding to the priorities of \r\nthe African Union and NEPAD. We expect that the \r\nOffice of the Special Adviser to the Secretary-General \r\non Africa, the Economic Commission for Africa and \r\nthe United Nations Office to the African Union will \r\nwork together to strengthen the regional coordination \r\nmechanism. It is also important that the African Peer \r\nReview Mechanism continue to function as envisioned. \r\nThe APRM has tremendous potential for advancing \r\ngood governance and socio-economic development in \r\nAfrica, and we actively encourage continuation of the \r\npeer review process over the coming year. \r\n Today the Assembly is also addressing the agenda \r\nitem on the Decade to Roll Back Malaria. The United \r\nStates is committed to addressing the prevention and \r\nA/66/PV.32  \r\n \r\n11-53871 28 \r\n \r\ntreatment of malaria in order to improve the health and \r\nwell-being of citizens living in malaria-endemic \r\nsettings, particularly young children and pregnant \r\nwomen, who are most affected by this devastating \r\ndisease. We further recognize the negative impact of \r\nmalaria on household incomes, economic and social \r\ndevelopment and political stability in affected \r\ncountries. \r\n Through its Global Health Initiative, the United \r\nStates will continue to lead in the fight against this and \r\nother diseases by focusing on strengthening health \r\nsystems and on broader health challenges, including \r\nchild and maternal health, family planning and \r\nneglected tropical diseases. We are pleased to be a \r\nleader in the support for malaria-control programmes \r\nthrough the President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI), and \r\nour contributions to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, \r\nTuberculosis and Malaria. Through the PMI, which is a \r\ncore component of the President’s Global Health \r\nInitiative, we have made a $5 billion, six-year \r\ncommitment. So far, we have spent $300 million in \r\n2009, $500 million in 2010 and $618 million in 2011. \r\nThese significant funding increases have allowed the \r\nPMI to expand, and it is now providing malaria \r\nprevention or treatment measures to more than \r\n50 million people in 19 focus countries in Africa. \r\n We work with host Governments, international \r\npartners, NGOs, the private sector and faith-based and \r\ncommunity groups to deliver indoor residual spraying, \r\ndistribute insecticide-treated bed nets, ensure \r\npreventive malaria treatment for expectant mothers, \r\nprovide prompt and accurate diagnosis and treatment \r\nof malarial illness, and build the capacity of national \r\nmalaria control programmes. The United States \r\ncontribution to the Global Fund supports in-country \r\ncapacity-building and strengthening of health systems, \r\nas well as direct service delivery. \r\n We encourage all donor and recipient nations to \r\nsupport global malaria control efforts through \r\nappropriate financial contributions and stronger \r\npolitical commitments. We urge affected nations, \r\nespecially those in Africa, to increase their own \r\ndomestic spending on malaria control as part of their \r\noverall plans to boost the share of their national \r\nbudgets devoted to health. \r\n Mr. Núñez Mosquera (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nOnly yesterday, 10 October, our island commemorated \r\na central event in the formation of the Cuban nation. \r\nWe celebrated the beginning, in 1868, of our first war \r\nof independence. That historic event was marked by \r\none of the most transcendental acts of justice in our \r\nhistory, when Carlos Manuel de Céspedes, known as \r\nthe father of the Cuban nation, freed his slaves. \r\n Independence and the African heritage are thus \r\nindissolubly linked to the Cuban national identity. \r\nOriginating in lands that today cover a large number of \r\nAfrican countries, there came to our island more than a \r\nmillion and a half enslaved Africans of various \r\nethnicities: Lucumi, Carabalí, Congolese, Ganga, \r\nMandingo, Mina, Bibi, Yoruba. That is why the people \r\nand Government of Cuba consider so important the \r\nGeneral Assembly’s declaration, through resolution \r\n64/169, of 2011 as the International Year for People of \r\nAfrican Descent. Many seminars and conferences have \r\nattested to the importance of this for Cuba. In \r\nSeptember, the Cuban people had the unique \r\nopportunity to celebrate two exceptional events: a \r\nmeeting of filmmakers from Africa, the Caribbean and \r\nthe diaspora, and the programming of the First Week of \r\nAfrican Cinema, held in Havana. I am sure that the \r\nworks from the African continent were shown in nearly \r\nall provinces of our country.  \r\n The Cuban people are the direct and natural heirs \r\nto Africa’s gallantry, fearlessness and culture of \r\nresistance. For centuries they have heroically fought \r\nagainst numerous challenges and threats, which endure \r\nto this day. The deepest internationalist convictions of \r\nthe Cuban Revolution have enabled our country to \r\nremain always on the side of the African peoples, from \r\nour unconditional support in the anti-colonial struggles \r\nto cooperation projects in many spheres of economic \r\nand social development. \r\n More than 381,000 Cuban fighters fought for \r\nalmost three decades to defend the integrity and \r\nsovereignty of our brother African nations, without \r\nasking for anything in exchange. They returned from \r\nAfrica with only the bodies of their fallen comrades \r\nand the honour of having done their duty. Today more \r\nthan 2,400 Cuban volunteers are serving in 35 African \r\nnations to promote their development in areas as \r\ndiverse as public health, education, agriculture, sports \r\nand construction, among others. \r\n Our country will continue to provide its human \r\ncapital and experience to help our African brothers and \r\nsisters. In just the Comprehensive Health Programme, \r\nclose to 1,120 Cuban doctors and technicians are \r\n A/66/PV.32\r\n \r\n29 11-53871 \r\n \r\nworking in 23 African countries, providing services to \r\nmore than 48 million people. \r\n In the context of international cooperation, Cuba \r\nhas various projects with a number of African countries \r\nto combat malaria. Cuba is collaborating in the \r\nproduction of vaccines, biological pest controls and \r\nbiofertilizers. It is developing important measures in \r\nthe plan to combat disease vectors, such as developing \r\nentomological maps for the early warning system in \r\nvarious African countries with which we maintain \r\ncooperation. Cuba is implementing programmes to \r\ndevelop biolarvicides in those countries, with advice \r\nfrom Cuban specialists.  \r\n More than 2,200 young people from 45 African \r\ncountries are currently enrolled in our universities and \r\npolytechnic institutes. To date, more than 32,000 young \r\npeople from that continent have graduated from Cuban \r\nschools with different specializations.  \r\n Cuba has always stood with Africa, and Africa \r\nhas always stood with Cuba. The history of our \r\nrelationship in the most diverse spheres is proof of \r\nthat. \r\n There is an intrinsic contradiction in the current \r\ninternational order. It is impossible to listen to certain \r\nbombastic speeches that attempt to tell us what our \r\npeoples should do, while they simultaneously force \r\nmany of our countries to spend five times more \r\nresources to pay back shameful external debt than we \r\nspend on health and education programmes. \r\n There must be an end to wars and military \r\ninterventions supported by interventionist doctrines \r\nthat violate international law and are intended \r\nprimarily to guarantee control of Africa’s mineral \r\nresources to the powerful multinationals of the \r\ndeveloped countries. Rich countries, instead of \r\ncontinuing to bomb African soil, should once and for \r\nall meet their modest commitments for official \r\ndevelopment aid. \r\n Moreover, it is high time to end the unjust system \r\nof patents and trade that is hindering the development \r\nof African nations. Cuba will continue to support the \r\nAfrican Union and all regional cooperation \r\nmechanisms as they pursue their own solutions to \r\nAfrican problems.  \r\n All Africa needs from the United Nations and the \r\ninternational community is a comprehensive focus on a \r\nsolution to problems that relate to the peace, security \r\nand development of the continent. We are not calling \r\nfor paternalism towards Africa, but rather equal \r\nopportunities as part of a fairer and more equitable \r\ninternational order.  \r\n The African people have the right to peace and \r\nsustainable development. That is what is needed for \r\nAfrica and the rest of the developing nations, so that, \r\nin a peaceful context, we can meet the challenges that \r\nour people face. Above all, Africa needs and deserves \r\nsolidarity and respect. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): In \r\naccordance with resolution 2011 (XX), adopted on \r\n11 October 1965, and decision 56/475 of 15 August \r\n2002, I now call on the observer for the African Union. \r\n Mr. Mayaki (African Union): Permit me first to \r\nextend my congratulations to Ambassador Nassir \r\nAbdulaziz Al-Nasser on his election as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. I also \r\ncongratulate the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, \r\non his reappointment. On behalf of the Agency of the \r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), I \r\nhope his 10 years will contribute to the promotion of \r\ncloser and more meaningful global cooperation and \r\nmove forward the implementation of the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development. \r\n I am most honoured to address this body on the \r\noccasion of the commemoration of the tenth \r\nanniversary of NEPAD. In July 2001, in Lusaka, \r\nAfrican leaders took a major step towards inspiring \r\nchange. It was a major milestone in Africa’s \r\ntransformation agenda.  \r\n As Africa’s strategic framework for development \r\nand the flagship programme of the African Union, \r\nNEPAD is the embodiment of Africa’s rebirth and \r\nrenaissance. For 10 years, African countries have \r\nimplemented comprehensive political and socio-economic \r\nreforms, driven at the continental level by the African \r\nUnion. This is to achieve the overarching objective of \r\nplacing Africa on the path of sustainable growth and \r\ndevelopment. \r\n Africa has demonstrated remarkable resilience. \r\nWe have nurtured and produced our own development \r\nagenda through the expression of NEPAD. We are \r\nresolved to achieve the full implementation of that \r\nagenda. Africa is taking full control and ownership of \r\nthat development agenda, driven by the shared values \r\nof ownership, leadership and partnership. This is based \r\nA/66/PV.32  \r\n \r\n11-53871 30 \r\n \r\non the African Union vision of an integrated, forward-\r\nlooking, prosperous, dynamic and peaceful Africa, \r\nrepresenting a dynamic force in the global arena.  \r\n Since the turn of the millennium, Africa has \r\nrecorded economic growth and made significant \r\nprogress in political governance and macroeconomic \r\nperformance. That growth, however, needs to be more \r\ninclusive. Indeed, Africans have been emboldened by \r\nthat progress, through the wind of change that has \r\ncontributed to shaping the new Africa. Under the \r\nplatform of the African Union, the continental renewal \r\nstrategy has purposefully addressed the development \r\nchallenges of the past and is looking ahead to a new \r\nAfrica. NEPAD has served as the catalyst for \r\ndevelopment. We have charted a new development \r\npathway that represents a departure from the old \r\ndevelopment model. The reality is that Africa has \r\nchanged, and is changing. \r\n NEPAD remains active in changing the \r\ndevelopment paradigm on the continent. NEPAD is \r\nnow fully integrated into the structures and processes \r\nof the African Union. The NEPAD Agency now serves \r\nas the technical body of the African Union. This \r\ninstitutionalization of NEPAD has given further \r\nimpetus to the implementation of the NEPAD agenda. \r\n The international community must therefore step \r\nup support for Africa’s needs and priorities. Over the \r\npast decade, Africa adopted continental policy \r\nframeworks to accelerate development and regional \r\nintegration. Through NEPAD, Africa is advancing good \r\ngovernance in all of its ramifications under the \r\numbrella of the African Peer Review Mechanism, \r\nwhich began in 2003. This unique voluntary instrument \r\nof peer exchanges and review at the highest political \r\nlevel among 30 participating African countries is \r\nleading the way on governance reforms. Other top \r\npriorities have been clearly defined, for example in the \r\nComprehensive Africa Agriculture Development \r\nProgramme and the Programme for Infrastructure \r\nDevelopment in Africa. NEPAD is spearheading \r\ninvestment plans in agriculture and food security. \r\n In the area of infrastructure, African leaders \r\nendorsed the African Union and NEPAD Presidential \r\nInfrastructure Champion Initiative to promote political \r\nsponsorship in driving the implementation of national \r\nand regional infrastructure. In addition, we support \r\nAfrican Governments in reinforcing development \r\nplanning as a formidable tool for ensuring the \r\nsustainability of the gains made over the past decade in \r\nAfrica. \r\n What remains to be done is for development \r\npartners to continue to work together, and within the \r\nUnited Nations, to support the implementation of \r\nAfrica’s priorities. We must renew our efforts to send a \r\npowerful and positive message to the rest of the world \r\nthat Africa is committed to its development agenda for \r\ntransformation. The African Union and its NEPAD \r\nprogramme are part of that equation. \r\n International partners remain fundamentally \r\nimportant to Africa. Promoting market access for \r\nAfrican products and diversification are critical to \r\nachieving sustainable and lasting economic growth. We \r\nmust work harder to change the current multilateral \r\ntrading system towards a more equitable and fair \r\nregime. Significantly, emerging economies in the South \r\nhave become increasingly strategic partners for Africa \r\nand have contributed to reducing its dependence on \r\ntraditional export markets. \r\n Specifically, trade negotiations under the Doha \r\nDevelopment Round should be accelerated and tailored \r\nmuch more to meet the special needs of Africa. Foreign \r\ndirect investment (FDI) is an important source of \r\ngrowth, and African countries have undertaken \r\nnumerous reforms to improve the investment climate. \r\nAs a result, FDI increased throughout the past decade, \r\npeaking at $72 billion in 2008. \r\n The international community should consider \r\npolicy measures to ensure that resource extraction is \r\nbeneficial to the host country so that resources are \r\ntransformed into productive assets and can contribute \r\nto long-term growth. That is the core message of the \r\nAfrica Mining Vision 2050. \r\n A critical factor in the changing development \r\nlandscape is the primacy of domestic resources for \r\nAfrica’s development. Although aid has been an \r\nimportant source of development financing in the past, \r\nAfrica is moving beyond aid to achieve self-sustaining, \r\nprivate sector-led growth. For instance, internally \r\ngenerated revenue in Africa grew significantly, from \r\n$129 billion in 2002 to $472 billion in 2008. Overall, \r\ndomestic revenue represented 84 per cent of total \r\nsources of financing for Africa in 2009. \r\n The imperative to move beyond aid will therefore \r\nlead to reducing dependency on aid, and thereby \r\nfacilitate the implementation of NEPAD’s vision of \r\n A/66/PV.32\r\n \r\n31 11-53871 \r\n \r\nsustainable growth and development and the \r\ncontinent’s desire to move towards development \r\neffectiveness. The ongoing transformation will benefit \r\ngreatly from this exit strategy on aid and redirect focus \r\nto the viability of FDI, public-private partnerships and \r\nraising domestic resources for development. \r\n Africa is the continent of the future. Over the past \r\ndecade, Africa’s development landscape has changed \r\nfor the better. A new story of steady transformation and \r\ngrowth is evolving on the continent. Africa is \r\nreaffirming its commitment to a global and balanced \r\npartnership with the rest of the world as the continent’s \r\nvision lends credence to the growth potential of \r\ndevelopment. This also reflects the NEPAD vision and \r\nits continued relevance and highlights the modest \r\nsuccesses in implementing NEPAD. \r\n We are reinforcing the need to effectively use \r\nboth internal and external resources so as to attain the \r\nmuch-desired development outcomes and impact. The \r\npartnership focus of NEPAD was a clarion call to the \r\nrest of Africa that our futures were inseparable and that \r\nour fate was a collective one. Across the continent, \r\nAfricans declared that they would no longer allow \r\nthemselves to be conditioned by circumstances. While \r\nthe frontiers of development are being redefined by \r\nnew opportunities, emerging actors and creative \r\nrelationships, Africa itself is embracing new \r\norientations and innovations. \r\n The continent is committed to serve as a \r\nfundamental contributor to global economic recovery \r\nand stability. We aspire to become a growth pole, and \r\nnot to be confined to perpetually managing poverty. \r\nDevelopment assistance should therefore be directed at \r\nAfrica’s real economy to enhance its present growth \r\npath, while ensuring the full involvement and \r\nparticipation of an empowered private sector and civil \r\nsociety. \r\n We call for the strengthening of partnership with \r\nthe international community represented here at the \r\nUnited Nations. We are especially appreciative of the \r\nsustained support of the Office of the Special Adviser \r\non Africa, the United Nations Economic Commission \r\nfor Africa, the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme and all United Nations agencies for the \r\nimplementation of the NEPAD agenda. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\nThis will help Africa to firmly secure its future. More \r\nthan ever before, Africans are optimistic about their \r\nbright prospects for growth and prosperity. The African \r\ncontinent is ready to play its role on the global stage so \r\nas to achieve its agenda of development effectiveness. \r\n \r\nProgramme of work \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I would \r\nlike to make an announcement concerning the \r\nconsideration of agenda item 114, sub-items (a), \r\n“Election of twenty members of the Committee for \r\nProgramme and Coordination”; (b), “Election of the \r\nmembers of the International Law Commission”; and \r\n(c), “Election of twenty-nine members of the \r\nGoverning Council of the United Nations Environment \r\nProgramme”, which had been scheduled for \r\nWednesday, 16 November. Those elections will now \r\ntake place on Thursday, 17 November, in the morning. \r\n In order to facilitate the election of members of \r\nthe International Law Commission, and in accordance \r\nwith the established practice, the General Assembly \r\nwill take an advance decision on the matter of \r\nrequesting the Secretariat to issue a consolidated list of \r\ncandidates reflecting all submissions and changes \r\nreceived so far. It is my intention to consult the \r\nAssembly in this regard on Monday morning, \r\n17 October 2011. \r\n  The meeting rose at 1.30 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
