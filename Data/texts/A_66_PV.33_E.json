During these past 10 years, \r\nmany crises, both natural and man-made, have \r\nhindered our collective efforts towards achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) in Africa. \r\nWhile Africa has shown great resilience and made \r\ntremendous progress, much more remains to be \r\nachieved. Allow me to reiterate here my country’s \r\ncontinued stance in remaining firm and in solidarity \r\nwith Africa in support of NEPAD’s goal of generating \r\nbroad-based and equitable economic growth conducive \r\nto poverty reduction in Africa and ensuring Africa’s \r\nenhanced integration within the global economy. \r\n Thailand wishes to commend the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his comprehensive reports on the agenda \r\nitems under consideration, entitled “New Partnership \r\nfor Africa’s Development: ninth consolidated progress \r\nreport on implementation and international support” \r\n(A/66/202) and “Implementation of the recommendations \r\ncontained in the report of the Secretary-General on the \r\ncauses of conflict and the promotion of durable peace \r\nand sustainable development in Africa” (A/66/214), as \r\nwell as his note entitled “2001-2010: Decade to Roll \r\nBack Malaria in Developing Countries, Particularly in \r\nAfrica” (A/66/169). Thailand welcomes in particular \r\nNEPAD’s concrete progress as reflected in the reports. \r\nPermit me now to share with members of the Assembly \r\nsome of Thailand’s views. \r\n First, we reaffirm our commitment to Africa and \r\nreiterate our aim to deepen relations with our African \r\nfriends as partners in development in all dimensions, \r\nbased on mutual trust. We also call for full \r\ninternational support for the implementation of the \r\nIstanbul Programme of Action, adopted in May at the \r\nA/66/PV.33  \r\n \r\n11-54043 2 \r\n \r\nFourth United Nations Conference on Least Developed \r\nCountries. \r\n Secondly, Thailand supports the implementation \r\nof policy actions on NEPAD’s sectoral priorities and \r\nstands ready to share our experiences in economic and \r\nsocial development with Africa. We are always \r\nprepared to explore meaningful ways to work together \r\nthrough both South-South and triangular cooperation, \r\nsuch as in the case of the cooperation among Thailand, \r\nJapan and Africa and that with the United Nations \r\nConference on Trade and Development through the \r\nInternational Institute for Trade and Development in \r\nBangkok. \r\n Thailand has long worked with our African \r\npartners to advance Africa’s development agenda. In \r\n2010, Thailand implemented 242 programmes for \r\nAfrica, amounting to $1.1 million, through bilateral, \r\ntrilateral and multilateral cooperation. Forty-five \r\nfellowships were extended to Africa last year, totalling \r\n$465,000, with an emphasis on human resources \r\ndevelopment and capacity-building. \r\n We have targeted key areas in which we have \r\nexperience and expertise, which we believe will have a \r\ngreat impact on the people. The first area is agriculture, \r\nto increase productivity and add value to agricultural \r\nproducts. Additional areas include public health, to \r\nbuild capacity in preventing and treating pandemics as \r\nwell as community health development; education with \r\nparticular emphasis on capacity-building at the grass-\r\nroots level in areas such as tourism and small and \r\nmedium enterprise development. \r\n It goes without saying that peace and security are \r\nnecessary for the success of any economic and social \r\ndevelopment efforts. We are therefore proud and \r\nprivileged that Thailand is able to contribute to peace \r\nand stability in Africa. At present, an 800-strong Thai \r\ninfantry battalion is serving alongside our African \r\nbrothers in the African Union-United Nations Hybrid \r\nOperation in Darfur. In addition, Thailand has sent two \r\ncounter-piracy task groups to join international efforts \r\nin patrolling the Gulf of Aden. \r\n Thirdly, as my Foreign Minister stated during this \r\nyear’s general debate (see A/66/PV.28), development \r\nmust be people-centred. Thailand therefore supports \r\nNEPAD’s founding document, which emphasizes the \r\nneed for partnership between African Governments and \r\ntheir people, as well as the Secretary-General’s \r\nrecommendations in his reports calling for \r\nstrengthening mechanisms for the participation, \r\ninclusion and empowerment of all segments of society \r\nin the political and development processes in order to \r\ntruly achieve sustainable and equitable development. \r\n Fourthly, climate change is a serious threat to \r\nfood security and sustainable development, especially \r\nfor least developed countries. We therefore call for \r\nearly and adequate funding of developing countries for \r\nadaptation and mitigation measures, as well as the \r\ntransfer of relevant technology. \r\n Lastly, concerning the fight against malaria, \r\nThailand was successful in reducing the number of its \r\nreported cases by more than 50 per cent between 2000 \r\nand 2009. In this regard, we will continue to move \r\nforward with preventive measures and aim to reduce \r\nthe number of malaria-risk areas in Thailand by a \r\nfurther 20 per cent by 2020. We have also joined with \r\nour neighbours in the Mekong subregion to collectively \r\nfight malaria. Moreover, Thailand is committed to \r\ncontinuing to share our experiences and best practices \r\nwith Africa in the fight against malaria through \r\ncapacity-building projects and annual training \r\nprogrammes, in order to achieve NEPAD’s goals and \r\nMDG targets. \r\n Finally, NEPAD has made much progress and has \r\ngained momentum. We must therefore find ways to \r\nensure that global and regional challenges and crises \r\ndo not nullify those gains. Collective solidarity will be \r\nneeded from within Africa, as well as on the part of the \r\ninternational community, to carry forward this \r\nmomentum and further support the implementation of \r\nthe priorities to which I have referred for a more \r\npeaceful and prosperous Africa. Thailand remains \r\ncommitted to this goal and to our African friends. \r\n Mrs. Dunlop (Brazil): Allow me, at the outset, to \r\nacknowledge the presence of Brazilian \r\nparliamentarians at this meeting of the General \r\nAssembly. They have come a long way from various \r\nregions of Brazil to lend their support to our work. In \r\nparticular, I would like to thank Senator Petecão from \r\nAcre, Deputy Leréia, President of the External \r\nRelations Committee of the Chamber of Deputies of \r\nthe Brazilian Congress, and Deputy Geraldo Resende \r\nfrom Mato Grosso do Sul, for being here with us this \r\nafternoon. \r\n I would like to thank the President for convening \r\nthis joint debate on the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) and on the Decade to Roll \r\n A/66/PV.33\r\n \r\n3 11-54043 \r\n \r\nBack Malaria in Developing Countries. This plenary \r\nmeeting is an important opportunity for us to reaffirm \r\nour support for two initiatives that are central to the \r\nachievement of the internationally agreed development \r\ngoals in Africa, including the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. \r\n As we celebrate the tenth anniversary of NEPAD, \r\nit is becoming clear that Africa is undergoing a \r\nprofound economic, social and political transformation. \r\nOver the past decade, Africa achieved rates of \r\neconomic growth significantly above the world \r\naverage. In fact, six of the 10 fastest-growing countries \r\nin the world are on the African continent. Between \r\n2000 and 2010, sub-Saharan Africa grew 5.7 per cent \r\nannually, on average, compared to 2.4 per cent during \r\nthe two previous decades. \r\n Economic growth has been accompanied by the \r\nexpansion of domestic markets, increasing \r\nurbanization, and investment in social and human \r\ncapital and infrastructure. The growing diversification \r\nand resilience of African economies was decisive in \r\ntheir rapid recovery from the financial and economic \r\ncrisis in 2008. Yet many challenges still remain. The \r\nworld economy once again faces renewed uncertainty, \r\nand many African countries depend largely on basic \r\ncommodities for their economic well-being. \r\n Brazil remains fully committed to Africa’s \r\neconomic, social and political development. Based on \r\nthe principles of national ownership and leadership, \r\nNEPAD can count on our full and enthusiastic support \r\nfor the effective framework it offers for cooperation \r\nand development, rooted in African perspectives and \r\nAfrican priorities. \r\n Over the past 10 years, Brazil has been \r\nincreasingly engaged with Africa. Culminating in 2011 \r\nwith its recognition of the new State of South Sudan, \r\nBrazil has now established diplomatic relations with all \r\n54 countries of Africa. In recognition of our growing \r\npartnership with Africa, we have also greatly expanded \r\nour diplomatic network on the continent, opening \r\n19 embassies in the past 10 years, for a total of \r\n37 missions today. In that context, the Brazilian \r\nparliamentarians who are here today have been of great \r\nhelp and understanding in enabling us to reach this \r\nlevel of representation. \r\n The Africa-South America Summit process has \r\nalso played a crucial role in fostering closer dialogue \r\nand understanding between our regions and peoples. \r\nBilateral economic ties between Brazil and Africa have \r\nalso prospered. In particular, trade between Brazil and \r\nAfrica increased significantly over the past decade, \r\nfrom approximately $4.2 billion in 2000 to more than \r\n$20 billion in 2010. We have also expanded investment \r\nin several countries on the continent, particularly in the \r\nconstruction, mining, energy and transportation \r\nsectors. Brazil looks forward to increasing its air and \r\nsea connections to Africa, with a view to establishing \r\nthe transportation links necessary for supporting a \r\ndiversified trade and investment relationship. \r\n Brazil fully supports the sectoral priorities \r\nestablished by NEPAD. In recognition of the priority \r\nrole of agricultural and rural development for food \r\nsecurity and poverty eradication, we have sought to \r\nwork with African partner countries to develop joint \r\ninitiatives in this area. Since 2002, Brazil has \r\nconcluded more than 50 cooperation agreements in the \r\narea of agriculture with 18 African countries, including \r\nAlgeria, Angola, Cape Verde, Cameroon, Ghana, \r\nGuinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Sao Tome and Principe, \r\nSenegal, Tanzania and Tunisia. In 2010, we were \r\npleased to host 45 African countries at the first Brazil-\r\nAfrica Dialogue on Food Security, the Fight Against \r\nHunger, and Rural Development. \r\n The Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation — \r\nthe State company Embrapa — has opened an office in \r\nGhana, with a view to supporting the technological and \r\nproductive improvement of savanna agriculture in \r\nAfrica. The office has a comprehensive collection of \r\nplant and animal varieties, as well as key data and \r\nknow-how, adapted to tropical agriculture. It has \r\nprovided assistance to over 30 countries in the region. \r\nAs a rule, the cooperation projects aim to transfer \r\nskills, build local capacity and empower local workers, \r\nwith the full engagement and ownership of African \r\nGovernments. \r\n As a country afflicted by malaria, Brazil is \r\ncommitted to working with the international \r\ncommunity and other developing countries, especially \r\nAfrican countries, to rid the world of that disease. \r\n At the bilateral level, we have developed joint \r\nprogrammes for the prevention and control of malaria \r\nwith a number of African countries so as to strengthen \r\nnational health systems, particularly with regard to \r\nmonitoring and epidemiology. We have also \r\nimplemented initiatives in training and capacity-\r\nbuilding in order to prevent and control the disease.  \r\nA/66/PV.33  \r\n \r\n11-54043 4 \r\n \r\n At the multilateral level, we participate in the \r\nRoll Back Malaria Partnership, the International Drug \r\nPurchase Facility and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, \r\nTuberculosis and Malaria, among others efforts. Based \r\non our national experience, we believe that it is \r\npossible to reduce the number of cases by expanding \r\nhealth-care services and integrating control and care \r\nactivities. \r\n The international community has made \r\nsignificant progress in the past decade in the pursuit of \r\nthe goals to achieve universal coverage of malaria \r\nprevention and treatment by 2010 and to reduce global \r\nmalaria deaths to near zero preventable deaths by 2015. \r\nAt this stage, it is clear that it may be difficult to \r\nachieve the agreed goals unless donors fully meet their \r\ndevelopment assistance commitments, particularly with \r\nregard to the Gleneagles targets for doubling aid for \r\nAfrica. \r\n In addition to traditional prevention strategies, \r\nsuch as the use of insecticide-treated nets and indoor \r\nresidual spraying, national Governments should be able \r\nto count on the support of the international community \r\nto implement mechanisms to ensure universal access to \r\nfree or affordable medicines for the treatment of \r\nmalaria for those who are already affected, making full \r\nuse of the flexibilities in the Trade-Related Aspects of \r\nIntellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement, in \r\naccordance with the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS \r\nAgreement and Public Health. \r\n The Brazilian Government remains fully \r\ncommitted to further strengthening the prevention and \r\ncontrol of malaria in order to maintain a sustained \r\nreduction of cases of infection, especially in the most \r\nvulnerable areas of the Amazon region. To that end, we \r\nhave launched our national programme for malaria \r\ncontrol, which aims to reduce by 50 per cent the \r\nnumber of cases of malaria in the municipalities \r\nresponsible for the majority of the infections registered \r\nin Brazil. \r\n Mr. Laseinde (Nigeria): My delegation wishes to \r\nexpress its appreciation to the Secretary-General for \r\nhis reports contained in documents A/66/202 and \r\nA/66/214, as well as for the organization of this debate. \r\n Nigeria associates itself with the statement made \r\nat the 32nd plenary meeting by the representative of \r\nKenya on behalf of the African Group. \r\n The role that the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD), supported by the United \r\nNations and the international community, in \r\ntransforming and improving the well-being of the \r\ncitizens on the continent of Africa, particularly in the \r\nareas of democratic governance, domestic resource \r\nmobilization, improved economic growth, poverty \r\neradication, the promotion of sustainable growth and \r\nthe empowerment of women though building \r\npartnerships at the country, regional and global levels, \r\ncan never be overemphasized. In that regard, my \r\ndelegation congratulates NEPAD on its tenth \r\nanniversary, which was marked here at the United \r\nNations last Friday.  \r\n The anniversary is worth celebrating in view of \r\nthe strong economic growth and improvement in \r\nsocio-economic indicators that have been experienced \r\nduring the period under review. Sub-Saharan Africa is \r\none of the few regions of the world to show great \r\nresilience in the face of the global economic crisis.  \r\n While recovering from the impact of the global \r\neconomic crisis that affected the international financial \r\nmarkets in 2008, many developing countries, including \r\nthose in Africa, have embarked on macroeconomic \r\nreform programmes capable of transforming their \r\neconomies and strengthening their financial \r\ninstitutions. Those efforts have led to lower rates of \r\ninflation and strong gross domestic product (GDP) \r\ngrowth.  \r\n In addition, the African Peer Review Mechanism \r\n(APRM) is progressing gradually. So far, 30 States \r\nmembers of the African Union have acceded to the \r\nAPRM; 14 countries have completed the first review \r\nprocess, and are being peer reviewed by the APRM \r\nForum; while two countries have also received country \r\npeer-review missions and are slated for peer review in \r\nJanuary 2012. \r\n The APRM process has created awareness among \r\nStates, especially in the understanding of the nexus \r\nbetween peace and development. There has \r\nconsequently been a significant reduction of political \r\ntension and violence within and between African \r\nStates. The internationally acclaimed free and fair \r\nelections in Nigeria, the successful referendum in the \r\nSudan, the adoption of a new Constitution in Kenya \r\nand the transitions in Guinea and Niger are changing \r\nthe political space in Africa for the better. \r\n A/66/PV.33\r\n \r\n5 11-54043 \r\n \r\n Nigeria’s current economic policies are focused \r\non addressing key infrastructural shortcomings as a \r\ncrucial element in setting the stage for long-term stable \r\ngrowth in an effort to break the past 30 years of \r\nuncontrollable boom-and-bust cycles. Our GDP grew \r\nfrom 7.0 per cent in 2009 to an estimated 8.1 per cent \r\nin 2010. The robust growth in 2010, in the aftermath of \r\nthe global financial and economic crisis, underscores \r\nthe resilience of the Nigerian economy. Medium-term \r\nprospects are also bright, with real GDP growth \r\nprojected to remain strong and stable at 6.9 per cent in \r\n2011 and 6.7 per cent in 2012.  \r\n Medium- to long-term prospects will require \r\naddressing key reforms in order to advance \r\ninfrastructure development and to broaden the \r\neconomic base through enhanced private-sector \r\nparticipation. The Nigerian Government is therefore \r\npursuing a transformation agenda as a strategic policy \r\nthrust to address the developmental needs and the \r\nchallenges of the future. Indeed, there is a renewed \r\nsense of optimism and belief in our ability to create a \r\nnew Nigeria on the principles of personal freedom, \r\ndemocracy, good governance and the rule of law. \r\n In spite of the progress in the political and \r\neconomic sectors on the African continent, there are \r\nstill challenges in the areas of armed conflict, fragility \r\nand erosion of the rule of law and chronic poverty, with \r\nsevere implications for women and children. Similarly, \r\nreports of human rights violations, terrorist attacks, \r\ntrafficking in small arms and light weapons, the \r\nscourge of piracy and unresolved electoral issues \r\nabound. The time has come for the United Nations and \r\nthe international community to focus attention on the \r\nroot causes of those conflicts and proffer enduring \r\nsolutions. \r\n My delegation believes that cultivating peace and \r\nfulfilling the aims of Chapter VI of the United Nations \r\nCharter require the early identification of, and \r\nappropriate intervention in, conflict situations, in order \r\nto build confidence and trust and preclude the eruption \r\nof violence between opposing parties. Our goal should \r\nalways be to present the peaceful alternative as a less \r\ncostly and more effective way of achieving political \r\nand social objectives. \r\n In addition to other traditional tools of preventive \r\ndiplomacy, democracy and good governance can be \r\nparticularly important in building a just, equitable and \r\ninclusive society. By focusing on mediation as a tool \r\nfor conflict prevention, we are able to address the real \r\ntriggers of conflict. Otherwise we cannot achieve \r\nsustainable solutions.  \r\n The African Union has sufficiently demonstrated \r\nthe political will for peaceful resolution of the \r\ncontinent’s problems. It has served as a veritable \r\nplatform to articulate the continent’s agenda. The \r\nUnited Nations, and the Security Council in particular, \r\nhas been a worthy partner of Africa, especially in \r\nconflict resolution, peacekeeping, post-conflict \r\npeacebuilding and even economic reconstruction. The \r\nAfrican Union’s efforts have proved that regional \r\norganizations are uniquely placed to tackle threats to \r\nregional peace and security.  \r\n However, in view of recent challenges, there is a \r\nneed to further strengthen and consolidate \r\ncollaboration and partnership in the areas of peace and \r\ndevelopment between the secretariats of the United \r\nNations Security Council and the African Union Peace \r\nand Security Council. That partnership should continue \r\nto be based on mutual trust and respect, on the basis of \r\nmutual support and shared responsibility and \r\ncommitment. It should aim to address the main \r\nconstraints on Africa’s economic growth and \r\ndevelopment. It is further hoped that, with increased \r\nconsultations between the two bodies, they will be able \r\nto develop a robust regional structure for peace and \r\nsecurity. \r\n Nigeria therefore calls for support for the African \r\nUnion architecture and its full operationalization, \r\nincluding the implementation of the Framework for the \r\nTen-Year Capacity-Building Programme for the \r\nAfrican Union. In addition, there is a need for a robust \r\nspecial fund for the African Union, which will ensure \r\nsustainable, flexible and predictable funding for \r\npeacekeeping operations in Africa. It will also enable \r\nthe continent to overcome the perennial problem of \r\nsustaining peacekeeping operations, which are marked \r\nby a lack of political will, insufficient funding, lack of \r\nmilitary hardware, infrastructure and logistics and \r\ndelay in deployment. \r\n My delegation holds the view that the envisaged \r\nrelationship should be strengthened to support actions \r\nto foster the pacific settlement of disputes. We must, \r\nhowever, also focus on institutional capacity-building \r\nand adequate resource mobilization for sustainable \r\ndevelopment. We believe that conflict-prevention \r\nmeasures and peacebuilding mechanisms are \r\nA/66/PV.33  \r\n \r\n11-54043 6 \r\n \r\nfundamental to the resolution of conflict on the African \r\ncontinent. \r\n The challenges on the continent remain \r\nformidable. Whereas we have made considerable \r\nprogress in the fight against HIV and AIDS, malaria \r\nand non-communicable diseases are on the increase. In \r\nspite of the political momentum generated at the \r\nAfrican Summit on Roll Back Malaria, held in Abuja in \r\nApril 2000, malaria continues to kill millions of \r\nchildren. It is regrettable that, in spite of the enormous \r\nhuman, financial and material resources deployed by \r\nGovernments and non-governmental organizations over \r\nthe past 10 years, a child still dies every 30 seconds \r\nfrom malaria in Africa.  \r\n In Nigeria more than 90 per cent of the \r\npopulation is still at risk of the disease. More than \r\n52 per cent of them are children. The eradication of \r\nmalaria should be a top priority on the international \r\nagenda. We recognize and commend the contribution \r\nof the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and \r\nMalaria and other bilateral donors, charitable \r\norganizations and foundations in the fight against \r\nmalaria. But a lot more needs to be done if the goal of \r\nhalving deaths from malaria is to be achieved in the \r\nnear future.  \r\n I assure the Assembly that we in Africa are not \r\nresting on our horse and that we are marshalling \r\nsustainable development strategies at the national, \r\nsubregional and regional levels in order to take \r\nresponsibility for our own development within the \r\nconfines of available resources. Democracy, the rule of \r\nlaw, good governance, transparency and accountability, \r\nrespect for human rights, peer review mechanisms and \r\npeaceful, democratic means of changing Governments \r\nare taking firm root in Africa.  \r\n Of course, we have challenges of an endogenous \r\nnature as well, such as climate change, an unfavourable \r\ninternational trade system and endemic diseases, such \r\nas HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, which impede \r\nour development efforts. To address those problems \r\nholistically, we need the collaboration and commitment \r\nof our development partners, as well as the support of \r\nthe United Nations and the international community.  \r\n Nigeria stands ready to share its experience with \r\nother developing countries where such is needed. We \r\nhave strong faith that despite the challenges that face \r\nus in Africa as a result of the global economic crisis, \r\nthis body will continue to address them until a secure \r\nand more sustainable and just global economic order is \r\nachieved. \r\n Mr. Balé (Congo) (spoke in French): My \r\ndelegation is taking the floor under sub-item (a) of \r\nagenda item 63, entitled “New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment: progress in implementation and \r\ninternational support”.  \r\n Africa has seen many initiatives and proposed \r\ndevelopment solutions that never came to fruition. \r\nAfter numerous setbacks and disappointed hopes, \r\nAfrican heads of State and Government, stirred by a \r\ncommon vision of the continent’s development, in \r\n2001 adopted the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD). In doing so, they took upon \r\nthemselves the challenges of regional integration, \r\naccelerated growth, sustainable development, the \r\neradication of poverty and the integration of Africa in \r\nthe globalization process.  \r\n Following a decade marked by a bold awareness-\r\nraising campaign, aimed especially at Africans taking \r\nownership of it and to finally spur it into action, it \r\nseems to us that the time is right, at this symbolic tenth \r\nanniversary, to take a critical look back at the process \r\nof its launching, assess the road travelled and plot the \r\nmajor courses of action remaining to be taken to \r\naccelerate its realization. \r\n In terms of strengthening institutions, my \r\ndelegation is pleased to highlight the efforts undertaken \r\nby the secretariat of the African Peer Review \r\nMechanism (APRM) in the process of States’ \r\nownership of the new rules on self-assessment for good \r\ngovernance, based on the concepts of democracy and \r\npolitical governance; economic governance and \r\nmanagement; corporate governance and socio-economic \r\ndevelopment.  \r\n Liberia’s signing of a memorandum of \r\nunderstanding at the end of the fourteenth forum of the \r\nheads of State and Government of the APRM, held in \r\nAddis Ababa on 29 January, expanded its membership \r\nto 30 African States, all resolutely committed to the \r\npath of good governance. \r\n Early on, Congo gauged the importance of \r\ngovernance for its development. That is why my \r\ncountry was among the very first States to join that \r\nself-assessment and evaluation process as soon as it \r\nwas launched in 2003. \r\n A/66/PV.33\r\n \r\n7 11-54043 \r\n \r\n At a time when uncertainty looms over the \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs) by many African countries’ by 2015, Congo \r\nwelcomes the involvement of NEPAD in efforts to \r\nachieve the MDGs in Africa as stressed by the \r\nSecretary-General’s 2011 report assessing the progress \r\nmade by Africa in attaining the MDGs. That is clearly \r\nan indication of strong political will among our heads \r\nof State and Government. This is also a case for their \r\nunwavering commitment to work to accelerate the \r\nimplementation of NEPAD, especially in priority areas. \r\n Such a commitment of course requires support \r\nfrom the international community. Congo continues to \r\nhonour its commitment to the implementation of \r\nNEPAD. From 13 to 15 September in Brazzaville, we \r\norganized a workshop on information and raising \r\npublic awareness about NEPAD programmes and \r\nprojects, with special emphasis on progress in priority \r\ninfrastructure projects in the context of regional and \r\nsubregional integration. \r\n For African countries, those infrastructure \r\nprojects comprise the cornerstone of socio-economic \r\ndevelopment. Among such infrastructure projects, \r\nwhich are tasked with linking together the countries of \r\nthe subregion — Congo with Cameroon, Congo with \r\nGabon and Congo with the Central African Republic — \r\nI would especially like to highlight the hallmark \r\nsubregional integration project to establish a road-rail \r\nbridge over the Congo River to link Brazzaville and \r\nKinshasa. \r\n A study is to be carried out on the road-rail bridge \r\nproject over the Congo River and the extension of the \r\nKinshasa-Hebo railway. Congo and the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo have secured a $7.95 million \r\ngrant from the African Development Bank to fund the \r\nstudy. The Economic and Monetary Community of \r\nCentral Africa, which was designated as the \r\nimplementing authority, will be supported in those \r\nefforts by a joint technical committee comprised of \r\nexperts from both countries and from ECCAS. The cost \r\nof the study totals approximately €6,615,200.  \r\n As members of the Assembly are aware, energy \r\nplays a decisive role in any development process. \r\nEnergy infrastructure is ultimately one of the key \r\ndrivers of integration and economic growth on our \r\ncontinent. In that regard, Central Africa has substantial \r\nhydropower potential, which will foster cross-border \r\nelectricity interlinkages based on a master plan on \r\nsubregional energy, on which a study is already \r\navailable. \r\n The implementation of these cornerstone projects \r\nin Central Africa will convey the shared will of the \r\nGovernments of the countries of the subregion to \r\ntransform NEPAD into a dynamic mechanism for \r\nintegration and development. The strategic framework, \r\nwhose aim is to address the crucial problems \r\nhampering the continent’s development, has enabled \r\nAfrican countries to record encouraging progress in \r\nkey areas such as peace and security, sustainable \r\ndevelopment, new information and telecommunication \r\ntechnologies, health, education and, in particular, \r\nagriculture, which is considered the most important \r\nsubsector in order to ensure accelerated economic \r\ngrowth in the region through a detailed programme on \r\nagricultural development in Africa. \r\n It is clear that even greater efforts must be made, \r\nespecially through capacity-building for regional \r\neconomic communities, improving communication \r\nbetween NEPAD and regional economic communities, \r\nresource-mobilization, increased private sector \r\ninvestment and knowledge and the efficient use of \r\nsupport sources, including ownership of NEPAD by \r\npopulations. With that in mind, Congo has set up a \r\nnational coordinating structure for NEPAD that is \r\ntasked with tracking the implementation of NEPAD \r\nprojects and programmes nationally to ensure that \r\nthose are firmly rooted in the daily concerns of the \r\nGovernment. \r\n The tenth anniversary of NEPAD must serve to \r\nensure African leadership of NEPAD’s implementation. \r\nHowever, we must acknowledge that prior years have \r\nbeen witness to African countries’ pledging resolutely \r\nto implement NEPAD. But they have also experienced \r\nfrustration of their efforts due to successive crises and \r\nweak partnerships that have not always fulfilled their \r\npromises. \r\n The tenth anniversary should also serve as an \r\nopportunity to again recall the commitment of African \r\ncountries to take in hand their destinies collectively \r\nand individually, and to prompt their respective \r\nGovernments to further step up their efforts. At the \r\nsame time, we are duty-bound to recall that NEPAD is \r\nalso the new partnership that Africa has sealed for the \r\nrest of the world. The successful culmination of our \r\nefforts will depend, to a large extent, on a more \r\ndynamic and more sincere partnership, with a view to \r\nA/66/PV.33  \r\n \r\n11-54043 8 \r\n \r\nremoving the hurdles and expediting progress towards \r\nattainment of NEPAD’s objectives. \r\n Mr. Imakando (Zambia): The Zambian \r\ndelegation has the honour to address the General \r\nAssembly on the subject of the 2001-2010 Decade to \r\nRoll Back Malaria in Developing Countries, \r\nParticularly in Africa. Zambia notes with appreciation \r\nthe report of the World Health Organization in that \r\nregard (see A/66/169), which my delegation found \r\nuseful. \r\n My delegation also aligns itself with the \r\nstatement delivered this morning by the representative \r\nof Kenya on behalf of the African Group. \r\n As the immediate past-Chair of the Roll Back \r\nMalaria Partnership Board, we wish to reiterate that \r\nmalaria remains a major public health challenge in \r\nmany African countries, especially among children \r\nunder the age of five years, pregnant women and \r\nvulnerable members of society. \r\n In 2007, Zambia recorded 4.3 million cases of \r\nmalaria, with over 6,000 deaths attributed to the \r\ndisease. In addition to its direct health impact, such a \r\nhigh incidence of malaria causes a severe social and \r\neconomic burden on individuals and households, and \r\nindeed on communities at large. The Zambian \r\nGovernment has therefore prioritized malaria in its \r\nsixth national development plan, which covers the \r\nperiod 2011 to 2015, in line with the Abuja Declaration \r\nto Roll Back Malaria in Africa and the Roll Back \r\nMalaria targets.  \r\n Some of the measures that Zambia has put in \r\nplace to combat this scourge include eliminating, \r\nthrough an act of Parliament, taxation on malaria \r\ncontrol tools, including mosquito nets and relevant \r\ninsecticides; banning monotherapy treatments using \r\nchloroquine and promoting artemisinin-based \r\ncombination therapies; increasing the range of indoor \r\nresidual spraying from five districts in 2003 to \r\n54 districts in 2010, covering over 1 million \r\nhouseholds; and scaling up the provision, from 2007 to \r\n2010, of insecticide-treated nets to over 6 million \r\npeople. \r\n We are also providing intermittent presumptive \r\ntreatment to all pregnant women as a way of \r\npreventing malaria during pregnancy; training health-\r\ncare personnel in the proper diagnosis and treatment of \r\nmalaria, using rapid diagnostic tests and artemisinin-\r\nbased combination therapies; and strengthening \r\ncommunity-based interventions through capacity-\r\nbuilding for malaria case management. \r\n As a result of those high-impact interventions \r\nthat the Zambian Government, in collaboration with \r\ninternational cooperating partners, has put in place, \r\nmalaria deaths were reduced by 60 per cent during the \r\nDecade to Roll Back Malaria.  \r\n However, despite the various interventions to \r\nprevent malaria, a number of challenges still remain. \r\nThose include the erratic disbursement of committed \r\nfunds by some cooperating partners, lengthy \r\nprocedures in the disbursement of funds, and \r\ninadequate human resources, among others. \r\n In concluding my remarks, I wish to take this \r\nopportunity to call upon the international community to \r\ncontinue to extend assistance to Zambia in the fight \r\nagainst malaria. \r\n Mr. Swe (Myanmar): At the outset, I wish to \r\ncongratulate the President on his assumption of the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth \r\nsession. We pledge our full support and cooperation to \r\nhim in ensuring a fruitful conclusion to the session. \r\n Myanmar associates itself with the statement \r\nmade this morning by our colleague from the Republic \r\nof Indonesia on behalf of the Association of Southeast \r\nAsian Nations (ASEAN). \r\n My delegation also wishes to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his insightful and comprehensive reports \r\n(A/66/202 and A/66/214) on agenda item 63. \r\n Today, Africa faces both great opportunities and \r\ngrave challenges in its pursuit of peace and \r\ndevelopment. To tackle the challenges faced by Africa, \r\nwe are of the view that the New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD) can be an important \r\ntool to address poverty and underdevelopment \r\nthroughout the African continent, as well as a \r\ncollective vision and a strategic socio-economic \r\ndevelopment framework for Africa. Since the \r\nlaunching of NEPAD, 10 years ago, African countries \r\nhave achieved great progress in such areas as \r\ninfrastructure, agriculture, health, education, the \r\nenvironment, tourism, science and technology and \r\ninformation and telecommunications technologies, with \r\nthe vigorous support of the international community. \r\n A/66/PV.33\r\n \r\n9 11-54043 \r\n \r\n Africa has rebounded from the global economic \r\nand financial crisis despite the slowdown in the pace of \r\nthe global economic recovery. We are happy to note \r\nthat average economic growth in Africa between 2002 \r\nto 2010 was an impressive 5.5 per cent. However, \r\nAfrica, like no other continent, remains heavily \r\naffected by the challenges of climate change and food \r\nsecurity. We also know that Africa still lags behind \r\nother regions with regard to progress in achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), in particular \r\nthose related to child and maternal mortality and access \r\nto adequate sanitation and safe drinking water. \r\n In that regard, we share the view that the \r\ninternational community should increase its support for \r\nAfrica and help it attain greater progress in the \r\nimplementation of NEPAD. In order to promote \r\nstability and prosperity in Africa, the international \r\ncommunity should deliver the assistance it has \r\ncommitted to provide, in time and with respect for the \r\nright of self-determination of African countries. \r\nMoreover, they should build new and broad \r\npartnerships, expand South-South cooperation, \r\nstrengthen the role of international bodies and mobilize \r\ninnovative financing. \r\n Myanmar and Africa have a deep-rooted \r\ntraditional relationship and friendship. As one of the \r\norganizers of the historic Asia-Africa Bandung \r\nConference, Myanmar has always been committed to \r\nthe cause of peace and development on the continent, \r\nas well as a strong supporter of decolonization efforts \r\non the part of African countries. \r\n As a member of ASEAN, Myanmar confirms its \r\ncommitment to continue building synergies and \r\nfriendship with Africa under the framework of \r\nASEAN — not only through the New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development but also the New Asian-African \r\nStrategic Partnership. Myanmar also recognizes the \r\nComprehensive Africa Agriculture Development \r\nProgramme and the Africa Peer Review Mechanism, \r\ntwo of NEPAD’s innovative initiatives aimed at \r\npromoting good governance and creating the \r\nconditions for broad-based economic growth. \r\n In addition, Myanmar firmly believes that the \r\nPeace Building Commission can assist African \r\ncountries emerging from conflict in moving forward to \r\npeacebuilding efforts by encouraging and supporting \r\nhome-based programmes, including on youth \r\nemployment, vocational training and education, in \r\norder to achieve stability and security in Africa. \r\n It is our firm conviction that the efforts of the \r\npeople of Africa for economic revitalization and social \r\nprogress should be given stronger support from the \r\nUnited Nations, development partners and the \r\ninternational community through strengthening their \r\nwork and priorities on assisting African countries. \r\nMyanmar wishes to reiterate its solidarity with African \r\ncountries in calling for the international community to \r\nenhance its contribution to the cause of peace and \r\ndevelopment in Africa. \r\n Mr. Sul Kyung-hoon (Republic of Korea): \r\nAfrica’s development is the key to promoting global \r\npeace and prosperity on a sustainable basis. Embracing \r\nAfrica in the process of political, economic and social \r\ndevelopment will therefore be a core challenge for the \r\ninternational community as a whole. \r\n In that regard, the Republic of Korea welcomes \r\nthe Secretary-General’s report entitled “New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development: ninth \r\nconsolidated progress report on implementation and \r\ninternational support” (A/66/202). We are very much \r\nencouraged by the report’s assessment that Africa has \r\nmade noticeable progress towards achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). However, \r\nthe report also indicates that performance across \r\ncountries and across MDG targets still remains uneven. \r\nIt is crucial, therefore, that the international community \r\nreinvigorate its effort for all MDGs to be achieved by \r\n2015 by broadening partnerships with development \r\npartners. \r\n In that respect, we believe that this year’s tenth \r\nanniversary of the adoption of the flagship programme \r\nof the African Union will carry particular significance. \r\nWhile warmly welcoming that occasion, my delegation \r\nwishes to reiterate that the Korean Government is \r\nready to work closely with our partners in the region in \r\nstrengthening our development cooperation. \r\n As a part of our own efforts, the Republic of \r\nKorea organized the second Korea-Africa Forum in \r\n2009, where we announced our commitment to double \r\nour official development assistance to Africa by 2012, \r\ncompared with the 2008 figures. At the Forum, the \r\nRepublic of Korea also reaffirmed its commitment to \r\nenhancing its partnership with Africa in such diverse \r\nfields as green growth, climate change, food security, \r\ngovernance and capacity-building based on Korea’s \r\nA/66/PV.33  \r\n \r\n11-54043 10 \r\n \r\ndevelopment experience. More recently, the Korean \r\nGovernment decided to provide $5.4 million in \r\nhumanitarian assistance to countries in the Horn of \r\nAfrica, which are suffering from severe drought and a \r\ndire food crisis. An additional $10 million in assistance \r\nwill follow to help to strengthen development capacity \r\nin that region. \r\n Next year, we will host the third round of the \r\nKorea-Africa Forum where we will assess the progress \r\nmade in our efforts and commitments. We sincerely \r\nhope that this continuous partnership will complement \r\nthe progress made on the occasion of the tenth \r\nanniversary of the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment. We are confident that, through this close \r\ncooperation, we can realign ourselves with Africa’s \r\ndevelopment needs and priorities. \r\n In order to obtain more development results from \r\nour development cooperation with Africa, we believe \r\nthat partnerships should not be limited to such \r\ntraditional players as donor countries, recipient \r\ncountries and international organizations. Instead, \r\nfurther efforts are needed to engage, in our pursuit of \r\nAfrican development, more diverse development \r\npartners, including emerging donors, civil society, \r\nprivate foundations and business sectors. \r\n In that regard, my delegation wishes to draw \r\nattention to the upcoming fourth High-level Forum on \r\nAid Effectiveness, to be held in November in Busan. \r\nThe Busan Forum is expected to provide an excellent \r\nplatform to address this issue. My country will make \r\nan extra effort to seek to build more inclusive and \r\nbroader partnerships by engaging all actors in \r\ndevelopment cooperation and by embracing diverse \r\napproaches to development. We will make every effort \r\nto reflect the concerns of the African region in the \r\nForum. \r\n Before I conclude, I should like to reaffirm our \r\nbelief that Africa holds great potential to become a \r\ndriving force for global economic growth. It is in our \r\ncommon interest, therefore, to help Africa to achieve \r\nsustainable development through enhanced partnership. \r\nI wish to reiterate that the Republic of Korea will \r\nremain fully committed to closely working with our \r\npartners in Africa in that process. \r\n Mr. Loulichki (Morocco) (spoke in French): My \r\ndelegation welcomes the opportunity to take part in \r\ntoday’s debate, which is so important for the African \r\ncontinent. We thank the Secretary-General for the \r\nquality of his reports on the New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development (A/66/202 and A/66/214). \r\n In addition to the statement made by the \r\nrepresentative of Kenya on behalf of the African \r\nGroup, which of course my delegation fully supports, I \r\nwould like to add the following remarks. \r\n Less than five years before the deadline for \r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals, the \r\nAfrican continent continues to face hurdles in \r\nachieving those Goals. Today’s debate provides an \r\nopportunity to discuss the various initiatives and \r\napproaches that will enable the continent to address the \r\nchallenges of sustainable and human development.  \r\n No one can deny the progress made by the \r\nAfrican continent, primarily in terms of conflict \r\nresolution and the return to stability, without which \r\nsustainable development would be nothing but a distant \r\nand always elusive goal. Nor can anyone deny that \r\nAfrican countries have implemented ambitious \r\npolicies, which have enabled us to consolidate our \r\ndemocratic and macroeconomic achievements and \r\ngood governance practices. \r\n In geo-economic terms, with its abundant mining, \r\nmineral and energy resources, along with its \r\nconsiderable human potential, Africa is playing an \r\nincreasingly strategic role as a key player in the global \r\neconomy.  \r\n The average growth rate of 4.9 per cent in 2010 \r\ncertainly surpassed that of 2009, estimated at 3.1 per \r\ncent. Nevertheless, the continent has yet to reach the \r\nthreshold growth rate of 7 per cent required to ensure \r\nsustainable, comprehensive and inclusive development, \r\nas well as to improve the lives of its citizens and \r\nachieve its development goals.  \r\n We must therefore think about how to give much-\r\nneeded impetus to the collective initiatives and actions \r\nof Africa and its development partners at the \r\nmultilateral, regional and subregional levels. This \r\nwould facilitate efforts to foster the growth and the \r\nsustainable and human development of the continent. \r\n The situation that Africa is facing, which is \r\nmarked by a series of social, economic and food crises, \r\ncombined with numerous security and environmental \r\nchallenges, requires a deeper commitment by Africa’s \r\ndevelopment partner countries. \r\n A/66/PV.33\r\n \r\n11 11-54043 \r\n \r\n In view of the financial crisis and the resulting \r\nbudget constraints adopted in many countries, official \r\ndevelopment assistance and fulfilment of the \r\ncommitments made by the Group of Eight have taken \r\non vital importance for African countries, in particular \r\nthe least developed among them. We therefore urge the \r\ninternational community to keep its promises and to \r\nprovide further support to the African continent by \r\nmaking it a central priority of programmes designed to \r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals. \r\n At the same time, we must step up South-South \r\ncooperation, a significant vehicle for Africa’s economic \r\nand social development, by boosting trade and \r\noptimizing partnerships. In that respect, the initiative \r\nof emerging countries to forge specific and targeted \r\npartnerships with Africa will give decisive momentum \r\nto South-South cooperation. Efforts must also be made \r\nto identify innovative cooperation mechanisms among \r\nthe countries of the South that can drive their \r\ndevelopment and increase their prosperity. \r\n Moreover, regional integration continues to be an \r\nexcellent means of capitalizing on regional \r\ndevelopment efforts. It is, furthermore, a prerequisite \r\nfor creating the synergies necessary to ensure the \r\nproper and optimal use of individual capacities for the \r\ncommon good. \r\n The role of the private sector as a catalyst for \r\ndevelopment in Africa is clear. Growing and committed \r\nprivate-sector involvement in African development \r\nwould not only mobilize the resources necessary for \r\nvarious development programmes, but also build \r\nAfrica’s capacities and, more indirectly, its \r\ncompetitiveness, which would enable it to become a \r\nkey link in the global economy, and not just a mere \r\nnatural resource pool or a market for industrial goods. \r\nIn that connection, my country laments the lack of \r\nprogress made in the Doha Round of negotiations, \r\nparticularly on quotas relevant to Africa. We urge the \r\nmain stakeholders to accelerate their efforts to \r\nconclude the Doha Round. \r\n In terms of foreign direct investment, which is so \r\ncrucial to the development of the continent, I wish to \r\nreiterate the special importance of convening a high-\r\nlevel meeting of the General Assembly on investment \r\nin Africa, which would serve as a tool for the \r\ndevelopment and economic growth of the continent. \r\nThis proposal stems from the unfailing commitment of \r\nHis Majesty the King of Morocco to Africa’s \r\ndevelopment. It takes the form of partnerships with the \r\nUnited Nations for peace and security in Africa, \r\nassistance for training and human resources \r\ndevelopment and the sharing of expertise in the areas \r\nof agriculture, fishing, tourism, electricity supply, \r\nwater management and the fight against desertification. \r\nThese partnerships involve various African and \r\nnon-African countries. \r\n My country stands ready to further enhance such \r\ncooperation and to expand it in the interest of \r\nsustainable and harmonious development in Africa. \r\n Mr. Nissilä (Finland): Sustainable economic \r\ngrowth is one of the key elements in poverty reduction. \r\nIn particular, during the ongoing global economic \r\ncrisis, we have seen that efforts in Africa to improve \r\neconomic performance and private sector development \r\nhave started to bear fruit. In fact, while many \r\ndeveloped economies have been struggling to keep \r\ngrowth going, many African countries have shown \r\nenviable gross domestic product growth figures.  \r\n Economic growth, investments in infrastructure, \r\nsocial protection systems, and the promotion of good \r\ngovernance and human rights are all key elements. In \r\ndeveloping appropriate social protection mechanisms, \r\nwe must pay particular attention to the promotion of \r\nwomen’s and girls’ rights and to the promotion of \r\nsocial equality. The New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) has been one of the key players \r\nin those developments.  \r\n Finland believes that the active cooperation with \r\nother international organizations that NEPAD has \r\nengaged in can further enhance sustainable economic \r\ndevelopment in Africa. The growth of economic \r\nintegration in Africa is very important for the \r\ndevelopment of the continent. The African economy \r\nhas to be strengthened, diversified and integrated into \r\nthe world economy. \r\n Finland has been a strong supporter of the Africa \r\nInvestment Initiative of NEPAD and the Organization \r\nfor Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). \r\nIn particular, the Initiative supports a large-scale \r\nprogramme on unlocking investment potential in \r\nSouthern Africa. It assists members of the Southern \r\nAfrica Development Community in identifying and \r\nimplementing concrete policy reforms to strengthen \r\ntheir investment climate. The programme entails four \r\ncountry-level investment reviews and facilitates the \r\nsharing of national experiences through regional \r\nA/66/PV.33  \r\n \r\n11-54043 12 \r\n \r\nforums and peer review. Zambia and Mozambique have \r\nstarted to assess their investment regime within the \r\nframework of the programme. \r\n Finland currently acts as Co-Chair for the Africa \r\nPartnership Forum, a high-level dialogue forum for the \r\nGroup of Eight, NEPAD, the African Union and the \r\nOECD. As a co-Chair, Finland has stressed the \r\ndevelopment of Africa’s own capabilities and the issue \r\nof responsible investment. \r\n I would now like to touch upon sub-item (b) of \r\nagenda item 63, relating to the causes of conflict and \r\nthe promotion of durable peace and sustainable \r\ndevelopment in Africa, as well as to thank the \r\nSecretary-General for his excellent report (A/66/214). \r\nThe report highlights a number of crucial issues, such \r\nas youth, education and employment and issues \r\nrelating to conflict and natural resources. The report \r\nalso stresses the importance of more active engagement \r\nof young people in the promotion of peace and \r\nsecurity. I should now like to take up some examples of \r\nhow Finland supports its African partners in the field \r\nof peace and security.  \r\n First, Finland has supported the strengthening of \r\nthe African Union’s mediation support capacity \r\nthrough a three-year project financed through \r\ndevelopment cooperation funds. The project has \r\nachieved good results, and it will continue. The \r\npurpose of this programme is to develop Africa’s own \r\ncapabilities to prevent and resolve conflicts, including \r\nby supporting the participation of women and by \r\nensuring adequate consideration of gender issues in \r\npeace processes. We would like to congratulate the \r\nAfrican Union for its work in advancing the agenda on \r\nwomen, peace and security. \r\n Finland also contributed to the work of the \r\nAfrican Union High-level Implementation Panel on the \r\nSudan, led by former South African President Mbeki. It \r\nis also important to stress the role of non-governmental \r\norganizations in mediation and all peacebuilding \r\nefforts. Finland has, together with the African Centre \r\nfor the Constructive Resolution of Disputes, a South \r\nAfrican non-governmental organization, established the \r\nAfrican Peacebuilding Coordination Programme. The \r\nProgramme focuses on enhancing coherence and \r\ncoordination in peacebuilding, with the aim of \r\npromoting local ownership in peacebuilding processes \r\nand supporting the design and implementation of \r\npeacebuilding policy frameworks.  \r\n We have also been a longstanding supporter of \r\nFemmes Africa Solidarité, most recently in their work \r\nin assisting the Democratic Republic of the Congo, \r\nRwanda and Burundi in the preparation of their \r\nnational action plans on women, peace and security. \r\n Peace and security are prerequisites for \r\nsustainable development. At the same time, economic \r\nand social development, including the rule of law and \r\nhuman rights, is a major contributor to political \r\nstability and, ultimately, to peace and security. It is of \r\nthe utmost importance for Africa and for the \r\ninternational community to strengthen peace and \r\ndevelopment, thereby allowing African countries to use \r\ntheir resources for human development and the well-\r\nbeing of their citizens. \r\n Mr. Elyes Lakhal (Tunisia) (spoke in French): \r\nMy delegation aligns itself with the statement delivered \r\nby the representative of Argentina on behalf of the \r\nGroup of 77 and China and by the representative of \r\nKenya on behalf of the African Group. We would like \r\nto highlight several issues that Tunisia believes are of \r\nparticular importance. \r\n Today’s discussion is of special importance, as it \r\nconcerns a number of matters that are of crucial \r\nimportance to Africa and marks the tenth anniversary \r\nof the New Partnership for Africa’s Development \r\n(NEPAD), following its adoption at the Organization of \r\nAfrican Unity summit held in 2001 in Lusaka. \r\n Over the past 10 years, NEPAD has built up \r\ninstitutional and technical experience at the regional \r\nand international levels and has enabled the creation of \r\na forum for reflection on political, economic and \r\nenvironmental matters. NEPAD has also enabled the \r\nAfrican Union’s objectives to be translated into \r\nspecific, visible and pragmatic projects, particularly \r\nwhen it comes to the objectives of strengthening \r\nregional integration, food security and the eradication \r\nof poverty. \r\n Thanks to NEPAD, Africa has been able to make \r\nsome progress in recent years in the areas of peace, \r\npolitical governance and economic growth. Progress \r\nhas also been made in upholding human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms and in the organization of free \r\nand fair elections, notably through the activities of the \r\nAfrica Peer Review Mechanism. In this regard, Tunisia \r\nis, for the first time in our history, preparing for \r\ncredible, transparent and free elections, which will be \r\nheld in less than a month, in order to elect a constituent \r\n A/66/PV.33\r\n \r\n13 11-54043 \r\n \r\nassembly. We are determined to achieve this important \r\nmilestone, which will doubtless constitute a significant \r\nstep on Africa’s road to democracy and good \r\ngovernance. \r\n These elements of progress illustrate Africa’s \r\ndetermination to move towards sustainable growth and \r\nimprove the image of our continent. However, despite \r\nthese encouraging results, African countries are aware \r\nof the need for additional efforts, with a view to \r\nmaking economic growth more inclusive and more \r\neffective and to harnessing internal resources by \r\ninvolving the private sector in development activities \r\nto a greater extent.  \r\n In the context of high youth unemployment, \r\ndevelopment partners are called upon to support and \r\nencourage the efforts being made by Africa, in \r\nparticular, by honouring their official development \r\nassistance commitments, promoting foreign direct \r\ninvestment and removing barriers to African exports. \r\nAccordingly, Tunisia welcomes the adoption by the \r\nGeneral Assembly of a review mechanism for \r\ncommitments to Africa’s development needs. This \r\nmechanism should enable a greater focus on assessing \r\nand measuring the implementation of official \r\ndevelopment assistance commitments and other \r\ncommitments made with respect to aid to Africa. \r\n The achievement of the objectives of the Global \r\nMalaria Action Plan has an impact on almost all of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. It is therefore \r\nimportant to support the efforts of the global \r\npartnership to roll back this illness which is so costly \r\nto the African continent.  \r\n In that connection, my delegation welcomes the \r\nincrease in international financing for the fight against \r\nmalaria over the past 10 years, which has enabled \r\nnotable progress, particularly when it comes to \r\nincreased access to insecticide-treated mosquito nets. \r\nWe have thus increased the number of protected \r\npersons in sub-Saharan Africa from 13 million in 2005 \r\nto 75 million in 2009. This progress, although \r\nnoteworthy, is not sufficient to achieve the objective \r\nwe have set for ourselves in the area of malaria. It is \r\ntherefore essential for all countries to work together to \r\nprovide the funding necessary to fight against this \r\nscourge. \r\n In spite of the considerable progress made in \r\npeace, security and development, Africa remains \r\nconfronted with many complex problems, including \r\ninter-State conflicts, unconstitutional changes of \r\nGovernment, the illicit trade in small arms and light \r\nweapons, and high unemployment, particularly among \r\nyoung people. In that connection, we thank the \r\nSecretary-General for his recently published report on \r\nthe causes of conflict and the promotion of durable \r\npeace and sustainable development in Africa \r\n(A/66/214), which provides an analysis of the two most \r\nurgent problems afflicting Africa, namely, youth \r\neducation and employment, and conflicts and natural \r\nresources, both of which have serious consequences for \r\nthe political and economic development of Africa and \r\nits political stability.  \r\n According to the Population Division of the \r\nUnited Nations Department of Economic and Social \r\nAffairs, 60 per cent of Africa’s population, almost \r\n1 billion people, is under 25 years of age. In view of \r\nthe population explosion among young people, we are \r\nduty-bound to attach particular importance to the \r\nurgency at the international level of providing quality \r\neducation, professional skills and decent jobs. We \r\nagree with the Secretary-General’s assertion that the \r\nuprisings seen in North Africa were partially due to \r\nyouth unemployment, which has reached the alarming \r\nlevels of 31 per cent in Tunisia and 34 per cent in \r\nEgypt. We also agree that unemployment can cause \r\nyoung people to become involved in criminal and \r\nviolent activities.  \r\n In that connection, my delegation calls upon \r\ndevelopment partners, including international and civil \r\nsociety organizations, to support the efforts of African \r\nGovernments to address the causes of despair among \r\nAfrican youth at the social, political and economic \r\nlevels and to support national efforts in the areas of \r\ninvestment, job creation and poverty eradication in \r\nAfrica.  \r\n In conclusion, my delegation will always be \r\ncommitted to contributing constructively to these \r\nfundamental matters for Africa’s development. \r\n Mr. Tommo Monthe (Cameroon) (spoke in \r\nFrench): Allow me to begin by congratulating the \r\nSecretary-General on the report published in document \r\nA/66/202, entitled “New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment: ninth consolidated progress report on \r\nimplementation and international support”. \r\n I would also like to indicate that my delegation \r\nendorses the statement made from this podium on \r\nbehalf of the African Group.  \r\nA/66/PV.33  \r\n \r\n11-54043 14 \r\n \r\n As stressed at the outset by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, the publication of the report coincides with a \r\nnumber of salient events, namely, the tenth anniversary \r\nof the adoption by African leaders of the flagship \r\nprogramme of the African Union, which is the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD); the \r\nHigh-level Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly, \r\nheld in this Hall in September 2010 on the margins of \r\nthe sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly, on the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs); the adoption, \r\nlast May, of the Istanbul Programme of Action at the \r\nFourth United Nations Conference on the Least \r\nDeveloped Countries; and the adoption of the \r\nFramework for Implementation of the Recommendations \r\nof the Millennium Development Goals Africa Steering \r\nGroup.  \r\n In the opinion of the Secretary-General, all of this \r\npoints to a resurgence of attention, which, at the same \r\ntime, shows that African countries have experienced \r\nmany difficulties in achieving the MDGs. In section II \r\nof his report, the Secretary-General analyses actions \r\ntaken by African countries and organizations. In \r\nsection III, we see the response of the international \r\ncommunity. In section IV, the support provided by the \r\nUnited Nations system is analysed. \r\n Allow me to begin by providing an overview of \r\nthe progress made in the implementation of NEPAD in \r\nthe context of the four salient elements I referred to \r\nearlier, as well in the light of the main \r\nrecommendations of the relevant resolutions of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and those contained in the report \r\nunder consideration.  \r\n The recommended actions include: coordinating \r\nall forms of foreign aid in order to incorporate them \r\ninto national development; contributing to the \r\ncapacity-building of the regional economic \r\ncommunities; bolstering and developing local transit \r\ninfrastructures and continuing to pool best practices so \r\nas to strengthen regional integration; and supporting \r\nthe development of the private sector in Africa, the \r\npromotion of joint projects between the public sector \r\nand the private sector, and the attainment of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), in keeping \r\nwith the decisions of the Executive Council of the \r\nAfrican Union in this respect. \r\n In general terms, my delegation shares the view \r\nof the Secretary-General that in the context of the \r\ncurrent fragile and uncertain global recovery, the \r\nimplementation of NEPAD and the achievement of the \r\nMDGs will require unwavering resolve and leadership \r\non the part of the African countries and development \r\npartners alike if we are to translate theory into practice. \r\n Like the Secretary-General, we welcome the fact \r\nthat at the continent-wide level, the African Union in \r\nFebruary 2010 approved the integration of NEPAD into \r\nthe structures and processes of the Union and \r\nestablished the NEPAD Planning and Coordination \r\nAgency, whose mandate is to implement priority \r\nprogrammes and projects at the regional and \r\ncontinental levels in Africa. \r\n With respect to the regional economic \r\ncommunities, which play a flagship role in the context \r\nof economic integration, we note with satisfaction that \r\nthose communities are endeavouring to fulfil their \r\nleading role in the implementation of projects. Here I \r\nam thinking in particular of the Economic Community \r\nof West African States, the Southern Africa \r\nDevelopment Community, the Economic Community \r\nof Central African States (ECCAS) and the Central \r\nAfrican Economic and Monetary Community \r\n(CEMAC). \r\n At the national level, it is clear that the countries \r\non the continent have each developed their own \r\ndevelopment programmes, consistent with the \r\nobjectives of NEPAD. \r\n At these various levels, efforts are continuing \r\naimed at implementing the programmes in the various \r\nsectors identified by the Steering Group set up by the \r\nSecretary-General with a view to attaining the MDGs \r\nin Africa, in particular agriculture and food security, \r\neducation, health, infrastructure, trade facilitation and \r\nstatistical systems. \r\n My delegation wishes to contribute to this \r\nassessment on the basis of the experience of my own \r\ncountry, Cameroon, in the context of the Central \r\nAfrican subregion. \r\n With respect to coordinating all forms of foreign \r\naid so as to integrate them effectively into national \r\ndevelopment, Cameroon in 2010 embarked upon the \r\nestablishment of a joint strategy for development. The \r\nfirst phase of the strategy, which involves an \r\nassessment, has made it possible to conduct several \r\nstudies: one on the factors that are hampering the \r\nconsumption of foreign aid; one assessing the \r\n A/66/PV.33\r\n \r\n15 11-54043 \r\n \r\nimplementation of the Paris Declaration; and a further \r\nsurvey of the indicators related to the Declaration. \r\n With respect to the capacity-building of the \r\nregional economic communities, Cameroon, which is a \r\nmember of ECCAS and CEMAC, is in the process of \r\nimplementing all the resolutions adopted by those \r\ninstitutions. The most recent example was the \r\nlaunching in Yaoundé in July 2010 of the Steering \r\nCommittee on the streamlining of the regional \r\neconomic communities, which seeks to harmonize their \r\npolicies and programmes in the long term, and the \r\nconvening in September 2010 of the working group \r\ncharged with identifying areas for streamlining and \r\nwith outlining an action plan for the Steering \r\nCommittee. \r\n As far as the strengthening and development of \r\ninfrastructure is concerned, in recent years Cameroon \r\nhas begun the construction of a transport network that \r\nis open to neighbouring countries. Cameroon’s \r\nstrategic vision of the country as a trading crossroads \r\nin Central Africa is taking shape in the form of two \r\ncomprehensive planning frameworks. \r\n The first is a national railroad master plan that \r\ntakes into account the issue of regional integration \r\nthrough the interconnection of railway lines between \r\nCameroon on the one hand and Chad, the Central \r\nAfrican Republic, Nigeria, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, \r\nthe Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo \r\non the other hand. \r\n The second is a national ports master plan that \r\ninvolves, inter alia, the construction of a deepwater \r\nport in Kribi, on the Atlantic seaboard, the aim of \r\nwhich is to provide access to the sea for the subregion \r\nas a whole. President Paul Biya laid the cornerstone for \r\nthis important endeavour on 7 October 2011. \r\n On land, Cameroon and the Congo have \r\nundertaken studies on stretches of road in their \r\nrespective territories, with a view to linking \r\nSangmélima, in Cameroon, with Ouesso, in the Congo. \r\n Between Cameroon and Nigeria, the transport \r\nfacilitation programme on the multinational Bamenda-\r\nEnugu road corridor is ready for implementation. \r\n Between Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea, the \r\nproject to asphalt the Kribi-Campo road and build a \r\nbridge over the Ntem river, between Campo and Rio \r\nCampo, is under way. \r\n Between Cameroon, Chad and the Central \r\nAfrican Republic, the regional flagship project is being \r\nimplemented in the Douala-N’Djamena and Douala-\r\nBangui pilot corridors. \r\n Other recommendations in the process of \r\nimplementation concern support for the development \r\nof the private sector in Africa, the promotion of \r\npartnership projects between the public and private \r\nsectors, and the implementation of the MDGs, in \r\naccordance with the decisions of the Executive Council \r\nof the African Union in that area. \r\n In 2010, which saw the implementation of the \r\nstrategy for growth and employment, Cameroon took \r\nan array of measures to develop the private sector \r\nspanning the period up to 2013. In the context of the \r\nimplementation of the strategy document for growth \r\nand employment, Cameroon intends to rely on the \r\nfollowing guidelines for developing the private sector, \r\nwhich include the diversification of the economy, in \r\norder to allow for the transition from a retail economy \r\nto a manufacturing economy, through the development \r\nof growth industries, capacity-building for businesses, \r\nwith a focus on the consolidation of small units, \r\nimproving competitiveness and the business \r\nenvironment. To that end, emphasis has been placed on \r\nthe fight against corruption, market-access \r\ndevelopment and the diversification of sources of \r\nfunding. Concerning access to local markets, the \r\nGovernment is encouraging the search for new outlets \r\nfor local products. With respect to the diversification of \r\nfunding sources, we are looking at developing public-\r\nprivate partnerships; facilitating access to loans for \r\nsmall- and medium-sized enterprises by offering loan \r\nguarantees, increasing the supply of decent jobs \r\nthrough business creation, diversifying the economy \r\nand improving competitiveness and the business \r\nenvironment. \r\n Turning now to attainment of the MDGs, the \r\nactions my country has taken with regard to \r\neliminating extreme poverty and hunger consist of, \r\namong other things, promoting a stable macroeconomic \r\nframework; strengthening growth by diversifying the \r\neconomy; reinvigorating the private sector as a driver \r\nof growth and a partner in the provision of social \r\nservices; developing basic infrastructure; and \r\nsupporting rural populations in their initiatives in \r\nrelevant areas such as agriculture, animal husbandry, \r\nagriculture and food processing. \r\nA/66/PV.33  \r\n \r\n11-54043 16 \r\n \r\n Furthermore, the Government of Cameroon is \r\nimplementing an education sector strategy designed, \r\namong other things, to expand access to education \r\nwhile reducing disparities and increasing quality and \r\nimproving management and governance of the \r\neducational system. Cameroon has also ratified the \r\nConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of \r\nDiscrimination against Women. While we have seen a \r\nslight improvement in the ratio between men and \r\nwomen in every area, much still remains to be done, \r\nand the Ministry for the Advancement of Women has \r\nlaunched several actions. Similarly, with regard to \r\nreducing child mortality and combating HIV/AIDS, \r\nmalaria and other diseases, officials expect to reach \r\nthese goals through the implementation of our health \r\nsector strategy. \r\n Concerning a sustainable environment, the \r\nGovernment has formulated a strategy for biodiversity \r\nand a forestry-environment sector programme that \r\nseeks to ensure compliance with international \r\nconventions and regional agreements. We also have a \r\nframework law regulating environmental management. \r\nCameroon is a key player in all the programmes that \r\nhave been initiated in central Africa in this area, \r\nincluding the Central African Forestry Commission, \r\nthe Subregional Action Programme for combating \r\ndesertification in Central Africa, the Niger Basin \r\nAuthority, the Lake Chad Basin Commission and the \r\nCongo Basin Forest Partnership. \r\n Cameroon’s efforts to implement NEPAD have \r\nbeen made possible by its national policies and its \r\nestablishment of a secure footing in the subregion, but \r\nalso thanks to international cooperation. In that regard, \r\nmy country generally welcomes the response of the \r\ninternational community as it seeks to fully exploit the \r\nmomentum of international support for Africa’s \r\ndevelopment, the topic in section III of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report. However, it must be admitted that \r\nmuch remains to be done in terms of official \r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA), debt management, \r\ndirect foreign investment, and trade. \r\n With respect to official development assistance, \r\naccording to the Organization for Economic \r\nCooperation and Development (OECD), of the \r\n$128 billion in total donor contributions, $48 billion \r\nwere disbursed in Africa, which represents an annual \r\nincrease in real terms of 11.7 per cent. However, the \r\nMDG Gap Task Force, studying delays in achievement \r\nof the MDGs, has deplored the $18 billion ODA \r\nshortfall and estimates that Africa has actually received \r\nonly $46 billion, far below the $64 billion pledged at \r\nthe Gleneagles Summit. This is therefore an \r\nopportunity to remind donors of the need to continue to \r\nfulfil their commitments. There have been some efforts \r\nto relieve the burden of debt for African countries, such \r\nas the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative \r\n(HIPC) and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative, as \r\nwell as bilateral debt forgiveness. On 28 July, \r\n26 African countries, including Cameroon, reached the \r\ncompletion point and benefited from debt relief as \r\nprovided for in the HPIC Initiative. We all know, \r\nhowever, that the economic crisis has been detrimental \r\nto such efforts through its adverse impact on Africa’s \r\ndebt levels. \r\n In the area of foreign investment, we welcome \r\nthe efforts of African countries to improve their \r\ninvestment environment, which has somewhat \r\nincreased the flow of direct foreign investment, \r\nparticularly for emerging countries. We encourage \r\ndevelopment partners to continue the support they are \r\nalready providing through the NEPAD-OECD Africa \r\nInvestment Initiative. Finally, with regard to trade, the \r\nDoha Round of negotiations have made very little \r\nprogress towards reaching an agreement on issues of \r\nconcern to Africa, including ending subsidies for \r\nagricultural exports. This is notwithstanding the \r\ncommitments made at the Group of 20 Summit held in \r\nSeoul in November 2010. \r\n In section V of his report, the Secretary-General \r\nmade various recommendations, including on the \r\nimportance of African countries continuing their \r\neffective implementation of NEPAD projects and \r\nprogrammes; the need for robust African leadership in \r\norder to achieve tangible results; strengthening civic \r\nparticipation in Africa; the development of the \r\nagricultural sector to ensure food security, in \r\naccordance with the Maputo Declaration; greater \r\nparticipation by women, in the context of the African \r\nWomen’s Decade 2010-2020; the integration of the \r\nclimate issue into economic planning and management; \r\nthe reduction of foreign aid dependency and the \r\npromotion of self-reliance; job creation; strengthening \r\nAfrica’s contribution to world trade; and foreign debt \r\nrelief. \r\n But how do we implement all of these \r\nrecommendations? While the answer is unquestionably \r\nthrough greater commitment on the part of Africa \r\nitself, it is also through development partners’ respect \r\n A/66/PV.33\r\n \r\n17 11-54043 \r\n \r\nfor their own commitments, a conclusion shared by the \r\nSecretary-General’s report on NEPAD, the outcome \r\ndocument of the High-level Meeting on the MDGs \r\n(resolution 65/1), the Istanbul Declaration on the Least \r\nDeveloped Countries and the Millennium Development \r\nGoals Africa Steering Group. \r\n Before I conclude, allow me to add a few words \r\non agenda item 13, “2001-2010: Decade to Roll Back \r\nMalaria in Developing Countries, Particularly in \r\nAfrica”, the subject of a note by the Secretary-General \r\ncontained in document A/66/169 and of the second part \r\nof this joint debate. There are basically three areas in \r\nthe report that drew our attention, namely, section III, \r\non funding the fight against malaria; section VIII, on \r\nthe impact of the World Health Organization’s \r\nprogrammes aimed at combating malaria in the African \r\nregion; and section XI, which contains the report’s \r\nsummary and recommendations. \r\n First, on funding, we welcome the increase in \r\ndisbursements, which increased from $0.3 billion in \r\n2003 to $1.8 billion in 2010. I welcome the \r\ncommitment of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, \r\nTuberculosis and Malaria, and the United States \r\nAgency for International Development. However, \r\ndespite such progress, I must note that the total level of \r\nfunding is lower than the annual sum sought in the \r\nGlobal Malaria Action Plan.  \r\n With respect to the impact of existing \r\nprogrammes, we are gratified to see the progress made. \r\nIn general terms, the current trends, if confirmed, tend \r\nto demonstrate that intensive anti-malaria efforts could \r\nhelp many African countries. \r\n Finally, the Secretary-General’s recommendations \r\nare of genuine interest to my delegation. They include \r\nintensifying the battle by distributing pre-treated \r\nmosquito nets and diagnostic tests, access to \r\ncombination therapy, continuing to seek foreign aid, \r\ngreater respect for regulations governing the quality of \r\nmedicines on the market, and capacity-building within \r\nhealth ministries, to name but a few. All those \r\nmeasures would buttress national efforts to combat \r\nmalaria. \r\n I wish to reiterate my delegation’s gratitude to the \r\nSecretary-General and to convey to him, his Special \r\nEnvoy for Malaria, the Director-General of the World \r\nHealth Organization and all those operating in the field \r\nour encouragement in their efforts to combat malaria. \r\n To conclude, as my delegation has had cause to \r\nstate in the past with respect to NEPAD and the fight \r\nagainst malaria, the United Nations needs to develop \r\nan articulate action plan that includes a matrix \r\nestablishing a planning period of two or three years for \r\nall contributions to the implementation of these \r\nprogrammes, accompanied by clear-cut reference to \r\nbenchmarks and the distribution of roles, so that at the \r\nend of the process we can gauge how far we have come \r\nand how much remains to be done. The office of the \r\nSecretary-General’s Special Envoy for Malaria, which \r\nwe commend for its arduous work, must begin \r\npreparing such a matrix. \r\n Mr. Kebret (Ethiopia): Permit me at the outset to \r\nexpress our appreciation to the President for convening \r\nthis plenary meeting of great importance to Africa and \r\nto fully associate ourselves with the statement \r\ndelivered by the representative of Kenya on behalf of \r\nthe Group of African States on the agenda items under \r\nconsideration. \r\n Ethiopia welcomes the two reports of the \r\nSecretary-General on the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (A/66/202) and on the cause of conflicts, \r\nthe promotion of peace and sustainable development in \r\nAfrica (A/66/214). We would like to thank the \r\nSecretary-General for his comprehensive reports, \r\nwhich review progress made in the implementation of \r\nthe development projects, programmes, strategies and \r\nchallenges faced by the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) over the past decade, as well as \r\nthe steps that need to be taken to achieve greater \r\nprogress in the years ahead. \r\n As we commemorate the tenth anniversary of \r\nNEPAD, Ethiopia is pleased to note that NEPAD has \r\nmade significant progress in terms of owning and \r\nleading its strategies and programmes in areas such as \r\nagriculture, infrastructure, health and education, and in \r\nlaying a solid foundation for sound socio-economic \r\ndevelopment in Africa. NEPAD’s sector-specific \r\nprogrammes, particularly in agriculture and \r\ninfrastructure, are indeed critical to this progress and to \r\nthe overall achievements obtained in other equally \r\nimportant areas of development. \r\n On the good governance front, NEPAD has also \r\ndemonstrated its useful support to Africa in its efforts \r\nto further promote, respect and protect fundamental \r\nhuman rights and freedoms by implementing \r\nprogrammes aimed at improving good political and \r\nA/66/PV.33  \r\n \r\n11-54043 18 \r\n \r\neconomic governance throughout the continent. In this \r\nregard, we are encouraged to note that 30 African \r\ncountries have already acceded to the African Peer \r\nReview Mechanism (APRM) and that 14 African \r\ncountries, including my own, have submitted their \r\nreports for review by APRM. We wish to take this \r\nopportunity to encourage other African countries that \r\nhave not yet done so to accede to the APRM and to \r\npresent their national reports. \r\n As the Secretary-General indicates in his reports, \r\nAfrica’s leadership and commitment to social progress, \r\nsustained economic growth and good governance \r\nreforms are slowly but surely changing perceptions of \r\nthe continent in the right and positive direction. \r\nHowever, the impact of pockets of conflict in different \r\nparts of the continent and widespread poverty still \r\nundermine Africa’s successful efforts to change its \r\nimage. \r\n With regard to resources to support development \r\nprogrammes, African countries have committed \r\nthemselves to achieving the Millennium Development \r\nGoals through, inter alia, the allocation of 10 per cent \r\nof their budgets to agriculture, 15 per cent to health \r\nand 20 per cent to education. We would like to \r\nrecognize and express our gratitude for the support of \r\nthe United Nations and development partners to \r\nNEPAD programmes and for their continued \r\ncommitment to advancing NEPAD’s vision.  \r\n However, much remains to be done if Africa is to \r\nextricate itself from the deep-rooted poverty and the \r\neconomic problems it faces and assume its rightful \r\nplace in the international community. The high rates of \r\nunemployment and the limited access to energy \r\ncontinue to hamper the continent’s ability to create \r\nwealth and jobs. In this regard, we share the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s view that firm determination and leadership \r\nare required from all of us — Africans, African \r\ncountries and our international development partners — in \r\norder to achieve the goals that NEPAD has set out for \r\nAfrica’s rapid economic integration and development. \r\n As clearly indicated in the Secretary-General’s \r\nreports, Africa’s share of global trade and incoming \r\nforeign direct investment is only 4 per cent. Ethiopia \r\nunderlines the important role of trade and investment \r\nin promoting economic growth and bringing Africa into \r\nthe mainstream of the global economy. It is our hope \r\nand expectation that the long overdue Doha Round of \r\nmultilateral trade negotiations should be accelerated \r\nwith a view to creating a conducive and enabling \r\nenvironment. \r\n It is exactly 11 years since the international \r\ncommunity expressed its determination to effectively \r\naddress the serious impact of malaria on developing \r\ncountries, particularly in Africa. Over the years, a \r\nbroad range of national and international actions has \r\nbeen under taken to tackle this deadly disease. \r\n As is known, the impact of this disease on \r\nsocio-economic development remains significant \r\ndespite considerable political attention and financial \r\nsupport available at the national, regional and \r\ninternational levels. There is a need for enhanced \r\nfinancial, technical and other forms of assistance from \r\nthe international community to ensure sustainable \r\ndevelopment in Africa. \r\n Malaria is one of the major public health \r\nproblems of my country. Approximately 68 per cent of \r\nour population lives in malaria-prone areas and 75 per \r\ncent of our land mass is malaria-infested. Recognizing \r\nthe adverse impact of the malaria epidemic on socio-\r\neconomic development efforts, malaria prevention and \r\ncontrol programmes in Ethiopia have been the priority \r\nin our health sector. We have adopted a 10-year \r\nnational strategic plan aimed at rapidly scaling up \r\nmalaria control interventions to achieve a 50 per cent \r\nreduction of the malaria problem within this specified \r\ntime frame. \r\n The deployment of over 30,000 health extension \r\nworkers for health-care service delivery at the \r\ncommunity level is part of our national efforts to \r\ncontrol the disease. As a result, malaria-caused deaths \r\nhave declined substantially, falling by 55 per cent since \r\n1990, and the effective scale-up of malaria prevention \r\nand treatment has also achieved a dramatic decline in \r\noutpatient malaria cases. \r\n Before I conclude, I would like reiterate our \r\ncommitment to continuing to work with other African \r\ncountries and the international community to translate \r\ninto reality NEPAD’s long-term vision and to support \r\nits strategies and programmes designed to help Africa’s \r\nsocio-economic development endeavours. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): In \r\naccordance with resolution 49/2 of 19 October 1994, I \r\nnow call on the observer of the International \r\nFederation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. \r\n A/66/PV.33\r\n \r\n19 11-54043 \r\n \r\n Ms. Oosterhof (International Federation of Red \r\nCross and Red Crescent Societies): The International \r\nFederation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent \r\nSocieties (IFRC) statement concerns the agenda item \r\non the Decade to Roll Back Malaria in Developing \r\nCountries.  \r\n The International Federation of Red Cross and \r\nRed Crescent Societies welcomes the note by the \r\nSecretary-General (A/66/169) transmitting the World \r\nHealth Organization report on the progress made in \r\naddressing the goals towards malaria control over the \r\npast decade. The findings are cause for optimism and \r\ndemonstrate that approaches of our global response to \r\nmalaria work. \r\n Since 2002, the IFRC and its 186 member \r\nnational societies, in partnership with other \r\norganizations, have contributed to these successes by \r\ndistributing more than 15 million mosquito nets, \r\nprotecting 25.5 million people and preventing more \r\nthan 420,000 malaria deaths. As a member of the Roll \r\nBack Malaria Partnership, we welcome the positive \r\nresults outlined by the Partnership’s report released in \r\nSeptember. The findings tell us that working in \r\npartnership is effective and has created a foundation \r\nthat will allow for even greater results in the years to \r\ncome. \r\n Despite the many successes in combating \r\nmalaria, we recognize that malaria remains one of the \r\nmost devastating global public health challenges and \r\ncontinues to have an impact on the lives of poor, young \r\nand vulnerable people, thereby affecting the future of \r\nmany developing countries. \r\n In order to sustain the advances made, the IFRC \r\nwelcomes the forward-looking recommendations \r\nhighlighted in the report transmitted by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s note. As stated in the report, it is important \r\nto recognize that “[a]t the heart of all malaria control \r\nprogrammes are people” (A/66/169, para. 73). From \r\nour long-standing experience, we reaffirm that if \r\nmalaria control programmes are to succeed, the \r\nengagement of people in communities is essential. \r\n This is why the Red Cross and Red Crescent \r\ncontribution to scaling up malaria prevention is \r\nfocused on social mobilization, communication and \r\ndirect assistance to people and households in \r\ncommunities. Every year, Red Cross and Red Crescent \r\nnational societies reach millions of people and \r\nhouseholds through community-based activities. The \r\ndirect delivery of services and active engagement \r\nempower caregivers and families with increased \r\nknowledge and enable communities to make informed \r\ndecisions, recognize danger signs and take timely \r\naction. This work would not be possible without the \r\ntireless efforts of the volunteers who consistently carry \r\nout household visits and net distributions. In 2010 \r\nalone, over 18,000 Red Cross and Red Crescent \r\nvolunteers reached more than 6.2 million people with \r\nmalaria messaging. \r\n Community volunteers are able to facilitate \r\nbehavioural change by combining net distributions \r\nwith training, which ensures correct and consistent \r\nprevention practices. Our so-called flagship \r\nprogrammes of “Hang Up” and “Keep Up” campaigns \r\nhave significantly contributed to reducing the \r\nincidence of malaria, especially when reaching the \r\nmost vulnerable groups, such as those living in remote \r\nareas, refugees and people affected by stigma and \r\ndiscrimination. \r\n Good programming is only made better by good \r\ndata. This year, the IFRC piloted the roll-out of a \r\nmanagement survey tool. The tool uses mobile phones \r\nfor data collection and can provide information on \r\nprogress and gaps in project implementation. By using \r\ndata-driven programming, it will be possible to \r\nimprove the implementation of malaria prevention \r\nprogrammes and support progress to be made in the \r\nyears to come. \r\n In order to sustain global and national progress in \r\ncombating malaria, our key message is that \r\ncommunities must own the activities that support the \r\nprevention and treatment of malaria. When \r\ncommunity-based volunteers provide knowledge, \r\nprevention and treatment options, communities are \r\ngenuinely empowered to be the most effective first \r\nresponders to this disease. \r\n Community ownership reinforces positive, \r\nhealthy behaviours and can address barriers to healthy \r\nbehaviour changes. Therefore, to ensure long-term \r\nsustainable results, we underline the importance of \r\nfacilitating malaria prevention from a top-down, scale-\r\nup phase to a bottom-up, community-driven phase. By \r\nfacilitating an enabling environment and strengthening \r\nthe role of communities, we can move closer to \r\nachieving the internationally agreed goals, such as the \r\nhealth-related Millennium Development Goals, the \r\ngoals set out by the Roll Back Malaria Partnership and \r\nA/66/PV.33  \r\n \r\n11-54043 20 \r\n \r\nthose articulated in the Global Strategy for Women’s \r\nand Children’s Health. \r\n The Red Cross and Red Crescent, in partnership, \r\nwill continue to support and improve effective malaria \r\nprevention. We remain committed to building on the \r\nsuccesses gained while keeping malaria high on the \r\nhealth agenda at the global, regional, national and, in \r\nparticular, community levels. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): We \r\nhave heard the last speaker in the debate on the three \r\nagenda items under consideration. I shall now give a \r\nsummary of our meeting.  \r\n We have heard a total of 30 speakers from \r\nMember States, one from an intergovernmental \r\norganization and one from a non-governmental \r\norganization. One after the other, they have thanked the \r\nSecretary-General for his reports, in particular that \r\n(A/66/202) on the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD), which marks the tenth \r\nanniversary of that programme. Member States have \r\nthereby joined together in celebrating the tenth \r\nanniversary of NEPAD by welcoming the progress \r\nachieved and highlighting their commitment to \r\nsupporting this programme and to Africa’s sustainable \r\ndevelopment. Delegations welcomed NEPAD’s \r\nachievements and the crucial role of regional economic \r\ncommunities and of African States themselves in its \r\nimplementation.  \r\n Delegations highlighted the progress achieved at \r\nboth the macroeconomic and sector-specific levels and \r\nthrough democratic good governance and good \r\neconomic practices, as shown through the return to \r\nconstitutional order in various States and the Arab \r\nSpring. Delegations highlighted the potential for \r\ngrowth of the African economy represented by \r\nNEPAD. In this respect, delegations underlined the \r\nexceptional economic growth of the first decade, the \r\nefforts agreed upon and the results achieved in \r\nagriculture through the Comprehensive Africa \r\nAgriculture Development Programme, and in \r\ninfrastructure, women’s independence, human \r\nresources development, education, health care and \r\ninformation and communications technology.  \r\n Delegations welcomed efforts aimed at promoting \r\neconomic and political governance through the African \r\nPeer Review Mechanism as a crucial pillar of \r\nsocio-economic development in Africa. A number of \r\ndelegations recalled that, in spite of the progress \r\nachieved, Africa continues to face persistent \r\nchallenges. Those include the global economic and \r\nfinancial crisis, climate change, the food crisis in the \r\nHorn of Africa, official development assistance, the \r\nweak efforts of development partners to honour their \r\ncommitments and promises, the deadlock in the \r\nmultilateral trade negotiations under the Doha Round, \r\ninfrastructure and agriculture development, and the \r\nproblem of youth unemployment. \r\n To respond to those many challenges, Member \r\nStates recalled the importance of industrial \r\ndevelopment, increased investment in infrastructure \r\nand agriculture development, the mobilization of the \r\ncontinent’s resources, the promotion of South-South \r\ncooperation to complement traditional assistance, the \r\nstrengthening of the capacities of continental and \r\nregional institutions, the promotion of market access, \r\nand development-oriented outcomes in multilateral \r\ntrade negotiations.  \r\n On the subject of assistance, delegations \r\nunderscored the importance not only of honouring \r\nprior commitments but also of going far beyond the \r\nprovision of assistance through a strategy aimed at \r\nreducing the dependence of African countries on aid \r\nand improving development effectiveness. A number of \r\ndelegations also expressed their support for the \r\nimplementation of a strengthened mechanism to follow \r\nup commitments to development in Africa.  \r\n Delegations further emphasized their full \r\ncommitment to continuing to support NEPAD’s efforts \r\ntowards Africa’s development. Delegations welcomed \r\nthe efforts under way within the United Nations \r\nsystem, including those under the Office of the Special \r\nAdviser on Africa, towards NEPAD’s implementation. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n I would like to congratulate all participants for \r\nthe stimulating discussion we have had today. The \r\ndiscussion has illustrated Member States’ strong \r\nsolidarity and good will in supporting African \r\ndevelopment. Many delegations commended the \r\nincreasing cooperation between the African Union and \r\nthe United Nations, which has proven significant in \r\naddressing many of the challenges to peace and \r\nsecurity in Africa. Member States called for a \r\ncomprehensive approach to tackling the interconnected \r\nchallenges of peace and development by addressing the \r\ncauses of conflict, including their socio-economic \r\nimpact. \r\n A/66/PV.33\r\n \r\n21 11-54043 \r\n \r\n Focus on the roll-back of malaria added a special \r\ndimension to our joint debate. Some Members States \r\ncalled for a comprehensive approach to eradicating \r\nmalaria and ensuring funding sustainability in order to \r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals. Malaria \r\nremains a global challenge to be tackled by global \r\nendeavours. \r\n As I conclude this summary, I would like to quote \r\nthe statement delivered by the representative of \r\nGuyana on behalf of the Caribbean Community, in \r\nwhich he noted that:  \r\n “As Africa charts its way forward, the continued \r\nsupport of the international community remains \r\nvital to its success. But that success will not be \r\nAfrica’s alone; the fruits of progress on the \r\ncontinent will inevitably contribute to progress in \r\nother parts of the world” (A/66/PV.32).  \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n The Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 63 and its sub-items (a) \r\nand (b) and agenda item 13.  \r\n  The meeting rose at 5.25 p.m. \r\n"
