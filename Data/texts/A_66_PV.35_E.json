(Qatar) \r\n \r\n \r\n In the absence of the President, Mr. Meetarbhan \r\n(Mauritius), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.  \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 15 (continued) \r\n \r\nCulture of peace \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/66/280) \r\n \r\n  Note by the Secretary-General (A/66/273) \r\n \r\n Mr. Khan (Indonesia): At the outset, allow me to \r\nthank the Secretary-General, on behalf of my \r\ndelegation, for the report on intercultural, interreligious \r\nand intercivilizational dialogue contained in document \r\nA/66/280. Our appreciation also goes to the Director-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations Educational, Scientific \r\nand Cultural Organization for the report on the \r\nimplementation of the Declaration and Programme of \r\nAction on a Culture of Peace, as contained in document \r\nA/66/273. We take note of the recommendations. \r\n We would like to take this opportunity to \r\nwelcome the fourth annual report of United Nations \r\nHigh Representative for the Alliance of Civilizations \r\n(A/66/305). It is encouraging to see the expansion in \r\nthe membership of the Group of Friends of the Alliance \r\nof Civilizations. That said, we welcome the convening \r\nof the Doha Forum in December and stand ready to \r\nhost one of the events in future. \r\n Indonesia has always dedicated itself to \r\npromoting mutual respect for religious and cultural \r\ndiversity. We have keenly supported initiatives that \r\ndeal with the challenges of cultural diversity. Dialogue \r\nand mutual cooperation among faiths and cultures are \r\ninherent to Indonesia’s history. We have had centuries \r\nof practice in fostering tolerance and promoting \r\ncooperation among our immensely varied ethnic \r\ngroups. \r\n We profoundly believe in the wisdom of dialogue \r\nand its efficacy as a cure for ignorance, prejudice and \r\nhatred. As a result, we have been actively involved in \r\ndialogue, particularly interfaith and intercultural \r\ndialogue, at all levels. We have developed a strategy to \r\nempower moderates by actively involving \r\ninterreligious civil society organizations. \r\n At the national level, Government and civil \r\nsociety organizations have been working together on a \r\nnumber of initiatives, including the Forum for \r\nHarmony among Religious Groups. The Forum not \r\nonly conducts dialogues among various religious \r\nleaders and groups, but also actively promotes \r\nreligious harmony through social education campaigns. \r\n At the international level, we have held bilateral \r\ninterfaith dialogues with 16 other countries and the \r\nHoly See. We also launched a regional interfaith \r\ndialogue among South-East Asian and South-West \r\nPacific countries in 2004, as well as the Asia-Europe \r\nMeeting Interfaith Dialogue (ASEM) in 2005. Both \r\nDialogues have become annual events, and in that \r\nregard, we welcome the recent conclusion of the \r\nseventh Association of Southeast Asian Nations \r\n(ASEAN) Interfaith Dialogue, held last week in \r\nManila. \r\nA/66/PV.35  \r\n \r\n11-55082 2 \r\n \r\n Indonesia is of the view that the media plays an \r\ninstrumental role in promoting and nurturing the \r\nculture of dialogue and cooperation among ethnicities, \r\ncultures, religions and civilizations. The mass media \r\nhave the power to excite the masses. They also have \r\nthe capacity to educate and enlighten, to impart \r\nwisdom to public opinion and to mediate public \r\ndialogue that leads to cooperation, peace and mutual \r\nrespect.  \r\n In a democracy, freedom of the press ensures a \r\ndynamic free market of ideas in which prejudice and \r\nbigotry cannot rule. Understanding the strategic role of \r\nthe media, Indonesia worked together with Norway to \r\nfacilitate the Global Inter-Media Dialogue from 2006 \r\nto 2008. The three-year forum produced a network of \r\njournalists from different parts of the world who are \r\ncommitted to continuing to contribute to democratic \r\nlife, emphasizing the core values and ethics of \r\njournalism built upon respect for the truth, \r\nindependence and professional social responsibility. \r\n All of those existing initiatives on interfaith, \r\nintercultural and intercivilizational dialogue have \r\nbecome part of a global network aimed at promoting \r\npeace and harmony. But they would not suffice if they \r\nwere to remain only within conference halls. We must \r\nrecognize that dialogue is not an end in itself. Dialogue \r\nwill amount to nothing if it does not lead to \r\ncooperation at the grass-roots level.  \r\n Finally, Indonesia would like to reiterate its \r\ncommitment to supporting and closely working with \r\ninternational communities to promote interconnected \r\ndialogue initiatives, with a view to fostering a culture \r\nof peace, development and respect for human rights. \r\n Mr. de Séllos (Brazil): Brazil wants to commend \r\nthe continuous efforts of the Secretary-General to \r\npromote intercultural and interreligious dialogue. In \r\nthat regard, Brazil welcomes with great satisfaction \r\nboth documents (A/66/280, A/66/273) presented for \r\nour analysis today under agenda item 15, “Culture of \r\nPeace”. \r\n As a multi-ethnic, multireligious nation, Brazil is \r\nstrongly committed to the principles that inspire and \r\nguide the Alliance of Civilizations initiative. It was a \r\ngreat honour for my country to host in Rio de Janeiro, \r\nin May 2010, the third Forum of the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations. In a celebration of diversity and \r\ninclusiveness, we were honoured to host 109 official \r\ndelegations and more than 7,000 participants, including \r\nrepresentatives of civil society, religious communities, \r\npolitical parties, academia, journalists, the private \r\nsector, youth movements as well as human rights \r\ndefenders. \r\n Despite many relevant efforts, we are confronted \r\ntoday with an increasing danger of division. We note \r\nwith concern and deep regret that violent attacks \r\nagainst religious and ethnic minorities continue to \r\noccur in various regions of the world. Fighting \r\nxenophobia, extremism and racial hatred through \r\neducation aimed at dialogue and tolerance must remain \r\na major priority of the international community. As \r\nPresident Dilma Rousseff stressed in her recent \r\nmessage to the Assembly,  \r\n “Since late 2010, we have witnessed a series of \r\ngrass-roots demonstrations that have come to be \r\nknown as the Arab Spring. Brazil is the adopted \r\nhomeland of many immigrants from that part of \r\nthe world. Brazilians sympathize with the pursuit \r\nof an ideal that belongs to no culture in particular, \r\nbecause it is by definition universal: freedom.” \r\n(A/66/PV.11, p. 8) \r\n Brazil strongly supports the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations initiative and considers it a highly \r\neffective tool of soft power for conflict prevention and \r\nthe promotion of peace and understanding. The Doha \r\nForum to be held in December represents a major \r\nchallenge to the political construction of the Alliance. \r\nAccordingly, the ministerial meeting to be held during \r\nthe Forum is highly anticipated. \r\n Finally, inspired by the youthful and joyful spirit \r\nof the Rio Forum Declaration, Brazil wishes to thank \r\nQatar for the invitation to the Doha Forum and to join \r\nefforts with all Member States in our common task of \r\nachieving significant results at that event. \r\n Mr. Jabessa (Ethiopia): Each year, the General \r\nAssembly considers this agenda item because of its \r\nimportance to the international community, and my \r\ndelegation is always pleased to take part in this plenary \r\nannual debate on the Alliance of Civilizations. \r\n I would like to express my appreciation to the \r\nSecretary-General for his report (A/66/280) on the \r\nagenda item under consideration. My delegation is of \r\nthe view that the report will enable us to be cognizant \r\nand appreciative of the activities of the United Nations \r\nand its affiliated entities with regard to dialogue among \r\ncivilizations, cultures and religions. \r\n A/66/PV.35\r\n \r\n3 11-55082 \r\n \r\n It is to be recalled that the United Nations \r\nMillennium Declaration (resolution 55/2) clearly \r\nindicates that tolerance is one of the fundamental \r\nvalues essential to international relations in the twenty-\r\nfirst century and that it should include the active \r\npromotion of a culture of peace and dialogue among \r\ncivilizations. \r\n The conduct of a dialogue among civilizations is \r\nan extremely valuable and timely issue that is needed \r\nto address, through combined efforts, the major \r\nchallenges of religious intolerance and extremist \r\ntendencies that the world is currently facing. The major \r\nchallenges and opportunities that the nations of the \r\nworld are presented with today include the increasing \r\ndiversity of our cultures, beliefs and values. Today’s \r\nreality is that if we succeed in using our diversity to \r\npromote understanding and tolerance, that will become \r\na source of great opportunities and strength for our \r\nmulticultural, multi-ethnic and multilingual world. If \r\nwe fail to use our diversity to work for the common \r\ngood of our peoples, it will undoubtedly become a \r\nsource of great weakness and challenges. \r\n Recognizing dialogue as a powerful instrument to \r\nfind a global solution to the problems of our world, \r\nwhich is often characterized by intolerance and cultural \r\nand religious divisions, it is indeed gratifying to note \r\nthat the Alliance’s last three consecutive forums have \r\nbeen useful and effective in addressing these key \r\nglobal challenges. In fact, the forums turned out to be \r\nexceptionally useful for the conduct of interactive \r\ndialogues among diverse faiths and beliefs and for the \r\nestablishment of a global partnership aimed at \r\nundertaking collective efforts to tackle the problems of \r\ndiversity and maximize its benefits so as to further \r\npromote an understanding of one another’s cultural and \r\nreligious differences.  \r\n We believe that the Alliance plays a central role \r\nin enabling States to conduct harmonious cross-cultural \r\ndialogues. In that regard, we expect that the fourth \r\nannual Forum of the United Nations Alliance of \r\nCivilizations, which will take place in Doha this \r\nDecember, will make positive contributions to \r\nintercultural dialogue among nations. \r\n Dialogue among different faiths and cultures \r\naimed at maintaining global peace and international \r\nsecurity, and for peaceful coexistence and international \r\nsocial cohesion between and among nations, is indeed \r\ncritical. This is particularly true at a time when \r\nextremists are more than ever determined to exploit \r\ncultural and religious divisions to sow seeds of discord \r\namong nations. These extremist forces must not be \r\nallowed to use xenophobic intolerance to promote \r\nhatred and harmful attitudes among our societies. We \r\nmust engage Governments, civic groups and \r\norganizations to prevent the dissemination of their evil \r\nideas and defeat them through joint concerted actions. \r\n Raising awareness about the danger that their \r\nideas pose to our diverse cultural heritages and \r\ncivilizations is one of best ways to ensure that they will \r\nnot succeed in their efforts to foster clashes among \r\nnations. This can be done through the involvement of a \r\nwide range of stakeholders, States, civil society and \r\norganizations at the national, regional and \r\ninternationals levels, such as faith-based institutions \r\nand media. For this purpose, the Alliance could do \r\nmore facilitation work by adopting a proactive policy \r\naimed at bringing about attitudinal changes through the \r\nconduct of workshops, seminars and other forums for \r\ninteractive dialogues. \r\n Today’s Ethiopia reflects the diverse nature of its \r\npeoples and nationalities, with their distinct cultures, \r\nreligions, linguistic and ethnic characteristics. Ethiopia \r\nis also an ancient land with its own, centuries-old \r\nunique civilizations, traditions and customs. It is \r\nindeed a mosaic society in which peoples of different \r\ncultural, religious and ethnic backgrounds live \r\npeacefully with a strong sense of affinity with one \r\nanother and in unity. This has been a trademark of our \r\ncountry for centuries. Our long history of tolerance and \r\nharmonious coexistence is a reflection of our \r\nuniqueness as a society of diverse faiths and cultures. \r\n Aware of this reality, the Government of Ethiopia \r\nhas taken various measures to further enhance our \r\ndiversity in unity and has encouraged a culture of \r\ntolerance and peaceful coexistence in our society. The \r\nadoption of a federal Constitution that enshrines and \r\nguarantees the basic human rights and the freedom of \r\nEthiopians to pursue any religion or belief of their \r\nchoice without restrictions is the most important and \r\nfundamental step taken in this regard. The fact that our \r\nConstitution clearly stipulates that the Ethiopian State \r\nis a secular one and that Ethiopians are free to practice \r\nany religion of their preference, and that our penal \r\ncode does not allow any behaviour or act harmful to \r\nreligious liberty, underscores the strong commitment of \r\nour Government to further enhancing and nurturing the \r\nvalues of diversity. \r\nA/66/PV.35  \r\n \r\n11-55082 4 \r\n \r\n It is in line with these provisions of the \r\nConstitution and the policy that Ethiopia is pursuing \r\nthat the Government is encouraging the strengthening \r\nof cultural tolerance and peaceful coexistence in \r\nsociety through various means, including teachings in \r\nschools and the media at the local and national levels. \r\nMoreover, the Government has created an environment \r\nfor religious institutions, civic groups and the people at \r\nlarge that is conducive to conducting interactive \r\ndialogues, on a sustainable basis, to further promote \r\ntolerance and address challenges related to religious \r\nand cultural misunderstandings. This is indeed a \r\nfundamental departure from past ways of thinking and \r\npractices in our country. \r\n Ethiopia has contributed actively to the efforts of \r\nthe Alliance to promote interfaith and intercultural \r\ndialogue, as we believe that it is necessary to prevent \r\nterrorists and extremists from using religious \r\nintolerance and cultural differences to achieve their \r\nevil objectives. We therefore remain committed to the \r\nAlliance, which offers us the best forum of a universal \r\ncharacter that brings together all nations to make a \r\nmeaningful impact on the ground. \r\n In conclusion, let me assure the Assembly of \r\nEthiopia’s strong commitment to work together to \r\nensure the continued successful work of the Alliance. \r\n Mr. Meek (United States of America): The \r\nUnited States is grateful for the opportunity to speak on \r\nthis important agenda item dealing with the culture of \r\npeace. The United States supports efforts around the \r\nworld that create a forum for people with different \r\nviews to express themselves through dialogue. That is \r\nwhy we support initiatives like last year’s resolution \r\n65/5, on World Interfaith Harmony Week, introduced \r\nby Jordan.  \r\n It is also why we joined the consensus in March \r\nat the Human Rights Council on its important \r\nresolution that addressed combating intolerance, \r\nnegative stereotyping and the stigmatization of, and \r\ndiscrimination, incitement to violence, and violence \r\nagainst, persons based on religion or belief \r\n(A/HRC/RES/16/18). That resolution signals an \r\nimportant turning point in the effort to address the use \r\nof collaboration to deal with the problem and we look \r\nforward to continuing our engagement with all \r\ncountries on that issue. \r\n The United States believes that peace can be \r\nachieved when people come together to understand, \r\naccept one another and shun the violence and hatred \r\nborn of intolerance. Fostering mutual understanding \r\nand an inclusive social environment, in which the \r\nrights of all individuals, irrespective of religion or \r\ncultural background, are protected, provides the \r\ncornerstone for trust and lasting peace. The United \r\nStates confirms unequivocally that freedom of \r\nexpression and open dialogue among members of \r\ndifferent religions and cultures are critical to \r\ncombating intolerance and to promoting peaceful \r\ncoexistence.  \r\n We hope that all Member States and relevant \r\nstakeholders throughout the world will contribute to \r\nstrengthening the foundation of tolerance and respect \r\nfor diversity and enhance the promotion and protection \r\nof human rights and fundamental freedoms around the \r\nworld. \r\n Mr. Cabactulan (Philippines): I would like to \r\ntake this opportunity to express my delegation’s \r\nwillingness and commitment to work with the \r\nAssembly and its President to advance the good work \r\nof the Organization on the most important matter of a \r\nculture of peace. \r\n We all desire a world of peace and cooperation. \r\nOut of the horrors of two World Wars, we resolved to \r\nwork closely together to rid the world of the threats of \r\nviolence and destruction and to further strengthen the \r\nfoundations of a just and equitable international order. \r\nYet despite the advancements that we have made, we \r\ncontinue to face tremendous challenges. Despite our \r\nefforts to bring nations and peoples closer together in \r\ngreater understanding, mutual respect and tolerance, \r\ndark elements continue to threaten to pull apart nations \r\nand individuals, feeding on rancour and resentment, \r\ninflicting pain and suffering and forcing violence and \r\nfear upon our world. \r\n We must continue to be vigilant against those \r\nwho seek to rend us apart. For 10 years, since 9/11, \r\neven as our memories continue to be haunted by the \r\nhorrors of that act — which made victims of us all — \r\nwe realize that those dark elements continue to linger. \r\nThe hatred continues to fester. Its insidious form \r\ncontinues to mutate. \r\n It is regrettable that our people have to endure \r\nviolence in its many malevolent forms. Peoples are \r\nbroken further apart by those who seek to sow \r\nconfusion, doubt and suspicion and by those who prey \r\non the disenfranchised and the marginalized and \r\n A/66/PV.35\r\n \r\n5 11-55082 \r\n \r\nsurreptitiously use the faith of others, their culture and \r\ntheir religion, to push for and justify their own dark \r\nagenda. The Philippines joins other nations in \r\ncondemning such acts in all their forms and \r\nmanifestations. The Philippines likewise asserts that \r\nsuch acts should not be associated in any way with any \r\nculture, faith or religion. \r\n For the Philippines — and indeed for the rest of \r\nthe world — faith, culture and religion rightly give \r\nmillions of people hope in this world, the will to treat \r\nothers as they treat themselves and the impetus to work \r\nwith others towards a more inclusive and more \r\nunderstanding world. It is that abiding belief that has \r\nmoved us to try to help harness the world community’s \r\ncollective strength to further strengthen the foundations \r\nof a world respectful of humankind’s diversity. \r\n In that regard, the Philippines welcomes the \r\nreport of the Secretary-General on intercultural, \r\ninterreligious and intercivilizational dialogue \r\n(A/66/280) and the note by the Secretary-General \r\ntransmitting the UNESCO report on the implementation of \r\nthe Declaration and Programme of Action on a Culture \r\nof Peace (A/66/273). The report discusses, in a \r\ncomprehensive and detailed manner, the efforts made \r\nto push the peace agenda into the place where it \r\nmatters most: in the hearts and minds of people. The \r\nreport likewise outlines the challenges we must address \r\nas we seek to build on the good work already being \r\ndone. \r\n The Philippines notes that the report underscores \r\nthe cross-cutting nature of the work being done to \r\nfoster a culture of peace and emphasizes the growing \r\ninvolvement of an ever-widening group of stakeholders \r\namong Member States and those within and outside the \r\nUnited Nations system, including civil society \r\norganizations, to accomplish our shared objectives. \r\n The proclamation of 2010 as the International \r\nYear for the Rapprochement of Cultures serves to \r\nunderscore the need to sustain our efforts in fostering \r\ndialogue. Included are our efforts, among other things, \r\nto provide greater opportunities for research, meetings, \r\npublic debates and the like, promote the role of \r\ncreativity and innovation in sending an effective \r\nmessage for intercultural and interreligious dialogue \r\nacross many platforms, improve access to formal and \r\nnon-formal education with emphasis on quality \r\neducation for all and acknowledge the contributions of \r\nthe media and of new information and communications \r\ntechnology to changing perceptions of different \r\ncultures and religions. \r\n The International Year of Rapprochement of \r\nCultures also made possible partnerships in about \r\n1,000 projects that succeeded in achieving the key \r\nglobal objectives of the Year. That success highlights \r\nthe importance of partnerships and the need to replicate \r\nour efforts at the grassroots level, where they matter \r\nmost. The Philippines welcomes the conclusion that \r\nemerges from these activities:  \r\n “[I]n the new international landscape, greater \r\naccount must be taken of the linkages among \r\ncultural diversity, dialogue, development, security \r\nand peace.” (A/66/273, annex, para. 42) \r\n That was one of the main elements in the \r\nPhilippines-sponsored resolution 65/138, on \r\ninterreligious and intercultural dialogue, last year, \r\nwhich called for Member States to use, as appropriate \r\nand where applicable, interreligious and intercultural \r\ndialogue as an important tool in efforts aimed at \r\nachieving peace and the full realization of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. We stand ready to \r\nwork with other stakeholders to give life to, and further \r\nbuild on, that resolution.  \r\n We thank Pakistan, the principal sponsor, as well \r\nas the core group of sponsors and the nearly 50 other \r\nsponsors for their sustained partnership. Looking back \r\non the years of work that have gone into that resolution \r\nand previous resolutions on interreligious and \r\nintercultural dialogue, we can see how Member States \r\nwith diverse cultures, beliefs, religions and faiths have \r\nbeen able to transcend differences to work on the \r\ncommon objective of fostering a culture of peace. This \r\nis a living lesson in dialogue that the Organization \r\nshould rightly be proud of, a living lesson that the \r\nPhilippines and other partners are striving to replicate \r\nin our respective countries and regions.  \r\n The Philippines supports the findings in the \r\nSecretary-General’s report, which states that the urgent \r\nneed for linkages at the global, regional and local \r\nlevels to promote such vital but fragile dialogue must \r\nbe stressed. Even before this finding was laid out in \r\nthis report, the Philippines had already been working at \r\nthe international and regional levels to broaden \r\nreligious and intercultural dialogue, most recently in \r\nthe Special Non-Aligned Movement Ministerial \r\nMeeting on Interfaith Dialogue and Cooperation for \r\nPeace and Development, held in Manila in 2010 — the \r\nA/66/PV.35  \r\n \r\n11-55082 6 \r\n \r\nlargest intergovernmental gathering convened to \r\ndiscuss ways to promote interfaith dialogue.  \r\n As I speak, the Philippines is continuing to do its \r\npart in encouraging this dialogue. This month the \r\nPhilippines co-hosted, along with Finland and the \r\nEuropean Union, the seventh Interfaith Dialogue of the \r\nEurope-Asia Meeting (ASEM) in Manila with the \r\ntheme “Harnessing the benefits and addressing the \r\nchallenges of migration to interfaith and intercultural \r\ndialogue”. \r\n As contained in its Manila Statement, the seventh \r\nASEM Interfaith Dialogue discussed ways to promote \r\nmutual understanding, tolerance and respect for \r\ndiversity of cultures and for freedom of religion and \r\nbeliefs in the context of increased mobility and people-\r\nto-people interaction. Those and other activities are \r\npositive contributions related to the recommendation in \r\nthe report of the Director-General of UNESCO \r\nencouraging Member States to create links among \r\norganizations that are active in promoting intercultural \r\ndialogue and that are committed to fostering \r\nsustainable development and peace in order to create a \r\nnew dynamic for living peacefully together. \r\n The Philippines also appreciates the continuing \r\nwork of the Alliance of Civilizations in promoting \r\ninterfaith dialogue. The meeting in Doha will be an \r\nimportant opportunity to take stock of current efforts \r\nand to learn from the experiences of the participants. \r\n In this regard too, the Philippines welcomes the \r\ndevelopment by UNESCO of an intersectoral and \r\ninterdisciplinary Programme of Action for a Culture of \r\nPeace and Non-Violence, which the organization is \r\nexpected to adopt at the thirty-sixth session of its \r\nGeneral Conference this year. \r\n The Philippines notes the activities undertaken by \r\nthe United Nations system to promote intercultural \r\ndialogue. UNESCO and the United Nations \r\nSecretariat’s Department of Economic and Social \r\nAffairs in particular have been working with \r\nstakeholders like the Philippines on providing \r\nopportunities to draw in civil society members such as \r\nreligious non-governmental organizations to foster and \r\ndevelop ideas on how to move the agenda of a culture \r\nof peace further forward. \r\n The Philippines would also like to underscore the \r\nimportant role the Secretariat’s Department of Public \r\nInformation can play in effectively and efficiently \r\nsending a message of peace and dialogue by reaching a \r\nbroader sector across many platforms and at many \r\npoints through the use of information and \r\ncommunications technology. \r\n The Philippines likewise welcomes the rights-\r\nbased approach to the dialogue among cultures and \r\ncivilizations. Indeed, only within the context of human \r\nrights and a legal framework can we hope to further \r\nstrengthen our efforts for greater understanding and \r\nmutual respect. \r\n Before concluding, allow me once again to \r\nreaffirm the commitment of the Philippines to work \r\nwith the President and other stakeholders to further \r\nadvance the work we have done so far. Indeed, the road \r\nahead and the journey forward remain long. However, \r\nwe are confident that we will reach our destination. \r\nFully resolved to turn our vision into reality, we will \r\nforge ahead undeterred, learning from each other, \r\nunderstanding from one another and respecting the \r\nother as we respect ourselves. \r\n Mr. Apakan (Turkey): Turkey welcomes the \r\nreport of the Secretary-General on the culture of peace \r\n(A/66/280). I would like to extend our sincere gratitude \r\nto Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his personal \r\nengagement in this very important matter. \r\n As a sponsor of the Alliance of Civilizations, we \r\nare particularly pleased to observe an increasing \r\nnumber of educational and awareness-raising activities \r\nto promote intercultural and interreligious dialogue. \r\nWe believe that cultural diversity is an integral part of \r\nthe common heritage of humanity and an asset for the \r\nadvancement of humankind. We should therefore \r\naccept differences, fight ignorance and prejudice, \r\nidentify commonalities, respect others and encourage \r\ndialogue at every level. \r\n To that end, we have been actively engaged in the \r\nactivities carried out in the framework of the \r\nInternational Year for the Rapprochement of Cultures. \r\nThese activities aim at improving global understanding \r\nby using various tools such as social media, education, \r\nresearch and new technologies. In this context, we \r\nwant to recognize the important role played by \r\nUNESCO in the celebration of this Year and in the \r\npromotion of intercultural and interreligious dialogue. \r\n We believe that the Alliance of Civilizations \r\ninitiative, which we launched together with Spain, is \r\nnow a truly global peace initiative aimed at breaking \r\n A/66/PV.35\r\n \r\n7 11-55082 \r\n \r\ndown walls of misperception, connecting people and \r\nbuilding bridges towards peaceful cohabitation. We are \r\npleased to see that a growing number of Member States \r\nembrace and act upon the ideals of the Alliance. Such \r\nwide recognition and support make us all the more \r\nhopeful for the future, as only the commitment of \r\nMember States to the ideals of cultural diversity can \r\ncarry the Alliance of Civilizations agenda forward. \r\n The fourth Forum of the Alliance, which will take \r\nplace in Doha from 11 to 13 December, will be an \r\nimportant opportunity to reinforce commitments for \r\naction and to develop new strategies for an inclusive \r\nand open intercultural dialogue. We welcome Sheikha \r\nMozah’s suggestion to create synergies between the \r\nobjectives of the Alliance and the advancement of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. Let us not forget that \r\neventually human development, security and peace are \r\nindivisible and are vital for our progress. We are \r\ntherefore looking forward to actively contributing to \r\nthe Doha Forum. \r\n Finally, let me express our sincere belief that our \r\ncontinued efforts in this direction will produce a more \r\ntolerant and peaceful world for future generations. \r\n Mr. Butt (Pakistan): While the world continues \r\nto witness violence and confrontation caused by \r\nlongstanding political and territorial disputes, and the \r\nsuffering they produce, new obstacles to peace have \r\nemerged in the shape of divisive policies or ideologies \r\nand resort to violent means, including terrorism. \r\nEconomic suffering caused by the continuing global \r\nfinancial crisis has further shrunk the space for \r\naccommodation and understanding among peoples.  \r\n In the face of such discord and division, today’s \r\nagenda item is a reminder of the importance of \r\nmaintaining a culture of peace, which was the \r\nmotivation behind the establishment of this very \r\nOrganization, the United Nations. The Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations enunciated the principles of practicing \r\ntolerance and living together in peace with one another \r\nas good neighbours, uniting our strength to maintain \r\ninternational peace and security, and promoting social \r\nprogress and better standards of life in larger freedom. \r\n All religions and cultures share a common set of \r\nuniversal values: peace, tolerance and equality. Sharing \r\nand respect for humanity is the core message of all \r\nreligions. Religion and culture must therefore not be \r\nallowed to become a source of division. We must \r\ncherish the unity and indivisibility of the human race \r\nand all humankind, no matter what religion or \r\nparticular culture we belong to. \r\n Unfortunately, though, there remain those in this \r\nworld who thrive on chaos; they seek to draw power by \r\npitting thought against thought, fate against fate, and \r\npeople against people. Hate speech against religions \r\nare rampant. This only incites violence. Pakistan \r\nrejects such divisive policies, trends and practices and \r\nhas joined with all efforts and forums aimed at uniting \r\nus as one human race, sharing a common set of values \r\nthat promote the universal application of all human \r\nrights for all, in a non-discriminatory and non-selective \r\nmanner. \r\n The world must stand together to decry those who \r\nwould use religion to advance a rigid and extremist \r\npolitical agenda. We must use religion as a bridge, \r\nbringing nations together, not as a wall keeping them \r\napart. It is therefore critical that we undertake the task \r\nof building on faith as a means of finding common \r\nground between different nations and civilizations. It \r\nwas this very principle that motivated Pakistan and the \r\nPhilippines to jointly sponsor the original resolution on \r\nthe promotion of interreligious and intercultural \r\ndialogue, understanding and cooperation for peace \r\n(resolution 58/128). As in the past, the draft resolution \r\nwill be presented again this year, and we are confident \r\nthat, as at previous sessions, it will be endorsed \r\nunanimously by the General Assembly. This draft \r\nresolution stresses the need for promoting \r\ninterreligious dialogue starting with the grassroots \r\nlevel, in order to address the unfounded misperceptions \r\nthat result in divisiveness, intolerance and violence. \r\n We are happy to note that this was also one of the \r\nimportant conclusions that emerged from the range of \r\nactivities organized during the International Year for \r\nthe Rapprochement of Cultures. In an effort to promote \r\nthis noble cause, Pakistan, together with the \r\nPhilippines, also sponsored the seventh Asia-Europe \r\nMeeting Interfaith Dialogue in Manila this month, \r\nwhich again helped to highlight the ongoing challenges \r\nand the need to address them through enhanced \r\ninterfaith and intercultural dialogue. We also welcome \r\nthe report of the Secretary-General on the subject \r\n(A/66/280), which appropriately highlights the \r\nimportant and cross-cutting nature of the work aimed \r\nat fostering a culture of peace, and the efforts made in \r\nthat regard by a wide range of stakeholders, including \r\ncivil society. \r\nA/66/PV.35  \r\n \r\n11-55082 8 \r\n \r\n Pakistan fully recognizes the need for promoting \r\nreligious and cultural harmony, and has taken several \r\nimportant steps to enhance initiatives to that end. There \r\nare interfaith committees at the national and district \r\nlevels with representatives of all religions, in order to \r\npromote greater understanding, peace and harmony \r\namong followers of different religions. We have also \r\ncreated the Shaheed Benazir Bhutto Foundation \r\nexpressly to promote and encourage dialogue, \r\ninclusion and exchange within our society. \r\n Promoting a culture of peace and avoiding \r\nconflict is not an easy task. It can only be achieved \r\nthrough understanding, sharing, sacrifice and dialogue \r\namong the parties concerned. The challenge we face \r\nevery day is to replace fear with acceptance, \r\nharassment with tolerance and hatred with respect and \r\nunderstanding. Cooperation, and not the clash of \r\ncivilizations, must be the paradigm of our collective \r\nefforts. To make the world a better place for our \r\nchildren, we all share the responsibility to highlight \r\nand propagate our common values of peace, tolerance, \r\nequality, sharing and respect for humankind. We should \r\nencourage the next generation, those who will lead \r\nafter us, not only to use education and exchange to \r\nadapt to modernity, but also to use modernity and \r\ntechnology to change the world into a better and more \r\npeaceful place for all. \r\n Mr. Tommo Monthe (Cameroon) (spoke in \r\nFrench): Concerning agenda item 15, entitled “Culture \r\nof peace”, the Secretary-General’s report (A/66/280) \r\nand note (A/66/273), which have been submitted for \r\nour consideration, praise dialogue between cultures, \r\nreligions and civilizations. They provide an overview \r\nof the measures carried out within the framework of a \r\nprogramme of action for a culture of peace, namely, \r\nthrough education, sustainable economic and social \r\ndevelopment, respect for human rights, participation in \r\ndemocracy, understanding and tolerance, and \r\ninternational peace and security. \r\n In the light of the criteria and recommendations \r\ncontained in the report and the note, my delegation \r\nwould like to add to this debate by sharing the \r\nexperience of my own country, Cameroon. A country \r\nthat has been called “Africa in miniature”, owing to its \r\ngeopolitical, geographic, human, religious and cultural \r\ndiversity, Cameroon has always proclaimed and \r\ndemonstrated its commitment to peace, both within and \r\nbeyond its borders. \r\n First, on peace within our borders: Cameroon’s \r\nmotto is “Peace, work, country”. As is clear, the word \r\n“peace” is one of the elements of the trio; that is, the \r\nrole, the importance and commitment to peace that \r\nhave sustained our people and its leaders from the \r\nfoundation of our State. It is this mystique of peace \r\nthat since then has left an indelible mark on our \r\nnational makeup in all its forms. \r\n From a political standpoint, that mystique can be \r\nseen in our patient promotion and consolidation of an \r\nopen political pluralism, with many political parties \r\nthat cover the full ideological spectrum of modern \r\npolitical life. The party in power works unceasingly for \r\npeace, unity and development. The presidential \r\nelection held on 9 October was another illustration of \r\nthis, taking place in a peaceful atmosphere that was \r\ncommended by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon the \r\nnext day in a press statement conveyed by his \r\nSpokesperson. The same can be said of other observers \r\npresent at the election. \r\n Their Holinesses Popes John Paul II and Benedict \r\nXVI, who both visited our country, twice in the case of \r\nthe former, delivered ringing tributes to our \r\nGovernment for the efforts to build peace in our \r\ncountry. In general, from the political standpoint, those \r\nwho know Cameroon well will notice that peace, \r\ntolerance and respect for diversity can be seen through \r\nthe various individuals who head our principal \r\nconstitutional and public bodies, a set of attitudes \r\ndesigned to preserve and promote peace among the \r\nvarious elements that make up our nation. \r\n With regard to languages, the equality of the two \r\nofficial languages, French and English, as well as that \r\nof all the national languages, is guaranteed by the \r\nConstitution. It can be seen on a daily basis through an \r\nequal use of the two official languages in official \r\nrecords of the Republic, in the State media and in \r\neducation.  \r\n In terms of economic development and land \r\nmanagement, the State has been striving to invest in \r\ninfrastructure in the different regions of our national \r\nterritory according to their potential, which is quite \r\nvaried because of a very diverse geography, which goes \r\nfrom the Atlantic coast through the equatorial forest to \r\nthe Sahel.  \r\n Freedom of worship and religion is a right \r\nguaranteed by the Constitution. Cameroon is a country \r\nwhere we find side by side, in tolerance and mutual \r\n A/66/PV.35\r\n \r\n9 11-55082 \r\n \r\nunderstanding, monotheistic religions such as Islam \r\nand Christianity, atheistic spirituality and, of course, \r\nAfrican religions, which form our shared spiritual \r\nfoundation.  \r\n That is what I can say about our commitment to \r\npeace in respect for diversity within our borders.  \r\n Now, let us look outside our borders. Two \r\nprimary principles, among several, guide Cameroon’s \r\nforeign policy, and this is in accordance with the \r\nConstitution and the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nThe first principle is that of a policy of good-\r\nneighbourliness and peaceful coexistence. The second \r\nis that of peaceful settlement of disputes. \r\n With respect to the first principle, Cameroon \r\nshares its borders with Nigeria, Chad, the Central \r\nAfrican Republic, the Congo, Gabon and Equatorial \r\nGuinea. Cameroon has excellent neighbourly relations \r\nwith all of these countries. In case of a dispute, as was \r\nthe situation at one point with Nigeria concerning the \r\nBakassi peninsula, our country prefers peaceful \r\nsettlement and mediation — the peaceful settlement by \r\njurisdictional means, in this case the acceptance of the \r\noptional clause of the mandatory jurisdiction of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice. That led to the Court’s \r\ndecision in October 2002 and to mediation by the \r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations and friendly \r\ncountries for the implementation of the decision. \r\n That is how my country is striving to preserve \r\ndomestic and foreign peace within a political, cultural, \r\nlinguistically and religiously diverse context. My \r\ndelegation is pleased that this option, chosen by the \r\nsenior officials in my country, is on the same \r\nwavelength as the principles, values, objectives and \r\nactions of the United Nations, and in this particular \r\ncase with the conclusions of the reports of the \r\nSecretary-General and the Director-General of \r\nUNESCO, which have been submitted for our \r\nconsideration today. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to the \r\nobserver of the Holy See.  \r\n Archbishop Chullikatt (Holy See): As the \r\nGeneral Assembly once again takes up this agenda \r\nitem, my delegation draws attention to the critical role \r\nthat the United Nations plays in the promotion and \r\nstrengthening of a culture of peace throughout the \r\nworld.  \r\n As the Declaration on a Culture of Peace \r\n(resolution 53/243) affirmed, such a culture must be \r\nbased on respect for life, ending of violence and the \r\npromotion and practice of non-violence through \r\neducation, dialogue and cooperation. The fuller \r\ndevelopment of a culture of peace is integrally linked \r\nto advancing understanding, tolerance and solidarity \r\namong all civilizations, peoples and cultures, including \r\nwith regard to ethnic, religious and linguistic \r\nminorities. This is as important now as it was when the \r\nDeclaration was proclaimed, for Governments have a \r\nresponsibility to respect and protect all persons, to \r\nfoster peace and to promote education, dialogue and \r\ncooperation for the building of a society marked by \r\nharmonious coexistence. \r\n During the general debate of the sixty-sixth \r\nsession, my delegation affirmed that respect for \r\nreligious liberty is the fundamental path for \r\npeacebuilding, the recognition of human dignity and \r\nthe safeguarding of the rights of the human person. \r\nUnfortunately, today there are numerous situations in \r\nwhich the right of religious liberty is injured or denied, \r\nespecially for believers of different religions. There is \r\nan increase in religiously motivated intolerance, and, \r\nunfortunately, one sees that Christians in various parts \r\nof the world are increasingly subjected to \r\ndiscrimination and violence because of their faith, \r\nincluding the recent tragic incidents in Egypt. \r\n The lack of respect for religious freedom is a \r\nthreat to security and peace and impedes the realization \r\nof authentic, integral human development. The \r\nparticular influence of a specific religion in a nation \r\nshould never imply that citizens belonging to other \r\nconfessions are discriminated against in social life or, \r\nworse still, that violence against them is tolerated. \r\n In that connection, a common commitment to \r\nrecognizing and promoting the religious liberty of \r\nevery person and every community is favoured by \r\nsincere interreligious dialogue. Governments and \r\ninternational agencies are called on to support such \r\nwork among individuals and communities. Effective \r\nmeasures must be adopted for the protection of all \r\nreligious minorities wherever they are threatened, in \r\norder that, above all, believers of all confessions can \r\nlive in security and continue to make their contribution \r\nto the society of which they are members. \r\n Unfortunately, there are also countries in the \r\nworld today, especially some so-called developed \r\nA/66/PV.35  \r\n \r\n11-55082 10 \r\n \r\ncountries, in which, although great importance is given \r\nto pluralism and tolerance, religion tends paradoxically \r\nto be considered as a factor foreign or destabilizing to \r\nmodern society, in which different means are sought to \r\nmarginalize religion and impede it from influencing \r\nsocial life. \r\n Yet it is an undeniable fact that the great religions \r\nof the world have made a significant contribution to the \r\ndevelopment of civilization, as the sincere search for \r\nGod has led to greater respect for the dignity of the \r\nhuman person. Christian communities, with their \r\npatrimonies of values and principles, have contributed \r\nstrongly to individuals’ and peoples’ awareness of their \r\nidentity and dignity, as well as to the triumph of the \r\ninstitutions of the rule of law and to the affirmation of \r\nthe rights of the human person and of his or her \r\ncorresponding duties. From that perspective, it is \r\nimportant that believers feel as free today as yesterday \r\nto offer their contribution to the promotion of the just \r\nregulation of human realities, both through responsible \r\ncommitments at the civil, economic and political level \r\nand through the witness of their charity and faith. \r\n My delegation is aware of the many activities \r\ncarried out by the main United Nations entities in the \r\nfield of dialogue. In that regard, it is essential that the \r\nactivities carried out by those actors truly support \r\ncultures and religions in building a culture of peace. \r\nThat means fully respecting the various religious and \r\nethical values and cultural backgrounds of people in \r\nconformity with universally recognized human rights. \r\n The principles upon which the Organization was \r\nfounded are a constant reminder for all States to \r\ncommit themselves to bringing an end to all conflicts \r\nand building peaceful coexistence among all peoples. \r\nThat requires Governments to work to protect all of \r\ntheir citizens and promote mutual understanding. The \r\nmore that Governments are able to do this, the more \r\nthey will able to achieve their purpose, namely, the \r\npromotion of the common good, which necessarily \r\nentails recognition, respect, defence and promotion of \r\nthe rights of all persons. \r\n The Acting President: In accordance with \r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 49/2, of 19 October 1994, \r\nI now call on the observer for the International \r\nFederation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. \r\n Mr. Lobry-Boulanger (International Federation \r\nof Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies): On the heels \r\nof the International Day of Non-Violence and \r\nfollowing the theme of this year’s general debate — \r\n“The role of mediation in the settlement of disputes by \r\npeaceful means” — the International Federation of Red \r\nCross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) welcomes \r\nthis timely debate on a culture of peace. The IFRC \r\nfurther welcomes the reports of the Secretary-General \r\n(A/66/280) and of the Director-General of UNESCO \r\n(see A/66/273) on this agenda item, and the progress \r\ndescribed in them. \r\n The IFRC is strongly committed to fostering a \r\nglobal culture of respect for diversity, non-violence and \r\npeace, intercultural dialogue and social inclusion where \r\nhuman values and dignity are truly celebrated. Indeed, \r\npromoting social inclusion and a culture of \r\nnon-violence and peace is one of the IFRC’s three \r\norganizational priorities for the present decade.  \r\n Based on the extensive experience of our 186 \r\nNational Societies at the community level, today I \r\nwould like to touch on the role of values and skills-\r\nbased education, the importance of engaging and \r\nempowering youth and the promotion of non-violence. \r\n We all carry biases and prejudice from our \r\nupbringing, schooling, media and other influences. \r\nAddressing violent expressions such as discrimination \r\nand exclusion requires a change of mindsets, attitudes \r\nand behaviours at the level of the individual and an \r\nenabling environment for that change to happen. One \r\nplace to start is reinforcement of the role of education, \r\nboth formal and informal, in the promotion of a culture \r\nof non-violence and peace, not only in schools but in a \r\nvariety of settings such as family, sports and social \r\nactivities. \r\n In his report on current global and national trends \r\nand challenges and their impact on education, the \r\nSecretary-General states that “Schools should be seen \r\nfirst and foremost as places for imparting the most vital \r\nskills: tolerance, mutual respect and the ability to live \r\npeacefully with others” (E/2011/82, para. 79). The \r\nIFRC supports that view and believes that schools, \r\nalong with other settings, present opportunities for us \r\nto learn values such as respect for diversity, mutual \r\nunderstanding, compassion and cooperation, and to \r\ndevelop skills like empathy, non-violent \r\ncommunication and peaceful resolution of tensions. In \r\nshort, a values and skills-based education is vital to \r\ntransforming the ways we relate to each other. \r\n Youth as Agents of Behavioural Change — \r\nYABC — is a flagship initiative of the IFRC that \r\n A/66/PV.35\r\n \r\n11 11-55082 \r\n \r\nplaces youth at the centre of efforts to promote a \r\nculture of non-violence and peace through informal \r\nvalues and skills-based peer education. The initiative \r\nwas created for youth and with youth in the Red Cross \r\nRed Crescent worldwide and empowers them to \r\nassume a leadership role in transforming their local \r\ncommunities. The YABC initiative uses a \r\nnon-cognitive methodology, peer education and \r\ninnovative platforms such as games, role-playing, \r\nvisualization, drama, dance, arts, relaxation and \r\nmovement. It has been met by great appreciation of \r\nboth youth and parents.  \r\n Teachers have also welcomed the YABC \r\nmethodology within formal education systems. For \r\nexample, the French Red Cross, which partners with its \r\nGovernment in providing humanitarian values \r\neducation in schools, has begun utilizing the YABC \r\nmethodology in its work, with great success. The IFRC \r\nencourages the institutionalization of values and skills-\r\nbased education in formal school curricula at the \r\nnational level, starting in primary and pre-school \r\nlevels, as well as its inclusion in informal education. \r\n In the face of levels of violence that affect all \r\ncontinents, countries and communities, a values and \r\nskills-based education can help us address the \r\nunderlying causes, especially when coupled with \r\ninitiatives that foster social inclusion and respect for \r\ndiversity and that build resilience against violence. Our \r\ngoal must be to promote a culture where violence is \r\nnever an option. Since violence risk factors exist at \r\nmultiple levels — individual, family, community, \r\nsocial and cultural — it is possible to work in each \r\nlevel and thus enhance resilience. In other words, we \r\ncan build individual or community capacity to adapt to \r\nand remain strong in the face of adversity. \r\n Concretely, communities that invest in \r\nprogrammes that proactively prevent stigma, gender \r\ninequality and abuse, among many other activities and \r\nthat empower vulnerable groups of people will become \r\nstronger and less prone to violence. It is important to \r\ntarget youth and communities most at risk. For \r\nexample, our member National Societies in the Central \r\nAmerican and Caribbean region are addressing youth at \r\nrisk of exclusion in 11 urban and suburban areas by \r\nincreasing their social and institutional skills through \r\nthe Regional Strategy on Violence Prevention project. \r\nAnother example is the Soccer Against Violence \r\nproject of the South African Red Cross, which \r\ninculcates values such as tolerance, self-discipline and \r\npersonal development in youth at risk — youth who \r\nface high levels of violence, intolerance and social \r\ncrimes, among other factors. \r\n Given that differences of opinion and \r\ndisagreements are a normal part of humanity, the real \r\nquestion is: how can we deal with them in a \r\nconstructive way? Pursuing values and skills-based \r\neducation, empowering youth and investing in violence \r\nprevention are all concrete actions we can take to help \r\ntransform mindsets, attitudes and behaviours. In all \r\ncorners of the world, communities today face \r\nchallenges that require creative and constructive \r\nsolutions that foster a culture of peace. \r\n The Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on agenda item 15. The General \r\nAssembly has thus concluded this stage of its \r\nconsideration of item 15. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 7 (continued) \r\n \r\nOrganization of work, adoption of the agenda and \r\nallocation of items \r\n \r\n  Request for the inclusion of an additional \r\nsub-item submitted by the Secretary-General \r\n(A/66/231) \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The General Assembly \r\nwill now take up a request submitted by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in document A/66/231 relating to the \r\nmembership of the United Nations Staff Pension \r\nCommittee. In his note, the Secretary-General informs \r\nthe Assembly of the resignation of Andrei Kovalenko \r\nfrom the membership of the Staff Pension Committee \r\neffective 19 September. A vacancy in the Committee \r\ntherefore occurred on that date. \r\n As the agenda of the sixty-sixth session of the \r\nAssembly does not contain a sub-item on the \r\nappointment of members of the United Nations Staff \r\nPension Committee, the Secretary-General has \r\ntherefore deemed it necessary to request, pursuant to \r\nrule 15 of the rules of procedure of the General \r\nAssembly, the inclusion in the agenda of the current \r\nsession of an additional sub-item entitled \r\n“Appointment of members and alternate members of \r\nthe United Nations Staff Pension Committee”, under \r\nagenda item 115, “Appointments to fill vacancies in \r\nsubsidiary organs and other appointments”. \r\n Owing to the nature of the item, unless there is an \r\nobjection, may I take it that the General Assembly \r\nA/66/PV.35  \r\n \r\n11-55082 12 \r\n \r\nagrees that the relevant provision of rule 40 of the rules \r\nof procedure, which would require a meeting of the \r\nGeneral Committee on the question of the inclusion of \r\nthis additional sub-item on the agenda, could be \r\nwaived?  \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The Acting President: May I take it that the \r\nGeneral Assembly, on the proposal of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, wishes to include in the agenda of the current \r\nsession an additional sub-item entitled “Appointment \r\nof members and alternate members of the United \r\nNations Staff Pension Committee” as a sub-item of \r\nagenda item 115 under Heading I, “Organizational, \r\nadministrative and other matters”? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The Acting President: The Secretary-General \r\nhas requested that the sub-item be allocated to the Fifth \r\nCommittee. May I take it that it is the wish of the \r\nAssembly to allocate this sub-item to the Fifth \r\nCommittee? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The Acting President: I should like to inform \r\nembers that this additional sub-item becomes sub-item \r\n(k) of agenda item 115 on the agenda of the current \r\nsession. \r\n \r\n  Documentation for the election of the members \r\nof the International Law Commission \r\n \r\n The Acting President: I would now like to \r\nconsult the General Assembly on a matter concerning \r\nsub-item (b) of agenda item 114, “Election of the \r\nmembers of the International Law Commission”, which  \r\nelection has been scheduled to take place on Thursday, \r\n17 November 2011. On that day, the Assembly will \r\nproceed to the election of 34 members of the \r\nCommission, whose terms of office are to commence \r\non 1 January 2012. It should be recalled that, in \r\naccordance with the statute of the International Law \r\nCommission, the Secretary-General communicated to \r\nthe Governments of Member States, in document \r\nA/66/88, the list of candidates submitted within the \r\nrequired time for the submission of nominations, that \r\nis, by 1 June 2011.  \r\n In documents A/66/88/Add.1, Add.2 and Add.3, \r\nthe Secretary-General reported developments \r\nconcerning candidates, including new candidates and a \r\nwithdrawal, since the issuance of document A/66/88. \r\nThe statements of qualifications of the candidates are \r\ncontained in document A/66/90 and Add.1 and Add.2. \r\n Under these circumstances, it is necessary for the \r\nGeneral Assembly to take a decision as to whether the \r\nnew candidatures should be accepted in spite of the \r\nsubmission of their names subsequent to the deadline \r\nand whether they should be incorporated into a \r\nconsolidated list of candidates. It has been the practice \r\nof the Assembly to incorporate such late submissions \r\ninto a consolidated list. \r\n If I hear no objection, I shall take it that it is the \r\nwish of the General Assembly to request the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to issue such a consolidated list of candidates. \r\n It was so decided.  \r\n The Acting President: The consolidated list of \r\ncandidates will be issued under the symbol A/66/514. \r\n  The meeting rose at 4.25 p.m. \r\n"
