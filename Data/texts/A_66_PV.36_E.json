Allow me to briefly summarize the \r\nhighlights of the Council’s work this year. \r\n The 2011 annual ministerial review focused on \r\nthe theme of education, which is closely related to the \r\nachievement of the United Nations economic, social \r\nand environmental development agenda. Indeed, the \r\nfirst goals set by the United Nations were related to \r\neducation, arising from three regional conferences \r\norganized by UNESCO in the early 1960s. Fostering \r\neducation at all levels has thus been at the heart of the \r\ndevelopment agenda from the very beginning. \r\nA/66/PV.36  \r\n \r\n11-55468 2 \r\n \r\n At the review, the presence of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, and his \r\nstatement on the progress made towards achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) added a \r\npositive and challenging tone to the debate, which \r\nbenefited from the participation of several heads of \r\nUnited Nations entities and of numerous ministers, \r\nother high-level officials, notably Mr. Gordon Brown \r\nand Ms. Micheline Calmy-Rey, President of \r\nSwitzerland, and a record number of non-State \r\nactors — more than 1,400 — from various \r\nnon-governmental organizations and businesses. \r\n The segment emphasized the fact that the MDGs \r\nrepresent the minimum global standards for increasing \r\naccess to education, whereas the “education for all” \r\ngoals are more focused on improvements in delivery \r\nand learning. The segment also underscored the \r\nimportance of better utilizing education resources to \r\nimprove outcomes and quality, particularly teaching \r\nquality. Participants highlighted the potential of the \r\nannual ministerial review’s voluntary national \r\npresentations in going beyond the MDGs, and stressed \r\nthe need for the Council to focus on the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment framework. \r\n Delegations adopted a ministerial declaration that \r\narticulates numerous educational challenges and \r\nelaborates action-oriented policy measures. Although \r\nthis was not specifically reflected in the declaration, \r\nseveral speakers — including Mr. Brown, in his \r\nkeynote address focusing on broken promises, broken \r\ndreams and broken trust — expressed strong support \r\nfor augmenting resources, including by establishing a \r\nglobal fund for education. \r\n Another proposal, by the Swiss President, \r\nMs. Calmy-Rey, was the creation of a United Nations \r\nsustainable development council. The coordination \r\nsegment reviewed the follow-up by the United Nations \r\nsystem to last year’s ministerial declaration on gender \r\nequality and the empowerment of women and to the \r\nconference on Financing for Development. Participants \r\nwelcomed the role played by the United Nations Entity \r\nfor Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women \r\n(UN-Women) in the provision of technical support and \r\nthe coordination of actions on gender equality. \r\n The discussions also underlined the need for \r\nimproved global economic governance, particularly \r\nwith regard to the role of the United Nations system \r\nand the linkages with the Group of 20. \r\n In the operational activities segment, participants \r\nvoiced their expectations with respect to the 2012 \r\nquadrennial comprehensive policy review of the \r\nGeneral Assembly; reviewed the progress made in \r\nstrengthening the United Nations Resident Coordinator \r\nsystem, and strategized on ways to strengthen the \r\nfounding architecture of funds and programmes \r\nthrough the definition of “critical mass” of core \r\nresources. \r\n The humanitarian affairs segment demonstrated \r\nthe Council’s capacity to react quickly to topical \r\nissues, including South Sudan and the current \r\nemergency situation in the Horn of Africa. The \r\nsegment adopted a resolution that reaffirms the \r\nimportance of access and humanitarian principles, and \r\nreferences cluster coordination as well as \r\naccountability and the need to include acceptance as \r\npart of security risk-management strategies. \r\n The resolutions adopted by the Council at its \r\ngeneral segment, which carries out an overview of the \r\nwork of the Economic and Social Council’s functional \r\nmachinery, also attested to the Council’s effectiveness \r\nin responding to contemporary challenges efficiently. \r\nIn its resolution on South Sudan, which built on the \r\nCouncil’s joint informal event with the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission, held on 13 June 2011, the Council \r\ndecided to continue to monitor the development of that \r\nnew country and its progress towards achieving the \r\nMDGs, in view of its special responsibility to ensure \r\nthat the United Nations system support to the country \r\nis integrated and coordinated. \r\n A significant achievement was the establishment \r\nof the new United Nations Committee of Experts on \r\nGlobal Geospatial Information Management, which \r\nwill bring together for the first time, at the global level, \r\nGovernment experts from all Member States to \r\ncompile and disseminate best practices and experiences \r\non geospatial information that is highly relevant in the \r\ncontext of sustainable development and humanitarian \r\nassistance. \r\n On Haiti, the Council reviewed the report of its \r\nAd Hoc Advisory Group on Haiti — a timely \r\nundertaking, given the need to maintain a high level of \r\ninternational support for the country while ensuring \r\nthat political tensions do not hinder the reconstruction \r\nand development process. \r\n Looking ahead, my experience as Vice-President \r\nof the Economic and Social Council has shown me that \r\n A/66/PV.36\r\n \r\n3 11-55468 \r\n \r\nthe Council has made significant advances since the \r\n2005 World Summit. It has indeed become a quality \r\nforum for debate. I would suggest that the major gap \r\nremains in its consideration of so-called hard-core \r\neconomic issues, especially those of money and \r\nfinance. \r\n We have already set in motion preparations for \r\nthe next annual ministerial review, which will focus on \r\nemployment. As we all know, employment and decent \r\nwork are fundamental to the achievement of the social \r\nand environmental development agenda of the United \r\nNations, and ultimately to the sustainability of our \r\nplanet in the long run. Past years’ annual ministerial \r\nreviews have demonstrated that no true progress is \r\nachievable in any field — including education, gender \r\nequality, global public health and sustainable \r\ndevelopment — without the clear inclusion of \r\nemployment in an action agenda.  \r\n I consider that next year’s annual ministerial \r\nreview will be a crucial element in building our shared \r\nknowledge of development imperatives. We must \r\nensure that the recommendations of the previous years’ \r\nreviews will be carried through. I urge Assembly \r\nmembers to engage fully in the national, regional and \r\nglobal preparatory activities to mobilize action for \r\nrealization of the development vision of the United \r\nNations. \r\n Ms. Thakur (India): Let me begin by expressing \r\nmy delegation’s full support for the efforts to make the \r\nsixty-sixth session of the General Assembly a success. \r\n I wish to thank the Vice-President of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council for presenting the report \r\nof the Council (A/66/3) and for his encouraging \r\nleadership. \r\n We have just heard about the important steps and \r\nactions that the Economic and Social Council has taken \r\nwith regard to the global development agenda. The \r\nCouncil has an acknowledged role as a principal body \r\nfor coordination, policy review, policy dialogue and \r\nrecommendations on issues of economic and social \r\ndevelopment. It has been singularly successful in \r\npromoting the integrated and coordinated \r\nimplementation of the commitments made at the major \r\nUnited Nations conferences and summits.  \r\n Through the annual ministerial review and the \r\nDevelopment Cooperation Forum, the Council has \r\nbeen able to review efforts to achieve the \r\ninternationally agreed development goals, including \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). And the \r\nfocus of the annual ministerial review on one of those \r\nGoals has indeed helped to accelerate action on them.  \r\n The Economic and Social Council’s annual \r\nministerial review, held in July on the very important \r\ntheme of “Implementing the internationally agreed \r\ngoals and commitments in regard to education”, helped \r\nus track achievements on MDG 2 and the Dakar \r\nDeclaration on Education for All in a holistic manner. \r\nOverall, the Council session focused on promoting \r\ngreater coherence between policy and development \r\ngoals, and on making development partnership more \r\neffective, participatory and transparent. \r\n We welcome the Council’s oversight role vis-à-\r\nvis its commissions and committees, and we appreciate \r\nits recent decisions to take corrective action to \r\nmaintain the sanctity of that global body.  \r\n We greatly appreciate the high-level policy \r\ndialogue that the Council has been promoting with the \r\ninternational financial and trade institutions on current \r\ndevelopments in the world economy. This is of \r\nparticular relevance in the present uncertain global \r\neconomic scenario. There is clear recognition that \r\nglobal economic governance needs wider participation \r\non the part of developing countries, especially in the \r\ndecision-making structures of the Bretton Woods \r\ninstitutions. We are hopeful that the Council will play a \r\nproactive role in achieving this objective. \r\n The United Nations conferences and summits \r\nheld since the 1990s have generated an unprecedented \r\nglobal consensus on the need to pursue sustained, \r\ninclusive and equitable growth and development. If \r\nprosperity is not shared, there cannot be a just and \r\nequitable world. This imperative was emphatically \r\nreiterated at the Fourth United Nations Conference on \r\nthe Least Developed Countries (LDCs), held in Turkey \r\nthis year. The Istanbul Programme of Action for the \r\nLeast Developed Countries for the Decade 2011-2020 \r\n(A/CONF.219/3/Rev.1), though an ambitious \r\ndocument, seeks only a minimal commitment from the \r\nglobal community. If we can give the LDCs a helping \r\nhand, they would be more than willing to run to the \r\nfinish line.  \r\n The global economic crisis has not boded well for \r\nthe MDGs. Accelerated action is needed to neutralize \r\nthe reverses in poverty alleviation and other \r\ndevelopment goals. The least-developed countries, \r\nA/66/PV.36  \r\n \r\n11-55468 4 \r\n \r\nwhich are the biggest laggards where the MDGs are \r\nconcerned, need increased external support, including \r\nofficial development assistance (ODA), foreign direct \r\ninvestment and trade. \r\n The linkages between the various United Nations \r\ndevelopment summits and conferences are strong and \r\ntheir synergies must be tapped. The Mauritius Strategy \r\nfor the Further Implementation of the Programme of \r\nAction for the Sustainable Development of Small \r\nIsland Developing States would derive immense \r\nbenefits from a comprehensive, ambitious and \r\nequitable outcome of the climate change negotiations. \r\nSimilarly, the Convention on Biological Diversity and \r\nits Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit-Sharing, \r\nthrough the protection of biodiversity, have an \r\nimportant role to play in poverty eradication.  \r\n Multiple United Nations conferences and \r\nsummits that focused on the attainment of \r\ninternationally agreed development goals must, \r\ntherefore, have a seamless, holistic and integrated \r\nworking relationship with each other. The role of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council in providing this \r\nimportant interface cannot be overemphasized. \r\n With just four years to go until the MDG target \r\nyear, follow-up action on all United Nations summits \r\nand conferences must be pushed. Global economic \r\nuncertainties should not become an excuse for inaction \r\non our development agenda, all the more so as efforts \r\nto address the development deficit would give a boost \r\nto economic recovery.  \r\n A follow-up to the Monterrey Consensus of the \r\nInternational Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment and the Doha Review Conference on \r\nFinancing for Development is fundamental to ensuring \r\nresources and the policy space that developing \r\ncountries need to enable them to meet their \r\nsocio-economic challenges. The 0.7 per cent ODA \r\ncommitment must be met as soon as possible. Equally \r\nimportant is the need to ensure technology transfer and \r\ncapacity-building for developing countries. We must \r\ngive a renewed push to the Doha Development Round. \r\nAt the upcoming United Nations Conference on \r\nSustainable Development, we must ensure that the \r\nopportunity to return the sustainable development \r\nagenda to centre stage is fully exploited. \r\n Over the years, the Economic and Social Council \r\nhas played an important role in advancing a holistic \r\nand coordinated approach to global economic and \r\nsocial development, taking into account the \r\ninterrelatedness of the various goals and targets of \r\nmajor United Nations conferences. We must work to \r\nmake the Economic and Social Council even more \r\nmeaningful than what was originally envisaged by the \r\nCharter of the United Nations and subsequently \r\nstrengthened by various resolutions, particularly \r\nresolution 61/16. \r\n Ms. Flores (Honduras) (spoke in Spanish): My \r\ndelegation is grateful for the presentation of the report \r\nof the Economic and Social Council for 2011 (A/66/3), \r\nthe resolutions approved, the description of the high-\r\nlevel meetings and the ministerial declaration adopted. \r\nMoreover, the work of its President, Ambassador \r\nLazarous Kapambwe, and of the Bureau that assisted \r\nhim, has been commendable. Allow us to make a few \r\nbrief reflections. \r\n We wish to express our satisfaction to the United \r\nNations Development Programme (UNDP) on the \r\nprogramme signed with our country. Special mention \r\nmust be given to the humanist content of the report \r\nentitled “UNDP in Action 2010/2011: People-centred \r\ndevelopment”, by UNDP Administrator Helen Clark.  \r\n Among the principle results of the specific UNDP \r\nprogrammes achieved in 2010 are the support for \r\nelections and reconstruction after crises and disasters. \r\nUNDP has helped more than 50 countries, including \r\nours, to enact legislation, implement policies and \r\ncreate new institutions specifically designed to \r\nminimize the impact of natural disasters. Recently, the \r\nExecutive Board of the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme and the United Nations Population Fund \r\napproved the country programme for Honduras for the \r\nperiod 2012 to 2016. \r\n It is no secret that despite the best efforts that \r\nhave been made, many countries are still far from \r\nachieving the much desired Millennium Development \r\nGoals by 2015. My own country — with the exception \r\nof the targets relating to water supply, sanitation and \r\nnutrition — is included in that long list. The Honduran \r\neconomy has grown at the average rate for Latin \r\nAmerica. However, it would seem that we move from \r\none crisis to another; we put out one fire and another \r\nflares up.  \r\n Sometimes our own domestic mistakes are to \r\nblame; other times, it is the negative results of external \r\nfactors. Yesterday, it was the collapse of global \r\nfinancial systems; today, the collapse of the markets \r\n A/66/PV.36\r\n \r\n5 11-55468 \r\n \r\nthat buy what little we sell. Tomorrow it will be \r\nanxiety, if not fear, because of the warning bells that \r\ndrive the world’s rickety economies to the brink of \r\nrecession. We take small steps forward one day, \r\nfollowed by recurring episodes of bad news. It is \r\npainful not to be able to advance hopes for the \r\nimmediate future when we are overwhelmed by the \r\npresent emergency. \r\n Just weeks ago we went to sleep with cautious \r\nhopes for a good harvest — and were abruptly \r\nawakened by water up to our necks. There was \r\nflooding throughout the country, with loss of lives, \r\nhomes and roads. Infrastructure was damaged and \r\nhundreds were injured. Two days of torrential rains \r\nwere all it took to declare once more a state of \r\nemergency. Add those and other recent misfortunes and \r\nsetbacks to the tremendous accumulated social debt, \r\nand it is easy to see why more than half the population \r\nstill lives in precarious situations. \r\n We have made hardly any significant impact on \r\nthe high levels of poverty in which more than half the \r\npopulation lives. While, compared to 2001 figures, \r\nthere are approximately 7.5 per cent fewer Hondurans \r\nin extreme poverty, our achievement lies more in the \r\ndepth of our commitment to what needs to be done \r\nthan in the momentary relief through what has been \r\nachieved.  \r\n This is not a complaint or a rationalization asking \r\nfor pity. It is simply the hard reality. It is a process we \r\nare used to: falling, getting up and dusting ourselves \r\noff. That is why it is sad that we have to admit that \r\nenormous gaps in equality persist. The mountain of \r\nproblems does not seem to shrink. But that is the size \r\nof the challenge that we must face, with quiet \r\ndetermination to keep going. \r\n The Plan for the Nation (2010-2022), adopted by \r\nthe Government of integration and national \r\nreconciliation, is a beacon of hope. It includes reducing \r\npoverty and inequality as a priority, creating a national \r\nplanning system and establishing a decentralized \r\ndecision-making structure to define, manage and \r\nfollow up on public policies. \r\n In our fight to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, we must be more forceful in \r\nestablishing policies for rapid job creation and \r\nincreasing household incomes. We emphasize that a \r\ngreat many Hondurans who leave their homeland do so \r\nout of necessity, because they cannot find work that \r\nenables them to live in dignity. As long as the country \r\ndoes not offer ample opportunities, the wave of \r\nmigration will continue, with the dismal consequences \r\nof grief and tragic stories of outrages, rape and \r\nvexations suffered by many of our emigrating \r\ncompatriots, hundreds of whom have paid with their \r\nlives, in the corridors of death, for the dream of hope.  \r\n We look forward to the assistance of the UNDP \r\nOffice in the national effort to reach the goals of the \r\nPlan for the Nation. It will help in gathering \r\ninformation, designing assessment and follow-up \r\nmechanisms, helping local mechanisms in public \r\npolicy coherence and generating statistical data that \r\nwill be helpful in designing inclusive social policies. \r\n Recent international studies estimate that \r\nHonduras will suffer an increase in temperature, with \r\nresulting negative effects on agricultural activity and \r\nproduction in the countryside. A large part of our \r\npopulation is rural, with a subsistence economy. \r\nResearch on agricultural vulnerability due to climate \r\nchange is one of the tools being used to propose, with \r\nreliable data, risk management options that will lead to \r\nmitigation solutions. \r\n While the work ahead of us is challenging, it \r\nwould be unfair to deny the progress that has been \r\nmade in the areas of democratic governance, national \r\nreconciliation, human rights, citizen security and the \r\nstrengthening of the rule of law. We will continue to \r\nsupport reforms to eliminate barriers to women’s \r\nparticipation in politics, in the economy and in the \r\nmajor role that is theirs in society, within the \r\nframework of our gender equality and equity plan. \r\n We will continue technical cooperation with the \r\nSupreme Electoral Tribunal to promote political and \r\nelectoral reforms that ensure transparency and \r\nefficiency in electoral processes, which are considered \r\nessential components for strengthening the Honduran \r\ndemocratic system. \r\n Our commitment must be unwavering. We must \r\nnot leave a heavy debt of obligations that we could \r\nresolve now for future generations to pay. Our will to \r\nbequeath a world of more dignified lives for our \r\nchildren and their children must be unshakeable, as \r\nmust be too our desire to live and coexist in peace as \r\nbrothers — which is what all the peoples of the world \r\nare. \r\nA/66/PV.36  \r\n \r\n11-55468 6 \r\n \r\n Mr. Maksimychev (Russian Federation) (spoke \r\nin Russian): I would like to thank the Vice-President of \r\nthe Economic and Social Council for presenting the \r\nCouncil’s report (A/66/3). I would also like to express \r\nmy gratitude to the Secretariat for supporting the \r\nCouncil’s work this year.  \r\n Russia attaches great importance to the work of \r\nthe Council because it is the main coordinating body of \r\nthe United Nations development system — a unique \r\nmechanism to harmonize the interests of different \r\ncountries and a very important international forum in \r\nwhich to develop basic principles and thrusts of global \r\neconomic, social and humanitarian cooperation. \r\n We welcome the adoption of the multi-year \r\nprogramme of work for the annual ministerial reviews, \r\nin the context of achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). In 2012, Russia intends \r\nto put forward its national voluntary presentation on \r\nthe reviews theme “Promoting productive capacity, \r\nemployment and decent work to eradicate poverty in \r\nthe context of inclusive, sustainable and equitable \r\neconomic growth at all levels for achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals”. \r\n We commend the outcome of the Economic and \r\nSocial Council session this year. The intense and \r\neffective work of the Council during its high-level \r\nsegment strengthened the position of education among \r\nthe priority issues on the United Nations social and \r\neconomic agenda. It also gave powerful additional \r\nimpetus to the coordinated work of the United Nations \r\nsystem in the area of education.  \r\n The segment’s ministerial declaration set out the \r\npolitical context for further efforts at all levels, \r\nparticularly in such key areas as increasing the quality \r\nof and expanding access to education; preparing and \r\ntraining qualified teachers and improving their working \r\nconditions; attracting and effectively using financial \r\nresources for education; and improving the system of \r\nvocational training to ensure progressive, \r\ncomprehensive and fair economic growth based on full \r\nemployment.  \r\n We note the Council’s contribution to \r\nimplementing the decisions reached at the 2009 United \r\nNations Conference on the World Financial and \r\nEconomic Crisis and Its Impact on Development. In \r\nthat regard, the Council reached an agreement on the \r\nbasic principles to underpin the future work of the \r\nGeneral Assembly by setting up a new advisory body \r\nto draft independent recommendations, including on \r\nthe issue of international cooperation in the financial \r\nand economic spheres and the reform of the global \r\neconomic regulatory system.  \r\n In 2011, the Council confirmed its key role in the \r\nprocess of intergovernmental follow-up to the various \r\ninternational conferences on financing for \r\ndevelopment. We welcome the outcome of the special \r\nhigh-level meeting of the Council with the Bretton \r\nWoods institutions, the World Trade Organization and \r\nthe United Nations Conference on Trade and \r\nDevelopment. We also welcome the efforts of the \r\nPresident and Bureau of the Council to establish \r\nworking contacts, in particular with the International \r\nMonetary Fund and the World Bank.  \r\n One of the Council’s future priorities should be to \r\nexpand mutually beneficial cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and international financial and trade \r\ninstitutions, the private sector and non-governmental \r\norganizations so as to effectively implement the \r\ninternational development agenda. \r\n The Russian Federation has consistently favoured \r\nstrengthening the coordinating role of the Council as \r\npart of the United Nations system. In that regard, it is \r\nimportant to focus efforts on ensuring coherence \r\nbetween the work of the governing bodies of the \r\nUnited Nations programmes, funds and specialized \r\nagencies, and the overall efforts of the Council in the \r\ncontext of follow-up activities to the recommendations \r\nof the key social and economic bodies of the \r\nOrganization. We call for capacity-building within the \r\nCouncil so that it is able to scrutinize the effectiveness \r\nof the specialized inter-agency bodies and the \r\ncoordinating mechanisms of the Secretariat, including \r\nthe United Nations System Chief Executives Board for \r\nCoordination (CEB). It is important to set up effective \r\nmechanisms enabling Member States to periodically \r\nassess the work of the CEB from a policy point of \r\nview, adjust its priorities and set additional challenges \r\nfor the Board so as to ensure the comprehensive and \r\ncoordinated implementation of and follow-up to the \r\noutcomes of the major United Nations conferences and \r\nsummits in the economic, social and related fields. \r\n The Russian delegation has actively participated \r\nin the review of the implementation of resolution 61/16 \r\non strengthening of the Economic and Social Council. \r\nThe report on the topic submitted by the President of \r\nthe sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly (see \r\n A/66/PV.36\r\n \r\n7 11-55468 \r\n \r\nA/65/866, annex) contains a range of useful \r\nrecommendations that should be duly considered in the \r\nfuture work of the Council and the General Assembly.  \r\n In our opinion, one of the priorities of the review \r\nwas to clarify the mandates of the separate segments of \r\nthe Council’s substantive session, in particular the \r\ncoordination segment. Unfortunately, this and a range \r\nof other questions, including the possibility of \r\noptimizing the agenda and programme of work of the \r\nCouncil’s substantive session, were hardly touched \r\nupon during the review. We deem it necessary to \r\ncontinue work in this area during the 2012 substantive \r\nsession of the Council, bearing in mind the relevant \r\nconclusions and recommendations of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral.  \r\n The Russian delegation is prepared to cooperate \r\nconstructively with all partners in order to ensure the \r\nfuture strengthening of the Council, including \r\nconsidering the role of the United Nations in global \r\neconomic governance. \r\n Mr. Zdorov (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): I \r\nwould like to thank the leadership of the Economic and \r\nSocial Council for presenting the report on the work of \r\nthe Council (A/66/3). Belarus commends the work of \r\nthe Council in the reporting period and recognizes the \r\nskilful leadership of the Ambassador of Zambia, \r\nMr. Lazarous Kapambwe. \r\n We believe that the Council was able to increase \r\nthe practical significance of its high-level segment for \r\nthe functioning of the United Nations system. We also \r\nwelcome the choice of themes for discussion during \r\nthat segment. In that regard, we would like to draw \r\nattention to the excellent quality of preparations for the \r\nCouncil’s substantive session of 2011, during which \r\nBelarus presented its national report on implementing \r\nthe internationally agreed goals and commitments in \r\nregard to education.  \r\n We are convinced that discussing the national \r\nvoluntary presentations on the achievement of the \r\ntargets set under the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs) is a unique mechanism for mutual \r\naccountability and feedback. We therefore welcome \r\nthis practice and are in favour of its continuation.  \r\n Belarus gained positive experience in \r\nimplementing its education policy, which, in the \r\nopinion of the Council’s President, could be used in \r\nother countries. We note, in particular, the value of \r\nfurther integrating Belarus’ education strategies into \r\nthe international education system. \r\n We are in favour of strengthening the \r\ncoordinating role of the Council in efforts to achieve \r\nthe MDGs by 2015 and in further steps after 2015. We \r\nbelieve that these issues should be discussed as part of \r\nthe annual ministerial reviews and the Development \r\nCooperation Forum. One of the topics for the Council’s \r\n2013 annual ministerial review could be the \r\npreparation of the MDG agenda for the decade after \r\n2015. It is crucially important that the international \r\ncommunity step up efforts to achieve the MDGs on the \r\nbasis of the principles of global partnership, including \r\nby implementing their development commitments.  \r\n We would like to draw attention to the need to \r\nestablish a new energy architecture that will provide \r\naccess to energy services and allow States to exchange \r\nmodern energy technologies. This is also an important \r\nfactor in achieving the MDGs.  \r\n We also believe that the impact of climate change \r\nmust be taken into consideration in long-term strategies \r\non financing for development and building a green \r\neconomy. \r\n We urge the Council to continue strengthening its \r\ncoordinating role in the search for new and innovative \r\ndevelopment financing mechanisms and help \r\ndeveloping and middle-income countries to integrate \r\ninto the international economic and trade systems. We \r\nnote, however, that the use of innovative approaches \r\nshould not replace traditional forms of financing.  \r\n Belarus supports the practice of periodic reviews \r\nof operational activities for development under the \r\nauspices of the Economic and Social Council. In that \r\nregard, we welcome the forthcoming discussion in \r\n2012 by the United Nations operational funds on their \r\nstrategies to improve support to the least developed \r\nand middle-income countries.  \r\n Regarding the high-level meetings of the Council \r\nwith the participation of the leaders of the Bretton \r\nWoods institutions, the World Trade Organization, the \r\nWorld Health Organization and the International \r\nLabour Organization, we believe that the practice of \r\nholding such meetings has proven successful and \r\nshould be continued. At the same time, we suggest \r\nconsidering optimizing the agenda of the joint \r\nmeetings so as to make them more productive. Belarus \r\nis also in favour of increasing the role of developing \r\nA/66/PV.36  \r\n \r\n11-55468 8 \r\n \r\nand middle-income countries in the decision-making \r\nprocess of the governing bodies of the Bretton Woods \r\ninstitutions. \r\n The main responsibility for ensuring that \r\ndecisions adopted at the various United Nations \r\nconferences and summits are implemented lies with \r\nMember States and the specialized agencies of the \r\nUnited Nations. To successfully monitor the \r\nimplementation of these decisions, it is particularly \r\nimportant to establish closer cooperation among the \r\ngoverning bodies of the United Nations system, \r\nincluding with the help of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil.  \r\n Today, when the world is contending with serious \r\neconomic difficulties, the work of the Council should \r\nfocus with special intensity on solving Member States’ \r\nurgent problems. Belarus intends to make its \r\ncontribution to this task, including as a member of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council if Member States support \r\nour country in the elections to this important United \r\nNations entity. \r\n Mr. Iziraren (Morocco) (spoke in French): My \r\ndelegation is happy to participate in today’s meeting of \r\nthe General Assembly to discuss the report of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council for 2011 (A/66/3). I \r\nwould also like to take this opportunity to congratulate \r\nMr. Lazarous Kapambwe, President of the Council, for \r\nthe remarkable work he has done at its head. Today’s \r\ndiscussion is testament to the synergy that should \r\ncharacterize relations between the Assembly and the \r\nCouncil, with the aim of promoting international \r\neconomic and social cooperation on a harmonious and \r\neffective basis. \r\n Through its activities, the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil makes a significant contribution to stimulating \r\nthe debate on international cooperation so as to identify \r\nthe best approaches and policies to advance and \r\nimplement the United Nations development agenda. \r\nThe report submitted to the Assembly and the various \r\nactivities it discusses testify to the dynamism shown by \r\nthe Council in its efforts to speed up progress towards \r\nachieving the internationally agreed development \r\ngoals, particularly the Millennium Development Goals.  \r\n While the Council’s role in following up the \r\noutcomes of high-level conferences and meetings on \r\nsocial and economic development continues to be \r\nconsolidated, more needs to be done to enable it to \r\nfully play its role as the main review and coordinating \r\nbody of the United Nations for economic and social \r\nactivities. \r\n The annual ministerial review and the \r\nDevelopment Cooperation Forum — new functions \r\nassigned to the Council at the 2005 World Summit — \r\nhave become important gatherings for assessing \r\nprogress made in achieving internationally agreed \r\ndevelopment goals, as well as those relating to \r\ninternational cooperation, in order to promote the \r\nnecessary consensus among Members on how best to \r\nimprove them.  \r\n Solving development problems today demands \r\nthe participation of all actors — public, private, \r\nnational, regional and international. The involvement \r\nin the Council’s activities by representatives of civil \r\nsociety, the private sector and the academic and \r\nscientific worlds, and by United Nations institutions \r\nand other international organizations working \r\nalongside States, can only enhance its role as the chief \r\ninternational body entrusted with reviewing \r\ninternational cooperation in the areas of economic and \r\nsocial development. \r\n The conjunction of every kind of crisis — \r\nfinancial, economic and food — and the exacerbations \r\nof climate change have begun to call into question \r\nsome development gains. The countries most affected \r\nby these crises remain, notably, African and least-\r\ndeveloped countries (LDCs), thereby presenting the \r\ninternational community with the moral obligation to \r\nstrengthen its cooperation with those countries in order \r\nto help them achieve their development goals and \r\novercome structural obstacles to their development.  \r\n In that regard, Morocco welcomes the fact that \r\nthe Council decided to include in its annual ministerial \r\nreview for 2015 the issue of follow-up to the \r\nimplementation of the Istanbul Programme of Action \r\nfor the Least Developed Countries for the Decade \r\n2011-2020, and that the Development Cooperation \r\nForum will also address this issue when it reviews \r\ntrends in international cooperation on development, as \r\nwell as consistency in development policies. \r\n Although the various crises that have arisen in \r\nrecent years have posed major challenges to \r\ndevelopment and have tested international cooperation \r\nand multilateralism, they have also encouraged the \r\ninternational community to engage in constructive \r\ndebate on global economic governance. The Economic \r\nand Social Council, which has been at the heart of that \r\n A/66/PV.36\r\n \r\n9 11-55468 \r\n \r\ndebate, can in fact bring coherence and effectiveness to \r\nthe process of making decisions with regard to global \r\neconomic governance and to the implementation of \r\nthose decisions. \r\n Strengthening the role of the Economic and \r\nSocial Council in global economic governance first \r\nentails consolidating its work in coordinating with the \r\nother international institutions and forums involved in \r\nthat governance, in order to ensure the consistency of \r\ndecisions and actions taken to promote development. \r\n Morocco, which pays special attention to the \r\nwork of the Economic and Social Council, has always \r\nplayed a constructive role in that work and has \r\nsupported the Council’s efforts to achieve harmonious \r\nsocial and economic global development. As an \r\nexpression of the priority accorded to its people’s \r\nsustainable economic and social development, \r\nMorocco has, within the framework of the dynamic \r\nreforms instituted by His Majesty the King, moved \r\nforward with the creation of the National Economic, \r\nSocial and Environmental Council as a constitutional \r\nbody. His Majesty, who has always ensured that the \r\nconsolidation of Morocco’s democratic gains has \r\nproceeded alongside and in line with the sustainable \r\nhuman development of its people, emphasized at the \r\nestablishment of the National Council that its task was \r\nto be an institution for good governance in \r\ndevelopment. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to reiterate Morocco’s \r\nwillingness to continue to contribute constructively to \r\nthe work of the Economic and Social Council, and to \r\ncall on members to help strengthen the Council’s role \r\nin global economic governance so as to better serve the \r\ncause of development. \r\n Mr. Almeida (Brazil): The joint debate on the \r\nreport of the Economic and Social Council (A/66/3) \r\nand the integrated follow-up to major United Nations \r\nconferences and summits in the economic, social and \r\nrelated fields constitutes an important opportunity to \r\nreview the work undertaken during the past year and to \r\nprepare for the forthcoming discussions in General \r\nAssembly and beyond. We would like to place on \r\nrecord our appreciation for the leadership and \r\ndedication of the President of the Council, Ambassador \r\nLazarous Kapambwe, particularly during the Council’s \r\nsubstantive session in July. \r\n My delegation would also like to commend \r\nAmbassador Octavio Errázuriz, appointed by the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth \r\nsession to facilitate the review of the implementation \r\nof resolution 61/16, which established the main \r\nelements of the current structure of the substantive \r\nsession of the Council: the Development Cooperation \r\nForum (DCF) and the annual ministerial review, among \r\nother innovations. \r\n As the principal body under the Charter for \r\ncoordination, policy review, policy dialogue and \r\nrecommendations on issues of economic and social \r\ndevelopment, including sustainable development, the \r\nEconomic and Social Council plays a crucial role in the \r\nUnited Nations system. While we recognize that \r\nimportant initiatives have been undertaken over the \r\npast few years to improve the Council’s \r\ninter-institutional and intergovernmental coordination, \r\nBrazil believes it is important to further strengthen the \r\nCouncil so that it can fully contribute to international \r\npolicy discussions and deliberations on substantive \r\nissues relating to development. We believe that the \r\nreport transmitted by the President of the Assembly in \r\ndocument A/65/866 offers a good basis for the review \r\nof the work of the Economic and Social Council to be \r\nconducted during the Assembly’s sixty-seventh session. \r\n The Council’s current structure has its merits. \r\nThe annual ministerial review has become an \r\nincreasingly important event on the international \r\nagenda, capable of mobilizing ministers, high-level \r\nofficials and special representatives from developing \r\nand developed countries alike to address key issues on \r\nthe development agenda. It allows Member States to \r\nreview progress on specific policy questions relevant to \r\nthe international community, with a view to making \r\nconcrete recommendations that can be acted on by \r\nnational Governments. It rests on strong foundations \r\nand can count on solid achievements as it expands its \r\nwork. \r\n The Development Cooperation Forum is also an \r\nimportant venue for policy discussion and exchange of \r\nviews on development cooperation. In order for the \r\nForum to fulfil its potential, however, it needs to be \r\nfurther strengthened. In particular, we consider that the \r\nDCF should meet annually, instead of biennially as is \r\ncurrently mandated. Furthermore, we believe that the \r\nForum’s deliberations should be reflected in a \r\nnegotiated outcome, not simply a Chair’s summary. \r\n We are convinced that the DCF can evolve into \r\nbecoming the main forum for development \r\nA/66/PV.36  \r\n \r\n11-55468 10 \r\n \r\ncooperation, addressing, in a comprehensive manner, \r\nissues such as official development assistance, South-\r\nSouth cooperation, philanthropy and new and emerging \r\ndonors.  \r\n The intergovernmental follow-up mechanism to \r\nthe financing for development process remains a key \r\noutstanding issue on the international agenda. While \r\nthe multifaceted mechanism adopted by the Economic \r\nand Social Council in 2009 was a step in the right \r\ndirection, it falls short of what is needed to ensure the \r\nproper consideration of the financing for development \r\nagenda in the Economic and Social Council. As we \r\nhave mentioned previously, we strongly favour the \r\nestablishment of a functional commission on financing \r\nfor development to follow up on the Monterrey \r\nConsensus and the Doha Declaration on Financing for \r\nDevelopment. In that regard, we believe that the \r\nFollow-up International Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment in 2013 should consider, as a matter of \r\npriority, the institutional framework for Financing for \r\nDevelopment with a view to redressing the current \r\nshortcomings. \r\n On behalf of the Brazilian Government, I would \r\nlike to take this opportunity to invite Member States to \r\njoin us, at the highest level, for the United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development next June. In \r\n1992, we adopted a landmark agreement in Rio de \r\nJaneiro, committing the international community to a \r\nconsensus on sustainable development. In 2002, we \r\ndecided on the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation to \r\nspeed up delivery on those commitments. Next year, \r\nwe must renew our joint determination and reaffirm \r\nour common commitment, while taking concrete steps \r\nto achieve sustainable development. \r\n The Conference and its preparatory process will \r\nobjectively assess the progress achieved so far and \r\nidentify the gaps in implementation. We must address \r\nthe new and emerging issues and establish solid \r\nfoundations for cooperation for the future. Two issues \r\nhighlighted by the General Assembly are a green \r\neconomy, in the context of sustainable development, \r\nand poverty eradication, as well as the institutional \r\nframework for sustainable development.  \r\n The Conference will also take up other proposals \r\nto be put forth that might contribute to reinvigorating \r\nimplementation, such as the adoption of sustainable \r\ndevelopment goals. As the host country and future \r\nConference President, Brazil is committed to working \r\nwith all Member States and all interested stakeholders \r\nto ensure that the Conference delivers on the growing \r\nexpectations. \r\n Mr. Diallo (Senegal) (spoke in French): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in joining my voice to those of previous \r\nspeakers to discharge the pleasant duty of conveying \r\nmy sincere congratulations to our colleague and friend \r\nAmbassador Lazarous Kapambwe, President of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council, for the quality of his \r\nreport (A/66/3). The document under consideration \r\nprovides useful information on the importance of the \r\nCouncil’s current activities, on the various decisions \r\nadopted and on some of the recommendations \r\ncontained therein. \r\n The emergence of a better, more peaceful and \r\nmore prosperous world, free of all extreme forms of \r\nviolence, will occur only with the ongoing promotion \r\nof sustained and inclusive economic and social \r\ndevelopment. In that regard, the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil, given its prerogatives, is certainly a key link \r\nin the United Nations system. The importance of the \r\nrole entrusted to it within that context explains my \r\ncountry’s great interest in the work of that renowned \r\norgan. That interest is particularly demonstrated by our \r\nactive participation in the various activities of the \r\nCouncil. \r\n By way of example, I would cite my country’s \r\nrecent involvement in the 2011 annual ministerial \r\nreview, which made it possible to assess the efforts \r\nmade by my country, Senegal, to implement its \r\neducation policy and the challenges still facing it. \r\nMoreover, I take this opportunity to express my \r\ndelegation’s gratitude for the smooth running of that \r\nreview and for the facilities granted to our country, \r\nboth for the drafting of its national report and for its \r\npresentation. I also take this opportunity to thank \r\nCanada, France and Japan, which kindly agreed to be \r\namong the reviewing countries. May they realize, \r\nthrough my words, the gratitude of the Senegalese \r\nGovernment. \r\n I would also like to underscore the benefit of that \r\nmechanism. It provides the opportunity not only to \r\nassess implementation of the decisions and \r\nrecommendations made by the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil, but also to measure their impact on the \r\ndevelopment of States. \r\n My delegation also calls on Member States to \r\nbreathe new life into the Development Cooperation \r\n A/66/PV.36\r\n \r\n11 11-55468 \r\n \r\nForum. That is another mechanism of the Economic \r\nand Social Council, which meets every two years and \r\nseeks to strengthen implementation of the United \r\nNations development agenda.  \r\n Participants will agree with me that, despite all \r\nsuch mechanisms and areas of exchange established to \r\nimprove the coordination activities of the Economic \r\nand Social Council, there remain, nonetheless, \r\nsignificant shortcomings. Indeed, it is highly \r\nregrettable to note that the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil really plays only a limited role in leading \r\neconomic and social development activities.  \r\n Currently, development strategies that would \r\nindeed help to achieve the goal of combating poverty \r\nwould benefit from being applied by bodies that are \r\neffective in economic and social terms. Such \r\nacknowledgement has led to a flourishing of ideas that \r\nhave given rise to widespread resolve to continue and \r\nsupport the reforms already undertaken to further \r\nstrengthen the powers of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil and increase its profile. \r\n On that basis, my delegation welcomes the \r\nconsiderable progress already made, in particular, the \r\nsignificant reforms embarked on during the 2005 \r\nWorld Summit, as well as the adoption of resolution \r\n61/16, by which the General Assembly stated its intent \r\nto continue those reforms. \r\n With that in mind, my delegation believes that the \r\nfocus should be placed, as a priority, on strengthening \r\nthe Council’s powers, improving its relations with the \r\nother United Nations organs, and clarifying their \r\nvarious mandates. That would certainly enable the  \r\n \r\nEconomic and Social Council to fully fulfil its \r\ncoordinating role, to serve as a credible decision-\r\nmaking body and, in short, to play a truly dynamic \r\nrole.  \r\n In order to increase its effectiveness, the Council \r\nwould also benefit from being placed at the heart of \r\nglobal economic governance, and, furthermore, given \r\nits agenda, it should increase the number of its \r\nmeetings, both on global issues and on particular \r\ntopics. \r\n In that regard, participation on the part of the \r\nOrganization’s subsidiary bodies in the annual \r\nministerial review, as well as the Council’s greater \r\ninvolvement in efforts to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, are also areas, among others, that \r\ncould be explored. In that context, I would like to \r\npropose to the Economic and Social Council the idea \r\nof considering a follow-up meeting to the 2010 Summit \r\non the Millennium Development Goals. \r\n The importance of operational activities within \r\nthe United Nations system has led to a greater number \r\nof institutions and to overlapping development \r\nactivities, thus creating real coordination difficulties. \r\nThat is why, in order to ensure a functioning, balanced \r\nand coherent system, the links between the Economic \r\nand Social Council and the various United Nations \r\nfunds and programmes should be re-examined. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Arabic): We \r\nhave heard the last speaker on agenda items 9 and 14. \r\nThe General Assembly has thus concluded this stage of \r\nits consideration of those two agenda items. \r\n  The meeting rose at 11.20 a.m. \r\n"
