(Qatar) \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 113 \r\n \r\nElections to fill vacancies in principal organs \r\n \r\n (a) Election of five non-permanent members of  \r\nthe Security Council \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): The General \r\nAssembly will now proceed to the election of five \r\nnon-permanent members of the Security Council to \r\nreplace those members whose term of office expires on \r\n31 December 2011. \r\n The five outgoing non-permanent members are \r\nthe following: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Gabon, \r\nLebanon and Nigeria. Those five States cannot be \r\nre-elected. Their names, therefore, should not appear \r\non the ballot papers. \r\n Apart from the five permanent members, the \r\nSecurity Council will include in the year 2012 the \r\nfollowing States: Colombia, Germany, India, Portugal \r\nand South Africa. The names of those States, therefore, \r\nshould also not appear on the ballot papers. \r\n Of the five non-permanent members that will \r\nremain in office in the year 2012, two are from Africa \r\nand Asia-Pacific, one is from Latin America and the \r\nCaribbean and two are from Western Europe and other \r\nStates. Consequently, pursuant to paragraph 3 of \r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 1991 A (XVIII), of \r\n17 December 1963, the five non-permanent members \r\nshould be elected according to the following pattern: \r\nthree from Africa and Asia-Pacific, one from Eastern \r\nEurope and one from Latin America and the Caribbean. \r\nThe ballot papers reflect that pattern. \r\n In accordance with established practice, there is \r\nan understanding to the effect that, of the three States \r\nto be elected from Africa and Asia-Pacific, two should \r\nbe from Africa and one from Asia-Pacific. \r\n I should like to inform the Assembly that those \r\ncandidates — their number not exceeding the number \r\nof seats to be filled — receiving the greatest number of \r\nvotes and a two-thirds majority of those present and \r\nvoting, will be declared elected. If the number of \r\ncandidates receiving a two-thirds majority is less than \r\nthe number of members to be elected, there shall be \r\nadditional ballots to fill the remaining seats, the voting \r\nbeing restricted to the candidates obtaining the greatest \r\nnumber of votes in the previous ballot to a number not \r\nmore than twice the places remaining to be filled. \r\n Also, consistent with past practice, in case a tie \r\nvote should make it necessary to determine the \r\ncandidate to be elected or that will proceed to the next \r\nround of restricted balloting, there will be a special \r\nrestricted ballot limited to those candidates that have \r\nobtained an equal number of votes. \r\n May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to \r\nthat procedure? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): In accordance \r\nwith rule 92 of the rules of procedure, the election shall \r\nbe held by secret ballot and there shall be no \r\nnominations. \r\nA/66/PV.37  \r\n \r\n11-55830 2 \r\n \r\n Regarding candidatures, I have been informed by \r\nthe Chairpersons of the respective regional groups of \r\nthe following. For the three vacant seats from among \r\nthe African and Asian-Pacific States, five candidates \r\nhave been designated, namely, Kyrgyzstan, Mauritania, \r\nMorocco, Pakistan and Togo. For the one vacant seat \r\nfrom among the Eastern European States, there are \r\nthree candidates, namely, Azerbaijan, Hungary and \r\nSlovenia. For the one vacant seat from among the Latin \r\nAmerican and Caribbean States, there is one endorsed \r\ncandidate, namely, Guatemala. \r\n In accordance with rule 92 of the rules of \r\nprocedure, we shall now proceed to the election by \r\nsecret ballot. \r\n Before we begin the voting process, I should like \r\nto remind members that, pursuant to rule 88 of the \r\nrules of procedure of the General Assembly, no \r\nrepresentative shall interrupt the voting except on a \r\npoint of order on the actual conduct of the voting. \r\n We shall now begin the voting process. Members \r\nare requested to remain seated until all ballots have \r\nbeen collected. Ballot papers marked “A”, “B” and “C” \r\nwill now be distributed. I request representatives to use \r\nonly those ballot papers that have been distributed. \r\n May I ask representatives to write clearly on the \r\nballot papers marked “A”, for the African and Asian-\r\nPacific States, the names of the three States for which \r\nthey wish to vote; on the ballot papers marked “B”, for \r\nthe Eastern European States, the name of the one State \r\nfor which they wish to vote; and on the ballot papers \r\nmarked “C”, for the Latin American and Caribbean \r\nStates, the name of the one State for which they wish to \r\nvote. \r\n A ballot will be declared invalid if it contains \r\nmore names of Member States from the relevant region \r\nthan the number of seats assigned to it. A ballot will \r\nalso be declared invalid if all the names of the Member \r\nStates on that ballot do not belong to the relevant \r\nregion. If a ballot paper contains names of Member \r\nStates that do not belong to that region, the ballot \r\nremains valid, but only the names of the Member \r\nStates that belong to the relevant region will be \r\ncounted. The names of Member States that do not \r\nbelong to that region will not be counted at all. \r\n At the invitation of the President, Mr. Baptista \r\n(Angola), Mr. Tegos (Greece), Mrs. Dockendorf \r\n(Luxembourg), Mr. Bonifaz (Peru), Ms. Popovici \r\n(Republic of Moldova) and Ms. Wairatpanij \r\n(Thailand) acted as tellers. \r\n A vote was taken by secret ballot. \r\n The meeting was suspended at 10.30 a.m. and \r\nresumed at 11.45 a.m. \r\n The President: The result of the voting is as \r\nfollows: \r\n Group A — African and Asian-Pacific States \r\n Number of ballot papers:   193 \r\n Number of invalid ballots:   0 \r\n Number of valid ballots:   193 \r\n Abstentions:     0 \r\n Number of members voting:  193 \r\n Required two-thirds majority:  129 \r\n Number of votes obtained: \r\n  Morocco     151 \r\n  Pakistan     129 \r\n  Togo      119 \r\n  Mauritania    98 \r\n  Kyrgyzstan    55 \r\n  Fiji      1 \r\n Group B — Eastern European States \r\n Number of ballot papers:   193 \r\n Number of invalid ballots:   0 \r\n Number of valid ballots:   193 \r\n Abstentions:     0 \r\n Number of members voting:  193 \r\n Required two-thirds majority:  129 \r\n Number of votes obtained: \r\n  Azerbaijan    74 \r\n  Slovenia     67 \r\n  Hungary     52 \r\n Group C — Latin America and the Caribbean States \r\n Number of ballot papers:   193 \r\n Number of invalid ballots:   0 \r\n Number of valid ballots:   193 \r\n Abstentions:     2 \r\n Number of members voting:  191 \r\n Required two-thirds majority:  128 \r\n Number of votes obtained: \r\n  Guatemala     191 \r\n Having obtained the required two-thirds majority, \r\nthe following States were elected members of the \r\nSecurity Council for a two-year term beginning \r\n1 January 2012: Guatemala, Morocco and \r\nPakistan. \r\n A/66/PV.37\r\n \r\n3 11-55830 \r\n \r\n The President: There remain two seats to be \r\nfilled, one from among the Group of African and \r\nAsian-Pacific States and one from among the Group of \r\nEastern European States. We shall therefore proceed to \r\nthe first restricted ballot. \r\n In accordance with established practice, there is \r\nan understanding to the effect that, of the three seats \r\nallocated to the Group of African and Asian-Pacific \r\nStates, two should be filled by African States and one \r\nby an Asian-Pacific State. As Morocco and Pakistan \r\nhave already been elected, the remaining seat for the \r\nGroup of African and Asian-Pacific States should be \r\nfilled by an African State. \r\n The second round of balloting shall be restricted \r\nto the two States from among the African and Asian-\r\nPacific States that were not elected but that obtained \r\nthe largest number of votes in the previous ballot, \r\nnamely, Togo and Mauritania; and to the two States \r\nfrom among the Eastern European States that were not \r\nelected but that obtained the largest number of votes in \r\nthe previous ballot, namely, Azerbaijan and Slovenia. \r\nThat is in accordance with rule 94 of the rules of \r\nprocedure. \r\n Before we begin the voting process, I should like \r\nto remind members that, pursuant to rule 88 of the \r\nrules of procedure of the General Assembly, no \r\nrepresentative shall interrupt the voting except on a \r\npoint of order on the actual conduct of the voting. \r\n We shall now begin the voting process. \r\n Ballot papers marked “A” and “B” will now be \r\ndistributed. May I ask representatives to write on the \r\nballot papers the names of the States for which they \r\nwish to vote. Ballot papers marked “A” for African and \r\nAsian-Pacific States will be declared invalid if they \r\ncontain the name of a State other than Mauritania or \r\nTogo, as well as if they contain the names of more than \r\none State. Ballot papers marked “B” for Eastern \r\nEuropean States will be declared invalid if they contain \r\nthe name of a State other than Azerbaijan or Slovenia, \r\nas well as if they contain the names of more than one \r\nState. \r\n At the invitation of the President, Mr. Baptista \r\n(Angola), Mr. Tegos (Greece), Mrs. Dockendorf \r\n(Luxembourg), Mr. Bonifaz (Peru), Ms. Popovici \r\n(Republic of Moldova) and Ms. Wairatpanij \r\n(Thailand) acted as tellers. \r\n A vote was taken by secret ballot. \r\n The meeting was suspended at 12.05 p.m. and \r\nresumed at 12.45 p.m. \r\n The President: The result of the voting is as \r\nfollows: \r\n Group A — African and Asian-Pacific States \r\n Number of ballot papers:   193 \r\n Number of invalid ballots:   0 \r\n Number of valid ballots:   193 \r\n Abstentions:     2 \r\n Number of members voting:  191 \r\n Required two-thirds majority:  128 \r\n Number of votes obtained: \r\n  Togo      119 \r\n  Mauritania    72 \r\n Group B — Eastern European States \r\n Number of ballot papers:   193 \r\n Number of invalid ballots:   5 \r\n Number of valid ballots:   188 \r\n Abstentions:     1 \r\n Number of members voting:  187 \r\n Required two-thirds majority:  125 \r\n Number of votes obtained: \r\n  Slovenia     97 \r\n  Azerbaijan    90 \r\n Since no candidate obtained the required two-\r\nthirds majority in the previous ballot, there remain two \r\nseats to be filled, one from among the Group of African \r\nand Asian-Pacific States and one from among the \r\nGroup of Eastern European States. We shall therefore \r\nproceed to the second restricted ballot. \r\n In accordance with established practice, there is \r\nan understanding to the effect that, of the three seats \r\nallocated to the Group of African and Asian-Pacific \r\nStates, two should be filled by African States and one \r\nby an Asian-Pacific State. As Morocco and Pakistan \r\nhave already been elected, the remaining seat for the \r\nGroup of African and Asian-Pacific States should be \r\nfilled by an African State. \r\n The third round of balloting shall be restricted to \r\nthe two States from among the African and Asian-\r\nPacific States that were not elected but that obtained \r\nthe largest number of votes in the previous ballot, \r\nnamely, Togo and Mauritania; and to the two States \r\nfrom among the Eastern European States that were not \r\nelected but that obtained the largest number of votes in \r\nthe previous ballot, namely, Azerbaijan and Slovenia. \r\nA/66/PV.37  \r\n \r\n11-55830 4 \r\n \r\nThat is in accordance with rule 94 of the rules of \r\nprocedure. \r\n Before we begin the voting process, I should like \r\nto remind members that, pursuant to rule 88 of the \r\nrules of procedure of the General Assembly, no \r\nrepresentative shall interrupt the voting except on a \r\npoint of order on the actual conduct of the voting. \r\n We shall now begin the voting process. \r\n Ballot papers marked “A” and “B” will now be \r\ndistributed. May I ask representatives to write on the \r\nballot papers the names of the States for which they \r\nwish to vote. Ballot papers marked “A” for African and \r\nAsian-Pacific States will be declared invalid if they \r\ncontain the name of a State other than Mauritania or \r\nTogo, as well as if they contain the names of more than \r\none State. Ballot papers marked “B” for Eastern \r\nEuropean States will be declared invalid if they contain \r\nthe name of a State other than Azerbaijan or Slovenia, \r\nas well as if they contain the names of more than one \r\nState. \r\n At the invitation of the President, Mr. Baptista \r\n(Angola), Mr. Tegos (Greece), Mrs. Dockendorf \r\n(Luxembourg), Mr. Bonifaz (Peru), Ms. Popovici \r\n(Republic of Moldova) and Ms. Wairatpanij \r\n(Thailand) acted as tellers. \r\n A vote was taken by secret ballot. \r\n The meeting was suspended at 12.55 p.m. and \r\nresumed at 1.25 p.m. \r\n The President: The result of the voting is as \r\nfollows: \r\n Group A — African and Asian-Pacific States \r\n Number of ballot papers:   193 \r\n Number of invalid ballots:    0 \r\n Number of valid ballots:   193 \r\n Abstentions:     1 \r\n Number of members voting:  192 \r\n Required two-thirds majority:  128 \r\n Number of votes obtained: \r\n  Togo      131 \r\n  Mauritania    61 \r\n Group B — Eastern European States \r\n Number of ballot papers:   193 \r\n Number of invalid ballots:   0 \r\n Number of valid ballots:   193 \r\n Abstentions:     1 \r\n Number of members voting:  192 \r\n Required two-thirds majority:  128 \r\n Number of votes obtained: \r\n  Slovenia     99 \r\n  Azerbaijan    93 \r\n Having obtained the required two-thirds majority, \r\nTogo was elected a member of the Security \r\nCouncil for a two-year term beginning 1 January \r\n2012. \r\n The President: There remains one seat to be \r\nfilled from among the Eastern European States. In \r\naccordance with the rules of procedure, we should \r\ncontinue with the series of restricted ballots. However, \r\nin view of the late hour, I propose that we postpone \r\nfurther balloting until 3.30 p.m. \r\n It was so decided. \r\n  The meeting rose at 1.30 p.m. \r\n"
