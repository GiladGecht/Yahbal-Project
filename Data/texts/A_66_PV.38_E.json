(Qatar) \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 3.45 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 113 (continued) \r\n \r\nElections to fill vacancies in principal organs \r\n \r\n (a) Election of five non-permanent members of  \r\nthe Security Council \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): As Members \r\nwill recall, at its 37th plenary meeting this morning, \r\nafter three rounds of balloting, including two rounds of \r\nrestricted balloting, the Assembly elected Guatemala, \r\nMorocco, Pakistan and Togo as members of the \r\nSecurity Council for a two-year term beginning on \r\n1 January 2012. \r\n There remains one seat to be filled from among \r\nthe Eastern European States. We shall therefore \r\nproceed to the third restricted ballot.  \r\n This fourth round of balloting shall be restricted \r\nto the two States from among the Eastern European \r\nStates that were not elected but obtained the largest \r\nnumber of votes in the previous ballot, namely, \r\nAzerbaijan and Slovenia. This is in accordance with \r\nrule 94 of the rules of procedure. \r\n Before we begin the voting process, I should like \r\nto remind members that, pursuant to rule 88 of the \r\nrules of procedure of the General Assembly, no \r\nrepresentative shall interrupt the voting except on a \r\npoint of order on the actual conduct of the voting. \r\n Ballot papers marked “B” will now be \r\ndistributed. May I ask representatives to write on the \r\nballot papers the name of the State for which they wish \r\nto vote. Ballot papers marked “B” for the Eastern \r\nEuropean States will be declared invalid if they contain \r\nthe name of a State other than Azerbaijan or Slovenia, \r\nas well as if they contain the name of more than one \r\nState. \r\n At the invitation of the President, Mr. Baptista \r\n(Angola), Mr. Tegos (Greece), Mrs. Dockendorf \r\n(Luxembourg), Mr. Bonifaz (Peru), Ms. Popovici \r\n(Republic of Moldova) and Ms. Wairatpanij \r\n(Thailand) acted as tellers. \r\n A vote was taken by secret ballot. \r\n The meeting was suspended at 3.55 p.m. and \r\nresumed at 4.15 p.m. \r\n The President: The result of the voting is as \r\nfollows: \r\n Group B — Eastern European States \r\n Number of ballot papers:   192 \r\n Number of invalid ballots:   0 \r\n Number of valid ballots:   192 \r\n Abstentions:     1 \r\n Number of members voting:  191 \r\n Required two-thirds majority:  128 \r\n Number of votes obtained: \r\n  Slovenia     98 \r\n  Azerbaijan    93 \r\n As no candidate has received the required two-\r\nthirds majority in the preceding ballot, there remains \r\none seat to be filled from among the Eastern Europe \r\nStates. We shall therefore proceed to a first unrestricted \r\nA/66/PV.38  \r\n \r\n11-55898 2 \r\n \r\nballot. This fifth round of balloting is in accordance \r\nwith rule 94 of the rules of procedure. \r\n May I remind the Assembly that any member \r\nState from among the Eastern European States may be \r\na candidate except outgoing members, those already \r\nmembers of the Security Council, and those just \r\nelected. To make this clear, apart from the permanent \r\nmembers of the Security Council, Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina cannot be voted for in the present \r\nballoting. \r\n Before we begin the voting process, I should like \r\nto remind members that, pursuant to rule 88 of the \r\nrules of procedure of the General Assembly, no \r\nrepresentative shall interrupt the voting except on a \r\npoint of order on the actual conduct of the voting. \r\n We shall now begin the voting process. \r\n Ballot papers marked “B” will now be \r\ndistributed.

We shall therefore proceed to a second \r\nunrestricted ballot. This sixth round of balloting is in \r\naccordance with rule 94 of the rules of procedure. \r\n May I remind the Assembly that any member \r\nState from among the Eastern European States may be \r\na candidate except outgoing members, those already \r\nmembers of the Security Council, and those just \r\nelected.

We shall therefore proceed to a fourth \r\nunrestricted ballot. This eighth round of balloting is in \r\naccordance with rule 94 of the rules of procedure. \r\n Before we begin the voting process, I should like \r\nto remind members that, pursuant to rule 88 of the \r\nrules of procedure of the General Assembly, no \r\nrepresentative shall interrupt the voting except on a \r\npoint of order on the actual conduct of the voting. \r\n We shall now begin the voting process. \r\n Ballot papers marked “B” will now be \r\ndistributed.

Ballot papers marked “B” for the Eastern \r\nEuropean States will be declared invalid if they contain \r\nthe name of more than one State. \r\n At the invitation of the President, Mr. Baptista \r\n(Angola), Mr. Tegos (Greece), Mrs. Dockendorf \r\n(Luxembourg), Mr. Bonifaz (Peru), Ms. Popovici \r\n(Republic of Moldova) and Ms. Wairatpanij \r\n(Thailand) acted as tellers. \r\n A vote was taken by secret ballot. \r\n The meeting was suspended at 5.50 p.m. and \r\nresumed at 6.05 p.m. \r\n The President: The result of the voting is as \r\nfollows: \r\n Group B — Eastern European States \r\n Number of ballot papers:   191 \r\n Number of invalid ballots:   0 \r\n Number of valid ballots:   191 \r\n Abstentions:     1 \r\n Number of members voting:  190 \r\n Required two-thirds majority:  127 \r\n Number of votes obtained: \r\n Azerbaijan     110 \r\n Slovenia      80 \r\n As no candidate has received the required two-\r\nthirds majority in the preceding ballot, there remains \r\none seat to be filled from among the Eastern Europe \r\nStates. We shall therefore proceed to a fifth \r\nunrestricted ballot. This ninth round of balloting is in \r\naccordance with rule 94 of the rules of procedure. \r\n However, in view of the late hour, balloting will \r\ncontinue on Monday, 24 October, in the morning \r\nimmediately after the election of the members of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council. \r\n I call on the representative of Azerbaijan on a \r\npoint of order. \r\nA/66/PV.38  \r\n \r\n11-55898 4 \r\n \r\n Mr. Mehdiyev (Azerbaijan): I wish to inform the \r\nAssembly that I have asked the Secretariat to prolong \r\nthe voting for an additional hour today. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I should like to \r\ninform the representative of Azerbaijan that, first, \r\nsimultaneous interpretation services will end shortly \r\nand that, secondly, we have received a request from the \r\ndelegation of Slovenia to adjourn the meeting. It shall \r\ntherefore be difficult to continue with the voting, and I \r\nsuggest that we proceed with the plan to resume voting \r\nfor the members of the Security Council on Monday, \r\n24 October 2011, following the election of the \r\nmembers of the Economic and Social Council. \r\n Mr. Mehdiyev (Azerbaijan) (spoke in Arabic): I \r\nwould point out that I made my request to the \r\nSecretariat a half-hour ago. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\nI would therefore ask you, Sir, to make an exception in \r\nthis case. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): We find \r\nourselves confronted with two conflicting requests. \r\nAlthough the time allotted for the voting today ran out \r\nat 6 p.m., and despite a request that we adjourn the \r\nmeeting following the latest round of balloting, we \r\nhave received another request that the voting be \r\nextended.  \r\n A decision in this matter is undoubtedly difficult \r\nto make. Given the fact that the time allocated to this \r\nmeeting has elapsed and that simultaneous \r\ninterpretation services will no longer be available, and \r\nalso given the importance of this matter, I refer this \r\nproblem to the members of the General Assembly to \r\ndecide the best way to proceed. \r\n Mr. Araud (France) (spoke in French): As you \r\nknow, Sir, it is the unwavering practice of my country’s \r\ndelegation to refuse to proceed with our work without \r\nsimultaneous interpretation services in all of the \r\nOrganization’s official languages. \r\n Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): We did not hear the proposal to continue the \r\nmeeting without simultaneous interpretation. As we \r\nunderstand it, interpretation services may be continued \r\nat the request of the President of the General Assembly. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): Although the \r\ntime allocated to this meeting has elapsed, I suggest we \r\ncontinue our work until we have completed a final \r\nround of voting. \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President: I repeat that, as no candidate has \r\nreceived the required two-thirds majority in the \r\npreceding ballot, there remains one seat to be filled \r\nfrom among the Eastern Europe States. We shall \r\ntherefore proceed to a fifth restricted ballot. This ninth \r\nround of balloting shall be restricted to the two States \r\nfrom among the Eastern European States that were not \r\nelected but obtained the largest number of votes in the \r\nprevious ballot, namely, Azerbaijan and Slovenia. This \r\nis in accordance with rule 94 of the rules of procedure. \r\n Before we begin the voting process, I should like \r\nto remind members that, pursuant to rule 88 of the \r\nrules of procedure of the General Assembly, no \r\nrepresentative shall interrupt the voting except on a \r\npoint of order on the actual conduct of the voting. \r\n We shall now begin the voting process. \r\n Ballot papers marked “B” will now be \r\ndistributed. May I ask representatives to write on the \r\nballot papers the name of the State for which they wish \r\nto vote. Ballot papers marked “B” for the Eastern \r\nEuropean States will be declared invalid if they contain \r\nthe name of a State other than Azerbaijan or Slovenia, \r\nas well as if they contain the name of more than one \r\nState. \r\n At the invitation of the President, Mr. Baptista \r\n(Angola), Mr. Tegos (Greece), Mrs. Dockendorf \r\n(Luxembourg), Mr. Bonifaz (Peru), Ms. Popovici \r\n(Republic of Moldova) and Ms. Wairatpanij \r\n(Thailand) acted as tellers. \r\n A vote was taken by secret ballot. \r\n The meeting was suspended at 6.40 p.m. and \r\nresumed at 6.55 p.m. \r\n The President: The result of the voting is as \r\nfollows: \r\n Group B — Eastern European States \r\n Number of ballot papers:    191 \r\n Number of invalid ballots:   0 \r\n Number of valid ballots:   191 \r\n Abstentions:     1 \r\n Number of members voting:  190 \r\n Required two-thirds majority:  127 \r\n Number of votes obtained: \r\n A/66/PV.38\r\n \r\n5 11-55898 \r\n \r\n  Azerbaijan    113 \r\n  Slovenia     77 \r\n As no candidate has received the required two-\r\nthirds majority in the preceding ballot, there remains \r\none seat to be filled from among the Eastern Europe \r\nStates. We shall therefore proceed to a sixth restricted  \r\n \r\nballot. This tenth round of balloting is in accordance \r\nwith rule 94 of the rules of procedure. \r\n However, in view of the late hour, balloting will \r\ncontinue on Monday, 24 October, in the morning \r\nimmediately after the election of the members of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council. \r\n  The meeting rose at 7 p.m. \r\n"
