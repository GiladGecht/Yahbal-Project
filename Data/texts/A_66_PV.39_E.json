May I take \r\nit that the General Assembly agrees to that procedure? \r\n It was so decided. \r\nA/66/PV.39  \r\n \r\n11-56028 2 \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): In accordance \r\nwith rule 92 of the rules of procedure of the General \r\nAssembly, the election shall be held by secret ballot \r\nand there shall be no nominations. We shall now \r\nproceed accordingly. \r\n I should like to inform members that, as of \r\n1 January 2012, the following States from the Group of \r\nEastern European States and the Group of Western \r\nEuropean and other States will be represented on the \r\nEconomic and Social Council: Australia, Canada, \r\nFinland, Italy, Latvia, the Russian Federation, \r\nSlovakia, Ukraine, the United Kingdom of Great \r\nBritain and Northern Ireland and the United States of \r\nAmerica. The names of those 10 States should \r\ntherefore not appear on the ballot. \r\n Before we begin the voting process, I should like \r\nto remind members that, pursuant to rule 88 of the \r\nrules of procedure of the General Assembly, no \r\nrepresentative shall interrupt the voting except on a \r\npoint of order on the actual conduct of the voting. In \r\naddition, ballot papers will only be distributed to the \r\nrepresentatives seated directly behind the country’s \r\nnameplate. \r\n We shall now begin the voting process. Members \r\nare requested to remain seated until all ballots have \r\nbeen collected. \r\n Allow me to remind members that they are now \r\nvoting in the by-election for one seat for the Group of \r\nEastern European States and two seats for the Group of \r\nWestern European and other States. The election of \r\n18 members of the Council will take place immediately \r\nfollowing this by-election. \r\n Ballot papers marked with the letters A and B will \r\nnow be distributed. I request representatives to use \r\nonly those ballot papers and to write on them the \r\nnames of the States for which they wish to vote. A \r\nballot will be declared invalid if it contains more \r\nnames of Member States from the relevant region than \r\nthe number of seats assigned to it. A ballot will also be \r\ndeclared invalid if all the names of the Member States \r\non that ballot do not belong to the relevant region. \r\n At the invitation of the President, Ms. Apeyitou \r\n(Cyprus), Ms. Reyes (Honduras), Mr. Macchia \r\n(Italy), Ms. Mwaura (Kenya), Ms. Šćepanović \r\n(Montenegro) and Mrs. Sulimani (Sierra Leone) \r\nacted as tellers. \r\n A vote was taken by secret ballot. \r\n The meeting was suspended at 10.25 a.m. and \r\nresumed at 11 a.m. \r\n The President: The result of the voting is as \r\nfollows: \r\n Group B — Eastern European States \r\nNumber of ballot papers:   189 \r\nNumber of invalid ballots:   2 \r\nNumber of valid ballots:   187 \r\nAbstentions:     11 \r\nNumber of members voting:  176 \r\nRequired two-thirds majority:  118 \r\nNumber of votes obtained: \r\n Bulgaria     150 \r\n Belarus     24 \r\n Hungary     2 \r\n Group C — Western European and other States \r\nNumber of ballot papers:   189 \r\nNumber of invalid ballots:   1 \r\nNumber of valid ballots:   188 \r\nAbstentions:     8 \r\nNumber of members voting:  180 \r\nRequired two-thirds majority:  120 \r\nNumber of votes obtained: \r\n Switzerland    161 \r\n Netherlands    159 \r\n France     13 \r\n Germany     9 \r\n Turkey     4 \r\n Belgium     2 \r\n Ireland     2 \r\n Spain     2 \r\n Malta     1 \r\n Norway     1 \r\n Sweden     1 \r\n Having obtained the required two-thirds majority, \r\nBulgaria, the Netherlands and Switzerland were \r\nelected members of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil for a term of office beginning on \r\n1 January 2012 and ending on 31 December \r\n2012, in the case of the Netherlands, and \r\n31 December 2013 in the cases of Bulgaria and \r\nSwitzerland. \r\n The President: I congratulate Bulgaria, the \r\nNetherlands and Switzerland on having been elected \r\nmembers of the Economic and Social Council. \r\n The General Assembly will next turn to the \r\nelection of 18 members of the Economic and Social \r\n A/66/PV.39\r\n \r\n3 11-56028 \r\n \r\nCouncil to replace those members whose term of office \r\nexpires on 31 December 2011. \r\n The 18 outgoing members are: Côte d’Ivoire, \r\nEstonia, France, Germany, Guatemala, Guinea-Bissau, \r\nIndia, Japan, Malta, Mauritius, Morocco, Namibia, \r\nPeru, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saudi Arabia, Spain, \r\nSwitzerland and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. \r\nPursuant to rule 146 of the rules of procedure, those \r\ncountries are eligible for immediate re-election. \r\n Members will recall that Belgium, Hungary and \r\nNorway relinquished their seats on the Council, \r\neffective 1 January 2012, and that Bulgaria, the \r\nNetherlands and Switzerland have just been elected to \r\nfill those vacancies. \r\n Consequently, as of 1 January 2012, the \r\nfollowing States will be represented on the Economic \r\nand Social Council: Argentina, Australia, the Bahamas, \r\nBangladesh, Bulgaria, Cameroon, Canada, Chile, \r\nChina, the Comoros, Ecuador, Egypt, Finland, Gabon, \r\nGhana, Iraq, Italy, Latvia, Malawi, Mexico, Mongolia, \r\nthe Netherlands, Nicaragua, Pakistan, the Philippines, \r\nQatar, the Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation, \r\nRwanda, Senegal, Slovakia, Switzerland, Ukraine, the \r\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, \r\nthe United States of America and Zambia. The names \r\nof those 36 States should therefore not appear on the \r\nballots. \r\n In accordance with paragraph 4 of resolution \r\n2847 (XXVI), of 20 December 1971, and taking into \r\naccount the number of States that will remain members \r\nof the Council after 1 January 2012, the 18 members \r\nshould be elected as follows: five from African States, \r\nthree from Asian and Pacific States, one from Eastern \r\nEuropean States, four from Latin American and \r\nCaribbean States and five from Western European and \r\nother States. The ballot papers reflect that pattern. \r\n I should like to inform the General Assembly that \r\nthose candidates — their number not exceeding the \r\nnumber of seats to be filled — that receive a two-thirds \r\nmajority and the greatest number of votes by members \r\npresent and voting, will be declared elected. Consistent \r\nwith past practice, in the case of a tie vote for a \r\nremaining seat, there will be a special restricted ballot \r\nlimited to those candidates that obtained an equal \r\nnumber of votes. \r\n May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to \r\nthat procedure? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President: In accordance with rule 92 of the \r\nrules of procedure, the election shall be held by secret \r\nballot and there shall be no nominations. \r\n With regard to candidatures of the respective \r\nregional groups, the Secretariat has been informed of \r\nthe following. For the five vacant seats from among the \r\nAfrican States, the Group has endorsed five candidates: \r\nBurkina Faso, Ethiopia, Lesotho, Libya and Nigeria. \r\nFor the three vacant seats from among the Asian and \r\nPacific States, the Group has endorsed three \r\ncandidates: India, Indonesia and Japan. For the one \r\nvacant seat from among the Eastern European States, \r\nthe Group has endorsed Belarus. For the four vacant \r\nseats from among the Latin American and Caribbean \r\nStates, the Group has endorsed four candidates: Brazil, \r\nCuba, the Dominican Republic and El Salvador. For \r\nthe five vacant seats from among the Western European \r\nand other States, the Group has endorsed five \r\ncandidates: France, Germany, Ireland, Spain and \r\nTurkey. \r\n In accordance with rule 92 of the rules of \r\nprocedure, we shall now proceed to the election by \r\nsecret ballot. \r\n We shall now begin the voting process. Ballot \r\npapers marked A, B, C, D and E will now be \r\ndistributed. I request representatives to use only those \r\nballot papers and to write on them the names of the \r\nStates for which they wish to vote. \r\n A ballot will be declared invalid if it contains \r\nmore names of Member States from the relevant region \r\nthan the number of seats assigned to it. A ballot will \r\nalso be declared invalid if none of the names of the \r\nMember States on that ballot belongs to the relevant \r\nregion. If a ballot paper of a region contains names of \r\nMember States that do not belong to that region, the \r\nballot remains valid, but only the names of the Member \r\nStates that belong to the relevant region will be \r\ncounted. The names of Member States that do not \r\nbelong to that region will not be counted at all. \r\n At the invitation of the President, Ms. Apeyitou \r\n(Cyprus), Ms. Reyes (Honduras), Mr. Macchia \r\n(Italy), Ms. Mwaura (Kenya), Ms. Šćepanović \r\n(Montenegro) and Mrs. Sulimani (Sierra Leone) \r\nacted as tellers. \r\n A vote was taken by secret ballot. \r\nA/66/PV.39  \r\n \r\n11-56028 4 \r\n \r\n The meeting was suspended at 11.20 a.m. and \r\nresumed at 12:30 p.m. \r\n The President: The result of the voting is as \r\nfollows: \r\n Group A — African States \r\nNumber of ballot papers:   193 \r\nNumber of invalid ballots:   0 \r\nNumber of valid ballots:   193 \r\nAbstentions:     0 \r\nNumber of members voting:  193 \r\nRequired two-thirds majority:  129 \r\nNumber of votes obtained: \r\n Burkina Faso    193 \r\n Ethiopia     189 \r\n Lesotho     189 \r\n Nigeria     188 \r\n Libya     177 \r\n Group B — Asian and Pacific States \r\nNumber of ballot papers:   193 \r\nNumber of invalid ballots:   0 \r\nNumber of valid ballots:   193 \r\nAbstentions:     0 \r\nNumber of members voting:  193 \r\nRequired two-thirds majority:  129 \r\nNumber of votes obtained: \r\n Indonesia     191 \r\n India      189 \r\n Japan     186 \r\n Afghanistan    1 \r\n Group C — Eastern European States \r\nNumber of ballot papers:   193 \r\nNumber of invalid ballots:   3 \r\nNumber of valid ballots:   190 \r\nAbstentions:     18 \r\nNumber of members voting:  172 \r\nRequired two-thirds majority:  115 \r\nNumber of votes obtained: \r\n Belarus     172 \r\n Group D — Latin American and Caribbean States \r\nNumber of ballot papers:   193 \r\nNumber of invalid ballots:   1 \r\nNumber of valid ballots:   192 \r\nAbstentions:     1 \r\nNumber of members voting:  191 \r\nRequired two-thirds majority:  128 \r\nNumber of votes obtained: \r\n Dominican Republic   188 \r\n El Salvador    187 \r\n Brazil      186 \r\n Cuba      183 \r\n Group E — Western European and other States \r\nNumber of ballot papers:   193 \r\nNumber of invalid ballots:   0 \r\nNumber of valid ballots:   193 \r\nAbstentions:     2 \r\nNumber of members voting:  191 \r\nRequired two-thirds majority:  128 \r\nNumber of votes obtained: \r\n Spain     182 \r\n France     181 \r\n Germany     181 \r\n Ireland      181 \r\n Turkey     179 \r\n Belgium     1 \r\n Norway     1 \r\n Having obtained the required two-thirds majority \r\nof members present and voting, the following \r\n18 States were elected members of the Economic \r\nand Social Council for a three-year term \r\nbeginning on 1 January 2012: Belarus, Brazil, \r\nBurkina Faso, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, \r\nEl Salvador, Ethiopia, France, Germany, India, \r\nIndonesia, Ireland, Japan, Lesotho, Libya, \r\nNigeria, Spain and Turkey. \r\n The President: I congratulate the States that have \r\nbeen elected members of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil, and I thank the tellers for their assistance in \r\nthis election. \r\n This concludes our consideration of sub-item (b) \r\nof agenda item 113. \r\n \r\n (a) Election of five non-permanent members of the \r\nSecurity Council \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): As members \r\nwill recall, at its 37th and 38th plenary meetings, held \r\non 21 October, following nine rounds of balloting, \r\nincluding five rounds of restricted balloting and three \r\nrounds of unrestricted balloting, the General Assembly \r\nelected Guatemala, Morocco, Pakistan and Togo as \r\nmembers of the Security Council for a two-year term \r\nof office beginning on 1 January 2012. \r\n There remains one seat to be filled from among \r\nthe Group of Eastern European States. We shall \r\ntherefore proceed to the sixth restricted ballot. In \r\naccordance with rule 94 of the rules of procedure, this \r\n A/66/PV.39\r\n \r\n5 11-56028 \r\n \r\ntenth round of balloting shall be restricted to the two \r\nStates from among the Eastern European States that \r\nwere not elected but obtained the largest number of \r\nvotes in the previous ballot, namely, Azerbaijan and \r\nSlovenia. \r\n We will now begin the voting process. Ballot \r\npapers marked B will now be distributed. May I ask \r\nrepresentatives to write on the ballot papers the name \r\nof the State for which they wish to vote. Ballot papers \r\nmarked B, for the Eastern European States, will be \r\ndeclared invalid if they contain the name of a State \r\nother than Azerbaijan or Slovenia, as well as if they \r\ncontain the name of more than one State. \r\n At the invitation of the President, Mr. Baptista \r\n(Angola), Mr. Tegos (Greece), Mrs. Dockendorf \r\n(Luxembourg), Ms. Popovici (Republic of \r\nMoldova), Mr. Bonifaz (Peru) and Ms. Wairatpanij \r\n(Thailand) acted as tellers. \r\n A vote was taken by secret ballot. \r\n The meeting was suspended at 12.45 p.m. and \r\nresumed at 1 p.m. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): The result of \r\nthe voting is as follows: \r\n Group B — Eastern European States \r\nNumber of ballot papers:   193 \r\nNumber of invalid ballots:   0 \r\nNumber of valid ballots:   193 \r\nAbstentions:     0 \r\nNumber of members voting:  193 \r\nRequired two-thirds majority:  129 \r\nNumber of votes obtained: \r\n Azerbaijan    110 \r\n Slovenia     83 \r\n As the result of this ballot has been inconclusive, \r\nthere remains one seat to be filled from among the \r\nGroup of Eastern European States in accordance with \r\nthe rules of procedure. We shall therefore proceed to a \r\nfourth unrestricted ballot — the eleventh round of \r\nballoting — in accordance with rule 94 of the rules of \r\nprocedure. That ballot will take place this afternoon at \r\n3 p.m. \r\n  The meeting rose at 1.05 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
