The \r\nAssembly must therefore proceed to a fourth \r\nunrestricted ballot. This eleventh round of balloting is \r\nin accordance with rule 94 of the rules of procedure. \r\n May I remind the Assembly that any Member \r\nState from among the Eastern European States may be \r\na candidate except outgoing members, those already \r\nmembers of the Security Council, as well as those just \r\nelected. To make this clear, in addition to the \r\npermanent members of the Security Council, Bosnia \r\nand Herzegovina cannot be voted for in the present \r\nballoting. \r\n Before we begin the voting process, I should like \r\nto remind members that, pursuant to rule 88 of the \r\nrules of procedure of the General Assembly, no \r\nrepresentative shall interrupt the voting except on a \r\npoint of order on the actual conduct of the voting. In \r\naddition, ballot papers will be given only to the \r\nrepresentative seated directly behind the country’s \r\nnameplate. \r\n We shall now begin the voting process. \r\n Ballot papers marked “B” will now be \r\ndistributed. May I ask representatives to write on the \r\nballot papers the name of the State for which they wish \r\nto vote. Ballot papers marked “B” for the Eastern \r\nEuropean States will be declared invalid if they contain \r\nthe name of more than one State. \r\n At the invitation of the President, Mr. Baptista \r\n(Angola), Mr. Tegos (Greece), Mrs. Dockendorf \r\n(Luxembourg), Mr. Bonifaz (Peru), Ms. Popovici \r\n(Republic of Moldova) and Ms. Wairatpanij \r\n(Thailand) acted as tellers. \r\n A vote was taken by secret ballot. \r\n The meeting was suspended at 3.25 p.m. and \r\nresumed at 3.45 p.m. \r\n The President: The result of the voting is as \r\nfollows: \r\n Group B — Eastern European States \r\n Number of ballot papers:   193 \r\n Number of invalid ballots:   0 \r\n Number of valid ballots:   193 \r\n Abstentions:     1 \r\n Number of members voting:  192 \r\n Required two-thirds majority:  128 \r\n Number of votes obtained: \r\n  Azerbaijan    110 \r\n  Slovenia     82 \r\n As no candidate has received the required two-\r\nthirds majority in the preceding ballot, there remains \r\none seat to be filled from among the Eastern Europe \r\nStates. We shall therefore proceed to a fifth \r\nA/66/PV.40  \r\n \r\n11-56157 2 \r\n \r\nunrestricted ballot. This twelfth round of balloting is in \r\naccordance with rule 94 of the rules of procedure. \r\n Before we begin the voting process, I should like \r\nto remind members that ballot papers will be given \r\nonly to the representative seated directly behind the \r\ncountry’s nameplate.  \r\n We shall now begin the voting process. \r\n Ballot papers marked “B” will now be \r\ndistributed.

Our campaign was always for Slovenia and \r\nthe values we represent. We were never campaigning \r\nagainst any other candidate.  \r\n We do not approve of the way this campaign was \r\nrun, and we do not approve of the way these elections \r\nwere held. However, the current result speaks for itself \r\nand the object of this body’s support is obvious. I am \r\ntherefore withdrawing our candidature.
