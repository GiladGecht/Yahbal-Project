(Qatar) \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 41 \r\n \r\nNecessity of ending the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/66/114) \r\n \r\n  Draft resolution (A/66/L.4) \r\n \r\n Mr. Limeres (Argentina): I have the honour to \r\ndeliver this statement on behalf of the Group of 77 and \r\nChina on agenda item 41, entitled “Necessity of ending \r\nthe economic, commercial and financial embargo \r\nimposed by the United States of America against \r\nCuba”. \r\n At the outset, I would like to welcome the \r\npresence of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Cuba, \r\nMr. Bruno Eduardo Rodríguez Parrilla. \r\n Last year, the announcements made by the \r\nGovernment of the United States related to a relaxation \r\nof certain restrictions on travel and the transfer of \r\nremittances had given many of us hope that steps were \r\nstarting to be taken in the right direction. Nevertheless, \r\none year has since passed and it is clear that those \r\nmeasures have had a very limited effect and that the \r\nembargo is still in place. \r\n In fact, the embargo remains largely unchanged \r\nand continues to impose severe economic and financial \r\nrestrictions on Cuba. The embargo has caused, and \r\ncontinues to cause, a high degree of economic and \r\nfinancial damage, which has a negative impact on the \r\nwell-being of the people of Cuba. \r\n Furthermore, the deepening impact of the \r\nongoing global economic and financial crisis and the \r\ncontinued embargo by the Government of the United \r\nStates will contribute to further aggravating the \r\nhardships of the people of Cuba. Moreover, the \r\nembargo frustrates efforts towards the achievement of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals and negatively \r\naffects regional cooperation in that area. \r\n The Group of 77 and China states once again, as \r\nit has on many previous occasions, that the embargo \r\nagainst Cuba contravenes the fundamental norms of \r\ninternational law, international humanitarian law, the \r\nUnited Nations Charter and the rules and principles \r\ngoverning peaceful relations among States. Its \r\ncontinued imposition violates the principles of the \r\nsovereign equality of States and of non-intervention \r\nand non-interference in each other’s domestic affairs. \r\n The Group of 77 and China has always been \r\nfirmly against the embargo. At the second South \r\nSummit, held in Doha from 12 to 16 June 2005, heads \r\nof State and Government of the Group of 77 and China \r\nfirmly rejected the imposition of laws and regulations \r\nwith extraterritorial impact and all other forms of \r\ncoercive economic measures, including unilateral \r\nsanctions against developing countries. They called \r\nupon the Government of the United States to put an \r\nend to the economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo against Cuba, which, in addition to being \r\nunilateral and contrary to the United Nations Charter \r\nA/66/PV.41  \r\n \r\n11-56249 2 \r\n \r\nand international law — and to the principle of good-\r\nneighbourliness — causes huge material loses and \r\neconomic damage to the people of Cuba. \r\n Today, the Group of 77 and China would like to \r\nreiterate once again its long-standing position on this \r\nimportant matter by quoting the ministerial declaration \r\nof the thirty-fifth annual meeting of our Ministers for \r\nForeign Affairs, held here at Headquarters on \r\n23 September: \r\n  “The Ministers firmly reject the imposition \r\nof laws and regulations with extraterritorial \r\nimpact and all other forms of coercive economic \r\nmeasures, including unilateral sanctions against \r\ndeveloping countries, and reiterate the urgent \r\nneed to eliminate them immediately. They \r\nemphasize that such actions not only undermine \r\nthe principles enshrined in the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations and international law, but also \r\nseverely threaten the freedom of trade and \r\ninvestment. They therefore called on the \r\ninternational community neither to recognize \r\nthese measures nor apply them.” (A/66/388, \r\nannex, para. 39) \r\n We recall that last year 187 Member States voted \r\nin favour of the draft resolution introduced by Cuba \r\n(resolution 65/6). That number represented a large \r\nmajority of the international community demanding the \r\nend to the five-decades-old embargo and to fully \r\nadhere to the principles of mutual respect and \r\nnon-interference in the internal affairs of a sisterly \r\ncountry. \r\n The Group of 77 and China is committed to \r\nworking towards a better world for all in which \r\nnations, large or small, can coexist peacefully. The \r\nachievement of such peaceful coexistence among \r\nnations requires adherence by all nations to the \r\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter and the \r\npeaceful conduct of relations among nations. The \r\nachievement of such peaceful coexistence among \r\nnations requires adherence by all nations to the rule of \r\nlaw, including international law. \r\n The Group of 77 and China will again fully \r\nsupport draft resolution A/66/L.4 against the embargo \r\nand urges all Member States to do so as well. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): Before giving \r\nthe floor to the next speaker, given the long list of \r\nspeakers inscribed on my list, I should like to propose \r\nthat the list of speakers for the debate on this item now \r\nbe closed. Unless I hear any objection, I shall take it \r\nthat the Assembly agrees to this proposal. \r\n It was so decided. \r\n Mr. Abdelaziz (Egypt): I have the pleasure to \r\naddress the General Assembly today on behalf of the \r\n120 Members of the United Nations that are members \r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement.  \r\n I would like first to extend our deep condolences \r\nto the Government and people of Turkey for the tragic \r\nloss of life as a result of the devastating earthquake \r\nthat struck the eastern part of Turkey two days ago. We \r\nextend our condolences also to the Government and \r\npeople of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia on the passing \r\naway of His Royal Highness Prince Sultan Bin \r\nAbdulaziz Al-Saud.  \r\n Allow me now to extend a warm welcome to \r\nMr. Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of Cuba, and to express to him the Movement’s \r\nfull support and solidarity. \r\n It has been 12 months since we last gathered here \r\nin the Hall to consider and debate the important agenda \r\nitem “Necessity of ending the economic, commercial \r\nand financial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba”. Those 12 extraordinary \r\nmonths have witnessed unexpected and profound \r\nchanges in many parts of the world, all sparked by an \r\nentrenched longing for justice that has been for too \r\nlong unduly denied. It is the Movement’s deep \r\nconviction that the application of the principle of \r\njustice should not be confined to the national level but \r\nshould also be extended to the international arena. It \r\nshould not only govern relations between individuals \r\nbut also between Member States. \r\n Did the peoples of the United Nations not declare \r\nin its Charter’s preamble their determination to \r\n“establish conditions under which justice … can be \r\nmaintained”? It is for that reason that the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement finds it utterly troubling that to this day the \r\nscrews of an unfair and unwarranted blockade, which \r\nhas been in force for over half a century, are still being \r\ntightened against one of the Movement’s members, and \r\nthat unilateral measures and coercive laws are still \r\nbeing adopted and implemented against it. \r\n The Movement unequivocally rejects such blatant \r\nviolations of multilateralism, which run counter to the \r\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter and the norms \r\n A/66/PV.41\r\n \r\n3 11-56249 \r\n \r\nof international law, respect for sovereignty and \r\nterritorial integrity, good neighbourliness and mutual \r\ntrust — and the Movement calls for their immediate \r\nend. We appeal to all States to continue to refrain from \r\nrecognizing such measures or laws and to support the \r\nclaim of affected countries to compensation for any \r\ndamage incurred as a result of this breach of \r\ninternationally agreed norms of conduct. \r\n The Non-Aligned Movement once again \r\nreiterates its call for full respect by all Member States \r\nof the crucial principle of justice in international \r\nrelations. The Movement also reaffirms its steadfast \r\ncommitment to uphold, preserve and promote all \r\npurposes and principles enshrined in the United \r\nNations Charter, as well as to ensure the continued \r\nviability of all the provisions of international law, \r\nwhich together form the core of our multilateral work \r\nand inspire our collective efforts to maintain peace and \r\nsecurity, achieve inclusive economic growth and \r\nsustainable development and ensure full respect for \r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms. \r\n The United States Administration has in the past \r\nclaimed that it would reach out to the Cuban people \r\nand engage with them. Yet those once-encouraging \r\nwords have regrettably not been translated into \r\nconcrete actions. The punitive measures imposed \r\nagainst the whole Cuban nation persist, and with them \r\nthe enduring suffering of its brave people. \r\n The direct and indirect damage caused by the \r\nembargo against Cuba are enormous. They affect all \r\ncrucial sectors of the economy, including those most \r\nvital for the well-being of the Cuban people \r\nthemselves, such as public health, nutrition and \r\nagriculture, as well as banking, trade, investment and \r\ntourism. It is true that Cuba has made significant \r\nprogress in many areas, especially in education, health \r\ncare and gender equality — and we salute the Cubans \r\nfor what they have achieved so far despite the huge \r\ndifficulties they encounter — yet we stress once again \r\nthat the embargo imposed continues to impede \r\nsocio-economic advances and creates unnecessary \r\neconomic hardship. \r\n Moreover, this unilateral blockade has an \r\nextended negative effect on companies and citizens \r\nfrom third countries, thereby violating their sovereign \r\nrights. The Non-Aligned Movement reiterates its deep \r\nconcern at the harmful impact on other countries of \r\nwidening the extra-territorial nature of the embargo, \r\nwhich we consider an added argument in favour of the \r\nprompt elimination of those unfounded sanctions. \r\n The Non-Aligned Movement is astounded as to \r\nwhy such an unjust and unfounded embargo is still \r\nmaintained when 187 Member States of the United \r\nNations voted last year in favour of resolution 65/6, \r\ncalling for its immediate lifting — the nineteenth such \r\nresolution to be adopted by the Assembly on the issue. \r\nWhy are such punitive measures maintained when \r\nevidence indicates that they hinder Cuba’s efforts to \r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals and \r\nsustainable development? Why should the Cuban \r\npeople continue to suffer when the international \r\ncommunity is almost unanimous in its conviction that \r\nthe cause of their anguish is unjustified and illegal? \r\n In reality, there are no credible answers to these \r\nquestions, because the embargo imposed against Cuba \r\nis simply politically and economically untenable and, \r\nabove all, morally indefensible. It is for those reasons \r\nthat the Non-Aligned Movement once again urges the \r\nUnited States of America to immediately and fully \r\ncomply with all General Assembly resolutions calling \r\nfor an immediate end to the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed against Cuba and, once and \r\nfor all, to listen to the will of the overwhelming \r\nmajority of the international community, which will \r\ntoday vote in favour of the of the draft resolution on \r\nthe necessity of ending the embargo against Cuba. \r\n During his Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech \r\nin Norway in December 2009, President Barack Obama \r\nasserted that “Our actions matter, and can bend history \r\nin the direction of justice.” The President of the United \r\nStates had also declared a few months earlier, during a \r\ntrip to Latin America in April 2009, that “the United \r\nStates seeks a new beginning with Cuba”. Today, the \r\nMovement once again urges the United Sates to match \r\nthose words with action by swiftly lifting the unjust \r\nembargo it is imposing against Cuba, thereby allowing \r\nthe arc of history to bend towards justice in \r\ninternational relations and enabling the valiant people \r\nof Cuba to fully prosper and enjoy their sovereignty, \r\nindependence and right to self-determination. \r\n Mr. Kamau (Kenya): I have the honour to speak \r\non behalf of the African Group, which aligns itself with \r\nthe statements made on behalf of the Group of 77 and \r\nChina and of the Non-Aligned Movement. We wish to \r\nacknowledge the presence of His Excellency Mr. Bruno \r\nA/66/PV.41  \r\n \r\n11-56249 4 \r\n \r\nRodríguez Parrilla, Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nCuba. \r\n At the outset, I would like to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report on the agenda item entitled \r\n“Necessity of ending the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba” (A/66/114). Over the years, the \r\nGeneral Assembly, while deliberating on this agenda \r\nitem, has categorically and overwhelmingly rejected \r\nthe imposition of laws and regulations with \r\nextraterritorial impact. Africa shares the views \r\nexpressed by the international community in its \r\ncontinued opposition to the sanctions and embargo \r\nagainst Cuba. \r\n The General Assembly has also called upon all \r\nStates, in conformity with their obligations under the \r\nUnited Nations Charter and international law, to refrain \r\nfrom promulgating and applying, as well as to repeal or \r\ninvalidate, laws and measures that have extraterritorial \r\neffects affecting the sovereignty of other States, the \r\nlegitimate interests of entities or persons under their \r\njurisdiction and the freedom of trade and navigation. \r\nRepeated calls by the international community to that \r\neffect remain unheeded. The sad, tragic and decades-\r\nold United States embargo on Cuba, including its \r\nextraterritorial aspects, continues to remain in force. \r\n In the report of the Secretary-General of \r\n16 August, the majority of United Nations Members, \r\nincluding from the African continent and various \r\nUnited Nations entities, categorically rejected the \r\nimposition of the embargo on Cuba and called for its \r\nlifting. \r\n Given their proximity, Cuba and the United States \r\nof America should be natural partners in trade, \r\ncommerce and investment. Given the large number of \r\nAmericans of Cuban extraction, Cuba and the United \r\nStates should also enjoy warm and fraternal relations in \r\nsocial and cultural affairs between their populations. \r\nThe potential for those economic, commercial and \r\ncultural ties between the two nations has, however, \r\nsadly remained unrealized. \r\n Whatever the historical roots of this \r\nintergenerational embargo imposed on Cuba, surely the \r\ntime has come when, in a globalized, interdependent \r\nworld, nations ought to find the courage, the foresight \r\nand the sense of global citizenry and leadership that \r\nwould help to drive the resolve to overcome \r\ndifferences and nurture coexistence in a manner that \r\nspeaks to the high global ideals of the international \r\ncommunity in the twenty-first century. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to reiterate Africa’s \r\nopposition to unilateral measures that impinge on the \r\nsovereignty of another country, including attempts to \r\nextend the application of a country’s laws \r\nextraterritorially to other sovereign nations. The heads \r\nof State and Government of the African Union (AU), at \r\ntheir meeting in July in Malabo, Equatorial Guinea, \r\nreiterated the AU Summit’s earlier call on the \r\nGovernment of the United States of America to lift the \r\nlong-standing and unjustifiable economic and trade \r\nembargo imposed on Cuba, and thereby enable it to \r\nenjoy all the legitimate prospects for its sustained \r\ndevelopment. \r\n Once again, Africa calls for the complete and \r\nunequivocal lifting of sanctions and the embargo \r\nagainst Cuba. \r\n Mrs. Coye-Felson (Belize): I have the honour to \r\naddress the General Assembly on behalf of the \r\n14 member States of the Caribbean Community \r\n(CARICOM), which also aligns itself with the \r\nstatements made on behalf of the Group of 77 and \r\nChina, and the Non-Aligned Movement. \r\n CARICOM member States continue to reiterate \r\ntheir unequivocal opposition to the United States’ \r\nimposition of the economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo against Cuba, an embargo that the \r\noverwhelming majority of the international community \r\nhas consistently opposed for the past 19 years. The \r\nunilateral imposition of extraterritorial laws on third \r\nStates is contrary to both the letter and the spirit of the \r\nUnited Nations Charter, and the embargo itself runs \r\ncounter to the principles that the United Nations and all \r\nMember States have traditionally championed: the \r\nprinciples of multilateralism, international law, \r\nsovereignty and free trade. \r\n The stubborn persistence of the embargo is \r\napparently impervious to the sustained chorus of \r\ninternational criticism and to the logic of a world that \r\nhas changed immeasurably over the five decades since \r\nthe imposition of the blockade. The embargo has now \r\noutlived the cold war by 20 years. It has outlasted the \r\nterms of eight Presidents of the United States of \r\nAmerica and even that of Cuban President Fidel \r\nCastro. More than 70 per cent of Cubans alive today \r\nwere born under the embargo. CARICOM considers \r\nthe embargo an anachronism that has succeeded only in \r\n A/66/PV.41\r\n \r\n5 11-56249 \r\n \r\ncontributing to the suffering of generations of ordinary \r\nCubans and in unnecessarily increasing tensions \r\nbetween the United States and Cuba. It serves no \r\njustifiable legal, political or moral purpose in the \r\ntwenty-first century. \r\n The punitive embargo is of particular concern to \r\nCARICOM, which shares a history, culture, solidarity \r\nand kinship with the people of Cuba. Cuba is the most \r\npopulous State of the Caribbean region and an integral \r\npart of the pan-Caribbean process. Caribbean ties with \r\nCuba have historical significance, cemented by years \r\nof active cooperation at various levels. CARICOM \r\nmember States continue to maintain close relations \r\nwith Cuba through a wide range of programmes of \r\ncooperation in areas including trade, health care, \r\ninfrastructure and human resource development. In \r\nmany ways, our future regional development is reliant \r\nupon our collective advancement and progress. In that \r\ncontext, the embargo is not just a punitive act against \r\nCuba, but an impediment to our shared regional \r\ndevelopment in the wider Caribbean. \r\n This year’s report of the Secretary-General \r\n(A/66/114) on the implementation of the resolution on \r\nthis issue, like previous reports on this matter, outlines \r\nresponses from the vast majority of Member States, \r\nwhich share a common perspective on the continued \r\nunilateral embargo against Cuba. Indeed, the report \r\nmakes clear that the embargo even affects the manner \r\nin which organs and agencies of the United Nations \r\nsystem carry out their work in Cuba. \r\n CARICOM member States therefore, in \r\nreaffirming the positions of the Group of 77 and China \r\nas well as the Non-Aligned Movement, maintain that \r\nconstructive engagement and peaceful negotiations are \r\nthe only acceptable means of advancing long-term \r\npeace and stability. \r\n There is probably no single issue upon which the \r\nUnited Nations has made such sustained, strong and \r\nunambiguous pronouncements as with the resolutions \r\ncondemning the embargo against Cuba. Yet the \r\nembargo continues, in the face of overwhelming \r\ninternational reproach. The continued disregard of \r\nthese resolutions represents a blot on the credibility \r\nand efficacy of the United Nations. CARICOM \r\nmember States thus reiterate the view that additional \r\nmechanisms could be explored to operationalize the \r\nwords of the resolution and facilitate the process that \r\nwill end this continued indifference to the will of the \r\ninternational community. \r\n The significance of the embargo for the Cuban \r\neconomy continues to be of great concern to \r\nCARICOM, and the humanitarian impact on the people \r\nof Cuba, especially in the area of health care and food, \r\nis especially saddening. The inability of Cuba to \r\nacquire necessary medical equipment, spare parts and \r\nlatest-generation medications, because of the embargo, \r\ncontinues to affect the health-care system, where \r\ntreatment remains free of charge to the Cuban people. \r\nWith the strengthening and more frequent storms and \r\nhurricanes wrought by climate change, and Cuba’s \r\ngeographic susceptibility to such natural disasters, the \r\nhumanitarian impact of the embargo becomes even \r\nmore acute.  \r\n Additionally, construction materials and heavy \r\nequipment are becoming increasingly inaccessible to \r\nCuba because of stringent rules of origin and \r\nrestrictions against corporations based outside of the \r\nUnited States. The negative effects on the Cuban \r\neconomy and its growth are tangible. The embargo has \r\nnow cost Cuba over $100 billion since its 1962 \r\nimposition. In the wake of the ongoing global \r\neconomic meltdown, the unilateral measures against \r\nthe Cuban people are now even more harsh and \r\nindefensible. \r\n It is remarkable that, even as Cuba struggles with \r\na recent unfortunate string of natural disasters and the \r\ncontinuing impacts of the global economic crisis, it \r\ncontinues to assist other nations in the developing \r\nworld, starting with its immediate Caribbean \r\nneighbours. Thousands of Caribbean students have \r\nattended Cuban universities without charge; thousands \r\nmore have received free surgeries and medical \r\nassistance in Cuba; and thousands have been treated in \r\ntheir home countries by Cuban doctors and nurses. We \r\nhave benefited from technical expertise, capacity-\r\nbuilding programmes and infrastructural assistance, \r\nand from the selfless generosity of the Cuban people. \r\nThe people of Cuba have threatened no one, and \r\nneither the embargo nor its deleterious side-effects has \r\nprevented them from continually extending a hand of \r\nfriendship and solidarity, even across ideological \r\ndivides. On behalf of CARICOM member States, we \r\nalso take this opportunity to thank the people of Cuba \r\nfor their tremendous and selfless assistance in the wake \r\nof last year’s devastating earthquake in Haiti. \r\nA/66/PV.41  \r\n \r\n11-56249 6 \r\n \r\n Given Cuba’s peaceful, generous and cooperative \r\ninternational stance, CARICOM reiterates its support \r\nfor the right of the Cuban people to self-determination, \r\nin a manner beneficial to their social and economic \r\ndevelopment. \r\n CARICOM member States continue to enjoy \r\nfriendly relations with both Cuba and the United \r\nStates. Those two neighbours — a mere 90 miles \r\napart — have produced great scholars, scientists and \r\nglobal leaders. The two countries possess proud and \r\nnoble histories, and are populated by friendly, open and \r\nloving peoples. As such, in spite of a long history of \r\ndashed hopes, CARICOM remains guardedly \r\noptimistic that a new beginning is possible in the \r\nrelationship between the Governments of Cuba and the \r\nUnited States. However, we consider the lifting of the \r\nembargo to be a prerequisite for any meaningful \r\nrapprochement between the two countries, not a \r\nnegotiated end-result. While there have been some \r\nrecent positive indications of flexibility, there have \r\nalso been reminders of unilateral rigidity. \r\n We remain hopeful that the United States’ recent \r\nrecommitment to multilateralism will result an in \r\nincreased willingness to consider the opinions and \r\nconcerns of its global friends and partners. On this \r\nissue, global opinion could hardly be conveyed in a \r\nmore convincing or consistent manner. As such, our \r\nfaith in the recent pronouncements of the United States \r\nGovernment carries with it an expectation that these \r\nfew remaining historical and unilateral wrongs will be \r\nrighted expeditiously. \r\n It is within this context that CARICOM member \r\nStates unstintingly support draft resolution A/66/L.4 on \r\nthe necessity of ending the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo by the United States of America \r\nagainst Cuba. \r\n Mrs. Aitimova (Kazakhstan): I have the pleasure \r\nof delivering the following statement on behalf of the \r\nmembers of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation \r\n(OIC), in my country’s capacity as Chair of the OIC \r\nGroup. \r\n At the outset, I should like to express to Turkey \r\nour sympathy and deepest condolences in connection \r\nwith the devastating earthquake that struck the country \r\nlast Sunday, causing a number of deaths and \r\nwidespread damage. \r\n Let me also convey our shared sorrow to the \r\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia in connection with the \r\ndemise of His Royal Highness Prince Sultan Bin \r\nAbdulaziz Al-Saud, Crown Prince, Deputy Prime \r\nMinister and Minister of Defence and Aviation. \r\n I should like to express our appreciation to the \r\nSecretary-General for his report entitled “Necessity of \r\nending the economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo imposed by the United States of America \r\nagainst Cuba” (A/66/114). \r\n As all are aware, although the United Nations, \r\nvarious international forums and non-governmental \r\norganizations have for a long time tirelessly and \r\nrepeatedly expressed the rejection by the international \r\ncommunity of the unilateral sanctions, this issue \r\nremains a critical one on the United Nations agenda. \r\n Bearing that in mind, I should like to address this \r\nissue once again on behalf of the Organization of \r\nIslamic Cooperation Group in New York. \r\n OIC activities are guided by the principles of \r\ninternational law, and we support the right of every \r\nnation to follow its own unique way of development. In \r\nthis regard, the OIC group condemns any unilateral \r\nacts that affect the sovereignty and interests of another \r\nState and its people. We do not agree with any external \r\nregulations that infringe on, impede or retard the \r\ndevelopment of any country, including in the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial spheres. \r\n The OIC wishes to emphasize that the imposition \r\nof arbitrary, unilateral laws contradicts the regulations \r\nand directions of the World Trade Organization, which \r\nprohibit the adoption of measures likely to hinder free \r\ninternational trade and shipping so as to allow the \r\nwidest possible partnership between the two sides. \r\n Finally, the OIC, like the overwhelming majority \r\nof the international community, calls for lifting the \r\nembargo on Cuba in accordance with the principles and \r\npurposes of the United Nations Charter and the \r\nappropriate General Assembly resolutions. \r\n Mr. Cancela (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): It is \r\nan honour for the delegation of Uruguay to speak on \r\nbehalf of the MERCOSUR States: Argentina, Brazil, \r\nParaguay and Uruguay; the acceding State the \r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela; and the associated \r\nStates Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. \r\n A/66/PV.41\r\n \r\n7 11-56249 \r\n \r\n I would like to welcome among us the presence \r\nof the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Cuba, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla.  \r\n MERCOSUR was founded on the principles of \r\nsolidarity, interdependence and good-neighbourliness. \r\nWe believe that tolerance is the basis that has enabled \r\nthe historic convergence on our continent of peoples \r\nfrom all corners of the world. We are linked to our \r\nLatin American neighbours by the desire to live in \r\npeace and to promote mutual understanding, to defend \r\nthe independence, the equality and sovereignty of \r\nStates, and to promote respect for international law. \r\nThose ideals, which have historically guided relations \r\namong the Latin American States and societies, are \r\nenshrined in the charter of the Organization of \r\nAmerican States.  \r\n We regret that the blockade policy against Cuba \r\nremains unchanged. We have even seen increased \r\nrestrictions on Cuba’s financial transactions with third \r\ncountries. We regret that conditionalities once again \r\nobstruct the path towards a greater openness to direct \r\ndialogue. \r\n The measures announced last year by the \r\nAmerican Government with respect to easing \r\nrestrictions on travel and remittances, among other \r\nthings, were positively received in this forum, because \r\nthey were headed in the right direction. Those \r\nmeasures, however, have not brought with them a \r\nsubstantial change in the blockade policy; they are \r\ninsufficient and have a limited scope. \r\n MERCOSUR and its associated States understand \r\nthat the embargo against Cuba is contrary to the \r\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter and \r\ncontravenes the rules of international law, in particular \r\nthe equality of States, non-intervention in domestic \r\naffairs, the peaceful settlement of disputes and the \r\nnorms of the multilateral trade system, which link the \r\nmembers of the World Trade Organization. \r\n This embargo, which is contrary to the principle \r\nof justice and human rights, represents collective \r\npunishment that produces shortages and suffering for \r\nthe population, limits and delays development and \r\nseriously harms the Cuban economy. \r\n The MERCOSUR States parties and associated \r\nStates reject unilateral and extraterritorial measures as \r\na matter of principle. We condemn the application of \r\ncoercive unilateral measures that are contrary to free \r\ntrade, cause irremediable damage to people’s welfare \r\nand obstruct the processes of regional integration. \r\n Reaffirming once more our unwavering support \r\nfor draft resolution A/66/L.4, MERCOSUR and its \r\nassociated States reiterate our commitment to \r\nmultilateralism as a legitimate instrument for the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes and as an effective path \r\nin the promotion of international cooperation and \r\nunderstanding among peoples. The economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed against \r\nCuba is an example of obsolete policies that have no \r\nplace today. By adopting this draft resolution, the \r\nAssembly will provide further proof of its unwavering \r\npolitical will in defence of the ideals of freedom, \r\nsolidarity and respect for sovereignty and international \r\nlaw. \r\n Mr. Ahamed (India): Thank you, Mr. President, \r\nfor giving me this opportunity to address the General \r\nAssembly.  \r\n My delegation associates itself with the \r\nstatements made by the representative of Argentina on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China and by the \r\nrepresentative of Egypt on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement. \r\n We meet yet again to deliberate on the agenda \r\nitem entitled “Necessity of ending the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the \r\nUnited States against Cuba”. For all these years, the \r\nAssembly has repeatedly rejected the imposition of \r\nlaws and regulations with extraterritorial impact and all \r\nother kinds of coercive economic measures that hurt \r\nthe progress and prosperity of people the world over. \r\n The Assembly has also called upon States to \r\nrespect their obligations under the United Nations \r\nCharter and international law, and to repeal and \r\ninvalidate laws and measures that have extraterritorial \r\neffects on other States. It is unfortunate that, in spite of \r\nthe General Assembly’s yearly rejection of the United \r\nStates embargo against Cuba, the embargo remains in \r\nfull force. We see such enforcement as a violation of \r\nworld opinion and as an act that severely undermines \r\nmultilateralism and the credibility of the United \r\nNations itself. \r\n The more than half-century-old United States \r\nembargo on Cuba has brought immense suffering to the \r\nCuban people. It has severely undermined the progress \r\nand development of the country. The embargo, which \r\nA/66/PV.41  \r\n \r\n11-56249 8 \r\n \r\nlikely has no parallel in history, is a transgression of \r\nthe right of a sovereign State to development and to \r\nenjoy freedom of trade, economy and navigation. \r\n On the one hand, we, the global community, \r\nmake tall promises with respect to the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and on striving for human dignity \r\nand achieving equitable growth, but when it comes to \r\nactions, we do the exact opposite of what we promise. \r\nThe embargo has denied a life of dignity and basic \r\nstandards of living to the people of Cuba. Actions must \r\nspeak louder than words. \r\n The embargo, particularly through its \r\nextraterritorial effects, has adversely affected the \r\neconomic prosperity of the Cuban people. The global \r\neconomic slowdown, along with spiralling food and \r\nenergy prices, has made matters worse. The embargo \r\nhas denied Cuba access to United States markets, \r\ninvestment, technology and financial services, and to \r\nscientific, educational, cultural and sporting \r\ninstitutions. Cuba has had to pay enormous extra costs \r\nfor sourcing products, technology and services from \r\nthird countries located thousands of kilometres away. \r\n The extraterritorial application of the United \r\nStates embargo has discouraged investment, \r\ntechnology transfer and commercial and other forms of \r\nbusiness collaborations between Cuba and third \r\ncountries. The prohibition of technology and related \r\nscientific support, particularly through the \r\nextraterritorial application of the embargo, has severely \r\nimpacted health care, a fundamental part of the \r\ncommitments contained in the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, in Cuba. It has also undermined \r\nCuba’s ability to provide health assistance to \r\ndeveloping countries as part of South-South \r\ncooperation. \r\n The report of the Secretary General on the agenda \r\nitem under consideration (A/66/114) illustrates the \r\ndetrimental impact that the embargo has had on \r\ninternational efforts to undertake socio-economic \r\nprogress in Cuba. The United Nations Resident \r\nCoordinator in Havana has noted the high cost and \r\nnegative impact of the embargo on the humanitarian \r\nand development cooperation implemented by the \r\nUnited Nations system in Cuba. \r\n There is a huge potential for strengthening \r\neconomic and commercial ties between Cuba and the \r\nUnited States. Taking advantage of limited openings \r\nunder the United States Trade Sanctions Reform and \r\nExport Enhancement Act of 2000, the United States has \r\nbecome the largest exporter of agricultural products to \r\nCuba. Congressional efforts in the United States to \r\nrelax or lift the embargo lend further credence to the \r\nannual United Nations resolutions calling for the lifting \r\nof the United States embargo against Cuba. People-to-\r\npeople contacts between the two countries remain \r\nseverely curtailed. \r\n The steps taken by the United States \r\nAdministration in January to reduce restrictions on \r\ntravel and remittances to Cuba are positive \r\ndevelopments. However, the United States is far from \r\nmaking a fundamental change in the complex of laws \r\nand regulations that form the framework of the \r\nembargo against Cuba. Much more needs to be done. \r\n India joins other nations in calling for an \r\nimmediate end to the United States embargo against \r\nCuba. India supports the draft resolution to be \r\nintroduced shortly by the representative of Cuba \r\n(A/66/L.4). \r\n Mr. Alurralde Tejada (Plurinational State of \r\nBolivia) (spoke in Spanish): I would like to begin by \r\nstating that Bolivia associates itself with the statements \r\nmade on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement, the \r\nGroup of 77, and the Southern Common Market. \r\n The Cold War came to an end in 1989, and the \r\nfear of a nuclear war that would not only have been the \r\nmost devastating ever, but would have been the last \r\nwar ever because it would have led to the end of \r\nhumankind, vanished. However, now we find ourselves \r\nfacing other threats, such as climate change, which \r\nstrike equal fear in our hearts.  \r\n However, here at the United Nations we are today \r\ndiscussing a sad aftertaste of the Cold War whose \r\ncontinued existence we still cannot comprehend. On \r\n26 June 1963, President Kennedy addressed the \r\ncitizens of Berlin in order to tell them that they were \r\nliving in a fortified island of liberty. That island was \r\ndefended with all the resources made possible by a \r\nblockade, which sought to undermine the city’s \r\nresistance and was overcome through the establishment \r\nof an air bridge organized by the Western Powers. We \r\ndo not understand how one of the countries that once \r\ncondemned that blockade with such force today \r\nperseveres in maintaining a decades-long blockade \r\nagainst the sisterly Republic of Cuba.  \r\n A/66/PV.41\r\n \r\n9 11-56249 \r\n \r\n We therefore wish today to refashion the words of \r\nPresident Kennedy for the beloved Cuban people, who \r\nare resisting the United States embargo. The \r\nemblematic phrase of freedom at that time was “I am a \r\nBerliner”. We say to the Cuban people that the \r\nemblematic phrase for the defence of life in the \r\ntwentieth century is “I am a Cuban”. Only a heroic \r\npeople determined never to surrender its right to \r\nsovereignty and to freely choose its destiny without \r\nforeign interference, such as the Cuban people, can \r\nserve as inspiration and example to future generations. \r\n I am a Cuban. That is for us, the free peoples of \r\nthe world, a symbol of pride in our time. Certainly, \r\nsince the United States imposed its blockade against \r\nCuba, all of us in the Hall, with very few exceptions, is \r\na Cuban. Those who claim that they are defenders of \r\ndemocracy are unaware of the democracy that exists \r\nhere within the United Nations. How many more times \r\nwill we have to vote against the blockade for it to be \r\nsuspended? How many more times will the world have \r\nto tell the United States what it thinks of the blockade, \r\nwith none of our demands being fulfilled? If we truly \r\nbelieve in democracy, then let us start by heeding the \r\nwill of the countries represented here in the Hall.  \r\n For all of those reasons, the Plurinational State of \r\nBolivia thanks the Secretary-General for his report \r\ndated 16 August (A/66/114) and fully supports the draft \r\nresolution contained in document A/66/L.4. \r\n Mr. De Alba (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): First \r\nand foremost, allow me to thank the Secretary-General \r\nfor his detailed report on this issue (A/66/114), which \r\nonce again highlights the international community’s \r\nbroad rejection of the embargo imposed by the United \r\nStates of America against Cuba. For the twentieth \r\nconsecutive time, the Government of Mexico returns to \r\nthis forum to repeat its opposition to the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo against Cuba and to \r\nreiterate its opposition to the use of coercive measures \r\nthat are in violation of international law, which \r\ntherefore have no basis in the Charter of the United \r\nNations. \r\n The application of unilateral extraterritorial \r\nmeasures in third countries leads to severe \r\nhumanitarian consequences that blatantly contradict the \r\nobjectives that supposedly inspire them. They also \r\nrepresent a rejection of negotiation, diplomacy and \r\ndialogue as the appropriate means to resolve disputes \r\nbetween States. \r\n Various organs and entities in the United Nations \r\nsystem have documented the negative impact of the \r\nembargo on Cuba’s economic and social development, \r\nas has the Secretary-General’s report. Its damaging \r\neffects are evident in Cuba’s economic, commercial \r\nand financial transactions. It harms sensitive sectors \r\nthat directly impact the lives of the people and also has \r\nnegative repercussions on third countries, due to the \r\ndifficulty of interacting with Cuba in many economic \r\nand social activities. \r\n Mexico has therefore supported all initiatives \r\nagainst the embargo and related unilateral measures, \r\nboth in the General Assembly and in the United \r\nNations Conference on Trade and Development and \r\nother forums, such as the Organization of American \r\nStates, the Latin American Economic System, the \r\nIbero-American Summit and the Rio Group. We shall \r\ncontinue to support the inclusion of Cuba in \r\nmechanisms for dialogue and for global economic, \r\ncommercial and financial exchanges, in line with the \r\nwill and sovereign decisions of that country, in order to \r\npromote cooperation and development.  \r\n Our close ties with Cuba and the Cuban people, \r\nas well as our own convictions, make us understand the \r\nurgent need for the blockade to end. We must not \r\nforget that political, economic or military sanctions \r\nimposed on States may emanate only from the \r\ndecisions or recommendations of the Security Council \r\nor the General Assembly.  \r\n For Mexico, multilateralism remains the best \r\nroute for resolving disputes and guaranteeing peaceful \r\ncoexistence among States. In the case before us today, \r\nthe practically unanimous rejection by the international \r\ncommunity proves us right. For that reason, Mexico \r\nwill, as we have always done, support the draft \r\nresolution submitted for our consideration in this \r\nsession.  \r\n Mr. Valero Briceño (Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela) (spoke in Spanish): The Bolivarian \r\nRepublic of Venezuela endorses the statements made \r\nby the Permanent Representative of Egypt on behalf of \r\nthe Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, the \r\nrepresentative of Argentina on behalf of the Group of \r\n77 and China, and the Permanent Representative of \r\nUruguay on behalf of the Southern Common Market. \r\n We wish to convey our condolences to the \r\nGovernment of Saudi Arabia on the passing away of \r\nCrown Prince Sultan Bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud, as well as \r\nA/66/PV.41  \r\n \r\n11-56249 10 \r\n \r\nto the Government of Turkey on the earthquake that \r\ncaused such death and destruction. \r\n We would like to welcome the presence at this \r\nmeeting of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Cuba, \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla. \r\n Member States have issued a nearly universal call \r\nin this forum for an end to the economic, commercial \r\nand financial embargo that for more than 50 years has \r\nsought to restrict the right of the Cuban people to \r\ndecide their fate. This is an unequivocal sign that it is \r\nnecessary to defend the principles of political \r\nindependence that underlie the Organization. It is \r\nshameful that this call has been ignored year after year \r\nby those who frequently violate international law. \r\n We reiterate Venezuela’s strong rejection of the \r\napplication of any unilateral measure with \r\nextraterritorial effects that violates the rules and \r\nprinciples of international law. We support the various \r\npronouncements made in that regard by numerous \r\nforums around the world.  \r\n On this occasion, we cannot forget the Cuban \r\ncitizens Gerardo Hernández, Ramón Labatiño, Antonio \r\nGuerrero and Fernando González Llorét, who are still \r\ndetained in the United States for defending their \r\nhomeland from possible terrorist attacks; likewise, \r\nRené González, who was released but forced to remain \r\nin this country under an unjust regime of supervised \r\nrelease. Just as we demand, in the strongest terms, the \r\nend of the blockade against Cuba, we also request the \r\nrelease of these four heroes who remain in prison. \r\nTheir continued detention contrasts with the freedom \r\nthat confessed terrorists such as Luis Posada Carriles \r\nenjoy in the United States. We appeal for René \r\nGonzález to be allowed to return to his homeland and \r\nto be reunited with his family. \r\n Although the United States Administration has \r\ntried to convince international public opinion that it is \r\npromoting a change in its policies towards Cuba, the \r\nembargo against the island remains intact. \r\n Both the Torricelli and the Helms-Burton Acts, \r\nwhich prevent trade between Cuba and United States \r\ncompanies and their subsidiaries in third countries, \r\ncontinue in force. So too does the threat of sanctions \r\nagainst entrepreneurs who, availing themselves of the \r\nfree enterprise policy that the United States \r\nGovernment so much defends, decide to invest in \r\nCuba. President Barack Obama has not taken any \r\nmeasures to ease the commercial blockade, some of \r\nwhich do not require congressional authorization for \r\nimplementation. \r\n The blockade against Cuba is not an abstract \r\ndevice applied against a Government. On the contrary, \r\nit has dramatic impacts on the daily lives of women \r\nand men, children and elderly, and it represents a \r\nmassive violation of the human rights of a dignified \r\nand sovereign people. \r\n The blockade negatively affects the quality of life \r\nof sick people who must do without drugs or access to \r\nhigh-tech equipment whose sale is prohibited on the \r\nisland by the United States Administration. The \r\nblockade is also felt in the obstacles the Cuban people \r\nface in enjoying their basic housing rights, since it \r\nprevents the importing of building materials necessary \r\nfor replacing and repairing the huge number of \r\nbuildings and homes damaged by hurricanes. \r\n Every year the blockade generates losses in the \r\nmillions of dollars in Cuba’s basic industry — in the \r\nsugar industry, in iron and steel and machinery, in \r\ntourism. All that affects the quality of life of the Cuban \r\npeople. A conservative estimate of the direct economic \r\ndamage caused by the embargo, through December \r\n2009, places it at more than $100.154 billion. That \r\nfigure would increase to $239.533 billion if it were \r\nrecalculated based on retail price inflation in the \r\nUnited States. In the face of the blockade and its \r\nterrible economic and social consequences, Cuba and \r\nthe heroic Cuban people have moved forward with a \r\ngenerous policy of cooperation with other countries of \r\nthe South. \r\n The blockade therefore unquestionably represents \r\nthe repeated and unilateral denial by one signatory to \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations of the right to \r\ndevelopment of another State Member and its people, \r\nwithout any hostilities directed at the aggressor State \r\non the part of the State being attacked. In an \r\ninternational environment characterized by ongoing \r\nthreats to the sovereignty of States is constantly \r\nthreatened, and where systematic violations of \r\ninternational law threaten brotherly and cooperative \r\nrelations between peoples, it is more necessary than \r\never that we demand the end of the shameful blockade \r\nof Cuba. \r\n It is time to end double standards in the \r\napplication of international justice. We cannot allow \r\nthe vilification of the weak for being so, or any \r\n A/66/PV.41\r\n \r\n11 11-56249 \r\n \r\ntoleration of violations on the part of the imperialists of \r\nthe North. These are the demands of the peoples of the \r\nworld, echoed by the Bolivarian Government of \r\nVenezuela. It is time that the universal cry demanding \r\nthe lifting of the blockade against the heroic Cuban \r\npeople be heard. Venezuela therefore supports, in the \r\nmost resolute terms, the adoption of draft resolution \r\nA/66/L.4, which affirms the necessity of ending the \r\nblockade imposed by the United States of America on \r\nCuba. \r\n Mr. Wang Min (China) (spoke in Chinese): Let \r\nme begin by welcoming the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on this agenda item (A/66/114). \r\n The Chinese delegation associates itself with the \r\nstatement made by the representative of Argentina on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China. \r\n For 19 consecutive years, the General Assembly \r\nhas adopted by an overwhelming majority resolutions \r\non the necessity of ending the economic, commercial \r\nand financial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica on Cuba, urging all countries to abide by the \r\nUnited Nations Charter and international law and to \r\nrepeal or invalidate any laws or measures with \r\nextraterritorial implications that affect the sovereignty \r\nof other States, the legitimate interests of entities or \r\npersons under their jurisdiction, and their freedom of \r\ntrade and navigation. \r\n Regrettably, however, those resolutions have not \r\nbeen effectively implemented over the years, and the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed \r\non Cuba by the United States has yet to be lifted. Such \r\npractices not only severely violate the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations and the \r\nrelevant General Assembly resolutions, they have also \r\ninflicted enormous economic and financial losses on \r\nCuba. According to figures cited in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report, by December 2010 the economic \r\nlosses to Cuba resulting directly from the embargo \r\nexceeded $975 billion. \r\n The sanctions and embargo have severely \r\nhindered the Cuban people’s efforts to eradicate \r\npoverty, promote economic and social development \r\nand meet the Millennium Development Goals. They \r\nhave violated the Cuban people’s basic human right to \r\nfood, health and education, as well as their right to \r\nsurvival and development, and have affected normal \r\neconomic, commercial and financial relations between \r\nCuba and other countries. The international community \r\nis currently dealing with multiple serious challenges, \r\nsuch as the financial, food and energy crises and \r\nclimate change, which make the sanctions and embargo \r\nagainst Cuba all the more unreasonable. The \r\ninternational community’s call on the United States \r\nGovernment to change its policy, lift the embargo and \r\nnormalize bilateral relations with Cuba is growing ever \r\nlouder. \r\n The Chinese Government has always believed \r\nthat countries should develop mutual relations on the \r\nbasis of upholding the purposes and principles of the \r\nUnited Nations Charter and respect for the right of \r\nother countries to independently choose their own \r\nsocial system and development path. China is opposed \r\nto any unilateral sanctions against other countries by \r\nmilitary, political, economic or other means. \r\nMeanwhile, China has strictly observed and \r\nimplemented the relevant General Assembly \r\nresolutions. China and Cuba have maintained normal \r\neconomic, trade and people-to-people exchanges. \r\nFriendly and mutually beneficial cooperation in \r\nvarious areas between our two countries has been \r\ngrowing. This is not only in accordance with the desire \r\nof both peoples but is also conducive to Cuba’s social \r\nand economic development. \r\n In today’s world, dialogue, exchange and \r\nharmonious coexistence represent the mainstream of \r\ninternational relations. Exchanges on an equal footing \r\nbetween countries have become the dominant trend. In \r\nthe face of differences, dialogue on an equal footing \r\nand amicable consultation are the best way of settling \r\ndisputes. China hopes that the United States will \r\nadhere to the purposes and principles of the United \r\nNations Charter and the relevant General Assembly \r\nresolutions, and end its embargo against Cuba as soon \r\nas possible. China also hopes that relations between the \r\nUnited States and Cuba will continue to improve in \r\norder to improve stability in the Latin-American and \r\nCaribbean region.  \r\n China will once more vote in favour of the draft \r\nresolution (A/66/L.4) submitted by Cuba under this \r\nagenda item. \r\n Mr. Benmehidi (Algeria): Algeria aligns itself \r\nwith the statements made on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement, the Group of 77 and China, the \r\nOrganization of Islamic Cooperation and the African \r\nGroup. I would like to welcome and acknowledge the \r\npresence in the Hall of His Excellency Mr. Bruno \r\nA/66/PV.41  \r\n \r\n11-56249 12 \r\n \r\nRodríguez Parrilla, Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nCuba. \r\n Algeria would once again like to express its deep \r\nconcern at the continuation of the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo unilaterally \r\nimposed for half a century now by the United States of \r\nAmerica on Cuba. The continuing annual adoption by \r\nan overwhelming majority of General Assembly \r\nMember States of a similar resolution calling for lifting \r\nthe embargo against Cuba reflects the profound desire \r\nof the international community to put an end to this \r\nsituation, which has lasted far too long. \r\n In accordance with the principles of its foreign \r\npolicy, Algeria has always condemned the imposition \r\nof unilateral acts, extraterritorial regulations that \r\nhinder the development of any country, and all \r\ncoercive economic and trade measures — such as the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo against \r\nCuba, which is openly contrary to international law and \r\nthe purposes and principles of the Charter of the United \r\nNations. Every Member State should respect the \r\nprinciples of the Charter, including in particular the \r\nsovereign equality of States, territorial integrity, non-\r\nintervention and non-interference in the internal affairs \r\nof any other State. \r\n It is a well-established fact that the embargo \r\naffects Cuba’s economic growth and impedes its social \r\nand human development. In that regard, it is causing \r\nhuge material losses and economic damage to Cuba, \r\nand creating economic hardship, which is exacerbated \r\nby the adverse effects of the current global economic \r\nand financial crisis, as well as the energy and food \r\ncrises, which have seriously compromised Cuba’s \r\nefforts to improve its level of development. That has \r\nalso affected the food-based safety nets of the Cuban \r\nGovernment, which are instrumental to household food \r\nsecurity, as the Secretary-General stated in his report.  \r\n According to estimates by the Cuban Government \r\nthat have been confirmed by the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme, cumulative direct and \r\nindirect losses to the Cuban economy over 50 years \r\nhave amounted to more than $100 billion. \r\n In accordance with the long-standing position of \r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement on this issue, Algeria \r\nrejects the use of economic measures of coercion and \r\nthe extraterritorial application of laws on developing \r\ncountries, and urges the Government of the United \r\nStates of America to put an end to the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo against Cuba, in \r\ncompliance with the General Assembly resolutions \r\nadopted annually on this issue. \r\n Accordingly, Algeria will support the draft \r\nresolution contained in document A/66/L.4, presented \r\nby Cuba.  \r\n Mr. Mashabane (South Africa): At the outset, \r\nSouth Africa would like to align itself with the \r\nstatements delivered by the representatives of \r\nArgentina, Egypt and Kenya on behalf of the Group of \r\n77 and China, the Non-Aligned Movement and the \r\nGroup of African States, respectively. My delegation \r\nacknowledges the presence of His Excellency \r\nMr. Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of Cuba, at this meeting of the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n The question of ending the economic, commercial \r\nand financial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba has been, and continues to be, a \r\npersistent problem for the United Nations despite the \r\nmany calls for its elimination. The Assembly’s \r\nrecorded vote results (see resolution 65/6) at its \r\nprevious session, of 187 in favour and 2 against the \r\nembargo is a clear indication that the time has come for \r\nit to be lifted. The untold economic and social \r\nsuffering of the Cuban civilian population, who bear \r\nthe brunt of this injustice, must end. My delegation \r\nviews the continued blockade as a flagrant violation of \r\nthe principle of the sovereign equality of States and \r\nnon-intervention and non-interference in their domestic \r\naffairs. Furthermore, the blockade constitutes a \r\nviolation of international law and its imposition shows \r\ndisregard for the noble and abiding principles \r\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. \r\n It is therefore against that backdrop that South \r\nAfrica has repeatedly joined the majority of countries \r\nin expressing opposition to all aspects of the blockade \r\nand the unilateral action of the United States of \r\nAmerica. South Africa once again reiterates its support \r\nfor the lifting of the embargo against Cuba. \r\n The situation is further aggravated by the global \r\nfinancial and economic crisis, energy crisis and food \r\ncrisis, as well as challenges of climate change, which \r\nhave affected many countries, including Cuba. The \r\nembargo directly hinders Cuba’s economic recovery \r\nand negatively impacts trade, tourism, foreign direct \r\ninvestment and currency transfers. The damage caused \r\n A/66/PV.41\r\n \r\n13 11-56249 \r\n \r\nto the Cuban economy is estimated to exceed \r\n$975 billion in the future. \r\n South Africa is deeply concerned over the \r\nwidening of the extra-territorial nature of the embargo \r\nand rejects the reinforcement of the measures aimed at \r\nits tightening, as well as all other recent measures \r\ncarried out by the United States of America against the \r\npeople of Cuba. \r\n My delegation condemns the seizing by the \r\nUnited States, in January, of more than $4.2 million of \r\nfunding from the Global Fund to fight AIDS, \r\nTuberculosis and Malaria, which was earmarked for the \r\nimplementation of cooperation projects with Cuba. \r\n We support the content of the press release dated \r\n18 October by the Permanent Mission of the Republic \r\nof Cuba to the United Nations concerning the \r\nintensification of sanctions and extra-territorial \r\npersecution of citizens, institutions and companies in \r\nthird countries that establish economic, commercial, \r\nfinancial, scientific and technical ties with Cuba. My \r\ndelegation is strongly opposed to the actions of the \r\nUnited States with regard to fines levied against \r\nforeign banking institutions for having conducted \r\noperations with Cuba. \r\n The people of South Africa, and Africa in \r\ngeneral, have fond memories of the heroic \r\ncontributions of Cuba to the struggles against \r\ncolonization, oppression and apartheid. In an attempt to \r\nfoster trade with Cuba, South Africa is finalizing its \r\nproposal to offer a credit line of about $10 million to \r\nCuba. That would be a breakthrough in trade \r\ncooperation relations and would reaffirm South \r\nAfrica’s commitment and ongoing support for Cuba. \r\n The international community recognizes Cuba’s \r\noutstanding work in the areas of health, education and \r\nbiotechnology in Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa \r\nand the underdeveloped world in particular, and in the \r\nworld in general. The embargo stifles those outstanding \r\ncontributions to economic and social development and \r\nhinders the betterment of the lives of the poor. \r\n South Africa calls on all Member States to \r\nsupport the lifting of the United States of America’s \r\nembargo against Cuba and to refrain from recognizing \r\nthe unilateral measures and laws of a coercive nature \r\nthat defy the principles of the Charter of the United \r\nNations and norms of international law. \r\n Mr. Le Hoai Trung (Viet Nam): The General \r\nAssembly has discussed for 20 consecutive years the \r\nnecessity of ending the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba. Also for 20 consecutive years, \r\nby the end of today’s meeting the General Assembly \r\nwill have overwhelmingly adopted another resolution \r\non this issue of common concern. In that connection, \r\nmy delegation associates itself with the statements \r\nmade by the representatives of Argentina and Egypt on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China, and the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement, respectively. We have often \r\nheard calls for prompt action by the United Nations \r\nand States on issues that concern the international \r\ncommunity. After 20 consecutive years of the General \r\nAssembly’s demand against the backdrop of the half-\r\ncentury embargo, it is obvious that ending the embargo \r\nis one of those issues. \r\n Viet Nam shares the view of the international \r\ncommunity that the United States should end the \r\nembargo against Cuba, a sovereign and peace-loving \r\nnation, based on the existing strong legal, political, \r\neconomic and, as is often talked about these days, \r\nhumanitarian reasons. \r\n As affirmed in the General Assembly’s \r\nresolutions on the issue, the policies and measures in \r\npursuit of the embargo against Cuba, including the so-\r\ncalled Helms-Burton Act, are contrary to international \r\nlaw and the purposes and principles of the United \r\nNations Charter. They hinder the development of \r\nfriendly relations among nations. The basis of these \r\npolicies and measures violates the right of a people to \r\nself-determination, which includes, among other \r\nthings, the right to determine their political system and \r\npath of development.  \r\n The restrictions on trade, finance and even travel \r\ncontinue to have serious, illegal extraterritorial effects \r\non the sovereignty of other States and their legitimate \r\neconomic interests relating to persons under their \r\njurisdiction, freedom of trade and navigation and \r\nefforts towards the equal and just global economic \r\nstructure that is necessary for the prosperity of every \r\nnation. The Government of Cuba estimates that the loss \r\nand damage the embargo has caused the Cuban people \r\namounts to nearly $1 trillion. It is a staggering figure, \r\nbut the suffering the embargo has caused the Cuban \r\npeople is greater than the mere number, and is \r\nespecially profound for women and children. \r\nA/66/PV.41  \r\n \r\n11-56249 14 \r\n \r\n This has also prompted the Ibero-American heads \r\nof State and Government to call for an end to the \r\nembargo. In the Final Document of the fifteenth \r\nSummit of the Non-Aligned Movement, held in Egypt \r\nin 2009, the heads of State and Government of the \r\nMovement  \r\n “reiterated their call to the Government of the \r\nUnited States of America to put an end to the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo \r\nagainst Cuba which, in addition to being \r\nunilateral and contrary to the United Nations \r\nCharter and international law, and to the principle \r\nof neighbourliness, is causing huge material \r\nlosses and economic damage to the people of \r\nCuba.” \r\n The discussions we are engaged in and the action \r\nthat the General Assembly is going to take today are \r\nconsistent with the desire for cooperation and dialogue \r\nthat, at the start of this session, permeated the general \r\ndebate and its theme of the peaceful settlement of \r\ndisputes. In this regard, we would like to recall the \r\nstatement made by His Excellency Mr. Bruno \r\nRodríguez Parrilla, Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nCuba, in the General Assembly just a month ago (see \r\nA/66/PV.26), in which he reiterated Cuba’s willingness \r\nto move towards normalizing relations with the United \r\nStates, as well as its proposal to begin dialogue aimed \r\nat solving bilateral issues, including humanitarian \r\nissues, and its offer of cooperation in numerous areas. \r\n For the reasons to which I have referred, Viet \r\nNam will support draft resolution A/66/L.4 under \r\nconsideration today and strongly urges the United \r\nStates to end the economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo against Cuba and begin dialogue with that \r\ncountry. \r\n Mr. Gonsalves (Saint Vincent and the \r\nGrenadines): A half-century ago, the world was witness \r\nto the Cuban spring, an indigenous and popular \r\nuprising against a corrupt and brutal dictator. The \r\nCuban people, unassisted by foreign military forces, \r\ncast off the shackles of rapacious exploitation and \r\nchose for themselves a new and uniquely adapted path \r\nof progress, global citizenship and development that \r\nwas measured not by levels of corporate or individual \r\nexcess but by its fulfilment of the needs of its citizens, \r\nparticularly the poor. \r\n Alas, some States did not greet the Cuban spring \r\nin the spirit of enthusiasm with which they welcomed, \r\nassisted or instigated other, subsequent revolutionary \r\nmovements. For the past five decades, Cuba has been \r\nsubject to an economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo whose scale and scope have no parallel in the \r\nmodern world. For the past 20 years, the international \r\ncommunity has spoken in an increasingly unified voice \r\nagainst the continued imposition of that blockade. \r\nToday, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines unreservedly \r\naligns itself with the positions expressed by the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement, the Group of 77 and China, \r\nand the Caribbean Community in again calling for an \r\nend to this unjust, immoral and illegal embargo. \r\n By almost any measure, the embargo is an \r\nunmitigated failure. It has served only to visit suffering \r\non the Cuban people and as a jingoistic backdrop to a \r\nsmattering of pandering politicians who value their \r\nindividual electoral fortunes above integrity, \r\ninternational law and the weight of overwhelming \r\nglobal condemnation. \r\n Today we must ask ourselves: What place does \r\nthis embargo have in our modern world? And in an \r\ninterconnected world of open borders and the free \r\nmovement of people, goods and capital, how can the \r\nchampions and architects of globalization legislate the \r\nisolation of one State, or place extraterritorial \r\nrestrictions on commerce, global trade and the \r\nmovement of individuals? How can the electorate of \r\none district, or one constituency, or one country \r\ndetermine the cargo and path of a ship sailing into and \r\nout of Cuban waters, or the manner in which banks and \r\ncorporations of other countries conduct their business \r\nwith Cuba? \r\n As a developing country heavily dependent on \r\nremittances and affected by an international economic \r\nmeltdown not of our own making, Saint Vincent and \r\nthe Grenadines finds it inexplicably cruel that any State \r\nwould seek to limit the amount of money that one \r\nfamily member could bring home to another, or the \r\nvalue of items in a gift parcel, particularly in the midst \r\nof this global recession. \r\n Today, there are countries where United States \r\nsoldiers are heroically fighting and shedding blood in \r\nwars, yet United States citizens may travel to those \r\ncountries, and foreign banks may transact business in \r\nthem. There are countries whose systems of \r\ngovernance, or whose practices and values, are \r\ndiametrically opposed to the American way of life. Yet \r\nthe bonds of trade and mutual respect for sovereignty \r\n A/66/PV.41\r\n \r\n15 11-56249 \r\n \r\nsupersede those differences, and no embargo exists to \r\nimpose the ideals of one nation upon another. Only the \r\nCuban embargo remains as the last surviving relic of a \r\nCold War that otherwise exists only in history books \r\nand museums. Even if every vicious lie, every \r\nunfounded allegation, every spurious and demonstrably \r\nfalse characterization of the Cuban Government were \r\naccepted as fact, they would not justify the existence of \r\nthis embargo in a modern world of interconnection and \r\nmultilateral engagement. \r\n No country represented here in Hall has the right \r\nto tell the United States how to conduct its foreign \r\npolicy, who its friends should be or how to determine \r\nits national interests. Even if such a right existed, Saint \r\nVincent and the Grenadines would not presume to \r\nexercise it against our cherished friend and neighbour \r\nto the north. But every country in the Hall is obligated \r\nby the United Nations Charter to oppose instances \r\nwhere national foreign policy decisions morph into \r\nviolations of international law, or into sustained \r\ndisregard for the Charter principles of sovereign \r\nequality and non-interference in the domestic affairs of \r\nStates. \r\n Among the complex and interlocking system of \r\nlaws that perpetuate the Cuban embargo is the United \r\nStates 1996 Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity \r\nAct, which makes the easing or lifting of the embargo \r\nconditional on a determination that a transitional or \r\nnew Government is in power in Cuba. I am unaware of \r\nany other instance where the principle of regime \r\nchange is so nakedly codified into the legislation of \r\nanother country. The Helms-Burton Act has a stated \r\npolicy objective of installing a “democratically elected \r\nGovernment” in Cuba, and helpfully supplies a \r\ncongressional definition of what constitutes a \r\ndemocratically elected Government. According to the \r\ndefinition provided, as it appears in section 206 of the \r\nAct, a democratically elected Government is one that \r\n “has made demonstrable progress in returning to \r\nUnited States citizens (and entities which are \r\n50 per cent or more beneficially owned by United \r\nStates citizens) property taken by the Cuban \r\nGovernment from such citizens and entities on or \r\nafter January 1, 1959, or providing full \r\ncompensation for such property”. \r\n That is the definition of the democratically \r\nelected Government. Whatever the merits of this \r\ndefinition of democracy, the continued application of \r\nthe Act stands in marked contrast to the words uttered \r\nby our esteemed friend and brother President Barack \r\nObama of the United States in his inaugural address to \r\nthe General Assembly in its general debate. In that \r\naddress, President Obama rightly stated that \r\n  “Democracy cannot be imposed on any \r\nnation from the outside. Each society must search \r\nfor its own path, and no path is perfect. Each \r\ncountry will pursue a path rooted in the culture of \r\nits people and in its past traditions. And I admit \r\nthat America has too often been selective in its \r\npromotion of democracy.” (A/64/PV.3, p. 14) \r\nWe in St. Vincent and the Grenadines heartily endorse \r\nand support those words, but words without works are \r\nmeaningless. \r\n The President of the United States has \r\nconsiderable discretion to ease the crippling \r\nrestrictions imposed on the Cuban people. We \r\nrespectfully urge him to consider the full extent of his \r\npowers in light of his indisputable commitment to \r\nmultilateralism, his respect for international law and \r\nhis well-documented efforts to alleviate the suffering \r\nof peoples worldwide.  \r\n St. Vincent and the Grenadines is aware that our \r\nsmall country, small population and small economy, \r\nnot to mention the waning military significance of the \r\nCaribbean region, have allowed our needs and \r\nconcerns to be overlooked by those who see the world \r\nonly through the prism of their own narrow and \r\nimmediate interests. However, Cuba has remained a \r\nstaunch and abiding partner in the development of our \r\ncountry, even in times of global hardship. Cuban \r\nuniversities have graduated over 250 Vincentian \r\nstudents and are currently playing host to 150 more, \r\nfree of charge. Cuban surgeons have performed \r\noperations on over 3,000 Vincentian patients, without \r\ncharging them a penny. Cuban doctors have brought \r\nquality medical care and expertise to the most remote \r\nareas of our country. Even as we speak, Cuban \r\nengineers, architects and workers are labouring \r\nalongside Vincentians in the construction of a modern \r\nhospital and our very first international airport.  \r\n While far wealthier nations and institutions have \r\nlooked askance at our developmental struggles and \r\noffered only dubious prescriptions, platitudes and trite \r\nclichés, the Cuban people have rolled up their sleeves \r\nand given freely of themselves in a manner that has \r\ntouched the hearts of the Vincentian people. No dollar \r\nA/66/PV.41  \r\n \r\n11-56249 16 \r\n \r\namount can adequately reflect the value of their \r\nsupport, solidarity and partnership, for which the \r\nCuban people have asked nothing in return. Our \r\nappreciation cannot be overstated. \r\n Allow me, in closing, to return to the stirring \r\nwords of President Obama’s inaugural United Nations \r\naddress:  \r\n “The world must stand together to demonstrate \r\nthat international law is not an empty promise … \r\n(ibid., p. 11) \r\n “No one nation can or should try to dominate \r\nanother nation. No world order that elevates one \r\nnation or group of people over another will \r\nsucceed … The traditional divisions between \r\nnations of the South and the North make no sense \r\nin an interconnected world, nor do alignments of \r\nnations rooted in the cleavages of a long-gone \r\nCold War.  \r\n  “The time has come to realize that the old \r\nhabits and the old arguments are irrelevant to the \r\nchallenges faced by our peoples.” (ibid., p. 10) \r\n Those words embody a promise of change in \r\nwhich we can wholeheartedly believe. Recent events \r\nhave reminded us that change, like peace, is often hard. \r\nBut not all aspects of change are hard. Some simply \r\nrequire a modicum of political courage and a \r\nwillingness to hear not the hackneyed sloganeering of \r\nan increasingly narrow and local political interest, but \r\nto heed instead the insistent, consistent and \r\noverwhelming voice of the international community, \r\nfriend and foe alike, and indeed, one’s own conscience, \r\ncompassion and common sense. \r\n Mr. Ovsyanko (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): The \r\ndelegation of Belarus is pleased to welcome the \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Cuba, Mr. Bruno \r\nRodríguez Parrilla, who is participating in today’s \r\nmeeting. \r\n For many decades, the overwhelming majority of \r\nStates Members of the United Nations have spoken in \r\nthe General Assembly to demand an end to the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo of Cuba \r\nimposed by the United States . It is an uncivilized and \r\nunconstructive way to handle international disputes. \r\n We are convinced that the policy of the blockade \r\nagainst freedom-loving Cuba is contrary to \r\ninternational law and violates principles and decisions \r\nof the United Nations. The unilateral sanctions have a \r\nprofoundly negative impact on the living standards of \r\nthe Cuban people, as well as on that country’s \r\neconomic development, especially given the added \r\ndamage of the current financial and economic crisis \r\nand the likelihood of its second wave. \r\n The Republic of Belarus decisively rejects any \r\napplication by any State of economic and trade \r\nmeasures against another. We stress the intrinsic right \r\nof each nation to choose its own model of \r\ndevelopment. We consider that any unilateral attempts \r\nby a single State to modify the domestic political \r\nsystem of another State through economic, political or \r\nother measures is unacceptable. \r\n We are convinced that in the current system of \r\ninternational economic relations there should be no \r\nplace for economic sanctions or other unilateral \r\ncoercive measures to put economic pressure on a State \r\nor its citizens. It is time to realize that a strong people \r\nwill never relinquish their right to choose. Determining \r\none’s own path to development has a precious value.  \r\n Today we are going to adopt the twentieth \r\nGeneral Assembly resolution that urges the United \r\nStates to end its unilateral and obsolete embargo \r\nagainst Cuba. We sincerely hope that, on this twentieth \r\nattempt, the voice of the General Assembly will finally \r\nbe heard. \r\n Mr. Khan (Indonesia): At the outset, my \r\ndelegation wishes to associate itself with the \r\nstatements made earlier by the representative of \r\nArgentina on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, and \r\nby the representative of Egypt on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement. \r\n As we enter the twentieth year of debate on this \r\nagenda item in the General Assembly, Indonesia would \r\nlike to reiterate its call for the conclusion of the \r\nunilateral economic, commercial, and financial \r\nembargo imposed against Cuba. That unilateral \r\nembargo undermines not only the principles enshrined \r\nin the United Nations Charter and international law, but \r\nalso the rights of people to life, well-being and \r\ndevelopment without distinctions of any kind. \r\nMoreover, although unilaterally imposed, the embargo \r\nhas impacted the economic and commercial interests \r\nand relations of third countries. \r\n As highlighted in the Secretary-General’s report \r\n(A/66/114), the embargo has severely affected the day-\r\n A/66/PV.41\r\n \r\n17 11-56249 \r\n \r\nto-day welfare of Cuban citizens. At a time when the \r\nworld is facing serious, multifaceted challenges in the \r\neconomic, food, energy and other development \r\nspheres, the embargo poses an unnecessary burden \r\nregarding the attainment of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and other development goals. \r\n Much has changed since the initial imposition of \r\nthe embargo. Globalization has created the conditions \r\nfor true global solidarity and partnership in the \r\ncommunity of nations. We believe that lifting the \r\nembargo would be in keeping with the spirit of the \r\ntimes. In our view, the time is ripe for relations \r\nbetween the two main parties to be transformed \r\nthrough constructive engagement. \r\n As a member of the international community, \r\nIndonesia remains steadfast in its opposition to actions \r\nthat undermine the principles of the United Nations \r\nCharter. We call on all countries to adhere to the \r\nprinciples of equality, mutual respect, peaceful \r\ncoexistence, good neighbourliness and respect for \r\nhuman rights. \r\n Mr. Beck (Solomon Islands): I would like to \r\nbegin by associating this statement with the statement \r\nissued by Argentina on behalf of the Group of 77 and \r\nChina on this agenda item. \r\n This is the twentieth consecutive year that we \r\nhave gathered in this Hall to urge our friend and \r\npartner the United States to lift its blockade against the \r\nCuban people. The voices of 187 Members of the \r\nUnited Nations family last year spoke in lockstep \r\nunison on this issue. We are positive that we will do so \r\nagain this year in connection with the draft resolution \r\nentitled “Necessity of ending the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial blockade imposed by the \r\nUnited States of America against Cuba” (A/66/L.4). \r\n The theme of last month’s general debate was \r\n“The role of mediation in the settlement of disputes \r\nthrough peaceful means”. We ask our friend and \r\npartner the United States of America, a Member with \r\nabsolute power within our multilateral system, to view \r\nits actions with regard to the people of Cuba through \r\nthe lens of humanity, find peace within itself and reach \r\nout to its neighbour Cuba and renew a friendship that \r\nhas been put on ice for the last five decades. \r\n The world is changing, and changing fast. We \r\nspeak of rights; let us uphold those rights. We speak of \r\nfreedom; let us respect other States’ freedom to adopt \r\ntheir own political system. We speak of the rule of law; \r\nlet us conduct ourselves in conformity with \r\ninternational law. We speak of multilateralism; let us \r\ndo away with unilateralism. \r\n Solomon Islands, as a small island developing \r\nState, believes in multilateralism; this is all we have. \r\nSolomon Islands commends Cuba for taking the most \r\npeaceful path in seeking the unconditional lifting of the \r\nblockade through the United Nations. This is the only \r\nplace where the members of the international \r\ncommunity, large and small, gather to ensure that what \r\nis moral is upheld, what is right is respected and what \r\nmust be undone is lifted. \r\n Once again, Solomon Islands will vote in support \r\nof the draft resolution calling for the unconditional \r\nlifting of the blockade, and calls on all members to \r\nsupport it as well. \r\n Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): We welcome the participation in today’s \r\ndebate of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Cuba, \r\nMr. Rodríguez Parrilla. \r\n The Russian delegation would like to express its \r\ngratitude to the Secretary-General for his \r\ncomprehensive report (A/66/114) presenting the views \r\nof Member States, which have unanimously expressed \r\ndisagreement with and rejection of the unilateral and \r\nextraterritorial economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo against Cuba. \r\n The position of principle taken by Russia with \r\nregard to this draft resolution is well known and \r\nremains unchanged. We express total solidarity with \r\nthe overwhelming majority of the members of the \r\ninternational community, who strongly condemn the \r\ntrade and economic embargo against Cuba by the \r\nUnited States and call for the earliest repeal of this \r\nsenseless anti-Cuban practice that runs counter to \r\ncurrent international realities. \r\n The anti-Cuba blockade, which has lasted for \r\nalmost half a century, has clearly demonstrated its \r\ninability to influence the sovereign choice of \r\ndevelopment model made by the Cuban nation. The \r\nonly consequences of the sanctions have been the \r\ndeterioration of the living standards of the Cuban \r\npopulation, the creation of artificial barriers to its \r\neconomic growth, and an infringement of the rights \r\nand interests of third countries. Such measures are \r\ncounterproductive, as they only complicate the quest \r\nA/66/PV.41  \r\n \r\n11-56249 18 \r\n \r\nfor solutions to inter-State disagreements and aggravate \r\nan already overloaded and contentious agenda. \r\n For years now, the unilateral, restrictive United \r\nStates actions against Cuba have had effects that are \r\ndirectly opposite to the outcome sought by the \r\ninstigators of that policy during the cold war. President \r\nObama’s Administration, which raised great and \r\njustified hopes regarding the adjustment of the United \r\nStates policy towards Cuba, has taken only minimal \r\nsteps in that direction. We hope that the decision of the \r\nUnited States Administration to discontinue certain \r\nrestrictions on visits by United States citizens to their \r\nrelatives in Cuba and on the sending of remittances and \r\nmoney orders will be followed by additional steps \r\naimed at normalizing United States-Cuban relations \r\nand the final lifting of the embargo. \r\n We strongly believe that this policy, unlike the \r\ndiscriminatory practice of economic strangulation, will \r\ncontribute to the successful implementation of the \r\nprogressive social and economic reforms currently \r\nbeing implemented by the Cuban leadership. \r\n Guided by the fundamental principles of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations on the inadmissibility of \r\nany discriminatory measures relating to or interference \r\ninto the domestic affairs of States, we deem it \r\nnecessary to vote in favour of the draft resolution \r\ncalling for a lifting of the blockade. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Bruno Eduardo Rodríguez Parrilla, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Cuba, to introduce draft \r\nresolution A/66/L.4. \r\n Mr. Rodríguez Parrilla (Cuba) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): We wish at the outset to convey our deepest \r\ncondolences to our Central American brothers, to the \r\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia and to the Republic of \r\nTurkey. \r\n On 13 November 1991, the General Assembly \r\ntook the decision to include in the agenda of its next \r\nsession a discussion of the item entitled “Necessity of \r\nending the economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo imposed by the United States of America \r\nagainst Cuba”. \r\n That was when the United States, in a cruelly \r\nopportunistic manner, was determined to tighten the \r\nsiege against the island, which was struggling alone as \r\na result of the so-called Torricelli Act, which cut off \r\nour trade in medicines and foodstuffs with the \r\nsubsidiaries of United States companies based in third \r\ncountries. That was the official act that made public the \r\nextraterritorial implementation of the blockade laws \r\nagainst third States. \r\n At that time, it might have seemed impossible \r\nthat 20 years later the Assembly would still be \r\ndiscussing the same item, which is so closely linked to \r\nthe right of peoples to self-determination, to \r\ninternational law, to the norms of international trade \r\nand to the very reasons for the Organization’s \r\nexistence. \r\n This is one of the items that is traditionally \r\ndiscussed by the General Assembly and gives rise to \r\nthe greatest number of reiterated statements. It also \r\nreceives categorical and overwhelming support, clearly \r\ndemonstrating the uncomfortable isolation of the \r\naggressor country and the heroic resistance of a people \r\nthat refuses to give up its sovereign rights. \r\n For two decades, the international community has \r\ninvariably and consistently called for an end to the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial blockade imposed \r\nby the United States against Cuba. It has done so by \r\nmeans of the resolutions that are adopted almost \r\nunanimously every year, by the dozens of appeals \r\nissued by heads of State and delegations that have \r\nreferred to this item during the high-level general \r\ndebate of the Assembly, and by the statements made by \r\nvirtually all international agencies and groups of \r\nStates, particularly those of Latin America and the \r\nCaribbean. \r\n In 1996, the Helms-Burton Act led to an \r\nunprecedented expansion of the extraterritorial scope \r\nof the blockade and laid the groundwork for a “change \r\nof regime” and subsequent direct intervention in Cuba. \r\nNo one seems to have noticed that the 2004 “Bush plan \r\nfor Cuba” has been left by the wayside. \r\n The report of the Secretary-General on this item \r\n(A/66/114), which includes the statements of more than \r\n160 countries and specialized agencies of the United \r\nNations system, comprehensively illustrates this \r\ncontinuing and cruel policy and on its direct effects on \r\nthe people and the economy of Cuba. The direct \r\neconomic damage caused to the Cuban people as a \r\nresult of the blockade exceeds $975 billion, estimated \r\nat the depreciated United States dollar value compared \r\nto that of gold.  \r\n A/66/PV.41\r\n \r\n19 11-56249 \r\n \r\n Article II, subparagraphs (b) and (c), of the 1948 \r\nConvention on the Prevention and Punishment of the \r\nCrime of Genocide defines as acts of genocide \r\n“causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of \r\nthe group” and “deliberately inflicting on the group \r\nconditions of life calculated to bring about its physical \r\ndestruction in whole or in part”.  \r\n According to a United States Government \r\nmemorandum of 6 April 1960, the blockade’s \r\nobjectives have been to cause  \r\n “disenchantment and disaffection based on \r\neconomic dissatisfaction and hardship … to \r\nweaken the economic life of Cuba … denying \r\nmoney and supplies to Cuba, to decrease \r\nmonetary and real wages, to bring about hunger, \r\ndesperation and overthrow of government.”  \r\n The United States has never hidden the fact that \r\nits objective is to overthrow the revolutionary \r\nGovernment and to destroy the constitutional order that \r\nthe Cuban people defend in sovereignty. That is what \r\nformer President George W. Bush called “regime \r\nchange”, which has now acquired new dimensions. \r\n Despite the false image of flexibility that the \r\ncurrent United States Administration tries to portray, \r\nthe blockade and the sanctions remain intact, fully \r\nimplemented, and their extraterritorial character has \r\nintensified in recent years. The increased persecution \r\nof Cuban financial transactions across the world, with \r\ncomplete disregard for the laws of third countries and \r\nthe opposition of their Governments, has become a \r\ndistinct feature of the Obama Administration.  \r\n Cuba is still unable to freely export or import \r\nproducts and services of any sort to and from the \r\nUnited States. Cuba cannot use American dollars in its \r\ntransactions, not even to pay its contributions to the \r\nUnited Nations and to other international agencies. Nor \r\ncan Cuba hold accounts in that currency in banks in \r\nthird countries or have access to credit from banks in \r\nthe United States or from any of their subsidiaries in \r\nthird countries or from international institutions, such \r\nas the World Bank or the Inter-American Development \r\nBank.  \r\n The ban on trade with American companies’ \r\nsubsidiaries in third countries still cannot be altered. \r\nEntrepreneurs from other countries who are interested \r\nin investing in my country continue to be sanctioned, \r\nthreatened or blacklisted.  \r\n International organizations and agencies and \r\nprogrammes of the United Nations system are not \r\nspared from this policy. The United States Government \r\nhinders the cooperation that those entities offer to \r\nCuba, including that intended for extremely sensitive \r\nareas. Clear evidence of that is the confiscation in \r\nJanuary of $4,207,000 in financing from the Global \r\nFund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria to \r\nimplement projects of cooperation with Cuba, which \r\nwas intended for combating the acquired \r\nimmunodeficiency syndrome and tuberculosis. \r\n As a result of Cuba’s denunciation, the United \r\nStates Treasury Department issued a general licence in \r\nMay this year to release those funds. That licence will \r\nexpire on 30 June 2015. But the very fact that the \r\nresources allocated by that humanitarian organization \r\nrequire a United States Government licence to reach \r\nCuba shows — in addition to the intent to use these \r\nsensitive programmes as hostages of that Government’s \r\naggressive policy against my country — flagrantly \r\ndisrespectful behaviour towards the United Nations and \r\nits various agencies. Several cooperation projects \r\ncarried out by the International Atomic Energy Agency \r\nhave also been victims of the blockade. \r\n In the midst of a supposed relaxation that allows \r\nsome groups of Americans to travel to Cuba, the \r\nTreasury Department very recently denied travel \r\npermits to two important United States non-governmental \r\norganizations that for years have been cooperating with \r\nCuban institutions in the area of health care. That \r\ndecision could prevent donations of medicines that are \r\nunavailable in our country because of the blockade \r\nfrom reaching their destination. The truth is that the \r\nfreedom of travel of Americans continues to be \r\nhampered, and Cuba remains the only forbidden \r\ndestination.  \r\n On several occasions, United States \r\nrepresentatives have indicated here that the item we are \r\ndiscussing today is a bilateral issue and therefore \r\nshould not be discussed in this forum. They are likely \r\nto reiterate the same fallacious argument here today. \r\nThe facts prove the inconsistency. Citizens and \r\ncompanies from numerous Member States represented \r\nhere have been subject to sanctions for establishing \r\neconomic relations with Cuba. \r\n What is represented by the fines imposed on \r\n18 August on the subsidiary of the French shipping and \r\ntransportation company CMA CGM for offering \r\nA/66/PV.41  \r\n \r\n11-56249 20 \r\n \r\ncontainer services to Cuba, if not the extraterritorial \r\nnature of that policy? How could we describe the \r\ndemands imposed by the European subsidiary of \r\nPayPal, which facilitates electronic transactions \r\nthrough the Internet, on the German firm Rum \u0026 \r\nCompany to force it to remove Cuban rum and tobacco \r\nfrom its web page?  \r\n There have been countless examples of the \r\nextraterritorial implementation of that policy, as can be \r\nseen in Cuba’s reply contained in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report. \r\n President Obama’s most recent statements about \r\nCuba have left quite a few observers astonished, but \r\nthey come as no surprise to us. President Obama’s \r\nresponse to the Cuban Government’s offer of a \r\ndialogue on all topics of interest on the bilateral agenda \r\nhas been, once again, a non-committal refusal, based \r\non absurd arguments and unacceptable conditions that \r\nhave never worked. His position is old, repetitive and \r\nanchored in the past. It is as if, instead the President \r\nelected to bring about change, his predecessors were \r\nspeaking for him, including Republican predecessors. \r\nHe seemed misinformed, completely unaware of what \r\nis going on in our country, of our history and of our \r\nculture. \r\n Cuba experienced great change in 1959. At the \r\ncost of 20,000 lives, it swept away the dictatorship of \r\nBatista, the United States’ strongman. Since then, Cuba \r\nhas continued to change day by day, and thanks to its \r\ncapacity for renewal it has been able to resist. Others \r\ndid not resist because they did not change, or because \r\nthey were inflexible or drifted. Now, Cuba is changing \r\nand will resolutely change everything that should be \r\nchanged within the revolution and within socialism: \r\nmore revolution and improved socialism. The only \r\nthing that has not changed over the past 50 years is the \r\nblockade and the hostile and aggressive policy of the \r\nUnited States, despite the fact that it has not worked, \r\nnor will it. \r\n However, what the United States Government \r\nwants to see changed will not change. The Cuban \r\nGovernment will continue to be the Government of the \r\npeople, by the people and for the people. Our elections \r\nwill not be auctions. There will be no $4 billion \r\nelection campaigns nor a parliament supported by \r\n13 per cent of voters. We will not have corrupt political \r\nelites separate from the people. We will continue being \r\na true democracy, not a plutocracy. We will defend the \r\nright to true and objective information. \r\n We will continue our fight for full justice. We \r\nwill protect equal opportunities for every child, and we \r\nwill not abandon anyone. We will not renounce our \r\nsocial policies. Health and education will continue to \r\nbe universal and free of charge. We will guarantee the \r\nright to work, decent retirement and social security. \r\nThere will continue to be equal pay for equal work. We \r\nwill protect pregnant women and the disabled. Human \r\nbeings will continue to be the first and most important \r\nthing. We will defend our culture. We will continue to \r\nbelieve in human values. The exercise of human rights \r\nwill be fully guaranteed for all Cubans. \r\n The economy will have to be efficient, but it will \r\ncontinue to be in the service of the people. People’s \r\nlives are, and will continue to be, far more important \r\nthan macroeconomic data. The people will continue to \r\nbe consulted on economic policies. The consequences \r\nof the global economic crisis will be shared by all. We \r\nwill continue redistributing wealth so that there are \r\nneither rich nor poor. We will not allow corruption or \r\nspeculation, nor will we steal money from workers to \r\nbail out banks. We will continue to seek the \r\nparticipation of foreign companies in our economy \r\nwithout any exceptions. \r\n It would suffice to review the recent disclosures \r\nmade by Wikileaks about the work of the State \r\nDepartment and American embassies in all countries to \r\nhinder political, diplomatic, economic, commercial and \r\ncooperative relations with Cuba. They are disgraceful \r\nbecause of their content — the information about the \r\nconcern, the interest in and persecution of the \r\nhumanitarian work being carried out by Cuban medical \r\nbrigades, which nobly and selflessly serve millions of \r\npeoples in dozens of sister nations. \r\n Family ties and the limited cultural, academic and \r\nscientific exchanges between the United States and \r\nCuba show today what a positive step it would be to \r\nexpand those links for the benefit of both peoples, \r\nwithout the obstacles and conditions imposed by \r\nWashington, D.C. Cuba’s proposal for moving towards \r\nthe normalization of relations and expanding bilateral \r\ncooperation in a range of areas still stands. Making \r\nreciprocal efforts to resolve pending humanitarian \r\nissues would likewise be in our common interest. \r\n Why does President Obama’s Administration not \r\nbetter concern itself with the problems of the United \r\n A/66/PV.41\r\n \r\n21 11-56249 \r\n \r\nStates and leave us Cubans alone to solve ours in \r\npeace? \r\n One of the five Cuban antiterrorist fighters has \r\njust finished serving every minute of his unjust 13-year \r\nprison sentence, yet he is now being prevented from \r\nreturning to Cuba and reuniting with his family, while \r\nthe other four continue to endure a cruel and unjust \r\nincarceration as political prisoners. The blatant \r\ncorruption in the legal proceedings and the \r\nGovernment’s illegal conduct throughout is widely \r\nknown and has been well documented. Why not release \r\nthem as an act of justice, or at least as a humanitarian \r\ngesture?  \r\n I must convey the profound gratitude of the \r\npeople of Cuba to all of the countries that for 20 years \r\nhave used their voices and their votes to call for an end \r\nto the most unjust, long-lasting and comprehensive \r\nunilateral sanctions in history, which have caused so \r\nmuch harm to millions of Cubans. \r\n I speak on behalf of 16-year-old Guillermo \r\nDomínguez Díaz, 18-year-old Ivis Palacio Terry, \r\n17-year-old Randy Barroso Torres, and 12-year-old \r\nAdrián Izquierdo Cabrera, who have undergone \r\nconservative surgeries and spent months confined to \r\nbed, wearing casts, because hospitals have no \r\npaediatric expandable prostheses, which are \r\nmanufactured in the United States or under its patents. \r\nI speak on behalf of María Amelia Alonso Valdés, \r\n2 years of age, Damián Hernández Valdés, 4, and \r\nDayán Romayena Lorente, 12, who suffer from central \r\nnervous system tumours and who need to be treated \r\nwith Temodal, a drug manufactured in the United \r\nStates and protected by its patents. On behalf of my \r\nselfless, generous, optimistic and heroic people and for \r\nthe good of the community of nations and the \r\nequilibrium of the world, I ask the Assembly to support \r\ndraft resolution A/66/L.4, entitled “Necessity of ending \r\nthe economic, commercial and financial embargo \r\nimposed by the United States of America against \r\nCuba”. \r\n The President: We have heard the last speaker in \r\nthe debate on this item. We shall now proceed to \r\nconsider draft resolution A/66/L.4. \r\n Before giving the floor to speakers in explanation \r\nof vote before the vote, may I remind delegations that \r\nexplanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes and \r\nshould be made by delegations from their seats. \r\n Mr. Godard (United States of America): For yet \r\nanother year, the Assembly is taking up a draft \r\nresolution designed to confuse and obscure. But let \r\nthere be no confusion about this: the United States, like \r\nmost Member States, reaffirms its strong commitment \r\nto supporting the right and the heartfelt desire of the \r\nCuban people to freely determine their future. And let \r\nthere be no obscuring that the Cuban regime has \r\ndeprived them of that right for more than half a \r\ncentury. \r\n At the same time, the United States strongly \r\nasserts its sovereign right, on the same basis as other \r\nMember States, to determine its bilateral policies, \r\nincluding its economic relationships with other \r\ncountries, in accordance with its own national interests \r\nand values. This includes our economic relationships \r\nwith other countries. The United States’ economic \r\nrelationship with Cuba is a bilateral issue and is not \r\nappropriately a concern of the Assembly. \r\n The embargo represents just one aspect of United \r\nStates policy towards Cuba, whose overarching goal is \r\nto encourage a more open environment in Cuba and \r\nincreased respect for human rights and fundamental \r\nfreedoms — principles to which this Organization is \r\nalso dedicated. \r\n This annual exercise attempts to no good end to \r\nobscure some fundamental truths. The Cuban \r\nGovernment’s own policies, not any action of the \r\nUnited States Government, are the greatest obstacle to \r\nCuba’s economic development. Those policies \r\nconcentrate political and economic decisions in the \r\nhands of the few, stifling economic growth. They \r\nignore the basic principles, so effectively demonstrated \r\nin many countries, that policies that allow individual \r\nfreedom unleash the creativity of people, foster \r\ninnovation and entrepreneurship, and are the best \r\nmeans to achieve sustainable economic development.  \r\n This exercise conceals the fact that the United \r\nStates is a leading source of food and humanitarian aid \r\nto Cuba. The United States does not restrict \r\nhumanitarian aid to Cuba. Cubans receive food, \r\nmedicine, other forms of assistance and remittances \r\nfrom the United States. In the year 2010, the United \r\nStates Government authorized $3.5 billion in total sales \r\nto Cuba of United States goods. In agricultural \r\nproducts alone, the United States exported \r\n$361.7 million in goods to Cuba in 2010, including \r\nA/66/PV.41  \r\n \r\n11-56249 22 \r\n \r\npoultry, soy bean products, corn, wheat, feed products, \r\npork and other items.  \r\n Indeed, as the Cuban Government itself has \r\nrepeatedly indicated, the United States has for years \r\nbeen one of Cuba’s principal trading partners. The \r\nUnited States in 2010 also authorized $861 million in \r\nprivate humanitarian assistance in the form of gift \r\nparcels filled with food and other basic necessities, as \r\nwell as non-agricultural and medical donations. Those \r\nfigures alone are sufficient to rebut the spurious \r\nallegations of genocide against the Cuban people \r\ncontained in previous resolutions recalled in the \r\ncurrent draft (A/66/L.4) and to demonstrate that this \r\ncalumny greatly misuses that important term and \r\ninsults the true victims of genocide. \r\n This draft resolution and much of the stale \r\nrhetoric surrounding it ignores some basic facts. As \r\nPresident Obama made clear last month, the United \r\nStates is open to a new relationship with Cuba if the \r\nCuban Government starts taking proper steps to open \r\nup its country and provide the space and the respect for \r\nhuman rights that would allow the Cuban people to \r\ndetermine their own destiny. The Cuban Government \r\nalso needs to release unconditionally and immediately \r\nthe 62-year-old American citizen Alan Gross, whom it \r\nsentenced to 15 years of prison for the crime of trying \r\nto connect Cuba’s Jewish communities to the Internet. \r\n The President in January 2011 implemented \r\nseveral significant changes to United States policy \r\ntowards Cuba, aimed at increasing people-to-people \r\ncontact, supporting civil society in Cuba, enhancing the \r\nfree flow of information to, from and among the Cuban \r\npeople and helping promote their independence from \r\nCuban authorities. Those changes build upon the \r\nPresident’s previous actions in April 2009 and \r\ndemonstrate the strong commitment of the United \r\nStates to the Cuban people, contrary to the picture \r\npainted in the draft resolution. \r\n The United States looks forward to a still greater \r\nbroadening of contacts and exchange with Cuba, and is \r\nprepared to do its part to that end. However, improving \r\nthe situation requires efforts on the part of the Cuban \r\nGovernment as well. It must ensure that the Cuban \r\npeople enjoy the internationally recognized political \r\nand economic freedoms to which this body is \r\ncommitted and on which it has insisted with regard to \r\nother countries. \r\n Because the draft resolution does not reflect \r\npresent realities, my delegation will vote against it. We \r\nstrongly believe that this body, instead of engaging in \r\nsuch meaningless exercises, should dedicate itself to \r\nsupporting the efforts of the Cuban people to freely \r\ndetermine their own future. Only by that course can \r\nthis body truly advance the purposes and principles of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. \r\n Mr. Hermida Castillo (Nicaragua) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): For the twentieth year in a row, the General \r\nAssembly will deliver its judgement and demand an \r\nend to the criminal and inhumane blockade against the \r\nheroic, generous people and Government of Cuba. Yet \r\nagain, we have heard a representative of the United \r\nStates of America attempt to justify that which cannot \r\nbe justified in order to force the submission of a people \r\nthat will never submit, a people whose resolve is \r\nabsolute — a people, as Commandante Fidel recently \r\nremarked, whose will is made of steel. \r\n Nicaragua would like once again to publically \r\nexpress its commitment to and support for the draft \r\nresolution entitled “Necessity of ending the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the \r\nUnited States of America against Cuba” (A/66/L.4), \r\nwhich was introduced by our colleague Mr. Bruno \r\nRodríguez Parrilla, Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nCuba, to whom we express our unconditional solidarity \r\nand our gratitude for the updated information on the \r\ndamage and prejudicial harm that the United States of \r\nAmerica continues to inflict on the Cuban people with \r\nthe most criminal blockade in the history of humanity. \r\n Nicaragua expresses its eternal gratitude to the \r\nCuban people and Government for their unwavering \r\nand unconditional militant solidarity whose primary \r\ngoal is to help countries in development. We also wish \r\nto thank Commandante Fidel Castro, who joined forces \r\nwith Commandante Chávez to undertake a great project \r\nof solidarity, reciprocity, social justice, fair trade, life \r\nand peace in our Latin America and the Caribbean that \r\nis today embodied in the Bolivarian Alliance for the \r\nPeoples of Our America.  \r\n The fruits of that project are palpable and \r\nundeniable in the form of reduced poverty, the near \r\neradication of illiteracy, the millions of people whose \r\nsight has been restored thanks to Misión Milagros, and \r\nthe medical and scientific brigades that have improved \r\nthe quality of life in our countries. Those are just a few \r\nof the accomplishments achieved in a short time, and \r\n A/66/PV.41\r\n \r\n23 11-56249 \r\n \r\ndespite the impact of the criminal embargo and of the \r\ninternational crisis generated and created by the \r\ncapitalist economies.  \r\n The peoples and Governments of the world \r\nrepresented here will always stand with Cuba, our \r\nbrother country and brother Government. We recognize \r\nits heroism, its solidarity, its humanism, its generosity \r\nand its commitment at those moments when our \r\npeoples have needed the friendly hand of brothers and \r\nsisters. Who else but Cuba has been the first to step \r\nforward when one of our peoples has had a need and \r\nsought unconditional human solidarity, whether in \r\nmatters of health or education, or in the face of the \r\nblows of climate change? \r\n It is precisely because of the determination of the \r\nCuban people and Government always to stand with \r\nthe world’s poor that they are being attacked and \r\nblockaded and that their Socialist revolution is \r\nthreatened with destruction. \r\n This inhumane policy of the United States \r\nGovernment, which is continuing to implement this \r\ncriminal embargo against the brotherly and beloved \r\npeople and Government of Cuba, must end now. It has \r\nbeen clearly shown that no one supports these \r\nmeasures, which are aimed at breaking the spirit of \r\nindependence, self-determination and international \r\nsolidarity that is characteristic of the Cuban people and \r\nGovernment. It is time to rectify the situation, as these \r\nmeasures violate international law, human rights, \r\nhumanitarian law and the Charter of the United \r\nNations. It is time that an end be put to the belief that \r\nthey will break the steely resolve and the social spirit \r\nof the Cuban revolution. \r\n Even the people of the United States do not \r\nsupport the embargo. Every day more voices are being \r\nheard from that country demanding that an end be put \r\nto this absurd and inhumane policy. One such United \r\nStates voice calling for peace and reconciliation was \r\nthat of Reverend Lucius Walker, whom we warmly \r\nremember for his determined humanism dedicated to \r\nputting an end to the blockade against Cuba, along \r\nwith the Pastors for Peace and their Peace Caravans. \r\n Latin America and the Caribbean strongly support \r\nCuba, which is resolutely and firmly, in a spirit of \r\ncreativity, resisting the embargo — this outdated policy \r\nof intervention in our region. Our region will go \r\nforward, hand in hand with its sister country Cuba, \r\nuntil the Government of the United States reflects on \r\nand rectifies its historic error. \r\n The United States, by not implementing the \r\nresolutions of the General Assembly, is continuing to \r\nworsen the suffering of the brotherly Cuban people. \r\nThe priority sectors most affected by the embargo are \r\npublic health, food and education. \r\n There have been other major economic sanctions \r\nand other forms of persecution against Cuban business \r\nand financial transactions. Nothing has changed that \r\nwould lighten the burden on the people of Cuba. On \r\nthe contrary, there has been a strengthening of the \r\npolicy of strangulation against Cuba. The embargo \r\nremains the main obstacle to the economic and social \r\ndevelopment of Cuba. It is high time for the United \r\nStates to put an end to this criminal embargo and also \r\nto stop helping self-confessed terrorists who continue \r\nto move freely in North American cities and together \r\nplan terrorist acts against the people and the \r\nGovernment of Cuba. \r\n No longer is anyone fooled by the more than \r\n50 years of terrorist acts against the people and the \r\nGovernment of Cuba. A gesture would be welcomed by \r\nthe people of the world would be the immediate freeing \r\nof the four Cuban heroic patriots imprisoned in the \r\nUnited States and the immediate return to his homeland \r\nof the heroic René González, who has been on \r\nconditional release but must remain in the United \r\nStates for years. This is an offence against justice not \r\nto free these heroes, who have defended their country \r\nwith dignity and courage in the face of terrorist attacks \r\nperpetrated from the territory of the United States of \r\nAmerica. We demand the immediate release of these \r\nCuban anti-terrorist heroes. We convey our Sandinista \r\ngreetings to them and to their families, and our \r\nimmense respect for these brothers, sons of Martí and \r\nof the unwavering Cuban revolution. \r\n We would like to express once again our \r\nstrongest condemnation of the embargo against Cuba \r\nand of all coercive measures of a unilateral nature with \r\nextraterritorial effect, which contravene international \r\nlaw and the accepted norms of free trade. These are \r\npractices that not only pose a grave threat to peace and \r\nmultilateralism and represent an insult to human \r\nvalues; they are also an obstacle to mutual \r\nunderstanding among and the well-being of nations. \r\nWe thus condemn the use of unilateral coercive \r\nmeasures such as illegal sanctions against developing \r\nA/66/PV.41  \r\n \r\n11-56249 24 \r\n \r\ncountries aimed at preventing them from exercising \r\ntheir right to determine their own political, economic \r\nand social system. \r\n Once again Nicaragua will vote in favour of draft \r\nresolution A/66/L.4, as will almost the entire \r\ninternational community represented here. We will be \r\nwitnesses once again of the isolation of the \r\nGovernment of the United States and of its policy of \r\nalways being on the opposite side of those who wish \r\nfor peace. The international community will thus \r\nreiterate once again its message of peace and its strong \r\nsupport for Cuba in defence of its sovereignty and self-\r\ndetermination and in defence of its heroic revolution. \r\n The President: We have heard the last speaker in \r\nexplanation of vote before the voting. \r\n The Assembly will now take a decision on draft \r\nresolution A/66/L.4.  \r\n A recorded vote has been requested. \r\n A recorded vote was taken. \r\nIn favour: \r\n Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Andorra, Angola, \r\nAntigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Armenia, \r\nAustralia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Bahamas, Bahrain, \r\nBangladesh, Barbados, Belarus, Belgium, Belize, \r\nBenin, Bhutan, Bolivia (Plurinational State of), \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, Botswana, Brazil, \r\nBrunei Darussalam, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, \r\nBurundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, Canada, Cape \r\nVerde, Central African Republic, Chad, Chile, \r\nChina, Colombia, Comoros, Congo, Costa Rica, \r\nCôte d’Ivoire, Croatia, Cuba, Cyprus, Czech \r\nRepublic, Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea, Democratic Republic of the Congo, \r\nDenmark, Djibouti, Dominica, Dominican \r\nRepublic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, \r\nEquatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Estonia, Ethiopia, \r\nFiji, Finland, France, Gabon, Gambia, Georgia, \r\nGermany, Ghana, Greece, Grenada, Guatemala, \r\nGuinea, Guinea-Bissau, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, \r\nHungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic \r\nRepublic of), Iraq, Ireland, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, \r\nJordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kiribati, Kuwait, \r\nKyrgyzstan, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, \r\nLatvia, Lebanon, Lesotho, Liberia, Liechtenstein, \r\nLithuania, Luxembourg, Madagascar, Malawi, \r\nMalaysia, Maldives, Mali, Malta, Mauritania, \r\nMauritius, Mexico, Monaco, Mongolia, \r\nMontenegro, Morocco, Mozambique, Myanmar, \r\nNamibia, Nauru, Nepal, Netherlands, New \r\nZealand, Nicaragua, Niger, Nigeria, Norway, \r\nOman, Pakistan, Panama, Papua New Guinea, \r\nParaguay, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, \r\nQatar, Republic of Korea, Republic of Moldova, \r\nRomania, Russian Federation, Rwanda, Saint \r\nKitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and \r\nthe Grenadines, Samoa, San Marino, Sao Tome \r\nand Principe, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Serbia, \r\nSeychelles, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Slovakia, \r\nSlovenia, Solomon Islands, Somalia, South \r\nAfrica, South Sudan, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sudan, \r\nSuriname, Swaziland, Switzerland, Syrian Arab \r\nRepublic, Tajikistan, Thailand, the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Timor-Leste, \r\nTogo, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, \r\nTurkey, Turkmenistan, Tuvalu, Uganda, Ukraine, \r\nUnited Arab Emirates, United Kingdom of Great \r\nBritain and Northern Ireland, United Republic of \r\nTanzania, Uruguay, Uzbekistan, Vanuatu, \r\nVenezuela (Bolivarian Republic of), Viet Nam, \r\nYemen, Zambia, Zimbabwe \r\nAgainst: \r\n Israel, United States of America \r\nAbstaining: \r\n Marshall Islands, Micronesia (Federated States \r\nof), Palau \r\n Draft resolution A/66/L.4 was adopted by 186 \r\nvotes to 2, with 3 abstentions (resolution 66/6). \r\n [Subsequently, the delegation of Sweden advised \r\nthe Secretariat that it had intended to vote in \r\nfavour.] \r\n The President: Before giving the floor to \r\nspeakers in explanation of vote after the voting, may I \r\nremind delegations that explanations of vote are \r\nlimited to 10 minutes and should be made by \r\ndelegations from their seats. \r\n Mr. Sobków (Poland): I have the honour to speak \r\non behalf of the States members of the European Union \r\n(EU). The candidate countries Croatia, the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Montenegro; the \r\ncountries of the Stabilization and Association Process \r\nand potential candidates Albania and Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina; as well as the Republic of Moldova align \r\nthemselves with this explanation of vote. \r\n A/66/PV.41\r\n \r\n25 11-56249 \r\n \r\n Mr. Archondo (Plurinational State of Bolivia), \r\nVice-President, took the Chair. \r\n The United States trade policy towards Cuba is \r\nfundamentally a bilateral issue. However, American \r\nlegislation, such as the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 \r\nand the Helms-Burton Act of 1996, has extended the \r\neffects of the United States embargo to third-party \r\ncountries. In the framework of its Common \r\nCommercial Policy, the European Union has firmly and \r\ncontinuously opposed such extraterritorial measures. \r\n While recognizing the decision of the United \r\nStates Government to lift restrictions on remittances \r\nand family travel to Cuba, we cannot accept that \r\nunilaterally imposed measures impede our economic \r\nand commercial relations with Cuba. To address this \r\nproblem, the European Union Council of Ministers \r\nadopted, in November 1996, a regulation and a joint \r\naction to protect the interests of natural or legal \r\npersons residing in Europe against the consequences of \r\nthese Acts. Furthermore, at the May 1998 European \r\nUnion-United States summit, held in London, a \r\npackage was agreed that also sought to alleviate the \r\nproblems with extraterritorial legislation. It covered \r\nwaivers to titles III and IV of the Helms-Burton Act, a \r\ncommitment by the United States Government to resist \r\nfuture extraterritorial legislation of that kind, and an \r\nunderstanding regarding disciplines for the \r\nstrengthening of investment protection. It is urgent that \r\nthe United States implement that agreement.  \r\n The European Union’s policy towards Cuba was \r\nset out in a common position in 1996. Reaffirming the \r\nvalidity of that common position, in June 2008 the \r\nEuropean Union lifted the restrictive measures imposed \r\non Cuba in 2003. The dialogue with the authorities in \r\nHavana was resumed without preconditions and on the \r\nbasis of reciprocity and non-discrimination. Five \r\npolitical dialogue ministerial sessions have been held \r\nwith the Cuban Government to address issues of \r\ncommon interest, including human rights, which is a \r\nquestion at the core of relations with all third countries, \r\nincluding Cuba. \r\n We reaffirm our determination to pursue a results-\r\noriented comprehensive dialogue with the Cuban \r\nauthorities, as well as with representatives of civil \r\nsociety and peaceful pro-democracy opposition, in \r\naccordance with EU policies. We reiterate the right of \r\nCuban citizens to independently decide their future. \r\n We are encouraged by the release of all political \r\nprisoners from the group of 75 who were imprisoned in \r\n2003, together with other political prisoners. We \r\nreiterate our call on the Cuban Government to fully \r\ngrant its citizens internationally recognized civil, \r\npolitical and economic rights and freedoms, including \r\nthe freedom of assembly and expression and free \r\naccess to information; to ratify the International \r\nCovenant on Civil and Political Rights and the \r\nInternational Covenant on Economic, Social and \r\nCultural Rights; and, following the visit of the United \r\nNations Special Rapporteur on the right to food, to \r\nextend invitations to other rapporteurs to visit Cuba. \r\n The existing restrictions on rights and freedoms \r\nundermine and offset Cuban achievements in health \r\ncare and education. Similarly, Cuba’s domestic \r\neconomic policy seriously hampers its own economic \r\ndevelopment. In that context, we note the adoption by \r\nthe Cuban Parliament in August of a package of \r\neconomic and social reforms, and expect that these will \r\nbe extended and implemented in a manner that will \r\naddress the key concerns of the Cuban population. \r\n The economic, commercial and financial embargo \r\nimposed by the United States contributes to the \r\neconomic problems in Cuba, negatively affecting the \r\nliving standards of the Cuban people. The European \r\nUnion therefore believes that the lifting of the United \r\nStates embargo would open the Cuban economy to the \r\nbenefit of the Cuban people. Together, we again \r\nexpress our rejection of all unilateral measures directed \r\nagainst Cuba that are contrary to the commonly \r\naccepted rules of international trade. We urge the \r\nCuban authorities to bring about real improvements in \r\nall areas mentioned.  \r\n In spite of continued concerns and criticisms \r\nabout the human rights situation in Cuba, the States \r\nmembers of the European Union unanimously voted in \r\nfavour of resolution 66/6. \r\n Ms. Nujoma (Namibia): This year marks the \r\ntwentieth anniversary since the presentation of the \r\nresolution that we have just adopted (resolution 66/6), \r\nbut the blockade against Cuba is still in place. This \r\nstands in stark contrast to the overwhelming appeal by \r\nthe international community to end this unjust policy \r\nagainst the people of Cuba. In fact, this debate would \r\nnot have been necessary had the United States lifted \r\nthe blockade years ago. \r\nA/66/PV.41  \r\n \r\n11-56249 26 \r\n \r\n My delegation voted in favour of the resolution \r\nunder agenda item 41, “Necessity of ending the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed \r\nby the United States of America against Cuba”, \r\nbecause we believe in the principle of peaceful \r\ncoexistence among nations, respect for sovereign \r\nequality, open trade among nations and, above all, the \r\nspirit of good-neighbourliness. The imposition of the \r\nblockade against Cuba is an outdated form of \r\npunishment. \r\n My delegation remains concerned about the \r\npromulgation and application of laws and measures \r\nconstituting an economic, commercial or financial \r\nembargo against any friendly and peaceful country. We \r\nbelieve that the measures imposed against Cuba have \r\nserious negative implications for the overall \r\ndevelopment and well-being of the people of Cuba.  \r\n For many years, the General Assembly has, \r\nthrough its resolutions on this item, consistently \r\nrejected those sanctions and called for an end to the \r\nembargo imposed by the United States against the \r\npeople of Cuba. The blockade is negatively affecting \r\nthe economy and people of Cuba, especially women \r\nand children. It is therefore unfortunate that, today, the \r\nblockade remains intact and that the General Assembly \r\nis still seized of this issue. \r\n My delegation has always maintained the view \r\nthat the blockade against Cuba runs counter to the \r\nspirit of the United Nations Charter, international law \r\nand the Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2). The \r\nsame blockade continues to cause irreparable damage \r\nto the economic, social and cultural development of \r\nCuba, as it deprives its people of the opportunities and \r\nbenefits emanating from free trade. \r\n The Torricelli and Helms-Burton Acts are \r\nextraterritorial in nature and thus interfere with the \r\nsovereign rights of Cuba and violate the principles and \r\nrules of the international trading system. The blockade \r\ncannot be called an exclusive bilateral affair because it \r\nimpacts numerous countries. The report of the \r\nSecretary-General highlights those points of concern. \r\n We are convinced that the people of the two \r\nneighbouring countries would both stand to benefit \r\nfrom the normalization of relations and the removal of  \r\n \r\nrestrictions between them. The United States Government \r\nshould therefore heed the appeal of the international \r\ncommunity to end the blockade and promote good \r\nrelations and neighbourliness with the Government and \r\nthe people of Cuba. \r\n In our view, all human rights, whether political, \r\ncultural or economic, are inseparable. They include the \r\nright to food, health and education and, above all, the \r\nright to development. Through the blockade, the people \r\nof Cuba are being denied those fundamental rights, just \r\nbecause of the political system they have chosen. \r\n Guided by our conviction that the blockade \r\nagainst Cuba is a denial of the rights I have just \r\nhighlighted, Namibia voted in favour of the draft \r\nresolution on ending the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba. We did so to express our \r\nsolidarity with the people of Cuba, and we hope that \r\nthe United States will listen to the international \r\ncommunity’s appeal to end the blockade against Cuba. \r\n Mr. Kapambwe (Zambia): Every time the issue \r\nof lifting the United States sanctions on Cuba comes \r\nup, I am reminded of Humpty Dumpty, who said, \r\n“Words mean only that which I want them to mean”.  \r\n When we talk about democracy, what is \r\ndemocracy, if the universal resolutions of the General \r\nAssembly that call on the United States to lift the \r\nsanctions on Cuba are routinely ignored? When we talk \r\nabout the rule of law, what is the rule of law, if General \r\nAssembly resolutions that have declared United States \r\nsanctions illegal continue to be ignored? Is the law a \r\nlaw only when one decides that it is law? When we talk \r\nabout the sovereign equality of States in the United \r\nNations, is it equality only when it involves those \r\nwhom we like? When we talk about freedom, is it \r\nfreedom only when the views and political systems of \r\nother countries agree with one’s own?  \r\n I thought that true democracy and true freedom \r\nembrace diversity: diversity of opinion, of thought, of \r\npolitical systems. Indeed, freedom also includes the \r\nright even to be wrong. My delegation has voted in \r\nfavour of resolution 66/6 because that is the right thing \r\nto do. \r\n  The meeting rose at 1.05 p.m. \r\n"
