(Qatar) \r\n \r\n \r\n In the absence of the President, Mr. Cazeau \r\n(Haiti), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 3.15 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 41 (continued) \r\n \r\nNecessity of ending the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/66/114) \r\n \r\n Mr. Jahangiri (Islamic Republic of Iran): The \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran voted in favour of resolution \r\n66/6, and would like to put on record the following \r\nexplanation of vote following the resolution’s adoption. \r\n The overwhelming support for the resolution \r\nreflects yet again the common understanding and will \r\nof the international community concerning the \r\ninhuman and illegitimate embargo imposed by the \r\nUnited States on the Cuban Government and people. \r\nDepriving civilian populations of their economic and \r\nsocial rights infringes upon their basic human rights \r\nand is therefore illegal. Indeed, this is the main feature \r\nof sanctions as we know them today. Economic \r\nblockades and sanctions are completely illegitimate for \r\nthe following reasons. \r\n There is no case of economic sanctions against \r\ndeveloping countries or territories where arrogant \r\nPowers are not behind those sanctions. Such sanctions \r\nhave become a tool not for encouraging international \r\npeace and security but for imposing the hegemonic \r\nintentions of big Powers on other nations. Worst of all, \r\nsanctions, including ostensibly legitimate examples, \r\nalways end by targeting the daily lives of civilians, \r\nwith a dramatic impact on people’s basic human rights. \r\nThe victimization of ordinary, innocent people is a sine \r\nqua non of sanctions. There is ample evidence that \r\nsanctions above all imperil the economic growth and \r\nprosperity of civilians. \r\n Despite all the damage that sanctions do, they \r\nhave been proven to be futile. There is no strong proof \r\nthat independent nations will compromise their valued \r\nnational interests because of sanctions that reflect the \r\nantagonistic will of a hegemonic Power. The argument \r\nthat sanctions are a better option than more peaceful \r\nmeasures is also irrelevant. Warmongers are not \r\nconcerned about the sequence of punitive measures. \r\nThey will undoubtedly resort to force whenever they \r\ndeem necessary, with or without first using other \r\nmeans and with or without United Nations approval. \r\nSanctions will not stop them from exercising force \r\nshould they themselves find that desirable. \r\n However, the most unjustifiable and deplorable \r\nform of sanctions is the imposition of unilateral \r\nblockades and the extraterritorial application of \r\ndomestic laws on the part of one State, which, \r\nunsurprisingly, happens to be the United States of \r\nAmerica. These affect not only the population on \r\nwhom sanctions are imposed but also the interests of \r\nthird parties, which are disproportionately and \r\nunreasonably punished. Numerous international \r\ndocuments have called for the immediate nullification \r\nof all such measures; indeed, one may wonder what \r\nA/66/PV.42  \r\n \r\n11-56354 2 \r\n \r\nmore can be done to convince the Government of the \r\nUnited States to lift the inhuman and futile economic \r\nblockade against the Government and people of Cuba; \r\nwhat more should be said in arguing that such illegal \r\nmeasures flagrantly violate the United Nations Charter, \r\nthe rule of international law, the multilateral trading \r\nsystem, the standards and principles governing \r\nrelations among States, as well as the clear will of the \r\ninternational community — the will that has been \r\nunequivocally expressed in so many resolutions \r\nadopted by the Assembly. \r\n The unilateral economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States serves \r\nno purpose other than inflicting tremendous hardship \r\nand suffering on ordinary civilians, especially women \r\nand children. The embargo has seriously jeopardized \r\nthe legitimate rights and interests of Cuba and other \r\nStates. It runs counter to the principles of international \r\nlaw and contradicts the letter and spirit of the Charter \r\nof the United Nations. \r\n The Islamic Republic of Iran strongly rejects, and \r\nremains opposed to, the application of unilateral \r\neconomic and trade measures by one State against \r\nanother, as well as to the extraterritorial application \r\nand effects of national legislation on the sovereignty of \r\nother States. We oppose and condemn these measures \r\nor laws and their continued application and will do \r\neverything to effectively thwart them. We urge other \r\nStates to do likewise and to refrain from recognizing, \r\nadopting or implementing extraterritorial or unilateral \r\ncoercive measures or laws, including unilateral \r\neconomic sanctions, other intimidating measures and \r\narbitrary travel restrictions that are designed to exert \r\npressure on other countries, threaten their sovereignty, \r\nindependence and freedom of trade and investment, \r\nand prevent them from exercising their right to make \r\ndecisions through their own free will.  \r\n The Islamic Republic of Iran shares the concern \r\nof the Cuban people and Government, and therefore \r\nemphasizes the urgent need to put an end to such \r\ninhuman measures against Cuba and other developing \r\ncountries and to fully implement the resolution just \r\nadopted. \r\n In conclusion, sanctions, whosoever imposes \r\nthem and under whatsoever pretext or guise, remain \r\nillegitimate, futile and misguidedly punitive.  \r\n Mrs. Chikava (Zimbabwe): I too would like to \r\ncommence with an expression of condolences to the \r\nGovernment and people of Turkey, who have been so \r\ntragically affected by the recent earthquake. We also \r\nacknowledge the presence here today of the Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Cuba. He is most \r\nwelcome to witness our deliberations. \r\n I wish to thank the Secretary-General for his \r\ncomprehensive report on the necessity of ending the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed \r\nby the United States of America against Cuba \r\n(A/66/114). I also associate myself with the statement \r\nmade by the representative of Argentina, who spoke on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China.  \r\n For the past 20 consecutive years, an \r\noverwhelming number of the States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations have voted in favour of the resolution \r\ncalling for the lifting of the United States embargo \r\nagainst Cuba. Each year we have made it clear that the \r\nblockade is not only in violation of international law \r\nbut it is also counter to the purposes and principles of \r\nthe United Nations set forth in its Charter, of which the \r\nUnited States of America is itself a founding signatory. \r\nThe embargo violates Cuba’s right to do business with \r\nthe rest of the international community and, in the \r\nprocess, frustrates the country’s efforts to achieve the \r\ninternationally agreed development goals, including \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. It is clear that the \r\nembargo denies Cuba access to markets, development \r\naid from international financial institutions and \r\ntechnology transfers, which are all important for the \r\ndevelopment of the Cuban economy and for the well-\r\nbeing and advancement of its people. \r\n My country, Zimbabwe, fully understands the \r\ndifficulties associated with these illegal and ill-\r\nconceived measures, as we are also a victim of similar \r\nunilateral measures. We reject the passing of laws and \r\nregulations on weaker and small nations by the more \r\npowerful with the goal of destabilizing them for regime \r\nchange purposes. The people of Cuba must be left to \r\nthemselves to pursue their own economic and social \r\ndevelopment agenda.  \r\n One of the ironies resulting from such pernicious \r\nmeasures is the bringing together of the Government \r\nand people of the country under punishment. National \r\npride takes root to defeat this foreign interference. As \r\nwe have done in the past, my delegation expresses its \r\nsolidarity with the Government and the people of \r\nCuba. Accordingly, we voted in favour of resolution \r\n66/6.  \r\n A/66/PV.42\r\n \r\n3 11-56354 \r\n \r\n Mr. Morejón (Ecuador) (spoke in Spanish): I \r\nwelcome the presence in the Hall of Mr. Bruno \r\nRodríguez Parrilla, Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nCuba. Through him, we once again express to our \r\nbrother country of Cuba our most sincere \r\ncongratulations on this new triumph of the truth. \r\n The great support that resolution 66/6 received in \r\nthe voting is practically tantamount to a unanimous \r\nadoption, which makes this vote a historic one. \r\nFollowing the logic of common sense, this repeated \r\nappeal by the General Assembly should be sufficient to \r\nput an end to the cruel blockade against Cuba. The \r\ndelegation of Ecuador voted in favour of resolution \r\n66/6, as we believe that it is totally unacceptable to \r\nextend unilateral the extraterritorial measures against a \r\nthird country, such as those contained in the United \r\nStates Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 and the Helms-\r\nBurton Act of 1996.  \r\n The blockade imposed against the brother \r\nRepublic of Cuba is in violation of the fundamental \r\ntenets of international law, international humanitarian \r\nlaw, the Charter of the United Nations and the \r\nprinciples governing peaceful relations among States. \r\nThe blockade causes serious economic and social \r\ndamage to the Caribbean region and indeed has \r\nbrought a humanitarian crisis of great magnitude to the \r\nbrotherly Cuban people, as Mr. Rodríguez Parrilla \r\nexplained to us in detail this morning.  \r\n In supporting resolution 66/6, Ecuador joins the \r\nmajority of voices issuing from the States Members of \r\nthe United Nations that demand without delay the \r\nimmediate and unconditional end to all the unilateral \r\nmeasures imposed against our dear brother Republic of \r\nCuba. \r\n I repeat that Ecuador trusts that the logic of \r\ncommon sense and justice will prevail so that Cuba \r\nmay enjoy its legitimate right to move forward without \r\nthis searing and cruel blockade. \r\n Mr. Onemola (Nigeria): Nigeria voted in favour \r\nof resolution 66/6. I would like to highlight the \r\nfollowing salient issues that informed our action. \r\nBefore doing so, however, let me commend the \r\nSecretary-General for his report (A/66/114) on the \r\nimplementation of resolution 65/6, which calls for an \r\nend to the unilateral imposition of the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo on Cuba. I would \r\nalso commend Member States for their positive \r\nresponse to the request contained in that resolution.  \r\n My delegation aligns itself with the statements \r\nmade by the representatives of Argentina and Egypt, \r\nwho spoke on behalf of the Group of 77 and China and \r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement, respectively. We also \r\nassociate ourselves with the statement made by the \r\nrepresentative of Kenya, who spoke on behalf of the \r\nGroup of African States.  \r\n Nigeria is fully committed to the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the United Nations as contained in the \r\nCharter of the Organization, in particular the principles \r\nof the sovereign equality of States, non-interference in \r\ntheir internal affairs and the freedom of international \r\ntrade and navigation. Nigeria believes in the \r\ninalienable right of every State to decide on the \r\ndevelopment model that suits its environment and \r\npeople. In this regard, Nigeria maintains friendly \r\nrelations with all States and does not favour unilateral \r\npunitive measures to settle political disputes, especially \r\nwhen applied extraterritorially. \r\n My delegation is not comfortable with the \r\ncontinuation of the economic embargo imposed on \r\nCuba, because of the obvious adverse economic impact \r\nand humanitarian consequences it has brought to the \r\nCuban people. The embargo runs counter to the \r\nprinciples of multilateralism, international law, \r\nsovereignty and free trade — principles that we hold \r\ndear and which this body has nobly championed over \r\nthe years. Thus, together with the overwhelming \r\nmajority of the international community, Nigeria \r\nopposes the needless punishment of an innocent people \r\nand therefore favours dismantling not only the \r\nstructures set up to enforce the embargo but also the \r\nlogic underpinning its existence. It is against that \r\nbackdrop that my delegation voted for the resolution.  \r\n Nigeria is not oblivious to certain positive effects \r\nof opposing the embargo. Although such a response is \r\nlong overdue, Nigeria is nonetheless heartened by, and \r\nindeed welcomes, the position taken by the United \r\nStates to remove a number of restrictions on travel to \r\nCuba from the United States. \r\n We reiterate that concerted engagement and \r\npeaceful negotiation remain the only acceptable means \r\nfor advancing long-term peace and stability. We \r\ntherefore appeal to the international community to \r\nexert all the possible necessary pressure on both Cuba \r\nand the United States to exercise more flexibility in \r\nmoving towards greater constructive and productive \r\nA/66/PV.42  \r\n \r\n11-56354 4 \r\n \r\nengagement, with a view to reaching a definitive \r\nresolution of their differences. \r\n Such a démarche would lead not only to the \r\nlifting of the longest-lasting trade embargo in human \r\nhistory, but also to an improvement in the dignity of \r\nhuman coexistence and to the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace. \r\n Mr. Thu (Myanmar): I take the floor to explain \r\nmy delegation’s position on resolution 66/6, entitled \r\n“Necessity of ending the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba”.  \r\n Since the resolution was first introduced, at the \r\nforty-seventh session of the General Assembly, in \r\n1992, my delegation has taken a principled position to \r\nside with the people of Cuba, in particular the elderly, \r\nwomen and children. We hold a sympathetic view that \r\nthe hardship and suffering caused by the unilateral \r\nsanctions dramatically affect the innocent people of \r\nCuba. Myanmar fully subscribes to the purposes and \r\nprinciples enshrined in the Charter of the United \r\nNations, especially the principle of the sovereign \r\nequality of nations. \r\n We firmly believe that only through peaceful \r\ncoexistence and non-interference in the internal affairs \r\nof countries can international peace and security be \r\nsustainable. The true views of the international \r\ncommunity are vividly expressed yearly by the \r\nadoption of this resolution, which calls for an end to \r\nthe economic, commercial and financial embargo. The \r\nembargo against Cuba not only contradicts the \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations but also \r\ndeviates from international law. For those reasons, as \r\nin previous years, Myanmar voted in favour of \r\nresolution 66/6. \r\n Mr. Almeida (Brazil) (spoke in Spanish): The \r\neconomic, commercial and financial blockade against \r\nCuba is an issue that has been before us for virtually \r\n50 years. Today, for the twentieth time in its history, \r\nthe General Assembly almost unanimously rejected the \r\nembargo. Once again, Brazil has asserted its \r\nunwavering support for that cause, voting in favour of \r\nresolution 66/6.  \r\n Among the many flagrant violations of \r\ninternational law that regrettably continue to affect \r\ninternational relations, few have outlasted the embargo. \r\nThat situation is in contrast to the virtually unanimous \r\nacknowledgment that there is a need to lift it.  \r\n Besides being illegal, the blockade against Cuba \r\nhas extremely damaging effects on the Cuban people, \r\nwhile also affecting the rights of third countries. An \r\nunequivocal, swift and decisive halt to the embargo \r\nwould constitute an important step towards \r\nnormalizing regional relations and promoting \r\ncooperation in the Americas.  \r\n In 2009, we noted initial progress towards an \r\neasing of the blockade. We welcome and are closely \r\nfollowing the measures announced in January in \r\nWashington, D.C. Those measures, positive as they \r\nmay be, do not fundamentally alter the embargo; nor \r\ndo they mitigate the terrible effects it imposes on the \r\nCuban people and on third countries.  \r\n We join the unmistakable voice of the \r\ninternational community calling for an end to the \r\nblockade against Cuba, as expressed once again in the \r\nclearest terms by this resolution.  \r\n Mr. Adi (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in \r\nArabic): At the outset, I would like to say that my \r\ncountry, Syria, aligns itself with the statements made \r\nby the representative of Argentina on behalf of the \r\nGroup of 77 and China, the representative of Egypt on \r\nbehalf of the Non-Aligned Movement and the \r\nrepresentative of Kazakhstan on behalf of the \r\nOrganization of Islamic Cooperation.  \r\n The purposes and principles of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations refer to the right of States to exercise \r\nsovereignty on their territory and the right to \r\nnon-intervention in their internal affairs. Since its \r\nestablishment, in 1945, the decisions and resolutions of \r\nthe United Nations have referred to the sacred nature of \r\nthose purposes and principles, which the Members of \r\nthe United Nations should all respect insofar as the \r\nCharter is the constitution that represents the ultimate \r\npoint of reference for the Organization. \r\n Given that unilateral embargo imposed on Cuba \r\nby the United States, along with the new measures to \r\ntighten it, contradict the principles of international law, \r\ninternational humanitarian law and the rules and norms \r\nthat govern relations between States — in particular \r\nthe principles of the sovereign equality of States, \r\nnon-intervention in their internal affairs and the \r\nfreedom of international navigation and trade — this \r\nembargo is without doubt illegal. It contradicts the \r\n A/66/PV.42\r\n \r\n5 11-56354 \r\n \r\ncriteria accepted by the international community for \r\naddressing the relations between States. \r\n It also represents an unprecedented challenge to \r\ninternational law and to the legal credibility of \r\nAmerican policies. In that regard, the Syrian Arab \r\nRepublic would like to refer to the negative effects of \r\nsuch illegal unilateral measures on lives and societies \r\naround the world, especially in developing countries. \r\nWe consider this a tool for Western hegemony that \r\ncould lead to incitement against the West. \r\n The majority of such measures are being imposed \r\nby Western countries, especially by the United States \r\nof America and European countries, in particular with \r\nthe purpose of weakening the Governments of States \r\nthat are Members of the United Nations or to exert \r\npressure on them to force them to adopt certain \r\nmeasures or to change their policies. All those facts \r\nwere confirmed by the report of the Economic and \r\nSocial Commission for Western Asia that was \r\ncontained in the Secretary-General’s report (A/66/138, \r\nannex II). \r\n The embargo imposed on Cuba for almost \r\n50 years has created an unacceptable precedent that \r\nfalls outside of international law. It has also subjected \r\nCuba to all kinds of political, social and economic \r\ndamage. It has deepened the suffering of the Cuban \r\npeople. And it has placed the United States of America \r\nin direct confrontation with the international \r\ncommunity. The embargo has affected the tireless \r\nefforts by the Cuban people to achieve welfare and \r\nprogress. The embargo continues to harm the Cuban \r\neconomy, at a cost of tens of billions of dollars — to \r\nsay nothing of indirect damages, which also amount to \r\ntens of billions of dollars. Moreover, the embargo \r\nimpedes the educational and social development of the \r\nCuban people and deprives them of the opportunities \r\nand benefits of free trade. It also violates their basic \r\nhuman rights and freedoms, including the rights to life \r\nand development. \r\n The General Assembly has discussed this item for \r\n20 consecutive years. It has issued resolutions founded \r\non its overwhelming collective consensus. However, \r\nthe economic, financial, social and commercial \r\nembargo is still imposed on Cuba. The support of \r\n186 countries for resolution 66/6 at this session \r\nconfirms yet again that the vast majority of the \r\ninternational community finds it necessary to put an \r\nend to the embargo imposed on Cuba and that it is \r\ncompletely illegal. \r\n Sanctions imposed by some States on developing \r\ncountries, including sanctions by European countries \r\nand the United States against the Syrian Arab Republic, \r\nrepresent an ongoing collective punishment pursued by \r\nthose States under the pretext of protecting human \r\nrights. They are a blatant violation of the principles of \r\ninternational law. They undermine the principle of the \r\nequal sovereignty of States. They constitute a violation \r\nof relevant General Assembly resolutions, the most \r\nrecent being resolution 64/189. They also violate \r\nresolution 62/183 and resolution 65/217, entitled \r\n“Human rights and unilateral coercive measures”, \r\nwhich states that unilateral economic measures damage \r\ntrade relations among States and impede the full \r\nrealization of the rights set out in the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights and other human rights \r\ninstruments, specifically the right of individuals and \r\npeoples to development.  \r\n It is incumbent upon the General Assembly to \r\ntake the measures necessary to put an end to the \r\npolicies of embargo, unilateral economic sanctions and \r\nother hostile policies pursued by some States outside \r\nthe framework of international law against both \r\nneighbouring and geographically distant countries.  \r\n The Syrian Arab Republic considers that such \r\nunilateral economic sanctions by the United States of \r\nAmerica, the European Union and other States are a \r\nmeans of political and economic coercion that aim to \r\nimpede the political independence and decision-making \r\nof the Syrian Arab Republic. Taking as a clear example \r\nof this the international community’s rejection of the \r\nAmerican embargo against Cuba and the Israeli \r\nembargo against Gaza, the Syrian Arab Republic and \r\nthe overwhelming majority of States consider that the \r\ncontinued imposition by some States Members of the \r\nOrganization of unilateral economic sanctions against \r\ndeveloping countries represents a violation of the \r\nprinciples of international law and the rules of \r\ninternational trade. Such sanctions damage the \r\neconomies and development efforts of developing \r\ncountries, undermine international economic \r\ncooperation and impede international efforts to move \r\ntowards an open and non-discriminatory multilateral \r\ntrade system.  \r\n Those facts are confirmed by the summary of the \r\nTrade and Development Report of the United Nations \r\nA/66/PV.42  \r\n \r\n11-56354 6 \r\n \r\nConference on Trade and Development, which \r\ndiscusses the latest developments regarding the effect \r\nof unilateral sanctions on the trade of targeted \r\ncountries, including the Syrian Arab Republic. \r\n Sanctions affect mainly trade revenue, foreign \r\nexchange earnings and employment opportunities. \r\nThey lead to the deterioration of economic and social \r\nconditions of populations, especially for middle- and \r\nlow-income people. We hope that all forms of embargo \r\nimposed by the United States against Cuba will be \r\nlifted and that other embargoes will also lifted, \r\nincluding that against Syria. We hope that the voice of \r\nthe international community represented by the \r\nGeneral Assembly and other international organizations \r\nand institutions will be heard by the United States of \r\nAmerica. We hope that the legislative branch in the \r\nUnited States will heed that voice.  \r\n It is for those reasons that we voted in favour of \r\nresolution 66/6. \r\n Mrs. Waffa-Ogoo (Gambia): My delegation is of \r\nthe view that, given the difficult challenges confronting \r\nall nations, big or small, rich or poor, this is neither the \r\ntime nor the season to impose sanctions on States or to \r\nreinforce existing ones. Even in the best of times, \r\nsanctions, embargoes and economic blockades \r\ninvariably inflict untold suffering on the citizens of the \r\ncountry being targeted by such punitive measures. As \r\nthe global financial and economic crisis continues \r\nunabated, all nations are experiencing stress and are \r\nunder constant pressure from the negative impacts of \r\nthe crisis, and more so those that are targeted by \r\nblockades, such as the one carried on under the Helms-\r\nBurton Act, which has been unjustly imposed on Cuba \r\nby the Government of the United States since 1961. \r\n The economic, commercial and financial embargo \r\nagainst Cuba is an aggression on that sovereign State \r\nthat puts its economy under siege, with the consequent \r\nnegative downstream effects on ordinary Cubans, \r\nparticularly vulnerable groups, resulting in the \r\ndeterioration of their living standards. As many \r\ndelegations have pointed out, the embargo continues to \r\nundermine the capacity of the heroic Cuban people to \r\nachieve sustainable development, the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and other internationally agreed \r\ndevelopment goals.  \r\n In the light of what I have just said, the \r\nGovernment of the Gambia has been consistent and \r\nunwavering in its support of the Government and \r\npeople of Cuba, in denouncing the embargo at every \r\nopportunity and in calling on the United States to \r\nrepeal the laws relating to the blockade of Cuba. The \r\nGambia has voted in support of resolution 66/6, and we \r\nwill continue to support the resolutions of the \r\nAssembly on the necessity of ending the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed on Cuba \r\nuntil such time as the United States finally heeds the \r\ndeafening calls by Member States and the international \r\ncommunity and decides to put an end to the unjust \r\npunitive sanctions it has imposed on the people of \r\nCuba. \r\n In conclusion, I wish to align my statement with \r\nthose made earlier by the representatives of Argentina, \r\nEgypt, Kenya and Kazakhstan on behalf of the Group \r\nof 77 and China, the Non-Aligned Movement, the \r\nGroup of African States and the Organization of \r\nIslamic Cooperation, respectively. In addition, I wish \r\nto thank the Secretary-General for his report \r\n(A/66/114). \r\n Mr. Daoud (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): Because \r\nthere is great awareness on the part of the international \r\ncommunity and a total rejection by Member States of \r\nthe adoption of unilateral coercive economic measures \r\nbeyond a country’s borders, and because such measures \r\nare a means of political and economic coercion, we are \r\ntoday considering agenda item 41, entitled “Necessity \r\nof ending the economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo imposed by the United States against Cuba”. \r\nThe continued support for this resolution year after \r\nyear is an indication of the total rejection of the \r\nunilateral embargo imposed on Cuba due to its blatant \r\nviolation of the basic principles of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, international law and the norms \r\ngoverning economic, financial and commercial \r\nrelations among States. \r\n The Government of the Sudan is pursuing a \r\npolicy based on full respect for international law, the \r\nprinciples of the Charter and the sovereign equality of \r\nStates and non-interference in their internal affairs. In \r\naccordance with the position of the Sudan and with \r\nwhat I have just mentioned, my delegation condemns \r\nthe imposition of economic and political sanctions on \r\ndeveloping countries as a blatant violation of the \r\nCharter, and notes their destructive effects on the \r\nefforts of those countries to achieve sustainable \r\ndevelopment. My delegation therefore rejects unilateral \r\nsanctions, which since November 1997 have even \r\naffected our country, for they violate the legitimate \r\n A/66/PV.42\r\n \r\n7 11-56354 \r\n \r\nright of the people of the Sudan to choose the \r\neconomic, social and political regimes conducive to \r\nachieving their aspirations and expectations. \r\n The unilateral measures imposed by the United \r\nStates against the Sudan continue to negatively affect \r\nthe living conditions of the Sudanese people. They also \r\nhinder the Sudanese Government’s efforts to achieve \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals, eliminate poverty, \r\nstrengthen health care and education and obtain the \r\nnecessary technology to promote human and \r\nagricultural development. \r\n Despite the economic and commercial embargo \r\non the Sudan, my country continues to strengthen its \r\nbilateral, economic and political relations with \r\ndeveloping countries, including countries of the South \r\nand many developed countries, which has had positive \r\neffects on its economic and social development to date. \r\n The Sudan therefore calls for the establishment of \r\na better world where all States, big or small, can \r\npeacefully coexist. Such peaceful coexistence will \r\nrequire the commitment of all States to the basic \r\nprinciples of the Charter and to managing inter-State \r\nrelations in a sound manner. \r\n In that respect, we urge the States that have taken \r\nunilateral measures or enacted legislation that affect \r\nthe sovereignty of States to take the necessary steps to \r\ninvalidate or repeal such measures, in line with \r\nstrengthening respect for the sovereignty of other \r\nStates and for the Charter of the United Nations. Such \r\nmeasures will also strengthen mutual cooperation \r\naimed at achieving peace, development and prosperity \r\nfor all peoples. \r\n Mrs. Phommachanh (Lao People’s Democratic \r\nRepublic) (spoke in French): As in previous years, the \r\nLao People’s Democratic Republic has voted in favour \r\nof resolution 66/6, which was introduced in the \r\nAssembly by His Excellency Mr. Bruno Rodríguez \r\nParrilla, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Cuba, whose \r\npresence here today we welcome. \r\n My delegation associates itself with the \r\nstatements delivered by the representative of Argentina \r\non behalf of the Group of 77 and China and by the \r\nrepresentative of Egypt on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement.  \r\n For the twentieth consecutive year, the General \r\nAssembly has adopted by an overwhelming majority a \r\nresolution calling for an end to the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial blockade imposed on Cuba \r\nby the United States of America and calling on all \r\nStates to respect the Charter of the United Nations and \r\nthe norms of international law and to annul or repeal \r\nall laws resulting in extraterritorial effects that violate \r\nthe sovereignty of States and the legitimate interests of \r\nentities and persons under their jurisdiction, as well as \r\nof freedom of trade and navigation. \r\n Despite the repeated calls made by the General \r\nAssembly, the embargo and its extraterritorial effects \r\nremain fully in force. That is a grave violation of the \r\npurposes and principles of the Charter and of relevant \r\nresolutions of the United Nations. The embargo has \r\nalso caused considerable economic and financial losses \r\nfor Cuba. It hinders the efforts of the Cuban people to \r\neliminate poverty, promote economic and social \r\ndevelopment and achieve the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. It also hinders their right to life and to \r\ndevelopment. It prevents Cuba from maintaining \r\nnormal economic, commercial and financial relations \r\nwith other countries. Consequently, the Lao People’s \r\nDemocratic Republic expresses its opposition once \r\nagain to the economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo which has been unilaterally imposed and \r\nmaintained for a half century by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba. \r\n We reiterate our support and unfailing solidarity \r\nwith the Cuban people and we join the call made by the \r\ninternational community for the immediate end of the \r\nembargo imposed on Cuba and on its people. \r\n Mr. Bart (Saint Kitts and Nevis): Saint Kitts and \r\nNevis would like to add its voice in support of agenda \r\nitem 41, entitled “Necessity of ending the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the \r\nUnited States of America against Cuba”, and to give \r\nour reasons for voting in favour of resolution 66/6.  \r\n My delegation associates itself with the \r\nstatements made by the representatives of Belize and \r\nArgentina on behalf of the Caribbean Community and \r\nthe Group of 77 and China, respectively. \r\n Over the years, Saint Kitts and Nevis has had \r\ngood relations with the United States of America. That \r\ncountry continues to be one of our closest and strongest \r\npartners. We respect the role that the United States of \r\nAmerica has played in international relations and in the \r\nestablishment and promotion of this very body. It is a \r\nglobal leader, and we acknowledge and remain grateful \r\nfor its role in international affairs. \r\nA/66/PV.42  \r\n \r\n11-56354 8 \r\n \r\n We recognize its recent concession on the matter \r\nof the Cuban embargo. However, that is not enough. \r\nFriends must tell friends when they are wrong or \r\nmisguided, and must be prepared to speak truth to \r\npower when it is right to do so. Today, in supporting \r\nand voting for the resolution, Saint Kitts and Nevis, \r\ndespite its size, continues to be an advocate of that \r\ntruth. \r\n This is an extremely important matter that goes to \r\nthe very core of international law, sovereignty, \r\nnon-intervention and the strengthened role of the \r\nUnited Nations in international affairs. For the past \r\n20 years, Members have voted in favour of this \r\nresolution. This year, the resolution continues to have \r\nthe overwhelming support of the international \r\ncommunity. Saint Kitts and Nevis, in its contribution to \r\nthe report of the Secretary-General (A/66/114) on this \r\nmatter, advised that we do not support or apply any \r\nlaws or measures that restrict the free flow of \r\ninternational trade. We also advised that we do not \r\napply laws with extraterritorial effect that impinge on \r\nthe sovereignty of other States and the legitimate \r\ninterests of entities or persons under their jurisdiction. \r\nThis is a principled position adopted by Member States \r\nof this body. \r\n Saint Kitts and Nevis therefore feels very \r\nstrongly about bringing the embargo imposed on Cuba \r\nto an end. Cuba is one of our closest allies and is a \r\npan-Caribbean partner. It has aided in the development \r\nof the health care system and other areas in Saint Kitts \r\nand Nevis. There is much from which the international \r\ncommunity has benefited and can benefit in \r\ncooperating with Cuba, just as Saint Kitts and Nevis \r\nhas benefited. \r\n We see this embargo as a burden on our brothers \r\nand sisters in Cuba. The negative impact on the \r\neconomy of that small developing State is quite \r\nprofound, and unfair to the people of Cuba. The \r\ninternational community remains in the grip of a global \r\nrecession. While many of us rely on partnership with \r\nother countries to recover, Cuba remains stunted by the \r\nembargo and unable to contribute to the economies of \r\nscale generated by such great partnerships. This goes \r\nagainst the very principle of partnership and free \r\ntrade — the very principles held dear by those who \r\nsupport the embargo. The fact that the overwhelming \r\nmajority of Member States continue to support the \r\nresolution is compelling evidence that the embargo is \r\nwrong. The impact that the embargo continues to have \r\non access to modern medical technology and drugs \r\ncannot be ignored. \r\n This embargo is wrong on all levels, but none \r\nmore so than on humanitarian grounds. We implore all \r\nMember States to respect the sanctity of the General \r\nAssembly and the decisions it makes. Failure to do so \r\nis an affront to multilateralism and undermines the \r\nfunctioning of the United Nations system. It is my \r\ndelegation’s hope that the two countries, Cuba and the \r\nUnited States of America, can improve their \r\nrelationship and embark on a process of partnership \r\nand cooperation. \r\n There is much we can learn from each other, but \r\nthe embargo remains an impediment to that progress. \r\nThat is why Saint Kitts and Nevis supports resolution \r\n66/6 and voted in favour of it, and why we repeat our \r\ncall on both countries to find common ground so that \r\nthe entire international community can move on from \r\nthis impasse. We call on the United States to \r\ndiscontinue this embargo, because, for all the good the \r\nUnited States may do, the embargo continues to stain \r\nits image and character. \r\n Mr. Sin Son Ho (Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea): The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea \r\nwould like to sincerely congratulate the Cuban \r\ndelegation on the overwhelming support for the \r\nadoption at this morning’s meeting of resolution 66/6, \r\nentitled “Necessity of ending the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the \r\nUnited States of America against Cuba”. It is another \r\nvictory in the just struggle of the Cuban people to \r\noppose foreign pressure and coercive acts and to foster \r\ntheir country’s development. \r\n It has been 20 years since this resolution was first \r\nofficially introduced for consideration at the General \r\nAssembly, resulting in the adoption of resolution \r\n47/19. In the past few decades, many documents have \r\nbeen adopted at major international and regional \r\nmeetings, including at the General Assembly and at the \r\nSummits of the Non-Aligned Movement, denouncing \r\nthe United States embargo against Cuba. Demand \r\ncontinues to grow at the global level for the \r\ntermination of the United States unilateral coercive \r\nmeasures against Cuba. Nevertheless, the unilateral \r\nand immoral United States embargo on Cuba, which \r\nwas imposed half a century ago, still remains in place, \r\neven today, after the first decade of the new century \r\nhas already ended. It causes serious problems for the \r\n A/66/PV.42\r\n \r\n9 11-56354 \r\n \r\nCuban Government and people in their efforts towards \r\neconomic and social development, inflicting hundreds \r\nof billions of dollars in economic damage on the \r\ncountry. The embargo, being extraterritorial in nature, \r\nalso seriously affects third countries that have \r\neconomic and commercial relations with Cuba. \r\n It is evident that the United States embargo on \r\nCuba is aimed at overthrowing the social system freely \r\nchosen by the Cuban people. All these facts prove \r\nclearly that the United States leaves no stone unturned \r\nin pursuing its political agenda, and that it unilaterally \r\ndefies recognized international law and the unanimous \r\ndemands of the international community. My \r\ndelegation strongly condemns the United States \r\nembargo against Cuba, considering that it violates the \r\nUnited Nations Charter and international law in every \r\naspect, and also flagrantly and massively infringes \r\nupon the sovereignty and right to development of Cuba \r\nand its people. My delegation takes this opportunity \r\nonce again to urge the United States to lift the \r\nunilateral, illegal and extraterritorial economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo against Cuba as \r\nsoon as possible, in response to the demand of the \r\noverwhelming majority of Member States. \r\n Finally, my delegation expresses its continuing \r\nsupport for, and solidarity with, the Cuban Government \r\nand people in their active struggle to safeguard their \r\nsovereignty and work for their just cause in the face of \r\nthis unprecedented United States embargo. \r\n Mr. Stancanelli (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nArgentina voted in favour resolution 66/6 and will \r\nfully implement its provisions, as we did with regard to \r\nthe previous General Assembly resolutions on the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed \r\nby the United States of America on Cuba.  \r\n Argentina’s act No. 24871, promulgated on \r\n5 September 1997, established a legislative framework \r\nfor the scope of foreign laws on Argentine territory. Its \r\nfirst article states that foreign laws are not valid when \r\nthey claim to have extraterritorial effect by means of an \r\neconomic embargo or restriction of investments in a \r\nspecific country designed to lead to a change of \r\nGovernment in that country or to affect its right to self-\r\ndetermination. Argentina’s vote in favour of adopting \r\nthis resolution reflects our traditional position of \r\nsupport for doing away with this kind of unilateral \r\nmeasure, as well as our commitment to the United \r\nNations Charter, international law and multilateralism. \r\n The embargo against Cuba contravenes the rules \r\nof international law and the principles of the United \r\nNations Charter. However, despite the reiterated and \r\nalmost unanimous calls for its elimination from the \r\ninternational community, and from the Assembly in \r\nparticular, the economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo on Cuba endures. Argentina joins the almost \r\nunanimous rejection of the embargo and reiterates its \r\nposition against such measures and its support for \r\nCuba against the blockade. \r\n Mr. Hamza (United Republic of Tanzania): \r\nThank you, Sir, for granting me this opportunity to \r\nspeak after the voting. My delegation aligns itself with \r\nthe statements made, respectively, by the \r\nrepresentatives of Argentina on behalf of the Group of \r\n77 and China, Egypt on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement, and Kenya on behalf of the Group of \r\nAfrican States. \r\n Please allow me to express my sincere gratitude \r\nto the Secretary-General for his comprehensive report \r\n(A/66/114) on the implementation of resolution 65/6. \r\n As we have done in previous years, this year the \r\nUnited Republic of Tanzania again joined other \r\nMember States to vote in favour of resolution 66/6, on \r\nending the economic and financial embargo on Cuba. \r\nWe have voted in support of the people of Cuba, who \r\nhave suffered economically and socially for so long. \r\n My delegation believes that the Cuban people \r\nhave the right, as stipulated in the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, to live as meaningful and as \r\nprosperous a life as any other human being in the \r\nworld. The United Republic of Tanzania would like \r\nonce again to reiterate its continued support for the \r\npeople of Cuba in ending the embargo. \r\n For many consecutive years, and by an \r\noverwhelming majority, the General Assembly has \r\nadopted resolutions that demand an end to the \r\neconomic, trade and financial blockade and embargo \r\npolicies against Cuba.  Unfortunately, however, \r\ndespite all the resolutions and repeated calls by this \r\nbody and other international agencies, the citizens of \r\nCuba continue to suffer as if the international \r\ncommunity did not care. \r\n The United Republic of Tanzania has always \r\nbelieved that an embargo of any magnitude has an \r\nadverse effect on the common people. It is always the \r\npeople who suffer the most. In my country we have a \r\nA/66/PV.42  \r\n \r\n11-56354 10 \r\n \r\nsaying that says that whenever bulls fight it is the grass \r\nthat gets hurt. It is high time for the suffering to end \r\nonce and for all.  \r\n While we welcome the encouraging steps taken \r\nby the United States since 2009, the embargo \r\nnonetheless remains largely intact. It continues to \r\nseverely constrain Cuba’s development and the \r\nimprovement of its citizens’ standard of living. We \r\nbelieve that more remains to be done to ease the \r\nsuffering of Cuban citizens. \r\n The United Republic of Tanzania is of the view \r\nthat an amicable solution could be reached as soon as \r\npossible if only the two parties could show political \r\nwill to do so. We strongly support and believe in direct \r\ndialogue between the two parties. We therefore urge \r\nthem to sit down to iron out their differences for the \r\nbetterment of Cuban citizens. \r\n Ms. Gomes (Angola): The delegation of Angola \r\nvoted in favour of resolution 66/6, which I gladly \r\nwelcome. \r\n After many years of the economic, financial and \r\ncommercial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba, the Republic of Angola joins \r\nthe international community in calling for an end to \r\nthat measure, which has lasted more than half a century \r\nand constitutes a flagrant violation of human rights and \r\nof the rights of the people of Cuba. \r\n For 20 consecutive years, the General Assembly \r\nhas adopted a resolution urging all countries, in \r\ncompliance with the Charter of the United Nations, to \r\nwithdraw all laws, regulations and extraterritorial \r\nmeasures that undermine the sovereignty of States and \r\nthe legitimate rights and interests of entities and \r\npersons under the jurisdiction of those States and affect \r\ntheir freedom of trade and navigation.  \r\n We remain perplexed that the United States \r\nembargo against Cuba remains in place. The \r\nextraterritorial policies arising from the embargo \r\nconstitute a violation of the sovereignty of States and \r\nan encroachment upon the rights of persons, entities, \r\ninstitutions and companies and upon the jurisdiction of \r\nsuch States to establish or propose economic, \r\ncommercial, financial, scientific or technical relations \r\nwith the Republic of Cuba, to the detriment of that \r\ncountry’s social and economic development. \r\n We appeal to the international community to \r\ncontinue its efforts to support a deeper engagement by \r\nboth countries in constructive dialogue in order to \r\nidentify a definitive solution to the problem. That \r\nproblem is man-made, and its solution depends only on \r\ngoodwill. We reiterate our appeal for such political \r\ngoodwill. \r\n According to the Secretary-General’s report \r\ncontained in document A/66/114, there has been no \r\nprogress towards ending the embargo, even with the \r\ntimid measures announced by the United States \r\nAdministration, which extended the embargo for an \r\nadditional year, thereby worsening the impact of its \r\nmeasures. The embargo goes beyond the financial and \r\ncommercial relations between the United States and \r\nCuba. Its effects in this globalized world severely \r\npenalize the Cuban people, since the embargo prevents \r\nthe implementation of economic programmes aimed at \r\nthe socio-economic stability of that island. \r\n By adhering to the principles embodied in the \r\nCharter of the United Nations, namely, respect for all \r\nrelevant resolutions adopted by the General Assembly, \r\nthe Republic of Angola reaffirms its commitment to the \r\nnorms of international law that support the need to \r\neliminate coercive economic measures as a means of \r\npolitical and economic persuasion. \r\n In that context, the Government of Angola voted \r\nin favour of the resolution, since the embargo is in \r\nflagrant violation of the right of sovereignty and \r\nequality among States, as well as the policy of \r\nnon-intervention in the internal affairs of other States.  \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): A \r\nrepresentative has asked to take the floor in exercise of \r\nthe right of reply. May I remind delegations that \r\nstatements in the exercise of the right of reply are \r\nlimited to 10 minutes for the first intervention and to \r\nfive minutes for the second intervention, and should be \r\nmade by delegations from their seats.  \r\n I now give the floor now to the representative of \r\nCuba. \r\n Mr. Rodríguez Parrilla (Cuba) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): I should like to express my thanks for the \r\nprofessional and fair solution found to the breakdown \r\nof the voting machine this morning.  \r\n The only justification for my speaking at this \r\nstage in the debate is the flagrant lies put forward by \r\nMr. Godard this morning. You can fool some of the \r\npeople some of the time, but not all of the people all of \r\nthe time. This morning’s statement by the \r\n A/66/PV.42\r\n \r\n11 11-56354 \r\n \r\nrepresentative of the United States was lifted directly \r\nfrom the one they made last year and in 2009. \r\nMr. Godard came here to defend the policies of \r\nPresident Bush from 2005. He also spoke to defend the \r\npolicies of Mr. Obama, except in 2009. One has to ask \r\nwhose policies he is defending. \r\n I have here a copy of the Daytona Beach Morning \r\nJournal dated 16 May 1972, stating that Mr. Ronald D. \r\nGoddard, the director of the Miami Office of the \r\nCoordinator of Cuban Affairs, had been reassigned to \r\nWashington. Mr. Goddard, who had been a Peace \r\nCorps volunteer — carrying out very interesting \r\nmissions, about which little is known, in Ecuador, \r\nNicaragua, Panama, Costa Rica, Chile and Turkey, as \r\nwell as other projects related to Central America — \r\nwas from 1969 to 1972 the head of the Miami Office of \r\nthe Coordinator of Cuban Affairs. \r\n Another declassified official document states, as \r\na sixth point, that the Coordinator will take on the \r\nsame responsibility for covert operations as for legal \r\nones. However, I agree with him that the blockade is \r\njust one facet of the United States policy against Cuba. \r\nHe is certainly well aware that the other principal \r\naspect is that of internal subversion, the deployment of \r\nagents in the service of the United States in our \r\nterritory, and the carrying out of covert operations by \r\nthe United States Agency for International \r\nDevelopment (USAID) and the Central Intelligence \r\nAgency, with millions of dollars in funding, about \r\nwhich we know only a part. \r\n As I have read out on many occasions the \r\nprovisions of the Geneva Convention on genocide, I \r\nwill ensure that a copy of it reaches the desk of the \r\nUnited States. \r\n The Government of the United States is \r\nresponsible for many extrajudicial executions, some \r\ncarried out by means of drones or unmanned aircraft, in \r\nwhich American citizens and minors have been among \r\nthose killed. It is responsible for torture, kidnapping, \r\n1,245 covert flights and secret jails in Europe. It also \r\nmaintains a concentration camp where torture is used \r\non the land it is illegally occupying in Guantánamo, \r\nCuba. \r\n The United States and Cuba are not trading \r\npartners. The possibility of purchasing food, under \r\ndifficult circumstances, in the United States is the \r\nresult of the endeavours of those sectors that oppose \r\nthe policy of the blockade. Such purchases are made \r\nunder very strict regulations that cannot be described \r\nas trade relations, even less as measures indicating \r\nflexibility. They flout all the provisions of the \r\ninternational trading system. \r\n Mr. Goddard deliberately lied by using two sets \r\nof statistics at this meeting. Specifically, he included in \r\nthe so-called donations of humanitarian aid to Cuba \r\nfunds that USAID uses to undermine constitutional \r\norder in my country; remittances that Cubans living in \r\nthe United States send to their family members, despite \r\nofficial regulations and restrictions; and donations that \r\nnon-governmental organizations provide with great \r\ndifficulty, given the position of the United States \r\nGovernment, and which in 2010 were extremely \r\nscanty. \r\n The United States has better things to do than \r\nwage wars that have killed more than a million \r\ncivilians. Instead of destabilizing foreign Governments, \r\nit would do better to heed the voices of its own people. \r\nNear where we are now, on Wall Street, instead of \r\nbrutally repressing its citizens, it should listen to what \r\nthey are saying. They are complaining that there is no \r\ntrue democracy when everything is determined by \r\neconomic power, when corporations put profits before \r\nthe protection of people, when egoism triumphs over \r\njustice, when inequality and oppression prevail in the \r\nGovernment. People complain that they have lost their \r\nhomes, their pensions and their social security \r\nprogrammes, while the rich continue to receive \r\nshocking bonuses. They complain that students are \r\nburdened by debt, the courts of justice are corrupt, and \r\nthat millions of dollars are being spent to eliminate \r\nhealth insurance contracts for workers. They also \r\nlament the fact that the United States participates in the \r\ntorture and assassination of innocent civilians \r\nextraterritorially and that it perpetuates colonialism. \r\n A total of 1,972 people have been executed in \r\nthat country since 1976 as a result of judicial errors. \r\nMore than 3,000 United States citizens are currently on \r\nDeath Row. A few weeks ago, even as the General \r\nAssembly debate was being held, the world was aghast \r\nat the unjust execution of Troy Davis. \r\n So when Mr. Goddard says that the American \r\ncitizen and USAID contractor was brought to justice in \r\nCuba for having provided Internet access to the Jewish \r\ncommunity, he knows perfectly well, being a specialist \r\nin that area, that Mr. Gross was carrying out a covert \r\nA/66/PV.42  \r\n \r\n11-56354 12 \r\n \r\noperation and that he had committed crimes that are \r\nalso punishable under United States law. \r\n In Cuba, children want to know why in that \r\ncountry terrorists are left free and anti-terrorists are \r\njailed. The five anti-terrorist fighters from Cuba have \r\nsuffered under cruel, inhuman and degrading \r\nconditions for the only crime of trying to prevent the \r\ncommission of terrorist acts against the people of the \r\nUnited States. They must all be freed, even the one \r\nwho is on conditional release and cannot rejoin his \r\nfamily. That would be an act of justice, and, at the very \r\nleast, a humanitarian one. Only in a country such as the \r\nUnited States would the Chair of the House Committee \r\non Foreign Affairs — a fierce woman — pay tribute to \r\nthe international terrorist Luis Posada Carriles, who \r\nwas responsible for the bombing of a civilian aircraft \r\nin mid-flight, and refer to the members of a children’s \r\ntheatre troupe visiting the United States as spies and \r\nterrorists. \r\n The political battle being waged today clearly \r\nshows, as Commander-in-Chief Fidel Castro Ruz wrote \r\nyesterday in an article on the genocidal role of NATO, \r\n“the need to put an end not just to the blockade but also \r\nto the system that engenders injustice on our planet, \r\ndegrades its natural resources and jeopardizes human \r\nsurvival. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): We \r\nhave heard the only speaker in exercise of the right of \r\nreply. \r\n May I take it that it is the wish of the General \r\nAssembly to conclude its consideration of agenda item \r\n41? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n  The meeting rose at 4.30 p.m. \r\n"
