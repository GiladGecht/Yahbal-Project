This \r\nproposal was adopted without a vote. \r\n I would also like to recall that, since the adoption \r\nof the report by the Credentials Committee, the \r\nfollowing Member States have submitted formal \r\ncredentials in the form required by rule 27 of the rules \r\nof procedure of the General Assembly: Moldova, \r\nMauritania, Ukraine and Uzbekistan. \r\n Finally, I would request that the General \r\nAssembly proceed to approve the second report of the \r\nCredentials Committee as contained in document \r\nA/66/360/Add.1. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): The General \r\nAssembly will now take action on the draft resolution \r\nrecommended by the Credentials Committee in \r\nparagraph 11 of its report (A/66/360/Add.1). \r\n The Credentials Committee adopted the draft \r\nresolution entitled “Credentials of representatives to \r\nA/66/PV.43  \r\n \r\n11-56448 2 \r\n \r\nthe sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly” \r\nwithout a vote. May I take it that the Assembly wishes \r\nto do the same? \r\n The draft resolution was adopted (resolution 66/1 B). \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): The General \r\nAssembly has thus concluded this stage of its \r\nconsideration of sub-item (b) of agenda item 3. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 72 \r\n \r\nReport of the International Court of Justice \r\n \r\n  Report of the International Court of Justice \r\n(A/66/4) \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/66/295) \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): The General \r\nAssembly will now consider the report of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice covering the period \r\n1 August 2010 to 31 July 2011, which is contained in \r\ndocument A/66/4. May I take it that the General \r\nAssembly takes note of the report of the International \r\nCourt of Justice? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): In connection \r\nwith this item, the Assembly also has before it a report \r\nof the Secretary-General, circulated in document \r\nA/66/295, on his Trust Fund to Assist States in the \r\nSettlement of Disputes through the International Court \r\nof Justice. \r\n It is now my great honour to welcome to United \r\nNations Headquarters His Excellency Mr. Hisashi \r\nOwada, President of the International Court of Justice, \r\nand to give him the floor. \r\n Mr. Owada, President of the International Court \r\nof Justice: It is an honour and privilege for me to \r\naddress the General Assembly for the third time as \r\nPresident of the International Court of Justice on the \r\nreport of the International Court of Justice for the \r\nperiod from 1 August 2010 to 31 July 2011 (A/66/4). I \r\nwish to take this opportunity to congratulate you, \r\nAmbassador Al-Nasser, on your election as President \r\nof the Assembly at its sixty-sixth session, and to wish \r\nyou every success in your office. \r\n I would now like, as is traditional, to present a \r\nsuccinct review of the judicial activities of the Court \r\nduring the past year, that is, from October of last year \r\nto September this year.  \r\n The international community of States continues \r\nto bring a wide variety of legal disputes to the Court. \r\nSince I addressed the Assembly in October 2010 (see \r\nA/65/PV.38), the Court has altogether rendered four \r\njudgments and three orders. They are a judgment on \r\nthe merits in the case concerning Ahmadou Sadio \r\nDiallo (Republic of Guinea v. Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo); one order on provisional measures, in the \r\ncase concerning Certain Activities carried out by \r\nNicaragua in the Border Area (Costa Rica v. \r\nNicaragua); a judgment on preliminary objections in \r\nthe case concerning Application of the International \r\nConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial \r\nDiscrimination (Georgia v. Russian Federation); two \r\njudgments denying requests for intervention in the case \r\nconcerning Territorial and Maritime Dispute \r\n(Nicaragua v. Colombia), respectively filed by Costa \r\nRica and Honduras; as well as an order granting an \r\napplication for permission to intervene in the case \r\nconcerning Jurisdictional Immunities of the State \r\n(Germany v. Italy), filed by Greece; and an order on \r\nprovisional measures in the case concerning Request \r\nfor Interpretation of the Judgment of 15 June 1962 in \r\nthe Case concerning the Temple of Preah Vihear \r\n(Cambodia v. Thailand) (Cambodia v. Thailand). \r\nThese cases have involved States from all regions of \r\nthe world, and have raised a broad range of legal \r\nquestions. \r\n Let me recapitulate them one by one in strict \r\nchronological order. First, on 30 November 2010, the \r\nCourt rendered its judgment on the merits in the case \r\nconcerning Ahmadou Sadio Diallo (Republic of Guinea \r\nv. Democratic Republic of the Congo). As will no \r\ndoubt be recalled, this case concerned alleged \r\nviolations of the rights of Mr. Diallo, a Guinean citizen \r\nwho settled in the Democratic Republic of the Congo \r\nin 1964 and founded two companies: Africom-Zaire \r\nand Africontainers-Zaire. At the end of the 1980s, \r\nAfricom-Zaire and Africontainers-Zaire, acting through \r\ntheir gérant, Mr. Diallo, instituted proceedings against \r\ntheir business partners in an attempt to recover various \r\ndebts. The disputes over the debts continued \r\nthroughout the 1990s and remained largely unresolved. \r\nOn 25 January 1988, Mr. Diallo was arrested and \r\nimprisoned and released a year later. On 5 November \r\n1995, Mr. Diallo was again arrested and placed in \r\ndetention with a view to his expulsion, which was \r\ncarried out on 31 January 1996. \r\n A/66/PV.43\r\n \r\n3 11-56448 \r\n \r\n In its prior judgment of 24 May 2007 on \r\npreliminary objections, the Court had held the \r\napplication of the Republic of Guinea to be admissible \r\ninsofar as it concerned the protection of Mr. Diallo’s \r\nrights as an individual and the protection of \r\nMr. Diallo’s direct rights as associé in Africom-Zaire \r\nand Africontainers-Zaire, but declared it inadmissible \r\ninsofar as the application concerned the protection of \r\nMr. Diallo in respect of alleged violations of rights of \r\nAfricom-Zaire and Africontainers-Zaire.  \r\n In its final judgment of 30 November 2010, \r\nwhich is the subject matter of the report today, the first \r\nquestion was that of the protection of Mr. Diallo’s \r\nrights as an individual. As a preliminary matter, the \r\nCourt found that the claim relating to Mr. Diallo’s \r\narrest and detention in 1988 to 1989 should be \r\nexcluded from its consideration, as it had not been \r\nraised by Guinea until its reply and was neither \r\nimplicit in the original application nor arose directly \r\nout of a question in that application, which concerned \r\nevents in 1995 to 1996. \r\n On that basis, the Court considered Guinea’s \r\nclaim that the circumstances in which Mr. Diallo was \r\narrested, detained and expelled during the period 1995 \r\nto 1996 constituted a breach by the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo of its international obligations. \r\nGuinea argued that Mr. Diallo’s expulsion from the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo breached article 13 \r\nof the International Covenant on Civil and Political \r\nRights and article 12, paragraph 4, of the African \r\nCharter on Human and Peoples’ Rights.  \r\n On this point, the Court observed that, in order to \r\ncomply with those provisions, the expulsion of an alien \r\nlawfully in the territory of a State which is a party to \r\nthose instruments must be decided in accordance with \r\napplicable domestic law and must not be arbitrary in \r\nnature. The Court held that the expulsion decree of \r\n31 October 1995 did not comply with Congolese law \r\nand that the expulsion was therefore in violation of \r\narticle 13 of the International Covenant on Civil and \r\nPolitical Rights and article 12, paragraph 4, of the \r\nAfrican Charter. The Court also found that Mr. Diallo’s \r\nright, afforded by article 13 of the Covenant, to have \r\nhis case reviewed by a competent authority had not \r\nbeen respected, and that the Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo had not demonstrated compelling reasons of \r\nnational security to justify the denial of that right. \r\n Furthermore, the Court held that Mr. Diallo’s \r\narrests and detention also violated article 9 of the \r\nCovenant and article 6 of the African Charter, \r\nconcerning liberty and security of the person. It found \r\nthat the deprivations of liberty suffered by Mr. Diallo \r\ndid not take place in accordance with the law of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, that they were \r\narbitrary, and that Mr. Diallo had not been informed, at \r\nthe time of his arrests, of the reasons for those arrests \r\nor the charges against him. In addition, the Court found \r\nthat the Democratic Republic of the Congo had also \r\nviolated article 36, paragraph 1 (b) of the Vienna \r\nConvention on Consular Relations by not informing \r\nMr. Diallo, at the time of his arrests, of his right to \r\nrequest consular assistance from his country.  \r\n On the other hand, with regard to the claim of \r\nGuinea that Mr. Diallo was subjected to inhuman or \r\ndegrading treatment while in detention, the Court \r\nconcluded that Guinea had failed to establish that such \r\nhad been the case. \r\n The second question that the Court dealt with in \r\naccordance with the disposition of the earlier judgment \r\nwas the question of the protection of Mr. Diallo’s direct \r\nrights as associé in Africom-Zaire and Africontainers-\r\nZaire. On this question, the Court considered Guinea’s \r\nclaim that the Democratic Republic of the Congo had \r\ncommitted several internationally wrongful acts that \r\nengaged its responsibility towards Guinea, in particular \r\nthe claim that there had been breaches of Mr. Diallo’s \r\nright to take part and vote in general meetings, of his \r\nrights relating to the gérance of the companies, of his \r\nright to oversee and monitor that management and the \r\nright to property of Mr. Diallo over his parts \r\nsociales — that is, the shares — in the companies. The \r\nCourt found that the alleged rights of Mr. Diallo as \r\nassocié were not legally denied, even though their \r\nexercise may have been made more difficult by the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo’s expulsion of \r\nMr. Diallo. The Court did not find that any of those \r\nclaimed breaches had occurred. \r\n In the light of the circumstances of the case, in \r\nparticular the fundamental character of the human \r\nrights obligations breached, the Court upheld Guinea’s \r\nclaim for reparation in the form of compensation for \r\nthe injury suffered by Mr. Diallo. \r\n Secondly, the next decision rendered by the Court \r\nin the period under review was its order of 8 March \r\n2011 on the request for the indication of provisional \r\nA/66/PV.43  \r\n \r\n11-56448 4 \r\n \r\nmeasures, pursuant to Article 41 of the Statute of the \r\nCourt, in the case concerning Certain Activities \r\nCarried Out by Nicaragua in the Border Area (Costa \r\nRica v. Nicaragua). The case was brought by Costa \r\nRica by an application filed on 18 November 2010, in \r\nwhich it founded the jurisdiction of the Court on article \r\nXXXI of the Pact of Bogotá and on the declarations \r\nmade by the two States pursuant to Article 36, \r\nparagraph 2, of the Statute. The application was filed in \r\nregard to an alleged “incursion into, occupation of and \r\nuse by Nicaragua’s Army of Costa Rican territory as \r\nwell as breaches of Nicaragua’s obligations towards \r\nCosta Rica”. Costa Rica claimed that Nicaragua had \r\noccupied the territory of Costa Rica on two separate \r\noccasions in connection with the construction of a \r\ncanal, as well as certain related works of dredging on \r\nthe San Juan River. \r\n Pending the determination of the case on the \r\nmerits, Costa Rica requested the Court to order, as \r\nprovisional measures, that Nicaragua not station troops \r\nor other personnel, engage in the construction or \r\nenlargement of a canal, fell trees, remove vegetation or \r\ndump sediment in the area concerned; that Nicaragua \r\nsuspend its dredging programme; and that Nicaragua \r\nrefrain from any other action that might prejudice the \r\nrights of Costa Rica. \r\n In its order on provisional measures of protection, \r\nthe Court determined that the instruments invoked by \r\nCosta Rica appeared, prima facie, to afford a basis on \r\nwhich the Court had jurisdiction to rule on the merits, \r\nenabling it to indicate provisional measures if it \r\nconsidered that the circumstances so required. The \r\nCourt also found that the rights to be protected by \r\nthose requested measures — in particular the right to \r\nassert sovereignty over a contested area along the \r\nboundary — were plausible and that a link existed \r\nbetween the rights the protection of which was being \r\nsought and the provisional measures requested. \r\n On the basis of that finding that it had the power \r\nto indicate provisional measures, the Court proceeded \r\nto examine whether there was a real and imminent risk \r\nthat irreparable prejudice might be caused to the rights \r\nin dispute before the Court had given its final decision, \r\nand found that, given that Nicaragua intended to carry \r\nout certain activities, if only occasionally, in the \r\ncontested area, a real risk of irreparable prejudice to \r\nCosta Rica’s claimed title to sovereignty over the said \r\nterritory did exist. It further found that the situation \r\ngave rise to a real and present risk of incidents liable to \r\ncause irremediable harm in the form of bodily injury or \r\ndeath. \r\n On the basis of those findings, the Court decided \r\nto indicate provisional measures to both of the parties, \r\nordering that each party refrain from sending to or \r\nmaintaining in the disputed territory any personnel, \r\nwhether civilian, police or security, until such time as \r\nthe dispute on the merits had been decided or the \r\nparties had come to an agreement on the subject.  \r\n In addition, the Court held that Costa Rica may \r\ndispatch civilian personnel charged with the protection \r\nof the environment of the disputed territory, insofar as \r\nit is necessary to avoid irreparable prejudice being \r\ncaused to the part of the wetland where that territory is \r\nsituated, on the condition that Costa Rica consult with \r\nthe secretariat of the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands \r\nin regard to those actions, and give Nicaragua prior \r\nnotice of them. The Court also ordered that each party \r\nrefrain from any action that might aggravate or extend \r\nthe dispute before the Court or make it more difficult \r\nto resolve, and that each party inform the Court as to \r\nits compliance with the provisional measures. \r\n Thirdly, the third decision of the Court related to \r\nits judgment of 1 April 2011 on preliminary objections \r\nin the case concerning Application of the International \r\nConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial \r\nDiscrimination (Georgia v. Russian Federation). As \r\nmembers no doubt recall, proceedings in that case were \r\ninstituted on 12 August 2008, when Georgia brought a \r\ncase against the Russian Federation, alleging a \r\nviolation by the latter of the 1965 International \r\nConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial \r\nDiscrimination (CERD). Georgia founded the \r\njurisdiction of the Court on article 22 of that \r\nConvention.  \r\n The Court gave its judgment in 2008 on the \r\napplication in respect to provisional measures of \r\nprotection, finding that it had prima facie jurisdiction. \r\nIn the next phase of the case, which is the present \r\nphase, the Russian Federation raised four preliminary \r\nobjections to the Court’s jurisdiction under article 22 \r\nof CERD. Its objections were, first, that no dispute \r\nbetween the parties existed concerning the \r\ninterpretation or application of CERD; secondly, that \r\nthe procedural requirements of article 22 of CERD had \r\nnot been fulfilled; thirdly, that the alleged wrongful \r\nconduct had taken place outside the territory of the \r\nRussian Federation, and thus the Court lacked \r\n A/66/PV.43\r\n \r\n5 11-56448 \r\n \r\njurisdiction ratione loci; and fourthly, that any \r\njurisdiction that the Court might have was limited \r\nratione temporis to events that had occurred after the \r\nentry into force of CERD between the parties on 2 July \r\n1999. \r\n The Court examined the Russian Federation’s \r\nfirst preliminary objection in relation to events during \r\nthree distinct time periods. With respect to the first \r\nperiod, which was the period before CERD had entered \r\ninto force between the parties on 2 July 1999, the Court \r\nconcluded that there was no evidence of the existence \r\nof a dispute about racial discrimination during that \r\nperiod and that even if a dispute had been found to \r\nhave existed, it could not have been a dispute between \r\nthe parties with respect to the interpretation or \r\napplication of CERD.  \r\n With regard to the second period, from the time \r\nwhen CERD entered into force between the parties and \r\nbefore the beginning of armed conflict between the \r\nparties in early August 2008, the Court reviewed the \r\ndocuments and statements during that period and \r\nconcluded that none of the documents or statements \r\nfrom that period provided any basis for a finding that \r\nthere was a dispute between Georgia and the Russian \r\nFederation with respect to the interpretation and \r\napplication of CERD during that time frame. \r\n With respect to the events that occurred during \r\nthe third period, August 2008 — in particular after the \r\narmed hostilities in South Ossetia that began during the \r\nnight of 7 and 8 August — the Court found that, while \r\nGeorgia’s claims were primarily focused on allegations \r\nof unlawful use of force, they also expressly referred to \r\nethnic cleansing by Russian forces. All of those claims \r\nhad been made against the Russian Federation directly \r\nand had been rejected by the latter. The Court therefore \r\nconcluded that, by 12 August 2008, there was a dispute \r\nbetween Georgia and the Russian Federation about the \r\nlatter’s compliance with its obligations under CERD. \r\nThe Court accordingly dismissed the Russian \r\nFederation’s first preliminary objection. \r\n The Court then examined the Russian \r\nFederation’s second preliminary objection, concerning \r\nthe procedural requirements under article 22 of CERD, \r\nwhich provides that \r\n “[a]ny dispute ... which is not settled by \r\nnegotiation or by the procedures expressly \r\nprovided for in this Convention, shall ... be \r\nreferred to the International Court of Justice for \r\ndecision”.  \r\nThe Court found, based on an analysis of the ordinary \r\nmeaning of the phrase used, that article 22 did establish \r\ncertain preconditions to be fulfilled before the \r\napplicant could seize the Court on the basis of article \r\n22. \r\n On that basis, the Court examined whether such \r\npreconditions had been met. In the instant case, with \r\nregard to the requirement to follow “the procedures \r\nexpressly provided for” in CERD, the Court noted that \r\nboth sides agreed that, prior to the seizing of the Court, \r\nGeorgia did not claim that it had used or attempted to \r\nuse that mode of dispute resolution. The Court \r\ntherefore focused on the question of whether \r\nnegotiation was a required precondition and, if so, \r\nwhether that condition had been fulfilled. It observed, \r\nin the light of its finding on the first preliminary \r\nobjection, that the dispute had arisen only as of \r\n9 August 2008, and that the issue could be examined in \r\nrelation to the period between that date and 12 August \r\n2008, when the application was filed.  \r\n After reviewing the facts in the record relating to \r\nthat period, the Court found that, although certain \r\nclaims and counterclaims had been made by the parties \r\nduring that period concerning ethnic cleansing, which \r\nmight evidence the existence of a dispute as to the \r\ninterpretation and application of CERD, they did not \r\namount to attempts at negotiations by either party. The \r\nCourt therefore concluded that Georgia had not \r\nestablished that, in the relevant period, it had attempted \r\nto negotiate CERD-related matters with the Russian \r\nFederation, and that Georgia and the Russian \r\nFederation had engaged in negotiations with respect to \r\nthe latter’s compliance with its substantive obligations \r\nunder CERD. \r\n Having determined that the requirement \r\nestablished in article 22 had not been satisfied, the \r\nCourt concluded that it did not need to determine \r\nwhether the two conditions set out in article 22 were \r\ncumulative or alternative. The Court accordingly held \r\nthat article 22 of CERD could not serve to found the \r\nCourt’s jurisdiction, and upheld the Russian \r\nFederation’s second preliminary objection. It therefore \r\nconcluded that the case could not proceed to the merits \r\nphase, noting that it did not need to consider the \r\nRussian Federation’s third or fourth preliminary \r\nobjections. \r\nA/66/PV.43  \r\n \r\n11-56448 6 \r\n \r\n Let me now turn to the two judgments of 4 May \r\n2011 relating to the requests to intervene in the case \r\nconcerning the Territorial and Maritime Dispute \r\n(Nicaragua v. Colombia), filed by Costa Rica and \r\nHonduras, respectively.  \r\n The principal case between Nicaragua and \r\nColombia concerns the disputed sovereignty over \r\nseveral maritime features in the Caribbean Sea, as well \r\nas the plotting of the maritime boundary between the \r\nparties. On 25 February and 10 June 2010, \r\nrespectively, Costa Rica and Honduras filed requests \r\nfor permission to intervene in the case. \r\n In its application, Costa Rica stated that it sought \r\nto intervene as a non-party for the purpose of \r\ninforming the Court of the nature of its legal rights and \r\ninterests and of seeking to ensure that the Court’s \r\ndecision regarding the maritime boundary between \r\nNicaragua and Colombia did not affect those rights and \r\ninterests.  \r\n In its judgment of 4 May on whether to grant \r\nCosta Rica’s application to intervene, the Court first \r\ndefined the legal framework for intervention provided \r\nfor under Article 62 of its Statute and article 81 of the \r\nRules of Court. \r\n The Court examined whether Costa Rica had \r\nestablished an interest of a legal nature that may be \r\naffected by the decision in the main proceedings. The \r\nCourt accepted that although Nicaragua and Colombia \r\ndiffered in their assessments as to the limits of the area \r\nin which Costa Rica might have a legal interest, they \r\nboth recognized the existence of Costa Rica’s interest \r\nof a legal nature in at least some areas claimed by the \r\nparties to the main proceedings. \r\n However, the Court, in examining whether Costa \r\nRica had established that the interest of a legal nature \r\nthat it had set out was one which “may be affected” by \r\nthe decision of the Court in the main proceedings, \r\nconcluded that Costa Rica had not succeeded in \r\nestablishing that point. The Court stated that, in \r\naccordance with its consistent practice, when drawing a \r\nline delimiting the maritime areas between the parties \r\nto the main proceedings, that it would, whenever \r\nnecessary, end the line in question before it reached an \r\narea in which the interests of a legal nature of third \r\nStates might become involved. In that situation, the \r\nCourt held that Costa Rica’s application for permission \r\nto intervene in the case could not be granted. \r\n Honduras, in its application, made it clear that it \r\nprimarily sought to be permitted to intervene in the \r\npending case as a party. It was only if the Court did not \r\naccede to that request that Honduras requested, in the \r\nalternative, to be permitted to intervene as a non-party.  \r\n In its judgment of 4 May 2011 on whether to \r\ngrant the application of Honduras to intervene, the \r\nCourt devoted a significant part of its analysis to the \r\nquestion of intervention as a party.  \r\n The Court noted that while neither Article 62 of \r\nthe Statute nor article 81 of the Rules of Court \r\nspecified the category in which a State might seek to \r\nintervene — namely, as a party or as a non-party — it \r\nis accepted by the case law of the Court that a State \r\nmight be permitted to intervene either as a non-party or \r\nas a party. The Court pointed out, however, that \r\nwhatever the capacity in which a State is seeking to \r\nintervene, whether as a party or a non-party, it must \r\nfulfil the condition laid down by Article 62 of the \r\nStatute and demonstrate that it has an interest of a legal \r\nnature that might be affected by the future decision of \r\nthe Court.  \r\n On that basis, the Court turned to an examination \r\nof whether Honduras had satisfied that condition. The \r\narea in which Honduras had specified that it had an \r\ninterest of a legal nature that might be affected by the \r\ndecision in the main proceedings was an area that had \r\nbeen the subject of the Court’s judgment of 8 October \r\n2007 in the case concerning Territorial and Maritime \r\nDispute between Nicaragua and Honduras in the \r\nCaribbean Sea (Nicaragua v. Honduras). The question \r\non which the Court focused was whether that judgment \r\nof 2007, to which Honduras was a party, barred it from \r\nmaking the request to intervene in a case in which \r\nHonduras claimed to have an interest of a legal nature. \r\n The Court decided that by virtue of the principle \r\nof res judicata, as applied to the judgment of 8 October \r\n2007, Honduras could not have an interest of a legal \r\nnature in the area south of the maritime boundary line \r\nestablished by the Court in that decision. With respect \r\nto the area north of that boundary line, the Court \r\nconcluded that Honduras could have no interest of a \r\nlegal nature that might be affected by the decision in \r\nthe main proceedings for the simple reason that neither \r\nof the parties to the new proceedings, Nicaragua nor \r\nColombia, was contesting the rights of Honduras over \r\nthat area.  \r\n A/66/PV.43\r\n \r\n7 11-56448 \r\n \r\n The Court held that Honduras had no interest of a \r\nlegal nature that might be affected in any of the \r\nmaritime areas it had identified in its application. The \r\nCourt further observed that Honduras could not claim \r\nan interest of a legal nature in the effects that the \r\ndecision of the Court in the main proceedings might \r\nhave on the rights of Honduras under the 1986 \r\nMaritime Delimitation Treaty, which had been agreed \r\nbetween Honduras and Colombia, inasmuch as it was a \r\nbilateral treaty and the matter was exclusively between \r\nHonduras and Colombia and as such had no relevance \r\nto the Court’s eventual determination of the maritime \r\nboundary between Nicaragua and Colombia. For those \r\nreasons, the Court held that the Honduran application \r\nfor permission to intervene in the case, either as a party \r\nor as a non-party, could not be granted. \r\n Now I will move to the fifth case. That case, in \r\nwhich the Court handed down its decision in the form \r\nof an order on 4 July 2011, relates to a request to \r\nintervene by Greece in the case concerning \r\nJurisdictional Immunities of the State (Germany v. \r\nItaly).  \r\n The Hellenic Republic filed an application for \r\npermission to intervene in that case on 13 January \r\n2011. The main proceedings to which the application \r\nrelates concern a dispute over whether Italy has \r\nviolated the jurisdictional immunity of Germany by \r\nallowing civil claims against it in Italian courts based \r\non violations of international humanitarian law by the \r\nThird Reich during the Second World War.  \r\n The basis for Greece’s application to intervene \r\nwas that it had an interest of a legal nature to the extent \r\nthat the Court, in the decision it would be called upon \r\nto render in the case between Germany and Italy, \r\nwould rule on the question of whether a judgment \r\nhanded down by a Greek court can be enforced on \r\nItalian territory, having regard to Germany’s \r\njurisdictional immunity. Greece stated that the decision \r\nof the Court as to whether Italian and Greek judgments \r\nfor which the Italian Court had given judgment to \r\nenforce in Italy may be enforced in Italy was directly \r\nand primarily of interest to Greece and could affect its \r\ninterest of a legal nature. \r\n The Court took the position that, in a judgment \r\nthat it would render in the main proceedings between \r\nGermany and Italy, it might find it necessary to \r\nconsider also the decisions of Greek courts in the \r\ncontext of the principle of State immunity — which \r\nwas the issue in the main proceedings — for the \r\npurposes of examining the request in Germany’s \r\nsubmissions relating to the issue of whether Italy \r\ncommitted a breach of Germany’s jurisdictional \r\nimmunity by declaring Greek judgments as enforceable \r\nin Italy. Given that possibility, the Court held that this \r\nelement was sufficient to conclude that Greece had an \r\ninterest of a legal nature that may be affected by the \r\njudgment in the main proceedings. The request for \r\nintervention was therefore granted. \r\n Greece having fulfilled the criteria for \r\nintervention laid down in article 81 of the Rules of \r\nCourt, the Court granted its request to intervene as a \r\nnon-party, insofar as the intervention would be limited \r\nto decisions relating to illegal acts committed by \r\nGermany during the Second World War rendered by \r\nGreek domestic courts and declared enforceable by \r\nItalian courts. The request having been granted, the \r\nCourt gave its decision in the form of an order of a \r\nprocedural nature, specifying the forms of procedure to \r\nfollow, rather than in the form of a judgment, as it was \r\nin the two previous judgments that I discussed earlier \r\nin this report. \r\n Let me turn now to the sixth case — an order on \r\nprovisional measures handed down by the Court on \r\n18 July 2011 in the case concerning the Request for \r\nInterpretation of the Judgment of 15 June 1962 in the \r\nCase concerning the Temple of Preah Vihear \r\n(Cambodia v. Thailand) (Cambodia v. Thailand). The \r\ncase was brought before the Court by Cambodia. \r\n Cambodia filed a request for interpretation of an \r\nearlier judgment rendered by the Court on 15 June \r\n1962, under Article 60 of the Statute of the Court, on \r\n28 April 2011. Cambodia claimed that a dispute existed \r\nbetween the parties as to the meaning and scope of the \r\n1962 judgment. In the 1962 judgment, the Court had \r\nfound, inter alia, that Cambodia held sovereignty over \r\nthe Temple of Preah Vihear, situated in the boundary \r\narea between Cambodia and Thailand. \r\n On the same day that it filed its application for \r\ninterpretation of the 1962 judgment, Cambodia also \r\nsubmitted a request for the indication of provisional \r\nmeasures in order to cause the incursions onto its \r\nterritory by Thailand to cease, pending the Court’s \r\ndecision on the request for interpretation of the 1962 \r\njudgment. \r\n At this stage of the proceedings, when the Court \r\ndealt with the request for provisional measures, it first \r\nA/66/PV.43  \r\n \r\n11-56448 8 \r\n \r\naddressed the issue of whether a dispute appeared to \r\nexist as to the meaning or scope of the 1962 judgment, \r\nrelating in particular, first, to the meaning and scope of \r\nthe phrase “vicinity on Cambodian territory” as used in \r\nthe operative clause of that judgment; secondly, to the \r\nnature of the obligation imposed on Thailand by the \r\noperative clause to withdraw any military or police \r\nforces, or other guards or keepers; and thirdly, to the \r\nissue of whether the judgment did or did not recognize \r\nwith binding force the line shown on the map \r\nsubmitted by Cambodia in the original proceedings as \r\nrepresenting the frontier between the two parties. \r\n In its order of 18 July 2011, the Court held that \r\nthe rights claimed by Cambodia, insofar as they were \r\nbased on the 1962 judgment as interpreted by \r\nCambodia, were plausible and that the necessary link \r\nbetween the alleged rights and the measures requested \r\nhad been established. Examining whether there was a \r\nreal risk of irreparable prejudice that might be caused \r\nto the rights which were in dispute, the Court \r\nconcluded that because of the persistent tensions and \r\nabsence of a settlement to the conflict, there was a real \r\nand imminent risk of irreparable prejudice being \r\ncaused to the rights claimed by Cambodia, and that \r\nthere was urgency. \r\n On that basis, the Court decided to indicate \r\nprovisional measures to both parties. In the order, the \r\nCourt in particular established a provisional \r\ndemilitarized zone, the coordinates of which were set \r\nout in its order, and ordered both parties immediately \r\nto withdraw their military personnel from that zone and \r\nto refrain from any military presence within that zone \r\nand from any armed activity directed at that zone. \r\n The Court also ordered both parties, first, to \r\ncontinue the cooperation that they had entered into \r\nwith the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and, in \r\nparticular, to allow the observers appointed by the \r\norganization to have access to the provisional \r\ndemilitarized zone; secondly, to refrain from any action \r\nthat might aggravate or extend the dispute before the \r\nCourt or make it more difficult to resolve; and thirdly \r\nand finally, to inform the Court as to compliance with \r\nthe provisional measures. It also ordered Thailand not \r\nto obstruct Cambodia’s free access to the Temple of \r\nPreah Vihear or Cambodia’s provision of fresh supplies \r\nto its non-military personnel in the Temple.  \r\n Those are the cases that the Court has disposed of \r\nduring the period covered by this presentation.  \r\n However, in addition to those seven decisions \r\nhanded down during the 2010-2011 reporting period, \r\nthe Court held hearings in March 2011 in the case \r\nconcerning Application of the Interim Accord of \r\n13 September 1995 (the former Yugoslav Republic of \r\nMacedonia v. Greece). This case has completed its \r\nwritten and oral proceedings and is now under \r\ndeliberation by the Court. I should also mention that, \r\noutside of the reporting period, the Court also \r\ncompleted and held hearings in the case concerning \r\nJurisdictional Immunities of the State (Germany v. \r\nItaly; Greece intervening), which is now under \r\ndeliberation by the Court with a view to its final \r\ndecision. In addition, the Court is currently considering \r\nthe request for an advisory opinion made by the \r\nInternational Fund for Agricultural Development \r\n(IFAD) in respect of Judgment No. 2867 of the \r\nAdministrative Tribunal of the International Labour \r\nOrganization. Those three cases are now being dealt \r\nwith by the Court on a parallel basis.  \r\n As can be seen, given the remarkable increase in \r\nthe number of cases on its docket, the Court is now \r\ndealing with more than a few cases on a parallel basis, \r\nthereby making its best endeavour to eliminate a \r\nbacklog of judicial work. Our current docket stands at \r\n15 cases, most of which are still in the hands of the \r\nparties, who are presenting their written proceedings in \r\nadvance of the oral hearings.  \r\n The two most recent cases filed during the \r\nreporting period in are the case concerning Certain \r\nActivities carried out by Nicaragua in the Border Area \r\n(Costa Rica v. Nicaragua) and the case concerning the \r\nRequest for Interpretation of the Judgment of 15 June \r\n1962 in the case concerning the Temple of Preah \r\nVihear (Cambodia v. Thailand) (Cambodia v. \r\nThailand). I know that the Court is making its best \r\nefforts to respond to the high expectations of the \r\ninternational community for an expeditious handling of \r\nthe cases referred to the International Court of Justice. \r\n This marks my final address to the Assembly as \r\nPresident of the International Court of Justice. It \r\ntherefore seems an appropriate moment to reflect on \r\nthe trust that the international community of States \r\ncontinues to place in the Court to handle a wide variety \r\nof legal disputes. States from all corners of the world, \r\nfaithful to their attachment to international law, \r\ncontinue to have recourse to the Court to find judicial \r\nsettlements of their disputes. In the three years of my \r\npresidency, the docket has never contained fewer than \r\n A/66/PV.43\r\n \r\n9 11-56448 \r\n \r\n15 cases. In fact, in the past 10 years the docket has \r\naveraged at least 15 cases, and sometimes as many as \r\n28. \r\n As is apparent from the overview I have given \r\ntoday of the Court’s work in the past year, the \r\nsubstantive areas on which it is asked to rule are \r\nbroader in scope than ever before, with each case \r\npresenting distinct legal and factual elements. \r\nFurthermore, cases are frequently made up of different \r\nincidental phases, from preliminary objections to \r\nprovisional measures to requests for intervention and \r\nrequests for interpretation. As a result, the Court has \r\nbeen consistently handling cases in parallel and \r\nshortening the time between the closure of written \r\nproceedings and the opening of the oral proceedings. \r\n It is no exaggeration to say that all regions of the \r\nworld have become closely intertwined. In this twenty-\r\nfirst century international politics are undeniably \r\ninterconnected. A truly global economy has emerged, \r\nand the natural environment and global climate change \r\nhave created new challenges. In these times of \r\nunprecedented interconnections between States and \r\npeoples, it is my sincere belief that a firm reliance on \r\ninternational law must underpin any and all future \r\ndevelopments on the global stage. The International \r\nCourt of Justice, as guardian of international law, is \r\nproud to play a vital role in our increasingly \r\nglobalizing world. \r\n It is my hope that Member States will continue to \r\nrely on the International Court of Justice to assist them \r\nin the pacific settlement of their disputes and that more \r\nStates will accept the Court’s jurisdiction, whether \r\nthrough a declaration under Article 36, paragraph 2, of \r\nthe Statute, or through signatures of the many \r\nmultilateral treaties that now contain compromissory \r\nclauses that refer to the Court disputes relating to \r\ninterpretation or application of those treaties. \r\n Let me conclude by offering my profound thanks \r\nnot only for the opportunity to address the Assembly \r\ntoday, but also for the trust Members have placed in the \r\nCourt over the past three years. I wish the Assembly a \r\nmost productive sixty-sixth session. \r\n The President: I thank the President of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice.  \r\n Mr. Kessel (Canada): On behalf of Australia, \r\nNew Zealand and Canada, I would like to thank the \r\nPresident of the International Court of Justice, Judge \r\nOwada, for his excellent report on the work of the \r\nCourt over the past year, and to express our \r\nappreciation to him and to the Vice-President, Judge \r\nTomka, for their leadership of the Court. Judge \r\nOwada’s report highlights the invaluable role that the \r\nCourt plays in the peaceful resolution of disputes \r\nbetween States. Canada, Australia and New Zealand \r\nhave always been, and will continue to be, strong \r\nsupporters of the International Court of Justice as the \r\nprincipal judicial organ of the United Nations. \r\n The past year was a busy one for the Court. As its \r\nannual report (A/66/4) indicates, 14 contentious cases \r\nand one advisory proceeding were on the Court’s List \r\nduring the past year. The Court deliberated four cases \r\nconsecutively, and two new cases were initiated before \r\nit.  \r\n The cases before the Court cover an impressively \r\nwide range of issues, from environmental concerns to \r\njurisdictional immunities of the State to violations of \r\nhuman rights, and a wide range of the countries around \r\nthe world. \r\n Despite the increasing complexity of the cases \r\nbefore it, the Court has managed to clear its backlog of \r\ncases. Canada, Australia and New Zealand are \r\nencouraged by the Court’s continued commitment to \r\nensuring the efficiency of its working methods.  \r\n The regional and subject-matter diversity of the \r\ncontentious cases before the Court illustrates both the \r\nCourt’s universality and the ever-growing confidence \r\nof the international community in its decisions. \r\n As noted in the report, the Court, as a court of \r\njustice and the principal judicial organ of the United \r\nNations, occupies a special position in promoting the \r\nrule of law through its judgments and advisory \r\nopinions. Canada, Australia and New Zealand look \r\nforward to the International Court of Justice continuing \r\nto play its vital role in the peaceful settlement of \r\ninternational disputes and the promotion of the rule of \r\nlaw, as mandated by the Charter of the United Nations. \r\n Wider acceptance of its compulsory jurisdiction \r\nenables the Court to fulfil its role more effectively. \r\nAccordingly, we continue to urge Member States that \r\nhave not done so to deposit with the Secretary-General \r\na declaration of acceptance of the Court’s compulsory \r\njurisdiction. \r\n Mr. Ahamed (India): I would like to thank Judge \r\nHisashi Owada, President of the International Court of \r\nA/66/PV.43  \r\n \r\n11-56448 10 \r\n \r\nJustice, for his comprehensive and detailed report \r\ncovering the judicial activities of the Court over the \r\npast year. I also thank him and Vice-President \r\nJudge Tomka for their leadership of the Court over that \r\nperiod. \r\n India attaches the highest importance to the Court \r\nas the principal judicial organ of the United Nations. \r\nThe peaceful resolution of disputes is fundamental to \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security. \r\nThe Court has fulfilled that task admirably since its \r\nestablishment and has acquired a well-deserved \r\nreputation as an impartial institution with the highest \r\nlegal standards, in accordance with its mandate under \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations.  \r\n The Court remains the only judicial body with \r\nlegitimacy derived from the Charter and possessing \r\nuniversal character with general jurisdiction, while \r\nother international judicial institutions have \r\ncompetence and jurisdiction in specific areas only. The \r\nStatute of the Court is an integral part of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations, a unique status enjoyed only by the \r\nInternational Court of Justice. \r\n One of the primary goals of the United Nations, \r\nas stated in the Preamble to the Charter, is to establish \r\nconditions under which justice and respect for the \r\nobligations of international law can be maintained. The \r\nInternational Court of Justice, as the only international \r\nCourt with general jurisdiction in international law, is \r\nuniquely placed to fulfil that role.  \r\n The report of the Court (A/66/4) clearly \r\nillustrates the confidence that States have in it, as \r\nshown by the number and scope of cases entrusted to \r\nit. It also shows the Court’s growing specialization in \r\ncomplex aspects of public international law and \r\ndemonstrates the Court’s universality and the great \r\nimportance that Member States attach to it.  \r\n I am especially glad to see that the Court’s docket \r\nof pending cases has grown consistently in recent \r\nyears. It now stands at 17, involving more than \r\n30 different States, as well as one request for an \r\nadvisory opinion, as Judge Owada mentioned. The \r\nvariety in the subject matter of recent cases, from \r\nterritorial and maritime disputes to the obligation to \r\nprosecute or extradite, also demonstrates the \r\nsignificant role the Court plays in solving disputes \r\nbetween States and providing its opinion on important \r\nquestions of international law. \r\n The judgments delivered by the International \r\nCourt of Justice have played an important role in the \r\ninterpretation and clarification of rules of international \r\nlaw, as well as in the progressive development and \r\ncodification of that law. In the performance of its \r\njudicial functions, the Court has remained highly \r\nsensitive in respecting States’ political realities and \r\nsentiments, while acting within the provisions of the \r\nCharter, its own Statute and other applicable \r\ninternational law. It has contributed significantly to \r\nsettling legal disputes between sovereign States, thus \r\npromoting the rule of law in international relations. \r\n Since its inception, the Court has dealt with a \r\nvariety of complex legal issues. It has pronounced \r\njudgment in areas covering territorial and maritime \r\ndelimitation, diplomatic protection, environmental \r\nconcerns, racial discrimination, violations of human \r\nrights, and the interpretation and application of \r\ninternational treaties and conventions. The Court’s \r\nsecond function, of providing advisory opinions on \r\nlegal questions referred to it by the organs of the \r\nUnited Nations and its specialized agencies, continues \r\nto fulfil the important role of clarifying key \r\ninternational legal issues. \r\n It is commendable that the Court has taken \r\nsignificant steps in recent years to enhance its \r\nefficiency in coping with the steady increase in its \r\nworkload, including, inter alia, re-examining its \r\nprocedures and working methods, updating its Practice \r\nDirections for States appearing before it, and setting a \r\nparticularly demanding schedule of hearings and \r\ndeliberations so that it can consider several cases at the \r\nsame time. As a result, we are happy to note that the \r\nCourt has successfully cleared its backlog of cases, \r\nwith the effect of further strengthening the confidence \r\nof States in its competency and efficiency. \r\n In conclusion, I wish to reiterate the great \r\nimportance that the international community attaches \r\nto the work of the International Court of Justice and to \r\ndraw the Assembly’s attention to the importance of \r\nstrengthening its functioning, including by the \r\nprovision of additional staff as the Court has requested. \r\nIndia reaffirms its strong support for the International \r\nCourt of Justice. \r\n Mr. Abdelaziz (Egypt): At the outset, I would \r\nlike to express Egypt’s appreciation to Judge Hisashi \r\nOwada, President of the International Court of Justice, \r\nfor his comprehensive presentation of the report of the \r\n A/66/PV.43\r\n \r\n11 11-56448 \r\n \r\nCourt on its activities over the past year (A/66/4). I \r\nalso wish to reaffirm Egypt’s full support for the \r\nCourt’s key role in ensuring the implementation of the \r\nprovisions of international law, adjudicating disputes \r\nbetween States and providing advisory opinions to \r\nStates and international organizations to guide them on \r\nhow best to carry out their roles and functions. \r\n Since its establishment as the principal judicial \r\norgan of the United Nations, the Court has \r\nstrengthened important legal principles and rules \r\nthrough its advisory opinions on the Legality of the \r\nthreat or use of nuclear weapons (A/51/218, annex), on \r\nthe Legal consequences of the Construction of a Wall \r\nin the Occupied Palestinian Territory (A/ES-10/273), \r\non the Accordance with international law of the \r\nunilateral declaration of independence in respect of \r\nKosovo (see A/64/881) and many other decisions on \r\nterritorial and maritime border disputes, which have \r\nand will continue to contribute to the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes around the world, preventing \r\nthem from escalating into armed conflicts.  \r\n Egypt also recognizes the important contribution \r\nof the Court’s decisions and orders delivered during the \r\npast year, inter alia, the order delivered in March 2011 \r\non the provisional measures in the case concerning \r\nCertain Activities carried out by Nicaragua in the \r\nBorder Area (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua) and its decision \r\nin July 2011 on the provisional measures in the case \r\nconcerning Request for Interpretation of the Judgment \r\nof 15 June 1962 in the case concerning the Temple of \r\nPreah Vihear (Cambodia v. Thailand) (Cambodia v. \r\nThailand). The Court’s efforts in this field also \r\ncontribute to and supplement the theme proposed by \r\nthe President of the General Assembly for the current \r\nsession, which reaffirms the importance of the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes and the role mediation can play \r\nin that regard.  \r\n Egypt therefore emphasizes the need to \r\nencourage States and United Nations organs and \r\nspecialized agencies to request advisory opinions of the \r\nCourt on important legal questions arising within the \r\nscope of their activities, because such opinions \r\nconstitute development and codification of the rules of \r\ninternational law. They also assist in consolidating the \r\nprinciples of justice and equality at the international \r\nlevel, because of the high moral and legal values they \r\nembody, and thus promote the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security. \r\n Furthermore, Egypt expresses its appreciation for \r\nthe pioneering role played by the Court in fostering the \r\nrule of law at the international level and in promoting a \r\ndemocratic and equitable international order. We stress \r\nthe need to draw on the experiences of the Court in \r\nconsolidating established legal rules in many spheres. \r\nAmong them are the criteria and procedures for \r\naccepting new Members into the United Nations, which \r\nis relevant to the current discussions on the application \r\nby Palestine; the responsibility of States to protect their \r\ncitizens in accordance with international law; and the \r\ndistinction between legitimate armed struggle, in the \r\nframework of the right to self-determination, and \r\nterrorism. \r\n Egypt believes that it is important to provide the \r\nCourt with the chance to consider the legality of the \r\nencroachment by certain principal organs of the \r\nOrganization on the competence of other principal \r\norgans, which are more representative and democratic \r\nin nature, contrary to the delicate balance established \r\nin the Charter. In the same vein, it is necessary to \r\nmonitor and assess the implementation of the Court’s \r\njudgments, decisions and advisory opinions to enhance \r\ninternational recognition of the moral and legal values \r\nof its advisory opinions. Egypt reiterates its proposal to \r\nestablish a mechanism within the United Nations for \r\nthat purpose; first, to ensure that, as required under the \r\nCharter, States respect the advisory opinions and \r\njudgments issued by the Court at the request of one or \r\nthe other of the principal organs; secondly, to monitor \r\nthe damages caused by failure to implement opinions \r\nand judgments; and thirdly, to adopt modalities for \r\ncompensating affected States, similar to the one formed \r\nto assess the damages caused by the construction of the \r\nseparation wall in Palestine — which so far still faces \r\nmajor obstacles. \r\n In that regard, it is also important to act on the \r\ndecision of the League of Arab States in October 2011 \r\nto present to the General Assembly a draft resolution \r\nrequesting an advisory opinion of the International \r\nCourt of Justice on the legal status of the Palestinian \r\nand Arab prisoners and detainees in the prisons of \r\nIsrael, the occupying Power, under the relevant rules of \r\ninternational law, and to reassert their status as \r\nprisoners of war and their legitimate right to freedom. \r\n Egypt also welcomes the steps taken by the Court \r\nto increase its effectiveness in dealing with the steady \r\nincrease in cases before it and encourages the Court’s \r\ncontinued examination of its procedures and working \r\nA/66/PV.43  \r\n \r\n11-56448 12 \r\n \r\nmethods. Egypt supports the Court’s request for \r\nadditional posts financed by the regular budget in order \r\nto strengthen its existing security team and its \r\nDepartment of Legal Matters and Publications \r\nDivision. Egypt will work with other States in the Fifth \r\nCommittee to respond positively to those demands, \r\nespecially since they come at a time of increasing \r\ninternational efforts to utilize good governance at the \r\ninternational level as a means to fulfil the \r\ncommitments of the Court. \r\n In this regard, Egypt welcomes the reference in \r\nthe Court’s report to the ongoing work on the \r\ntechnological renovation of the Peace Palace halls and \r\nthe replacement and modernization of the audio-visual \r\nequipment in its historic courtroom and nearby rooms, \r\nso as to enable the Court to perform its tasks in a way \r\nbefitting its international standing. \r\n In conclusion, Egypt expresses its appreciation to \r\nall the judges of the Court, the Registrar and staff for \r\ntheir efforts in the year covered by the report and \r\nwishes them success in performing the lofty role of the \r\nCourt in the future. \r\n Mr. Chuquihuara (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nBefore making my statement, I wish to join in the \r\nexpressions of condolence on the great loss of \r\nMr. Antonio Cassese, a great jurist, who contributed \r\ngreatly to the body of international law. We will always \r\nregret his loss.  \r\n I would like to thank the President of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, Judge Hisashi Owada, \r\nfor being with us this morning and for his very \r\ninteresting introduction of the report on the intense \r\nwork of the Court in the past year (A/66/4).  \r\n The purpose of the United Nations is to ensure \r\nthat States resolve their disputes by peaceful means, in \r\naccordance with the principles of justice and \r\ninternational law. To that end, the United Nations \r\nCharter itself recognizes the peaceful resolution of \r\ndisputes as a general principle, whereby States should \r\nrefrain from the use or threat of use of force. \r\nUnderscoring the essential role that the United Nations \r\nCharter ascribes to the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security and to fostering relations of \r\nfriendship and cooperation, Member States declared in \r\nresolution 2625 (XXV) that they would refrain, in their \r\ninternational relations, from the threat or use of force \r\nagainst the territorial integrity or political \r\nindependence of any State, or in any other manner \r\ncontrary to the principles of the United Nations. \r\n Likewise, they believed that it is essential, to that \r\nend, for all States to resolve their international disputes \r\nthrough peaceful means, in keeping with the Charter. \r\nIn that regard, the International Court of Justice was \r\nestablished as the principle judicial organ of the United \r\nNations to institute a universal system that would \r\nenable States to resolve their disputes by peaceful \r\nmeans. Article 94 of the Charter provides for the \r\nCourt’s decisions to be complied with in such a way as \r\nto put an end to legal disputes. For that reason, Peru, as \r\na country that respects international law, reiterates its \r\ncommitment to comply with the obligations that arise \r\nfrom the statutes of the Court and urges all other States \r\nto comply with the decisions of the Court.  \r\n Despite the sensitivity of the topics taken up by \r\nthe Court — including issues of territorial and \r\nmaritime boundaries, environmental issues, the \r\ninterpretation of treaties and the immunities regime, \r\njust to mention a few — States have opted freely, in \r\nexercise of their sovereignty, to go before the Court so \r\nthat it would be the Court that would resolve their \r\ndisputes. That is the result of the judicial quality of its \r\nrulings, as well as of the independence and impartiality \r\nof its judges, which has led to universal recognition of \r\nthe Court’s high degree of legitimacy. \r\n Peru’s commitment to the work of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice is reflected in the \r\nAmerican Treaty on Pacific Settlement of 1948, also \r\nknown as the Bogotá Pact, by which the States parties \r\nagreed always to refer procedures to the Court for \r\npeaceful resolution. Likewise, in keeping with Article \r\n36, paragraph 2, of the Statute of the Court, Peru gave \r\nunconditional recognition to its jurisdiction in \r\ncontentious matters.  \r\n Moreover, through the Manila Declaration on the \r\nPeaceful Resolution of International Disputes, which \r\nwas adopted by consensus through resolution 37/10 in \r\n1982, it was reiterated that legal disputes should, \r\ngenerally speaking, be brought by parties to the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, and that bringing a case \r\nbefore the Court should not be viewed as an unfriendly \r\nact between States. \r\n As a result of that recognition, Peru believes that \r\nit is of the greatest importance for the Court’s \r\njurisdiction be universally accepted by all States. As \r\nindicated in its report, currently only 66 States have \r\n A/66/PV.43\r\n \r\n13 11-56448 \r\n \r\nissued statements indicating that they recognize the \r\ncompulsory jurisdiction of the Court, although in many \r\ncases those statements were made with reservations. \r\nPeru therefore urgently calls on all States that have not \r\nyet done so to accept the compulsory jurisdiction of the \r\nCourt in contentious matters.  \r\n We reaffirm our full endorsement and support of \r\nthe work of the Court in both its judicial and its \r\nadvisory capacities. At the same time, we wish to stress \r\nthe prominent work of its judges, with respect both to \r\nthe high level of their legal skills and to their efficient \r\nmanagement, which have made it possible for the \r\nCourt to adopt measures aimed at making its work \r\nmore effective.  \r\n We would also like to recognize that the support \r\nof the Secretariat has been critical in meeting those \r\nobjectives. The Court has had an agenda packed with \r\nlitigation over the past several years, with the \r\npresentation of two new cases. Those new tasks must \r\nbe added to the pending cases and an advisory opinion \r\nprocedure, which means that in the current session a \r\ntotal of 14 cases have been heard, along with one \r\nadvisory procedure. \r\n We should also mention the Court’s important \r\nrole in communication through its official publications \r\nand its electronic portal, all of which provide an \r\ninvaluable tool, as does the dialogue of the Court with \r\nother institutions, such as the International Law \r\nCommission, with various regional and national courts \r\nand with academic institutions, all of which enables an \r\nexchange of views that benefits and enriches the legal \r\ncommunity. \r\n All of those efforts, it is clear, contribute \r\nsubstantively to the promotion of the rule of law at the \r\ninternational and national levels. States should ensure \r\nthat the Court has sufficient resources available to \r\ncarry out the task assigned to it. In that regard, we \r\nbelieve that the requirements characterized as \r\nindispensable in the report with regard to the Court’s \r\nneeds in the area of human resources (A/66/333), such \r\nas security, legal assistance and publications, are fully \r\nreasonable and should be addressed as quickly as \r\npossible. \r\n Finally, Peru would like to publically \r\nacknowledge those who have contributed to the Trust \r\nFund to Assist States in the Settlement of Disputes \r\nthrough the International Court of Justice. We would \r\nlike to join the Secretary-General’s appeal to all States \r\nand relevant entities to collaborate with the Fund.  \r\n Ms. Flores (Honduras): We thank the president of \r\nthe International Court of Justice, Mr. Hisashi Owada, \r\nfor the presentation of the Court’s most recent report \r\n(A/66/4). We also express our gratitude to the other \r\ndistinguished members of the Court. \r\n Honduras, as a peace-loving and law-abiding \r\ncountry, has relied on the Court’s rulings on several \r\noccasions to settle mayor territorial disputes with \r\nneighbouring nations. Our Constitution clearly states \r\nthat Honduras shall adhere to the principles and \r\npractices of international law based on human \r\nsolidarity, our people’s self determination, the \r\nnon-intervention of others in our internal affairs and \r\nthe consolidation of peace and universal democracy. \r\n Historically, our two-century-old boundary \r\ndisputes and other matters pertaining to our territorial \r\nand maritime rights, which we have not been able to \r\nresolve directly with other parties by means of peaceful \r\nnegotiations, mediation or arbitration, have been \r\nsubmitted to the consideration of the International \r\nCourt. \r\n My country, which has overcome difficult periods \r\nof unrest, political and social upheaval and the \r\npolarization of conflict in the Central American region, \r\nhas always respected the Court’s decisions. Where \r\nthere has been any room for further interpretation, we \r\nhave voluntarily deferred to the better judgement and \r\nadvice of the International Court of Justice. We are \r\ntherefore thankful to the Court for the many times we \r\nhave settled our differences with other States by \r\nsubmitting to its jurisdiction. \r\n The most recent cases dealt with our sovereign \r\nrights in the Fonseca Gulf and secure passage for our \r\ncountry to the Pacific Ocean and, most recently, with \r\nmaritime delimitation in the Caribbean as pertaining to \r\nthe Caribbean Sea Maritime Limits Treaty, which we \r\nsigned with Colombia in 1999. \r\n Following our last petition to the International \r\nCourt, the Court found that the application for \r\npermission to intervene in the proceeding, either as a \r\nparty or as non-party, filed by the Republic of \r\nHonduras under Article 62 of the Statute of the Court, \r\ncould not be granted, since Honduras could not claim \r\nan interest of a legal nature that might be affected in \r\nany of the maritime areas identified in its application. \r\nA/66/PV.43  \r\n \r\n11-56448 14 \r\n \r\n Having relied on several occasions on the \r\nwisdom of the International Court of Justice for \r\nsettling serious and heartfelt disputes, we can certainly \r\nattest here today as to the Court’s contribution to \r\npeaceful coexistence and the valuable role it continues \r\nto play in regional and world peace. \r\n The willingness of Member States to join in \r\nefforts to combat impunity and strengthen universal \r\njustice is essential to the United Nations. We can fairly \r\nsay that it enables them to work for accountability. \r\nThose efforts undoubtedly help to secure the road to \r\nreconciliation and provide victims with redress. The \r\nrole the Court will play in this new century, with a \r\njurisdiction based on consent, will depend on its \r\nactivity and on its acceptance in the international \r\ncommunity as an effective tribunal that can truly serve \r\nas a world court. \r\n Despite all the achievements in our region with \r\nrespect to securing and strengthening the rule of law, \r\nwe live in an everyday reality where criminal activities \r\nand corruption threaten the core of governance and \r\nhinder, or even paralyse, States’ national justice \r\nsystems. Violence and crime are eating through the \r\nvalued weave of our societies from deep within. We \r\nhave to find a way to prevail in our common goals \r\nwhile making our systems work. We need to provide \r\nsecurity while guaranteeing rights to our citizens, and \r\nwe have to provide relief to the needy and protection to \r\nthe innocent. \r\n We therefore require a coordinated, strong \r\ninstitutional and international judicial framework. \r\nClose to home, we can praise the efforts of the \r\nInternational Commission against Impunity in \r\nGuatemala (CICIG), established under an agreement \r\nwith the United Nations, in contributing to that \r\naccountability process. So far, as we know, CICIG has \r\nassisted the Guatemalan State to investigate and \r\ndismantle violent criminal organizations believed to be \r\nresponsible for widespread crime and paralysis in that \r\ncountry’s justice system. \r\n In that same vein, I would like to stress the \r\nimportance of several issues in the Court’s report that \r\nconstitute good ideas that have been dormant in our \r\nagenda, including the right to protect or the issue of \r\nhuman security. Recently, the Assembly decided to \r\ncontinue to debate the human security issue in order to \r\naddress the lack of a definition of the concept. The \r\nconcept has serious legal implications for Member \r\nStates. It would be of paramount importance if the \r\nCourt would, for illustrative purposes, pronounced \r\nitself on the rights and responsibilities of States with \r\nrelation to human security. \r\n It is indeed difficult to see the splendors of justice \r\nshadowed by the hindrances of social inequity, \r\ndisparity and unrest. There will be no rest as long as \r\none part of the population enjoys the benefits of the \r\nsystem and the opportunity to participate, while the \r\nvast majority remains isolated, powerless and \r\nmarginalized from the blessings of development. \r\n The sense of powerlessness resulting from the \r\ninability to achieve a decent standard of living — \r\nrightly deserved by the immense, motley multitudes \r\nwho, in various latitudes of the Earth subsist in the \r\nmost precarious economic and social conditions — is \r\nundeniably a latent source of conflict. Only by \r\nrecognizing and respecting the rights of each other will \r\nthe world have a chance at peace. \r\n Mr. Ndiaye (Senegal) (spoke in French): Allow \r\nme to begin my statement by thanking Mr. Hisashi \r\nOwada, President of the International Court of Justice, \r\nfor his comprehensive and detailed report on the \r\nactivities of that organ from 1 August 2010 to 31 July \r\n2011. I also thank the staff of the Court.  \r\n My country, Senegal, takes the opportunity \r\nprovided by this annual meeting to review the report of \r\nthe International Court of Justice (A/66/4) to highlight \r\nthe Court’s productivity in moving forward the ideals \r\nof peace and justice upon which the Organization was \r\nfounded. A better time could hardly be imagined to \r\ncommend the invaluable role of the Court in \r\nestablishing a more just and peaceful world by \r\npromoting respect for the rule of law and the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes. In that connection, my \r\ndelegation would like to urge the International Court of \r\nJustice, as the only international court of universal \r\ncharacter, to continue its efforts to strengthen \r\ninternational justice, develop international law and \r\nmaintain international peace and security. \r\n The growing role of the Court for States is clearly \r\nmanifested in the increased number of applications \r\npresented to the Court. Such a demonstration of \r\nconfidence also reflects the growing acceptance of the \r\nprimacy of law as well as the interest of countries in \r\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes. By promoting the \r\nlegal settlement of disputes, the Court has contributed \r\nto peaceful relations among States, thereby greatly \r\n A/66/PV.43\r\n \r\n15 11-56448 \r\n \r\ncontributing to the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security.  \r\n Similarly, in basing its actions on the rule of law, \r\nthe International Court of Justice contributes at the \r\nsame time to the interpretation and development of \r\ninternational law in accordance with respect for the \r\nrule of law at the international level. In addition, the \r\nCourt’s orders and decisions serve as juridical \r\nprecedent in many situations, enriching the codification \r\nand consolidation of international law. \r\n For all of those reasons, my delegation reiterates \r\nits full support to the International Court of Justice and \r\nits appreciation for its praiseworthy efforts to enhance \r\nits effectiveness. We urge that the Court be provided \r\nwith the necessary means to appropriately accomplish \r\nits noble mission.  \r\n In conclusion, on the occasion of the review of \r\nthe report of the International Court of Justice, my \r\ndelegation would recall that today the positive effects \r\nof the peaceful settlement of disputes are obvious. \r\nFrom that perspective, the work of the Court clearly \r\ncontributes to achieving the purposes of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations, in particular those pertaining to the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes in conformity with the \r\nprinciples of justice and international law. \r\n Given its deep commitment to the promotion of \r\njustice and the rule of law and the peaceful settlement \r\nof disputes, Senegal reiterates its confidence in the \r\nCourt, the clearest demonstration of which was my \r\ncountry’s acceptance of the Court’s compulsory \r\njurisdiction in line with Article 36 of its Statute. \r\n Mr. Gevorgyan (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): The Russian Federation would like to \r\nexpress, through the presidency of the Assembly, its \r\ngratitude to Mr. Hisashi Owada, President of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, for his presentation of \r\nthe Court’s report (A/66/4). Given its staunch \r\ncommitment to the peaceful settlement of disputes, the \r\nRussian Federation has always attached great \r\nimportance to the Court’s activities.  \r\n We are pleased to note the dynamic work of the \r\nprimary judicial organ of the United Nations. The \r\nincreasing geographic and thematic diversity of the \r\nCourt’s cases, as it has rightly noted in its report, \r\nspeaks to the unique universal nature of that organ.  \r\n Over the past year, once again, the Court upheld \r\nthe highest standards of judicial practice, objectivity \r\nand political independence. My country is pleased with \r\nthe judgment rendered on 1 April 2011, concerning the \r\nApplication of the International Convention on the \r\nElimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination \r\n(Georgia v. Russian Federation). We believe that the \r\njudgment goes far beyond the framework of bilateral \r\ninter-State relations. Its adoption has made a notable \r\ncontribution to enhancing not only the integral system \r\nof the peaceful settlement of disputes, but also the \r\nfoundation of the peacekeeping process. In its \r\njudgment, the Court confirmed the growing \r\nsignificance of key tools of the peaceful settlement of \r\ndisputes, including negotiation. It enhanced the \r\nauthority of relevant treaty bodies and United Nations \r\nbodies and prevented an attempt to abuse established \r\nlegal procedures and circumvent the provisions of \r\ninternational treaties. \r\n Secondly, the Court supported a State that was \r\nactively participating in peacekeeping. The suit was \r\nfiled against a State that was not party to a dispute but \r\nthat was in good faith fulfilling its role as peacekeeper \r\nand mediator in the negotiations. At the same time, the \r\napplication was made to the Court after an armed \r\nattack was carried out against those very same \r\npeacekeepers and civilians in a conflict region.  \r\n If the Court had ruled otherwise, any activities of \r\npeacekeepers could risk violating the International \r\nConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial \r\nDiscrimination. In our view, thanks to the Court’s \r\nsuccess in rendering an impartial and de-politicized \r\njudgment, there has been an obvious and consistent \r\nincrease over the past years in confidence in the Court, \r\nthat has been reflected in the increasing number of \r\nStates that have accepted the Court’s jurisdiction, as \r\nwell as in the growing scope of the international legal \r\nissues that have been put before the Court. \r\n The Russian Federation would like to note \r\nanother facet of the Court’s activities. Within the \r\nUnited Nations, active discussions are under way on \r\nthe issue of the rule of law. We have seen the process \r\nof transforming the rule of law into a practical tool for \r\nreconstruction and at times, even survival, in conflict \r\nand post-conflict societies. We feel that the Court is \r\nitself a key mechanism for ensuring the rule of law \r\ninternationally. As duly noted by the Court in its report, \r\nits activities are aimed at bolstering the rule of law. It \r\ncarries out such activities through the clarification of \r\ninternational law and the just settlement of the most \r\nA/66/PV.43  \r\n \r\n11-56448 16 \r\n \r\ndelicate of international disputes, working as an \r\nindependent judiciary for other judicial bodies. \r\n We closely follow the legal activities of the Court \r\nand, at the same time, try to accord due attention to the \r\neveryday issues of the Court. Despite its busy calendar \r\nof hearings, where some cases are heard \r\nsimultaneously, the Court has nevertheless succeeded \r\nin maintaining the high judicial quality of its decisions. \r\nWe believe that the Court’s request for the provision of \r\nhuman resources and additional funding to adapt its \r\njudicial processes and to maintain its unique status \r\nmerit the closest attention. For its part, the Russian \r\nFederation stands ready to spare no efforts in that area. \r\n Elections to the Court are set for the near future. \r\nWe will select five of the 15 judges of the International \r\nCourt of Justice. We hope that from the number of \r\nhighly qualified candidates, we will choose the most \r\noutstanding individuals to carry the torch of \r\ninternational justice through the halls of the Peace \r\nPalace in The Hague.  \r\n Mr. Zellweger (Switzerland) (spoke in French): \r\nMy delegation would first like to thank the President of \r\nthe International Court of Justice for the presentation \r\nof his very comprehensive report (A/66/4).  \r\n Switzerland is firmly committed to a stable and \r\njust international order, to which international \r\njurisdictions, and the International Court of Justice in \r\nparticular, make a major contribution. Switzerland \r\nbelieves that the International Court of Justice plays an \r\nirreplaceable role. It has always recognized the \r\ncompetence of the Court, and calls on all other States \r\nto do the same. All States should bring their disputes \r\nbefore the Court in order to settle them peacefully. The \r\nincreasing number of legal matters and issues brought \r\nbefore the Court demonstrates the confidence placed in \r\nit by the international community. \r\n Moreover, my delegation welcomes the measures \r\ntaken by the Court to increase its effectiveness and to \r\ndeal with its increasing workload. It supports the Court \r\nin its undertakings to ensure its smooth functioning. \r\n The International Court of Justice devotes some \r\nparagraphs in its report to the case of Jurisdiction and \r\nEnforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial \r\nMatters (Belgium v. Switzerland). While welcoming \r\nthe swift settlement of this case, my delegation would \r\nlike to make the following clarification. In its report, \r\nthe Court quotes word for word from the letter in \r\nwhich Belgium announced its withdrawal. In the letter, \r\nBelgium refers to, and paraphrases, paragraph 85 of \r\nSwitzerland’s preliminary objections. However, it goes \r\nwithout saying that only the original text of paragraph \r\n85 of the preliminary objections conveys Switzerland’s \r\nunwavering position. \r\n I am convinced that, through its activities, the \r\nInternational Court of Justice will continue its specific \r\nefforts towards a more peaceful world. \r\n Mr. Yamazaki (Japan): It is my great pleasure \r\nand honour, on behalf of the Government of Japan, to \r\naddress the General Assembly under the presidency of \r\nHis Excellency Ambassador Al-Nasser. I would like to \r\nexpress my gratitude to President Hisashi Owada for \r\nhis in-depth report summarizing the current situation of \r\nthe International Court of Justice (A/66/4). As a State \r\nresolutely devoted to peace and firmly dedicated to the \r\npromotion of the rule of law and respect for the \r\nprinciple of the peaceful settlement of disputes, Japan \r\nappreciates the strenuous efforts and work of the Court, \r\npresided over by Judge Owada, to deliver decisions \r\nand opinions based on exhaustive deliberations. \r\n We are especially impressed by the wide regional \r\nrange of Member States seeking to resolve \r\ninternational legal disputes by referring cases to the \r\nCourt. This fact illustrates the universality of the Court \r\nand the great importance that Member States attach to \r\nit. The variety in the subject matter of recent cases, \r\nfrom territorial and maritime delimitation to the \r\ninterpretation and application of international \r\nconventions and treaties, also demonstrates the \r\nsignificant role played by the Court in solving \r\ninternational disputes between States and in providing \r\nits opinions on important questions in international \r\nlaw. While dealing with the variety and complexity of \r\nsuch cases, the Court has taken effective measures to \r\nconduct its activity at a sustainable level. The \r\nGovernment of Japan commends the Court for its \r\ncontinuous efforts to re-examine its procedures and \r\nworking methods. \r\n In the current international environment, where \r\nwe continue to witness armed conflicts and acts of \r\nterrorism, the firm establishment of law and order is \r\nindispensable. There has been increasing recognition in \r\nthe international community of the necessity of \r\nestablishing and maintaining the primacy of \r\ninternational law, as well as the importance of settling \r\ndisputes through peaceful means.  \r\n A/66/PV.43\r\n \r\n17 11-56448 \r\n \r\n In that regard, the role of the International Court \r\nof Justice as the principal judicial organ of the United \r\nNations is paramount and cannot be overstated. We \r\nbelieve that the Court must bring to bear not only a \r\nprofound knowledge of international law but also the \r\nfarsighted view of the international community, given \r\nthat the world is now experiencing rapid change. Japan \r\nrespects the Court’s ability to meet that requirement \r\nand continues to fully support its work.  \r\n Since 1958, two years after becoming a State \r\nMember of the United Nations, Japan has recognized \r\nthe compulsory jurisdiction of the Court. We urge \r\nMember States that have not yet done so to accept the \r\nCourt’s jurisdiction in order to facilitate the \r\nestablishment of the rule of law in the international \r\ncommunity. \r\n In concluding my remarks, I wish to reiterate the \r\ngreat importance that the international community \r\nattaches to the lofty cause and work of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice and to draw the \r\nAssembly’s attention to the importance of \r\nstrengthening the functioning of the Court. Japan, for \r\nits part, will continue to contribute to the invaluable \r\nwork and the efficient and effective operation of the \r\nCourt. \r\n Mr. Yee (Singapore): My delegation thanks \r\nPresident Owada for his presentation of the \r\ncomprehensive report of the International Court of \r\nJustice covering its activities over the past year \r\n(A/66/4). We also thank President Owada and Vice-\r\nPresident Tomka for their able leadership of the Court \r\nin that period. It is a testament to their vigorous efforts \r\nthat the Court has been able to discharge its duties to \r\nthe highest standards for another full year. \r\n Singapore is firmly committed to a stable and \r\npeaceful international order governed by the rule of \r\nlaw. In our view, the international rule of law is \r\nindispensable to realizing the purposes and principles \r\nof the United Nations, including the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security, and the preservation \r\nof friendly relations. In the exercise of its contentious \r\njurisdiction, the Court fulfils a key function in \r\nfacilitating the Charter obligation to settle disputes \r\npeacefully. In the exercise of its advisory jurisdiction, \r\nthe Court provides guidance on important issues of \r\ninternational law. \r\n Furthermore, my delegation welcomes the \r\ncontinued regional and subject-matter diversity of the \r\ncases standing on the Court’s List as of the end of the \r\nreporting period. We also note that the legal issues on \r\nthe Court’s List are not only diverse but complex. \r\nThose factors will ensure that the Court’s jurisprudence \r\nwill continue to command immense influence and have \r\na deep impact on the development of international law. \r\nIn that regard, there have been several jurisprudential \r\ndevelopments during the period under review that my \r\ndelegation has followed with great interest, including \r\nthose relating to jurisdictional immunities of the State \r\nand the rights of shareholders. We note that two new \r\ncases were referred to the Court during the reporting \r\nperiod, and look forward to receiving the Court’s views \r\non those cases and others pending on its List. \r\n Turning next to the administration of the Court, \r\nmy delegation commends the Court for successfully \r\nclearing its backlog of cases. We welcome the Court’s \r\nefforts to keep its procedures and working methods \r\nunder continual review, so as to ensure that its users \r\ncan be confident that proceedings before the Court will \r\nbe as efficient as possible. We are also encouraged to \r\nread that work continues on the modernization of the \r\nGreat Hall of Justice, including the introduction of \r\ninformation technology resources on the judges’ bench. \r\nWe look forward to their speedy completion. \r\n Singapore notes the request made by the Court \r\nfor additional security posts in paragraph 27 of its \r\nreport. My delegation continues to hold the view that \r\nthis request is not made lightly. Given the central role \r\nthat the Court plays, and the range of issues which it \r\nhas to deal with, including those of a highly \r\ncontroversial nature, it is only right and prudent that \r\nwe renew our support for this request. Singapore also \r\nnotes the requests for an additional P-2 post in \r\nparagraph 28, and for an additional post in the General \r\nService category in paragraph 29. My delegation \r\nbelieves that it is important for the Court to be \r\nadequately resourced in order to perform its work. As \r\nsuch, Singapore supports both these requests. \r\n In conclusion, Singapore reaffirms its strong \r\nsupport for the work of the Court, which plays a vital \r\nrole in the institutional dimension of the international \r\nrule of law. We wish the Court every measure of \r\nsuccess in meeting its future challenges and in the \r\ndischarge of its duties in the year ahead. \r\n Mr. Benmehidi (Algeria) (spoke in French): I \r\nwould like to thank the President of the International \r\nCourt of Justice, Judge Hisashi Owada, for his detailed \r\nA/66/PV.43  \r\n \r\n11-56448 18 \r\n \r\nand exhaustive presentation on the undertakings of the \r\nCourt from 1 August 2010 to 31 July 2011. I should \r\nalso like to express the appreciation of my delegation \r\nfor his presidency of that important organ of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. \r\n Algeria underscores the particular role of the \r\njudicial settlement of disputes as one of the pillars of \r\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes in the maintenance \r\nof peace and international security.  \r\n As one of the principal organs of the Charter, \r\nwhose Statute makes it an integral part of the \r\nOrganization, the International Court of Justice \r\noccupies a unique place within the international legal \r\nsystem. The multiplication of international \r\njurisdictions, in particular those that have become \r\nspecialized over the past several decades, has in no \r\nway detracted from the prestige of the Court.  \r\n The number of cases on the Court’s docket, \r\nincluding two new ones added during the most recent \r\nsession, the diversity of the issues subjected to \r\nlitigation, which touch on many areas of international \r\nlaw, as well as the fact that parties to disputes brought \r\nbefore the Court belong to every geographic region of \r\nthe world, bear witness to the universal nature of this \r\ninstitution.  \r\n Algeria would like to emphasize the eminent role \r\nthat the Court plays in the implementation and \r\nstrengthening of the rule of law at the international \r\nlevel, in particular with respect to its sustained efforts \r\non behalf of the application, promotion and elucidation \r\nof international law, as well as in the dissemination of \r\nthe Court’s activities through relevant programmes. \r\n In that spirit, the Court deserves a pre-eminent \r\nplace in all high-level debates devoted to the rule of \r\nlaw that will be held during the opening of the sixty-\r\nseventh session of the General Assembly in September \r\n2012. \r\n The execution of the Court’s determinations in \r\nestablishing the primacy of international law and \r\nimplementing the rule of law at the international level \r\nis of critical importance. Initiatives and ideas intended \r\nto contribute to improved implementation of the \r\nCourt’s rulings deserves to be encouraged. \r\n It is vital for the International Court of Justice to \r\nreceive the resources it needs to function effectively, to \r\nrender its decisions with due speed and to rule between \r\nthe plaintiffs who come before it. The complexity and \r\nmultiplicity of the cases the Court hears, as well as the \r\ndiversity of their procedural phases, in particular with \r\nregard to certain cases that become increasingly \r\nprotracted, implies a requisite adjustment with respect \r\nto both human and material resources. The 14 matters \r\ncurrently pending before the Court, several of which \r\nhave been on the docket for a number of years, might \r\nfind swifter resolution if the additional resources \r\nrequested by the Court were made available. \r\n My delegation wishes to acknowledge the efforts \r\nof the Court to adapt and streamline its workload, \r\nwhich continues to grow in volume year by year, by \r\nreworking its calendar, its procedures and its work \r\nmethods.  \r\n It remains for the United Nations, and for its \r\nMember States in particular, to explore the best ways \r\nto continue to provide the requisite support to the \r\nCourt. \r\n In conclusion, my delegation would like to stress \r\nits firm support for role of the International Court of \r\nJustice in the development of international law. In \r\naddition to ruling on disputes, the Court interprets and \r\nelucidates the rules of international law, especially \r\nthrough its important practice of providing advisory \r\nopinions, whose positive influence we would do well \r\nto emphasize. Although they do not entail obligatory \r\nconsequences for States, advisory opinions nonetheless \r\noffer clarifying guidance, in particular for international \r\norganizations, chief among them the United Nations. \r\n Mr. Osorio (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): I \r\nwould like to begin by thanking Judge Hisashi Owada, \r\nPresident of the International Court of Justice, for his \r\nvery complete and detailed report on the activities of \r\nthe Court during the period 2010-2011 (A/66/4). As \r\nthis is the last time that Judge Owada will address the \r\nAssembly in his capacity as President of the highest \r\nworld court, I should like to pay tribute to him for his \r\nstewardship of that organ over the past three years.  \r\n For those delegations that participate in the work \r\nof the General Assembly, it is very useful to be made \r\nfamiliar with the development of contentious cases and \r\nadvisory cases before the Court and the manner in \r\nwhich the principal judicial organ of the Organization \r\nis performing the task assigned to it by the Charter.  \r\n We note that during the year covered by the \r\nreport there was a constant flow of cases submitted to \r\nthe Court, with three cases declared concluded and two \r\n A/66/PV.43\r\n \r\n19 11-56448 \r\n \r\nnew contentious cases put before the Court. Over the \r\ndecades, States from different regions of the world \r\nhave gone before the Court to request its ruling on \r\nvarious controversies, in accordance with international \r\nlaw, covering a wide range of aspects of international \r\nlife. \r\n It is also important to take into account that in the \r\nvarious cases brought before the Court a wide range of \r\nother issues also arose, all of which required intense \r\nlabour on the part of the members of the Court and its \r\nsecretariat. In clear contrast with that, we note that the \r\nCourt continues to receive very few requests for \r\nadvisory opinions.  \r\n We are pleased to note that the Court has worked \r\nwith exceptional diligence in order to tackle the \r\nconsiderable challenges presented by the many cases \r\non its docket and ensure adequate and sufficient \r\nconsideration thereof.  \r\n The Court has adapted its practice and procedures \r\nthrough the adoption and subsequent adjustment of the \r\nPractice Directions, which have been very useful to \r\nlitigating States. Likewise, the Court has implemented \r\nan intense agenda of hearings and deliberations, which \r\nnow makes it possible to consider various cases with \r\nthe requisite swiftness, including the various incidental \r\nproceedings that arise. The success in the Court’s \r\nputting measures into place is tangible and reflected in \r\nthe fact that it has been able to keep delays brought \r\nabout by the very busy docket to a minimum. States \r\nconsidering the possibility of going before the Court \r\ncan now be certain that the transition from the written \r\nphase to the oral phase in each proceeding will take \r\nplace in an expedited manner.  \r\n The delegation of Colombia would also like to \r\nhighlight the very worthwhile contribution that the \r\nInternational Court of Justice can make with regard to \r\naddressing another issue on the General Assembly’s \r\nprogramme of work, namely, the state of the rule of \r\nlaw in the international arena. As correctly reflected in \r\nthe report, in this context the Court plays a special role \r\nwithin the United Nations institutional architecture \r\nsince, by definition, as it is a judicial organ, everything \r\nit does is geared towards promoting the rule of law. It \r\ncan therefore be said that all its actions and decisions \r\ncould potentially contribute to the promotion and \r\nclarification of norms in international law that it is \r\ncalled upon to interpret and apply, including norms that \r\nregulate its practice and procedure.  \r\n For that reason, we would like to join those \r\ndelegations that have indicated that the President of the \r\nCourt should be invited to participate in the opening \r\nsession of the high-level event on this topic that will \r\ntake place on 24 September 2012. That important event \r\nwould thereby benefit from the perspective of one of \r\nthe principal organs of the Organization entirely \r\ndevoted, in the most efficient and laudable manner, to \r\npromoting the rule of law at the level of international \r\nrelations. \r\n Mrs. Morgan (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): The \r\ndelegation of Mexico would like to express its deep \r\nappreciation to the International Court of Justice for \r\nthe arduous efforts it has undertaken this year. We \r\nwould also like to thank its President, Judge Hisashi \r\nOwada, for his presentation of the Court’s report \r\n(A/66/4).  \r\n Mexico welcomes the periodic review of \r\nproceedings, methods of work and guidelines \r\nundertaken by the Court in recent years, which has \r\nfacilitated expedited attention to cases and has been \r\nkey in ensuring that this legal organ can sustain its \r\npace of activity.  \r\n Moreover, Mexico wishes to thank the General \r\nAssembly for its willingness to increase the number of \r\nthe Court’s legal assistants and security staff, as well as \r\nfor its willingness to create a new General Service post \r\nfor telecommunications technician. Along the same \r\nlines, Mexico calls for the General Assembly to \r\ncontinue to provide the Court with tools to ensure its \r\noptimal performance as the principal judicial organ of \r\nthe Organization.  \r\n The report currently before us illustrates with \r\nclarity and conciseness the contentious cases before the \r\nCourt and is evidence of its universal nature. In this \r\nregard, my delegation wishes to indicate that, of the \r\n17 cases before the Court under the period under \r\nreview, a number of them concerned States from Latin \r\nAmerica and the Caribbean, which clearly shows the \r\ncommitment of the region to compliance with \r\ninternational law and the peaceful resolution of \r\ndisputes.  \r\n My delegation would like to highlight the great \r\nlegal value of the Court’s rulings not only for States \r\nparties involved in a case, but also for the creation of \r\ninternational jurisprudence that is of interest for the \r\ninternational community as a whole. The Court plays a \r\nfundamental role in developing international law. The \r\nA/66/PV.43  \r\n \r\n11-56448 20 \r\n \r\nruling in the case concerning Pulp Mills on the River \r\nUruguay (Argentina v. Uruguay), is a clear example of \r\nthis fact. We also see it in the constant evolution of the \r\nthematic complexity of the cases before the Court.  \r\n I would like to conclude by reiterating Mexico’s \r\nattachment to the International Court of Justice as the \r\nmain legal organ for the peaceful solution of disputes.  \r\n Mr. Arguello-Gómez (Nicaragua) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): Nicaragua would like to express its gratitude \r\nto Judge Hisashi Owada, President of the International \r\nCourt of Justice, for his introduction of the Court’s \r\nreport (A/66/4). \r\n The fact that the 2010-2011 judicial year, like the \r\nprevious period, continues to be an extremely busy one \r\nand that, moreover, it is expected that next year will be \r\nequally intensive due to the initiation of two \r\ncontentious cases, illustrates the relevance of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice as the principal United \r\nNations judicial organ and as the only international \r\ncourt of a universal character and with general \r\njurisdiction. In this regard, we would like to highlight \r\nthat the work of the Court not only contributes to \r\npromoting, consolidating and disseminating \r\ninformation about the rule of law, but also that its work \r\nis key to international security in that it promotes the \r\npeaceful resolution of conflicts, which is one of the \r\nmain purposes of the United Nations and a constant \r\ndesire of humankind.  \r\n We regret that, once again, the report reflects the \r\nfact that only 66 States have recognized the \r\ncompulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of \r\nJustice and that some of those recognitions contain \r\nreservations that, in many cases, void the very meaning \r\nof the acceptance of such jurisdiction. We urge all \r\nStates that have not yet done so to recognize the \r\nCourt’s jurisdiction, thereby contributing to \r\nstrengthening the rule of law internationally. \r\n Nicaragua’s international relations are based on a \r\npolicy of friendship, solidarity and reciprocity between \r\npeoples, which is why we not only recognize the \r\nprinciple of the peaceful settlement of international \r\ndisputes by means of international law, but why we \r\nhave also resorted to such means many times and will \r\ncontinue to do so. In the past 26 years, Nicaragua has \r\nparticipated as a plaintiff or defendant in eight major \r\ncases and various incidental ones before the \r\nInternational Court of Justice. Those cases include that \r\nof Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against \r\nNicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), \r\nwhich ruled 25 years ago that the United States was \r\nobliged to indemnify Nicaragua for all the damage \r\ncaused by its activities violating international law. This \r\njudgment by the Court is still pending compliance, \r\nwhich is why Nicaragua still reserves the right to claim \r\nthe compensation it is due. \r\n Among the cases involving Nicaragua is the \r\ncurrently pending Territorial and Maritime Dispute \r\n(Nicaragua v. Colombia) brought by Nicaragua \r\n10 years ago, whose continuation is due in part to \r\nincidental proceedings arising from the case. Here, it \r\nshould be mentioned that in May the Court decided \r\nthat applications for permission to intervene presented \r\nby Costa Rica and Honduras could not be granted, and \r\nmost recently reaffirmed the scope of the judgment of \r\n8 October 2007 in the case of the Territorial and \r\nMaritime Dispute between Nicaragua and Honduras in \r\nthe Caribbean Sea (Nicaragua v. Honduras). \r\n Similarly, in the recent case concerning Certain \r\nActivities carried out by Nicaragua in the Border Area \r\n(Costa Rica v. Nicaragua), President Daniel Ortega \r\nwas the first to propose publicly that both countries \r\nshould refer the matter to the Court if they could not \r\nreach a bilateral agreement. In March, the Court \r\nhanded down its ruling on the provisional measures \r\nrequested by Costa Rica, deciding that both parties \r\nshould refrain from sending or maintaining personnel \r\nin the disputed territory and should find common \r\nsolutions to care for the environment, among other \r\nthings. Nicaragua is pleased to say that it has faithfully \r\nabided by all the points in the ruling and will continue \r\nto do so. \r\n Nicaragua has demonstrated its confidence in \r\ninternational justice not only by its actions; it has also \r\nturned to the Court on a number of occasions and has \r\nused its judgments to endorse and propose mechanisms \r\nfor the peaceful settlement of disputes. In that regard, \r\nallow me to recall that the initiative for declaring the \r\nUnited Nations Decade of International Law came \r\nfrom Nicaragua, which proposed it under the auspices \r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement in 1988. This initiative \r\nincluded a basic concept, that of promoting universal \r\ncompulsory mechanisms for the peaceful settlement of \r\ndisputes, particularly through the International Court of \r\nJustice. \r\n With this purpose in mind, a ministerial meeting \r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement was held at The Hague \r\n A/66/PV.43\r\n \r\n21 11-56448 \r\n \r\nin 1989, culminating in a declaration by the \r\nMovement’s more than 80 member States — which at \r\nthe time represented a significant majority of the \r\nmembership of the United Nations — approving the \r\ninitiative of presenting the proposal for the Decade of \r\nInternational Law to the General Assembly. The basic \r\nreason for this initiative was to bring back the spirit of \r\nthe first two peace conferences held in The Hague in \r\n1899 and 1907, which sought to establish a universal \r\ncompulsory mechanism for the peaceful settlement of \r\ndisputes. That mechanism, which those first \r\nconferences were unable to achieve, has now been \r\nrealized in the International Court of justice. Our task \r\nis to enable it to truly become a universal compulsory \r\nmechanism without loopholes that undermine the \r\ncompulsory nature of its jurisdiction and with genuine \r\nresources that can ensure compliance with its \r\ndecisions. \r\n Nicaragua believes that while perhaps because of \r\ninternational factors prevailing at the end of the 1980s \r\nthis could not be fully achieved, we may now take it up \r\nagain in order to advance universal acceptance of the \r\nCourt’s compulsory jurisdiction. With this in mind, \r\nNicaragua will once again retrace the steps that can \r\nenable us to revive this initiative of almost a quarter of \r\na century ago. \r\n In conclusion, my delegation would like to \r\nexpress our great satisfaction with the work of the \r\nCourt and to once again thank Mr. Owada, the \r\nPresident of the Court, for his report. \r\n Mr. Sorreta (Philippines): At the outset, allow \r\nme to express our sincere sympathies on the passing \r\naway of Judge Antonio Cassese. He was, in the truest \r\nsense, a giant of international law whose experience \r\nand expertise in the field are widely and rightly \r\nrecognized.  \r\n Our debate today comes at a most opportune time \r\nas we commemorate International Law Week here at \r\nthe United Nations. As we renew our pledge to build a \r\nmore peaceful, progressive and prosperous world, we \r\nare reminded once again of our solemn duty to further \r\nstrengthen the ramparts upon which our world is built, \r\non justice and the rule of law. That commitment finds \r\nits fullest expression in the International Court of \r\nJustice and in the Court’s faithful exercise of its \r\nmandate. As the principal judicial organ of the United \r\nNations, the Court is the primary institution tasked \r\nwith ensuring respect for the rule of law in \r\ninternational relations, as it upholds an integral legal \r\norder founded on the primacy of the rule of law and the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes. \r\n In this regard, the Philippines welcomes the \r\nreport of the International Court of Justice contained in \r\ndocument A/66/4, and the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral contained in document A/66/295. These \r\ndocuments are a comprehensive and detailed \r\ndemonstration of the Court’s important work and \r\nactivities. The Philippines wishes to thank and \r\ncommend Judge Hisashi Owada, President of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, for the preparation of the \r\nreport. \r\n The importance of the Court cannot be \r\noverstated. It is the only international court of a \r\nuniversal character with general jurisdiction. The Court \r\nhandles cases that are growing in legal and factual \r\ncomplexity. The subject matter of those cases is \r\nextremely varied, including, among other issues, \r\nterritorial and maritime delimitation, environmental \r\nconcerns, the jurisdictional immunities of States, \r\nviolations of territorial integrity, racial discrimination, \r\nviolations of human rights, and the interpretation of \r\ninternational conventions and treaties. These cases, \r\ncoming from diverse regions, illustrate the Court’s \r\nuniversality. The Philippines notes the sustained level \r\nof activity of the Court. During the period under \r\nreview two new cases were brought before the Court, \r\nbringing the number of contentious cases on its List to \r\n14 as of 31 July. The Philippines continues to follow \r\ndevelopments in these cases closely. \r\n My country commends the Court for taking steps \r\nthat have allowed it to sustain its level of activity. With \r\ncontinuous re-examination of its procedures and \r\nworking methods, regular updating of the practices it \r\nadopted in 2001 for use by States appearing before it, \r\nand the setting of an exacting schedule, the Court has \r\nbeen able to clear its backlog of cases and thus increase \r\nthe confidence placed in it by States submitting a \r\ndispute for fair and timely resolution. \r\n To continue doing so, however, the Court needs \r\nvital support, particularly in the area of human \r\nresources. The Philippines notes that the Court’s \r\nbudget submission for 2012 to 2013 includes requests \r\nfor the establishment of several posts. The Philippines \r\nreiterates its call for Member States to continue to \r\nprovide the Court with the means necessary for \r\nensuring its proper and efficient functioning. \r\nA/66/PV.43  \r\n \r\n11-56448 22 \r\n \r\n My delegation wishes to register its approval of \r\nthe work done by the International Court of Justice to \r\nmake itself and its decisions more widely accessible to \r\nthe public, to academia, to the international legal \r\ncommunity and to media professionals through \r\npublications, visits, sustained engagement with the \r\nmedia and the use of innovative information and \r\ncommunications technology. The annual publication of \r\nthe reports on judgments, advisory opinions and orders, \r\nthe yearbook and the bibliography, among others, as \r\nwell as the inclusion in the Court’s website of its entire \r\njurisprudence and that of the Permanent Court of \r\nInternational Justice, are particularly to be \r\ncommended. The Court’s website — with dynamic \r\ndevelopments in its content and user interface — will \r\ncontinue to play an important role in keeping the Court \r\nengaged and connected with the world by providing a \r\nplatform for access at various points and at different \r\nlevels throughout the world. \r\n The Philippines submits that in order to \r\nstrengthen the foundations for global respect for the \r\nrule of law and its effective implementation, \r\ntransparency and accessibility, along with integrity and \r\nindependence, must be the Court’s cornerstones. Yet, \r\ntransparency and accessibility must never compromise \r\nthe Court’s security. It is on that point that the \r\nPhilippines notes the Court’s reiteration of its request \r\nto strengthen the Court’s security team to enable it to \r\nconfront new technological threats in respect of \r\ninformation systems security. \r\n In recent years, we have witnessed a steady rise \r\nin the number of States, entities and even individuals \r\nresorting to specialized tribunals and forums in \r\nattempts to address the increasing demands of \r\ninterdependence. My delegation views that \r\ndevelopment as a reflection of increased confidence in, \r\nand recourse to, the rule of law, which the Court has \r\nhelped to propagate. \r\n In that regard, we continue to count on the \r\nCourt’s function of elucidating norms to provide a \r\nbasic framework of case law and norms, as well as to \r\nharmonize jurisprudence in general international law, \r\nin order to provide guidance for specialized tribunals. \r\n In the exercise of its mandate as the only \r\ninternational court of universal character with general \r\njurisdiction, our obligation is to continue to provide the \r\nsupport crucial for the International Court of Justice to \r\nmaintain and strengthen the rule of law, which \r\nunderpins peaceful relations between States.  \r\n Mr. Errázuriz (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): Chile \r\ntakes this opportunity to express its appreciation to the \r\nPresident of the International Court of Justice, The \r\nHonourable Judge Hisashi Owada, for presenting the \r\ncomprehensive report covering the period from \r\n1 August 2010 to 31 July 2011 (A/66/4). \r\n The great responsibilities of the International \r\nCourt of Justice and its work as the highest judicial \r\norgan of the United Nations deserve to be highlighted \r\nbefore the international community. The Court’s \r\nmission of fulfilling an advisory role and peacefully \r\nsettling disputes, as entrusted to it under the United \r\nNations Charter, is reflected in the report introduced by \r\nits President, which we are pleased to welcome. \r\n The Court is central to the international legal \r\nsystem, and States recognize its leading role of \r\nproviding guarantees to all members of the \r\ninternational community. We once again reiterate that \r\nthe advisory role of the International Court of Justice is \r\nparticularly important. Its opinions, which are founded \r\non international law, provide reasoned arguments to \r\nStates and sound support for the functions of the \r\nUnited Nations Organization. \r\n The Court makes an ongoing contribution, in the \r\nframework of the multilateral system of peace and \r\nsecurity, to strengthening relations among countries \r\nand to instilling a sense of respect for the law in the \r\ninternational legal order, by combining the \r\nfundamental principles and the mandates of the Charter \r\nof the United Nations, which is its backbone. \r\n As its President has explained, the Court has \r\nextensive and complex jurisdiction, which it exercises \r\nfor the good of the international community. It carries \r\nout its mandate in a framework of coexisting \r\ninternational, multilateral and bilateral treaties, through \r\nwhich it is entrusted with the judicial settlement of \r\ndisputes and the application of mechanisms accepted \r\nby States in their unilateral declarations. \r\n As the Court is the highest judicial organ of the \r\nsystem, we must make our voices heard and support it \r\nby ensuring that the necessary material and human \r\nresources are made available to it for the exercise of \r\nthose competencies, according to its judicial tasks and \r\nthe important functions that it must carry out. \r\n A/66/PV.43\r\n \r\n23 11-56448 \r\n \r\n We also express our appreciation for the efforts \r\nbeing made by the International Court of Justice to \r\nwidely publicize its work and make it broadly \r\naccessible to international public opinion, using \r\nmodern methods and technologies. \r\n Those efforts have strengthened international law, \r\nand the Court should therefore receive ongoing and \r\nbroad support for its activities. We note the progress \r\nmade in the use of electronic media to publicize the \r\nwork of the Court and facilitate access to its documents \r\nand to information on its work. \r\n I shall conclude by reiterating our appreciation \r\nfor the praiseworthy work of the Court and for its \r\ninvaluable contribution to the effectiveness and \r\nobservance of international law. \r\n Mr. Silva (Brazil): Before I begin, allow me to \r\nexpress my country’s condolences on the irreparable \r\nloss of Mr. Antonio Cassese. Although he is no longer \r\nwith us, Mr. Cassese’s lessons on international law will \r\ncertainly remain. \r\n I join previous speakers in extending a warm \r\nwelcome to Judge Hisashi Owada and thanking him for \r\nhis comprehensive presentation. My delegation very \r\nmuch appreciated Judge Owada’s briefing yesterday to \r\nthe Security Council (see S/PV.6637), in particular his \r\nthoughts on how the Council could make fuller use of \r\nthe International Court of Justice in the settlement of \r\ndisputes. Judge Owada spoke of the organic linkage \r\nthat exists between the Council and the Court. My \r\ncountry believes that the Council would benefit from a \r\ncloser relationship with the Court. \r\n I was also very interested in his observations on \r\nthe parallel and complementary roles of the Court and \r\nthe Security Council, as illustrated by the case between \r\nCambodia and Thailand, a matter that the Council dealt \r\nwith last February (see S/PV.6480), under the Brazilian \r\npresidency, and one in which my country was very \r\ndirectly involved. \r\n The International Court of Justice is a key \r\nelement in efforts to uphold the principles and norms \r\nof international law and to ensure the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes. In the Preamble to the Charter, \r\nMember States made a commitment to establish \r\nconditions under which justice and respect for \r\nobligations arising from treaties and other sources of \r\ninternational law could be maintained. The \r\nreinforcement of the rule of law on a global scale is a \r\nmajor contribution that the Court has given to the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. Such \r\nan accomplishment should not be taken for granted. \r\n The advisory jurisdiction of the Court has also \r\nplayed a major role in clarifying legal questions put \r\nforward by United Nations organs and other \r\nspecialized agencies. The authoritative views expressed \r\nby the Court in its advisory opinions have made an \r\nimportant contribution to international law. The \r\nGeneral Assembly should continue to rely on the Court \r\nwhenever necessary. \r\n The Court’s latest report (A/66/4) shows the \r\nheavy demands placed on it, with cases covering \r\nmyriad issues, from the jurisdictional immunity of the \r\nState to racial discrimination, and from environmental \r\nconcerns to territorial and maritime delimitation. Those \r\nissues relate to cases in all continents. It also \r\ndemonstrates the genuinely universal character of the \r\nCourt and its importance as the principle judicial organ \r\nof the United Nations. \r\n Brazil welcomes the continued efforts of the \r\nCourt to keep up with its increasing workload. As \r\nhighlighted in the report, cases are increasingly \r\ncomplex, often involving a number of phases and \r\nrequests for urgent provisional measures. We \r\nappreciate the steps taken to enhance the efficiency of \r\nthe Court. The continued re-examination of its \r\nprocedures and working methods are important \r\nmeasures in order to face a very demanding level of \r\nactivity. \r\n The international community has many good \r\nreasons to celebrate this year’s sixty-fifth anniversary \r\nof the International Court of Justice. Brazil praises the \r\nCourt for its role in the development of international \r\nlaw and in upholding the principles of the Charter. The \r\nwork of the Court is crucial to ensuring the primacy of \r\nlaw in international affairs, the peaceful settlement of \r\ndisputes and the promotion of more just, equitable and \r\nfair international relations. \r\n We are proud to have contributed to that process, \r\nalong with the Court’s history, with highly qualified \r\nBrazilian judges. I take this opportunity to pay tribute \r\nto their work for the cause of justice, a tradition \r\nhonoured currently by Judge Antonio Augusto Cançado \r\nTrindade. In a matter of days, six judges will be elected \r\nboth by the General Assembly and the Security \r\nCouncil. Brazil wishes them every success in the \r\ndischarge of their duties. \r\nA/66/PV.43  \r\n \r\n11-56448 24 \r\n \r\n I take this opportunity to express once again \r\nBrazil’s full support of the International Court of \r\nJustice and our appreciation to President Owada. \r\n Mr. Adoke (Nigeria): On behalf of the Federal \r\nRepublic of Nigeria, let me extend our sincere \r\nappreciation to Mr. Owada, President of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, for his comprehensive \r\nand incisive report on the activities of the Court \r\n(A/66/4). \r\n As a peace-loving State, Nigeria expresses its \r\nresolve and unequivocal support for the settlement of \r\ndisputes by the peaceful means of mediation, \r\npreventive diplomacy, arbitration and, in particular \r\ncases, adherence to the judgments of the Court as the \r\nprincipal judicial organ of the United Nations.  \r\n Recalling the international dimension and the \r\ndiverse legal issues upon which the Court has to \r\nadjudicate, such as contentious cases, the jurisdiction \r\nof the Court and advisory proceedings, to mention but \r\na few, serves to underline the universality of the \r\nCourt’s rulings, in line with modern trends, which my \r\ndelegation believes merits accolades and \r\ncommendation. Nigeria therefore calls on countries \r\nthat have not yet honoured the Court’s decisions to do \r\nso.  \r\n Nigeria is a role model in adhering to the ruling \r\nof the Court in the Bakassi case. It thanks the Court for \r\nits judgment, which has been implemented under the \r\nGreentree Agreement, of which I am the co-Chair \r\nunder the auspices of the United Nations.  \r\n Nigeria praises the Court and its role in the \r\ndevelopment of international law and assures it of our \r\nsupport at all times. \r\n Mr. Tsiskarashvili (Georgia): I would like to \r\ntake this opportunity to join previous speakers in \r\nreferring to the essential role of the International Court \r\nof Justice as the principal judicial organ of the United \r\nNations. \r\n In the light of that, the report before us (A/66/4) \r\nand its presentation today by President Owada once \r\nagain accentuate the fundamental place of the Court in \r\nthe system of the settlement of disputes in accordance \r\nwith international law. As indicated in the report, on \r\n1 April, the Court delivered the judgment in the case \r\nsubmitted by Georgia against the Russian Federation \r\non the Application of the International Convention on \r\nthe Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, \r\nupholding the second preliminary objection of the \r\nRussian Federation. \r\n Notwithstanding the fact that Georgia has \r\nrepeatedly attempted to resolve existing disputes under \r\nthe Convention with the Russian Federation through \r\nnegotiations, including both prior to and since the \r\ncommencement of the major hostilities in August 2008, \r\nin the light of the Court’s recent judgment, Georgia \r\nformally invited the Russian Federation to participate \r\nin further negotiations to resolve the existing disputes \r\nthat have arisen with respect to the Russian \r\nresponsibility for breaches of the Convention.  \r\n Georgia invokes the responsibility of Russia, \r\ninter alia, for the prevention of the exercise of the right \r\nof return of ethnic Georgians who were expelled from \r\nthe Tskhinvali region and Abkhazia during the early \r\n1990s and as a result of the 2008 Russia-Georgia war. \r\nWe also invoke the responsibility of Russia for \r\ndiscrimination in the period prior to the \r\ncommencement of major hostilities in August 2008 \r\nagainst ethnic Georgians living in areas of the \r\nTskhinvali region and Abkhazia controlled by Russia \r\nand the proxy regimes, including with respect to \r\nethnically motivated violence, the destruction of \r\nproperty, the violation of educational, cultural and \r\nlinguistic rights, freedom of movement and issuing of \r\npassports. \r\n While the Government of Georgia is taking all \r\nadequate measures to ensure that the breaches of the \r\nConvention by the Russian Federation are brought to \r\nan immediate end, as I end my intervention I would \r\nlike to draw the Assembly’s attention to paragraph 172 \r\nof the report and paragraph 186 of the judgment of the \r\nCourt, where the Court unequivocally indicates that the \r\nparties are under a duty to comply with their \r\nobligations under the Convention. \r\n Mr. Ulibarri (Costa Rica) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nThe delegation of Costa Rica thanks Judge Hisashi \r\nOwada, President of the International Court of Justice, \r\nfor his clear report on the work of the Court (A/66/4) \r\nand for his presence before the Assembly. His \r\nleadership is a source of motivation and strength to the \r\ncurrent and the ongoing work of the Court. We are also \r\ngrateful for the report of the Secretary-General on the \r\nTrust Fund to Assist States in the Settlement of \r\nDisputes through the International Court of Justice \r\n(A/66/295). \r\n A/66/PV.43\r\n \r\n25 11-56448 \r\n \r\n This is the right time to once again express our \r\ncountry’s complete adherence to the primacy of \r\ninternational law, our full respect for the instruments \r\nand organizations of international law, and our \r\ncommitment to faithfully comply with the decisions to \r\nwhich they give rise. \r\n Article 1, paragraph 1, of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations recognizes the peaceful resolution of \r\ninternational disputes as an essential purpose of the \r\nOrganization, in keeping with the principles of justice \r\nand international law. As the only universal \r\ninternational tribunal fully incorporated into the United \r\nNations system, the Court’s responsibilities in that area \r\nare indispensable to the international community, \r\nhence the responsibility of the Organization and its \r\nStates Member to support the Court in carrying out its \r\ntasks. Of course, that support also includes a financial \r\nand logistic dimension that should be appropriately \r\nreflected through the allocation of adequate resources \r\nto the Court so that it can efficiently and effectively \r\nand with absolute legal independence tackle the cases \r\nbrought before it.  \r\n Even more important, States must respect the \r\ndecisions of the Court without distinction, whether \r\nthey are substantive matters or provisional measures, \r\nwhich are especially important in the case of conflicts \r\nalready taking place on the ground. Such respect  \r\n \r\nshould be provided in good faith without any \r\nmanoeuvring or provocations or attempts to undermine \r\nthe Court’s decisions and based on the conviction that \r\nany damage to the Court’s integrity or its mandate or \r\nhindrance of its functions will work against the \r\ninternational community as a whole. Respecting the \r\nCourt and its decisions is the best way to guarantee the \r\nintegrity and proper functioning of each proceeding \r\nand the best way of once again consolidating the \r\nCourt’s indisputable role. \r\n In conclusion, Costa Rica notes the well \r\nestablished experience of the candidates among whom \r\nthe Court’s five new Judges will be chosen shortly. We \r\nwish those who will be elected every success. We also \r\nthank the Court for its efficient work and express our \r\nconfidence that it will continue resolutely along the \r\npath towards fully accomplishing its duties, \r\novercoming all challenges and promoting peace and \r\nrespect through the application of international law. \r\n The President: We have heard the last speaker in \r\nthe debate on agenda item 72. May I take it that it is \r\nthe wish of the General Assembly to conclude its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 72? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n  The meeting rose at 1.05 p.m. \r\n"
