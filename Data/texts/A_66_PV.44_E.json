(Qatar) \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 75 \r\n \r\nReport of the International Criminal Court \r\n \r\n  Note by the Secretary-General (A/66/309) \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/66/333) \r\n \r\n The President: It is now my great honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations Mr. Sang-Hyun Song, \r\nPresident of the International Criminal Court, and give \r\nhim the floor. \r\n Mr. Sang-Hyun Song (International Criminal \r\nCourt): I am honoured to address this forum for the \r\nthird and final time in my current mandate as President \r\nof the International Criminal Court (ICC). This has \r\nbeen a year of significant developments for the ICC. \r\nWith two new investigations and several new cases, the \r\nCourt is busier than ever. At the same time, trials have \r\nprogressed well and the first verdicts are expected very \r\nsoon. \r\n I am delighted to say that international support \r\nfor the ICC has continued to grow. Five States have \r\nnewly joined the Rome Statute, bringing the number of \r\nStates parties to 119. While the ICC is an independent \r\norganization, its relationship and cooperation with the \r\nUnited Nations have continued to be as vital as ever, \r\nand it is my great pleasure today to present the Court’s \r\nseventh annual report to the General Assembly (see \r\nA/66/309). \r\n Today I would like to brief the Assembly on the \r\nmain developments at the ICC and highlight the \r\nrelevance of the Court’s work in support of the global \r\nefforts to protect human rights and promote the rule of \r\nlaw. \r\n Let me first update the Assembly on the main \r\ndevelopments on the judicial front. The number of \r\nsituations under ICC investigation has risen from five \r\nto seven during the past year. On 26 February, the \r\nSecurity Council, in response to the conflict in the \r\nLibyan Arab Jamahiriya and what it called the gross \r\nand systematic violation of human rights, unanimously \r\nadopted resolution 1970 (2011), which, among other \r\nmeasures, referred the situation in Libya since \r\n15 February 2011 to the Prosecutor of the ICC. \r\nFollowing the Prosecutor’s investigation, the Court’s \r\nPre-Trial Chamber issued warrants of arrest against \r\nMuammar Al-Qadhafi, Saif Al-Islam Al-Qadhafi and \r\nAbdullah al-Senussi on 27 June. \r\n Since the filing of the ICC’s written report, the \r\nCourt has authorized investigations into a seventh \r\nsituation, that of Côte d’Ivoire. While not a State party \r\nto the Rome Statute, Côte d’Ivoire accepted the ICC’s \r\njurisdiction in 2003, and President Ouattara confirmed \r\nthat decision in December, pledging full cooperation \r\nwith the Court. Following a request by the Prosecutor, \r\nthe ICC’s Pre-Trial Chamber authorized, on 3 October \r\n2011, an investigation into alleged crimes committed \r\nsince 28 November 2010, in the wake of presidential \r\nelections in Côte d’Ivoire. \r\nA/66/PV.44  \r\n \r\n11-56550 2 \r\n \r\n The ICC’s first trial concluded in August with \r\nclosing statements in the case against Thomas Lubanga \r\nDyilo, who had been charged with the use of child \r\nsoldiers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. \r\nJudgement in this case is expected before the end of \r\nthe year. \r\n The presentation of evidence is nearing its \r\nconclusion in the second trial arising from the situation \r\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo concerning \r\ncharges against Germain Katanga and Mathieu \r\nNgudjolo Chui for the use of child soldiers, rape, \r\nmurder and other crimes. A judgement is likely to be \r\nissued in the first half of next year. \r\n The ICC’s third trial opened in November last \r\nyear against Jean-Pierre Bemba, who is charged as a \r\nmilitary commander with rape, murder and pillaging \r\nallegedly committed in the Central African Republic. \r\nThe trial has progressed well, and the prosecution case \r\nis at an advanced stage. \r\n We also have a fourth trial under preparation, \r\nstemming from the situation in Darfur, Sudan. War \r\ncrimes charges in connection with an attack on an \r\nAfrican Union mission were confirmed against \r\nAbdallah Banda and Saleh Jerbo in March. The process \r\nof disclosure of evidence in this particular case \r\nillustrates some of the many challenges the ICC faces \r\nin order to secure a fair trial. The evidence is required \r\nto be translated into Zaghawa, as the accused do not \r\nfully understand and speak any other language. \r\nHowever, there are virtually no professional translators \r\nor interpreters for Zaghawa, and the ICC has had to \r\nhire and train native speakers to reach the required \r\nlevel of proficiency to provide language support. \r\n The proceedings on the situation in Kenya have \r\nprogressed significantly in the past year. There are two \r\ncases, each involving three senior persons alleged to be \r\nresponsible for murder, persecution and other crimes in \r\nconnection with the violence that erupted in Kenya \r\nfollowing elections held in December 2007. All six \r\nindividuals complied with summonses issued by the \r\nPre-Trial Chamber in March and voluntarily came to \r\nthe Court, first in April for an initial appearance, and \r\nagain in September for more substantive hearings on \r\nthe confirmation of charges. In January at the latest, \r\nthe Pre-Trial Chamber will issue its rulings on whether \r\nthe cases should proceed to trial. \r\n In the context of the Kenya situation, the ICC set \r\na legal precedent by dismissing the Kenyan \r\nGovernment’s challenge against the admissibility of \r\nthe two cases. The Pre-Trial Chamber and the Appeals \r\nChamber both held that the Government of Kenya had \r\nfailed to provide sufficient evidence to substantiate that \r\nit was investigating the six suspects for the crimes \r\nalleged in the proceedings at the ICC. \r\n A decision on the confirmation of charges is also \r\npending in the case against Callixte Mbarushimana, \r\ncharged with attacks on the civilian population \r\nallegedly committed in the Kivu region of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo in 2009. He was \r\narrested last year by the French authorities, and I thank \r\nFrance for this valuable cooperation with the ICC. \r\n In addition to the seven investigations, the Office \r\nof the Prosecutor is conducting preliminary \r\nexaminations regarding Afghanistan, Colombia, \r\nGeorgia, Guinea, Honduras, Nigeria, Palestine and the \r\nRepublic of Korea, as well as receiving information \r\nconcerning many other countries. Such situations, \r\nhowever, do not necessarily evolve into formal ICC \r\ninvestigations, particularly if the competent national \r\nauthorities investigate the crimes and prosecute the \r\nalleged offenders. \r\n When I spoke before the Assembly last year (see \r\nA/65/PV.39), I expressed my deep concern over the \r\nfact that the ICC’s arrest warrants for Joseph Kony and \r\nthree other alleged commanders of the Lord’s \r\nResistance Army had been outstanding for more than \r\nfive years in the situation in Uganda. Unfortunately, \r\nthat remains the case, and the same applies to Bosco \r\nNtaganda in the situation in the Democratic Republic \r\nof the Congo. In the situation in Darfur, the arrest \r\nwarrants against President Al-Bashir, as well as those \r\nagainst Ahmad Harun and Ali Kushayb, remain \r\noutstanding. \r\n This is deeply distressing for the victims as well \r\nas the international community. I implore States to \r\nredouble their efforts to bring the persons in question \r\nto justice. I also wish to recall that the Security Council \r\nhas urged all Member States to cooperate with the ICC \r\nwith respect to the situation in Darfur, Sudan, and the \r\nsituation in Libya. \r\n Explaining to victims why some arrest warrants \r\nhave not yet been implemented is one of the \r\nchallenging tasks of the ICC’s outreach programme. \r\nEvery week, often in remote towns and villages of the \r\nsituation countries, outreach meets with hundreds of \r\npeople, making the process of justice more accessible \r\n A/66/PV.44\r\n \r\n3 11-56550 \r\n \r\nand understandable to those affected by the crimes \r\nunder the Court’s jurisdiction. Special sessions are \r\norganized for groups consisting of women and \r\nchildren.  I have personally had the privilege of \r\nparticipating in outreach activities in the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo and Uganda. I was deeply \r\nmoved by the victims’ struggle to rebuild their lives, \r\nand by their cries for relief and justice. \r\n The concern for the plight of victims is reflected \r\nin the various ways in which victims are empowered by \r\nthe Rome Statute as participants in judicial \r\nproceedings, as recipients of reparations following a \r\nCourt conviction, and as beneficiaries of victims’ \r\nassistance provided by the Trust Fund for Victims that \r\nis associated with the ICC. \r\n Working in the situation countries, the ICC \r\ninforms victims about their rights and helps them turn \r\nthe possibilities offered by the Rome Statute into \r\nconcrete action. During the past 12 months alone, the \r\nICC has received more than 10,000 victims’ \r\napplications for participation or reparation. Legal \r\nassistance provided by the ICC has made it possible for \r\nthousands of victims to participate in the proceedings \r\nthrough their lawyers. More than four years of victims’ \r\nassistance in northern Uganda and the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo have seen the Trust Fund for \r\nVictims mature into a solid institution. By recognizing \r\nthe particular needs of victims of the most serious \r\ncrimes, for instance for reconstructive surgery and \r\ntrauma-based counselling, the Trust Fund has been able \r\nto articulate a truly human dimension to the process of \r\ninternational criminal justice. \r\n As the ICC’s first judgments are drawing closer, \r\nwe may in the coming year see also the first-ever \r\njudicial decisions by the ICC on reparations to victims. \r\nWhen that moment comes, the Trust Fund for Victims \r\nwill have an important role to play, both as an \r\nimplementing agency for Court-ordered reparations \r\nand as a possible source of complementary financing of \r\nreparations awards, in the case that a convicted person \r\nis found indigent. \r\n Five countries have acceded to or ratified the \r\nRome Statute in 2011, which is more than during any \r\nsingle year since 2003. I would like to take this \r\nopportunity to extend a warm welcome to Grenada, \r\nTunisia, the Philippines, Maldives and Cape Verde, \r\nwhich have taken that important step during the last six \r\nmonths. I thank all those that facilitate informed \r\ndiscussions about the Rome Statute in different parts of \r\nthe world, for instance Qatar, which hosted the first \r\nregional conference on the ICC for the Middle East and \r\nNorth Africa region in May. \r\n Many important decisions are carried out by the \r\nStates parties, including amendments to the Rome \r\nStatute and the election of the highest officials of the \r\nCourt. The forthcoming session of the Assembly of \r\nStates Parties in December here in New York will be of \r\nparticular significance, because for the first time since \r\nthe Court’s establishment, both a prosecutor and six \r\nnew judges will be elected. \r\n An important change will also occur at the helm \r\nof the Assembly of States Parties, which will receive a \r\nnew President. I would like to pay tribute to \r\nAmbassador Christian Wenaweser, the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Liechtenstein to the United Nations, \r\nwho has provided excellent leadership of the Assembly \r\nfor the past three years, and to welcome Ambassador \r\nTiina Intelmann of Estonia, who has been \r\nrecommended by the Bureau of the Assembly as his \r\nsuccessor. \r\n A month ago, the Secretary-General pronounced \r\nfrom this rostrum that “[t]o prevent violations of \r\nhuman rights, we must work for the rule of law and \r\nstand against impunity” (A/66/PV.11, page 2). I \r\nwholeheartedly agree with this statement, which \r\nhighlights the relevance of the Rome Statute and the \r\nICC to wider international efforts to protect human \r\nrights and promote the rule of law. Indeed, the \r\npreamble to the Rome Statute sets out the Court’s \r\nobjectives, several of which overlap with the purposes \r\nof the United Nations. The common objectives of these \r\ntwo institutions include the prevention and punishment \r\nof serious international crimes, the maintenance and \r\nrestoration of international peace and security, and a \r\nguarantee of lasting respect for and enforcement of \r\ninternational law. \r\n The ICC is deeply grateful for the invaluable \r\ncooperation we continue to receive from the United \r\nNations in a wide variety of areas ranging from \r\nsecurity and field operations to the exchange of \r\ninformation with and testimony of United Nations \r\nofficials. I greatly appreciate the mainstreaming of ICC \r\nissues through the United Nations system, and the \r\nOrganization’s significant support for strengthening \r\nnational capacity to address atrocity crimes in \r\nA/66/PV.44  \r\n \r\n11-56550 4 \r\n \r\naccordance with the principle of complementarity \r\nenshrined in the Rome Statute. \r\n I warmly welcome the increased focus that the \r\nUnited Nations is placing on the rule of law and justice \r\nthrough regular reports and discussions here in the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council. I am \r\noptimistic that the proposed high-level meeting on the \r\nrule of law to be held during the sixty-seventh session \r\nof the General Assembly will give these discussions \r\nnew impetus. \r\n The United Nations and the international \r\ncommunity have recognized that justice is an integral \r\nelement of conflict resolution. In his 2009 report on \r\nmediation, the Secretary-General stated that “[w]hen \r\nconflicts lead to gross violations of human rights and \r\ninternational humanitarian law, peace and justice are \r\nindivisible” (S/2009/189, para. 35). The report \r\ncautioned that ignoring the administration of justice \r\nleads to a culture of impunity that will undermine \r\nsustainable peace and recognized that when \r\n “the jurisdiction of the International Criminal \r\nCourt is established in a particular situation, then, \r\nas an independent judicial body, the Court will \r\nproceed to deal with it in accordance with the \r\nrelevant provisions of the Rome Statute and the \r\nprocess of justice will take its course” (ibid., \r\npara. 37). \r\nI call upon all actors to follow this guidance to respect \r\nthe ICC’s jurisdiction. if justice is to have an impact, it \r\nmust follow its own rules without interference and \r\nwithout being subject to political considerations. \r\n On 1 July 2012, we will celebrate the Court’s \r\ntenth anniversary. Coinciding with that, a new chapter \r\nwill open for the ICC as the mandate of the first \r\nProsecutor, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, comes to an end and \r\nhe hands the baton to his successor. With the increasing \r\nrelevance of the ICC in the international community’s \r\nresponse to conflicts, the amount of work before the \r\nCourt has grown significantly. So far, the Court has \r\nmanaged to cope by seeking savings and simply \r\nworking harder, and I am proud that we can play such \r\nan important role in the service of the international \r\ncommunity. However, if the expectations of us keep \r\ngrowing while our resources remain the same, the \r\nsituation may become untenable.  \r\n I appeal to all United Nations Member States to \r\nstand united behind the international efforts to suppress \r\nthe gravest crimes known to humanity. The Rome \r\nStatute is based on common values of fundamental \r\nimportance: peace, security and the well-being of the \r\nchildren, women and men of the world. By joining this \r\ncommunity, each State adds a brick to a wall that \r\nprotects future generations from terrible atrocities. \r\n Mr. Sefue (United Republic of Tanzania): At the \r\noutset, the African States parties wish to reaffirm their \r\nunwavering support for the fight against impunity for \r\nthe most serious crimes of concern to the international \r\ncommunity. We stress that those who are implicated in \r\nsuch crimes must be held accountable. \r\n The Group would like to express its appreciation \r\nto the President of the International Criminal Court \r\n(ICC), Judge Sang-Hyun Song, for presenting the \r\nseventh annual report on the work of the Court, as \r\nsubmitted to the United Nations in document A/66/309. \r\nThe report clearly demonstrates that the Court is a \r\nliving institution that has achieved significant progress \r\nin its investigations and judicial proceedings. \r\n The International Criminal Court is a historic \r\ndevelopment in the global struggle to advance the \r\ncause of justice and the rule of law, and to end \r\nimpunity. Its creation represents a major success in \r\ninternational law. It seeks to foster a more peaceful and \r\njust world. It promotes respect for the rule of law. It \r\nupholds international humanitarian law and human \r\nrights. \r\n The International Criminal Court has become an \r\nessential instrument in the prevention of horrendous \r\ncrimes such as genocide, crimes against humanity and \r\nwar crimes. Not only does it act as a deterrent to \r\npotential perpetrators, but its mandate ensures that \r\npersons accused of those offences are actually brought \r\nto justice in accordance with the provisions of the law. \r\n The Court’s deterrence against the most serious \r\ninternational crimes is beginning to be felt as it \r\nengages in greater judicial activity. As a fully \r\nfunctional judicial institution, the Court is making \r\nsubstantial progress in its work and is developing its \r\nown jurisprudence on fundamental aspects of the law. \r\nWe look forward to the first verdict of the Court, which \r\nis expected to be delivered by the end of the year. The \r\nrole played by the Court is indeed one of the noblest \r\nachievements of our time. \r\n War crimes, crimes against humanity and \r\ngenocide know no borders. We must therefore work \r\n A/66/PV.44\r\n \r\n5 11-56550 \r\n \r\ntogether to fight those crimes. The Rome Statute is \r\nbuilt upon the principle that the most heinous crimes of \r\ninternational concern must not go unpunished. To that \r\nend, the Rome Statute affords States the opportunity to \r\ndeal with cases of human rights violations under \r\ndomestic law and allows the ICC to assume jurisdiction \r\nonly where national judicial systems have failed, are \r\nunable or are unwilling to act. However, the primary \r\nresponsibility for bringing offenders to justice remains \r\nwith States. The principle of complementarity is a \r\npositive development in the quest to promote and \r\nprotect human rights by ensuring that accountability \r\nprevails. \r\n If the Court is to be effective and successful, \r\nuniversal ratification of the Rome Statute is \r\nfundamental. Equally important, we have to ensure that \r\nthe perpetrators of the world’s most egregious crimes \r\nare denied safe haven and brought to justice. We \r\ntherefore need to step up our collective efforts to \r\npromote the universality of the Rome Statute. \r\n This year two African States, Tunisia and Cape \r\nVerde, ratified the Rome Statute, bringing the number \r\nof African states that have ratified the Statute to 33. We \r\nwelcome the increased ratification of the Rome Statute \r\nfrom different regions of the world. However, in order \r\nto reach our common goal of ensuring that perpetrators \r\nof heinous crimes are brought to justice, we must \r\nredouble our efforts and continue to work for the \r\nuniversal acceptance of the Rome Statute. \r\n The ICC relies on the cooperation of its member \r\nStates, international organizations and civil society in \r\ndischarging its mandate. The Relationship Agreement \r\nwith the United Nations has been very instrumental in \r\nthe success of the activities of the Court. The African \r\nGroup supports strengthened and enhanced \r\ncooperation, as provided under the Relationship \r\nAgreement. \r\n The cooperation of the international community, \r\nthe United Nations and other international and regional \r\norganizations remains vital to the success of the Court. \r\nThe cooperation of the African region is especially \r\ncritical. The ICC would not be the Court it is today \r\nwithout the valuable input, involvement and support of \r\nthe majority of African States. African States were \r\nactively involved in the negotiations of the Rome \r\nStatute and have been actively involved in the work of \r\nthe Court since its inception. At 33, the number of \r\nAfrican States parties to the Rome Statute is close to \r\n28 per cent of the 119 States parties. All six of the \r\nCourt’s current cases, three of which are self-referrals, \r\nare from Africa. \r\n All of this illustrates the high regard that the \r\nregion has for the protection and promotion of the rule \r\nof law. African States avail themselves of the judicial \r\nassistance provided by the Court in cases that, due to \r\ntheir complexity and/or political sensitivity, lend \r\nthemselves to be better dealt with by the Court. It is \r\nnot true that Africa is against the Court and its \r\nrationale. \r\n It is true, nevertheless, that there is a lingering \r\nperception that relations between the ICC and African \r\ncountries could be better. Perhaps even more African \r\ncountries would ratify the Statute if those relations \r\nimproved. Obviously, the majority of African countries \r\nare against impunity and want to see the ICC \r\ncontributing to the development of a culture of good \r\ngovernance and respect for human rights across the \r\ncontinent. It is therefore important for the next \r\nProsecutor of the ICC to prioritize the improvement of \r\nrelations between the Court and the African Union. It is \r\nincumbent upon States parties to bear that in mind as \r\nthey consider candidates for that important position \r\nand ensure that we elect a Prosecutor who can rise to \r\nthat challenge. The future success of the Court will \r\ndepend on improved relations with its supporters \r\nacross Africa. \r\n Mr. Loulichki (Morocco), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n The administration of international criminal \r\njustice in Africa has precedent in the Special Court for \r\nSierra Leone and the International Criminal Tribunal \r\nfor Rwanda. Those two judicial bodies have \r\nestablished respect for the rule of law and have brought \r\npeace, order and stability to conflict-torn societies. In \r\nconclusion, I wish to reiterate the African Group’s \r\nwillingness to remain engaged in the work of the Court \r\nas we uphold the cause of ending impunity and \r\nreinforcing respect for the rule of law. \r\n Ms. Kaukoranta (Finland): I have the honour to \r\nspeak on behalf of the five Nordic countries Denmark, \r\nIceland, Norway, Sweden and my own country, \r\nFinland. \r\n Let me start by thanking the International \r\nCriminal Court (ICC) for its annual report to the \r\nUnited Nations (see A/66/309). I would also like to \r\nA/66/PV.44  \r\n \r\n11-56550 6 \r\n \r\nthank Judge Sang-Hyun Song, President of the ICC, for \r\nhis very informative presentation highlighting key \r\nissues in the report. Both the report and his \r\nintroduction distinctly reflect the increasing activities \r\nof the Court. \r\n The reporting period is marked by significant \r\nevents for the ICC and for the global fight against \r\nimpunity. In February, the Security Council used for \r\nthe second time the powers granted in the Rome Statute \r\nand unanimously referred the Libyan situation to the \r\nCourt. That is yet another acknowledgement of the fact \r\nthat the ICC is a necessary tool in ensuring that \r\nperpetrators of international crimes are brought to \r\njustice. Recently, the Pre-Trial Chamber granted the \r\nProsecutor’s request for authorization to open \r\ninvestigations proprio motu into the situation in Côte \r\nd’Ivoire. The ICC is today more relevant on the \r\ninternational scene than ever before. \r\n Moreover, the number of judicial proceedings, \r\ninvestigations and preliminary examinations is \r\ngrowing. That puts pressure on the Court to deliver on \r\nits core function of ensuring accountability for the \r\nmost serious crimes of international concern. As the \r\nworkload increases, necessary resources have to be \r\nensured for the Court to fulfil the mandate given to it. \r\nThe effective functioning of the Court is of the utmost \r\nimportance for the Nordic countries. \r\n The end of the current reporting period has also \r\nbeen marked by the tragic news of Judge Antonio \r\nCassese’s death. Judge Cassese was the first President \r\nof both the Special Tribunal for Lebanon and the \r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the former \r\nYugoslavia, and he also had a long career in academia. \r\nHe was one of the most prominent figures in the field \r\nof international criminal justice, and he will be sorely \r\nmissed. \r\n The Nordic countries welcome the first \r\nratification, by San Marino, of the Kampala \r\namendment to article 8 of the Rome Statute. The \r\njurisdictional reach of the Court is also expanding as \r\nthe number of States parties to the Statute constantly \r\ngrows. As Cape Verde recently became the 119th State \r\nto join the Statute, the goal of universal ratification is \r\nyet one step closer. The Nordic countries also warmly \r\nwelcome to the ICC family Seychelles, Saint Lucia, the \r\nRepublic of Moldova, Grenada, Tunisia, the \r\nPhilippines and Maldives, which have all ratified the \r\nRome Statute since the beginning of the reporting \r\nperiod. \r\n The Court is not, however, able to carry out its \r\nmandate without strong cooperation from States. It is a \r\nvery worrying development indeed that the number of \r\noutstanding arrest warrants is also growing. We would \r\nlike once more to recall the legal commitment of States \r\nparties to cooperate with the Court and to respect the \r\nobligations of the Rome Statute.  \r\n Similarly, in the Darfur situation we call on all \r\nStates, and the Sudanese authorities in particular, to \r\ncooperate fully with the Court and to comply with their \r\nlegal obligations under Security Council resolution \r\n1593 (2005). We would also encourage the Security \r\nCouncil to consider measures that would ensure \r\ncompliance with that resolution. \r\n As far as the cooperation extended by the United \r\nNations to the Court is concerned, the Nordic countries \r\nhave taken note with great satisfaction of the various \r\nforms that such cooperation has taken, as detailed in \r\nthe report before us. \r\n The Court plays an important role in ensuring \r\nthat those who have committed the gravest crimes \r\ncannot escape justice. In addition, the ICC and the \r\nRome Statute system have a role in the broader \r\nframework of fostering the rule of law. It is States that \r\nbear the primary responsibility to investigate and \r\nprosecute ICC crimes in accordance with the principle \r\nof complementarity that governs the Court’s \r\njurisdiction. That relationship received new impetus \r\nfrom the Kampala Review Conference and its \r\npreparatory process. \r\n There are persuasive arguments for enhancing \r\nnational capabilities to try alleged perpetrators. In this \r\nrespect, we would like to draw attention to the ICC’s \r\nLegal Tools Project. The Legal Tools database is the \r\nleading resource for legal information on core \r\ninternational crimes and will help those who are \r\nentrusted with the investigation, prosecution, defence \r\nand adjudication of such crimes to work more cost-\r\neffectively. \r\n It is of great significance for the victims and their \r\ncommunities to see that perpetrators are brought to \r\njustice in their own country. In cases where national \r\ntrials are not an option for various reasons, the \r\nInternational Criminal Court is an indispensable \r\nvehicle for ensuring justice and accountability. It is \r\n A/66/PV.44\r\n \r\n7 11-56550 \r\n \r\nalso vital to ensure that the issue of victims’ \r\nparticipation and protection remains high on the \r\nagenda of the International Criminal Court. \r\n Let me finish by reiterating the Nordic countries’ \r\nfirm and long-standing support for the International \r\nCriminal Court. As the Court is faced with challenges \r\non many fronts, our resolution to overcome those \r\nchallenges and to extinguish impunity must be even \r\nstronger. \r\n Mr. Rowe (Australia): It is my honour to speak \r\ntoday on behalf of the group of Canada, Australia and \r\nNew Zealand (CANZ). On behalf of that group, I \r\nwould like to thank the President of the International \r\nCriminal Court (ICC), Judge Sang-Hyun Song, for his \r\nexcellent report (see A/66/309) on the work of the \r\nCourt over the past year. \r\n The International Criminal Court remains a \r\nconcrete expression of our collective desire to ensure \r\njustice for victims of atrocity and to end impunity for \r\nperpetrators of the most serious crimes through a law-\r\nbased system. Ultimately, and ideally, it is States \r\nthemselves that have primary responsibility for \r\nprosecuting serious crimes committed in their territory \r\nor by their nationals. Where this does not happen, the \r\nCourt acts as a complementary and necessary safety net \r\nof accountability. \r\n Over the past year, we have witnessed the growth \r\nof political and diplomatic support for the ICC. There \r\nare now 119 States parties to the Rome Statute. We \r\nwarmly welcome the membership this year of Grenada, \r\nTunisia, the Philippines, the Maldives and Cape Verde. \r\nWe are particularly pleased at the increase in \r\nrepresentation in the Rome Statute system from States \r\nin the Asian region, which has been underrepresented \r\nfor some time. \r\n The workload of the Court continues to grow. A \r\nlandmark development this year was the Security \r\nCouncil’s unanimous referral of the situation in Libya \r\nto the ICC in the early stages of the conflict. That \r\nsecond Security Council referral demonstrates both its \r\nmembers’ respect for the work of the Court and the \r\nimportant role of the Court in international peace and \r\nsecurity architecture. CANZ welcomes the statements \r\nof the National Transitional Council that it is \r\ncommitted to accountability and to the establishment of \r\na new system of Government in Libya in which \r\nindividual rights are protected under the rule of law. \r\n Of course, the swift and decisive action taken by \r\nthe Council with regard to Libya can be contrasted \r\nwith the Council’s inaction in relation to Syria. CANZ \r\ntakes this opportunity to call on the members of the \r\nSecurity Council to take action to ensure that the \r\nperpetrators of Rome Statute crimes that appear to have \r\nbeen committed in Syria are brought to justice. \r\n CANZ welcomes President Ouattara’s \r\nconfirmation of Côte d’Ivoire’s acceptance of the \r\nCourt’s jurisdiction as a non-State party under article \r\n12, paragraph 3, of the Rome Statute. We welcome the \r\nopening of an investigation with respect to crimes \r\ncommitted since 28 November in Côte d’Ivoire. We \r\nhope that fruitful cooperation between Côte d’Ivoire \r\nand the ICC on ensuring accountability will contribute \r\nto stability in the long term and encourage Côte \r\nd’Ivoire to join the Rome Statute as a permanent State \r\nparty. \r\n Although the Court has never been busier, the \r\ncooperation of States in enforcing international arrest \r\nwarrants remains a challenge. CANZ recognizes the \r\ndifficulties that non-execution of Court requests can \r\nimpose on the Court’s ability to fulfil its mandate, and \r\nurges all States parties to fully comply with Court \r\nrequests for cooperation. \r\n One of the most important flow-on effects of the \r\nICC has been to act as a catalyst for States to ensure \r\ntheir domestic capacity to deal with crimes under the \r\nRome Statute. In order to link complementarity and \r\nbroader efforts to fight impunity over the long term, \r\nthe international community must focus on building the \r\nnational capacity of States to assume their \r\nresponsibilities in the justice sector. In this regard, \r\nCANZ notes the conclusions of the World Bank’s \r\nWorld Development Report 2011 with respect to the \r\nimportance of restoring confidence in institutions \r\ncapable of delivering justice, security and economic \r\nreform in order to break the cycle of violence in fragile \r\nStates. \r\n With the delivery of the closing statements in the \r\ntrial of Thomas Lubanga, who is charged with having \r\ncommitted war crimes in the Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo, and the imminent delivery of a judgement \r\nin that case, the Court is entering a new phase in its \r\ndevelopment. Six new judges will be elected at the \r\nDecember meeting of States parties. The quality of \r\njudges will determine the quality of justice that the \r\nCourt is able to deliver. We urge States Parties to \r\nA/66/PV.44  \r\n \r\n11-56550 8 \r\n \r\nconsider, when making their decisions with regards to \r\nthe election, the important pre-trial, trial and appeal \r\nwork that will be undertaken by the judges of the Court \r\nin coming years. \r\n The next Assembly of States Parties will also \r\nelect the next prosecutor for a term of nine years. We \r\ntake this opportunity to thank outgoing Prosecutor \r\nLouis Moreno-Ocampo for the firm leadership he has \r\nbrought to this important position in the Court’s \r\nformative years. \r\n We are pleased that the search committee process \r\nhas produced four eminently qualified candidates for \r\nthe position of Prosecutor. The candidate selected by \r\nthe Assembly will have the important responsibility of \r\nsteering the Office of the Prosecutor through the next \r\nphase of the Court’s development. \r\n Canada, New Zealand and my own country, \r\nAustralia, are deeply committed to working for the \r\nCourt’s success as an essential safety net for preventing \r\nimpunity. We call on those States not yet party to the \r\nRome Statute to join us in the fight to end impunity \r\nand bring justice to the victims of those crimes that, by \r\ntheir very nature, deeply shock the conscience of all \r\nresponsible members of the international community. \r\n Mr. Charles (Trinidad and Tobago): I have the \r\nhonour to make this statement on behalf of the \r\n14 member States of the Caribbean Community \r\n(CARICOM). \r\n Today’s debate on the report of the International \r\nCriminal Court (ICC) (see A/66/309) is an important \r\nitem on the Assembly’s agenda, as it provides an \r\nopportunity for all Member States, States parties, \r\nStates not parties and observer States to assess the \r\nwork of the Court over the past year. CARICOM \r\ntherefore express its appreciation to His Excellency \r\nSang-Hyun Song, President of the Court, for presenting \r\nthe report submitted pursuant to the Relationship \r\nAgreement between the United Nations and the ICC. \r\n CARICOM notes the progress made by the Court \r\nduring the reporting period in the discharge of its \r\nmandate set out in the Rome Statute, namely, to bring \r\nto justice the perpetrators of those crimes listed in \r\narticle 5 of the Statute. While we recognize the efforts \r\nof the ICC to move forward and bring the cases now \r\nbefore it to a successful completion — as exemplified \r\nin the case of The Prosecutor v. Thomas Lubanga \r\nDyilo, where a verdict is expected by the end of the \r\nyear — we remain concerned over the lack of progress \r\nin some other matters. These matters include, for \r\nexample, the case of The Prosecutor v. Joseph Kony \r\nand others, where lack of progress is due to the failure \r\nto execute four arrest warrants that have been \r\noutstanding since July 2005.  \r\n CARICOM urges all entities that have binding \r\nlegal obligations to cooperate with the Court to ensure \r\nthat the accused persons are arrested and brought to the \r\nCourt for trial. Any continued failure to resolve this \r\nprotracted matter would serve to further inhibit the \r\nability of the ICC to bring to justice individuals who \r\nare accused of committing grave atrocities that have \r\naffected and continue to affect thousands of victims, \r\nincluding women and children. \r\n We also note with appreciation the Prosecutor’s \r\nattempts to investigate and monitor information on \r\ncrimes potentially falling within the jurisdiction of the \r\nCourt beyond the African continent. These involve \r\nsituations in Latin America, Asia and Eastern Europe. \r\nCARICOM views these developments as suitable \r\nrebuttals to the arguments proffered by some detractors \r\nof the Court who have alleged that the ICC has been \r\ntargeting Africa while ignoring atrocities committed \r\nelsewhere. \r\n The ongoing work of the Court demands that it be \r\nprovided with sufficient resources to effectively \r\ndischarge its functions. While we acknowledge the \r\nobligations of States parties to the Statute to finance \r\nthe operations of the Court, CARICOM recalls the \r\nprovisions of article 115, paragraph (b) of the Statute, \r\nwhich identifies funds of the Court as including:  \r\n “Funds provided by the United Nations, subject \r\nto the approval of the General Assembly, in \r\nparticular in relation to the expenses incurred due \r\nto referrals by the Security Council”.  \r\nCARICOM is of the view that now is an opportune \r\nmoment for the Court and the United Nations to engage \r\nin some form of dialogue on this subject, especially \r\nsince this is a time when the referral of a new situation \r\nby the Security Council has increased pressure on the \r\nresources available to the Court. \r\n The ICC is a unique institution in many respects. \r\nThat is due, in part, to its reliance on the cooperation of \r\nStates parties, other States and intergovernmental \r\norganizations to carry out its work efficiently. We \r\ncommend the growing areas of cooperation between \r\n A/66/PV.44\r\n \r\n9 11-56550 \r\n \r\nthe ICC and the United Nations within the framework \r\nof the Relationship Agreement between the two \r\norganizations. These areas include cooperation in \r\nsecurity matters, air transport in support of missions in \r\nsituation countries and the signing of a memorandum \r\nof understanding in order to facilitate the secondment \r\nof an expert from the Office of Internal Oversight \r\nServices to act as the temporary head of the \r\nIndependent Oversight Mechanism established by the \r\nICC.  \r\n CARICOM also welcomes the increased areas of \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and other \r\nintergovernmental organizations, including the \r\nOrganization of American States and the \r\nCommonwealth. Such collaboration will assist the ICC \r\nand the international community at large in the \r\npromotion of peace, security and an end to impunity. \r\n Over the past year, we have also witnessed an \r\nincrease in the number of States that have become \r\nadherents to the Rome Statute. We now count among \r\nthe 119 States parties our sister CARICOM member \r\nState of Grenada. We also welcome Cape Verde, the \r\nPhilippines, the Maldives and Tunisia to the fold. \r\nAdditional ratifications of the Rome Statute by \r\nmembers of the international community will not only \r\nincrease the universal reach of the Court, but will also \r\nprovide further legitimacy to the institution. \r\n The ICC is at a critical period in its history. At \r\nthe tenth session of the Assembly of States Parties in \r\nDecember, here at the United Nations, a new \r\nProsecutor will be elected. We wish to salute the \r\nsterling contribution made by the ICC’s first \r\nProsecutor, Mr. Moreno Ocampo, who has served the \r\ninstitution with distinction. We also appreciate the \r\nwork of the search committee established to assist \r\nStates parties in identifying a suitable successor to be \r\nelected as Prosecutor at the upcoming session. \r\n Six new judges will also be elected in December. \r\nCARICOM has endorsed the candidature of Justice \r\nAnthony Thomas Aquinas Carmona of Trinidad and \r\nTobago to fill one of the vacancies that will arise on \r\nthe bench of the ICC. We are fully convinced that \r\nJustice Carmona meets all of the requirements laid \r\ndown in article 36 of the Statute for election as a judge \r\nof the ICC, and we would welcome the support of all \r\nStates parties for his candidature. \r\n Finally, as a region that has played a significant \r\nrole in advancing the cause of the ICC and \r\ninternational criminal justice as a whole, CARICOM \r\nwill continue to work with the Court in order to enable \r\nit to live up to the expectations of its founding fathers \r\nto serve as a bulwark against impunity while \r\nsafeguarding fundamental human rights. \r\n Mr. Vrailas (European Union): The European \r\nUnion (EU) and its member States thank the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC) for its seventh \r\nannual report to the United Nations, covering the \r\nperiod from 1 August 2010 to 31 July 2011 (see \r\nA/66/309). \r\n The European Union is a staunch supporter of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court. Consolidating the rule of \r\nlaw and respect for human rights, as well as preserving \r\npeace and strengthening international security, in \r\nconformity with the Charter of the United Nations, are \r\nof fundamental importance to the Union and a priority \r\nfor it. The Seychelles, Saint Lucia, the Republic of \r\nMoldova, Grenada, Tunisia, the Philippines, Vanuatu, \r\nthe Maldives and Cape Verde — countries from \r\ndifferent regions have joined the circle of States parties \r\nto the Rome Statute, bringing its number to 119. The \r\nEuropean Union welcomes the new members and \r\npledges to continue its efforts to achieve universality \r\nand preserve the integrity of the Rome Statute. \r\n The first Review Conference of the Rome Statute, \r\nin Kampala, was a major milestone and, moreover, \r\nprovided a forum for States, international organizations \r\nand representatives of civil society to reaffirm their \r\nresolve to promote the Statute, make specific pledges \r\nto that end and submit themselves to a stocktaking of \r\ninternational criminal justice. That stocktaking \r\naddressed four fundamental issues in the Rome Statute \r\nsystem. That useful exercise culminated in the adoption \r\nof two resolutions and a declaration and clearly \r\nidentified the areas on which we ought to concentrate \r\nour efforts.  \r\n The Kampala Conference successfully concluded \r\nits discussions on the subject of two amendments to the \r\nRome Statute. The first aimed at extending the Court’s \r\njurisdiction over additional war crimes in situations of \r\nnon-international armed conflict, and the second \r\nconcerned the crime of aggression. The European \r\nUnion commends the spirit of consensus that prevailed, \r\nwhich enabled a final agreement to be reached. \r\n As it pledged at the Kampala Review Conference, \r\nthe EU has further reinforced its policy in support of \r\nthe ICC. This has been translated into important direct \r\nA/66/PV.44  \r\n \r\n11-56550 10 \r\n \r\nfinancial assistance to the Court, to civil society and to \r\nthird States. Nevertheless, the recent report of the ICC, \r\nwhile commendable insofar as it describes the effort \r\nthat the Court has made in fulfilling its mission, \r\ndescribes the challenges that the ICC is facing. The \r\nnumber of acts of violence that continue to be \r\nperpetrated, particularly against women and children, \r\nis extremely worrying. The international community \r\nmust concentrate its efforts to ensure that it is effective \r\nin punishing such crimes and preventing them in \r\nfuture. \r\n In this regard, we should recall one of the \r\nfundamental principles of the Rome Statute: \r\ncomplementarity, by which it falls first and foremost to \r\neach State to investigate and prosecute the presumed \r\nperpetrators of the most serious crimes against the \r\ninternational community and by which the Court may \r\nexercise its powers only in the event that a State is \r\nunable or unwilling to do so. The European Union and \r\nits member States are determined to pursue their \r\ncommitments to this end for the effective \r\nimplementation of the Rome Statute. Thus we need to \r\nreinforce our collective and individual efforts to ensure \r\nthat the international arrest warrants issued by the ICC \r\nare enforced. \r\n In this regard in particular the European Union \r\nand its member States also recall that Security Council \r\nresolution 1593 (2005) imposes obligations to \r\ncooperate with the Court on a State not party, in this \r\ncase the Sudan. The EU regrets the Sudan’s violations \r\nof its international obligations and commends the \r\nreaffirmation by the Kampala Review Conference of \r\nthe need for all States parties to fully meet their \r\nobligations under Part 9 of the Rome Statute. In that \r\nconnection, it expresses its concern about the \r\ndifficulties raised by certain States parties in relation to \r\nthe enforcement of those obligations. \r\n Unless all the stakeholders in the international \r\ncommunity — the States parties and the States not \r\nparties, international organizations and civil society — \r\nput up a united fight, the objectives of the Rome \r\nStatute and, more generally, the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter with regard to \r\ninternational peace, security and world well-being will \r\nnot be achieved. Despots who commit acts that are \r\ncrimes under the Rome Statute will continue to get off \r\nscot-free and use their influence to continue their \r\nactivities unchallenged. As for their victims, they can \r\nonly hope that justice will be done and that they will \r\nreceive some sort of compensation. \r\n The support the Court receives from the United \r\nNations is broadly described in the Court’s report. The \r\nEuropean Union welcomes that support and calls on \r\nother international organizations to follow its example \r\nby stepping up and formalizing their cooperation. For \r\ntheir part, the European Union and its member States \r\nundertake to pursue their efforts in the area of the fight \r\nagainst impunity, notable by giving the Court full \r\ndiplomatic support and continuing dialogue with its \r\nvarious partners to clear up any misunderstandings and \r\ndispel any concerns. It has been relentless in its efforts \r\nto date and undertakes to continue them. \r\n Mr. Bambus (Estonia): Let me begin by thanking \r\nthe President of the International Criminal Court \r\n(ICC), Judge Sang-Hyun Song, for introducing the \r\nseventh annual report of the ICC to the United Nations \r\n(see A/66/309).  \r\n Estonia aligns itself with the statement just made \r\nby the European Union on behalf of its member States. \r\n The Court is indeed busier than ever with its \r\njudicial activity, with seven situations under \r\ninvestigation and three trials ongoing, in addition to a \r\nwide range of preliminary investigations being carried \r\nout in several regions of the world. Estonia is grateful \r\nto all the Court’s staff for their daily efforts in \r\ndischarging its mandate to prosecute the perpetrators of \r\nthe most serious crimes of concern to the international \r\ncommunity. Estonia remains steadfastly committed to \r\nthe principles of the Rome Statute and to promoting the \r\nrule of law.  \r\n As the President of Estonia said in his statement \r\nto the General Assembly in the general debate at its \r\nsixty-sixth session, “The rule of law and respect for \r\ninternational law are what will help ravaged and \r\nvictimized societies to regain their dignity and rebuild \r\ntheir communities” (see A/66/PV.11, page 48). Our \r\njoint efforts remain crucial in this regard. \r\n My delegation would like to highlight four issues \r\nthat are significant to the Court’s work. These are, first, \r\nthe importance of pursuing universality of the Rome \r\nStatute; secondly, the significance of the upcoming \r\nelections of the Prosecutor and judges; thirdly, the need \r\nfor better coordination in assisting national capacity-\r\nbuilding; and fourthly, the importance of engaging \r\n A/66/PV.44\r\n \r\n11 11-56550 \r\n \r\nregional organizations and providing information about \r\nthe activities of the Court.  \r\n We are particularly pleased to note the increase in \r\nthe number of States parties to the Rome Statute with \r\nthe accession of eight new States since the beginning \r\nof the reporting period. This month, Cape Verde \r\nbecame the 119th State party to the Statute, which \r\nmeans that with the next accession the symbolic \r\n120 States — the exact number voting for the Statute in \r\n1998 — will be reached. The steady growth in the \r\nnumber of States parties demonstrates the increasing \r\npolitical will to combat impunity and enforce \r\naccountability. Estonia warmly welcomes this trend \r\ntowards universal adherence to the Rome Statute. \r\n The Court is now entering a period of leadership \r\ntransition. The election of a new Prosecutor is a crucial \r\ndecision that will have a huge impact on various \r\naspects of the Court’s life. The election process set up \r\nby the Bureau is aimed at successfully electing, by \r\nconsensus, the best-qualified individual for the \r\nposition. Clearly, the work of the search committee \r\ngives valuable input in that regard, and we are pleased \r\nto note that all States have respected its mandate. It \r\nneeds to be emphasized once again that the search \r\ncommittee is technical in nature and has an assisting \r\nfunction only. The final decision lies solely in the \r\nhands of the States parties. \r\n The Assembly of States Parties will also elect six \r\njudges, which will significantly change the bench’s \r\ncomposition. Estonia believes that the efficiency of the \r\nCourt largely depends on States parties electing judges \r\nwho are qualified in terms of their judicial expertise \r\nand experience in the practice of criminal law. We wish \r\nto thank civil society for its efforts in helping States to \r\ntake informed decisions in that regard. \r\n Among other elections, the new President of the \r\nAssembly of States Parties for the next triennium will \r\nbe elected. At this point, I am pleased to state that after \r\nconsultations with all regional groups, Estonia has put \r\nforward the candidacy of Ambassador Tiina Intelmann \r\nfor the post of the President of the Assembly of the \r\nStates Parties to the Rome Statute. If elected, she \r\nwould be the first woman President and the first to \r\nwork full time for the Assembly, which would make an \r\nadditional contribution to its work. \r\n Turning briefly to the issue of complementarity, \r\nas we all know, a State can pursue this principle only if \r\nit has the necessary legislative and institutional \r\ncapability to prosecute the crimes covered by the Rome \r\nStatute. More needs to be done to better coordinate the \r\nefforts of States, the Court, international organizations \r\nand civil society in assisting national capacity-building \r\nfor the effective investigation and prosecution of the \r\nmost serious crimes. For example, an interactive \r\nplatform for information sharing in that regard would \r\nbe a commendable initiative. \r\n Given the role of the ICC in international \r\ncriminal justice, the positive engagement of regional \r\norganizations is one of the keys to the Court’s success. \r\nThe ICC is currently active in many regions of the \r\nworld via preliminary examinations, while the Court’s \r\njudicial proceedings are mostly taking place with \r\nregard to countries that have specifically requested it to \r\ninvestigate or to situations which the Security Council \r\nhad referred to the Court. Thus, open and constructive \r\ndialogue among the ICC, regional organizations and \r\nStates is necessary to build confidence and avoid \r\npossible misunderstandings. Against that backdrop, we \r\nwelcome the organization of the regional conferences \r\nheld this year in Doha and Addis Ababa and encourage \r\nfurther steps in that direction. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to reiterate Estonia’s \r\nstrong and long-standing commitment to an \r\nindependent and credible International Criminal Court. \r\n Mr. Osman (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): We have \r\nstudied the report of the International Criminal Court \r\n(see A/66/309) very carefully, in particular sections II \r\nand III as they refer to my country, the Sudan. We find \r\nit astonishing that despite the major important positive \r\ndevelopments that occurred in the Sudan, especially in \r\nDarfur, the report, like those preceding it, continues to \r\nbe based on purely political motivations and is filled \r\nwith information that contradicts the facts.  \r\n We find ourselves once more confronted with the \r\nissue of politics masquerading as law. Nothing is more \r\ndangerous than politicizing international justice at the \r\nhands of such a body as the International Criminal \r\nCourt. Since the first preparatory meetings to negotiate \r\nthe drafting of its Statute, we have repeatedly warned \r\nof the dangers of politicizing this Court and diverting it \r\nfrom its intended objectives.  \r\n As the Permanent Representative of Tanzania \r\nalready mentioned, we, as Africans, in fact participated \r\nin all negotiations on the first draft of the Rome \r\nStatute. Since then, we have been warning of the \r\nimportance of keeping international justice separate \r\nA/66/PV.44  \r\n \r\n11-56550 12 \r\n \r\nfrom politics so as to prevent some States from using it \r\nas a tool to exclude and overlook the acts of some \r\ncountries, while unjustly punishing other countries. \r\nThe law itself does not recognize selectivity and \r\ndouble standards. \r\n In principle, linking a political body with a \r\njudicial body is a violation of the principles of justice. \r\nThe best evidence for that may be found in article 13 \r\n(b) of the Statute, which discusses the referral of cases \r\nby the Security Council to the International Criminal \r\nCourt under Chapter VII of the Charter. Furthermore, \r\nthe very referral by the Security Council of any case \r\nunder Chapter VII is in and of itself a political \r\ndecision. \r\n I need not elaborate further to the Assembly that \r\nsince the establishment of the modern State, all have \r\nagreed on the importance of separating the judiciary \r\nfrom the political and executive powers. Yet, here \r\ntoday in the twenty-first century, we are combining \r\npolitical and judicial powers. Moreover, as I just \r\nmentioned, the very referral of a case by the Security \r\nCouncil to the Court is a political decision disguised as \r\nlaw. I need not elaborate further on the Council’s \r\nworking methods and the mechanisms whereby it \r\nadopts resolutions, which the Assembly knows well in \r\nview of its continued participation in discussions of \r\nsuch issues as reform of the Security Council and \r\nimproving its working methods and its decision-\r\nmaking procedures. \r\n The topic has remained a major concern for all \r\nMember States of the Organization who have \r\ncontinued, for over two decades now, to meet in order \r\nto reform that body; however, to no avail. Given that it \r\nwas not logical for the Security Council to decide on a \r\nresolution, some Council members have exploited \r\narticle 13 (b) of the Rome Statute and manipulated it to \r\nserve their political aims. \r\n Security Council resolution 1593 (2005), which \r\nreferred the situation in Darfur to the ICC, was a \r\nshameful political decision that ignored the \r\nfundamentals of the Charter of the United Nations and \r\ninternational law. It also ignored the very important \r\nfact that peace is the foundation of justice and that \r\nPresident Omer Hassan A. Al-Bashir was the leader \r\nwho put an end to one of the longest conflicts in Africa \r\nwhen he signed the Comprehensive Peace Agreement \r\nwith our brothers in South Sudan. He was the one who \r\nenabled them to exercise their right to self-\r\ndetermination. Indeed, President Al-Bashir was the \r\nfirst world leader to recognize that nascent State and to \r\noffer it a helping hand. He was also the leader who put \r\nan end to the conflict in Darfur through the signing of \r\nthe Darfur Peace Agreement in Doha, Qatar with the \r\nmuch-appreciated support of our sisterly State Qatar. \r\n Paragraph 25 of the report before the Assembly \r\naddresses President Al-Bashir’s visits to several States \r\nparties to the Rome Statute with the claim that those \r\nStates had an obligation to cooperate with the \r\nInternational Criminal Court. That interpretation is \r\nbased on the alleged obligation in article 87 of the \r\nRome Statute. However, the Prosecutor of the Court \r\nhas overlooked the text of the Statute, specifically \r\narticle 98, which refers to the importance of respecting \r\nthe principles and rules of international law and \r\ninternational agreements concerning immunities of \r\nHeads of State and high-level Government officials and \r\nthe well-established fundamentals of international law, \r\nwhich protect the sovereignty of States with respect to \r\ntheir other international obligations, even if those \r\nconflict with the Rome Statute.  \r\n That well-established principle of international \r\nlaw is understood even by college students. In other \r\nwords, it refers to the right of the receiving States that \r\nhosted our President. Therefore, it is the sovereign \r\nright of States, although they may be party to the Rome \r\nStatute, to consider their obligations or interests under \r\nother regional or international agreements above their \r\nobligations under the Rome Statute. \r\n Why have all of those issues been ignored despite \r\nthe fact that they are specified in article 98 of the \r\nRome Statute? Where is the binding obligation — as \r\nper the legal terminology — referred to in the report? \r\nTo the contrary, article 98, as mentioned above, \r\nindicates that the decision to receive His Excellency \r\nPresident Omer Hassan A. Al-Bashir is purely a \r\nsovereign matter and thus resides solely in the hands of \r\nthe receiving country. \r\n It is very clear that the Prosecutor is dealing with \r\nthe Rome Statute in a selective manner. He picks and \r\nchooses the articles that enable him to achieve political \r\ngains, while overlooking those that contradict his \r\nwishes. My country must therefore, from this rostrum, \r\nremind everyone of the importance of their \r\nprofessional commitment to the fundamental principles \r\nof the Charter of the Organization concerning respect \r\nfor international legitimacy and State sovereignty. The \r\n A/66/PV.44\r\n \r\n13 11-56550 \r\n \r\nprimacy of the Charter of the United Nations above all \r\nother law dates back to 1947 and is a major foundation \r\nof international law. \r\n That law and the solid fundamental principles of \r\ninternational law concerning the immunity of seated \r\nHeads of State and Government have been respected \r\nand observed by the International Criminal Court itself, \r\nwhich is an institution that enjoys our respect and \r\nappreciation for its continued efforts to issue fair and \r\nlegal opinions. \r\n Thus, we could hardly react otherwise, when \r\ndiscussing a Head of State who was selected by his \r\npeople through fair and general elections that were \r\nsubject to observation by regional and other observer \r\nteams from all over the world, and from many \r\ninternational organizations, including the United \r\nNations that affirmed their transparency. \r\n State immunity is a sacred principle that cannot \r\nbe altered by a newly created mechanism that has yet \r\nto find its proper place in international law and has not \r\nyet generated merit and credibility for its work through \r\nthe efforts of its staff and employees. \r\n The basis upon which the Darfur file was referred \r\nto the International Criminal Court was politically \r\nunfair and unjust. It was created through resolution \r\n1593 (2005) pursuant to article 13 (b) of the Rome \r\nStatute, which the Sudan has never ratified. As the \r\nmembers of the Assembly know well, the Vienna \r\nConvention on the Law of Treaties specifies that if a \r\nState has not signed, ratified or acceded to a certain \r\ntreaty, it is not bound by the treaty. My country has \r\nnever ratified the Rome Statute, nor acceded to it or \r\nsigned it. Thus, in what manner would the Statute be \r\nbinding upon the Sudan? \r\n From the beginning the Prosecutor’s approach \r\nwas purely political and entirely unrelated to the law or \r\nthe principles of justice, the most important of which \r\nare integrity and impartiality. Those important \r\ncharacteristics must be available and made part of \r\nthose charged with implementing justice. \r\n The Prosecutor has exceeded his authority with \r\nrespect to referrals under article 15 of the Rome \r\nStatute, which specifies and limits the authority of the \r\nProsecutor. In this case, the Prosecutor has exceeded \r\nhis authority and engaged in impassioned political and \r\nmedia campaigns. Politics and media activities are not \r\npart of the work of the Prosecution. Such political and \r\nmedia campaigns, especially in the Security Council, \r\nhave taken place each time the Prosecutor has \r\nsubmitted a report or given a briefing. Needless to say, \r\njustice has its own sacred approach built upon \r\nimpartiality, just as politics and media activities have \r\ntheir own approaches and their own styles. Anyone \r\nwho wants to serve a political agenda is not deserving \r\nof being allowed to conduct any judicial activity, and \r\nwill not be working in the service of justice. The \r\nProsecution would have been better advised to abide by \r\nthe well-known conduct of judicial professionals. \r\nMixing politics with the law in such a way is actually \r\nthe true danger that threatens the principle of \r\ninternational justice, because it raises questions about \r\nits credibility and will force everybody to abandon it. \r\n In addition, the Prosecution has made it a habit to \r\noverlook the facts. It overlooked the fact that peace \r\ntakes precedence over justice. Justice cannot prevail or \r\nmaintain its balance unless peace prevails as well, as \r\nillustrated by numerous prior experiences in conflict \r\nresolution throughout the world. We have seen how in \r\nmany countries, following the resolution of the \r\nconflict, the parties have made consensual efforts \r\ntowards reconciliation and reparations. The experience \r\nof South Africa comes to mind. In that case, the worst \r\nand cruellest practices of apartheid took place, with the \r\ngrossest of violations. However, subsequently, \r\neveryone chose peaceful resolution, reconciliation and \r\nreparations. \r\n It is therefore not surprising that our mother \r\ncontinent of Africa is being targeted. If ones goes back \r\nto the information available, they will find that African \r\nleaders make up the overwhelming majority of those \r\ntargeted by the International Criminal Court. We are \r\nthe ones paying the price of that misuse of the principle \r\nof the concept of universal jurisdiction. In addition to \r\nthe various imbalances that exist in the working \r\nmethods of the Security Council, that concept was \r\ntaken out of its proper context and has been misused \r\nthrough the Rome Statute — in addition to the various \r\nimbalances that exist in the work methods of the \r\nSecurity Council. \r\n Texts and articles were misused by certain circles \r\nto use the International Criminal Court as a tool to \r\ntarget certain African States and leaders, as if Africa \r\nwere the sole jurisdiction of the Court. That has led the \r\nAfrican Union to adopt the principled position of \r\nstrongly rejecting that blatant politicization of \r\njustice — a position reaffirmed by all summit meetings \r\nA/66/PV.44  \r\n \r\n11-56550 14 \r\n \r\nof the African Union. Everybody knows this; it is \r\nbeyond question.  \r\n Moreover, the Council also knows well that that \r\nposition has been supported by a considerable number \r\nof major regional organizations and political groups at \r\nthe United Nations. From this rostrum, I would like to \r\nexpress my appreciation to all member States of those \r\norganizations that, although States parties to the Rome \r\nStatute, have nevertheless never hesitated to declare \r\ntheir total rejection of the Court’s transformation from \r\na legal body to a body for political schemes and \r\nextortion far removed from the purposes and objectives \r\nfor which the Court was created.  \r\n What kind of justice, while fixated on events in \r\nAfrica, completely overlooks the hundreds of \r\nthousands of civilians who suffered genocide and were \r\ncollectively exterminated using the most modern \r\nmachines of death and destruction in areas beyond the \r\ncontinent? Where are the preconditions for the exercise \r\nof jurisdiction as stipulated in article 12 of the Rome \r\nStatute?  \r\n The Sudan would like to reiterate its firm \r\nconfidence in the peace-loving nations that, guided by \r\nthe values of true justice and equality, would never \r\naccept the politicization of justice in that fashion, or \r\nthe diversion of the International Criminal Court so far \r\naway from the objectives for which it was founded. We \r\nare fully confident that all States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations, including States parties to the Rome \r\nStatute, have completely understood the reasonableness \r\nand logic of the Sudan’s position in refusing to deal \r\nwith the Court. As I explained through my earlier \r\nreference to the Vienna Convention on the Law of \r\nTreaties, the Sudan is not a party to the Rome Statute.  \r\n In conclusion, let me share the most recent \r\npositive developments concerning the resolution of \r\nwhat remains of the conflict in Darfur, which is our \r\nmain concern. Thanks to the much appreciated efforts \r\nof the sisterly State of Qatar and the roles of the \r\nAfrican Union and the United Nations, including the \r\nassistance of regional and international partners, our \r\nongoing efforts over many years culminated in July in \r\nthe signing of the Doha Document for Peace in Darfur. \r\n In the spirit of the Doha Document, Mr. Al-Haj \r\nAdam Youssef, one of Darfur’s most notable leaders \r\nand himself a son of Darfur, was appointed Deputy \r\nPresident of the republic. In addition, just two days \r\nago, Khartoum welcomed Mr. Tijani Sese, leader of the \r\nLiberation and Justice Movement, which is a signatory \r\nto the Doha Document for Peace in Darfur, who has \r\nbeen appointed to head the regional authority of \r\nDarfur. In other words, the sons of Darfur are now \r\nthemselves responsible for Darfur regionally, and at the \r\nfederal level are represented in the post of Deputy \r\nPresident. One of the main priorities of the regional \r\nauthority of Darfur is to bring about full peace and \r\nstability through urgent development projects focused \r\non development, recovery and reconstruction, \r\nincluding creating an environment conducive to \r\nstability and the voluntary return of internally \r\ndisplaced persons.  \r\n The Government of the Sudan has also approved \r\nthe allocation of £2 billion annually as an initial step in \r\norder to achieve those objectives. Our sisterly State of \r\nQatar has also announced the allocation of $2 million \r\nto assist in the reconstruction of Darfur. In other words, \r\nthe process of peace, reconstruction and development \r\nhas already started in Darfur. The Doha Document, \r\nwhich is already being implemented, contains clear \r\nguidelines for reconciliation, reparations, justice, \r\nsettlements and the restoration of the social fabric of \r\nDarfur. Would it not be better for the international \r\ncommunity to support those efforts, as it has done with \r\nother countries that suffered similar conflicts? As I \r\nmentioned earlier, it should do so by encouraging \r\nreconciliation and the peaceful settlement of disputes. \r\n The Sudan has its own judicial system, well \r\nknown for its quality, efficiency, integrity and \r\nprofessionalism — a solid legal heritage that has \r\nspread beyond the borders of the Sudan itself to several \r\nother States. Our legal system is more qualified and \r\ncapable than any other entity to restore the balance of \r\njustice and to address the various claims and \r\ngrievances arising from the conflict that we have \r\nalready moved past by signing the Doha Document for \r\nPeace in Darfur. \r\n That Document calls for the creation of special \r\ntribunals, which will start to work to uphold justice in \r\nDarfur. In accordance with the Doha Document, we \r\nstand ready to receive international observers from \r\nUnited Nations and other entities to observe the work \r\nof the special tribunals as they restore the balance of \r\njustice in Darfur. \r\n Mr. Tag-Eldin (Egypt): At the outset, I would \r\nlike to express Egypt’s appreciation to the President of \r\nthe International Criminal Court (ICC) for submitting \r\n A/66/PV.44\r\n \r\n15 11-56550 \r\n \r\nthe report under consideration today (A/66/309), and to \r\nthe Court for playing an important role in the \r\ndevelopment of concepts of international criminal law \r\nto address the heinous crimes committed against \r\npeoples and societies and to fight impunity. \r\n At this time of fundamental change in the Middle \r\nEast, adhering to the principles of the Rome Statute \r\nand other international human rights instruments sends \r\na strong and unequivocal message to the international \r\ncommunity that we have to embrace these shifting \r\ntimes and commit to human rights and the rule of law. \r\nDuring the past few months, Egypt has demonstrated \r\nits unflinching commitment to enter into a new era in \r\nwhich society is guided by clear rules, by the principles \r\nof justice and equality before the law and by the \r\npractice of respect for human rights and fundamental \r\nfreedoms. \r\n International criminal tribunals are becoming \r\nincreasingly important in the enforcement of the rule of \r\nlaw and in promoting universal adherence to \r\ninternational law, international humanitarian law and \r\nhuman rights law, in the service of maintaining \r\ninternational peace and security. It is a well established \r\nprinciple that their role is complementary to that of \r\nnational judiciaries, which have the primary \r\njurisdiction to prosecute their citizens who commit \r\nsuch crimes. In the meantime, it should be understood \r\nthat the sovereignty of States entails responsibility, and \r\nany State’s primary responsibility is to ensure the \r\nsafety and security of its citizens and protect its people \r\nfrom crimes. \r\n Egypt welcomes the increased engagement of the \r\nCourt with the League of Arab States, and participated \r\nactively in the regional diplomatic conference on the \r\nCourt convened in May 2011 in Qatar. That conference \r\nwas the first major event of its kind in the Middle East \r\naimed at providing information on the workings of the \r\nCourt and its legal framework. Moreover, Egypt \r\ncontinues its constructive dialogue with the Court. We \r\nreceived the Court’s Prosecutor, in an effort to enhance \r\ncooperation with the Court as a State not party to the \r\nRome Statute. \r\n In the same vein, Egypt took note of the \r\noutcomes of the Review Conference of the Rome \r\nStatute convened from 31 May to 11 June 2010 in \r\nKampala, at which States parties made significant \r\npledges on a wide range of issues, one of which was to \r\narrive at a definition of the crime of aggression, taking \r\ninto account the importance of that issue, especially as \r\ncircumstances and developments on the international \r\nscene indicate the need to reach such a definition. That \r\nwill enable the Court to exercise its jurisdiction over \r\nthat crime along the lines of the other crimes falling \r\nwithin its jurisdiction. \r\n The Court can also benefit from the ongoing \r\ndiscussions in the International Law Commission on \r\nthe immunity of State officials from foreign criminal \r\njurisdiction, with a view to enriching dialogue and \r\nexchange of views among the international legal and \r\njudicial bodies working in the framework of \r\nmultilateralism, which should enhance conformity and \r\ncomplementarity in the work of those bodies.  \r\n Egypt also stresses that the International Criminal \r\nCourt should continue to pursue a balanced approach in \r\nits work by adopting a policy that accentuates its \r\njudicial nature, so as to ensure its impartiality and \r\nindependence and allow the Court to assume its legal \r\nand moral obligations. Furthermore, the procedures for \r\ninvestigating, gathering evidence and authenticating \r\ndocuments need to be improved, especially with regard \r\nto investigating crimes and providing strong material \r\nevidence, to confirm the consistency of the crimes \r\ncommitted and those defined in the Statute.  \r\n Consequently, Egypt reiterates that the Court \r\nshould respect the considerations to which I have \r\nreferred when dealing with the African cases referred \r\nto it. The Court should also consider cases from other \r\nparts of the world. Otherwise, the continued \r\nconsideration of cases focused on one region of the \r\nworld may give the mistaken impression that crimes \r\nagainst humanity are being committed only in Africa or \r\nthat the Court does not target other regions where those \r\ncrimes are also being committed. The Security Council \r\nshould also take that into consideration when referring \r\ncases to the ICC. In that context, Egypt expresses its \r\nsupport to the call of the African Union to the Security \r\nCouncil to defer the processes initiated by the ICC with \r\nregard to the cases of the Sudan and Kenya, in \r\naccordance with the provisions of article 16 of the \r\nRome Statute. \r\n It is also imperative that the Prosecutor expedite \r\nthe decision to begin the investigation of the crimes \r\nagainst humanity committed in the occupied \r\nPalestinian territory. We reaffirm the responsibility of \r\nthe international community to follow up the \r\nrecommendations of the report of the United Nations \r\nA/66/PV.44  \r\n \r\n11-56550 16 \r\n \r\nFact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict \r\n(A/HRC/12/48), as recommended by the General \r\nAssembly in its resolution 64/10, of 5 November 2009, \r\nand resolution 64/254, of 26 February 2010. In that \r\nregard, the Court should ensure that there is \r\ndefinitively no impunity, as a prerequisite to upholding \r\nthe word of justice and the establishment of legal \r\nnorms that we all strive to implement, while \r\nconsolidating the application of the rule of law to all \r\npeoples and communities, without exception. \r\n Mr. Wenaweser (Liechtenstein): I would like to \r\nthank the President of the International Criminal Court \r\n(ICC) for presenting another rich report on the \r\nactivities of the Court (A/66/309). The Court continues \r\nto have a profound impact in several conflict and post-\r\nconflict situations in furtherance of its mandate to fight \r\nimpunity, in accordance with the Rome Statute. We are \r\nparticularly pleased that the number of States parties \r\nhas grown to 119, just one shy of the number of States \r\nthat voted in favour of the Rome Statute in 1998. We \r\nwarmly welcome Cape Verde, the Philippines, the \r\nMaldives, Tunisia and Grenada as new members of the \r\nICC family. \r\n The new momentum in the quest for the \r\nuniversality of the Rome Statute bears testament to its \r\nquality and to the highly professional work carried out \r\nby the Court. More and more States are willing to \r\nsupport the Rome Statute system, and accept the \r\njurisdiction of the ICC as complementary to their own \r\nprimary jurisdiction. While the acceptance of the \r\nCourt’s jurisdiction is not yet universal, the main \r\nprinciple underlying the Rome Statute indeed is. There \r\nmust be no impunity for the worst crimes under \r\ninternational law. Indeed, in writing the Rome Statute, \r\nStates merely confirmed and further codified that \r\nprinciple, which was well established in pre-existing \r\ninternational law. States parties to the Rome Statute \r\navail themselves of an additional mechanism by which \r\nthey can promote the implementation of that principle.  \r\n In addition, the Security Council, utilizing its \r\npowers under the Charter and under the Rome Statute, \r\nmay also trigger the Court’s jurisdiction. That the \r\nCouncil has chosen to do so twice in the short history \r\nof the Court is a further testament to the widespread \r\nrecognition of the quality of the Court’s work. \r\n We would like to encourage all States that have \r\nnot yet done so to consider the advantages of joining \r\nthe Rome Statute. The most important of those is that \r\nthe Court, as an independent international institution, \r\nmay if necessary conduct investigations and trials \r\nconcerning crimes committed on the territory of a State \r\nparty or by its nationals. The Court thus provides \r\nprotection, through its deterrent effect, as well as a \r\nsystem of accountability and justice with strong regard \r\nfor the rights of victims.  \r\n The ICC is not a mechanism of universal \r\njurisdiction, as has been said before from this rostrum. \r\nRather, it builds mainly on the existing territorial \r\njurisdiction of the State concerned. It also provides \r\nprotection to States parties with regard to crimes that \r\nmay be committed on their territories by nationals of \r\nother States, including States not party to the Statute. \r\nThe Court’s jurisdiction is, however, complementary to \r\ndomestic jurisdiction, which takes precedence as long \r\nas national authorities are willing and able to conduct \r\ngenuine investigations and prosecutions. \r\n The ICC is one of the most important tools in the \r\nfight against impunity, but it is not the only one. It is \r\nStates themselves that play the greatest role in that \r\nrespect. Fighting impunity is, in most cases, best \r\nundertaken at the national level, in particular since the \r\nICC and other international mechanisms can only deal \r\nwith a limited number of cases. It is thus imperative \r\nthat all States — not just States party to the Rome \r\nStatute — ensure domestic capacity and willingness to \r\ninvestigate and prosecute the most serious crimes \r\nunder international law.  \r\n The international community must do better in \r\nencouraging and assisting such efforts. We believe that \r\nthe efforts conducted within the United Nations could \r\nbe strengthened through better coordination, in \r\nparticular through the Rule of Law Coordination and \r\nResource Group. \r\n Recent and ongoing events in North Africa and \r\nthe Middle East have once again highlighted the \r\nparticular challenges and the indispensable role of \r\njustice mechanisms in conflict resolution. The victims \r\nof crimes and human rights violations deserve and \r\ndemand justice, just as much as they deserve and \r\ndemand peace. As numerous examples in the past have \r\nshown, transitional processes must include a justice \r\ncomponent as a fundamental building block of \r\nsustainable peace. Amnesties for those responsible for \r\nthe most serious crimes are inherently incompatible \r\nwith that principle and risk reigniting the cycle of \r\nviolence. \r\n A/66/PV.44\r\n \r\n17 11-56550 \r\n \r\n Earlier this year, the Security Council referred the \r\nsituation in Libya to the International Criminal Court \r\nin resolution 1970 (2011). It did so, for the first time in \r\nhistory, by a unanimous vote. That swift action allowed \r\nthe Court to initiate its investigations at an early stage \r\nand therefore in a most efficient manner. It is our hope, \r\nhowever, that the Council has learned the lessons of the \r\nDarfur referral and will, if necessary, insist that the \r\nCourt receive due cooperation from all States \r\nconcerned.  \r\n Such long-term follow-up is an indispensable part \r\nof responsible interaction with the Court, which should \r\nnot simply be employed as a short-term exit strategy \r\nfor complex conflict situations. In that context, we also \r\nnote that the issue of funding of ICC investigations \r\nmandated by the Council remains an open question that \r\nshould be addressed, in accordance with the United \r\nNations Charter and the Rome Statute — and it should \r\nbe addressed by the General Assembly. \r\n Since this is the last chance I have to speak on \r\nthis topic while also serving as President of the \r\nAssembly of States Parties to the Rome Statute, I \r\nwould like to take this opportunity to thank all the \r\nStates parties for the trust they have placed in me over \r\nthe past three years.  \r\n Mr. Zellweger (Switzerland) (spoke in French): \r\nMy delegation would first like to thank President Sang-\r\nHyun Song for presenting the seventh annual report of \r\nthe International Criminal Court (see A/66/309). We \r\nalso wish to express our appreciation to all the staff \r\nmembers of the Court for their daily efforts in fulfilling \r\ntheir work, which is constantly growing. \r\n My delegation would like to bring five points to \r\nthe attention of the General Assembly. First, the \r\nInternational Criminal Court is now an integral part of \r\nthe international architecture. The year 2011 was \r\nmarked by the unanimous decision of the Security \r\nCouncil to refer the situation in Libya to the Court in \r\nresolution 1970 (2011). That constituted a recognition \r\nof the fight against impunity as a precondition for \r\nlasting peace. It also reflects the fact that the Court has \r\nbecome a necessary and indispensable instrument for \r\nthe international community. We welcome that \r\ndevelopment. \r\n That brings me to my second point. The Court \r\ncannot be effective in isolation. We should consider \r\nspecific proposals on how the Court’s activities could \r\nbe better integrated into the international system. The \r\nCourt should be considered an essential component of \r\nthe international community’s efforts, particularly in \r\npost-conflict situations. It can only develop its full \r\npotential in close cooperation with all efforts to restore \r\nthe rule of law and to deal with the past. \r\n We therefore emphasize how crucially important \r\nit is for the Court to be able to cooperate with States, \r\nregional and international organizations and civil \r\nsociety, both at the institutional and operational levels. \r\nHowever, it is essential, of course, that such an \r\nintegration be carried out with full respect for the \r\nCourt’s independence. \r\n Thirdly, with 119 States parties, the Court’s \r\nmarch towards universality is inevitable. This should \r\nencourage States that still have fears or reservations \r\nabout it to seriously consider ratifying the Rome \r\nStatute and becoming active members of the Assembly \r\nof States Parties to the Rome Statute. Moreover, the \r\nprompt ratification of the Kampala amendments to the \r\nRome Statute is also necessary in order to help realize \r\nthe Court’s bid for universal standing. Clearly, the \r\ninclusion of the crime of aggression in the Rome \r\nStatute is a milestone that strengthens ius contra \r\nbellum. That should be applauded. \r\n Fourthly, Switzerland underscores that the \r\nmission of the Court, and the fight against impunity in \r\ngeneral, entail real responsibilities. On the one hand, \r\nthe ICC is responsible for selecting the situations and \r\ncases it follows. It must be able to explain why it takes \r\naction in some cases and not in others. On the other \r\nhand, those who refer situations to the Court also bear \r\na responsibility. If they ask the ICC to become \r\ninvolved in a situation, they must fully assume the \r\nconsequences. For example, they cannot invoke so-\r\ncalled alternative routes to justice. \r\n More generally, States must show complete \r\nconsistency in their support for the Court. One cannot \r\napplaud the issuance of arrest warrants in one case and \r\ncriticize them or even fail to execute them in other \r\ncases. That does not mean that the Court is above \r\ncriticism. On the contrary, it must be accountable for \r\nits activities to the Assembly of States Parties as well \r\nto the international community as a whole. \r\n Fifthly — and this is my last point — the \r\nresponsibility of States parties to the Court implies that \r\nit be given the means to fully carry out its mandate. \r\nWhen the United Nations makes a referral to the Court, \r\nthereby increasing its work load, the question arises \r\nA/66/PV.44  \r\n \r\n11-56550 18 \r\n \r\nwhether it would not be reasonable to expect the \r\nUnited Nations to contribute towards covering the \r\nrelated costs. \r\n In conclusion, the Court is a channel for the \r\ninternational criminal law system, which is \r\nprogressively developing. The fight against impunity \r\npursues a civilizing goal — a more humane and \r\npeaceful world. To accomplish its mission, the Court \r\nneeds our full support. Its activities this year have once \r\nagain shown us that it fully deserves that support. \r\n Mr. Yamazaki (Japan): I would like to thank \r\nPresident Sang-Hyun Song for his in-depth report on \r\nthe most recent work of the International Criminal \r\nCourt (ICC) (see A/66/309). Japan attaches great \r\nimportance to the rule of law in the international \r\ncommunity. In that regard, we have been actively \r\nassisting the work of the ICC, which is the only \r\npermanent international criminal court contributing to \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security \r\nthrough the punishment of the most serious crimes of \r\nconcern to the international community as a whole. \r\n Our basic stance on the Court can be expressed in \r\nthe following four words — effectiveness, efficiency, \r\nuniversality and sustainability. Those four criteria will \r\ndetermine the future of the ICC and whether we can \r\nuniversalize it. As the number of the States parties to \r\nthe Rome Statute increases, safe havens for \r\nperpetrators will be reduced and preventive effects \r\nshould be enhanced. \r\n To encourage more States to become members of \r\nthe ICC, the Court should produce a solid record of \r\nperformance by both effectively implementing its \r\nactivities and efficiently managing the conduct of its \r\nwork. In order for the Court to realize effectiveness \r\nand efficiency, it is important for us to bear in mind \r\nthat we should not put excessive burdens on the Court, \r\nbut rather develop it in a systematically sustainable \r\nway. \r\n As this year’s report by the Court mentions, five \r\nnew States acceded to or ratified the Rome Statute \r\nduring the reporting period. The Government of Japan \r\nwould like to welcome those new members and is \r\nlooking forward to working with them. Besides those \r\nfive States, the Asia-Pacific Group has witnessed two \r\nStates becoming new members of the ICC more \r\nrecently this year. The Government of Japan would like \r\nto extend our warm welcome to the Republic of the \r\nPhilippines and the Republic of Maldives. Although \r\nthose two States bring the number of the States parties \r\nin the Asia-Pacific Group to 17, we would like to \r\ncontinue especially encouraging the Asia-Pacific States \r\nthat have not yet done so to accede to or ratify the \r\nStatute and join the circle to end impunity. \r\n Let me finally touch upon the issue of \r\ncooperation. The experience of the ICC, although \r\nrelatively short, has reaffirmed the importance of \r\ncooperation among the various stakeholders. There is \r\nno doubt that cooperation by States is indispensable for \r\nthe effective and efficient implementation of the Rome \r\nStatute, including the arrest and surrender of suspects \r\nand the collection of evidence. In those cases where \r\nfull cooperation has been extended by the States \r\nconcerned, the ICC is making steady progress. Where \r\nsuch cooperation has not been forthcoming, the ICC \r\nfaces serious challenges.  \r\n Close cooperation among the Court, States parties \r\nand civil society is also essential for the further \r\ndevelopment of the Court. In addition, cooperation \r\nbetween the Court and the United Nations, including \r\nthe Security Council, is becoming more important, \r\nespecially as we have witnessed the second referral by \r\nthe Security Council to the Court this year. The \r\nGovernment of Japan is willing to actively and \r\nconstructively participate in the discussion on the way \r\nforward to further strengthen cooperation. \r\n Japan sincerely hopes that the points it has raised \r\ntoday will be given serious consideration by the ICC, \r\nthe States parties, other States and civil society.  \r\n In conclusion, let me express the sincere \r\nappreciation of Japan for the work that the ICC has \r\naccomplished to date. It is our hope that the ICC will \r\ncontinue to work diligently in the fight against \r\nimpunity and to consolidate its credibility and \r\nreputation. In that regard, Japan is determined to \r\ncontinue to strengthen its contribution to the ICC and \r\nthus to the establishment of the rule of law throughout \r\nthe international community. \r\n Mr. Limeres (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nArgentina expresses its appreciation and recognition to \r\nthe President of the International Criminal Court, \r\nSang-Hyun Song, for submitting the report of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court contained in document \r\nA/66/309. \r\n The Rome Statute and the International Criminal \r\nCourt are among the most notable achievements of \r\n A/66/PV.44\r\n \r\n19 11-56550 \r\n \r\nmultilateral diplomacy, and their contribution to the \r\nfight against impunity with regard to crimes against \r\nhumanity, genocide and war crimes is evident. Only a \r\ndecade after the adoption of the Rome Statute, the \r\nCourt is a fully functioning permanent international \r\ncriminal tribunal. \r\n Since the last report of the International Criminal \r\nCourt to this Assembly (see A/65/313), in addition to \r\nthe situations in Uganda; the Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo; the Central African Republic; Darfur, \r\nSudan; and Kenya, the Security Council referred the \r\nsituation in Libya to the ICC, and Pre-Trial Chamber \r\nIII authorized the Prosecutor to open an investigation \r\non Côte d’Ivoire. The Prosecutor is also carrying out \r\npreliminary examinations of situations in Afghanistan, \r\nColombia, Georgia, Guinea, Honduras, Nigeria, the \r\nRepublic of Korea and Palestine. \r\n This year finds the Rome Statute and the \r\nInternational Criminal Court even stronger than before. \r\nTo date, 119 States are parties to the Statute. In this \r\nregard, I would like to welcome to the Statute Cape \r\nVerde, the Philippines, Grenada, the Maldives and \r\nTunisia. \r\n The other reason for satisfaction is the first \r\nratification of the amendments to the Rome Statute, by \r\nSan Marino. \r\n Regarding the amendments to the Rome Statute, \r\nlet us recall that the modification of article 8 has added \r\nto the war crimes committed in the context of armed \r\nconflicts of a non-international character the use of \r\npoison or poisoned weapons, the use of asphyxiating, \r\npoisonous or other gases and all analogous liquids, \r\nmaterials or devices, and the use of bullets which \r\nexpand or flatten easily in the human body. Such \r\namendments are a step forward in the fight against \r\nimpunity regarding breaches of international \r\nhumanitarian law. \r\n But it is the amendments on the crime of \r\naggression that determined the historic significance of \r\nthe 2010 Kampala Review Conference, given that, with \r\nthe adoption of articles 8 bis, 15 bis and 15 ter, the \r\nmandate of the now deleted paragraph 2 of article 5 of \r\nthe Rome Statute, regarding the crime of aggression, is \r\nfulfilled. \r\n The Court will be able to exercise its jurisdiction \r\nover crimes of aggression committed one year after the \r\nratification or acceptance of the amendments by \r\n30 States parties and when the parties have adopted a \r\ndecision, after 1 January 2017, to activate the exercise \r\nof jurisdiction of the Court in accordance with the \r\namendment.  \r\n We the States parties must commit ourselves to \r\nratifying the amendments adopted in Kampala as soon \r\nas possible. \r\n Through resolution 1970 (2011), the Security \r\nCouncil, acting under Chapter VII of the Charter, \r\ndecided to refer the situation in Libya since \r\n15 February 2011 to the Prosecutor of the Court. We \r\nsupport that decision. But there are two aspects about \r\nwhich I would like to express Argentina’s serious \r\nconcern, given their potential significant impact on the \r\ninternational criminal justice system established with \r\nits basis in the Court. \r\n Paragraph 6 of the resolution provides that  \r\n “nationals, current or former officials or \r\npersonnel from a State outside the Libyan Arab \r\nJamahiriya which is not a party to the Rome \r\nStatute of the International Criminal Court shall \r\nbe subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of that \r\nState for all alleged acts or omissions arising out \r\nof or related to operations in the Libyan Arab \r\nJamahiriya established or authorized by the \r\nCouncil, unless such exclusive jurisdiction has \r\nbeen expressly waived by the State”.  \r\n The Security Council followed the dangerous \r\nprecedent in the referral of the case of Darfur, Sudan, \r\nof creating for Security Council referrals exceptions to \r\nthe Court’s jurisdiction that are not provided for in the \r\nRome Statute. \r\n The other area in which the Security Council \r\nadopted a decision that could have a serious impact on \r\nthe Court is the contents of paragraph 8 of resolution \r\n1970 (2011), in which the Council recognized that  \r\n “none of the expenses incurred in connection \r\nwith the referral … shall be borne by the United \r\nNations and that such costs shall be borne by the \r\nparties to the Rome Statute …”. \r\nSuch a provision is inconsistent with Article 115 of the \r\nRome Statute, paragraph (b) of which provides that the \r\nexpenses of the Court and the Assembly of States \r\nParties shall be provided by  \r\n “(f)unds provided by the United Nations, subject \r\nto the approval of the General Assembly, in \r\nA/66/PV.44  \r\n \r\n11-56550 20 \r\n \r\nparticular in relation to the expenses incurred due \r\nto referrals by the Security Council”.  \r\n The summary of the annual report of the Court \r\npoints out that “the growing casework and the referral \r\nof a new situation by the Security Council has \r\nincreased pressure on the resources available to the \r\nCourt”. \r\n Beyond the competence of the General Assembly \r\nwith regard to budgetary matters, the 2004 \r\nRelationship Agreement between the United Nations \r\nand the International Criminal Court also governs this \r\nissue. In article 13 the Agreement provides that “the \r\nconditions under which any funds may be provided to \r\nthe Court by a decision of the General Assembly of the \r\nUnited Nations pursuant to article 115 of the Statute \r\nshall be subject to separate arrangements” and that \r\n“[t]he Registrar shall inform the Assembly of the \r\nmaking of such arrangements”. Nevertheless, the issue \r\nof the conditions for the provision of funds by the \r\nUnited Nations in accordance with article 115 of the \r\nRome Statute has not been addressed.  \r\n We therefore urge Member States to take up this \r\nissue, given that in the present situation, in which the \r\nCourt is fully functioning in a variety of cases — \r\nincluding those referred to it by the Security \r\nCouncil — the failure to take action with respect to the \r\nfunds to be provided by the United Nations by virtue of \r\narticle 115 of the Statute will only have a negative \r\nimpact on the cases currently before the Court and on \r\nthe proprio motu action of the Prosecutor. \r\n The International Criminal Court is the first \r\npermanent international criminal tribunal. For the full \r\nexercise of its jurisdiction, the cooperation of States, in \r\nparticular States parties, is required. The report of the \r\nCourt indicates that warrants of arrest are outstanding \r\nfor a total of 12 suspects and that the cooperation of \r\nStates in bringing these persons to justice continues to \r\nbe a key condition for the effective implementation of \r\nthe Court’s mandate. \r\n We should recall that Part 9 of the Rome Statute \r\nestablishes obligations for the States parties. We must \r\ntherefore strengthen our efforts to ensure full \r\ncooperation with the Court, in particular in the \r\nenforcement of Court decisions and the execution of \r\nwarrants of arrest. \r\n I shall finish by recalling the goals and purposes \r\nof the Rome Statute, as stated in the Kampala \r\nDeclaration:  \r\n “the noble mission and the role of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court in a multilateral \r\nsystem that aims to end impunity, establish the \r\nrule of law, promote and encourage respect for \r\nhuman rights and achieve sustainable peace, in \r\naccordance with international law and the \r\npurposes and principles of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations”, \r\nand to reiterate, once again, the firm commitment of \r\nArgentina to the International Criminal Court. \r\n Mrs. Morgan (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nMexico wishes to thank the President of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court, Judge Sang-Hyun Song, \r\nfor his presentation of the seventh annual report of the \r\nCourt to the United Nations (see A/66/309).  \r\n We welcome the recent accession to and \r\nratification of the Rome Statute of the International \r\nCriminal Court by five States. To date, 119 States \r\nMembers of the United Nations have become States \r\nparties to the Rome Statute, which demonstrates the \r\nclear trend towards the universalization of the Statute. \r\n In the nine years since the operationalization of \r\nthe new judiciary system created by the Rome Statute, \r\nwe have seen the International Criminal Court \r\ngradually consolidate its commitment to end impunity \r\nfor the commission of the most serious crimes with \r\ninternational importance. This year will be especially \r\nrepresentative, since it will mark the conclusion of the \r\nfirst trial undertaken by the Court since its creation. \r\nThe Lubanga case will undoubtedly constitute a \r\nwatershed in international justice, since it becomes the \r\nfirst case to be tried by a permanent international \r\ncriminal tribunal. Mexico welcomes that and the other \r\nadvances in the Court’s judicial work, as detailed in the \r\nreport (see A/66/309). \r\n Despite the foregoing, and despite the Court’s \r\nimmense efforts, there are still important challenges \r\nthat we the States parties to the Rome Statute must \r\nresolve.  \r\n To ensure the efficacy of the Court’s endeavours \r\nin the investigation and prosecution of crimes, we \r\nMember States must ensure that outstanding arrest \r\nwarrants are executed and that there is cooperation \r\nwith the authorities of the Court. We believe it is \r\n A/66/PV.44\r\n \r\n21 11-56550 \r\n \r\nrelevant to emphasize that States’ full cooperation with \r\nthe Court is a fundamental requirement so that it can \r\ncarry out the mandate for which it was created. \r\n The challenges facing the Court require the \r\ncollaboration of States and regional and international \r\norganizations to fully and effectively solidify the Court \r\nas an institution, to make it a promoter of the rule of \r\nlaw at the international level and a true model of \r\njustice that complements the rule of law within each of \r\nits member States. \r\n On the other hand, the coming months will offer \r\nan important opportunity to demonstrate the \r\ninstitutional strength of the International Criminal \r\nCourt. During the tenth session of the Assembly of \r\nStates Parties, the Court will undergo a change in \r\nleadership. The States parties will be asked to elect a \r\nnew Prosecutor and six judges, who in turn will elect \r\nthe next President of the Court. The Assembly will also \r\nhave to examine matters related to governability and \r\nthe lack of cooperation of States and will have to adopt \r\na budget that reflects the Court’s true needs but that \r\nalso reflects the difficult global economic situation.  \r\n Those challenges are not small. The Court will \r\nneed to demonstrate that, beyond the personalities that \r\nhave accompanied it in its first steps, it has sufficient \r\ninstitutional strength to meet the judicial challenges in \r\nan unfavourable political and economic context. \r\n With respect to the Court’s efficiency, one \r\nfundamental matter on which all States parties to the \r\nRome Statute will need to agree is the financing of its \r\nactivities. The Court’s mandate must be supported by \r\nthe funds required for the investigation and prosecution \r\nof crimes and that guarantee its institutional \r\nfunctioning.  \r\n Equally important to the Court’s effectiveness is \r\nthe primacy of the principle of equity. My delegation \r\nfirmly believes that international criminal justice does \r\nnot refer simply to the set of rules that govern \r\ninternational society but that it also implies equity \r\nbetween the States and organizations that participate in \r\nit. In that respect, my delegation firmly supports the \r\nidea of finding a formula by which international \r\norganizations that refer cases to the International \r\nCriminal Court can participate, on an equitable basis, \r\nin financing its activities.  \r\n Other matters relevant to the near-term future of \r\nthis tribunal have to do with reparations for damages to \r\nvictims. We will pay attention to developments on this \r\nissue in the future.  \r\n With regard to integrity, Mexico believes it would \r\nbe useful to undertake an analysis of the good practices \r\nof other international tribunals in order to ensure that \r\nthe International Criminal Court incorporates \r\nexperiences of proven success.  \r\n Mexico wishes to reiterate its commitment to the \r\nInternational Criminal Court and to strengthening it as \r\nan institution. This year, as in previous years, Mexico \r\nalso introduced a resolution on the Court in the \r\nOrganization of American States, urging the countries \r\nof the region to ratify and implement the Rome Statute \r\nand to cooperate with the Court. Mexico has also \r\ncontinued to participate actively in the working group \r\non amendments, where we have presented a draft \r\nproposal to include the use of nuclear weapons as a \r\ncrime falling under the jurisdiction of the Court.  \r\n The work of the Court contributes to achieving \r\nthe goals of maintaining peace and international \r\nsecurity that gave rise to the United Nations. It is up to \r\nthe international community to work in concert to \r\nmaintain the efficacy, efficiency and integrity of the \r\nRome Statute and to help solidify the Court’s position \r\nas a model of justice. Mexico reiterates its commitment \r\nto that goal. \r\n Mr. Sorreta (Philippines): I am pleased to join in \r\ntoday’s debate by affirming and expressing at the very \r\noutset the commitment of my country and my people to \r\nfighting impunity in all corners of our world. \r\n On 30 August the Philippines became the \r\n117th State to join the Rome Statute with the deposit of \r\nour instrument of ratification with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations. That was an historic \r\nmoment for my country and my people. We had stood \r\nup to the impunity of colonial rule and a dictatorship. \r\nNow we stand with the rest of the world in saying \r\n“Never again” to impunity anywhere. \r\n Today we renew that pledge. Respect for and \r\nadherence to human rights are cornerstones of any \r\nthriving democracy and foundations of a stable and \r\nsecure global community. It is therefore the \r\nresponsibility of every individual, and even more so, \r\nevery State, to promote, uphold and protect human \r\nrights. \r\n Today the Philippines says that there should be \r\nno space for impunity in our world. Justice and the rule \r\nA/66/PV.44  \r\n \r\n11-56550 22 \r\n \r\nof law dictate that those who act with impunity must be \r\nheld accountable. In that regard, the Philippines has \r\nlaunched its candidature for a seat on the International \r\nCriminal Court. In Ms. Miriam Defensor Santiago, the \r\nPhilippines has found someone eminently qualified for \r\nthat position. We hope that our friends and partners \r\nwill support our efforts to be part of the Court. \r\n The Philippines welcomes the report of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court on its activities in 2009 \r\nand 2010 (see A/65/313), which details the inroads \r\nmade by the International Criminal Court in the global \r\nfight against impunity. We would like to thank Judge \r\nSang-Hyun Song, President of the Court, for his \r\nexhaustive report.  \r\n We note the Review Conference of the Rome \r\nStatute that was held in Kampala. The Kampala \r\nDeclaration reaffirmed the commitment of States \r\nparties to the Rome Statute and to its full \r\nimplementation, as well as its universality and \r\nintegrity. \r\n The decision to celebrate 17 July as the Day of \r\nInternational Criminal Justice underscores the \r\nimportance of the Rome Statute, which was adopted on \r\nthat historic day in 1998. \r\n The Philippines also notes the stocktaking on \r\ninternational criminal justice held during the Review \r\nConference, which focused on the impact of the Rome \r\nStatute system on victims and affected communities, \r\npeace and justice, and complementarity and \r\ncooperation. The Declaration on Cooperation, the \r\nPhilippines believes, is vital in helping to provide \r\nsupport and improved assistance to States that seek to \r\nenhance their cooperation with the Court. \r\n The Philippines likewise notes that the Court is \r\nseized of seven situations and is closely following \r\ndevelopments in that regard. The opening of a new \r\ninvestigation, the three ongoing trials, the dismissal of \r\ncharges against a suspect, the voluntary appearance, \r\npursuant to a summons to appear, of two suspects in \r\nthe Darfur situation, and the issuance of the second \r\nwarrant of arrest are significant developments in the \r\nwork of the Court and demonstrate a firm resolve to \r\naddress impunity. We note that the execution of the \r\nnine outstanding warrants remains one of the pressing \r\nchallenges. \r\n The Philippines views with interest, together with \r\nothers, the activities of the Office of the Prosecutor, \r\nwhich continues to work to proactively monitor all \r\ninformation on crimes potentially falling within the \r\njurisdiction of the Court. \r\n On international cooperation, the Philippines \r\nwelcomes the Court’s continued contact with the \r\nUnited Nations Office of Legal Affairs with respect to \r\nthe testimony of United Nations officials, the provision \r\nof information and the mainstreaming of the Court \r\nthroughout the United Nations system. The Philippines \r\nalso welcomes the efforts made by the Court to keep \r\nitself apprised of institutional and judicial \r\ndevelopments with respect to the cabinets of the \r\nSecretary-General and the Deputy Secretary-General, \r\nthe Department of Peacekeeping Operations, the \r\nDepartment of Political Affairs, the Office for the \r\nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs and UNICEF, \r\namong others. This demonstrates the vital link between \r\nthe activities of the United Nations and the mandate of \r\nthe Court. \r\n The developments set out in the report show the \r\ninroads that the Court has achieved in prosecuting \r\nindividuals responsible for the most serious crimes of \r\ninternational concern. Yet it is clear that challenges \r\ncontinue to confront the Court. \r\n In closing, allow me to say that the Philippines \r\nshall do its part as a State party to ensure that Court is \r\nable to serve the cause of justice, consistent with its \r\nmandate. \r\n Mr. Mukongo Ngay (Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo) (spoke in French): My delegation took note of \r\nthe seventh annual report of the International Criminal \r\nCourt (ICC) (see A/66/309), as submitted by the \r\nPresident of the Court, Judge Song.  \r\n My delegation would like to begin by associating \r\nitself with the statement made by the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of the United Republic of Tanzania on \r\nbehalf of the African States parties. \r\n It is important to recall that the situation in the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo was referred to the \r\nICC by the Congolese authorities, on behalf of the \r\nsuffering people of a country in a post-conflict \r\nsituation, which some rightly termed the first African \r\nworld war. The ICC was created with the purpose of \r\naddressing this kind of situation. That is why the \r\nformulation of the Rome Statute, while it may be mere \r\ntheory for some, represents for the Congolese people a \r\nliving reality that they have experienced and continue \r\n A/66/PV.44\r\n \r\n23 11-56550 \r\n \r\nto experience. Wars and all forms of violence that strip \r\nhuman beings of their dignity and deny the sacredness \r\nof life know no boundaries. That reality, which some \r\nwould like to limit to the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo so as to sidestep their obligations and \r\nresponsibilities, is intolerable and unacceptable. This is \r\na matter that concerns us all, and cooperation with the \r\nICC should lie at the heart of our efforts. \r\n With respect to cooperation, we would note once \r\nagain that the Democratic Republic of the Congo is the \r\nfirst State party to have developed noteworthy and \r\nexemplary cooperation with the ICC. The endeavours \r\ncarried out in that respect by my country make it a \r\nmodel of cooperation with the ICC, as evidenced by \r\nseveral legal instruments. The Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo did not wait for the entry into force of the \r\nRome Statute to ratify it. It did so on 30 March 2002, \r\nthat is, more than three months before the entry into \r\nforce of the treaty. \r\n The Democratic Republic of the Congo took the \r\ninitiative of referring its situation to the ICC as early as \r\n3 March 2004, signed a judicial cooperation agreement \r\nwith the Court on 6 October 2004, and concluded a \r\nlegal assistance agreement with the United Nations \r\nOrganization Mission in the Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo and the ICC. The Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo, with respect to the proceedings before the \r\nCourt, on three occasions appropriately executed arrest \r\nwarrants issued by the ICC with respect to Congolese \r\nnationals.  \r\n It is thus evident that the Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo is convinced that peace and justice are \r\ncomplementary. We are fully aware of the irreplaceable \r\nrole of justice as a factor in social cohesion, national \r\nreconciliation, peace, security and stability. It was \r\nthrough justice that peace returned to the region of \r\nIturi, in North Katanga, and in other parts of the \r\ncountry. It is justice that enables peacebuilding efforts \r\nto continue with a view to ensuring security throughout \r\nour country. \r\n The seventh annual report of the ICC, which is \r\nunder discussion today, underscores the growing \r\nimportance of the work of the Court and of the Rome \r\nStatute in the international arena. Along those lines, my \r\ndelegation notes, with respect to the situation in the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, that four cases are \r\ncurrently being considered, two of which are at the \r\npreliminary examination stage. My delegation is aware \r\nthat the Court is only at the beginning stage of the \r\ntrials and can therefore understand the lengthy nature \r\nof the proceedings, but it continues to hope that the \r\nfirst judgements of the Court will be handed down \r\nbefore the end of 2011.  \r\n My delegation would also like to take this \r\nopportunity to recall its interest in seeing the proposal \r\nof holding trials in situ translated into reality. It \r\nbelieves that this would offer the long-hoped-for \r\nopportunity to provide a certain moral satisfaction to \r\nthe victims of the crimes in question as well as a means \r\nof deterring potential repeat offenders. \r\n The progress made in international criminal \r\njustice has taken place in the context of strong shows \r\nof hostility against the Court. My delegation therefore \r\ndeems it important that the Court implement \r\nmechanisms that can put an end to such campaigns, \r\nwhich risk undermining the Court’s reputation and \r\njeopardizing its success, even though more than half of \r\nthe States Members of the United Nations had joined \r\nthe Court less than five years after its inception. \r\n However, it is equally important that the Court \r\nconsider the manner in which it functions and reflect \r\non its working methods so as to become more \r\nprofessional and less political, given that politics and \r\njustice do not necessarily go hand in hand. \r\n In closing, my delegation would like to welcome \r\nto the group of States parties Tunisia, Maldives and \r\nCape Verde, which recently joined the ICC, bringing \r\nthe number of States parties to 119. \r\n The Review Conference on the Rome Statute of \r\nthe ICC, which took place in Kampala, Uganda, in May \r\nand June 2010, was for member States a useful \r\noccasion to reaffirm the achievements made in the \r\ncontext of the Rome Statute and to strengthen the \r\nconviction that the ICC is truly a gift of hope for future \r\ngenerations and a significant step forward towards \r\nrespect for human rights and the rule of law. The \r\nKampala Declaration, in which States reiterated their \r\nintention to promote the Rome Statute, its \r\ncomprehensive application and its universal character; \r\nthe results achieved by the international criminal \r\njustice system; and the amendments made to the Rome \r\nStatute, which now contains a definition of the crime \r\nof aggression and specifies the conditions in which the \r\nCourt can exercise its jurisdiction over such crimes, are \r\nachievements that we must safeguard with the utmost \r\ncare.  \r\nA/66/PV.44  \r\n \r\n11-56550 24 \r\n \r\n In conclusion, I should like to reiterate my \r\ndelegation’s wish to ensure the integrity of the ICC and \r\nto once again invite those delegations that have not yet \r\ndone so to join the ICC mechanism, so that together we \r\ncan contribute to the universality of the combat against \r\nimpunity. \r\n Mr. Tladi (South Africa): I would like to thank \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Sang-Hyun Song, President of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC), and his team of \r\njudges not only for the report, but also for their tireless \r\neffort in the promotion of international criminal justice, \r\nwith the ultimate objective of securing a peaceful \r\nworld for all who live in it.  \r\n I associate myself with the statement delivered by \r\nthe Permanent Representative of Tanzania on behalf of \r\nthe African States parties to the Rome Statute.  \r\n We have taken note of the report of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court to the General Assembly \r\ncontained in document A/66/309. We welcome new \r\nmembers Grenada, Cape Verde, Tunisia, Moldova and \r\nthe Philippines to the family of the ICC.  \r\n Much has happened since the last time that \r\nPresident Sang-Hyun Song reported to the General \r\nAssembly (see A/65/PV.39).  \r\n First, post-election violence erupted in Côte \r\nd’Ivoire. Subsequently, Côte d’Ivoire submitted a \r\ndeclaration confirming a previous declaration \r\naccepting the Court’s jurisdiction, in accordance with \r\narticle 12, paragraph 3, of the Rome Statute. On \r\n3 October, the Pre-Trial Chamber granted the \r\nProsecutor’s request for authorization to open \r\ninvestigations proprio motu into the situation in Côte \r\nd’Ivoire.  \r\n On 26 February, the Security Council referred the \r\nsituation in Libya to the Court by resolution 1970 \r\n(2011). Pursuant to that resolution, the Prosecutor \r\nopened investigations in Libya. For its part, the Court \r\nhas already issued arrest warrants against certain \r\nindividuals in that particular situation. \r\n In relation to the situation in Kenya, summonses \r\nhave been issued against six suspects in two separate \r\ncases. All six suspects voluntarily appeared before the \r\nCourt on 7 and 8 April respectively.  \r\n We have restated those facts, which are set out in \r\nthe report, not to shed any insight on any of the cases, \r\nbut simply to show the magnitude of the challenges \r\nfacing the Court. As a firm believer in judicial \r\nindependence, we shall restrict our observation on the \r\njudicial functions to a limited number of points. \r\n With respect to the situation in Libya, and indeed \r\nother cases, whether past or future, that have been or \r\nmay be referred to the Court by the Security Council, \r\nSouth Africa is well aware of the financial strain that \r\nthat places on the International Criminal Court. Given \r\nthat referral to the Court by the Council is, in \r\naccordance with Article 24 of the Charter, read with \r\nArticle 39, done on behalf of the United Nations and \r\nall its Members, it is only fair that the financial burden \r\nof that task be borne by all Members of the United \r\nNations, not only States parties to the Statute. \r\nTherefore, we hope that some consideration will be \r\ngiven to arriving at an agreement on funding \r\nmechanisms that would alleviate the budgetary strain \r\nresulting from the referral of cases by the Council. \r\n The most recent cases under consideration by the \r\nCourt, whether at the trial or the investigation stage, \r\ninvolve situations of internal conflict. That raises yet \r\nanother challenge, the need to maintain not only actual, \r\nbut also perceptions of, impartiality. At different \r\nforums, including before the Security Council, we have \r\ncalled for balanced investigations by the Office of the \r\nProsecutor to ensure that atrocities committed by all \r\nsides in any conflict are investigated and, if necessary, \r\nprosecuted.  \r\n Needless to say, that imperative has to be \r\nbalanced with financial considerations, and also with \r\nthe present prosecutorial policy that only those most \r\nresponsible should be tried before the ICC. If, \r\nhowever, the Court is seen as a victor’s Court, that will \r\nhave a negative impact on the image, credibility and \r\nintegrity of the Court as an independent dispenser of \r\njustice.  \r\n We are pleased to see from the report that the \r\nCourt will soon bring to a close its first case, the \r\nLubanga case.  \r\n Further, as in the past, we have taken note of the \r\nsituations under preliminary analysis by the Prosecutor. \r\nIn our statement of last year, we called on the Office of \r\nthe Prosecutor to consider those issues “with the \r\nrequisite urgency” and come to a decision as soon as \r\npossible, particularly those that have been pending for \r\na long period of time (see A/65/PV.41, p.20). \r\n A/66/PV.44\r\n \r\n25 11-56550 \r\n \r\n South Africa continues to believe that an \r\nimportant tool in the fight against impunity remains \r\nefforts to build national capacity to investigate and \r\nprosecute serious crimes that are of concern to the \r\ninternational community. It is thus appropriate that \r\ncomplementarity is at the heart of the Rome Statute. \r\nFor that reason, South Africa, together with Denmark, \r\ncontinues to exert efforts to mainstream \r\ncomplementarity-related activities. \r\n In June 2012, the term of the current Prosecutor \r\nwill expire, and the new Prosecutor will have to take \r\nup the seat of the chief prosecutor. We wish to pay \r\ntribute to the outgoing Prosecutor, Mr. Luis Moreno-\r\nOcampo, for the work that he has done in ushering the \r\nCourt through its years of infancy. The next Prosecutor \r\nwill have the task of taking the Court through its \r\nteenage years, which, as we all know, can be very \r\ntesting. The next Prosecutor will have to maintain \r\nbalanced and independent decision-making in a very \r\ntough political climate. \r\n The search committee established by the Bureau \r\nhas produced a short list of four candidates. We are \r\nhopeful that, under the guidance of its President, the \r\nAssembly of States Parties will in due course produce a \r\nconsensual candidate. That task should be made much \r\neasier by the fact that the candidates presented by the \r\nsearch committee are of the highest quality.  \r\n As we end our statement, we wish to say a special \r\nword of gratitude to the President of the Assembly of \r\nStates Parties, Ambassador Wenaweser, whose term \r\nexpires in December. We thank him for his tireless \r\neffort. In the same breath, we stand ready to welcome \r\nAmbassador Intelmann as the President-elect. We are \r\nhappy to affirm that we stand ready to support her as \r\nshe leads the Assembly of States Parties into the future.  \r\n The International Criminal Court is an institution \r\ndesigned to create a better world through fighting \r\nimpunity. We will continue to support the Court, so \r\nthat it can grow from strength to strength. \r\n  The meeting rose at 6 p.m. \r\n"
