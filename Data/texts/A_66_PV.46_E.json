(Qatar) \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 10.20 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 86 \r\n \r\nReport of the International Atomic Energy Agency \r\n \r\n  Note by the Secretary-General transmitting the \r\nreport of the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency (A/66/95) \r\n \r\n  Draft resolution (A/66/L.6) \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I invite \r\nMr. Yukiya Amano, Director General of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency, to introduce the \r\nreport of the Agency for the year 2010.  \r\n Mr. Amano (International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency): Since 11 March, the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency (IAEA) has been working on the very \r\nserious accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear \r\npower plant in Japan. I will therefore begin by \r\nreflecting on that accident and its aftermath, before \r\ntalking about other aspects of our work. \r\n As the Assembly knows, the accident at \r\nFukushima Daiichi was caused by an earthquake and a \r\ntsunami of unprecedented severity, which struck \r\neastern Japan on 11 March. The IAEA has been doing \r\neverything it can to help Japan bring the situation at \r\nthe site under control and to mitigate the consequences \r\nof the accident. The Japanese authorities and the \r\noperator have been working steadily to stabilize the \r\nreactors and are now confident that the so-called cold \r\nshutdown will be achieved by the end of the year. The \r\nIAEA will continue to assist Japan as it tackles the \r\nchallenging work of decontamination and remediation \r\nin the affected areas. \r\n In September, our 151 member States endorsed a \r\n12-point IAEA Action Plan on Nuclear Safety. Key \r\nelements of the Action Plan include an agreement that \r\nall countries with nuclear power programmes will \r\npromptly undertake what have become known as \r\n“stress tests” of their nuclear power plants. The \r\nframework for expert peer reviews by the IAEA of \r\noperational safety at nuclear power plants is being \r\nstrengthened. The effectiveness of national and \r\ninternational emergency preparedness and response \r\narrangements, IAEA safety standards and relevant \r\ninternational conventions will also be reviewed.  \r\n The Action Plan represents a significant step \r\nforward. It is vital that it be fully implemented in all \r\ncountries with nuclear power and that the right lessons \r\nbe learned from the Fukushima Daiichi accident. \r\n I would like to express my gratitude to Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for having convened a high-\r\nlevel meeting on nuclear safety and security in \r\nSeptember and bringing United Nations system \r\norganizations together to collaborate on this issue. \r\nNuclear safety is the responsibility of individual \r\ncountries, but the IAEA — the only international \r\norganization with expertise in all aspects of nuclear \r\nenergy — will play the leading role in shaping a safer \r\nnuclear future throughout the world. \r\n Despite the accident, the IAEA’s latest projection \r\nis that the number of operating nuclear reactors in the \r\nworld will continue to increase steadily in the coming \r\nA/66/PV.46  \r\n \r\n11-57396 2 \r\n \r\ndecades, although less rapidly than was anticipated \r\nbefore the accident. Most of the growth will occur in \r\ncountries that already have operating nuclear power \r\nplants, such as China and India. Many developing \r\ncountries still plan to introduce nuclear power in the \r\ncoming years. The factors contributing to encouraging \r\ninterest in nuclear power have not changed. These \r\nfactors include increasing global demand for energy, \r\nconcerns about climate change, volatile fossil fuel \r\nprices and the security of energy supplies. \r\n Nuclear security remains an extremely important \r\nissue for all States. In September, we marked the tenth \r\nanniversary of the 11 September 2011 terrorist attacks \r\nin the United States. In the wake of those attacks, the \r\nAgency significantly expanded its nuclear security \r\nprogramme to help countries protect nuclear and other \r\nradioactive material and associated facilities against \r\nmalicious acts. \r\n The number of States participating in our Illicit \r\nTrafficking Database programme continues to grow; it \r\nnow stands at 113. In the year to June 2011, \r\n172 incidents were reported to the Database. Fourteen \r\ninvolved activities such as unauthorized possession \r\nand/or attempts to sell or smuggle nuclear material or \r\nradioactive sources. Another 32 incidents involved the \r\ntheft or loss of nuclear or other radioactive material. \r\nIncidents of this nature demonstrate that security \r\nweaknesses continue to exist and must be addressed. I \r\nlook forward to attending the second Nuclear Security \r\nSummit, to be hosted by the Republic of Korea in \r\nMarch. \r\n I note once again that progress towards the entry \r\ninto force of the Amendment to the Convention on the \r\nPhysical Protection of Nuclear Material remains slow, \r\nsix years after its adoption. Adherence to the \r\nAmendment can significantly reduce the risk of nuclear \r\nmaterial falling into the wrong hands. I encourage the \r\nparties to the Convention to work towards accelerating \r\nthe entry into force of the Amendment. \r\n In the area of nuclear applications, one major \r\nsuccess story deserves special attention — the \r\nworldwide eradication of the deadly cattle disease \r\nrinderpest. Rinderpest is, in fact, the first animal \r\ndisease ever to be eliminated, which is a momentous \r\nachievement and of enormous economic benefit to \r\nmany developing countries. The net benefit to Africa \r\nalone is estimated at more than $1 billion per year. \r\nTogether with the Food and Agriculture Organization \r\nof the United Nations, the World Organisation for \r\nAnimal Health, the African Union and other partners, \r\nthe IAEA played an important part in eliminating this \r\ndisease. Our role included making available affordable \r\ndiagnostic techniques and training veterinary staff. \r\n The same technologies used to eliminate \r\nrinderpest are now being successfully applied to \r\ndiagnose and control other transboundary animal \r\ndiseases. In Mongolia, for example, the Agency \r\nassisted in the successful control of a devastating \r\noutbreak of foot-and-mouth disease that threatened the \r\nentire livestock population of about 50 million animals. \r\n The Agency has paid special attention this year to \r\nnuclear techniques related to water. That was the \r\nsubject of our annual scientific forum in September, \r\nwhich was attended by leading scientists and \r\nGovernment officials. Nearly 1 billion people lack \r\naccess to adequate drinking water. The Agency can \r\nhelp countries to undertake comprehensive assessments \r\nof water resources by making available unique \r\ninformation provided through the techniques of isotope \r\nhydrology. I will say more on this subject in a moment. \r\n In September, we celebrated the fiftieth \r\nanniversary of the opening of the IAEA Environment \r\nLaboratories in Monaco. The Laboratories have made \r\nan outstanding contribution to protecting our oceans \r\nand seas by developing advanced analytical methods \r\nand reference materials for assessing marine \r\nradioactivity and pollution. \r\n The IAEA technical cooperation programme \r\nprovides essential support to Member States in every \r\nregion. Through the programme, Member States \r\naddress national development priorities in fields where \r\nnuclear techniques offer advantages over other \r\napproaches or can usefully supplement them. New \r\nresources for the technical cooperation programme as a \r\nwhole rose to $127.7 million in 2010, from \r\n$112.2 million in 2009. Nuclear safety was the largest \r\narea of activity overall, followed by human health, \r\nfood and agriculture. \r\n In September, the General Assembly held a High-\r\nLevel Meeting on non-communicable diseases. IAEA \r\nhuman health projects and technical cooperation \r\nprojects on water management and identification of \r\npollution sources help countries to address \r\nnon-communicable diseases, including cancer, diabetes \r\nand water-borne illnesses. \r\n A/66/PV.46\r\n \r\n3 11-57396 \r\n \r\n In the field of water, I would like to mention a \r\nvery promising technical cooperation project in \r\nEl Salvador, where the Agency has helped to establish \r\na permanent monitoring system to provide early \r\nwarnings of harmful algal blooms. If undetected, they \r\ncan enter the food chain and cause serious, sometimes \r\nfatal, illness. El Salvador’s fishing communities are \r\nbenefiting directly from nuclear technologies that \r\nprovide faster and more accurate warnings of algal \r\nblooms, and make it possible to close selected fishing \r\ngrounds during danger periods. \r\n In Kenya, a drip irrigation project, supported by \r\nthe IAEA, has helped the Maasai people to grow more \r\ncrops for both animal and human consumption. In \r\naddition to conserving precious water resources, the \r\nproject has made it possible for more parents to afford \r\nschooling for their children. \r\n Turning to nuclear verification, I am pleased to \r\nnote that 112 countries have brought into force \r\nadditional protocols to their safeguards agreements \r\nwith the IAEA. That is very encouraging. The \r\nadditional protocol is an essential tool for the Agency \r\nto be able to provide credible assurance not only that \r\ndeclared nuclear material is not being diverted from \r\npeaceful uses, but also that there are no undeclared \r\nnuclear materials and activities in a country. I strongly \r\nhope that the remaining States will conclude additional \r\nprotocols as soon as possible. I also ask the \r\n14 non-nuclear-weapon States parties to the Treaty on \r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons without \r\nsafeguards agreements in force to implement them \r\nwithout delay. \r\n I have continued to report regularly to our Board \r\nof Governors on the implementation of Agency \r\nsafeguards in a number of countries. IAEA reports on \r\nthe implementation of safeguards in Iran have been \r\nsent to the Security Council since 2006. In my recent \r\nreports, I stated that Iran is not providing the necessary \r\ncooperation to enable the Agency to conclude that all \r\nnuclear materials in Iran are used for peaceful \r\nactivities. I urge Iran to take steps towards the full \r\nimplementation of all relevant obligations in order to \r\nestablish international confidence in the exclusively \r\npeaceful nature of its nuclear programme. \r\n In the case of Syria, the Agency recently came to \r\nthe conclusion that it is very likely that a building \r\ndestroyed at the Dair Alzour site in 2007 was a nuclear \r\nreactor that should have been declared to the Agency. \r\nIn June, the IAEA Board of Governors found Syria to \r\nbe in non-compliance with its safeguards obligations. It \r\nreported that non-compliance to the Security Council \r\nand the General Assembly. \r\n The nuclear programme of the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea remains a matter of serious \r\nconcern. As may be known, the Agency has not been \r\nable to implement any safeguards measures in that \r\ncountry since April 2009. Last year’s reports about the \r\nconstruction of a new uranium enrichment facility and \r\na light-water reactor in that country are deeply \r\ntroubling. I continue to urge the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea to fully implement all relevant \r\nresolutions of the IAEA General Conference and the \r\nSecurity Council. \r\n Our efforts to improve the analytical capability \r\nand security of the Agency’s safeguards laboratories \r\nhave made excellent progress. The new extension to \r\nthe Clean Laboratory for Safeguards, near Vienna, was \r\ncompleted on time and slightly under budget, and has \r\nbeen operational for several months. It greatly \r\nimproves the Agency’s ability to independently analyse \r\nenvironmental samples for safeguards. \r\n In September 2000, the IAEA General \r\nConference tasked the Director General with making \r\narrangements to convene a forum, at which participants \r\nfrom the Middle East and other interested parties could \r\nlearn from the experience of nuclear-weapon-free \r\nzones already established in other regions. My \r\nconsultations with member States showed that \r\nconditions are now favourable for the holding of such a \r\nforum. I have therefore decided to convene the forum \r\nin Vienna on 21 and 22 November. It will consider the \r\nrelevance to the Middle East of the experience of \r\nAfrica, the South Pacific, South-East Asia, Central \r\nAsia, and Latin America and the Caribbean in \r\nestablishing nuclear-weapon-free zones. I hope that it \r\nwill be a successful meeting. \r\n The President: I thank Mr. Amano for his \r\nbriefing. \r\n I now give the floor to the representative of Italy \r\nto introduce draft resolution A/66/L.6. \r\n Mr. Ragaglini (Italy): First of all, I wish to thank \r\nDirector General Amano for his report on the activities \r\nof the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in \r\n2010 (see A/66/95) and to express my deep \r\nappreciation for his skilful leadership of the Agency. I \r\nA/66/PV.46  \r\n \r\n11-57396 4 \r\n \r\nalso pay tribute to the efforts of the Agency and its \r\nstaff after the tragic disaster that struck Japan this past \r\nMarch, proving once again the centrality and \r\nfundamental importance of their work. Let me take this \r\nopportunity to renew my solidarity with the Japanese \r\npeople for the suffering caused by the most devastating \r\ntsunami, as well as my admiration for their resilience.  \r\n I take the floor today to introduce, under agenda \r\nitem 86, draft resolution A/66/L.6, entitled “Report of \r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency”, because \r\nItaly was elected Chair of the Agency’s Board of \r\nGovernors for the 2011-2012 period. Indeed, it is a \r\ngreat honour for my country. We look forward to \r\nworking together with the States members of the \r\nAgency, the Director General and his staff in the \r\ncoming months to further strengthen its fulfilment of \r\nits mandate. \r\n Italy is firmly convinced that safety, security and \r\nnuclear safeguards are essential to ensuring the \r\npeaceful use of nuclear energy to protect the health of \r\nthe population and the integrity of the environment. We \r\nadvocate a strong international nuclear regime to \r\nguarantee that commitments and obligations under the \r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \r\n(NPT) are verified through the strict and independent \r\nmonitoring of the Agency. We will continue our \r\ntraditional commitment to the full range of its \r\nactivities, bearing in mind the responsibilities \r\nincumbent upon the Chair of the Board of Governors. \r\n The Fukushima Daiichi disaster has dramatically \r\nunderlined the need to strengthen international \r\ncooperation on nuclear safety. We all know that the \r\neffects of a severe nuclear accident do not stop at \r\nnational borders. Therefore, the ongoing improvement \r\nof nuclear safety must be a common goal for us all. \r\nThere is a growing consensus worldwide towards the \r\nadoption of concrete measures to that end without \r\nfurther delay, and the Agency has a leading role to play \r\nin that endeavour. \r\n We are therefore pleased with the General \r\nConference’s recent adoption of the Action Plan on \r\nNuclear Safety. We are ready to consider new measures \r\nto strengthen the international nuclear safety regime, \r\nand call for universal adherence to all the international \r\nconventions adopted under the auspices of the Agency \r\nthat are crucial to the international safety regime. \r\n Reducing the risk of access to and malicious use \r\nof nuclear material by non-State actors is a shared goal \r\nof the international community. Italy is fully \r\ncommitted to the success of the process of \r\nstrengthening national measures and international \r\ncooperation on nuclear security along the lines agreed \r\nto in the Washington, D.C., communiqué and plan of \r\nwork.  \r\n We strongly support an enhanced role for the \r\nAgency and its nuclear security programme, and we are \r\nparticularly interested in strengthening national \r\ncapacities through advanced training and the \r\ndevelopment of a nuclear security culture. One \r\nconcrete initiative in this area is the first course of the \r\nInternational School on Nuclear Security, inaugurated \r\nin April under the auspices of the Italian Government \r\nand in collaboration with the Agency and the Abdus \r\nSalam International Centre for Theoretical Physics \r\n(ICTP) at its premises in Trieste. As a result of the \r\npositive evaluation of this first course, Italy intends to \r\ndevelop the school further and offer it on a regular \r\nbasis, in cooperation with the Agency and the ICTP \r\nand with the support of other donors. \r\n Strengthening the international safeguards regime \r\nremains one of the shared goals of the Agency’s \r\nmember States. Italy upholds the Agency’s role in \r\nverifying the full compliance of States with their \r\nnon-proliferation obligations in accordance with the \r\ncomprehensive safeguards agreement. That is why we \r\nhope to see the additional protocol universally adopted, \r\nwhich would significantly increase the Agency’s ability \r\nto verify through the agreement the peaceful use of all \r\nnuclear material held by States.  \r\n To achieve a world without weapons of mass \r\ndestruction, every country must shoulder this collective \r\nresponsibility and do its utmost to advance our \r\nnon-proliferation and disarmament agenda. We \r\nstrongly believe that the goals set at the 2010 Review \r\nConference of the Parties to the NPT are achievable, \r\nand we continue to support the efforts of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and the three NPT depositary States to \r\nconvene an international conference in 2012 on the \r\nestablishment of a zone free of nuclear weapons and all \r\nother weapons of mass destruction and their delivery \r\nsystems in the Middle East. \r\n The peaceful use of nuclear energy is still one of \r\nthe Agency’s main goals. We believe that the \r\ndevelopment of safe technology is extremely important \r\nto the improvement of nuclear applications worldwide, \r\nas is addressing global challenges and promoting the \r\n A/66/PV.46\r\n \r\n5 11-57396 \r\n \r\nrelevant Millennium Development Goal through the \r\nadoption of carefully designed technical cooperation \r\nprogrammes. We are committed to fostering the \r\nAgency’s activities in developing nuclear applications \r\naimed at achieving medical and scientific advances in \r\nthe areas of human health, food and agriculture, water \r\nresources and the protection of the environment. \r\nDespite the present international financial situation, \r\nsupport for the Technical Cooperation Fund and the \r\nactivities under it to be promoted by the Agency \r\nremains of key importance. \r\n In Italy’s capacity as Chair of the Agency’s Board \r\nof Governors, allow me to introduce, under agenda \r\nitem 86, the draft resolution “Report of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency”, contained in \r\ndocument A/66/L.6, on behalf of Albania, Argentina, \r\nArmenia, Australia, Austria, Bangladesh, Belarus, \r\nBelgium, Benin, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Botswana, \r\nBrazil, Bulgaria, Burundi, Cameroon, Canada, Chile, \r\nColombia, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Denmark, the \r\nDominican Republic, Egypt, El Salvador, Eritrea, \r\nEstonia, Ethiopia, Fiji, Finland, France, Georgia, \r\nGermany, Greece, Guatemala, Guinea, Hungary, \r\nIceland, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Ireland, Japan, Jordan, \r\nKazakhstan, Kenya, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, \r\nLuxembourg, Madagascar, Malaysia, Malta, Monaco, \r\nMongolia, Montenegro, the Netherlands, New Zealand, \r\nNigeria, Norway, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, \r\nthe Philippines, Poland, Portugal, the Republic of \r\nKorea, the Republic of Moldova, Romania, the Russian \r\nFederation, Senegal, Serbia, Singapore, Slovakia, \r\nSlovenia, Spain, Swaziland, Sweden, Switzerland, \r\nThailand, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, \r\nTonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Turkey, Ukraine, the \r\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, \r\nthe United Republic of Tanzania, the United States of \r\nAmerica, Uruguay and Zambia, as well as on behalf of \r\nItaly. \r\n As in previous years, the consensus text, the \r\nresult of consultations in Vienna, notes with \r\nappreciation the report of the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency; takes note of the resolutions adopted \r\nat the fifty-fifth regular session of the IAEA General \r\nConference held from 19 to 23 September; reaffirms \r\nthe General Assembly’s strong support for the \r\nAgency’s indispensable role in encouraging and \r\nassisting the development and practical application of \r\natomic energy for peaceful uses, in technology transfer \r\nto developing countries and in nuclear safety, \r\nverification and security; and appeals to Member States \r\nto continue to support the Agency’s activities. The draft \r\nresolution is also open to further sponsorship, of \r\ncourse, and it is the hope of the sponsors that it will be \r\nadopted by consensus. \r\n Mr. Vrailas (European Union): I have the honour \r\nto speak on behalf of the European Union (EU) and its \r\nmember States. \r\n We are pleased to support draft resolution \r\nA/66/L.6 on the report (see A/66/95) of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which \r\nagain reaffirms the indispensable role of the Agency \r\nwith regard to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons \r\nand in assisting the development and practical \r\napplication of atomic energy for peaceful uses, as well \r\nas in technology transfer to developing countries and in \r\nnuclear safety, verification and security. \r\n This year has been overshadowed by the tragic \r\nconsequences of the earthquake and tsunami in Japan \r\non 11 March, which led to the accident at the \r\nFukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The accident \r\nat Fukushima has changed the landscape of nuclear \r\nsafety worldwide, and presents a strong challenge to \r\nthe IAEA and the wider international community. The \r\nEU has sought to play its part in meeting this \r\nchallenge. The EU-Japan summit of 28 May signalled \r\nenhanced EU-Japanese cooperation in promoting the \r\nhighest standards of nuclear safety worldwide, working \r\nin particular through the IAEA and the Group of Eight \r\nand Group of 20 processes. \r\n The Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Safety \r\norganized by the IAEA in June, in which the EU took \r\nan active part, began the process of ensuring that we, \r\nthe international community, draw lessons from this \r\naccident and work to implement them in order to \r\nensure the implementation of the highest standards of \r\nnuclear safety globally. The EU welcomes the \r\ndeclaration that emerged from the June meeting, \r\nfollowed by the IAEA’s Action Plan on Nuclear Safety. \r\nWe appreciate the Secretary-General’s high-level \r\nmeeting on nuclear safety, which took place in the \r\nmargins of the General Assembly on 22 September. \r\n International cooperation is crucial to promoting \r\nthe global nuclear safety framework. In the light of the \r\nFukushima accident, the EU is undertaking, as a matter \r\nof priority, a review of the safety of all EU nuclear \r\npower plants on the basis of a comprehensive and \r\nA/66/PV.46  \r\n \r\n11-57396 6 \r\n \r\ntransparent risk and safety assessment, or stress tests. \r\nNeighbouring and other countries have been invited to \r\nparticipate in these tests with the involvement of the \r\nIAEA and other relevant international organizations. In \r\nparallel with the stress tests, the EU will conduct a \r\nreview of the existing European legal and regulatory \r\nframework for the safety of nuclear installations, to be \r\ncompleted by the end of this year. \r\n In 2009, the EU adopted a nuclear safety \r\ndirective, giving binding legal force in all 27 EU \r\nmember States to the main nuclear safety standards. A \r\nsimilar directive was adopted this July on the \r\nresponsible and safe management of spent fuel and \r\nradioactive waste. \r\n The EU remains committed to effective \r\nmultilateral action against the proliferation of weapons \r\nof mass destruction. We therefore welcomed the \r\nconsensus reached at the 2010 Review Conference of \r\nthe Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT). The action plan agreed on, as \r\nwell as the agreement on a process for the \r\nimplementation of the 1995 resolution on the Middle \r\nEast, including a conference to be convened in 2012, \r\ndemonstrated our common resolve not only to uphold \r\nbut also to strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation \r\nregime.  \r\n The EU organized a seminar in Brussels on 6 and \r\n7 July to contribute to the process for the 2012 \r\nconference. The seminar allowed for inclusive \r\nparticipation and for an open and constructive \r\nexchange of views on the creation of a zone free of \r\nweapons of mass destruction in the Middle East. We \r\nnow look forward to the IAEA forum to be convened \r\nby the IAEA Director General, which will take place \r\non 21 and 22 November in Vienna. This spirit of \r\ncooperation on the road to the 2012 conference is \r\nlaudable, and we should all work to maintain it. \r\n The 2010 NPT Review Conference reaffirmed the \r\nrole of the IAEA in verifying and assuring compliance \r\nby States with their safeguards obligations, with a view \r\nto preventing the diversion of nuclear material from \r\npeaceful uses. The EU remains deeply concerned by \r\nthe protracted and serious challenges to the \r\nnon-proliferation regime posed by the Islamic Republic \r\nof Iran, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea \r\nand the Syrian Arab Republic, as reported by the \r\nDirector General of the IAEA. The EU reaffirms its \r\nunderstanding of the role of the Security Council, as \r\nthe final arbiter of international peace and security, in \r\ntaking appropriate action in the event of \r\nnon-compliance with NPT obligations, including \r\nsafeguards agreements. \r\n The Agency’s system of safeguards is a \r\nfundamental component of the nuclear non-proliferation \r\nregime and plays an indispensable role in the \r\nimplementation of the NPT. In that respect, the EU \r\nwould like to express its strongest regret that, during \r\nthe fifty-fifth session of the IAEA General Conference, \r\nno resolution was adopted on strengthening the \r\neffectiveness and improving the efficiency of the \r\nsafeguards system and application of the Model \r\nAdditional Protocol. This was the first session in which \r\nthe resolution on strengthening safeguards was not \r\nadopted by the IAEA’s General Conference. The EU \r\ncalls on the Agency and the member States to work \r\ntogether to ensure that the important issue of \r\nsafeguards is properly addressed at the fifty-sixth \r\nregular session of the General Conference of the IAEA. \r\n The EU reiterates its view that the measures \r\ncontained in the Model Additional Protocol form an \r\nintegral part of the IAEA safeguards system, and that \r\ncomprehensive safeguards agreements, together with \r\nadditional protocols, constitute the current IAEA \r\nverification standard. The EU calls for the \r\nuniversalization of those two essential instruments of \r\nthe IAEA safeguards system without delay. \r\n The EU is of the view that countries considering \r\nor planning to include nuclear power in their energy \r\nstrategies should closely cooperate with the IAEA so as \r\nto ensure that the most stringent legal, operational, \r\nsafety, security and non-proliferation conditions are \r\nmet. The EU remains firmly convinced of the benefits \r\nof multilateral approaches to the nuclear fuel cycle. \r\n In line with the NPT conclusions on this matter, \r\nthe EU welcomes the steps taken to establish an IAEA \r\nlow-enriched uranium bank and reaffirms the EU’s \r\ncommitment to providing financial support for the \r\nendeavour. The financing could comprise up to \r\n€20 million from the Instrument for Stability, plus an \r\nadditional contribution of up to €5 million via a \r\nEuropean Union Common Foreign and Security Policy \r\ndecision. \r\n We face a new era of threats from non-State \r\nactors, particularly terrorists who seek to acquire \r\nweapons of mass destruction and related technology \r\nand materials, one of the potentially most destructive \r\n A/66/PV.46\r\n \r\n7 11-57396 \r\n \r\nrisks to global security. In the light of the ongoing \r\nthreats, the EU is actively supporting the \r\nimplementation of Security Council resolutions 1540 \r\n(2004) and 1887 (2009), as well as a number of other \r\ninternational initiatives.  \r\n Following the successful Nuclear Security \r\nSummit on 13 April 2010 in Washington, D.C., the EU \r\nlooks forward to the follow-up summit in Seoul in \r\nMarch 2012, dedicated to reinforcing the commitments \r\ntowards improving nuclear security worldwide.  \r\n The EU supports the important role played by the \r\nIAEA in advancing the objectives of the Nuclear \r\nSecurity Summit. The EU supports IAEA activities in \r\nthe areas of nuclear security in the framework of the \r\nimplementation of the EU Strategy against the \r\nProliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction. The \r\nEuropean Union is one of the main contributors to the \r\nIAEA’s Nuclear Security Fund through its own \r\ncontributions and through the contributions of \r\nindividual EU member States, with a level of funding \r\nof around €30 million by the end of 2010.  \r\n In that respect, the EU welcomes the fact that, in \r\nthe IAEA’s regular budget, there is an increased \r\nproportion for the funding of nuclear security activities \r\nin the 2012-2013 programme and budget. Effective \r\nphysical protection is of the utmost importance to \r\nprevent nuclear material from falling into the hands of \r\nterrorists or its accidental misuse, and to protect \r\nnuclear facilities against unauthorized use and \r\nmalicious acts. The EU therefore urges all States that \r\nhave not yet done so to become party to the \r\nConvention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear \r\nMaterial and its Amendment. \r\n The EU has also been a strong supporter of the \r\nIAEA technical cooperation programme. We value its \r\nrole in the responsible development of peaceful \r\napplications of nuclear technology in the areas of \r\nhuman health, food and agriculture, water resources, \r\nthe environment and nuclear energy, stressing nuclear \r\nand radiation safety in participating member States. \r\nThe EU greatly values the contribution of technical \r\ncooperation programme projects to the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. \r\n The European Union uses several of its financial \r\ninstruments to support both the IAEA and cooperation \r\nwith third countries in the peaceful uses of nuclear \r\nenergy and technology, with a total amount of at least \r\n€150 million per year. Part of this funding is \r\nimplemented in third countries through the IAEA’s \r\nTechnical Cooperation Fund, to which the EU and its \r\nmember States are the first contributor. \r\n Ms. Sodov (Mongolia): My delegation would like \r\nto thank Mr. Yukiya Amano, Director General of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), for \r\nintroducing the Agency’s report (see A/66/95) and \r\nproviding an update on developments since the report \r\nwas submitted to the General Assembly for its \r\nconsideration. \r\n At the outset, the Mongolian Government would \r\nlike to express once again its deep condolences and \r\nsincere sympathy to the people of Japan and its \r\nGovernment for the tragic loss of human life and \r\nsuffering as a result of the 11 March earthquake and \r\ntsunami. The tragic event was a grave reminder of the \r\nneed to close the existing safety gaps and continuously \r\nincrease the safety and security of nuclear facilities \r\naround the world.  \r\n The IAEA, the only international organization \r\nwith the relevant expertise, must lead the international \r\neffort to strengthen global nuclear safety and security. \r\nAs rightly highlighted in its report, in the weeks \r\nimmediately after the Fukushima accident the IAEA \r\nserved as an international focal point in assisting the \r\nplant operator and the Japanese authorities in \r\novercoming the disastrous consequences of the \r\naccident. It also played an important role in providing \r\nauthenticated information on the situation at and \r\naround Fukushima.  \r\n It should also be pointed out that many member \r\nStates, as well as the Preparatory Commission for the \r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization, \r\nthe World Health Organization and other relevant \r\ninternational organizations worked closely together \r\nduring the critical weeks, demonstrating the \r\neffectiveness of the United Nations one-house \r\napproach to addressing common challenges and needs. \r\n My delegation commends the Agency for \r\nconvening, in June, the Ministerial Conference on \r\nNuclear Safety, which adopted a declaration aimed at \r\nfurther strengthening nuclear safety, emergency \r\npreparedness and protection from radiation of people \r\nand the environment throughout the world. Based on \r\nthe declaration, the IAEA General Conference adopted \r\nan Action Plan on Nuclear Safety that envisions \r\n12 main actions focusing on safety assessment, IAEA \r\npeer reviews, emergency preparedness and response, \r\nA/66/PV.46  \r\n \r\n11-57396 8 \r\n \r\ncapacity-building, communication and information \r\ndissemination, as well as research and development. \r\nMongolia believes that vigorous implementation of the \r\nAction Plan would contribute tangibly to strengthening \r\nthe nuclear safety regime.  \r\n We also believe that the convening, as proposed \r\nby the Government of Japan, of an international \r\nconference to consider the lessons of Fukushima would \r\nalso be practically useful in improving emergency \r\npreparedness and relief. The post-Fukushima \r\nexperience has clearly demonstrated the need to \r\nstrengthen the international liability regime to enable \r\nsufficient compensation for the damage caused to \r\npeople and the environment as a result of such \r\naccidents. \r\n It is an established fact that nuclear safety and \r\nsecurity are a common concern for countries all over \r\nthe world. These days, they are especially important \r\nfor countries like Mongolia, as it embarks on uranium \r\nexploitation and considers adding nuclear power to its \r\nenergy mix. Mongolia is well aware that uranium \r\nexploitation entails great responsibility, including \r\nensuring the physical security of nuclear material at all \r\nstages of the nuclear fuel cycle. It will therefore look to \r\nthe Agency and its international partners for advice and \r\nassistance in the proper exploitation of its uranium \r\nreserves.  \r\n We are now considering conducting a pre-feasibility \r\nstudy with the Agency on whether nuclear power \r\nshould be included in our energy mix. As part of its \r\ninitial measures, the Mongolian Government is also \r\nworking to accede to the Convention on Nuclear Safety \r\nand the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel \r\nManagement and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste \r\nManagement. \r\n Mongolia further commends the IAEA’s central \r\nrole in promoting non-proliferation through safeguards \r\nand verification, and in promoting the transfer of \r\nnuclear knowledge, science and technology to its \r\nmembers. Judging by the IAEA projects in my country, \r\nI can say with confidence that the Agency makes a \r\nformidable contribution to global development efforts \r\nby providing the relevant skills, training and \r\nequipment. I would like to take this opportunity to \r\nthank the IAEA for its crucial assistance to developing \r\ncountries, including my own country, Mongolia. \r\n Last year, Mongolia was designated the eighth \r\nModel Demonstration Site (PMDS) country under the \r\nIAEA Programme of Action for Cancer Therapy \r\n(PACT). As a PMDS, Mongolia is working to develop \r\nthe required radiotherapy capacity to ensure effective \r\nearly detection and treatment of cancer. The \r\nradiotherapy services will soon be broadened by the \r\ninstallation of a linear particle accelerator in our \r\ncapital, Ulaanbaatar. In the framework of its \r\ncooperation with PACT, the Government of Mongolia \r\nhas formulated a general action plan for cancer \r\nprevention and control for 2011 to 2021 and has \r\nadopted a strategic plan for radiotherapy development \r\nfor the same period. The implementation of these \r\npolicies will allow us to address the growing scourge \r\nof cancer more effectively and at the same time to \r\nshare our experience as a PMDS country with others. \r\n Other priority areas of our cooperation with the \r\nAgency include agriculture, food security and overall \r\ncapacity-building. Being an agricultural country, \r\nMongolia attaches great importance to increasing its \r\nagricultural production, especially meat production. \r\nMongolia therefore places special focus on its \r\ncooperation with the Agency in the sustainable \r\nproduction and supply of vaccines and diagnostic kits \r\nto counter transboundary animal diseases. \r\n As a landlocked country with a dry climate, \r\nMongolia welcomed the focus of this year’s Scientific \r\nForum on water and the prospects of its better uses \r\nwith nuclear technologies, which was held during the \r\nIAEA General Conference.  \r\n This year Mongolia has submitted eight project \r\nproposals for the new biennial project cycle \r\n2012-2013, in accordance with its priority needs and \r\nthe Agency’s mandate. It gives me great pleasure to \r\nnote that our commitment to strong cooperation with \r\nthe Agency can be seen from the fact that the IAEA \r\nprojects in Mongolia have the highest implementation \r\nrate in the Asia-Pacific region this year. \r\n As in previous years, my delegation is pleased to \r\nbe a sponsor of the draft resolution on the report of the \r\nIAEA, as contained in document A/66/L.6. \r\n Mr. Tarar (Pakistan): We would like to express \r\nour appreciation for the annual report (see A/66/95) of \r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and \r\nfor the efforts of the Agency and its Director General. \r\nPakistan recently concluded its term as Chair of the \r\nIAEA Board of Governors for 2010-2011, and our \r\nchairmanship underscored the international \r\n A/66/PV.46\r\n \r\n9 11-57396 \r\n \r\ncommunity’s confidence in Pakistan’s contributions to \r\nand role in matters within the Agency’s ambit. \r\n In the 54 years since its establishment, the IAEA \r\nhas emerged as a successful organization in promoting \r\npeaceful uses of nuclear energy, contributing to peace \r\nand security and advancing socio-economic \r\ndevelopment. The Agency’s role has become even \r\nmore important in an increasingly complex and \r\nchallenging international environment. The fast-\r\ngrowing global energy demands, shortages of fossil \r\nfuel reserves and diverse environmental challenges, \r\nalong with safety and security concerns, are likely to \r\nengage the IAEA for the foreseeable future. In \r\ndischarging these functions, it will be important for the \r\nAgency to be seen as an impartial, efficient and \r\nprofessional body — not just a nuclear watchdog. \r\n We agree with the Agency’s post-Fukushima \r\nassessment that nuclear energy will remain a preferable \r\nviable, safe and sustainable alternative power source. \r\nThe events at the Fukushima nuclear plants brought \r\ninto focus the justifiable public anxiety over the \r\nnuclear safety regime. We fully support the IAEA’s role \r\nin leading the global efforts to evaluate and \r\ninstitutionalize the lessons-learned process from the \r\nFukushima event. The Agency’s efforts, including the \r\nconvening of a ministerial conference on nuclear safety \r\nand the adoption of a Nuclear Safety Action Plan, have \r\nbeen both timely and useful. The high-level meeting on \r\nnuclear safety and security, held by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral here in New York in September, also served to \r\ncatalyse international attention to the important issues \r\nof nuclear safety. \r\n The Action Plan prepared by the IAEA and its \r\nmember States provides an important foundation for \r\nstrengthening the nuclear safety framework worldwide. \r\nThe high-level meeting rightly reaffirmed the support \r\nof its participants for the Agency’s leadership role in \r\nthe lessons-learned process and in enabling its member \r\nStates to implement those lessons nationally. \r\n In evolving a strengthened nuclear safety regime, \r\nit is essential to take into account the varied nature of \r\ncountries’ needs and circumstances. The course-\r\ncorrection proposals and modalities should be based on \r\ntechnical and objective assessments. The effective \r\nimplementation of the IAEA Action Plan on Nuclear \r\nSafety will depend in large measure on, inter alia, the \r\ndegree of international assistance and cooperation \r\ngiven to developing countries. We fully endorse the \r\nviews of the Non-Aligned Movement on this vital \r\naspect, and we look forward to working with member \r\nStates in carrying forward an agreed nuclear safety \r\nagenda. \r\n For our part, we have already begun a \r\ncomprehensive safety review of existing power plants \r\nin areas such as site studies, safety systems, emergency \r\npower systems, off-site emergency preparedness, and \r\nso forth. Such safety appraisals will also be applicable \r\nto our future nuclear power plants. We will examine \r\nthe outcome of this review and make modifications as \r\nnecessary. \r\n The IAEA and Pakistan’s Atomic Energy \r\nCommission were launched five decades ago, almost at \r\nthe same time. The two organizations have grown \r\ntogether and have a cooperative and mutually \r\nbeneficial relationship, which has been of immense \r\nvalue to Pakistan.  \r\n We have benefited from the expertise made \r\navailable in the form of expert missions, operational \r\nsafety review teams, assessment of safety significant \r\nevents team missions, and the Agency’s Technical \r\nCooperation Programme. We attach the highest \r\nimportance to the IAEA Technical Cooperation \r\nProgramme and would like to stress the need for \r\nenhanced and assured resource allocation for technical \r\ncooperation activities, technology transfer and training \r\nfacilities for developing countries, inter alia through \r\ngreater involvement of developing countries in the \r\nprogramme’s design and implementation. \r\n Pakistan has long been a strong advocate of \r\nutilizing nuclear technology for peace, progress and \r\nprosperity for all. The revival of the economy and the \r\nsocio-economic development of our people is the \r\nforemost priority of the Government of Pakistan. Safe \r\nand sustainable nuclear energy is essential to \r\nadvancing our development agenda. The Pakistan \r\nAtomic Energy Commission is actively engaged in the \r\napplication of nuclear technology for the socio-economic \r\nuplift of the country, which includes such areas as \r\ncancer diagnosis and treatment, agriculture, food \r\npreservation, water management and industry. But our \r\nmost important task remains harnessing nuclear energy \r\nfor the generation of electrical power. \r\n At present, the share of nuclear power in \r\nPakistan’s electricity mix is rather modest. We wish to \r\nenhance the current level of 750 megawatts (MW) \r\nnuclear-power-generation capacity to 8,800 MW by the \r\nA/66/PV.46  \r\n \r\n11-57396 10 \r\n \r\nyear 2030. This is a challenging but an equally \r\nimportant development imperative that we are \r\ndetermined to pursue. Early this year, the unanimous \r\napproval by the IAEA Board of the C3 and C4 power \r\nplants safeguards agreement reflected the international \r\ncommunity’s recognition of Pakistan’s expertise in the \r\nsafe and secure operation of nuclear power plants. The \r\nconclusion of this safeguards agreement relating to the \r\ntwo power plants, each of which has a 340-MW power-\r\ngeneration capacity, is an important milestone towards \r\nour energy security strategy. \r\n The Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission is \r\ncurrently operating 14 nuclear medicine and oncology \r\nhospitals across the country, while four such hospitals \r\nare under construction. These are still not enough for \r\nour very large population, and we intend to continue to \r\nexpand our capabilities in the public sector to cater to \r\nthe poor and the deserving. \r\n We produce most of the radiopharmaceuticals \r\nrequired domestically and, having recently installed a \r\nfacility for the production of molybdenum-99, are now \r\nin a position to export it. Our agriculture and \r\nbiotechnology centres are also making valuable \r\ncontributions to the agriculture and livestock sectors of \r\nthe country. \r\n In addition, the Pakistan Atomic Energy \r\nCommission has developed a very sound infrastructure \r\nfor addressing various problems related to water-\r\nresource management using isotope techniques. We are \r\ntaking part in the IAEA programme involving the \r\ninter-calibration of standards and are also providing \r\nexpert and analytical services in this field to IAEA \r\nmember States in the region. We have a network of \r\nin-house educational and training institutions that \r\nencompass all major facets of nuclear science and \r\ntechnology. Besides meeting the needs of our own \r\nprogrammes, these institutes are ready to welcome \r\nparticipants from other IAEA member States. \r\n We appreciate the assistance that the IAEA has \r\nprovided through expert services, equipment and \r\nhuman resource development in helping us to establish \r\nand improve all these facilities. This is an area in \r\nwhich IAEA is obligated to foster growth in other \r\ncountries as well, and, with our experience, we can \r\nalso help. \r\n Nuclear security has emerged as an important \r\narea requiring adequate attention and response. While \r\nwe support the international focus on and efforts to \r\nadvance the objectives of nuclear security, we share the \r\nIAEA view that responsibility for nuclear security rests \r\nentirely with each State. \r\n At the international level, the IAEA has the \r\nleading and central role in evolving guidelines, \r\nrecommendations, codes and guidance documents in \r\nthe area of nuclear security. Given its mandate, \r\ntechnical competence and wide membership, the IAEA \r\nis a unique platform for its member States to consider \r\nproposals for reviewing and strengthening the \r\ninternational framework on nuclear security. \r\n Ms. King (Australia), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n In recent years, a number of initiatives and \r\nactivities have sprung up globally to promote the \r\nnuclear security agenda, often with overlapping work. \r\nWe fully share the concerns of the IAEA over the \r\ncontinuing duplication of nuclear-security-related \r\nactivities. We wish to reaffirm that the IAEA has the \r\nunique role, authority, competency and legitimacy to \r\nlead and coordinate policy, operational activities and \r\nassistance provision in the field of nuclear security. \r\n Similarly, it would be counterproductive, both \r\nfinancially and politically, to duplicate nuclear-\r\nsecurity-related activities, particularly in the design and \r\ndevelopment of parallel guidelines, recommendations, \r\nstandards and guidance documents in various areas \r\nrelated to nuclear security. \r\n Given the distinct nature, character and \r\nimplementation structures of the IAEA for nuclear \r\nsafety and nuclear security, we would advise against \r\nthe pursuit of a single series of standards in the areas of \r\nnuclear safety and security. These two areas have \r\ndivergent philosophies, causes, legal instruments and \r\noperational requirements, although the two may share a \r\ndegree of common risks. \r\n Pakistan has taken several legislative, \r\norganizational and administrative steps to augment the \r\nsafety and security of our nuclear installations, \r\nfacilities, materials and regulatory framework. Our \r\nNuclear Regulatory Authority (PNRA) has completed \r\n10 years of its professional work as an effective \r\noverseer. The Authority has grown rapidly in the last \r\ndecade, establishing itself as a strong, independent and \r\ncredible overseer. \r\n The PNRA has augmented its regulatory \r\ninfrastructure and expanded the scope of its regulatory \r\n A/66/PV.46\r\n \r\n11 11-57396 \r\n \r\nprocesses. It has also achieved important milestones, \r\nthat is, from the regulatory oversight of nuclear \r\nmaterials and equipment to the management of \r\nradioactive sources. In doing so, the PNRA has \r\nfollowed international standards and practices while \r\nmaintaining very close links with the IAEA, as both a \r\nrecipient and a giver. \r\n The professional approach with which the PNRA \r\nhas executed the nuclear security action plan in \r\nPakistan has won it wide appreciation among its global \r\npeers. It is now implementing the second phase of the \r\nplan, in collaboration with the IAEA. In addition, we \r\nhave participated for several years now in the IAEA \r\nIllicit Trafficking Database. \r\n The global non-proliferation architecture has \r\nwitnessed major transformations in recent years. We \r\nhave seen trends and policies that have dealt major \r\nblows to the non-proliferation regime. Policies and \r\npractices based on commercial and political \r\nconsiderations have eroded the sanctity of the long-\r\nstanding norms and legal instruments that underpin the \r\nnon-proliferation regime. \r\n Pakistan believes in an equitable, non-discriminatory \r\nand criteria-based approach to advancing the universally \r\nshared goals of non-proliferation and the promotion of \r\npeaceful uses of nuclear energy. We also hope that \r\nconsiderations of nuclear safety and nuclear security \r\nwould facilitate, not hinder, the pursuit of peaceful \r\nuses of nuclear energy for advancing the development \r\nagenda and offsetting environmental degradation. \r\n Mr. Gupta (India): My delegation thanks the \r\nDirector General of the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency (IAEA) for his statement, which provided \r\nadditional information on the main developments in the \r\nactivities of the Agency for 2010. We also commend \r\nthe IAEA for its 2010 report (see A/66/95), which \r\nunderscores the central role of the Agency in \r\npromoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. India \r\nparticipated in the high-level meeting on nuclear safety \r\nand security called for by the Secretary-General, held \r\nin New York on 22 September. \r\n We are considering worldwide nuclear-related \r\ndevelopments in 2010 against the backdrop of the \r\nseries of serious accidents that occurred in March 2011 \r\nat several installations at the Fukushima Daiichi \r\nnuclear power plants in Japan following a devastating \r\nearthquake and the resulting tsunami. \r\n The Fukushima nuclear incident attracted \r\nworldwide attention and has raised concerns about \r\nnuclear safety in the face of natural calamities of a \r\nparticularly large magnitude. We are convinced that the \r\nworld nuclear community will rise to the occasion and \r\ntake all necessary measures to assuage the concerns of \r\nthe public at large about the safety of nuclear power \r\nplants. It is imperative that Member States join hands \r\nto strengthen the IAEA, which has a leading role in \r\nchannelling global efforts on nuclear safety. India \r\nsupports the IAEA Action Plan on Nuclear Safety, \r\nendorsed by the General Conference on 22 September. \r\n The role of nuclear power as a clean source of \r\nenergy that is essential to meet growing energy needs \r\nand to address concerns about climate change must not \r\nbe undermined. Nuclear safety should be seen not as a \r\nstatic but as a continuously evolving process. The \r\nAgency must play an important role, in coordination \r\nwith all relevant stakeholders, to further strengthen it. \r\nAt this juncture, it is imperative for the Agency to take \r\nall the necessary measures to allay the apprehensions \r\nof the public and Member States about the safety of \r\nnuclear power plants, taking into account current \r\nadvances in design and technology. We encourage the \r\nAgency to continue supporting all activities related to \r\nthe promotion of nuclear power. \r\n India views nuclear energy as an essential \r\nelement of its national energy basket. We are \r\ncommitted to taking forward our three-stage nuclear \r\nprogramme based on a closed fuel cycle. We envisage a \r\nmajor expansion of nuclear energy in the coming \r\ndecades, reaching 20,000 megawatts (MW) by 2020 \r\nand projected to grow to 60,000 MW by 2030. \r\n Our nuclear safety track record has been \r\nimpeccable in over 345 reactor-years of operation, but \r\nwe recognize the importance of continuous \r\nimprovement and innovation in our nuclear safety \r\nstandards and practices covering the entire range of \r\nactivities — siting, design, construction, operation and \r\nup-grading. \r\n The Government of India has repeatedly \r\nunderscored that the safety of our nuclear plants is a \r\nmatter of the highest priority. The Government has \r\nundertaken a number of measures. They include the \r\nintroduction of a bill in Parliament to change the \r\nfunctional status of India’s Atomic Energy Regulatory \r\nBoard to a de jure independent nuclear regulatory \r\nauthority. Six safety review committees have looked \r\nA/66/PV.46  \r\n \r\n11-57396 12 \r\n \r\ninto various aspects of nuclear safety and, while \r\ndetailed reviews are being evaluated, certain enhanced \r\nsafety measures are already being implemented. India \r\nwill invite the IAEA operational safety review teams to \r\nassist in Indian safety reviews and audits. All reactors, \r\nwhether indigenous or imported, will without \r\nexception meet the enhanced safety standards.  \r\n Safety evaluation reports and follow-up measures \r\nare being put in the public domain so as to enhance \r\ntransparency and boost public confidence. There is \r\nincreased focus on emergency preparedness and \r\nresponse to possible nuclear accidents that are beyond \r\ndesign-basis accidents. India’s National Disaster \r\nManagement Authority has drawn up a document, \r\nentitled “Management of Nuclear and Radiological \r\nEmergencies”, which provides a holistic and integrated \r\napproach to disaster management, covering all its \r\ncomponents — prevention, mitigation, preparedness, \r\ncompliance with regulatory requirements, capacity \r\ndevelopment, response, relief, recovery, rehabilitation \r\nand reconstruction. \r\n India’s nuclear programme is oriented towards \r\nmaximizing the energy potential of available uranium \r\nresources and the utilization of the large thorium \r\nreserve. We believe that available global uranium \r\nresources cannot sustain the projected expansion of \r\nnuclear power without adopting the closed fuel-cycle \r\napproach. We encourage the Agency to further engage \r\nitself in the thorium fuel cycle. \r\n We welcome the inclusion of activities related to \r\nnuclear reactor technology development. My \r\ndelegation fully supports the activities of the Agency \r\nundertaken to stimulate innovation in nuclear power \r\nthrough technical working groups for different reactor \r\ntechnologies, for small- and medium-sized reactors, \r\nand for non-electric applications. The coordinated \r\nresearch projects organized by the Agency provide an \r\nexcellent forum for increasing understanding and the \r\nfurther development of technology. We welcome the \r\nrelease in 2010 of an updated version of its Advanced \r\nReactor Information System, containing \r\ncomprehensive information on all advanced reactor \r\ndesigns and concepts. \r\n India has been associated with the International \r\nProject on Innovative Nuclear Reactors and Fuel \r\nCycles since its inception. We have contributed \r\nsignificantly to its progress and believe that the \r\nprogramme has great potential to make nuclear energy \r\naccessible in a safe and sustainable manner, \r\nparticularly to new entrants embarking on that path. \r\n India attaches great importance to the Agency’s \r\nwork in the fields of nuclear science. We contribute to \r\nthose activities through participation in the technical \r\nmeetings and coordinated research projects, and we \r\nalso support the Agency’s programme in nuclear \r\nfusion. India makes a contribution to the International \r\nThermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) \r\nprogramme by providing special hardware items and \r\nspecialized expertise. In 2010, the construction of a \r\nlaboratory building for ITER-India was nearly \r\ncompleted. \r\n My delegation is of the view that the Agency’s \r\nwork programme and achievements in the area of \r\nnuclear applications are of significance and special \r\nvalue in meeting the needs of developing countries. \r\nActivities in the spheres of food and agriculture, \r\nhuman health and nutrition and water resources, among \r\nothers, are notable in that connection.  \r\n Experts from India regularly participate in all \r\nthose programmes and provide support to the Agency. \r\nThe Bhabhatron telecobalt unit donated by the \r\nGovernment of India to Vietnam through the IAEA \r\nProgramme of Action for Cancer Therapy was \r\nsuccessfully commissioned in 2010. The installation of \r\nanother Bhabhatron unit in Sri Lanka, donated through \r\na similar arrangement, is currently in progress. Indian \r\nexperts are providing full support to Sri Lanka in the \r\nconstruction, installation and commissioning of the \r\nfacility and in training the technical staff. Our \r\ndelegation commends the Agency for its activities \r\nrelated to nuclear knowledge management and \r\ncapacity-building in member States. In that context, we \r\nare pleased to note the designation of St. John’s \r\nResearch Institute, in Bengaluru, as the first IAEA \r\nCollaborating Centre for Nutrition. \r\n India supports the work of the IAEA. That is why \r\nwe have sponsored draft resolution A/66/L.6, on the \r\nReport of the International Atomic Energy Agency. \r\n Ms. Camejo (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): Cuba \r\nwelcomes and supports the important role of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The \r\napplication of nuclear techniques contributes to \r\nmitigating soil deterioration, desertification, warming \r\nof the atmosphere and other natural phenomena that \r\naffect the production of food and the life of humankind \r\non Earth. \r\n A/66/PV.46\r\n \r\n13 11-57396 \r\n \r\n We attach high priority to cooperation among \r\ndeveloping countries. In that regard, Cuba has actively \r\nparticipated throughout the 26 years since the \r\nestablishment of the Regional Cooperative Agreement \r\nfor the Promotion of Nuclear Science and Technology \r\nin Latin America and the Caribbean (ARCAL). Within \r\nthat context, the countries of our region and the \r\nsecretariat of the IAEA have achieved significant \r\nresults, in particular in bringing about the strategic \r\npartnership set up between ARCAL and the Agency. \r\n Furthermore, our participation in the Ibero-American \r\nForum of Radiological and Nuclear Regulatory \r\nAgencies (FORO) has contributed to the goal of \r\nmaintaining a high level of radiological, nuclear and \r\nphysical security in the member countries and, by \r\nextension, throughout the entire Ibero-American \r\nregion. The Forum is an association comprising the \r\nregulatory agencies of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Cuba, \r\nMexico, Peru, Spain and Uruguay, and has worked \r\nhard in key new areas of radiological and nuclear \r\nsecurity. It has shared knowledge and information \r\namong the regulatory bodies through the \r\nIbero-American network, whose intrinsic value we \r\nhope to promote. Cuba is pleased that, under its \r\npresidency next year, we will celebrate FORO’s \r\nfifteenth anniversary.  \r\n The technical cooperation pillar of the IAEA \r\nshould be strengthened and should unconditionally \r\nreceive the resources that it needs, in accordance with \r\nits priority status. Our commitment to technical \r\ncooperation is strong, as the following examples, \r\namong others, demonstrate. By 2010, we had \r\nimplemented 77 per cent of a technical cooperation \r\nproject, maintaining the high level of implementation \r\nthat Cuba has historically shown. However, that was \r\nslightly lower than in other years, owing to the effects \r\nof the blockade that the United States Government \r\nmaintains against our people. \r\n Seven foreigners have received grants for \r\nscientific visits. We undertook more than 50 expert \r\nmissions, of which nine were for technical meetings, \r\n23 for regional projects and 18 within the framework \r\nof ARCAL. We took part in 20 ARCAL projects, \r\nmeeting 100 per cent of the commitments made by \r\nCuba under that programme. The first four meetings of \r\nARCAL were held in Cuba as a lead country for such \r\nprojects. \r\n Within the context of ARCAL, we organized \r\n20 courses and workshops, eight cooperation meetings \r\nand 18 expert missions, and took part in ordinary and \r\nextraordinary meetings of its technical and political \r\nbodies. Moreover, we participated in six regional \r\nprojects on radiation protection. Our country also \r\nparticipated extensively in joint research projects. In \r\n2010, Cuban researchers were included in 15 research \r\ncontracts under those programmes. \r\n Cuba has met its financial commitments to the \r\nIAEA Technical Cooperation Fund, including by \r\ncontributing 100 per cent of expenses for national \r\nparticipation. \r\n While underscoring the important role of the \r\nIAEA and its links with the United Nations system, in \r\nparticular the disarmament machinery, we take this \r\nopportunity to reiterate that our joint efforts must \r\ncontinue in order to uphold nuclear disarmament as the \r\nhighest priority, given the grave threat that the mere \r\nexistence of more than 22,000 nuclear warheads and \r\nthe military doctrines and strategies that perpetuate \r\ntheir possession and use poses to international peace \r\nand security and the survival of humankind.  \r\n The economic, trade and financial blockade \r\nimposed by the Government of the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba for more than 50 years also \r\naffects the activities of the IAEA in our country and \r\ncontravenes the Agency’s statute. Since December \r\n2010, the blockade has caused my country economic \r\nlosses of more than $975 billion, at the current value of \r\nthat currency.  \r\n Owing to the blockade, the IAEA has had \r\ndifficulties in obtaining specialized equipment for \r\nprojects in Cuba, since American companies, or those \r\nthat work with capital from that country, cannot sell \r\nsuch equipment for use in Cuba without possible \r\nsanctions. In addition, our citizens face difficulties in \r\nparticipating in training organized in the United States. \r\nThe blockade also affects the implementation of \r\nprojects on fighting cancer, which is one of the IAEA’s \r\npriorities.  \r\n While denouncing once again the unjust and \r\ncriminal blockade, condemned in this very Hall only a \r\nfew days ago by the overwhelming majority of United \r\nNations Members (see A/66/PV.41), Cuba nevertheless \r\nacknowledges the ongoing efforts of the secretariat of \r\nthe IAEA to seek alternatives and solutions to that \r\nreality. We recognize the efforts of the IAEA to \r\nA/66/PV.46  \r\n \r\n11-57396 14 \r\n \r\nstrengthen radiation security, transportation, \r\nradioactive waste management and emergency \r\npreparedness in countries as a guarantor of safe use of \r\nradioactive sources. \r\n Cuba devotes significant human resources and \r\nmaterials to nuclear safety. It invests in those areas in \r\nLatin America and the Caribbean, including by \r\norganizing regional activities and contributing to \r\nradiation protection experts and services. As a member \r\nof the Ibero-American Forum of Radiological and \r\nNuclear Regulatory Agencies, Cuba takes an active \r\npart in medical projects. \r\n The serious nuclear accident that took place in \r\nJapan as a result of the huge earthquake and tsunami in \r\nthat country showed that there is still much to learn in \r\nthe nuclear safety area. We should step up our efforts \r\ntowards greater security in the face of natural disasters. \r\nCuba attaches special importance to what was agreed \r\nin the declaration of the Ministerial Conference on \r\nNuclear Safety, held in June, and the Action Plan on \r\nNuclear Safety adopted at the fifty-fifth General \r\nConference. \r\n We reaffirm the need to strengthen the \r\ninternational nuclear regime, for which we place the \r\nprimary responsibility on nuclear-weapon States, and \r\nurge that the IAEA be granted the central role in \r\npromoting and coordinating international efforts and \r\ncooperation, so as to strengthen global nuclear security. \r\n Cuba is one of the small group of countries \r\ncertified by the IAEA as being in strict compliance \r\nwith its safeguards commitments. That confirms that \r\nwe are a country that has no undeclared nuclear \r\nmaterials or activities. We attach great importance to \r\nthe sensitive issue of safeguards and to the impartial \r\nand professional action of the IAEA secretariat in the \r\nactivities that it promotes in that area. We have \r\nrepeatedly criticized the manipulation and \r\npoliticization of the IAEA for political purposes, as \r\nwell as the double standards that are unfortunately \r\ncommon in its analyses. As activities in that area are \r\nthe exclusive province of the IAEA, we reiterate our \r\nrejection of any of its decisions in which the Security \r\nCouncil has been involved. \r\n We reaffirm that verification activities must, first \r\nand foremost, respect the sovereignty and national \r\ninterests of member States. We urge the IAEA \r\nsecretariat to continue working to create a climate of \r\nimpartiality, trust, understanding and transparency, \r\nbased on objectivity and truth, which will help to \r\nresolve specific cases involving compliance with \r\nsafeguards agreements being considered by the Board \r\nof Governors and the IAEA General Conference. In \r\nthat regard, we underline the need to respect the \r\ninalienable right of all States to the use of nuclear \r\nenergy for peaceful purposes. \r\n We confirm our support for the denuclearization \r\nof the Korean peninsula and for a solution negotiated \r\nby all parties involved.  \r\n We also reiterate our support for the \r\nestablishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the \r\nMiddle East. To achieve that goal, Israel must \r\nimmediately and unconditionally accede to the NPT \r\nand submit its nuclear installations to the \r\ncomprehensive safeguards regime of the IAEA. \r\n We are pleased that Finland has been chosen as \r\nfacilitator and host Government for next year’s \r\nconference on the establishment of a zone free of \r\nnuclear weapons and other weapons of mass \r\ndestruction in the Middle East, which we hope will \r\nproduce concrete proposals for achieving that goal. \r\n I would like to conclude by stressing that we all \r\nshare a responsibility to bequeath a safer world to \r\nfuture generations. That is why nuclear disarmament \r\ncannot continue to be a goal that is constantly \r\npostponed and subjected to conditions. Cuba will stand \r\nfirm in the struggle for a better world that is free of \r\nnuclear weapons. \r\n Mr. Wang Min (China) (spoke in Chinese): The \r\nChinese delegation welcomes the report of Mr. Yukiya \r\nAmano, Director General of the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency (IAEA), on the work of the Agency. \r\n Over the past year, the Agency carried out a great \r\ndeal of work in accordance with its statutory mandate. \r\nIn the aftermath of Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident \r\nlast March, the Agency has played an important role in \r\ncommunicating accident information to member States \r\nand in assisting Japan with accident response. In June, \r\nthe Agency convened the Ministerial Conference on \r\nNuclear Safety, which resulted in the adoption of a \r\nministerial declaration and the consolidation of \r\ninternational consensus on nuclear safety. The Agency \r\ndeveloped a comprehensive Action Plan on Nuclear \r\nSafety, which sets out concrete nuclear safety \r\nrecommendations.  \r\n A/66/PV.46\r\n \r\n15 11-57396 \r\n \r\n China believes that the Agency’s efforts are of \r\ngreat importance in improving international nuclear \r\nsafety and emergency response performance, \r\npromoting relevant international cooperation and \r\nsafeguarding the safe and sustainable development of \r\nglobal nuclear energy. \r\n At the same time, through its Technical \r\nCooperation Programme, the IAEA has provided \r\nguidance to member States for the development of \r\nnuclear power projects and promoted the application of \r\nnuclear technology in a range of areas, such as human \r\nhealth, medical services, food and agriculture, and \r\nenvironmental protection. The Agency has actively \r\nassisted member States in strengthening their nuclear \r\nsecurity and safety capabilities and provided technical \r\nsupport concerning the safe operation of nuclear power \r\nplants. The IAEA has made continuous efforts to \r\npromote the universality of the comprehensive \r\nsafeguards agreements and the additional protocol, and \r\nhas earnestly performed its safeguards function. China \r\nis glad to see that the work of the Agency in those \r\nareas has been widely recognized and supported by \r\nmember States. \r\n Today, nuclear energy is playing an irreplaceable \r\nrole in safeguarding nuclear security, promoting \r\neconomic development and combating climate change. \r\nIn its nuclear energy development activities, China \r\nalways adheres to the principle of safety first. China \r\nhas established a fairly comprehensive legal framework \r\nand system of standards on nuclear safety and security, \r\nput in place an independent and effective supervisory \r\nand regulatory framework, set up a comprehensive \r\nemergency response mechanism and maintained a good \r\nsafety record in general. In order to enhance nuclear \r\nsafety, China has always supported and actively \r\nparticipated in relevant international and regional \r\nexchanges and cooperation, and has also introduced \r\nand applied advanced nuclear power technologies. \r\n China also attaches great importance to nuclear \r\nsecurity capacity-building, and supports and actively \r\nparticipates in relevant international cooperation \r\ninitiatives. China ratified the Amendment to the \r\nConvention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear \r\nMaterial and the International Convention for the \r\nSuppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. Currently, \r\nChina is working with interested countries to establish \r\na centre of excellence for nuclear security in China.  \r\n China supports the Agency’s central role in \r\nnuclear security and has decided to contribute \r\n$200,000 to its Nuclear Security Fund in order to \r\nenhance the nuclear security capability of the Asia-\r\nPacific region. \r\n At the same time, China strictly fulfils its \r\nsafeguards obligations and actively supports the \r\nAgency’s efforts to improve its verification capabilities \r\nand to promote the effectiveness and the universality of \r\nthe international safeguards regime.  \r\n China supports the Agency’s efforts to pursue its \r\nTechnical Cooperation Programme and to promote the \r\ndevelopment of nuclear power and the application of \r\nnuclear technology. China is ready to its utmost to \r\nprovide, through the Agency, assistance to other \r\ncountries by sharing its accumulated experience in \r\ndeveloping its own nuclear energy. \r\n The IAEA has been shouldering important \r\nresponsibilities in promoting the peaceful uses of \r\nnuclear energy and preventing nuclear weapons \r\nproliferation. In facing the new nuclear safety and \r\nsecurity situation after the Fukushima nuclear accident, \r\nthe Agency should further strengthen its leading role in \r\nenhancing nuclear safety and promoting relevant \r\ninternational cooperation. It is China’s hope that the \r\nAgency will give priority to the following aspects. \r\n First, the Agency should take further stock of the \r\nexperiences and lessons of the Fukushima nuclear \r\naccident, help member States to enhance nuclear safety \r\nand emergency response capabilities, and promote the \r\nimplementation of the IAEA Action Plan on Nuclear \r\nSafety, with a view to restoring public confidence in \r\nnuclear energy.  \r\n Secondly, it should increase technical assistance \r\nto developing countries, improve the national nuclear \r\ninfrastructure of newcomer countries and promote the \r\nsafe, secure and sustainable development of nuclear \r\nenergy.  \r\n Thirdly, it should strengthen the nuclear \r\nsafeguards regime and effectively prevent nuclear \r\nweapons proliferation.  \r\n Fourthly, it should maintain an objective and \r\nimpartial stand on sensitive and hot-button nuclear \r\nissues and play a constructive role in appropriately \r\nresolving those issues with diplomatic efforts. \r\nA/66/PV.46  \r\n \r\n11-57396 16 \r\n \r\n Mr. Camp (United States of America): The \r\nUnited States looks forward to the adoption of the draft \r\nresolution (A/66/L.6) of the General Assembly on the \r\nreport (see A/66/95) of the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency (IAEA). The United States \r\nco-sponsored the draft resolution as an expression of \r\nits strong support for the Agency and its critical role in \r\naccelerating and enlarging the contributions of atomic \r\nenergy to peace, health and prosperity throughout the \r\nworld. \r\n As Secretary Clinton noted during her remarks to \r\nthe high-level meeting on nuclear safety and security, \r\nconvened by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon: “This \r\nyear the International Atomic Energy Agency has, \r\nagain, proven itself to be an indispensable forum for \r\nmonitoring and supporting the peaceful nuclear activity \r\nof countries.” \r\n As an example of our enduring and wide-ranging \r\nsupport for the Agency, the United States has made \r\nsignificant extrabudgetary contributions to Agency \r\nprogrammes related to nuclear safeguards, nuclear \r\nsafety, nuclear security and technical cooperation. In \r\naddition, President Obama’s IAEA Peaceful Uses \r\nInitiative, announced by Secretary Clinton at the 2010 \r\nReview Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, aims to \r\nhighlight and strengthen the Agency’s role in \r\nincreasing access to the benefits of peaceful nuclear \r\ntechnologies, including in the areas of human health, \r\nfood security, water resources management and nuclear \r\npower. The United States pledged $50 million in \r\nextrabudgetary funding to the Peaceful Uses Initiative \r\nover five years, and we urge other Member States to \r\njoin in this endeavour and to match that amount. \r\n The United States would also like to express its \r\nsincere appreciation to Director General Amano for his \r\nleadership and for his report to the General Assembly. \r\nWe look forward to continuing to work with the \r\nDirector General, the Agency secretariat and all \r\nmember States to advance the important work of the \r\nIAEA in the years ahead. The United States remains \r\ncommitted to ensuring that the Agency has the \r\nresources and authorities it needs to address the \r\nnumerous and growing challenges in confronts. \r\n Mr. Tsymbaliuk (Ukraine): The date of 26 April \r\n2011 marked a quarter of a century since the day when \r\nthe catastrophe at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant \r\ndispelled the illusions of today’s world about the \r\ncomplete safety of the peaceful use of nuclear energy. \r\nConsidering this event through a quarter of a century’s \r\nhistory, it is obvious that a responsible and holistic \r\napproach to the atom for peace is the only precondition \r\nfor a safe world in the future. \r\n My country’s strategy to address the lingering \r\nafter-effects of the Chernobyl catastrophe is aimed at \r\nfostering the region’s long-term development and \r\nproviding people with the support they need to lead \r\nsafe and healthy lives. \r\n In commemoration of the twenty-fifth \r\nanniversary of the Chernobyl catastrophe, the President \r\nand the Government of Ukraine organized two \r\nimportant international events in Kyiv in 2011: the \r\nKyiv Summit for the Safe and Innovative Use of \r\nNuclear Energy, and an international scientific \r\nconference on the theme “Twenty-five years after the \r\nChernobyl accident — safety for the future”.  \r\n We believe that one of the outcomes of the Kyiv \r\nSummit was the unanimous recognition by its \r\nparticipants of the need to secure an adequate level of \r\nnuclear safety as the key priority throughout each and \r\nevery stage of nuclear energy production. We would \r\nlike to express our appreciation for the participation of \r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and \r\nits Director General in both the Kyiv Summit and the \r\nscientific conference, as well as for the support the \r\nAgency continues to provide to Ukraine for mitigation \r\nof the consequences of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster. \r\n The Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident in \r\n1986 triggered not only the revision of international \r\nnuclear safety standards, but the creation of numerous \r\ninternational instruments to ensure both the highest \r\nlevel of nuclear waste and radiation safety worldwide \r\nand the relevant system of emergency preparedness and \r\nresponse.  \r\n In 2011 those instruments were put into test. This \r\nyear was difficult for the Agency because of the \r\nnuclear accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear \r\npower plant. We believe that given its unique \r\ncapabilities and expertise, the Agency has a leading \r\nrole to play in any nuclear-related accident or \r\nemergency and that its on-site involvement is vital in \r\naddressing situations like the one at Fukushima. \r\n Based on the lessons already learned from the \r\naccident, we in Ukraine have conducted a targeted \r\nreassessment of the safety of all our nuclear power \r\n A/66/PV.46\r\n \r\n17 11-57396 \r\n \r\nunits in operation. We have introduced measures to \r\nreinforce the independent position of the national \r\nnuclear regulatory authority and, as the top priority, \r\nlaunched a comprehensive review of the national \r\nnuclear regulatory framework. We have also joined the \r\nEuropean Union stress tests and the relevant peer \r\nreview process. \r\n We welcome the outcome of the Ministerial \r\nConference on Nuclear Safety held in June in Vienna. \r\nWe expected the IAEA Action Plan on Nuclear Safety \r\nrequested by the Ministerial Conference to be more \r\nambitious in terms of peer review missions and \r\ntransparency. But even as a common denominator of \r\nthe current positions of States, we do note some \r\nimportant steps in the Plan that may strengthen peer \r\nreview services and mechanisms in future. We consider \r\nthose elements to have particular practical value. \r\n While responsibility for nuclear safety rests with \r\neach member State, we believe that the IAEA Safety \r\nFundamentals and Safety Requirements should \r\nconstitute the minimum obligatory basis for States that \r\nhave active civil nuclear programmes with working \r\nnuclear power plants and research reactors. It is clear \r\nthat the existing international treaty basis concerning \r\nreaction to nuclear disasters requires improvement. We \r\nhave before us some new proposals by States to \r\nimprove those instruments, as well as the Nuclear \r\nSafety Convention. We believe that they are worthy of \r\nour further consideration. \r\n Developments in Japan have resulted in \r\nwidespread concern about the safety of nuclear power \r\nplants worldwide and have led to deliberations and \r\nconcerns about the feasibility of nuclear energy as a \r\nsource of power generation. It is clear that there are \r\nmany lessons to be learned from the Fukushima \r\naccident. In that connection, we welcome the \r\nannouncement by the Government of Japan of plans to \r\nhold in 2012, in cooperation with the IAEA, an \r\ninternational conference on nuclear safety, based on the \r\nfindings of the investigation of the nuclear power \r\naccidents. \r\n We strongly support the Agency’s activities \r\naimed at improving nuclear, radiation, transport and \r\nwaste safety worldwide. Ukraine reaffirms its view that \r\nthe responsibility for nuclear security rests with each \r\nindividual State. All States have the responsibility to \r\nestablish appropriate systems and take necessary \r\nmeasures to prevent, detect and respond to malicious \r\nacts involving nuclear material.  \r\n Ukraine supports the implementation of the IAEA \r\nNuclear Security Plan for 2010-2013. We acknowledge \r\nthe progress achieved by the Agency in improving \r\ncontrol over radioactive sources. In 2010 Ukraine \r\nannounced its decision to get rid of all stocks of highly \r\nenriched uranium by the time of the next Nuclear \r\nSecurity Summit, while our partners will provide \r\nnecessary technical and financial assistance to support \r\nthis effort. \r\n In that connection, we note with concern that six \r\nyears after the Amendment to the Convention on the \r\nPhysical Protection of Nuclear Material was adopted \r\nby consensus, only 49 of the 145 parties to the \r\nConvention have adhered to the Amendment. \r\nAdherence to the international legal instruments \r\nrelevant to nuclear security continues to increase, but \r\nat a slow pace. Ukraine calls upon all States that have \r\nnot yet done so to adhere to the Amendment as soon as \r\npossible and to act in accordance with the objective \r\nand purpose of the Amendment pending its entry into \r\nforce. \r\n Ukraine highly values the IAEA role in nuclear \r\nsecurity competence development. We pay \r\nconsiderable attention to the issue at the national level. \r\nWith the graduation of another 14 nuclear security \r\nengineers from the Sevastopol National University of \r\nNuclear Energy and Technology we have reached an \r\nimportant milestone. We commend the Agency for its \r\ninvaluable support to us in developing training and \r\neducation facilities for nuclear security purposes at the \r\nSevastopol National University, which became the \r\nAgency’s earliest partner in establishing nuclear \r\nsecurity education. We confirm our willingness to \r\ncontribute to the implementation of the IAEA nuclear \r\nsecurity education programmes. \r\n Ukraine also appreciates the considerable work \r\ndone by the Agency in strengthening nuclear security \r\nmeasures in connection with major public events, \r\nparticularly the support that is being consistently \r\nprovided to Ukraine and Poland in preparation for the \r\n2012 Union of European Football Associations \r\nEuropean Football Championship. \r\n Ukraine reaffirms the Agency’s role in verifying \r\nand ensuring compliance by States with their \r\nsafeguards obligations under the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The Agency’s \r\nA/66/PV.46  \r\n \r\n11-57396 18 \r\n \r\nsystem of safeguards is a fundamental component of \r\nthe global nuclear non-proliferation regime. The \r\nmeasures contained in the additional protocol form an \r\nintegral part of this system. The comprehensive \r\nsafeguards agreement, together with the additional \r\nprotocol, constitutes the current best verification \r\nstandard. We note the increased number of countries \r\nthat have brought into force the additional protocol to \r\ntheir comprehensive safeguards agreement. Universal \r\nadherence by States to both instruments would \r\nstrengthen the non-proliferation regime and contribute \r\nto further enhancing security worldwide. \r\n Since January 2006, Ukraine has had a \r\nComprehensive Safeguards Agreement and Additional \r\nProtocol in force. Over the past few years, we have \r\nworked hard, together with the IAEA, to receive its \r\nbroader conclusion on the implementation of our \r\nsafeguards obligations. The IAEA safeguards \r\nimplementation report for 2010 acknowledged our \r\nefforts. In 2010, Ukraine received, for the first time, \r\nthe IAEA broader conclusion. We continue to work \r\nwith the Agency to establish the conditions necessary \r\nfor the application of IAEA integrated safeguards in \r\nUkraine. \r\n We recognize the importance of supporting \r\nresearch on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, \r\nespecially safety, waste management, radiation \r\nprotection, the safety and efficiency aspects of \r\nadvanced technology, and the importance of enhancing \r\ninternational cooperation in those fields. Maintaining \r\ncompetence and know-how across the nuclear sector is \r\nfundamental to these activities. We view positively the \r\nincreased amount of research being carried out by the \r\nIAEA concerning innovative reactor technologies and \r\nfuel cycles. Ukraine offers the relevant expert services \r\nto the IAEA, free of charge, in the context of the \r\nInternational Project on Innovative Nuclear Reactors \r\nand Fuel Cycles. Ukraine will continue to cooperate \r\nactively with the IAEA in the development and \r\nimplementation of regional programmes addressing the \r\nissues of the non-power use of nuclear technologies, \r\nnamely, medical applications, dosimetry and mitigation \r\nof the consequences of the Chernobyl catastrophe. \r\n Ukraine has always been a strong supporter of the \r\nIAEA Technical Cooperation Programme, which \r\nconstitutes an important statutory function of the \r\nAgency. Ukraine considers the implementation of the \r\nIAEA Technical Cooperation Programme as the \r\ncornerstone of international cooperation in the peaceful \r\nuses of nuclear energy. I wish to commend the work \r\ndone by the IAEA in planning and implementing such \r\nprogrammes and activities, which reflect the needs of \r\ndifferent countries and different regions. Addressing \r\nthe global challenges of hunger, disease, poverty and \r\nwater-resource management, as well as the creation of \r\na cleaner and safer environment, is of particular \r\nsignificance to developing countries. Ukraine values \r\nthe efforts of the Agency in those areas. \r\n Regional and national technical cooperation \r\nprojects have contributed to the safety and \r\neffectiveness of the peaceful use of nuclear energy in \r\nUkraine. We have demonstrated the tangible and \r\nsustainable results of our cooperation, particularly \r\nregarding safety improvements at our nuclear power \r\nplants. We also appreciate the results already achieved \r\nin improving the quality and effectiveness of nuclear \r\nmedicine, radiotherapy and medical physics.  \r\n I would like to mention in particular the modern \r\nequipment and training for nuclear oncology and \r\nradiotherapy that has been provided to us. Human \r\nhealth will remain one of the priorities of our technical \r\ncooperation programme in the future. \r\n Ukraine considers it important for technical \r\ncooperation management and project implementation \r\nto become more efficient and effective, for the benefit \r\nof all Member States. It is important to ensure fair \r\naccess to technical cooperation funds and the \r\npredictable funding of such programmes. Beneficiary \r\ncountries are key actors in achieving a successful \r\noutcome in their respective technical cooperation \r\nprojects. The key to effectiveness is to meet the real \r\nneeds of the Member States. In order to maximize the \r\nsocio-economic impact of the programmes, it is crucial \r\nthat the IAEA further develop partnerships with other \r\norganizations where appropriate. \r\n In conclusion, we would like to join other \r\ndelegations in welcoming the IAEA report (see \r\nA/66/95) to the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth \r\nsession and express our deep appreciation for the work \r\nof the IAEA Director General and the Agency. \r\n Ms. Karim (Singapore): The Singapore \r\ndelegation would like to thank the Director General of \r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), \r\nMr. Yukiya Amano, and his secretariat for the IAEA’s \r\ncomprehensive annual report (see A/66/95). \r\n A/66/PV.46\r\n \r\n19 11-57396 \r\n \r\n As the global focal point for nuclear cooperation, \r\nthe IAEA continues to play a crucial role in promoting \r\nthe safe, secure and peaceful uses of nuclear science \r\nand technology. Its mission of safety and security, \r\nsafeguards and verification, and science and \r\ntechnology constitute a comprehensive regime, each \r\npillar of which is equally essential. Singapore strongly \r\nsupports the IAEA’s important work and is pleased to \r\nsponsor the draft resolution (A/66/L.6) on the report of \r\nthe IAEA. \r\n Nuclear safety came into the spotlight this year \r\nwith the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident, in \r\nMarch. The Fukushima accident demonstrated the \r\ngrave dangers posed by low-probability, high-impact \r\naccidents that are difficult to predict and guard against. \r\nWe must therefore work together to further strengthen \r\nthe global nuclear safety framework and the global \r\nemergency preparedness and response mechanisms for \r\nnuclear emergencies. Singapore believes that the IAEA \r\nshould drive that process.  \r\n We thank the Director General for convening the \r\nhigh-level Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Safety in \r\nVienna in June 2011, to learn from the experiences of \r\nthe Fukushima accident. The Conference and the \r\nadoption of the 12-point action plan at the IAEA \r\nGeneral Conference in September was a first step \r\nforward towards a comprehensive review of the global \r\nnuclear safety framework. The process is a continuing \r\none. Unfortunately, some continue to insist that the \r\ncurrent global nuclear safety infrastructure is fine as it \r\ncurrently stands and that all that is required is better \r\nadherence to and implementation of current practices. \r\nMy delegation urges all parties to keep an open mind in \r\nengaging in an honest and open review of the global \r\nnuclear safety framework, and to accord the highest \r\nconsideration to ensuring the safety of nuclear \r\ninstallations. Although the primary responsibility for \r\nnuclear safety rests with individual States, we must not \r\nforget that any accident would have a far-reaching and \r\npotentially devastating transboundary impact. If we \r\nwere to do less, the potential grave consequences \r\nwould be unforgivable, as we would have had a chance \r\nto do better but did not because of narrow interests. \r\n Nuclear non-proliferation remains a core aspect \r\nof the IAEA’s mission. Singapore firmly believes that \r\nall States have the right to develop and use nuclear \r\nenergy for peaceful purposes. At the same time, the \r\nIAEA has the vital task of ensuring that nuclear \r\nmaterial and technology meant for peaceful purposes \r\nare not diverted for non-civilian uses that could \r\nthreaten regional and international peace and stability. \r\nThe IAEA’s safeguards and verification regimes \r\nprovide credible assurance that declared nuclear \r\nmaterial and facilities are for peaceful uses. It is \r\ntherefore both in the interests and the responsibility of \r\nall States to comply with these regimes. In that \r\nconnection, Singapore strongly urges all States that \r\nhave not done so to accede to the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the \r\nIAEA’s comprehensive safeguards agreement and \r\nadditional protocol. Those States that have done so \r\nshould fully implement those agreements. As the \r\nnumber of nuclear power reactors is likely to increase \r\nby at least 90, and up to 350, by the year 2030, it is \r\ncrucial that countries enforce and step up their \r\nindividual measures to ensure security against theft of \r\nnuclear material for illicit purposes and malicious \r\nattacks against nuclear facilities. \r\n A peaceful and secure world free of nuclear \r\nweapons is one that we all aspire to. The IAEA has a \r\nunique and important mission to fulfil in the promotion \r\nof peaceful applications of nuclear science and \r\ntechnology and in ensuring that they benefit as many \r\ncitizens of the world as possible. Some important areas \r\nthat come to mind include the fields of cancer \r\ntreatment, food security and water management. This is \r\nall the more pertinent given that the world population \r\nis continuing to grow and the competition for resources \r\nis increasingly tighter. \r\n As a member of the IAEA Board of Governors, \r\nSingapore would like to reiterate our continued support \r\nfor the Agency’s vital role and tasks. Singapore’s \r\ncooperation with the IAEA focuses on the applications \r\nof nuclear technology in areas such as industry, health \r\nand radiation protection. Over the past decade, we have \r\nhosted 22 scientific visits, 83 fellowship attachments \r\nand 24 regional training events with the IAEA. The \r\nmost recent event was the regional seminar on the \r\nAgency’s safeguards system for South-East Asian \r\nStates with significant nuclear activities, held in March \r\nthis year.  \r\n In our remaining year on the Board, we will \r\ncontinue to exert our utmost efforts for the \r\nadvancement of the IAEA’s mission. \r\n Mr. Ciobo (Australia): Australia is pleased to \r\nhave the opportunity to commend Director General \r\nMr. Yukiya Amano for his briefing on the achievements \r\nA/66/PV.46  \r\n \r\n11-57396 20 \r\n \r\nof the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and \r\nthe challenges it will face over the coming years. We \r\nare honoured to be a member of the IAEA Board of \r\nGovernors and take very seriously the responsibility \r\nthat entails. Australia attaches great importance to the \r\ncentral role played by the IAEA in improving the \r\nsafety and security of nuclear activities, enlarging the \r\nhumanitarian contribution of nuclear technology and \r\nverifying States’ non-proliferation commitments. \r\n This year, the twenty-fifth anniversary year of the \r\nChernobyl accident, we saw the devastating natural \r\ndisasters in Japan and the subsequent accident at the \r\nFukushima nuclear plant. Our thoughts continue to be \r\nwith Japan and its people.  \r\n We welcome Director General Amano’s actions \r\nand initiatives regarding nuclear safety in the wake of \r\nFukushima. We are pleased to have been able to \r\nparticipate in the IAEA Ministerial Conference in June \r\nand to have contributed to the efforts to improve \r\nnuclear safety and to address public confidence, as \r\nreflected in the ministerial declaration and \r\nsubsequently in the Action Plan on Nuclear Safety \r\nadopted by the IAEA General Conference. \r\n The Action Plan is a strong and practical \r\ndemonstration of the priority we all attach to achieving \r\nthe highest possible standards with regard to nuclear \r\nsafety. We encourage States to be proactive in \r\nundertaking the actions outlined in the Plan and any \r\nadditional actions that are relevant to their own \r\ncircumstances. \r\n Australia continues to work closely with the \r\nAgency and our regional neighbours with regard to \r\nnuclear safety and security. Australia is committed to \r\nbest international practice in regard to safeguards, \r\nsafety and the security of nuclear material. Signifying \r\nthis commitment, Australia, in collaboration with the \r\nIAEA, has established an informal Vienna-based \r\ncontact group for existing and prospective uranium \r\nmining companies, with the easy-to-remember \r\nacronym “FoRUM” — Friends of Responsible \r\nUranium Mining — as a means of exchanging views \r\nand experiences with regard to best-practice mining of \r\nuranium.  \r\n Safety measures are not the only elements \r\nrequired to properly protect people and the \r\nenvironment. Australia is also a strong supporter of the \r\nAgency’s nuclear security programme and its role in \r\ninternational nuclear security initiatives and activities. \r\n The IAEA safeguards system is one of the central \r\npillars of the nuclear non-proliferation regime. To be \r\ncompletely effective, the system must have universal \r\ncoverage. We continue to call upon all of the States \r\nparty to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \r\nWeapons (NPT) that have yet to fulfil their obligations \r\nunder the Treaty to conclude comprehensive safeguards \r\nagreements as well as additional protocols, and to do \r\nso without delay.  \r\n Australia has long emphasized the importance of \r\nthe universalization of the NPT. We encourage those \r\nStates that have not yet signed and ratified the Treaty \r\nto do so as soon as possible. \r\n States must comply with their safeguards \r\nobligations. IAEA safeguards obligations are not \r\nvoluntary. It is therefore a matter of continuing regret \r\nand deep concern that certain States continue to be in \r\nbreach of their safeguards obligations. We call upon \r\nthose countries to engage with the Agency to resolve \r\nall issues, demonstrate conclusively the peaceful intent \r\nof their nuclear programme and comply fully with all \r\nof their international obligations. Australia commends \r\nthe Agency for its continuing efforts to resolve those \r\nissues. \r\n Australia continues to work closely with the \r\nAgency and our regional neighbours on the peaceful \r\napplications of nuclear energy. Australia shares its \r\nskilled scientific research base with other Member \r\nStates and facilitates the use and exchange of \r\nequipment and personnel in fields relevant to the \r\npeaceful uses of nuclear science and technology. We \r\nare pleased to maintain our strong support for and \r\ncontribution to the Agency’s technical cooperation \r\nprogramme. \r\n I am pleased to recall that in the spirit of the \r\nIAEA Peaceful Uses Initiative, Australia contributed \r\nA$100,000 to the IAEA for the marine benchmark \r\nstudy on the possible impact of the Fukushima \r\nradioactive releases in the Asia-Pacific region. \r\nAustralia worked closely with our regional neighbours \r\nto formulate the project and acknowledges the role of \r\nthe IAEA in achieving its prompt initiation, with the \r\nfirst meeting hosted in Sydney in late August. \r\n The Agency plays a vital role in enhancing States’ \r\ncapabilities to prevent, diagnose and treat health \r\nproblems through the use of nuclear techniques. We \r\nshould never lose sight of such humanitarian benefits, \r\nwhich the IAEA is uniquely able to provide worldwide. \r\n A/66/PV.46\r\n \r\n21 11-57396 \r\n \r\nAustralia works closely with the Agency in those areas \r\nand is pleased to coordinate with it in providing \r\nclinical education in radiation medical physics to \r\ncountries in South-East Asia. \r\n The external environment in which the Agency \r\noperates is highly fluid, and the Agency must maintain \r\nthe capacity to respond quickly and effectively to \r\nexternal developments, whether related to nuclear \r\nsafety, physical protection, nuclear proliferation or \r\nsustainable development. Australia will continue to \r\nprovide technical, financial and political support for \r\nDirector General Amano’s efforts to strengthen the \r\nAgency’s contribution to the promotion of the use of \r\nnuclear energy for peaceful purposes and to the cause \r\nof international peace and security. \r\n Australia is pleased to sponsor and support the \r\ndraft resolution on the report of the IAEA (A/66/L.6). \r\n Mr. Hermoso (Philippines): At the outset, the \r\nPhilippines would like to welcome the newest member \r\nof the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the \r\nLao People’s Democratic Republic — a fellow member \r\nof the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.  \r\n The Philippines welcomes the report of His \r\nExcellency Mr. Yukiya Amano, Director General of the \r\nIAEA, and recognizes the importance of the Agency. \r\nAt the same time, the Philippines reaffirms its strong \r\nsupport for the crucial role of the IAEA in assisting its \r\nmember States in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, \r\nthe transfer of technology to developing countries and \r\nfacilitating nuclear knowledge sharing, as well as in \r\nnuclear safety, verification and security. \r\n The events of the past year presented significant \r\nchallenges to the work of the IAEA. The Fukushima \r\nnuclear accident shook the international community’s \r\nperceptions of nuclear power, including the safety of \r\nexisting power plants and proposed new facilities. \r\nMore important, it compelled a number of countries, \r\nincluding the Philippines, to rethink their respective \r\nnational positions on nuclear power. \r\n However, as oil prices have continued to soar and \r\nconcerns over climate change persist, the interest in \r\nnuclear power remains, and countries continue to turn \r\nto the IAEA for assistance in the development or \r\nexpansion of their nuclear power programmes. The \r\nIAEA is uniquely placed to respond to the requests of \r\nits member States for assistance in the development of \r\na safety infrastructure for nuclear power programmes, \r\nwhile also promoting international cooperation in \r\nnuclear safety. The Philippines believes that the IAEA \r\nshould continue to provide assistance to countries, such \r\nas ours, that are still considering the inclusion of \r\nnuclear power in their energy mix, particularly in the \r\ndevelopment of a regulatory framework, capacity \r\nbuilding and the management of radioactive waste. \r\n In that regard, the Philippines supports the \r\nIAEA’s central role in the area of nuclear safety and \r\nwelcomes the adoption of the Action Plan on Nuclear \r\nSafety, which will serve as a building block for the \r\ndevelopment of more targeted measures for enhancing \r\nnuclear safety worldwide. \r\n Through its cooperation with the IAEA, the \r\nPhilippines has been developing the necessary human \r\nresources and physical infrastructure in order to use \r\nnuclear technologies to help meet the challenges that \r\nmany of us face today. On human health, the \r\nPhilippines’ standing request to be part of the Agency’s \r\nProgramme of Action for Cancer Therapy (PACT) was \r\nfinally approved for implementation this year. An \r\nintegrated review in connection with PACT, also \r\nknown as an imPACT mission, was undertaken in the \r\nPhilippines in March and enabled our health authorities \r\nto assess the National Cancer Action Plan and identify \r\nareas for improvement.  \r\n The Philippines will also be part of a network of \r\nregional training centres on cancer control and \r\nradiotherapy, which will enable it to enhance the \r\ncapacities of its health professionals working in the \r\narea of cancer control and treatment, particularly those \r\nin the provinces. On behalf of the Group of 77 and \r\nChina, the Philippines has introduced resolutions on \r\nPACT, on the staffing of the Agency’s secretariat and \r\non women in the secretariat. \r\n In the field of nuclear medicine, the Philippines \r\nhas established a radioisotope laboratory with the \r\nassistance of the Agency. We expect that this facility \r\nwill lower the costs of nuclear medicine procedures in \r\nmy country. \r\n In the area of the environment, we welcome the \r\nDirector General’s focus this year on the Agency’s \r\nwork on issues related to water. As a pilot country for \r\nthe IAEA Water Availability Enhancement Project, the \r\nPhilippines is developing sustainable and socially \r\nresponsible water resources management plans. In \r\nApril, the Philippines hosted a national workshop, \r\nwhich produced a report analysing the country’s \r\nA/66/PV.46  \r\n \r\n11-57396 22 \r\n \r\ncapacity to conduct comprehensive water resource \r\nassessments and developed a road map to address gaps \r\nin hydrological data and information.  \r\n Furthermore, in 2010, the Philippines was \r\nredesignated as an IAEA Collaborating Centre on the \r\napplication of nuclear techniques in the study of \r\nharmful algal blooms.  \r\n The IAEA has continued to play an important role \r\nin helping countries to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals through its Technical Cooperation \r\nProgramme and its various activities in the area of \r\nnuclear applications. We acknowledge the significant \r\ncontribution of projects supported by the Agency’s \r\nTechnical Cooperation Programme, especially in the \r\nareas of health and nutrition, environmental resource \r\nmanagement and agricultural and industrial \r\nproductivity. \r\n Concerns persist about nuclear terrorism and the \r\nillicit trafficking of nuclear and radioactive materials. \r\nThe Philippines reaffirms the importance of \r\nstrengthening the Agency’s activities in response to \r\nthose threats. For its part, the Philippines is committed \r\nto strengthening the security of the nuclear and \r\nradioactive materials that are used for peaceful \r\npurposes and to preventing the illicit trafficking of \r\nsuch materials. \r\n That commitment is embodied in our National \r\nNuclear Security Plan, which was finalized in \r\ncooperation with the IAEA. The symbolic \r\ncommissioning ceremony of the Megaports Initiative \r\nfacilities at the port of Manila this year marked a \r\nmilestone in our bilateral cooperation with the United \r\nStates on nuclear security. Through the Global Threat \r\nReduction Initiative, the Philippines also works closely \r\nwith Australia, the United States and our fellow \r\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) \r\nmembers in securing radioactive sources in the region. \r\n Another major challenge that continues to \r\nconfront us is the increasing risk of nuclear \r\nproliferation. The Philippines reaffirms the importance \r\nof strengthening the Agency’s nuclear verification \r\ncapabilities and building confidence in the peaceful \r\nnature of all nuclear activities. The conclusion of \r\ncomprehensive safeguards agreements and additional \r\nprotocols will go a long way in efforts to reduce the \r\nrisk of nuclear proliferation. \r\n The Philippines shares the vision of a world free \r\nof nuclear weapons and strongly supports the \r\nestablishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones as a means \r\nof contributing to international peace and security. In \r\nour own region, ASEAN established the South-East \r\nAsia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone. We welcome the \r\nprogress in the discussions held in recent months with \r\nthe nuclear-weapon States on their possible accession \r\nto the Treaty of Bangkok.  \r\n We also welcome the decision of the Director \r\nGeneral to convene a forum to discuss the experiences \r\nof the five existing nuclear-weapon-free zones, which \r\ncould be of possible relevance to the creation of a \r\nnuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. The \r\nPhilippines is committed to contributing to the success \r\nof the forum, which we believe will serve as an important \r\nconfidence-building measure that will contribute to the \r\nrealization of the 2012 conference on the establishment of a \r\nMiddle East zone free of nuclear weapons and all other \r\nweapons of mass destruction, as provided for in the Final \r\nDocument of the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to \r\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \r\n(NPT/CONF.2010/50 (Vol. I)). \r\n The IAEA has been successful in charting its way \r\nforward. Progress will not be easy, as political realities \r\nand financial constraints alike pose difficult hurdles for \r\nthe Agency to overcome. The Philippines believes, \r\nhowever, that now is the time for IAEA member States \r\nto set aside all differences and to stand united in order \r\nto advance our common objectives.  \r\n Mr. Diallo (Senegal) (spoke in French): I am \r\npleased to participate in this annual meeting, which \r\naffords the Assembly an opportunity to consider the \r\nvitally important activities of the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency (IAEA).  \r\n However, I must draw the IAEA secretariat’s \r\nattention to the difficulties experienced by my \r\ndelegation in being granted timely access to the report \r\n(see A/66/95) of the Director General. My delegation \r\nstrongly regrets that situation and hopes that corrective \r\nmeasures will be taken in that regard.  \r\n Among the most pressing concerns of States, the \r\ndilemma posed by nuclear technology is one of the \r\nmost widely shared and is undoubtedly one of the most \r\ndifficult to address. \r\n Indeed, while the many applications of nuclear \r\nenergy, including in the areas of health, agriculture and \r\n A/66/PV.46\r\n \r\n23 11-57396 \r\n \r\nelectricity generation, made it seem undeniably useful \r\nto many countries, its use has also created certain \r\nsafety and security risks. In truth, the difficulties in \r\nmanaging nuclear risk are steadily increasing as a \r\nresult of growing environmental hazards, as evidenced \r\nby the unfortunate nuclear accident that occurred in \r\nMarch in Fukushima, Japan. The accident finally \r\nconvinced us of the need to improve nuclear safety and \r\nsecurity measures by better adapting them to meet new \r\nchallenges. \r\n That realization undoubtedly inspired the IAEA \r\nBoard of Governors to adopt an Action Plan on Nuclear \r\nSafety to improve the global nuclear safety framework. \r\nMy delegation welcomes that valuable initiative and \r\nthe high-level meeting on nuclear safety and security, \r\nheld on 22 September and convened by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. As it did on that occasion, Senegal reiterates \r\nthe urgency of reviewing the rules and principles \r\ngoverning the application and monitoring of nuclear \r\nsafety and security standards, so as to ensure greater \r\ntransparency and accountability in the framework of \r\nappropriate procedures. \r\n Drawing on our past experience, we must take all \r\nnecessary measures to bolster nuclear safety and \r\nsecurity, as well as to better prepare for emergencies \r\nand protect people and the environment from the \r\nharmful effects of ionizing radiation and radiation \r\nrisks. That is the only way that we will be able to \r\nrestore confidence in the peaceful use of nuclear \r\nenergy. The pursuit of the peaceful use of atomic \r\nenergy should strictly take into account the need to \r\nprotect human and environmental health.  \r\n Senegal highly values its scientific and technical \r\ncooperation with the IAEA, in particular in the areas of \r\nhealth and nutrition. That long history of cooperation \r\nhas been enriched by many programmes, some of \r\nwhich I am pleased to mention: the application of the \r\nsterile insect technique, which has ensured that \r\nSenegalese research entities have come to serve as \r\nbenchmarks in this field; our research programme on \r\nnutritional development for women has also been \r\nsuccessful; and finally, the acquisition of a gamma \r\ncamera, which is considered a major step forward in \r\nmedical science. \r\n Armed with that experience, we are in a good \r\nposition to testify to the fact that the IAEA has also \r\ncontributed to our country’s advances in the areas of \r\nsociety and health. For that reason, we must always \r\nkeep in mind that positive accomplishments in the \r\nlaudable and difficult matters before the Agency, \r\nespecially relating to verification, cooperation and the \r\nprovision of assistance, call for our unwavering \r\nsupport. \r\n My delegation is also convinced that the IAEA \r\nwill remain an institution worthy of our efforts, which \r\nmust be strengthened and appropriately resourced in \r\norder to implement its mandate. \r\n Mr. Guerber (Switzerland) (spoke in French): \r\nSwitzerland would like to focus its remarks on what, in \r\nour view, was the key issue before the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in recent months, \r\nnamely, the nuclear accident at Fukushima. \r\n As that event demonstrated, such disasters have \r\ntransboundary and multidimensional consequences, \r\nand should therefore be managed with a global \r\napproach. Switzerland therefore welcomes the adoption \r\nat the fifty-fifth session of the General Conference of \r\nthe IAEA in September of the Action Plan on Nuclear \r\nSafety. Switzerland believes that, by its very nature, \r\nthe IAEA must assume the leading role in coordinating \r\nthe international efforts to strengthen nuclear safety. \r\n Switzerland was actively involved in the \r\nnegotiation process of the Action Plan and, like a \r\nnumber of States, has expressed regrets about the \r\nrelatively modest ambitions contained in the final \r\ndocument as adopted. However, we consider the Action \r\nPlan as a first step in a process that should lead to less \r\nvoluntary commitments from member States in the \r\nfield of nuclear safety. \r\n Switzerland therefore welcomes the speedy \r\nestablishment by the IAEA Director General of a \r\nNuclear Safety Action Team to coordinate the \r\nimplementation of the Action Plan. Similarly, we \r\nwelcome the commitment made by the IAEA Director \r\nGeneral to inform member States on progress made in \r\nimplementing the Action Plan. Switzerland also \r\nencourages all IAEA member States to fulfil their \r\nobligations related to the implementation of the Action \r\nPlan at the national level. \r\n Switzerland will remain fully committed in this \r\narea, with a view to creating a nuclear safety regime so \r\nthat we can assure our societies that the development \r\nof civilian nuclear energy will not act as a sword of \r\nDamocles constantly hanging over their heads. \r\nA/66/PV.46  \r\n \r\n11-57396 24 \r\n \r\n Mr. Kodama (Japan): Let me begin by thanking \r\nthe Director General of the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency, Mr. Yukiya Amano, for presenting the \r\nannual report (see A/66/95) of the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency (IAEA). \r\n The accident at Tokyo Electric Power Company’s \r\nFukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in March was \r\ntriggered by the Great East Japan Earthquake and its \r\nresulting tsunamis. The accident caused grave damage \r\nto Japan and its people. Japan is now moving forward \r\nto overcome that tragic event. I would like to take this \r\nopportunity once again to extend our deepest \r\nappreciation to all of the Member States, the IAEA and \r\nall other organizations that have rendered their support, \r\nfor their assistance and solidarity. \r\n I would also like to express our appreciation for \r\nthe leadership demonstrated by Director General \r\nAmano and the continuous efforts made by the IAEA \r\nsince the accident. Those efforts include supporting the \r\nprovision of information about the accident; \r\ndispatching a number of teams, experts and \r\ninternational missions to the area; and adopting the \r\nAction Plan on Nuclear Safety. \r\n Thanks to that invaluable support, the situation at \r\nthe plant is moving steadily towards restoration. We \r\nare planning to move up the existing target date and \r\nwill endeavour to achieve cold shutdown by the end of \r\nthe year. In that regard, Japan will continue to work \r\nclosely with partners around the world, and in \r\nparticular with the IAEA, to make the most of all \r\navailable international expertise. For instance, Japan \r\nwill host a high-level conference with the IAEA in \r\n2012. Through that initiative, we intend to share with \r\nthe international community the results of our \r\ncomprehensive review on nuclear power plants and the \r\nfuture direction of nuclear safety measures. \r\n The IAEA has also played an instrumental role in \r\nensuring the success of the United Nations high-level \r\nmeeting on nuclear safety and security. Both Prime \r\nMinister Noda and Foreign Minister Gemba \r\nparticipated in the meeting and expressed Japan’s \r\nresolve not only to overcome its own challenges but \r\nalso to share with the international community lessons \r\nlearned from the accident at Fukushima. The \r\nconference demonstrated the central and indispensable \r\nrole of the IAEA in consolidating international efforts \r\nto enhance nuclear safety throughout the international \r\ncommunity. \r\n The IAEA is the only international organization \r\nwith expertise in all aspects of nuclear energy, and not \r\nonly in the areas of nuclear safety and security. We \r\nmust not relax our efforts to support such roles on the \r\npart of the IAEA. On 21 September, Japan convened \r\nhere in New York the third ministerial meeting of the \r\nNon-Proliferation and Disarmament Initiative, a group \r\nconsisting of 10 non-nuclear-weapon States. At the \r\nmeeting, the ministers issued a joint statement \r\nexpressing members’ strong support for steps to further \r\nadvance the implementation of the action plan agreed \r\nat the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the \r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. \r\nJapan will continue to lead international efforts \r\ntowards a world without nuclear weapons. \r\n The North Korean nuclear issue constitutes a \r\nthreat to peace and security in East Asia and to the \r\ninternational community as a whole and poses a serious \r\nchallenge to the regime established by the Treaty on \r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). The \r\nNorth Korean uranium enrichment programme is a \r\nclear violation of the relevant Security Council \r\nresolutions and the joint statement of the fourth round \r\nof the Six-Party Talks. It is important for the \r\ninternational community to continue to strongly urge \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to abandon \r\nits nuclear weapons and related programmes, as \r\nstipulated in the relevant Security Council resolutions. \r\nIn that regard, Japan welcomes the comprehensive \r\nreport on the North Korean nuclear issue that the IAEA \r\nDirector General submitted to the Board of Governors \r\nat its September meeting. \r\n With regard to the Iranian nuclear issue, it is \r\nindispensable for the Islamic Republic of Iran to take \r\naction to alleviate all suspicions and win the \r\nconfidence of the international community. While \r\nJapan notes that the Islamic Republic of Iran invited \r\nthe IAEA to visit its facilities in August, we remain \r\nseriously concerned that it continues to engage in \r\nuranium enrichment activities. In that regard, Japan \r\nsupports the efforts of the Director General to conduct \r\ndiscussions with Iran, as well as the dedicated \r\nactivities of the Agency to resolve the Iran nuclear \r\nissue. Japan will continue to act in concert with the \r\ninternational community to find a peaceful and \r\ndiplomatic settlement of this issue. \r\n Japan highly appreciates the efforts made by \r\nDirector General Amano towards the holding of the \r\nforum on the exchange of experiences of possible \r\n A/66/PV.46\r\n \r\n25 11-57396 \r\n \r\nrelevance to the creation of a nuclear-weapons-free \r\nzone in the Middle East scheduled for November, \r\nwhich I expect will contribute significantly to the \r\nconvening of a conference in 2012 on the \r\nestablishment of a Middle East zone free of all \r\nweapons of mass destruction. \r\n Showing support for the non-proliferation efforts \r\nof other member States and of the IAEA continues to \r\nbe a priority for Japan. Japan has hosted the Asian \r\nSenior-level Talks on Non-Proliferation and has \r\nprovided cooperation for IAEA activities designed to \r\npromote the entry into force of additional protocols. On \r\n31 May, Japan also co-organized with Poland and \r\nTurkey a seminar in New York to discuss the effective \r\nimplementation of the Security Council resolutions on \r\nnon-proliferation. We believe that it is imperative that \r\nStates Members of the United Nations continue to be \r\nengaged in this matter. Japan therefore plans to \r\norganize a second such meeting in New York next \r\nDecember. \r\n The IAEA’s continuing efforts to utilize nuclear \r\ntechnologies to develop solutions for global issues, \r\nsuch as water shortages and lack of access to cancer \r\ntherapies in developing countries, are highly \r\nappreciated by member States. In that connection, \r\nJapan welcomes the IAEA initiative to raise awareness \r\nwithin the wider United Nations community through \r\nthe briefing it organized in New York in September \r\nimmediately preceding the Science Forum held in \r\nVienna.  \r\n To ensure a safer nuclear future, the training of \r\nnuclear experts to underpin such a vision is essential. \r\nTo that end, Japan established a nuclear human \r\nresource development network last November. Through \r\nsuch efforts, Japan will cooperate with the IAEA to \r\nnurture capable experts. \r\n Despite the tragic events that befell Japan this \r\nMarch, I am convinced that, through the resilience of \r\nour people and assisted by the generous support of our \r\npartners in the international community, including the \r\nIAEA, we will overcome the challenge those events \r\nhave presented. I am equally confident that we will \r\nfind a path towards a safer nuclear future, benefiting \r\nfrom the lessons learned in this instance and the \r\naccumulated wisdom of the world in this field. \r\n Mrs. Aitimova (Kazakhstan): Kazakhstan wishes \r\nto congratulate Mr. Yukiya Amano, Director General of \r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), for \r\nhis comprehensive report (see A/66/95), and in that \r\nconnection, we are pleased to sponsor draft resolution \r\nA/66/L.6. As a member of the Agency, Kazakhstan is \r\nproud of its record of collaboration with the IAEA and \r\nwill continue to strengthen that productive partnership.  \r\n President Nursultan Nazarbayev, speaking at the \r\nhigh-level meeting on nuclear safety and security \r\nconvened by the Secretary-General on 22 September \r\n2011, aptly summarized the IAEA’s responsibility by \r\nsaying that it must protect humankind from nuclear \r\nweapons, counter potential nuclear terrorism, ensure \r\nthe safety of nuclear power and advance human \r\nbetterment through peaceful purposes.  \r\n He also said that it was important, in order to \r\nachieve those ends, to bring international legal norms \r\ninto line with the reality of the existence of de facto \r\nnuclear-weapon States. At the same time, the greatest \r\nrisks are associated with States that are involved in the \r\nblack market in nuclear technologies, hence the \r\nimportance of credible compliance by States parties \r\nwith the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \r\nWeapons (NPT). We have to improve global \r\nmechanisms for managing processes in the \r\ndevelopment of nuclear power and the safety of nuclear \r\nfacilities.  \r\n President Nazarbayev also proposed conducting \r\nregular stress tests of nuclear plants and protections \r\nsystems and developing rapid rescue responses under \r\nthe auspices of the IAEA. \r\n My country is a major producer of uranium ore \r\nand has the fuel fabrication capability to further expand \r\nthe peaceful uses of nuclear energy within the \r\nframework of IAEA safeguards. Kazakhstan \r\ncollaborates with the Russian Federation to make its \r\nuranium available for enrichment at the National \r\nNuclear Centre in Angarsk, Siberia, for use as nuclear \r\nfuel in power reactors, and on developing the \r\nKurchatov Nuclear Technology Park under IAEA \r\nsurveillance. \r\n My delegation supports the IAEA initiative to \r\ndevelop a new non-political and non-discriminatory \r\nframework for utilizing nuclear energy based on \r\nmultilateral approaches to the nuclear fuel cycle and \r\navailable to all member States complying with \r\nsafeguards. In that way, no State should have to \r\nsurrender its rights under the NPT.  \r\nA/66/PV.46  \r\n \r\n11-57396 26 \r\n \r\n Kazakhstan has officially confirmed to the \r\nAgency its offer to host an IAEA nuclear fuel bank for \r\ncountries unable to acquire nuclear fuel supplies in the \r\nmarket. As soon as the exact site in my country has \r\nbeen determined, steps will be taken to establish the \r\nbank. In addition, our national atomic energy company, \r\nKazatomprom, is in the process of creating a vertically \r\nintegrated establishment with a complete nuclear fuel \r\ncycle in compliance with IAEA standards. \r\n The Central Asian Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone, \r\nthe Treaty for which was signed in Semipalatinsk, is an \r\nadditional contribution to our region, and Kazakhstan \r\nstrictly and transparently abides by the IAEA \r\nsafeguards agreement and additional protocol in order \r\nto reduce the risk of nuclear terrorism and smuggling \r\nof nuclear weapons and radioactive materials.  \r\n As current Chair of the Ministerial Council of the \r\nOrganization of Islamic Cooperation, and in its \r\nnational capacity, Kazakhstan supports the \r\nestablishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the \r\nMiddle East as a solution that supports peace in the \r\nregion. Working together with the facilitator, we \r\ncommend the work of the IAEA on the 2012 \r\nconference on this issue.  \r\n We are implementing in a consistent manner the \r\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of Acts of \r\nNuclear Terrorism and Security Council resolution \r\n1540 (2004), in order to strengthen measures aimed at \r\ncombating illegal trafficking in nuclear and other \r\nmaterials. In September, with the support of the United \r\nNations Office for Disarmament Affairs and the \r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, \r\nwe hosted a Security Council resolution 1540 (2004) \r\ntraining workshop for 30 experts from the Central \r\nAsian region, funded by the Governments of Norway \r\nand the United States of America. As a member of the \r\nNuclear Suppliers Group and the Zangger Committee, \r\nKazakhstan maintains the strictest control over its \r\nequipment and installations that enrich uranium and \r\nreprocess spent nuclear fuel. \r\n In view of the growing importance of nuclear \r\nenergy, Kazakhstan has entered into an agreement with \r\nthe IAEA on technical cooperation for 2010-2015 to \r\ndevelop nuclear energy for nuclear education, medicine \r\nand agriculture, research reactor safety, nuclear \r\ntechnology, radioisotope and radiation applications for \r\ncollective global human security. \r\n An issue of concern to us is that Kazakhstan, \r\nthough a key and responsible member of the IAEA, is \r\nbeing denied the opportunity to participate in the work \r\nof elective bodies because of the rules of procedure \r\ncurrently in place. Kazakhstan fully supports the early \r\nentry into force of the amendments to article VI of the \r\nIAEA Statute, and we are confident that a solution will \r\nbe found. I would like to state that Kazakhstan \r\ncontributes regularly to the IAEA budget, as well as to \r\nthe Technical Cooperation Fund. \r\n To conclude, we extend our full support to the \r\nDirector General in every area of the Agency’s \r\nmandate to address global issues of nuclear technology. \r\n Mr. Pankin (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): The Russian delegation would like to express \r\nits appreciation to the Director General of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), \r\nMr. Yukiya Amano, for his presentation of the report of \r\nthe Agency (see A/66/95). \r\n Russia greatly values the IAEA’s work in \r\nimproving and strengthening the global non-proliferation \r\nregime, and in ensuring wide and safe uses of nuclear \r\nenergy. The Agency contributes significantly to solving \r\nproblems in the areas of reliable energy supplies, \r\ncombating global climate change and promoting health \r\nand well-being around the world. It is also important \r\nthat the IAEA continue to increase its efforts to \r\nbroaden international cooperation in the area of the \r\npeaceful uses of nuclear energy. With regard to the \r\nIAEA’s activities, we should not omit to note the \r\nunique nature of its verification mechanism, which \r\nenables extremely effective monitoring of States’ \r\ncompliance with their non-proliferation obligations \r\nunder the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \r\nWeapons (NPT). We believe it is important that the \r\nAgency continue to expand its oversight capabilities, \r\nincluding through acceptance of its safeguards \r\nagreements and their additional protocols, as the \r\ngenerally recognized standards of verification of \r\nGovernments’ compliance with their nuclear non-\r\nproliferation obligations. \r\n Russia is an active participant as a financial \r\ndonor in projects aimed at strengthening the IAEA’s \r\nsafeguards system, including by providing funding for \r\nimplementing national programmes of scientific and \r\ntechnical support for the Agency’s safety activities. We \r\nwholeheartedly support the IAEA’s efforts in the area \r\nof technical cooperation and the provision of \r\n A/66/PV.46\r\n \r\n27 11-57396 \r\n \r\nappropriate assistance to developing countries. One \r\nsuch example of international cooperation that was \r\nconducted successfully under the Agency’s auspices \r\nwas the completion of an international IAEA project on \r\ninnovative reactors and the nuclear fuel cycle, which \r\nRussia initiated. We are supporting the efforts of the \r\nIAEA secretariat in financing the project’s budget, and \r\nwe call on all countries taking part in the project to \r\nhelp provide direct financing for it as shareholders. The \r\nRussian Federation made the decision to provide long-\r\nterm funding for the project for the period 2008 to \r\n2012 in the amount of Rub 23 million annually. \r\n With regard to the large-scale development of \r\nnuclear energy, the Russian Federation is prioritizing \r\nthe following efforts: developing a new architecture for \r\npeaceful nuclear cooperation based on multilateral \r\napproaches to the nuclear fuel cycle, guaranteeing the \r\nprovision of services related to the nuclear fuel cycle, \r\nand finding solutions for issues relating to spent \r\nnuclear fuel and radioactive waste. Based on those \r\npriorities, Russia has launched an initiative for the \r\ndevelopment of a global nuclear energy infrastructure \r\nand the establishment of international centres for the \r\nprovision of nuclear-fuel-cycle services.  \r\n We note with satisfaction that this initiative has \r\nproved to be needed, and has genuinely contributed to \r\nresolving issues in providing unhindered access to the \r\nbenefits of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy for all \r\nStates parties to the NPT while complying in good faith \r\nwith their non-proliferation obligations. In practice it \r\ngives States the ability to take advantage of nuclear \r\nenergy and meet their needs for nuclear fuel without \r\nincurring high costs or the security risks relating to the \r\nproliferation of components of the nuclear fuel cycle. \r\nIn connection with that initiative we have, jointly with \r\nKazakhstan, Ukraine and Armenia, established in \r\nRussia an international centre for enriched uranium, in \r\nwhich all States are invited to participate in developing \r\nnuclear power in compliance with their non-proliferation \r\nobligations. \r\n Another important step in creating a global \r\nnuclear energy infrastructure has been the creation in \r\nRussia of guaranteed reserves of low-enriched uranium \r\nunder IAEA administration. It is already fully \r\noperational and can be used by States members of the \r\nAgency complying with their non-proliferation \r\nobligations. \r\n We firmly believe that it is essential that we learn \r\nthe lessons of the situation resulting from the accident \r\nat the Fukushima Daiichi 1 nuclear power plant in \r\norder to prevent its being repeated in the future. A \r\nthorough and professional analysis of the reasons and \r\nevolution of the accident and its results should be \r\nconducted under the auspices of the IAEA in its central \r\nrole as the sole international organization possessing \r\nthe necessary experience and authority. We welcome \r\nthe results of the sessions of the IAEA’s June \r\nministerial Conference on Nuclear Safety concerning \r\nthe power plant accident in Japan, and the participants’ \r\njoint declaration affirming the necessity of improving \r\nthe international legal framework, as well as \r\ntechnological and organizational aspects of nuclear \r\nsafety. The declaration echoes the proposals of the \r\nPresident of the Russian Federation concerning the \r\nelimination of discrepancies in the relevant \r\ninternational legal documents, such as addenda to the \r\nConvention on Nuclear Safety and the Convention on \r\nEarly Notification of a Nuclear Accident. Furthermore, \r\nRussia has also introduced proposals for improving the \r\nIAEA’s safety standards. We believe that our initiatives \r\nwill receive broad support and will be carried out. \r\n With regard to regional non-proliferation \r\nchallenges, we commend the IAEA’s practical \r\ncontribution to the multilateral search for ways of \r\nsolving them. We will provide appropriate support to \r\nthe Agency in its efforts to implement the relevant \r\nsafeguards agreements in Iran and Syria and make use \r\nof its expertise in order to establish a reliably \r\nfunctioning nuclear non-proliferation regime. Russia \r\nsees no alternative to political and diplomatic solutions \r\nto the situation concerning the nuclear programmes in \r\nIran and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to affirm our support \r\nfor the draft resolution on the report of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (A/66/L.6). As a \r\nsponsor, Russia fully agrees with the importance of the \r\nAgency’s work and is convinced that the Agency will \r\ncontinue to work towards the strengthening of \r\ninternational security and solving the problems of a \r\nreliable energy source. \r\n Ms. Kolontai (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): \r\nBelarus attaches great importance to the activities of \r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) as the \r\nleading international body working in the nuclear area, \r\nand welcomes the report of the Director General of the \r\nAgency, Mr. Yukiya Amano. \r\nA/66/PV.46  \r\n \r\n11-57396 28 \r\n \r\n As a founding member State of the Agency, \r\nBelarus feels that it has a vested interest in the IAEA’s \r\nactive work in fostering the peaceful and safe use of \r\nnuclear energy and does all that it can to contribute to \r\nattaining those aims. We consider that the IAEA’s \r\nTechnical Cooperation Programme is an important tool \r\nfor the Agency in achieving those aims. In accordance \r\nwith the structure of Belarus’s programme for \r\n2008-2013, the basic priorities of our country’s \r\ntechnical cooperation, conducted jointly with the \r\nIAEA, are the development of a national nuclear \r\nenergy infrastructure, the use of nuclear technologies \r\nin health care and the restoration of areas afflicted as a \r\nresult of the Chernobyl atomic power plant accident. \r\n In 2008, the Republic of Belarus made the \r\ndecision to launch a national nuclear power \r\nprogramme. The preparations for building an atomic \r\npower station are being implemented in close \r\ncoordination with the Agency. Belarus will soon \r\nembark on the practical phase of construction of the \r\npower station. In realizing this complicated project, \r\nBelarus will continue to comply firmly and rigorously \r\nwith its international nuclear obligations and to abide \r\nby international security norms and standards. In order \r\nto complete the nuclear power plant project, we in \r\nBelarus are developing the necessary infrastructure, \r\npreparing legal framework and actively training \r\npersonnel. That work is being carried out in a thorough \r\nand transparent manner by drawing on the expertise of \r\nthe IAEA, as well as on that of other States with broad \r\nexperience in the sphere of nuclear energy. The \r\nTechnical Assistance Programme of the IAEA is also \r\nplaying an important role in this process.  \r\n The twenty-fifth anniversary of the Chernobyl \r\naccident and the recent tragic events following the \r\npowerful earthquake in Japan underscore the urgency \r\nof strengthening the regimes for nuclear and \r\nradiological safety. For Belarus, nuclear safety is not a \r\ntheoretical concept. We consider the matter of nuclear \r\nsafety an undisputed priority. That approach is written \r\ninto our national laws and built into our current \r\npractice. Together with the IAEA, Belarus is working \r\nto ensure nuclear safety.  \r\n As an example of that cooperation, we are \r\nbeginning to implement an integrated plan that \r\nprovides for physical nuclear safety in the Republic of \r\nBelarus. The implementation of that plan would be an \r\nexemplary contribution on the part of Belarus towards \r\ndeveloping an international regime for physical nuclear \r\nsafety. However, we do not plan to stop there in our \r\ncooperation activities aimed at ensuring nuclear safety. \r\n Today, we face the challenge of re-establishing \r\ntrust in nuclear energy, which without a doubt requires \r\nsolutions that will enable us to raise the quality of \r\nnuclear safety to a higher level. That aim can be \r\nachieved only if we work closely with IAEA member \r\nStates and other organizations and partners through \r\neffective coordination of our efforts in a sustained \r\nspirit of transparency and cooperation. We are \r\nconvinced that IAEA should continue to play a \r\nleadership role in the process of reforming its \r\ninternational nuclear safety regime and reaction \r\nmechanisms to deal with abnormal nuclear situations. \r\n  The meeting rose at 1 p.m. \r\n"
