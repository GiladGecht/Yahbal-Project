(Qatar) \r\n \r\n \r\n In the absence of the President, Ms. Kamara \r\n(Liberia), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 86 (continued) \r\n \r\nReport of the International Atomic Energy Agency \r\n \r\n  Note by the Secretary-General (A/66/95) \r\n \r\n  Draft resolution (A/66/L.6) \r\n \r\n The Acting President: Members will recall that \r\nthe Assembly considered item 86 at its 46th plenary \r\nmeeting on 1 November. We shall now hear the \r\nremaining speakers. \r\n Mr. Shin Dong Ik (Republic of Korea): At the \r\noutset, allow me to thank Director General Yukiya \r\nAmano for presenting the 2010 annual report of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) (see \r\nA/66/95) and for his statement (see A/66/PV.46), which \r\nprovides additional information on the past year’s \r\ndevelopments in the Agency’s activities. I would also \r\nlike to express our appreciation to the Director General \r\nand to the secretariat of the IAEA for their dedication \r\nand professionalism in carrying out the statutory \r\nmandates of the IAEA. \r\n The IAEA plays a vital role in accelerating and \r\nenlarging the contribution of atomic energy to peace, \r\nhealth and prosperity throughout the world. Those \r\nmandates are subject to ever-increasing demands and \r\nnew challenges, ranging from the risks of nuclear \r\nproliferation and nuclear terrorism to nuclear safety, as \r\nshown by the Fukushima accident. To meet those \r\nchallenges and demands, we are of the view that the \r\nIAEA should be equipped with the appropriate \r\nresources to maintain its capacity.  \r\n I would like to comment on several topics \r\ncovered in the report that are important to my \r\ndelegation, namely, safeguards and nuclear safety and \r\nsecurity. The report shows that the international \r\nnuclear community maintained a high level of safe \r\nperformance in 2010. The nuclear incident at \r\nFukushima, however, sent an unmistakable signal to \r\nthe international community that we cannot afford to \r\nremain complacent when it comes to nuclear safety. In \r\nthat regard, we welcome the adoption, by this year’s \r\nGeneral Conference of the IAEA, of the Action Plan on \r\nNuclear Safety, which outlines practical measures to \r\nstrengthen the global nuclear safety framework in \r\n12 key areas. We look forward to its effective \r\nimplementation through the full cooperation and \r\nparticipation of Member States. Properly implemented, \r\nthose measures and the lessons learned from the \r\nFukushima accident will serve to enhance global \r\nnuclear safety and promote the sustainable \r\ndevelopment of nuclear energy.  \r\n The work of the IAEA in the field of nuclear \r\nsecurity, particularly the efforts to coordinate and \r\nenhance cooperation among various initiatives and \r\nactivities, is also noteworthy. However, the threat of \r\nterrorism is real. Indeed, as evidenced by the IAEA \r\nIllicit Trafficking Database, 172 incidents were \r\nreported during the one-year period ending in June. \r\nThose include 14 cases of unauthorized possession \r\nA/66/PV.48  \r\n \r\n11-57701 2 \r\n \r\nand/or attempts to sell or smuggle nuclear material or \r\nradioactive sources. In that connection, the Republic of \r\nKorea remains committed to improving nuclear \r\nsecurity through its contributions to the IAEA Nuclear \r\nSecurity Fund and its support for the relevant legal \r\ninstruments and international activities.  \r\n In March 2012, the Republic of Korea will host \r\nthe second Nuclear Security Summit. The 2012 Seoul \r\nSummit will provide an excellent opportunity to review \r\nthe commitments made at the Summit held in \r\nWashington, D.C., in 2010, assess existing nuclear \r\nsecurity practices and challenges, and consider ways \r\nand means for realizing a stronger, more cohesive and \r\nresponsive global nuclear security regime. While \r\nrecognizing the central role of the IAEA in that field, \r\nthe Seoul Summit will try to maximize the synergies \r\namong various initiatives and activities to keep nuclear \r\nmaterials and related facilities in safe hands. We look \r\nforward to a successful outcome and request the \r\ncooperation and support of the international \r\ncommunity to that end.  \r\n We highly appreciate the comprehensive report \r\nreleased by the Director General early in September on \r\nthe application of safeguards in the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea (GOV/2011/53-\r\nGC(55)/24), the first of its kind in the history of the \r\nIAEA’s dealings with the North Korean nuclear issue. \r\nThe report is all the more meaningful as the Agency \r\nhas provided an analysis of the uranium enrichment \r\nprogramme of the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea for the first time since it was discovered in \r\nNovember 2010. The report states that that country’s \r\nnuclear programme is a matter of serious concern and \r\nthat information about the construction of a new \r\nuranium enrichment facility and a light-water reactor \r\nare deeply troubling.  \r\n Moreover, the report emphasizes that the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea has not \r\nabandoned its existing nuclear programme, contrary to \r\nthe provisions of Security Council resolutions 1718 \r\n(2006) and 1874 (2009), and underlines that the \r\ncountry’s uranium enrichment programme therefore \r\nclearly violates those resolutions. In the current climate \r\nof dialogue, we look forward to the Agency resuming \r\nan active role in the process of the denuclearization of \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. \r\n In addition, we welcome the unanimous adoption \r\nof the resolution on the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea (GC(55)/RES/13) at the fifty-fifth IAEA \r\nGeneral Conference, especially as it marks the first \r\ntime that the international organization has condemned \r\nthe country’s uranium enrichment programme since it \r\nwas discovered. The resolution expresses concern \r\nregarding the country’s claimed uranium enrichment \r\nprogramme and light-water reactor construction and \r\ncalls on the country to fully comply with the Treaty on \r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and \r\nto promptly cooperate with the IAEA in the full and \r\neffective implementation of IAEA comprehensive \r\nsafeguards. In that context, we strongly urge the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea once again to \r\nabandon all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear \r\nprogrammes and to immediately cease all related \r\nactivities, including its uranium enrichment \r\nprogramme. \r\n We take note of the entry into force of the \r\ncomprehensive safeguards agreement in five States and \r\nof additional protocols in 10 States during 2010. It is \r\nencouraging to hear that 110 States have already \r\nratified the additional protocol. We urge other Member \r\nStates that have not yet done so to conclude and bring \r\ninto force the comprehensive safeguards agreement and \r\nits additional protocol. \r\n In full support of the work of the IAEA, and with \r\na view to achieving our common goal of harnessing \r\nnuclear energy in the service of peace and development \r\nfor humanity, the Republic of Korea is pleased to \r\nsponsor the draft resolution (A/66/L.6) on the report of \r\nthe IAEA.  \r\n Mr. Abdelaziz (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): I would \r\nfirst like to extend my thanks to the Director General \r\nof the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), \r\nMr. Yukiya Amano, for his presentation. I would like to \r\nunderline that Egypt has become a sponsor of draft \r\nresolution A/66/L.6. \r\n International crises in the fields of energy and \r\nclimate change pose constraints on the growing energy \r\nneeds of the developing world in terms of quantity and \r\nquality. The IAEA report (see A/66/95) demonstrates \r\nthe continued importance, amid those challenges, of \r\nnuclear technology for electricity generation and points \r\nout that 60 countries have so far expressed an interest \r\nin exploring the use of nuclear energy. Many of those \r\nStates will begin operating their first reactors by 2030. \r\nThat attests to the growing interest in the inalienable \r\nright to acquire and use nuclear technologies for \r\n A/66/PV.48\r\n \r\n3 11-57701 \r\n \r\npeaceful purposes, in accordance with article IV of the \r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \r\n(NPT). That right was further reiterated in the Final \r\nDocument of the 2010 NPT Review Conference \r\n(NPT/CONF.2010/50 (Vol. I)), which emphasized the \r\nimportance of respecting the decisions and policies of \r\nnon-nuclear-weapon States regarding their plans to use \r\nnuclear energy for their development needs and for the \r\npeaceful use of nuclear energy in the implementation \r\nof such plans, without any constraints and through \r\ninternational cooperation on the necessary nuclear \r\ntechnologies and materials. \r\n The timetable of Egypt’s nuclear energy \r\nprogramme has continued to evolve and to be assessed, \r\nas Egypt undergoes fundamental transformation, to \r\nallow the consideration of recent lessons learned from \r\nother countries’ experiences as we continue to make \r\nprogress in the implementation of this national project, \r\nworking on achieving its legitimate goals and \r\nresponding to our development needs. Egypt looks \r\nforward to further cooperation with the IAEA, given \r\nthe Agency’s growing role in supporting the \r\nsustainable development of its non-nuclear-weapon \r\nmember States that are party to the NPT, and in light of \r\nits role in facilitating their access to nuclear energy and \r\nresponding to their needs in that important area. \r\n Egypt remains at the forefront of countries that \r\nhave provided unlimited support to the IAEA since its \r\nestablishment; it has continued that support to date, \r\nbased on its belief in the value of the IAEA’s role in \r\nnuclear non-proliferation and in promoting the \r\npeaceful use of nuclear energy to support the ambitions \r\nand global needs of developing countries in a wide \r\nrange of areas.  \r\n States party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty \r\nensure compliance with the comprehensive safeguards \r\nregime of the IAEA, which remains a major pillar of \r\nthe non-proliferation system, through the Agency’s \r\nverification and strengthening mechanisms. \r\nNevertheless, that regime has yet to be fully effective \r\nas it lacks universality, especially in the Middle East \r\nregion. Intensified international efforts are necessary to \r\nensure implementation of the comprehensive \r\nsafeguards system in all countries of the region without \r\nexception. \r\n Significant progress is necessary to achieve a \r\nglobal comprehensive safeguards system, universality \r\nof the NPT and the accession to the NPT, as \r\nnon-nuclear-weapon States, of three countries that \r\nremain outside the Treaty. That would encourage \r\nnon-nuclear States to make further commitments and \r\nthus reinforce the NPT regime in a balanced and \r\nnon-discriminatory manner both at regional and \r\ninternational levels. \r\n At the regional level, all of the countries of the \r\nMiddle East are in compliance with their obligations \r\nunder the IAEA comprehensive safeguards system, \r\nexcept Israel, whose opaque nuclear activities have \r\nremained outside any international control, while it has \r\ncontinued to ignore dozens of appeals and international \r\nresolutions demanding its accession to the NPT as a \r\nnon-nuclear-weapon State and the submission of all of \r\nits nuclear facilities to the full scope of the IAEA \r\nsafeguards. There is no doubt that this continuing \r\nsituation increases the risk of nuclear proliferation in \r\nthe Middle East and hinders the establishment of a \r\nnuclear-weapon-free zone in the region. \r\n In that regard, Egypt believes that the conference \r\non the establishment of a zone free of nuclear weapons \r\nand other weapons of mass destruction in the Middle \r\nEast, to be convened in 2012, will offer promising \r\nprospects for concrete progress. In that context, Egypt \r\nlooks forward to the background documents to be \r\nprepared by the IAEA in accordance with the fourth \r\naction plan adopted at the 2010 Review Conference. \r\nMy country welcomes the seminar convened by the \r\nEuropean Union on 6 and 7 July on supporting the \r\nestablishment of a zone free of nuclear weapons and \r\nother weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East. \r\nThe IAEA Forum on Experience of Possible Relevance \r\nto the Creation of a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in the \r\nMiddle East, to be held on 21 and 22 November, \r\nrepresents an additional opportunity to contribute to, \r\nrather than replace, the substantive preparations in \r\nsupport of the 2012 conference set to take place under \r\nthe auspices of the Secretary-General, pursuant to \r\nparagraph 7 (a) of part I, section IV, of the Final \r\nDocument of the 2010 NPT Review Conference \r\n(NPT/CONF.2010/50 (Vol.I)). \r\n The year 2011 witnessed the earthquake and \r\ntsunami disasters that caused the Fukushima nuclear \r\npower plant accident in March. Egypt reiterates its \r\nsolidarity with the people of Japan in dealing with the \r\neffects of that disaster, and its willingness to provide \r\nassistance to any country facing a similar accident. \r\nLessons must be drawn from the accident, which has \r\nshown the importance of the IAEA’s central role in \r\nA/66/PV.48  \r\n \r\n11-57701 4 \r\n \r\nmatters relating to nuclear safety, including by \r\nassisting member States, at their request, in capacity-\r\nbuilding and infrastructure, as well as in providing \r\nexpertise and advice and in strengthening the nuclear \r\nsafety culture in all parts of the world, while seeking to \r\nformulate comprehensive, progressive nuclear safety \r\nstandards to be agreed by Member States in a gradual, \r\ncomprehensive and transparent manner. \r\n In that context, Egypt attaches great importance \r\nto the promotion of international cooperation aimed at \r\nstrengthening national capacities in the field of nuclear \r\nsafety and enabling them to respond to nuclear and \r\nradiological emergencies, in particular through the free \r\nflow of information and the transfer without prejudice \r\nof relevant technology. In accordance with its Statute, \r\nthe IAEA should seek to assist member States with \r\nemergency preparedness and response to nuclear \r\naccidents, through capacity-building, including \r\neducation and training in crisis management and \r\ntechnology transfer. \r\n Those important issues were considered by the \r\nIAEA ministerial conference on nuclear safety held in \r\nVienna in July 2011, which provided a forum for \r\npreliminary assessment of the Fukushima nuclear \r\naccident and for exchanging views on lessons learned \r\naimed at further strengthening the framework on \r\nnuclear safety, emergency preparedness and response \r\nmechanisms. It also helped to launch a process — in \r\nwhich Egypt participated actively — that resulted in \r\nthe adoption of the action plan of the outcome of the \r\n2010 NPT Review. In the same vein, the high-level \r\nmeeting convened by the Secretary-General on \r\n22 September in New York was valuable in \r\nhighlighting once again this important subject as well \r\nas the crucial role of the IAEA in this area. \r\n Regarding nuclear security, the Seoul Summit to \r\nbe held in March 2012 will serve as an opportunity to \r\nfocus on the important issue of the security of nuclear \r\nmaterials and preventing them from falling into the \r\nhands of terrorists, complementing the other \r\nframeworks, including Security Council resolution \r\n1540 (2004). On the other hand, the crucial role of the \r\nIAEA in the field of nuclear security must be anchored. \r\nAny guidelines or advice on nuclear security should be \r\ndeveloped and negotiated in multilateral frameworks; \r\nand any initiatives and measures to enhance nuclear \r\nsecurity and safety must not be used as a pretext for \r\nrestricting the inalienable right of developing countries \r\nto develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.  \r\n In that regard, Egypt reiterates its concern about \r\nthe continued imposition of unwarranted restrictions on \r\nexports to developing countries of material, equipment \r\nand technology that will be used for peaceful purposes. \r\nEgypt emphasizes especially the responsibility of those \r\ncountries that are advanced in the nuclear field to \r\nrespond positively to the needs of developing countries \r\nwith respect to peaceful uses of nuclear power, by \r\nallowing them to participate to the maximum extent \r\npossible in the transfer of equipment, materials, \r\nscientific information and nuclear technology and \r\nenabling them to derive the greatest benefits within \r\ntheir sustainable development strategies. \r\n In the field of technical cooperation, Egypt will \r\ncontinue to exchange experiences with countries in the \r\nArab region and the African continent, because it \r\nbelieves in the importance of international cooperation \r\nactivities in the field of peaceful use of nuclear energy. \r\nIn that regard, Egypt stresses that priority must be \r\ngiven to the Agency’s activities in the field of technical \r\ncooperation, with the aim of enabling Egypt and other \r\ndeveloping countries to benefit from the use of nuclear \r\ntechnologies in various sectors including health, \r\nagriculture, food and water resources and radioisotope \r\ntechnology. Thus, we reaffirm the importance of \r\nsecuring and increasing funding for international \r\ncooperation which is one of the main pillars of the \r\nwork of the Agency, in accordance with its Statute.  \r\n Egypt also renews its determination to intensify \r\nand expand cooperation with the IAEA with the aim of \r\nstrengthening our national capacities in the field of \r\npeaceful uses of nuclear technology and to benefit from \r\nthe full support of the Agency for our national efforts \r\nin efforts. \r\n Mr. Onemola (Nigeria): I thank the Director \r\nGeneral of the International Atomic Energy Agency \r\n(IAEA) for his statement on the work of the Agency in \r\nthe past year. \r\n I would also like to convey my country’s \r\nappreciation for the initiatives of Secretary-General \r\nBan Ki-moon with regard to the effort to prevent future \r\ntragedies at nuclear facilities by strengthening the \r\ncapacity of the IAEA to promote nuclear safety and \r\nsecurity and to enhance cooperation among \r\ninternational organizations, particularly in the areas of \r\nemergency response and information-sharing. We have \r\nno doubt that the high-level meeting on nuclear safety \r\nand security held on the margins of the general debate \r\n A/66/PV.48\r\n \r\n5 11-57701 \r\n \r\non 22 September will help build the political will \r\nneeded to confront those challenges. \r\n We commend Director General Amano and his \r\nteam for delivering on the Agency’s mandate in the \r\nareas of technical cooperation and nuclear safety, \r\nsafeguards and security, despite numerous constraints, \r\nincluding in financial resources. Nigeria appreciates \r\nand commends their tireless efforts. We are delighted \r\nthat the IAEA continues to contribute immensely to the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, while \r\nensuring that humanity derives the maximum benefit \r\nfrom nuclear science and technology in a safe and \r\nsecure environment. \r\n The tragic Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power \r\nplant accident in Japan has provoked global debate \r\nabout the rationality of nuclear power. It has also led to \r\na review of various measures that have been taken with \r\nregard to our common agenda of ensuring the safe and \r\nsecure use of nuclear science and technology, as well \r\nas of ways of strengthening the Agency so as to deal \r\nwith current and future challenges and enhance its \r\ncapacity to further deliver the full benefits inherent in \r\nnuclear technology. \r\n In that regard, I want to express my appreciation \r\nfor the prompt and insightful initiatives of the Director \r\nGeneral, including his decision to convene the June \r\nMinisterial Conference on Nuclear Safety and put \r\ntogether the resulting Action Plan, which has already \r\nbeen endorsed at the Agency’s fifty-fifth General \r\nConference in September, as well as at the high-level \r\nmeeting held here the same month. We expect that the \r\nimplementation of the Action Plan and other measures \r\nat both the national and regional levels, informed by \r\nthe lessons of the Fukushima accident, will go a long \r\nway towards addressing concerns about insecurity and \r\nrestoring confidence in nuclear technology. \r\n In spite of the apprehensions raised by the \r\nFukushima accident, Nigeria remains convinced that \r\nnuclear technology, safely and responsibly applied, can \r\nfacilitate the attainment of our energy development \r\ngoals and those of other Millennium Development \r\nGoals, and therefore has a vital role to play in serving \r\nhumankind’s immediate needs. The introduction of \r\nnuclear-powered electricity into our national energy \r\nmix is high on the Nigerian Government’s \r\ntransformational agenda. We are working closely with \r\nthe IAEA towards that goal, while honouring the \r\nattendant obligations to ensure safety and security. \r\nThat is why for us in Nigeria, transparency in handling \r\nthe information coming out of the Fukushima accident \r\nand the lessons learned from it are important, as they \r\nwill help us to avoid dangerous pitfalls. \r\n My delegation notes with satisfaction the \r\nAgency’s phenomenal achievements in the application \r\nof nuclear technology in the area of food and \r\nagriculture, including its role in collaborating with the \r\nFood and Agriculture Organization, the World \r\nOrganization for Animal Health, the African Union and \r\nother strategic partners in the total eradication of the \r\ndeadly cattle disease known as rinderpest. We \r\nencourage the Agency to continue in its efforts to assist \r\nits member States in applying that technology to the \r\ndiagnosis and control of other transboundary animal \r\ndiseases, and ultimately to the promotion of food \r\nsecurity. The focus at the fifty-fifth General \r\nConference on the application of nuclear techniques to \r\nprospecting for and managing water was very timely, \r\nbecause it addressed one of humankind’s current needs \r\nin both developed and developing countries. \r\n We also appreciate the priority the Agency has \r\ngiven to cancer control in developing countries and its \r\ncommitment to helping Member States to fight that \r\nscourge. We urge the Agency to increase its support to \r\nAfrican countries in the areas of cancer therapy and \r\nmanpower development, through its Programme of \r\nAction for Cancer Therapy (PACT). We welcome the \r\nassistance rendered to Member States through the \r\nProgramme’s imPACT reviews, which assess countries’ \r\nreadiness to develop long-term radiation medicine \r\ncapacity-building plans as part of a national cancer \r\ncontrol programme. \r\n Nigeria’s health sector has benefited from the \r\nAgency’s cooperation in capacity and infrastructure \r\ndevelopment for cancer control and management, \r\nthrough advances in nuclear medicine and \r\nradiotherapy, radio-oncology and nuclear medicine \r\ntechnology. Through such cooperation, 10 nuclear \r\nmedicine facilities are to be built, between 2010 and \r\n2016, and equipped in tertiary hospitals across the \r\ncountry, through national funding. It is our expectation \r\nthat our national programmes will continue to benefit \r\nfrom the Agency’s Programme of Action for Cancer \r\nTherapy. \r\n On technical cooperation, we would like to note \r\nthat the Agency’s Technical Cooperation Programme \r\nhas continued to make an invaluable contribution to the \r\nA/66/PV.48  \r\n \r\n11-57701 6 \r\n \r\nefforts of Member States in addressing national \r\ndevelopment priorities and leveraging the comparative \r\nadvantages of nuclear techniques. We welcome the \r\nincrease in new resources reported by the Director \r\nGeneral in his report, as well as the contributions of the \r\nUnited States and other donors under the Peaceful Uses \r\nInitiative, launched in 2010. I would like to encourage \r\nother Member States in a position to make extra \r\nbudgetary contributions to join that United States \r\ninitiative. \r\n While the IAEA continues to coordinate \r\nmultilateral efforts to ensure nuclear safety and \r\nsecurity, we believe that the primary responsibility \r\nrests with Member States. In recognition of that \r\nprinciple, and in appreciation of the fact that with the \r\nbenefits of nuclear technology come responsibilities, \r\nthe Government of Nigeria has continued to build \r\ncapacity, as well as to strengthen the requisite \r\ninstitutional framework. \r\n In September, just two months ago, the Nigeria \r\nAtomic Energy Commission, the national focal agency \r\nfor atomic energy development, was reconstituted as an \r\nindependent and self-accounting agency. Furthermore, \r\nthe Nigeria Nuclear Regulatory Authority is being \r\nstrengthened to regulate our new nuclear power \r\nprogramme. In the area of nuclear waste management, \r\nwhich is key to the success of any national nuclear \r\npower programme, Nigeria, with a wide range of IAEA \r\ntechnical support in the areas of project design and \r\nimplementation, has begun developing facilities for the \r\ncomprehensive management of low- and intermediate-\r\nlevel radioactive wastes at the Nuclear Technology \r\nCentre at Sheda, in Abuja. \r\n I would like to reaffirm Nigeria’s commitment to \r\nthe basic tenets of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \r\nof Nuclear Weapons (NPT), and to assure the Assembly \r\nthat our national nuclear power programme will \r\ncontinue to be purely for peaceful purposes, geared to \r\nthe enhancement of the living standards of the peoples \r\nof Nigeria, and will remain within the framework of \r\nverifiable safeguards. \r\n The NPT remains a pillar for keeping our world \r\nsafe from nuclear holocaust. The role of the IAEA in \r\npromoting a safer world remains pivotal. Nigeria \r\ntherefore appreciates the initiative of the Director \r\nGeneral in holding a forum this month to reinvigorate \r\nthe creation of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the \r\nMiddle East. We also look forward to the 2012 Seoul \r\nNuclear Security Summit, as a forum vital to taking \r\npolitical decisions at the highest level on securing \r\nnuclear materials away from unauthorized end users. \r\n In conclusion, I wish to reiterate Nigeria’s \r\nsupport for and abiding faith in the IAEA, and our \r\nconfidence in its leadership in putting the benefits of \r\nthe atom within the reach of all in a safer and secure \r\nworld. \r\n Mr. Al Habib (Islamic Republic of Iran): Today \r\nnuclear technology, as the common heritage of \r\nhumankind, has yielded peaceful applications in \r\nnumerous fields, ranging from medicine, food and \r\nagriculture to providing a cost-effective, \r\nenvironmentally friendly and climatically benign \r\nsource of energy, and has thus played a significant role \r\nin the advancement of human society. Taking into \r\naccount that the International Atomic Energy Agency \r\n(IAEA), according to its Statute, should accelerate and \r\nenlarge the contribution of atomic energy to peace, \r\nhealth and prosperity, we underline its prime \r\nresponsibility to assist member States, including by \r\nfacilitating technology transfer and increasing their \r\nscientific and technological capabilities. \r\n The inalienable right to the peaceful use of \r\nnuclear technology, without discrimination, constitutes \r\nthe very foundation of the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). This is \r\nset out in its article IV, in which States parties \r\nundertake to facilitate the fullest possible exchange of \r\nequipment, materials and scientific and technological \r\ninformation for the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. We \r\nemphasize that such an inalienable right shall not be \r\nrestricted under any circumstances, including through \r\nulterior outside political considerations. At the same \r\ntime we are of the view that the implementation of \r\nrelated provisions of the NPT and the statute of the \r\nIAEA requires a realistic and balanced approach. Such \r\nan approach, by providing incentives for membership \r\nand compliance, can guarantee the longevity, integrity \r\nand credibility of the NPT. \r\n Unfortunately, developed States parties to the \r\nNPT, the main suppliers of nuclear high technology, \r\nhave given rise to two dangerous impressions by \r\ncontinuing to apply a discriminatory, selective, highly \r\nrestrictive and politically motivated approach in their \r\nnuclear cooperation with developing States parties. \r\nFirst, being a party to the NPT and the IAEA \r\nsafeguards agreement does not facilitate nuclear \r\n A/66/PV.48\r\n \r\n7 11-57701 \r\n \r\ncooperation but rather impedes it, and therefore it is \r\nnot a privilege. Secondly, States not parties to the \r\nTreaty are more richly and generously rewarded \r\nthrough nuclear cooperation. \r\n It is a source of grave concern that those who \r\nhave chosen not to accede to the NPT not only are not \r\nsubject to any pressure to do so but are also \r\nencouraged and rewarded in different ways. A living \r\nexample is the well-documented assistance and \r\ncooperation provided by certain Western countries — \r\nin particular the United States and the two nuclear-\r\nweapon States members of the European Union, the \r\nUnited Kingdom and France — to the Israeli regime, \r\nwhich, in addition to having an unsafeguarded nuclear \r\nprogramme, possesses one of the world’s largest \r\nstockpiles of nuclear weapons. That of course is a clear \r\ncase of non-compliance by those NPT States parties \r\nwith their legal obligations under the Treaty. Indeed, \r\nsuch double standards and discriminatory and \r\nparadoxical policies are contrary to the letter and spirit \r\nas well as the universality of the NPT and only \r\nundermine the integrity of the Treaty. \r\n Recalling the importance of the IAEA’s \r\nresponsibilities in promoting the peaceful uses of \r\nnuclear technology and energy, as well as its role as the \r\nsole competent body for verification activities in \r\naccordance with its Statute and the NPT, we strongly \r\nemphasize the need to avoid the use of extralegal \r\nunilateral measures and attempts to use the Agency as \r\nan instrument in support of shortsighted political \r\ninterests, as they only undermine the authority and \r\ncredibility of the IAEA. Unfortunately, over the past \r\ndecade a few Western countries have pursued a \r\nselective and politically motivated approach towards \r\nthe verification activities of the IAEA. By calling it a \r\nwatchdog organization, they attempt to imply that the \r\nIAEA is solely a verification tool and has no other \r\nmandate. \r\n In this context, and recalling that the IAEA \r\nstatute stipulates that the Agency should conduct its \r\nactivities in a way that furthers the establishment of \r\nsafeguarded worldwide disarmament, I would like to \r\nreiterate that one of the neglected tasks of the IAEA is \r\nengagement in the nuclear disarmament process. \r\n The Islamic Republic of Iran is extremely proud \r\nand highly honoured that, thanks to the activities of its \r\ncourageous young nuclear scientists and despite all \r\nforeign-backed plots and plans, it has been able to \r\nexercise its inalienable right to peaceful uses of nuclear \r\nenergy. Iran is fully committed to its legal obligations, \r\nand its nuclear activities are, and have always been, \r\nexclusively for peaceful purposes. Despite all external \r\npolitical pressure on the IAEA, it has repeatedly \r\nconfirmed the non-diversion of nuclear materials and \r\nthe peaceful nature of the Iranian nuclear programme. \r\n Finally, I would like to underline that from a legal \r\npoint of view, the IAEA should verify only declared \r\nnuclear material. The recent report by the IAEA \r\nDirector General on the Implementation of the NPT \r\nSafeguards Agreement in Iran states that the Agency \r\ncontinues to verify the non-diversion of declared \r\nnuclear material at the nuclear facilities and at \r\nlocations outside facilities where nuclear material is \r\ncustomarily used, declared by Iran under its safeguards \r\nagreement. It is regrettable that the IAEA Director \r\nGeneral, in his statement yesterday (see A/66/PV.46), \r\nmade reference to all nuclear materials — which is \r\nlegally incorrect. \r\n Mr. Osman (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I would like to extend our thanks to the Director \r\nGeneral of the International Atomic Energy Agency \r\n(IAEA) for presenting the Agency’s annual report to \r\nthe General Assembly (see A/66/95). We commend the \r\nIAEA programmes and plans outlined in the report, \r\nwhich are designed to improve the transfer of \r\ntechnology for peaceful purposes, maintain an \r\ninternational system of nuclear security and bolster the \r\nsafety of nuclear facilities.  The report emphasizes the \r\nimportant role the Agency plays, particularly in the \r\nfield of cooperation in the use of nuclear technology \r\nfor peaceful purposes and development.  \r\n We would like to commend the work of the \r\nprevious Director General, Mr. Mohamed ElBaradei, \r\nand we wish his successor, Mr. Yukiya Amano, every \r\nsuccess. \r\n The Sudan attaches great importance to the \r\ncontents of the report on the applications of nuclear \r\ntechnology in fostering food security, controlling \r\ninsects and effectively managing water resources, as \r\nwell as in modern irrigation systems and large-scale \r\nagricultural projects. From that perspective, improving \r\nthe cooperation between the Agency and UNICEF on \r\nagricultural and educational enterprises, and with the \r\nWorld Health Organization, becomes increasingly \r\nimportant.  \r\nA/66/PV.48  \r\n \r\n11-57701 8 \r\n \r\n Assisting developing countries to improve their \r\nrespective national technical systems complements the \r\nefforts of the Agency to implement its plans and \r\ntechnical cooperation programmes. We hope that \r\ncooperation will improve within the framework of the \r\nAgency’s health programmes in order to revive and \r\nsupport continental and regional projects aimed at \r\nfighting insect carriers of malaria and other lethal \r\ndiseases affecting Africans, and thus to enable the \r\ncontinent to successfully achieve its socio-economic \r\ndevelopment programmes, in particular the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) and the internationally \r\nagreed economic agenda. \r\n The Sudanese delegation emphasizes the right of \r\nall States, including my country, to improve research \r\nand production of nuclear energy for peaceful \r\npurposes, without discrimination and in accordance \r\nwith international terms of reference and commitments.  \r\n My delegation would like also to stress the need \r\nfor States to refrain from putting pressure on the \r\nAgency or interfering with its activities, in order to \r\npreserve the Agency’s credibility and its vital role. In \r\nthat context, we call for justice and equity in tackling \r\nsome of the outstanding issues involving some States, \r\nthrough dialogue and negotiations, with a view to \r\nreaching appropriate solutions. \r\n Moreover, the delegation of the Sudan reiterates \r\nits firm position in supporting the aspirations of all \r\ngeographical regions to declare themselves free from \r\nnuclear weapons, in accordance with the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), which \r\nconstitutes one of the main pillars in the international \r\npeace and security system. On that basis, we feel \r\nconcerned by the fact that the Middle East region has \r\nfor many decades, remained far from achieving that \r\ngoal, due to opposition by Israel — the only country in \r\nthe region than possesses nuclear weapons — and its \r\nrefusal to place its nuclear programmes under the \r\ncomprehensive IAEA safeguards regime, in addition to \r\nits continuous disregard for the appeals and repeated \r\ninitiations made by the international community in that \r\nmatter. Israel’s adherence to the Treaty and its \r\nAdditional Protocol are vital factors for eliminating the \r\ntension experienced in the region and could lead to \r\nstrengthened regional security and the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security.  \r\n My country is equally enthusiastic in its hope that \r\nthe Agency will continue to support the right of \r\ndeveloping countries to the peaceful use of nuclear \r\nenergy, along with the Agency’s monitoring of such \r\nactivities. It is our conviction that the production of \r\nnuclear energy for peaceful purposes would lead to a \r\nconsiderable surge in efforts towards development, \r\ngiven the low cost of electricity produced through \r\nnuclear energy as compared to other energy sources. \r\nThe rising cost of alternative energy sources will force \r\ndeveloping countries to look for faster and more \r\npracticable means to solve their problems of energy \r\nshortage.  \r\n The Sudan is persuaded that greater cooperation \r\nand support by developed countries for developing \r\ncountries in the field of alternative energy sources \r\nwould lessen the risk of resort to nuclear energy. We \r\nthink that it is logical for the IAEA to encourage \r\ndeveloped countries to work side by side with \r\ndeveloping countries on that matter.  \r\n In that connection, my delegation welcomes the \r\nefforts of the Agency and of many developed countries \r\nto foster cooperation with the African States in the use \r\nof nuclear energy in the medical and health sectors, as \r\nwell as on alternative energy projects in an effective \r\nmanner conducive to achieving the MDGs. \r\n Mr. Cassidy (Indonesia): Allow me first to \r\nwarmly welcome our fellow country member of the \r\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the \r\nLao People’s Democratic Republic, as a new member \r\nof the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). \r\nThis now increases the IAEA members from ASEAN \r\ncountries to nine. Indonesia stands ready to cooperate \r\nclosely and to share its experience with the Lao \r\nPeople’s Democratic Republic in many areas of nuclear \r\ncooperation. \r\n On this occasion, we would like to express our \r\nsupport to the Director General for the way in which he \r\nhas been carrying out his responsibilities at the IAEA, \r\nwhich has led to more weight being given to the \r\nAgency’s technical role. We were delighted by his visit \r\nto Jakarta from 6 to 9 October. Apart from holding \r\nimportant meetings with major national stakeholders \r\nand visiting our nuclear facilities, in our capacity as the \r\nChair of ASEAN, we also facilitated his visit to the \r\nASEAN secretariat, where he met with its \r\nrepresentatives and those of the Council of Permanent \r\nRepresentatives. It is our profound hope that such \r\nvisits will strengthen IAEA cooperation, not only with \r\nIndonesia but also with ASEAN. \r\n A/66/PV.48\r\n \r\n9 11-57701 \r\n \r\n We express our sympathy to the people and \r\nGovernment of Japan over the unfortunate events that \r\ntook place in March involving the Fukushima Daiichi \r\nnuclear power plant. We also express our admiration \r\nand respect for the tremendous courage and resilience \r\nshown by the Japanese emergency team in getting the \r\nfacility back under control. As an expression of \r\nIndonesian solidarity with the people and Government \r\nof Japan, the Indonesian Nuclear Regulatory Agency, \r\napart from sending rescue workers, medical assistance \r\nand supplies in the early days of the accident, offered \r\nto dispatch its nuclear emergency response team to \r\nFukushima.  \r\n As the Chair of ASEAN, Indonesia also initiated \r\na special meeting of the foreign ministers of Japan and \r\nASEAN in April to promote further cooperation in \r\ndisaster management. In May, one of our experts on \r\nnuclear radiological protection and emergency \r\nresponse was honoured by the opportunity to join an \r\nIAEA-led international fact-finding mission to \r\nFukushima. \r\n In order to restore public confidence in the safety \r\nand sustainability of nuclear power, including in \r\nIndonesia, it is of critical importance to address nuclear \r\nsafety and place it high on the global agenda. \r\n Globally, public expectations for bold action are \r\nhigh after the last nuclear accident. We should seize the \r\npresent momentum to help in shaping a global \r\nrethinking on nuclear safety. In that regard, my country \r\nwas pleased to see that, on 22 September, the IAEA \r\nGeneral Conference unanimously endorsed the Action \r\nPlan on Nuclear Safety, which Ministers had requested \r\nin their declaration at the IAEA Ministerial Conference \r\non Nuclear Safety in June. Indonesia looks forward to \r\nfinding ways and means to contribute actively to the \r\nimplementation of the Action Plan. \r\n We remain of the view that IAEA technical \r\ncooperation plays an indispensable role as the \r\nAgency’s main vehicle for delivering on its mandate to \r\npromote the peaceful uses of nuclear technology, \r\nespecially in the developing regions of the world. Since \r\njoining the IAEA, in 1957, Indonesia has enjoyed a \r\ngreat deal of cooperation with the IAEA in many areas \r\nof nuclear applications not involving power generation, \r\nsuch as in nuclear techniques for water resources, \r\nresearch reactor construction and operation, uranium \r\nextraction, food irradiation, radioisotope production \r\nand mutation-assisted plant breeding. The extensive \r\nuse of nuclear techniques for socio-economic \r\ndevelopment led to growing recognition of the \r\nimportance of nuclear technology for development in \r\nIndonesia.  \r\n Therefore, we strongly feel that now is the time \r\nfor Indonesia to share its long-developed knowledge \r\nand experience with other developing countries. In this \r\nregard, we are ready to serve as a technical cooperation \r\ndestination country to further support the IAEA in \r\npromoting its technical cooperation programmes. \r\n As a country that has benefited from a wide \r\napplication of nuclear techniques for water, we support \r\nthe decision of the Director General of the IAEA to \r\nprioritize nuclear techniques for water this year. \r\nIsotope tracer technology has been widely used by \r\nIndonesian universities, the national geology agency \r\nand the drinking water industry, as well as in \r\ngeothermal exploration. For geothermal exploitation, \r\nisotope tracers have been utilized to determine \r\nrecharge areas and the origin of geothermal fluids. \r\nRegarding water management, isotope technology has \r\nalso been widely applied to resolve recharge area and \r\ngroundwater dating. In Indonesia, isotope hydrology \r\nhas contributed to the mitigation of water shortages in \r\nareas that have a problem with water sanitation. \r\n The role of the Regional Cooperative Agreement \r\n(RCA) in the promotion of the use of nuclear \r\ntechnology for socio-economic development in the \r\nAsia-Pacific cannot be overlooked. In the almost \r\n40 years of the RCA’s existence, the participating \r\ncountries and the Agency have accumulated valuable \r\nexperience in cooperation and coordination of nuclear-\r\nrelated development activities in the region. Therefore, \r\nwe are determined to continue our active participation \r\nin this regional process. As the current Chairman of the \r\nRCA, in April 2011 Indonesia hosted the 33rd Meeting \r\nof National RCA Representatives in Bali, with around \r\n60 representatives from participating countries \r\nattending. \r\n Indonesia has made progress this year in \r\nmanaging radioactive waste and spent fuel. We \r\nsubmitted our instrument of ratification of the Joint \r\nConvention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management \r\nand on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management \r\non 1 April. \r\n Indonesia continues to support international \r\ncooperation in nuclear security and the centrality of the \r\nIAEA’s role in this area. Therefore, Indonesia supports \r\nA/66/PV.48  \r\n \r\n11-57701 10 \r\n \r\nthe Agency’s continued fostering of coordination and \r\nexchange of information with other relevant \r\norganizations and nuclear security-related initiatives in \r\norder to prevent duplication between Agency \r\nprogrammes and those under consideration by other \r\nentities, thus ensuring the continued effectiveness of \r\nthe Agency’s nuclear security programme. Indonesia \r\nalso supports those who suggest that the Agency should \r\nestablish a mechanism that would allow all member \r\nStates to be involved in an inclusive manner in the \r\ndevelopment of Nuclear Security Series documents. \r\n Together with representatives of the IAEA, \r\nIndonesia co-hosted the High-level Regional Workshop \r\non the International Legal Framework for Nuclear \r\nSecurity, from 20 to 22 July. The Workshop, which was \r\nattended by representatives of ASEAN member \r\ncountries, has raised awareness of the importance of \r\nstrong and effective measures to enhance nuclear \r\nsecurity.  \r\n From the discussion, Indonesia notes the value of \r\nmodel legislation and implementation kits for nuclear \r\nsecurity that could be used to transpose certain \r\nprovisions into national legislation. Indonesia \r\nemphasizes the importance of updating the IAEA’s \r\n2010 Handbook on Nuclear Law: Implementing \r\nLegislation, so that in the future it could serve as \r\nmodel legislation to speed up national implementation. \r\n Our commitment to safeguards implementation \r\nremains strong. In collaboration with other countries in \r\nthe Asia-Pacific region, Indonesia is part of efforts to \r\nenhance safeguards collaboration in the region by \r\nlaunching the Asia-Pacific Safeguards Network. The \r\nNetwork serves as a vehicle to define how we \r\nimplement the safeguards, assuring the use of nuclear \r\nenergy solely for peaceful uses in the economically \r\nvibrant Asia-Pacific region. \r\n On the issue of safeguards in the Middle East, we \r\ncontinue to support the IAEA taking a comprehensive \r\nand balanced approach in addressing non-proliferation \r\nissues in the region. Likewise, Indonesia has supported \r\nthe conclusions and recommendations for follow-on \r\nactions of the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties \r\nto the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \r\nWeapons, including with regard to the convening of a \r\nconference in 2012 on the establishment of a Middle \r\nEast zone free of nuclear weapons and all other \r\nweapons of mass destruction, on the basis of \r\narrangements freely arrived at by the States of the \r\nregion, and with the full support and engagement of the \r\nnuclear-weapon States.  \r\n In pursuit of paving a way for the realization of a \r\nnuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East, \r\nIndonesia fully supports the Director General’s \r\ninitiative to convene a Middle East nuclear-weapon-\r\nfree zone forum in Vienna later this month, and stands \r\nready to participate constructively in the process, both \r\nin its national capacity and its capacity as Chairman of \r\nthe Commission for the South-East Asian Nuclear-\r\nWeapon-Free Zone. \r\n Mr. Aquino (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): My \r\ncountry has joined in sponsoring draft resolution \r\nA/66/L.6 on the report of the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency (IAEA) as an expression of our firm \r\nsupport of the Agency’s work.  \r\n Peru, a founding member of the IAEA, has just \r\nconcluded its term on the Board of Governors for the \r\nperiod 2009 to 2011, where it actively participated in \r\naddressing the main issues of the Agency. In \r\nrecognition of its committed participation, the Group \r\nof Latin American and Caribbean States has endorsed \r\nPeru’s candidature to return to the Board of Governors \r\nfor the 2013 to 2015 term. \r\n The nuclear accident in the Fukushima Daiichi \r\nplant has marked an important point in the Agency’s \r\nwork. While Peru recognizes that the primary \r\nresponsibility for nuclear security falls on States, we \r\nare convinced that the IAEA plays a very important \r\nrole in promoting international cooperation and in the \r\ncoordination of global efforts to strengthen the global \r\nnuclear security regime. In that regard, we believe, \r\nwith an eye to the Agency’s mandate, technical \r\nspecialization and broad membership, that it is the \r\nappropriate forum in which to address all issues related \r\nto nuclear security. \r\n Although we would have preferred a more \r\nambitious document, my delegation commends the \r\napproval of the post-Fukushima action plan, which \r\ncontains a series of specific measures to strengthen \r\nnuclear security. It is a realistic document and has the \r\nmerit of including the concerns of all Agency member \r\nStates.  \r\n The progress made in the sphere of nuclear \r\nsecurity should be seen in the overall framework of the \r\ninitiative undertaken by the Director General of the \r\nIAEA in convening a ministerial-level conference in \r\n A/66/PV.48\r\n \r\n11 11-57701 \r\n \r\nJune 2011 and in the high-level meeting on nuclear \r\nsafety and security convened by the Secretary-General \r\nhere at United Nations Headquarters in September, as \r\nwell as other significant initiatives undertaken by the \r\ninternational community. In applauding and \r\nencouraging such initiatives, my delegation wishes to \r\nemphasize that it is necessary that throughout this \r\nprocess of strengthening the nuclear security regime, \r\nthe central function of the Agency in coordinating such \r\nefforts must be preserved. \r\n At the national level, my delegation wishes to \r\nhighlight the important work undertaken jointly with \r\nthe Agency. If I may, I would like to highlight some of \r\nthe technical cooperation activities that are geared to \r\nsupporting the National Institute for Neoplastic \r\nDiseases in fighting cancer, the National Agrarian \r\nUniversity La Molina in its projects to improve grains \r\nand native grain varieties, and the Peruvian Nuclear \r\nEnergy Institute in its research activities, as well as the \r\ncountry’s other significant research institutes, such as \r\nthe Peruvian University Cayetano in its projects to \r\nimprove South American cameloids. \r\n By reiterating Peru’s support for the management \r\nof the IAEA Director General, Ambassador Yukiya \r\nAmano — specifically the work related to nuclear \r\napplications in health, agriculture and water \r\ntreatment — we wish to highlight the fact that the \r\nDirector General visited Peru at the end of June 2011. \r\nHe was able to observe directly the progress in various \r\nprojects that the Agency has undertaken in Peru, all of \r\nwhich play an important role in developing the fight \r\nagainst poverty, and in agriculture, ground water and \r\nareas such as human health, industry, nuclear security \r\nand other areas. \r\n Peru believes that in order to give adequate \r\nattention to the needs of developing countries, the \r\nAgency should focus its priorities on the following \r\nfour areas. First is the fight against cancer. Taking into \r\naccount that two thirds of diagnosed cases of cancer \r\noccur in developing countries, Peru believes that it is \r\nurgent to create national capacities, both in training \r\nprofessionals and in acquiring equipment for diagnosis \r\nand treatment. Second is improvement of food \r\navailability through nuclear applications in agriculture. \r\nThird is support for member States that decide to \r\nimplement nuclear power plans by supplying them with \r\nthe necessary technical, economic and legislative \r\nassistance. Fourth is improving the study of water \r\nthrough isotopic techniques for water purification and \r\nusing those techniques in agriculture and the \r\nmanagement of groundwater resources. \r\n In the regional arena, since 1984 Peru has been \r\nan active participant in the Regional Agreement of \r\nTechnical Cooperation for the Promotion of Nuclear \r\nScience and Technology in Latin America and the \r\nCaribbean, with special emphasis on projects linked to \r\ntraining human resources and developing infrastructure \r\nin areas related to health, agriculture, energy and \r\nhydrology. I should also emphasize that in 2010 Peru \r\njoined the Ibero American Forum of Nuclear and \r\nRadiation Safety and Security Regulatory Agencies, \r\nwhich works actively to standardize national regulatory \r\nlegislation. \r\n In this Hall, we would like to reiterate our \r\nsupport for and recognition of the Agency and its more \r\nthan 50 years as the principal international \r\ngovernmental forum for scientific and technical \r\ncooperation in the use of nuclear technology for \r\npeaceful purposes and as the guarantor of compliance \r\nwith international commitments to use nuclear \r\ninstallations and materials for exclusively peaceful \r\npurposes. \r\n Mr. Langeland (Norway): Norway is pleased to \r\nsponsor of the draft resolution on the report of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) \r\n(A/66/L.6). My Government attaches great importance \r\nto the IAEA. Besides being a key guardian of our \r\ncollective non-proliferation regime, it is an important \r\npartner in promoting social and economic development \r\nwhile ensuring the safety and security of peaceful \r\nnuclear programmes. Through its extensive Technical \r\nCooperation Programme, the Agency plays an \r\nimportant role in contributing to the achievement of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. \r\n Nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament are \r\nclosely linked. We cannot achieve the goal of \r\neliminating nuclear weapons, as set out in the Treaty \r\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), \r\nunless there is confidence in the integrity of the \r\nnon-proliferation regime. Thus it is vital that we \r\nprovide the Agency with the necessary legal tools to \r\nimplement its non-proliferation mandate.  \r\n Norway therefore reiterates that the IAEA \r\ncomprehensive safeguards agreements and additional \r\nprotocols constitute the verification standard. Norway \r\nalso remains convinced that the IAEA has an important \r\nrole to play in verifying nuclear disarmament. Norway \r\nA/66/PV.48  \r\n \r\n11-57701 12 \r\n \r\ncontinues to urge countries with outstanding \r\nproliferation issues to cooperate fully with the Agency \r\nin resolving these matters and in demonstrating the \r\nexclusively peaceful nature of their nuclear \r\nprogrammes. \r\n Achieving a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the \r\nMiddle East is an important goal both from a regional \r\npoint of view and to reinforce the global \r\nnon-proliferation regime. Norway will chair the IAEA \r\nforum on a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle \r\nEast to be held this month in Vienna and believes that \r\nit will represent a significant contribution on the part of \r\nthe IAEA towards that goal. \r\n The 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the \r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \r\nalso underlined the importance of international \r\ncooperation with regard to the peaceful use of nuclear \r\nenergy. The tragic event in Fukushima earlier this year, \r\nas well as other safety incidents, has demonstrated the \r\ncritical importance of safety to nuclear energy. The role \r\nof the IAEA will thus be even more crucial in the years \r\nto come.  \r\n We look forward to working closely with the \r\nAgency in promoting nuclear security. Norway has \r\nprovided substantial voluntary contributions to support \r\nthe IAEA’s work to strengthen nuclear safety and \r\nsecurity in developing countries and to the \r\nestablishment of a nuclear fuel bank. It is imperative \r\nthat we, the member States, provide adequate and \r\npredictable funding so that the Agency can carry out its \r\nimportant mandate. It is equally important that the \r\ninternational community demonstrate full political \r\nsupport for the IAEA. My delegation expects that \r\ntoday’s draft resolution will be adopted by consensus. \r\n Mrs. Cizare (Ethiopia): I would first like to take \r\nnote with satisfaction of the annual report of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) (see \r\nA/66/95), which describes the Agency’s significant \r\nachievements during 2010. My appreciation also goes \r\nto Ambassador Yukiya Amano, Director General of the \r\nIAEA, for his comprehensive and informative \r\nstatement on the main developments in the Agency’s \r\nactivities during that period. My delegation is a \r\nsponsor of draft resolution A/66/L.6, on the report. \r\n We are pleased to recognize the progress made by \r\nthe IAEA over the past year in further enhancing its \r\ncontribution to global efforts to use atomic energy for \r\npeaceful purposes. We remain convinced that within \r\nthe framework of its three pillars, the Agency will \r\ncontinue to strengthen its technical support role to \r\nexpand international cooperation in the peaceful \r\napplication of nuclear energy. We believe that the \r\nAgency’s sustained technical assistance to developing \r\nnations — particularly in the areas of agriculture, \r\nhuman health, water resource management, energy \r\nplanning, non-destructive testing and radiation \r\nprotection — should be highlighted and its technical \r\nassistance programmes strengthened. In this regard we \r\nwelcome the budgetary increase for the Technical \r\nCooperation Fund. \r\n Ethiopia attaches great importance to the work of \r\nthe IAEA and appreciates the useful technical \r\ncooperation that the Agency is providing to member \r\nStates, particularly developing nations. The Agency’s \r\ngrowing role in helping developing countries achieve \r\ntheir socio-economic development goals is indeed \r\nencouraging, especially in its efforts to combat and \r\neradicate diseases in cattle, which have resulted in \r\ntangible progress in the agriculture and livestock \r\nsectors. Moreover, many of the Agency’s projects have \r\nhelped to ensure access to clean water and promote \r\nenvironmental sustainability. In this context, and in \r\norder to reach the goals set by the Millennium \r\nDeclaration (resolution 55/2) by 2015, the Agency’s \r\ntechnical assistance programme should be strengthened \r\nwith a view to expanding the scope of its activities \r\naimed at supporting developing countries, and \r\nparticularly least developed ones. \r\n Ethiopia is a beneficiary of the IAEA’s Technical \r\nCooperation Programme. Among the various areas \r\nwhere we have technical cooperation with the Agency \r\nis an ongoing project to eradicate the tsetse fly from \r\nthe Southern Rift Valley region of Ethiopia through an \r\nintegrated pest management approach. I am very \r\npleased to report that the project has started to benefit \r\nseveral communities by helping them to regain their \r\nfarmland and resume their normal livestock activities. \r\nStrengthening such concrete gains requires enhanced \r\ntechnical support from the Agency and an integrated \r\ndevelopment approach that takes into account proper \r\nland-use planning and management. \r\n It is also worth mentioning that the technical \r\ncooperation between Ethiopia and the Agency in the \r\narea of human health has resulted in establishing a \r\nmodest national infrastructure for the application of \r\nnuclear medicine and radiotherapy. A project is being \r\ndesigned for 2012-2017 to consolidate the existing \r\n A/66/PV.48\r\n \r\n13 11-57701 \r\n \r\nradiotherapy and nuclear medicine facilities in five \r\nregional state university hospitals for efficient \r\ndiagnosis and curative and palliative treatment for \r\ncancer patients. I would therefore like to request that \r\nthe Agency further strengthen its cooperation in this \r\narea, in order to combat cancer through sustainable \r\ntherapy programmes. We are also encouraged by our \r\ntechnical cooperation with the IAEA in applying \r\nisotope techniques in the management of our water \r\nresources and by our progress to date in implementing \r\nthat cooperation programme. \r\n I wish to take this opportunity to express our \r\ngratitude for the technical support that we receive \r\nthrough the Agency and its member States and from the \r\nAfrican Development Bank, the Food and Agriculture \r\nOrganization and other international organizations in \r\nthese areas, in particular for the eradication of the \r\ntsetse fly and trypanosomiasis from Ethiopia. We \r\nwelcome the steps the Agency has taken to formalize \r\nthe cooperation framework in support of the \r\nPan-African Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Eradication \r\nCampaign, as that framework is critical to eradicating \r\npoverty and to increasing agricultural productivity. We \r\ncall on the Agency to continue to accord high priority \r\nto the implementation of the cooperation framework.  \r\n We consider peaceful nuclear applications a \r\ncritical input to our continued efforts to carry out \r\nnational development strategies, policies and \r\nprogrammes. Indeed, we very much appreciate the \r\nAgency’s technical support in the development and \r\ncompletion of our Country Programme Framework for \r\nthe period 2012-2017. Obviously, the Framework is a \r\nsignificant step in efforts to develop our national \r\nnuclear science and technology infrastructure, and we \r\nrequest the Agency to extend its cooperation for the \r\nfull implementation of the Framework.  \r\n Ethiopia supports the Agency’s efforts to promote \r\nand ensure global nuclear safety. Ethiopia is committed \r\nto further strengthening the national radiation and \r\nnuclear safety and security infrastructure and to \r\nensuring the safe operation of equipment that uses \r\nradiation sources. The Ethiopian Radiation Protection \r\nAuthority will continue to work towards full \r\nimplementation of regulatory control systems in all \r\nthematic safety areas. In that regard, my delegation \r\nwould like to commend the activities of the IAEA in \r\nassisting member States, including my own country, in \r\nthe peaceful use of nuclear energy through the \r\ndevelopment of effective and efficient programmes to \r\nimprove scientific, technological and regulatory \r\ncapabilities. \r\n We firmly believe it is necessary to ensure, on a \r\nsystematic basis, the provision of sufficient and \r\npredictable resources to the Agency’s technical \r\nprogrammes and, more importantly, a balanced \r\ndistribution of resources to its safeguards and technical \r\ncooperation activities in the area of nuclear safety. That \r\nis important, especially in view of the fact that the \r\nAgency’s role in transferring peaceful technology is so \r\nnecessary to developing countries for the achievement \r\nof their socio-economic goals. \r\n In conclusion, allow me to extend once again our \r\nsupport to the IAEA for its efforts in the promotion of \r\ninternational cooperation in the peaceful use of nuclear \r\nenergy and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons in \r\nall its aspects. We hope the IAEA will continue to \r\npromote its noble objectives into the next year.  \r\n Mr. El-Mesallati (Libya) (spoke in Arabic): At \r\nthe outset, I would like to express our appreciation and \r\ngratitude to Mr. Yukiya Amano, Director General of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), for \r\npresenting the Agency’s report to the General \r\nAssembly (see A/66/95).  \r\n Having examined the report of the Agency \r\nsubmitted to this session of the Assembly, our \r\ncountry’s delegation would like to express its heartfelt \r\nappreciation to the secretariat of the IAEA, in \r\nparticular the Department of Technical Cooperation, \r\nfor its rapid response, support and efforts to strengthen \r\ncooperation in the fields of health, water resources \r\nmanagement and education, which are our national \r\npriorities. \r\n Our country’s delegation would like to emphasize \r\nthe rights of developing countries to benefit from the \r\npeaceful uses of nuclear energy, to have access to \r\nnuclear material and equipment and to exchange and \r\ntransfer scientific and technical information in that \r\nregard.  \r\n Our country clearly declares its position on the \r\nneed to take practical steps to support the Agency, with \r\na view to preserving its credibility and to \r\nimplementing, in a balanced manner, its three pillars — \r\nnon-proliferation, technical cooperation and \r\nverification — and the comprehensive safeguards \r\nregime and additional protocols.  \r\nA/66/PV.48  \r\n \r\n11-57701 14 \r\n \r\nWe call on the entire international community to \r\naccede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) and to the comprehensive \r\nsafeguards regime so as to demonstrate its commitment \r\nto the international treaties, agreements and \r\nconventions that it has signed. \r\n Libya expresses its support for the Director \r\nGeneral of the Agency, in particular his statement \r\nbefore the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to \r\nthe NPT. We believe that nuclear disarmament should \r\nbe of the utmost importance to the Agency and that it \r\nplays a significant role in verification activities. \r\nNuclear disarmament has a positive impact and will \r\nhelp strengthen all efforts towards non-proliferation.  \r\n In that connection, our country commends the \r\nactivities of the Agency to foster international \r\ncooperation in the fields of nuclear and radiological \r\nsafety. We place great emphasis on that issue, and thus \r\nLibya has acceded to the Convention on Nuclear Safety \r\nand the Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear \r\nAccident. We have participated in all activities in that \r\nregard.  \r\n We have set up an office to oversee nuclear and \r\nradiological safety and security. It is an independent \r\nmonitoring agency that, under enforced national \r\nlegislation, will execute its mandate in full \r\nindependence, in compliance with the Agency’s \r\nstandards. We also commend the Agency’s role in \r\ncombating any threat by terrorist groups to use nuclear \r\nweapons.  \r\n Furthermore, the National Transitional Council \r\nexpresses our interest in fostering cooperation with all \r\nfriendly States and with the Agency in order to secure \r\nall radioactive material in Libya, which is now in safe \r\nareas and can be accessed only by permission from the \r\nauthorities. A delegation from the Agency will visit \r\nLibya shortly to verify that such material is protected. \r\n Our country places the highest emphasis on \r\ninternational peace and security, in particular in the \r\nMiddle East region. The Middle East has become a \r\nhotbed of tension because Israel possesses nuclear \r\narms, which has led other countries to seek to obtain \r\nsuch weapons.  \r\n It has been more than 15 years since the 1995 \r\nNPT Review and Extension Conference adopted a \r\nresolution to establish in the Middle East a zone free of \r\nnuclear and all other weapons of mass destruction. \r\nSuch a zone was also underscored in the outcome \r\ndocument of the 2010 NPT Review Conference. That \r\nConference highlighted that the resolution would \r\ncontinue to be in effect until all its purposes and \r\nobjectives, including the achievement of the \r\nuniversality of the Treaty, had been achieved.  \r\n The conference to be held in 2012 will be \r\nattended by all countries of the Middle East with a \r\nview to underscoring the importance of implementing \r\nthe above-mentioned resolution, namely, the \r\nestablishment of a Middle East zone free of nuclear \r\nand all other weapons of mass destruction. The \r\nconference will be held in Finland. Our country \r\nexpresses its full support for that conference and for its \r\ngoals of establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the \r\nMiddle East and peace and security in the region.  \r\n My country’s delegation calls on all nuclear-\r\nweapon countries to adopt programmes to eliminate \r\ntheir nuclear arsenals and to put an end to all \r\nprogrammes for the development of such weapons, \r\npursuant to the legal commitments undertaken in \r\narticle VI of the NPT and highlighted by the 2010 NPT \r\nReview Conference, which stated that the NPT should \r\nrepresent a firm commitment to destroy all nuclear \r\narsenals and that otherwise the Treaty would be \r\nmeaningless.  \r\n As long as one nuclear weapon exists, the world \r\nfaces an enormous danger and a commensurate \r\nresponsibility on the part of nuclear-weapon States. \r\nOtherwise, nuclear-weapon-free zones will be \r\nmeaningless. \r\n Mr. Ja’afari (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in \r\nArabic): Despite the unanimous view that the only \r\nactual nuclear danger in the Middle East lies in Israel’s \r\npossession of nuclear weapons and their means of \r\ndelivery to distant regions, some of those who turn a \r\nblind eye to this clear-cut situation are pleased to open \r\nillusory fronts with suspect motives. Needless to say, \r\nsuch dishonest and non-objective actions evidently \r\nexpose the falsity of their assertions that they care \r\nabout the establishment of a zone free of nuclear \r\nweapons and other weapons of mass destruction in the \r\nregion of the Middle East.  \r\n For decades, they themselves were responsible \r\nfor supplying Israel with the nuclear technology and \r\nmaterials that enabled it to acquire nuclear weapons \r\nand their means of delivery, including sophisticated \r\nsubmarines. They tried their best to divert attention \r\n A/66/PV.48\r\n \r\n15 11-57701 \r\n \r\nfrom Israel’s nuclear weapons during the Review \r\nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, held in New \r\nYork last year. \r\n The prevailing hypocrisy on nuclear issues that \r\nmarks the statements and attitudes of some \r\nrepresentatives of Western States hinders progress in \r\nnuclear non-proliferation efforts. It irresponsibly \r\nencourages nuclear proliferation by a party that is still \r\noutside the NPT and that refuses to subject its nuclear \r\ninstallations to the international monitoring of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). In that \r\nconnection, I would recall that the conduct of those \r\nWestern States violates articles I and II of the NPT. The \r\nAgency must therefore hold those Western States \r\naccountable and responsible for those violations.  \r\n We regret that we are hearing words that only \r\nheighten our concerns, such as the crass insinuation \r\nmade against my country by the observer of the \r\nEuropean Union (EU) in his statement yesterday (see \r\nA/66/PV.46). We would like to remind him that many \r\nEU member States do not at all comply with their \r\ncommitments under the NPT. I refer to that state of \r\nnon-compliance for two main reasons. The first is the \r\npresence of nuclear weapons in the territory of \r\nnon-nuclear European States. The second is the fact \r\nthat those Western States continue to supply Israel with \r\nnuclear technology and materials and their means of \r\ndelivery.  \r\n In his statement yesterday, the Director General \r\nof the IAEA said that the Agency had finally come to \r\nthe conclusion that it was very likely that the building \r\ndestroyed at the Dair Alzour site in 2007 housed a \r\nnuclear reactor that should have been declared to the \r\nAgency. He went on to say that in June the IAEA \r\nBoard of Governors found Syria to be in \r\nnon-compliance with its safeguards obligations, and \r\nreported that non-compliance to the Security Council \r\nand the General Assembly. In that connection, allow \r\nme to make the following observations.  \r\n First, the IAEA Director General knows full well \r\nthat Syria made the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) one of its main national \r\npriorities. Syria therefore hastened to accede very early \r\nto the NPT, doing so in 1968. By the same token, it \r\nsigned a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the \r\nAgency in 1992.  \r\n Moreover, in 2003, when Syria was a member of \r\nthe Security Council, it presented a draft resolution on \r\nbehalf of the Arab Group that is still in blue ink in the \r\nSecurity Council. That draft resolution was designed to \r\ncreate a zone free of nuclear weapons and all other \r\nweapons of mass destruction in the Middle East.  \r\n These examples show that our national \r\ncommitment is credible and should not be questioned. \r\nWhen it was presented in 2003, the draft resolution, \r\nwhich is in accordance with the provisions and \r\nobjectives of the IAEA, clashed with the opposition of \r\nan influential permanent, nuclear-weapon State in the \r\nSecurity Council that threatened to use its veto if Syria \r\ninsisted on putting the draft resolution to a vote.   \r\n Second, the Security Council and the IAEA did \r\nnot condemn Israel’s flagrant aggression against my \r\ncountry’s sovereignty in 2007, probably because they \r\nare inured to Israel’s violations of resolutions of \r\ninternational legitimacy and do not hold it accountable. \r\nAs the Assembly well knows, Israel refused to \r\ncooperate with the Agency or to allow its inspectors to \r\nverify potential sources of pollution emanating from \r\nthe Israeli rockets that were used to bomb the Dair \r\nAlzour site, as well as the materials it used in \r\ncontaminating and destroying the bombed site. \r\n In that respect, Israel’s continued refusal to \r\ncooperate with the Agency’s requirements, its \r\ncontinued improvement of its military nuclear \r\ncapability outside of any international control or \r\nsupervision and its disregard for all appeals to create a \r\nzone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of \r\nmass destruction in the Middle East, diminish the \r\ncredibility of the NPT system and threaten the security \r\nand stability of the peoples and States of the Middle \r\nEast. \r\n These are extremely grave matters. We had hoped \r\nthat the IAEA Director General would have referred to \r\nthose issues in his statement, instead of resorting to \r\nsuch expressions as “highly probable”. \r\n Third, as a very useful exercise, I will now read \r\nout to colleagues a paragraph from the memoir of the \r\nformer Director General of the IAEA, Mr. Mohamed \r\nElBaradei, The Age of Deception — Nuclear \r\nDiplomacy in Treacherous Times. The paragraph is \r\nfound on pages 228 and 229 of the memoir. \r\nA/66/PV.48  \r\n \r\n11-57701 16 \r\n \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n  “One of the strangest and most striking \r\nexamples of nuclear hypocrisy, multilateral and \r\nmultifaceted, must surely be Israel’s bombing of \r\nthe Dair Alzour installation in Syria in September \r\n2007, and the aftermath of that attack. \r\nSpeculation began almost immediately that the \r\nsite had housed a nuclear facility. Syria denied \r\nthe accusations. Israel and the United States \r\nremained officially silent, although American \r\nofficials talked anonymously on the subject to the \r\nmedia. I spoke out strongly, noting that any \r\ncountry with information indicating that the \r\nbombed facility was nuclear was under a legal \r\nobligation to report it to the IAEA. But no one \r\ncame forward with such a report. For the six \r\nweeks following the bombing — the most crucial \r\nperiod in terms of our seeing inside the facility — \r\nwe were unable to obtain any high resolution \r\nimagery from commercial satellites.” \r\n(spoke in Arabic) \r\n He states that the United States of America \r\nrefused to supply the IAEA with the high-resolution \r\nimagery that the United States claimed indicated the \r\npresence of a building containing a nuclear reactor in \r\nDair Alzour. If the accusations by the United States had \r\nbeen correct, why would they have refused to submit \r\nthose high-resolution satellite images, as they were the \r\nones who possessed them. That was the question asked \r\nby Mr. ElBaradei. \r\n I will continue reading from the same paragraph. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n  “On October 28, in New York, I gave an \r\ninterview on CNN’s Late Edition with Wolf \r\nBlitzer. In response to Blitzer’s question as to \r\nwhether the Syrian facility was a nuclear reactor, \r\nI said we had not seen any evidence to conclude \r\none way or the other. But I was clear on one \r\npoint: that ‘to bomb first and then ask questions \r\nlater,’ as Israel had done, was deliberately \r\nundermining the system. Only the IAEA, I \r\npointed out, had the means to verify allegations \r\nof clandestine nuclear activity. In another \r\ninterview, with Charlie Rose two days later, I \r\npointed out that Israel’s 1981 attack on Iraq’s \r\nOsirak reactor had only served as motivation to \r\naccelerate Saddam Hussein’s clandestine nuclear \r\nprogram.” \r\n(spoke in Arabic) \r\n Mr. ElBaradei continues on page 230 of his \r\nmemoir, \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n “but it was clear that my condemnation of the \r\nbombing at Dair Alzour had touched a nerve. \r\nJohn Bolton was openly supportive of Israel’s \r\naction.”  \r\n(spoke in Arabic) \r\nJohn Bolton was the American Permanent \r\nRepresentative to the United Nations three years ago. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n “In an interview on CNN’s Late Edition, Wolf \r\nBlitzer asked Bolton what he thought of my \r\npublic assertion that Israel should have brought \r\nits ‘evidence’ to the IAEA. ‘If you believe that,’ \r\nBolton retorted, ‘I have a bridge to sell you. The \r\nnotion that Israel or the United States would put \r\ntheir national security in the IAEA’s hands is just \r\ndelusional.’” \r\n(spoke in Arabic) \r\nThat is what Bolton said when he was asked to respond \r\nto ElBaradei. The memoir continues: \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n “To hear these sentiments coming from the U.S. \r\nAmbassador to the United Nations was dreadful.” \r\n(spoke in Arabic) \r\n Fourth, compliance by the States parties to the \r\nAgency Statute makes it necessary for the United \r\nStates of America to inform the Agency of the \r\ninformation it had before destroying the building, and \r\nnot eight months later. The same thing applies to Israel, \r\nwhich supplied the Agency with information, if such \r\ninformation were accurate. Rather, it launched a \r\nmilitary attack on the territory of the State of Syria, \r\npenetrating the air space of a neighbouring State.  \r\n The Agency did not deal with this in an integrated \r\nmanner, nor did it take necessary measures in \r\naccordance with its responsibilities and mandate with \r\nregard to the encroachments and violations of the \r\n A/66/PV.48\r\n \r\n17 11-57701 \r\n \r\ninternational nuclear commitments by Israel and by the \r\nUnited States of America, in accordance with the NPT. \r\n Fifth, most of the contents and the findings of the \r\nAgency in the course of the mandate of the current \r\nDirector General regarding the Dair Alzour site have \r\nrelied on the imagery and analyses presented by the \r\nCentral Intelligence Agency of the United States of \r\nAmerica. My country would therefore question the \r\ncredibility of such information received by the Agency, \r\nas well as the nature of corroborating documents, \r\ntaking into consideration that such information was \r\npresented by a State in pursuit of a political agenda that \r\nis hostile to the interests of my country, Syria. \r\n Sixth, the current report of the Director General \r\ncontains incomplete findings based on information that \r\nlacks credibility and inclusiveness. The Agency’s \r\nassessments clearly run counter to its previous \r\nassessments, as we have mentioned previously. \r\n Seventh, the continued confusion between the \r\nlegal commitment of a member State by virtue of its \r\nsafeguards agreement, and its voluntary accession to \r\nthe additional protocol, has no legal basis and \r\nconstitutes another means of bringing political pressure \r\nto bear on Syria. \r\n Eighth, with respect to States that attempt to \r\ncover up for Israel’s nuclear weapons, we pose a \r\nquestion to them, to the Director General of the IAEA, \r\nand to the IAEA. We would like to ask all of them what \r\naction they have taken to implement Security Council \r\nresolution 487 (1981), which was adopted on 19 June \r\n1981 — meaning that more than 30 years have passed \r\nsince then. What have they done to carry out that \r\nresolution? At this point, allow me to quote the \r\nSecurity Council’s call on Israel in paragraph 5 of the \r\nresolution: \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n “to place its nuclear facilities under IAEA \r\nsafeguards”. \r\n(spoke in Arabic) \r\nThat resolution was adopted three decades ago. \r\n Next, in its important Yearbook on Armaments, \r\nDisarmament and International Security, the \r\nStockholm International Peace Research Institute \r\n(SIPRI) devoted a complete section to what it termed \r\nIsraeli nuclear forces. From this rostrum, I call on the \r\nIAEA and the nuclear-weapons depositary States of the \r\nNPT, as well as the nuclear-weapons States members of \r\nthe Security Council, to read that chapter and learn the \r\nnecessary lessons. I am talking about the book I have \r\nin my hand. In particular, those specialists here who \r\nwork on the First Committee and on disarmament \r\nmatters know what I am talking about. This book was \r\nnot published in Damascus; it was published in \r\nStockholm. \r\n Mr. Haniff (Malaysia): On behalf of the \r\ndelegation of Malaysia, I join others in thanking the \r\nDirector General of the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency (IAEA) for his presentation to the General \r\nAssembly of the annual report of the Agency for 2010 \r\n(see A/66/95). Malaysia is also pleased to sponsor draft \r\nresolution A/66/L.6. My delegation also wishes to \r\nwelcome the Dominican Republic, the Lao People’s \r\nDemocratic Republic and Tonga as new member States \r\nof the Agency. \r\n The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \r\nWeapons (NPT) entitles States parties to have access to \r\nnuclear technology. The Treaty also provides for the \r\nexchange of nuclear knowledge and scientific \r\ninformation and fosters cooperation among States for \r\nthe development of peaceful uses of nuclear energy. In \r\nthat connection, Malaysia greatly appreciates the \r\nIAEA’s role in assisting States in planning for and \r\nusing nuclear science and technology for peaceful \r\npurposes. The promotion of peaceful applications of \r\nnuclear energy constitutes a fundamental activity of the \r\nIAEA, as highlighted in IAEA documents. In that \r\nregard, my delegation is of the view that the IAEA \r\nmust be equipped with sufficient, assured and \r\npredictable resources to enable it to implement its \r\nmandated activities so that States pursuing peaceful \r\nuses of nuclear energy can benefit from the transfer of \r\nnuclear technology. \r\n As outlined in the Agency’s report, more than \r\n60 countries have expressed an interest in exploring the \r\nuse of nuclear power. Those countries include my own, \r\nMalaysia. As part of Malaysia’s economic \r\ntransformation programme, nuclear power \r\ndevelopment has been identified as one of the main \r\nprojects for future power generation. It is aimed purely \r\nat ensuring an adequate electricity supply for the \r\npeople of Malaysia beyond the year 2020. The \r\nGovernment of Malaysia is currently conducting an \r\nin-depth study of the project before making a final \r\ndecision on the matter. Our focus is on developing a \r\ncomprehensive nuclear programme, including legal and \r\nA/66/PV.48  \r\n \r\n11-57701 18 \r\n \r\nregulatory frameworks, involving the assessment of \r\npublic opinion and creation of a public relations plan. \r\nThe studies will be conducted by independent \r\nconsultants, taking into consideration lessons learned \r\nfrom major nuclear incidents in the past, as well as the \r\nresults of stress tests on nuclear power plants by \r\nmember States. The overarching objective is to ensure \r\nthat the highest standards of nuclear safety are \r\nobserved at all times, thus contributing to \r\nstrengthening global nuclear safety. \r\n With regard to the development of a more \r\ncomprehensive legislative and regulatory framework, \r\nmy delegation appreciates the IAEA’s input into our \r\ndraft comprehensive nuclear law, which seeks to \r\nstrengthen existing legislation. In addition, Malaysia \r\nhas also passed a strategic trade act, covering export \r\ncontrol measures for all single- and dual-use strategic \r\ngoods, including nuclear, chemical, biological and \r\nmissile-related items, as well as conventional arms. \r\n At the regional level, Malaysia has always \r\nrecognized the importance of regional cooperation and \r\nhas participated actively in many regional projects \r\nunder the aegis of the Agency. Malaysia welcomes the \r\nAgency’s efforts to create a common framework for \r\nnuclear waste and spent fuel management for the \r\ncountries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \r\n(ASEAN) through the consultancy meeting on \r\nrecommendations in spent fuel and radioactive waste \r\nmanagement for ASEAN held in March, and through \r\nother efforts in the field of nuclear security and safety. \r\n Notwithstanding the growing renewed interest in \r\nnuclear power generation, Malaysia still accords high \r\npriority to the peaceful uses of nuclear science and \r\ntechnology for enhanced food and water security, \r\nhuman health, natural resources and environmental \r\nmanagement, industrial development and medical \r\napplications. These sectors are being supported by \r\nfurther developments in national capabilities in \r\npeaceful nuclear technology research and development, \r\ncommercialization, the development of a more \r\ncomprehensive legislative and regulatory framework, \r\ntechnological infrastructure, human capital \r\ndevelopment, competency verification, public \r\ninformation, compliance with the international system \r\nof nuclear governance, and engagement in international \r\ncooperation. \r\n In that regard, my delegation wishes to thank the \r\nIAEA, particularly its Technical Cooperation \r\nDepartment, for its continuing support for the \r\nimplementation of IAEA technical cooperation projects \r\nand various other activities in Malaysia, including the \r\ntrust shown to Malaysia in continuing to have it host \r\nthe IAEA postgraduate educational course in radiation \r\nprotection and the safety of radiation sources. My \r\ndelegation also wishes to express its gratitude to other \r\nmember States that have shown interest in the course, \r\nwhich has attracted candidates from beyond our region \r\nas well as within it. \r\n In addition, Malaysia is also pleased and \r\nappreciative of the fact that the Malaysian Nuclear \r\nAgency has been redesignated, for the period 2010-\r\n2014, as the IAEA Collaborating Centre for Radiation \r\nProcessing of Natural Polymer and Nanomaterials. \r\nAmong other things, the Centre has demonstrated the \r\nradiation-aided production of non-toxic, \r\nenvironmentally friendly palm oil acrylates for printing \r\napplications. \r\n With regard to the assurance of supplies of \r\nnuclear fuel, my delegation welcomes the continued \r\ndiscussions on the development of multilateral \r\napproaches to the nuclear fuel cycle under the auspices \r\nof the IAEA. Malaysia reiterates that any further \r\nconsideration of the issue of assurance of supply must \r\nbe based on a coherent and comprehensive conceptual \r\nframework that adequately addresses the views and \r\nconcerns of all Member States. Malaysia remains \r\nconvinced that further consideration of individual \r\nproposals on this matter must be preceded by a \r\nconsensus agreement adopted by the General \r\nConference on the conceptual framework that outlines \r\nthe specific political, technical, economic and legal \r\nparameters. My delegation notes the Agency’s \r\ncontinuing efforts to establish and improve the concept \r\nof a low-enriched-uranium bank facility. Nonetheless, \r\nwe wish to underline that such an arrangement must \r\naccommodate the inalienable rights of NPT States \r\nparties to nuclear technology. \r\n With regard to international effort to establish a \r\nMiddle East zone free of nuclear weapons and all other \r\nweapons of mass destruction, which was agreed to by \r\nStates party to the NPT during the NPT Review \r\nConference in 2010, my delegation welcomes the \r\nappointment of Mr. Jaakko Laajava, Under-Secretary \r\nof State for Foreign and Security Policy of Finland, as \r\nfacilitator. We also welcome the designation of Finland \r\nas the host Government for the 2012 Conference, \r\nwhich could provide the impetus for the creation of \r\n A/66/PV.48\r\n \r\n19 11-57701 \r\n \r\nsuch zone in the Middle East. We also support the \r\nefforts of the Director General to convene an IAEA \r\nforum in Vienna later this month to further support this \r\nprocess. \r\n Finally, Malaysia would like to express once \r\nagain its appreciation to the Director General of IAEA, \r\nas well as to the IAEA secretariat for their significant \r\nand valuable work in fulfilling the Agency’s mandate. \r\n The Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on agenda item 86.  \r\n We shall now proceed to consider draft resolution \r\nA/66/L.6. Before giving the floor to the speakers in \r\nexplanation of vote before the voting, may I remind \r\ndelegations that explanations of vote are limited to \r\n10 minutes and should be made by delegations from \r\ntheir seats.  \r\n Mr. Ri Tong Il (Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea): Concerning the general statements made \r\nearlier, the delegation of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea would like to express its heartfelt \r\nthanks to the representatives who showed attention and \r\nsupport for the peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue \r\non the Korean peninsula. \r\n Concerning draft resolution A/66/L.6 and the \r\nreport of the International Atomic Energy Agency \r\n(A/66/95), the delegation of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea totally and categorically rejects that \r\nreport. The report again refers to the nuclear issue of \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, as well as \r\nto the Agency’s previous history of behaving \r\nimpartially. In particular, the report refers to the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea with no basis \r\nin fundamental reality, and is therefore misleading with \r\nregard to that reality.  \r\n The delegation of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea would like to make a few comments \r\nconcerning the factors that violate and distort the \r\nfundamental reality. \r\n First of all, the report refers to the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea as if it were a member of \r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). That \r\nis not the case in reality. The Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea withdrew from IAEA in 1994 and \r\nfrom the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \r\nWeapons (NPT) in 2003. Those withdrawals are in line \r\nwith international law. In particular, article X of the \r\nTreaty stipulates that States parties can withdraw from \r\nthe NPT if the supreme interest of that State is in \r\njeopardy, and that was in fact the case for the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea. In 2002, the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea was included \r\non the Bush Administration’s list of the axis of evil; \r\neverybody knows that. The Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea was included on the Bush \r\nAdministration’s list of seven countries in line for \r\nnuclear pre-emptive strikes, and those policies, which \r\nwere part of the Bush Administration’s nuclear \r\ndoctrine, compelled the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea to withdraw from the NPT. The Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea made a firm decision to \r\nexit the Treaty in order to defend our supreme interest, \r\nnamely, the security, dignity and sovereignty of the \r\ncountry.  \r\n When the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea \r\njoined the NPT, it was in the expectation that the \r\nnuclear danger would be removed from the peninsula. \r\nAs everybody knows, the United States introduced \r\nnuclear weapons into South Korea in 1957. The first \r\nnuclear weapons arrived in South Korea in 1957. The \r\ntotal had reached 1,000 by 1970. Everybody can \r\nimagine the threat of nuclear disaster with which the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea has been living \r\nfor over six decades. Given that situation, the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea had no choice \r\nbut to withdraw from the NPT. \r\n Secondly, with respect to the fundamental reality, \r\nthe report makes reference to uranium enrichment. \r\nEverybody has an equal right to enrich uranium under \r\ninternational law. That is in line with international \r\ntrends and is reflected in the report, which states that \r\nover 90 countries are now moving towards peaceful \r\nnuclear energy. Those countries opted for nuclear \r\npower to meet their energy needs, and the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea has made the same choice. \r\nIn particular, the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea is a party to the Six-Party Talks, under which the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea has that right, \r\nwhich is stipulated as a component of the Six-Party \r\nTalks. \r\n If one considers the historical background, the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea has been \r\ndamaged in its construction of independent nuclear \r\npower. In 1994, the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea and the United States agreed on a framework, \r\nthe first ever historical document between the two \r\nsides, which have had hostile relations. By 2003, the \r\nA/66/PV.48  \r\n \r\n11-57701 20 \r\n \r\nUnited States was obliged to provide light-water \r\nreactors in compensation for freezing the verified \r\nmoderate reactor that the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea had been conducting with a capacity \r\nof 2 million kilowatts of electricity. But by the year \r\n2002, as I said, the Bush Administration unilaterally \r\nabrogated that agreement without giving prior notice to \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. So far, the \r\nUnited States has not paid a single penny to \r\ncompensate for the loss it caused the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea. We have computed \r\nalready how much compensation the United States \r\nshould pay for that; everybody can imagine how much \r\nthat should be. \r\n Thirdly, there is mention of the threat of nuclear \r\ntests to international peace and security. Again, that is \r\nnot the case and goes against the fundamental reality. \r\nAs I said, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea \r\nand the United States made an agreement and adopted \r\nit in 1994. That was the first-ever agreed framework \r\nbetween the two sides, the first-ever historical \r\nagreement. Under that agreement, there is one \r\ncomponent that stipulates that the United States is \r\ncommitted not to use nuclear weapons and not to \r\nthreaten the security of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea. But that was not the case with the \r\nUnited States. In 2002, the United States listed the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea along with Iran \r\nand Iraq as the axis of evil. First, Iraq was mercilessly \r\nattacked with armed invasion by the United States, and \r\neverybody knows what has happened so far. One \r\nmonth after the end of the Iraq war, the Bush \r\nAdministration openly said that the next target would \r\nbe the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. The \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea said that the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea is not Iraq. \r\n So those are the threats that have been caused so \r\nfar by the United States. More than ever before, we are \r\nunder increasing nuclear threat from nuclear-powered \r\nsubmarines carrying nuclear weapons and from \r\nnuclear-powered aircraft carriers carrying massive \r\namounts of weapons of destruction and different types \r\nof sophisticated weaponry that daily enter the Korean \r\npeninsula, South Korea and its vicinity. This is the \r\nthreat, with a military alliance, that is growing \r\nincreasingly stronger, with a negative impact on the \r\nKorean peninsula, the region and the world as a whole. \r\n Concerning the demarche by the Director General \r\nof the IAEA, he referred to the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea once again and urged it to \r\nimplement the Security Council resolutions against it. \r\nThose Security Council resolutions — two \r\nresolutions — were totally and categorically rejected \r\nby the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, as each \r\nof them was adopted, as being of no help at all to peace \r\nand security on the Korean peninsula, and actually \r\nundermining peace and security there, because they do \r\nnot reflect fundamental realities. \r\n The United States has been a perpetrator in terms \r\nof the nuclear threat to the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea since 1957. The Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea has been under that nuclear \r\nthreat — a victim. But the Security Council resolutions \r\nview this in a different way, as if the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea were an offender, a \r\nperpetrator of the nuclear threat against world peace \r\nand security. I would like to remind the Director \r\nGeneral of the fundamental reality of what is \r\nhappening and of what has occurred in the past.  \r\n In conclusion, the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea delegation would like to clarify its position \r\non the settlement of the nuclear issue. The Government \r\nof the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea firmly \r\nbelieves that military exercises and military alliances \r\nare not an option or a solution to the nuclear issue on \r\nthe Korean peninsula. The Government of the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea remains \r\ncommitted to the denuclearization of the Korean \r\npeninsula through the Six-Party Talks, at the earliest \r\npossible date, without any preconditions and in the \r\ncontext of the full implementation of the 19 September \r\njoint statement, in a comprehensive and balanced \r\nmanner based on the principle of simultaneous action.  \r\n That is what our great leader, the respected Kim \r\nJong Il, underlined in his recent interview with ITAR-\r\nTASS. \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\ntake a decision on draft resolution A/66/L.6. May I take \r\nit that the Assembly decides to adopt draft resolution \r\nA/66/L.6? \r\n Draft resolution A/66/L.6 was adopted \r\n(resolution 66/7). \r\n The Acting President: I shall now call on those \r\nrepresentatives who wish to speak in exercise of the \r\nright of reply. \r\n A/66/PV.48\r\n \r\n21 11-57701 \r\n \r\n May I remind members that statements in \r\nexercise of the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes \r\nfor the first intervention and to five minutes for the \r\nsecond intervention and should be made by delegations \r\nfrom their seats. \r\n Mr. Ri Tong Il (Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea): Thank you, Madam President, for giving me \r\nthe floor once again. \r\n The delegation of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea categorically rejects the remarks \r\nmade by the representatives of Japan and South Korea, \r\nbecause they have no fundamental reality or truth as \r\nconcerns the Korean peninsula, as I said earlier. \r\n I should like to draw the attention of the \r\nrepresentatives participating in this meeting to one \r\nissue: South Korea is under the nuclear umbrella of the \r\nUnited States, as I mentioned earlier. It has been living \r\nunder the nuclear umbrella of the United States, the \r\nlargest nuclear-weapon State. With respect to South \r\nKorea, the first thing we want to know is why it \r\nallowed a foreign Power, the largest nuclear-weapon \r\nPower, to bring this to our land — in a move that is \r\ndisastrous to our national survival, our national dignity \r\nand our national sovereignty. That is the first question \r\nthat the nationals of the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea have in their hearts. I think that most of the \r\nparticipants in this meeting will share this view. \r\n As far as United States nuclear weapons in South \r\nKorea, in 1975 a shocking and surprising media report \r\ncame out. A parliamentary debate was ongoing in the \r\nUnited States on the military budget of that country for \r\n1976, and it was only then that the fact that nuclear \r\nweapons had been deployed to South Korea was \r\nrevealed. It was only then that South Korean \r\nauthorities learned that there were nuclear weapons in \r\nSouth Korea. No South Korean authorities or \r\npoliticians were aware of that fact. \r\n There is another factor to which the delegation of \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea would like \r\nto draw attention: the military alliance. As I said \r\nbefore, this is a very serious concern for the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea and the \r\ncountries in the North-East Asian region and in our \r\nAsia-Pacific region. \r\n The military exercises, in scope and in nature, are \r\ngiving rise to increasingly grave concerns. Even as we \r\nspeak, the United States and South Korea are \r\nconducting joint military exercises in South Korea. \r\nThey began on 27 October and continue through \r\ntomorrow. How many people are participating? How \r\nmany troops? A total of 140,000 troops are \r\nparticipating. The Western media are not reporting this \r\nnews. This is causing great concern, as it is taking \r\nplace while a dialogue is ongoing. The South Korean \r\nauthorities are carrying out this kind of military \r\nprovocation even as dialogue is being conducted. As \r\nmembers are aware, just last week there was a \r\ndialogue.  \r\n Yet the South Korean representative, at this \r\nmeeting, took a confrontational approach in his \r\nremarks, failing to mention a single word about \r\ndialogue towards the settlement of the nuclear issue on \r\nthe Korean peninsula. Therefore, the delegation of the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea would like to \r\nurge the representative and the authorities of South \r\nKorea to remove the United States military bases from \r\nSouth Korea; they have been there for more than six \r\ndecades, since 1945, dividing the country and creating \r\na disastrous risk for the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea, its South Korean brothers and the entire \r\nKorean nation. We urge South Korea to remove the \r\nmilitary bases of the United States, which are a haven \r\nfor United States nuclear weapons. \r\n As for Japan, the same applies. It is also under \r\nthe nuclear umbrella of the United States. Furthermore, \r\nin 1960 the Japanese Government made a secret deal \r\nwith the United States to allow American warships \r\ncarrying nuclear weapons to enter the territorial waters \r\nof Japan. Since that time, it is everyday business for \r\nUnited States naval forces carrying nuclear weapons. It \r\nis up to them when they come and go, without \r\nproviding any information at all. Furthermore, Japan is \r\nthe largest weapons-grade plutonium accumulator in \r\nthe world, to the tune of more than 40 tons, and it has \r\nthe technology for nuclear weapons. It can assemble a \r\nnuclear weapon at short notice — within one week. \r\nThis is known to every expert and every population in \r\nthis world. It is an open secret. \r\n Concerning means of delivery, it is also an open \r\nsecret that the Japanese Government did not hesitate to \r\nengage in joint research and development in the area of \r\nmissile defence with the United States, which it has \r\nbeen doing since 1999. Now it is reaching the stage of \r\npractical deployment in strategic positions, affecting \r\nthe peace and stability of North-East Asia and the Asia-\r\nPacific regions and the entire world. \r\nA/66/PV.48  \r\n \r\n11-57701 22 \r\n \r\n Mr. Rim Kap-soo (Republic of Korea): I would \r\nlike to exercise the Republic of Korea’s right of reply \r\nin response to the North Korean delegation’s claims, \r\nwhich clearly run counter to facts that have been \r\nrecognized and supported by the international \r\ncommunity.  \r\n Let me briefly chronicle what has happened since \r\nthe year 1993. The Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea announced unilateral withdrawal from the Treaty \r\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) in \r\n1993 and again in 2003. In 1993, the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic’s non-compliance with \r\nthe safeguards agreement to the Security Council. The \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic conducted nuclear tests \r\nin 2006, just a year after the adoption of the 2005 Joint \r\nStatement. In April 2009, the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic kicked the IAEA inspectors out of their \r\ncountry and, in May of the same year, they again \r\nconducted nuclear tests. Last year, they disclosed \r\nanother nuclear programme for uranium enrichment.  \r\n The Security Council has adopted three \r\nresolutions, five presidential statements and one press \r\nstatement on the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea nuclear issue. Council resolution 825 (1993) was \r\nadopted in 1993 when the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic announced its unilateral withdrawal. \r\nResolutions 1718 (2006) and 1874 (2009) were \r\nadopted right after the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nconducted nuclear tests in 2006 and 2009, respectively. \r\nIn resolution 1874 (2009), the Security Council stated \r\nthat it “[c]ondemns in the strongest terms the nuclear \r\ntest” and decided that the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic should abandon all nuclear weapons and \r\nexisting nuclear programmes. Further, the Security \r\nCouncil called upon the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nto act in strict accordance with its obligations under the \r\nNPT and IAEA safeguards.  \r\n Not only did the Security Council act, but the \r\n2005 Joint Statement of the Six Parties clearly stated \r\nthat the Democratic People’s Republic undertook to \r\nabandon all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear \r\nprogrammes. The Final Document of the 2010 NPT \r\nReview Conference reaffirmed that fact and requested \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic to return to the NPT \r\nand to compliance with the IAEA safeguards. \r\nNumerous violations detected by IAEA also confirm \r\nthat fact, and further, the South-North Joint Declaration \r\non the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, \r\nsigned on 31 December 1991, clearly stipulated that \r\nNorth Korea should not produce uranium enrichment \r\nfacilities.  \r\n The North Korean delegation is blatantly ignoring \r\nall of those obligations and now claims the right of \r\npeaceful use. With that right, the international \r\ncommunity, including the United Nations and the \r\nIAEA, would, in their view, be ganging up in a grand \r\nconspiracy against the innocent North Korean \r\nauthorities, but the North Korean authorities continue \r\nto confront and violate its international obligations. I \r\nbelieve that the North Korean position defies common \r\nsense. \r\n Secondly, regarding national security, there have \r\nbeen a great many unprovoked provocations by North \r\nKorea. Of such provocations, I will give but some \r\nexamples of those that were brought to and discussed \r\nat the United Nations. In 1983, bombs exploded and \r\nkilled 17 high-level officials of the Republic of Korea, \r\nincluding our then-Foreign Minister, who were \r\naccompanying our President to Myanmar on a State \r\nvisit. In 1987, a civilian Korea Air Lines flight \r\nexploded mid-air on the way home from abroad; all of \r\nthe 115 people aboard were killed. In 1996, a North \r\nKorea submarine infiltrated our coastline with heavily \r\narmed military personnel, which led to a Security \r\nCouncil presidential statement (S/PRST/1996/42).  \r\n I will not elaborate any further on what happened \r\nlast year — the Cheonan sinking and the Yeonpyeong \r\nshelling, which killed 50 people. Just last year, by my \r\nrough count, over 200 Korean people were killed or \r\ninjured. Beside those physical provocations, the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic has also mounted a great \r\nmany verbal provocations. In 1994, a senior official of \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea made the \r\nthreatening remark that “Seoul is not far from the \r\nborder. If war breaks out, Seoul will fall into the sea of \r\nfire”. Those same remarks were repeated last year by a \r\nsenior military general of the North Korean regime. \r\nLast December, North Korea’s top military general \r\ndeclared that nuclear war is nearing and that all of \r\nSouth Korea will be engulfed in nuclear fire.  \r\n Now, my question is, once again, who is \r\nthreatening? Who is living under a constant threat? Is it \r\nthe North or the South? I will leave the answer to this \r\nquestion to the Assembly’s common sense. \r\n Lastly, after the signing of the South-North Joint \r\nDeclaration on the Denuclearization of the Korean \r\n A/66/PV.48\r\n \r\n23 11-57701 \r\n \r\nPeninsula in 1992, there has not been a single piece of \r\nnews about any situation in that connection in South \r\nKorea. That is also a fact. \r\n Mr. Kodama (Japan): I would like to exercise the \r\nright of reply to the allegations against Japan made by \r\nthe representative of the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea at this meeting. Let me set the record straight \r\non the following three points.  \r\n First of all, the Japanese Government’s adherence \r\nto the three non-nuclear principles, namely that \r\npossessing, manufacturing or permitting the \r\nintroduction of nuclear weapons into the territory of \r\nJapan is prohibited, remains unchanged. Japan’s \r\ndetermination to bring about the total elimination of \r\nnuclear weapons with a view to achieving a world \r\nwithout nuclear weapons is unshakeable. In that regard, \r\nindeed, there exist no facts supporting any claim that \r\nthe Government of Japan has ever allowed the \r\nintroduction of nuclear weapons by the United States \r\non Japanese territories. Based on the United States \r\nnuclear policy expressed to date, such as the \r\nannouncement in 1991, it is the judgment of the \r\nGovernment of Japan that there has currently been no \r\nintroduction of nuclear weapons by the United States, \r\nincluding vessels and/or aircraft, to call at ports in, \r\nland on or transit through Japanese territories. \r\n Secondly, Japan has strictly complied with its \r\nobligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \r\nof Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards as a State \r\nparty to the NPT. The peaceful nature of Japan’s use of \r\nnuclear energy has been confirmed by the IAEA in its \r\nannual conclusion that all nuclear material remains \r\nwithin peaceful activities. Moreover, beyond its legal \r\nobligations, Japan has, as an international transparency \r\nmeasure, regularly reported the amount of its \r\nplutonium holdings in accordance with the guidelines \r\nfor the management of plutonium, most recently on \r\n29 September 2011. \r\n Thirdly and finally, Japan maintains an \r\nexclusively defence-oriented policy. Therefore, \r\nexercises conducted by the Self-Defence Forces of \r\nJapan do not target any particular country or area. \r\nMoreover, the ballistic missile defence system which \r\nJapan has decided to introduce is purely defensive in \r\nnature and does not threaten any country or area \r\nneighbouring Japan. \r\n The Acting President: I remind members that \r\nstatements made in exercise of right of reply are \r\nlimited to five minutes for the second intervention. \r\n Mr. Ri Tong Il (Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea): Concerning the remarks by the representatives \r\nof the Republic of Korea and Japan, these \r\nrepresentatives again made remarks that do not convey \r\nthe fundamental realities on the Korean peninsula and \r\nin the vicinity, specifically in Japan. The representative \r\nof South Korea tells a different story by not referring to \r\nthe nuclear umbrella that it has been using for over six \r\ndecades, the world’s largest nuclear-weapon nuclear \r\numbrella. This is of the greatest concern to the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea, North-East \r\nAsia and the Asia-Pacific region. In the entire region \r\nthere is not a single nuclear weapon threatening the \r\nsovereignty, dignity or national survival of the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea. The only \r\nthreat is the United States’ nuclear umbrella, and South \r\nKorea is using that umbrella, though the representative \r\ndid not refer to it.  \r\n Secondly, concerning the Security Council \r\nresolutions, as I said earlier, the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea totally rejects them as reflecting no \r\nfundamental reality on the Korean peninsula. That fact \r\nundermines the mandate of the Security Council and \r\nthe credibility of the United Nations Charter, which \r\nstipulates that every country has a sovereign right to \r\ndefend itself. Self-defence is indeed at stake in the case \r\nof the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, which \r\nexists under South Korea’s nuclear umbrella provided \r\nby the largest nuclear-weapon State. \r\n Thirdly, concerning the so-called — according to \r\nwhat was said here earlier — terrorist attacks by the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea, it was the \r\ndictatorial regime of South Korea that was responsible. \r\nEvery time there was a political crisis at that time the \r\nSouth Korean authorities made up a story, diverting the \r\nattention of the people of South Korea to accusations \r\nagainst the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, so \r\nthat the authorities could survive the political crisis.  \r\n It is the same with the current South Korean \r\nauthorities. In the case of last year’s Cheonan incident, \r\nas soon as they came to power the South Korean \r\nauthorities stopped all the channels of reconciliation \r\ndialogue between the two sides, which were in place \r\nunder and in line with the Joint Declaration of 15 June \r\n2000, adopted at the summit meeting in Pyongyang, \r\nA/66/PV.48  \r\n \r\n11-57701 24 \r\n \r\nwhich was followed by another summit meeting in \r\n2007. But the South Korean authorities stopped that \r\nentire process, and now they are in a political crisis. So \r\nthey fabricated the so-called Cheonan incident. And \r\nhow many young soldiers did they kill? It was over 40. \r\nThere is much profound scepticism about that incident, \r\nand the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea \r\nstrongly insists that the ones responsible for that \r\nincident should be brought to justice. There is much \r\nscepticism about that incident. The so-called \r\nassessment survey results are less than convincing. \r\nThere are many questions, even among the South \r\nKorean population. Experts living in the United States \r\nhave themselves openly released their own arguments \r\nagainst the survey results. \r\n In response to the delegate of Japan, Japan has \r\nonce again made false remarks under the guise of \r\nso-called three non-nuclear principles. But fortunately, \r\nlast year the Foreign Minister of Japan acknowledged \r\nthe proven entry of United States nuclear weapons into \r\nthe territorial waters of Japan, on the adoption of the \r\nsecret nuclear deal in 1960. They never asked what was \r\ncoming into their territorial waters. Also, Japan is now \r\nmaking a lot of territorial plans — on the Korean \r\npeninsula in Dokdo Island, on Chinese territory in the \r\nDiaoyu Islands and on Russian territory in the Kuril \r\nIslands. And one country is encouraging Japan to \r\ncontinue pressing those claims — and that is the \r\nUnited States. \r\n Mr. Rim Kap-soo (Republic of Korea): \r\nRegarding the claims made by the representative of the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea, I will be very \r\nbrief. First, Seoul is just 55 miles away from the border \r\nand has a population of 12 million people. Along the \r\nborder there are 1 million North Korean troops. They \r\nhave made a great many provocations, as I indicated \r\nearlier. Without going into detail, there are over \r\n24 cases. So we are constantly being threatened by the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea. I live in \r\nSeoul, so I know very well how difficult and dangerous \r\nit is to live in such a situation. So, if the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea claims that they are facing  \r\n \r\na nuclear threat from the United States, Seoul is just \r\n55 miles away from the hostile nuclear arms of the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea. \r\n Secondly, last year our ship Cheonan was sunk, \r\nand 46 young soldiers died. Also, in November one of \r\nour islands was very heavily shelled, killing four \r\npeople. There was no response to our complaints from \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. They did \r\nnot acknowledge or even refute any wrongdoing. But \r\nthen, who did it? Did the “Phantom of the Opera” do \r\nit?  \r\n Thirdly, the representative of the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea mentioned our dictatorial \r\nregime in 1980 inventing fabrications. Allow me to \r\nadvise his delegation that the dictatorial regime in the \r\nNorth should take care of its own people before \r\nmaking such allegations. \r\n Mr. Kodama (Japan): I will be very brief. \r\nWhatever allegations the representative of the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea made in his \r\nsecond exercise of the right of reply, my delegation \r\nwould like very much to remind the international \r\ncommunity that it was the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea that continued developing its \r\nnuclear and missile programmes, including its uranium \r\nenrichment programme, in violation of the relevant \r\nSecurity Council resolutions and of the Joint Statement \r\nof 19 September 2005 coming out of the Six-Party \r\nTalks. \r\n It is imperative for the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea to take concrete steps to \r\ndemonstrate its genuine commitment to complete, \r\nverifiable and irreversible denuclearization and to \r\nimproving inter-Korean relations, in order to have \r\nmeaningful dialogue among the six parties. \r\n The Acting President: May I take it that it is the \r\nwish of the General Assembly to conclude its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 86? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n  The meeting rose at 12.40 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
