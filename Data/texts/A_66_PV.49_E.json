(Qatar) \r\n \r\n \r\n In the absence of the President, Mr. Thomson \r\n(Fiji) took the Chair. \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 64 \r\n \r\nReport of the Human Rights Council \r\n \r\n  Report of the Human Rights Council (A/66/53 \r\nand A/66/53/Add.1) \r\n \r\n The Acting President: In connection with this \r\nitem, I would like to recall that the General Assembly, \r\nat its 2nd plenary meeting, on 16 September 2011, \r\ndecided to consider agenda item 64 in plenary meeting \r\nand in the Third Committee on the understanding that, \r\ninter alia, the Assembly, in plenary meeting, would \r\nconsider the annual report of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil on its activities for the year. \r\n \r\nStatement by the President \r\n \r\n The Acting President: I shall now make a \r\nstatement on behalf of the President of the General \r\nAssembly, His Excellency Mr. Nassir Al-Nasser. \r\n  “Alongside peace and security and \r\ndevelopment, human rights constitutes the third \r\ncore agenda of the United Nations. In that \r\ncontext, consideration of the report of the Council \r\nby the Assembly is of special significance. \r\n  “As a relatively young entity of the United \r\nNations system in its present form, the Human \r\nRights Council has grown and developed \r\nconsiderably in responding to the need to ensure \r\nall human rights for all around the world. It has \r\nacted quickly and responded to many situations, \r\nand it has also promoted dialogue and \r\ncooperation among States on various human \r\nrights issues. In particular, the consensual \r\napproach that prevailed throughout the review of \r\nthe Council’s methods of work and functions \r\ndemonstrated the commitment of the membership \r\nto achieving the shared objective of strengthening \r\nthe human rights system. \r\n  “The outcome that resulted from these \r\nnegotiations, as well as the coordinated approach \r\nbetween Geneva and New York during the \r\nreview, is welcomed. I believe firmly that this \r\npractice of coordination and consultation between \r\nthe Council and the Assembly should be built \r\nupon and enhanced. \r\n  “Allow me in that regard to commend the \r\nwork carried out by Ambassador Sihasak \r\nPhuangketkeow of Thailand, whose leadership as \r\nCouncil President during the review, especially in \r\nsteering the process to a successful conclusion in \r\nGeneva and in coordinating efforts with the \r\nGeneral Assembly, is worthy of our special \r\nappreciation. \r\n  “Following the conclusion of the review, it \r\nis expected that the Human Rights Council is now \r\nbetter equipped to face the many human rights \r\nchallenges of today’s world. In its five years of \r\nexistence, the foremost achievement of the \r\nA/66/PV.49  \r\n \r\n11-57707 2 \r\n \r\nCouncil has been the successful completion of the \r\nfirst cycle of the universal periodic review of the \r\nStates Members of the United Nations, which \r\nwere reviewed on the basis of equal treatment on \r\ntheir human rights records and performance. The \r\nspirit of cooperation and, above all, the \r\ncommitments displayed by the membership to \r\nimproving their human rights records is to be \r\ncommended. I look forward to the second cycle \r\nof reviews and to the implementation of the \r\ncommitments made. \r\n  “I also note with appreciation that the \r\nHuman Rights Council’s deliberations, \r\nparticularly in recent years, on collective and \r\nsolidarity rights such as the right to development, \r\nthe right to food, the right to safe drinking water \r\nand sanitation, environmental rights and even the \r\nright of peoples to peace, have very effectively \r\nengaged the international community’s \r\nexpectations in connection with these emerging \r\nrights. \r\n  “Also worthy of special mention are the \r\nmany panel discussions held on a broad range of \r\nhuman rights issues, which have either drawn \r\ninternational attention to new and emerging \r\nissues or broadened international understanding \r\nof others. The active participation of United \r\nNations entities and other international and regional \r\norganizations in these panel discussions — and more \r\ngenerally in the work of the Council — has also \r\ncontributed to human rights mainstreaming in the \r\nwork of the United Nations as a whole. \r\n  “I would also like to underscore the \r\nsignificant work carried out by the various \r\nspecial procedure mechanisms of the Council — \r\nthe eyes and ears of the human rights system. \r\nThey have a key role to play not only in human \r\nrights protection but also in broadening and \r\nadvancing the understanding of key human rights \r\nabuses. \r\n  “As members know, the theme of the sixty-\r\nsixth session of the General Assembly is \r\nmediation, and I hope that the Human Rights \r\nCouncil will continue to be instrumental in \r\nfostering dialogue among the many cultures and \r\ncivilizations, and be guided by the needed spirit \r\nof cooperation and the inherent value of \r\nmediation. In view of the importance of the \r\nCouncil’s work to the overall objectives of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, I myself look forward to \r\naddressing the March session of the Council next \r\nyear.” \r\n With the General Assembly’s full support for the \r\nwork of the Human Rights Council and for the able \r\nleadership of the current President, Her Excellency \r\nMs. Laura Dupuy Lasserre, I now have the pleasure to \r\ninvite her to introduce the report of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil. \r\n In accordance with General Assembly resolution \r\n65/281 of 17 June 2011, I now give the floor to Her \r\nExcellency Laura Dupuy Lasserre, President of the \r\nHuman Rights Council. \r\n Ms. Lasserre (Uruguay), President of the Human \r\nRights Council (spoke in Spanish): It is a great honour \r\nto present today to the Assembly the annual report of \r\nthe Human Rights Council (A/66/53 and \r\nA/66/53/Add.1). Allow me also to take this opportunity \r\nto congratulate Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on his \r\nelection and to sincerely wish him a successful tenure. \r\n The year 2011 marks the fifth year since the \r\nestablishment of the Human Rights Council. In \r\naccordance with resolution 60/251, the Council \r\nundertook a review process whose outcome was \r\nadopted by its members last March and by the General \r\nAssembly last June. \r\n The review process has proved to be a valuable \r\nopportunity to assess the effectiveness of the Council \r\nand of its working methods. Even though the outcome \r\ndocument does not include specific language on how \r\nthe Council could enhance its effectiveness in \r\nresponding to urgent human rights situations, the \r\nreview process has created a momentum for rising \r\nabove group politics and responding to such situations \r\non the ground in a timely and constructive manner. \r\n During the past year, the Council has held four \r\nspecial sessions in relation to the situations in Côte \r\nd’Ivoire, Libya and, on two occasions, the Syrian Arab \r\nRepublic, and has established commissions of inquiry \r\nand fact-finding missions in order to ascertain facts and \r\nto make recommendations in connection with human \r\nrights violations. \r\n Furthermore, at its most recent session, the \r\nCouncil held an interactive dialogue with the High \r\nCommissioner on specific country situations, including \r\non Yemen and Belarus, on which the Council will \r\n A/66/PV.49\r\n \r\n3 11-57707 \r\n \r\nfollow up. We held interactive dialogues promoted by \r\nconcerned States, including Somalia, and adopted a \r\nnumber of technical cooperation resolutions, also at the \r\nrequest of concerned States such as Tunisia and \r\nCambodia, as well as the Sudan and South Sudan. That \r\nreview process generated a series of follow-up tasks \r\nfor the Council. In my capacity as President and in \r\nfulfilment of the mandate with which I was entrusted \r\nby the Council, I established a task force to devise \r\nways of improving Secretariat services, accessibility to \r\nthe work of the Council for persons with disabilities, \r\nand the viability of using information technology. That \r\nteam will report back and present specific \r\nrecommendations to the Council during its nineteenth \r\nregular session. \r\n I have also begun consultations on the first \r\nannual high-level panel established to incorporate \r\nhuman rights in the general activities of the United \r\nNations system, to be held on 28 February 2012, \r\nduring the Council’s March session. The Council will \r\nshortly invite the heads of United Nations agencies to \r\nparticipate in that event as panellists alongside the \r\nSecretary-General, who, we hope, will deliver the \r\nopening statement. Under the broad focus of \r\ndevelopment and cooperation in the field of human \r\nrights, that panel will provide a favourable opportunity \r\nto assess the progress, achievements and challenges in \r\nmainstreaming human rights within the United Nations \r\nsystem in accordance with the mandate given to the \r\nCouncil by the General Assembly, as well as in \r\npromoting human rights mainstreaming at the national \r\nlevel. \r\n Another achievement of the review process was \r\nthe opening of new spaces for the participation in the \r\nCouncil of accredited national human rights \r\ninstitutions, in compliance with the Paris Principles. \r\nSuch institutions are key actors for improving the \r\nsituation on the ground, especially because of their \r\npotential to play a role in the follow-up \r\nrecommendations of the Universal Periodic Review \r\n(UPR), as well as of the special procedures. From now \r\non, their contributions to the UPR process will be \r\nreflected in a separate part of the summary of \r\nstakeholders’ information provided by my Office, and \r\nthey will be able to take the floor right after the State \r\nunder review at the adoption of the UPR regarding that \r\nState in Council plenary meetings. National institutions \r\nwill also be able to take the floor following the State \r\nconcerned after the presentation of country mission \r\nreports by special procedures. We began to implement \r\nthis new procedure last September. The review has also \r\nreinforced the quality of the selection process for \r\nholders of special procedures mandates. \r\n The annual report of the Council and its \r\naddendum, which I am presenting to the Assembly \r\ntoday, contain the resolutions and decisions adopted by \r\nthe Council at its sixteenth and seventeenth regular \r\nsessions and at its fourteenth, fifteenth and sixteenth \r\nspecial sessions, which took place under the presidency \r\nof my predecessor, Ambassador Sihasak Phuangketkeow, \r\nPermanent Representative of Thailand, and those adopted \r\nat the seventeenth special session and the eighteenth \r\nregular session under my presidency, which began on \r\n20 June. \r\n During its past three regular sessions, among \r\nother debates, the Council has held a total of 14 panel \r\ndiscussions designed to share the visions of a broad \r\nrange of actors, including United Nations experts on \r\nhuman rights and representatives from civil society, \r\nacademia, Governments and international and regional \r\norganizations. The themes of those panels included, \r\ninter alia, the rights of victims of terrorism; aspects of \r\nhuman rights in the context of measures adopted in \r\ncases of hostage-taking by terrorists; the rights of \r\nchildren who work or live on the street; violence \r\nagainst women; the health rights of older persons; the \r\nrole of international cooperation in improving the \r\nquality of life of persons with disabilities; the \r\nlanguages and cultures of indigenous peoples; best \r\npractices in the fight against racism, racial \r\ndiscrimination, xenophobia and related forms of \r\nintolerance; the complete fulfilment of the human \r\nrights of people of African descent; the strengthening \r\nof international initiatives aimed at promoting a \r\nworldwide dialogue that will encourage a culture of \r\ntolerance and peace at every level, based on respect for \r\nhuman rights and the diversity of religions and beliefs; \r\nthe promotion and protection of human rights in the \r\ncontext of peaceful protests; and the realization of the \r\nright to development. As should be evident, those \r\nthemes suggest the Council’s concern with identifying \r\nspecific forms of protection and challenges in \r\npromoting the rights of people who belong to a diverse \r\nrange of social groups.  \r\n The Council now has a total of 44 special \r\nprocedures under way, including both country and \r\nthematic mandates. The newly created mandates \r\ninclude the Special Rapporteur on the situation of \r\nA/66/PV.49  \r\n \r\n11-57707 4 \r\n \r\nhuman rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran, the \r\nindependent expert on the situation of human rights in \r\nCôte d’Ivoire, the Working Group on the issue of \r\nhuman rights and transnational corporations and other \r\nbusiness enterprises, the independent expert on the \r\npromotion of a democratic and equitable international \r\norder, and the Special Rapporteur on the promotion of \r\ntruth, justice, reparation and guarantees on non-recurrence. \r\n The Council has also undertaken standard-setting \r\nactivities through its working groups. The United \r\nNations declaration on human rights education and \r\ntraining and the Optional Protocol to the Convention \r\non the Rights of the Child providing for a \r\ncommunications procedure have been submitted to the \r\nGeneral Assembly for adoption. \r\n I am pleased to report that on 17 October, the \r\nWorking Group on the UPR concluded the last session \r\nof its inaugural work cycle. Although that cycle will \r\nformally end at the forthcoming regular session of the \r\nCouncil in March 2012, with the adoption of the \r\noutcome documents of the last seventeen States \r\nexamined, it is important to emphasize that the human \r\nrights situations of all 193 United Nations States \r\nMembers have been considered by the Working Group \r\nand by the Council, with most of the States under \r\nreview represented by very high-level ministers. That \r\nis a milestone in United Nations history. \r\n The second cycle of the UPR, which begins on \r\n21 May 2012, will be critical to the success of this \r\nmechanism. It will provide an opportunity for States \r\nand other stakeholders to take stock of developments \r\nsince the previous review, to examine the progress in \r\nthe implementation of recommendations, and to \r\nreassess the human rights situation in general. The \r\ntransition from a four-year to a four and a half-year \r\ncycle means that the Working Group will review \r\nfourteen countries, instead of sixteen, at each session. \r\nThe time available for each review will therefore \r\nincrease from three hours to three and a half. Some of \r\nthose adjustments require a few additional human and \r\nfinancial resources in terms of conference services. \r\nMost importantly, the General Assembly should keep \r\nin mind that, since the UPR’s creation in 2008, that \r\nsuccessful and valued mechanism has not received \r\nadequate funding from the regular budget, in particular \r\nwith regard to the timely and appropriate translation of \r\ndocuments. \r\n Before concluding, I would like to touch briefly \r\nupon the significant challenges facing the Human \r\nRights Council in terms of the resources it needs to \r\ncontinue its activities. As I mentioned earlier, the past \r\nyear has witnessed renewed attention by the Council to \r\nurgent human rights situations, leading to an increase \r\nin the number of resolutions and decisions adopted, \r\nwhich entails significant financial repercussions. While \r\nthe total cost of resources required by Human Rights \r\nCouncil mandates issued in 2010 was close to \r\n$5 million, this year the total rose to more than \r\n$24 million. The main reason for that increase stems \r\nfrom the establishment of four independent \r\ncommissions of inquiry and fact-finding missions, as \r\nwell as the creation of new special procedures \r\nmandates. Those amounts have a direct impact on \r\nconference service requirements; the Geneva \r\nconference capacity is underfunded and has already \r\nreached its limit, as a result of which a growing \r\nnumber of reports are not made available in all the \r\nofficial languages before being considered. As was \r\ndecided in the resolution adopted by the Human Rights \r\nCouncil on the review of its work and functioning, the \r\nGeneral Assembly will during this session consider the \r\nissue of making additional funds available quickly in \r\norder to implement urgent new mandates adopted by \r\nthe Council at each session. \r\n I would therefore like to ask for cooperation and \r\nsupport when the Fifth Committee addresses this \r\nimportant issue by giving positive consideration to the \r\noptions that may be presented in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report, particularly as regards the funding of \r\nunforeseen or extraordinary expenditures arising from \r\nthe Council’s resolutions and decisions. To that end, \r\nthe unexpected emergency expenditures mechanism \r\ncould be adjusted to cover the funding of urgent \r\nmandates with significant financial implications, such \r\nas fact-finding missions and independent international \r\ncommissions of inquiry. \r\n Pursuant to Assembly resolution 65/281, on the \r\nreview of the work and functioning of the Council, I \r\nwill, as an interim measure, hold the presidency until \r\nthe end of 2012 and will have the honour to return to \r\nthe Assembly next year in order to report on the \r\nCouncil’s activities during the period of my presidency. \r\nIn conclusion, I reiterate my commitment, not only to \r\nfollow up on the outcome of the review, but to oversee \r\ngenerally the efficient functioning of the Council \r\n A/66/PV.49\r\n \r\n5 11-57707 \r\n \r\nduring my tenure. I am grateful for the Council’s \r\nattention and support. \r\n Mr. Sefue (United Republic of Tanzania): The \r\nAfrican Group is grateful to the President of the \r\nHuman Rights Council and her entire staff for their \r\nengagement and efforts on behalf of the promotion and \r\nprotection of human rights in the world. The Group is \r\nvery much aware of how challenging her task is, for \r\nevery country in the world has its own issues and \r\nchallenges requiring attention. It is for this reason that \r\nthe African Group would like to express its support for \r\nher and her team and to reaffirm its commitment to the \r\nwork of the Human Rights Council. The African Group \r\nwould also like to emphasize that continued \r\nengagement on this subject with all stakeholders is key \r\nto arriving at an understanding of the issues on which \r\nMember States diverge and to advancing those that \r\nthey agree on. \r\n The African Group welcomes the opportunity to \r\nparticipate in this discussion. The Group has taken note \r\nof the efforts of the President of the Council to lead the \r\nCouncil towards a successful outcome of the review \r\nprocess. In particular, we appreciate the open format \r\nfor the second session of the Working Group, allowing \r\nfor the effective participation of members, observers \r\nand other stakeholders. \r\n The African Group believes that the Human \r\nRights Council, as a subsidiary body of the General \r\nAssembly, plays a crucial role in protecting and \r\nmainstreaming human rights worldwide. Last year, \r\nwithin its mandate, the General Assembly carried out \r\nnegotiations on the review of the Council with a view \r\nto strengthening the Council’s functions and methods \r\nof work. The African Group welcomes the consensus \r\napproach and outcome that resulted from those \r\nnegotiations, as well as the coordinated approach \r\nbetween Geneva and New York during the review \r\nprocess. That practice should be strengthened, and the \r\nAfrican Group is confident that we will all benefit from \r\nthe new practice of holding an interactive dialogue \r\nbetween the Third Committee and the President of the \r\nHuman Rights Council. \r\n The African Group reaffirms its support for the \r\nGeneral Assembly decision to allocate the agenda item \r\non the report of the Human Rights Council both to the \r\nAssembly plenary and to the Third Committee. We are \r\npleased that the President of the Human Rights Council \r\nis now able to present the report in his or her capacity \r\nas President to the plenary meetings of the General \r\nAssembly and the Third Committee. Those bodies are \r\nnow able to consider and act on all recommendations \r\nof the Council to the Assembly, including those that \r\ndeal with the development of international law in the \r\nfield of human rights. \r\n The Group looks forward to reinforcing the \r\nCouncil’s efforts to combat all forms of discrimination \r\naround the world on the grounds of race, sex, language \r\nor religion, particularly discrimination against women, \r\nand deal with issues regarding national, ethnic, \r\nreligious or linguistic minorities and migrants and \r\nothers who face varying degrees of social \r\nmarginalization and discrimination. Our endeavour in \r\nthat regard should be to avoid the imposition of \r\ncontroversial notions that have no basis in international \r\nhuman rights law and international humanitarian law, \r\nand that do not take into account the differing social, \r\ncultural and value systems in different societies. \r\n Finally, the African Group encourages the Human \r\nRights Council to continue and intensify its \r\ncollaboration with the Office of the High \r\nCommissioner for Human Rights in line with the \r\nrelevant resolutions of the General Assembly. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to the \r\nobserver of the European Union. \r\n Mr. Mayr-Harting (European Union): I would \r\nfirst like to express our satisfaction at the great interest \r\nthis important subject is generating among the \r\nmembership of the United Nations, and, more \r\nspecifically, among major groups in the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n I have the honour to speak on behalf of the \r\nEuropean Union (EU). The candidate countries Turkey, \r\nCroatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, \r\nMontenegro and Iceland, the countries of the \r\nStabilisation and Association Process and potential \r\ncandidates Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and \r\nSerbia, as well as Ukraine, align themselves with this \r\nstatement. \r\n The European Union thanks the President of the \r\nHuman Rights Council, Ambassador Laura Dupuy \r\nLasserre, for presenting the Human Rights Council’s \r\nsixth annual report (A/66/53 and A/66/53/Add.1) to the \r\nGeneral Assembly. We also appreciated this morning’s \r\nopportunity to hold an interactive dialogue with the \r\nCouncil’s President. \r\nA/66/PV.49  \r\n \r\n11-57707 6 \r\n \r\n From the outset, the European Union has been a \r\nstrong supporter of the Human Rights Council as the \r\nmain body of the United Nations human rights \r\nmachinery. The Union attaches great importance to the \r\ncredibility and effectiveness of the Council, and will \r\ncontinue to make every effort to ensure that it is able to \r\nfulfil its mandate responsibly and effectively and that it \r\ncontributes to tangible improvements of the human \r\nrights situation on the ground. Even now that the \r\nreview process is over, the European Union believes \r\nthat we must use every occasion to enable the Council \r\nto fulfil the commitments undertaken and to live up to \r\nthe expectations that the world at large has of it. The \r\nHuman Rights Council has the responsibility to address \r\nsituations of violations of human rights, including \r\ngross and systematic violations that require urgent \r\naction on the part of the international community. \r\n In that regard, the European Union is very \r\npleased to note that the Council has played a leading \r\nrole in taking up recent events in the Middle East and \r\nelsewhere. In particular, the action taken by the \r\nCouncil to address urgent human rights situations in \r\nCote d’Ivoire, Libya, Syria, Belarus — a neighbour of \r\nthe European Union — and Yemen is exemplary and \r\nshows that it functioning as it is intended to. The \r\nEuropean Union hopes that the Council will continue \r\nto follow such developments and take action where \r\nnecessary. \r\n Serving as a member of the Council entails \r\nimportant responsibilities. Resolution 60/251 provides \r\nthat members elected to the Council shall uphold the \r\nhighest standards in the promotion and protection of \r\nhuman rights. As the EU has regularly underlined, most \r\nrecently in the context of the review process of the \r\nHuman Rights Council, that principle should guide \r\nboth the election of members to the Council and their \r\nconduct during their tenure. In that respect, it is \r\nsignificant to recall that in February, the special session \r\non the human rights situation in Libya not only \r\nexpressed strong concern about the human rights \r\nsituation in that country, but also recommended the \r\nsuspension of Libya’s membership in the Human \r\nRights Council. The General Assembly did the same on \r\n1 March in an unprecedented move. Against that \r\nemblematic case, we encourage all to pay more \r\nattention to the human rights records and commitments \r\nof States when electing members to the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, as well as throughout their membership. \r\n The European Union also attaches the greatest \r\nimportance to special procedures, the eyes and ears of \r\nthe Council. Given the deteriorating situation in Iran, \r\nwe welcome the establishment, during the period \r\ncovered by the report, of a new mandate on that \r\ncountry and the extension of the mandates of the \r\nSpecial Rapporteurs on the situation of human rights in \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Myanmar \r\nand Cambodia. The Council also renewed the mandates \r\nof the independent experts on the situation of human \r\nrights in the Sudan, Somalia and Haiti. The Council \r\ncommitted to providing technical assistance and \r\ncapacity-building to the Government of South Sudan to \r\npromote human rights, upon its request. \r\n Thematic special procedures play an equally \r\noutstanding role, through their research, country visits \r\nand their valuable contribution to the better \r\nunderstanding of the content of specific human rights \r\nand their contribution to the enhancement and \r\nrealization of human rights standards. Among the many \r\nthematic special procedures, let me highlight the \r\nSpecial Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, a \r\nmandate established 25 years ago, as a follow-up to the \r\n1981 Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of \r\nIntolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or \r\nBelief. \r\n In order to allow special procedures to perform \r\ntheir role, it is crucial that mandate holders be able to \r\ncarry out their assessments in an independent manner \r\nand that they draw the Council’s attention to human \r\nrights issues and situations. The ability of mandate \r\nholders to undertake country visits and establish direct \r\ncontact with the relevant governmental structures, as \r\nwell as other national and regional stakeholders, \r\nespecially civil society, is of crucial importance. All \r\nStates members of the European Union have extended \r\na standing invitation to the special procedures. The EU \r\ncalls upon all United Nations members to do likewise \r\nand to actively cooperate with them. \r\n Over the year, the Council has contributed to the \r\nfurther development and understanding of international \r\nnorms and standards in the field of human rights. It has \r\nsuccessfully achieved the adoption of the draft third \r\noptional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of \r\nthe Child and of the draft United Nations declaration \r\non human rights education and training. We support \r\naction on those issues later this month in the Third \r\nCommittee, and their adoption by the General \r\nAssembly before the end of the year. \r\n A/66/PV.49\r\n \r\n7 11-57707 \r\n \r\n The Council is also mandated to monitor the \r\nimplementation of international human rights law and \r\nstandards. Only through objective monitoring and \r\nreporting can the Council identify the needs of victims \r\nand possible areas for capacity-building and technical \r\nassistance to States. The strengthening of international \r\ncooperation and the development of capacity-building \r\nand activities in the area of technical measures \r\nremained a strong area for involvement in the Council, \r\nwith important initiatives adopted in support of the \r\nefforts of the authorities of Cambodia, Kyrgyzstan, \r\nTunisia, Guinea and the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo. \r\n In situations that may give rise to grave violations \r\nof international human rights law or humanitarian law, \r\nthe Council should also act in a timely and effective \r\nmanner. The creation of commissions of inquiry and \r\nfact-finding missions during the past year was \r\ntherefore an important step in that regard. The \r\nEuropean Union calls upon all States to fully cooperate \r\nwith the missions in order to ensure that there is no \r\nimpunity for such violations. I would also like to recall \r\nthat, in the course of the review process of the Council, \r\nthe European Union made a number of additional \r\nsuggestions aimed at enhancing the Council’s reaction \r\nto situations of concern. We still believe that there is \r\nscope to improve the Council’s capacity to have an \r\nimpact on the ground, particularly in responding to \r\nhuman rights violations in real time and in helping to \r\nprevent further abuses. \r\n The Universal Periodic Review complements the \r\nspecial procedures and the other human rights tools \r\nand mechanisms that monitor and address human rights \r\nsituations. We welcome the completion of the first \r\ncycle of the review and encourage the comprehensive \r\nand swift implementation of its recommendations, \r\nincluding by drawing on international assistance to that \r\neffect. The European Union also encourages all States \r\nto fully cooperate with all relevant stakeholders in the \r\npreparation for the review process by promoting \r\nconsultations with national parliaments, national \r\nhuman rights institutions and civil society \r\nrepresentatives. As the Universal Periodic Review \r\nprocess moves into its second cycle, the focus should \r\nhenceforth be on implementation and follow-up, thus \r\nenhancing the credibility and impact of that mechanism \r\nof the Council. \r\n The Human Rights Council also has an important \r\nrole to play as a forum for dialogue and the exchange \r\nof best practices and experiences on a wide range of \r\nthematic human rights issues, and thus the \r\nadvancement of the human rights agenda. I would just \r\nlike to highlight the following important developments. \r\n First, the Council requested the High \r\nCommissioner for Human Rights to commission a \r\nstudy to document discriminatory laws and practices \r\nand acts of violence against individuals based on their \r\nsexual orientation and gender identity, in all regions of \r\nthe world, and decided to convene a panel discussion \r\non the basis of the report. We look forward to that \r\nimportant event and expect to participate actively in \r\nthe proceedings. \r\n Secondly, the Council endorsed the Guiding \r\nPrinciples on Business and Human Rights: \r\nImplementing the United Nations “Protect, Respect and \r\nRemedy” Framework and launched a follow-up \r\nmechanism to the work of the Special Representative \r\nof the Secretary-General on the Issue of Human Rights \r\nand Transnational Corporations and other Business \r\nEnterprises. We envisage close cooperation with the \r\nWorking Group on Transnational Corporations, so as to \r\ncontribute to the effective implementation of the \r\nGuiding Principles. \r\n During the reporting period, the Council also \r\ncontinued to mainstream human rights into the overall \r\nUnited Nations system. Moreover, the European Union \r\nhighly values the role of civil society organizations and \r\nnational human rights institutions for their important \r\ncontribution to the work of the Council. We look \r\nforward to continuing and further developing their \r\ncooperation with the Council. \r\n In conclusion, let me reiterate the European \r\nUnion’s strong commitment to contributing to the work \r\nof the Human Rights Council, to further strengthening \r\nits role in helping to develop international human \r\nrights law, to systematically upholding and ensuring \r\nthe implementation of existing international norms and \r\nstandards, and to promoting the observance by all \r\nStates of all human rights and fundamental freedoms. \r\n I wish to thank the Acting President for ensuring \r\nthe good functioning of this meeting. We believe that \r\nthe substance of the issue is so important that we \r\ndecided to leave discussions on some open procedural \r\nquestions for another day.  \r\n Mr. Sugavanam (India): My delegation would \r\nlike to thank the President of the Human Rights \r\nA/66/PV.49  \r\n \r\n11-57707 8 \r\n \r\nCouncil for her presentation of the reports of the \r\nHuman Rights Council (A/65/53 and A/65/53/Add.1), \r\nunder agenda item 64. \r\n The Human Rights Council, established in 2006, \r\nhas strengthened efforts to promote and protect human \r\nrights globally. We are encouraged by the broad \r\nconsensus that the Council has been able to achieve in \r\naddressing human rights issues in a more constructive \r\nmanner. The Council has been a considerable \r\nimprovement over its predecessor, the Commission on \r\nHuman Rights. We believe that this has been possible \r\nin large measure owing to the Council’s non-selective \r\nand transparent approach to promoting and protecting \r\nall human rights and fundamental freedoms for all. \r\n We welcome the successful completion of the \r\nreview process, in which India actively participated. \r\nThe review process has provided a road map for further \r\nstreamlining the Council’s work methods and \r\nfunctioning, as reflected in the outcome document \r\n(resolution 65/281, annex) adopted by the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-fifth session. We must \r\nconsciously ensure that the Council continues to \r\nfunction in a non-selective, non-politicized and \r\ntransparent manner. \r\n We consider the Universal Periodic Review to be \r\na positive, universal, transparent mechanism in which \r\nall stakeholders directly or indirectly participate, and \r\nthat fact strengthens our commitment to making a \r\ngenuine improvement in the human rights situation on \r\nthe ground.  \r\n We also acknowledge the important role played \r\nby treaty bodies in monitoring the implementation of \r\ntreaty obligations by the State parties. The \r\nrecommendations made and best practices identified by \r\nthose bodies have strengthened domestic legal regimes \r\nand assisted Governments in capacity-building in the \r\narea of human rights.  \r\n We welcome the practice of presenting the report \r\nof the Human Rights Council directly to the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n We must also ensure that the decisions of the \r\nGeneral Assembly on the report of the Council, \r\nespecially those with financial implications, can be \r\nconsidered quickly by the Advisory Committee on \r\nAdministrative and Budgetary Questions and the Fifth \r\nCommittee, so as to minimize delays. \r\n We reiterate our firm commitment to continue to \r\nengage constructively with all Member States in \r\nmaking the Human Rights Council a strong, effective \r\nand efficient body, capable of promoting and protecting \r\nthe human rights and fundamental freedoms of all.  \r\n Ms. Rodríguez Camejo (Cuba) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): Five years have passed since the Human \r\nRights Council began its work, and we greatly \r\nappreciate its efforts.  \r\n The Council was established as a result of the \r\nurgent need to tackle the double standards, \r\nconfrontation and political manipulation of its \r\npredecessor, the Commission on Human Rights. We \r\nmust ensure that the Council does not repeat the \r\nharmful practices that ultimately discredited the former \r\nCommission. Cuba has very clearly stated that it rejects \r\nthe imposition of such practices.  \r\n We are concerned by the Council’s tendency to \r\nperpetuate the practice of selectivity and the \r\napplication of double standards in its consideration of \r\nhuman rights situations, when its work should be \r\nguided instead by cooperation and respectful dialogue.  \r\n Cuba played a very active role in the \r\nestablishment of the Human Rights Council and as a \r\nnegotiator at each stage of the review process, which \r\nwas conducted in Geneva and New York between \r\nMarch 2010 and June 2011, with a view to fine-tuning \r\nand consolidating the Council’s work in its first five \r\nyears of operations. \r\n The outcome of the review process was \r\nfavourable for developing countries. It was possible to \r\nretain the core elements of the Council’s institution-\r\nbuilding package and the provisions of resolution \r\n60/251 establishing the Council.  \r\n The Universal Periodic Review is the only \r\nuniversal mechanism in place for the comprehensive \r\nanalysis of the human rights situation in all countries, \r\nand it is what mainly distinguishes the Council from \r\nthe former Commission. That mechanism has proven \r\nits importance as a foundation for international \r\ncooperation in the field of human rights on the basis of \r\nconstructive dialogue and respect for the principles of \r\nuniversality, objectivity, impartiality and non-selectivity.  \r\n The Council has demonstrated its capacity to \r\nrespond to emergencies that require the attention of the \r\ninternational community. It has frequently studied \r\n A/66/PV.49\r\n \r\n9 11-57707 \r\n \r\nIsrael’s grave violations of the human rights of the \r\nPalestinian people.  \r\n The convening of special sessions to address \r\nthematic issues represents a milestone in the work of \r\nthe Council. The first of those, organized by Cuba on \r\nbehalf of the Non-Aligned Movement, provided room \r\nfor debate and suggestions on how to respond to the \r\nserious impact of the world food crisis on the exercise \r\nof the human right to food. Those initiatives \r\ndemonstrate the Council’s capacity to respond in \r\nemergency situations, which are neither confined \r\nwithin national borders nor derived from internal \r\nconflict or international disputes.  \r\n With regard to funding, double standards have \r\nunfortunately also seeped into the work of the Council. \r\nWestern countries have no objections when the Council \r\naddresses issues in line with their strategic interests, \r\nincluding through country resolutions, commissions of \r\ninquiry and fact-finding missions, in spite of the \r\nsignificant costs that are sometimes involved. \r\nHowever, they block the draft resolutions introduced \r\nby developing countries, citing budget constraints and \r\narguing that such activities should be undertaken \r\nwithin existing resources. The international community \r\nexpects us to respond collectively and effectively to all \r\ncrises that are having an impact on humankind and, in \r\nparticular, on the countries of the South. \r\n When the world is facing serious challenges — \r\nwhich have been unpredictable in their scale — such as \r\nthose arising from the profound economic, financial, \r\nenergy, environmental, food and social crises affecting \r\nthe planet, the right to international solidarity becomes \r\nan urgent demand, and the Council must uphold that \r\nright.  \r\n As long as an unjust and exclusive international \r\neconomic and political order remains in place, the \r\nCouncil must continue to speak out for an international \r\norder that is democratic and equitable. While coercive \r\nunilateral measures are imposed and unrelenting \r\nblockades, like the one that Cuba has suffered from for \r\nover 50 years now, remain in place, the Council must \r\nreject such practices and demand that an end be put to \r\nthem. We also reaffirm the need to ensure that the \r\nCouncil’s special procedures uphold the principles of \r\nobjectivity and impartiality and in general terms \r\nrespect the code of conduct that was adopted during the \r\ninstitution-building phase of the Council.  \r\n Cuba has worked for the promotion and \r\nprotection of all human rights in the Council, has \r\nsubmitted numerous resolutions in the area of \r\neconomic, social and cultural rights with the aim of \r\nensuring that those rights are placed on the same level \r\nas civil and political rights.  \r\n Cuba reiterates its desire to cooperate with the \r\nCouncil and with the human rights machinery of the \r\nUnited Nations system and its institutions providing \r\nuniversal application in a non-discriminatory manner. \r\nWe confirm our desire to enter into dialogue with all \r\nStates based on mutual respect, acceptance of \r\nsovereign equality and recognition of the right of all \r\npeoples to select their political system and institutions. \r\n Mr. Wenaweser (Liechtenstein): I would like to \r\nthank the President of the Human Rights Council, \r\nAmbassador Dupuy Lasserre, for her comprehensive \r\nreport to the General Assembly on the work of the \r\nCouncil (A/66/53 and A/66/53/Add.1). She has \r\npresented the report on a successful year for the \r\nCouncil, which has, moreover, undergone a thorough \r\nand comprehensive review both of its work and \r\nfunctioning and of its status in relation to the General \r\nAssembly. While ambitious ideas to improve the work \r\nof the Council did not culminate in agreement, several \r\nmeasures could be adopted to fine-tune its proceedings \r\nand institutional relationships.  \r\n Given the strong performance of the Council \r\nduring the period covered in the report, we are \r\nconvinced that the modest results of the review process \r\nreflect a general perception of the Council as a well-\r\nfunctioning institution and the respect and authority it \r\nhas gained over the years through its work. However, \r\nthat perception should not have prevented us from \r\ntaking more decisive action, in particular in the areas \r\nof funding and the processing of the Council’s \r\nrecommendations.  \r\n The difficulties that the Council has had in \r\nfunding its decisions within the framework of special \r\nsessions are now putting regular Council activities in \r\njeopardy. We therefore hope that the Fifth Committee \r\nwill grant the High Commissioner access to the \r\nunforeseen and extraordinary expenses mechanism to \r\nfund the implementation of Council mandates aimed at \r\naddressing human rights emergencies. \r\n On the basis of the broad consultations during the \r\nreview of the Council, which I had the honour to \r\nfacilitate together with my distinguished colleague and \r\nA/66/PV.49  \r\n \r\n11-57707 10 \r\n \r\nfriend Ambassador Loulichki of Morocco, we expected \r\nthe time to be ripe to send a consensual message of \r\nsupport to the Council from this body. Still, the review \r\nhas resulted in the broadest possible support for the \r\nCouncil, short of consensus. The exceptional element \r\nto point out in that exercise is the constructive \r\ncooperation between Geneva and New York throughout \r\nthe entire process. In an often sensitive political \r\nenvironment, the frequent exchanges and the \r\ncommitment to close coordination between the \r\nPresidents of the Council and the General Assembly \r\nhave set the stage for the smooth execution of our task. \r\nWe see in that effort a model of close cooperation \r\nbetween Geneva and New York and encourage its \r\ncontinuation to the mutual benefit of both bodies. \r\n The enhanced authority of the Council is a \r\nconsequence of an increasingly comprehensive \r\nimplementation of its mandate during the last year, in \r\nparticular in the areas of urgent human rights crises, \r\nthematic human rights issues, standard setting and the \r\nUniversal Periodic Review (UPR). Led by continued \r\nefforts on the part of the High Commissioner to raise \r\nawareness on human rights emergencies in a \r\nnon-selective and fact-based manner, the Council \r\nreacted swiftly and adequately to address the situations \r\nin Côte d’Ivoire, Libya and Syria. Unfortunately, \r\nequally urgent action by the Council was not taken in \r\nthe cases of Bahrain, Yemen and Sri Lanka, where such \r\naction would have been justified. We welcome the \r\nappointment of a Special Rapporteur on the human \r\nrights situation in the Islamic Republic of Iran as an \r\nimportant step towards accountability and call for full \r\ncooperation with the mandate in that regard.  \r\n We particularly welcome the landmark decision \r\nof the Council to mandate a study into discrimination \r\nand human rights violations experienced by persons on \r\nthe basis of their sexual orientation or gender identity. \r\nWe sincerely hope that that report will be the basis for \r\na more pragmatic and constructive dialogue on the \r\npromotion and protection of all human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms for those persons who find \r\nthemselves in a particularly vulnerable position owing \r\nto their sexual orientation or gender identity. \r\n In the field of standard-setting, we particularly \r\nwelcome the consensual adoption of the Optional \r\nProtocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. \r\nThe Protocol fills an important gap in the treaty-based \r\nhuman rights protection and accountability framework. \r\nIn addition, we welcome the endorsement by the \r\nCouncil of the Guiding Principles on Business and \r\nHuman Rights. They too will serve as an important \r\nguidance tool in an area where protection had \r\npreviously been limited.  \r\n Finally, we commend the Council for the \r\nsuccessful completion of the first cycle of the \r\nUniversal Periodic Review. The UPR has quickly given \r\nrise to the most significant and comprehensive \r\nassessment of the global human rights landscape. It has \r\nbrought a large number of recommendations to all \r\nStates under review, on which it will be crucial to \r\nensure follow-up. Meaningful follow-up can be assured \r\nonly if we as States are also ready to engage on \r\nrecommendations that we have previously rejected. On \r\nthat basis, a qualified assessment of the progress made \r\nduring the second cycle will be possible and also will \r\ntestify to the usefulness of the UPR as an instrument \r\nfor the promotion and protection of human rights.  \r\n We wish President Dupuy Lasserre a good start \r\non this exercise next June. She will be the only Council \r\nPresident who will have the opportunity to present an \r\nannual report to the General Assembly twice. We \r\nalready look forward to welcoming her back here next \r\nyear. \r\n Mr. Hassan Ahmed (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nFirst of all, I would like to thank Ms. Laura Dupuy \r\nLasserre, President of the Human Rights Council, for \r\nher detailed presentation to the General Assembly. We \r\nwould like to congratulate her on her wise leadership \r\nof the Council and wish her every success in her task.  \r\n Five years ago, the Human Rights Council was \r\nestablished, which was an important milestone in the \r\nwork of the General Assembly and its subsidiary \r\nbodies. The Council has to deal with human rights, \r\nwith all countries on an equal footing, through what is \r\nknown as the Universal Periodic Review mechanism, \r\nin which all countries without exception must \r\nparticipate. However, thanks to resolution 60/251, \r\nthere is a mechanism of special procedures, which can \r\nbe extremely helpful in eliminating politicization, \r\npartiality and selectivity. The Human Rights Council \r\nhas further adopted resolutions 5/2 in 2007 and 11/11 \r\nin June 2009 on such special procedures. \r\n I would like to confirm the Sudan’s cooperation \r\nwith the Human Rights Council. I am pleased to report \r\nthat the Sudan has submitted, in Geneva, its first report \r\nunder the Universal Periodic Review mechanism. \r\nMany people were involved in preparing the report, \r\n A/66/PV.49\r\n \r\n11 11-57707 \r\n \r\nincluding the Government, various organizations and \r\ncivil society. In addition to describing the human rights \r\nsituation, the report described the democratic \r\ntransformation, the recent parliamentary and \r\npresidential elections in the Sudan and the signing of \r\nthe Doha Document for Peace in Darfur, which has \r\nresulted in reduced violence and an improvement of the \r\nhuman rights situation in Darfur. The report also \r\ndescribed ways in which the Sudan has complied with \r\nall of its peace obligations, as well as its acceptance of \r\nthe outcome of the referendum on South Sudan.  \r\n In addition to those positive developments, the \r\nSudan has also become party to the Convention on the \r\nRights of the Child and its Optional Protocol and has \r\nrecently confirmed its readiness to comply with and \r\nimplement the recommendations made to us in the \r\nReview.  \r\n My country welcomes the adoption by the Human \r\nRights Council, at its most recent session in September, \r\nof resolution 18/16 under agenda item 10, which, in its \r\nparagraph 11, extended, with a special mandate, the \r\nterm of the independent expert on the situation of \r\nhuman rights in the Sudan. The decision taken by the \r\nHuman Rights Council has confirmed that there has \r\nbeen an improvement and positive developments in the \r\nhuman rights situation in the Sudan. We welcome the \r\nCouncil’s decision on the mandate of the independent \r\nexpert and will endeavour to establish an independent \r\noffice on human rights in the Sudan. The legislature \r\nhas already approved that request and the office will be \r\nestablished shortly. \r\n Lastly, my country wishes for the necessary \r\nfinancial resources to be made available to the Council, \r\nin order for the Secretariat to carry out its work, in \r\nparticular on priority issues involving human rights in \r\nthe economic, social and cultural sectors. Those should \r\nbe given consideration equal to that given to civil and \r\npolitical rights. \r\n Ms. AlGharabally (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nToday, the General Assembly is considering an \r\nimportant agenda item. I therefore I wish to thank the \r\nHuman Rights Council for the report contained in \r\ndocument A/66/53, that summarizes the work of the \r\ninternational community to promote human rights and \r\nits continued efforts to strengthen and protect the \r\nfundamental principles of human rights.  \r\n My delegation is pleased to express its gratitude \r\nto the Member States of the General Assembly for their \r\nconfidence in electing Kuwait as a member of the \r\nHuman Rights Council for the period 2011-2013 and \r\naffirming, through that membership, Kuwait’s \r\ncommitment to making its most sincere efforts towards \r\nthe promotion and protection of the principles of \r\nhuman rights, while affirming the important role of the \r\nHuman Rights Council in combating racism, \r\nintolerance and discrimination and appreciating the \r\nconcrete efforts of Member States in this regard.  \r\n The advancement and progress of peoples and \r\nnations is measured by their commitment to, and \r\nrespect for, human rights. The Charter of the United \r\nNations urges the promotion of human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms and calls upon all of us to join \r\nour efforts to ensure the success of that endeavour. \r\nNothing should prevent any individual — no matter \r\nhow diverse human beings may be in terms of race, \r\nreligion or belief — from enjoying the full spectrum of \r\nfundamental rights. \r\n My delegation has studied with great interest the \r\nreport under this item. I would like to affirm Kuwait’s \r\ncommitment to human rights standards. The Kuwaiti \r\nConstitution of 1962 confirms the rules, agreements \r\nand norms of human rights. My country has \r\nconsecrated those rights, including the right to life and \r\nthe right to freedom of opinion and expression. \r\nArticle 7 of the Constitution affirms that freedom, \r\njustice and equality constitute the pillars of society and \r\nthat cooperation and mutual understanding ensure close \r\nbonds among citizens. Article 29 of the Constitution \r\nprovides for all persons to enjoy equal human dignity \r\nand equality before the law in terms of duties and \r\nrights, without discrimination based on gender, \r\nethnicity, language or religion. Kuwait has also given \r\nmultiple rights to women, who enjoy full legal \r\npersonhood and full political rights. Women have also \r\nassumed many leadership positions in the State through \r\ndirect election.  \r\n Also, women account for 8 per cent of the total \r\nnumber of members of the Kuwaiti Parliamentary \r\nCouncil. My country has also sought to provide \r\nwelfare for children, based on its constitutional \r\ncommitments and on the instruments and treatises to \r\nwhich it is party. Kuwait believes in the role of civil \r\nsociety organizations and freedom of opinion and of \r\nthe press. It has promulgated a number of relevant laws \r\nincluding 3/2006 and 61/2007, which have organized \r\nthe work of the media in all its forms. That has ensured \r\nan atmosphere of greater openness, transparency and \r\nA/66/PV.49  \r\n \r\n11-57707 12 \r\n \r\ngreater democracy. Article 31 of the Kuwaiti \r\nConstitution protects all human beings from torture, \r\noppression and abuse. Such an atmosphere of freedom \r\naims to create a healthy environment and promote the \r\nexchange of views, ideas and dialogue. It would also \r\nguarantee increased popular participation in decision-\r\nmaking in Kuwait, which would provide greater \r\nstability and prosperity, and thus promote the \r\nadvancement of my country. \r\n In affirming the established principles of Kuwaiti \r\nforeign policy — the promotion of international peace \r\nand security, the renunciation of violence and respect \r\nof human rights — we provide a high level of \r\nhumanitarian assistance through governmental and \r\nnon-governmental organizations to various people in \r\norder to promote human rights and human dignity.  \r\n On the other hand, Kuwait has increased its \r\nestablished voluntary contributions to the Office of the \r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights \r\nto support its efforts and mandated functions. In that \r\nregard, in discussing human rights and the need to \r\nstrengthen respect for human rights, we must \r\nvigorously denounce the oppressive Israeli policies and \r\npractices that continue to violate the fundamental \r\nhuman rights of the defenceless Palestinian people in \r\nthe occupied territories.  \r\n We also call upon the international community to \r\nassume its responsibility in order to compel Israel, the \r\noccupying Power, to comply with resolutions of \r\ninternational legitimacy and renounce its expansionist \r\nand aggressive policies; and to compel it to respect \r\ninternational humanitarian law and the principles of \r\nhuman rights. \r\n Kuwait is fully convinced of the need to respect \r\nhuman rights and will spare no effort to defend them. It \r\naffirms its conviction through its participation in all \r\ninternational forums and United Nations organizations \r\nand governmental and non-governmental organizations \r\nconcerned with questions of human rights, since \r\ncooperation in that regard is the optimum means to \r\nadvance peoples and nations. \r\n Ms. Hernando (Philippines): At the outset, I \r\nwould like to thank the President for this opportunity \r\nto speak on the report of the Human Rights Council \r\n(A/66/53 and Add.1). This agenda item is of particular \r\nimportance to the Philippines as a founding and \r\nre-elected member of the Council. We thank the \r\nPresident of the Council, Ambassador Laura Dupuy \r\nLasserre, for presenting the Council’s sixth annual \r\nreport to the Assembly. \r\n In 1948, the United Nations elaborated a common \r\nstandard of achievement for all peoples of all nations, \r\nbased on the core principles of universality, equality, \r\nfairness and non-discrimination. Crafted in a world \r\nravaged by the horrors of war, the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights articulates our highest \r\naspirations for freedom from fear and want and our \r\ncommitment to protecting the sanctity and dignity of \r\nevery human life, regardless of race or creed. \r\n More than 60 years after the adoption of the \r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, our quest to \r\nattain our highest aspirations continues. Peace and \r\nprosperity remain elusive. There are widening poverty \r\ngaps, food shortages, climate change, economic crises, \r\narmed conflicts, rising unemployment, popular unrest \r\nand the other pressing challenges confronting our \r\nworld today. Many children, women and men still live \r\nin dire need of the fulfilment of their entitlement to a \r\nlife of dignity, freedom and equal opportunity.  \r\n But despite the elusiveness of our highest goals \r\nand aspirations, we remain hopeful. The establishment \r\nof the Human Rights Council, aimed at strengthening \r\nthe United Nations human rights machinery to ensure \r\nthe effective enjoyment by all of every human right — \r\ncivil, political, economic, social and cultural, including \r\nthe right to development — is but one of the \r\nmanifestations of our continuing faith in and enduring \r\ncommitment to the values and principles of the \r\nUniversal Declaration. \r\n The formal process of review of the status of the \r\nCouncil, as well as of its work and functioning in \r\nGeneva, which culminated in the adoption of Assembly \r\nresolution 65/281 in June, provided us with an \r\nopportunity to take stock of the gains made by this \r\nrelatively young institution. The Council has made \r\nreasonable progress in fulfilling its mandate, as set out \r\nin Assembly resolution 60/251. Its workload has \r\nincreased markedly since its inception, and the \r\ngrowing number of cross-regional initiatives in the \r\nCouncil demonstrates delegations’ positive engagement \r\nand cooperation in working towards more practical and \r\nforward-looking approaches to addressing pressing \r\neconomic, social, cultural or humanitarian concerns. \r\n The Universal Periodic Review (UPR), with its \r\nintergovernmental and peer-review nature, remains the \r\nCouncil’s most innovative and effective mechanism for \r\n A/66/PV.49\r\n \r\n13 11-57707 \r\n \r\nensuring that States fulfil their responsibility to respect \r\nand implement human rights and fundamental \r\nfreedoms. There is a need, however, to further \r\nstrengthen the UPR if we are to bring to fruition our \r\nvision of an ever-responsive mechanism for the \r\nimprovement of the human rights situation in all \r\ncountries and for addressing human rights violations \r\nwherever they occur. \r\n The Philippines believes that the Council should \r\nbe a partner with all States and stakeholders in the \r\npromotion and protection of all human rights, with a \r\nstrong focus on capacity-building and international \r\ncooperation. It must continue to work in a constructive \r\nmanner, fostering dialogue and cooperation and \r\nengaging in meaningful interaction with States and all \r\nstakeholders at national and international levels.  \r\n The special procedures play an important role in \r\npromoting and protecting human rights. The \r\nindependence of mandate holders is vital to their work, \r\nbut it must always be balanced by important \r\nconsiderations such as professionalism, integrity, \r\nefficiency and effectiveness. \r\n As a founding and re-elected member of the \r\nCouncil, the Philippines endeavours to contribute \r\nconstructively to the efficient and effective work of the \r\nCouncil and to continue to focus on the importance of \r\nachieving national, regional and international human \r\nrights goals, standards and strategies. It is the main \r\nsponsor of initiatives in the Council on human rights \r\nand extreme poverty and on combating trafficking in \r\npersons, especially women and children. It traditionally \r\nsponsors initiatives on the protection of the human \r\nrights of vulnerable groups such as migrants, women, \r\nindigenous peoples and persons with disabilities and is \r\na member of the cross-regional Platform for Human \r\nRights Education and Training, composed of Costa \r\nRica, Italy, Morocco, Philippines, Senegal, Slovenia \r\nand Switzerland. \r\n The Philippines is pleased to note that at its \r\nsixteenth session the Council adopted the United \r\nNations Declaration on Human Rights Education and \r\nTraining. The Declaration is the first reference \r\ndocument entirely created by the Human Rights \r\nCouncil since its establishment in 2006. It provides a \r\nclear and precise definition of human rights education \r\nand training, their scope and principles, and the various \r\nmeans for ensuring their effective implementation. At \r\nits eighteenth session, the Council also adopted another \r\nimportant resolution, initiated by the Philippines and \r\nBangladesh, concerning the adverse impacts of climate \r\nchange on the full enjoyment of human rights. \r\n Finally, 2011 marks the twenty-fifth anniversary \r\nof the Declaration on the Right to Development, which \r\nunequivocally established development as a right and \r\nput people at the centre of the development process. \r\nTaking into account the importance of the right to \r\ndevelopment to all human rights, the Philippines \r\ncontinues to advocate for, and support discussions on, \r\nthe right to development with a view to ensuring its \r\nrealization, particularly in the Human Rights Council.  \r\n My delegation, sensitive to current and emerging \r\nhuman rights challenges and aware that the effective \r\nrealization of human rights is vital to alleviating \r\npoverty and creating a better quality of life for all, \r\nreaffirms its unwavering commitment to the protection \r\nand promotion of human rights. \r\n Mr. Diallo (Senegal) (spoke in French): I would \r\nlike to commend the remarkable work accomplished by \r\nthe Human Rights Council during the past year and to \r\nexpress my delegation’s appreciation to the Council’s \r\nPresident, Her Excellency Ambassador Laura Dupuy \r\nLasserre, Uruguay’s Permanent Representative in \r\nGeneva, for the quality of her report. The conduct of \r\nthree extraordinary sessions and the significant number \r\nof resolutions and decisions adopted this year reflect \r\nher dynamism and are eloquent proof of the progress \r\nthe Council has made. \r\n In that regard, I should add that we welcome the \r\nfact that almost all Member States have now submitted \r\nto the Universal Periodic Review, which, as the \r\nSecretary-General has said, opens a new chapter in the \r\npromotion of human rights and underscores its \r\nuniversality. The appreciable participation by States in \r\nthis mechanism, only a few months before the end of \r\nits first cycle, shows clearly that it is possible to \r\napproach the issue of human rights impartially and free \r\nof any form of politicization by establishing an \r\nobjective, constructive and transparent dialogue. \r\nHowever, the mechanism’s capacity to make an \r\neffective contribution to promoting and protecting \r\nhuman rights can be gauged only after its \r\nrecommendations are implemented. It is our common \r\nresponsibility to work for the success of this enterprise. \r\n The results the Human Rights Council has \r\nachieved since its founding are testament, if any were \r\nstill needed, that this body is capable of producing \r\nA/66/PV.49  \r\n \r\n11-57707 14 \r\n \r\nresponses adequate to the situations requiring its \r\nattention. However, far from letting us adopt a self-\r\nsatisfied attitude, the progress that has brought about \r\nboth hopes and expectations should rather encourage \r\nus to intensify our efforts to consolidate the Council \r\nand improve its functioning. \r\n That is the direction we should follow in the work \r\nwe undertook with the adoption, last June, of \r\nresolution 65/281 and its annex, which is entitled \r\n“Outcome of the review of the work and functioning of \r\nthe Human Rights Council”. Even though that \r\nresolution was not completely satisfying for many \r\ndelegations, the result we attained — thanks to the \r\nwillingness to compromise and the flexibility \r\nprevailing in our discussions — should be commended.  \r\n In deciding to maintain the Human Rights \r\nCouncil’s status as a subsidiary body of the General \r\nAssembly and to align its annual cycle with the \r\ncalendar year, we in fact contributed to improving the \r\nfunctioning of the Council. In that same spirit, we \r\nrequested a study of means to provide adequate \r\nfunding for unforeseen and extraordinary expenses \r\narising from resolutions and decisions adopted by the \r\nCouncil. Clearly, granting the Human Rights Council \r\nadequate financing would increase its efficacy. \r\n In that same vein, I commend Human Rights \r\nCouncil decision 17/118, of 17 June 2011, which \r\ncreates the Office of the President of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil. That should allow an institutional memory in \r\nthe Council and improve its visibility. We hope that in \r\nthe establishment of that important new entity, the \r\nprinciple of equitable geographic representation will be \r\ntaken into account in the staff selection process. \r\n In the course of our consideration of the draft \r\nbudget for the 2012-2013 biennium in the Fifth \r\nCommittee a few days ago, we commended the \r\nSecretary-General for recommending additional funds \r\nfor institutional strengthening of the human rights \r\nagenda of the Organization. \r\n In the current period of crisis, when doubt and \r\nuncertainty dampen even the most optimistic souls, the \r\nimmeasurable contribution of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil to safeguarding such fundamental values as \r\ntolerance, intercultural dialogue and responsible free \r\nexpression is a source of hope and comfort. In that \r\nlight, the Council should redouble its efforts in \r\npromoting human rights education, which could \r\ncontribute greatly to realizing the goal of ridding the \r\nworld of prejudice and fear of the other.  \r\n Even as it continues in that vein, the Human \r\nRights Council should also focus more on the many \r\nfacets of the right to development. We are convinced \r\nthat respect for all human rights, without distinction, \r\nincluding the right to development, is one of the \r\nprinciple measures of peace and stability at both the \r\nnational and international levels. \r\n In conclusion, I want to encourage all Member \r\nStates to commit to making the second cycle of the \r\nuniversal periodic review a genuine success. \r\n Mr. De Séllos (Brazil): Brazil welcomes the \r\nreport of the Human Rights Council to the General \r\nAssembly (A/66/53 and A/66/53/Add.1). We also thank \r\nthe President of the Council, Ambassador Laura Dupuy \r\nLasserre, for her presentation of the activities of the \r\nCouncil in the past year. The report offers a vivid \r\ndescription of the intense work of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil. The positive outcomes achieved in both \r\nregular and special sessions show that the Council is an \r\nessential mechanism to ensure the promotion and \r\nprotection of all human rights and of fundamental \r\nfreedoms for all. \r\n The fact that most of the outcomes of the \r\nCouncil’s work were adopted by consensus is still more \r\nevidence that, in the human rights agenda, what we \r\nshare still outweighs what divides us. Brazil maintains \r\nthat increased dialogue and mutual understanding are \r\nfundamental to achieving an even greater convergence, \r\nwhich can only lead to a more effective Human Rights \r\nCouncil. \r\n Having recently completed our second mandate \r\nas a member State of the Council, Brazil has constantly \r\nworked with a view to achieving outcomes that are \r\nboth meaningful and acceptable to all. In the reporting \r\nperiod, my Government presented draft resolutions on \r\nthe subjects of the protection of human rights in the \r\ncontext of HIV and AIDS, on the right of everyone to \r\nthe enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of \r\nphysical and mental health in the context of \r\ndevelopment and access to medicines, and on the \r\nincompatibility of democracy and racism, the latter in \r\nconjunction with the members of the Southern \r\nCommon Market and its associated States. All of them \r\nwere adopted without a vote, and usually with \r\nnumerous sponsors. \r\n A/66/PV.49\r\n \r\n15 11-57707 \r\n \r\n We note with appreciation the conclusion of the \r\nfirst cycle of the Universal Periodic Review (UPR). \r\nThe fact that all States Members of the United Nations \r\nhave undergone the review exercise has highlighted the \r\nfact that all of us, independent of our level of \r\ndevelopment, face challenges in ensuring the full \r\nenjoyment of all human rights for our peoples. The \r\nhigh level of cooperation received by the mechanism \r\nmay have exceeded the most optimistic forecasts. \r\n My country has engaged constructively with the \r\nUniversal Periodic Review mechanism, thus \r\ncontributing to its undeniable success. With a view to \r\navoiding selectivity and politicization, Brazil has made \r\nrecommendations to all countries reviewed in the \r\nreporting period. We will also engage constructively in \r\nour own upcoming review, due next May, in the second \r\ncycle of the UPR. \r\n For all those reasons, Brazil’s assessment is that \r\nthe Human Rights Council is overall a success story. At \r\nthe same time, the Council has the potential to become \r\nan even more effective instrument for the promotion \r\nand protection of all human rights. The recently \r\nconcluded review has already made important \r\ncontributions to the work and functioning of the \r\nCouncil, and we believe it is possible to continue that \r\nimprovement during its day-to-day work. \r\n Among the necessary improvements, Brazil \r\nattaches great importance to increasing the Council’s \r\nability to provide cooperation and technical assistance. \r\nWe recall, in that regard, the joint intervention by \r\nBrazil and 97 other countries on the topic of technical \r\nassistance and capacity-building. We must do more in \r\norder to fully realize the mandate of the Council for \r\nfostering cooperation, thus contributing to the \r\npromotion and protection of human rights in the world. \r\n Mr. Mitsialis (Greece): My delegation fully \r\nsubscribes to the statement made earlier by the \r\nobserver of the European Union. Allow me to make \r\nsome additional comments in my national capacity. \r\n In our globalized world, human rights have \r\nbecome a vital factor in the promotion of peace, \r\njustice, security and development. They offer a unique \r\nmeans of protection of individuals against harm. They \r\nconstitute a sine qua non ingredient of international \r\nand domestic political discourse and constitute the \r\ncornerstone for building a fair, peaceful, all-inclusive \r\ncivil society. It is therefore imperative that human \r\nrights be respected by all States Members of the United \r\nNations. \r\n I wish to extend our appreciation to the President \r\nof the Human Rights Council, Ms. Laura Dupuy \r\nLasserre, for presenting the Human Rights Council’s \r\nsixth annual report (A/66/53 and Add.1). The report \r\nunderlines the Member States’ adherence to the \r\nprinciples of cooperation and mutual respect. Among \r\nthe resolutions adopted by the Council, we consider \r\nthose on violence against women, trafficking of women \r\nand children, and the incompatibility between \r\ndemocracy and racism to be the most notable.  \r\n Developments and changes in the countries of \r\nNorth Africa and the Middle East dominated this year’s \r\nsessions of the Human Rights Council. Those \r\ndevelopments produced the constantly pressing need to \r\nguarantee the protection of the fundamental rights and \r\nfreedoms of all the peoples in our neighbouring region. \r\nIn addition, the adverse impact of the greatly prolonged \r\nglobal financial crisis and the food crisis in the Horn of \r\nAfrica have put considerable pressure on us when it \r\ncomes to the protection of the economic, social, civil \r\nand political rights of a great number of people. \r\n Among the positive developments of this year’s \r\nsessions of the Human Rights Council, we noted the \r\nreview of the Council, the consensual adoption of \r\nmany country-specific resolutions and the successful \r\ncompletion of the first cycle of the Universal Periodic \r\nReview (UPR) process with the adoption of all national \r\nreports. We now have before us the first universal \r\nhuman rights map. Special procedures mandates were \r\nextended and new ones were created as the Council \r\nattended to matters not previously covered.  \r\n At the same time, we should aim for better \r\nstreamlining of various Council initiatives, bearing in \r\nmind the limited resources available. As collaboration \r\namong existing mandate holders has become \r\ncommonplace, assigning additional reporting \r\nrequirements could be avoided in order achieve greater \r\neffectiveness.  \r\n In July, we welcomed the Republic of South \r\nSudan as the 193rd State Member of the United \r\nNations and expressed our appreciation for its \r\nimmediate engagement with the Human Rights Council \r\nin order to strengthen national mechanisms for the \r\npromotion and protection of human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms. We expect that serious efforts \r\nwill be undertaken from all sides to prevent further \r\nA/66/PV.49  \r\n \r\n11-57707 16 \r\n \r\nviolence. We are ready to assist the new Government in \r\nthe promotion of human rights. \r\n Greece welcomed the transition in Libya. It \r\nstrongly supports the ongoing process towards \r\ndemocracy and stands ready to offer any assistance in \r\nthat direction.  \r\n Greece eagerly supports the work of the Human \r\nRights Council. Despite the current difficult economic \r\njuncture, my Government spears no efforts in \r\npromoting human rights in all fields of action. In the \r\nfight against racism, xenophobia and related \r\nintolerance, a new law will soon be submitted for \r\nadoption by Parliament that will further criminalize \r\nracist acts. Furthermore, we have strengthened our \r\nlegislative framework in favour of gender equality and \r\ncounselling for victims of gender-based violence, \r\ntrafficking of women and children, and for the \r\nprotection of children’s rights based on the principle of \r\nthe best interests of the child. \r\n We are proud of the steps taken to comply with \r\ninternational standards for the elimination of \r\ntrafficking through the enactment of strict legislation \r\nfor prosecuting perpetrators and protecting victims in \r\naccordance with victim-centred legislation, as well as \r\nto improve prevention through focused activities and \r\nnational coordination. In addition, we are adopting \r\nmeasures to broaden the safeguarding of the rights of \r\npersons with disabilities. Their equal participation in \r\neconomic, social and political life remains at the top of \r\nour agenda. \r\n The European Union perceives human rights as \r\nuniversal, indivisible and interdependent. All of its \r\nmember States share the same core values in terms of \r\nrespect for, and promotion and protection of, human \r\nrights, democracy and the rule of law, not only within \r\nEuropean Union borders but also beyond them. As a \r\nmember of the European Union family and a party to \r\nall major international human rights instruments, \r\nGreece has a long-standing commitment to the \r\nprotection of human rights and fundamental freedoms \r\nand has long been a staunch supporter of all efforts to \r\npromote human rights values and principles at all \r\nlevels and in all countries in the world. We \r\nacknowledge the pivotal role that the United Nations \r\nhas played in strengthening the international \r\ncommunity’s ability to promote respect for all human \r\nrights. Therefore, since its inception, we have fervently \r\nsupported an efficient Human Rights Council. \r\n Greece’s commitment to upholding human rights \r\nis the cornerstone of our candidature for election to the \r\nHuman Rights Council for the upcoming period 2013-\r\n2015. In this respect, we presented our national report \r\nto the Universal Periodic Review mechanism in May \r\nand accepted the vast majority of recommendations \r\nmade by Member States. We thus intend to ensure an \r\neffective follow-up to all UPR recommendations. The \r\noverall positive assessment of Greece’s human rights \r\nrecord under the Universal Periodic Review confirms \r\nour readiness to actively participate in the work of the \r\nCouncil, contribute to the full implementation of its \r\nmandate and enhance its credibility and efficiency \r\nthrough improved cross-regional cooperation and \r\ngreater efforts to achieve wider agreement on its \r\ndecisions. \r\n For its part, the Greek Government has extended \r\nand honoured standing invitations to all the Human \r\nRights Council special procedures. We firmly believe \r\nthat only through objective monitoring and reporting \r\ncan the Council identify the areas in need of capacity-\r\nbuilding and technical assistance, thus further helping \r\ncountries to better address human rights violations, \r\nwherever they occur. \r\n In the context of our candidature for a seat in the \r\nHuman Rights Council, Greece is in the process of \r\nratifying several international human rights instruments \r\nand intends to further promote the engagement of \r\nGreek and international non-governmental \r\norganizations in the Council’s work. In addition, we \r\nintend to take a number of supplementary steps and to \r\ninitiate actions in the fields of migration management \r\nand asylum procedures, given the challenges that arise \r\nfrom the unprecedented flow of irregular migrants \r\nentering Greece as a result of its geographical location. \r\n The full enjoyment of human rights remains the \r\ncornerstone of any democratic edifice and constitutes \r\nthe epitome of the human condition. In the quest for \r\nthis ideal, the Human Rights Council meticulously \r\nfulfils the role assigned to it. Greece, conscious of the \r\nsignificance of its mission, will continue to be actively \r\nengaged in that process. \r\n Mr. Jerandi (Tunisia) (spoke in French): I take \r\nthis opportunity to welcome with great satisfaction the \r\nnew dynamic of cooperation that since the 14 January \r\nrevolution has taken root between the United Nations \r\nhuman rights machinery and Tunisia. Tunisia is more \r\ncommitted than ever to abiding by its international \r\n A/66/PV.49\r\n \r\n17 11-57707 \r\n \r\ncommitments in the field of human rights and to \r\nensuring that human rights become universal values in \r\nall dimensions and that they become a tangible reality \r\nin the daily life of Tunisia. \r\n This new dynamic of cooperation is illustrated by \r\nTunisia’s ratification, last June, of four international \r\nhuman rights instruments that are of great significance, \r\nnamely, the Rome Statute, the Optional Protocol to the \r\nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, \r\nthe Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, \r\nInhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and \r\nthe International Convention for the Protection of All \r\nPersons from Enforced Disappearance. These \r\ncommitments reflect my country’s strong resolve to put \r\nin place a comprehensive human rights mechanism that \r\nwill break once and for all with the past and establish \r\nsolid assurances against flagrant violations of human \r\nrights.  \r\n Furthermore, Tunisia has withdrawn its \r\nreservations to the Convention on the Elimination of \r\nAll Forms of Discrimination against Women, so as to \r\nestablish the rightful place of women in Tunisian \r\nsociety and further reinforce gender equality.  \r\n In the same spirit, following its open invitation to \r\nall special procedures of the Human Rights Council, \r\nTunisia welcomed the Special Rapporteur on the \r\npromotion and protection of human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms while countering terrorism and \r\nthe Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, \r\ninhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, who \r\nvisited Tunisian prisons and detention centres and \r\nmade observations and recommendations.  \r\n Many international entities and organizations \r\nworking on human rights issues have opened offices in \r\nTunis. I would cite the particular example of the new \r\ncountry office of the Office of the High Commissioner \r\nfor Human Rights, which was opened in July by the \r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, \r\nMs. Navanethem Pillay, and which confirms our \r\ncollective will to promote cooperation as a means of \r\ntruly recognizing human rights.  \r\n My country also worked to reactivate the national \r\ncommittee to follow up on the recommendations made \r\nby the various human rights treaty bodies and special \r\nrapporteurs and organizations active in the field of \r\nhuman rights. It also set up a committee to harmonize \r\nits national legislation with international human rights \r\ninstruments. \r\n That new momentum towards productive \r\ncooperation with the Human Rights Council was also \r\nrecognized with the Council’s adoption, on 24 March, \r\nof resolution 16/19 on cooperation between Tunisia \r\nand the Office of the High Commissioner for Human \r\nRights, which demonstrated the firm commitment of \r\nthe international community to supporting my \r\ncountry’s efforts to promote human rights, in particular \r\nby mobilizing the resources needed to tackle its \r\neconomic and social challenges.  \r\n On 23 October, Tunisia took a giant step forward \r\nin its transition to democracy by holding free, \r\ndemocratic and transparent elections for the first time \r\nin its history. Tunisians, hungry for democracy and \r\nfreedom, affirmed their commitment to civic duty with \r\na massive turnout at the polls to exercise their right to \r\nchoose their representatives in the National Constituent \r\nAssembly, many of them for the first time in their \r\nlives. More than 90 per cent of registered voters turned \r\nout to vote. In that connection, we reiterate our deep \r\ngratitude to the United Nations and all international \r\nobservers for their commendable efforts to ensure a \r\nsmooth and successful electoral process. \r\n We take this opportunity to reaffirm our major \r\ncommitment to securing the gains already made so that \r\nthe Tunisian people can enjoy a better future, thereby \r\nresponding to their deepest aspirations for a \r\ndemocratic, fair, free, united and developed system of \r\nGovernment.  \r\n Aware of the importance of the support provided \r\nby the United Nations human rights machinery for \r\nefforts to promote human rights, Tunisia is preparing \r\nits second national report, which is to be submitted \r\nnext June as part of the second cycle of the Universal \r\nPeriodic Review. The report will give us an \r\nopportunity to highlight not only our national efforts, \r\nin particular those made to implement all of the \r\nrecommendations stemming from the first cycle of the \r\nReview, but also the related challenges that remain. \r\nThe second cycle will certainly help to promote the \r\nrole of that innovative mechanism and thereby ensure \r\nthat it will play a more active role in helping countries \r\nsuch as mine that wish to build their capacities to \r\npromote and protect human rights.  \r\n In conclusion, we reiterate our determination to \r\ntake further steps to ensure our full and stable \r\ncooperation with the Human Rights Council. In that \r\nway, Tunisia will succeed in its transition to democracy \r\nA/66/PV.49  \r\n \r\n11-57707 18 \r\n \r\nand be better able to promote the culture of human \r\nrights in its broadest form around the world.  \r\n Mr. Abdelaziz (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I would like to express Egypt’s appreciation for \r\nthe detailed statement delivered by the President of the \r\nHuman Rights Council to the General Assembly on the \r\nwork of the Council, following her valuable statement \r\nto the Third Committee on the report of the Council \r\n(A/66/53 and A/66/53/Add.1), which was submitted in \r\naccordance with General Assembly resolution 65/281 \r\non the review of the Human Rights Council.  \r\n Since its establishment by the General Assembly \r\nin its resolution 60/251, the Human Rights Council has \r\ncontinuously improved its performance by harmonizing \r\nits working methods and standards and adopting a \r\nconstructive and cooperative approach to dealing with \r\nhuman rights issues, with a view to providing advice \r\nand the necessary support. As a subsidiary body of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, the Council plays an important role \r\nin promoting human rights through international \r\ncooperation, as established by the World Summit \r\nOutcome Document of 2005 (resolution 60/1), and \r\ncontributes to activities aimed at promoting universal \r\nrespect for human rights. Those mechanisms should be \r\nactivated in all Member States without exception, \r\ndouble standards, politicization or selectivity, and in an \r\nobjective and fair, equal and impartial manner. \r\n The international community is making \r\ncontinuous efforts to promote and protect human \r\nrights, as well as to address the various challenges and \r\nmake concerted efforts to overcome them. In particular, \r\nwe must restore cooperation in the international \r\ninterest in and attention to economic, social and \r\ncultural rights, on the one hand, and civil and political \r\nrights, on the other hand. That can be done by bridging \r\nthe gap between the North and the South with a view to \r\nimproving living standards, which in turn would help \r\nto advance the cause of human rights.  \r\n We should also strengthen our efforts to combat \r\nall forms of discrimination on the basis of race, sex, \r\nlanguage or religion, including through the \r\nimplementation of our joint commitments, in \r\naccordance with the Durban Declaration, its \r\nprogramme of action and the outcome document of its \r\nreview conference, as well as the political declaration \r\n(resolution 66/3) adopted by consensus during the \r\nHigh-level Meeting of the General Assembly to \r\ncommemorate the tenth anniversary of the adoption of \r\nthe Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, held \r\nlast September. \r\n In addition, we have an obligation to support and \r\nrespect the institutional balance between the roles of \r\nthe principal organs of the United Nations in \r\naddressing human rights issues, while paying special \r\nattention to the economic, social and cultural aspects \r\ninvolved. In doing so, we should stand up to those who \r\nattempt to impose their values and views and the \r\nstandards of their justice, social, legal and human \r\nrights systems on others, and to force certain \r\ncontroversial notions that ignore the diverse social, \r\ncultural and legislative systems of the world. \r\n In that regard, it is important to respect the \r\nmandate of the Human Rights Council and to refrain \r\nfrom submitting country-specific recommendations to \r\nthe Third Committee, particularly since those decisions \r\ntarget only developing countries and hinder our efforts \r\nto reach consensus-based cooperative solutions, which \r\ncan help to build respect for human rights around the \r\nworld. \r\n We should therefore reiterate the importance of \r\nnot politicizing the Council and the significance of its \r\ncentral role in ensuring respect for all human rights and \r\ninternational humanitarian law, in particular in the \r\noccupied Palestinian territories, by verifying Israel’s \r\nfull compliance with all its international obligations, \r\nincluding its commitment to cooperate fully with the \r\nSpecial Rapporteur and the fact-finding missions \r\nmandated by the Human Rights Council to investigate \r\ngross human rights violations in the occupied \r\nPalestinian territories. \r\n Furthermore, we must enhance dialogue and \r\npromote constructive cooperation to ensure the \r\neffectiveness of the special procedures system. It is a \r\nshared responsibility of the mandate holders, the States \r\nand all other relevant parties, which should be based on \r\nthe principles of transparency, fairness and mutual \r\ncooperation, while ensuring full respect by the special \r\nprocedures of their mandates and responsibilities as \r\nestablished by the Human Rights Council. \r\n Finally, Egypt reiterates the importance of \r\nidentifying the financial resources needed to support \r\nthe activities of the Office of the High Commissioner \r\nfor Human Rights so as to enable it to follow up on all \r\nCouncil resolutions and provide the necessary \r\nassistance to Member States in the area of capacity-\r\nbuilding. Those resources should be drawn from the \r\n A/66/PV.49\r\n \r\n19 11-57707 \r\n \r\nregular budget and conditional external funding should \r\nbe avoided. Assured, accountable and transparent \r\nfunding from the regular budget will secure the \r\nOffice’s role in the work of the Council. \r\n Egypt is currently witnessing a major and \r\npositive transition in its history, based on an \r\nunwavering commitment to the principles of \r\ndemocracy, transparency and accountability and \r\nrespect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms. \r\nIn that regard, Egypt reiterates the important role of the \r\nHuman Rights Council, based on our conviction that \r\nhuman dignity, dialogue, cooperation and mutual \r\nunderstanding guaranteed by human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms are the essential cornerstone to \r\nensure respect for those rights. \r\n Egypt will seek to consolidate and promote the \r\nrole of the Council, on the principles of accountability \r\nand transparency, believing that human dignity is the \r\nmain aim of all our efforts to guarantee respect for \r\nhuman rights. \r\n Mr. Chuquihuara (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): My \r\ndelegation would like to thank the President of the \r\nHuman Rights Council, Ms. Laura Dupuy Lasserre, for \r\nher presentation of the Council reports (A/66/53 and \r\nA/66/53/Add.1) to the General Assembly. Peru notes \r\nthat the work of that important United Nations body \r\nprovides essential elements for the promotion and \r\nprotection of human rights.  \r\n The Human Rights Council is the body \r\nresponsible for promoting universal respect for and \r\nprotection of all human rights and fundamental \r\nfreedoms for everyone without distinction and in a just \r\nand equitable manner. That is a fundamental task, \r\nabsolutely requiring the support of all States, given that \r\nhuman beings are the central focus of our \r\nOrganization. \r\n In that regard, we are pleased to see that the \r\nCouncil’s resolutions and decisions consistently seek to \r\npromote greater understanding of and enjoyment of \r\nhuman rights. Examples are the United Nations \r\nDeclaration on Human Rights Education and Training, \r\nthe Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights \r\nof the Child on a communications procedure and the \r\nCouncil’s commitment to further developing human \r\nrights through its study on climate change and human \r\nrights. The Council also seeks to take proactive action \r\non urgent situations that threaten human rights in \r\nvarious parts of the world. \r\n Peru is a new member of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, and as such it takes on the great responsibility \r\nof promoting and protecting the human rights of all the \r\nplanet’s citizens without distinction. As a member — \r\nand in line with its historic commitment to human \r\nrights both nationally and internationally — Peru will \r\ncontinue to work to make the Council effectively fulfil \r\nits mandate to vigilantly engage in all instances of \r\nhuman rights violations, no matter where, in keeping \r\nwith the principles of universality, indivisibility, \r\nimpartiality, objectivity and non-discrimination. \r\n Peru has worked with Human Rights Council \r\nspecial procedures mandate holders and working \r\ngroups. It has hosted visits from the Working Group on \r\narbitrary detention, the Working Group on enforced or \r\ninvoluntary disappearances, the Special Rapporteur on \r\nadequate housing, the Special Rapporteur on the right \r\nto health, the Working Group on the use of \r\nmercenaries, the Special Rapporteur on the human \r\nrights of migrants, the Special Rapporteur on the rights \r\nof indigenous peoples, the Special Rapporteur on the \r\npromotion and protection of human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms while countering terrorism and, \r\nmost recently, the Special Rapporteur on contemporary \r\nforms of slavery. \r\n Peru will continue along those same lines in \r\nsupporting initiatives to strengthen the special \r\nprocedures system and the Universal Periodic Review. \r\nMy country believes that in order to fulfil the Council’s \r\nmandate it must closely cooperate with regional \r\norganizations, national human rights institutions and \r\ncivil society. To do that, Peru will promote and support \r\ninitiatives to increase those actors’ participation. \r\nTechnical assistance and capacity-building are also key \r\nelements of the Council’s mandate. In that regard, as \r\nwe have reiterated many times, Peru will support \r\nefforts to effectively respond to States’ requests for \r\ntechnical assistance. \r\n At its eighteenth session, the Human Rights \r\nCouncil adopted by consensus resolution 18/7 on truth, \r\njustice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence, \r\nwhich Peru presented along with other delegations,. \r\nThe resolution established a Special Rapporteur with \r\nthe mandate of addressing and promoting the rights to \r\ntruth, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence. \r\nPeru was one of the leading sponsors of that initiative \r\nbecause it is our deep conviction that, faced with \r\nviolence and flagrant violations of human rights, \r\nbuilding a society that is more just, unified, peaceful \r\nA/66/PV.49  \r\n \r\n11-57707 20 \r\n \r\nand prosperous requires a quest for truth. Truth can \r\nexplain the causes of violence, so as to prevent it, \r\nidentify and bring to justice those responsible for it and \r\noffer reparations to victims and their families, restoring \r\ntheir dignity. \r\n Peru participated actively both in Geneva and \r\nNew York in the Human Rights Council review \r\nprocess. The Council, under the presidency of \r\nMs. Dupuy, will enter a critical phase in which it will \r\nimplement the findings of the review of its work and \r\nfunctioning. That will be an opportunity to strengthen \r\nthe Council’s mechanisms, so as to respond effectively \r\nto victims’ needs and to prevent human rights \r\nviolations from occurring. We hope that the Council \r\ncan count on funding sufficient for it to fulfil its \r\nfunctions, including needs arising in unforeseen or \r\nextraordinary circumstances resulting in urgent \r\nresolutions or decisions on the part of the Council. \r\n In line with its deep commitment to the \r\nuniversality, indivisibility and interdependence of \r\nhuman rights, Peru will continue to support any \r\ninitiative that aims to strengthen the work and \r\nfunctioning of the Human Rights Council and its \r\nimportant task of defending the human rights of all \r\npeople, without distinction. Respecting and promoting \r\nhuman rights can no longer be just an ideal. We must \r\nuse the mechanisms we have and our experience to \r\nmake the ideal a reality. \r\n Mr. Kodama (Japan): I thank the President of the \r\nHuman Rights Council. Ms. Laura Dupuy Lasserre, \r\nPermanent Representative of Uruguay in Geneva, for \r\nthe presentation of her reports (A/66/53 and \r\nA/66/53/Add.1) today, both to the Third Committee \r\nand the General Assembly, and for her dedicated work \r\nin the Council. \r\n The international community has been faced with \r\nnew challenges to strengthen the human rights \r\nmachinery and responsibly address ongoing human \r\nrights violations around the world. To that effect, the \r\nHuman Rights Council has an increasingly important \r\nrole to play in the international community. Since its \r\nestablishment, the Council has steadily accumulated \r\nachievements. \r\n First, the Universal Periodic Review was created \r\nas a new mechanism to improve the human rights \r\nsituations in all Member States through their voluntary \r\nfollow-up actions. Secondly, the special procedures \r\ncomplement the Universal Periodic Review in \r\naddressing serious human rights violations around the \r\nworld. Japan places a high value on the role of the \r\nspecial procedures and has extended an official \r\nstanding invitation to all thematic mandate holders. \r\nThirdly, the Council has convened special sessions in \r\nresponse to serious human rights violations and has \r\ntaken appropriate actions, including the urgent dispatch \r\nof an international commission of inquiry and the \r\nstrong messages sent to the international community \r\nthrough resolutions. \r\n Japan has been a member of the Council from its \r\nestablishment in 2006 until this year and is now \r\nstanding as a candidate in the 2012 election. In Geneva \r\nand New York, Japan has engaged in efforts to \r\nstrengthen the work and functioning of the Council and \r\nparticipated actively in the negotiations of the Human \r\nRights Council review this year.  \r\n As all Member States know, those negotiations \r\nwere extremely difficult. The co-facilitators and all \r\nStates made efforts to reach an agreement. As a result, \r\nan outcome was reached that contained a few \r\nimprovements to the Council, although not all we had \r\nhoped for. We agreed on an improved and more \r\npractical way to align the Council’s work with its \r\nmembership and reporting cycle. With regard to the \r\nfinancial issue, the outcome requested the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to present a report with options for the Fifth \r\nCommittee to consider, including ways to implement \r\nurgent mandates as decided by the Council. \r\n On the other hand, we also sought concrete and \r\npractical measures, including the improvement of the \r\nelection process in order to ensure the active \r\nparticipation of the membership, with the aim of \r\nstrengthening the implementation of resolution 60/251. \r\nUnfortunately, we were unable to agree on such an \r\noutcome. \r\n We would like to stress that the Council was \r\nestablished to mainstream human rights, that is, to \r\nintegrate a human rights perspective into all United \r\nNations activities. We should further strengthen the \r\nfunctioning of the United Nations as a whole, \r\nrecognizing that the role of the Third Committee of the \r\nGeneral Assembly as a universal body that includes all \r\nMember States is also important. We expect both the \r\nThird Committee and the Council to fulfil their roles, \r\nmaking full use of their respective advantages. \r\n In the future, the Council should fulfil the \r\nexpectations of the international community by \r\n A/66/PV.49\r\n \r\n21 11-57707 \r\n \r\naccruing further concrete achievements and by \r\nstrengthening its functions through a continuous \r\nreview of its own work. We hope that the General \r\nAssembly will also review the Council’s work in the \r\nnear future through an agreement of the Member States \r\nin order to advance the mainstreaming of human rights \r\nthroughout the United Nations system. \r\n Mr. Ulibarri (Costa Rica) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nCosta Rica welcomes the report on the work of the \r\nHuman Rights Council (A/66/53 and Add.1). We are \r\nespecially pleased that the Ambassador of Uruguay, \r\nLaura Dupuy Lasserre, presented it to this body in her \r\ncapacity as President of the Council. That is a step in \r\nthe right direction to give the importance it deserves to \r\nthat central body of the Organization on the question of \r\nhuman rights. \r\n According to the agreements reflected in \r\nresolution 65/281, on the review of the Council, review \r\nor consideration of the report as such should be \r\nconducted in this plenary meeting, while the Third \r\nCommittee is responsible for reviewing its \r\nrecommendations. \r\n As we indicated when we explained our position \r\nat the adoption of that resolution (see A/65/PV.100), \r\nthe final outcome of the review process did not reflect \r\nall our hopes, but it was the result of lengthy \r\nnegotiations and came as close as possible to \r\nconsensus, with a positive outlook. In that regard, it is \r\ncrucial for all countries to honour the commitments \r\nthat we made in good-faith negotiations, and that we \r\nact accordingly.  \r\n We would also have preferred that the report be \r\npresented first in the Assembly plenary so that it could \r\nbe considered in its entirety and then to the Third \r\nCommittee as the basis for the examination of specific \r\nrecommendations, as was indicated in the letter and the \r\nlogic of the resolution approved. Equally, we consider \r\nit indispensable not to schedule meetings of the Third \r\nCommittee when the report of the Council is being \r\nconsidered in the Assembly.  \r\n We invite Member States, future presidencies and \r\nthe Secretariat to consider these important points with \r\na view to improving future decisions on this matter.  \r\n My country is strongly committed to the \r\npromotion and protection of human rights and to the \r\nwork of the Council. The eighteenth session, which \r\ntook place from 12 to 30 September and on 21 October \r\n2011, was the first regular session in which Costa Rica \r\nparticipated as a new member State. As proof of our \r\ncommitment, our delegation was led at the highest \r\nlevel, by the President of the Republic, who pledged to \r\ntake on our new work responsibly, seeking to build \r\nbridges between opposing positions and to contribute \r\nso that decisions and resolutions adopted by the \r\nCouncil are fully implemented, especially on the \r\nground.  \r\n Through our participation, and in every one of the \r\nactions taken as a member of the Council, we have \r\ncontinuously sought to act in accord with the principles \r\nof universality, impartiality, objectivity, non-selectivity, \r\nnon-politicization, constructive international dialogue and \r\ncooperation, following the commitments we made to \r\nthe membership in our promises and pledges at the \r\ntime of our candidacy.  \r\n Among the important achievements of the most \r\nrecent Council session, we would like to call attention \r\nto the creation of the mandate of the Special \r\nRapporteur on the promotion of truth, justice, \r\nreparation and guarantees on non-recurrence \r\n(resolution 18/7) and the adoption of resolution 18/22 \r\non human rights and climate change. With respect to \r\nthe protection and promotion of human rights and the \r\nprotection of the environment, we believe that a \r\ncomprehensive approach should be adopted in order to \r\nanalyse all the effects of environmental deterioration \r\non the full exercise of human rights and to respond to \r\nthem effectively. We should consider establishing a \r\nspecial procedure on human rights and the \r\nenvironment. \r\n During that session, we continued the \r\nconstructive cooperation with a number of countries, as \r\nwe had done when we were observers. Along with \r\n62 other States, we renewed our open invitation to the \r\nspecial procedures, promoting the universality of an \r\ninitiative already backed by 88 countries. We \r\nrespectfully invite those countries that have not already \r\ndone so to extend and honour that open invitation, \r\nespecially if they hope to hold a seat on the Council.  \r\n Along with Belgium, Italy and Slovenia, we \r\nintroduced decision 18/117, adopted by consensus, \r\nrequesting the Secretary-General to continue to prepare \r\nan annual report on the application of the death penalty \r\nin the world. In that proposal, we stressed the \r\nimportance of consultation with Governments and \r\nother relevant stakeholders, and we sought an approach \r\nA/66/PV.49  \r\n \r\n11-57707 22 \r\n \r\nbased on the protection of the rights of those who face \r\nthe death penalty.  \r\n Similarly, through parallel events, together with \r\nthe Permanent Mission of Spain and other entities, we \r\npromoted the human right to peace. We are continuing \r\nto promote human rights education and training, along \r\nwith Slovenia, the Philippines, Italy, Morocco, Senegal \r\nand Switzerland.  \r\n With respect to the report in A/66/53, we would \r\nlike to highlight the recommendations brought before \r\nthe Assembly at this session to adopt the United \r\nNations Declaration on Human Rights Education and \r\nTraining (resolution 16/1) and the Optional Protocol to \r\nthe Convention on the Rights of the Child on a \r\ncommunications procedure (resolution 17/18). These \r\nare fundamental advances in the issue of human rights \r\nand are the fruit of years of open and inclusive \r\nnegotiations. Just as we did on the occasion of the \r\noutcome of the Geneva meeting of the review process \r\nof the Human Rights Council, we wish to reiterate our \r\ncall to uphold the results of that body’s work, and we \r\nrequest States to adopt these resolutions by consensus. \r\n Finally, we believe that we have a responsibility \r\nto continue improving this Organization’s system for \r\nthe promotion and protection of human rights. The \r\nOffice of the High Commissioner for Human Rights \r\nrequires independence and funding. Sufficient funding \r\nmust be made readily available so as to meet the \r\nunexpected needs of the Council. That requires that \r\nStates respond positively in our upcoming \r\ndeliberations. It is also essential that we respect the \r\nindependence of special rapporteurs, ensure the \r\nresources for their proper functioning, and maintain the \r\nintegrity of their mandates.  \r\n There are many other improvements that do not \r\nneed new decisions or policy changes, but just the \r\npolitical will of States. We therefore urge all members \r\nto think creatively and to promote changes in the \r\nCouncil’s day-to-day practice, while taking closely into \r\naccount the contributions of civil society organizations, \r\nand citizens in general, in that undertaking. \r\n Mr. Guerber (Switzerland) (spoke in French): I \r\nwould like to thank the President of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil for her presentation of the annual report of the \r\nCouncil (A/66/53 and Add.1). I also thank her \r\npredecessor. \r\n Switzerland welcomes the fact that human rights \r\nhave become more visible in the United Nations \r\nsystem. The presentation of the Council’s annual report \r\nin that context is an example. However, my country \r\nregrets that the review of the functioning of the \r\nCouncil did not ultimately lead to our exchange today \r\ntaking the form of an interactive dialogue. \r\n Switzerland views the Council’s work positively. \r\nOver the past year, the Council was able to respond to \r\nthe many expectations associated with its \r\nestablishment. Thanks to the special sessions, the \r\ndispatch of fact-finding missions and the creation of \r\nnew mandates, the Council has been able to respond in \r\nan appropriate and timely manner to emergencies and \r\nthe latest developments. \r\n In recent months, the dynamic within the Council \r\nhas developed in a promising way in response to \r\ndemocratic movements and the general surge in \r\npopular support. The nature of those changes \r\nunderlines the importance that States should accord to \r\nthe search for comprehensive solutions in a spirit of \r\ncooperation, inclusion and genuine transregional \r\ndialogue. To that end, efforts to overcome current \r\ndivisions among regional groups must continue. \r\n As a member of the Human Rights Council, \r\nSwitzerland is actively committed to strengthening the \r\nCouncil’s actions on several themes. I will give just \r\nthree examples.  \r\n Switzerland is pleased with the discussions \r\nduring the panel on promotion and protection of human \r\nrights in the context of peaceful protests, at the \r\nCouncil’s eighteenth session, in September. Its goal \r\nwas to draw the Council’s attention to a phenomenon \r\nthat is becoming increasingly widespread. \r\n Switzerland is also one of the main authors \r\nbehind the establishment of a new mandate for a \r\nspecial rapporteur on promotion of truth, justice, \r\nreparations and guarantees of non-recurrence. That \r\nmandate will certainly reinforce the fight against \r\nimpunity. \r\n Thirdly, Switzerland is happy to have actively \r\nparticipated in the transregional Platform for Human \r\nRights Education and Training. The members of that \r\ntransregional Platform will propose to the Third \r\nCommittee, during the current session, the adoption of \r\na United Nations declaration on that issue, along the \r\n A/66/PV.49\r\n \r\n23 11-57707 \r\n \r\nlines of that adopted by the Human Rights Council in \r\nMarch (A/HRC/RES/16/1, annex). \r\n Switzerland sees two main challenges to address \r\nin order for the Council to continue to work for the \r\nrealization of all human rights for all and to respond \r\neffectively to serious human rights violations wherever \r\nthey may be committed. \r\n First, my delegation is thinking of the Universal \r\nPeriodic Review and some special procedures. Those \r\nmechanisms have the potential to contribute, in a \r\nconcrete manner, to improving the human rights \r\nsituation on the ground. The implementation of their \r\nrecommendations is seen as the most important aspect \r\nof the Council’s work. With the end of the first cycle of \r\nthe universal periodic review, the follow-up given to \r\nthe agreed recommendations will be the key issue of \r\nthe Council’s first decade. \r\n Secondly, Switzerland welcomes with satisfaction \r\nthe Secretary-General’s plan to increase the budget \r\nearmarked for activities linked to human rights and the \r\nHuman Rights Council, which today amounts only to \r\nsome 3 per cent of the United Nations regular budget. \r\nSwitzerland also calls for lasting solutions to be found \r\nto the financing and implementation of measures \r\ndecided by the Council, in particular with regard to \r\nurgent measures. A mechanism similar to the \r\nSecretary-General’s unforeseen and extraordinary \r\nexpenses should be established in the field of human \r\nrights. \r\n Finally, Switzerland expresses its appreciation for \r\nthe work of the Office of the High Commissioner for \r\nHuman Rights in support of the Council and of its \r\nmechanisms and for its technical assistance. That work \r\nmust continue within the context of the autonomy \r\ngranted to the High Commissioner under resolution \r\n48/141, which created his mandate. \r\n Mr. Tinajero (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): At the \r\noutset, I would like to welcome the President of the \r\nHuman Rights Council and thank her for presenting to \r\nthe General Assembly the report of the Council \r\n(A/66/53 and Add.1). The delegation of Mexico also \r\nwishes to acknowledge her work and to once again \r\nassure her of our full support in that regard. \r\n In 2005, the international community recognized \r\nthat it was necessary to raise the level of treatment of \r\nhuman rights in our Organization by setting up a new \r\nbody to strengthen the work of the United Nations in \r\ntheir promotion and protection in the world. Since \r\nthen, the Human Rights Council has made progress in \r\ndischarging its important mandate and is developing \r\nnew tools in order to have a genuine and more rapid \r\nimpact on the lives of millions of people.  \r\n Last year, the review of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil began with general agreements on the scope of \r\nthat exercise, emphasizing that only five years had \r\nelapsed since the Council’s establishment and that it \r\nwas very early for a comprehensive assessment of its \r\nfunctioning. Some themes — such as the Council’s \r\ncapacity to review national cases, the special \r\nprocedures work, the topics into which the agenda is \r\ndivided, the structure of the Council and the election of \r\nits members — took up much of the time available for \r\nthe review and, in some cases, affected the work \r\nculture, which is key to the Council being able to \r\nproperly further its work. \r\n Above all, time and political will were lacking to \r\nthoroughly study the changes introduced in 2006 and to \r\ncomplete outstanding tasks, including the Council’s \r\nrelation with other bodies of the system and the powers \r\nof the President and the High Commissioner. Also \r\npending is the proposal that the Council become a \r\nprincipal organ of the Organization, which Mexico \r\ncontinues to support. \r\n Notwithstanding, we can affirm that the outcome \r\nof the review is positive. In particular, it confirmed the \r\nprior understanding that the institution-building \r\npackage continues to reflect the basic balances and \r\ntherefore remains the basis for moving ahead in \r\nstrengthening the institutional framework for the \r\npromotion and protection of all human rights for all \r\npeople in all regions and situations. \r\n It should be pointed out that at the same time that \r\nwe were conducting the review exercise, the Council \r\nwas making full use of all available tools to make \r\ndecisions on a broad spectrum of issues, such as the \r\nprotection of the rights of women and of children, \r\nfreedom of association and the right to truth and \r\njustice, to mention only a few. Moreover, the Council \r\nconsidered pressing situations in Côte d’Ivoire, Syria \r\nand Libya. In the latter case, it recommended that the \r\nGeneral Assembly suspend its membership rights. The \r\nspecial sessions and their outcomes are an example of \r\nthe effective decisions taken five years ago, at the \r\ncreation of the Council and its institutional structure.  \r\nA/66/PV.49  \r\n \r\n11-57707 24 \r\n \r\n Mexico is aware that the Council’s work can be \r\nimproved and that there is ample space to improve the \r\nway it deals with national situations, the functioning of \r\nand cooperation with the special procedures and the \r\nuse of the few resources available. \r\n We also know that successes bring new \r\nchallenges. The clearest example is the universal \r\nperiodic review, which requires increased support and \r\ntechnical cooperation so that during the second cycle \r\nStates can implement the commitments made in the \r\nfirst cycle. The increase in signatories and ratifications \r\nof human rights treaties, which is due in some part to \r\nthat exercise, also demands greater resources. More has \r\nto be done, and with greater efficiency. To us it seems \r\nurgent that we address with greater determination the \r\ncoherence of the United Nations system for the \r\npromotion and enjoyment of all human rights.  \r\n The Human Rights Council must continue to play \r\nits central role as the specialized political body for \r\ndeveloping new standards for the protection of human \r\nrights, international monitoring mechanisms and spaces \r\nwhere civil society and national human rights \r\ninstitutions can participate. The Council must also \r\nexamine the way it interacts with other United Nations \r\nbodies, organs and entities to ensure that the human \r\nrights perspective is integrated into each and all of the \r\nactivities of the United Nations.  \r\n In that context, complementarity between the \r\nHuman Rights Council and the General Assembly is \r\nessential, as is the active participation and commitment \r\nof the High Commissioner. Coherence requires \r\navoiding unnecessary duplication or voids and making \r\nuse of the areas in which responsibilities can be \r\ndistributed appropriately.  \r\n While we all recognize the importance of \r\navoiding duplication of efforts and resources, \r\ndelegations can find it difficult to take concrete steps \r\nwith regard to their own initiatives. Mexico has carried \r\nout an internal evaluation exercise that prioritized the \r\nsubstantive and differentiated treatment of issues in \r\naccordance with the competencies of each relevant \r\nbody. We are also staggering the presentations of some \r\nof our initiatives without that affecting the \r\ndevelopment of the issues. \r\n Lastly, allow me to stress the importance of the \r\nGeneral Assembly’s firm support of the work of the \r\nHuman Rights Council, backing its recommendations, \r\nhelping to strengthen that important pillar of \r\nmultilateral action and making use of its broad \r\nattributes. The work of the Third Committee in \r\nsupporting the Council is indispensable. \r\n Mr. McLay (New Zealand): New Zealand thanks \r\nthe President of the Human Rights Council, \r\nAmbassador Dupuy Lasserre of Uruguay, for \r\npresenting the Council’s sixth annual report (A/66/53 \r\nand Add.1). We also thank her predecessor, \r\nAmbassador Phuangketkeow of Thailand, for his \r\nexcellent work. New Zealand remains a committed \r\nsupporter of the Human Rights Council as the principal \r\nhuman rights body of the United Nations.  \r\n This year there has been no shortage of serious \r\nhuman rights challenges, including in the context of the \r\nArab Spring. Since the special session on Libya in \r\nFebruary, the Council has exhibited an increased \r\nwillingness to act decisively when faced with serious \r\nhuman rights violations. Its actions on Libya, Côte \r\nd’Ivoire and Syria, the debates on other situations, and \r\nthe appointment of a new Special Rapporteur on Iran \r\nall exemplify this positive progress.  \r\n The Council will be judged by its willingness to \r\nengage on human rights violations. This year has seen \r\nit fulfilling its mandate in a constructive and cross-\r\nregional manner. \r\n The ability to work cross-regionally has also been \r\nevident in many of the Council’s thematic initiatives. \r\nIn the Council’s March session, New Zealand and \r\nMexico again presented a resolution on the rights of \r\npersons with disabilities, a resolution which built on \r\nwork of the Office of the High Commissioner for \r\nHuman Rights (OHCHR) and looked at how States \r\nmight best fulfil their obligations under the Convention \r\non the Rights of Persons with Disabilities with regard \r\nto international cooperation and assistance. And in the \r\nSeptember session, we worked again with Colombia \r\nand Burkina Faso to present a resolution inviting \r\nOHCHR to convene an expert working group to enable \r\na human rights approach to reducing unacceptably high \r\nglobal rates of maternal mortality. \r\n In our cross-regional work on disability and on \r\nmaternal mortality, and in many other areas of the \r\nCouncil’s work, we have, as always, been impressed by \r\nthe contribution by civil society and national human \r\nrights institutions. Civil society plays an active role in \r\nthe Council’s work, and in New Zealand’s view, that \r\nassists in the achievement of better outcomes. So we \r\n A/66/PV.49\r\n \r\n25 11-57707 \r\n \r\npay tribute to our colleagues in civil society for helping \r\nthe Council fulfil its mandate. \r\n That mandate also includes promoting effective \r\ncoordination and mainstreaming human rights within \r\nthe United Nations system. Just as civil society has \r\nhelped our work in the Council, New Zealand believes \r\nthe involvement of other branches of the United \r\nNations system has made a positive difference. \r\n Having just completed the last round of the first \r\ncycle of the universal periodic review (UPR), it is also \r\ntimely to reflect on that aspect of the Council’s work. \r\nNew Zealand regards the UPR as a valuable addition to \r\nthe United Nations human rights machinery. \r\n At the 42nd meeting of the Pacific Islands Forum, \r\nheld in Auckland, New Zealand in September, Pacific \r\nleaders acknowledged as a major regional achievement \r\nthe successful participation of all Forum members in \r\nthat round. Crucial support was provided to them by \r\nthe Forum Secretariat, the Regional Rights Resource \r\nTeam of the Secretariat of the Pacific Community, and \r\nOHCHR. The resulting networks are now an important \r\nregional source of human rights expertise. \r\n We also regard the Council’s special procedures \r\nas a vital tool for promoting and protecting human \r\nrights. Globally, these are, as many have said, the \r\nCouncil’s eyes and ears. Last year, New Zealand \r\nwelcomed a visit by the Special Rapporteur on the \r\nsituation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of \r\nindigenous people, Professor James Anaya, and \r\nappreciated his identification of the progress we had \r\nmade, as well as the problems still to be addressed. The \r\nGovernment is acting on many of his recommendations \r\nand will continue to draw on his report. \r\n This time last year, we were in the midst of \r\nreviewing the work and functioning of the Council, and \r\nNew Zealand had hoped that would present \r\nopportunities to improve the Council’s effectiveness. \r\nWhile any resulting improvements were modest, we \r\nbelieve the success of the Council lies not just in the \r\nrules that govern it, but also in the manner in which \r\nthose rules are implemented. \r\n The Council’s mandate is to promote and protect \r\nhuman rights. Fulfilling that mandate requires both the \r\npolitical will and the courage to act decisively and \r\nconsistently. \r\n As the President pointed out in his opening \r\nstatement, human rights are one of the three pillars on \r\nwhich the United Nations was founded. As we move \r\ninto the Council’s seventh year, and into the second \r\ncycle of the UPR, New Zealand hopes that this year \r\nthere will be positive progress in pursuing the \r\nCouncil’s mandate and that that will be sustained. New \r\nZealand certainly remains ready and willing to support \r\nthat goal. \r\n Mr. Al Habib (Islamic Republic of Iran): At the \r\noutset, I would like to thank the President of the \r\nHuman Rights Council for sharing with us an overview \r\nof the developments and activities of the Council over \r\nthe past year and of challenges ahead, and for her \r\nefforts in the promotion and protection of human rights \r\nat the Council. Built upon the invaluable lessons \r\nlearned from the shortcomings of the former \r\nCommission on Human Rights, the Human Rights \r\nCouncil has inspired new hopes and motivation for \r\nfinding sound and decent solutions to the maladies of \r\nthe Commission, in particular its selective manner in \r\naddressing human rights situations. \r\n The Islamic Republic of Iran considers the \r\nHuman Rights Council to be a focal point for all \r\nGovernments to address global human rights \r\nchallenges, free of politicization, selectivity, double \r\nstandards and confrontational approaches, as \r\nhighlighted by resolution 60/251. \r\n There were high expectations that the Human \r\nRights Council would be a forum for dialogue, mutual \r\nunderstanding and cooperation in achieving the \r\nuniversal realization of human rights, taking into \r\naccount the diversity of cultures and civilizations. \r\nHowever, to our grave dissatisfaction, new concerted \r\nattempts are emerging to force the Council back onto \r\nthe path of the former Commission, with a view to \r\ntransforming it into a mere political tool to serve the \r\npolitical ambitions of a few countries. \r\n My delegation would like to reiterate that the \r\nrationale behind creating the universal periodic review \r\n(UPR) was to ensure universality and non-selectivity in \r\nthe work of the Human Rights Council. There is \r\nunanimity among the States that such a mechanism \r\nconstitutes a breakthrough in the United Nations \r\nintergovernmental human rights activities, and the real \r\nperformance of this mechanism, in a logical setting, is \r\nto allow the human rights machinery to act beyond the \r\nmonopoly of a few in monitoring the human rights \r\nsituations of the Member States.  \r\nA/66/PV.49  \r\n \r\n11-57707 26 \r\n \r\n However, it is deplorable that despite the \r\nexistence of the UPR mechanism in the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, certain countries continue to table country-\r\nspecific resolutions in the Human Rights Council and \r\nin the Third Committee of the General Assembly. It \r\ngoes without saying that such resolutions are \r\npolitically motivated exercises designed to meet the \r\npolitical purposes and interests of their sponsors. \r\n The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran \r\nis fully cooperating with the United Nations human \r\nrights machinery. Last month, the third periodic report \r\nof the Islamic Republic of Iran on the implementation \r\nof the International Covenant on Civil and Political \r\nRights was considered by the Human Rights \r\nCommittee. A high-ranking Iranian delegation that \r\nattended the meeting had an interactive and fruitful \r\ndialogue with Committee members. \r\n With regard to the UPR mechanism, the national \r\nreport of the Islamic Republic of Iran was considered \r\nduring the seventh session of the UPR Working Group, \r\nin February 2010. My Government had made \r\ncomprehensive arrangements with all national stakeholders, \r\nincluding governmental and non-governmental \r\ninstitutions, to draw up and submit the national report \r\nfor the consideration of the UPR Working Group. The \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran fully and closely cooperated \r\nwith the UPR mechanism by submitting a \r\ncomprehensive and detailed national report and \r\ndispatching a high-ranking delegation that actively and \r\nconstructively participated in the review of Iran’s \r\nnational report in order to play its part in the \r\nenhancement and promotion of this newly established \r\nmechanism. \r\n The world is facing numerous human rights \r\nchallenges, such as poverty, discrimination against \r\nmigrants and religious minorities in Western countries, \r\nracial discrimination, foreign occupation and \r\naggression. It is expected that the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, relying on the principles of objectivity, \r\ncooperation, transparency and consensus, will \r\nundertake a more active role in tackling those \r\nchallenges. \r\n Finally, the Islamic Republic of Iran has \r\ncontinuously emphasized the significance of interactive \r\nand cooperative approaches in the promotion of human \r\nrights as established in the purposes and principles of \r\nthe United Nations Charter. We are determined to \r\ncontinue our constructive cooperation with the Council \r\nfor the promotion and protection of human rights all \r\nover the world. \r\n Mr. Shin Dong Ik (Republic of Korea): At the \r\noutset, my delegation would like to express its \r\nappreciation to the President of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, Ambassador Laura Dupuy Lasserre, for \r\npresenting the sixth annual report of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil (A/66/53 and Add.1) to the General Assembly.  \r\n The Republic of Korea is pleased to note that in \r\nthe past one-year period the Human Rights Council \r\nresponded promptly to recent human rights \r\nemergencies, especially in the Middle East and North \r\nAfrica, through four special sessions. The international \r\ncommunity has delivered the unified message that \r\nserious human rights violations should be ended \r\nimmediately and that accountability must be \r\nestablished. My Government once again urges all \r\nrelevant Governments and entities to heed this urgent \r\ncall by the international community. \r\n My delegation notes with satisfaction that the \r\nUniversal Periodic Review (UPR) process completed \r\nits first cycle with the conclusion of the twelfth session \r\nof the Working Group earlier this month. For the most \r\npart, the UPR has proved to be a very constructive \r\nprocess for the countries that have participated. In \r\ngeneral, States under review have made sincere efforts \r\nin preparing their reports and also have displayed great \r\nflexibility, openness and a genuine willingness to \r\ncooperate with the recommendations presented by \r\nother participants in the UPR Working Group. Along \r\nsimilar lines, States participating in conducting the \r\nreviews have also contributed to the working group \r\nprocess by making clear, constructive and pertinent \r\nrecommendations. \r\n The success of the UPR process ultimately \r\ndepends on the sincerity with which States respond to \r\nthe recommendations put forward. The human rights \r\nrecords of all States Members of the United Nations \r\nhaving been reviewed, it is now important that each \r\nState take the recommendations made during the first \r\ncycle of the UPR seriously. In this connection, all \r\nStates should make sincere efforts to fully implement \r\nthe accepted recommendations through concrete \r\nactions and tangible measures with a view towards \r\nachieving the ultimate goal of improving the human \r\nrights situation on the ground. \r\n The Republic of Korea is pleased to see that, as a \r\nfollow-up to the outcome of the review of the work and \r\n A/66/PV.49\r\n \r\n27 11-57707 \r\n \r\nfunctioning of the Human Rights Council, some \r\nimprovements have been made to the modality and \r\nprocedures of the Working Group on the Universal \r\nPeriodic Review. We look forward to the second cycle, \r\nwhich is set to begin next year. We take this \r\nopportunity to reiterate that we attach great importance \r\nto the Universal Periodic Review process and \r\nexpresses its strong commitment to the process in the \r\nfuture. \r\n We would also like to acknowledge that the \r\nreview of the work and functioning of the Human \r\nRights Council, which was completed earlier this year, \r\nhas provided us with a valuable opportunity to identify \r\nother areas in which there is a real need for \r\nimprovement and to find ways to better fulfil the \r\nmandate of the Council. \r\n The Republic of Korea would like to emphasize \r\nthat many good proposals, especially on persistent non-\r\ncooperation and on the capacity of the Council to \r\nrespond promptly to human rights emergencies, should \r\nnot be dismissed simply because they have not been \r\nreflected in the outcome document of the review \r\n(Human Rights Council resolution 17/9, annex). I \r\nbelieve that they will continue to be a good reference \r\npoint in an ever-evolving process of the Council’s \r\ntransformation into an even more effective and credible \r\nbody in the future. \r\n In parallel with the Universal Periodic Review, \r\nthe special procedures system is an important tool in \r\nthe promotion and protection of human rights. The \r\nspecial procedures mandate holders play an \r\nindispensable role in ensuring the timely and effective \r\nresponse to urgent human rights situations in specific \r\ncountries or in reporting on major thematic issues. \r\nHowever, persistent refusals by some States to \r\ncooperate with the special procedures not only \r\ncontinue to present a major challenge to mandate \r\nholders in carrying out their mandates but also \r\nundermine the capacity of the Council to respond to \r\nchronic human rights concerns and emergencies. We \r\nwould like to take this opportunity to reiterate our \r\nstrong support for the special procedures and invite all \r\nStates to continue to cooperate with and assist the \r\nspecial procedures mandate holders in their tasks. \r\n As a firm advocate for adherence to and \r\napplication of human rights principles, the Republic of \r\nKorea has contributed strongly to the work of the \r\nHuman Rights Council through its two consecutive \r\nterms as a Council member, from 2006 to 2008 and \r\n2008 to 2011, and in its current position as an observer \r\nmember. I would like to once again reiterate that the \r\nRepublic of Korea looks forward to continuing its \r\ndemonstrated efforts to enhance a deeper and broader \r\nrespect for human rights around the world. \r\n Mr. Lukiyantsev (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): We would like to thank Ms. Laura Dupuy \r\nLasserre, President of the Human Rights Council, for \r\nintroducing the reports on the work of the Council \r\n(A/66/53 and A/66/53/Add.1).  \r\n The establishment of the Human Rights Council \r\nwas an important milestone in the ongoing reform of \r\nthe United Nations. Changing the main \r\nintergovernmental human rights organ in the United \r\nNations system from a functional commission of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council into a subsidiary body of \r\nthe General Assembly was a real step forward in \r\nacknowledging the importance of human rights as a \r\nUnited Nations priority.  \r\n Just a few months ago we completed an important \r\nstage in the review of the United Nations human rights \r\nstructure. The review consisted of a systematic analysis \r\nof the strengths and weaknesses of the Council, its \r\nspecial procedures and other mechanisms. A key factor \r\nin the success of the review was the recognition by all \r\nStates of the need to strengthen international \r\ncooperation in the human rights field, as well as the \r\nprinciples of dialogue and mutual understanding in \r\nresolving problems in the humanitarian sphere. We \r\nbelieve that the results achieved to date will make the \r\nUnited Nations human rights machinery more effective \r\nso that all peoples and individuals will call upon it.  \r\n In our view, one of the most important functions \r\nof the Council, which it is called on to exercise under \r\nresolution 60/251, is to carry out the Universal \r\nPeriodic Review of the human rights situation in all \r\nUnited Nations Member States. Russia supported the \r\nestablishment of that procedure in the hope that, if \r\ncarried out in a spirit of equal rights and mutual \r\nrespect, it would help to lower the level of \r\nconfrontations that arise in intergovernmental human \r\nrights efforts. We believe that ultimately the Universal \r\nPeriodic Review will completely replace the \r\ndiscredited practice of adopting one-sided and \r\npoliticized resolutions on the human rights situation in \r\none or another country. \r\nA/66/PV.49  \r\n \r\n11-57707 28 \r\n \r\n We also emphasize that it is essential for States to \r\ncomply strictly with relevant intergovernmental \r\nagreements that define the methodology of the Review, \r\nincluding those identifying different categories of \r\nparticipants. It is significant that those provisions were \r\nunanimously confirmed in the recent review of Human \r\nRights Council.  \r\n One of the Council’s most important instruments \r\nis the special procedures system, inherited from the \r\nCommission on Human Rights. Unfortunately, despite \r\nthe undeniable merits of the special procedures, they \r\nalso had severe defects, for which they were rightly \r\ncriticized. We must make sure that human rights \r\nmachinery operates in a less politicized manner and \r\nthat special procedures are carried out in strict \r\naccordance with the Code of Conduct for Special \r\nProcedures Mandate-holders of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, which was adopted by the General Assembly \r\nat its sixty-second session in resolution 62/219. From \r\nan institutional point of view, the Council is now \r\ncharacterized by new types of relationships between \r\nStates and civil society, without which the Council \r\nwould be unable to meet its potential. Russia hopes that \r\nrelations between the Council and non-governmental \r\nhuman rights organizations will be founded on a basis \r\nof mutual respect and constructive dialogue. \r\n Russia supports initiatives to ensure more active \r\nparticipation by the Human Rights Council in \r\nreviewing the basic directions being pursued by the \r\nOffice of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in \r\nits work, including planning and the implementation \r\nand management of the programmes of the Office at \r\nthe global, regional and national levels. Relations \r\nbetween the Council and the Office of the High \r\nCommissioner must be transparent with genuine \r\nfeedback. In relations between the Council and the \r\nOffice of the High Commissioner the same principles \r\nshould apply as applied between the Office of the High \r\nCommissioner and the old Commission on Human \r\nRights, especially as regards accountability. The \r\nprovisions of resolution 48/141 regarding the mandate \r\nof the High Commissioner should apply to the Human \r\nRights Council mandate as well.  \r\n In a more general way, the ultimate goal of the \r\ncooperative efforts of the Council and the Office of the \r\nHigh Commissioner should be to eliminate duplication \r\nof efforts in the work of United Nations human rights \r\nbodies, which, for their part, must be complementary \r\nrather than competitive. The Vienna Declaration and \r\nProgramme of Action reiterated that human rights are \r\nequal, indivisible, interdependent and complementary. \r\nWe therefore wish to remind the Human Rights \r\nCouncil to allot equal attention in its work to all \r\ncategories and norms in the protection of human rights. \r\nWe believe that that must be a fundamental principle in \r\nsetting the Council’s priorities and agenda, in both the \r\nshort and long term. \r\n We also believe that the Council should give due \r\nattention to certain other conceptual issues. Given the \r\nimportance of the intercivilizational and intercultural \r\ncomponents of the United Nations work, we believe it \r\nappropriate that the main intergovernmental human \r\nrights body should deal with the relationships and \r\nmutual influence between the norms and standards in \r\nhuman rights and traditional values. We believe that \r\nuniversal standards with regard to human rights stem \r\nfrom the various civilizations and cultural and \r\nhistorical traditions in different societies. That unites \r\nus in our commitment to human rights; it does not \r\ndivide us. We believe that the resolutions on that topic \r\nadopted at the initiative of Russia provide a good basis \r\nfor such an approach. \r\n As to whether the Human Rights Council of the \r\nUnited Nations will be able to meet the hopes placed \r\non it depends, to a large extent, on us as Member \r\nStates. The guarantee for success is our readiness to \r\nlisten to each other, to consider and respect the views \r\nof others, and to implement our own decisions \r\neffectively. We call on partners among Member States \r\nand representatives of civil society to take stock of \r\nthese aspects of the issue so as to make the Human \r\nRights Council truly effective and productive. \r\n Mr. Mohamed (Maldives): Allow me at the \r\noutset to thank Her Excellency Ambassador Laura \r\nDupuy Lasserre, President of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, for joining us here today and for presenting \r\nthe report of the Human Rights Council to the General \r\nAssembly (A/66/53 and A/65/53/Add.1). We also \r\nwelcome the opportunity to reflect on an eventful year \r\nfor the Human Rights Council, and we appreciate the \r\nleadership taken by the Council on a number of issues \r\nof concern to the international community. \r\n As a member of the Human Rights Council, the \r\nMaldives has taken onboard what is expected of a \r\nmember State, that is, to be responsible and actively \r\nadvocate for the protection of basic rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms for all. We pledge our continued \r\n A/66/PV.49\r\n \r\n29 11-57707 \r\n \r\nsupport to the cause of promoting and protecting \r\nhuman rights, and will continue our work domestically \r\nand internationally in that regard. \r\n This year has been a historic one. The events in \r\nthe Middle East prove that all peoples, regardless of \r\nrace, ethnicity or religion, yearn for their freedoms and \r\nthe full recognition of their basic rights. We commend \r\nthe transitions that have taken place in Tunisia, Egypt \r\nand Libya, and encourage those States to fulfil their \r\nobligations to their citizens and to swiftly move \r\ntowards implementing the necessary structural reforms. \r\n However, we must be mindful that every human \r\nbeing is entitled to his or her rights, and we call on all \r\nparties to cease the ongoing violence, to discourage \r\nextrajudicial retributions against former adversaries, \r\nand to work to ensure protection from abuse as their \r\ncountries move through their transition phase. We \r\nstrongly encourage countries undergoing civil unrest to \r\nengage in dialogue that will lead to peaceful and \r\nsubstantive reforms. \r\n It is the work of the Human Rights Council, and \r\nthe United Nations as a whole, to facilitate such \r\noutcomes. We call upon all States in the process of \r\ntransition to work closely with United Nations bodies \r\nin order to establish the necessary institutions, \r\nincluding an independent judiciary and proper human \r\nrights mechanisms, and to ensure the establishment of \r\nan inclusive and democratic system of Government. \r\n Mr. Shin Dong Ik (Republic of Korea), Vice-\r\nPresident, took the Chair.  \r\n As noted, Maldives has been active in the area of \r\nhuman rights since we underwent our own transition to \r\na democratic system of Government three years ago. \r\nWe have used our own experience to define our human \r\nrights principles. Based on those guiding principles, we \r\nhave been able to participate in a number of issues at \r\nthe international level, including the protection of the \r\nrights of women and the review of the work of the \r\nHuman Rights Council. \r\n The Maldives also took a lead role in other areas \r\nof importance and concern. In response to the \r\nunfolding events in the Middle East, we took action in \r\nthe Human Rights Council in calling for special \r\nsessions on Libya and Syria. We co-sponsored the \r\nresolutions establishing commissions of inquiry to look \r\ninto allegations of gross human rights violations in \r\nboth of those countries. \r\n In addition, the Maldives, working with a number \r\nof other key countries, also played an important part in \r\nthe negotiations on the Optional Protocol to the \r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child on a \r\ncommunications procedure. We took part in the \r\ndiscussions with a view to bridging the differences of \r\nopinion among delegations and to underlining the \r\nfundamental nature of a communications procedure to \r\nprotect the rights of children. We hope that the \r\nresolution, which the Council adopted in Geneva in \r\nJune, will be adopted by the General Assembly as well, \r\nafter which it will be open for signature in 2012. We \r\ncall on all countries to support the adoption of that \r\ndraft resolution by consensus in the General Assembly. \r\n No Member State of the United Nations has a \r\nperfect human rights record. However, we strongly \r\nbelieve that engagement with the Human Rights \r\nCouncil and its machinery, including the Universal \r\nPeriodic Review, would yield better results for Member \r\nStates, as the Council has the potential to assist \r\ncountries on a number of the challenges that they face. \r\nWith that in mind, the Maldives was in the core group \r\nof countries that called for the establishment of new \r\nspecial procedures on the freedom of assembly and on \r\nlaws that discriminate against women, a special \r\nprocedure on truth, justice and reconciliation, and, \r\nlastly, the establishment of the Special Rapporteur on \r\nthe situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of \r\nIran. \r\n On the issue of Palestine, the Maldives continues \r\nto extend its unwavering support for the creation of an \r\nindependent State of Palestine, living side by side and \r\nat peace with the State of Israel. We remain extremely \r\nconcerned about the human rights situation in Gaza and \r\nthe fate of the Palestinian people suffering under the \r\nIsraeli blockade. We call upon all parties concerned to \r\ntake on board the recommendations contained in the \r\nreport of the Independent International Fact-Finding \r\nMission on the Gaza Conflict (see A/64/490, annex), \r\nand to take immediate measures to protect the rights of \r\nall Palestinian people. \r\n Domestically, we have continued our own \r\nprocesses of establishing and strengthening critical \r\nhuman rights institutions. While we are proud of the \r\nprogress that we have made, we recognize the steps \r\nthat need to be taken to promote and protect the full \r\nrights of all our citizens. As a priority, we must ensure \r\nthat we have a functioning independent judiciary that \r\nA/66/PV.49  \r\n \r\n11-57707 30 \r\n \r\nunderstands its role as a protector of the rule of law \r\nand human rights. \r\n We must also continue to appoint and to elect an \r\nincreasing number of women to all branches of the \r\njudiciary and to areas of the public and private sectors. \r\nIn addition, we must provide our youth with the \r\neducation, opportunity and proper social institutions, \r\nso as to ensure that they receive the necessary tools to \r\ncontribute to the betterment of society and \r\nunderstanding of the universality of human rights. \r\n In the coming year, the Maldives would like to \r\nsee a continued focus on the human rights situations in \r\nthe emerging democracies in the Middle East, the \r\nachievement of greater equality for women and \r\nstronger protection of the rights of the child. \r\n In that regard, we stand ready to lend our \r\nassistance and to extend our continued commitment to \r\nimproving human rights globally. We look forward to \r\ncontinuing that work with great optimism, as we see \r\ndemocracy and a greater recognition of human rights \r\nspread throughout the world. \r\n Mr. Haniff (Malaysia): The General Assembly, in \r\nits resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006, decided that \r\nthe Human Rights Council should review its work and \r\nfunctioning within five years of its establishment and \r\nreport to the General Assembly. Pursuant to the \r\nmandate authorized by resolution A/HRC/12/1, \r\nMalaysia was delighted to note the commencement of \r\nan open-ended intergovernmental working group to \r\nreview the work and functioning of the Council and the \r\ncommendable efforts of the President of the Human \r\nRights Council in holding open-ended informal \r\nconsultations on 26 May, 30 August and 6 September \r\n2010, respectively, to further delineate the process and \r\nthe modalities of the review. \r\n The review process, which was convened in two \r\nseparate sessions in October 2010 and February 2011, \r\nwas aimed at strengthening the Council in its ability to \r\nprotect and promote human rights. The review process \r\ntherefore attempted to improve various aspects of the \r\nCouncil’s work, including the Universal Periodic \r\nReview, special procedures, the Human Rights Council \r\nAdvisory Committee, the complaints procedures, the \r\nagenda of and framework for a programme of work, \r\nand the Council’s methods of work and rules of \r\nprocedure. \r\n My delegation wishes to make some comments \r\non the Universal Periodic Review and the special \r\nprocedures. Allow me, first, to commend some of the \r\nencouraging assessments of and recommendations for \r\nthe focus and modalities of the Review. Given the \r\ncomplexity of human rights issues, the \r\nrecommendation to extend the review cycle to four and \r\na half years, and with the existing resources and \r\nworkload, is indeed welcome. In that regard, Malaysia \r\nnotes with appreciation the recommendation that the \r\nUniversal Periodic Review Voluntary Trust Fund to \r\nfacilitate the participation of States, established by \r\nHuman Rights Council resolution 6/17, should be \r\nstrengthened and operationalized to encourage \r\nsignificant participation of developing countries, \r\nparticularly the least developed countries and small \r\nisland developing States, in their reviews.  \r\n In the area of special procedures, in line with \r\nCouncil resolution 5/2, States should cooperate with \r\nand assist special procedures in the performance of \r\ntheir tasks, and it is incumbent upon mandate holders \r\nto exercise their functions in accordance with their \r\nmandates and in compliance with the code of conduct. \r\nAs enshrined in the Paris Principles, the integrity and \r\nindependence of the special procedures and the \r\nprinciples of cooperation, transparency and \r\naccountability are integral to ensuring a robust system \r\nof special procedures that will enhance the Council’s \r\ncapacity to address human rights situations on the \r\nground. \r\n We take note of the work of the special \r\nprocedures in fostering a constructive dialogue with \r\nStates. By the same token, we would encourage the \r\nspecial procedures with country-specific mandates to \r\nclosely examine the concerned country’s internal \r\nsituation in order to provide reports that would help to \r\nimprove the internal human rights situations, while \r\ntaking into consideration the views of the majority. \r\n In Malaysia’s view, the purpose of the Human \r\nRights Council review is to enhance the Council’s \r\neffectiveness and efficiency in discharging its mandate. \r\nThat requires achieving consensus on practical and \r\nrealistic outcomes. Malaysia notes with appreciation \r\nthat the review process is a continuous effort, and the \r\nreview is the first step in a continuing journey. In \r\nMalaysia’s view, the Council should continue its efforts \r\nto become more responsive to that quest, which reflects \r\nthe determination to seize the opportunity of the review \r\nto streamline the Council’s work and maintain and \r\n A/66/PV.49\r\n \r\n31 11-57707 \r\n \r\nincrease its relevance to the human rights situation on \r\nthe ground. \r\n Lastly, Malaysia fully supports the holistic goals \r\nof the review process of the Human Rights Council, \r\nwhich aims to contribute to the betterment of human \r\nrights. It is our utmost hope that the outcome of the \r\nreview process will be geared to maintaining the \r\nprinciples of objectivity, inclusiveness, non-politicization, \r\nnon-confrontation and, above all, avoiding double \r\nstandards and ensuring the equal and fair participation \r\nof all States, which should remain the fundamental \r\nrequisite of this State-driven process. \r\n Mr. Lanlehin (Nigeria): The Nigerian delegation \r\nwarmly welcomes the President of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, Ambassador Laura Dupuy Lasserre, to New \r\nYork for this important event — the presentation of the \r\nreport of the Human Rights Council (A/66/53 and \r\nAdd.1). We commend and thank Ambassador Lasserre \r\nfor her astute leadership of the Human Rights Council, \r\njust as we commend and thank her predecessor, \r\nAmbassador Sihasak Phuangketkeow, for his \r\ncontributions to advancing the work of the Council. We \r\nacknowledge the fact that part of this report relates to \r\nthe time period when Ambassador Phuangketkeow was \r\nin office.  \r\n We associate ourselves with the statement made \r\nearlier by the representative of the United Republic of \r\nTanzania on behalf of the African Group. \r\n Nigeria, as a democratic country, attaches great \r\nimportance to respect for human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms, not only within our country but \r\nacross the world. It is for this reason that we are \r\nactively engaged with the Human Rights Council and \r\ninterested in seeing the Council achieve the mandate \r\nentrusted to it by the General Assembly, which is to \r\npromote and protect fundamental human rights. \r\n Nigeria is pleased to note the Council’s \r\nsubstantial efforts towards achieving its mandate. The \r\nfact that it meets in three annual regular sessions, as \r\nwell as special sessions, allows it to devote attention to \r\nglobal human rights issues in a timely and effective \r\nmanner. Its various special procedures are also \r\nsignificant in that regard. The wide range of issues \r\ncontained in the Council’s report and even its sheer \r\nvolume reflect the complexity and multiplicity of \r\nissues that the Council has dealt with. \r\n We urge that the work of the Council continue to \r\nbe guided by resolution 60/251 and solidly grounded \r\non the fundamental principles underpinning the Vienna \r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action on human rights. \r\nWhile we see the Council as a unique tool for the \r\nprotection and promotion of all human rights, be they \r\ncivil, political, economic, social or cultural, we also \r\nhold the view that a focus on economic, social and \r\ncultural rights might serve as the Council’s own \r\ncontribution to assisting States to attain the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. \r\n The Nigerian delegation would like to commend \r\nthe Human Rights Council for two important \r\nachievements, namely, the completion of the first cycle \r\nof the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) and the \r\nconclusion of the review process on the work and \r\nfunctioning of the Human Rights Council. The UPR \r\nhas so far proven to be quite successful. It is quite \r\nremarkable that since the first session of the Working \r\nGroup on the Universal Periodic Review in February \r\n2008, this mechanism has attracted 100 per cent \r\nparticipation by States. We look forward to the \r\ncommencement of the second cycle of the UPR, and \r\nwe expect it to reinforce the importance of the UPR \r\nmechanism as a means of promoting and protecting \r\nhuman rights across the world. \r\n Nigeria is pleased to note the substantial increase \r\nin the number of standing invitations issued to special \r\nprocedures and the growing number of States ratifying \r\nthe core human rights instruments. Nigeria welcomes \r\nthe adoption in Geneva of the outcome of the review of \r\nthe work and functioning of the Human Rights Council \r\nand the subsequent endorsement of the document by \r\nthe General Assembly in June. \r\n Nigeria would like to acknowledge the fact that \r\npeople across the world expect the United Nations to \r\nprotect their human rights and fundamental freedoms. \r\nWe see evidence of that in the active participation of \r\nnon-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the \r\nactivities of the Human Rights Council. We welcome \r\nthe Council’s engagement with NGOs as a way of \r\nenabling the voice of the people to be heard. \r\n Finally, we would like to underscore the \r\nimportance of States’ cooperation in advancing the \r\nwork of the Human Rights Council. We seize this \r\nopportunity to affirm our unwavering commitment to \r\ncooperate with all States in that regard.  \r\nA/66/PV.49  \r\n \r\n11-57707 32 \r\n \r\n Mr. Errázuriz (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): My \r\ndelegation welcomes the presentation to the Assembly \r\nby the President of the Human Rights Council, \r\nAmbassador Laura Dupuy Lasserre of Uruguay. It is \r\nthe first time that the President of the Council has \r\npersonally done that. That is a direct result of the \r\nreview process of the Council that was approved by the \r\nAssembly in June.  \r\n Chile congratulates the President of the Council, \r\nAmbassador Dupuy Lasserre, on her leading of the \r\nCouncil’s work. Her presidency, and through her, that \r\nof her country, reflects the international community’s \r\nrecognition of Uruguay’s important contribution in the \r\narea of human rights.  \r\n Chile has actively participated in the review of \r\nthe Human Rights Council in both Geneva and in New \r\nYork. At both venues, we proposed that the Council \r\nshould have resources sufficient to be able to fulfil its \r\nfunctions promptly and effectively. In that way, \r\ndepending on the urgency of a particular crisis, it will \r\nbe well positioned either to make a difference on the \r\nground or to carry out its normal functions as required \r\nby the international community. \r\n Today we heard from the President that the \r\nCouncil needs more funds in order to function better, \r\nespecially for the conference services needed to handle  \r\n \r\nthe flow of national reports submitted as part of the \r\nUniversal Periodic Review. The presidency of the \r\nHuman Rights Council can count on Chile’s support.  \r\n In her report, the Council President detailed the \r\nactivities carried out by the Council over the past year, \r\nnot only during its regular sessions to receive reports \r\nunder the Universal Periodic Review process, but also \r\nduring its special sessions and commissions of inquiry. \r\nThose activities were noteworthy for their dispatch and \r\nfor dealing with specific situations, and they made a \r\ndifference.  \r\n The most important aspects of the human rights \r\narchitecture, in particular of the special procedures, are \r\nthe independence and impartiality of its senior \r\nofficials, as well as the Council’s non-selective and \r\nnon-discriminatory approach. All of those aspects must \r\nunderpin the Council’s work in deciding when it needs \r\nto set up a special procedure in a given situation. We \r\nare sure that under Ms. Lasserre’s guidance the Council \r\nwill proceed in the same manner. \r\n The Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on this item. The Assembly has \r\nthus concluded this stage of its consideration of agenda \r\nitem 64. \r\n  The meeting rose at 6.25 p.m. \r\n"
