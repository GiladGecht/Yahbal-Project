(Qatar) \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 122  \r\n \r\nQuestion of equitable representation on and increase \r\nin the membership of the Security Council and \r\nrelated matters \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): At the outset, I \r\nwould like to express my great pleasure as we begin \r\nour meeting today to consider agenda item 122, on the \r\nquestion of equitable representation on and increase in \r\nthe membership of the Security Council and related \r\nmatters. This issue in particular is central to the reform \r\nprocess of the United Nations. There is clear consensus \r\namong the majority of the members of the international \r\ncommunity on the need for the United Nations in \r\ngeneral, and the Security Council in particular, to adapt \r\nto the changes that have been taking place \r\ninternationally since 1945. \r\n Our meeting today is of the utmost importance, \r\nbecause it constitutes the starting point for the \r\nresumption of discussions of this vital issue, which I \r\nhave personally grown to appreciate over my more \r\nthan a decade of experience at the United Nations. I am \r\nwell aware of just how important this issue is and \r\nrealize its centrality to the wider question of United \r\nNations reform.  \r\n At the beginning of my presidency, I identified \r\nSecurity Council reform as one of the four pillars of \r\nmy programme of work for the sixty-sixth session of \r\nthe General Assembly. Here I would also like to \r\nmention my statement of 16 September addressed to \r\nMember States, in which I emphasized my confidence \r\nin the leadership of the Permanent Representative of \r\nthe Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, Ambassador \r\nTanin, in chairing the intergovernmental negotiations \r\non Security Council reform. I should also like to affirm \r\nmy full support for his endeavours in guiding these \r\nnegotiations. I hope that Member States will adopt a \r\nflexible and constructive approach during the \r\nforthcoming round of negotiations. \r\n While I have no doubt that there continue to be \r\ntangible differences between the positions of different \r\nparties on various aspects of the issue, I hope that the \r\ndiscussions during these intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations will lead to the formulation of well-\r\ndefined steps in the reform process, steps, we hope, \r\nthat will attract the broadest possible acceptance on the \r\npart of Member States, in the manner defined in \r\ndecision 62/557.  \r\n I believe that achieving genuine progress in \r\nreforming the Security Council will make a positive \r\ncontribution towards increasing the capacity and \r\neffectiveness of the response of the United Nations to \r\nglobal challenges. In that regard, I have no doubt that \r\nwe all agree on the urgent need to bring the United \r\nNations closer to and more conformable with the \r\nrealities of the twenty-first century. \r\n The general debate at the sixty-sixth session \r\nreflected world leaders’ shared views on the pressing \r\nneed for Security Council reform at the earliest \r\nopportunity, reform that will make the Council more \r\nefficient, transparent, inclusive and democratic. Here, I \r\nA/66/PV.51  \r\n \r\n11-58384 2 \r\n \r\nshould like to make it very clear that the primary \r\nresponsibility for realizing our aspiration to reform the \r\nSecurity Council lies with the Member States. The \r\nchances for our success will be improved by our \r\ncollective will and by putting to good use the points on \r\nwhich agreement was reached during the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. \r\n Finally, I sincerely encourage the Assembly to \r\nfully engage in the relevant discussions with flexibility \r\nand effectiveness. I hope that our discussions today \r\nwill move matters forward and make it possible to \r\nachieve the progress desired in a manner that garners \r\nthe widest possible political support among Member \r\nStates. I wish you every success. \r\n Mr. Abdelaziz (Egypt): I have the pleasure to \r\nspeak today on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement. \r\n At the outset, I would like to express the \r\nMovement’s appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Joseph \r\nDeiss, President of the General Assembly at the sixty-\r\nfifth session, for his efforts and goodwill in advancing \r\nthe important issue of Security Council reform.  \r\n I would also like, on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement, to commend you, President Nassir \r\nAbdulaziz Al-Nasser, for putting this issue at the top of \r\nyour priorities for the sixty-sixth session of the \r\nAssembly, and for expressing your commitment to \r\nexerting every all efforts to reform the Security \r\nCouncil, based on the collective will of the Member \r\nStates. The Movement congratulates you, Sir, for \r\nreaffirming confidence in His Excellency Ambassador \r\nZahir Tanin, Permanent Representative of Afghanistan \r\nto the United Nations, and in his continuing to serve as \r\nChair of the intergovernmental negotiations on the \r\nreform of the Security Council, which will help us to \r\nachieve maximum progress during the sixty-sixth \r\nsession. \r\n The Non-Aligned Movement attaches great \r\nimportance to achieving concrete results on Security \r\nCouncil reform through intergovernmental negotiations \r\nand in accordance with decision 62/557 and subsequent \r\ndecisions 63/565, 64/568 and 65/554. In that regard, \r\nThe Movement’s position is clearly reaffirmed in \r\nsection E of the final document (A/65/896, annex), \r\nadopted by the sixteenth Ministerial Conference of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement, held in Bali, Indonesia, in \r\nMay. \r\n The Movement believes that the reform of the \r\nSecurity Council should be addressed in a prompt, \r\ncomprehensive, transparent and balanced manner, \r\nwithout setting artificial deadlines, in order to properly \r\nreflect the needs and interests of both developing and \r\ndeveloped countries, while at the same time addressing \r\nall substantive issues relating, inter alia, to the question \r\nof membership and regional representation and the \r\nCouncil’s agenda, working methods and decision-\r\nmaking process, including the veto. \r\n That is why the Ministers of the Movement, at \r\ntheir recent gathering in Bali, reiterated that decision \r\n62/557 will continue to be the basis for \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform. They also stressed that the enlargement of the \r\nSecurity Council and the reform of its working \r\nmethods, as the body primarily responsible for the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, should \r\nlead to a democratic, more representative, more \r\naccountable and more effective Council.  \r\n In that context, the Ministers of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement acknowledged the historical injustices \r\nagainst Africa with regard to its representation in the \r\nSecurity Council, and expressed support for increased \r\nand enhanced representation of the African continent in \r\nthe reformed Security Council. They also took note of \r\nthe common African position as reflected in the \r\nEzulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration. \r\n Improving the working methods of the Security \r\nCouncil is of great importance to the Movement, as it \r\nis crucial for the effectiveness of the Council. \r\nTransparency, openness and consistency are key \r\nelements that the Security Council should observe and \r\npreserve in all its activities, approaches and \r\nprocedures. The rules of procedure of the Security \r\nCouncil, which have remained provisional for more \r\nthan 60 years, should be formalized in order to \r\nimprove its transparency and accountability. Moreover, \r\nthe Movement rejects any attempts to use the Council \r\nto pursue national political agendas and stresses the \r\nnecessity of non-selectivity and impartiality in its \r\nwork. \r\n In that regard, there is an urgent need for the \r\nSecurity Council to adhere to the powers and functions \r\naccorded to it by Member States under the United \r\nNations Charter. The Council should therefore stop \r\nencroaching on the functions and powers of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the Economic and Social \r\n A/66/PV.51\r\n \r\n3 11-58384 \r\n \r\nCouncil by addressing issues that traditionally fall \r\nwithin the competence of those organs. Close \r\ncooperation and coordination among all principal \r\norgans are highly indispensable in order to enable the \r\nUnited Nations to remain relevant and capable of \r\nmeeting existing, new and emerging threats and \r\nchallenges. \r\n The Security Council should also avoid resorting \r\nto Chapter VII of the Charter as an umbrella for \r\naddressing issues that do not necessarily pose a threat \r\nto international peace and security. It should, rather, \r\nfully utilize the provisions of other relevant chapters, \r\nwhere appropriate, including Chapters VI and VIII, \r\nbefore invoking Chapter VII, which should be a \r\nmeasure of last resort. \r\n Security Council-imposed sanctions remain an \r\nissue of serious concern to the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement. The use of sanctions raises fundamental \r\nethical questions as to whether suffering inflicted on \r\nvulnerable groups in the targeted country is a \r\nlegitimate means of exerting pressure. In that regard, \r\nthe objectives of sanctions regimes should be clearly \r\ndefined, and their imposition should be for a specific \r\ntime frame and should be based on tenable legal \r\ngrounds and be lifted as soon as the objectives are \r\nachieved. The conditions demanded of the State or \r\nparty on which sanctions are imposed should be clearly \r\ndefined and subject to periodic review. \r\n The Movement remains committed to the \r\ndynamic and ongoing process of overall reform of the \r\nUnited Nations, including the reform of the Security \r\nCouncil, in accordance with the objectives and scope \r\nof the review exercise set out in the 2005 World \r\nSummit Outcome (resolution 60/1) and the Millennium \r\nDeclaration (resolution 55/2). Such reform should not \r\nbe considered an end in itself, and must be \r\ncomprehensive, transparent, inclusive and balanced. It \r\nshould be pursued in an effective and accountable \r\nmanner, fully respecting the political nature of the \r\nOrganization, as well as its universal and democratic \r\ncharacter, consistent with the Charter. In that context, \r\nany reform measures should be decided by Member \r\nStates through an intergovernmental process and the \r\nvoice of each and every Member State must be heard \r\nand respected. \r\n In my national capacity, I would like to associate \r\nmy remarks with the statement to be delivered by the \r\nPermanent Representative of Sierra Leone on behalf of \r\nthe African Group and to add the following elements. \r\n Egypt reiterates its long-standing position \r\ntowards achieving tangible progress and reaching \r\nconcrete results in the intergovernmental negotiations \r\non Security Council reform on the basis of consensus \r\ndecision 62/557. Paragraph (d) of that decision clearly \r\nstipulates that the intergovernmental negotiations \r\nshould be based on proposals submitted by Member \r\nStates. The rationale is to preserve the \r\nintergovernmental nature of the process and avoid \r\njeopardizing the neutrality and impartiality of the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly and the Chair of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. \r\n The five key issues of our intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations are clearly defined in paragraph (e) (ii) of \r\ndecision 62/557. They should remain inextricably \r\nlinked and constitute an integral and inseparable \r\npackage that must be agreed upon together. \r\nAccordingly, any proposed outcome of the review \r\nexercise should include all five negotiable issues and \r\nshould garner the widest possible political acceptance \r\nby Member States. \r\n Our efforts should be directed at reaching an \r\nagreement that would have an effect on the power \r\nstructure of the Security Council and allow equitable \r\nrepresentation of all regions. Selectivity in dealing \r\nwith the five key issues or attempts to classify them \r\ninto points of convergence and divergence will only \r\ndivide Member States and jeopardize the progress \r\nachieved so far. \r\n Egypt, along with the African Group, continues to \r\ncall for agreement first on the principles and criteria of \r\nthe negotiations regarding the five key issues before \r\nembarking on any drafting exercise involving merging \r\nlanguage or streamlining positions in the compilation \r\ntext, or even discussing any proposed draft resolutions. \r\n In full observance of the Ezulwini Consensus and \r\nthe Sirte Declaration, limiting the expansion of the \r\nSecurity Council only to the non-permanent category \r\nor to the enlargement of the permanent category \r\nwithout veto rights is not an option for Africa, as both \r\noptions will neither change the power structure of the \r\nCouncil nor correct the historical injustice to the \r\nAfrican continent. \r\n Accordingly, Egypt believes that one way to \r\nadvance negotiations on the veto rights of new and \r\nA/66/PV.51  \r\n \r\n11-58384 4 \r\n \r\ncurrent permanent members alike would be the \r\nconsideration of restricting the scope of application of \r\nthe veto rights accorded to both current and new \r\npermanent members to exclude cases of genocide, \r\nethnic cleansing, crimes against humanity, grave \r\nviolations of international humanitarian law, the \r\ncessation of hostilities between belligerent parties and \r\nthe election of the Secretary-General. \r\n Regional representation is also closely linked to \r\nthe size of the enlarged Security Council. Therefore, \r\nwhen the Ezulwini Consensus states that Africa is \r\ndemanding, inter alia, no less than two permanent seats \r\nwith all prerogatives and privileges, including the right \r\nof veto, that should be read in the sense that Africa \r\nmight demand more permanent seats if other regions, \r\nsmaller in size and number, are to get more seats than \r\njustified by their ratio of representation among the \r\nwider membership. Despite the continued efforts and \r\nattempts within the Security Council’s Informal \r\nWorking Group on Documentation and Other \r\nProcedural Questions to improve the Council’s \r\nworking methods, none of those efforts has met the \r\naspirations of the larger majority of Member States, as \r\nthe views of the General Assembly have not been taken \r\ninto consideration in that exercise. \r\n Enhanced representation of developing countries \r\nand small States in the Security Council remains one of \r\nthe fundamental pillars of the reform process since the \r\nadoption of resolution 48/26. Egypt stresses the \r\nnecessity of taking duly into account the position of the \r\nmembers of the League of Arab States demanding a \r\npermanent seat for the Arab Group in any future \r\nexpansion in the category of permanent membership of \r\nthe Council. That position was reaffirmed in the Sirte \r\nDeclaration adopted by the Arab Summit in its ordinary \r\nsession of 28 March 2010. We also stress the necessity \r\nof taking into account the position of the Organization \r\nof Islamic Cooperation, which demands adequate \r\nrepresentation of the Muslim Ummah in any category \r\nof membership in the expanded Council. \r\n Mr. Wolfe (Jamaica): I have the honour to speak \r\non behalf of the group of countries that sponsored draft \r\nresolution A/61/L.69/Rev.1. The L.69 group is a diverse \r\ngroup of 40 countries from Africa, Latin America and \r\nthe Caribbean, Asia and the Pacific that are united by a \r\ncommon cause, namely, to achieve lasting and \r\ncomprehensive reform of the Security Council. \r\n The L.69 group is firmly convinced that \r\nexpansion in both the permanent and non-permanent \r\ncategories of membership of the Security Council is \r\nneeded in order to better reflect contemporary world \r\nrealities and achieve a more accountable, \r\nrepresentative and transparent Security Council. Those \r\nare the principles that we feel should be at the heart of \r\nSecurity Council reform. And we are convinced that \r\nthe overwhelming majority of United Nations Member \r\nStates think along similar lines. \r\n The L.69 position is well known. But let me \r\nrecap briefly that the L.69 group calls for expanding \r\nthe Security Council from the present 15 to around \r\n25 or 26 members, with the inclusion of new \r\npermanent and non-permanent members as per the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. The new permanent \r\nmembers would include countries from Africa, Asia, \r\nand Latin America and the Caribbean. The new \r\nnon-permanent members would be from Asia, East \r\nEurope, the Group of Latin American and Caribbean \r\nStates and from Africa, taking into account the need to \r\nensure representation from developing countries, \r\nincluding small island developing States, wherein \r\nparticipation shall be based on the concept of rotating \r\nseats. There must also be improvement in the working \r\nmethods of the Council and in the relationship between \r\nthe Security Council and the General Assembly. \r\n Let me take this opportunity to applaud your \r\ncommitment, Mr. President, to this important agenda \r\nitem, which was evident in your opening address to the \r\nGeneral Assembly on 13 September. You also acted \r\nfast in reappointing Ambassador Zahir Tanin as the \r\nChair of the intergovernmental negotiations. That was \r\na wise decision and the L.69 group applauds you for \r\nthat. \r\n The L.69 group will continue to work actively \r\nand constructively with Ambassador Tanin. We were \r\ninstrumental in starting the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations. We remain engaged in those negotiations \r\non the understanding that the Charter of the United \r\nNations, the rules of procedure of the General \r\nAssembly and the relevant General Assembly \r\nresolutions require support from a two-thirds majority \r\nof the United Nations membership for any decision in \r\nthat regard. We appeal to Ambassador Tanin, through \r\nthe President of the General Assembly, to convene a \r\nmeeting on the intergovernmental negotiations as soon \r\nas possible. \r\n A/66/PV.51\r\n \r\n5 11-58384 \r\n \r\n Let me say a few words on the L.69 group’s \r\nassessment of the state of play. Member States have \r\nbeen engaged in the intergovernmental negotiations \r\nsince 2009, including text-based negotiations, which \r\nbegan in mid-2010. Substantial progress has been made \r\nand a third revision of the negotiation text was issued \r\nin the beginning of the year. At the first exchange of \r\nthe seventh round of intergovernmental negotiations on \r\n2 March, it readily became evident that we were once \r\nagain at an impasse. A small group of delegations \r\nexpressed their opposition to the third revision of the \r\nnegotiation text, throwing the negotiations into \r\nsuspense mode. \r\n To break the existing deadlock, a broad coalition \r\nof Member States undertook an initiative aimed at \r\ntaking the process forward. The initiative took as its \r\nstarting point the assessment made by Ambassador \r\nTanin in September 2009 that the reform model \r\nseeking an expansion in both categories “commanded \r\nthe most support from the delegations taking the floor.” \r\nFurther, the initiative was completely in accordance \r\nwith the parameters laid down in General Assembly \r\ndecision 62/557, which established the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations, and other relevant \r\nresolutions. \r\n The initiative consisted of reaching out to \r\nMember States based on the proposition that the reform \r\nof the Security Council should include expansion in \r\nboth of the Charter-provided permanent and \r\nnon-permanent categories as well as improvement on \r\nits working methods. The results of the outreach \r\nindicated that the proposition enjoys broad support \r\nfrom delegations across various regions. To date, an \r\noverwhelming majority of delegations have signalled \r\ntheir support for the proposition, including 80 that have \r\ndone so in writing. \r\n The L.69 group believes that such strong support \r\nfor the initiative should be the basis for further \r\ndiscussions in the intergovernmental negotiations. \r\n Mr. Touray (Sierra Leone): Permit me, on behalf \r\nof the African Group of States, to thank you, Sir, for \r\nconvening this debate on agenda item 122, “Question \r\nof equitable representation on and increase in the \r\nmembership of the Security Council and related \r\nmatters”. Let me at the outset express thanks and \r\nappreciation to those Member States that have \r\nresponded to the call of the facilitator and sent in \r\ndocuments outlining their respective initiatives on \r\nSecurity Council reform, the results of which have \r\nbeen circulated to the entire membership. We share the \r\nFacilitator’s belief that such documents would help \r\ninform the process as it moves forward and their \r\ncirculation helps to maintain an open, transparent, \r\ninclusive and comprehensive process. \r\n The facilitator has made his usual commitment to \r\nthe process and circulated the documents he received \r\nunder cover of his letter of 9 September. We are \r\ngratified by and take comfort in the declaration of \r\nsupport for the African cause that was unequivocally \r\nand forcefully documented in the outcome and \r\nprinciples that emerged from the ministerial-level \r\nconference on global governance and Security Council \r\nreform held in Rome on 16 May this year, which was \r\nattended by 123 delegations, including the President of \r\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. \r\n The outcome and principles were contained in the \r\nfacilitator’s bundle. They expressed the common will \r\nthat emerged at the meeting to correct, first of all, the \r\ninjustice done to the continent, which is the subject of \r\n70 per cent of the Council’s decisions but is, at the \r\nsame time, underrepresented in it. \r\n As we continue to hold consultations and remain \r\nopen to further exchanges with all interested groups \r\nand Member States that have proposed or are likely to \r\npropose initiatives on Security Council reform, we urge \r\nthe facilitator, in keeping with the principle that the \r\nreform process is membership-driven and requires the \r\nbroad support of the general membership, to translate \r\nand implement that common will of nearly two-thirds \r\nof the membership into action. That can be done by \r\nfactoring the special needs of Africa into the reform \r\nprocess as a special case in the facilitator’s programme \r\nof work during this session, in order to ensure that due \r\nregard is given to the voice of such a substantial \r\nmajority of Member States. \r\n We underscore our firm commitment to that very \r\nimportant issue and look forward to much progress \r\nduring this session. Indeed, all Member States have \r\nrecognized the need to reform the Security Council to \r\nmake it more representative, more democratic and \r\nmore legitimate. Therefore, all of us must seek to agree \r\non a realistic reform that takes into account the core \r\nvalues of the United Nations, namely, inclusiveness, \r\ndemocracy, accountability and transparency.  \r\n After nearly two decades of debate, we seem to \r\nbe gradually approaching a point where the United \r\nA/66/PV.51  \r\n \r\n11-58384 6 \r\n \r\nNations will lose its credibility, if we fail to generate \r\nthe necessary political will to make progress on this \r\nvery crucial issue. In that regard, we urge Member \r\nStates to be flexible in their quest for a more secure \r\nworld and a more representative and democratic global \r\ngovernance system. \r\n Allow me at this juncture to refresh our memories \r\nof the call made by His Excellency Mr. Ernest Bai \r\nKoroma, Chair of the African Union Committee of Ten \r\nHeads of State and Government on the Reform of the \r\nUnited Nations Security Council and President of the \r\nRepublic of Sierra Leone, in his statement during the \r\ngeneral debate, on 23 September, in which he said: \r\n “There is an increasing need for the Security \r\nCouncil to be more representative, inclusive and \r\ndemocratic, as well as for an improvement in its \r\nworking methods and its relations with the \r\nGeneral Assembly. The status quo is increasingly \r\nunacceptable and has the potential to undermine \r\nthe legitimacy, effectiveness and efficiency of the \r\nCouncil’s work in maintaining international peace \r\nand security. It is therefore imperative that we \r\nreaffirm our commitment to the standards and \r\nprinciples of this noble Organization by \r\ngenerating the political will for a reformed \r\nSecurity Council that would pave the way for \r\ncorrecting the historical injustice done to Africa, \r\nthrough the allocation during this session of two \r\npermanent seats and five non-permanent seats to \r\nAfrica, in accordance with the United Nations \r\nCharter.” (A/66/PV.20, p. 3) \r\n It is clear from President Koroma’s address as \r\nChair of the African Union Committee that ours is a \r\ncontinental aspiration with which we believe all \r\nMember States and other stakeholders are now very \r\nfamiliar. In that sense and in the African context, we \r\nrecognize the importance of paying due regard to, and \r\nstrengthening the profile of, the regional dimension in \r\na reformed Security Council. \r\n The present geopolitical realities and \r\ncircumstances clearly dictate the common sense and \r\nfairness of Africa’s full and effective representation in \r\nall decision-making bodies of the United Nations, in \r\nparticular the Security Council. We reaffirm that, in \r\naccordance with the common African position set forth \r\nin the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration, \r\nAfrica’s full representation in Security Council means, \r\nfirst, no less than two permanent seats together with all \r\nthe prerogatives and privileges of permanent \r\nmembership, including the right of veto as long as it \r\ncontinues to exist; and secondly, five non-permanent \r\nseats, with the African Union being entrusted with the \r\nresponsibility of selecting Africa’s representatives in \r\nthe Security Council. It is our collective responsibility \r\nto correct the present imbalance in the composition of \r\nthe Council, so as to give it greater legitimacy as an \r\norgan that is primarily responsible for the maintenance \r\nof international peace and security. \r\n We note that the task of the facilitator is not an \r\neasy one. The facilitator faces an array of initiatives \r\nand positions of interest groups and Member States on \r\nhow to move forward and/or how to turn the third \r\nrevision of the negotiating text into an acceptable \r\nworking document, and must also respect the common \r\nwill of a substantial majority of Member States to \r\ncorrect, first of all, the injustice done to the African \r\ncontinent. However, we pledge to continue to engage in \r\nthe process as usual, in good faith and with mutual \r\ntrust, in order to achieve a reform that will garner the \r\nwidest possible political acceptance of the entire \r\nmembership within the shortest possible time. \r\n In conclusion, we hope that this session will set \r\nthe tone for a more frank and lively debate in the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations, in which there will be \r\nmore flexibility, compromise and decisiveness. We also \r\nhope that it will generate the political will necessary to \r\nbring about a speedy reform of the Security Council in \r\naccordance with the vision of our leaders at the 2005 \r\nWorld Summit. \r\n Mr. Goddard (Barbados): I have the honour to \r\nspeak on behalf of the 14 States members of the \r\nCaribbean Community (CARICOM) that are Members \r\nof the United Nations: Antigua and Barbuda, the \r\nBahamas, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, \r\nGuyana, Haiti, Jamaica, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint \r\nLucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname, \r\nand Trinidad and Tobago. \r\n At the outset, CARICOM wishes to align itself \r\nwith the statements made by the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of the Arab Republic of Egypt on behalf \r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement and by the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Jamaica on behalf of the group of \r\nsponsors of draft resolution A/61/L.69/Rev.1. \r\n We also wish to place on record our appreciation \r\nto you, Mr. President, for your continued attention to \r\nthis matter, which is of high priority to a great number \r\n A/66/PV.51\r\n \r\n7 11-58384 \r\n \r\nof Member States, including those of CARICOM. We \r\nalso join previous speakers in commending His \r\nExcellency Ambassador Tanin, the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Afghanistan, on his role as Chair of \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations and we look \r\nforward to further progress in the negotiations during \r\nthe current session. \r\n In CARICOM’s view, a reformed Security \r\nCouncil would ideally have the following \r\ncharacteristics. First, it should provide for the equitable \r\nrepresentation of developing countries in terms of \r\nnumbers. \r\n Secondly, it should give continued and \r\nheightened priority to accommodating and responding \r\nto any complaint made by developing countries with \r\nregard to threats to their security. \r\n Thirdly, a reformed Security Council should \r\ncommand, to a greater and broader degree, the respect \r\nnecessary to be able to discharge its mandate for the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. \r\n Fourthly, it should be guided by working methods \r\nthat are demonstrably flexible and transparent. Member \r\nStates should have the right to participate in matters of \r\nwhich the Security Council is seized that have direct or \r\nindirect bearing on them. States wishing to express \r\nsolidarity should also be allowed to participate. \r\n Fifthly and finally, a reformed Security Council \r\nshould be more responsive and accountable to the \r\nentire membership, on whose behalf it acts. \r\n After almost two decades of discussions on the \r\nsubject of Security Council reform, it is understandable \r\nthat there is growing impatience for action, a desire for \r\nchange that refuses to be denied. We in CARICOM are \r\nstrongly of the view that the Council must be reformed. \r\nWe share the impatience. As small vulnerable States \r\nand strong proponents of multilateralism and the \r\nprinciple of the equality of States, we have reiterated \r\ntime and time again our principled position on this \r\nissue, a position endorsed by our Heads of State and \r\nGovernment and one which I now reaffirm. \r\n First, CARICOM supports the expansion of the \r\nSecurity Council in both the permanent and \r\nnon-permanent categories. We are of the view that \r\nexpansion should take particular account of those \r\nregions that are currently underrepresented or not \r\nrepresented at all, namely Africa, Asia, and Latin \r\nAmerica and the Caribbean. \r\n Secondly, we believe that special provision must \r\nbe made for small island developing States to serve on \r\nthe Council in the non-permanent category. Thirdly, we \r\nsupport the increase in the membership of a reformed \r\nCouncil from 15 to around the mid-twenties. Fourthly, \r\nwe support comprehensive improvement in the \r\nCouncil’s working methods, including in its \r\nrelationship with the General Assembly. \r\n Fifthly, we support abolition of the veto, an \r\nanachronism that has no place in a United Nations of \r\nthe twenty-first century. In our view, it undermines our \r\nefforts to make the Council more transparent, \r\naccountable and legitimate. As long as the veto is \r\nretained, however, we believe it should be extended to \r\nall new permanent members of the Council. \r\n In spite of CARICOM’s impatience for change, \r\nwe believe in due process. CARICOM looks forward to \r\nthe early resumption of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on Security Council reform and assures its \r\nChair of our full cooperation in carrying this process \r\nforward. CARICOM firmly rejects any notions of \r\npartial, interim or intermediate approaches to Security \r\nCouncil reform, which fail to address the compelling \r\nneed for comprehensive Council reform and ignore \r\ncontemporary global realities. In this as in all United \r\nNations matters, we continue to be guided by our deep \r\nrespect for the principles and the spirit of the Charter. \r\nAs an Organization comprising sovereign Member \r\nStates, we must practice the democracy and the \r\ntransparency that we preach. \r\n In closing, I reiterate CARICOM’s full support \r\nfor the intergovernmental negotiations on Security \r\nCouncil reform and our commitment to work with all \r\nMember States to bring about meaningful, democratic \r\nreform of the Security Council. CARICOM pledges to \r\ncontinue to be actively engaged in this process. \r\n Mr. Chua (Singapore): I have the honour to \r\ndeliver this statement on behalf of the group of five \r\nsmall nations (S-5), comprising Costa Rica, Jordan, \r\nLiechtenstein, Singapore and Switzerland. \r\n It has been more than two decades since the end \r\nof the Cold War, when talk of reforming the Security \r\nCouncil gathered pace. Since then, the United Nations \r\nmembership has increased by nearly 20 per cent, and \r\nthe complexities of maintaining international peace and \r\nsecurity have multiplied. The need for a more \r\nrepresentative and effective Council continues to grow. \r\nWe all risk irrelevance if the Council, a leading organ \r\nA/66/PV.51  \r\n \r\n11-58384 8 \r\n \r\nof the United Nations, does not evolve to reflect the \r\nrealities of the twenty-first century. \r\n It is difficult to strike a balance between \r\nrepresentation and efficacy. The protracted reform \r\nnegotiations attest to this. Seven rounds of \r\nintergovernmental negotiations have come and gone \r\nwithout any progress. Other initiatives, such as the \r\ninformal Group of Friends convened by the former \r\nPresident of the General Assembly, have not made \r\nheadway due to the lack of political will for reform. \r\nWe urge Ambassador Tanin to persevere. We also urge \r\nthe relevant parties to break the deadlock over other \r\nissues. \r\n We must remain steadfast in our efforts to agree \r\non a comprehensive reform of the Council, covering all \r\nfive aspects of the intergovernmental negotiations. It \r\nwill take considerable time to bridge the fundamental \r\ndivergences of opinion on the five areas of reform, but \r\nthat does not mean that nothing can be done now to \r\nmake the Council more inclusive, transparent, \r\naccountable and effective. Basic changes in the \r\nCouncil’s working methods would make a practical \r\ndifference and would substantially benefit all Member \r\nStates. They would make the Council more nimble in \r\nthe face of new and evolving realities. \r\n That is why the S-5 has consistently advocated \r\nimprovement in the Council’s working methods, \r\nindependently of and without prejudice to the other \r\naspects of Council reform. In the absence of agreement \r\non comprehensive Council reform, we should not shy \r\naway from picking the low-hanging fruit. We should \r\nnot let the perfect be the enemy of the good. \r\n The Council has taken some steps to improve its \r\nworking methods, which the S-5 welcomes and further \r\nencourages. The revised presidential note 507 issued \r\nby the Council last year (S/2010/507) indicates its \r\ncontinued willingness to make serious progress on \r\nworking methods. But these steps are not enough. The \r\ncurrent implementation of the measures contained in \r\nboth the original (S/2006/507) and the revised note 507 \r\nremains inconsistent and unsatisfactory. \r\n In this regard, the S-5 has circulated a text \r\nentitled “Improving the working methods of the \r\nSecurity Council” as a follow-up to the draft resolution \r\nthat we had issued in 2006. Our text sets out specific \r\nmeasures for the improvement of working methods, \r\nwhich the Council either should continue to implement \r\non a regular basis or could consider adopting.  \r\n We have held open consultations about the text \r\nand have taken on board many good suggestions from \r\nMember States. Our text puts forward suggestions on \r\nenhancing the relationship between the Council and the \r\nGeneral Assembly; evaluating outcomes of past \r\ndecisions and improving the drafting of mandates for \r\noperations to increase the Council’s effectiveness; \r\nincreasing the transparency of the work of subsidiary \r\nbodies and Member States’ involvement in those \r\nbodies; augmenting the Council’s governance and \r\naccountability; consulting more widely in appointing \r\nthe Secretary-General; and providing greater \r\ntransparency when the veto is exercised. We believe \r\nthat these proposals command the support of many \r\nMember States. \r\n The S-5 believes that the Security Council, as \r\nmaster of its own procedures, can take decisive steps to \r\ncontinue improving its working methods. We hope that \r\nthe members of the Council will seriously consider the \r\nsuggestions we have put forward in our text, and we \r\nstand ready to engage with them. The S-5 also looks \r\nforward to continuing engagement with the wider \r\nUnited Nations membership, not just on the text, but on \r\nthe improvement of the Council’s working methods in \r\ngeneral. \r\n Mr. Schaper (Netherlands): I have the pleasure \r\nto speak on behalf of Belgium and the Netherlands. \r\nOur subject today is Security Council reform — an \r\nimportant issue for sure, but at the same time one that \r\nhas been on the agenda of the General Assembly for a \r\nvery long time. \r\n Nearly 20 years ago, in a previous posting here in \r\nNew York in the mid-1990s, I represented my country \r\nin the ongoing discussion on Security Council reform \r\nthat was already taking place at that time. As is the \r\ncase at this moment, the issue that was discussed most \r\nof the time was the Council’s enlargement. The \r\ndifferent options for such an enlargement remain the \r\nsame. The ones that we discuss today are the same as \r\nwe discussed then: enlargement in both categories of \r\nCouncil membership, enlargement only in the category \r\nof non-permanent members, and some sort of \r\nintermediary solution. All those ideas were already on \r\nthe table nearly twenty years ago and all the arguments \r\nand considerations that were used then are still used \r\ntoday. \r\n But while most of the membership seems to agree \r\non the objective of a Security Council that reflects not \r\n A/66/PV.51\r\n \r\n9 11-58384 \r\n \r\nthe world of 1945 but the world of today, there is little \r\nagreement on the road to take to reach that goal. The \r\nnet result is that hardly any progress has been made in \r\nthe many, many years during which we have discussed \r\nthe question. \r\n Mr. Khazaee (Islamic Republic of Iran), Vice-\r\nPresident, took the Chair. \r\n In the view of Belgium and the Netherlands, this \r\ncannot go on. Here we have an issue on which the great \r\nmajority of the Member States declares time and again \r\nthat a solution needs to be found, but the same Member \r\nStates have been unable to come to an agreement for \r\ntwenty years now. That not only undermines the \r\nlegitimacy of the Security Council, it also undermines \r\nthe credibility of the United Nations as an institution \r\ncapable of solving problems and of acting efficiently. \r\n I was a bit surprised, I must say, when I heard in \r\nan earlier statement this afternoon a warning note that \r\nsaid, “no artificial deadlines”. I wonder whether that is \r\nreally one of the first concerns that should come to \r\nmind when one speaks about a process that has lasted \r\nnearly 20 years. The real issue is not the danger of \r\nartificial deadlines, but whether Member States have \r\nsufficient political will to start a process of real \r\nnegotiations. Over the past couple of years, Belgium \r\nand the Netherlands have tried to stimulate a full \r\ndiscussion among Member States about this issue, \r\namong other things, by making concrete suggestions \r\nfor a shorter and more focused text that could be the \r\nsubject of negotiations. I am sorry to say that those \r\nefforts have not yet led to the desired result, despite \r\nour efforts to illustrate that technical progress could \r\nindeed be made. \r\n Belgium and the Netherlands share the goal of the \r\nvast majority of the membership of the United Nations, \r\nnamely, to reform the Security Council in such a way \r\nthat it better reflects today’s geopolitical realities. That \r\nis a very legitimate request, if only because it has a \r\ndirect connection to the legitimacy of the Council. This \r\nis a time when we see emerging economies in different \r\nparts of the world that are ready to step up to the stage \r\nwith global ambitions and that are preparing to take on \r\nfuture global responsibilities. That has to be reflected \r\nin the composition of the world’s most important body \r\nin the field of peace and security — the Security \r\nCouncil. \r\n In the view of our two countries, the way forward \r\non this issue is first of all to agree that now is the time \r\nto start a serious process of negotiations on this issue. \r\nIf we cannot agree on this, then we can better spend \r\nour precious time on other pressing issues and put an \r\nend to this increasingly irrelevant process of \r\ncontinuously repeating well-known positions without \r\ncoming to grips with the real issues, the central issues.  \r\n Apart from that, we cannot expect the P-5 \r\nmembers of the Security Council to take this issue \r\nseriously as long as the membership does not start a \r\nprocess of real negotiations. In that sense, we have not \r\nso far given all five permanent members an incentive \r\nto play an active role, although some have been \r\nshowing a genuine interest in the issue. What we need \r\nnow is a concrete proposal, or even a couple of \r\nconcrete proposals, on the basis of which we can start \r\nour negotiations. \r\n At this moment, there is a very short proposal of \r\nthe Group of Four, kind of floating around in the \r\ncorridors of the General Assembly. That proposal has \r\nthe support of more than eighty Member States. So let \r\nus put it on the agenda and let us start a serious \r\ndiscussion about its contents and implications, in \r\nparticular about a moderate — at least, in the view of \r\nour countries it should be moderate — expansion of the \r\nSecurity Council in both categories of membership, \r\npermanent and non-permanent, an expansion that \r\nrespects the provisions necessary for an efficient and \r\neffective Security Council. Let us discuss for the first \r\ntime in depth the various aspects of that proposal, and \r\nsee whether the necessary support is really there. If \r\nthat does not work, let us see if there are any other \r\nproposals that we can discuss.  \r\n At this moment there are various groups with a \r\nstake in the discussion. We have the Group of Four, the \r\nUniting for Consensus group, the sponsors of draft \r\nresolution A/61/L.69/Rev.1, the African States and so \r\non. As we can read in the statement of the Group of \r\nFour ministers, they are prepared to take a flexible \r\napproach to this matter. I appeal to the representatives \r\nof other groups to do the same and also to show some \r\nflexibility. \r\n Like other countries, Belgium and the \r\nNetherlands do not formally belong to one of the \r\ngroups I just mentioned, but we are very much \r\ncommitted to finding a solution for the issue and we \r\nare willing to contribute constructively. Also in this \r\nregard, we are looking forward to hearing Ambassador \r\nA/66/PV.51  \r\n \r\n11-58384 10 \r\n \r\nTanin’s ideas and initiatives on how to move the \r\nprocess forward during this session of the Assembly. \r\n Finally, I want to thank Ambassador Tanin for his \r\ntireless efforts so far and his willingness to continue \r\nhis good work on this issue. I also want to thank the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly for his commitment \r\nto this issue and for the points he made earlier in his \r\nintroductory remarks, calling it one of the four \r\nimportant priorities of his presidency. I sincerely hope \r\nthat with sufficient political will, combined with a \r\nminimum of flexibility among the membership and \r\nwith the leadership of Ambassador Tanin and the \r\nAssembly President, we can make the necessary \r\nprogress on this issue in the Assembly’s sixty-sixth \r\nsession. \r\n Mr. Dua (India): I am honoured to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly on behalf of my country on the \r\nquestion of equitable representation on and increase in \r\nthe membership of the Security Council and related \r\nmatters. \r\n Let me place on record the Indian delegation’s \r\nappreciation for the commitment the President has \r\nshown towards this important issue. He explicitly \r\nreferred to it as one of the main priorities of his term. \r\nHe also moved swiftly to reappoint the highly \r\nexperienced and wise Ambassador Zahir Tanin of \r\nAfghanistan as chair of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations. We call upon Ambassador Tanin, through \r\nthe President, to convene a meeting of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations as soon as possible. \r\n We would also like to associate ourselves with \r\nthe statement delivered earlier by Ambassador \r\nRaymond Wolfe of Jamaica on behalf of the group of \r\nsponsors of draft resolution A/61/L.69/Rev.1. \r\n India played an important role in ensuring that \r\nthe process of intergovernmental negotiations on \r\nSecurity Council reform was initiated and has have \r\nplayed an active role in the deliberations ever since \r\ntheir commencement in 2009. We supported the start of \r\ntext-based negotiations in 2010 and have already stated \r\nour clear support for the third revision of the \r\nnegotiation text.  We feel that the logical next step \r\nis to narrow down the options in the third revision and \r\nmake it a two- to three-page document. \r\n India was among the originators of the initiative \r\non a short resolution launched earlier this year that \r\ncalled for reform that includes expansion in both the \r\npermanent and non-permanent categories of Security \r\nCouncil membership as well as improvement of its \r\nworking methods. The success of the ongoing initiative \r\nis clear from the fact that an overwhelming majority of \r\nMember States have expressed their firm support for \r\nthe initiative, including the more than eighty \r\ndelegations that have done so in writing. I would like \r\nto take this opportunity to thank delegations for their \r\nsupport. We believe that the strong support shown for \r\nan expansion of the Security Council in both the \r\npermanent and non-permanent membership categories \r\nand for an improvement of its working methods should \r\nbe considered as the basis for further discussion in the \r\nongoing intergovernmental negotiations. \r\n India is a member of the two groupings devoted \r\nto early reform of the Security Council, namely, the \r\nGroup of Four and the L.69 group. The positions of \r\nthose two groups have a number of elements in \r\ncommon with other groups and Member States that \r\nhave made proposals on the subject. During this \r\nAssembly session, we are keen to enhance our \r\nconvergences with other such like-minded groups, \r\nparticular the African Group, whose aspirations we \r\nsupport. \r\n In conclusion, let me reiterate that India is of the \r\nview that reform and expansion of the Security Council \r\nare essential if it is to reflect contemporary reality. \r\nSuch an outcome will enhance the Council’s credibility \r\nand effectiveness in dealing with global issues. Early \r\nreform of the Council must be pursued with renewed \r\nvigour and urgently enacted. Let me assure the \r\nPresident and the rest of the United Nations \r\nmembership of our willingness to remain constructive \r\non all issues on the table in the months to come. We \r\nurge other delegations to do likewise. \r\n Ms. Gankhuurai (Mongolia): As a member of \r\nthe group of sponsors of draft resolution \r\nA/61/L.69/Rev.1, my delegation aligns itself with the \r\nstatement made by the Permanent Representative of \r\nJamaica on behalf of that group. \r\n At a time of global uncertainty, the urgency of \r\nSecurity Council reform remains as compelling as ever. \r\nThe Council must reflect present-day political realities \r\nand become more broadly representative if it is to be \r\nviable and effective. \r\n Since 2009 Member States have been engaged in \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations established by the \r\nhistoric General Assembly decision 62/557. However, \r\n A/66/PV.51\r\n \r\n11 11-58384 \r\n \r\ngenuine negotiations are yet to start. While the third \r\nrevision of the negotiation text and the shorter \r\ndocument prepared by Ambassador Zahir Tanin could \r\nbe further improved, they provide a good basis for \r\ngenuine negotiations. We call for convening a meeting \r\nof the intergovernmental negotiations on Security \r\nCouncil reform as soon as possible. \r\n Mongolia’s stance on Security Council reform is \r\nwell known. Our position has been echoed in the \r\ninitiative on the draft resolution of the General \r\nAssembly to cut a decision on the categories of \r\nCouncil enlargement. Mongolia supports that initiative, \r\nas it aims to move the process forward. The \r\noverwhelming support for the initiative makes it \r\ncompelling to use it as the basis for further discussion \r\nin the ongoing intergovernmental negotiations. \r\n It is imperative that enlargement in the permanent \r\ncategory of the Security Council membership derive \r\nfrom the principles of justice and equality, reflect \r\ncontemporary world realities and ensure due \r\nrepresentation of developing and developed countries. \r\nEquitable geographical distribution is also essential, \r\nwith emphasis on the non- and underrepresented \r\ngroups, particularly Africa, Asia and the Latin \r\nAmerican and Caribbean Group. It is also critical to \r\nensure representation of small States in the Council. \r\n My delegation shares the view of the majority of \r\nMember States that the veto right needs to be abolished \r\neventually. In the meantime, its use should be \r\nrestricted, in particular by stipulating that the veto \r\nshould not be used under certain circumstances, such \r\nas genocide, crimes against humanity, serious \r\nviolations of international humanitarian law, war \r\ncrimes, ethnic cleansing and terrorism. As long as the \r\nveto right exists, it must be extended to new permanent \r\nmembers to avoid creating a third category of \r\nmembers, which could/would entail overruling \r\nArticle 23 of the Charter. It is imperative that new \r\npermanent members have the same rights and \r\nobligations as the current ones. \r\n My delegation has noted that the Security \r\nCouncil has continued to improve its working methods \r\nsince its last report (A/65/2). However, there is a \r\ncritical need for further improvement and the full \r\nimplementation of the note by the President of the \r\nCouncil in S/2010/507 in order to ensure transparency, \r\na high degree of accountability and enhanced \r\nparticipation of and access for non-Council members. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to commend the \r\nPresident for identifying United Nations reform and \r\nrevitalization, including Security Council reform, as \r\none of the four priority areas during the current session \r\nof the General Assembly. My delegation sincerely \r\nhopes that under his strong leadership, this session will \r\nachieve concrete progress on early reform of the \r\nSecurity Council. \r\n Mr. Ragaglini (Italy): I thank the President for \r\nconvening this meeting and for his well-known \r\ncommitment to advancing the Security Council reform \r\nprocess. In reappointing Ambassador Tanin as chair of \r\nthe informal negotiations, he “encouraged all Member \r\nStates to demonstrate a spirit of consensus, openness \r\nand good faith and participate actively in the upcoming \r\nround”. Italy identifies with his words, and, together \r\nwith its Uniting for Consensus partners, will be a \r\nconstructive force during this session. \r\n Today, I wish to focus on the recent past and the \r\nfuture. I am pleased to be doing so in a plenary \r\nmeeting — the first after a nine-month stalemate in the \r\nintergovernmental process. That deadlock is the recent \r\npast. Negotiations in the General Assembly were \r\nsuddenly broken off last March. Confidence-building \r\nwas abruptly interrupted by a partial and divisive \r\ninitiative launched by a few Member States. \r\nTransparency was lost. Confrontation made its way \r\nthrough New York and the capitals. A forceful rush \r\ntowards collecting support for an ambiguous and \r\noverly simplistic text put stress on the membership. \r\nWhile the Arab Spring was blossoming, Security \r\nCouncil reform was entering its fall.  \r\n Italy and its partners refused to accept that \r\ndevelopment. We started a dialogue with every single \r\nMember State. We were open, transparent and \r\nrespectful of what the Assembly decided by consensus \r\nat its sixty-second session. We wanted to continue \r\nnegotiations on all five pillars of the reform in a \r\ncomprehensive way, as mandated by Assembly \r\ndecision 62/557. We tried to rebuild confidence among \r\nthe groups. \r\n We were honest with our African friends. Aware \r\nof the historical injustice to the continent and \r\nconscious of the differences between our positions, we \r\ntried to build bridges and possible convergences. We \r\nmade clear that the African and Uniting for Consensus \r\npositions are compatible in many ways, most notably \r\nA/66/PV.51  \r\n \r\n11-58384 12 \r\n \r\non regional representation, seat allocation, rotation and \r\nconsensus. \r\n The dialogue ended up being held in Rome, \r\nwhere 123 countries met last May to launch an appeal \r\nto resume the intergovernmental negotiations in a spirit \r\nof compromise, openness and consensus. Mr. Al-Nasser’s \r\npredecessor, President Deiss, attended the meeting and \r\ntried to bring Member States back to the negotiating \r\ntable. Only then did the handful of States that had \r\npromoted the divisive initiative realize their failure and \r\nacknowledge that it had been rejected by the majority \r\nof the membership. \r\n The Uniting for Consensus group — this time in \r\nMexico City — tried once again to provide new \r\nimpetus to the negotiations in July. The goal was to \r\nbuild on the ashes of the confrontation and seek a \r\nserious compromise. Both the Rome and the Mexico \r\nCity meetings were attended by representatives of all \r\nnegotiating groups. Good faith and inclusiveness were \r\nthe basis of those attempts. \r\n Yet with summer and the end of the session \r\napproaching, the deadline passed and our work was \r\nrolled over into the sixty-sixth session, and we \r\ncommitted ourselves to an immediate resumption of the \r\nnegotiations. Today we are here to resume them. Today \r\nwe are here to rebuild the future of the Security \r\nCouncil reform process.  \r\n The lessons of the past should show us the way to \r\nthe future. Artificial acceleration blocks the process \r\nand cannot achieve the majority required by the \r\nCharter. The sixty-fifth session proved this once again. \r\nWe therefore need to focus on true flexibility and \r\npolitical will. I say this in the conviction that the \r\nUniting for Consensus group has already proved its \r\nwillingness to achieve reform, which will make the \r\nSecurity Council more democratic, representative, \r\naccountable and flexible so as to adapt to future \r\ninternational realities. \r\n We are the only group that entered the \r\nnegotiations with a new proposal. Our traditional \r\nposition envisaged an increase in the number of only \r\nthe two-year-term, non-permanent members; we \r\nchanged it in 2009. We now propose a solution \r\ninvolving longer-term seats, achievable through two \r\ndifferent options: short-term seats with immediate \r\nre-election, or long-term seats without immediate \r\nre-election. \r\n Our proposal is not, of course, a “take it or leave \r\nit” one. It is a step towards the middle of the aisle. The \r\nkey principles are compromise, accountability and \r\nconsensus. The key words are longer-term seats and \r\nre-election. \r\n We call on President Al-Nasser to exert moral \r\nsuasion on those Member States whose positions have \r\nnever changed. If the membership really believes in the \r\nneed for reform, it must be flexible and ready to \r\nnegotiate a compromise. Italy and its Uniting for \r\nConsensus partners are, as they have been in the past, \r\nready to engage constructively and in good faith. \r\n Mrs. Viotti (Brazil): The issue of Security \r\nCouncil reform is high on the agenda of the General \r\nAssembly. During the general debate last September, \r\nmore than 100 Member States mentioned in their \r\nstatements the need for the United Nations to adapt to \r\nnew political realities and embrace reform, including \r\nan enlargement of the Security Council. This is an \r\nimportant indication that the issue needs to be taken up \r\nas a matter of urgency. \r\n There is no doubt that Member States agree on \r\nthe need for the Security Council to be brought in line \r\nwith today’s political realities and thus become more \r\nrepresentative, legitimate, efficient and effective. The \r\nmajority view is that an expansion in the number of \r\nboth permanent and non-permanent seats is a necessary \r\nstep in that direction. \r\n The current permanent members are limited to \r\nthose in place at the end of the Second World War. If \r\nwe are serious about bringing the Security Council into \r\nthe twenty-first century, this state of affairs must be \r\nchanged. Any other option would leave the status quo \r\nuntouched and have an undesirable impact on the long-\r\nterm legitimacy and credibility of the body responsible \r\nfor the maintenance of international peace and security. \r\n In the same vein, for the Security Council to \r\nreflect the dramatic expansion of the United Nations \r\nmembership since 1945, more non-permanent seats are \r\nneeded, in particular for developing countries. \r\n Since earlier this year, we have been reaching out \r\nto other Member States to discuss the idea of a draft \r\nresolution aimed at opening the door to genuine reform \r\nand generating momentum for real negotiations to \r\nstart. The proposal we made was concise and \r\nstraightforward. It was a constructive attempt to \r\ncomplement and facilitate the ongoing process of \r\n A/66/PV.51\r\n \r\n13 11-58384 \r\n \r\nintergovernmental negotiations, launched by General \r\nAssembly decision 62/557, of 15 September 2008. \r\n From the very beginning, the initiative sought to \r\nrespond to the call of the facilitator, who had rightly \r\npointed out that Member States should take the lead \r\nand engage in consultations so as to inject dynamism \r\ninto the process. We were encouraged by the response \r\nreceived from the membership. The initiative has \r\ngarnered cross-regional support, including more than \r\n80 written expressions of support, in addition to a \r\nsubstantial number of strong verbal commitments, \r\nreaching well over 100 countries. No other proposal on \r\nthe table has to date been able to garner such high \r\nnumbers. \r\n This demonstrates quite clearly that a wide \r\ncoalition of Member States is willing to stand behind \r\nan expansion of the Security Council in both the \r\npermanent and non-permanent categories and an \r\nimprovement in its working methods. We believe that, \r\nshould this draft resolution be submitted and put to a \r\nvote, many more countries would join this collective \r\nendeavour to move the process forward. That is why \r\nwe believe that such strong support for the initiative \r\nshould be considered the basis for further discussion in \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations, which have our full \r\nsupport. \r\n If Member States keep their focus on this \r\ncommon goal, we can quickly move to the next stage, \r\ndiscuss the remaining issues and achieve successful \r\nreform without further delay. \r\n We welcome the decision of the President to \r\nreappoint His Excellency Ambassador Zahir Tanin, \r\nPermanent Representative of Afghanistan, as Chair of \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations. We look forward to \r\ncontinuing to work with him constructively with him in \r\nthe months ahead. \r\n Brazil will remain engaged and work closely in \r\nconsultation with other delegations, with a view to \r\ncreating an enabling environment for a concrete \r\noutcome at this session of the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Cassidy (Indonesia): On behalf of \r\nAmbassador Hasan Kleib, I wish to thank \r\nPresident Al-Nasser for having convened this meeting. \r\nWe would also like to congratulate Ambassador Tanin \r\non his reappointment, at the sixty-sixth session, as \r\nChair of the intergovernmental negotiations on the \r\nquestion of equitable representation on and increase in \r\nthe membership of Security Council and related \r\nmatters. \r\n Indonesia associates itself with the statement \r\nmade earlier in this meeting by the representative of \r\nEgypt on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement. \r\n The Charter goals of saving humanity from the \r\nscourge of war and promoting social progress and a \r\nbetter standard of life in larger freedom remain a \r\nprofound collective challenge. For the Security Council \r\nto play its crucial role, in the context of which support \r\nfrom all sides is key, it is critical that the Council be \r\ndemocratic, accountable and representative of all \r\nregions and civilizations. \r\n Indonesia thus fully supports a comprehensive \r\nand meaningful reform of the Security Council and \r\nmaintains that all five key reform issues should be \r\nnegotiated as an integral part of a comprehensive \r\npackage. \r\n As we deliberate here, it is worth recalling that \r\nCouncil reform has been discussed for more than \r\n16 years. Legitimate arguments by Member States have \r\nbeen expressed and reflected in the negotiating text of \r\nthe informal plenary process. Divisions continue to \r\nexist, however, and progress has been slow. Progress \r\nwill materialize when a formula for Council reform is \r\nfound that is acceptable to the widest majority of \r\ncountries. \r\n In connection with the categories of membership, \r\nIndonesia is among the countries that believe that an \r\nexpansion in both categories would offer the potential \r\nto address the fundamental shortcoming of the Council \r\nas it is currently constituted, namely, its lack of \r\nrepresentation. Yet it is our considered view that the \r\nmiddle ground that could garner the widest possible \r\npolitical acceptance on this critical issue and move \r\nthings forward is the intermediate approach, with a \r\nclear review mechanism occurring after the \r\nintermediate model has come into force. \r\n There are many variants on this approach. Our \r\nview is that the Assembly, at its current session, should \r\nexplore further the kind of intermediate approach that \r\nwe can agree on. There should be enough points of \r\nconvergence to ensure that the broadest majority sees \r\nthe outcome as being a win-win solution. In stating \r\nthis, we are certainly not ruling out the possibility of \r\nexpanding the permanent membership in the future. \r\nA/66/PV.51  \r\n \r\n11-58384 14 \r\n \r\nThat issue could be addressed in the examination of the \r\nreview concept as part of the intermediate approach. \r\n A piecemeal approach focusing on merely one or \r\ntwo key reform issues, however, risks accentuating \r\ndifferences and affecting the overall process in the \r\ninformal plenary of the General Assembly. Member \r\nStates reached an agreement on that process in \r\nconsensus decision 62/557, a decision that has been \r\nrenewed annually by the Assembly. It is important that \r\nwe abide by decision 62/557. Hence, all five key issues \r\nof Council reform should be considered in seeking a \r\nsolution that can garner the widest possible political \r\nacceptance, well beyond the two-thirds majority. \r\n Regarding the size of a reformed Council, we \r\nshould also take a middle-ground approach. A \r\nsuggestion at this stage is to expand the membership to \r\na size between the mid-20s and 31. We need to arrive \r\nat an agreed number that reflects the world’s plurality, \r\nwhich is the vast number of developing countries and \r\nregions, in a more balanced manner. The present \r\nunderrepresentation of Asia and Africa on the Council \r\nmust therefore be corrected. Asia and Africa should \r\neach be allocated at least four additional seats. In that \r\nregard, we also underscore the importance of regional \r\nand subregional representation. \r\n On the question of the veto, Indonesia believes \r\nthat the right of veto has no place in a world that is \r\nbecoming more democratic. Until the veto is abolished, \r\nwe will continue to support the principle that the veto \r\nright should not be exercised in cases involving \r\ngenocide and serious violations of international \r\nhumanitarian law. Indonesia does not support the \r\ncreation of any new veto rights, and interested \r\ncountries should consider this as a quid pro quo for \r\nlimiting and regulating the existing veto rights of the \r\nPermanent Five. \r\n Indonesia concurs with the views expressed by \r\nthe overwhelming majority that the Council’s working \r\nmethods should be improved by making the Council \r\nmore transparent, efficient, and accessible to the wider \r\nmembership. \r\n Article 31 and Article 32 of the United Nations \r\nCharter should be effectively implemented by \r\nconsulting with non-members of the Security Council \r\non a regular basis, especially members with a special \r\ninterest in the substantive matters under consideration \r\nby the Council. The Council should grant affected \r\nnon-members access to the Council’s subsidiary \r\norgans, including the right to participate and to provide \r\nsubstantive inputs. The Council should hold regular, \r\ntimely and meaningful consultations with troop- and \r\npolice-contributing countries, as well as with other \r\ncountries that are directly involved in, or affected by, a \r\ngiven peacekeeping operation, throughout all stages of \r\na mission. \r\n Without prejudice to Article 24 of the Charter, the \r\nreform should also explicitly clarify the functions and \r\npowers of the General Assembly on the issues of \r\ninternational peace and security, which are not \r\nregulated under Chapter V of the Charter in its present \r\nlanguage. In a scenario where the Council does not \r\ntake action on a case that is clearly threatening \r\ninternational peace and security, the Assembly should \r\nhave the power to make recommendations, even if the \r\nCouncil does not request it to do so. \r\n My delegation notes with appreciation \r\nAmbassador Tanin’s hard work in drawing up and \r\nupdating the negotiating text. While it provides a good \r\nbasis for further negotiations, no matter how hard we \r\ntry to fine-tune the text, any breakthrough in resolving \r\ndifferences will have to be made beyond the text. \r\n While the respective positions of Member States \r\nare dear to them, greater political flexibility will be \r\nrequired of all in order to move towards the points of \r\nconvergence. In our view, Council reform will be best \r\nachieved through a consensus-based formula or at \r\nleast, as we agreed, with the widest possible political \r\nacceptance. \r\n For its part, Indonesia remains determined to \r\nengage constructively with all countries to find ways to \r\nensure the tangible and comprehensive reform of the \r\nCouncil. \r\n Mr. Wittig (Germany): Today’s debate on \r\nSecurity Council reform provides a good opportunity \r\nto take stock and to further build on the momentum \r\nachieved during the preceding session of the General \r\nAssembly. In that regard, allow me to highlight the \r\nthree lessons learned from last year’s experience. \r\n First, we have made progress. I wish to highlight, \r\nin particular, that the process of intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations was renewed in an important session \r\nunder the able chairmanship of Ambassador Tanin. \r\nHowever, when it comes to the concrete and forward-\r\nlooking initiatives presented, one lesson is clear. One, \r\nand only one, concrete proposal has received the \r\n A/66/PV.51\r\n \r\n15 11-58384 \r\n \r\nsupport of a large majority of Member States from all \r\nregional groups. That was the initiative taken by the \r\nGroup of Four countries to increase the number of \r\npermanent and non-permanent seats on the Council and \r\nto improve its working methods. I daresay that, while \r\nthat initiative may not be the only game in town, it is \r\nsurely the strongest. It should thus also be at the centre \r\nof our discussions in the ongoing intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations process. \r\n Secondly, a number of meetings and conferences \r\non Security Council reform were held, both within and \r\noutside the United Nations, which clearly demonstrates \r\nthat Member States are eager to achieve progress on \r\nthat issue. However, if we want to ensure substantive \r\ndiscussions among the entire United Nations \r\nmembership, we need the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations to be held more frequently. We therefore \r\nurge the Chair of the informal intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on Security Council reform to resume \r\nthose negotiations as soon as possible and to maintain a \r\nregular meeting schedule. Also, should President Al-Nasser \r\ndeem any other format to be appropriate for achieving \r\nsubstantial results, we can assure you of our support. \r\n Thirdly, we all agree that the process of Council \r\nreform should be membership-driven. However, \r\nnegotiations during the last session of the General \r\nAssembly demonstrated that we cannot negotiate \r\nreform on the basis of a 30-page document. We will \r\nneed the assistance of Ambassador Tanin in focusing \r\nour discussions on a realistic range of options. As a \r\nfirst step, we suggest continuing discussions based on \r\nthose options that have been proven to reflect majority \r\npositions. Let us focus on those principles on which we \r\nhave reached broad agreement and use them as a \r\nstarting point to narrow our differences. \r\n In September, during the opening of the current \r\nGeneral Assembly session in New York, the majority of \r\nheads of delegation called for the United Nations \r\nsystem to be reformed. That includes a reform of the \r\nSecurity Council at its core. Reform is urgently \r\nneeded, not least because other institutions of global \r\ngovernance, such as the Group of Eight or the Group of \r\nTwenty, are gaining influence. The Security Council \r\nhas to adapt in order to remain the centrepiece of the \r\ninternational peace architecture in the twenty-first \r\ncentury. We must therefore redouble our efforts to \r\nachieve concrete outcomes during the current session \r\nof the General Assembly. My country, Germany, stands \r\nready to contribute its part. \r\n Mr. Wang Min (China) (spoke in Chinese): \r\nSecurity Council reform is an important part of the \r\nlarger reform process of the United Nations. China \r\nsupports a reasonable and necessary reform of the \r\nSecurity Council in order to increase its authority and \r\nefficiency and enable it to better fulfil the \r\nresponsibility of maintaining international peace and \r\nsecurity entrusted to it by the Charter of the United \r\nNations.  \r\n Security Council reform should give priority to \r\nincreasing the representation of developing countries, \r\nthose in Africa in particular. The reform should offer \r\ngreater opportunities to more countries, particularly \r\nsmall and medium-sized countries, to serve in the \r\nSecurity Council on a rotating basis in order to allow \r\nthem to participate in its decision-making process. \r\n The five clusters of core issues involving \r\nSecurity Council reform are interrelated. Reform \r\nshould strive to reach a package solution on these core \r\nissues. The artificial isolation of part of the \r\nintrinsically linked five clusters of issues or the \r\nadoption of a step-by-step or piecemeal approach will \r\nnot work.  \r\n Security Council reform involves the immediate \r\ninterests of all Member States. Reform requires \r\nin-depth participation by all Member States and \r\naccommodation of the interests and concerns of all \r\nparties in order to reach the widest possible consensus \r\nthrough extensive and democratic consultations.  \r\n As Member States may be seriously divided over \r\nthe core issues involving Security Council reform, they \r\nneed to remain engaged in dialogue, negotiations and \r\nconsultations. China is against setting an artificial time \r\nlimit for reform or pushing through any solution over \r\nwhich Member States still have serious disputes. \r\nGamesmanship or playing on words will lead us \r\nnowhere.  \r\n Since the launch of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on Security Council reform, Member \r\nStates have had serious discussions on the core issues \r\ninvolving reform of the Security Council, which has \r\ndeepened the mutual understanding of one another’s \r\npositions. The intergovernmental negotiations have \r\nemerged as a main channel for pursuing Security \r\nCouncil reform. Recent developments have shown that \r\nany acts that may undermine the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations are detrimental to the process of Security \r\nCouncil reform and do not serve the common interests \r\nA/66/PV.51  \r\n \r\n11-58384 16 \r\n \r\nof the Member States. Meanwhile, China opposes any \r\nattempt to create separate tracks beyond the framework \r\nof the intergovernmental negotiations.  \r\n China supports the decision to continue \r\nintergovernmental negotiations pursuant to General \r\nAssembly decision 62/557 at the current session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. The intergovernmental negotiations \r\nshould follow the principles of openness, inclusiveness \r\nand transparency and should be driven by Member \r\nStates, so as to arrive at a solution that promotes unity \r\namong Member States and serves their overall interests \r\nand the long-term interests of the United Nations. \r\nChina stands ready to support the work of \r\nMr. Al-Nasser, President of the General Assembly, and \r\nAmbassador Tanin, Facilitator of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations.  \r\n Mr. Briens (France) (spoke in French): The \r\nPresident of the General Assembly has made United \r\nNations reform into one of the priorities of his term in \r\noffice. In his inaugural speech, the focus was on the \r\nreform of the Security Council and on the need to \r\npursue the efforts made hitherto. He is quite correct; \r\nwe do need to continue move the process and \r\ninitiatives launched at the sixty-fifth session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly forward in to order to move beyond \r\nmere words, if we wish to see a Security Council that \r\nreflects to a greater extent today’s world — a Security \r\nCouncil that is adapted to new challenges and fully \r\ncapable of shouldering all of its responsibilities when \r\nconfronted with crises that threaten international peace \r\nand security. \r\n Much progress has been made since we began the \r\nintergovernmental negotiation process in 2009 led by \r\nAmbassador Tanin. That progress was made thanks to \r\nthe efforts of the facilitator, the successive Presidents \r\nof the General Assembly and the Member States. We \r\nhave succeeded in identifying elements of convergence \r\nthat we could explore further, for example, concerning \r\nenlargement of the Council in the two categories of \r\nmembership, permanent and non-permanent. We are \r\nduty-bound now to be bold and to move to the heart of \r\nthe matter. Out of respect for the work already \r\naccomplished, standing still or moving backwards is \r\nnot an option. \r\n The requirements are straightforward and \r\nunchanged. Reform of the Security Council must take \r\non board the emergence of new Powers that have the \r\nwill and the capacity to shoulder the responsibilities of \r\npermanent membership of the Security Council and \r\nwhich are, in conformity with the United Nations \r\nCharter, in a position to make an important \r\ncontribution to Council action in the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security.  \r\n In that context, France supports permanent \r\nmembership for Germany, Brazil, India and Japan, as \r\nwell as representation for the countries of Africa. The \r\nmatter of representation for the Arab countries is also \r\non the table. Beyond that, France’s position has not \r\nchanged. We stand ready, as do many States of \r\ngoodwill in this Assembly, to work actively to break \r\nthe deadlock and overcome the principled positions. \r\nThat could involve considering an interim solution in \r\naccordance with a proposal that was made jointly three \r\nyears ago by the President of the French Republic and \r\nthe Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. The \r\nmodalities and parameters of that solution are not set in \r\nstone or predetermined; they must result from \r\nnegotiations among the Member States. \r\n The reform must not be allowed to fall off our \r\npriority agenda, because if it does, it will stay off it \r\nindefinitely. Alongside the Chair of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform, it is within the powers of the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly to give new impetus to the \r\ndiscussions. Getting Member States to negotiate in a \r\ngenuine manner is a matter of shared political will. The \r\nguidelines that the President of the General Assembly \r\ngives us will be crucial to that end. Far-reaching \r\nreform of the Security Council, which could take place \r\nafter a transition period, will require audacity and \r\nperseverance. France stands ready to make our \r\ncontribution and provide our support to this objective. \r\n Mr. Oyarzun (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): We \r\nhave been mandated by the General Assembly to \r\nimmediately continue intergovernmental negotiations \r\non the reform of the Security Council. I am referring to \r\ndecision 65/554 adopted by consensus on \r\n12 September. I am afraid that the task will not be an \r\neasy one. Allow me to explain why. \r\n It is a fact that negotiations are now at a \r\nstandstill. The seventh round of negotiations took place \r\non 2 March, and since then no other meeting has taken \r\nplace. Eight months have already gone by. \r\n From our point of view, there are two primary \r\nreasons for the current impasse — on the one hand, the \r\nrejection of the third revision of the negotiating text by \r\n A/66/PV.51\r\n \r\n17 11-58384 \r\n \r\nsome of the groups and countries present at that \r\nmeeting, and on the other hand, the launching of \r\ndivisive initiatives by some other groups, in an attempt \r\nto take advantage of the impasse exclusively for their \r\nown gain. \r\n I have called those initiatives “divisive” for the \r\nfollowing reasons. First of all, the initiatives were \r\nlaunched outside of the negotiations. They were \r\ntherefore not open, inclusive and transparent, as \r\nrequired by decision 62/557. Secondly, they did not \r\ninclude each and every one of the five key issues of the \r\nreform, but only those that fit the promoters’ own \r\ninterests. The result is quite clear; the stalemate has \r\nonly become more entrenched. This is the situation in \r\nwhich we find ourselves. I am quite sure that we all \r\nagree that it is urgent that we put an end to the present \r\nsituation. \r\n We believe that it is the role of the President, as \r\nwell as Ambassador Tanin’s — whom we congratulate \r\nfor his confirmation as Chair of the negotiations — to \r\nmake a concrete proposal to that effect. \r\n In our opinion, the starting point should be the \r\ntwo main lessons we learned during the previous \r\nsession. First of all, we should recognize that the third \r\nrevision of the negotiating text has not been accepted \r\nby all on a consensual basis and that, consequently, it \r\nshould be revised again. Otherwise, we believe that we \r\nhave no alternative but to go back to the second \r\nrevision of the text, the only one endorsed by all \r\ngroups and countries. \r\n Secondly, we should acknowledge that we cannot \r\nunilaterally change the rules set by resolution 62/557 in \r\nthe middle of the game. \r\n The President can count on the full support of the \r\nSpanish delegation in this matter. I think we have given \r\nsufficient proof of our flexibility and constructive \r\nspirit. Obviously, the President can also count on the \r\nfull support of the Uniting for Consensus group, to \r\nwhich we belong. I would like to bring to the \r\nAssembly’s attention the fact that the Uniting for \r\nConsensus group continues to be the only one so far to \r\nhave presented an alternative model of its original \r\nposition. It was presented in April 2009, during the \r\nfirst round of negotiations, as the representative of \r\nItaly has pointed out. \r\n That model contains some elements of the \r\nso-called intermediate model, such as the creation of a \r\nnew or intermediate category of non-permanent \r\nmembers with longer-term seats. I would like to clarify \r\nthat the model was presented with the expectation of \r\nreciprocity on the part of other groups, an expectation \r\nthat has, unfortunately, not been fulfilled. For that \r\nreason, the position of Spain and the Uniting for \r\nConsensus group continues to be the original one that \r\nwe presented in 2005. It is a comprehensive model \r\nwith realistic proposals for each of the five key issues \r\nregarding Security Council reform: categories and \r\nveto, size, regional representation, working methods \r\nand the relationship between the Security Council and \r\nthe General Assembly. \r\n It is a well-known fact that one of its main \r\ncharacteristics is a provision to enlarge the Council \r\nexclusively in the category of non-permanent members. \r\nWe firmly believe that only an expansion in the number \r\nof elected seats can ensure the preservation of the \r\ndemocratic principle that should lie at the heart of the \r\nlegitimacy of any Security Council reform. \r\n During the 2005 World Summit, we committed \r\nourselves to an early reform of the Security Council, \r\nincluding its working methods, to make it more \r\neffective, efficient, transparent, representative and \r\nlegitimate. We committed ourselves to increasing the \r\ninvolvement of States that are not members of the \r\nCouncil and to improving its accountability. Six years \r\nhave passed since then. We have made progress, but \r\nnot enough. \r\n We believe that the time has come to make \r\nheadway in a more decisive way towards a compromise \r\nsolution, the only one in our opinion that can be \r\nadopted by consensus. To that end, perhaps we can be \r\nguided by the five principles presented by the President \r\nof the previous session, Mr. Deiss, to whom we pay \r\ntribute, during the Rome ministerial conference on \r\nglobal governance and Security Council reform, held \r\non 16 May of this year. Those principles are the \r\nbroadest possible support, respect for the fundamental \r\nvalues of the United Nations, simplicity, efficiency and \r\nflexibility. \r\n To conclude, I would like to reiterate the \r\ndetermination of the Spanish delegation to work with a \r\nspirit of flexibility and constructiveness towards this \r\nobjective. \r\n Mr. Alcántara Mejía (Dominican Republic) \r\n(spoke in Spanish): We welcome the sense of urgency \r\nwith which the President has dealt with the topic of \r\nA/66/PV.51  \r\n \r\n11-58384 18 \r\n \r\nequitable representation on the Security Council, the \r\nincrease in its membership and other related issues. We \r\nlikewise welcome the fact that the President has \r\nconfirmed the Permanent Representative of \r\nAfghanistan, Ambassador Zahir Tanin, as chair of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform. We value the effort and leadership that \r\nAmbassador Tanin has shown over many years on this \r\ncomplex question. \r\n The Dominican Republic would like to state right \r\naway that we support the statement made by the \r\nrepresentative of Egypt on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement. \r\n Security Council reform is a topic that has been \r\non the Organization’s agenda for 18 years. We are \r\nstruck by the fact that we have still been unable to \r\nachieve conclusive results. If we were to take this \r\nsituation as an example of the way we work in this \r\nhouse, it would clearly serve as a very bad example. \r\nAnd if the outcome of this exercise had been crucial \r\nfor halting an international conflict, we would have had \r\na disaster on our hands a long time ago. \r\n The Dominican Republic would like to stress its \r\ncommitment to cooperating constructively with the \r\nother delegations to reform the Council to bring that \r\nimportant organ into line with today’s geopolitical \r\nrealities, and also to make it more efficient in its task \r\nof maintaining international peace and security. The \r\nworld of 2011 is very different from the one of 1963, \r\nwhen the number of members on the Council rose from \r\n11 to 15. At that time there were 115 Member States; \r\ntoday our number has risen to 193. \r\n A reformed Council would enjoy greater \r\ncredibility and authority to address the challenges we \r\nface in the international arena. Those are challenges \r\nthat require structural reform, including an increase in \r\nthe number of members and their categories, the \r\nCouncil’s working methods, the veto, the nature of \r\nrepresentation and the relationship of the Council to \r\nother United Nations organs such as the General \r\nAssembly and the Economic and Social Council. \r\n However, for the Dominican Republic, given the \r\ntime that has gone by and the meagre results that have \r\nbeen achieved, it would make sense to speed up our \r\nconversations on Security Council reform and to focus \r\nthem on two fundamental issues: the increase in the \r\nnumber of members and their categories, and the \r\nCouncil’s working methods. Put to the test, such a plan \r\nwould enhance this Organization’s credibility and its \r\nability to fulfil the goals set forth in the Charter. In \r\naddition, we would be complying with a request for \r\nreform that has been consistently demanded by the \r\nmajority of the Member States.  \r\n My country has always advocated a fair and \r\nequitable expansion of the Security Council that would \r\nincrease the total number of permanent and \r\nnon-permanent members and that would guarantee the \r\nproper representation of developing countries. To \r\ncorrect the prevailing lack of equity on the Council, we \r\nwould hope for an increase in members coming from \r\nsuch under-represented regions as Africa, Asia, and \r\nLatin America and the Caribbean. \r\n There have been a few significant improvements \r\nto the Council’s working methods and procedures. \r\nHowever, both accountability and transparency need to \r\nbe enhanced, and the Council’s operation needs to be \r\nmade more inclusive in order to strengthen its \r\nlegitimacy and effectiveness. We support an increase in \r\nthe number of public debates and interactive \r\ninformation sessions as a standard that would benefit \r\nStates not members of that body.  \r\n We have focused on those two aspects of reform \r\nbecause we must prioritize the objectives of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on a basis that ensures \r\nthat the Security Council’s decision-making ability is \r\nstrengthened through efficiency and a fair and \r\nequitable representation.  \r\n That is why have joined the coalition of countries \r\npromoting a draft resolution aimed at achieving a \r\nSecurity Council that is broader, acts with greater \r\nauthority, greater unity and greater credibility and \r\noperates in a more democratic manner. The initiative \r\nincludes the proposals and positions that have largely \r\nbeen accepted by the Member States, regional groups \r\nand other groupings that have taken part in the Security \r\nCouncil reform process over the years.  \r\n The Dominican Republic is convinced that the \r\nchallenges of today’s world require a United Nations \r\nsystem that is more robust, more representative and \r\nmore effective, including the Security Council. That \r\ntask was entrusted to us by our political leaders at the \r\n2005 World Summit. My delegation is ready to work \r\ntowards that objective with the greatest flexibility, \r\ncompromise and political will, because we believe that \r\nthose conditions will be essential to be able to move \r\n A/66/PV.51\r\n \r\n19 11-58384 \r\n \r\nforward and to obtain specific results in the debates on \r\nSecurity Council reform. \r\n Mr. Nishida (Japan): I would like to thank the \r\nPresident for convening today’s plenary meeting to \r\ndiscuss Security Council reform. Japan highly \r\nappreciates his identification of United Nations reform \r\nand revitalization as one of the four priority areas of \r\nthe sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly. As he \r\npointed out, in order for the Organization to remain \r\nlegitimate it is important that there is strong political \r\nwill to realize previous resolutions and decisions. In \r\nthat regard, early reform of the Security Council is \r\ntruly needed. \r\n I would also like to commend the President’s \r\nswift reappointment of Ambassador Tanin as the chair \r\nof the intergovernmental negotiations. We fully trust \r\nthat he and Ambassador Tanin will exercise proactive \r\nleadership in order to promote substantive and \r\nmeaningful discussions among Member States. \r\n Various efforts have been made to reform the \r\nSecurity Council so that it better reflects the realities of \r\nthe twenty-first century, and not the world of 60 years \r\nago. I believe that all Member States are committed to \r\nrealizing early reform so that the United Nations can \r\naddress present challenges with greater \r\nrepresentativeness, legitimacy and effectiveness.  \r\n In the Assembly’s prior session, the Group of \r\nFour (G-4) took the initiative to propose a draft \r\nresolution on reform, and other Member States were \r\nalso actively engaged in serious discussion of the issue, \r\nthus creating strong momentum towards real \r\nnegotiations.  \r\n On the basis of the progress achieved at the last \r\nsession, we must take the next step towards achieving a \r\nconcrete outcome. Although there remains a wide \r\ndifference in views among Member States, I believe \r\nthat all are now ready to begin substantive negotiations \r\naimed at finding a solution that can accommodate \r\ndifferent views and garner the widest possible political \r\nacceptance, as required by previous decisions of the \r\nAssembly. To that end, we hope to see a spirit of \r\nflexibility demonstrated by every Member State for the \r\npurpose of beginning constructive, results-oriented \r\ndiscussions on the way forward. \r\n We fully share the President’s view that the \r\ncollective political will of the membership is necessary \r\nto advance our efforts to reform the Security Council. \r\nThe G-4 Foreign Ministers met in New York on \r\n23 September and expressed their determination to \r\nwork in close cooperation with other Member States in \r\na spirit of flexibility and to press ahead with all steps \r\nnecessary to achieve a concrete outcome in the current \r\nsession.  \r\n With regard to the draft resolution on expansion \r\nof the Council in both the permanent and \r\nnon-permanent categories and on improvement of its \r\nworking methods, the Ministers expressed the view \r\nthat the strong support extended to the initiative should \r\nbe considered as a basis for further discussion in the \r\nongoing intergovernmental negotiations. \r\n All Member States must proactively commit to \r\nthe reform effort and take steps to accelerate the \r\nprocess with a sense of urgency. Japan, for its part, is \r\nsparing no effort to promote substantive discussions \r\nwith like-minded countries, in a spirit of openness, \r\ntransparency, honesty and realism.  \r\n In that regard, I take the opportunity to mention \r\ntoday that the Japanese Government is organizing a \r\ndialogue in Tokyo on Security Council reform, to be \r\nheld on 14 November. Our goal is to open a new \r\nchapter on an honest, open and substantive dialogue, \r\nwhich is essential in order to explore achievable \r\nreform. Japan would highly appreciate the participation \r\nof the President of the General Assembly in that \r\nmeeting. It is our hope that the dialogue will stimulate \r\nfruitful discussions, in continuity with previous efforts, \r\nto generate further dynamism for meaningful progress. \r\nWe are ready to share the results with all interested \r\nMember States. \r\n Now is the time to take concrete action. Japan \r\nwelcomes the next round of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations, to be held at the end of this month, and \r\nhopes that the Tokyo dialogue will add impetus to the \r\ndiscussions in the negotiations. We strongly wish to see \r\nmore frequent and substantive negotiations and \r\nwelcome any initiative from Member States that can \r\ngenerate momentum towards a real solution. In that \r\nregard, we believe that the streamlining of the third \r\nrevision of the negotiation text to include narrowed-\r\ndown options would help in moving the negotiation \r\nprocess forward. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to reiterate once again \r\nJapan’s firm commitment to exert all efforts to achieve \r\na concrete reform outcome during the present session, \r\nA/66/PV.51  \r\n \r\n11-58384 20 \r\n \r\nin close cooperation with the President, Ambassador \r\nTanin and all Member States. \r\n Mr. Benmehidi (Algeria): At the outset I would \r\nlike to express our appreciation to the facilitator of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations, the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Afghanistan, Ambassador Zahir \r\nTanin, for his tireless efforts to advance the process of \r\nSecurity Council reform, and I wish to congratulate \r\nhim on his reappointment for the current session. My \r\ndelegation remains committed to the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations process, which is the appropriate and only \r\nframework in which Security Council reform should be \r\ndiscussed, as mandated by the General Assembly. \r\n Algeria aligns itself with the statements made \r\nearlier by the Permanent Representative of Egypt on \r\nbehalf of the Non-Aligned Movement and by the \r\nPermanent Representative of Sierra Leone on behalf of \r\nthe African Group. \r\n Algeria reiterates its commitment to the \r\naspirations of Africa as contained in the Ezulwini \r\nConsensus and the Sirte Declaration, asking for no \r\nfewer than two permanent seats for Africa with all \r\nrights and prerogatives related to that category of \r\nmembership, including the veto, as well as two \r\nadditional non-permanent seats. In our view, \r\nenlargement in both the permanent and non-permanent \r\ncategories should be understood in accordance with the \r\nprovisions of the Charter and should include the veto. \r\nThat position aims at correcting the historical injustice \r\nthat makes Africa the only continent that is not \r\nrepresented in the permanent category. \r\n Algeria is ready to work constructively for \r\nsubstantive progress in the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations within a transparent and inclusive process \r\nand in a spirit of consensus-reaching. It is important to \r\nnote the comprehensive nature of Security Council \r\nreform and that all its themes and elements are \r\ninterrelated and cannot be addressed in an isolated \r\nmanner. In that regard, the Council’s working methods \r\nshould receive equal attention and should be treated in \r\nan approach integrating the other clusters. \r\n Algeria is ready to consider the third revision of \r\nthe compilation text as the basis for the negotiations, \r\nprovided that such consideration is done in the spirit of \r\ndecision 62/557 and subsequent General Assembly \r\nresolutions. However, we continue to believe that that \r\ndocument requires further elaboration in order to \r\nreflect all positions and proposals. The Member States \r\nshould work together to agree on a set of principles \r\nbefore streamlining the compilation text and narrowing \r\ndown positions in all their aspects. Algeria is of the \r\nview that once an agreement on a set of principles is \r\nreached, it will become much easier to identify the \r\nmany areas of convergence that exist between the \r\ndifferent proposals and positions. \r\n Mr. Kim Sook (Republic of Korea): First of all, I \r\nwould like to take this opportunity to once again \r\nconvey to the President my Government’s sincere wish \r\nfor his successful presidency. I would also like to thank \r\nthe current President of the Security Council, His \r\nExcellency Ambassador Moraes Cabral of Portugal, for \r\nhis introduction of the report of the Security Council \r\n(A/66/2) earlier this morning.  \r\n I wish to express my delegation’s appreciation for \r\nthe extensive work carried out by the Council during \r\nthe reporting period. In particular, it should not be \r\nforgotten that the Council made a very meaningful and \r\nhistoric contribution to the democratization process in \r\nthe Middle East during the tumultuous period that \r\nbegan late last year. \r\n Let me start by mentioning that the Republic of \r\nKorea has constructively taken part in the ongoing \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform during the past few years. As a member of the \r\nUniting for Consensus group, I would like to highlight \r\nthat we were the only group to exercise flexibility by \r\nmodifying our initial stance of 2005. That step was a \r\ngenuine effort to bridge the gap in the differences of \r\nopinions and perspectives among the major groups \r\nwith a view towards making the Council more \r\ndemocratic, representative and accountable. \r\n Unfortunately, however, the Uniting for \r\nConsensus group’s sincere efforts to reach some form \r\nof common ground have not been reciprocated. Instead, \r\nduring the last session of the General Assembly, there \r\nwas a unilateral initiative outside the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations framework. As a result, \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations were on hiatus. The \r\nentire membership suffers the consequences of that \r\ninaction. \r\n The current structure of the Security Council is \r\nthe outcome of a war that ended 66 years ago. \r\nObviously, the Council does not adequately reflect the \r\ncurrent environment surrounding the state of \r\ninternational affairs, nor does it duly reflect the \r\ncapacities of its relevant actors. \r\n A/66/PV.51\r\n \r\n21 11-58384 \r\n \r\n However, that simple truth cannot be the grounds \r\nfor causing even more injustice by adding a handful of \r\npermanent members to remain on the Council \r\nindefinitely, thereby turning a blind eye to the needs \r\nand wishes of the greater membership. If we were to \r\ncommit ourselves to the rigidity of having additional \r\npermanent members, we would lose the flexibility and \r\nlegitimacy necessary to adapt to the changing political \r\nand economic landscape of the future. \r\n Against that backdrop, I would like to emphasize \r\nthat the only reasonable way to bring about a more \r\naccountable, transparent and efficient Security Council \r\nis to hold periodic elections. Only through periodic \r\nelections for an enlarged Council of a reasonable size \r\nwill we be able to attain a more democratic and \r\nequitable representation. Only then will the members \r\nof the Council be subject to performance and \r\ncontribution reviews to determine if an additional term \r\nis warranted for a given member. \r\n My delegation strongly believes that the most \r\ntangible way to break the current deadlock in these \r\nnegotiations would be to reach some sort of middle \r\nground through an intermediate solution. We have been \r\nflexible in the past and we are willing to work \r\nconstructively with the greater membership in the \r\nfuture as well to further flesh out the details of this \r\napproach. \r\n The Republic of Korea, as a democratic \r\nmid-power State, like most of the Uniting for \r\nConsensus members, genuinely looks forward to \r\nreasonable, simple and realistic yet durable and \r\njustifiable Security Council reform. Looking back, the \r\nmost serious obstacle on the road to reform has been \r\nthe lack of trust and of willingness to compromise. The \r\nprocess has at times been frustrating. However, this \r\nissue is too important for inaction. Indeed, we have a \r\ncollective duty to achieve this crucial task not only for \r\nthe United Nations, but also for future generations. \r\n My delegation is convinced that there have been \r\nconvergences in other key areas, such as the idea of \r\nincreasing the size of the Security Council to the low to \r\nmid-twenties, more reasonable exercise of the veto, \r\nbetter representation by underrepresented regional \r\ngroups, stronger relations between the General \r\nAssembly and the Security Council, and ameliorating \r\nthe Council’s working methods. Again, my delegation \r\nhopes that those ideas can be realized and finalized \r\nunder the framework of an intermediate approach. \r\n It is our understanding that the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations will finally be resumed in the coming \r\nweeks. We look forward to the impartial stewardship of \r\nthe chair, Ambassador Tanin, so that notable progress \r\ncan be made during the Assembly’s current session. \r\n For our part, the Government of the Republic of \r\nKorea will continue to make constructive efforts to \r\nrealize the goal of establishing a more accountable, \r\nefficient and democratic Security Council. \r\n Mr. AlJarallah (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): I \r\nwould like to begin by thanking the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Portugal, current President of the \r\nSecurity Council, for his introduction of the report of \r\nthe Security Council on its activities during the past \r\nyear (A/66/2) to the General Assembly. The report \r\nshows a significant increase in the workload of the \r\nCouncil. \r\n My delegation warmly congratulates the new \r\nnon-permanent members of the Security Council — \r\nAzerbaijan, Guatemala, Morocco, Pakistan and \r\nTogo — on their election to the Council for the period \r\nof 2012 and 2013.  \r\n My delegation associates itself with the statement \r\ndelivered earlier by the representative of Egypt on \r\nbehalf of the Non-Aligned Movement.  \r\n We welcome and support the efforts of \r\nAmbassador Tanin, who has been leading the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on the reform of the \r\nSecurity Council. We hope that at the current session \r\nwe will achieve progress in this matter and that we will \r\nsee the long-awaited historic agreement that will fulfil \r\nour aspirations on revitalizing the Council and \r\nimproving its working methods. \r\n It is perfectly natural that the question of \r\nequitable representation on and increase in the \r\nmembership of the Security Council and related \r\nmatters should be considered one of the most important \r\nagenda items. In fact, a firm and critical decision is \r\nnecessary, today, in order to promote Security Council \r\nreform. Despite the consensus of Member States on the \r\nprinciple of reform and change, we have remained \r\nincapable of carrying out the basic steps for such \r\nnecessary change.  \r\n My delegation reaffirms the importance of the \r\nproposals on expanding and reforming the Council \r\ngarnering the support of all the Member States. \r\nNineteen years have passed since the start of \r\nA/66/PV.51  \r\n \r\n11-58384 22 \r\n \r\nnegotiations on expanding the Council and improving \r\nits working methods, and several initiatives and ideas \r\nhave been submitted. However, the issue remains \r\nhindered, and thus political will is required to find \r\ncommon ground on the issues and achieve the expected \r\nobjective.  \r\n The recurrent challenges in the international \r\nsphere impel us to make an even greater effort to \r\nimprove the negotiations. We must reaffirm our support \r\nto that collective work whose noble final objective \r\ninvolves the entire international community. \r\n The position of the State of Kuwait has remained \r\nfirm and unchanged in recent years and is based on the \r\nfollowing elements.  \r\n First, the issue of Security Council reform must \r\nbe part of a comprehensive vision aimed at reforming \r\nthe Council and improving all United Nations bodies. \r\nWe must support integrated and balanced work in the \r\nCouncil and focus on improving the relationship \r\nbetween it and other main United Nations bodies, such \r\nas the General Assembly and the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil. We must avoid any interference in or \r\nencroachment on the prerogatives of the General \r\nAssembly, and the Security Council must stress its \r\nmain function, according to the Charter, of the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.  \r\n Secondly, any possible reform of the Council \r\nmust result in its increased representativeness and must \r\nreflect the current international situation, which has \r\ndrastically changed since 1945. \r\n Thirdly, it is extremely important to improve the \r\nCouncil’s working methods. We must improve its \r\ntransparency and develop formal and regular \r\nprocedures in order to improve and organize its \r\nworking methods. \r\n Fourthly, the veto must be subject to certain \r\nlimits and controls to ration its use, perhaps under the \r\nframework of issues arising under Chapter VII of the \r\nCharter.  \r\n Fifthly, increasing the number of seats in the \r\nCouncil must provide an opportunity for small States to \r\njoin the Council and take part in its work. My \r\ndelegation would also stress the right of Arab States \r\nand Muslim States to representation, in line with their \r\nimportance and their contribution to defending the \r\nprinciples and purposes of the Charter. \r\n The complex and urgent challenges and issues \r\nfacing the international community should encourage \r\nour increased determination in stepping up efforts to \r\nstrengthen and revitalize the Council’s role and thus \r\nenable it to deal effectively with those challenges. The \r\nCouncil must bolster representation and enhance \r\ntransparency in order to strengthen both its neutrality \r\nand credibility. \r\n Mrs. DiCarlo (United States of America): The \r\nUnited States warmly welcomes the reappointment of \r\nAmbassador Tanin to chair the forthcoming rounds of \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform, and we thank him for his efforts to guide these \r\nnegotiations forward.  \r\n Allow me to reiterate our full support to \r\nAmbassador Tanin as we head into the eighth round of \r\nnegotiations, which we hope Member States will \r\napproach with flexibility and patience. We believe that \r\nintergovernmental negotiations offer the most \r\ntransparent and inclusive forum for these discussions to \r\nproduce an outcome that enjoys broad consensus. \r\nWhile genuine disagreements remain, we hope that \r\nthese talks will ultimately serve to bring the \r\nmembership of the United Nations together.  \r\n The United States believes that the Security \r\nCouncil should reflect the world of the twenty-first \r\ncentury. We support expansion of the Council in a way \r\nthat will diminish neither its effectiveness nor its \r\nefficiency. Therefore, my delegation will continue to \r\nmake a serious, deliberate effort, working with other \r\nMember States, to enhance the Council’s ability to \r\ncarry out its mandate and effectively meet the \r\nchallenges of this century.  \r\n Allow me to highlight our position on the key \r\nissues related to Council reform.  \r\n The United States is open, in principle, to a \r\nmodest expansion of both permanent and \r\nnon-permanent members. We strongly believe that any \r\nconsideration of an expansion of permanent members \r\nmust be country-specific in nature. In assessing which \r\ncountries merit permanent membership, the United \r\nStates will take into account the ability of countries to \r\ncontribute to the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security and to other purposes of the United \r\nNations.  \r\n We support a Security Council membership that \r\nupholds human rights, democracy and the rule of law at \r\n A/66/PV.51\r\n \r\n23 11-58384 \r\n \r\nhome and abroad and that makes significant \r\ncontributions to the implementation of Council \r\ndecisions, especially through their enforcement, as well \r\nas through financial, personnel and political support.  \r\n The United States is not open to an enlargement \r\nof the Council that changes the current veto structure. \r\n We remain committed to a serious, deliberate \r\neffort, working with other Member States, to find a \r\nway forward that both adapts the Council to current \r\nglobal realities and enhances its ability to carry out its \r\nmandate effectively and to meet the challenges of the \r\ncentury. \r\n Mr. Valero Briceño (Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela) (spoke in Spanish): The Bolivarian \r\nRepublic of Venezuela associates itself with the \r\nstatement made by the representative of Egypt on \r\nbehalf of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries.  \r\n We wish to acknowledge here the complex work \r\ncarried out by Ambassador Zahir Tanin, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Afghanistan, and his efforts to move \r\nforward in the intergovernmental negotiations on the \r\nquestion of equitable representation on and increase in \r\nthe membership of the Security Council and related \r\nmatters. We also welcome the statement made by the \r\nPermanent Representative of Jamaica, Mr. Raymond \r\nWolfe, who spoke on behalf of the countries that \r\nsponsored draft resolution A/61/L.69/Rev.1. \r\n Although the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela \r\nhas already, on various occasions, presented its \r\nposition on the subject we are discussing today, we \r\nwould like to reiterate a few points.  \r\n We support the enlargement of the permanent and \r\nnon-permanent member categories of the Security \r\nCouncil in order to ensure the inclusion of developing \r\ncountries from the regions of Africa, Asia, and Latin \r\nAmerica and the Caribbean. A Security Council \r\nenlarged on the basis of an acceptable numerical \r\nformula could comprise 25 or 26 members. It would \r\ngive greater representative balance to the body by \r\nincorporating the various geographic, political and \r\ncultural realities from the developing world.  \r\n The peoples and countries of Africa, Latin \r\nAmerica and the Caribbean, and Asia have been \r\ndeprived for more than 60 years of the right to exercise \r\nthat responsibility. We must therefore heed their \r\nrecurrent pleas for the present imbalance or asymmetry \r\nwithin the Council to be corrected. \r\n With respect to the decision-making mechanism, \r\nVenezuela believes that the veto is inseparably linked \r\nto the question of the enlargement of the Security \r\nCouncil. From that point of view, the Bolivarian \r\nGovernment believes that the use of the veto is an \r\nanachronistic and antidemocratic mechanism that goes \r\nagainst the principle of sovereign equality among \r\nStates, as enshrined in the Charter of the United \r\nNations. Along those lines, the Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela advocates the elimination of the veto or the \r\nlimitation of its use, with a view to its total \r\nelimination.  \r\n With respect to the working methods of the \r\nSecurity Council, we acknowledge that we have seen, \r\nin recent years, some limited progress. However, the \r\nsteps forward are still insufficient because we have not \r\nduly addressed the pleas for greater openness and \r\ngreater transparency in the way the Council operates.  \r\n Bearing in mind that peace is a matter of concern \r\nto all countries, Venezuela expresses its rejection of the \r\nprocedure that people have tried to apply in the \r\nSecurity Council, namely, to hold closed meetings and \r\nconvert informal sessions into a rule. That type of \r\naction prevents the participation of the majority of \r\nMember States. Those meetings must be an exception, \r\nas stipulated in article 48 of the provisional rules of \r\nprocedure.  \r\n In order to maintain the spirit of transparency, the \r\nSecurity Council must hold frequent consultations with \r\nthe countries affected by its decisions. Countries that \r\nare not members of that organ should be invited to take \r\npart in informal consultations, using a procedure \r\nsimilar to the one stipulated in Articles 31 and 32 of \r\nthe Charter.  \r\n An overwhelming majority of countries would \r\nlike to see Security Council reform that would convert \r\nit into a democratic body with greater accountability, a \r\nbody that reflects the sovereign equality of States in \r\nthe way it operates. If we do not comply with those \r\nrequirements, the Security Council will not be \r\ntransparent or legitimate, nor can it be considered a \r\nbody that is representative of the community of \r\nnations. \r\n Our delegation has participated constructively in \r\nthe Security Council reform process, and we have been \r\nable to observe that the call to remedy the absence of \r\ndeveloping countries among the permanent members of \r\nthe Council is practically universal.  \r\nA/66/PV.51  \r\n \r\n11-58384 24 \r\n \r\n The number and distribution of permanent seats \r\nby regional groups that the majority supports is about \r\ntwo seats for Africa, one or two for Latin America and \r\nthe Caribbean, and two for Asia. It is also clear that \r\nthere is majority support for the expansion of both the \r\npermanent and the non-permanent member categories. \r\n There is also a consensus on the need to alter the \r\nSecurity Council’s working methods so as to make its \r\naction more transparent. We have to acknowledge, \r\nhowever, that despite the commitment of many \r\nMember States or groups of Member States, which \r\nhave submitted proposals in order to move the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations forward, the process \r\nhas been on hold since the beginning of the seventh \r\ninformal round. Given that situation, we have to look \r\ncarefully at positions that unquestionably reflect the \r\nopinions of the majority and we have to agree on a \r\nstrategy that would allow us to move forward.  \r\n The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela hopes that \r\nSecurity Council reform will not continue to be \r\npostponed.  \r\n I would like to conclude by pointing out that the \r\nVenezuelan delegation declares its firm intention to \r\ncontinue to play an active role in the negotiations with \r\na view to achieving a result that would thoroughly \r\nreflect the positions of the majority of the States \r\nMembers of the United Nations.  \r\n Mr. Wenaweser (Liechtenstein): My delegation \r\nassociates itself with the statement made by the \r\nrepresentative of Singapore, who spoke on behalf of \r\nthe group of five small nations (S-5) earlier this \r\nafternoon. \r\n We are entering the eighteenth year of our \r\ncollective effort to reform the Security Council. Much \r\nhas happened during those years. Significant \r\ngeopolitical changes have taken place, with some still \r\nunder way. None of that, however, seems to affect our \r\ninability to move this discussion forward, at least in the \r\narea of enlargement.  \r\n The President of the General Assembly at its last \r\nsession took an approach to the topic that was slightly \r\ndifferent from that of most of his predecessors when he \r\nput together a small informal group of ambassadors to \r\nexplore ways to move this agenda forward. It was a \r\nworthwhile effort, though it yielded much the same \r\nresult. One must therefore wonder what to expect from \r\nthis session and whether there are any avenues left for \r\nus to explore. We express our continued support for \r\nAmbassador Tanin and welcome any initiative that has \r\nthe potential to lead us out of the ongoing impasse. \r\n If the Council’s composition was outdated and a \r\npoor reflection of geopolitical realities in 1993, that is \r\nobviously even more the case today. But it is hard to \r\nargue that there is stronger momentum for reform \r\ntoday than there was back then. In some ways, the \r\nopposite may even be the case, despite all the \r\nunsuccessful attempts of the past few years and after \r\nall this time of circular discussions.  \r\n We know the talks that we are engaged in are not \r\nreally negotiations, despite the fact that we have \r\ndecided to call them just that. We are now facing the \r\nreal risk of the process being taken outside of the \r\nAssembly, with movement and progress being sought \r\nelsewhere, which could result in a politically \r\ndangerous showdown in the Assembly and which \r\nwould certainly undermine its authority, as it is often \r\ncriticized for its inability to take decisions on essential \r\nissues. That would be all the more deplorable as the \r\nreform of the Council falls squarely and exclusively \r\nwithin its competence. \r\n As is well known, Liechtenstein has for some \r\nyears now advocated an enlargement model that could \r\nrepresent a compromise by creating a new category of \r\nseats. Six members would be allowed to serve for a \r\nmuch longer term than the two years currently foreseen \r\nfor elected members under the Charter — perhaps as \r\nmany as 10 — and they would also be immediately \r\neligible for re-election. This new distribution of seats \r\ncould lead to some States serving permanently on the \r\nCouncil, without, of course, the privileges of the \r\ncurrent permanent members. But it could also lead to a \r\nsystem of rotation among a number of powerful States \r\nthat could divide these new seats among themselves, \r\nwith the support and consent of their respective \r\nregions. It would both safeguard the interests of small \r\nStates and avoid the difficulties that would come with \r\nthe enlargement of the category of permanent \r\nmembers, which is the core of the conundrum of \r\nSecurity Council reform. \r\n Enlargement is not the only and perhaps not the \r\nmost important aspect of reform. The way in which the \r\nCouncil carries out its tasks also needs to be addressed, \r\nas well as the “corporate culture” governing its \r\nactivities, which the Council, in accordance with the \r\nCharter, is carrying out on behalf of all Member States. \r\n A/66/PV.51\r\n \r\n25 11-58384 \r\n \r\nThis is all the more important because many of us have \r\nnever served on the Council, and many of us will \r\nalways have great difficulty in getting an opportunity \r\nto do so. Furthermore, the ever more far-reaching \r\ndecisions of the Council can be effective only if they \r\nfind broad political support among the membership and \r\nare matched by a strong political will to implement \r\nthem. The S-5, of which we are a proud member, \r\ntherefore views real progress in the area of working \r\nmethods as a means of improving the effectiveness of \r\nthe Council. It is certain that the discussions on \r\nSecurity Council reform have created positive \r\nmomentum in this respect. It can even be argued that \r\nthe only tangible, if indirect, results of past years have \r\nbeen in the area of working methods. That said, the \r\nmeasures decided on by the Council itself as part of \r\nthis process are not sufficient; more importantly, their \r\nimplementation has been uneven, inconsistent and at \r\ntimes arbitrary. It is thus essential that our efforts to \r\nimprove its working methods continue. \r\n The issue of working methods is an indispensable \r\npart of the comprehensive project to reform the \r\nSecurity Council. But it also must be pursued on its \r\nown merits, irrespective, and particularly in the \r\ncontinued absence, of any progress in the enlargement \r\nof the Council. By the same token, no one would argue \r\nthat the Council cannot be enlarged in the absence of \r\nan agreement on how to improve its working methods. \r\nWe as the S-5 have therefore circulated a new draft \r\nresolution for consideration by the members of the \r\nAssembly, and we look forward to a continued \r\ndialogue with all States on how to further pursue our \r\ninitiative. The text does not aim to offer a complete set \r\nof measures necessary to bring about the improvements \r\nfrom which the Council would benefit. Rather, it \r\naddresses some of the main political challenges, \r\nincluding the use of the veto, and provides for an \r\nongoing dialogue between the Assembly and the \r\nCouncil on the application of such measures. This \r\nwould also be very helpful in launching a genuine \r\ndialogue between the two bodies, which is foreseen \r\nunder the Charter but does not currently exist in our \r\npractice. \r\n Mr. Jerandi (Tunisia) (spoke in French): I should \r\nlike at the outset to pay tribute to President Al-Nasser’s \r\npredecessor, the President of the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-fifth session, and to his facilitators for their \r\ncontribution to the issue that we are discussing today. \r\n My delegation associates itself with the statement \r\nmade earlier by the representative of Egypt on behalf \r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement. \r\n In that context, my delegation welcomes the \r\noutcome of the new stage of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiation process, which is based on the proposals of \r\nMember States on the question of equitable \r\nrepresentation on and an increase in the membership of \r\nthe Security Council, in an open, inclusive and \r\ntransparent manner, aimed at identifying a solution that \r\nwould garner the political support of the broadest \r\npossible number of Member States. \r\n I should like also to express my sincere \r\nappreciation to the Ambassador of Afghanistan for the \r\nway in which he conducted the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on Security Council reform. I wish to \r\nassure him of our full cooperation in this process. \r\n As we await the resumption of the negotiations, I \r\nwish to make several comments.  \r\n The Security Council must reflect the political \r\nand economic realities of today’s world. It must be \r\ngiven the legitimacy needed to act on behalf of the \r\ninternational community in discharging the mandate \r\nthat devolves upon it in accordance with the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations. \r\n Likewise, my delegation is of the view that the \r\nultimate aim of any Security Council reform effort \r\nmust be the strengthening of equitable representation \r\nwithin that body as well as of its credibility and \r\neffectiveness. The Council must under no \r\ncircumstances become a private club of countries that \r\nare endowed with special privileges or be perceived as \r\nsuch. That would pose a real danger with respect to its \r\nresolutions and their effectiveness, as well as its \r\nlegitimacy in dealing with issues as sensitive as those \r\nrelating to international peace and security. \r\n At a time when the world is changing radically \r\nand undergoing major geostrategic changes, and at a \r\ntime when the Arab Spring, which began in Tunisia, is \r\nmost probably one of the most visible current \r\nmanifestations of that change, the permanent members \r\nof the Security Council themselves recognize the \r\nimperative need for an adaptation of international \r\nrelations and the dynamics governing them. Given that \r\nthe Council, as the organ that is ultimately responsible \r\nfor the crucial task of the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security, is at the heart of those dynamics, it \r\nA/66/PV.51  \r\n \r\n11-58384 26 \r\n \r\nmust not be spared such adjustment and adaptation to \r\nthe current regional and international realities. \r\n The realities that obtained in the 1940s, when the \r\nCharter of the United Nations was adopted, no longer \r\nprevail; they have mutated, and often new realities \r\nhave come into play without the Council’s changing its \r\ncomposition or its working methods. Council reform is \r\ntherefore a necessity and not a luxury. The future of \r\nthat executive organ depends upon it, as does its \r\nlegitimacy and the legitimacy of the Organization as a \r\nwhole.  \r\n Such reform must be comprehensive, transparent \r\nand balanced. The agenda of the Council must reflect \r\nthe needs and interests of both developed and \r\ndeveloping countries in an objective, rational, \r\nnon-selective and non-arbitrary manner. All substantive \r\nissues must be addressed, including its composition, \r\nregional representation, agenda, working methods and \r\ndecision-making process, including the right of veto, \r\nand we must secure the most broad-based political \r\nconsensus possible among Member States.  \r\n These aims can be achieved only through \r\nexpansion, particularly in favour of developing \r\ncountries. Likewise, the makeup of a restructured \r\nSecurity Council must reflect all the sensibilities of the \r\ninternational community. \r\n In that context, Tunisia continues to strongly \r\nsupport the position of the African Union, as reflected \r\nin the Ezulwini Consensus on the issue of Security \r\nCouncil reform and the Sirte Declaration. We believe \r\nthat it is time to redress the current situation whereby \r\nthe African continent remains deprived of a permanent \r\nseat on the Security Council. \r\n We will support any solution that gives \r\ndeveloping countries in general and Africa in particular \r\ntheir rightful place in the Security Council.  \r\n Tunisia, which has since the 1960s participated in \r\nseveral peacekeeping operations and has helped, \r\nthrough diplomatic channels or using its forces, to \r\nresolve conflicts, and which has recently suffered the \r\nfallout of conflict in a neighbouring country, \r\nunderstands all too well the challenges posed by war \r\nand hotbeds of tension.  \r\n My country remains convinced that a Security \r\nCouncil with such a limited membership and such rigid \r\nmechanisms is not in a position to meet either the \r\ncurrent need to provide rapid, effective and appropriate \r\nintervention in connection with the growing number of \r\nconflicts, or the aspirations of the peoples of the world, \r\nwho see the United Nations and its executive body as \r\ntheir only champion when all hope has been lost. \r\n In conclusion, we believe that for the Security \r\nCouncil to continue to enjoy the trust of States and \r\nworld public opinion, it must demonstrate that it can \r\ntackle the most difficult issues effectively, while \r\nbecoming more representative of the international \r\ncommunity as a whole and of the realities of today’s \r\nworld.  \r\n Mr. León González (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nCuba associates itself with the statement made by the \r\nPermanent Representative of Egypt on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement. We wish to reiterate our \r\nsupport for the work of Ambassador Zahir Tanin, Chair \r\nof the negotiations on the question of equitable \r\nrepresentation and increase in the membership of the \r\nSecurity Council and other matters related to the \r\nCouncil.  \r\n With regard to agenda item 30, “Report of the \r\nSecurity Council”, Cuba welcomes the efforts to \r\nimprove the quality of the Council’s annual report \r\n(A/66/2). However, the report essentially remains a \r\ndescriptive document, lacking the analytical focus that \r\nwe, as Member States, need in order to assess the work \r\nof that organ. We emphasize the need for the Council \r\nto present to the General Assembly the special reports \r\nstipulated by the Charter in Articles 15 and 24. \r\n Cuba underscores the responsibility of the \r\nCouncil to give due account of its work to the General \r\nAssembly. In conformity with the Charter, we have \r\nentrusted that organ of very limited membership with \r\nthe primary responsibility to act on our behalf to \r\nmaintain international peace and security.  \r\n With regard to agenda item 122, we reiterate the \r\nneed for an urgent and far-reaching reform of the \r\nSecurity Council. There cannot be true reform of the \r\nUnited Nations without reform of the Security Council. \r\nThat reform cannot continuously be postponed nor can \r\nit continue to ignore the demands of the majority of \r\nMember States. The international community needs a \r\nSecurity Council that is more representative, \r\ndemocratic and transparent, in accordance with the \r\nminimum standards of the rule of law and in order to \r\nadequately tackle global challenges. \r\n A/66/PV.51\r\n \r\n27 11-58384 \r\n \r\n Cuba supports an immediate enlargement of the \r\nSecurity Council, in both the permanent and the \r\nnon-permanent categories. Increasing only the number \r\nof non-permanent seats would further widen the huge \r\ngap that already exists between permanent and \r\nnon-permanent members. Developing countries should \r\nhave greater representation and participation within the \r\nCouncil, in particular, in the category of permanent \r\nmembership. There is no justification for entire \r\nregions, such as Africa and Latin America and the \r\nCaribbean, to lack permanent representation. Suffice it \r\nto say that more than half of the Council’s agenda \r\nitems relate to Africa, and it is not hard to understand \r\nthe justice of that continent’s demands, which enjoys \r\nour full support. \r\n Cuba does not support any kind of discrimination \r\namong sovereign States. That is why we believe that \r\nthe new permanent members must have the same rights \r\nand obligations as the current ones. The entry of new \r\npermanent members not having the right of veto would \r\nbe equivalent to creating a new category of Security \r\nCouncil members, which Cuba does not support. There \r\nis no justification for developing countries that enter as \r\nnew permanent members to have a lesser status that the \r\ncurrent permanent members. Cuba’s position on the \r\nveto has been and remains very clear. The veto is an \r\nanachronistic and antidemocratic privilege, which is \r\nwhy it must be eliminated as soon as possible.  \r\n With regard to the size of the Security Council, \r\nCuba believes that an enlarged Council should have no \r\nmore than 26 members. With that number, the ratio of \r\nnew Council members to the membership of the United \r\nNations would be similar to the ratio at the time of the \r\nOrganization’s establishment.  \r\n The reform of the Security Council must include \r\na thorough reform of its working methods. Although \r\nsome modest changes have been introduced in recent \r\nyears, most of them have been more formal than \r\nsubstantive. The truth is that, at present, the Security \r\nCouncil is not transparent, democratic or efficient.  \r\n We advocate a Security Council in which closed-\r\ndoor consultations are the exception. We aspire to a \r\nCouncil that addresses only matters under its remit and \r\ndoes not encroach on those of other bodies. We want a \r\nCouncil that truly takes into account the views of the \r\nOrganization’s members before making decisions and \r\nthat ensures non-member States of that body genuine \r\naccess. \r\n In short, we advocate a democratic, participatory \r\nand transparent Security Council that has the ability \r\nand true legitimacy to mobilize the international \r\ncommunity as it addresses current global challenges to \r\ninternational peace and security. \r\n  The meeting rose at 6 p.m. \r\n"
