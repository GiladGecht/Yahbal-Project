The \r\nAssembly will now proceed to vote with respect to the \r\nremaining vacancy. \r\n Once again, I should like to remind \r\nrepresentatives that, pursuant to rule 88 of the rules of \r\nprocedure, \r\n  “After the President has announced the \r\nbeginning of voting, no representative shall \r\ninterrupt the voting except on a point of order in \r\nconnection with the actual conduct of the voting.” \r\n We shall now begin the voting process. Ballot \r\npapers will now be distributed.  \r\n All the candidates whose names appear on the \r\nballot paper are eligible. The names of the four \r\ncandidates who have already obtained an absolute \r\nmajority of votes, that is, Mr. Giorgio Gaja, \r\nMr. Hisashi Owada, Mr. Peter Tomka and Ms. Xue \r\nHanqin, have been deleted from the ballot. May I \r\nremind delegations that the name of only one candidate \r\nshould be marked with a cross. Any ballot paper on \r\nwhich more than one name is marked will be \r\nconsidered invalid. Votes may be cast only for those \r\nwhose names appear on the ballot papers. \r\n At the invitation of the Acting President, \r\nMs. Bonkoungou (Burkina Faso), Ms. Shiolashvili \r\n(Georgia), Ms. Mannion (Ireland), Mrs. Azmee \r\n(Malaysia), Ms. Martínez (Mexico) and \r\nMs. Kloeg (Netherlands) acted as tellers. \r\n A vote was taken by secret ballot. \r\n The meeting was suspended at 11.55 a.m. and \r\nresumed at 12.35 p.m. \r\n The Acting President: The result of the voting is \r\nas follows: \r\n Number of ballot papers:   193 \r\n Number of invalid ballots:   0 \r\n Number of valid ballots:   193 \r\n Abstentions:     0 \r\n Number of members voting:  193 \r\n Required absolute majority:  97 \r\n Number of votes obtained: \r\n  Ms. Julia Sebutinde (Uganda) 95 \r\n  Mr. Abdul G. Koroma (Sierra Leone) 72 \r\n  Ms. Tsvetana Kamenova (Bulgaria) 19 \r\n  El Hadji Mansour Tall (Senegal) 7 \r\nA/66/PV.54  \r\n \r\n11-58838 2 \r\n \r\n Since no candidate has obtained an absolute \r\nmajority in the previous round of balloting, the \r\nAssembly will proceed to another unrestricted ballot to \r\nfill the remaining vacancy.  \r\n I should like to remind representatives that, \r\npursuant to rule 88 of the rules of procedure,  \r\n  “After the President has announced the \r\nbeginning of voting, no representative shall \r\ninterrupt the voting except on a point of order in \r\nconnection with the actual conduct of the voting.” \r\nAny announcements, including those concerning \r\nwithdrawals of candidatures, should therefore be made \r\nprior to the commencement of the voting process, that \r\nis to say, before the announcement of the beginning of \r\nthe voting process. \r\n Mr. Raytchev (Bulgaria): On behalf of the \r\ndelegation of Bulgaria, I would like to announce that \r\nour nominated candidate, Ms. Tsvetana Kamenova, \r\nwithdraws her candidature for the position.  \r\n I would also like to take this opportunity to \r\ncongratulate all those who have been elected and to \r\nwish them every success in their future endeavours. I \r\nalso wish every success to those who remain in the \r\nelection process.  \r\n Mr. Diallo (Senegal) (spoke in French): I would \r\nlike to thank my Bulgarian colleague for his spirit of \r\ncooperation. We are great friends.  \r\n I would like to take this opportunity to say that \r\nthe delegation of Senegal, having consulted with \r\ncandidate Mr. El Hadji Mansour Tall, would like to \r\nwithdraw his candidature. I also take this opportunity \r\nto thank all the countries who voted for Mr. Tall. We \r\nalso congratulate those who have already been elected, \r\nand wish good luck to the remaining candidates.  \r\n The Acting President: Given the statements that \r\nwe have just heard, may I take it that the national \r\ngroups that have nominated the candidates of Bulgaria \r\nand Senegal concur with their withdrawal? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The Acting President: They are therefore no \r\nlonger candidates and their names have therefore been \r\ndeleted from the ballot papers. \r\n We shall now begin the voting process. Ballot \r\npapers will now be distributed.  \r\n All the candidates whose names appear on the \r\nballot paper are eligible. The names of the two \r\ncandidates who have withdrawn their candidatures \r\nhave been deleted from the ballots. May I remind \r\ndelegations that the name of only one candidate should \r\nbe marked with a cross. Any ballot paper on which \r\nmore than one name is marked will be considered \r\ninvalid. Votes may be cast only for those whose names \r\nappear on the ballot papers. \r\n At the invitation of the Acting President, \r\nMs. Bonkoungou (Burkina Faso), Ms. Shiolashvili \r\n(Georgia), Ms. Mannion (Ireland), Mrs. Azmee \r\n(Malaysia), Ms. Martínez (Mexico) and \r\nMs. Kloeg (Netherlands) acted as tellers. \r\n A vote was taken by secret ballot. \r\n The meeting was suspended at 1 p.m. and \r\nresumed at 1.25 p.m. \r\n The Acting President: The result of the voting is \r\nas follows: \r\n Number of ballot papers:   193 \r\n Number of invalid ballots:   0 \r\n Number of valid ballots:   193 \r\n Abstentions:     0 \r\n Number of members voting:  193 \r\n Required absolute majority:  97 \r\n Number of votes obtained: \r\n  Ms. Julia Sebutinde (Uganda) 110 \r\n  Mr. Abdul G. Koroma (Sierra Leone) 83 \r\n Ms. Julia Sebutinde has obtained an absolute \r\nmajority in the General Assembly.  \r\n I have communicated the result of the voting to \r\nthe President of the Security Council.  \r\n I have also received a letter from the President of \r\nthe Security Council, which reads: \r\n  “I have the honour to inform you that at the \r\n6652nd meeting of the Security Council, held on \r\n10 November 2011, for the purpose of electing \r\nfive members of the International Court of Justice \r\nfor a term of office beginning on 6 February \r\n2012, Mr. Abdul G. Koroma obtained an absolute \r\nmajority of votes.” \r\n As a result of the voting that has taken place \r\nindependently in the General Assembly and the \r\nSecurity Council, no candidate has obtained an \r\nabsolute majority in both bodies. The Assembly will \r\n A/66/PV.54\r\n \r\n3 11-58838 \r\n \r\ntherefore proceed to a third meeting to fill the \r\nremaining vacancy. However, in view of the lateness of  \r\nthe hour, that meeting will take place this afternoon at \r\n3 p.m. \r\n  The meeting rose at 1.30 p.m. \r\n"
