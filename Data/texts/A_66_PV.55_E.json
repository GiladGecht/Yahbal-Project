The \r\nAssembly will now proceed to vote with respect to the \r\nremaining vacancy. \r\n Once again, I should like to remind \r\nrepresentatives that, pursuant to rule 88 of the rules of \r\nprocedure, \r\n  “After the President has announced the \r\nbeginning of voting, no representative shall \r\ninterrupt the voting except on a point of order in \r\nconnection with the actual conduct of the voting.” \r\n We shall now begin the voting process. Ballot \r\npapers will now be distributed. \r\n All the candidates whose names appear on the \r\nballot paper are eligible. The names of the four \r\ncandidates who have already obtained an absolute \r\nmajority of votes, that is, Mr. Giorgio Gaja, \r\nMr. Hisashi Owada, Mr. Peter Tomka and Ms. Xue \r\nHanqin, as well as the names of the candidates who \r\nhave withdrawn, namely, Ms. Tsvetana Kamenova and \r\nEl Hadji Mansour Tall, have been deleted from the \r\nballot. May I remind delegations that the name of only \r\none candidate should be marked with a cross. Any \r\nballot paper on which more than one name is marked \r\nwill be considered invalid. Votes may be cast only for \r\nthose whose names appear on the ballot papers. \r\n At the invitation of the President, Ms. Bonkoungou \r\n(Burkina Faso), Ms. Shiolashvili (Georgia), \r\nMs. Mannion (Ireland), Mrs. Azmee (Malaysia), \r\nMs. Martínez (Mexico) and Ms. Kloeg \r\n(Netherlands) acted as tellers. \r\n A vote was taken by secret ballot. \r\n In the absence of the President, Mr. Thomson \r\n(Fiji), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\n The meeting was suspended at 3.20 p.m. and \r\nresumed at 3.45 p.m. \r\n The Acting President: The result of the voting is \r\nas follows: \r\n Number of ballot papers:   189 \r\n Number of invalid ballots:   0 \r\n Number of valid ballots:   180 \r\n Abstentions:     0 \r\n Number of members voting:  189 \r\n Required two-thirds majority:  97 \r\n Number of votes obtained: \r\n  Ms. Julia Sebutinde (Uganda) 96 \r\n  Mr. Abdul G. Koroma (Sierra Leone) 93 \r\nA/66/PV.55  \r\n \r\n11-58844 2 \r\n \r\n Since no candidate has obtained an absolute \r\nmajority in the previous round of balloting, the \r\nAssembly will proceed to another unrestricted ballot to \r\nfill the remaining vacancy.  \r\n I should like to remind representatives that, \r\npursuant to rule 88 of the rules of procedure,  \r\n  “After the President has announced the \r\nbeginning of voting, no representative shall \r\ninterrupt the voting except on a point of order in \r\nconnection with the actual conduct of the voting.” \r\nAny announcements, including those concerning \r\nwithdrawals of candidatures, should therefore be made \r\nprior to the commencement of the voting process, that \r\nis to say, before the announcement of the beginning of \r\nthe voting process. \r\n We shall now begin the voting process. Ballot \r\npapers will now be distributed. \r\n All the candidates whose names appear on the \r\nballot paper are eligible. The names of the two \r\ncandidates who have withdrawn their candidatures \r\nhave been deleted from the ballots. May I remind \r\ndelegations that the name of only one candidate should \r\nbe marked with a cross. Any ballot paper on which \r\nmore than one name is marked will be considered \r\ninvalid. Votes may be cast only for those whose names \r\nappear on the ballot papers. \r\n At the invitation of the Acting President, \r\nMs. Bonkoungou (Burkina Faso), Ms. Shiolashvili \r\n(Georgia), Ms. Mannion (Ireland), Mrs. Azmee \r\n(Malaysia), Ms. Martínez (Mexico) and Ms. Kloeg \r\n(Netherlands) acted as tellers. \r\n A vote was taken by secret ballot. \r\n The meeting was suspended at 3.50 p.m. and \r\nresumed at 4.50 p.m. \r\n The Acting President: The result of the voting is \r\nas follows: \r\n Number of ballot papers:   192 \r\n Number of invalid ballots:   0 \r\n Number of valid ballots:   192 \r\n Abstentions:     0 \r\n Number of members voting:  192 \r\n Required two-thirds majority:  97 \r\n \r\n Number of votes obtained: \r\n  Ms. Julia Sebutinde (Uganda) 98 \r\n  Mr. Abdul G. Koroma (Sierra Leone) 94 \r\n Ms. Julia Sebutinde has obtained an absolute \r\nmajority in the General Assembly.  \r\n I have communicated the result of the voting to \r\nthe President of the Security Council.  \r\n I have received a letter from the President of the \r\nSecurity Council, which reads: \r\n  “I have the honour to inform you that at the \r\n6653rd meeting of the Security Council, held on \r\n10 November 2011, for the purpose of electing \r\nfive members of the International Court of Justice \r\nfor a term of office beginning on 6 February \r\n2012, Mr. Abdul G. Koroma obtained an absolute \r\nmajority of votes.” \r\n As a result of the voting that has taken place \r\nindependently in the General Assembly and the \r\nSecurity Council, no candidate has obtained an \r\nabsolute majority in both bodies.  \r\n In accordance with Article 12 of the Statute of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, if, after the third \r\nmeeting, one or more seats still remain unfilled, a joint \r\nconference consisting of six members, three appointed \r\nby the General Assembly and three by the Security \r\nCouncil, may be formed at any time at the request of \r\neither the General Assembly or the Security Council \r\nfor the purpose of choosing by vote an absolute \r\nmajority one name for each seat still vacant, to submit \r\nto the General Assembly and the Security Council for \r\ntheir respective acceptance. The General Assembly has \r\nnever chosen to avail itself of a joint conference and \r\nhas, in similar circumstances, proceeding to conduct \r\nfurther balloting.  \r\n I therefore intend, unless and until the General \r\nAssembly decides otherwise, to follow past practice \r\nand to continue with balloting in accordance with \r\napplicable procedures. Unless I hear any objection, I \r\nshall take it that the Assembly agrees to proceed \r\naccordingly. \r\n It was so decided. \r\n  The meeting rose at 4.55 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\n"
