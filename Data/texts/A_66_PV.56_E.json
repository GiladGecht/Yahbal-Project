The \r\nAssembly will now proceed to vote with respect to the \r\nremaining vacancy. \r\n Once again, I should like to remind \r\nrepresentatives that, pursuant to rule 88 of the rules of \r\nprocedure, \r\n  “After the President has announced the \r\nbeginning of voting, no representative shall \r\ninterrupt the voting except on a point of order in \r\nconnection with the actual conduct of the voting.” \r\n We shall now begin the voting process. Ballot \r\npapers will now be distributed. \r\n All the candidates whose names appear on the \r\nballot paper are eligible. May I remind delegations that \r\nthe name of only one candidate should be marked with \r\na cross. Any ballot paper on which more than one name \r\nis marked will be considered invalid. Votes may be cast \r\nonly for those whose names appear on the ballot \r\npapers. \r\n At the invitation of the Acting President, \r\nMs. Bonkoungou (Burkina Faso), Ms. Shiolashvili \r\n(Georgia), Ms. Mannion (Ireland), Mrs. Azmee \r\n(Malaysia), Ms. Martínez (Mexico) and Ms. Kloeg \r\n(Netherlands) acted as tellers. \r\n A vote was taken by secret ballot. \r\n The meeting was suspended at 5 p.m. and \r\nresumed at 5.35 p.m. \r\n The Acting President: The result of the voting is \r\nas follows: \r\n Number of ballot papers:   193 \r\n Number of invalid ballots:   0 \r\n Number of valid ballots:   193 \r\n Abstentions:     0 \r\n Number of members voting:  193 \r\n Required two-thirds majority:  97 \r\n Number of votes obtained: \r\n  Ms. Julia Sebutinde (Uganda) 98 \r\n  Mr. Abdul G. Koroma (Sierra Leone) 95 \r\n Ms. Julia Sebutinde has obtained an absolute \r\nmajority in the General Assembly.  \r\n I have communicated the result of the voting to \r\nthe President of the Security Council.  \r\nA/66/PV.56  \r\n \r\n11-58945 2 \r\n \r\n I have received a letter from the President of the \r\nSecurity Council, which reads: \r\n  “I have the honour to inform you that at the \r\n6654th meeting of the Security Council, held on \r\n10 November 2011, for the purpose of electing \r\nfive members of the International Court of Justice \r\nfor a term of office beginning on 6 February \r\n2012, Mr. Abdul G. Koroma obtained an absolute \r\nmajority of votes.” \r\n As a result of the voting that has taken place \r\nindependently in the General Assembly and the \r\nSecurity Council, no candidate has obtained an \r\nabsolute majority in both bodies. The Assembly will \r\ntherefore need to proceed to a fifth meeting to fill the \r\nremaining vacancy. The 57th plenary meeting will be \r\nheld immediately to fill that vacancy. \r\n  The meeting rose at 5.40 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\n"
