(Qatar) \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 9.35 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nHigh-level Meeting of the General Assembly on  \r\nthe theme “Addressing desertification, land \r\ndegradation and drought in the context of \r\nsustainable development and poverty eradication” \r\n \r\nAgenda item 19 \r\n \r\nSustainable development \r\n \r\n (e) Implementation of the United Nations \r\nConvention to Combat Desertification in Those \r\nCountries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or \r\nDesertification, Particularly in Africa \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I now declare \r\nopen the High-level Meeting of the General Assembly \r\non addressing desertification, land degradation and \r\ndrought in the context of sustainable development and \r\npoverty eradication, held in accordance with resolution \r\n65/160, of 20 December 2010. I extend a warm \r\nwelcome to all participants.  \r\n \r\nStatement by the President \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): It is my distinct \r\nhonour to welcome all participants to this historic \r\nHigh-level Meeting on addressing desertification, land \r\ndegradation and drought in the context of sustainable \r\ndevelopment and poverty eradication. \r\n I would like to take this opportunity to \r\nacknowledge the leadership role of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, and of the Executive \r\nSecretary of the United Nations Convention to Combat \r\nDesertification, Mr. Luc Gnacadja, on this important \r\nissue. I would also like to thank Member States for \r\ntheir tireless efforts in bringing the issue of \r\ndesertification to the agenda of the General Assembly. \r\nThe role of the Group of 77 and China deserves \r\nparticular appreciation in this respect.  \r\n Desertification is one of the most complex \r\nchallenges of our time. It has serious environmental, \r\neconomic, political and social impacts that affect \r\npeople, most of whom are poor. According to estimates \r\nby the United Nations Environmental Programme, one \r\nquarter of our Earth’s land is threatened by \r\ndesertification and the livelihoods of over 1 billion \r\npeople in more than 100 countries are jeopardized by \r\ndesertification. \r\n Desertification also threatens to critically \r\nundermine gains achieved in sustainable development. \r\nThe economic, social and human cost of desertification \r\nis tremendous. I therefore call upon the international \r\ncommunity to take immediate and decisive action to \r\naddress its impacts and to take measures for both its \r\nprevention and its reversal. \r\n A silent killer, drought has hit East Africa this \r\nyear, and once again the world has seen unimaginable \r\nhuman suffering. Countries in this region are \r\nexperiencing the worst drought in 60 years. In the past \r\nthree months alone, this famine has claimed the lives \r\nof tens of thousands of Somali children under the age \r\nof five, and it has caused possibly permanent social \r\ndisruption as people have been forced to leave their \r\ncommunities, villages and towns. This is the most \r\nA/66/PV.6  \r\n \r\n11-50534 2 \r\n \r\nsevere food crisis in the world today, and it still \r\nrequires urgent and concerted action at the global level. \r\n Global attention to addressing land degradation \r\nand the scarcity of natural resource has no doubt been \r\non the increase, particularly in connection with the \r\nchallenges of climate change and the food crisis. \r\nHowever, our common efforts thus far have fallen \r\nshort. \r\n Major innovative policy interventions and shifts \r\nin sustainable land management strategies will be \r\nneeded to address the impacts of desertification. Such \r\ninterventions require moving towards an ambitious \r\nquantitative target and a zero net land degradation rate. \r\nEffective restoration and rehabilitation of degraded \r\nlands and drylands requires the development of new \r\npolicies and technologies that promote sustainable use \r\nof resources, as well as predictable financial resources \r\nto support domestic initiatives. These strategies must \r\nensure the active engagement of all stakeholders and \r\nlocal communities. \r\n A number of important global conferences on \r\nsustainable development will be held this year. In \r\nOctober, the international community will meet in the \r\nRepublic of Korea at the tenth session of the \r\nConference of the Parties to the United Nations \r\nConvention to Combat Desertification. Today’s \r\ndiscussion among world leaders is an excellent \r\nopportunity to help stimulate efforts aimed at reaching \r\na decisive outcome at the Conference.  \r\n The twentieth anniversary of the Earth Summit, \r\nwhich was held in June 1992 in Rio de Janeiro, is also \r\naround the corner. I urge Member States to ensure a \r\nforward-looking outcome at the Rio+20 Conference \r\nthat reaffirms the balance between the economic, social \r\nand environmental aspects of sustainable development. \r\nI would also encourage Members States to reaffirm in \r\ntheir deliberations the fulfilment of commitments to the \r\nUnited Nations Convention to Combat Desertification \r\nand its 10-year strategic plan and framework, and to \r\nfurther enhance the implementation of the Convention. \r\n Effectively addressing desertification and land \r\ndegradation can be done only in the context of other \r\nmajor global challenges, such as climate change, \r\npoverty eradication, food security, deforestation and \r\nbiodiversity loss. I would like to address one of these \r\nissues in particular today: food security.  \r\n Food security is an urgent issue before us today. \r\nFood insecurity has an impact on a daily basis on \r\npeople in arid countries in particular. Many of them \r\nface severe malnutrition and undernourishment, and \r\ntheir health is compromised as a result. Malnutrition \r\nhas a particularly lasting impact on children, as their \r\ndevelopment and growth are stunted.  \r\n Arid countries have begun to understand the \r\nimportance of building their own country-led \r\ninitiatives that aim to address the root causes of food \r\ninsecurity. They are also collaborating to form South-\r\nSouth, triangular and global alliances that would allow \r\nthem to share technological and policy solutions to \r\ncombat desertification and the degradation of lands in \r\nall ecosystems. \r\n I am pleased to observe a small but growing \r\nnumber of such initiatives aimed at addressing food \r\ninsecurity in Africa, Asia and South America. These \r\ninitiatives include a proposal made by the State of \r\nQatar in September 2010, during the sixty-fifth session \r\nof the General Assembly, at the special side event \r\nentitled “Global Dry Land Alliance: Partnering for \r\nFood Security”. The proposal is for a group of dryland \r\ncountries to join together to form a global dryland \r\nalliance. The innovative solutions and best practices \r\ndeveloped by such an alliance could be shared broadly \r\nwith dryland countries throughout the world.  \r\n Another example is the African Union’s Great \r\nGreen Wall Initiative, which aims to tackle both \r\nenvironmental and poverty-related challenges and to \r\naddress the effects of land degradation, increasing \r\naridity and desertification in the African Sahara and the \r\nSahel drylands by planting a wall of trees across \r\nAfrica, from Senegal in the west to Djibouti in the east.  \r\n Initiatives such as these are designed to support \r\nand complement efforts towards tangible progress in \r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs), particularly MDG 1, which is to eradicate \r\nextreme poverty and hunger. \r\n Land is life, and our life depends on land. We \r\nmust stop the deadly process of desertification, restore \r\nhealth and vitality to our precious Earth and protect the \r\nlivelihoods of people worldwide. This is our \r\nresponsibility.  \r\n I now give the floor to His Excellency the \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon. \r\n A/66/PV.6\r\n \r\n3 11-50534 \r\n \r\n The Secretary-General: Today, the drylands of \r\nthe Horn of Africa are experiencing the most severe \r\nfood crisis in the world. More than 13 million people in \r\nDjibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia are in urgent \r\nneed of humanitarian aid. The United Nations and our \r\npartners are working hard to save lives and alleviate \r\nsuffering. \r\n But let me be frank. Drought does not have to \r\nbecome famine. Too often, the international community \r\nreacts too late. Too often, decisions are taken based on \r\nfalse economies. In the end, we count the cost not just \r\nin human lives but in the extra expense of responding \r\nto crises that could have been averted for a fraction of \r\nthe price. \r\n The world’s drylands are too often an investment \r\ndesert, seen by Governments and the international \r\ncommunity as a lost cause. Nothing could be further \r\nfrom the truth. I thank the General Assembly for \r\nholding this High-level Meeting to highlight the fact \r\nthat drylands hold the potential — both immediate and \r\nlong-term — to drive national economic growth and \r\nsustainable human development. \r\n Forty per cent of the Earth’s land mass is \r\ncharacterized as arid or semi-arid. Two billion people \r\ndepend on drylands for sustenance and income. Many \r\nare among the world’s poorest and most vulnerable to \r\nhunger. Drylands also offer considerable potential for \r\nhelping to mitigate the effects of climate change. \r\nDryland carbon storage — mainly in the form of soil \r\ncarbon — accounts for more than one third of the \r\nglobal stock.  \r\n So the incentive for the sustainable management \r\nof drylands is clear. Why, then, are we allowing these \r\nvaluable lands, which support so many people, to \r\ndeteriorate as a result of unsustainable land and water \r\nuse and the impacts of climate change?  \r\n Let us resolve today to reverse this trend. Let us \r\nrecognize that resisting desertification, preserving \r\ndrylands and nurturing the communities that depend on \r\nthem lies at the core of sustainable development. \r\n Contrary to common perception, not all drylands \r\nare barren or unproductive. Some of the world’s \r\nprimary cereal-producing regions are in semi-arid \r\nareas. Communities and businesses everywhere are \r\ndiscovering the potential of drylands. Tibetan herders \r\nare selling yak wool for cashmere in worldwide luxury \r\nmarkets. Unique pelts are providing income for \r\ncommunities in the arid regions of Namibia, where \r\nconventional farming is impossible.  \r\n In other areas, biofuels grow where little else can. \r\nThe potential of dryland solar and wind resources has \r\nbarely been tapped. Timely action on our part can \r\nunlock these riches and provide solutions to a number \r\nof global challenges, from food insecurity to rural \r\npoverty, energy insecurity, biodiversity loss, climate \r\nchange, political instability, geopolitical conflict and \r\nforced migration. \r\n But to do this, we need enhanced investment in \r\nhalting desertification and reclaiming degraded lands. \r\nSuccess stories can point the way, and success stories \r\nabound. From restoring ancient terraces in the Peruvian \r\nAndes, to planting trees to hold back the encroaching \r\nSaharan sands, from rehabilitating watersheds in India \r\nto using summer floods to reduce salinity in China, \r\nthere are examples from all continents of Governments \r\nand communities reversing desertification and \r\nimproving the productivity of the land. \r\n But we must also acknowledge that land \r\ndegradation is not just a dryland issue. Studies show \r\nthat land degradation is occurring in humid, tropical \r\nareas at a faster rate than ever before. If this \r\nphenomenon is not reversed in time, it could roll back \r\nour efforts to eradicate poverty, achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals and achieve \r\nsustainable development. \r\n As the climate warms, drought will emerge in \r\nnew areas and become more frequent and intense. \r\nDrought and land degradation must therefore move to \r\nthe centre of policy development. By refocusing our \r\ndevelopment agenda to include the potential of \r\ndrylands, we can break the links between poverty and \r\ndesertification, drought and land degradation. \r\n The outcome of today’s deliberations will feed \r\ninto the tenth session of the Conference of the Parties \r\nto the United Nations Convention to Combat \r\nDesertification (UNCCD) and the United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20). We \r\nare still at the early stages of the United Nations \r\nDecade for Deserts and the Fight against \r\nDesertification and the 10-year strategic plan of the \r\nUNCCD. \r\n Let us resolve today to work towards a world \r\nwhere there is no more land degradation. Let us make \r\nsustainable land use a cornerstone of the green \r\nA/66/PV.6  \r\n \r\n11-50534 4 \r\n \r\neconomy for poverty eradication and sustainable \r\ndevelopment. \r\n I wish members and participants a productive \r\nmeeting, and I count on their leadership and \r\ncommitment. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I thank the \r\nSecretary-General for his statement. \r\n I have been informed that the United States will \r\nspeak in the opening segment in its capacity as host \r\ncountry. If I hear no objection, we shall proceed \r\naccordingly. \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I now give the \r\nfloor to Mr. Luc Gnacadja, Executive Secretary of the \r\nUnited Nations Convention to Combat Desertification. \r\n Mr. Gnacadja (United Nations Convention to \r\nCombat Desertification): In 1992, the Earth Summit \r\ntook the bold decision to address the issue of land \r\ndegradation and drought, particularly in the drylands, \r\nthrough a legally binding treaty, the United Nations \r\nConvention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD). This \r\nis the first time since its entry into force in 1996 that \r\nits core issues have been taken up by such a high-level \r\npolitical gathering. \r\n Let me start by sharing the good news from this \r\npolicy evolution. First, in the past two decades, \r\nsignificant land recovery and improvement have \r\noccurred in the drylands. In many cases, drylands \r\npopulations have been leading these innovations and \r\nprogress. \r\n Secondly, we have accumulated a large amount of \r\nscientific knowledge about the drivers of land \r\ndegradation, the extent of land degradation in different \r\necosystems, as well as its strong linkages with other \r\nglobal issues such as poverty and food insecurity, \r\nclimate change and loss of biodiversity. \r\n Thirdly, on the policy side, through the UNCCD’s \r\n10-year Strategy 2008-2018, the 194 parties to the \r\nConvention have agreed on a more focused and \r\nmeasurable approach to implementing the Convention. \r\n I would have liked my intervention today to be all \r\nabout good news. Unfortunately, I have to report that, \r\ndespite the crippling effects of land degradation or soil \r\nnutrients depletion, the world has continued building \r\ntowards a soil peak that will have far-worse \r\nconsequences than the current oil peak. What are the \r\nthreats, and why are they ignored? \r\n The threats and far-reaching impacts of land \r\ndegradation are ignored largely because the issue is \r\nstill a blind spot for the international community, \r\ndespite the search for sustainability. Our most \r\nsignificant non-renewable georesource is fertile land \r\nand soil. Nevertheless, each year an estimated \r\n24 billion tons of fertile soil are lost. Arable land loss \r\nis estimated at 30 to 35 times the historical rate. In the \r\ndrylands, due to drought and desertification, 12 million \r\nhectares of land are transformed into new man-made \r\ndeserts every year. That is an area with the potential to \r\nproduce 20 million tons of grain.  \r\n Globally, land degradation directly affects \r\n1.5 billion people. It entrenches affected populations in \r\npoverty and hunger. For instance, when poverty is \r\nassessed in terms of infant mortality rate, 42 per cent \r\nof the very poor of the world live in degraded lands. \r\n Most certainly, land degradation is a global \r\nphenomenon, with 78 per cent of the degrading land \r\ntaking place in the non-dry lands. Degrading the buffer \r\nzone of the drylands increases their vulnerability to \r\ndegradation. Furthermore, land degradation is stressing \r\nthe world’s food production system and contributing to \r\nits vulnerability to climatic shocks. In an increasingly \r\ninterdependent world, land-related crises will mutate \r\ninto new global crises. \r\n As for drought, the percentage of Earth’s land \r\narea stricken by serious drought more than doubled \r\nfrom the 1970s to the early 2000s, and the world is \r\nfacing the possibility of widespread drought in the \r\ncoming decades; but this has yet to be fully recognized \r\nby the international community. Unfortunately, despite \r\nbeing predictable, drought in our time still implies \r\nfamine and claims lives. The tragic situation in the \r\nHorn of Africa is a stark reminder that we still have a \r\nlong way to go. \r\n Among the main challenges in implementing the \r\nConvention, low political recognition and the lack of \r\nmainstreaming in national strategic plans are foremost. \r\nHowever, addressing land degradation is not a burden \r\non public budgets, but rather a driving force for \r\nsustainable and inclusive economic development. \r\nAccording to a recent review, the cost of land \r\ndegradation in sub-Saharan Africa may be as much as \r\n10 per cent of national gross domestic products. \r\n A/66/PV.6\r\n \r\n5 11-50534 \r\n \r\n My main message is that to sustain life on Earth \r\nwe must build a land-degradation-neutral world. This \r\nwill involve a global commitment leading to effective \r\naction at all levels. Therefore I call for action. I urge \r\nthe leaders of our planet to adopt policy measures that \r\nwill lead to a paradigm shift in the way we manage our \r\nland resources. Through bold political decisions and \r\nwith the knowledge now available, we have the means \r\nto successfully address desertification, land \r\ndegradation and drought. This is the raison d’être of \r\nthe UNCCD. Through this process, hunger, poverty and \r\nfamine can become history. We can do this and we \r\nmust. I have no doubt that members will take the right \r\ndecisions and lead us accordingly. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I now give the \r\nfloor to the President of the ninth session of the \r\nConference of the Parties to the United Nations \r\nConvention to Combat Desertification, His Excellency \r\nMr. Alberto D’Alotto, Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs \r\nof Argentina. \r\n Mr. D’Alotto (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nThe topic before us today has enjoyed focused \r\ninternational attention this year, which has resulted in a \r\nbetter understanding at the global level of the \r\nimportance of developing coordinated actions to \r\ncombat this environmental, economic and social \r\nproblem in the context of sustainable development and \r\npoverty eradication. I hope that this meeting will \r\nincrease the engagement of the major actors on this \r\nissue at the highest institutional and political levels of \r\nthis Organization. It will be a particular challenge for \r\naffected countries to define their priorities in the \r\nstruggle in order to motivate the international \r\ncommunity towards increased participation and \r\ncooperation at the technical and financial levels. \r\n We face the major task of consolidating the \r\nefforts undertaken and progress made by States parties \r\nto the United Nations Convention to Combat \r\nDesertification. In particular, I would like to underline \r\nthe progress in some strategic issues for the \r\nConvention follow-up that took place under the \r\nArgentine Presidency of the ninth Conference of the \r\nParties, including the recognition of the Committee for \r\nthe Review of the Implementation of the Convention as \r\na permanent subsidiary body, which allowed the \r\nsubmission of the first reporting cycle after the 10-year \r\nstrategy 2008-2018. I also highlight the establishment \r\nof new methodologies through the implementation of \r\nthe performance review and assessment of \r\nimplementation system for periodical and reliable \r\ninformation and data collection and analysis, and for \r\nthe measurement and evaluation of trends of \r\ndesertification at the global, national and local levels. \r\n On the other hand, the institutional reform \r\nprocess within the Global Environment Facility has \r\nrecently allowed the allocation of financial resources \r\nfor the focal area on land degradation, transforming the \r\nFacility into the main financial mechanism of the \r\nConvention, increasing and broadening the continuity \r\nof relevant projects and initiatives. \r\n On the basis of these important landmarks in our \r\nConvention’s process, which took place under the \r\nArgentine presidency of ninth Conference of the \r\nParties, and with a view to tenth, it is necessary for the \r\ninternational community and States parties take more \r\nand better decisions to advance the fight against \r\ndesertification. To that end, it is necessary to have a \r\nframework to obtain scientific advice on issues \r\nrelevant to the Conference of the Parties, and which \r\nalso provides warning on possible crisis situations. \r\nHowever, that important technical advice should be \r\nrespectful of the political processes of the Convention, \r\nensuring that the recommendations are adopted by \r\nStates parties at the different decision-making levels. \r\n Argentina in particular has been deeply \r\ncommitted to the objectives of the Convention since \r\ntheir very beginning. This commitment is firmly \r\ndetermined by the geographic particularities of my \r\ncountry’s territory, 75 per cent of which is made up of \r\narid and semi-arid areas. These areas, however, \r\nproduce 50 per cent of the country’s wealth, generating \r\nimportant export credits that strengthen our economy, \r\nand pose a challenge in terms of sustainable \r\ndevelopment. In this respect, Argentina is fully \r\nconscious of the richness of these ecosystems from a \r\nproductive and cultural point of view, and of the \r\ngeneration of external benefits and their vulnerability \r\nto climate issues and human activities. \r\n For example, the National Action Programme to \r\nCombat Desertification is promoting local, productive \r\nsustainable development, the eradication of rural \r\npoverty and the creation of technology to control the \r\nadvance or reversal of desertification. Efforts are also \r\nbeing coordinated at the regional and subregional level, \r\nincluding the Gran Chaco Americano project and other \r\nprojects within MERCOSUR. \r\nA/66/PV.6  \r\n \r\n11-50534 6 \r\n \r\n This presidency believes that the Convention is \r\nthe best international legal instrument for developing \r\nmore and better tools for combating desertification, \r\nland degradation and drought, and that its principal \r\nobjective should be to improve the quality of life of the \r\naffected populations in arid, semi-arid and dry \r\nsub-humid areas, which are the subject of the \r\nConvention. \r\n I hope that our deliberations in this Meeting \r\nallow us to make progress in strengthening and \r\nenhancing the activities that are being carried out with \r\na view to improving the lives of the billions who live \r\nin areas affected by desertification in developing \r\ncountries, who are among the poorest in the world and \r\nwho are kept from achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, in particular those related to \r\nhunger, poverty and sustainable development. \r\n I will now speak on behalf of the Group of 77 and \r\nChina for this segment of the High-level Meeting. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n We welcome the convening of this debate today, \r\nand we would like to recall that desertification and \r\nland degradation affect all regions of the world and \r\ncontinue to pose a serious threat to sustainable \r\ndevelopment at the national, regional and global levels. \r\nWe would like to emphasize also that these issues have \r\nrepercussions on the functioning of the ecosystem and \r\nthe Earth’s system as a whole. \r\n We would like to stress that developing countries \r\nare the most affected by these phenomena. The present \r\nsituation of drylands in developing countries \r\nconstitutes a matter of utmost concern to the Group of \r\n77 (G-77) and China. With more than 1 billion \r\ninhabitants — who are among the poorest on the \r\nplanet — we are the most constrained in the \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals, in \r\nparticular those relating to hunger, poverty and \r\nenvironmental sustainability. \r\n The G-77 and China express their concern and \r\nsolidarity over the situation that the population in the \r\nHorn of Africa region is experiencing right now. They \r\nhave been hit by the worst drought in 60 years, which \r\nis leading to starvation and loss of crops and livestock. \r\nThis reflects well the severity of the drought and \r\ndesertification problems and the imperative for action. \r\n For the G-77 and China, the objective of this \r\nHigh-level Meeting should be to contribute to raising \r\nawareness of desertification, land degradation and \r\ndrought at the highest level, in line with the United \r\nNations Decade for Deserts and the Fight against \r\nDesertification (2010-2020).  \r\n Therefore, it is important to reaffirm the case for \r\nthe fulfilment of all commitments to the United \r\nNations Convention to Combat Desertification and its \r\n10-year strategic plan and framework, ensuring in this \r\nway a higher priority for desertification, land \r\ndegradation and drought on the international agenda \r\nand contributing to the preparations for the tenth \r\nsession of the Conference of the Parties to the United \r\nNations Convention to Combat Desertification and for \r\nthe United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, Rio+20. \r\n In this vein, it is worth remembering that that \r\nConference was first held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 to \r\nrespond to developing countries’ concerns and needs. \r\nIts objective was to combat desertification and mitigate \r\nthe effects of drought in countries experiencing serious \r\ndrought and/or desertification, particularly in Africa, \r\nand to do that through effective action at all levels, \r\nsupported by international cooperation, in the \r\nframework of an integrated approach that is consistent \r\nwith Agenda 21, with a view to contributing to the \r\nachievement of sustainable development in affected \r\nareas. Therefore, the focus should continue to be on the \r\nsituation in drylands, particularly in developing \r\ncountries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the \r\nCaribbean. \r\n Regarding the report submitted by the Secretariat \r\nof the Convention to Combat Desertification, the G-77 \r\nand China fully reiterate their preliminary comments \r\nand input to this background document, as expressed \r\nduring the informal consultations held on 23 May and \r\nsubmitted in writing on 23 and 30 May. \r\n A fundamental point of this debate is how to \r\nensure the full implementation of the Convention and \r\nthe 10-year strategic programme. For the G-77 and \r\nChina, this should be achieved in accordance with the \r\nprinciples and provisions of the relevant instruments on \r\nsustainable development, in particular, principles 2 and \r\n7 of the Rio Declaration: the sovereign right of States \r\nto exploit their own resources pursuant to their own \r\nenvironmental and developmental policies, and \r\ncommon but differentiated responsibilities. \r\n May I here recall that the multilateral framework \r\nof the Convention requires international cooperation \r\n A/66/PV.6\r\n \r\n7 11-50534 \r\n \r\nand that the application of the principle of common but \r\ndifferentiated responsibilities demands that developed \r\ncountries provide new, additional, predictable and \r\nstable financing, transfer of technology and capacity-\r\nbuilding for the implementation of actions on the \r\nground. \r\n Also, national action plans to combat \r\ndesertification are programmes designed for activities \r\nrelated to the fight against desertification, as mandated \r\nby the Convention. \r\n Therefore, the Group of 77 and China expect the \r\nsummary of this meeting to reflect national strategies \r\nor programmes and the importance for developing \r\ncountries to receive technical and financial support \r\nfrom the international community to adequately \r\nimplement them, within the framework of the \r\nConvention.  We should also stress the important \r\nrole that regional coordination mechanisms must play, \r\nas established by the Parties, to support the \r\nimplementation of regional annexes of the Convention \r\nto complement international support. \r\n The Group is of the view that the Convention to \r\nCombat Desertification is lagging behind the \r\nachievements of the other Rio Conventions, namely the \r\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange and the Convention on Biodiversity. A strong \r\nand clear political message should emerge from this \r\nhigh-level segment, reflecting that the Convention on \r\nDesertification must be put on equal footing and \r\ntreated with the same importance as the Biodiversity \r\nConvention and the Climate Change Convention, and \r\npolitical support from developed countries to \r\ndeveloping countries should be guaranteed. \r\n It is vital to enhance cooperation among the Rio \r\nConventions while respecting their individual \r\nmandates, out of concern over the negative impacts \r\nthat desertification, land degradation, loss of \r\nbiodiversity and climate change have on each other and \r\nrecognizing the potential benefits of complementarities \r\nin addressing these problems in a mutually supportive \r\nmanner. \r\n The G-77 and China support the establishment \r\nand strengthening of existing disaster management \r\ncapacities at all levels, including information and early \r\nwarning systems that allow effective management of \r\nthe risks associated with drought, desertification and \r\nland degradation and of the adverse impacts of climate \r\nchange. \r\n Poverty, food security and desertification are \r\nintrinsically linked to each other and need to be tackled \r\njointly. Therefore, desertification, land degradation and \r\ndrought should be addressed not only in terms of \r\nenvironmental impacts and economic growth but also \r\nin terms of their social impacts, recognizing the causes \r\nof desertification and the need to have a socially \r\ninclusive approach, and addressing inequalities. \r\n Considering the impact of trade and relevant \r\naspects of international economic relations on \r\ndesertification and land degradation, we shall promote \r\na universal, rules-based, open, non-discriminatory and \r\nequitable multilateral trading system, recognizing the \r\nprinciple of special and differential treatment for \r\ndeveloping countries, focused on providing preferential \r\naccess to products from developing countries and \r\navoiding the implementation of trade protectionism and \r\nother trade-distorting measures. Subsidies applied in \r\ndeveloped countries not only distort international trade \r\nbut also lead to the over-exploitation of natural \r\nresources and, consequently, to land degradation. \r\n We look forward to engaging in a constructive \r\nand meaningful debate today that pays due attention to \r\nthe issues raised by developing countries and finds a \r\nway to address them effectively. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I now give the \r\nfloor to the incoming President of the tenth session of \r\nthe Conference of the Parties to the United Nations \r\nConvention to Combat Desertification, His Excellency \r\nMr. Lee Don Koo, who is also Minister of Forest \r\nService in the Republic of Korea. \r\n Mr. Lee Don Koo (Republic of Korea): I am \r\ntruly honoured to have this opportunity to deliver an \r\naddress at this important High-level Meeting of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. I am particularly delighted to be \r\njoined by distinguished leaders from all over the world.  \r\n We are gathering here at the Assembly’s sixty-\r\nsixth session to deal with the very important theme of \r\n“Addressing desertification, land degradation and \r\ndrought in the context of sustainable development and \r\npoverty eradication”. I believe that the presence of \r\nthose gathered here today signifies their utmost interest \r\nin examining the gravity of the issue. \r\n Today, more than 12 million hectares of land are \r\nbeing lost every year to desertification, land \r\ndegradation and drought. Three billion people are now \r\nin a state of serious poverty and one third of them live \r\nA/66/PV.6  \r\n \r\n11-50534 8 \r\n \r\nin drylands, as evidenced in the UNDP study “The \r\nForgotten Billion”. Previously, the issue of \r\ndesertification, land degradation and drought failed to \r\nreceive the international attention it deserves and was \r\nconsidered only as the problem of those in drylands.  \r\n We have also witnessed the devastating and \r\ntransboundary impacts of desertification, land \r\ndegradation and drought, such as frequent floods, dust \r\nand sandstorms, landslides, loss of biodiversity and \r\nclimate change. Hence, as this issue is increasingly \r\nrecognized as an impending global concern, we need a \r\nnew way of thinking. \r\n Land and soil are the property not only of the \r\npresent generation but also of future generations. We \r\nhave the responsibility to use them in a sustainable way \r\nso as to enable our descendants to enjoy the benefits of \r\nhealthy and productive ecosystems. Recognizing that \r\nfor all generations land is indispensable to sustain \r\ndecent lives, we need to reverse the history of \r\nnegligence and shed new light on desertification, land \r\ndegradation and drought. Thus, we need to find ways to \r\npromote the socio-economic benefits of the land and \r\nensure conservation of the environment at the same \r\ntime. That will require a paradigm shift from a growth-\r\ndriven economy to a “green growth economy”. \r\n A new growth paradigm in Republic of Korea \r\nwas put forth by President Lee Myung-bak in 2008, in \r\npursuit of green growth and adaptation to and \r\nmitigation of climate change. President Lee Myung-bak \r\npledged to exert himself for the country to achieve that, \r\nwhich led to the development of new polices on green \r\ngrowth nationwide. \r\n Sustainable land management incorporating green \r\ngrowth would be an efficient and pragmatic approach \r\nto address desertification, land degradation and drought \r\nand improve long-term benefits from the environment. \r\nTo succeed in sustainable land management, a long-\r\nterm approach is needed, as it cannot be achieved in a \r\nshort period of time.  \r\n I would also like to stress that green growth \r\nencompasses ecosystemic development, which is a new \r\neconomic mechanism designed to encourage pro-poor \r\npolicies at global, regional and national levels. A \r\ncritical component of this is a win-win growth strategy \r\nthat can enable both countries affected by \r\ndesertification, land degradation and drought and \r\ndeveloped countries to achieve a sustainable society \r\nthrough sustainable development. \r\n I believe Korea can set a good example for \r\naffected countries. Its history of successful \r\nreforestation demonstrated well that sustainable land \r\nmanagement can serve as a first step to break the \r\ndilemma of poverty, desertification, land degradation \r\nand drought. From the last of the nineteenth century \r\nuntil the mid-twentieth century, Korea was trapped in \r\npoverty and went through a chaotic period. However, \r\nwith all-out efforts by the Government and people \r\nalike, we overcame the crisis and were able to establish \r\na solid foundation for sustainable development through \r\nremarkable rehabilitation of degraded lands. \r\n Mr. Zinsou (Benin), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n Truly, the challenges ahead of us are daunting and \r\ncannot be dealt with easily. Let us remain bold, \r\nambitious and creative to end the desertification, land \r\ndegradation and drought that generate poverty and \r\nundermine sustainable development. We need a \r\nconcerted effort and strengthened political commitment \r\nto join forces and mobilize the available resources. It is \r\ncrucial to promote global partnerships, not only to \r\ncombat desertification, land degradation and drought \r\nbut also to move forward into a sustainable \r\ninternational community in which everyone can obtain \r\na decent life, regardless of nationality, age and gender. \r\n With the convening of the tenth session of the \r\nConference of the Parties to the United Nations \r\nConvention to Combat Desertification — COP 10 — in \r\nKorea, I hope that all here can participate in this \r\nsignificant event to discuss how we can solve in unison \r\nthe dismal problems brought by desertification, land \r\ndegradation and drought. It is worth pointing out that \r\nthe first Business Forum on Sustainable Land \r\nManagement will be launched on l7 and 18 October at \r\nthe COP 10. It aims to encourage greater involvement \r\nand participation in promoting sustainable land \r\nmanagement activities on the part of civil society and \r\nbusiness people. I believe that the valuable \r\nparticipation and support of all here will greatly \r\ncontribute to the success of COP 10 in Korea. I look \r\nforward to welcoming all. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Andris Piebalgs, European \r\nCommissioner for Development of the European \r\nUnion. \r\n Mr. Piebalgs (European Union): I have the \r\nhonour to speak on behalf of the European Union (EU) \r\n A/66/PV.6\r\n \r\n9 11-50534 \r\n \r\nand its member States. Croatia, the former Yugoslav \r\nRepublic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Iceland, Albania, \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Ukraine and the \r\nRepublic of Moldova align themselves with this \r\ndeclaration. \r\n We welcome this high-level event and the \r\nopportunity it provides us to turn our attention to this \r\ncritical issue facing the global community. The issue of \r\ndesertification and land degradation is one of the most \r\nserious threats to the livelihoods of the poorest people \r\nin developing countries today, where subsistence and \r\nprospects for improvement are based on the sustainable \r\nexploitation of natural resources. This problem not \r\nonly has serious economic and environmental \r\nconsequences; it also has significant political and \r\nsocial effects. \r\n These problems, however, are not limited to \r\ndeveloping countries; they have reached global \r\ndimensions. Within the European Union itself, \r\n12 member States have declared themselves affected \r\ncountries with substantial areas already subject to land \r\ndegradation. In its current capacity as presidency of the \r\nEuropean Union, Poland will continue to work actively \r\nin the areas of climate change, green economies and \r\nland degradation issues within the EU.  \r\n In order to address these challenges, there is a \r\nneed for coherent policies, including those that \r\nformulate measures for affected countries aimed at \r\ntackling the problems at an early stage. At the same \r\ntime, we need to recognize that pressures linked to \r\ngrowing populations, food insecurity and water \r\nshortages are often drivers of unsustainable land-use \r\npractices. Addressing land degradation and \r\ndesertification also has significant benefits, with \r\nincreased agricultural yields and enhanced ecosystem \r\nservices. \r\n In their external policies, the European Union and \r\nits member States have highlighted the importance of \r\nsustainable land-management policies that contribute \r\nto poverty alleviation and food security in the long \r\nterm. The European Union funds a broad range of \r\nactions and programmes designed to address land \r\ndegradation in developing countries. They promote \r\nsustainable land-management techniques that take into \r\naccount local and regional conditions and seek to \r\ncombine traditional knowledge with new and emerging \r\ntechnologies. Key examples of regional initiatives in \r\nAfrica are the Sahara and Sahel Observatory; \r\nTerrAfrica, the Sub-Sahara-wide framework that \r\npromotes sustainable land management; and the Great \r\nGreen Wall initiative of the Sahara and the Sahel, all of \r\nwhich are aimed at mitigating the risk of desertification \r\nwhile at the same time alleviating poverty. \r\n The importance of land as a key resource has \r\nbeen highlighted in preparations for next year’s United \r\nNations Conference on Sustainable Development \r\n(Rio+20) in Rio de Janeiro. Rio+20 offers a unique \r\nopportunity to secure a renewed political commitment \r\nto sustainable development. In that framework, \r\ninvesting in sustainable land management is an integral \r\npart of achieving the shift to a green economy. In that \r\ncontext, we actively support the initiative on the \r\neconomics of land degradation as a means of \r\ndeveloping a clearer understanding of the full costs of \r\nland degradation. The global study aims to raise \r\nawareness of this issue and help policymakers \r\nimplement effective strategies to address the problem, \r\nas well as to set out the incentives for private-sector \r\ninvestment in sustainable land-management policies. \r\n Today, environmental and development \r\nchallenges are linked. Sustainable land management \r\nhas become vitally important, representing the missing \r\nlink needed to tackle climate change, biodiversity loss \r\nand food insecurity. In that regard, the clear shared \r\nobjectives among the three Rio conventions and the \r\nimportance of taking coordinated action must be \r\nrecognized.  \r\n As part of our commitment to the United Nations \r\nConvention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), \r\ntogether with the scientific community and civil \r\nsociety, we are ready to support improvement of the \r\nknowledge base on desertification and land degradation \r\nworldwide and to enable affected developing countries \r\nto implement national action plans. In that regard, the \r\neffective implementation of the UNCCD 10-year \r\nstrategic plan (see ICCD/COP(8)/16/Add.1) is crucial, \r\nas is effective cooperation between the Convention \r\nbodies. \r\n The European Union and its member States look \r\nforward to the forthcoming tenth Conference of the \r\nParties to the UNCCD (COP-10), which will take place \r\nin Changwon, Republic of Korea, next month. Coming \r\nat a key moment, less than a year before Rio+20, COP-10 \r\nis an opportunity to establish a new, concerted \r\napproach in order to enable us to effectively meet the \r\nA/66/PV.6  \r\n \r\n11-50534 10 \r\n \r\nchallenges of desertification and land degradation that \r\nthe world faces today. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Jato Sillah, Minister for Forestry \r\nand the Environment of the Gambia, who will speak on \r\nbehalf of the African States. \r\n Mr. Sillah (Gambia): It is my pleasure and great \r\npersonal privilege to deliver this statement on behalf of \r\nthe African Group on the occasion of the High-level \r\nMeeting on the theme “Addressing desertification, land \r\ndegradation and drought in the context of sustainable \r\ndevelopment and poverty eradication”. First, the Group \r\naligns itself with the statement delivered by the \r\nrepresentative of Argentina on behalf of the Group of \r\n77 and China. \r\n Desertification is a global issue, with serious \r\nimplications for worldwide eco-safety, food security, \r\nsocio-economic stability and sustainable development. \r\nAmong the countries most affected are the African \r\nnations, which face serious difficulties in combating \r\ndesertification, land degradation and meeting the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). The high \r\nlevel of rural poverty in many developing countries, \r\nparticularly in Africa, continues to be among the most \r\nserious constraints on progress in combating \r\ndesertification and land degradation.  \r\n At the same time, these problems exacerbate rural \r\npoverty in affected developing countries. We would \r\nlike to stress that while every developing country is \r\naffected by these phenomena, the present situation of \r\nthe drylands constitutes a matter of the utmost concern. \r\nWith more than 1 billion inhabitants who are among \r\nthe poorest on the planet, the African continent is the \r\nmost constrained in its efforts to achieve the MDGs, \r\nparticularly those relating to hunger, poverty and \r\nenvironmental sustainability. \r\n This High-level Meeting therefore provides an \r\nopportunity to articulate and propose solutions to the \r\ndifficulties encountered in fulfilling the commitments \r\nmade during the World Summit on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment and other related conferences and \r\nmeetings. In this regard, we emphasize the importance \r\nof identifying the specific means of implementation \r\nthat will enable developing countries, including those \r\nin Africa, to derive benefit from their commitments. \r\nThis has become very urgent in light of the need to \r\nnarrow the increasing gap between developed and \r\ndeveloping countries. \r\n Desertification and land degradation affect all \r\nregions of the world and continue to pose a serious \r\nthreat to sustainable development at the national, \r\nregional and global levels. Poverty, food insecurity and \r\ndesertification are intricately linked and must be \r\ntackled jointly. \r\n The present situation of the drylands in \r\ndeveloping countries — whose more than 1 billion \r\ninhabitants are among the poorest people on the \r\nplanet — has constrained their efforts to achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, in particular those \r\ngoals related to hunger, poverty and environmental \r\nsustainability.  \r\n African countries remain committed to fulfilling \r\ntheir obligations under all multilateral agreements. \r\nHowever, the results achieved so far have been limited \r\nby the challenges posed by a number of global crises \r\nthat have negatively impacted development and \r\nenvironmental efforts in the continent. \r\n In addition to those issues, the continent \r\ncontinues to grapple with obstacles resulting from a \r\nbasic lack of technology transfer and the inability to \r\nbuild and develop institutional capacities and enhance \r\nits human resources endowment, which, among other \r\nthings, has suffered repeated forced displacement and \r\nthe migration of highly qualified people to other \r\nregions. That phenomenon must be resolved through \r\nconcerted efforts.  \r\n It is clear that the African Group needs a \r\nscientific panel to advise it on taking the United \r\nNations Convention to Combat Desertification \r\n(UNCCD) forward. That applies to the entire UNCCD; \r\nwe definitely need a scientific panel. \r\n In this regard, we firmly call upon all parties to \r\nfully support the implementation of the United Nations \r\nConvention to Combat Desertification in all its aspects, \r\nin particular by promoting the exchange of knowledge \r\non best practices and lessons learned through global \r\nand regional cooperation on combating desertification, \r\nland degradation and drought. Emphasis should also be \r\nplaced on mobilizing and channelling adequate and \r\npredictable financial resources, as well as on \r\nfacilitating their direct access in order to help mitigate \r\nthe effects of desertification, land degradation and \r\ndrought and to improve the livelihoods of vulnerable \r\npeople affected by these most urgent matters at the \r\nnational, subregional and regional levels. \r\n A/66/PV.6\r\n \r\n11 11-50534 \r\n \r\n The 10-year strategic plan and framework \r\nadopted at the eighth session of the Conference of the \r\nParties to the UNCCD has strengthened the \r\ncommitment of the international community to \r\nimplement the Convention at all levels. It has enabled \r\nthe Convention to be more broadly engagement at the \r\nfront line in combating desertification and land \r\ndegradation, mitigating the effects of drought and \r\ncontributing to the fight against climate change. In that \r\nrespect, the UNCCD serves as a platform for adapting \r\nto climate change, mitigating its effects and \r\nstrengthening resilience.  \r\n With respect to strengthened synergies among the \r\nthree relevant Conventions, enhancing coordinated \r\nactions and opportunities of mutual benefit must be \r\nstrongly encouraged efforts to combat desertification, \r\npreserve dryland ecosystems, conserve wet lands and \r\ncombat climate change. It must be acknowledged that \r\ndesertification, land degradation and drought are \r\nchallenges of a cross-sector nature and global \r\ndimension because they affect all regions of the world. \r\nThus, all relevant United Nations organizations and \r\nagencies and all parties concerned must cooperate with \r\nall stakeholders in supporting an effective global \r\nresponse to those grave and profound problems with a \r\nview to mitigating their effects and negative impact on \r\nthe environment and the global economy. \r\n To this end, the Group of African States reaffirms \r\nits commitment to initiatives such as the Johannesburg \r\nPlan of Implementation of the World Summit on \r\nSustainable Development and its 2008-2018 10-year \r\nstrategic plan and framework to enhance \r\nimplementation of the Convention, which is recognized \r\nas one of the tools for poverty eradication. The Group \r\nalso stresses its deep concern over the negative impacts \r\nthat desertification, land degradation, loss of \r\nbiodiversity and climate change have on each other, \r\nand recognizes the potential benefits of \r\ncomplementarity in addressing those challenges \r\nthrough collective and effective action at all levels in a \r\nmutually supportive manner. \r\n Africa is the most vulnerable and disadvantaged \r\ncontinent in the context of achieving the goals of \r\nsocio-economic development. We therefore stress the \r\nimportance of the international community fulfilling its \r\ncommitments to supporting Africa in its efforts, as was \r\npromised at the World Summit on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment. Equally important is the urgent need to \r\nmatch promises with actual delivery on the assurances \r\ncontained in the political declaration on Africa’s \r\ndevelopment needs under the New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development, and the conclusions reached by \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals Africa Steering \r\nGroup. \r\n We stress that the provision of sufficient and \r\npredictable funding, the transfer of environmentally \r\nsound technologies, and support and encouragement \r\naimed at building the human and institutional \r\ncapacities of African countries will contribute \r\nsignificantly to achievement of the desired goals in the \r\nfields being considered at this High-level Meeting. \r\nInternational development cooperation can play a \r\ncritical role in mobilizing resources for investment in \r\nthe fight against desertification and land degradation \r\nand in improved technology and technology transfer to \r\npromote rural development. In this respect, we also \r\nunderline the importance of increasing the quantity and \r\nquality of official development assistance, and of \r\nreducing or cancelling outright the external debt in \r\nfavour of the neediest African countries. \r\n As we all know, the African Union is the flagship \r\norganization for harmonizing and coordinating \r\ncontinental programmes in Africa. Despite the progress \r\nmade in developing policies at regional and \r\nsubregional levels, the implementation gap in Africa \r\nremains wide. We therefore call for the strengthening \r\nof support and encouragement of plans and \r\nprogrammes of the African Union and the regional \r\neconomic communities to ensure the effective transfer \r\nof policies and programmes into concrete measures, \r\nespecially in the field of sustainable development. \r\nEnsuring equitable access by farmers to regional and \r\nglobal markets, and providing practical help and \r\ncapacity-building to those stakeholders in marketing \r\nagricultural products is essential to their willingness to \r\ninvest in long-term sustainable land management, since \r\nthey would then be able to reap the future rewards of \r\nsuch investment. \r\n As we all know, forests play an important role in \r\npreventing both desertification and land degradation as \r\nwell as in rehabilitating degraded lands. The \r\nimplementation of the non-legally binding instrument \r\non all types of forests, adopted by the General \r\nAssembly in 2007 (resolution 62/98, annex), provides a \r\nframework for advancing sustainable forest \r\nmanagement and will contribute to combating \r\ndesertification, mitigating climate change and \r\npreserving forest biological diversity. \r\nA/66/PV.6  \r\n \r\n11-50534 12 \r\n \r\n Finally, integrating action programmes to combat \r\ndesertification into development frameworks will serve \r\nas practical tool in combating desertification and \r\nimplementing the UNCCD. Given that desertification \r\ncuts across all sectors, it is essential to ensure \r\ncoordination among all relevant Government agencies \r\nat central and local levels in the implementation of \r\nnational action plans, with the active involvement of \r\ncivil society. It is therefore important to mainstream \r\nsuch actions plans within national development \r\nstrategies and poverty reduction plans. Strengthening \r\nthe support of the international community through \r\nbilateral, regional and subregional cooperation will \r\nremain crucial for implementing action programmes to \r\ncombat desertification and land degradation. \r\n The implementation of national action plans \r\nshould be based on integrated approaches and \r\nsupported by legislation. The modes of economic \r\ngrowth and means of production and consumption must \r\nbe improved in order to achieve harmony between \r\nconservation and development, as well as a balance \r\nbetween economic and social benefits.  \r\n In conclusion, the African Group attaches great \r\nimportance to the role of the United Nations \r\nCommission on Sustainable Development. We should \r\ncontinue to provide guidance and coordination on \r\nissues related to the integration of the three dimensions \r\nof socio-economic development, and more importantly, \r\nthe means of their implementation.  \r\n The Acting President: I give the floor to \r\nMr. Rajiv Shah, Administrator of the United States \r\nAgency for International Development, who will speak \r\nin his capacity as the representative of the host country. \r\n Mr. Shah (United States of America): It is my \r\nhonour to join the General Assembly today in focusing \r\non the global challenges of drought, desertification and \r\nland degradation. Right now, these dangerous realities \r\nare threatening the lives and livelihoods of over \r\n1 billion people who live in fragile dryland ecosystems. \r\nThey severely limit our collective goals of promoting \r\nsustainable development, eradicating poverty and \r\nstrengthening food security. They also limit and \r\nthreaten our national security. \r\n Nowhere is this challenge more critical and the \r\nneed for action more pressing than in the Horn of \r\nAfrica. There, the devastating consequences of famine \r\nare playing out before our eyes in the stories of women \r\nwho have to watch their children literally die in their \r\narms. We know that the Horn of Africa is experiencing \r\nits worst drought in 60 years, and that 3.3 million \r\npeople — predominately women and children — are in \r\nneed of emergency assistance. As the single largest \r\nhumanitarian and development partner in the region, \r\nthe United States is supporting life-saving aid, \r\nincluding food, water and medicines, for millions of \r\npeople.  \r\n Although the American people will always \r\nprovide aid in times of urgent need, emergency \r\nassistance is not the most efficient or lasting solution. \r\nThe reality is that we must do more to prevent these \r\ncrises in the first place. That is why President Obama \r\nlaunched a global food security initiative called “Feed \r\nthe Future” to help countries develop their own \r\nresilient agricultural sectors and food systems so they \r\ncan feed themselves over the long term. \r\n Through these partnerships, Kenya has seen a \r\nmore than 300 per cent increase in maize yields in \r\ncertain western parts of the country, while vitamin \r\nA-enriched sweet potatoes are now reaching hundreds \r\nof thousands of malnourished children in Uganda, \r\nMozambique and other parts of sub-Saharan Africa. \r\n These achievements are the result of collective \r\naction. African Governments, the private sector, civil \r\nsociety and local farmers — mostly women — are \r\nincreasing their investments in agriculture, adopting \r\nnew innovations and technologies, and measuring \r\nresults. \r\n We believe that this new form of partnership \r\nextends through to the United Nations Convention to \r\nCombat Desertification. The United States strongly \r\nsupports the Convention and its clear mandate to focus \r\non drylands to enable better results. Addressing \r\ndesertification through long-term, sustainable land \r\nmanagement and agricultural development is one of the \r\nmost effective tools we have to prevent the crises that \r\nwe are now seeing throughout the Horn and in other \r\nvulnerable regions.  \r\n In fact, as a nation, we have a long history of \r\ngrappling with the devastating consequences of soil \r\ndegradation and severe drought. As we speak, the State \r\nof Texas is enduring one of the worst one-year \r\ndroughts in recorded history. In the 1930s, a prolonged \r\ncatastrophe of drought, land degradation and food \r\nshortage led to the American Dust Bowl, resulting in \r\nthe migration of 2.5 million people. As a result of our \r\nexperiences, the United States fundamentally reformed \r\n A/66/PV.6\r\n \r\n13 11-50534 \r\n \r\nour strategies and methods of dryland management. We \r\nstrengthened collaboration between local Governments \r\nand farmers, invested in agricultural universities to \r\nfoster scientific innovations in farming practices and \r\nwater management, and embarked on larger-scale \r\nefforts to manage our productive lands more \r\nsustainably. \r\n An aggressive focus on science and improved \r\ntechnology has been a vital part of our approach. \r\nTherefore, the United States supports the proposed \r\nintergovernmental science policy platform on \r\nbiodiversity and ecosystem services, which will cover \r\ndryland ecosystems as opposed to a separate, narrower \r\nscience mechanism devoted solely to the Convention.  \r\n We remain committed to harnessing the power of \r\nscience and technology to help transform global \r\nagriculture and improve the quality of natural \r\nresources. Across the international community, we now \r\nhave the knowledge to establish stable, productive \r\nenvironments, dramatically improve crop yields, \r\nmitigate natural disasters and deliver results for \r\nvulnerable, often small-scale farm households.  \r\n In order to meet the challenge of poverty and \r\nhunger around the world, we have to invest in long-\r\nterm solutions through “Feed the Future”, focusing on \r\nconnecting smallholder farmers to strong markets and \r\nharnessing advances in science and technology. As \r\nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton has said, “The \r\nquestion is not whether we can end hunger; it is \r\nwhether we will”. \r\n That is why “Feed the Future” is driving a new \r\napproach to global food security. In Tanzania, we are \r\nworking in partnership with Governments, companies \r\nand other donors to make major investments in the \r\nSouthern Agricultural Growth Corridor of that country. \r\nIn regions vulnerable to drought — like the Ethiopian \r\nhighlands — we are focusing particularly on drought-\r\nresistant crops and improved soil, water and land \r\nmanagement. \r\n These efforts build on 40 years of experience the \r\nUnited States Government and the United States \r\nAgency for International Development have had in \r\ngreening the Sahel, where farmer led agroforestry and \r\nwater management techniques have transformed \r\n50 million hectares threatened by desertification — an \r\narea larger than Sweden — into sustainably productive \r\nlands. \r\n We welcome ongoing collaboration with the \r\nglobal community to help address the crisis in the \r\nHorn, and continue in particular to call on Al-Shabaab \r\nto allow unfettered humanitarian access in areas it \r\ncontrols. Hundreds of thousands of lives are at stake.  \r\n But responding to the crisis today is not only a \r\nmoral imperative; it also protects our national and \r\nglobal security. In regions where we witness scarcity of \r\nresources today, we are more prone to face heightened \r\ntensions and conflicts tomorrow. By fighting drought \r\nand famine in the Horn today, we fight the despair that \r\ncan lead people towards violence and terrorism. When \r\nwe can help a nation feed itself through good times and \r\nbad, we break the cycle of food riots, famines and \r\nfailed States that creates instability throughout our \r\nworld. When we help a woman farmer use cutting-edge \r\ntechnologies to increase her harvests, we expand her \r\ncountry’s economic potential and develop new markets \r\nfor international trade. And by providing help in times \r\nof desperate need, we express globally shared values of \r\ncompassion, dignity and equality. \r\n The Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker for the opening segment of the High-level \r\nMeeting.  \r\n As members are aware, pursuant to resolution \r\n65/160, this High-level Meeting will comprise opening \r\nand closing plenary meetings as well as two panel \r\ndiscussions. The first panel will take place this \r\nmorning in Conference Room 4 of the North Lawn \r\nBuilding, immediately after the adjournment of this \r\nopening segment.  \r\n  The meeting rose at 11 a.m. \r\n"
