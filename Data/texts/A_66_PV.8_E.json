(Qatar) \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 3:10 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nHigh-level Meeting of the General Assembly on the \r\nPrevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases \r\n \r\nAgenda item 117 (continued) \r\n \r\nFollow-up to the outcome of the Millennium Summit \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): As previously \r\nannounced, the Assembly will first hear presentations \r\nby the co-Chairs of the three round tables of the High-\r\nlevel Meeting, followed by a statement by the Mayor \r\nof New York City. \r\n I now give the floor to His Excellency \r\nMr. Andrew Lansley, Secretary of State for Health of \r\nthe United Kingdom and co-Chair of round table 1. \r\n Mr. Lansley (United Kingdom) It is my honour \r\nto present the outcome of round table 1, which met \r\nyesterday to address the rising incidence, the \r\ndevelopmental and other challenges, and the social and \r\neconomic impact of non-communicable diseases \r\n(NCDs) and their risk factors. \r\n A total of 38 contributions were made by national \r\ndelegations, by non-governmental organizations and by \r\ninternational intergovernmental organizations. There \r\nwas a common sense of urgency and a very honest \r\nacknowledgment of the size of the burdens we face. \r\nShared views emerged of the best ways to tackle these \r\nproblems. Alongside the Political Declaration \r\n(resolution 66/2, annex) adopted at this High-level \r\nMeeting, the Moscow Declaration on healthy lifestyles \r\nand NCDs was widely recognized as a visionary \r\ndocument for the prevention and control of NCDs. \r\n Participants were clear about the scale of the \r\nproblem. NCDs, including cardiovascular disease, \r\ncancers, diabetes and chronic lung disease, are today \r\nthe leading causes of death and disease worldwide. \r\nThey share four major causative risk factors: tobacco \r\nuse, unhealthy diet, lack of physical activity and the \r\nharmful use of alcohol. \r\n We heard of the need — indeed the shared \r\nresponsibility — to acknowledge the magnitude of the \r\nNCD challenge and to act now. Some 300 million lives \r\nhave been lost since the call for Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals Plus was made a decade ago. Our \r\nround table noted that low- and middle-income \r\ncountries are experiencing faster growth and \r\ncompressed timelines for mounting an effective \r\nresponse to the threat of NCDs. There is a common \r\nexperience across low- and middle-income countries of \r\na rising tide of NCDs, particularly over the past three \r\ndecades. \r\n Many of these countries are now suffering from a \r\ndouble burden of disease, infectious and \r\nnon-communicable, which are hitting already \r\noverstretched public health services hard. To enable us \r\nto respond, a stronger information and research basis is \r\nrequired. There is still insufficient statistical data on \r\nNCDs, particularly in low- and middle-income \r\ncountries, where current capacities for surveillance of \r\nNCDs are often inadequate. \r\nA/66/PV.8  \r\n \r\n11-50546 2 \r\n \r\n The rapidly increasing burden of NCDs in low- \r\nand middle-income countries over the past decade has \r\nremained relatively hidden. A large proportion of \r\npeople at high risk remain undiagnosed in low- and \r\nmiddle-income countries, and even those diagnosed \r\nhave insufficient access to treatment at the primary \r\nhealth-care level. We therefore need stronger \r\nsurveillance to map and monitor NCDs and their risk \r\nfactors and determinants as an integral part of national \r\nhealth information systems, not least because \r\nmonitoring provides the foundation for advocacy, \r\npolicy development and global and national action. \r\n But there is not only a human burden from those \r\ndiseases; there is also a significant economic one, as \r\nDirector-General Margaret Chan told us yesterday. We \r\nheard how NCDs are reducing productivity in \r\nworkforces. Around 30 per cent of deaths due to NCDs \r\nin low- and middle-income countries occur during \r\nworking age, compared to only 13 per cent in high-\r\nincome countries. As a result, nations are experiencing \r\nincreased health-care costs, weakened national \r\neconomic development and, ultimately, negative \r\nimpacts on gross domestic product. \r\n As Commissioner John Dalli pointed out, NCDs \r\nreduce people’s ability to work while they are still in \r\nthe prime of life. With a substantial proportion of \r\nhousehold income being spent on health care in low-\r\nincome countries, there is a double impact of high \r\nhealth-care costs and reduced household incomes. \r\nCosts for NCD-related health care, medicines, tobacco \r\nand alcohol displace household resources that might \r\notherwise be available, for example, for education. \r\n There are already people dying unnecessarily \r\nbefore their time. All our speakers were clear. We \r\ncannot delay developing our health systems to deal \r\nwith this rising tide. We must strengthen health \r\nsystems across the board for communicable and \r\nnon-communicable diseases alike, with a particular \r\nemphasis on primary care. We need specialized human \r\nresources in health systems. Health workers need to be \r\nrecruited, trained and retained in order to recognize, \r\nassess and manage NCDs. Issues of universal coverage \r\nand financial sustainability must be addressed as part \r\nof an overall approach, and we need to build and \r\nstrengthen capacity for research and development. The \r\nexperience of programmes like those for HIV/AIDS \r\nand malaria show the power of bringing to bear global \r\ncooperation and innovation on a health problem. \r\n At the same time, we need health systems not \r\nsimply to treat disease but to be reoriented towards \r\npreventive action — preventing the onset of disease \r\nrather than merely treating the symptoms, working \r\nproactively to avoid costs, both human and economic, \r\nrather than feeling the impact on the household and \r\ntaxpayer purse. \r\n For example, we heard about the clear linkages \r\nbetween maternal and child health and non-communicable \r\ndiseases. Not only is improper nutrition during \r\npregnancy associated with stillbirths and pre-term \r\nbirths, but it also leads to higher rates of diabetes and \r\nhigh blood pressure later in life. In turn, high blood \r\npressure and gestational diabetes present serious risks \r\nto both the mother and the baby.  \r\n NCDs are also a gender issue. There is a wide \r\ndisparity in risk of NCDs between men and women, \r\ndifferences in access to diagnosis and treatment, and \r\nlinkages with the empowerment of women and the \r\neducation of girls. It was also noted that the burden of \r\ncaring is unequally shared between women and men. \r\n At our round table, we heard calls to strengthen \r\npolitical commitment at the highest levels of \r\ngovernment. A range of sectors needs to be involved: \r\nagriculture, education, transportation, urban design \r\nand — beyond Government — academia, civil society, \r\nthe private sector, religious leaders, and the community \r\nas a whole. \r\n This shared responsibility should mean, as our \r\ncolleague from Guyana told us, that it is time now to \r\nbe aggressive, not timid. We must integrate NCD \r\nprevention and control into national and global \r\nsustainable and human development agendas. Many \r\ndelegations emphasized the importance of healthy \r\nbehaviours and raising public awareness.  \r\n However, as His Excellency the President of \r\nNauru, noted, lifestyle change is difficult. Responses \r\npresented include a wide range of schemes, such as \r\nschool-based food and nutritional programmes, \r\nreformulation of foods, tobacco control, regulation of \r\nmarketing and infrastructures for promoting physical \r\nactivity, as Mr. Jacques Rogge, from the International \r\nOlympic Committee, reminded us. \r\n Strong appeals were made that there should be \r\ncoordinated investment internationally in tackling \r\nNCDs alongside, and not detrimental to, the work \r\nalready proving successful on infectious diseases. \r\n A/66/PV.8\r\n \r\n3 11-50546 \r\n \r\nFurthermore, action on NCDs should not focus solely \r\non the big killers, but must also recognize and give \r\nsufficient weight to needs in mental health, oral health, \r\nmusculoskeletal disorders, violence and injuries and \r\nsickle-cell disease. \r\n Contributors were equally clear that, as we \r\ndevelop targeted strategies on particular conditions or \r\nrisk factors, we must see the bigger picture of what \r\ndrives disease prevalence. We need to act on the social \r\ndeterminants of health. Participants recognized the \r\nclear link between those social factors and higher \r\nlevels of mortality and morbidity from NCDs.  \r\n These are the social determinants: how we are \r\nborn, grow, live, work and age. So, as Dr. Nancy \r\nBrinker, the WHO Goodwill Ambassador for Cancer \r\nControl, eloquently put it to us, where you live should \r\nnot determine whether you live. These social \r\ndeterminants drive the prevalence and impact of \r\ndisease. Social inequalities lead directly to health \r\ninequalities, so our efforts to combat risk factors must \r\nbe led by a drive to act on those social determinants of \r\nhealth — the causes of the causes. \r\n In summary, the main conclusions from the many, \r\nvery effective contributions were that country-level \r\nleadership is needed. The tide of NCDs can be turned \r\nby Government-led action, in close collaboration with \r\ncivil society and the private sector. But we are, as our \r\ncolleague from India reminded us, all inextricably and \r\nglobally linked in our struggle.  \r\n Strong country-level leadership needs visible, \r\nglobal support. We heard clearly that international \r\norganizations such as the World Health Organization \r\nand the World Bank stand ready to provide that support \r\nas well as the shared experience and strategies created \r\nbilaterally and regionally. \r\n In the face of the rising prevalence of NCDs, our \r\nround table was clearly focused on moving forward \r\nfrom an analysis of the problem to strategies to respond \r\nand action to deliver targeted gains. A stronger \r\ninformation and evidence base, enhanced health-care \r\nsystems, a focus on prevention, a whole-of-\r\nGovernment approach and a multisectoral response, \r\ntargeted strategies on key risk factors, and, not least, a \r\nrecognition that we must give all of our peoples, from \r\nbirth, as they grow and work through their lives and as \r\nthey age, the opportunities, the security and the quality \r\nof life which will lift the burden of disease and give all \r\nof us more years to our lives and more life to our years.  \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I now give the \r\nfloor to His Excellency Mr. Pál Schmitt, President of \r\nthe Republic of Hungary and co-Chair of round table 2. \r\n President Schmitt: I deemed it a great honour to \r\nserve as co-Chair, along with the Minister of Health of \r\nMexico, His Excellency Salomón Chertorivski \r\nWoldenberg, of this round table. I am happy that, \r\nthanks to the high level of participation and the \r\nvaluable contributions made, we could consider this \r\ndifficult issue with an open mind and creativity. \r\n We all agreed that non-communicable diseases \r\n(NCDs) represent a major threat, especially to low- and \r\nmiddle-income countries. This round table addressed \r\nthe best successful practices in place in countries with \r\ndifferent income levels; discussed the affordable and \r\ncost-effective actions and measures that can be \r\nimplemented; identified priorities for strengthening \r\nnational capacities; and reviewed the lessons learned in \r\npromoting intersectoral actions. Finally, the round table \r\nenabled a discussion of priorities in the forging of new \r\nalliances between sectors, Government departments, \r\ncommunities, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) \r\nand the corporate sector.  \r\n A total of 43 statements were made by national \r\ndelegations, NGOs and intergovernmental organizations. \r\nThe key message included an emphasis on the great \r\nurgency of addressing NCDs through the \r\nimplementation of affordable and cost-effective best \r\npractices — we called them “best buys” — that have \r\nbeen properly tested in the field in order not to lose \r\nmomentum. Stress was also placed on the pressing \r\nneed to invest in prevention and care as an integral part \r\nof sustainable socio-economic development in order to \r\ntackle NCDs comprehensively. Best buys and other \r\neffective measures aimed at reducing risk factors can \r\nbe implemented only through the active engagement of \r\nnon-health sectors; to that end, an effective mechanism \r\nfor intersectoral action should be created. \r\n There is a need for reports and packages aimed at \r\naddressing NCDs and risk factors, including preventive \r\nand curative actions and access to medicines. Health-\r\ncare systems need to be strengthened, particularly at \r\nthe primary health care level, in order to work towards \r\nuniversal access to basic health care for people with \r\nNCDs, including essential medicines. Also key is the \r\ndevelopment of appropriate capacities and institutional \r\nmechanisms for the health sector to engage \r\nA/66/PV.8  \r\n \r\n11-50546 4 \r\n \r\nsystematically across Government and other sectors to \r\naddress the health dimensions of daily activities. \r\n Training health personnel in adequate numbers \r\nand ensuring their even distribution is a must in order \r\nto ensure appropriate national capacity to tackle NCDs \r\nin order to achieve universal coverage, especially \r\nthrough primary health care and social-protection \r\nmechanisms aimed at providing access to health \r\nservices for all. \r\n The need to consider health-care professional \r\nmigration issues and address the problem of “brain \r\ndrain” was emphasized. Calls were made to ensure that \r\ncancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic \r\nrespiratory disease, mental disorders, disabilities and \r\nother ailments are tackled within the framework of a \r\nstrengthened health system based on a primary health \r\ncare-based system. \r\n The existence of initiatives to combat NCDs in a \r\ngrowing number of countries provides a strong \r\nfoundation to make greater progress in the coming \r\nyears through increasingly robust efforts. \r\n NCD policies and plans need to be aligned with \r\nstrong national plans. Strengthening political \r\ncommitment and according higher priority to NCD \r\nprogrammes are key factors in strengthening national \r\ncapacities to tackle NCDs. Guidance on effective \r\npolicies and strategies to address capacity gaps are \r\navailable and need to be used. Growing national \r\ncapacities for combating the NCD epidemic indicate \r\nthat there are significant opportunities for progress in \r\nthe coming years. \r\n Furthermore, more prevention gains may be \r\nachieved by influencing public policies in domains \r\nsuch as trade, food, pharmaceutical production, \r\nagriculture, urban development, pricing, advertising, \r\ninformation and communications technology and \r\ntaxation policies than by changes that are restricted to \r\nhealth policies and health care alone. \r\n The priorities that countries can implement to \r\novercome NCDs and their risk factors include, inter \r\nalia, a comprehensive approach involving an \r\noperational integrated plan to tackle NCDs and their \r\nrisk factors, including both the prevention and \r\ntreatment aspects. Although such an approach should \r\nbe aimed at targeting the population as a whole, it \r\nshould not overlook groups that are in vulnerable \r\nsituations. There is a need for multisectoral action in \r\nwhich policymakers follow successful approaches \r\naimed at engaging non-health sectors on the basis of \r\ninternational experience and lessons learned. This \r\nshould include cooperation in implementing key NCD \r\nactivities that brings on board multiple sectors.  \r\n Also required is the establishment of surveillance \r\nand monitoring frameworks for NCDs that monitor \r\nexposure, risk factors and determinants, outcomes, \r\nincluding morbidity and mortality, and health system \r\nresponses, interventions and capacities that are fully \r\nintegrated into national health information systems. It \r\nis also important that measurable, standardized core \r\nindicators be adopted. Achievement targets must be set \r\nfor countries. Their health-care systems must be \r\nstrengthened to address NCDs via redirecting existing \r\norganizational and financial arrangements.  \r\n Conventional and innovative means to finance \r\nreforms, based on strengthened primary health care \r\ncapacities and improved health system performance, \r\ncan be implemented to improve NCD control \r\noutcomes. Prevention and control measures that are \r\nclearly cost-effective — as I mentioned, the “best \r\nbuys” — should be adopted and implemented, as \r\nshould population-wide interventions that can be \r\ncomplemented by individual health-care interventions. \r\n With respect to sustainable development, the \r\nNCD epidemic has had a substantial negative impact \r\non human and social development. NCD prevention \r\nmust be included among the priorities of national \r\ndevelopment initiatives and related investment \r\ndecisions, based on the national situation. \r\nStrengthening prevention and control of NCDs must \r\nalso be considered an integral part of poverty reduction \r\nand development assistance programmes. \r\n Civil society institutions and groups are uniquely \r\nplaced to mobilize political and public awareness and \r\nsupport for NCD prevention and control efforts, and to \r\nplay a key role in building capacity and supporting \r\nNCD programmes. \r\n Business can also make decisive and important \r\ncontributions to addressing NCD prevention \r\nchallenges. Responsible marketing to prevent the \r\npromotion of unhealthy diets and other harmful \r\nbehaviours, as well as product reformulation to \r\npromote access to healthy food options, are examples \r\nof approaches and actions that should be implemented \r\nby the corporate sector. Governments are responsible \r\nfor monitoring those necessary actions. \r\n A/66/PV.8\r\n \r\n5 11-50546 \r\n \r\n In the context of sustainable health financing, the \r\nfinancing of prevention and health-care interventions \r\nremains a major impediment to achieving progress. \r\nFinancial allocations for NCD prevention are often \r\ninadequate, as many low-income countries have no \r\ndomestic funding available at all. Increasing taxation \r\non tobacco and alcohol is possible in many countries \r\nand could generate proceeds of which a portion would \r\nbe allocated to health, thus bolstering national policies \r\nand plans. Taxes and controls on other harmful \r\nproducts, such as sugary drinks and industrialized \r\nfoods high in salt or trans-fat, should also be \r\nconsidered. Furthermore, tax regulation initiatives \r\nshould be applied to healthy foods and beverages. \r\n I understand that participants in round table 2 \r\nproposed the following actions related to the shared \r\nresponsibility to make prevention work worldwide: \r\nprevent a major proportion of the NCD burden by \r\nreducing exposure to tobacco use, unhealthy diets, \r\nphysical inactivity and the harmful use of alcohol, \r\nusing “best buys” interventions affordable in all \r\ncountries; consider various settings for action, \r\nparticularly schools, workplaces, households and \r\ncommunities; and sustain health financing through \r\ninnovative approaches such as earmarking revenue \r\nfrom alcohol and tobacco taxes. Further, it is important \r\nto stress the creation of school-based interventions as \r\none way to promote healthy lifestyles and prevent \r\nNCDs. An innovative approach would involve \r\ncommunication tools such as the social media domain. \r\n Shared responsibility to advance multisectoral \r\naction could be strengthened by developing national \r\nmultisectoral plans and establishing effective \r\nmultisectoral coordination mechanisms and cross-\r\ncluster action teams, in particular with ministries of \r\nagriculture, education, finance, planning, social affairs \r\nand welfare, trade and transport.  \r\n The shared responsibility to scale up access to \r\nNCD essential health-care services in all countries \r\nmust be strengthened by integrating NCD policies and \r\nplans within broader efforts on health system planning; \r\nproviding cost-effective screening and early detection \r\nand treatment services for people at high risk of heart \r\nattack, stroke and curable cancers; establishing policies \r\nto ensure universal access to essential medicines \r\nthrough efficient procurement and distribution; \r\nproviding viable financing options and policies for \r\nhigh-quality generic medicines; developing and using \r\nevidence-based guidelines for the treatment of major \r\nNCDs; providing training for health workers at all \r\nlevels of care; and developing health financing policies \r\naimed at universal coverage. \r\n The shared responsibility to set targets and \r\nmeasure results requires the monitoring of NCDs and \r\ntheir risk factors; the strengthening of national \r\ninformation systems by implementing a surveillance \r\nframework that monitors key risk factors, morbidity \r\nand mortality and health-system capacities relating to \r\nNCDs; and the setting of standardized national targets \r\nand indicators consistent with internationally agreed \r\nmonitoring mechanisms. \r\n Finally, capabilities, knowledge, empathy and \r\nwisdom are humankind’s treasures. We are obliged to \r\nuse them for the benefit of our most valuable treasure, \r\nhuman life, which is irreplaceable. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I now give the \r\nfloor to His Excellency Mr. Denzil Douglas, Prime \r\nMinister of Saint Kitts and Nevis and co-Chair of \r\nround table 3. \r\n Mr. Douglas (Saint Kitts and Nevis): The \r\ndiscussion of round table 3 addressed the importance \r\nof fostering international cooperation in assisting \r\ncountries in addressing non-communicable diseases \r\n(NCDs). I should point out that we concluded our \r\ndiscussions at 1 p.m. today, so I want to thank our \r\nfacilitators for preparing the summary that I am \r\npresenting. \r\n International cooperation was interpreted by \r\nparticipants in its broader sense. That included \r\ncooperation among Governments, between Governments \r\nand international organizations, and with all relevant \r\nsectors, both public and private, working at inter-country \r\nlevel. The round table discussions highlighted areas \r\nwhere coordinated action and international solidarity \r\nare important to advancing national and international \r\nsurveillance and monitoring of non-communicable \r\ndiseases and their risk factors, reducing exposure to \r\nrisk factors, and strengthening the care and treatment \r\nof people with NCDs.  \r\n A total of 42 interventions were made by national \r\ndelegations, non-governmental organizations and \r\nmembers of the corporate sector. What were some of \r\nthe key messages that emanated from this round table \r\ndiscussion?  \r\n First, participants believed that we are entering a \r\nnew frontier in public health to which international \r\nA/66/PV.8  \r\n \r\n11-50546 6 \r\n \r\ncooperation and coordination will be vital. It was \r\nrecognized that in our increasingly globalized world, \r\nnational action alone will not be sufficient to address \r\nthe rising tide of NCDs. The lessons learned from \r\ninternational action on tackling HIV over the past \r\n10 years provide examples of international cooperation \r\nthat should be quite useful as we move forward in \r\naddressing the NCDs of today. \r\n Secondly, the stark intra- and inter-country health \r\nand economic inequities related to NCDs were clearly \r\nacknowledged. The role of poverty in increasing NCD \r\nrisk, and the impact of NCDs on poverty and \r\ndevelopment were highlighted. Participants recognized \r\nthe importance of international cooperation in \r\nincreasing our own collective understanding of NCD-\r\nrelated inequalities, and the need to integrate NCDs \r\ninto official development assistance programmes \r\naround the world. \r\n Thirdly, international instruments such as the \r\nFramework Convention on Tobacco Control were \r\nacknowledged as being critical tools needed for scaling \r\nup action to address NCDs. Continued dialogue on \r\npossible additional global frameworks, trade-related \r\ncodes of conduct and other international instruments \r\nwas encouraged. \r\n Fourthly, the importance of sharing information \r\nand experiences was repeatedly emphasized throughout \r\nthe statements. Tackling NCDs was seen as an \r\nopportunity to increase South-South cooperation as \r\nwell as inter-country, regional and international \r\ncollaboration. Professional networks were \r\nacknowledged as important mechanisms for sharing \r\nexperience and stimulating research into cost-effective \r\ninterventions for addressing NCDs, particularly in low-\r\nresource settings. In that regard, many participants \r\ntook the opportunity during this round table to share \r\ntheir own national experiences. \r\n Fifthly, many participants raised the importance \r\nof developing time-bound targets in order to hold \r\nourselves to account, monitor progress and ensure \r\ncontinued attention to and investment in combating \r\nNCDs. \r\n Finally, permit me to identify some key areas \r\nwhere international cooperation was thought to be \r\nparticularly important in addressing NCDs. The first is \r\nstrengthening national surveillance, regarding which \r\nwe recognize that the current lack of critical national \r\ndata needed to guide policy development and \r\ninternational assistance was highlighted by many \r\nparticipants. We emphasized that international \r\nassistance to address this issue was urgently needed.  \r\n The second is strengthening international \r\ncollaboration in order to engage in constructive \r\ndialogue with the commercial sector to develop trade-\r\nrelated practices that protect and promote healthy \r\nconsumption. Many participants in this round table \r\nsought to encourage internationally coordinated action \r\nto tackle pressure from the pharmaceutical industry and \r\nengage productively with the private sector. \r\n The third is marketing and advertising, whose \r\npositive and negative aspects, including modern \r\ncommunications such as social media, were also \r\nhighlighted. Internationally coordinated action to \r\noptimize the benefits of modern communications in \r\npromoting healthy lifestyles was discussed, as was the \r\nimportance of international efforts to limit the negative \r\neffects of advertising and marketing.  \r\n The fourth was the key role of international \r\ncoordination and collaboration in developing \r\ninternational standards and harmonizing regulation, \r\nparticularly on food standards. We believe that this \r\npoint, which was raised by a large number of \r\nparticipants, is critical. \r\n The fifth is access to medicines and technologies. \r\nThe issue of access to affordable medications was \r\nraised by a number of participants. The importance of \r\nthis must be remembered as we scale up our actions to \r\ncombat NCDs. I recalled our own experiences with \r\nregard to HIV/AIDS, which were highlighted as \r\npossible models for addressing some of the access \r\nissues that confront us today. This was acknowledged \r\nas a complex issue, where the right balance — and I \r\nemphasize the right balance — between cost to the \r\nconsumer and reasonable profit to the pharmaceutical \r\ncompanies must be found and pursued. \r\n That is the summary of our round table. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to The \r\nHonourable Mr. Michael Bloomberg, Mayor of the City \r\nof New York. \r\n Mr. Bloomberg: For those who have come to our \r\ncity for this meeting and for the upcoming session of \r\nthe General Assembly, welcome to New York. We are \r\nalways delighted to host visitors. I am honoured to \r\nhave this opportunity to address the Assembly. \r\n A/66/PV.8\r\n \r\n7 11-50546 \r\n \r\n Improving public health has long been one of my \r\npassions. That is why I am devoted to enhancing one of \r\nthe world’s pre-eminent schools of public health, my \r\nalma mater, the Johns Hopkins University, which is \r\ndedicated to saving lives, millions at a time. Public \r\nhealth remains an intense focus of my philanthropic \r\nwork as well as of my public service as Mayor of the \r\nCity of New York. Without a doubt, the greatest public \r\nhealth challenges in the world today are those that \r\nparticipants have identified, namely, the dangers of \r\nchronic non-communicable diseases. \r\n The increase in cardiovascular disease, cancers, \r\ndiabetes and chronic respiratory diseases, as the World \r\nHealth Organization (WHO) warns, has reached \r\nepidemic levels. Each year, unless we head off this \r\nepidemic now, tens of millions of people across the \r\nglobe, especially in low- and medium-income nations, \r\nwill be subjected to crippling pain and disability \r\ncaused by cardiovascular disease and cancer. Tens of \r\nmillions more will be left speechless and immobile by \r\ndebilitating strokes, or maimed and enfeebled by \r\ndiabetes. Tragically, tens of millions of others will face \r\nearly and painful deaths, leaving families bereft and \r\noften impoverished. \r\n We have made reducing non-communicable \r\ndiseases the focus of public health policy here in New \r\nYork City, a city of about 8.4 million people. I am \r\nhappy to report that we have had considerable success \r\nas a result. This is fundamental to the fact that for New \r\nYorkers today, life expectancy has increased faster and \r\nremains higher than for Americans overall. Between \r\n2001 and 2008, life expectancy in our city grew by \r\nmore than a year and a half. That is an outcome we \r\ntake pride in and that we have worked hard to achieve. \r\nI believe all nations worldwide can achieve similar \r\nsuccess. \r\n At the outset of my Administration, we \r\nrecognized that non-communicable diseases, especially \r\nheart disease and cancer, far outstripped all other \r\ncauses of death in our city, and that the single most \r\neffective thing we could do to reduce them was to \r\ndiscourage smoking. Since then, we have implemented \r\na range of policies aimed at achieving precisely that \r\ngoal. We have, for example, made New York City’s \r\nbars and restaurants, like our other workplaces, smoke-\r\nfree. Recently, we extended that ban to our parks and \r\npublic beaches. \r\n We have also mounted hard-hitting educational \r\nmedia campaigns that graphically depict the dire \r\nconsequences of smoking. We have made smoking \r\ncessation programmes far more widely available and, \r\nvery importantly, we have increased the excise taxes to \r\nmake cigarettes purchased in our city the most \r\nexpensive in our nation, at about $11 a pack. \r\n Here are the results of those efforts. Before 2002, \r\nthe proportion of adult smokers in our city had been \r\nconstant for many years, at roughly 22 per cent. Today, \r\nthat has dropped to 14 per cent, the lowest on record. \r\nThere are now some 450,000 fewer adult smokers in \r\nour city than there were in 2002. That means we have \r\nalready saved at least 1,500 lives a year. Most \r\nencouraging of all, the proportion of public high school \r\nstudents who smoke has been cut by more than half, \r\nfrom 18 per cent to just 7 per cent. That will save even \r\nmore lives in the years ahead. Such results can be, and \r\nmust be, replicated worldwide, because when it comes \r\nto preventing tobacco-related illnesses and death, we \r\nare in a race with time, a race we cannot afford to lose. \r\n Here is what is at stake. By the end of the decade, \r\nWHO expects that there will be 7.5 million tobacco-\r\nrelated deaths worldwide every single year. Some \r\n80 per cent of those deaths will take place in the \r\nworld’s low- and middle-income countries, where \r\ntobacco companies have stepped up their marketing \r\nbriskly. As economists put it, the tobacco industry is \r\ngetting the world’s poor hooked before Governments \r\ncan respond. Unless we respond, the results will be \r\n1 billion premature deaths worldwide during the \r\ntwenty-first century. That would be a calamity of the \r\nfirst magnitude. That is why I have also made tobacco \r\ncontrol a priority of Bloomberg Philanthropies. \r\n Since 2006, we have established partnerships \r\nwith Governments and citizens’ groups around the \r\nworld to implement public policies designed to defeat \r\nthe global tobacco epidemic. Those policies are \r\nfamiliar to many participants. They carry out the intent \r\nof the historic Framework Convention on Tobacco \r\nControl, the world’s first public health treaty, which \r\nhas been ratified by some 170 nations.  \r\n Many nations are now taking action. For \r\nexample, two years ago the Brazilian state of São \r\nPaolo mandated comprehensive smoking-free public \r\nplaces. Since then, six more Brazilian states have \r\nfollowed suit. Turkey has adopted similar policies \r\nnationwide, and also mandated graphic cigarette pack \r\nA/66/PV.8  \r\n \r\n11-50546 8 \r\n \r\nwarnings and raised tobacco taxes. So far this year, \r\nNepal, Lebanon, Argentina, Ecuador and other nations \r\nhave enacted comprehensive tobacco control laws. \r\n The progress we are seeing on tobacco is \r\nencouraging action on other fronts as well. To fight \r\ndiabetes and heart attacks, for example, in New York \r\nwe have also taken the lead in promoting healthier \r\neating. In 2008 we became the first jurisdiction in the \r\nUnited States to require restaurant chains to post \r\ncalorie information on menus and menu boards. \r\nSurveys now tell us that customers who observe these \r\npostings buy food with fewer calories. In 2009 we \r\nenacted the first restriction on cholesterol-free artificial \r\ntrans-fat in the city’s food service establishments. Our \r\nlicensing of street green cart vendors has greatly \r\nincreased the availability of fresh fruits and vegetables \r\nin neighbourhoods with high rates of diet-related \r\ndiseases.  \r\n We have also led a national salt-reduction \r\ninitiative and engaged 28 food manufacturers, \r\nsupermarkets and restaurant chains to voluntarily \r\ncommit to reducing excessive levels of sodium in their \r\nproducts. And we have mounted a public education \r\ncampaign, highlighting the ways that consuming sugar-\r\nsweetened drinks contributes directly to the obesity \r\nepidemic that plagues far too many New Yorkers, \r\nespecially our children. \r\n Bloomberg Philanthropies has also begun to \r\naddress another major and non-contagious cause of \r\ndeath and disability in the world with another vital \r\nchange in the fabric of our daily life, that is, improving \r\nroad safety, especially in rapidly motorizing nations. \r\nWe have identified 10 low- and middle-income \r\ncountries that account for nearly half of road deaths \r\nglobally. In partnership with Governments and \r\nnon-governmental organizations, we have begun to \r\nimprove life-saving policies. Those include, for \r\nexample, passing and enforcing seat belt laws and laws \r\nrequiring motorcyclists to wear helmets. We have also \r\nfocused on traffic engineering that improves road \r\nsafety, and on upgrading urban transport that not only \r\nunclogs crowded roads and streets but that also \r\nenhances air quality and quality of life. \r\n The problems of modern life are deeply \r\ninterrelated, and so, thankfully, are their solutions. As \r\nChair of the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, I \r\ncan say that improving transit and other steps that \r\ncities around the world are taking to shrink their \r\ncarbon footprints have the immediate additional benefit \r\nof also improving air quality and public health. In fact, \r\none of the key lessons we have learned is that making \r\nour environment healthier often creates such multiple \r\nbenefits. \r\n Before I conclude, let me also quickly touch on \r\nfour other lessons. First, we have learned that changing \r\nthe social and physical environment is more effective \r\nthan changing individual behaviour alone. Making \r\nworkplaces and places of entertainment smoke-free, \r\nreconfiguring city streets to make them safer, creating \r\nways for consumers to find healthy foods are social \r\nand physical changes that not only make the healthiest \r\nroute, but are also the ones easiest to follow.  \r\n Secondly, and this is very important in today’s \r\nworld, healthy solutions are not necessarily costly; far \r\nfrom it. New York’s smoke-free air act, our restrictions \r\non trans-fats and other requirements concerning calorie \r\npostings in restaurants cost virtually nothing in public \r\nfunds to implement. Raising cigarette taxes raises \r\npublic revenues.  \r\n Thirdly, collaboration with the private sector, as \r\nin the national salt-reduction initiative, and with non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, as in traffic safety efforts \r\nworldwide, is very important. Collaboration across \r\nborders among national and local Governments and \r\nagencies is also critical. The challenges before us are \r\ntoo vast and complex for individual Governments to \r\novercome alone. \r\n Fourthly, and finally, while Government action \r\nalone is not sufficient, it is nevertheless absolutely \r\nessential. There are powers that only Governments can \r\nexercise, policies that only Governments can mandate \r\nand enforce, and results that only Governments can \r\nachieve. To halt the worldwide epidemic of \r\nnon-communicable diseases, Governments at all levels \r\nmust make healthy solutions the default social option. \r\nThat is, ultimately, Government’s highest duty. \r\n As one of the spiritual founders of the United \r\nNations, America’s Franklin Delano Roosevelt, once \r\nput it, “the State’s paramount concern should be the \r\nhealth of its people”. So why do we not all resolve to \r\nrenew our efforts now to address the worldwide crisis \r\nof non-communicable diseases and bring better health \r\nand greater hope to all the people of our good Earth. \r\n \r\n A/66/PV.8\r\n \r\n9 11-50546 \r\n \r\nStatement by the President \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): Allow me to \r\nexpress to all participants my profound gratitude for \r\nthe results achieved at this meeting. The past two days \r\nof intense discussions were a clear indication that the \r\ninternational community is standing shoulder to \r\nshoulder in its efforts to combat non-communicable \r\ndiseases. \r\n I wish to express my gratitude to the two \r\nco-facilitators, Her Excellency Ms. Sylvie Lucas, \r\nPermanent Representative of Luxembourg, and His \r\nExcellency Mr. Raymond Wolfe, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Jamaica. I would also like to express \r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General, His Excellency \r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon, for his pioneering efforts on this \r\nissue and for his report on the prevention and control \r\nof non-communicable diseases (A/66/83), which \r\nprovided important inspiration for the Political \r\nDeclaration we have adopted (resolution 66/2, annex).  \r\n I would also like to thank the co-Chairs of the \r\nround tables held in the framework of the High-level \r\nMeeting; the Director-General of the World Health \r\nOrganization (WHO), Ms. Margaret Chan; the Mayor \r\nof the City of New York, the Honourable Michael \r\nBloomberg; and all the participants for their \r\ncontribution to ensuring a successful outcome of this \r\nmeeting. \r\n In the Political Declaration adopted yesterday, the \r\nAssembly has emphasized, in one clear voice, that \r\nnon-communicable diseases (NCDs) will no longer be \r\nexcluded from international discussions on \r\ndevelopment. There is now a clear mandate and \r\nresponsibility to confront this challenge of epidemic \r\nproportions, which curtails economic growth and \r\nwidens social disparities. The Declaration will resonate \r\nfor years to come and guide the efforts of the \r\ninternational community to comprehensively and \r\ndecisively address the risk factors and underlying \r\ndeterminants of health. \r\n Going forward, we will need to monitor the \r\nimplementation of our commitments very closely. The \r\nGeneral Assembly will, at its sixty-seventh session, \r\nconsider options for strengthening and facilitating \r\nmultisectoral action for the prevention and control of \r\nnon-communicable diseases through effective partnership.  \r\n At the same time, WHO will be preparing \r\nrecommendations for voluntary global targets before \r\nthe end of 2012. WHO was also tasked with developing \r\nindicators and a monitoring framework before the end \r\nof next year. Therefore, these next steps, as well as the \r\nprogress report of the Secretary-General and the review \r\nand assessment of implementation of the Political \r\nDeclaration in 2014, will allow us to measure real-time \r\nprogress in addressing these serious threats to health \r\nand development. The task of political leaders will be \r\nto promote and implement this new initiative. Nations \r\nand peoples around the world are looking forward to \r\nthe Assembly’s efforts to implement the Declaration. \r\n Let me also recognize the important role of civil \r\nsociety organizations as we proceed to implement the \r\nDeclaration. Those entities will be key partners in \r\nservice delivery, outreach and awareness-raising \r\nactivities. \r\n I would like to offer an observation. It seems to \r\nme that attention to public health lacks balance. Focus \r\nhas been increasingly given to a limited number of \r\ndiseases, while those who suffer, for example, from \r\nother physical and mental diseases do not seem to \r\nenjoy the same level of attention, even though these \r\ndiseases are no less serious.  \r\n While the four diseases discussed over the past \r\ntwo days are critical, they are by no means the only \r\nnon-communicable diseases that create a major \r\nchallenge to development and livelihoods. In \r\nparticular, mental health, including depression, is a \r\nmajor threat to the health and well-being of people \r\nworldwide. Going forward, I would encourage the \r\nAssembly to broaden its definition of non-communicable \r\ndiseases to include these other conditions, while \r\nmaintaining the same degree of focus and vigilance in \r\nits efforts. \r\n Health and development are issues dear to my \r\nheart, and I focus on them intently. I will continue to \r\nprovide all possible assistance to the Assembly in its \r\nefforts during the sixty-sixth session and beyond.  \r\n After two days of debate and despite the many \r\nchallenges we face, I remain optimistic about our \r\nability to lead the way in tackling the world’s foremost \r\nhealth threat and to advance our social and economic \r\ndevelopment in the decades ahead. Above all else, \r\nhowever, I am counting on the Assembly and its \r\npartnership. Together, we can save many, many lives. \r\nA/66/PV.8  \r\n \r\n11-50546 10 \r\n \r\n I now give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Adam \r\nFronczak, Under-secretary of State for the Ministry of \r\nHealth of Poland. \r\n Mr. Fronczak (Poland): It is a great honour for \r\nme to participate in this debate and to have the \r\nopportunity to share national experiences at this High-\r\nlevel Meeting of the General Assembly on the \r\nPrevention and Control of Non-communicable \r\nDiseases (NCDs).  \r\n While recognizing the primary role of national \r\nGovernments in preventing and controlling NCDs, it is \r\nnecessary to emphasize the importance of international \r\ncooperation, in particular the engagement of highly \r\ncompetent institutions, such as the World Health \r\nOrganization (WHO).  \r\n Although the international community has \r\nalready undertaken many actions to combat \r\nnon-communicable diseases, we still have much to do. \r\nI would like to point out that, in the framework of \r\nbilateral cooperation, we have implemented many \r\ninitiatives related to improving health policy and the \r\nhealth-care system, preventing disability, reducing \r\nhealth inequality, increasing health awareness and its \r\nimpact, and fighting non-communicable diseases, \r\nwhich is the subject of our meeting today. \r\n Currently, Poland is facing the great challenge of \r\npresiding over the Council of the European Union. It \r\nwas clear to us that health — an issue that concerns \r\neveryone — had to be included in the list of priority \r\nobjectives for our presidency, which constitutes an \r\nopportunity for Poland to present its initiatives and \r\nachievements, as well as its ongoing and planned \r\nactivities.  \r\n When discussing the issues of public health and \r\nthe fight against non-communicable diseases, one has \r\nto take into consideration factors affecting health. \r\nThese are understood as well-being, and not just as the \r\nabsence of disease. Important issues include lifestyle, \r\noccupational health risk factors and genetic \r\ndeterminants of health. It is particularly important to \r\nmeet the public health challenge posed by \r\nnon-communicable diseases not only by focusing on \r\nreparative medicine but also by addressing prevention, \r\nprophylaxis, education and the promotion of good \r\nhealth. Strategic actions that take into account \r\npopulations’ needs, that emphasize positive impacts on \r\nhealth and that employ a multidisciplinary approach to \r\nthe problem of non-communicable diseases will be \r\nnecessary. \r\n Currently, in this field of cooperation, we place \r\nmost emphasis on two issues: reducing health \r\ninequality and fighting against non-communicable \r\ndiseases. As far as reducing health inequality in society \r\nis concerned, we are concentrating on the issue of \r\npublic health in health policy and the role of \r\npromotion, prophylaxis, education and prevention as \r\ntools enabling us to shape health-conscious attitudes \r\nfrom the early stages of life to active old age. We are \r\nalso focusing on diminishing health, social and \r\neconomic inequalities for the elderly. \r\n Mr. Boolell (Mauritius), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n In the fight against chronic non-communicable \r\ndiseases, we are concentrating particularly on lifestyle \r\nissues and on combating addictions. Over the past \r\n40 years, European countries have made significant \r\nprogress in preventing death and prolonging life, as \r\nreflected in longer life spans and decreases in infant \r\nmortality.  \r\n As far as the issue of smoking and alcohol abuse \r\nare concerned, we must emphasize that those \r\naddictions constitute the main risk factors of diseases \r\nin Europe. Our experience in analysing them leads to \r\nthe conclusion that it is necessary to apply a global \r\napproach to the problem. Europe has the highest \r\nalcohol consumption rate in the world; consumption \r\nper capita is twice the worldwide average. Moreover, \r\nthe alcohol consumption rate is growing fastest in \r\ncountries with low and middle incomes, in which \r\nconsumption previously was much lower. \r\n Premature deaths — those occurring before the \r\nage of 60 — can be largely prevented by effective \r\nactions aimed at the four common modifiable risk \r\nfactors. Better management of such actions can reduce \r\nmorbidity, disability and mortality rates and improve \r\nhealth. Still, despite substantial resources being \r\navailable in Europe — along with intriguing ideas and \r\nsolutions that have been implemented in some \r\ncountries — the situation in most European countries \r\nhas not improved. \r\n It is impossible not to appreciate the actions \r\nundertaken by the World Health Organization. The new \r\nHealth 2020 strategic document and the Action Plan for \r\nimplementation of the European Strategy for the \r\n A/66/PV.8\r\n \r\n11 11-50546 \r\n \r\nPrevention and Control of Non-communicable \r\nDiseases 2012-2016 should become our signposts. The \r\nsynergy between the initiatives of the European Union \r\nand the United Nations should also be recognized, and \r\nI see our meeting as an excellent opportunity for the \r\nmutual reinforcement of actions. Those processes may \r\nalso support the development of national policies for \r\nfighting non-communicable diseases, alleviate certain \r\ndifficulties in the integration of national programmes, \r\nand accept the need for co-management of national \r\npolicies in global policy. \r\n We would also like to encourage our partners to \r\njoin high-level discussions about the increase in the \r\nincidence of non-communicable diseases and its \r\nsocio-economic context, referred to by the WHO in its \r\nreports. Poland also supports multisectoral consultations to \r\nfocus attention on the means and tools for fighting \r\nnon-communicable diseases as an integral part of \r\nglobal development. \r\n At the global level, our agreements should \r\nindicate the methods for the implementation of \r\nmeasures aimed at combating non-communicable \r\ndiseases. Considering the objectives mentioned earlier, \r\nthe initiative to make those issues the priority in the \r\noperations of our meeting is particularly significant. I \r\nassure the Assembly that Poland will give its full \r\nattention to the comments, proposals, suggestions and \r\nrecommendations of our partners, and will engage in \r\nan interactive dialogue in order to achieve the defined \r\nobjectives. In realizing those initiatives, Poland counts \r\non the support of the WHO, with its invaluable \r\nexpertise and experience. \r\n I would like to thank the United Nations and the \r\nGeneral Assembly once again for organizing this \r\nMeeting, and I declare, in the name of Poland, our \r\nopenness and dedication to the pursuit of our common \r\ngoal. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHer Excellency Ms. Veronika Skvortsova, Deputy \r\nMinister for Health and Social Development of the \r\nRussian Federation. \r\n Ms. Skvortsova (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): In Russia as in the rest of the world, \r\nnon-communicable diseases are the main cause of \r\nmorbidity and mortality. They pose a threat to \r\neveryone’s health and constitute a key macroeconomic \r\nand political factor affecting the development of \r\nsociety. \r\n For the Russian Federation, the health of its \r\ncitizens is an absolute priority. In the course of \r\n10 years, health financing has increased over sixfold. \r\nAgainst the backdrop of an actively pursued national \r\nhealth-care reform, we are implementing a nationwide \r\nfight against tobacco and alcohol abuse and pursuing \r\nstrategies to promote healthy diets, encourage \r\nparticipation in sport and foster healthy lifestyles. At \r\nthe same time, we are implementing priority national \r\nprogrammes to fight and prevent the most common and \r\nsocially impactful non-communicable diseases. Those \r\nmeasures have allowed us within less than five years to \r\nincrease life expectancy in Russia by almost four years, \r\nto reduce the rate of mortality by more than 9 per cent, \r\nand to improve health indicators. \r\n At the initiative of the Government of the \r\nRussian Federation and the World Health Organization \r\n(WHO), the First Global Ministerial Conference on \r\nHealthy Lifestyles and Non-communicable Diseases \r\nwas held in Moscow in April 2011. The Moscow \r\nConference played a key role in the preparation and \r\nholding of today’s High-level Meeting. We wish to \r\nthank all participants for their active engagement, \r\nconsideration and adoption of the Moscow Declaration, \r\nas well as the special WHO resolution adopted on its \r\nbasis. \r\n Promoting healthy lifestyles, addressing risk \r\nfactors and creating a common preventive environment \r\nconstitute the real way forward to reduce the burden of \r\nnon-communicable diseases. However, that goal can be \r\nachieved only through joint actions of the whole \r\nsociety, including Government and all State sectors, \r\nministries and agencies, the business sector, civil \r\nsociety and individuals. The development of a cohesive \r\nand system-wide health-care policy at the local, \r\nnational and regional levels is the goal by which the \r\nsuccess of global initiatives and activities will be \r\ndefined. \r\n Russia is increasing its contribution to global \r\nhealth care. According to an agreement with WHO, \r\nmore than $36 million have been allocated for a project \r\nto fight non-communicable diseases in other countries. \r\nThe main purpose of the project is to implement the \r\nprovisions of the Moscow Declaration aimed at \r\ndeveloping the monitoring of non-communicable \r\ndiseases and health determinants, controlling risk \r\nfactors and preventing non-communicable diseases, \r\nimproving health care for people suffering from \r\nnon-communicable diseases, and fostering international \r\nA/66/PV.8  \r\n \r\n11-50546 12 \r\n \r\npartnerships and strengthening global multisectoral \r\ncooperation. \r\n Understanding that non-communicable diseases \r\nare inextricably linked to mother and child health, the \r\nRussian Federation will also allocate $75 million to a \r\nfive-year programme to reduce infant and child \r\nmortality as part of the Muskoka Initiative of the \r\nGroup of Eight. Aware of the possible link between \r\nnon-communicable diseases and certain infectious \r\ndiseases such as HIV/AIDS, Russia has contributed \r\n$270 million towards development of the Global Fund \r\nto Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. In May next \r\nyear we are to adopt a WHO resolution that should set \r\nout specific terms for further collective action. \r\n I would like to conclude with the words of the \r\nPrime Minister of the Russian Federation, Vladimir \r\nPutin, at the opening of the First Global Ministerial \r\nConference on Healthy Lifestyles and Non-communicable \r\nDisease Control: \r\n “The principles of healthy lifestyles and the need \r\nto combine efforts to fight non-communicable \r\ndiseases should without doubt become the \r\ndefining items on the global agenda aimed at \r\nmeeting the Millennium Development Goals. We \r\nneed to have already reached certain landmarks \r\nby 2015. The professional community, \r\nGovernments and organizations all over the world \r\nstill have time before 2015.” \r\nMay we all succeed in our efforts.  \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Sohibnazar Rahmonov, Deputy \r\nMinister for Health of Tajikistan. \r\n Mr. Rahmonov (Tajikistan) (spoke in Russian): \r\nAllow me to thank the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly for the invitation to take part in this \r\nsignificant and pivotal forum for all people on the \r\nprevention of non-communicable diseases. We believe \r\nthat this meeting will effectively unite the efforts of the \r\ninternational community in combating this contemporary \r\nscourge of humanity, namely, non-communicable diseases \r\n(NCDs,) which are achieving epidemic proportions in \r\nmany countries. \r\n It is well known that many indicators of the \r\nhealth and lifestyle of populations depend upon a \r\nmultitude of objective and subjective factors, including, \r\nin particular, genetic, geographic, socio-political and \r\neconomic factors.  \r\n Following the collapse of the Union of Soviet \r\nSocialist Republics, Tajikistan faced a serious \r\neconomic predicament due to unexpected emerging \r\nproblems linked to energy, communication and \r\ninformation isolation that inevitably affected the core \r\nhealth indicators of the entire Tajik nation. The period \r\nof civil war exacerbated the country’s economic \r\nsituation. In response to those conditions, the \r\nGovernment of Tajikistan undertook decisive, \r\nambitious steps to reform the national health-care \r\nsystem and medical education. In hindsight those \r\nefforts appear entirely justified and timely. \r\n My country has mainstreamed evidence-based \r\nmedicine into practical medicine, thus enabling us to \r\nconform national diagnostic and treatment procedures \r\nwith international standards. We have enhanced the \r\nmanagement quality of clinical practices and facilitated \r\nthe work of practising doctors. \r\n We are well aware that the mental and physical \r\nhealth of the nation’s people is a national asset of vital \r\ncapacities that defines society’s further progress in its \r\neconomic, social and cultural development.  \r\n Epidemiological research among the adult \r\npopulation has enabled us to ascertain the prevalence \r\nof certain risk factors of ischaemic heart disease. As \r\npart of that research, we detected a high rate of \r\nsmoking, including tobacco chewing, among men. In \r\nthe general population, arterial hypertension was \r\nidentified in more than 22 per cent of the adult \r\npopulation. To a lesser degree, the prevalence rates of \r\nrisk factors including obesity and high cholesterol were \r\nalso detected.  \r\n In step with the problems detected, the country \r\nadopted a national programme on the prevention, \r\ndiagnosis and treatment of ischaemic heart disease. As \r\npart of the programme’s implementation, general \r\ninvestments in heart surgery and services in the \r\nRepublic have risen more than 100 per cent over the \r\npast 10 years. That has led to significant reductions in \r\ncardiovascular morbidity and mortality rates and has \r\nallowed us to mainstream new diagnosis and treatment \r\ntechnologies. \r\n In view of the high rate of smoking in Tajikistan, \r\nwe adopted a law to limit the use of tobacco products, \r\nwhich has already paid dividends. The Republic is \r\nsuccessfully implementing a national programme on \r\nthe prevention, early diagnosis and treatment of \r\ndiabetes and oncological diseases.  \r\n A/66/PV.8\r\n \r\n13 11-50546 \r\n \r\n Tajikistan, like any developing country, continues \r\nto face problems related to the increasing severity of \r\nNCDs. As a result, losses in economic and human \r\nterms remain high and rise in step with the population’s \r\nurbanization, as well as its ageing. \r\n The economic and financial crisis of modern \r\nsociety has worsened the situation. Yet making \r\nprogress in modern medicine and health care will not \r\nbe possible without sufficient funding. All of those \r\nissues dictate the fundamental need for additional \r\nresources and their more effective use in critical areas, \r\nwhile at the same time developing multifaceted \r\npreventive interventions tailored to each member of \r\nsociety, each collective and the entire population and \r\nbased on the specific social, cultural, ethnic, climatic \r\nand geographic factors in a situation of limited \r\nresources.  \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHer Excellency Mrs. Fatima Franco, Deputy Minister \r\nfor Health of Ecuador. \r\n Mrs. Franco (Ecuador) (spoke in Spanish): We in \r\nthe Ministry of Health of the Republic of Ecuador \r\nwould like to express our satisfaction with the \r\nagreement expressed at this and previous meetings \r\nregarding progress in the collective and global \r\ndevelopment of actions and strategies to prevent and \r\ncontrol chronic non-communicable diseases.  \r\n For Ecuador, the concept of well-being is one of \r\nthe guides of our actions. It represents a state of well-\r\nbeing and abundance, shifting the paradigm to a State \r\nwhere the well-being of people is not subjected to \r\neconomic interests. \r\n Under this concept and in the framework of the \r\nnational policies, of the position of the member States \r\nof the Union of South American Nations and of the \r\nproposal by the Group of 77 in the setting of the \r\nPolitical Declaration of this great meeting (resolution \r\n66/2, annex), Ecuador emphasizes its support along \r\ntwo lines. \r\n First, we refer to universal access to medicines \r\nand to the World Trade Organization’s Agreement on \r\nTrade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights \r\n(TRIPS). Ecuador reaffirms its support for the explicit \r\nmention of the use of the flexibilities in that \r\nAgreement, as they will enable us to reduce barriers to \r\naccess to medicines through promoting the legitimate \r\nclaim that the right to health is a human right. That is \r\nreaffirmed in the Doha Declaration and in the Global \r\nStrategy on Public Health Innovation and Intellectual \r\nProperty.  \r\n Furthermore, we believe it is necessary to \r\npromote international cooperation in the mobilization \r\nof resources and technical assistance in capacity-\r\nbuilding aimed at implementation of the flexibilities of \r\nthe TRIPS Agreement, especially in the developing and \r\nleast developed countries. This support will encourage \r\nand complement actions and strategies established by \r\nthose countries to improve the quality of life of their \r\ninhabitants. \r\n The second area that Ecuador supports is the \r\nissue of tobacco consumption, which involves a \r\nconflict of interest between the tobacco industry and \r\npublic health. It is therefore important for Member \r\nStates to adopt the measures established in the World \r\nHealth Organization Framework Convention on \r\nTobacco Control and integrate them into their national \r\npolicies and programmes. In that regard, this year \r\nEcuador enacted its organic law on tobacco control and \r\nregulation. \r\n We are aware that the fight against tobacco \r\nconsumption is one of the tools that can be used to \r\nreduce the incidence of chronic non-communicable \r\ndiseases. We believe that this platform could be \r\nreplicated to give impetus to the establishment of \r\nglobal commitments that could become an international \r\nstandard for the prevention and control of diabetes, a \r\ndisease that has caused about 1.3 million deaths around \r\nthe world and is the leading cause of death in Ecuador. \r\nWe extend a special invitation to the food industry to \r\njoin in this struggle. \r\n Eager to safeguard the primacy of public health, \r\nEcuador encourages all Member States to work \r\ntogether and develop international standards that will \r\nenable us to implement new and innovative strategies \r\nto combat chronic non-communicable diseases.  \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nMr. Munawar Saeed Bhatti, Additional Foreign \r\nSecretary of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of \r\nPakistan. \r\n Mr. Bhatti (Pakistan): We would like to thank \r\nthe President for organizing this High-level Meeting of \r\nthe General Assembly on Non-communicable Diseases.  \r\n As an active member of the Group of 77, Pakistan \r\nrecognizes the role played by the Group. We \r\nA/66/PV.8  \r\n \r\n11-50546 14 \r\n \r\nparticularly appreciate the role played by Caribbean \r\ncountries in drawing the world’s attention to this \r\nimportant issue. \r\n Eighty per cent of all deaths related to \r\nnon-communicable diseases (NCDs) are in low- and \r\nmiddle-income countries and constitute 50 per cent of \r\nthe total disease burden. In Pakistan, NCDs are among \r\nthe top 10 causes of mortality and morbidity, causing \r\nalmost 25 per cent of total deaths. The cost of diabetes \r\nalone is between 2 and 4 per cent of gross domestic \r\nproduct. Diabetes-related costs can eat up 15 to 25 per \r\ncent of a household’s disposable income, which leads \r\nthem to cut down on expenditures on other basic \r\nrequirements. This High-level Meeting provides us a \r\nwelcome opportunity to express our political resolve to \r\naddress that challenge.  \r\n In order to address NCD-related challenges, \r\nPakistan is considering a number of cross-sectoral \r\npolicy interventions. These include high-level political \r\ncommitment and the involvement of communities and \r\nhealth care providers in creating awareness of and \r\npreventing NCDs, mapping existing health facilities \r\nand assessing their capacity to address NCDs, \r\nestablishing uniform standards for the public and \r\nprivate sectors alike, incorporating NCD prevention \r\nand control into poverty reduction strategies, \r\npromoting research and building human resource \r\ncapacities, and developing partnerships with all \r\nstakeholders, including international organizations.  \r\n Before I conclude, I must highlight that \r\npartnerships with the international community can play \r\nan important role in the prevention and control of \r\nNCDs, especially by helping developing countries in \r\nresearch and development and by sharing technology. \r\nThe leading pharmaceutical companies should fulfil \r\ntheir corporate social responsibility by ensuring the \r\navailability of affordably priced medicines for the \r\nprevention and control of NCDs, particularly in \r\ndeveloping countries. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ngive the floor to the representative of Monaco. \r\n Ms. Picco (Monaco) (spoke in French): First of \r\nall, allow me to thank the Secretary-General for the \r\nquality of his report (A/66/83), and the World Health \r\nOrganization (WHO) for playing a leading role in the \r\ninternational community’s struggle to prevent and \r\ncontrol non-communicable diseases, with the World \r\nHealth Assembly approving the Global Strategy for the \r\nPrevention and Control of Non-communicable \r\nDiseases in 2000.  \r\n Diseases that we now describe as epidemics — \r\ncardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory \r\ndiseases and diabetes, but also neuro-degenerative, rare \r\nand congenital diseases — are the leading causes of \r\ndeath in the world, as more than 3 of every 5 people \r\ndie from one of them.  \r\n Developing countries and the inhabitants of low-\r\nincome countries suffer the most. That is why the \r\nPrincipality of Monaco is deeply involved in the \r\nimplementation of health programmes as part of its \r\ndevelopment cooperation activities. With an official \r\ndevelopment assistance allocation equivalent to \r\n€300 per year per inhabitant, the Principality of \r\nMonaco channels about half of that amount to fund \r\ninitiatives in the health and social sectors. This funding \r\nis used to provide training for health care personnel, \r\nfight malnutrition, improve access to safe drinking \r\nwater and treat children suffering from leukaemia, as \r\nwell as to build or renovate health centres and health-\r\ncare infrastructure.  \r\n As far as the prevention and control of \r\nnon-communicable diseases is concerned, Monaco is \r\ncommitted to working with non-governmental \r\norganizations, health institutions and international \r\norganizations, in particular WHO. The Government of \r\nthe Principality has therefore established several \r\npartnerships with hospitals so that Monaco’s heath \r\nentities can help to improve and build the skills of \r\nmedical workers in countries partnering with its Office \r\nof International Cooperation, with a view to \r\nreinforcing the health-care capacities of those States.  \r\n Through those partnerships, Monaco has been \r\nable to provide hospital care for children whose \r\nconditions are inoperable in their countries of origin. \r\nSince the project’s inception in 2008, medical care has \r\nbeen provided to 139 children with heart or \r\northopaedic conditions.  \r\n Monaco has also developed a partnership with the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency in the framework \r\nof its Programme of Action for Cancer Therapy, the \r\nobjective of which is to improve the quality of life of \r\ncancer patients by building capacities in screening, \r\ndiagnosis, radiation therapy and palliative care.  \r\n The improvement of global health is an essential \r\ncomponent of global socio-economic development and, \r\n A/66/PV.8\r\n \r\n15 11-50546 \r\n \r\ntherefore, in achieving the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. In that regard, as all of us have emphasized, the \r\nprevention and control of non-communicable diseases \r\ncannot be undertaken outside the multilateral \r\nframework and without setting up multisectoral \r\npartnerships. In tackling this new challenge, we must \r\nmake the most of our experience in the fight against \r\nHIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.  \r\n Mr. Valero Briceño (Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela) (spoke in Spanish): My delegation aligns \r\nitself with the statements made by the representative of \r\nArgentina at the 7th meeting on behalf of the Group of \r\n77 and China, and by the representative of Uruguay at \r\nthe 4th meeting on behalf of the Union of South \r\nAmerican Nations. \r\n More than 60 per cent of deaths worldwide are \r\ncaused by non-communicable diseases (NCDs). They \r\nare the main cause of death in the world. Developing \r\ncountries, especially those with the poorest and most \r\nneedy populations, suffer the most from these diseases.  \r\n There is a link between health and poverty. That \r\nis why we must urgently reorient political action and \r\nmake it more human-centred. Governments must \r\nprioritize their social responsibilities over the interests \r\nand profits of the big economic and financial \r\ncorporations. It is indisputable that capitalist practices \r\nhave failed and that we must take radical steps to \r\nreverse the commercialism of health care, guaranteeing \r\nfree or low-cost access to medicines. We must \r\ntherefore promote the transfer of technology and of the \r\nrequisite capacities to developing countries in line with \r\nnational needs and realities. \r\n In Venezuela, the human right to health is \r\nenshrined at the constitutional level and is governed by \r\nthe principles of freedom from cost, universality, \r\ncomprehensiveness, equality, social integration, \r\nmulti-ethnicity and multiculturalism.  \r\n The right to health is a basic human right, and in \r\nconsequence, the promotion of, respect for, access to \r\nand realization of this right is an inalienable \r\ncommitment of the Bolivarian Government. Our 2009-\r\n2013 national health plan was designed with the full, \r\nactive and organized participation of the people. \r\nThrough the plan, we have enhanced, in a universal \r\nmanner, comprehensive attention to health and the \r\nright to health. The qualitative improvement in the \r\nquality of life of all men and women in Venezuela is \r\ndemonstrable.  \r\n Despite the awful financial turmoil caused by \r\nneoliberal policies around the world, our revolutionary \r\nGovernment continues to guarantee the continuity of \r\nits successful social programmes. These have \r\ndrastically reduced extreme poverty, eradicated \r\nilliteracy and guaranteed free access to health care \r\nthroughout the country.  \r\n Social investment is the primary axis of our \r\nnational budget allocations. In 2010, more than 60 per \r\ncent of fiscal revenue was reserved for social \r\ninvestment, and over the past decade such spending \r\ntotalled more than $400 billion. About 9 per cent of the \r\nnational budget for 2011 was reserved for the health \r\nsector. This represents an increase of more than 7 per \r\ncent since 1999, when the revolutionary Government \r\nof Hugo Chávez Frías commenced. This policy has led \r\nto several significant improvements in the health \r\nsector.  \r\n First, pain management medication is being \r\ndistributed free of charge for chemotherapy through \r\nour national oncology programme. Secondly, the \r\nnetwork of cancer centres in the country has been \r\nstrengthened, and chemotherapy and radiation therapy \r\nare provided either free of charge or at a very low cost. \r\nThirdly, workshops have been held on the promotion of \r\na healthy lifestyle, during which informational and \r\neducational materials were distributed with messages \r\ndesigned to promote life-enhancing practices. Fourthly, \r\na national anti-tobacco programme has been \r\nimplemented, which includes a resolution that bans \r\nsmoking in enclosed spaces that came into force \r\nrecently, in mid-2011. Fifthly, projects and measures \r\nhave been developed aimed at cleaning up the \r\nenvironment in order to combat diseases caused by \r\nenvironmental factors. Sixthly, 22 new hospitals have \r\nbeen built.  \r\n Thanks to the construction of the Dr. Gilberto \r\nRodríguez Ochoa Latin American Children’s \r\nCardiology Hospital, 80 per cent of children born with \r\nheart problems are cared for free of charge. That has \r\nsubstantially reduced child mortality, which currently \r\nstands at 13 per 1,000 in Venezuela, while the average \r\nfor Latin America is 29 per 1,000. Ten years ago, only \r\n2 per cent of children born with heart problems had \r\nA/66/PV.8  \r\n \r\n11-50546 16 \r\n \r\naccess to free health care. This cause of infant \r\nmortality is the most common in Venezuela.  \r\n In August 2011, President Hugo Chávez Frías \r\napproved the creation of the National Cancer Institute, \r\nwhich will be involved in research and teaching \r\nprogrammes as well as policy formulation and statistics \r\nin coordination with the national network of cancer \r\nhospitals and medical services. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to state that \r\ninternational cooperation and the implementation of \r\ncommitments for official development assistance and \r\nof the flexible provisions of the Agreement on Trade-\r\nRelated Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights are the \r\nmain axes for the implementation of policies to \r\nguarantee access to medicine and thus the human right \r\nto health. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of San Marino. \r\n Mr. Bodini (San Marino): As this is the first time \r\nthat I speak during the sixty-sixth session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, I would like to congratulate \r\nAmbassador Al-Nasser on his election as President of \r\nthe General Assembly. I would also like to thank the \r\nSecretary-General for his strong support for the success \r\nof this High-level Meeting on the Prevention and \r\nControl of Non-communicable Diseases. \r\n Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) have \r\nreached epidemic proportions and are the biggest cause \r\nof death worldwide. This scourge creates in our \r\nsocieties not only an increasing social and \r\npsychological tragedy, but an unaffordable financial \r\nburden for all of us. It is estimated that by 2030 the \r\ncumulative loss of output to the global economy could \r\nbe between $30 and $47 trillion — a staggering amount \r\nof money that, in an economic environment of \r\nincreasing resource scarcity, is totally unacceptable. \r\nThe increasing cost of health care worldwide is a \r\nserious threat to sustainable development and to the \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals. \r\n Life expectancy in San Marino, the country that I \r\nam honoured to represent, is well above 80 years, one \r\nof the highest in the world. We believe this is a result \r\nof a Mediterranean diet and an efficient national health \r\nsystem. However, even for our country, the financial \r\nburden of such a system is becoming a matter of \r\nconcern. \r\n We therefore believe that early prevention among \r\nour youngsters and specific campaigns against the use \r\nof cigarettes and alcohol and in favour of appropriate \r\ndiet and exercise are very efficient and cost-effective \r\ntools to limit the spread of NCDs. We also believe that \r\nthere should be a stronger joint effort between the \r\npublic and the private sector, as well as \r\nnon-governmental organizations.  \r\n We welcome the Political Declaration of the \r\nHigh-level Meeting of the General Assembly on the \r\nPrevention and Control of Non-communicable \r\nDiseases (resolution 66/2, annex), and we strongly \r\nbelieve that all of us should strengthen our national \r\npolicies and create more efficiency in our health \r\nsystems. \r\n Moreover, we believe that expanded international \r\ncooperation is very important for small countries like \r\nours, as well as for the developing and least developed \r\ncountries. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to add that efforts to \r\nfind new cures should be enhanced with effective \r\nfinancial and fiscal incentives, so that the cost of new \r\ntherapies for lifelong NCDs can be affordable for the \r\nlargest number of patients. \r\n The Acting President: I give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of Mauritania. \r\n Mr. Ould Hadrami (Mauritania) (spoke in \r\nFrench): It is a great honour to take the floor before the \r\nGeneral Assembly, which is meeting to discuss the \r\nissue of the prevention and control of non-communicable \r\ndiseases (NCDs), one of the most serious and \r\nwidespread threats to health care in the twenty-first \r\ncentury. I would like to take this opportunity to \r\ncommend the Secretary-General for his excellent report \r\n(A/66/83). \r\n At the global level, as proven by the latest report of \r\nthe World Health Organization (WHO), non-communicable \r\ndiseases are the primary cause of mortality. In 2008, \r\nthe deaths of almost 9 million people under the age of \r\n60 were attributable to NCDs. Ninety per cent of these \r\npremature deaths happened in low- or medium-income \r\ncountries.  \r\n In the African region, non-communicable \r\ndiseases and infectious diseases are an incessant and \r\nincreasing dual burden and a source of disability and \r\npremature death. In Mauritania, the main chronic \r\n A/66/PV.8\r\n \r\n17 11-50546 \r\n \r\nillnesses are cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer \r\nand related diseases, and mental diseases.  \r\n An epidemiological study carried out in June \r\n2008 showed the frequency and seriousness of these \r\npathologies by revealing their prevalence in the last \r\n64 years: hypertension, 22.4 per cent; diabetes, 6 per \r\ncent; use of tobacco, 32.7 per cent in men; high \r\ncholesterol, 14.8 per cent; and overweight, 58 per cent. \r\nCancers remain one of the main reasons for medical \r\nevacuation abroad, followed by cardiovascular disease.  \r\n In the field of mental health care, a study in \r\nMauritania carried out in cooperation with the World \r\nHealth Organization Lyon office and the WHO bureau \r\nin Nouakchott showed the following results: 35 per \r\ncent of individuals sampled had at least one mental \r\nproblem, 20 per cent had problems with anxiety, 19 per \r\ncent had mood problems, and 2.4 per cent showed \r\nsome psychotic problems. \r\n Given the breadth of these challenges, our \r\ncountry is firmly committed, together with our \r\npartners, to combating them. The following \r\narrangements are among those adopted to effectively \r\naddress these pathologies.  \r\n An NCD treatment centre, a national anti-tobacco \r\nprogramme and a national mental health programme \r\nhave been set up. We have created national specialized \r\ntreatment centres for certain non-communicable \r\ndiseases, including the Neuropsychiatric Centre of \r\nNouakchott. The National Oncology Centre was \r\nestablished in 2008, financed by the Mauritanian State \r\nitself, which has been effectively contributing to the \r\ntreatment of cancer since the creation of the \r\nradiotherapy unit in 2011. The National Cardiology \r\nCentre was set up in 2009. There is a national health \r\ninsurance fund, which has expanded to include a \r\nnumber of social categories and which will bolster \r\nother structures of medical treatment.  \r\n Moreover, from an early date, Mauritania entered \r\nthe international process organized to combat these \r\ndiseases. It actively participated in the WHO African \r\nRegion Ministerial Consultation on Non-communicable \r\nDiseases held in Brazzaville from 4 to 6 April 2011, \r\nwhich led to the adoption of the Brazzaville \r\nDeclaration on Non-communicable Diseases. It also \r\nparticipated in the First Global Ministerial Conference \r\non Healthy Lifestyles and Non-communicable Disease \r\nControl, held in Moscow on 28 and 29 April, and now \r\nthe High-level Meeting of the General Assembly on \r\nNCDs that we are honoured to participate in here. \r\n The outcome document sanctioning the work of \r\nthe current High-level Meeting should set as a priority \r\nthe prevention and control of NCDs by ensuring the \r\nparticipation of all public sectors in partnership with \r\ncivil society, the private sector and communities, as \r\nwell as the promotion of good governance to prevent \r\nconflict or the interruption of the provision of services.  \r\n Health-care systems must be strengthened by \r\nattributing particular attention to, inter alia, funding \r\nand training of health-care personnel and developing \r\ntheir loyalty; the provision and distribution of \r\nmedication, vaccines and medical equipment; and the \r\nimprovement of infrastructure and basic cost-efficient \r\nand evidence-based services for the treatment of \r\nNCDs. It is also necessary, we believe, to advocate for \r\nthe integration of health care into all multisectoral \r\npolicies in order to address the problems of NCDs and \r\ntheir risk factor determinants.  \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of Greece. \r\n Mr. Mitsialis (Greece): Non-communicable \r\ndiseases (NCDs) are a challenge of epidemic \r\nproportions in our times. That conclusion is \r\ncommonplace today. Those who have to deal with such \r\ndiseases, in Government or in the professional sector, \r\nface this reality every day. \r\n Also commonplace is the fact that NCDs are part \r\nof today’s way of life. Unhealthy diet and obesity, \r\nsmoking, excessive alcohol consumption and lack of \r\nphysical exercise are worldwide phenomena. The \r\nimpact of the economic crisis on health is likely to \r\nworsen the situation even more by strengthening its \r\nsocial determinants. \r\n In Greece, 40 per cent of the population suffer \r\nfrom chronic conditions. Almost 55 per cent of Greeks \r\nare overweight, and 49 per cent are smokers. In the \r\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) European region, \r\nNCDs account for an estimated 77 per cent of the total \r\ndisease burden and 86 per cent of deaths. In the \r\nEuropean Union, NCDs result in more than 800,000 \r\npremature deaths annually. \r\n Cardiovascular diseases cause half of all deaths \r\nin Europe. The relevant cost for the European Union \r\neconomy is estimated at approximately €200 billion a \r\nyear. In a time of recession, when Governments are \r\nA/66/PV.8  \r\n \r\n11-50546 18 \r\n \r\nlooking for ways to curtail spending, NCDs and \r\nchronic diseases threaten not only lives but also our \r\neconomies and the development of our societies.  \r\n All these facts force us to change our attitude. \r\nAddressing NCDs leads to a better life for citizens, but \r\nit ensures the sustainability of our health systems.  \r\n Greece welcomes this year’s United Nations \r\nHigh-level Meeting on Non-communicable Diseases. It \r\nis a significant occasion to discuss the issue and act at \r\nevery level of governance, whether it be global, \r\nnational or local. \r\n Greece is committed to the principles discussed \r\nin Moscow last April. We recognize that States and \r\nGovernments should be mobilized. We believe that \r\nthere is no better way to do so than through \r\ninternational collaboration. We acknowledge the \r\nimportance of the leading role of the United Nations, \r\nand the role of WHO on the matter is very significant. \r\n Currently, the Hellenic Government is working \r\non the implementation of an ambitious health reform \r\nprogramme. By the comprehensive reorganization of \r\nour national health system, we are setting new \r\npriorities. In the case of NCDs, we are giving priority \r\nto preventing the main risk factors. Through education \r\nprogrammes and media campaigns, we are stressing the \r\nimportance of physical activity and proper nutrition. \r\nWe are also once again emphasizing the importance of \r\nthe Mediterranean diet. \r\n My country is implementing new regulations for \r\nschool canteens. By discouraging the consumption of \r\nsugary beverages and high-fat or high-salt foods, we \r\nare encouraging not only children — but also their \r\nfamilies — to make better choices and lead healthier \r\nlives. In addition, new structures for nutrition and \r\nphysical activity in the Ministry of Health are aimed at \r\npromoting the message that a healthier lifestyle and \r\nprotection against the scourge of NCDs are two sides \r\nof the same coin. Also, there is room for optimism in \r\nthe fight against smoking, as the data show that there \r\nhas been a notable decrease in tobacco consumption. \r\n As part of our efforts, we are also considering \r\nnew ideas on innovative financing for health and for \r\ntackling NCDs in particular. At the First Global \r\nMinisterial Conference on Healthy Lifestyles and \r\nNon-communicable Disease Control, held in Moscow \r\nin April, Greece supported the proposal to introduce an \r\ninternational solidarity levy on tobacco. \r\n Furthermore, Greece has agreed with WHO to \r\nestablish in Athens a new WHO Athens office for \r\nNCDs, which will be exclusively dedicated to support \r\nfor policies aimed at the prevention and control of \r\nnon-communicable diseases throughout the 53 countries of \r\nthe European region of the WHO. The relevant \r\nagreement was ratified by the Greek Parliament in \r\nMarch 2011. Its inauguration will take place this \r\ncoming Friday, 23 September. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to the \r\nchair of the delegation of Tuvalu. \r\n Mr. Pita (Tuvalu): I have the distinct honour to \r\nspeak on behalf of the Prime Minister of Tuvalu, who, \r\nunfortunately, could not participate in this very \r\nimportant High-level Meeting, as he had initially \r\nintended, owing to unforeseen circumstances. \r\n Health is undoubtedly a fundamental right for \r\nevery human being on this planet and should be \r\nrespected and protected with dignity. Given the \r\nprofound changes in the world today as a consequence \r\nof the impact of global events, there is a critical and \r\nurgent need for all countries to work together in the \r\npromotion of good health for all peoples. \r\n In that regard, Tuvalu welcomes and underscores \r\nthe importance and timely convening of this High-level \r\nMeeting, which calls for an urgent global commitment \r\nin response on the prevention and control of \r\nnon-communicable diseases (NCDs). \r\n We all know that despite the seriousness of the \r\nimpact of and the challenges posed by NCDs, the \r\nresources required to combat such challenges at all \r\nlevels are not commensurate with the magnitude of the \r\nproblem. As a consequence, 8 million people are dying \r\nprematurely every year in low- and middle-income \r\ncountries from NCDs. Global economies are affected \r\nby the threat of NCDs, and efforts to integrate NCDs \r\ninto health systems, particularly at the health-care \r\nlevel, are being marginalized. \r\n At the recent meeting of the Pacific Islands \r\nForum held in New Zealand, leaders declared: “The \r\nPacific is in an NCD crisis”, and called for urgent \r\naction by their respective Governments and all \r\nstakeholders, including development partners, to \r\naddress this unfolding crisis.  \r\n Tuvalu is fully committed to cooperating in the \r\nimplementation of regional programmes on NCDs. \r\nFurthermore, in response to the crisis, Tuvalu has \r\n A/66/PV.8\r\n \r\n19 11-50546 \r\n \r\nalready taken decisive action through its national \r\nstrategic plan for NCDs 2011-2015, with the mission of \r\nobtaining the highest standard of health for its people. \r\nThe plan focuses on the four major risk factors of \r\ntobacco use, alcohol abuse, physical inactivity and \r\npoor nutrition. The Government of Tuvalu is also \r\ncommitted to developing and implementing strategies \r\nto strengthen human resources for health, including \r\npublic health and community health workers, to ensure \r\nequitable access for people to NCD prevention, early \r\ndetection, treatment and care. The plan further \r\nhighlights the specific objectives and targets for the \r\nprevention and treatment of NCDs through cooperation \r\non the part of all stakeholders, including Governments, \r\nthe private sector and civil society. \r\n Tuvalu welcomes the efforts made to accelerate \r\nthe implementation of approaches to address the social \r\ndeterminants of NCDs, including malnutrition, and \r\nreduce the vulnerability of women, children and high-\r\nrisk populations in our communities. However, like all \r\nother development partners, in the development that \r\nTuvalu pursues as a small island developing State, lack \r\nof resources and capacity is a major challenge that it \r\ncontinues to encounter. That means that we need \r\ncontinued assistance from the international community \r\nthrough a stronger partnership to implement the \r\nprogrammes required for the prevention and control of \r\nNCDs in Tuvalu. In particular, we need universal \r\naccess to affordable, high-quality essential NCD \r\nmedicines and medical technologies for the diagnosis \r\nand treatment of diabetes, hypertension, asthma, \r\ncardiovascular disease and cancer, and the integration \r\nof NCD screening into maternal and child health \r\nprogrammes. \r\n As a way forward, the Government of Tuvalu \r\nstresses the urgent need for its people, and encourages \r\nthem, to change their lifestyles and diets to reverse the \r\ncurrent situation of NCDs in Tuvalu. We believe that \r\nwe can achieve this only through the implementation of \r\nappropriate education and awareness programmes, with \r\nthe commitment of all the people of Tuvalu and \r\ncontinued support from the international community. \r\n In this context, as a least developed country that \r\ncontinues to rely on official development assistance, \r\nTuvalu strongly urges the international community and \r\nall development partners to honour their commitments \r\nthrough the urgent implementation of the Istanbul \r\nProgramme of Action for the Least Developed \r\nCountries, adopted at the United Nations Conference \r\non the Least Developed Countries held in Turkey \r\nearlier this year. \r\n In connection with this urgent need, Tuvalu \r\nwishes to acknowledge with sincere appreciation the \r\ncontinued contributions of and assistance provided by \r\nthe Republic of China on Taiwan as one of its most \r\ncommitted development partners in the prevention and \r\ncontrol of NCDs and the overall development of its \r\nhealth sector. In that regard, Tuvalu strongly urges this \r\nbody to recognize that contribution, and urges in \r\nparticular the World Health Organization (WHO) to \r\nextend the current participation of Taiwan in the World \r\nHealth Assembly to meetings of its other subsidiary \r\nbodies. Taiwan’s contribution to saving the lives of \r\nmillions of people worldwide through its health \r\ncollaboration merits its full participation in WHO \r\nmeetings. \r\n The cross-cutting issue to whose adverse impact \r\nmy country is most vulnerable to is climate change. \r\nTuvalu recommends that the issue of climate change be \r\nintegrated and mainstreamed into the NCD platform. \r\n To conclude, let us recall that if we want to save \r\nmillions of people from NCDs, the time to act is now, \r\nnot later. All countries and peoples must respond and \r\nwork together in combating NCDs now and not later. \r\nAs the Secretary-General highlighted in his 2011 \r\npriorities, success in rising to the challenge does not \r\nbelong to any one of us; it depends on all of us \r\ntogether. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of El Salvador. \r\n Mr. García González (El Salvador) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): At the outset, allow me to express, on behalf \r\nof the Government of El Salvador, our satisfaction at \r\nthe convening of this important meeting of the General \r\nAssembly to consider the issue of the prevention and \r\ncontrol of chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs).  \r\n El Salvador shares the concern of the \r\ninternational community at the global mortality rate \r\nresulting from infectious and non-communicable \r\ndiseases, which is exacerbated in the case of \r\ndeveloping countries as a result of demographic \r\ntransitions and the globalization of risk factors. This \r\nrepresents one of the greatest challenges to \r\ndevelopment in the twenty-first century. \r\n El Salvador furthermore acknowledges the \r\nprimary role and responsibility of Governments in \r\nA/66/PV.8  \r\n \r\n11-50546 20 \r\n \r\nproviding the first line of response to the challenges \r\nNCDs pose to our countries. We also acknowledge the \r\nrole of the international community and the need to \r\nstrengthen cooperation for development as a key \r\ncomplement to national efforts aimed at generating \r\neffective responses in the context of the prevention and \r\ncontrol of chronic NCDs. \r\n In this context, part of my country’s success in \r\npreventing and combating non-communicable diseases \r\nis due to international cooperation. For years, it has \r\nprovided resources so that the Government of El Salvador \r\ncan have the tools to implement its priority health \r\nprogrammes. I would like to take this opportunity to \r\nthank the United States, the European Union, Spain, \r\nJapan, Cuba and Taiwan, among others, for their \r\nsolidarity. \r\n At the first ministerial consultation of the \r\nAmericas on non-communicable diseases and obesity, \r\nwhich took place in Mexico in February, it was \r\nacknowledged that chronic non-communicable diseases \r\nare the main cause of death, premature morbidity and \r\nacquired disabilities in the Americas. The profound \r\neconomic impact that these diseases have on our \r\ncountries was also acknowledged. We agreed that the \r\nmajority of these diseases are cardiovascular and \r\nrespiratory diseases, diabetes and cancer, that they are \r\nthe result of well-known risk factors such as smoking, \r\nalcohol consumption, unhealthy diets and lack of \r\nphysical activity, and that public and intersectorial \r\nactions are required.  \r\n With regard to El Salvador and the other Central \r\nAmerican countries, we wish to bring up a chronic \r\nillness that severely impacts the health of our peoples: \r\nchronic kidney disease. It is linked to environmental \r\nfactors such as pollution and occupational risks related \r\nto agricultural practices that affect a growing number \r\nof people living in poverty, marginalization and \r\nvulnerability. This situation therefore requires the \r\ndecisive support of Governments and international \r\ncooperation, as well as the establishment of new \r\npriorities and the design of new strategic approaches. \r\nWe urge the Assembly to consider chronic kidney \r\ndisease as a priority public health problem because of \r\nits high social, economic and human cost, and because \r\nit stands in the way of the development of our \r\nsocieties.  \r\n By the same token, we call for the taking into \r\naccount of non-traditional risk factors not mentioned in \r\nthe Political Declaration (resolution 66/2, annex) but \r\nwhich are of great importance, such as workplace \r\nhazards and environmental pollution.  \r\n In conclusion, we reiterate our commitment and \r\nwillingness to work on a national plan that addresses \r\nnon-communicable diseases and their attendant risk \r\nfactors in an integrated manner as part of the indicators \r\nof the Millennium Development Goals. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of Viet Nam. \r\n Mr. Le Hoai Trung (Viet Nam): As this is the \r\nfirst time I take the floor, I would like to congratulate \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Nassir Al-Nasser, the Ambassador \r\nof Qatar, for his election as President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-sixth session. The delegation of \r\nViet Nam wishes to express its great appreciation to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, for his initiative in organizing this High-level \r\nMeeting.  \r\n We would like to align ourselves with the \r\nstatements made at the 4th meeting by the \r\nrepresentative of Indonesia on behalf of the \r\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations, and by the \r\nrepresentative of Argentina at the 7th meeting on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China. \r\n Viet Nam shares the concerns of the \r\ninternational community over the growing prevalence \r\nof non-communicable diseases. Historically, \r\nnon-communicable diseases are often associated with \r\na high level of economic development. However, as we \r\nare now aware, this is no longer true. Statistics show \r\nthat 80 per cent of the deaths related to those diseases \r\nare now in low- or middle-income countries, and more \r\nthan 90 per cent of the people who die before the age \r\nof 60 are also in low- and middle-income countries. In \r\nthose countries, non-communicable diseases not only \r\npose a threat to public health but are also a serious \r\nchallenge to development. They are thus undermining \r\nefforts toward the Millennium Development Goals. \r\n Like many other developing countries, Viet Nam \r\nis facing a double health burden. While communicable \r\ndiseases persist as a major health problem, \r\nnon-communicable diseases have sharply increased. \r\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), \r\nin Viet Nam non-communicable diseases cause more \r\nthan 350,000 deaths annually, four times more than \r\nthose from communicable diseases. Among the \r\n A/66/PV.8\r\n \r\n21 11-50546 \r\n \r\nnon-communicable diseases, cardiovascular diseases \r\naccounted for 70,000 deaths, cancer 66,000 and \r\ndiabetes 13,000. \r\n Recognizing the negative impact of \r\nnon-communicable diseases on its people and its \r\nsocio-economic development, the Government of Viet \r\nNam has identified the prevention of non-communicable \r\ndiseases as one of the key priorities in national health \r\nstrategies and policies. Viet Nam has implemented \r\nvarious programmes and strategies, such as the WHO \r\nFramework Convention on Tobacco Control, national \r\nstrategies on nutrition and other policies on the \r\nreduction of alcohol abuse and for the prevention of a \r\nnumber of non-communicable diseases.  \r\n We also established monitoring systems for \r\nnon-communicable diseases and have examined the \r\nrisk factors. We have achieved encouraging progress, \r\nespecially in controlling some of the non-communicable \r\ndiseases and risk factors such as tobacco and alcohol. A \r\ndraft law on tobacco control, prepared by the Ministry \r\nof Health, will be considered by the National \r\nAssembly.  \r\n Also recently, the Ministry of Health developed \r\nthe 2011-2015 National Target Programme on the \r\nPrevention of Non-communicable Diseases. By \r\nimplementing that Programme, Viet Nam is determined \r\nto reduce, by 2015, the number of patients that might \r\nbe related to a number of non-communicable diseases. \r\n Although the impact of non-communicable \r\ndiseases is severe, they are preventable and can be \r\ncontrolled — if interventions are early. Viet Nam \r\nwelcomes all international and regional initiatives to \r\nprevent such diseases. In that regard, I wish to express \r\nour appreciation for the efforts of the World Health \r\nOrganization and to thank the Secretary-General, all \r\nUnited Nations organizations and other partners for the \r\nsubstantive preparations for this meeting. We share \r\nmany of their recommendations. Viet Nam is \r\ncommitted to broad and effective international \r\ncooperation to address the issue of non-communicable \r\ndiseases. We believe that together we can take \r\nsignificant and successful steps forward. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of Costa Rica. \r\n Mr. Ulibarri (Costa Rica) (spoke in Spanish): We \r\nare pleased at the convening of this High-level Meeting. It \r\nhas clearly recognized that non-communicable diseases \r\nrepresent a grave problem not only with regard to \r\nhealth but also for development, due to their serious \r\neconomic effects, primarily in the less advanced \r\ncountries. Cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic \r\nrespiratory illnesses and diabetes are responsible for \r\nthe deaths of three out of every five people in the \r\nworld.  \r\n In Costa Rica, thanks to a decades-long effort, we \r\nhave been able to establish a universal and efficient \r\nsocial security system. This public health system has \r\nenabled us to successfully tackle infectious diseases, \r\nbut now we are dealing with a battle that may be more \r\ndifficult.  \r\n Eight out of 10 Costa Ricans die from \r\nnon-communicable diseases. For that reason, we \r\nbelieve this meeting to be essential. For two days it has \r\nbrought us here to discuss and exchange experiences \r\nand best practices and to identify our limitations in \r\ntackling these diseases. Furthermore, in our country \r\n23 per cent of deaths from non-communicable diseases \r\nare considered premature, in that they affect people \r\nunder the age of 60. Not only does this mean \r\nirreparable loss of life, but it also has an impact on our \r\ncountries’ economic growth, with negative effects on \r\nthe socio-economic well-being of the families affected.  \r\n In that regard, responses must come not only \r\nfrom the health sector; they must be multisectoral. In \r\nits most recent report, the World Health Organization \r\n(WHO) appeals to the international community to \r\nintensify its work in combating risk factors, both by \r\npassing laws and through education programmes that \r\nstress the importance of a healthy lifestyle, as well as \r\nthrough promoting the benefits of a healthy diet and \r\nphysical activity from a very early age.  \r\n In our country, we have developed policies aimed \r\nat cutting salt consumption in order to avoid \r\nhypertension and reduce obesity, and information \r\nprogrammes on food and more balanced diets, among \r\nothers. We have also ramped up cooperative \r\nprogrammes designed to lower risk factors, but we are \r\naware that efforts on prevention and care must be \r\nincreased if we are to have concrete results. \r\n We also need greater commitment in the area of \r\ninternational cooperation and an effort to improve the \r\nconditions that will allow developing countries, \r\nincluding middle-income countries with high rates of \r\nnon-communicable diseases, to access the financial \r\nresources they need to adequately equip their hospitals \r\nA/66/PV.8  \r\n \r\n11-50546 22 \r\n \r\nand clinics with the latest technology and train their \r\nprimary care, clinic and hospital staff. We call for the \r\nfulfilment of all official development assistance \r\ncommitments and for promoting North-South, South-\r\nSouth and triangular cooperation in this area. \r\n These past few days of discussion and the months \r\npreceding, in which we have been negotiating the \r\nPolitical Declaration resulting from this meeting \r\n(resolution 66/2, annex), should help bring about a \r\ndrop in death rates from non-communicable diseases in \r\nthe short term and give our populations a better life \r\nexpectancy. According to WHO, deaths from \r\nnon-communicable diseases are preventable as long as \r\nGovernments commit to reducing their impact and \r\neducating the population. That is why we are here, to \r\nshare our experiences and learn from others in order to \r\nformulate a joint global strategy aimed at reducing the \r\nimpact of chronic non-communicable diseases \r\nworldwide. All our citizens deserve that. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of Liechtenstein. \r\n Mr. Wenaweser (Liechtenstein): Non-communicable \r\ndiseases (NCDs) have substantial negative impacts on \r\nhuman health and development. Demographic trends \r\nsuch as ageing, rapid and unplanned urbanization and \r\nthe globalization of unhealthy lifestyles only point to a \r\nrise in NCD incidence in the future.  \r\n NCDs now impose their greatest burden on low- \r\nand middle-income countries, effectively hitting \r\nhardest those with the least capacity to cope. For many, \r\neffective treatment costs are too high. That either puts \r\naccess to health care out of reach or in effect pushes \r\nthose who receive treatment closer to or even below \r\nthe poverty line. If we are to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) by 2015, we must face \r\nthis enormous challenge now. \r\n We welcome the Political Declaration adopted \r\nyesterday (resolution 66/2, annex), with its strong \r\nfocus on prevention and on population-wide measures \r\nthat make it easier for people to adopt healthy \r\nlifestyles. The implementation of the Declaration will \r\nrequire multisectoral action to counter the behavioural, \r\nenvironmental, social and economic factors that \r\ncontribute to NCDs. Integrative planning and care for \r\nNCDs and the overall strengthening of health systems, \r\nas well as targeted interventions, will be essential. We \r\nwelcome the activities promoted in the Declaration that \r\ncontribute to this end. In calling on the World Health \r\nOrganization (WHO) to develop a comprehensive \r\nglobal monitoring framework for NCDs by 2012, \r\ndrawing a lesson from the MDG process, we have \r\nmade our commitment to addressing NCDs.  \r\n We are happy to see that the issue of indoor air \r\npollution from inefficient cooking stoves is addressed \r\nin the Declaration. Day after day, women and children \r\nsuffer disproportionately from exposure to \r\nconcentrations of toxins from indoor cooking fires, \r\nwhich contribute to a range of chronic illnesses and \r\nacute health problems and result in 1.9 million \r\npremature deaths annually. Simple, affordable \r\nsolutions exist, and we support the work of the \r\nWomen’s Refugee Commission, the Office for the \r\nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the Global \r\nAlliance for Clean Cookstoves. \r\n In our own country, everybody, including \r\nchildren, has mandatory health insurance. From birth to \r\nage nine, insurance includes a series of preventive \r\ncheck-ups undertaken by family paediatricians. The \r\nOffice of Health has focused extensively on promoting \r\nproper nutrition, including by providing counselling. A \r\nnational campaign entitled “Live Consciously” has \r\nlaunched initiatives addressing nutrition, exercise, \r\nmental health and health in the workplace. In addition, \r\nhealth education in schools raises awareness on issues \r\nsuch as nutrition, physical activity, addictive behaviour \r\nand sexuality.  \r\n This High-level Meeting comes at a crucial time, \r\nwhen we can still achieve the health and development \r\ngoals we have agreed to. We are confident that the \r\nfocus on accessible and cost-effective preventive \r\nmeasures, coupled with the development of a new \r\nglobal framework for NCDs, provides a strong \r\nfoundation for a comprehensive global response. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of Montenegro. \r\n Mr. Šćepanović (Montenegro): It is my great \r\nhonour to address the Assembly today on behalf of the \r\nGovernment of Montenegro.  \r\n The problem of non-communicable diseases has \r\nbeen raised to the level it deserves within the general \r\ndebate, not just as a problem but as the major cause of \r\ndeath for citizens of our States. Malignancies, \r\ncardiovascular disease, diabetes and respiratory \r\ndiseases cause the death of far more than half of our \r\ncitizens. Such a problem deserves a response, \r\n A/66/PV.8\r\n \r\n23 11-50546 \r\n \r\npreventive measures and specific help and treatment at \r\nthe national as well as the global level. \r\n The Government of Montenegro has set a goal, in \r\nthe report it submitted last year on the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, of reducing its death rate from \r\nchronic non-communicable diseases by 2015. Our \r\nactivities are based on three main strategies: a strategy \r\nfor the control and prevention of chronic \r\nnon-communicable diseases, a national strategy for \r\ntobacco control, and an action plan for food and \r\nnutrition. \r\n Bearing in mind that smoking is one of the \r\nleading causes of chronic respiratory disease, the \r\nGovernment of Montenegro has amended its law on \r\nlimiting the use of tobacco products this year, which \r\ncompletely prohibited the use of tobacco in public \r\nplaces, restricted advertising and imposed severe \r\npenalties for non-compliance with the law. We believe \r\nthat we are obliged, not only at the national level but \r\nthrough global action, in the short and medium term, to \r\nsubstantially reduce the number of users of those \r\nproducts, and in the long term to reduce that number to \r\na minimum, in order to provide a longer and healthier \r\nlife for generations to come. In addition to preventive \r\naction to reduce the number of smokers, it is important \r\nto promote healthy nutrition and increased physical \r\nactivity and to work to reduce the excessive use of \r\nalcohol while monitoring the success of our strategy.  \r\n We all agree that the cost of intervention is lower \r\nthan the cost of inaction, just as the cost of prevention \r\nis lower than the cost of treatment. The major part of \r\nour intervention should therefore be focused on \r\nefficient prevention at all levels, especially the \r\nmultilateral level, in order to encourage all relevant \r\nstakeholders, particularly the media, to promote values \r\nthat diminish the likelihood of these diseases \r\ndeveloping. \r\n In that context, close cooperation with food \r\nproducers is of vital importance in order to reduce the \r\nharmful ingredients that are often the basis for the \r\ndevelopment of this type of disease. That cooperation \r\nshould be undertaken in the widest context possible, \r\nincluding non-governmental organizations, governmental \r\nstructures and international organizations. \r\n The fight against non-communicable diseases is \r\nalso closely linked to other Millennium Development \r\nGoals, especially the fight against poverty, because the \r\ndeath rate is closely connected to lifestyle and food \r\nconsumption. I therefore wish to use this opportunity to \r\nreiterate the importance of accomplishing the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, despite the global \r\nfinancial crisis that struck all our economies. \r\n I believe that this High-level Meeting will \r\nappropriately define a set of preventive and control \r\nmeasures that will stimulate our national efforts and \r\ncreate conditions for us to achieve global results in the \r\ncoming years. I believe it is especially important to \r\ndesign, under the auspices of the United Nations \r\nsystem, and the World Health Organization in \r\nparticular, adequate measures of support for States with \r\nfewer opportunities and limited capacities for the \r\nefficient implementation of internationally agreed \r\nmeasures. In particular, ways should be found to \r\nprovide help in the implementation of preventive \r\nmeasures and to ensure the availability of high-quality \r\nmedicines, thereby decreasing the risk of the outbreak \r\nand spread of non-communicable diseases. Statistical \r\ncontrol of the success of those measures should also be \r\ncarried out. \r\n Finally, I wish to thank all participants here \r\ntoday. I hope that this High-level Meeting, including \r\nconclusions from the topics discussed at the round \r\ntables, will result in an unequivocal and action-oriented \r\nplan to further the fight against this global problem. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of Myanmar. \r\n Mr. Kyaw Tin (Myanmar): Allow me, first of all, \r\nto express our sincere thanks to the General Assembly \r\nand the World Health Organization (WHO) for \r\norganizing this important High-level Meeting focused \r\non the prevention and control of non-communicable \r\ndiseases (NCDs). \r\n As a member of the Association of Southeast \r\nAsian Nations (ASEAN), Myanmar aligns itself with \r\nthe statement made by His Excellency Mr. R. M. Marty \r\nM. Natalegawa, Minister for Foreign affairs of the \r\nRepublic of Indonesia, on behalf of ASEAN. \r\n As much has been said about the magnitude of \r\nthe threat of NCDs by many preceding speakers, I \r\nhardly need to stress the urgency and importance of our \r\nefforts to curb NCDs worldwide. The global burden \r\nand threat of NCDs have indeed become one of the \r\nmajor challenges undermining social and economic \r\ndevelopment and the health of millions of people \r\nthroughout the world. \r\nA/66/PV.8  \r\n \r\n11-50546 24 \r\n \r\n It is alarming to note that NCDs are a major \r\ncause of over 60 per cent of global deaths, of which \r\n80 per cent occur in developing countries. Their \r\neconomic burden will have an even greater impact on \r\nthe global economy in the next two decades. The \r\nburden and untimely loss of human life caused by \r\nNCDs are putting a heavy strain on development \r\nendeavours, posing obstacles even to achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. The challenge of \r\nNCDs has thus become not only an important health \r\nproblem but also a development issue that deserves the \r\nurgent attention of policymakers. \r\n An effective response to the global problem of \r\nNCDs will require collective global action, with the \r\nactive and informed participation of all stakeholders. \r\nWe hope that this High-level Meeting will provide an \r\nopportunity to adopt a global strategy and measures, \r\nincluding the strengthening of national capacities to \r\naffectively address the prevention and control of NCDs \r\nin developing countries. \r\n My own country, Myanmar, is included among \r\nthe 23 high-burden developing countries that account \r\nfor around 80 per cent of the total burden of chronic \r\ndisease mortality. Fully aware of their impact on health \r\nand development, Myanmar has attached high priority \r\nto NCDs in its health and development plans. It is also \r\ncooperating with ASEAN in addressing this grave \r\nchallenge. \r\n At the national level, Myanmar has been carrying \r\nout NCD prevention and control activities, in line with \r\nthe WHO 2000 Global Strategy for Surveillance, \r\nPrevention and Control of NCDs and its 2008-2013 \r\nAction Plan for the Global Strategy for the Prevention \r\nand Control of Non-communicable Diseases. Our NCD \r\ncontrol activities are implemented as vertical projects \r\nunder our hospital care programmes in the national \r\nhealth plan for the period 2006-2011. To address the \r\nNCD burden more effectively, NCDs are defined as \r\none of the main strategic areas in the national health \r\nplan, which covers various areas, including four major \r\nNCDs. \r\n The control of smoking and consumption of \r\ntobacco products law was enacted on 4 May 2006. \r\nEarly this year, the WHO 2010 Global \r\nRecommendations on Physical Activities for Health \r\nwere adopted and adapted in Myanmar. We have also \r\ndeveloped an action plan on physical activity for health \r\nas part of our measures for the prevention of NCDs. \r\n A high-level national multisectoral mechanism \r\nwill be established in the very near future to coordinate \r\nwith all stakeholders, including sectors outside health. \r\nMoreover, Myanmar is in the process of enacting a \r\nnational policy on the prevention and control of NCDs. \r\nSuch national efforts of developing countries should be \r\nsupported by the international community through the \r\nprovision of financial and technical assistance. \r\n Myanmar welcomes the outcome document \r\nadopted by this High-level Meeting yesterday \r\n(resolution 66/2, annex), which will set a new global \r\nagenda and generate political will to address the \r\nimportant issue of NCDs.  \r\n In conclusion, my delegation wishes to reiterate \r\nits commitment to participating actively in global and \r\nregional networks to enhance efforts for the prevention \r\nand control of NCDs. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of Cambodia. \r\n Mr. Sea (Cambodia): My country wishes to align \r\nitself with the statement made at the 4th meeting by the \r\nrepresentative of Indonesia on behalf of the \r\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations and with the \r\nstatement made at the 7th meeting by the representative of \r\nArgentina on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. \r\n Cambodia is challenged by the epidemic of \r\nnon-communicable diseases (NCDs). While it is \r\nrecognized that poverty, the globalization of trade and \r\nmarketing, urbanization and other social determinants \r\nare among the principal contributing factors to the \r\nspread of NCDs, the burden of these diseases is a grave \r\nconcern in Cambodia. The main risk factors are \r\ntobacco use, unhealthy diet, lack of physical activity \r\nand harmful use of alcohol, which lead to heart disease, \r\ncancer, diabetes and other chronic diseases. \r\n In urban areas of Cambodia 6 per cent of adults \r\nhave diabetes and 17 per cent have high blood \r\npressure, while in rural areas 2 per cent of adults have \r\ndiabetes and 10 per cent were found to be hypertensive. \r\nEight in every 10 people in Cambodia have one or two \r\nrisk factors for developing NCDs, and one in every \r\n10 has three or more. NCDs accounted for 46 per cent \r\nof all deaths in 2008 — approximately 957 males and \r\n592 females per 100,000 persons. \r\n These diseases are largely preventable. Therefore, \r\nCambodia has made its best efforts in responding to the \r\n A/66/PV.8\r\n \r\n25 11-50546 \r\n \r\nchallenge of NCDs. My country commits to act in \r\nseveral ways. \r\n First, we are developing and strengthening \r\nmultisectoral public policies to maximize the positive \r\nimpacts on NCD risk factors and burdens that result \r\nfrom policies of other sectors and to minimize their \r\nnegative impacts. \r\n Secondly, we are giving priority to the prevention \r\nand control of NCDs, ensuring complementarities with \r\nother health objectives and mainstreaming \r\nmultisectoral policies to strengthen the engagement of \r\nother sectors.  \r\n Thirdly, we are implementing cost-effective \r\npolicies such as fiscal policies, regulations and other \r\nmeasures to reduce common risk factors. \r\n Fourthly, Cambodia is implementing effective \r\nnational and global policies for prevention and control, \r\nincluding policies relevant to achieving the goals of the \r\n2008-2013 Action Plan for the Global Strategy for the \r\nPrevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases.  \r\n Fifthly, we are integrating NCD-related services \r\ninto primary health-care services through health \r\nsystems. \r\n Sixthly, we are promoting access to \r\ncomprehensive and cost-effective prevention, treatment \r\nand care for integrated management of NCDs, \r\nincluding access to affordable, safe, effective and high-\r\nquality medicines.  \r\n Lastly, we are promoting, translating and \r\ndisseminating research to identify the causes of NCDs \r\nand effective strategies for their prevention and \r\ncontrol. \r\n Cambodia fully supports the important role of the \r\ninternational community and international cooperation \r\nin assisting Cambodia and other developing countries \r\nin complementing their efforts to generate a successful \r\nresponse to NCDs. \r\n The Acting President: In accordance with \r\nresolution 477 (V) of 1 November 1950, I now call on \r\nthe observer of the League of Arab States. \r\n Ms. Bahous (League of Arab States) (spoke in \r\nArabic): Allow me to thank the United Nations on \r\nbehalf of Mr. Nabil El Araby, the Secretary-General of \r\nthe League of Arab States, for all the efforts made in \r\nvarious spheres of development. He wishes all success \r\nin implementing the goals of the meeting, which is of \r\ninterest to the populations of the Arab world and of the \r\nentire world. I also thank the World Health \r\nOrganization for all its efforts and its guiding role in \r\norganizing this important meeting, especially in this \r\nperiod that the Arab region is going through, which \r\nrequires that the Arab world and the international \r\ncommunity pull together to realize the aspirations of \r\nthe Arab population for a better world, including the \r\nright to health care, to a decent life, to prevention of \r\nnon-communicable diseases (NCDs) and, of course, to \r\nimproved medical services. \r\n I wish to take this great opportunity to reaffirm \r\nthat the League of Arab States, through its own health-\r\ncare mechanisms — with the Ministers of the Arab \r\nHealth Council at the head — attributes particular \r\nimportance to our meeting and to its outcome. \r\n The challenge of health care facing the Arab \r\nregion in the sphere of NCDs and their risks, as well as \r\nthe illnesses that continue to spread, is the greatest \r\nburden for Arab medical systems. They are the biggest \r\nobstacles to development. Cardiovascular and arterial \r\nillnesses are the primary cause of death, along with \r\ndiabetes, cancer and hypertension at levels that pose a \r\ndual threat to individuals and to young, developing \r\nsocieties. \r\n Research shows that the level of NCDs in our \r\nregion is steadily rising, particularly among those \r\nbetween 15 and 59 years of age. These illnesses are a \r\ndual development challenge for our States in \r\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs), above all for the lowest-income States. They \r\nare spreading in societies that are still in the first stages \r\nof economic development and are suffering from a lack \r\nof resources for taking effective measures to combat \r\nthem and their impact on young people — who are the \r\nmost numerous in the Arab world. All these factors \r\nimpact negatively on productive output and on \r\nsocio-economic life.  \r\n In implementation of the resolutions of the \r\nLeague of Arab States at the summit of 2010 in Sirte \r\nand the meetings in Kuwait in 2009 and in Sharm \r\nel-Sheik in 2011, the Arab plan of action has been \r\ndeveloped to improve basic medical services and \r\nfamily medicine in the Arab States for the years 2011-\r\n2016. The primary strategic goal of the plan is to \r\ncombat NCDs through both integrating NCD services \r\nin national medical services and improving the quality \r\nA/66/PV.8  \r\n \r\n11-50546 26 \r\n \r\nof care given to patients. I also speak of quick \r\ndiagnosis and testing to reduce the economic and social \r\nburden for society in general.  \r\n All this is based on the principle of primary \r\nmedical services and achievement of the MDGs. The \r\nArab States have given priority to the subject. The \r\nArab Group before the World Health Assembly in May \r\nthis year called for the inclusion of NCDs in the \r\nMDGs. Also, in February this year the Health Ministers \r\nof the States of the Gulf Cooperation Council adopted \r\nthe general framework for the national executive plans \r\nof the Gulf States for combating NCDs by \r\nimplementing plans focusing on prevention, promotion \r\nof health care and supporting the special commissions \r\non combating diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, \r\ntobacco use and medical outreach and awareness. \r\n An international Arab conference on NCDs will \r\nbe held in 2012 in Saudi Arabia, in cooperation with \r\nthe League of Arab States and the Council of Arab \r\nHealth Care Ministers. Another Arab conference on \r\nmaternal health will take place in Beirut in 2012, in \r\ncooperation with the United Nations Population Fund, \r\nas part of the ongoing Arab promotion of serious \r\ndevelopment partnerships to combat the dangers of \r\nNCDs, which increasingly threaten progress and \r\ndevelopment in the Arab world.  \r\n We are also interested in reducing NCD risk \r\nfactors to which individuals and societies are exposed, \r\nsuch as smoking, unhealthy diets, lack of physical \r\nexercise, alcohol consumption and environmental \r\npollution. We focus on promoting prevention and \r\nmedical outreach programmes to combat these \r\ndangerous diseases.  \r\n Overall, the Arab region has made progress in \r\nimproving medical services, but it is difficult for low-\r\nincome, less developed Arab States to make tangible \r\nprogress in this sphere, particularly in light of the \r\nchallenges that the Arab States and the entire Arab \r\nregion are facing. Therefore, the current and future \r\nstages will require consideration of the socio-economic \r\nimpact of NCDs. It is important to benefit from \r\npositive experiences and data that can help developing \r\nStates, especially the least developed, in their efforts to \r\nprevent and control these diseases.  \r\n Scientific research is of particular importance. \r\nGovernments must increase their funding of scientific \r\nresearch on NCDs to provide accurate data and \r\ninformation that would promote national and \r\ninternational initiatives to control them, including Arab \r\nnational health plans of action, with an eye to fostering \r\nsustainable development. \r\n Finally, I would like to thank the United Nations \r\nand the World Health Organization, including its \r\nRegional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean, for \r\ntheir earnest cooperation and regular support to \r\ninitiatives of the League of Arab States and the Council \r\nof Arab Health Care Ministers in all spheres of health \r\ncare. It is vital to integrate strategies to fight NCDs \r\ninto national health and development plans and \r\nstrategies. We must find a mechanism for appropriate \r\nfunding and encourage Governments to lend their \r\nsupport and national resources to combat these diseases \r\nand to develop monitoring and implementation \r\nmechanisms. We should promote partnerships between \r\nArab Governments and the private sector, including \r\ncivil society, to fulfil our social responsibility. It is \r\nimportant to support individual countries in launching \r\ntheir own programmes and initiatives against these \r\ndiseases and to foster partnerships among States to \r\npromote socio-economic development, improved \r\npublic health and the right of all peoples of the region \r\nto universal health care, development and a decent life. \r\n The Acting President: In accordance with \r\nresolution 57/32 of 19 November 2002, I now call on \r\nthe observer of the Inter-Parliamentary Union. \r\n Ms. Filip (Inter-Parliamentary Union): I am most \r\nhonoured to deliver this statement today on behalf of \r\nMr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, Speaker of the National \r\nAssembly of Namibia and President of the \r\nInter-Parliamentary Union. \r\n Today’s High-level Meeting on the Prevention \r\nand Control of Non-communicable Diseases takes \r\nplace at a critical time, as policymakers and health \r\npractitioners try to come to grips with the \r\nunprecedented impact of non-communicable diseases \r\non citizens and societies. \r\n For the Inter-Parliamentary Union, the spread and \r\nimpact of non-communicable diseases are not just \r\nhealth issues; they are also political questions that have \r\nto do with lifestyles. Parliamentarians therefore have \r\nan important role to play in advocating for change in \r\nlifestyle and behaviour, helping citizens make healthy \r\nchoices, standing up against the commercial interests \r\nof powerful corporations, allocating resources, and \r\nlegislating and promoting constructive policies, \r\n A/66/PV.8\r\n \r\n27 11-50546 \r\n \r\nincluding increased taxation, reduced marketing and \r\npublic awareness initiatives. \r\n The most important message that should be \r\nshared with legislators around the world is that lives \r\ncan be saved with effective regulations. We have heard \r\nthroughout this meeting, for example, that tobacco use \r\ncontinues to be the leading preventable cause of death. \r\nIn order to help overcome the non-communicable \r\ndisease crisis, parliamentarians should make \r\ncontrolling tobacco use an urgent policy priority. \r\nSigning and implementing the World Health \r\nOrganization Framework Convention on Tobacco \r\nControl is a first step in this direction. We hereby call \r\non all parliaments to take action and translate that \r\ninternational instrument into sound legislative and \r\nregulatory frameworks at the national level. \r\n We have no doubt that implementing change will \r\nbe a challenging task. People in many parts of the \r\nworld face major barriers to making healthy choices, \r\nand are instead confronted with social and other \r\npressures that lead to unhealthy lifestyles. But a \r\nnumber of parliaments are taking action; the French \r\nParliament has recently announced a policy to increase \r\ntaxes on alcohol, tobacco and sugary drinks in order to \r\nboost its internal revenue and improve the health of the \r\nnation. Other parliaments are also undertaking similar \r\ninitiatives. \r\n We at the Inter-Parliamentary Union will be \r\nencouraging all of our member parliaments to join the \r\nglobal effort to combat non-communicable diseases. \r\nWe will start by informing parliaments and raising \r\nawareness around the outcome of this week’s High-\r\nlevel Meeting. We will further remain committed to \r\nengaging with legislators and sharing good practices \r\nwith a view to building political momentum and \r\nhelping parliaments create enabling legal environments \r\nfor the prevention and control of non-communicable \r\ndiseases. We look forward to working closely with \r\neveryone here throughout that process. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nMr. Stefan Seebacher, Head of the Health Department \r\nof the International Federation of Red Cross and Red \r\nCrescent Societies.  \r\n Mr. Seebacher (International Federation of Red \r\nCross and Red Crescent Societies): The International \r\nFederation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies \r\n(IFRC) appreciates the opportunity to address this \r\nHigh-Level Meeting on the Prevention and Control of \r\nNon-communicable Diseases (NCDs).  \r\n No one can doubt that today NCDs are the \r\nleading threat to health and development. Yet these \r\ndiseases could be prevented by eliminating shared risk \r\nfactors. The impact of non-communicable diseases \r\naffects every country, but it is larger in middle- and \r\nlow-income countries, where premature deaths caused \r\nby NCDs carry a huge economic and social burden.  \r\n While effective treatment of NCDs is essential, \r\nnational policies on early action and prevention are \r\ncritical. Preventing the onset of chronic illness will \r\nultimately save Governments valuable time and money \r\nand relieve the burden on often overstretched health-\r\ncare resources. The development of better and more \r\naccessible screening programmes, combined with \r\nwider public awareness, could also dramatically reduce \r\nthe number of NCD-related deaths.  \r\n Humanitarian organizations such as the Red \r\nCross and Red Crescent societies, whose staff and \r\nvolunteers work closely with local communities, play \r\nan enormous role in bringing about changes in \r\nbehaviour and attitudes towards health and lifestyle. \r\nWe at the IFRC strongly believe that including NCDs \r\nin our health programmes is consistent with our \r\nFederation’s Strategy 2020 to enable healthy and safe \r\nliving. We have developed a framework for NCD \r\nprevention and control. The framework focuses on \r\nprevention, innovation, research, monitoring, \r\nevaluation, partnership and advocacy.  \r\n Prevention has to start at the community level, \r\nwith people being better informed and better equipped \r\nto take care of their own health. That is precisely where \r\nour national Red Cross and Red Crescent societies can \r\nplay a critical role in contributing to the global effort. \r\nIn their auxiliary roles to Governments, national Red \r\nCross and Red Crescent societies can work hand in \r\nhand with national authorities and other health actors \r\nto provide quality programmes and services. Such a \r\ncontribution, largely based on prevention, would \r\nimprove the inequitable conditions of daily living \r\nthrough resilience-based and community-based health \r\nprogramming, in line with the World Health \r\nOrganization 2008-2013 Action Plan for the Global \r\nStrategy for the Prevention and Control of \r\nNon-communicable Diseases, with a strong emphasis \r\non prevention. \r\nA/66/PV.8  \r\n \r\n11-50546 28 \r\n \r\n The President returned to the Chair. \r\n The potential of volunteers remains vital to \r\nimplementing any NCD plan at the country level, with \r\na community-based health approach with a specific \r\nfocus on a holistic approach rather than vertical disease \r\nintervention. The Red Cross and Red Crescent National  \r\nSocieties have a long-standing history of disease \r\nprevention and health promotion. In their \r\ncomplementary role to Governments, they are in a \r\nunique position to be pioneers in implementing NCD \r\nprevention programmes, using a holistic health \r\napproach. \r\n  The meeting rose at 6 p.m. \r\n"
