It has been \r\na particularly turbulent time, but one during which the \r\naspirations of many peoples who had suffered long \r\nconflicts and armed confrontation have been furthered. \r\nCountries like Liberia, Sierra Leone and Côte d’Ivoire \r\nare now making strides towards peacebuilding and the \r\nrule of law. \r\nIn Libya, a ruthless tyranny in place for more than 40 \r\nyears was dismantled in a process in which the Security \r\nCouncil played a decisive role. My Government did \r\nnot hesitate to condemn the violent repression of the \r\ncivilian population justly clamouring for the exercise \r\nof their fundamental rights. That is why we joined the \r\nCouncil’s decisions furthering a transition towards \r\na democracy that, although still fragile, enjoys the \r\nsupport of the international community as it seeks to \r\nentrench itself. There are still violent groups that want \r\nto sabotage that process by terrorist methods. I take \r\nthis opportunity to condemn in the strongest terms the \r\ndespicable attack perpetrated against the United States \r\nconsulate in Benghazi. Extremism, terrorism and \r\ndisregard for human life cannot be allowed to persist.\r\nToday, the Arab world is experiencing a \r\nfundamental political transformation, opening the \r\nway towards democracy. If the process is to last, it \r\nwill require respect for people’s rights and the creation \r\nof conditions conducive to sustainable economic \r\ndevelopment. We hope that participation by citizens, \r\nespecially women, will continue to increase and foster \r\ndemocratic systems and opportunities for development \r\nand welfare.\r\nWith regard to the dire situation in Syria for more \r\nthan a year and half, I must express our deep frustration \r\nwith the inability of the international community to put \r\nUnited Nations A/67/PV.10\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-seventh session\r\n10th plenary meeting\r\nWednesday, 26 September 2012, 3 p.m.\r\nNew York\r\nOffi cial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Jeremić . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Serbia)\r\n2 12-52207\r\nA/67/PV.10\r\nan end to the tragedy that every day takes more and more \r\nSyrian lives. From this rostrum, we reiterate our call \r\nfor an end to the attacks and for a political negotiation \r\nthat will meet the legitimate aspirations of all sectors \r\nof Syrian society. Implementing Kofi Annan’s six-point \r\nplan would greatly contribute to facilitating a Syrian-\r\nled political transition. We strongly support the new \r\nJoint Special Representative of the United Nations \r\nand the League of Arab States, Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, \r\nand wish him much success in his very complex and \r\ndifficult task.\r\nAs a representative of a country that is currently \r\na member of the Security Council, I would like to \r\nbriefly turn to the matter of its reform, which has \r\nbeen under discussion for 20 years. Colombia believes \r\nthat consensus should be our guide in developing a \r\ncomprehensive approach that includes change in both \r\nthe Council’s composition and its working methods so \r\nas to promote more effectively the United Nations goals \r\nof peace, well-being and humanity. \r\nIn our hemisphere, one country that requires \r\ncomprehensive peacebuilding is Haiti. We continue to \r\nwork for Haiti. Its recovery will require our continuous \r\nsupport in strengthening its capacities, institutions \r\nand productivity so as to generate employment, reduce \r\nextreme poverty and promote the United Nations work \r\nfor development in the country. I urge everyone to \r\npersevere in that cause.\r\nA key event for the world this year was the United \r\nNations Conference on Sustainable Development \r\n(Rio+20). Inspired by the Millennium Development \r\nGoals model, Colombia led the proposal to establish \r\nthe sustainable development goals, which was the \r\nmost important outcome of the Rio+20 process. Today, \r\nthe sustainable development goals promise to be a \r\nfundamental component of the planet’s development \r\nagenda, and the Secretary-General himself has \r\nidentified them as one of the five priorities of his \r\nlegacy. We are therefore especially pleased that our \r\nForeign Minister has been invited to be a member of the \r\nhigh-level panel on the post-2015 development agenda, \r\nwhich held its first meeting yesterday.\r\nThis year, the sixth Summit of the Americas gathered \r\nin Colombia, with 30 Heads of State and Government \r\nfrom the western hemisphere in attendance. It was a \r\nfruitful gathering, which for the first time we organized \r\nsimultaneously with a business summit attended by the \r\nleaders of the premier companies of the Americas. We \r\nalso held a social forum that brought together people \r\nfrom diverse social organizations on the continents. \r\nThe Summit of the Americas in Cartagena was \r\ncharacterized by frank and open dialogue about the \r\nmost crucial issues for the region and the world. The \r\nGovernments of the Americas agreed to undertake \r\nan analysis and discussion of the track record, \r\neffectiveness and future prospects of the so-called war \r\non drugs, as well as possible alternatives to it. It is our \r\nduty to question with scientific objectivity whether we \r\nare doing the best we can or if there are better options \r\nto more effectively combating the scourge. To that end, \r\nwe mandated the Organization of American States \r\nto begin an analysis and discussion, inviting other \r\nentities — the first of which would be, of course, the \r\nUnited Nations — to participate.\r\nThat is only a first step, but it is of great importance \r\nbecause it is the beginning of a discussion that the \r\nworld has avoided for many years. We hope that it will \r\nultimately yield concrete results. The debate about \r\ndrugs that have caused so much harm throughout the \r\nworld and to my country must be frank and, most \r\ncertainly, global. \r\nSimilarly, in my statement before the General \r\nAssembly two years ago, I expressed my conviction \r\nthat the dawning decade should be the decade of \r\nLatin America and the Caribbean — a decade that \r\nwould consolidate that region of the world as a region \r\nof peace, progress and solutions for the rest of the \r\nplanet. Today, we are pleased to note that our region \r\nis indeed experiencing a favourable moment with solid \r\neconomies, functional democracies and no current \r\nconflict among the nations of which it is formed. \r\nRegional coordination mechanisms of relatively \r\nrecent establishment, such as the Union of South \r\nAmerican Nations and the Community of Latin \r\nAmerican and Caribbean States, are evidence of the \r\nresolve of our countries and peoples to cooperate. I \r\nwould like to highlight the enormous potential of the \r\nPacific Alliance that was formalized this year among \r\nMexico, Peru, Colombia and Chile. The Alliance is \r\nopen to the participation of other States with which we \r\nseek to strengthen not only trade but also political and \r\nhuman ties, as well as to the nations of the immense \r\nPacific basin.\r\nI cannot conclude without referring to the special \r\nmoment that our country is currently experiencing. \r\nAgainst the backdrop of international turbulence, we \r\n12-52207 3\r\nA/67/PV.10\r\nWith regard to my statement today, a few days ago I \r\nasked the Colombian people through social media what \r\nmessage they wanted me to bring here to the General \r\nAssembly. Among the many messages I received, I \r\nwant to share one from my compatriot Henry Rodríguez \r\nChacón: “An entire generation wants to wake up one \r\nday to the news of a peace agreement.” That is the most \r\nheartfelt wish of the Colombian people. \r\nAware that the process must have brief deadlines \r\nand precise terms if it is to be successful, I trust that \r\nI will be able to deliver to the Assembly next year a \r\npositive outcome of the effort, which we undertake \r\nenthusiastically with a view to ending our 50-year \r\nconflict.\r\nWe do not want to talk just about peace; we want \r\nto build conditions for peace. That is what we are doing \r\non a daily basis with the actions of our Government and \r\nnow with the talks that we are initiating. Today, with \r\ngreat hope, we present the world with this new special \r\nmoment for my country, Colombia. \r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Republic of Colombia for the statement he has \r\njust made. \r\nMr. Juan Manuel Santos Calderón, President of \r\nthe Republic of Colombia, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by His Majesty King Mswati III, Head of \r\nState of the Kingdom of Swaziland\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Head of \r\nState of the Kingdom of Swaziland.\r\nHis Majesty King Mswati III, Head of State of \r\nthe Kingdom of Swaziland, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to the \r\nUnited Nations His Majesty King Mswati III, Head of \r\nState of the Kingdom of Swaziland, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nKing Mswati: It is an immense pleasure for me \r\nto join other Heads of State and Government at this \r\nsixty-seventh session of the General Assembly. I should \r\nlike to begin by congratulating the President upon \r\nhis election to steer the work of the Assembly at this \r\nhave been successful in maintaining a healthy economy \r\nthat has generated over 2 million new jobs over the \r\ncourse of two years, attesting to the major progress \r\nwe have made in reducing poverty. We have put in \r\nplace initiatives of great social impact, such as a law \r\nfor victims, which is the only legislation in the world \r\nthat seeks to return lands to displaced peasants and \r\nto compensate the victims of a conflict that remains \r\nongoing; or major hydrocarbon and mining royalties \r\nreform to more fairly distribute the revenues generated \r\nby such activities, and thereby promote more effective \r\nsocial development. \r\nNevertheless, our progress, which has been \r\nremarkable, has been curtailed by an absurd conflict \r\nthat has now lasted half a century. Today, Colombia \r\nis suffering through the most prolonged internal \r\narmed conflict in its hemisphere, indeed perhaps one \r\nof the longest-lasting in the world — an ever-more \r\nanachronistic and inexplicable conflict. Above all, it \r\nis inexplicable in the light of the development of our \r\ndemocracy and of our social progress. \r\nAware of that, and without neglecting the \r\nprotection and security of the Colombian people and \r\nwithout ceding an inch in the fight against terrorism \r\nand crime, my Government is resolved to move forward \r\nprudently, seriously and firmly, and without repeating \r\nthe mistakes of the past, by entering into conversations \r\nwith the guerrilla forces in order to achieve an end to \r\nthe armed conflict. \r\nAfter two years of exploratory contacts, we have \r\nannounced to the country and to the world that a \r\nphase of talks will be initiated on a short and concrete \r\nagenda, which we hope will allow us to achieve the \r\ndesired outcome. The talks will begin in Oslo during \r\nthe first half of October and will continue in Havana, \r\nthanks to the goodwill of the Governments of Norway \r\nand Cuba, which will serve as guarantors. We will also \r\nhave the backing of the Government of Venezuela, to \r\nwhich we are grateful for its valuable support, and of \r\nthe Government of Chile, which will be working with \r\nus during the second phase.\r\nToday, before the General Assembly, I wish to \r\nthank the international community for the support it has \r\nexpressed at outset of the talks and for its willingness \r\nto cooperate and help in any way that is necessary. We \r\nembark upon the talks with moderate optimism and in \r\nthe absolute conviction that it is an opportunity that \r\nwe cannot squander to achieve a peace that is good not \r\nonly for Colombia but for the entire region.\r\n4 12-52207\r\nA/67/PV.10\r\nsession. His experience and abilities are well known \r\nand respected. We have full confidence that he will \r\ntake the Organization to greater heights. The Kingdom \r\nof eSwatini is ready to give him all the support that he \r\ndeserves in carrying out this mammoth task.\r\nI also wish to thank the Secretary-General for his \r\ndetailed report on the work of the Organization (A/67/1). \r\nWe have seen the staff of the United Nations working \r\nvery hard, sometimes in very difficult and hostile \r\nenvironments, dedicating their service to helping those \r\nwho require our assistance and support. The Kingdom \r\nof eSwatini commends the Secretary-General and his \r\ndedicated team for working tirelessly to ensure the \r\nrealization of all aspirations of the Organization.\r\nAs we gather here, we must always remember \r\nthat the role of the United Nations is to keep peace \r\nthroughout the world, to develop and to help nations to \r\nwork together in resolving challenges such as hunger, \r\nunemployment, conflicts, disease and illiteracy, among \r\nothers. The United Nations also aims to be the centre \r\nfor harmonizing the actions of nations to achieve our \r\naspirations.\r\nWe are meeting here at a time when the whole \r\nworld is facing numerous challenges, such as the \r\neconomic and financial crisis. The Kingdom of \r\neSwatini believes that the United Nations is the \r\nappropriate forum to deliberate on these challenges \r\nin order to come up with united global solutions. As \r\npart of the global community, the Kingdom of eSwatini \r\nhas not been spared from this economic predicament. \r\nOur social development programmes that enhance the \r\ndelivery of the Millennium Development Goals and \r\nnational projects, such as job creation and poverty \r\nalleviation strategies, have been adversely affected \r\nby the prevailing situation. The gains we have made \r\nin the fight against HIV and AIDS through the rollout \r\nof antiretroviral treatments remain threatened by the \r\nuncertainty around the financial sustainability of the \r\nprogramme.\r\nWe wish to acknowledge the support we continue \r\nto receive from the Global Fund to fight HIV/AIDS, \r\nTuberculosis and Malaria in mitigating all diseases. \r\nThe Fund has gone a long way in injecting resources \r\ninto our national programme of promoting health as \r\na key national priority. The need to work together to \r\novercome these challenges could not have been more \r\nessential.\r\nIn our efforts to address global economic challenges, \r\nwe should be conscious of the social implications of \r\nsome of the proposed solutions. Our strategies should \r\nnot create more hardship, but rather find answers that \r\nmitigate the difficulties we face. I am confident that, \r\nwith our wealth of different experiences, we stand \r\nto benefit from valuable strategies, especially from \r\nthose States that have not been seriously affected by \r\nthe financial crisis. We urge those countries to share \r\ntheir experiences for the benefit of all Member States. \r\nThe Kingdom of eSwatini calls on the United Nations \r\nto consider making these challenges among its top \r\npriorities during this session.\r\nThe Kingdom of eSwatini last month converged \r\non Sibaya for dialogue on social, economic and \r\npolitical issues with a view to crafting solutions and \r\nagreeing on a way forward that would best improve our \r\nlivelihoods. Sibaya is a place where every citizen is free \r\nto participate irrespective of gender, creed, religion or \r\naffiliation, among other things. We believe in the full \r\nparticipation of all citizens at the grass-roots level in the \r\ndecision-making process. This forum is an institution \r\nwhere key national pronouncements are made and \r\nnational sustainable development strategies conceived. \r\nOur national Constitution and National Development \r\nStrategy are outputs of this structure. This practice has \r\nbeen passed on from generation to generation, and has \r\ncontinued to serve us well, since it allows the people to \r\ncontribute to their own welfare.\r\nLike many other States Member of the Organization, \r\nthe Kingdom of eSwatini has been working hard \r\ntowards the ratification of United Nations conventions, \r\nas well as of continental and regional protocols. I am \r\npleased to inform the Assembly that the Sibaya forum \r\nprovided the whole nation with an opportunity to \r\ndiscuss those conventions and protocols, which have \r\nsince been ratified by Parliament and deposited with \r\nthe Secretary-General. We are pleased that we can now \r\nbe counted among the countries that have successfully \r\nratified United Nations conventions and protocols.\r\nThe world we live in has become a complicated \r\nplace with the advent of modern technology. We remain \r\nfaced with the challenge of how best to take advantage \r\nof this technology, such as social media, to promote \r\npeace and stability. If there is anything we need to do, it \r\nis to promote peace in the world. It is true, and we fully \r\nagree with the assertion that there is no need to promote \r\nviolence of any kind, be it the killing of diplomats, the \r\nforced removal of Governments, or any other form. In \r\n12-52207 5\r\nA/67/PV.10\r\nthis world, we must all live together in peace, whether as \r\nMuslims, Christians or any other traditional believers. \r\nWe must learn to respect each other irrespective of \r\nrace, creed or religious affiliation. If we practiced those \r\nprinciples, the world would be altogether a different \r\nand better place. As human beings, we must turn the \r\npage, forget the past and live together for the benefit of \r\ngenerations to come.\r\nOn the African continent, we are encouraged by \r\nthe concerted efforts of our fellow brothers and sisters \r\nwho are committed to resolving their differences in \r\na peaceful manner. We encourage speedy resolutions \r\nin areas where pockets of conflict remain, such as the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, the Sudan and some \r\nNorth African countries, to mention but a few. \r\nThe Assembly knows that Somalia has also been \r\nwithout a stable Government for a long time, and we \r\nhope that new developments will bring about lasting \r\npeace. In that vein, the Kingdom of eSwatini welcomes \r\nthe recent development that has taken place in Somalia. \r\nWe hope that the election of the President will bring the \r\ndesired stability.\r\nWe extend the call for peace beyond Africa, to the \r\nMiddle East, where we continue to witness conflict. The \r\nwar in Syria has claimed the lives of too many citizens \r\nand must come to an end. We appeal to the people of \r\nSyria to discourage the use of force in resolving their \r\ndifferences. We encourage the use of dialogue in cases \r\nwhere they do not see eye to eye. We implore the Syrian \r\nGovernment and the other stakeholders to sit down in \r\ndialogue in order to find a lasting solution to the current \r\nimpasse. The barrel of the gun will bring nothing but \r\nmisery. \r\nThe United Nations and the League of Arab States \r\nhave sent a Joint Special Representative to work with \r\nthe people of Syria. We hope that all stakeholders will \r\nmake good use of the Joint Special Representative \r\ntowards finding a peaceful and lasting solution to their \r\ndifferences. The Kingdom of eSwatini urges States \r\nMembers of the United Nations to work together in \r\nsupporting all efforts aimed at helping the people of \r\nSyria to resolve the conflict.\r\nWe also note that the Israel-Palestine conflict \r\nremains unresolved. A peaceful settlement of the issue \r\nis deeply desired and urgently necessary. Our position \r\nis unambiguous. The most viable solution is to have the \r\ntwo States of Israel and Palestine coexisting side by \r\nside in peace and harmony.\r\nWe must commend the recent positive developments \r\nwith regard to relations between the Republic of \r\nChina on Taiwan and mainland China, which are \r\nsteadily improving. Indeed, it is very encouraging \r\nas it demonstrates that the tensions between the two \r\ncountries have subsided. We hope that one day they \r\nwill be able to resolve all of their differences and live \r\nhappily with each other. We are witnessing increasing \r\ntrade, as well as f lights, between the two countries. \r\nRecently, it was also interesting to see mainland China \r\nhost an African summit, to which the countries that are \r\nfriends of Taiwan were also invited.\r\nAs an African country, we would like to thank \r\nmainland China for its continued support to African \r\ncountries. We have no doubt that the potential of the \r\ntwo peoples working together side by side will make \r\na significant difference in the world. We hope that the \r\nnew developments will pave the way for Taiwan to \r\nparticipate fully in all United Nations entities, because \r\nthe people of Taiwan desire to become part of the global \r\ncommunity.\r\nPeace will continue to elude us until we properly \r\naddress the issue of weapons of mass destruction. \r\nIt is clear that those weapons are not necessary to \r\nhumankind. Their mere presence is a recipe for conflict \r\nas each country seeks to gain power over others. The \r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, \r\nadopted by many Member States, must be enforced to \r\nensure the complete elimination of these weapons. \r\nWe have not seen any tangible proof of compliance \r\nwith the internationally agreed time frames, which \r\nis a cause for serious concern requiring urgent \r\nattention. The mere existence of those weapons creates \r\nunnecessary tension that could result in a very hostile \r\nworld environment. We implore those countries \r\nendowed with uranium resources to use them for other \r\nessential economic development needs, such as power \r\ngeneration.\r\nThe Kingdom of eSwatini recognizes the important \r\nrole that the Security Council plays in the pursuit of \r\ninternational peace and security. The Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations clearly stipulates an international order \r\nthat ensures the rule of law. We call upon the General \r\nAssembly at this session to deliberate on Security \r\nCouncil reform, as not all regions are well represented. \r\nWe wish to reiterate the African position on the Security \r\nCouncil, claiming two seats in the permanent category \r\nand five seats in the non-permanent category. The \r\nfull representation of all regions in the Council will \r\n6 12-52207\r\nA/67/PV.10\r\nensure that we all own the decisions of that important \r\nsecurity organ. We should all be given equal treatment. \r\nNo region or country should impose its influence over \r\nothers. We wish to see finality in that urgent matter, \r\nsince it has dragged on for a very long time now.\r\nThe high-level meeting on sustainable energy for \r\nall, which was held alongside this session, gave Heads \r\nof State and Government a forum to deliberate on issues \r\nthat promote the protection of our environment. That \r\nmeeting provided us with an opportunity to revisit the \r\ncommitments made towards sustainable energy for all. \r\nThe destruction of the environment has had \r\ndevastating effects on many of our countries. The \r\nUnited Nations must expedite the processes towards \r\nprotecting the environment by enforcing the use of \r\nenvironmentally friendly technologies and practices by \r\nMember States. We call upon the developed countries \r\nto honour their commitments made prior to the United \r\nNations Conference on Sustainable Development in Rio \r\nde Janeiro.\r\nFinally, allow me to say that as we meet during \r\nthis session, let us adopt resolutions that will provide \r\nlasting solutions to the challenges faced by humankind \r\nthe world over. We wish the United Nations every \r\nsuccess as it pursues its objective of creating a peaceful \r\nenvironment and coexistence among all the nations of \r\nthe world. Let honesty, peace, stability and tolerance \r\nprevail across the globe.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the Head of \r\nState of the Kingdom of Swaziland for the statement he \r\nhas just made.\r\nHis Majesty King Mswati III, Head of State of \r\nthe Kingdom of Swaziland, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Otto Fernando Pérez Molina, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Guatemala\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Guatemala.\r\nMr. Otto Fernando Pérez Molina, President of \r\nthe Republic of Guatemala, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Otto \r\nFernando Pérez Molina, President of the Republic of \r\nGuatemala, and inviting him to address the General \r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Pérez Molina (spoke in Spanish):  At the \r\noutset, allow me to greet Mr. Vuk Jeremić, President of \r\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. At \r\nthe same time, I would like to express my appreciation \r\nto Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser for his stewardship \r\nduring the previous session.\r\nI have the honour to represent Guatemala for \r\nthe first time before this highest organ of the United \r\nNations. Guatemala, and my Government in particular, \r\nwill always support any initiative that furthers the \r\nnoble objectives and principles of the United Nations, \r\nsummarized in the words “peace”, “development” and \r\n“human rights”.\r\nMy country is committed to the peaceful settlement \r\nof conflicts, which is the central theme of our debate. \r\nIn that spirit, in late 2008 we agreed to sign a special \r\nagreement with our neighbour, Belize, seeking a \r\nresolution of a long-standing territorial dispute through \r\nthe International Court of Justice. Our Congress \r\nunanimously approved the agreement, and on October \r\n6, 2013, simultaneous plebiscites will be held in both \r\ncountries to democratically ratify our commitment to \r\nresorting to the International Court of Justice.\r\nFurthermore, we Guatemalans lived through an \r\narmed conflict that lasted 36 years. I was a soldier who \r\nparticipated in that conflict. And because I know war, I \r\nhighly value dialogue. That is why in 1996 I was one of \r\nthe signatories of the peace accords in my country. That \r\nmotivates me to reaffirm my support for the President’s \r\nwise decision to convene this session to discuss the \r\npeaceful settlement of conflicts.\r\nMy Government has set three overarching objectives \r\nin order to advance firmly and sustainably towards a \r\nGuatemala that fully enjoys the benefits of peace. First, \r\nwe have proposed the Hambre Zero initiative, which \r\nseeks to reduce the chronic malnutrition that affects \r\nover 40 per cent of our children below five years of age. \r\nThat reduction will be sustainable only if we are able to \r\nbetter develop our rural areas in order to permanently \r\nreduce the poverty of families living off the land, \r\nparticularly indigenous families.\r\nSecondly, my Government is promoting a pact \r\nfor security, justice and peace, which seeks to reduce \r\nthe social violence that aff licts our country. In taking \r\noffice, I found a country with high levels of violence; \r\nas a result, reducing those levels has become a priority \r\n12-52207 7\r\nA/67/PV.10\r\nof my Government. We are certain that we can attain \r\nprogress in that area, since the indicators over the past \r\nnine months alone already show a notable decrease of \r\n13 per cent in the number of homicides compared to the \r\nsame period last year. I can therefore state that, without \r\nbeing satisfied with those indices, we are nonetheless \r\nmoving in the right direction in fulfilling our promise \r\nof reducing the levels of violence and increasing \r\nsecurity in Guatemala in an environment of full respect \r\nfor human rights. In this endeavour, we work closely \r\nwith neighbouring countries, and especially with our \r\nCentral American brothers.\r\nThirdly, we are campaigning on the economic \r\nfront through the Fiscal and Competitiveness Pact. \r\nFiscal affairs have been one of the weaknesses of our \r\ninstitutional arrangement, and for this reason, during \r\nthe very first days of my Government we successfully \r\npromoted a fiscal reform, approved by Congress, that \r\nincreased our fiscal receipts by 15 per cent, allowing \r\nus to maintain a stable macroeconomic environment \r\nby reducing the fiscal deficit without having to reduce \r\npublic expenditures. At the same time, fiscal stability \r\nis allowing us to stimulate private investments that \r\ngenerate employment opportunities; that is, dependable \r\njobs, as demanded by our citizens.\r\nUnfortunately, our efforts in relation to the three \r\nchallenges previously mentioned — lowering chronic \r\nmalnutrition among children, reducing violence, and \r\npromoting employment — are nullified in part by the \r\nscourge of drug trafficking. At least 40 per cent of the \r\nhomicides in our country are linked to the illicit drug \r\ntraffic, and my Government is obligated to allocate \r\nscarce fiscal resources to combat transnational gangs \r\nthat operate between the producing countries in the \r\nSouth and the consuming countries in the North. \r\nMoreover, my country has gradually been transformed \r\ninto a producer and a consumer of drugs, thereby \r\ncompounding an already difficult situation.\r\nThe existing framework, born out of the \r\ninternational conventions adopted during the past \r\nfive decades and currently in force, has not achieved \r\nthe desired results. The consumption markets expand \r\ninstead of decreasing; the number of producer countries \r\nand the type of drugs available tend to multiply; and the \r\nroutes chosen for marketing and trafficking are trending \r\ntowards diversification. The drug problem is growing in \r\nsize and complexity. It involves an increasing number \r\nof countries and persons. Clearly, it is a transnational \r\nphenomenon, and it is for that reason that I raise it in \r\nthis universal forum.\r\nIt seems that the basic premise of our war against \r\ndrugs has serious shortcomings since, unfortunately, it \r\nhas not been possible to eradicate drug consumption. I \r\nbelieve that the time has come to accept this fact and to \r\nadapt our fight against the scourge in such a way as to \r\ntake into account the new realities.\r\nOur youth, the group most affected by drug \r\nconsumption, demands more effective responses from \r\nus. Let us realize that the problem is more a public \r\nhealth issue than a matter for criminal justice and \r\ndeal with it accordingly. We must offer treatment, \r\nprevention, social protection, economic opportunities \r\nand development for the communities involved in the \r\ndrug market. Let us not fill our jails with thousands of \r\nyoung people, who would have a different kind of life \r\nif we were to approach the problem in a different way. I \r\ninvite the Member States assembled here to jointly seek \r\navenues that will enable us to offer our young people a \r\nmore promising future, improving their opportunities \r\nfor a better life and at the same time reducing violence \r\nand poverty.\r\nFifty years provides sufficient time for us to \r\nevaluate results, to gauge what we have achieved and to \r\nconclude why we do not have the results we had hoped \r\nfor. In that regard, I also call on Member States to review \r\nthe international regulations that currently govern our \r\nglobal policies regarding drugs. The Single Convention \r\non Narcotic Drugs of 1961, as amended by the 1972 \r\nProtocol, the Convention on Psychotropic Substances \r\nof 1971 and the United Nations Convention against \r\nIllicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic \r\nSubstances of 1988 must be evaluated on the basis of its \r\nresults and brought up to date to allow us to achieve the \r\ndesired outcomes. That is a serious challenge that must \r\nbe addressed in all earnestness so that we can have a \r\nrespectful and frank multilateral dialogue, informed by \r\nclear scientific evidence regarding the best strategies \r\navailable to ensure that our young people are protected \r\nfrom the scourge of drugs.\r\nIn that regard, last April the Heads of State and \r\nGovernment of the Western Hemisphere met for the \r\nSummit of the Americas in Cartagena de Indias. Our \r\nhost, Mr. Santos Calderón, President of Colombia, \r\ninvited us to discuss new avenues to combat drug \r\ntrafficking. The agreement reached was that we should \r\nundertake studies to assess new alternatives, which we \r\n8 12-52207\r\nA/67/PV.10\r\nlaw. In that regard, I indicated that Guatemala would \r\nfulfil its duties on the Security Council responsibly and \r\nin a constructive spirit. I believe that so far we have \r\nkept that promise, and we are pleased that in six days \r\nGuatemala will assume the presidency of the Council \r\nfor the month of October, and we will continue to act \r\nresponsibly.\r\nThirdly, regarding the events of recent weeks, we \r\nreject all acts that defame religions. At the same time, \r\nwe condemn violence in any form, including assaults \r\non diplomatic missions. Such expressions of intolerance \r\noffend us all.\r\nFinally, I would like to recall that, on 21 December, \r\nGuatemala will celebrate the beginning of a new era \r\naccording to the Mayan calendar. That era, 13 Baktun, \r\nmarks the start of a very positive new age that will \r\nenable and invite us to renew physical and spiritual \r\nenergies in an atmosphere of peace, cooperation and \r\ndialogue. All heads of State and Government are invited \r\nto join us in Tikal National Park to share in the dawn of \r\nthis new era. The Mayans of yesterday and today, and \r\nall Guatemalans, await them with open arms.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Republic of Guatemala for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Otto Fernando Pérez Molina, President of \r\nthe Republic of Guatemala, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Andry Nirina Rajoelina, President \r\nof the Transition of the Republic of Madagascar\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Transition of the Republic of Madagascar.\r\nMr. Andry Nirina Rajoelina, President of the \r\nTransition of the Republic of Madagascar, was \r\nescorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Andry Nirina \r\nRajoelina, President of the Transition of the Republic of \r\nMadagascar, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Rajoelina (spoke in French): As \r\nPresident of the Transition of Madagascar, it is a great \r\nhonour for me to participate in the general debate of \r\nthe United Nations for the second time. The theme of \r\nwould discuss next year, in June, at a meeting of the \r\nOrganization of American States in Guatemala. That \r\nis a step in the right direction and one that we believe \r\nshould be emulated at the global level.\r\nIn the same spirit, Guatemala would like to propose \r\nthe establishment of a group of countries that are well \r\ndisposed to reforming global policies on drugs. The \r\ngroup would bring together Governments that are \r\ninterested in promoting in appropriate international \r\nforums an objective and rigorous assessment of \r\nprevailing policies and inconsidering new, creative \r\nand innovative alternatives. We must seek such new \r\navenues responsibly and tenaciously, and I am sure that \r\nwith the cooperation of all producing, consuming and \r\ntransit countries, we will succeed.\r\nAllow me to stress that it is not a matter of \r\nabandoning the fight against the scourge of drugs. \r\nRather, it is a matter of arming ourselves better and \r\nresponding with greater effectiveness and clarity, \r\nbecause our children and grandchildren deserve a more \r\nintegrated and effective response from the international \r\ncommunity.\r\nI would like to conclude my thoughts by reaffirming \r\nthat Guatemala will not renege on any international \r\ncommitments to which it is party. We have no desire \r\nfor unilateral action, which would only sow chaos and \r\nconflict when the response should be a global one. We \r\nwill wait patiently to change our policies in Guatemala \r\nuntil the international community moves forward \r\nand arrives at a new consensus. At the same time, \r\nhowever, I commit my leadership to moving forward \r\non evaluating the global policy on drugs, so as to make \r\nit more effective and based on current international \r\nstandards that reflect the challenges and realities of the \r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nBefore concluding, I would like to briefly raise three \r\npoints that I believe to be important to this meeting of \r\nthe General Assembly. First, as a demonstration of our \r\ncommitment to defending and promoting human rights \r\non all fronts, on 14 January I said that Guatemala would \r\nseek to ratify the Rome Statute of the International \r\nCriminal Court and thus become a party to the Statute. \r\nI am pleased to report that, on 2 April, we deposited our \r\ninstrument of ratification.\r\nSecondly, in that same speech, I indicated that \r\nwe would make it a priority of our foreign policy to \r\ncontribute to the ideals of democracy, justice and peace, \r\nwithin a framework of absolute respect for international \r\n12-52207 9\r\nA/67/PV.10\r\nindividuals and institutions, including the State, to the \r\nadopted and published laws, without distinction as to \r\nsocial or economic status; on the equality of everyone \r\nbefore an independent, impartial justice system; and on \r\nthe harmonization of national laws with international \r\nhuman rights standards. No one should be above the \r\nlaw, and the culture of impunity must be banished.\r\nMr. Benmehidi (Algeria), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair.\r\nNational conflicts today transcend borders and are \r\nbecoming international problems. More than ever, the \r\nrole of diplomacy and international negotiations face \r\ndifficulties. The consequences of disputes play out in a \r\nnumber of ways, including with problems of impunity, \r\ninstability in the Arab and Muslim world, the case of \r\nSomali piracy, illegal immigrations, persons displaced \r\nby war, problems regarding the Rom issue, religious \r\nconfrontations, management of land and sea borders, \r\nand food insecurity. It is undeniable that much remains \r\nto be done to save human lives, because still civilian \r\npopulations remain the primary victims of conflicts \r\nand disputes throughout the world.\r\nThe world is in upheaval, and many countries are in \r\na situation of transition. Their peoples demand change \r\nand hope for sustainable development. Those countries \r\nneed to be supported and encouraged, not sanctioned. \r\nIn that context, allow me to highlight the case of my \r\nown country, Madagascar. \r\nMadagascar is a country emerging from crisis, \r\nthanks to the involvement of the bodies of the Southern \r\nAfrican Development Community and the support of \r\nthe African Union, the Indian Ocean Commission and \r\nthe International Organization of la Francophonie. A \r\nroad map was signed and adopted by the Malagasy \r\npolitical parties in September 2011. Thus, several \r\nsignificant steps have been taken. The Malagasy parties \r\nhave honoured their commitments. All the transitional \r\ninstitutions have been set up, including a national unity \r\nGovernment and the transitional Parliament. The road \r\nmap, which we can call a political agreement, has \r\nallowed us to launch the electoral process.\r\nMadagascar needs to take its destiny into its own \r\nhands, to write its own history, and to end the cycle of \r\npolitical instability through the holding of credible and \r\ntransparent elections, guaranteed by the establishment \r\nof the Independent National Electoral Commission \r\nof the Transition. Above all, recently, in concert with \r\nUnited Nations experts, the electoral timetable for \r\nthe sixty-seventh session is akin to a call for unity, \r\nfor shared contemplation and for generally revisiting \r\nexistential questions and human values in the face of \r\nsituations around the world where peace is extremely \r\nprecarious.\r\nThe last few years have indeed been marked by \r\ndifferences of opinion, political disputes and conflicts \r\nof interest. The world today faces new challenges to \r\nstability and the maintenance of peace. Various efforts \r\nand initiatives have been undertaken to deal with \r\nconflicts that are not homogeneous and disputes that \r\ndo not always play out along the same lines. People’s \r\ninterests differ and their approaches are not all equal.\r\nToday the list of the forms that global conflicts \r\ntake leads us to an obvious reality: geostrategic \r\nvariations conform to no one rule, and they are in \r\nperpetual f lux. The wise words of Secretary-General \r\nBan Ki-moon in his statement at the opening of the \r\nsixteenth Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement seem \r\nparticularly revealing in that context. Did he not stress \r\nthat among the challenges that must be met, there are \r\nall too many political disputes between member States \r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement itself? Did he not urge \r\nthe protagonists in the Syrian crisis to immediately \r\ninstitute a ceasefire and a halt to the violence? And yet \r\nwe can only deplore the fact that his call produced no \r\nresult. Scores of innocent people are still dying every \r\nday, and over recent months they now number in the \r\nthousands. We firmly condemn this loss of human life. \r\nThe Earth continues to run with the blood of innocents, \r\nspilled violently not only in Syria but in other parts of \r\nthe world as well.\r\nGiven this state of affairs, despite the complexity \r\nof the challenges those conflicts present, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has not stood idle. We can only commend his \r\ndetermination to strive tirelessly to seek a negotiated \r\nsettlement. States and other bodies must join forces \r\nto maintain peace, stability and security in the world. \r\nWe cannot be passive witnesses to current or future \r\ndisasters. The Republic of Madagascar sets particular \r\nstore by the relevance and importance of the principles \r\nset forth in the United Nations Charter, as a source \r\nof inspiration as well as a pillar of support for the \r\ninterdependence of nations and peoples. That being the \r\ncase, human rights, the law of States, the rule of law \r\nand the other international regulatory tools place before \r\nleaders their responsibilities.\r\nThe League of Nations defined the rule of law as a \r\nprinciple of governance based on the submission of all \r\n10 12-52207\r\nA/67/PV.10\r\nMadagascar was officially announced, including the \r\nholding of presidential elections scheduled for 8 May \r\n2013. Thus I launch a solemn appeal to all international \r\npartners, all Member States and friends of Madagascar \r\nto support us and encourage us in that approach, which \r\nis the only and most democratic path forward. \r\nProfoundly committed to the values of solidarity, \r\ntolerance and peace, Madagascar is now searching for \r\nswift development and a better future. During the three \r\nand a half years of transition and despite all attempts \r\nat destabilization, we have worked tirelessly every day \r\nto honour our commitments and ensure the protection \r\nof our countrymen, all the while addressing social \r\nproblems. In spite of challenging times, and despite the \r\nsuspension of international aid and subsidies, which \r\nonce accounted for 60 per cent of the State budget, we \r\nhave been able to keep the administration functioning \r\nnormally and have honoured all our commitments and \r\ndebts.\r\nMadagascar is indeed one of the least developed \r\ncountries. Nevertheless, it is one of the least indebted \r\ncountries in the world since its debt amounts to only \r\n5 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), compared \r\nto other countries whose debt rate can reach up to \r\n238 per cent of GDP. Therefore, it is possible to develop \r\nour country and create our wealth through our own \r\nresources. That is the challenge that we are meeting.\r\nNow it is high time to embark on in-depth reform \r\nto create an effective system that meets the highest \r\nexpectations of our respective populations — not \r\nforgetting, obviously, the need to double or even triple \r\nour commitments to fighting poverty and promoting \r\nsustainable development. Here today, I launch an appeal \r\nfor international solidarity to channel the transition \r\ntowards the building of a more promising future — but \r\nwithout stif ling us.\r\nThe Malagasy people need their full and entire \r\nindependence, but above all they must be able to \r\nhold transparent and therefore democratic elections. \r\nI know that everyone here is sincerely willing to lend \r\nus support. So allow me to give the Assembly the \r\nsolution. The best way to help us is to trust us, honour \r\nthe commitments made and let us shoulder our own \r\nresponsibilities. In the name of universal values and \r\nprinciples, anyone meeting the conditions of eligibility \r\ndictated by law is fully entitled to exercise that liberty. \r\nThat is a fundamental principle, and all States must \r\nrespect it. The Malagasy people alone — not other \r\ncountries or external pressure — have the sovereign \r\nright to decide who should guide their destiny. The \r\nMalagasy people alone will choose the man or woman \r\nwho will lead Madagascar.\r\nIf confidence is shown in the Malagasy people, they \r\nwill be grateful. The concepts of non-interference and \r\nrespect for the sovereignty of each country establish \r\nmutual trust, which is a basic rule for all international \r\nnegotiations. They are among the peaceful means \r\nneeded to build lasting peace. Efforts must be made \r\nto put an end to the inequalities in how countries in \r\npolitical crisis are treated. The realities on the ground \r\nand popular aspirations must be acknowledged in order \r\nto avoid making the wrong decision. \r\nDespite our disagreements and our differences on \r\nhow to achieve a peaceful settlement of our conflicts, \r\nwe the States Members of the United Nations are \r\nunanimous in our firm desire for peace. The United \r\nNations system cannot just be the police of the world; \r\nit also needs to be a source of hope and of values. Our \r\nsocieties need to exist and find their way through \r\ntheir own values, because it is social and economic \r\nills, injustice, the lack of protection for vulnerable \r\npopulations and intolerance for minorities that often \r\ncause States to collapse. \r\nAs far as its modest means allow, the Republic of \r\nMadagascar is determined to contribute to achieving \r\nour shared goals. The peace accord is fragile and needs \r\nto develop. To quote Martin Luther King, Jr., “All \r\nprogress is precarious, and the solution of one problem \r\nbrings us face to face with another problem”. It is our \r\nduty and responsibility to provide a better future for the \r\ngenerations to come. Global stability requires tolerance, \r\nassistance, the creation and equitable sharing of wealth, \r\nand poverty reduction through sustainable development \r\nand reconciliation. The principles of adjustment or \r\nsettlement of international disputes by peaceful means \r\nrequires a return to our values, gender balance and \r\nequality, and, above all, democratic alternation. God \r\nbless our nation!\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Transition \r\nof the Republic of Madagascar for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Andry Nirina Rajoelina, President of the \r\nTransition of the Republic of Madagascar, was \r\nescorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\n12-52207 11\r\nA/67/PV.10\r\nUnited Nations, the peace in my country was shaken. \r\nThe armed conflict in the Transnistrian region of the \r\nRepublic of Moldova lasted for five months and caused \r\nthe loss of many lives. It was a tragic period that, while \r\nnow past, continues to pose a serious challenge in \r\nthe present. Since the end of the hostilities, Moldova \r\nhas firmly embarked on the road towards a peaceful \r\nsettlement of that conflict. Twenty years of negotiations \r\nhave strengthened our belief that that is the only viable \r\npath to follow in order to reach a political settlement. \r\nIt is obvious that the perpetuation of the conflict \r\ndoes not offer any real benefit to the majority of the \r\npeople on either bank of the Nistru river. It undermines \r\nour national security and territorial integrity, hampers \r\neconomic development and divides our society. \r\nMoreover, the conflict keeps the population of the \r\nTransnistrian region in isolation, incites human rights \r\nviolations and generates economic stagnation on \r\nthe left bank of the Nistru. The current political and \r\neconomic trends show that preserving the status quo is \r\nnot a viable scenario anymore. All of our international \r\npartners share the view that there is no alternative to \r\na reunified Moldova. Our message in that regard is \r\nfirm – 20 years are enough to overcome the mistrust of \r\nthe past and it is time to start building a shared future.\r\nThe key elements in the approach of the Moldovan \r\nauthorities to resolving the conflict are also clear. \r\nOur ultimate goal is to reintegrate the Republic of \r\nMoldova within its internationally recognized borders \r\nas a functional State with a clear European perspective. \r\nThe Transnistrian region should be granted a special \r\nstatus within Moldova, which will provide the region \r\nwith a comfortable level of self-governance. Defining \r\nthe special status is the core task of the political \r\nnegotiations in the “5+2” format. That negotiation \r\nprocess should lead to a reasonable compromise based \r\non the principles of the sovereignty and territorial \r\nintegrity of the Republic of Moldova.\r\nIn parallel, we will continue to implement \r\nconfidence-building measures aimed at bringing \r\ncommunities from both banks of the Nistru River \r\ncloser to each other. By promoting business links, \r\nensuring freedom of movement, protecting human \r\nrights, improving security and combating criminality, \r\nwe will prepare a better ground for a political solution. \r\nTransformation of the existing military peacekeeping \r\nmechanism into an international civilian mission aimed \r\nat building confidence rather than separating the sides \r\nhas also become an imperative.\r\nAddress by Mr. Nicolae Timofti, President of the \r\nRepublic of Moldova\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nMoldova.\r\nMr. Nicolae Timofti, President of the Republic of \r\nMoldova, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Nicolae Timofti, President \r\nof the Republic of Moldova, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPresident Timofti (spoke in Moldovan; English \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): At the \r\noutset, I would like to congratulate Mr. Vuk Jeremić \r\non his election as President of the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-seventh session and to wish him every success \r\nin that highly honourable and important role. I am \r\nconvinced that his rich experience will contribute to the \r\nachievement of significant results in our work together. \r\nI convey my appreciation as well to his predecessor, \r\nMr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, for the exemplary \r\nmanner in which he led the sixty-sixth session. I also \r\nwish to pay tribute to Secretary-General Ban Ki-\r\nmoon for his ongoing efforts to revitalize the global \r\nrole of the United Nations and to bring reforms to the \r\nOrganization. \r\nIt is a great honour for me to speak from this \r\nrostrum for the first time on behalf of the people of \r\nthe Republic of Moldova. Twenty-one years ago, my \r\ncountry broke away from the Soviet empire, and today \r\nit is undergoing a process of democratic transformation, \r\nwith membership in the European Union as its ultimate \r\ngoal. After a period of several years marked by political \r\nturmoil, my country now enjoys political stability, \r\nwhich allows it to develop and modernize. We have \r\nfirmly defined European integration as our objective \r\nand have revived the economic and social reforms. Our \r\npriorities are the establishment of the rule of law and \r\ncomprehensive judicial reform, with an emphasis on \r\nfighting corruption, modernization of the economy and \r\nreintegration of the country. \r\nThe support and assistance provided by our \r\nEuropean partners from Brussels and United Nations \r\nMember States are extremely important for us and \r\nassure us that we are on the right path. Two decades \r\nago, on the very day the Republic of Moldova joined the \r\n12 12-52207\r\nA/67/PV.10\r\nand management of conflicts, including protracted \r\nones. From that point of view, during this session we \r\nwill strongly support the consideration by the General \r\nAssembly of the issue of cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and regional organizations, particularly \r\nthe Organization for Security and Cooperation in \r\nEurope, the Council of Europe, the Black Sea Economic \r\nCooperation Organization and other organizations.\r\nIn the same context, considering the distinct \r\nobjective devoted to democracy and economic \r\ndevelopment, the increased potential and role in economic \r\ndevelopment and regional integration, as well as the \r\nstrong determination of the countries of the Georgia, \r\nUkraine, Azerbaijan, Moldova (GUAM) Organization \r\nfor Democracy and Economic Development to actively \r\ncontribute to international security, stability and peace, \r\nthe delegations of its member States have decided to \r\nadvance for consideration of the General Assembly \r\nduring its current session a draft resolution on \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and GUAM.\r\nAt this stage, the process of development and \r\nintegration of our States is still burdened by some \r\noutstanding problems, including unresolved conflicts \r\nin the territories of the Republic of Azerbaijan, \r\nGeorgia and the Republic of Moldova. We reaffirm our \r\nunswerving commitment to finding peaceful solutions \r\nto those conflicts on the basis of respect for the \r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of our countries.\r\nPromoting the rule of law at the national and \r\ninternational levels is at the heart of the United Nations \r\nmission and is fundamental to achieving durable peace, \r\nsupporting openness in Government, the effective \r\nprotection of human rights and sustained economic \r\ngrowth and development. We emphasize the importance \r\nof the High-level Meeting of the General Assembly on \r\nthe Rule of Law at the National and International Levels \r\n(A/67/PV.3), held on 24 September, and will continue \r\nto support efforts in that direction during the sixty-\r\nseventh session. In our view, strengthening the rule of \r\nlaw will help to maintain peace, promote development \r\nand enhance cooperation, and is therefore conducive to \r\nthe achievement of the goal of building a harmonious \r\nworld.\r\nThe non-proliferation of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction, disarmament and the efficient control of \r\narmaments remain  vital topics on the international \r\ncooperation agenda, which need the common \r\nunderstanding, political will and engaged efforts of all \r\nStates and international organizations. The Republic of \r\nOur international partners provide an essential \r\ncontribution to bringing that conflict to an end. Growing \r\nassistance from the European Union is an encouraging \r\nexample in that regard. The negotiation process now \r\nneeds a strong stimulus, and we believe that our \r\ninternational partners can demonstrate the necessary \r\npolitical will to that end. We call on the 5+2 format \r\nnegotiators, namely, the Organization for Security \r\nand Cooperation in Europe, the Russian Federation, \r\nUkraine, the European Union and the United States of \r\nAmerica, to pool their efforts and work together towards \r\nthe final resolution of the Transnistrian conflict and \r\nreintegration of the Republic of Moldova.\r\nIt is also important to reiterate that Russian forces \r\nare still present on the territory of the Republic of \r\nMoldova, without the consent of the host country and in \r\nbreach of the Moldovan Constitution and international \r\ncommitments, and they should be finally withdrawn.\r\nThe universal character of the United Nations and \r\nits unique role in managing international relations \r\nare widely recognized. There is no alternative to \r\nthis Organization. Yet, globalization and the global \r\nfinancial crisis have demonstrated the need to reform \r\nthe Organization in order to ensure the progressive \r\nand sustainable strengthening of the United Nations. I \r\nam referring in particular to Security Council reform, \r\nto which a compromise solution should be found. We \r\nbelieve that any proposal for its reform should take into \r\naccount the legitimate aspirations of all regional groups, \r\nincluding granting an additional non-permanent seat to \r\nthe Eastern European States.\r\nIn its capacity as a member of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, the Committee on Conferences, the Policy and \r\nProgramme Coordination Committee, the Committee \r\non Information, the Commission for Population and \r\nDevelopment and other United Nations elective bodies, \r\nthe Republic of Moldova will continue to support \r\nefforts towards the comprehensive reform of the \r\nUnited Nations system and its main bodies and organs, \r\nincluding the revitalization of the General Assembly \r\nand the reform of the Security Council aimed at \r\nenhancing the efficiency, transparency, accountability \r\nand representativeness of the system.\r\nThe relationship between the United Nations and \r\nregional organizations is of paramount importance for \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security. In \r\nmany instances, all those organizations have unique \r\nand complementary capacities that, when properly \r\ncoordinated, can contribute decisively to the prevention \r\n12-52207 13\r\nA/67/PV.10\r\nFinally, I would like to reiterate that the Republic \r\nof Moldova is a strong supporter of the United Nations \r\nrole in global governance and the management of \r\ninternational crises. We believe in the potential and \r\ncapacities of the United Nations to find adequate \r\nresponses and take concrete actions aimed at resolving \r\nthe ever-increasing global challenges. The Republic of \r\nMoldova is definitely contributing to that activity.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Moldova for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Nicolae Timofti, President of the Republic of \r\nMoldova, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Toomas Hendrik Ilves, President of \r\nthe Republic of Estonia\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nEstonia.\r\nMr. Toomas Hendrik Ilves, President of the \r\nRepublic of Estonia, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Toomas Hendrik Ilves, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Estonia, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Ilves: It is an honour once again \r\nto address the United Nations. This year I would \r\nlike to focus on responsibility. The recent years of \r\neconomic and financial turbulence have demonstrated \r\na strong correlation between economic prudence and \r\nresponsibility in fiscal matters. We have realized, I \r\nhope, that sustainability is not a term we apply only \r\nto development, but concerns all of us. Responsibility \r\nand sustainability apply to the three broad topics I shall \r\naddress today: human rights, good governance and \r\ndevelopment. But before doing so, I would like to speak \r\nabout diplomacy. \r\nThe purpose of diplomacy is to prevent war. \r\nWhen diplomats are attacked we are all less secure. \r\nWe know what we are talking about — we too have \r\nhad our diplomats attacked, mercifully without the \r\nhorrific consequences that occured in Benghazi. \r\nTherefore, the recent assaults in many parts of the \r\nworld on diplomats, embassies and consular premises \r\nMoldova fully supports the international community \r\nin exerting continuous control of and applying the \r\nnecessary preventive measures against unlawful \r\nattempts to develop weapons of mass destruction and \r\ntheir means of delivery, which pose a real threat to \r\ninternational security and are often used to challenge \r\nthe existing world order.\r\nThe Republic of Moldova established significant \r\nobjectives and is undertaking tangible steps in \r\naccomplishing its priorities in the field of arms control. \r\nIn cooperation with our partners, the Government of \r\nthe Republic of Moldova is in the process of adjusting \r\nto the best international standards, adopting dual-use \r\ngoods export control legislation, improving small arms \r\nand light weapons management for civilians and the \r\nmilitary, ensuring proper border management, and \r\nactively cooperating at the regional and international \r\nlevels.\r\nMilitary conflicts in different regions of the planet \r\nand the global economic crises have brought human \r\nrights issues once again to our attention. The principles \r\nof international law and human rights standards can \r\nbe promoted only by joint efforts and decisions. Acts \r\nof aggression, including attacks against the personnel \r\nand integrity of diplomatic facilities, represent a \r\nviolation of international norms and deserve our firm \r\ncondemnation. The relevant bodies of the United \r\nNations, including the Human Rights Council, have \r\nsufficient instruments to take action on behalf of States \r\nin order to prevent human rights violations, conduct \r\ncountry evaluations and provide tailored solutions.\r\nAs a member of the Human Rights Council for the \r\nterm of 2010 to 2013 and, as Vice-Chair of the Third \r\nCommittee at its previous session, the Republic of \r\nMoldova continuously pledges to keep an open mind \r\nin furthering the cause of promoting and protecting \r\nhuman rights worldwide.\r\nThe world economic crisis is an incentive \r\nfor putting into practice the idea of  sustainable \r\ndevelopment, which could simultaneously provide \r\nsolutions for maintaining the pace of economic growth \r\nand prevent climate change. We support the renewal \r\nof the global commitment made at the United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development, held in Rio de \r\nJaneiro, Brazil, and the agreement on establishing the \r\nsustainable development goals (see resolution 66/288, \r\nannex). We believe that promoting a green economy \r\nmodel will help enterprises to reconfigure in order to \r\nstreamline natural, human and economic investments.\r\n14 12-52207\r\nA/67/PV.10\r\nresponsibility to protect is not debated. The difficulty, \r\nhowever, lies with its application: when Governments \r\ndo not live up to their responsibility, the international \r\ncommunity must react and act.\r\nThe international criminal justice system, \r\nespecially the International Criminal Court, plays a \r\ncrucial role in providing timely and decisive responses \r\nto such crimes. Investigations by the Court may deter \r\nfurther atrocities, prevent their escalation or accelerate \r\ntheir end. It is therefore essential to cooperate with the \r\nCourt and apprehend those it has indicted.\r\nAs a result of the evolving nature of military \r\nconflicts, civilian casualties tragically are on the \r\nrise. Among civilians, women and children are the \r\nmost vulnerable. When we take that into account, \r\nSecurity Council resolution 1325 (2000), on women, \r\npeace and security, takes on a whole new immediacy. \r\nFurthermore, conflict-related sexual violence requires \r\nmore attention. Such violence can easily lead to further \r\nwar crimes and crimes against humanity. Moreover, \r\nin advancing the rights of the child, the International \r\nCriminal Court’s recent decision to convict Thomas \r\nLubanga Dyilo was a significant achievement and will, \r\nwe hope, have a strong deterrent effect in the future to \r\nprevent crimes against children.\r\nThe Crimean War, in the 1850s, brought the world \r\nthe first extensive photographic reports of conflicts. \r\nToday, new media make it even more difficult to hide \r\nwar crimes both on and off the battlefield. Modern \r\ntechnology brings home the reality and horror of war. \r\nWe must therefore recognize the important role of \r\ntechnology in advancing human rights.\r\nFreedom of expression is a human right, whether in \r\nthe city square, the press or in cyberspace. For the third \r\nyear in a row, Freedom House has ranked Estonia first \r\nin the world in Internet freedom. We have joined the \r\ncoalition Freedom Online, a group of States working \r\nclosely together to advance human rights online. In \r\naddition, Estonia looks forward to discussing  actively \r\nmatters relating to Internet freedom in the Human \r\nRights Council, which adopted a resolution on that \r\ntopic this year (resolution 20/8). The resolution was a \r\ngenuine milestone affirming that fundamental rights \r\nin the virtual world must be protected with the same \r\ncommitment as in the real world.\r\nInternationally, there are worrisome developments \r\nrelated to Internet governance. Too many countries \r\nspeak about the dangers of a free Internet from a \r\nare deplorable. Regardless of their motivations, such \r\nacts are unjustifiable and must be universally and \r\nunequivocably condemned. All countries must fulfil \r\ntheir international legal obligation to protect diplomatic \r\nand consular properties and personnel.\r\nAs recent events have demonstrated, when it \r\ncomes to human rights it is not enough merely to keep \r\nyour own house in order. As a conscientious member \r\nof the international community, Estonia feels the \r\nresponsibility to do more globally. That includes paying \r\nattention to human rights violations in places torn by \r\nconflict, as well as doing more to stop and prevent the \r\nviolation of the rights of women and the child. It also \r\nmeans making the most of new technologies in the \r\nservice of fundamental rights and freedoms. The need \r\nto take responsibility and do more is also why Estonia \r\nlooks forward to becoming a member of the Human \r\nRights Council and to working proactively towards the \r\nfulfilment of its mandate.\r\nPermit me to touch upon the developments in \r\nSyria. We have witnessed the complete breakdown of \r\nany semblance of the rule of law. We continue to see \r\nextensive human rights and international humanitarian \r\nlaw abuses. It appears that both sides have committed \r\nserious international crimes. Yet we still see no solution. \r\nWe cannot look on and wait for the violence to spread \r\neven more widely. The Security Council — especially \r\nits permanent members — must overcome their \r\ndifferences and find a solution to the bloodshed. The \r\nleast that all parties must do is to allow for humanitarian \r\naid to be safely delivered and to guarantee the security \r\nof humanitarian workers. Without an end to the armed \r\nconflict, without peace, there can be no political \r\nprocess.\r\nBut it is not only Syria that needs our attention. \r\nWe should not avoid the problem of protracted conflicts \r\nthat have already waited for years to be solved. We \r\nshall speak with one voice against continuing violations \r\nof the territorial integrity of sovereign States and for \r\nthe secure return of all forcefully displaced persons. \r\nMoreover, more attention to conflict prevention would \r\nhelp to avoid such violations in the future.\r\nA stronger commitment to conflict prevention and \r\nto the enhancement of the rule of law can help to avoid \r\nviolent conflicts and the most heinous international \r\ncrimes. Under the principle of the responsibility to \r\nprotect, States committed in 2005 to protect their \r\npeople from ethnic cleansing, genocide, war crimes \r\nand crimes against humanity. Today the content of the \r\n12-52207 15\r\nA/67/PV.10\r\nincreasingly necessary to distinguish noise from signal, \r\nto distinguish genuine data from spin.\r\nI have spoken thus far about what Governments \r\ncan and must do. In our increasingly interconnected, \r\nwired and wireless world, civil society and the private \r\nsector play an ever-greater role. Governments benefit \r\nfrom involving non-governmental organizations, \r\nentrepreneurs and private individuals in governance. \r\nEstonia and many other countries increasingly and \r\nsuccessfully do so. The challenge, however, is for the \r\nUnited Nations system — a multilateral organization \r\nbased on modern, post-Westphalian States — to embrace \r\nthose other actors and to involve them in finding \r\nsolutions and decision-making.\r\nAllow me to continue by sharing some thoughts \r\nrelated to development and responsibility. \r\nSustainable development is not a clichéd utopia; \r\nnor is it something forced on us from above. True \r\ndevelopment can be nothing other than sustainable. Yet \r\nwe have seen unsustainability masked as development, \r\ndespite the contradiction in terms.\r\nConsider the global financial crisis. Burdening our \r\nchildren and grandchildren with mountains of debt is \r\nimmoral, as is living at the expense of others. Growth \r\nwithout responsibility is illusory. We have learned that \r\nthe hard way. Let us not make the same mistake again.\r\nWe are another year closer to the deadline we set \r\nourselves for achieving the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs). Were they too ambitious? I do not think \r\nso. Aiming high is the least we can do. There is no point \r\nin setting targets that we can be confident of achieving \r\neffortlessly. Yet we must resist the temptation to sell \r\neverything as a success if that is not the case. Failure to \r\nachieve all the MDGs is no excuse not to set new targets. \r\nThe world needs sustainable development goals. We are \r\nstill in a preliminary phase of the discussion. Let us aim \r\nhigh and do our best.\r\nDespite the world’s best efforts, millions \r\nremain in poverty. The information technology (IT) \r\ntransformation will create massive opportunities all \r\nover the world. We must, however, avoid a digital \r\ndivide that would stymie this historic chance to \r\naccelerate development in all parts of the world. I was a \r\nmember of Kofi Annan’s high-level panel of experts on \r\ninformation and communication technology — already \r\na decade ago — and I continue to be concerned about \r\nthe gap between the digital haves and have-nots, \r\nespecially because, by investing in IT, countries such as \r\nsecurity perspective. The truth is, as we know well, \r\nthat cybersecurity is needed to prevent oppressive \r\nGovernments and criminals from wreaking havoc. It is \r\nnot to prevent peaceful individuals from speaking their \r\nminds or gathering information and exchanging ideas.\r\nDespite having experienced extensive cyber attacks \r\nduring the so-called Web War One, five years ago, Estonia \r\ndoes not support more rigid regulation and censorship \r\nin cyberspace. Estonia is committed to an open, secure \r\nand reliable Internet. It is therefore imperative to ensure \r\nthat the International Telecommunication Union’s new \r\nregulation does not lead to the restriction of Internet \r\nfreedom and unnecessary limits to the free f low of ideas \r\nand information. In fighting cybercrimes, the Budapest \r\nConvention on Cybercrime provides the appropriate \r\nand primary legal framework at the global level.\r\nGlobally, there is a deficit of good and responsible \r\ngovernance. Its lack is the root cause of countless \r\nother ills. But again, some progress has been made. \r\nI was proud to represent Estonia when I signed on \r\nto the Open Government Partnership, along with \r\nrepresentatives of 42 other countries. That multilateral \r\ninitiative aims to take concrete steps to institute a new \r\nmodel of governance to maximize the potential of new \r\ntechnologies and, most important, to tackle corruption.\r\nThe information revolution we experience these \r\ndays has assisted Estonia to successfully and rapidly \r\ntransform itself into a rule-of-law-based democratic \r\nsociety. Estonia was the first country where people \r\ncould cast their vote online in parliamentary and \r\nmunicipal elections. Just a few months ago we \r\nconducted our census for the first time to a large extent \r\nonline. This year more than 90 per cent of taxpayers in \r\nEstonia filed annual income tax returns via the Internet. \r\nE-government, e-school, e-medical prescriptions \r\nand e-parking are examples of Estonian innovation \r\nin the field of citizen-friendly public services. They \r\nincrease transparency and help to prevent and cut \r\ndown corruption. They reduce costs. Most importantly, \r\nhowever, they have increased the possibility to exercise \r\nfundamental rights and freedoms and improve inclusive \r\nand responsible governance. Therefore, Estonia wishes \r\nto share its e-governance skills and to continue to \r\nfacilitate exchanges with partners worldwide.\r\nMy comments on the need to do more apply to the \r\nUnited Nations too. Without reform, its global mission \r\nwill be unsustainable. We need change, ranging from \r\nreforming the United Nations in the broadest sense to \r\ncutting the waste of paper. In an information age it is \r\n16 12-52207\r\nA/67/PV.10\r\nmine have leapt into modernity and transparency. New \r\ninformation and communications technologies have the \r\npotential to trigger the next industrial revolution, but \r\ngovernments cannot achieve it alone.\r\nEntrepreneurs expanding the range of global \r\nknowledge networks are key partners in fighting \r\npoverty and creating a more transparent economy. \r\nThey can also make an outsized difference in their \r\ncommunities and the world. However, Governments \r\nmust provide a secure and fruitful environment for \r\nthose sorts of ideas to emerge and prosper. Twenty-\r\none years after restoring our independence, Estonia is \r\nan example where a combination of responsible free \r\nenterprise, e-governance, international partnerships \r\nand eco-friendly policies can put a country in the fast \r\nlane of development.\r\nExperience shows that if we fail to act responsibly, \r\nwe will, in the end, be forced to do so. Let us begin by \r\nacting responsibly.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Estonia for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Toomas Hendrik Ilves, President of the \r\nRepublic of Estonia, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mrs. Joyce Hilda Mtila Banda, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Malawi\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nMalawi.\r\nMrs. Joyce Hilda Mtila Banda, President of the \r\nRepublic of Malawi, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations Her Excellency Mrs. Joyce Hilda Mtila Banda, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Malawi, and to invite her \r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Banda: Allow me to congratulate \r\nthe President on his well-deserved election to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh \r\nsession. My delegation and I would like to assure him \r\nof Malawi’s full support during his tenure of office.\r\nIt is an honour to address the Assembly today for the \r\nfirst time in my capacity as President of the Republic of \r\nMalawi. As the Assembly may be aware, I took office \r\nin April of this year after the death of my predecessor, \r\nHis Excellency Professor Bingu Wa Mutharika. On \r\nbehalf of all Malawians, I express our appreciation for \r\nthe support that the world gave us during that difficult \r\ntime in our country. I would like to also acknowledge \r\nin particular the support I received from leaders from \r\nthe Southern African Development Community and the \r\nentire African continent when I assumed the presidency. \r\nThe support that I received is a mark that Africa has \r\nindeed embraced women’s leadership.\r\nJoining the world’s leaders here and becoming only \r\nthe second female Head of State in Africa’s history, \r\nafter Her Excellency President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf of \r\nLiberia, is a moment of pride for me. However, mine \r\nis not the story of the success of an individual, but of \r\na people. A peaceful and constitutional transition of \r\npower was not inevitable when my presidency began. \r\nIt is the courage and determination of the people of \r\nMalawi that made it possible. The people of Malawi \r\nhave made a decisive choice. They have chosen \r\ndemocracy, they have chosen peace and they have \r\nchosen to work together to realize their destiny. It is my \r\npeople’s courage and determination that has taken me \r\nto the presidency, and which we will now apply to our \r\nnational development. \r\nThe theme of the general debate this year is “Bringing \r\nabout adjustment or settlement of international disputes \r\nor situations by peaceful means”. It allows us to reflect \r\non some of the conflict situations around the world, \r\nincluding in Africa. Those conflicts have a devastating \r\neffect on the lives of millions, especially women and \r\nchildren. The impact of conflict goes beyond the people \r\ndirectly involved, affecting the region and the world. \r\nLet me agree with Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \r\nwhen he said in his reappointment speech that one of \r\nthe greatest opportunities we have for a better world \r\nwithout conflict is through sustainable development. \r\nThe biggest threats to security and peace are poverty, \r\nlack of opportunity and lack of hope. It is unacceptable \r\nto me as the President of Malawi, as it should be to the \r\nglobal community, that we have children continuing to \r\nsuffer from malnutrition, or that they yearn to learn but \r\nhave to sit under trees rather than in proper classrooms. \r\nIt is unacceptable that a mother should die while giving \r\nbirth because the nearest health centre is far away, or \r\nthat thousands die of diseases that we have answers \r\nfor. It is unacceptable that the youth who represent the \r\nfuture of our world have few opportunities to realize \r\n12-52207 17\r\nA/67/PV.10\r\ntheir potential, or that they are not guaranteed a society \r\nwhere they can speak their mind. It is unacceptable that \r\nfarmers and other workers continue to toil to make the \r\nbest of what they have, but do not enjoy the fruits of \r\ntheir labour due to lack of modernization, a supportive \r\npolicy environment and access to markets; and that \r\nthey are buried under global tariffs and taxes. It is when \r\nthose frustrations are in place that conflict takes root.\r\nFor decades, I have fought these issues in Malawi \r\nas a social justice and human rights activist and \r\nthrough my work at the gra-ssroots. I have experienced \r\nthe struggles of the poor and the suffering of Malawian \r\nwomen. I have championed the advancement of the \r\noppressed and marginalized, fought for the rights of \r\nwomen and children, campaigned for the betterment of \r\nthe rural and urban poor. I can attest to the fact that \r\nthe experience of a poor and disadvantaged Malawian \r\nis intimately intertwined with that of Africans, and \r\nindeed with that of the people of the least developed \r\ncountries.\r\nNow, as the President of the Republic of Malawi, \r\nI have a vision. My vision is to eradicate poverty \r\nthrough economic growth and wealth creation. Malawi \r\naims to create wealth by transforming the structure of \r\nthe economy, promoting the private sector in order to \r\nachieve economic growth, accelerating job creation \r\nand protecting the vulnerable and the excluded within a \r\ndecentralized and democratic environment.\r\nSpecifically, my vision is to transform Malawi \r\ninto one of the fastest-growing African economies in \r\nthe next decade. For me, growth is not merely related \r\nto gross domestic product. Growth is about wealth and \r\nprosperity for all, opportunity for all, happiness for all, \r\npolitical and economic freedom for all. Growth is also \r\nabout growing the number of children in school and \r\nyoung people in jobs. Growth is about increasing the \r\nnumber of mothers who give safe birth in a hospital and \r\nof growing the number of families who have plenty of \r\nfood.\r\nAs the Assembly may be aware, for the past \r\nthree years Malawi has faced severe economic and \r\nsocial challenges brought on by poor political and \r\neconomic governance, which could have impacted our \r\nability to accelerate the attainment of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). Therefore, upon assuming \r\noffice I immediately put in place an economic recovery \r\nprogramme to restore macroeconomic stability in the \r\ncountry so that we can not only address our immediate \r\nmacroeconomic issues, but also secure Malawi’s ability \r\nto meet the MDG targets. \r\nI would like to share that we are certain that we will \r\nbe able to achieve five of the eight MDGs by 2015. And \r\nwe will continue to strive to achieve our goals of the \r\nthree remaining MDGs: universal primary education, \r\npromoting gender equality and empowering women, \r\nand improving maternal health. Coincidentally, these \r\nthree MDGs are related to issues that I have worked on \r\nthroughout my life, and I will personally ensure that \r\nMalawi redoubles its efforts to make improvements in \r\nthose areas. \r\nMy Government realizes that the potential of \r\nMalawi — the potential of our land, our resources \r\nand, most importantly, our people — is great. But \r\nthat opportunity will be seized only through our own \r\nefforts. That is why my vision is not just hopeful words. \r\nOur willingness to take tough decisions does not end \r\nhere. Our plans need to be translated into action. To that \r\nend, within my first 100 days in office, Malawi held an \r\ninclusive national dialogue on the economy to narrow \r\ndown five priority sectors within our medium-term \r\nnational development framework, the Malawi Growth \r\nand Development Strategy II. The five priorities are \r\nenergy, tourism, agriculture, mining and infrastructure \r\ndevelopment.\r\nCentral to those priorities is our emphasis on \r\ndelivery through partnership with the private sector. \r\nWe will facilitate that by making changes aimed \r\nat improving the business climate. My Cabinet has \r\nidentified three specific projects within each priority \r\nsector and translated that into an implementation \r\nplan for the next two years. The projects range from \r\nthe completion of essential roads and rail lines, to \r\nsetting up alternative energy sources and undertaking \r\nbusiness climate reform to attract investment into \r\nagro-processing and mining. The projects will set our \r\ncountry on a path of fulfilling its full potential. \r\nIn addition, I have also launched two initiatives — the \r\nPresidential Initiative on Maternal Health and Safe \r\nMotherhood, and the Presidential Initiative on Poverty \r\nand Hunger Reduction — to fast-track the interventions \r\nneeded to address the social needs of disadvantaged \r\ngroups, especially women and youth.\r\nMalawi refuses to accept what others may consider \r\nto be our destiny — the status of underdevelopment. \r\nMalawi is committed to change that perception. But in \r\nso doing, my Government and, indeed, the people of \r\n18 12-52207\r\nA/67/PV.10\r\nsustainable development. The implementation of these \r\nagreements is very crucial for our future.\r\nFinally, on the issue of the reform of the United \r\nNations, Malawi fully supports the expansion of the \r\nSecurity Council in both permanent and non-permanent \r\ncategories. As members of the Assembly are aware, \r\nAfrica represents one of the single largest regions \r\nwithin the United Nations, and a very significant \r\nproportion of issues discussed in the Security Council \r\nconcern the African continent. It is for those reasons, \r\ntherefore, that Malawi joins the rest of the African \r\nnations in demanding at least two seats in the permanent \r\ncategory and five seats in the non-permanent category, \r\nas stipulated in the Ezulwini Consensus. Africa has to \r\nlead its own development, and that will be a step in \r\nensuring that it can.\r\nAt this moment, I say to the Assembly that Malawi \r\nis on a journey – a journey to change its trajectory; a \r\njourney to make real change happen; a journey to foster \r\nprivate-sector growth; a journey to be an integral part \r\nof the global community.  Malawi is ready to take its \r\nturn to grow, not just in wealth, but in opportunities, \r\nhopes and freedoms for all of the Malawian people. \r\nAs a new President and a new member of the global \r\ncommunity of leaders, I ask for the Assembly’s support \r\nas this one African country journeys to realize its full \r\npotential — for its people, for Africa and for the world.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Malawi for the statement she has just made. \r\nMrs. Joyce Hilda Mtila Banda, President of the \r\nRepublic of Malawi, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.15 p.m.\r\nMalawi know that we need to engage the rest of the \r\nglobal community. That is why, within days of taking \r\noffice, I reopened dialogue and engagement with our \r\nneighbours, with African leaders and with the rest of the \r\nworld. The people of Malawi are grateful for the good \r\nwill that many have shown us, and we are encouraged \r\nby the support of our partners.\r\nMalawi will continue to need global support in \r\nthe short and medium terms. We need this support \r\nto protect the rural poor from food shortages caused \r\nby prolonged dry spells in some parts of the country. \r\nMalawi is looking for partnerships to build its energy \r\ncapacity. Malawi needs support to attract private \r\ninvestment for the rich potential we have in agro-\r\nprocessing and mining, among others. We are looking \r\nfor partnerships to support the development of our \r\ntransport and communications infrastructure in order \r\nto improve access to markets.\r\nBefore I conclude I wish to draw the Assembly’s \r\nattention to the following three issues that have a \r\nbearing on most of the least developed countries. \r\nFirst, I call upon the General Assembly to ensure that \r\nthe Istanbul Declaration and Programme of Action, \r\nadopted in Turkey in May 2011, will be implemented \r\nin their entirety in an effective and timely manner. \r\nIn particular, duty-free and quota-free market access \r\nand supply-side capacity must be ensured to the least \r\ndeveloped countries.\r\nSecondly, most least developed countries are facing \r\nthe adverse effects of climate change, which is causing \r\nf looding, land degradation and drought. In that regard, \r\nMalawi welcomes the recent outcome of the United \r\nNations Conference on Sustainable Development held \r\nin Brazil, where international consensus emerged \r\nand agreement was reached on important areas of \r\n"
