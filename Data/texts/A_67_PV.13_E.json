Allow me also to convey my deep respect \r\nfor the tireless efforts that His Excellency Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon has made as leader of the \r\nSecretariat and as a world statesman.\r\nToday our world continues to face numerous \r\narduous challenges that require an urgent and collective \r\nresponse. Many of the gravest threats to the States \r\nmembers of the Assembly, including mine, the Federated \r\nStates of Micronesia, are simply beyond the abilities of \r\nour individual countries to single-handedly address, \r\neven with our most aggressive and concentrated efforts. \r\nTo speak before this body today is an honour and an \r\nopportunity that I must take to encourage international \r\ncooperation to help address those challenges.\r\nThe biggest challenge we face today in Micronesia \r\ncontinues to be climate change, not just the projections \r\nof future loss and damage, but the dangerous impacts \r\nthat my people are experiencing every day. Sadly, \r\nto date no significant progress has been made on \r\nclimate-change mitigation. Time and again, I have \r\nasked, “How do I tell my people that their plight and \r\ntheir future lie in the hands of those most responsible \r\nfor greenhouse gases?”\r\nFrom our point of view, we must step up our \r\ncollective efforts to confront global climate change \r\nmore urgently and more creatively. What is needed \r\nnow is to close the ambition gap. I therefore call on the \r\nmajor emitters to step up their level of commitment \r\nunder the Kyoto Protocol. Our very existence depends \r\non it. Without international cooperation and assistance, \r\nwe are helpless against the adverse impacts of climate \r\nchange.\r\nMicronesia has barely contributed to the problem \r\nof climate change; it has, in fact, contributed to some of \r\nthe solutions thereto. We actively participate in United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change \r\nnegotiations and continue to advocate for significant \r\ncuts in greenhouse-gas emissions.\r\nUnited Nations A/67/PV.13\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-seventh session\r\n13th plenary meeting\r\nThursday, 27 September 2012, 3 p.m.\r\nNew York\r\nOffi cial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Jeremić . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Serbia)\r\n2 12-52343\r\nA/67/PV.13\r\nWe were therefore pleased with the agreement \r\nreached this summer in Rio to begin cooperation on a \r\nglobal phase-down in the production and consumption of \r\nhydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). Micronesia first proposed \r\namending the Montreal Protocol on Substances that \r\nDeplete the Ozone Layer in 2009. Today it remains \r\nthe ideal venue for a phase-down of the production \r\nand consumption of HFCs, just as has been done with \r\nrespect to similar gases that HFCs were invented to \r\nreplace.\r\nTo the rest of the world, the map may look fairly \r\nempty on our side of the globe, but to all of us it is \r\nas much a homeland as any continental land mass. We \r\nmust treat it accordingly, and we must defend it just as \r\nstrongly. And therein lies our second, closely related \r\nchallenge: the change in our ocean environment. That \r\nchange includes not only rising tides and temperatures \r\nand ocean acidification, but also the damage caused by \r\nharmful and destructive fishing practices, pollutants \r\nsuch as mercury and oil, and other waste resulting from \r\nunsustainable human activity. The abhorrent practice of \r\nillegal, unreported and unregulated fishing continues \r\nunabated, and urgent actions to reduce by-catch, fish \r\ndiscards and post-harvest losses must be taken.\r\nFor us, as a Pacific small island developing State, \r\nour livelihood, our economy, our culture and our \r\nway of living are tied to a blue economy. We have \r\nrecognized that the conservation and sustainable use \r\nof the ocean and its resources are key elements in \r\nachieving sustainable development. We must fulfil our \r\ncommitments made at Rio.\r\nMy country welcomes the decision taken in Rio \r\nto hold a global conference on small island developing \r\nStates in 2014. Micronesia fully supports that decision \r\nand reiterates its call to hold such a conference in one of \r\nthe Pacific small island developing States.\r\nThe rising cost of global energy continues to pose \r\na serious challenge to our socioeconomic development \r\nand sustainability. Small island developing States such \r\nas Micronesia continue to rely heavily on imported \r\nfossil fuel despite the abundance of renewable energy \r\nsources. Our unique and particular vulnerabilities \r\noften translate into significantly higher costs for energy \r\ninfrastructure and fossil fuels. As a consequence, our \r\nGovernments spend a high percentage of our limited \r\nbudgets on fossil-fuel procurement alone, often at the \r\nexpense of the other sectors of our economies.\r\nTo mitigate that situation, small island developing \r\nStates adopted the Barbados Declaration on Achieving \r\nSustainable Energy for All in Small Island Developing \r\nStates, which has become an annex to the outcome \r\ndocument of the United Nations Conference on \r\nSustainable Development, adopted last June. That \r\nis a concrete expression of the small islands’ own \r\ndetermination and ambition to promote renewable \r\nenergy, energy efficiency, energy access and low-\r\ncarbon development.\r\nHowever, our transition to renewable energy \r\nrequires financing and new, appropriate and affordable \r\ntechnology. To that end, I must recognize and commend \r\nthe bilateral assistance already provided in that area by \r\nthe European Union, Japan, China, the United States, \r\nFrance, Italy and Turkey, as well as others that are also \r\nassisting through other multilateral arrangements. We \r\nurge other partners to join us to ensure sustainability. \r\nWe also urge support for the Secretary-General’s \r\ninitiative on “Sustainable Energy for All”.\r\nOur health-care system is increasingly under \r\nstress and facing constant challenges from the growing \r\nburden of non-communicable diseases, which has \r\nreached epidemic proportions in the Pacific. While we \r\naccept that the primary responsibility for health rests \r\nwith our Government, we are seeking assistance from \r\nthe international community in capacity-building, \r\ninstitutional strengthening and policy formulation. \r\nWhile we recognize the contributing effects of nutrition \r\nand lifestyle in that epidemic, we are also mindful of the \r\nfact that climate change has magnified the challenge as \r\na result of the threat it poses to food security and the \r\ntraditional lifestyle of Micronesians.\r\nThe Federated States of Micronesia supports the \r\ngreater participation of women in social, political \r\nand economic development. We look to development \r\npartners to enhance our investment in ensuring that the \r\npotential of women is nurtured and realized through \r\nquality education, health-care services and security \r\nmeasures against domestic and gender-based violence. \r\nIt is only appropriate that measures to empower women \r\nto be true participants in nation-building should be \r\nlocally driven. We have embarked on mainstreaming \r\nwomen’s views, interests and contributions into national \r\ndevelopment policies. We recognize and appreciate \r\nthe assistance extended by the United Nations system \r\nand our development partners to support our national \r\npolicies to enhance gender equality.\r\n12-52343 3\r\nA/67/PV.13\r\nAddress by Mr. Mohamed Waheed, President of the \r\nRepublic of Maldives\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nMaldives.\r\nMr. Mohamed Waheed, President of the Republic of \r\nMaldives, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Mohamed Waheed, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Maldives, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Waheed: At the outset, I express my \r\ndelegation’s warmest congratulations to the President on \r\nassuming office to preside over the General Assembly \r\nat its sixty-seventh session. I would like to record our \r\ndeepest appreciation to his predecessor, His Excellency \r\nMr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, for his untiring efforts \r\nin steering the deliberations of the sixty-sixth session to \r\na successful conclusion.\r\nI also wish to congratulate the Secretary-General, \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his extraordinary \r\nreport (A/67/1) presented to the Assembly on Tuesday. \r\nDespite the many unprecedented challenges facing the \r\nUnited Nations today, we remain confident that the \r\nSecretary-General’s leadership and the resolve of the \r\nOrganization and of humankind will not waver.\r\nI represent a small yet proud island nation that has \r\nlong advocated for an effective international framework \r\nfor the security of small States, that has vigorously \r\ncampaigned for international actions to combat climate \r\nchange and that has contributed to breaking the \r\ninternational silence on the human rights implications \r\nof climate change.\r\nI come from a nation that has successfully moved \r\nfrom an authoritarian system to a multiparty democratic \r\nsystem of governance — a historic transition achieved \r\npurely by peaceful means. That is why Maldivians show \r\ntheir solidarity with people everywhere in the world \r\nwho struggle to replace despotism with democracy. \r\nThat is why we support the ongoing democratization \r\nprocess in the Middle East and North Africa, and that \r\nis why we applaud Tunisia and Egypt for holding their \r\nfirst post-transition elections in a free and fair manner. \r\nTurning to our Organization, the single most urgent \r\nneed is to reform the Security Council. Naturally, such \r\nan important step must not be taken in haste. However, \r\nafter more than a decade of talking, we should be close \r\nto finding an acceptable formulation. Success on this \r\nissue will strengthen the Organization and stimulate \r\nand renew confidence in the Charter.\r\nMy country subscribes to the principles of peace, \r\nsecurity and prosperity, as enshrined in the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations. We are horrified by the senseless \r\nkilling of thousands of innocent civilians in Syria. \r\nOver the past two weeks, we have witnessed surges \r\nin violence. We join the international community in \r\ncondemning violence, in particular the attacks on \r\ndiplomatic missions, diplomats and personnel in Libya \r\nand Egypt. We must be bold in our actions to prevent \r\nsuch attacks. I call on Member States to continue their \r\nefforts to find peaceful solutions to these conflicts, \r\nespecially the most challenging ones.\r\nThe United Nations has the unique opportunity \r\nto address and solve the many challenges facing its \r\nweakest and most vulnerable States Members. The \r\nchallenge lies in how the Organization and its most able \r\nMembers can turn their many ambitious statements \r\ninto mobilizing the required resources to successfully \r\nprotect the citizens of the world.\r\nWe in the Federated States of Micronesia, facing \r\nour troubled world, continue to place our faith in the \r\nUnited Nations as we look towards future. Our isolation \r\namid the vast expanse of the Pacific Ocean no longer \r\nshields us from the threat of international terrorism. \r\nGlobalization has long had a foothold on our island \r\nState. Facebook links us to the world.\r\nAllow me to end with a quote from my Constitution: \r\n“The seas bring together, they do not separate us .... \r\nWe extend to all nations what we seek from each: \r\npeace, friendship, cooperation and love in our common \r\nhumanity”.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President and Head of \r\nGovernment of the Federated States of Micronesia for \r\nthe statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Emanuel Mori, President and Head of \r\nGovernment of the Federated States of Micronesia, \r\nwas escorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\n4 12-52343\r\nA/67/PV.13\r\nWhile the democratization processes in other \r\ncountries in the region are on an upward trajectory, we \r\nsee violence and human rights violations in Syria. We \r\nurge the Syrian security forces and anti-Government \r\narmed groups to immediately cease all hostilities and \r\nviolence. We welcome the latest findings of the United \r\nNations commission of inquiry on the human rights \r\nsituation in Syria.\r\nWe strongly believe that tolerance and mutual \r\nrespect should prevail among different religions and \r\ncultures to ensure that the world we live in remains \r\npeaceful and harmonious for the future of our children. \r\nThe Maldives strongly condemns the recent anti-Islamic \r\nvideo demeaning our Prophet Muhammad — peace be \r\nupon him. Freedom of expression should not be used as \r\nan excuse to insult religions, incite hatred or provoke \r\ncommunal violence. While the video has provoked \r\ndemonstrations around the world, the Maldives does \r\nnot believe that violence is the way to respond to such \r\nlow-level blasphemous acts.\r\nThe Maldives has also condemned the attack on \r\nthe United States Consulate in Benghazi, which took \r\nthe life of the United States Ambassador to Libya. On \r\nbehalf of the Maldivian people, I express my deepest \r\ncondolences to the United States Government and the \r\nfamilies of the bereaved.\r\nMy delegation and I express the wishes of the \r\nMaldivian people to see the day that the Palestinian \r\npeople join the United Nations as a full Member. The \r\nMaldives strongly calls on all Member States to support \r\nthe true aspirations of the Palestinian people and their \r\nright to self-determination in a Palestinian State.\r\nIn June we, the leaders of the world, agreed \r\nto signal our solid political commitment towards \r\nestablishing sustainable development goals. We believe \r\nthat those goals would further strengthen the social, \r\neconomic and environmental well-being of nations. \r\nThe 2015 development agenda should recognize the \r\nparticular characteristics and needs of small States. It \r\nshould support the creation of a stronger international \r\narchitecture to achieve a sustainable future for all.\r\nClimate change remains the most important and \r\ncomplex developmental challenge that small States face. \r\nWe face the threat of rising sea levels. We experience \r\nocean acidification, changes in average temperature \r\nand variable precipitation. Coastal erosion is a serious \r\nproblem in the Maldives, affecting more than 113 \r\nislands. An additional 120 islands need emergency \r\nwater during the dry season. The Government now \r\nspends more than 27 per cent of our national budget on \r\nbuilding our resilience to combat the effects of climate \r\nchange.\r\nThe Maldives reiterates its call for a binding \r\nagreement to reduce global carbon emissions. The world \r\ncannot afford to wait any longer for such an agreement; \r\nnor can we. The absence of a global accord is no excuse \r\nfor doing nothing. The Maldives is one of the smallest \r\nisland economies in the world. Our contribution to \r\nglobal emissions is 0.003 per cent, yet we are the most \r\nvulnerable to the effects of climate change. For that \r\nreason, we are also taking difficult and bold measures \r\nto combat climate change. We were among the first \r\ncountries in the world to eradicate chlorofluorocarbons \r\nwell ahead of time. We intend to become the first to \r\neradicate hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) by 2020. \r\nAnd we intend to become the first to ban the import \r\nof HCFC-based equipment. A number of our islands \r\nare also scaling up renewable energy, not only to avoid \r\nspending 20 per cent of our gross domestic product \r\non importing fossil fuel, but also to reduce harmful \r\nemissions.\r\nHence, we are converting to solar or hybrid sources. \r\nA total of 20 islands in the Maldives will switch to \r\nrenewable energy sources for power by next year. Those \r\nmeasures are part of a national initiative to transform \r\nthe country’s economy into a low-carbon one. If we \r\ncan take those measures, why cannot the larger States, \r\nendowed with more resources, take stronger measures? \r\nThat requires political commitment and difficult \r\nchoices. I therefore call upon carbon-emitting countries \r\nto develop and utilize clean and renewable energy to \r\nreduce their carbon footprint.\r\nClimate change is just one of many challenges \r\nfaced by the Maldives. The country’s transition to \r\ndemocracy, which has reached a critical point, is \r\nanother pressing challenge that we are determined to \r\novercome. Four years ago, the Maldives held its first \r\ncompetitive, multiparty presidential elections. That \r\nwas a watershed moment in the country’s long march \r\ntowards democratic governance. Four years after \r\nthat historic election, in October 2008, people in the \r\nMaldives ask if their lives are any better. The answer, \r\nregrettably, is, not yet. Multiparty democracy in the \r\nMaldives has so far been deeply divisive. It is also \r\npolarizing, tearing apart families and the fabric of a \r\nsmall, homogenous society. Political leaders elected \r\nto office by popular vote chose to act with impunity. \r\n12-52343 5\r\nA/67/PV.13\r\nCenturies-old values of respect and tolerance have been \r\nreplaced by intolerance and hatred in the islands where \r\nalmost everyone literally knows everybody else. That \r\nis not because there is any inherent deficiency in the \r\ndemocratic form of governance; rather, it is because \r\nthe road to liberal democracy is always rocky and long \r\nand must be navigated by a political leadership with an \r\nunshakeable commitment to the principles and values \r\nof democracy.\r\nThe past eight months have been particularly \r\nchallenging for the consolidation of democracy in my \r\ncountry. The elected President of the country resigned \r\nin February, and later claimed that he was forced to do \r\nso. The Government opened a commission of inquiry to \r\ninvestigate the allegations. Some of our friends rushed \r\nto conclusions, and that did not make it any easier for \r\nus. Some big States and some not so big States took \r\nsides in a domestic political crisis and contributed to \r\nmaking a bad situation worse. While the Government \r\nwas striving to strengthen the country’s institutional \r\ncapacity to manage the new democracy, some \r\ninternational actors continued to publicly criticize the \r\ncountry’s young institutions.\r\nWe look for new ideas and are receptive to good \r\nones, irrespective of where they come from. That \r\nis why we engage in international cooperation. We \r\nexpect the result of international cooperation to help, \r\nnot hinder, a country’s march towards a better, more \r\ndemocratic society. It is supposed to build a country’s \r\ninstitutions and to gain public confidence. International \r\ncooperation should not be used to undermine national \r\ncapacities. It should not be used as an excuse for larger \r\ncountries to interfere in the domestic politics of small \r\nStates.\r\nSmall States are vulnerable in many ways. We \r\nalone are not able to stop larger and stronger countries \r\nfrom dictating terms. Our vulnerability is particularly \r\nacute when there is discord and system breakdowns in \r\nour countries. This is the time when the larger States \r\nshould help the smaller States in the international \r\nsystem. \r\nThe history of a nation is never a single event or \r\na single person. The life of our nation is composed of \r\nthe lives of all of us who live there. We are the building \r\nblocks in the evolution of our countries. The knowledge, \r\neducation, experience and commitment we bring to \r\nour nation are what shapes our history. They make our \r\nhistory unique. Respect for us and our small nation \r\nrequires that our external partners not underestimate \r\nour capacity to contribute to the shaping of our own \r\ndestiny. Nations must be allowed to resolve their \r\nproblems on their own. The international community \r\nshould not take punitive actions against any sovereign \r\nState unless there is verifiable and blatant abuse of \r\nhuman rights.\r\nYet I believe that international cooperation can \r\nand should promote positive change in emerging \r\ndemocracies. I believe that international organizations \r\nsuch as the United Nations can play a pivotal role in \r\nstrengthening democratic institutions in such nations. \r\nI believe that some of the advanced democracies \r\ncan also help small States with technical expertise in \r\nconsolidating democracy. \r\nTo do that, it is important to recognize the unique \r\nchallenges and characteristics of small States. It is \r\nimportant to protect the social fabric of the tightly knit \r\nsocieties in our countries. It is important to review \r\ncurrent approaches and modalities for extending \r\ninternational cooperation in the promotion of democracy. \r\nIt is important that international cooperation not be \r\nseen to be promoting a particular ideology. It should \r\nnot be seen to be taking sides in domestic politics. \r\nInternational cooperation should be seen to promote and \r\nencourage a home-grown democracy that is consistent \r\nwith universally accepted values and principles.\r\nRegular, free and fair elections are a fundamental \r\ncomponent in any democracy. Yet holding elections is \r\nnot, by itself, a sufficient condition for consolidating \r\ndemocracy. It requires patience. It requires making hard \r\nchoices and compromises. And it requires cultivating \r\nand nurturing democratic values. My Government is \r\nimplementing a comprehensive plan to nurture such \r\nvalues in the Maldives. We are committed to creating an \r\nenvironment that guarantees individual freedom, where \r\nhuman rights are fully protected, where democratic \r\nvalues f lourish and where human innovation thrives. \r\nWe are committed to creating a democratic and free \r\nsociety that is able to shape its own destiny.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I thank the President of the Republic of \r\nMaldives for the statement he has just made. \r\nMr. Mohamed Waheed, President of the Republic of \r\nMaldives, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\n6 12-52343\r\nA/67/PV.13\r\nAddress by Mr. Luis Federico Franco Gómez, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Paraguay\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Paraguay. \r\nMr. Luis Federico Franco Gómez, President of \r\nthe Republic of Paraguay, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Luis Federico Franco \r\nGómez, President of the Republic of Paraguay, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly. \r\nPresident Franco Gómez (spoke in Spanish): At \r\nthe opening of my statement in today’s general debate, \r\nallow me to express to Mr. Vuk Jeremić, President \r\nof the General Assembly, the satisfaction felt by the \r\nRepublic of Paraguay at seeing him preside over the \r\nwork of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh \r\nsession. He can be assured of my delegation’s constant \r\nsupport during his time in office. Allow me also to \r\ncongratulate Ambassador Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser \r\nfor his important and effective work as President of \r\nthe General Assembly at its previous session. I also \r\nextend my congratulations to Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon for his commendable work during the past six \r\nyears at the head of the Organization, during which he \r\ndemonstrated his firm commitment to global peace and \r\ninternational security.\r\nIn relation to the theme of the general debate, \r\n“Bringing about adjustment or settlement of \r\ninternational disputes or situations by peaceful means”, \r\nthe Government of Paraguay once again asserts and \r\nconfirms the importance of settling disputes by peaceful \r\nmeans while respecting the principles of international \r\nlaw. Relations between States would be fairer, more \r\nsupportive and more equitable were they governed by \r\nfull compliance with international law, the principles \r\nof which guide and direct the peaceful settlement of \r\ndisputes. In my country’s view, favouring political \r\nexpediency over treaty commitments is unacceptable, \r\nbecause political considerations can never take \r\nprecedence over formal international agreements.\r\nOn this first and last time that I will address \r\nthe General Assembly, I believe it is necessary and \r\nunavoidable to elucidate to the international community \r\nthe political process that my country is currently \r\nundergoing. The history of Paraguay changed on the \r\nnight of 22 June. The National Congress, exercising its \r\nconstitutional powers — and I would like to publicly \r\nexpress my appreciation for the presence here today of \r\nthe Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Paraguay, \r\nsenators and members of Parliament, the President of the \r\nChamber of Deputies, and persons of various political \r\nstripes — decided by near-unanimity to remove the \r\nthen-President from office by means of an impeachment \r\nprocess established under the Constitution.\r\nThe Paraguayan Congress sought in that manner to \r\nput an end to a very serious political crisis that threatened \r\nthe country, in which 17 fellow countrymen had already \r\nlost their lives, and to avoid further bloodshed and grief \r\non Paraguayan soil. As mandated by the Constitution and \r\nowing to my duty as Vice-President, I assumed office \r\nas President of the Republic. Since then, in accordance \r\nwith my oath of office, I have been governing Paraguay \r\npeacefully and democratically, fully respecting public \r\nfreedoms. The Government of Paraguay, along with the \r\noverwhelming majority of Paraguayans, takes pride \r\nin the fact that there are no political prisoners in the \r\ncountry, that nobody has been exiled, that freedom \r\nof the press and freedom of expression are fully \r\nguaranteed, and that each and every right enshrined in \r\nhuman rights agreements signed within the framework \r\nof the United Nations, as well as in the Organization of \r\nAmerican States, is ensured.\r\nParaguay has normal diplomatic relations with the \r\ngreat majority of the States Members of the United \r\nNations. We guarantee to all of them that Paraguay \r\nwill continue to work tirelessly in favour of peace and \r\nsecurity, the basic pillars of our Organization. \r\nNonetheless, Paraguay finds itself in a difficult \r\ninternational situation, one created by its neighbours, \r\nthe members of the Southern Common Market and the \r\nUnion of South American Nations. Both entities have \r\nadopted sanctions against the Republic of Paraguay \r\nwithout allowing it to exercise its right to defend itself, \r\na right that is clearly set forth in the international \r\nagreements that are invoked for the application of \r\nsanctions. In violation of international treaties, those \r\ncountries have attempted to become the custodians of \r\nParaguayan democracy, putting aside the principle of \r\nnon-intervention enshrined in the Charter of the United \r\nNations. \r\nThroughout its history, Paraguay has repeatedly \r\nsuffered from arrogant interventions in its internal \r\naffairs. \r\n12-52343 7\r\nA/67/PV.13\r\nThe holocaust brought on by the War of the Triple \r\nAlliance, stemming from an unjustifiable coalition, \r\nhas still not faded from the memory of my people. It \r\ndecimated my country’s population and destroyed its \r\neconomy.\r\nIn the short period that my Government has served, \r\nour critics have been unable to find a single violation of \r\nthe agreements that I have mentioned. The great Justo \r\nPastor Benítez, a famous Paraguayan politician, rightly \r\nmaintained that it is dangerous to be right where there \r\nis no justice.\r\nBefore humankind’s highest Assembly, I clearly \r\nstate that Paraguay will never accept interference in \r\nits internal affairs by foreign Powers. We will continue \r\nto build our democracy in accordance with the will of \r\nthe Paraguayan people, and fully implement it through \r\nour freely elected institutions. We are certain that \r\nwe know how to get through this crucial period with \r\ndignity and integrity. We will not be subjugated. We \r\ncall on members to reflect and work together to find the \r\npath towards rebuilding South American integration, \r\nwhich is currently compromised. Peace is built through \r\ndialogue, to which we are open.\r\nThose who today wish to become leading actors in \r\nthe international community will have to acknowledge \r\nthat that is not possible without regional unity. \r\nLeadership is built through respect for international \r\nlaw. That is the only way that we will have a common \r\nposition on Security Council reform, which is a long-\r\nstanding wish of the universal institution that embraces \r\nus.\r\nIn such difficult times for the international \r\ncommunity, we will find solutions to our current \r\npolitical and economic difficulties only by putting \r\ninternational institutions on the path for which they \r\nwere established, namely, to serve the women and men \r\nthat build humankind’s future day by day. Paraguay, \r\na founding member of the Organization, remains \r\ncommitted to that.\r\nThe various events in different parts of our planet \r\nthis past year demonstrate the relevance and true \r\nvalidity of a forum such as the United Nations in the \r\ninternational arena. That is why there is an urgent need \r\nfor the courageous, innovative and profound reform of \r\nits organs, structure and functions. Changes are needed \r\nto adapt the Organization so that it can respond with \r\ngreater effectiveness and agility to an international \r\nagenda that is very different from that which existed \r\nwhen the United Nations was conceived. Moreover, it \r\nfaces a shifting dynamic in the international picture \r\nthat was impossible to envision at its inception.\r\nThat is why Paraguay calls on the international \r\ncommunity to strive towards the wonderful international \r\nutopia of a universal Organization governed by the \r\nstrong and the weak, the large and the small, and the \r\nrich and the poor, all equal in a great world Assembly. \r\nParaguay believes that it is necessary to insist that the \r\nreform process include the gradual elimination of the \r\nveto power.\r\nThis year, on the twentieth anniversary of the \r\nhistoric United Nations Conference on Environment and \r\nDevelopment, held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 and known \r\nas the Earth Summit, we believe that it is necessary \r\nto reaffirm the belief that sustainable development \r\nand its economic, social and environmental aspects \r\nmust be the linchpin of the United Nations focus. The \r\nRepublic of Paraguay therefore reaffirms its belief \r\nin that goal and in the need to maintain the balance \r\nbetween economic development, social development \r\nand environmental protection as interdependent pillars \r\nof human development.\r\nAs the world’s largest producer per capita of clean \r\nrenewable hydroelectric energy, which drives our \r\neconomy and its industrialization, we will use that \r\nenergy for the country’s development for the benefit of \r\nthe Paraguayans and foreigners who inhabit our land \r\nand shape its future. That energy, which we will use \r\nlittle by little, will be another driver of our well-being.\r\nThe issue of landlocked developing countries \r\n(LLDCs) is an important aspect of Paraguay’s foreign \r\npolicy. The asymmetry and disadvantages of our \r\ngeographical position have caused and continue to \r\ncause a huge problem that can be offset only through \r\ninternational recognition and special and differentiated \r\ntreatment on the part of the developed economies that \r\nseeks to include Paraguay in the globalized world.\r\nIn that regard, on 12 September, during the recent \r\nfourth Meeting of Trade Ministers of Landlocked \r\nDeveloping Countries, a group that Paraguay had the \r\nhonour of chairing during the biennium 2010-2011, \r\nthe need for transit States, in the first place, and the \r\ninternational community, as a whole, to duly recognize \r\nthe comparative disadvantages of our countries in \r\nrelation to the conditions needed for their development \r\nwas underscored.\r\n8 12-52343\r\nA/67/PV.13\r\ngrey list and is now, as a result of our efforts, included \r\non the white list, a fact that we are proud of, as a \r\nmember of our region and in line with our commitment \r\nto the fight against money-laundering and the financing \r\nof terrorism.\r\nPromoting and building awareness of, and full \r\nrespect for, human rights worldwide must continue \r\nto be one of the unchanging and incontrovertible \r\ncommitments on our Organization’s international \r\nagenda. Human rights violations are a scourge that \r\nmust forever be eradicated from our civilization.\r\nThe Government of Paraguay reiterates that the \r\ngrowth of nations can be achieved only through social \r\nequality, by prioritizing basic needs such as education, \r\nhealth and land reform. Growth without social \r\ndevelopment will only result in a world that is more \r\nunequal and unjust.\r\nThe Paraguayan Government is actively working to \r\nbuild a development model that gives priority to decent \r\nwork. In that regard we are promoting mechanisms \r\nwithin the framework of a State policy aimed at \r\nimproving working conditions. They include, first, \r\nthe creation of a Ministry of Labour, Employment \r\nand Social Security; secondly, the ratification of \r\nthe Domestic Workers Convention No.189 of the \r\nInternational Labour Organization, adopted in 2011 by \r\nthe International Labour Conference in order to improve \r\nthe working conditions of thousands of domestic \r\nworkers in Paraguay; and thirdly, the implementation \r\nof an employment policy for young people through \r\na bill aimed at enabling young people to enter the \r\nworkforce, which has been partially approved by the \r\nNational Congress.\r\nSince its beginning, my Government has maintained \r\nits belief in and commitment to making inexorable \r\nprogress towards equal opportunities and rights for \r\nall of Paraguay’s inhabitants. In that regard, we have \r\nnever faltered in the constant struggle for full social, \r\neconomic, political and cultural rights for women. As \r\nevidence of those firm beliefs, soon after assuming \r\nits duties, my Government decided to upgrade the \r\nSecretariat for Women’s Issues to an executive ministry, \r\nin accordance with United Nations recommendations. \r\nFinally, in that respect, I must mention our satisfaction \r\nwith, and full commitment to, Paraguay’s election for a \r\nnew term as member of the Commission on the Status \r\nof Women for 2013-2017.\r\nParaguay wishes to reiterate here its commitment to \r\ninternational peace and security. In the specific context \r\nof United Nations peacekeeping operations, it affirms \r\nits political willingness to continue contributing \r\nhuman resources to such operations. Regionally, we \r\nhighlight the progress achieved by the United Nations \r\nStabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH). Paraguay \r\nincreased its deployment to MINUSTAH by more \r\nthan 100 troops to show its firm commitment to the \r\nreconstruction of a brother country devastated by the \r\nscourges of nature.\r\nI would also like to underscore the effort and \r\ncommitment of the Paraguayan military observers in \r\nthe increasingly difficult situation in the Syrian Arab \r\nRepublic, where they have remained, even in the most \r\ndifficult circumstances. I take this opportunity to pay \r\ntribute to those soldiers who perform their duties, in \r\nmany parts of the world, with dedication, hard work and \r\nsacrifice in the service of the United Nations. Today, \r\nwe must all also remember the obligation of Member \r\nStates to protect and defend the security of diplomatic \r\nand consular premises in all countries. \r\nParaguay is increasingly concerned about the \r\ngrowth in transnational organized crime in its worst \r\nmanifestations, namely, drug trafficking on a large and a \r\nsmall scale, arms trafficking and trafficking in migrants \r\nand in persons, among others. Those transnational \r\ncrimes stem mainly the social and economic inequality \r\nof our peoples. Joint international efforts are needed, \r\ntherefore, in order to fight such scourges head on. The \r\nGovernment of Paraguay reaffirms its unequivocal \r\ncommitment to the fight against all activities of \r\ncriminal organizations and calls for a stronger position \r\non the part of developed countries, where most of the \r\ndemand associated with those crimes originates.\r\nParaguay also reaffirms its strong condemnation \r\nof terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. For \r\nthat reason, Paraguay, through its Secretariat for the \r\nPrevention of the Laundering of Money and Goods and \r\nin close cooperation with other national institutions, \r\nhas made a coordinated effort to bring its legal and \r\nnormative framework in line with its commitments and \r\nwith the recommendations made by the international \r\norganizations charged with preventing and prosecuting \r\ncrimes related to money laundering and the financing \r\nof terrorism. Laws and resolutions have been passed \r\npursuant to the recommendations of the Financial \r\nAction Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF). In \r\nFebruary 2012, Paraguay was removed from the FATF \r\n12-52343 9\r\nA/67/PV.13\r\nlife have all globally improved. Despite unprecedented \r\nglobal awareness, climate change remains a major \r\nsource of concern. The continuing deterioration of the \r\nglobal economic climate is also a permanent source \r\nof anxiety everywhere. Threats to peace and security \r\nin various parts of the world show how far we still \r\nare from achieving the global security we want. It is \r\ntherefore only fair that we expect the United Nations, \r\nthe Organization we have placed at the centre of our \r\ninternational architecture, to be more responsive, \r\nefficient, effective and transparent.\r\nThis year Albania celebrates the one hundredth \r\nanniversary of its independence. As we mark that \r\nimportant date and survey our history for the past 10 \r\ndecades, we note with satisfaction that for more than half \r\nof that time the State of Albania has enjoyed successful \r\ncooperation and active participation in the life of the \r\nUnited Nations. Our commitment has grown over the \r\nyears and has embraced almost every aspect of United \r\nNations activity, including peacekeeping operations. In \r\nrecent years we have devoted particular attention to the \r\nongoing efforts to reform the Organization’s system. \r\nAs that system has developed and its activities have \r\nbecome more complex, the need for greater coherence \r\nand efficiency within the Organization as a whole has \r\ngrown pressing. That is particularly evident in the area \r\nof United Nations development assistance.\r\nIn June, as one of the pilot countries for the \r\nDelivering as One approach, we hosted the fifth High-\r\nlevel Intergovernmental Conference on Delivering \r\nas One. The Tirana Conference adopted an outcome \r\ndocument with concrete and, we hope, valuable \r\nrecommendations in the light of the approaching \r\nquadrennial comprehensive policy review. We know \r\nnow that what started as a test idea has come a long way \r\nin a relatively short time. A growing number of countries \r\nare looking more clearly and closely at the benefits \r\nof seeing the United Nations operate and implement \r\nits assistance programmes with more coherence and \r\nefficiency. Delivering as One has convincingly shown \r\nin practice how the operational activities of the United \r\nNations can be delivered with greater efficiency and \r\nhow the system can do more and better and more with \r\nless in its efforts to help countries reach nationally and \r\ninternationally agreed development goals.\r\nI am proud to represent a country and society \r\nwidely known for their broadmindedness, tolerance and \r\nacceptance of others. Albanians are probably unique to \r\nour region in that, despite having endured centuries of \r\nThe Government of Paraguay, which I have \r\nproudly led since the end of June, now has a historic \r\ndemocratic obligation to organize the general elections \r\nscheduled for 21 April 2013 and to guarantee that they \r\nare peaceful, transparent and exemplary. When the next \r\nPresident takes office, on 15 August 2013, the soundness \r\nof Paraguayan democracy will be confirmed. At that \r\ntime I will look into the eyes of my countrymen and \r\nthose of foreigners who live in our country and shape \r\nour future alongside us and will be able to say: mission \r\naccomplished. I ask God and the Virgin to help us and \r\nto bless us so that all Paraguayans together can move \r\ntowards the future that we want. \r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Paraguay for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Luis Federico Franco Gómez, President of \r\nthe Republic of Paraguay, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\nAddress by Mr. Bujar Nishani, President of the \r\nRepublic of Albania\r\nThe Acting President: The General Assembly will \r\nnow hear an address by the President of the Republic \r\nof Albania.\r\nMr. Bujar Nishani, President of the Republic of \r\nAlbania, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Bujar Nishani, President of \r\nthe Republic of Albania, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly. \r\nPresident Nishani: We gather here every year to \r\nshare our analysis, our views and comments on the \r\ncourse of world events. We also take this opportunity to \r\nshare our concerns and to meet, interact and try to offer \r\nour best commitment to finding appropriate solutions \r\nto current and future challenges. \r\nA year has passed since the last session, and the \r\nworld has continued to change. Development and \r\neconomic growth in many countries have raised \r\nhundreds of millions of people above the poverty \r\nline. Societies throughout the world are taking a stand \r\ntoday, demanding more rights and asking for effective \r\npolitical participation. Democracy, human rights and \r\nincreased participation by women in public and social \r\n10 12-52343\r\nA/67/PV.13\r\ndifficulties in our history, we have always preserved \r\nand cherished the values of freedom and respect for \r\nthe other that are fundamental to the modern concept \r\nof human rights. Albanians’ respect for one another’s \r\nrights and individuality is expressed first and foremost \r\nin an exemplary religious harmony. They have shown \r\nan outstanding acceptance of, and respect for, other \r\ncultures, ethnicities and civilizations, and have devoted \r\nspecial care and attention to those who have come \r\nseeking safe refuge from the horrors of war. Albanians \r\nhave risked their own lives and far outspent their \r\neconomic capacity in order to rescue and save those in \r\nneed who came knocking at their door.\r\nIt is against that backdrop that Albania remains \r\na strong believer in dialogue among civilizations and \r\ncontinues to engage actively in bridging the differences \r\namong the wider membership on issues pertaining to \r\nthe human rights agenda. That is why Albania, which \r\ncurrently presides over the Council of Europe, has chosen \r\n“United in diversity” as its theme. The dialogue among \r\ndifferent cultures and civilizations should be seen as \r\nan ongoing process requiring dedication, goodwill and \r\ncare. We cannot allow the sporadic reckless actions of \r\ndisruptive groups to prevent us from making a genuine \r\neffort to reach a better understanding of one another in \r\na world that is becoming more globalized every day.\r\nAlthough we were saddened and embittered by the \r\nworthless video that deliberately targets what Muslims \r\neverywhere consider sacred, Albanians, Muslims and \r\nChristians alike have expressed their indignation by \r\nsimply ignoring such nonsense. We regret that the \r\nreaction to it in some parts of the world was different, \r\nused instead to fuel blind violence by angry, hopeless \r\ncrowds, with fatal consequences. We must be clear: \r\nany form of terrorism or extremist act on the part of \r\nisolated, malevolent groups should never be confused \r\nwith the position or identified with the attitude of an \r\nentire society or Government. No legitimate anger \r\ncan excuse illegitimate violent acts that Governments, \r\nsocieties and political and religious leaders should \r\nfirmly oppose. We condemn with indignation the \r\nterrorist act against American Consulate staff and \r\npremises in Libya and demand that the perpetrators \r\nbe punished. We also condemn any act of violent \r\nprotest against the Western embassies, whose mission \r\nit is to promote understanding and cooperation among \r\ncountries and nations.\r\nWith a foreign policy based on peace and good \r\nrelations with all nations, its modest but important \r\ncontribution to international missions aimed at \r\nsafeguarding peace and human rights through a policy \r\nof good neighbourliness, as well as its efforts to play a \r\nmoderate and constructive role in the region, Albania \r\nhas become a direct contributor to stability and security \r\non the regional and global levels. We are determined to \r\nmaintain and further build on that record.\r\nToday, Albania participates in peacekeeping \r\nmissions in several international operations within the \r\nframework of the United Nations and other regional \r\nsecurity organizations, including in Afghanistan, \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, Iraq and more. My country \r\nacknowledges and supports every effort towards global \r\npeace and security and will continue to support the \r\nefforts of the United Nations, NATO and other actors to \r\npromote peace, stability and security around the world.\r\nGlobal peace and security continue to be challenged \r\nby tyranny and oppression in various parts of the world. \r\nWe reiterate our strong condemnation of the ferocious \r\nrepression of the freedom-loving people of Syria, whose \r\nblood is being shed through the primitive attacks on \r\nthe part of a regime that has irretrievably forfeited its \r\nlegitimate right to lead and represent the Syrian people. \r\nLet me join all those calling on the Security Council to \r\nstep up and comply with its duty, as mandated in the \r\nUnited Nations Charter, to preserve peace and security. \r\nIt is hard to believe that one can remain indifferent \r\nto events such as the terrible ones that have been \r\nunfolding every day in Syria for a year and a half, with \r\ntens of thousands of human losses and the widespread, \r\ndeliberate destruction and suffering that have already \r\nset the country back by decades.\r\nHave we not already learned the hard lessons of \r\nsimilar mistakes in the past tragedies in Rwanda and \r\nBosnia?\r\nAlbania fully supports the peace process between \r\nPalestine and Israel. Albania reiterates its position \r\nin support of the two-State solution: a secure State \r\nof Israel and a viable State of Palestine, living side \r\nby side with each other in accordance with United \r\nNations resolutions and the road map. The peoples of \r\nboth Palestine and Israel are exhausted by that never-\r\nending conflict, and their leaders should shoulder \r\nthe responsibility of undertaking a legitimate quest \r\nfor freedom and peace, with long-term vision and \r\ngoodwill, and against extremists. The world longs to \r\nsee the peace process in the Middle East shift from a \r\n12-52343 11\r\nA/67/PV.13\r\nthe international law. Just a few days ago, the Republic \r\nof Kosovo reached another level of State consolidation \r\nwith the end of the phase of independence supervised \r\nby the international community.\r\nI take this opportunity to congratulate the \r\nauthorities of Kosovo on their continued progress in \r\nbuilding and strengthening a democratic State and a \r\nmulti-ethnic society, and I call on all those countries \r\nthat have not yet recognized Kosovo to consider a \r\nreview and assessment of that irreversible reality in \r\nthe South-eastern European region. The recognition of \r\nKosovo is an act of justice for a people that has suffered \r\nfor too long, and represents a net contribution to peace \r\nand stability in the Balkans.\r\nWe have already heard, and we are prepared to \r\nlisten once again to the same old redundant arguments \r\nfrom Serbia regarding Kosovo. What war failed to do, \r\npropaganda will not achieve either. While Serbia’s \r\nleaders speak of partition and the redrawing of borders, \r\nand while they make troubling statements denying \r\ngenocide in Srebrenica, one is right to ask whether the \r\npast continues to loom over the present there, obscuring \r\nreality and distorting their vision of the future.\r\nAlbania has maintained strong positive economic \r\ngrowth despite the impact of the global financial \r\nand economic crisis. The pursuit of macroprudential \r\npolicies and well-anchored structural reforms focusing \r\non privatization, fiscal probity, trade liberalization, the \r\nbusiness climate and the energy and financial sectors \r\nhave enabled Albania’s economy to become the most \r\nresilient of the economies of South-east Europe. During \r\nthe period from 2007 to 2012, average economic growth \r\nhas been 5 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), \r\npeaking in 2008 at 8 per cent of GDP. \r\nSince 2008, Albania has had a f lat tax of 10 per \r\ncent; corporate tax has decreased from 25 per cent to \r\n10 per cent; personal income tax has dropped from \r\n23 per cent to 10 per cent; and dozens of fees have \r\nsimply been eliminated. \r\nThe Global Competitiveness Report 2011-2012, \r\npublished by the World Economic Forum, ranks \r\nAlbania seventy-eighth out of 142 countries/economies. \r\nThe World Bank report Doing Business 2012: Doing \r\nBusiness in a More Transparent World ranks Albania \r\neighty-second out of 183 economies in terms of ease \r\nof doing business. In the areas of getting credit and \r\nof protecting investors, Albania ranks twenty-fourth \r\npattern of stagnation and become an inspiring example \r\nof difficult yet indispensable compromises.\r\nAlbania remains deeply worried by the Iranian \r\nnuclear programme, which continues to raise serious \r\nquestions as to its nature instead of providing answers \r\nand guarantees, as requested over the years. We must \r\nprevent Iran from becoming a nuclear threat.\r\nIn November this year, my country will celebrate the \r\ncentenary of its independence. We will commemorate a \r\ncentury that saw a diversity of events, which were not \r\nalways among the happiest ones.\r\nMany have described the Albanian people as \r\nsurvivors of harsh chapters of history. They are not \r\nwrong: the Albanian people have suffered unwanted \r\nwars, forced movement from their lands, assaults and \r\nattempts to annihilate them, unjust partitions and, \r\nduring the second half of the twentieth century, bravely \r\nresisted five decades of communism. All this has come \r\nat a stiff price. Today we look to the future with hope, \r\nin a spirit of deliverance, and with strong confidence \r\nthat the coming century will be marked by continuous \r\npeace, economic progress, and cultural and intellectual \r\nrevitalization.\r\nOur region, which was once a troubled hotspot \r\nand a sick area of Europe, has been profoundly and \r\npositively transformed. Six new States have been born \r\nout of the former Yugoslavia in the course of the past \r\ntwo decades.\r\nWe all know that it has not been easy, and we all \r\nknow why. But what matters most is that everywhere \r\nin the region societies have evolved, the ghosts of the \r\npast have ceded their place to new realities, and people, \r\nin particular the young generation, are more than ever \r\nturned towards the future.\r\nLet me point out here that the establishment of the \r\nindependent State of Kosovo five years ago has become \r\nan important factor of peace and stability in the South-\r\neast European region. It has become stronger and \r\novercome all kinds of obstacles created by those who \r\nstill cannot accept reality and face the truth. As time \r\npasses, independent Kosovo is being recognized and \r\naccepted by an increasing number of States — close to \r\nhalf of the States Members of the United Nations.\r\nThe advisory opinion of the International Court \r\nof Justice on Kosovo (see A/64/881), rendered in 2010 \r\nupon specific request from Serbia, clearly ruled that \r\nthe independence of Kosovo was in conformity with \r\n12 12-52343\r\nA/67/PV.13\r\nPresident El-Magariaf (spoke in Arabic; English \r\ntext provided by the delegation): At the outset, I am \r\npleased to congratulate Mr. Vuk Jeremić on his election \r\nas President of the General Assembly at its sixty-\r\nseventh session. I would like to commend Mr. Nassir \r\nAbdulaziz Al-Nasser for his leadership as President \r\nat the sixty-sixth session. I also wish to express our \r\nprofound gratitude and appreciation to His Excellency \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his valuable efforts \r\nto achieve the purposes and principles of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations.\r\nThree years ago, a despot who ruled my country for \r\n42 years with tyranny and oppression stood at this very \r\nrostrum and tore up a copy of the Charter, saying that he \r\ndid not recognize the authority of the document. Today, \r\nI am standing on the very same rostrum to assure the \r\nAssembly of my delegation’s support and respect for \r\nthe Charter.\r\nToday, I stand before the Assembly and the whole \r\nworld to apologize for all the harm and the crimes \r\ncommitted by that despot against so many innocent \r\npeople, as well as to apologize for the extortion and \r\nterrorism he inflicted on so many States. I want to \r\nassure the Organization that the Libyan people are \r\ndetermined to build a State that respects its neighbours, \r\nits international obligations and human rights, and that \r\nbelieves that genuine peace in the world will not be \r\nrealized unless the conscience of every individual is \r\nbrimming with peace. Libya will be a land of peace and \r\nsecurity and a strong force for peace.\r\nI am speaking today before this international \r\ngathering to convey the greetings of the Libyan \r\npeople, whose revolt on 17 February 2011 turned into \r\na comprehensive, explosive revolution that shook the \r\nvery foundations of the regime of the despot Muammar \r\nAl-Qadhafi, who declared that he would burn and \r\ndestroy Libya and make it swim in a sea of blood. He \r\nkilled thousands of civilians, recruited mercenaries \r\nfrom everywhere, assaulted peoples’ honour, ordered his \r\nmilitias and mercenaries to rape minors, and destroyed \r\ncities. However, our people did not kneel; they did not \r\nback down. Thousands of martyrs were lost among the \r\nwounded and missing. The price of freedom was paid in \r\nblood, lives, amputated limbs and lost youth.\r\nIn this forum, on behalf of the Libyan people, I \r\nsalute the United Nations system, which stood with our \r\npeople, with the will of freedom against blood lust and \r\nannihilation, and adopted Security Council resolutions \r\nand sixteenth, respectively, putting it among the top \r\nreformer countries.\r\nOn our road towards sustained development, \r\nprogress and prosperity, we remain fully engaged and \r\ncommitted to carrying out all reforms and taking all \r\nof the measures required to continue successfully on \r\nthe path to European Union integration. This is not an \r\nalternative but a long-term choice carefully pursued \r\nover the years, and we are determined to make it happen.\r\nIn the weeks ahead, we expect a favourable \r\ndecision by the Council of Ministers of the European \r\nUnion on our bid for the status of candidate country \r\nto the European Union. That merit-based decision will \r\nconstitute another milestone in Albania’s journey to \r\nEuropean integration and will place our commitments \r\nand our responsibilities at a higher stage of the process.\r\nIn conclusion, let me assure the Assembly that \r\nAlbania remains committed to international cooperation \r\nand is determined to continue to offer its contribution to \r\nadvancing peace, freedom and security, and respect for \r\nhuman rights, fighting poverty, promoting sustainable \r\ndevelopment and prosperity, and, last but not least, \r\nprotecting the environment.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I thank the President of the Republic of \r\nAlbania for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Bujar Nishani, President of the Republic of \r\nAlbania, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Mohamed Yousef El-Magariaf, \r\nPresident of the General National Congress \r\nof Libya\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the General National \r\nCongress of Libya.\r\nMr. Mohamed Yousef El-Magariaf, President of the \r\nGeneral National Congress of Libya, was escorted \r\ninto the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the \r\nUnited Nations His Excellency Mr. Mohamed Yousef \r\nEl-Magariaf, President of the General National \r\nCongress of Libya, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly.\r\n12-52343 13\r\nA/67/PV.13\r\nthat my country is determined to pursue the perpetrators \r\nand bring them to justice. We will spare no effort to \r\nstrengthen the necessary protection for the diplomatic \r\nand consular missions and all guests and ensure the \r\nsafety of their staff and facilities. That tragic incident \r\ndoes not at all represent the feelings of the Libyan \r\npeople, who are known for their moderation, hospitality \r\nand gratitude. Perhaps the massive demonstrations \r\ncondemning that abominable crime that took place in \r\nBenghazi and other Libyan cities best represent the \r\ngenuine feelings of the Libyan people and their total \r\nrejection of all forms of violence and extremism. \r\nLibya will never become an incubator for radical \r\nextremist groups and will remain a peaceful Muslim \r\ncountry where moderation prevails. The new Libya \r\nwill be based on democracy, openness, transparency, \r\ncombating corruption and empowering women and \r\nyouth. The new Libya will be by, and for, one and all. \r\nMeanwhile, it would be remiss of me not to \r\ncondemn the campaigns against Islam and to defame \r\nthe Prophet Muhammad. Such campaigns foment hatred \r\nand aim to provoke tensions among civilizations. They \r\ngo beyond the concept of freedom of expression and \r\nopinion and require that the General Assembly adopt \r\na legal document to criminalize the defamation of all \r\nreligious symbols and figures. We Muslims have an \r\nabsolute belief in the unity of humankind and solidarity \r\namong all human beings. We express our support for \r\nthe dialogue among religions and for cooperation, \r\ntolerance and eternal humanitarianumanitarian values \r\nand ideals. My country therefore supports all efforts \r\ncarried out within the framework of the dialogue among \r\ncivilizations, cultures and religions under the United \r\nNations and relevant international organizations.\r\nSince the revolution of 17 of February 2011, Libya \r\nhas witnessed many changes due to the uprising of its \r\npeople against social injustice and political tyranny. It \r\nhas not only achieved a change of the tyrant regime but \r\nhas progressed towards a genuine democratic regime \r\nbased on respect for and promotion of human rights, \r\npolitical pluralism and peaceful transfer of power, as \r\nwell as on commitment to the principles and provisions \r\nof international law and the Charter of the United \r\nNations.\r\nThe Assembly may have followed the sequential \r\npolitical developments that Libya experienced during \r\nthe past few months along the path to democratization. \r\nThose include the rebuilding of State institutions; \r\n1970 (2011) and 1973 (2011) to protect the innocent \r\npeople in Libya from crimes against humanity and \r\nviolations of human rights.\r\nI stand before the Assembly today representing \r\nthe Libyan people, who are building the institutions \r\nof democracy after the fall of dictatorship. The whole \r\nworld has witnessed the first free, transparent elections \r\nin Libya, when the General National Congress was \r\nelected and I was honoured to be elected as its President. \r\nThe world, through the United Nations, has given us \r\ncomplete, genuine support for that achievement.\r\nIn our revolution of freedom and in the challenge \r\nof establishing democracy, the conscience of the world \r\nwas with us, both in deeds and in thoughts. Support was \r\noffered from everybody and from everywhere.\r\nAmong those offering help was Ambassador Chris \r\nStevens, a voice of reason and conscience, a man of \r\nlove and a messenger of friendship, who came to Libya \r\nafter the outbreak of the revolution for freedom. He \r\ntouched people’s emotions in Benghazi and travelled \r\nfrom Tripoli to the western mountains and back and \r\nall across Libya. Chris Stevens spoke with everyone \r\nin Arabic; he always smiled and showed the utmost \r\nconcern. This humane diplomat has found his place in \r\nthe consciousness and emotions of the Libyan people. \r\nIt was a day of sadness throughout Libya when he was \r\nassassinated, along with three of his aides. We would \r\nlike to express our deepest condolences to the friendly \r\nAmerican people for the grave loss. It was a loss for \r\nLibya as it was a loss for the United States of America.\r\nWe assure the Government and the people of the \r\nUnited States that this tragedy will only increase our \r\nsolidarity to entrench the hopes and objectives in \r\nwhich Ambassador Chris Stevens believed. We will \r\ndefeat the schemes of the backward terrorists, who \r\ndo not represent Libya or Islam. Islam is a religion of \r\ntolerance, peace and love. As President Obama said \r\nfrom this rostrum two days ago, “our future will be \r\ndetermined by people like Chris Stevens, and not by \r\nhis killers” (A/67/PV.6, p.11). \r\nIn that context, I would like to express my \r\ncondolences to the Libyan people, particularly the \r\npeople of Misrata, on the death of Imran Juma Shaban, \r\nwho joined the long list of martyrs some five days ago.\r\nI would like to express our profound appreciation \r\nfor the understanding shown by the United States \r\nAdministration following that incident, and to assure it \r\n14 12-52343\r\nA/67/PV.13\r\nthe oppressed towards extremism or a certain agenda \r\nincompatible with peace and security, an agenda that \r\npromoted violence and terror to achieve its objectives?\r\nDemocracy did not prevail in France a year, or even \r\na decade, after the French Revolution. That pattern has \r\nbeen repeated in other States that have gained their \r\nfreedom. A period of liberation was followed by stages \r\nof instability and a sometimes long and bloody civil \r\nwar before those States were able to achieve stability \r\nand security and to build their democratic institutions.\r\nAt the current stage of building the new Libya, we \r\nare facing extremely serious challenges that threaten \r\nnational and regional security. Some are a result of \r\nillegal activities by the sons of Al-Qadhafi and certain \r\nelements of the former regime who are being sought \r\nto face justice but have unfortunately found refuge in \r\nneighbouring countries and some other countries from \r\nwhere they carry out criminal activities that threaten \r\nsecurity and stability in Libya.\r\nBut we in Libya also face other security \r\nthreats — trafficking in drugs and psychotropic \r\nsubstances, illegal immigration and smuggling and \r\ntrafficking of weapons. As the Assembly knows, the \r\nnature and scope of such threats to national and border \r\nsecurity require a bilateral and multilateral response that \r\npromotes and strengthens national efforts. Therefore, \r\nlast March my country hosted the Regional Ministerial \r\nConference on Border Security in the North African \r\nand Sahelian Region, which resulted in the adoption \r\nof the Tripoli plan of action. The plan establishes \r\ncommon mechanisms and structures for cooperation \r\nand exchange of information, consultations, experience \r\nand communications on border security.\r\nAmong our national priorities is Libya’s right \r\nto restitution of moneys that were pillaged from the \r\nState treasury and secreted outside the country. Those \r\nfunds have been used to finance criminal activities \r\nand operations in order to destabilize the country and \r\nthreaten its national security. That has had an impact \r\nupon neighbouring countries as well. We therefore call \r\non all our friends and on States to allow us to recover \r\nLibyan moneys, investments and property located in \r\nother countries, particularly in some countries in Africa, \r\nLatin America and Asia, where those funds have been \r\nsubject to coercive measures by some Governments.\r\nIn that context, we call upon all States of the \r\nworld to cooperate in combating corruption and \r\nmoney laundering. We call upon financial institutions, \r\nthe election of the General National Congress, which \r\nwill, through a constituent committee, draft Libya’s \r\npermanent constitution; and the formation of the \r\nfirst interim Government following elections that \r\nwere commended by international observers as fair, \r\ndemocratic and transparent. \r\nWe shall work to rebuild, reorganize and reform \r\nState institutions, primarily the police, the national army \r\nand the judiciary. Various programmes and plans are \r\nbeing implemented towards disarming, demobilizing \r\nand reintegrating the former revolutionaries within \r\nthe ministries of defense and interior and other State \r\ninstitutions.\r\nFor the first time since independence, political \r\nparties have emerged on the political stage, as have \r\nfreedom of the press and expression, unconditional \r\nfreedom to demonstrate, freedom of assembly and \r\nfreedom to establish civil institutions, trade unions and \r\nintellectual, political and social organizations without \r\nrestrictions. That has led to free dialogue and the active \r\nparticipation of all segments of the people throughout \r\nthe country.\r\nFor four decades, the former regime flagrantly \r\nviolated human rights through torture, detention \r\nwithout trial, extrajudicial killing, forced disappearance \r\nand ill-treatment of citizens and violations of their \r\ndignity. The outbreak of the 17 February revolution \r\nin the form of peaceful protest was confronted by the \r\nsecurity brigades of the former regime with bullets and \r\nbrutal repression, in f lagrant violation of international \r\nhumanitarian law and human rights law. \r\nThe Human Rights Council decided to suspend \r\nLibya’s membership in the Council and formed an \r\ninternational fact-finding committee that voiced \r\nthe condemnation of the international community \r\nof such violations. The Council certified violations \r\nof human rights by the regime’s forces and by some \r\nrevolutionaries, which has required the new Libyan \r\nauthorities to give the human rights file particular \r\nattention and to take many specific measures.\r\nSome may wonder whether the Arab Spring was \r\nworthy of support. To them I say, would it have been \r\nbetter for the corrupt, dictatorial regimes to continue \r\nfor decades more with their practices of tyranny, \r\noppression, injustice, arbitrary treatment, corruption, \r\nexploitation, and violations of the most basic human \r\nrights? Should they have been allowed to continue \r\npillaging the wealth of their peoples, pushing some of \r\n12-52343 15\r\nA/67/PV.13\r\nas well as the establishment of the independent State \r\nof Palestine with Al-Quds as its capital, in accordance \r\nwith the relevant international resolutions.\r\nThe suffering of the brotherly Syrian people \r\nis unimaginable. The regime in power is violently \r\nrepressing its citizens, shedding their blood and \r\nattacking their dignity, and has thus lost its legitimacy. \r\nIn order to put an end to such a tragedy, Libya urges \r\nthe Security Council to act promptly, in accordance \r\nwith the principle of the responsibility to protect, \r\nto take immediate action to end all forms of murder, \r\nviolence and destruction, find a way out of the crisis \r\nthrough a peaceful transition of power, and fulfil the \r\nlegitimate demands of the Syrian people. This can be \r\nachieved only through consensus among members of \r\nthe Security Council and support for the efforts of the \r\nJoint Special Representative of the United Nations and \r\nthe League of Arab States, Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi.\r\nLibya condemns the social and political injustice, \r\nharassment and killings being inflicted on the Muslim \r\nminority in Myanmar on the basis of ethnicity and \r\nreligion. That is a f lagrant violation of human rights \r\nand constitutes crimes against humanity. We call on \r\nall relevant human rights institutions to immediately \r\nintervene and put an end to the tragedy. We underline \r\nthe necessity of forming an international committee of \r\ninquiry to identify those responsible for such violence \r\nand killings, bring the perpetrators to justice and \r\nensure that victims are duly compensated and refugees \r\nreturned safely to their homes.\r\nStates Members of the United Nations have \r\nconvened every year at the General Assembly ever since \r\nthe Organization was established in order to reflect \r\non the purposes and principles set out in its Charter. \r\nWe have achieved much, but many challenges remain, \r\nsuch as reforming the United Nations, eliminating \r\nweapons of mass destruction, reducing poverty, \r\nignorance and disease and wars and armed conflicts, \r\nfighting terrorism and organized crime, protecting \r\nthe environment, achieving sustainable development, \r\nrespecting human rights, in particular the rights of \r\nwomen, and ensuring the rule of law and combating \r\nracism, hatred and fanaticism.\r\nLibya wishes to stress its affi nity with Africa and the \r\nimportance of shifting its policies towards, and relations \r\nwith, Africa and the world — which were once based \r\non personal whims and acts of extortion — to policies \r\nand relations firmly grounded in the best interests of \r\nparticularly those located in Western countries and \r\nsome island States, to shoulder their responsibilities \r\nand not accept suspicious funds, particularly from \r\nThird World dictators who are bleeding the wealth of \r\ntheir peoples and hiding those funds under fictitious \r\ncompany names.\r\nIn March 2010, Global Financial Integrity issued \r\na report estimating that the gross offshore deposits \r\nwere $10 trillion. We look forward to the signing and \r\nratification of an anti-corruption convention by 130 \r\nStates. We believe that that would promote cooperation \r\namong States to combat corruption and bring about the \r\nrestitution of stolen funds. \r\nI would now like to pay tribute to the great \r\ncontribution made by the United Nations Support \r\nMission in Libya, previously headed by Mr. Ian Martin, \r\ndespite the many challenges and difficulties that were \r\nnatural and to be expected in the transitional phase. \r\nWe also welcome the appointment of Mr. Tarek Mitri \r\nas the new head of the Mission. We wish him every \r\nsuccess and look forward to further cooperation. We \r\nare committed to providing all the necessary assistance \r\nto him and the Mission.\r\nThe new Libya undertakes to respect all of its \r\ncommitments contained in the international instruments \r\nand covenants on disarmament and the maintenance \r\nof international peace and security. We are fully \r\nprepared to cooperate transparently and sincerely with \r\nthe international community to support efforts, both \r\nregional and international, to implement the provisions \r\nof international conventions and protocols and to \r\ncreate an international environment that would foster \r\nprogress towards definitively eliminating weapons of \r\nmass destruction. We are also determined to review \r\nall other international instruments to which we are not \r\nyet party and take the appropriate decisions thereon as \r\nsoon as the permanent constitution is adopted and a \r\nGovernment and parliament are elected. \r\nWe condemn Israel’s measures designed to Judaize \r\noccupied lands and its violations of human rights and \r\ninternational humanitarian law. The international \r\ncommunity must assume its responsibilities by taking \r\nstrong, urgent measures to put an end to Israeli \r\naggression and ensure the full protection of Palestinians. \r\nIt must come up with a radical solution to the question \r\nof Palestine through a just and lasting settlement that \r\nincludes Israel’s withdrawal from all occupied lands \r\nand the return of all Palestinian refugees to their homes, \r\n16 12-52343\r\nA/67/PV.13\r\nall peoples. The new Libya dissociates itself from the \r\nrepugnant past and extends its hands in freedom and \r\nfriendship to build new relationships based on mutual \r\nrespect and fruitful cooperation.\r\nIn conclusion, let me wish the General Assembly \r\nat its sixty-seventh session full success in solving the \r\nissues on its agenda. I express the hope that a spirit of \r\nsolidarity and cooperation will prevail so that we may \r\ncreate a better world, one blessed with security and \r\nstability.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I thank the President of the General National \r\nCongress of Libya for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Mohamed Yousef El-Magariaf, President of the \r\nGeneral National Congress of Libya, was escorted \r\nfrom the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mr. Thérence Sinunguruza, \r\nVice-President of the Republic of Burundi\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Vice-President of the Republic \r\nof Burundi.\r\nMr. Thérence Sinunguruza, Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of Burundi, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Thérence Sinunguruza, \r\nVice-President of the Republic of Burundi, and inviting \r\nhim to address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Sinunguruza (Burundi) (spoke in French): It \r\nis a great pleasure for me to address the representatives \r\nhere today and to express my congratulations to Mr. Vuk \r\nJeremić on his election as President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-seventh session, and to his cabinet \r\nas well. I also thank his predecessor, Ambassador Nassir \r\nAbdulaziz Al-Nasser, for his excellent work during \r\nhis presidency. In addition, I extend my appreciation \r\nto Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his work for \r\nthe good and well-being of Member States and their \r\npeoples.\r\nIt is an honour and a pleasure for me to speak from \r\nthis rostrum about current issues of great importance \r\nto my country and the world. It is a pleasure especially \r\nbecause Burundi is right now at a decisive and historic \r\nturning point. What I have to say Pierre Nkurunziza, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Burundi, also spoke of last \r\nyear at the Assembly’s sixty-sixth session. A major turn \r\nof events has placed a special stamp on our country’s \r\nhistory since independence. Democratically elected \r\ninstitutions now serve out the terms entrusted to them \r\nby the people in peace, and then, at the end of their \r\ntenure, give way to others, also democratically elected. \r\nOver two years ago, in 2010, Burundi organized \r\ndemocratic elections for the second time since \r\n2005, from which were born our current republican \r\ninstitutions, which operate with legitimacy in a restored \r\nclimate of peace and security. That development gives us \r\ngreat satisfaction, and the Burundian people have every \r\nreason to be proud of it. Indeed, whereas my country \r\nfaced crises on multiple fronts, under which the people \r\nsuffered economic depletion, social degradation and \r\npolitical discord, seriously demoralizing them, those \r\nsame people are now steadily getting back on their feet \r\nand rediscovering hope as they look to the future. That \r\npositive trend demonstrates conclusively a complete \r\nbreak with the spirals of violence and instability that \r\nhave for decades been our ongoing lot. \r\nThanks to the collective efforts, strength and spirit \r\nof the Burundian people, as well as to the support of our \r\npartners, I can confirm here and now that the policies \r\nbegun in 2005 and carried on after 2010 have produced \r\nmost encouraging results in many areas. As I said earlier, \r\nin the political sphere our country has held democratic \r\nelections twice in the recent past, in 2005 and 2010. We \r\nhave established democratic institutions — the executive \r\nbranch, the National Assembly and the Senate — all \r\nof which are representative of the various elements \r\nof Burundi’s population, in conformity with the \r\nethnic and gender balances agreed to in the Arusha \r\nPeace and Reconciliation Agreement, which have \r\nbeen incorporated into the Constitution governing \r\nBurundians today. I take pleasure in pointing out that \r\nour Senate’s composition shows a gender parity such \r\nthat out of all senates worldwide Burundi’s places \r\nsecond in women’s representation. That is clearly a \r\nsignificant and bold step forward, because, rather than \r\nsettle for the minimum set out in the Constitution, our \r\nGovernment voluntarily made the deliberate choice to \r\ngo further, to ensure that the female majority in the \r\npopulation is represented meaningfully in the country’s \r\ninstitutions.\r\nIn its determined drive towards change, the \r\nGovernment subsequently established an independent \r\n12-52343 17\r\nA/67/PV.13\r\nnational commission on human rights and an \r\nombudsman’s office. It initiated a zero-tolerance policy \r\ndesigned to eradicate corruption and misuse of public \r\nfunds, a scourge that has ravaged Burundian society \r\nfor several years, and also set up adequate enforcement \r\nmechanisms. We still have a way to go, as is the case \r\nin many other countries, but the structures to get there \r\nare firmly in place. In October 2011 the Government \r\nadopted a national good governance and anti-corruption \r\nstrategy for 2011-2015. Also, Government officials, \r\nincluding those at high levels, have signed performance \r\ncontracts, laying the groundwork for a culture of \r\naccountability, which is essential to democratic \r\nsystems. The members of the Administration and \r\nhigh-level officials are periodically evaluated based on \r\nthose contracts. If they live up to agreed performance \r\nstandards they are retained, but otherwise they are \r\nreplaced.\r\nThe Arusha Peace and Reconciliation Agreement \r\ncalls for transitional justice mechanisms. We are \r\nworking towards a transitional justice system \r\nthat carefully and rigorously balances national \r\nreconciliation requirements and those of justice. We \r\nneed a mechanism that banishes the demons of the \r\npast and at the same time affords no opportunity for \r\nany type of vengeance or the settling of old scores; in \r\nother words, a mechanism to establish the truth and \r\nto ensure that there is no recurrence of the acts in \r\nquestion. National consultations were held in 2009, and \r\nthe related report has been made public. A technical \r\ncommittee was established with a mandate to pave the \r\nway for a truth and reconciliation commission. That \r\ncommittee proposed a methodology in its final report, \r\nwhich was submitted through the proper channels in \r\nOctober 2011. The Government had hoped to establish \r\nthe commission in January 2012, but that decision had \r\nto be postponed for technical reasons owing to the fact \r\nthat further consultations were required, along with \r\nspecific proposals on the commission’s mandate and \r\ncomposition, the selection criteria for its members and \r\nmatters related to its operating budget. \r\nBesides those achievements in the political sphere, \r\nthe Government undertook a vast social construction \r\nproject that yielded positive results. Measures \r\nproviding free education for children of primary school \r\nage enabled millions of little Burundians to attend \r\nschool, while free medical care for pregnant women, \r\nnursing mothers and children under five years of age \r\nsignificantly improved maternal and child health care \r\nand will help us to reach the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs) in that regard in the near future. Also, \r\nwith the participation of the population in communal \r\nlabour, 2,024 schools, 80 health centres and more than \r\n2,000 potable-water wells were built in just three years.\r\nWith respect to socioeconomic development, \r\nBurundi is continuing to improve its basic economic \r\ninfrastructure, including the management of public \r\nfinances, an improved business climate and good \r\ngovernance. In addition, significant progress has been \r\nmade with respect to the gradual and orderly return \r\nof displaced persons and the repatriation of refugees. \r\nAll those efforts have taken place within the Strategic \r\nFramework for Growth and Poverty Reduction, Vision \r\n2025 and the MDGs. Of the total of 800,000 counted \r\nin the census of 2000-2001, all have returned to our \r\ncountry with the exception of 37,000 from the Mtabila \r\ncamp, who are expected to return by 31 December. Many \r\ninternally displaced persons have already returned to \r\ntheir homes. We have just finished a profiling survey \r\nof those who remain on site, which, in the light of their \r\nexpressed wishes, will determine the most appropriate \r\nand humane resolution of their situation.\r\nThe social and economic reintegration of former \r\ncombatants has yet to be completed and represents a \r\ngenuine security risk. While it is true that there have \r\nbeen a few isolated instances of insecurity here and \r\nthere in the country, that is not unique to Burundi. \r\nBanditry, which has taken place on a small scale in \r\nBurundi, also occurs elsewhere, in many countries. \r\nThe Government is determined to stamp out all forms \r\nof criminality, including armed robbery. It considers \r\nsecurity the sine qua non of all social and economic \r\nprogress, which is why it has embarked on reforms in \r\nthat regard. The professionalization of the defence and \r\nsecurity forces and of the justice system to guarantee \r\nthe rights of both citizens and foreigners on our soil are \r\namong the measures that the Government has written \r\ninto its programme and will continue to promote as the \r\ncountry moves forward.\r\nIn the area of regional integration, an \r\nintragovernmental committee has been established to \r\ndevelop a national strategy for regional integration, with \r\nthe goal of enabling Burundi to take best advantage of \r\nits participation in subregional entities and reducing the \r\ndeficits and disadvantages that stem from belonging to \r\nnon-regional organizations. \r\nThe Strategic Framework for Growth and Poverty \r\nReduction has reached an advanced stage. The \r\n18 12-52343\r\nA/67/PV.13\r\nnot least of them the maintenance of economic growth. \r\nDespite the unfavourable international financial and \r\neconomic context, Burundi, with the support of its \r\npartners, must keep its head above water. It must increase \r\nits economic growth with the aim of implementing \r\nits economic and social development projects. It \r\ngoes without saying that lack of growth, along with \r\npoverty, means fewer schools, fewer hospitals and \r\nless progress in the areas of energy and transportation \r\ninfrastructure — in short, less development for the \r\ncountry and its people. No leader worthy of the title \r\nwould bequeath such a disastrous economic situation to \r\nfuture generations.\r\nThat is why, despite the troubling international \r\neconomic outlook, guidance and support are more \r\nthan ever necessary for economies as weak as ours in \r\nBurundi. However sustainable it may be at the national \r\nlevel, our economy is still very much dependent on \r\nthe global economy. I remain convinced that, with the \r\nwill, commitment and vigour of the people of Burundi, \r\nsupported by our friends, the scale of our political and \r\nsocioeconomic gains will continue to expand. For its \r\npart, the Government will spare no effort to harness, \r\ncoordinate and collaborate with the efforts of all parties \r\nto fight hand in hand for people’s well-being and \r\nprosperity, in Burundi and around the world.\r\nI would like to conclude by welcoming the actions \r\ntaken by the United Nations, which over the 67 years of \r\nits existence has moved the world forward at an ever-\r\naccelerating pace. I would also like to see the institutional \r\nchanges envisaged for the Organization take the \r\ninterests of all Member States into consideration, with \r\nall stakeholders taking part in the reform and updating \r\nof the system..\r\nFinally, I wish the President of the General \r\nAssembly every success throughout his term of office.\r\nLong live international cooperation! Long live the \r\nUnited Nations! Long live Burundi!\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of Burundi for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Thérence Sinunguruza, Vice-President of \r\nthe Republic of Burundi, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum.\r\nGovernment and the Вurundi configuration of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission have made visible progress \r\nin a number of areas, as indicated in the outcome of the \r\nfifth review of the Peacebuilding Commission, issued \r\non 26 April 2011. Positive results were noted in the areas \r\nof political and institutional peacebuilding issues, good \r\ngovernance, human rights, economic issues, vulnerable \r\ngroups and regional integration, as described earlier.\r\nAfter this brief survey of the internal situation of \r\nmy country, I now turn to Burundi’s role and position \r\nregarding certain international matters. With respect \r\nto Burundi’s participation in peacekeeping operations, \r\nI would like to say that Burundi was one of the two \r\ncountries to take part in the African Union Mission in \r\nSomalia, and that it is pleased with the work accomplished \r\nby its soldiers in that context. As the Secretary-General \r\nhas already done, my country commends the adoption, \r\nin August, of the provisional Constitution of Somalia \r\nby the National Constituent Assembly in Mogadishu. \r\nIt congratulates and encourages the Somali delegates \r\nand leaders with respect to the new developments under \r\nway, aimed at normalizing that country’s situation, and \r\nto their commitment to ending the transition period and \r\nestablishing new political institutions that represent \r\nall Somalis. Burundi stands ready to share with the \r\nSomalis our experience on the question of national \r\nreconciliation and in training a national republican \r\narmy.\r\nWith respect to the security situation in the \r\neastern part of the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo, Burundi, along with the other members of the \r\nInternational Conference on the Great Lakes Region, \r\nconfirms its strong commitment to the terms of the \r\npact of 15 December 2006 and to its related protocols \r\nguaranteeing security, stability and development. We \r\nare also a signatory to the declarations agreed by the \r\nheads of State and Government of the member States \r\nof that organization in Addis Ababa on 15 July, and in \r\nKampala on 7 and 8 August and 7 and 8 September. \r\nAlong with the other countries of the region, Burundi \r\nremains determined to seek solutions to that conflict \r\nthrough existing regional arrangements and in \r\naccordance with decisions already taken by the \r\ncountries of the subregion within the framework of the \r\nInternational Conference on the Great Lakes Region.\r\nThe Assembly will have noted in the course of my \r\nstatement that the Government of Burundi has made \r\nundeniable progress. Still, major challenges remain, \r\n12-52343 19\r\nA/67/PV.13\r\nof law in Somalia. More resources are needed, however, \r\nto accelerate the building of appropriate infrastructure \r\nin those parts of Somalia where stability has been \r\nestablished. We must transform fear and uncertainty \r\ninto hope and optimism in Somalia itself, as well as in \r\nthe Indian Ocean.\r\nSeychelles has committed itself to ending the \r\nimpunity associated with piracy. Piracy has become a \r\nglobal business, operated by a transnational criminal \r\nnetwork. Seychelles, in partnership with the Government \r\nof the United Kingdom and other international parties, \r\nis in the process of setting up a regional anti-piracy \r\nprosecution and intelligence centre. The success of \r\nthis initiative will depend on strong international \r\ncooperation. We count on all our partners to work with \r\nus to ensure a true long-term solution for this issue.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nThe Indian Ocean Commission, which Seychelles \r\nis currently chairing, recognizes the work of the \r\nUnited Nations in favour of peace, democracy and \r\nhuman rights, in the interests of the people of its five \r\nmember States. The crisis facing Madagascar is truly \r\ntesting the country. It is plunging the population into \r\ngreat economic and social difficulties, and is affecting \r\nthe entire region. The Seychelles presidency of the \r\nCommission continues supporting the implementation \r\nof the road map developed by the Southern African \r\nDevelopment Community (SADC). In that context, it \r\norganized two meetings between Marc Ravalomanana, \r\nthe former President, and Andry Nirina Rajoelina, \r\nPresident of the Transition, in Seychelles, with the \r\ndual mediation of Presidents James Michel and Jacob \r\nZuma, head of the SADC troika. Those talks, convened \r\nat the recommendation of the most recent SADC \r\nSummit, enable us today to look forward to useful and \r\nrelevant actions for a return to constitutional order in \r\nMadagascar, in keeping with the electoral timetable \r\ndrawn up by the United Nations and Madagascar’s \r\nIndependent National Electoral Commission.\r\nIn that regard, we should like to express our thanks \r\nto the transitional Government, which has confirmed \r\nits contribution to the financing of the elections, in \r\naccordance with the recommendations of the United \r\nNations. This is also the time to call on all international \r\npartners to help ensure fair, transparent and equitable \r\nelections in that country, which is anxious to regain \r\nits place on the international stage. Through elections \r\nMadagascar will return to the rule of law, and it is \r\nAddress by Mr. Danny Faure, Vice-President of \r\nthe Republic of Seychelles\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an addresss by the Vice-President of the Republic \r\nof Seychelles.\r\nMr. Danny Faure, Vice-President of the Republic \r\nof Seychelles, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure \r\nin welcoming His Excellency Mr. Danny Faure, \r\nVice-President of the Republic of Seychelles, and \r\ninviting him to address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Faure (Seychelles): In the modern world, the \r\npace of change, whether political, social or economic, \r\nchallenges our ability to react in a constructive, \r\nsustainable and just manner. And in the face of change, \r\nthe role of the General Assembly becomes even more \r\nimportant, as the President of the General Assembly \r\nhas reminded us. We look to the United Nations — our \r\nUnited Nations and our General Assembly — to help \r\nus find the common ground needed for the resolution \r\nof the big questions of our time. We can truly be a \r\n“G-193”, as our President has previously remarked.\r\nAs an oceanic island nation, Seychelles understands \r\nintrinsically that the development of our region depends \r\nupon being able to defuse conflict and tension through \r\ndiplomacy and on defining a framework to properly \r\nshare all the opportunities that our ocean offers us. In \r\nthe Indian Ocean, we are particularly concerned with \r\ntwo issues that challenge the proper application of \r\nthe rule of law in a sustainable manner: the continued \r\nproblem of maritime piracy and the resolution of the \r\npolitical crisis in Madagascar.\r\nPiracy fundamentally alters our relationship with \r\nour ocean. Piracy instils fear and uncertainty. We have \r\ntwo compatriots still being held captive in Somalia, and, \r\nas long as they remain separated from their families, \r\nour ocean represents risk for our nation, rather than \r\nthe opportunity that it should. Establishing the rule of \r\nlaw in Somalia is obviously the only true long-term and \r\nsustainable solution to piracy. We welcome the moves \r\nin Somalia and by the international community to \r\nstrengthen those efforts.\r\nSeychelles is already working with the central \r\nGovernment of Somalia, as well as the regions of \r\nSomaliland and Puntland, to be able to transfer \r\nprosecuted prisoners to serve their sentences in their \r\ncountry of origin. This is a key part of building the rule \r\n20 12-52343\r\nA/67/PV.13\r\nus. The United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment has given new momentum to the concept \r\nof the blue economy.\r\nWe are also very aware that the ocean will always \r\nbe a shared space. As an archipelago, we are privileged \r\nto be custodians of that space. This year, for the first \r\ntime in the history of the United Nations, Seychelles \r\nand Mauritius, two neighbouring SIDS, have agreed on \r\njoint management of an area of extended continental \r\nshelf of 3,000 square kilometres. That means that we \r\nare sharing the space for the benefit of our two peoples’ \r\ndevelopment. We are sharing the responsibility and the \r\nopportunity. We believe that all nations, large or small, \r\nmust contribute to making this planet a better world to \r\nlive in.\r\nSeychelles recently announced its intention to stand \r\nfor a non-permanent seat on the Security Council in the \r\nyear 2017, subject to endorsement by the African Union. \r\nWe are doing so because we believe that the voices of \r\nall nations matter, whether they are large or small, rich \r\nor poor. As the smallest African nation, we keenly \r\nunderstand that we need to fight for Africa’s economic \r\nindependence. We are committed to the ideals of the \r\nAfrican Union, on the basis of which we attained our \r\npolitical freedom. Now more than ever we must invest \r\nin Africa’s economic freedom. We must create the \r\nmeans by which Africa’s share of trade and financial \r\npower can increase at a faster rate. We must empower \r\nAfrican institutions. Seychelles adds its voice to the call \r\nfor more investment in the African Development Bank, \r\nincluding by African nations themselves, by investing \r\ntheir reserves in it.\r\nWe must also foster peace on our continent by \r\nleading efforts to find solutions to our problems, \r\nsuch as in Somalia, Madagascar and elsewhere in \r\nAfrica. As a small island developing State, we have a \r\ngreater understanding than ever of the ways in which \r\nour planet is under threat from climate change, and \r\nof the need to act now for the sake of all humankind. \r\nMost of all, as citizens of planet Earth, we understand \r\nthat as individuals and as a nation our decisions \r\nhave consequences beyond our borders. They have \r\nconsequences for our future and for our children. These \r\nare all issues that must be weighed carefully, and it is \r\nimportant that all voices be considered in the debate. \r\nWe thank the Assembly for giving due consideration to \r\nthe voice of Seychelles.\r\nthrough the rule of law in Madagascar that we will \r\nbe able to depend on sustainable development in the \r\nIndian Ocean.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nRespect for the rule of law is also about ensuring \r\nthat conditions are in place for equity and fairness in the \r\ninternational system as a whole. Small island developing \r\nStates (SIDS) are too often on the periphery of most \r\ninternational decision-making bodies. Seychelles is \r\nproposing that SIDS be considered as offering unique \r\nopportunities for testing innovative policies and \r\ntechnologies that can benefit all humankind. In the \r\nfight against climate change, SIDS could be at the \r\nforefront of groundbreaking solutions.\r\nFor example, the Global Island Partnership, \r\nco-chaired by Seychelles, Palau and Grenada, has \r\nproposed considering debt cancellation for SIDS \r\nto enable them to better prepare for climate change \r\nadaptation. A large number of SIDS have debt-to-\r\ngross-domestic-product ratios in excess of 100 per \r\ncent, and such debt forgiveness would give them more \r\nf lexibility within their own budgets to prepare to face \r\nclimate change, and thus protect some of the most \r\nenvironmentally sensitive zones on the planet.\r\nWith regard to the high volatility of international \r\nfuel prices, SIDS can strengthen their resilience through \r\ninvestment in renewable energy. We warmly welcome \r\nthe Sustainable Energy for All initiative championed \r\nby the Secretary-General, and we commit our support \r\nto making it a success. While the latest technology in \r\nrenewable energy often represents a significant capital \r\noutlay, by developing pilot projects in SIDS we can \r\npotentially create economies based on 100 per cent \r\nrenewable energy that can then be replicated on a larger \r\nscale.\r\nFinally, it is very important that consideration \r\nbe given to how to better support SIDS within the \r\ninternational trading system. Trade-based support for \r\nSIDS could easily be established without disruption \r\nor distortion of the global f low of goods and services. \r\nIslands are particularly reliant on open access to trade \r\nwith as many countries as possible. In the context of \r\nthe current challenges to food security, we urge that \r\nall barriers affecting trade with islands, including the \r\neconomic embargo on Cuba, be lifted, since they serve \r\nonly to increase the inherent challenges associated with \r\ntrading from a position of insularity. As an island State, \r\nwe are aware that the ocean must connect us, not divide \r\n12-52343 21\r\nA/67/PV.13\r\nand laudable human experiences that f lourished in our \r\nglorious land.\r\nOur renewed ambition to build a modern State \r\nwhere the Iraqi people enjoy freedom, development \r\nand prosperity requires us to move towards the \r\nestablishment of good, friendly and equal relations \r\nwith all nations in the world, within the framework of \r\na cooperative international system governed by clear \r\nrules that prevent the problems and crises that could \r\nundermine its prosperity and stability. The new Iraq \r\nhas chosen to embark on the path of cooperation and \r\ncoordination with the international community in the \r\npolitical, economic and development spheres. Those \r\nefforts have been coupled with significant qualitative \r\nleaps in our economic growth that will qualify Iraq to \r\nreturn to the realm of the world economy and to emerge \r\nwithin the international economic system, based on a \r\nrealistic vision that has achieved a number of positive \r\ndevelopments over recent years.\r\nAccording to various indicators, our gross \r\ndomestic product (GDP) has doubled, which has in turn \r\ndoubled the per capita share of the GDP. According to \r\nprojections by the International Monetary Fund, Iraq’s \r\nGDP is expected to reach approximately $150 billion \r\nin 2014. The Iraqi Government has also succeeded in \r\nimplementing policies to curb inflation and to control \r\ngovernmental spending, in addition to our success in \r\ncollaborating with the international community to \r\nreduce the debt accumulated by the country over past \r\ndecades.\r\nWe have embraced a theory of balanced growth in \r\nour national development plans for the upcoming years, \r\nin which the oil sector is to serve as the engine for \r\nother sectors. Iraq has oil reserves amounting to about \r\n143 billion barrels and potential reserves surpassing \r\nthe current estimated proven reserves, in addition to \r\nlarge reserves of natural gas amounting to 126.7 trillion \r\ncubic feet. We expect investments to contribute to \r\nsubstantial development in the oil industry in Iraq \r\nthrough licensing rounds, establishing refineries \r\nand other oil- and gas-related sectors and industries. \r\nEstimates suggest that from 2017 to 2020 production \r\nwill reach more than 10 million barrels of oil per day. \r\nThe development plan will include all sectors and \r\ninfrastructure in order to provide secure and promising \r\ninvestment opportunities. The Iraqi Government has \r\nprepared legislation to promote confidence in the Iraqi \r\neconomy by providing legal protection for foreign \r\ninvestments in Iraq through the guarantees listed in the \r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of Seychelles for the statement he has just \r\nmade.\r\nMr. Danny Faure, Vice-President of the Republic \r\nof Seychelles, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Khudayr al-Khuzai, \r\nVice-President of the Republic of Iraq\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Vice-President of the Republic \r\nof Iraq.\r\nMr. Khudayr al-Khuzai, Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of Iraq, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Khudayr al-Khuzai, \r\nVice-President of the Republic of Iraq, and inviting him \r\nto address the Assembly.\r\n Mr. Al-Khuzai (Iraq) (spoke in Arabic): I stand \r\nhere today in order to convey to the General Assembly \r\nthe sincere regards and best wishes of the people of \r\nIraq, who wish to share in forging closer bonds of \r\namity and cooperation between peoples and countries, \r\nat a time when my country is undergoing a structural \r\ntransformation at every level, a process that will enable \r\nit to reform itself, achieve its goals and consolidate its \r\ngains.\r\nWe are building a future through the conscious \r\nunderstanding of our history as the cradle of civilization \r\nand where the earliest writing system and codifi cation of \r\nlaws were born. Iraq has been successful in establishing \r\na democratic, pluralistic and federalist State on the basis \r\nof an enlightened Constitution, drafted by our people’s \r\nrepresentatives and voted on by our people.\r\nOur Constitution lays out the aspirations of our \r\npeople to a free and decent life based on freedom, \r\ndemocracy and the peaceful transfer of authority, \r\ncitizenship and human rights. Iraq has regained its \r\nsecurity, political and economic health in record time \r\nand under extremely difficult conditions, where the \r\nforces of darkness had been betting that terrorism would \r\nderail the experiment. However, thanks to God and the \r\npatriotic vigour and self-awareness of our nation, our \r\npeople were able to turn the page. Our efforts are based \r\non a cultural history of about 10,000 years and on a \r\ngreat human legacy created by the heavenly messages \r\n22 12-52343\r\nA/67/PV.13\r\nwhich only leads to more violence, bloodshed and loss \r\nof life. The situation is endangering the social fabric \r\nof the Syrian people and may lead to fragmentation \r\nand disintegration of that people, whom we cherish and \r\nwhose unity and sovereignty we care about.\r\nWe also realize that the facts on the ground suggest \r\nthat regional and international intervention could \r\nadversely impact the Syrian issue and might cause \r\nunlimited chaos and devastation that would spare no \r\none, including the interveners. We therefore sincerely \r\ncall for dialogue and a peaceful solution as the only \r\nmeans to end a crisis that could engulf the whole region \r\nand exacerbate the current situation.\r\nThe events in Syria have demonstrated that \r\nresolving the crisis through violence and force could \r\ndouble the costs incurred by the Syrians and the region, \r\nfor such means only increase the suffering of civilians, \r\ndestroy infrastructure and multiply the number of \r\ndisplaced persons and refugees. That is why we hope \r\nthat all the parties to the conflict understand that the \r\nmilitary solution alone is a dangerous move and gamble. \r\nFrom this rostrum, we call upon kings, presidents and \r\nother heads of State here today at this humanitarian \r\ngathering to support reconciliation and dialogue among \r\nall Syrians and endorse the United Nations and Arab \r\nLeague initiative promoted by Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi \r\nafter the noble efforts of Mr. Kofi Annan reached at an \r\nimpasse.\r\nIn that regard, we do not hide our concern about \r\nthe consequences of the ongoing crisis, which could \r\nonly worsen if sectarian and ethnic strife is triggered. \r\nThat, in turn, could lead the region and its peoples into \r\na spiral of fighting with no end on the horizon. Such \r\na prospect makes it incumbent upon us on us to try in \r\nearnest to contain and peacefully resolve the crisis, \r\nwhile preserving the interests of the Syrian people and \r\npreventing further deterioration of the situation.\r\nIraq’s initiative aimed at resolving the Syrian crisis \r\ncontinues to stand as a beacon of peace, as we search \r\nfor an exit acceptable to all the forces of good. Our \r\ninitiative is based on the following two points. First, \r\nIraq has a keen desire to see Syria remain intact as a \r\nState, and we support the hopes and aspirations of the \r\nSyrian people for a free and dignified life. Secondly, \r\nIraq is concerned at the possible repercussions of the \r\nviolence and destruction caused by Syria’s internal \r\nwar and sectarian strife, which we fear could have a \r\nspillover effect.\r\ninvestment law itself and through Iraq’s accession to \r\nthe Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency in 2007 \r\nand through bilateral treaties to guarantee and protect \r\ninvestments.\r\nWe were able to establish solid foundations for \r\npolitical conduct, which has matured rapidly as our \r\npeople have grown to accept those unlike themselves \r\nand to live according to the principle of citizenship, \r\nthe rule of law, the independence of the judiciary and \r\nthe freedom of expression. We proudly announce that, \r\nowing to our freedom of opinion and expression, we \r\ndo not have a single prisoner jailed for his beliefs or \r\nopinions. In our fight against terrorism, human rights \r\nremain a cherished principle that we respect and \r\npromote as a just cause. We do not have any justification \r\nto tamper with such rights.\r\nIt is true that confronting terrorism has cost Iraq a lot \r\nof blood, tears, sweat and financial resources, but that \r\nconfrontation has rewarded our people with a permanent \r\nimmunity against violence. It has also created extreme \r\nsensitivity vis-à-vis violence as a means to resolve our \r\nstrife with others. Therefore, as much as we care about \r\nsparing our people the ravages of fighting, we hope that \r\nother countries, especially neighbouring countries, will \r\nlearn from the Iraqi experience and spare their peoples \r\nunnecessary turmoil. We call upon them to adopt the \r\nprinciple of negotiation to resolve conflicts and the \r\nuse of dialogue, logic, reason, laws and the peaceful \r\ntransfer of power.\r\nThat is the essence of Iraq’s position regarding \r\nthe revolutions of the Arab Spring, which we cannot \r\ndo anything about except to be entirely on the side of \r\nthe people and their legitimate aspirations, their right \r\nto self-determination and the right to choose their own \r\nrulers. We share the concerns regarding the issues facing \r\nthe peoples and States Members of the Organization; \r\nthose concerns represent a humanitarian, legal and \r\nmoral burden, because all of us share one world, which \r\nis affected by conflicts and their aftermath.\r\nBased on that, the Syrian issue and the humanitarian \r\ndiffi culties facing civilians in that country occupy a \r\ngreat deal of our attention. We think that the escalating \r\nviolence in Syria is a reason for distress and concern, \r\nand it is incumbent upon the leaders gathered here to \r\nwork in earnest to stop the bloodshed, which claims the \r\nlives of tens and perhaps hundreds of people every day \r\nin Syria. We would like also to draw attention to the \r\ndanger of providing the fighting parties with weapons, \r\n12-52343 23\r\nA/67/PV.13\r\nbalanced and responsible spirit that characterizes Iraq’s \r\nclear position with respect to that issue. It is a position \r\nthat declares our firm support for international efforts \r\nto prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons, while \r\naffirming the right of peoples and countries to benefit \r\nfrom the peaceful use of nuclear energy.\r\nWe call upon the international community, \r\nrepresented by the United Nations and its Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, whom we highly respect \r\nand revere, to extend support to Iraq’s efforts to exit \r\nfrom the Chapter VII provisions imposed on us as a \r\nresult of the mistaken policies of the former regime \r\nfollowing Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait, especially as there \r\nis no longer any justification for such international \r\naction. Iraq is no longer a threat to anyone and has \r\nfulfilled most of its obligations, as is confirmed by \r\nthe renewal of our brotherly relations with the State \r\nof Kuwait, seen specifically in the mutual visits of \r\nhigh-level officials of our respective countries and the \r\nserious and constructive dialogue based on a sincere \r\ndesire and sustained efforts to resolve all outstanding \r\nissues between us. \r\nI would be remiss if I failed to speak of the \r\nrepulsive abuse directed at the great Prophet \r\nMuhammad — peace be upon him — and the wave of \r\nviolent protests that shook the Islamic world because \r\nof a ridiculous movie that attacked the image of our \r\nProphet — peace be upon him — a movie that nearly \r\ncaused relations between East and West to unravel. We \r\nneed to conduct a sincere and serious examination on \r\nhow to prevent the recurrence of such insults through \r\nan international ban that criminalizes those who insult \r\nreligions, disrespect religious symbols or insult the \r\ngreat prophets and messengers. Such actions constitute \r\na blatant aggression against everything great, holy and \r\nsacred. The recurrence of those obscene actions will \r\nsupply terrorists with prime material for recruiting \r\nangry youth for use in violent actions that threaten \r\npeace and security, which could cause many casualties, \r\nas recent events have shown. \r\nWe therefore clearly need to contain such attacks \r\nand prohibit the production and dissemination of similar \r\nprovocative materials. As nobody in the Islamic world \r\nis able to contain the consequences of such disregard \r\nfor Islamic values and their sanctity, we believe that the \r\nUnited Nations should play a central and constructive \r\nrole in this matter, with a view to preventing potentially \r\nfar-reaching and dangerous ramifications.\r\nIraq’s unwavering and well-known position does \r\nnot deviate from the Arab ranks on issues of crucial \r\nimportance to our Arab nation. We accordingly \r\nsupport the establishment of the State of Palestine in \r\nthe occupied Palestinian territories, with Jerusalem as \r\nits capital, and declare our support for the membership \r\nof the State of Palestine in the United Nations. We \r\nalso declare our unequivocal rejection of the policies \r\nof oppression, Judaization and usurpation of land \r\nthat Israel pursues without regard for international \r\ncondemnation of its unjust practices, including the use \r\nof brutal force. We also reject Israel’s disregard for the \r\nrepeated international calls to sign the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to place its \r\nmilitary arsenal and facilities under the supervision of \r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency. \r\nWe have tirelessly called for the establishment \r\nin our region of a zone without nuclear weapons. \r\nTherefore, within the international framework, we are \r\ncontributing to efforts to implement a Middle East zone \r\nfree of all weapons of mass destruction, chief among \r\nwhich are nuclear weapons. That is why we endorse the \r\npreparations for the Helsinki conference to be held this \r\nyear with a view to setting up a process that would set \r\nup such a zone. Any failure in that endeavour would \r\nlead to an arms race in a region that is in dire need of \r\npeace and stability. \r\nWe condemn and reject the discriminatory policies \r\npursued against religious and ethnic minorities in \r\nmany countries the world over. We especially condemn \r\nthe inhumane violations of the rights of Muslims in \r\nMyanmar, who face genocide. The world’s conscience \r\nshould not remain untroubled by the gravity of their \r\nplight. Such situations run counter to all the principles of \r\nhuman rights law, religious teachings and international \r\nconventions.\r\nOur good and friendly relations with our \r\nneighbours, the region and the entire world are \r\ngoverned by a balanced foreign policy based on mutual \r\nrespect, common interests and non-interference in the \r\naffairs of others. We also uphold the principles of good-\r\nneighbourliness and dialogue in our relations with the \r\nArab and Muslim worlds, as well as with the entire \r\nworld. Iraq hosted the League of Arab States Summit \r\nin March, which marked a return to our active, natural \r\nand pioneering role in joint Arab decision-making and \r\naction. That was followed by Iraq’s hosting of one of \r\nthe rounds of international negotiations on the Iranian \r\nnuclear issue, which we undertook in the objective, \r\n24 12-52343\r\nA/67/PV.13\r\naccorded to our President when he addressed the \r\nAssembly last year. He made that address at the time \r\nwhen the international community was concerned \r\nabout the viability of our new nation. In the light of \r\nthe progress we have made and despite recent events, \r\nI am pleased to address the Assembly this year under \r\nthe theme of the sixty-seventh session “Bringing about \r\nadjustment or settlement of international disputes or \r\nsituations by peaceful means”.\r\nThe Republic of South Sudan achieved its \r\nindependence peacefully, through the exercise of the \r\nright of self-determination by the people of South \r\nSudan in an internationally supervised referendum, \r\nas stipulated in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement \r\n(CPA). The international community played an \r\nimportant role in this, our independence process. We \r\nare therefore very thankful to all those who helped us \r\nachieve independence, not least the United Nations.\r\nOur declaration of independence on 9 July 2011 did \r\nnot resolve all the issues between us and the predecessor \r\nState, the Republic of the Sudan. These unresolved, \r\npost-independence issues include border demarcation, \r\noil infrastructure, security and the final status of the \r\nAbyei Area. The bilateral engagement between the two \r\ncountries failed to achieve an agreement. As a result, \r\nthe African Union intervened by mandating the African \r\nUnion High-level Implementation Panel, under former \r\nPresident Thabo Mbeki, to facilitate negotiations \r\nbetween the two parties.\r\nAs the situation continued to deteriorate, the \r\nSecurity Council intervened and adopted resolution \r\n2046 (2012). That resolution sets out a clear road map \r\nfor resolving all the remaining differences between the \r\nSudan and South Sudan, including Abyei, and addresses \r\nthe conflicts in Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile.\r\nBefore I discuss the developments in the talks in \r\nAddis Ababa, allow me to also brief the Assembly on \r\nother issues of importance such as State-building, food \r\nsecurity, public service reform, access to education, \r\nsecurity and accountability in my country.\r\nWe have embarked upon laying a secure foundation \r\nfor a prosperous, democratic and stable nation by \r\nestablishing institutions at the national, state and local \r\nGovernment levels for governance and the delivery of \r\nservices to the people. We believe that food security \r\nis not a privilege but a basic right of each and every \r\ncitizen in South Sudan. No citizen should go hungry. \r\nAs the saying goes, a hungry man is an angry man. It \r\nIn conclusion, we, the people and Government of \r\nIraq, extend our hand to the other Member States with a \r\nview to increased collaboration aimed at achieving our \r\ncommon goals. Those are noble goals, based on lofty \r\nprinciples and cherished human values, and honour all \r\nhuman beings as supremely deserving of leading a free \r\nand safe life and enjoying fundamental freedoms. We \r\nhope that when we meet again our world will be a safer \r\nplace, our peoples will enjoy better conditions and the \r\ninternational climate will have improved.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of Iraq for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Khudayr al-Khuzai, Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of Iraq, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Riek Machar Teny-Dhurgon, \r\nVice-President of the Republic of South Sudan\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Vice-President of the Republic \r\nof South Sudan.\r\nMr. Riek Machar Teny-Dhurgon, Vice-President of \r\nthe Republic of South Sudan, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Riek Machar Teny-\r\nDhurgon, Vice-President of the Republic of South \r\nSudan, and inviting him to address the General \r\nAssembly.\r\nMr. Machar Teny-Dhurgon (South Sudan): Allow \r\nme, at the outset, to join fellow Member States in \r\ncongratulating the President of the General Assembly \r\non his election to preside over the Assembly at its sixty-\r\nseventh session and to commend his predecessor for his \r\nsuccessful stewardship of the most recent session.\r\nI would like to seize this momentous occasion to \r\nexpress our deepest gratitude and appreciation to the \r\nSecretary-General for the passion and compassion \r\nhe has shown in responding to the various global \r\nchallenges facing the Organization and, most important, \r\nhis unwavering personal support for our referendum on \r\nself-determination, our independence and the speedy \r\nadmission of the Republic of South Sudan into the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nFurthermore, we are also deeply grateful to the \r\nAssembly for the warmth, generosity and hospitality \r\n12-52343 25\r\nA/67/PV.13\r\nMy Government is striving harder than ever to \r\ncombat corruption in our public service. Along with \r\nreformed systems for management of public funds and \r\ntighter controls, we are combating corruption through \r\nthe rule of law and through greater transparency and \r\naccountability. The Government has enacted legislation \r\nthat holds public officials accountable and brings the \r\nmanagement of our resources closer to international \r\nstandards.\r\nThe Government has published the entire annual \r\nbudget and opened our books to public scrutiny. By \r\nthe end of the year, we aim to be up to date on all of \r\nthe audits of our national accounts since the signing \r\nof the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, in 2005. As \r\nan accountable Government before our people, we \r\nstill believe that there is a long way ahead to achieve \r\nthe efficiency, transparency and accountability in our \r\npublic service and financial management. Despite the \r\neconomic peril since the shut-down of oil production, \r\nwe are, nevertheless, encouraged that the current \r\nperiod of austerity has strengthened our resolve to press \r\nahead in our reform agenda and has allowed us to lay \r\na strong foundation for more efficient and accountable \r\ngovernance beyond the austerity period — tough times \r\nnever last, but tough people do.\r\nWith regard to security, the Republic of South \r\nSudan is currently facing security threats in the form \r\nof armed militia groups that are creating insecurity and \r\nundermining our young democracy. The Government \r\nhas accorded the highest priority to reaching a peaceful \r\nresolution to these internal conflicts. Four of the armed \r\nmilitia groups have laid down their weapons and have \r\nintegrated voluntarily into our national army and \r\ncivilian life.\r\nWe believe that the internal and external security \r\nof our nation is a prerequisite for having meaningful \r\neconomic development and social progress. While we are \r\nworking tirelessly towards achieving and maintaining \r\npeace within our borders, critical unresolved issues \r\nremain between South Sudan and the Sudan, including \r\nborder demarcation, citizenship rights, the status of \r\nAbyei and oil-related issues. The lack of progress on \r\nthose post-independence issues has been posing a threat \r\nto peace and stable relations between the two countries.\r\nOur relations with the Sudan reached a critical \r\njuncture last year, when Khartoum blocked tankers \r\nloaded with our crude oil and prevented them from \r\ndeparting from Port Sudan. In addition, Sudan seized \r\nwill not be good for the stability of the country if we \r\nhave many hungry and angry men. In our endeavour to \r\nachieve food security, we are diversifying the economy \r\nby utilizing oil revenues to fuel agriculture and build \r\nthe necessary basic infrastructure. This is the only way \r\nwe can benefit from the vast fertile agricultural lands \r\nthat our country is generously endowed with.\r\nOur public service is functioning satisfactorily, \r\nespecially after the introduction of far-reaching public \r\nservice reforms. That has brought about efficiency and \r\ntransparency in service delivery. We have introduced \r\nconstructive and effective reforms in our public \r\nfinancial management and have strengthened measures \r\nto improve transparency and accountability.\r\nAs for education, we have increased access to \r\neducation for all children in South Sudan. Since the \r\nsigning of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, in \r\n2005, enrolment in our primary schools has more than \r\ndoubled. In the past year, we continued to strengthen \r\nand expand the education sector by further introducing \r\nalternative education. This innovative notion of an \r\nalternative education system is currently offering \r\naccelerated learning programmes to more than 200,000 \r\nyouth and adults. Favourable conditions and terms of \r\nservice for teachers have been introduced throughout \r\nthe country, and the Government is working tirelessly \r\nto meet the rapidly increasing demand for secondary \r\neducation caused by the increase in primary school \r\nenrolment.\r\nHowever, the Government still has a long way to go \r\nin providing educational opportunities for our children \r\nand youth that prepare them for the future and meet their \r\nexpectations and aspirations. At this juncture, allow \r\nme to commend the launch by the Secretary-General \r\nof the Global Initiative on Education, which we hope \r\nwill open up avenues of collaboration between South \r\nSudan and the international community on improving \r\neducation access for our children.\r\nOur nascent nation has been tested enormously in \r\nits first year of independence. We have been tested by \r\nconflicts within and beyond our borders; we have been \r\ntested by severe economic hardship; and we have been \r\ntested by the revelation of severe abuse of the public \r\ntrust and funds resulting partly from malpractice \r\nand lack of capacity. The Government is undertaking \r\nserious corrective measures and institutional capacity-\r\nbuilding to address that issue in order to restore public \r\nconfidence.\r\n26 12-52343\r\nA/67/PV.13\r\nIn that connection, South Sudan is currently \r\ncarrying the burden of accommodating an increasing \r\nnumber of refugees from the two areas. We therefore call \r\nupon the international community to assist in meeting \r\nthe humanitarian needs of the refugees within South \r\nSudan, as well as throughout the Sudanese territory for \r\nthose internally displaced by the conflict.\r\nOur President stated in his statement at our \r\nindependence celebration:\r\n“We cannot abandon them, but would support their \r\ncause peacefully through negotiated settlement \r\nbetween them and the Government of the Sudan”. \r\nSouth Sudan will use its good offices as a former \r\nally of the SPLM-North to assist the Sudan by acting \r\nas an honest broker in mediating a peaceful, but just, \r\nresolution of the conflict. We believe that our role as \r\nhonest brokers will in the long term assist our neighbour \r\nto the north, the Government of the Sudan, to achieve \r\npeace and stability. We are glad that the United Nations \r\nrecognizes that there can be no military solution to \r\nthe conflict and that a negotiated settlement is the way \r\nforward.\r\nI am pleased to inform the Assembly that, today, \r\nPresident Salva Kiir Mayardit and President Omer \r\nHassan A. Al-Bashir signed an agreement that will allow \r\nthe two countries to pursue their national development \r\nefforts under a secure and lasting peace. We are hopeful \r\nthat the new agreement with the Sudan will lead to the \r\nresolution of our differences on security, borders and \r\nthe use of petroleum infrastructure.\r\nIt is envisaged that if each side upholds its part of \r\nthis agreement, the most significant causes of dispute \r\nbetween our two countries will have been amicably \r\nresolved. Diplomacy will have won, and reason will \r\nhave prevailed. \r\nWith the resolution of those key matters, \r\npreparations to resume oil production in South Sudan \r\nwill now begin. The following agreements were signed \r\ntoday between our two countries: first, the Agreement \r\nConcerning Oil and Related Economic Matters; \r\nsecond, the Framework Agreement on the Status of \r\nNationals of the Other State; third, the Agreement on \r\nthe Demarcation of the Boundary; fourth, an agreement \r\non border issues; fifth, the Agreement on a Framework \r\nfor Cooperation on Central Banking Issues; sixth, the \r\nAgreement on Trade and Trade-related Issues; seventh, \r\nthe Agreement on Certain Economic Matters: Division \r\nof Assets and Liabilities, Arrears and Claims and Joint \r\nand resold crude oil that we had sold to international \r\ncustomers. By January, we had lost some $800 million \r\nin revenues. At that point, my Government was left with \r\nno choice but to shut down oil production. The decision \r\nwas publicly supported by the majority of our people.\r\nIn the context of relations of South Sudan and the \r\nSudan, it is incumbent upon my Government to shed \r\nsome light of what became known as the Heglig or \r\nPanthou incident between us and the Republic of the \r\nSudan. That crisis was the result of increasing border \r\ntensions and repeated bombings in the border areas of \r\nmy country by the Sudanese Armed Forces.\r\nIn April, our forces clashed with the Sudanese army \r\nin an area inside South Sudan, several kilometers south \r\nof Heglig. That resulted in our armed forces taking over \r\nHeglig temporarily; we acted in self-defence to prevent \r\nHeglig from being used as a launching pad for military \r\nattacks by the Sudanese Armed Forces on our country.\r\nIn compliance with advice from the international \r\ncommunity, we withdraw our forces soon thereafter. \r\nAlthough Heglig is historically part of South Sudan, it \r\nwas not our intention to take it by force. We believe that \r\nwe can settle the matter through peaceful negotiations.\r\nAnother area in which we believe we have not been \r\nwell understood by the international community is \r\nour alleged support for the Sudan People’s Liberation \r\nMovement – North (SPLM-North). What may not be \r\nfully appreciated by outside observers is that those \r\nforces were integral members of the SPLM. But \r\nalthough they fought side by side with us, they were \r\nnot fighting for the independence of southern Sudan, \r\nbut for their own cause through alliance with us. Of \r\ncourse, we shared a common vision of creating a new, \r\nfundamentally restructured united Sudan of inclusivity, \r\nequity and dignity for all, without discrimination on the \r\nbasis of race, ethnicity, religion or culture. But we also \r\nhad issues that were specific to our particular situation \r\nand which, for us, eventually led to our independence.\r\nIt should be recalled that the CPA included a special \r\nprotocol on Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile states \r\nthat addressed their special grievances. That protocol \r\nis yet to be credibly implemented. As the SPLM-North \r\nwere former allies who contributed significantly to our \r\nsuccess in achieving the objectives of our struggle, we \r\nobviously have a moral and, indeed, political obligation \r\nto assist them in addressing their legitimate grievances, \r\nas stipulated and agreed in the CPA.\r\n12-52343 27\r\nA/67/PV.13\r\nRepublic of South Sudan for the statement he has just \r\nmade.\r\nMr. Riek Machar Teny-Dhurgon, Vice-President of \r\nthe Republic of South Sudan, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Winston Baldwin Spencer, \r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof Antigua and Barbuda \r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister and Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of Antigua and Barbuda.\r\nMr. Winston Baldwin Spencer, Prime Minister \r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs of Antigua and \r\nBarbuda, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming Mr. Winston Baldwin Spencer, Prime \r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Antigua \r\nand Barbuda, and inviting him to address the General \r\nAssembly.\r\nMr. Spencer (Antigua and Barbuda): I wish at \r\nthe outset to extend my heartiest congratulations and \r\nthe assurances of my cooperation and highest esteem \r\nto President Jeremić on his election to the presidency \r\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. \r\nAntigua and Barbuda looks forward to his leadership \r\nand guidance throughout this session.\r\nI extend congratulations also to your predecessor, \r\nMr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, on a job well done \r\nand for his continued service to the international \r\ncommunity.\r\nThe theme of the sixty-seventh session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, “Bringing about adjustment or \r\nsettlement of international disputes or situations \r\nby peaceful means”, is judicious, for it accurately \r\nsummarizes how we as nations need to act in these \r\nprecarious times of insecurity and uncertainty. These \r\ntimes and circumstances call for a heightened sense of \r\nurgency and a stronger will among all nations to work \r\nwith and through the United Nations in embracing \r\nmultilateralism in its truest form.\r\nThe sixty-seventh session of the Assembly is \r\ntaking place in an environment of continued challenges \r\nto international peace and security; international \r\ndemocracy is being tested; there is unbearable poverty \r\nthroughout the world; the sluggish recovery of the \r\nApproach to the International Community; and, finally, \r\neighth, the Framework Agreement to Facilitate Payment \r\nof Post-Service Benefits.\r\nWhile we are happy with all that has been agreed \r\ntoday by our two countries, I wish to inform the General \r\nAssembly that we have failed to reach agreement on \r\nAbyei. President Al-Bashir has rejected the proposal \r\nof the African Union High-level Implementation \r\nPanel, as stipulated under Security Council \r\nresolution 2046 (2012). It is now incumbent upon the \r\nAfrican Union (AU) Peace and Security Council, \r\ntogether with the United Nations Security Council, to \r\ntake the action necessary to move forward.\r\nWe are thankful to both the AU Peace and Security \r\nCouncil and the United Nations Security Council \r\nfor their great efforts to bring about this agreement \r\nbetween our two countries.\r\nAs our President stated in this forum one year \r\nago, “The ambition of the people of South Sudan is \r\nto be able to transform their country into a regional \r\nagro-industrial powerhouse” (see A/66/PV.19), with \r\nreduced dependence on external assistance, and the \r\npotential to feed the people of South Sudan and to be a \r\nbreadbasket for East Africa.\r\nOur strategy is aimed at utilizing oil wealth as \r\na catalyst to stimulate our economic development \r\npotential, with an emphasis on agriculture.\r\nWe are conscious of the fact that we cannot achieve \r\nthose goals alone. We need continued support from \r\nfriends, partners and the international community. \r\nWe are confident that together we shall overcome the \r\nchallenges ahead. I take this opportunity once more, \r\non behalf of the people and the Government of South \r\nSudan, to express our profound gratitude for the support \r\nrendered to us by the United Nations, the AU, regional \r\norganizations, friends and partners.\r\nMr. Momen (Bangladesh), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair.\r\nFinally, allow me to reiterate the resolve and the \r\ncommitment of the people and the Government of \r\nthe Republic of South Sudan to be a productive and \r\nactive member of this global family of nations, and to \r\nmake their contribution to promoting world peace and \r\nprosperity for all humankind.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Vice-President of the \r\n28 12-52343\r\nA/67/PV.13\r\nOver 200 million persons in the Americas depend \r\non us. That is why I am reiterating a call I made in \r\nthe Hall in 2011 for former slave States to begin the \r\nreconciliation process by issuing formal apologies for \r\nthe crimes committed by the nations or their citizens \r\nover the 400 years of the African slave trade. While \r\nnations in the developing world continue to grapple with \r\nthe effects of a world economic crisis that is not of their \r\nown making, I call on former slave States to back up \r\ntheir apologies with new commitments to the economic \r\ndevelopment of those nations that have suffered from \r\nthat human tragedy.\r\nTransnational crime is threatening the very \r\nexistence of peace in Antigua and Barbuda. Our small \r\nsize and lack of human and financial resources make \r\nit difficult for us, as a small island nation, to address \r\nthat problem in an effective manner. The crime and \r\nviolence fuelled by the illicit trade in small arms and \r\nlight weapons are jeopardizing our major industries, \r\nincluding tourism. Our health-care systems are weighted \r\ndown, and families are being torn apart. Nevertheless, \r\ncrime prevention and small arms control is a priority \r\nfor my Government. It is important to note that neither \r\nAntigua and Barbuda nor our Caribbean Community \r\nbrothers and sisters manufacture small arms or light \r\nweapons, yet one recent estimate indicates that there \r\nare 1.6 million illegal firearms in the region.\r\nAdditionally, Antigua and Barbuda is deeply \r\nsaddened by the fact that, despite significant efforts, \r\nstrong will on the part of the majority of States and \r\nthe fact that a compromise was potentially within \r\nreach, there was no agreement on a text for the recently \r\ndiscussed legally binding arms trade treaty. The \r\nAssembly can rest assured that Antigua and Barbuda \r\nwill not give up, and we will continue to advocate for a \r\nlegally binding treaty that will eliminate the threat that \r\nis crippling our region.\r\nAntigua and Barbuda is committed to the rule of law \r\nand the process it enables for direct political dialogue \r\nand cooperation among all States and international \r\nactors. The rule of law facilitates international peace \r\nand security, human rights and development for all. Our \r\njoint responses to the threats to peace and security, along \r\nwith the opportunities arising from various political, \r\neconomic and social instabilities, must be guided by the \r\nrule of law, as it is the basis for friendly coexistence and \r\ninterdependence between and among States.\r\nworld’s economy provides little hope; and disasters \r\ninduced by climate change are becoming more rampant.\r\nAs we look around our global community, we ask \r\nourselves what we can do to solve the many problems \r\nwe face, and how we can find and maintain the peace \r\nthat we so desire. Maybe if we ask ourselves not as \r\nindividuals but as nations what peace is, then, perhaps, \r\nwe can collectively resolve to find the answer so as to \r\nachieve peace.\r\nFor Antigua and Barbuda, peace means respect \r\nfor human rights and the differences of others and the \r\nprotection of women, children and the elderly. Peace is \r\ndevoid of greed that ends in unparalleled wealth for a few \r\nand nauseating poverty for many. Peace means global \r\nhealth awareness, protection and accessibility for all. \r\nPeace means democracies with active global citizens, \r\nby non-violent change. Peace means eliminating nuclear \r\nweapons and controlling small arms.\r\nPeace is free of violence and requires the \r\nacceptance of differences in race, gender and religion. \r\nPeace is a position from which to value the limits of \r\nnature’s resources, and it is characterized by the \r\nabsence of the ignorance and shortsightedness that \r\nleads some to selfishly plunder Earth’s plenty. Peace is \r\nthe understanding that climate change is real and that \r\nsustainability should be our priority. Peace means fair \r\ntrade and equality of equity in globalization.\r\nPeace is the elimination of corruption in Government. \r\nPeace is the understanding and the recognition that the \r\nworld’s problems can be solved only by the inclusion \r\nof all countries. Peace therefore involves a wider and \r\nequal representation in the Security Council rather than \r\nmembership by a selected few.\r\nIn 2011, we celebrated the International Year for \r\nPeoples of African Descent. That year has passed, \r\nand gone from the international agenda is the issue \r\nof reparations for slavery, which is central to fighting \r\nracism and racial discrimination and nurturing a \r\nculture of peace among nations. The legacy of racial \r\nviolence, segregation and slavery against peoples of \r\nAfrican descent has severely impaired our advancement \r\nas nations, communities and individuals across the \r\npolitical, social and, most importantly, the economical \r\nspectrums. In the words of Kwame Nkrumah, we can \r\nno longer afford the luxury of delay. The time has come \r\nfor us to revisit the issue of reparations for slavery and \r\nplace it at the top of the international agenda.\r\n12-52343 29\r\nA/67/PV.13\r\nof the Parties to the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change needs to take concrete \r\nsteps in order to protect small island developing States \r\nand other exposed countries from the threats of climate \r\nchange.\r\nThe responsibility to mitigate climate change \r\nshould be at the forefront of the collective consciousness \r\nof both developing and developed countries. However, \r\ndeveloped countries should accept their responsibilities \r\nas the leading contributors to the extremely high \r\nlevels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which \r\nare now threatening the welfare of present and future \r\ngenerations. It is my Government’s hope that the selfish \r\nact of inaction will dissipate in Doha and that a positive \r\noutcome in the climate change negotiations will usher \r\nin new hopes for humanity and compassion for our \r\nplanet.\r\nAntigua and Barbuda is doing its part to protect \r\nMother Earth. My Government has embarked on a \r\nrenewable energy mandate. We are now shifting our \r\nfocus towards harvesting water and wind to meet our \r\nenergy needs. We are protecting our ecosystem with \r\nstrong legislation, and we are replanting mangroves \r\nand protecting areas that are sensitive to pollutants. \r\nClimate change and sustainability are high on my \r\nGovernment’s development and investment priorities, \r\nand we are ensuring that new and refurbished private \r\nand commercial investments are in line with our green \r\napproach to our society.\r\nMy Government also joins with member States of \r\nthe Alliance of Small Island States in calling on the \r\nGeneral Assembly to designate 2014 as the International \r\nYear of Small Island Developing States in order to raise \r\nawareness of the special situation of our members \r\nand mobilize international support for our sustainable \r\ndevelopment.\r\nOver the past year, the United Nations Stabilization \r\nMission in Haiti has made important progress in its \r\nsupport to the Haitian people’s efforts to consolidate \r\ndemocracy, stability and the rule of law and to move \r\nforward on the path to social and economic development. \r\nIn spite of the progress made, the situation in Haiti \r\nremains fragile, as the country strives to overcome its \r\ndaunting political, social and economic challenges. \r\nI therefore stress the need for adequate funding \r\nand continued implementation of the Mission in Haiti. I \r\nwould like to reiterate my Government’s strong support \r\nfor the Mission in Haiti and to stress that peace will \r\nMy Government upholds the ideals of the recently \r\nconcluded High-level Meeting on the Rule of Law at the \r\nNational and International Levels and stands committed \r\nto upholding that very important principle.\r\nThe Caribbean has been known as a zone of peace. \r\nWe value our ability to live and work together despite \r\nour different religious and political beliefs and ethnic \r\nbackgrounds. Antigua and Barbuda therefore condemns \r\nthe brutal killing of the United States Ambassador to \r\nLibya and the destruction of the United States Consulate \r\nin Libya. We condemn any acts of violence or killings \r\ndisguised as actions to defend religious belief. If we are \r\nto build an environment of peace around the world, we \r\nmust show tolerance for all peoples and beliefs.\r\nThe dangers posed by non-State actors acquiring \r\nweapons of mass destruction are real and should be \r\nseen by all countries, large and small, as the single most \r\ndestructive element threatening international peace and \r\nsecurity. Antigua and Barbuda is particularly concerned \r\nby the lack of progress in the area of disarmament and \r\nnon-proliferation. There should be no compromise on \r\nthat issue. Antigua and Barbuda remains resolute in our \r\ncontinued call for a nuclear-weapon-free world.\r\nThe recently concluded Rio+20 Conference on \r\nSustainable Development provided an international \r\nplatform from which to address the social, economic and \r\nenvironmental challenges affecting the international \r\ncommunity. Those challenges are direct threats to \r\nhumankind and oftentimes jeopardize peace and \r\nsecurity for all.\r\nIn resolution 66/288, entitled “The future we want”, \r\nAntigua and Barbuda saw the Rio+20 Conference as \r\nsecuring comprehensive and inclusive sustainability \r\nfor small island nations, whose survival is contingent \r\non an outcome of commitments and actions from the \r\nConference.\r\nAt the recently concluded summit of the Alliance \r\nof Small Island States, my country joined with other \r\nsmall island States in sending a strong message to \r\nthe international community on the need for bold and \r\nambitious actions. We cannot wait for our lands to \r\ndisappear before we act. We must act now to respond to \r\nthe climate crisis and ensure that not a single country is \r\nsacrificed, no matter how small.\r\nThe threat is real. Our sea levels are rising, there is \r\ncoral bleaching beyond our shores, and hurricanes are \r\nbecoming more recurrent and severe. The Conference \r\n30 12-52343\r\nA/67/PV.13\r\nprescribed international standards. Unfortunately, \r\nour friend and developed partner, the United States \r\nof America, was of the view that our gaming sector \r\ncontravened its domestic laws. Antigua and Barbuda \r\nfound it appropriate to seek international redress on \r\nthe matter through the dispute resolution mechanism \r\nat the World Trade Organization. We prevailed, and \r\nthe United States was ordered to compensate Antigua \r\nand Barbuda for its losses. Yet, years later, Antigua and \r\nBarbuda is still engaging in negotiations with the United \r\nStates. I therefore call on the Government of the United \r\nStates to work with us to quickly resolve the matter so \r\nthat we can arrive at a settlement that is fair and just. \r\nI also call on the United States to work cooperatively \r\nwith Antigua and Barbuda and other remote gaming \r\njurisdictions to forge an enlightened, reasonable and \r\nreasoned way of addressing the regulation and licensing \r\nof remote gaming services.\r\nWhile we are on the matter of trade disputes, it \r\nhas been decades since the United States instituted its \r\nembargo on Cuba. Time and time again the international \r\ncommunity, acting through the General Assembly, has \r\ncalled on the United States to lift that trade embargo. \r\nHowever, it continues unabated. Since its inception, the \r\nembargo has inflicted untold economic damage on the \r\nCuban people, caused shortages and needless suffering \r\nto the Cuban population, limited and restrained the \r\ndevelopment of the country and seriously damaged \r\nthe Cuban economy. Through all of that, the Cuban \r\npeople have managed to preserve their sovereignty, \r\nindependence and right to self-determination. As a \r\ncountry committed to the norms of the multilateral \r\ntrading system and to the freedom of trade and \r\nnavigation and a country that rejects the extraterritorial \r\napplication of another country’s national laws, Antigua \r\nand Barbuda calls on the United States to immediately \r\nand unconditionally lift its economic embargo against \r\nthe people of Cuba. It is time to turn a new page of \r\npeace, cooperation and understanding, a time for global \r\nhealing and international community-building. The \r\ncontinuation of the embargo further destroys the very \r\nfabric of hope that we have created as a community of \r\nnations in order to resolve the world’s issues.\r\nThe world is changing. Economies, policies and \r\ncountries are becoming more intertwined than ever \r\nbefore. Antigua and Barbuda sees those relationships of \r\nintegration as positive steps towards achieving a world \r\nthat is not dominated by a few but represents rather a \r\nonly be achieved if we simultaneously address issues of \r\nsecurity, national reconciliation and development. I also \r\ncall on those nations that pledged assistance to Haiti to \r\nhonour their commitments. Those pledges are urgently \r\nneeded, now that the rebuilding phase is progressing \r\nunder a new Administration.\r\nIt has been nearly fi ve years since we started to see a \r\nsharp downturn in the world’s economy. Unfortunately, \r\nAntigua and Barbuda is among the small and developing \r\nStates that have yet to see significant improvements. \r\nWhile we have made several attempts to curtail the \r\nhaemorrhaging of our fragile economies, it must be \r\nsaid that we need greater cooperation, f lexibility \r\nand inclusion on the part of our developed partners. \r\nGross domestic product can no longer be the criterion \r\nused in accessing concessionary financing and other \r\ninternational financial relief; instead, mechanisms \r\nshould be put in place that take into consideration a host \r\nof other elements, including the fragility of economies.\r\nWe are still in a crisis, a crisis of confidence in \r\nglobal governance and the institutional capacity \r\nfor managing the international financial system, \r\ninternational trade and international development \r\npolicies. We are also living in the era of globalization \r\nwhere cooperative collectives — and not ambitious \r\nand selfish empires — must be the order of the day in \r\ninternational financial governance. A privileged few \r\nshould never be allowed to make financial decisions \r\nthat impact the socioeconomic livelihood of millions \r\nwithout regard for that excluded majority. Economic \r\nprosperity should be shared equally among countries \r\nand within countries. The exclusive clubs of the \r\nGroup of Eight and the Group of 20 cannot repair the \r\nfragmented international financial system without \r\ntaking due consideration of the majority of nations left \r\non the outside with much to offer.\r\nMy Government calls on developed countries \r\nand the countries of the Organization for Economic \r\nCooperation and Development to guarantee that their \r\nresponse with regard to international tax matters will \r\ninvolve improved international cooperation on tax issues \r\nthrough comprehensive and supportive frameworks that \r\nensure the involvement and equal treatment of small \r\njurisdictions like Antigua and Barbuda without the \r\nnuances of inappropriately branding us as tax havens.\r\nAntigua and Barbuda has been proactive in its \r\napproach to diversifying our economy. We entered \r\ninto the international gaming sector abiding by all \r\n12-52343 31\r\nA/67/PV.13\r\ncollaborate in the development of a food policy that will \r\naddress some of the risk factors for NCDs.\r\nThe fight against HIV/AIDS in my region is also \r\nreal. The figures are heartbreaking, and the outlook is \r\ntroubling. Despite some progress, much still needs to \r\nbe done to achieve the 2015 goal of universal access \r\nto HIV prevention, treatment, support and care. My \r\nGovernment is in the process of updating the code of \r\nconduct to prevent discrimination in the workplace \r\nagainst persons living with HIV/AIDS. We will not \r\ntolerate injustice, intolerance and violence of any kind \r\nagainst persons living with HIV/AIDS.\r\nMany might believe that for countries like Antigua \r\nand Barbuda, as a small island developing State, our \r\nonly concern is for development, but I stand here today \r\nwith grave concern that the disregard for world peace \r\nand security threatens the very existence of humankind \r\nand will push the international community into further \r\nchaos and destruction. We cannot ignore from our tiny \r\npeaceful shores the images that glare from our TV \r\nscreens of unrest, protest and demonstrations from \r\nvarious corners of the world. The images are daunting, \r\nthe voices of change are deafening and the use of \r\nforce or threat of use of force to suppress the voices of \r\ndemocracy is intolerable. The United Nations has to be \r\nunified in its response so as to act in a peaceful manner \r\nwhile protecting the rights of populations near and far.\r\nThe situation in Syria is disheartening. Children, \r\nwomen and the elderly must be protected. I call on \r\nboth sides to exercise restraint and allow humanitarian \r\nrelief supplies to enter Syria. I also call on all nations \r\nto cease supplying arms to the two sides in the conflict. \r\nAs leaders, our priority must be to urge all parties in \r\nSyria to implement a ceasefire and stop the violence \r\nimmediately and completely. Every effort must be \r\nmade to implement Mr. Annan’s six-point proposal and \r\nthe relevant Security Council resolutions. The United \r\nNations and the Arab League must lead in that process. \r\nAny threats of war must be suppressed, and negotiation \r\nand mediation should be the order of the day. If it is not \r\naddressed, the Syrian crisis will soon pose a serious \r\nthreat to international peace and security. Antigua \r\nand Barbuda will continue to give its support to a just, \r\npeaceful and appropriate settlement of the Syrian crisis \r\nat an early date.\r\nThese are undeniably perilous times. An event can \r\noccur in a distant part of the globe that can severely \r\nimpact Antigua and Barbuda domestically, an event \r\nunification of leadership in the hope of combating most \r\nof the world’s shortcomings.\r\nThe smaller developing countries in the Caribbean \r\nand the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States \r\n(OECS) are poised to make great strides in our integration \r\nagenda. The ratification of the OECS Economic Union \r\nis a major step in that direction. We have a stable \r\nshared currency, with a monetary council that has been \r\ninstrumental in preventing further deterioration of our \r\neconomies. There have been renewed commitments \r\nby all of the Caribbean Community countries to work \r\ntirelessly to realize the full potential of the Caribbean \r\nSingle Market and Economy. Antigua and Barbuda has \r\njoined the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our \r\nAmerica, an institution that is built on the principles \r\nof solidarity, complementarity and cooperation. \r\nThe Community of Latin America and Caribbean \r\nStates — a new integration arm within our region — the \r\ngeographical position of our countries, our shared \r\ncultures and values and our desires as developing \r\npartners for a more just global community that is built \r\non fairness and peace give my Government hope that \r\nall is not lost as regards multilateralism.\r\nAntigua and Barbuda faces many challenges in the \r\nprevention, care and treatment of non-communicable \r\ndiseases (NCDs). Heart disease, diabetes, cancer, \r\ncardiovascular disease and chronic respiratory diseases \r\ncontinue to be the leading causes of death in Antigua \r\nand Barbuda, with cancer and heart disease being the \r\ntop two causes. The burdens of the cost, the loss of \r\nproductivity and the disabilities as a result of chronic \r\ndiseases continue to weigh heavy on our health-care \r\nsystem, since treatment for those diseases and their \r\ncomplications, including dialysis, chemotherapy \r\nand drug therapy, continue to be offered free of cost \r\nto patients. The fight against NCDs remains high, \r\ntherefore, on Antigua and Barbuda’s health agenda.\r\nFollowing our participation in the United Nations \r\nHigh-level Meeting on the subject last year, the \r\nGovernment of Antigua and Barbuda approved the \r\nestablishment of a multisectoral NCD commission \r\nto provide leadership in that critical area, drafted \r\nlegislation for tobacco control, engaged civil society \r\nand non-governmental organizations in drafting an \r\nNCD policy and action plan and has supported plans for \r\nthe development of a comprehensive cancer treatment \r\ncentre in Antigua and Barbuda to serve the OECS. \r\nThe Ministries of Health and Agriculture continue to \r\n32 12-52343\r\nA/67/PV.13\r\nbring peace to the citizens of the world.

Our response may be \r\none of indignation but also a sense that we live in a \r\nperilous atmosphere characterized by the intolerance of \r\npeace. The multiplicity and interconnectedness of the \r\nmany global threats and challenges we face will test the \r\nabilities of this Assembly. Is the United Nations up to \r\nthe task?\r\nI am confident that by sharing our collective wisdom \r\nand using it as a resource, the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-seventh session will take decisions of meaningful \r\nand enduring benefit and peace for the peoples of the \r\nworld. I am equally confident that our deliberations \r\ncan lead to solutions that will ensure the protection of \r\nall our peoples.
