I am confident that the Assembly’s \r\nwork will be crowned with success, thanks to his rich \r\ndiplomatic experience and expertise. I assure him of \r\nLebanon’s full support in his efforts. I would also like to \r\nthank His Excellency Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, \r\nPresident of the Assembly at its sixty-sixth session, \r\nfor his tireless efforts and remarkable achievements. I \r\nalso extend my gratitude to the Secretary-General, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his keen concern \r\nover critical global issues, especially those related to \r\nthe Middle East, in particular my country, Lebanon, \r\nwhich was mentioned in his annual report (A/67/1).\r\nLebanon, a founding State Member of the United \r\nNations, reiterates its commitment to the noble \r\nprinciples and human values that make up the founding \r\npillars of the Organization. Those standards enable it \r\nto act globally for justice, freedom, prosperity and \r\npeace and to shoulder its responsibility to address the \r\nworld’s ongoing challenges. Those challenges test the \r\ninternational Organization’s credibility, efficiency, \r\nstatus, and role in ensuring social freedom, political \r\nstability and economic independence for all peoples of \r\nthe world, free from hegemony, polarization, fear and \r\ndouble standards.\r\nIn the light of the major developments and changes \r\nthat have occurred since the Second World War, it \r\nhas become necessary to strengthen the role of the \r\nGeneral Assembly as a universal organ. That should \r\npreclude the Security Council privileges, which are \r\ncurrently restricted to a limited number of countries \r\nthat control crucial decisions, in particular those \r\nrelated to war and peace. In that regard, in order to \r\nensure greater justice and democracy, the structure, \r\nprivileges and expansion of the Security Council \r\nshould be reconsidered. The new global political, \r\neconomic and social realities should be taken into \r\naccount by extending the membership so as to enable \r\nsmaller countries to have greater representation. That \r\nwould fulfil the United Nations principles of equality \r\nand justice among peoples.\r\nUnited Nations A/67/PV.14\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-seventh session\r\n14th plenary meeting\r\nThursday, 27 September 2012, 6 p.m.\r\nNew York\r\nOffi cial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Jeremić . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Serbia)\r\n2 12-52349\r\nA/67/PV.14\r\nOur meeting today takes place at a time of major \r\nglobal developments and changes, in particular for \r\nArab nations. Political reform had therefore become \r\ninevitable in order to achieve democracy and to lay the \r\nfoundations for freedom and respect for human rights. \r\nHowever, those legitimate demands can be attained \r\nsolely through a peaceful transition and dialogue, not \r\nviolence and foreign intervention, which will lead \r\nonly to more chaos, injustice and division, increasing \r\nthe number of refugees and exacerbating related \r\nhumanitarian consequences. Therefore, with regard \r\nto the Syrian crisis, Lebanon reaffirms its policy of \r\ndisassociation at the political and the security levels in \r\norder to maintain its stability and balance of powers and \r\nin order to avoid unnecessary repercussions and risks. \r\nLebanon has not refrained from providing \r\nhumanitarian support to the displaced Syrians in \r\nLebanon, in an effort to alleviate their suffering. \r\nHowever, Lebanon alone cannot deal with the \r\nincreasing number of displaced Syrians and their \r\nhumanitarian needs. We have provided assistance, but \r\nthe number of displaced persons has risen and exceeded \r\nour capacities. We can no longer absorb them on our \r\nown. More assistance by relevant international bodies \r\nis needed to help us in that regard. \r\nThe security repercussions of the Syrian crisis \r\nthreaten civic peace and stability at the local level \r\nand in the Middle East. The international community \r\nmust make greater efforts to reach a political solution \r\nbetween the parties in Syria, in order to put an end to \r\nthe violence that is claiming hundreds of innocent lives \r\nevery day.\r\nAs we support the freedom and legitimate rights \r\nof all people, we need to raise a crucial issue, namely, \r\nthe right of the fraternal Palestinian people to return \r\nto their homeland and to establish an independent \r\nPalestinian State, with Jerusalem as its capital. The \r\nrecognition of the Palestinian State and its acceptance \r\nas a full Member of this international Organization and \r\nits affiliated agencies should pave the way for a just \r\npolitical solution to the Palestinian question and correct \r\nthe ongoing historical injustice that has been inflicted \r\non the Palestinian people since 1948.\r\nLebanon is committed to maintaining stability \r\nand security in southern Lebanon, and we reaffirm \r\nour commitment to Security Council resolution 1701 \r\n(2006). However, the continuous Israeli violations of \r\nLebanese sovereignty by air, land and sea — in excess \r\nof 9,000 violations since 2006 — are limiting the \r\nfreedom of action of the United Nations Interim Force \r\nin Lebanon (UNIFIL) and threatening the security \r\nof its members, once again violating international \r\nresolutions, specifically resolution 1701 (2006). \r\nWe appeal to the international community to \r\npressure Israel to respect international resolutions \r\nand international law, to immediately withdraw from \r\noccupied North Ghajar, the Shaba’a farmlands and the \r\nKfar Shouba hills, and to bring to an end the continuous \r\nthreats to Lebanon’s security. Lebanon values \r\nUNIFIL’s role and its sacrifices, as well as its ongoing \r\ncooperation and coordination with the Lebanese army, \r\nand we express our gratitude to all participating and \r\nsupporting countries.\r\nLebanon calls for the full implementation of \r\nresolution 66/192, of 22 December 2011, regarding the \r\noil slick on its shores during the Israeli 2006 war on \r\nLebanon, and demands compensation, in application of \r\nparagraph 4 of that resolution.\r\nWe reiterate our commitment to defend our \r\nexclusive economic area and our maritime borders as \r\nset by international law and in accordance with the \r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, \r\nwhich affirms our right to exploit our wealth and \r\nnatural resources. \r\nLebanon, a vital crossroads of religions, beliefs, \r\ncultures and civilizations, is a country committed \r\nto divine and human values. We are fully aware that \r\ndiversity and difference are an integral part of life in \r\nour region and throughout the world. We reiterate our \r\ncommitment to freedom of expression, tolerance and \r\ndialogue. In the words of Pope John Paul II, Lebanon \r\nis not merely a country, it is a message. We consider \r\nprejudice towards all religions and prophets a clear \r\naggression against the dignity, values and feelings of \r\nall believers, for it can only instigate conflict, violence \r\nand reactions that we condemn and could never accept. \r\nNo one could accept them. \r\nWe therefore emphasize the importance and \r\nnecessity of dialogue between civilizations and \r\ncultures. Building trust and fostering rules of conduct \r\nbinding on all are essential to end once and for all the \r\ndesecration of religious symbols, as well as to ensure \r\nrespect for people’s feelings and their freedom of belief. \r\nSuch efforts can put an end to the extreme reactions \r\nand condemnable practices that we have unfortunately \r\nwitnessed recently in certain countries. Respect for \r\n12-52349 3\r\nA/67/PV.14\r\na crossroads where societies must make choices that \r\nwill translate their ambitions into reality. We therefore \r\nrequest the international community to draw up a \r\nserious economic, cultural and development road \r\nmap to assist those countries in that newly reached \r\nbreakthrough. Our young Arab societies are in need of \r\nenlightenment and development that can be achieved \r\nonly by providing education and employment to put an \r\nend to ignorance and improve our living standards. That \r\nwill also certainly contribute to fighting extremism.\r\nWe therefore suggest that countries step forward \r\nwith their technical expertise while others offer \r\nfinancial assistance to draft a plan that could be \r\nimplemented through the framework of a new institution \r\nto assist young men and women working in public \r\nadministration to promote good governance, efficiency \r\nand productivity in governmental agencies. From \r\nthat perspective, I propose to establish an institution \r\nin Beirut that will soon be able to offer an integrated \r\nprogramme on good governance. \r\nAs the Middle East is witnessing the most tumultous \r\nperiod of its history, we call on the international \r\ncommunity to perceive Lebanon as the beacon of \r\nhope and message of freedom and pluralism that it is. \r\nLebanon is not merely a small nation in need of shelter \r\nin a stormy region, and we are not asking for protection \r\nto ensure our own survival. We are, rather, calling on \r\nthe Assembly to see us in the light of the role that we \r\nhave repeatedly played. Despite all the difficulties we \r\nare facing, our country, which is small geographically \r\nbut large in its global presence, has proved itself to be \r\nthe epitome of a democratic, tolerant and pluralistic \r\ncountry among its neighbours.\r\nIt is therefore the duty of the international \r\ncommunity to protect Lebanon, now and in the future, \r\nfrom the turbulence of the region and to help us so that \r\nwe may thrive, f lourish and shine our rays all over \r\nthe Middle East. Only then will the United Nations \r\nprovide our unstable region with a genuine source of \r\ninspiration, a viable, vibrant nation, an example and \r\nmodel of civil and religious liberties, social diversity \r\nand political freedom.\r\nI call on all those here not to perceive Lebanon as a \r\nresponsibility but as an opportunity, an opportunity to \r\nprovide the safest and fastest path to all that the Middle \r\nEast can be — democratic, peaceful and prosperous. \r\nLet us work to protect Lebanon from harm so we can \r\nreligion does not restrict freedom of expression; rather, \r\nit is a rational practice of such freedom. \r\nIn that spirit, Lebanon has launched a national \r\ndialogue among the different Lebanese constituencies \r\nbased on established national principles that were \r\nagreed on and developed under the Baabda Declaration \r\n(A/66/849, annex), which was welcomed by the Security \r\nCouncil. Dialogue is considered the best means for \r\nensuring stability in Lebanon.\r\nLebanon is committed to peace and strives for its \r\nachievement, especially in the Middle East, a region we \r\nwould like to be an oasis of peace, free of weapons of \r\nmass destruction. In that regard, we should remember \r\nthat Israel is the only country in the region to possess \r\nnuclear weapons and that it continues to refuse to \r\nratify the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \r\nWeapons, a position that constitutes an ongoing threat \r\nto peace and security in the region and the world at \r\nlarge.\r\nWe would like to emphasize once more the need \r\nfor a peaceful and diplomatic resolution of the Iranian \r\nnuclear issue, while stressing countries’ right to use \r\nnuclear power for peaceful purposes and avoiding \r\ndouble standards and selectivity, a problem that is \r\nfaced by many regions in the world and by our region \r\nin particular. We also welcome ongoing international \r\nefforts to combat terrorism, the scourge of our time. \r\nThe peace we strive for is founded on what is \r\nright, not a fait accompli peace. The justice we strive \r\nfor, especially in our region, is far removed from the \r\nselectivity and double standards that are, unfortunately, \r\nthe case globally, especially in the Middle East. Our \r\nregion is still suffering from the consequences of the \r\nestablishment of the State of Israel, in 1948, and from \r\nits ongoing occupation of Arab territories in complete \r\ndisregard for international law and United Nations \r\nresolutions. \r\nPeace, freedom and justice are the pillars for \r\nattaining both security and stability. They will pave \r\nthe way to the eradication of oppression, extremism, \r\nhegemony and terrorism in our world. Stability cannot \r\nexist without a Palestinian spring, and a Palestinian \r\nspring can occur only through the full implementation \r\nof the Palestinians’ right to self-determination on their \r\nland.\r\nThe Arab world is witnessing one of the most \r\ncritical periods of its modern history. We have reached \r\n4 12-52349\r\nA/67/PV.14\r\nmaintain peace in the Middle East and the world as a \r\nwhole.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Council \r\nof Ministers of the Lebanese Republic for the statement \r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Najib Mikati, President of the Council of \r\nMinisters of the Lebanese Republic, was escorted \r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Sheikh Hasina, Prime Minister of the \r\nPeople’s Republic of Bangladesh\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the People’s \r\nRepublic of Bangladesh.\r\nSheikh Hasina, Prime Minister of the People’s \r\nRepublic of Bangladesh, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming Her Excellency Sheikh Hasina, Prime \r\nMinister of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh, and \r\ninviting her to address the General Assembly.\r\nSheikh Hasina (Bangladesh) (spoke in Bangla; \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): I warmly \r\ncongratulate Mr. Jeremić on his election as President of \r\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session, and I \r\nthank Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser for his excellent \r\nleadership of the Assembly during the previous session. \r\nI also thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his \r\nefforts on behalf of the United Nations in the past year.\r\nOur new world is experiencing popular uprisings, \r\nintra-State conflicts, climate change disasters, global \r\nfinancial crises, food and energy insecurity, human \r\nrights violations, terrorism and so forth. These and \r\nother experiences call for collective efforts towards \r\npeaceful resolution at the United Nations. I therefore \r\ncommend the theme for this year’s deliberations, \r\nnamely, “Bringing about adjustment or settlement of \r\ninternational disputes or situations by peaceful means”.\r\nIn that context, I would like to recall the role of \r\nmy father, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the \r\nFather of the Nation, who from this rostrum 38 years \r\nago espoused the principles of friendship towards \r\nall and malice towards none, the peaceful settlement \r\nof disputes, the renunciation of the use of force in \r\ninternational relations, and contributing to global peace \r\nand security. In essence, his policy at home and abroad \r\nwas based on justice and peace. At home, during my \r\nlast tenure as Prime Minister, in 1997, those policy \r\nguidelines inspired me to settle a 20-year conflict that \r\nhad cost more than 20,000 lives, through the signing of \r\nthe Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord. In February \r\n2009, during my current tenure, I was able to peacefully \r\nsettle the volatile mutiny of our border guards, thus \r\naverting a dangerous crisis.\r\nWe have also put increased emphasis on improving \r\nexternal relations. I was able to resolve a 25-year-old \r\nissue with India on sharing the water of the River \r\nGanges with the signing in 1996 of the 30-year Ganges \r\nWater Sharing Treaty. Last year the 2011 Protocol to \r\nour 1974 Land Boundary Agreement settled a border \r\ndemarcation issue that had gone unresolved for 64 \r\nyears. We also addressed mutual concerns about a \r\ndam proposed by India across a common river. With \r\nour other neighbour, Myanmar, we reached a peaceful \r\nsettlement of a 41-year maritime boundary dispute \r\nthrough the International Tribunal for the Law of the \r\nSea.\r\nOur national and international commitment to peace \r\nhas also been demonstrated by our position among the \r\ntop contributors to United Nations peacekeeping and as a \r\nfounding member of the Peacebuilding Commission. As \r\nthe current Chair of the Commission, on 25 September \r\nwe held an event entitled “Peacebuilding: the way \r\nforward towards sustainable peace and security”, in \r\nwhich many here participated. As a member of the \r\nHuman Rights Council and of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil, we promote justice, peace, democracy, gender \r\nequality, secularism, the rule of law and the rights of \r\nminorities and vulnerable groups. As a member of the \r\nexecutive bodies of the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme, the United Nations Population Fund, the \r\nUnited Nations Office for Partnerships, UNESCO, \r\nthe Food and Agriculture Organization of the United \r\nNations, the International Maritime Organization and \r\nthe Universal Postal Union, we advocate setting global \r\nnorms and standards.\r\nIn my four decades in politics for the welfare of \r\nthe people, I have learned that peace prevails when \r\njustice prevails, both within States and in relations \r\nbetween States. Only justice can ensure peace, which \r\nis so vital for development, and justice is possible \r\nonly through democracy, which empowers people. \r\nThe alternative — the absence of democracy — means \r\nsocial injustice, poverty, inequality, deprivation and \r\n12-52349 5\r\nA/67/PV.14\r\nmarginalization, which encourage extremism and \r\nterrorism. We are therefore strengthening democracy \r\nand justice by empowering people by eradicating \r\npoverty, hunger, inequality and deprivation and \r\nby establishing social safety nets, creating jobs, \r\npromoting inclusiveness, sustained growth and human \r\ndevelopment, and by countering terrorism.\r\nThe principles to which I have just referred \r\nalso encouraged me to present a model for people’s \r\nempowerment and development at the sixty-sixth session \r\n(see A/66/PV.22). The model encompasses six mutually \r\nreinforcing peace multipliers: first, eradicating poverty \r\nand hunger; secondly, reducing inequality; thirdly, \r\nmitigating deprivation; fourthly, including excluded \r\npersons; fifthly, accelerating human development; \r\nand sixthly, eliminating terrorism. That model was \r\nendorsed by the Assembly in resolution 66/224, adopted \r\nby consensus last year. In Dhaka, on 5 and 6 August \r\n2012, we held an international conference to discuss \r\nthe model, and the 62 participating countries supported \r\nits consideration at the sixty-seventh session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. I highly appreciate their support. I \r\nalso seek the Assembly’s support for disseminating the \r\nmodel.\r\nIn our efforts to achieve people’s empowerment, \r\nparliamentary standing committees were established \r\nduring the first session of the Parliament that was \r\nconstituted immediately after the general elections of \r\n2008. There are 50 such committees, and many are \r\nchaired by members of Parliament from the opposition \r\nbench. We also introduced the Prime Minister’s question \r\ntime and strengthened commissions on anti-corruption, \r\nhuman rights and information. We ensured an \r\nindependent, proactive judiciary, strengthened the rule \r\nof law and established human rights, accountability, \r\nsecularism and rights of minorities. We proceeded \r\nwith regional multimodal connectivity to empower \r\nall people. We modernized education in madrasas. We \r\nentrenched the election commission and democratic \r\ninstitutions for holding 5,182 elections in a completely \r\nfree and credible atmosphere. We freed and expanded \r\nthe media, with 24 private television channels, 7 news \r\nagencies, 11 FM and 14 community radio stations, 320 \r\ndaily newspapers and 151 periodicals.\r\nSince justice is the basis for empowering people for \r\npeace and development, women should have an equal \r\nrole. To expedite the process of their empowerment, \r\ngirls are provided free education up to higher secondary \r\nschool under our new education policy. Women are also \r\nencouraged to be active in our national life. Women’s \r\nleadership has been developed from the grass-roots \r\nlevel to the national level. Their participation in politics \r\nhas been increased since the general elections in 2008. \r\nSo far, 12,838 women have been elected to local \r\nGovernment bodies, and 69 women are members of the \r\nParliament, constituting 20 per cent of the total number \r\nof members of Parliament. Besides my being the Prime \r\nMinister and Leader of the House, other women include \r\nthe Opposition Leader, the Deputy Leader of the \r\nHouse, five Cabinet ministers and a Whip. Of general \r\nGovernment posts, 30 per cent are reserved for women, \r\nsome of whom serve in very senior positions in the \r\njudicial, administrative and diplomatic fields, as well \r\nas in the armed and law enforcement services and as \r\nUnited Nations peacekeepers.\r\n Our efforts to empower people in my present \r\ntenure have so far helped in reducing poverty by 10 per \r\ncent, attaining a gross domestic product growth rate of \r\n6.5 per cent and enhancing per capita income by 34.6 per \r\ncent. They have helped to reduce overall inflation \r\nfrom double digits to 4.97 per cent, with food inflation \r\ndeclining from 13 per cent in 2008 to 2.25 per cent at \r\npresent. Our efforts have assisted in the employment of \r\n7.5 million in the private sector and half a million in the \r\npublic sector. Exports have increased annually by 19 per \r\ncent over 2009 figures to $24.3 billion in 2011-2012. We \r\nhave helped to arrange overseas jobs for 1.87 million \r\nnationals, increasing annual inward remittances by \r\n10 per cent over 2009 to $12 billion in 2011-2012. \r\nWe have maintained macroeconomic stability. We \r\nhave expanded information and communications \r\ntechnology facilities among the lowest tier of local \r\nGovernment to ensure the availability of e-services to \r\nrural people. Nearly 100 per cent of school-age children \r\nare enrolled in in primary schools. We have achieved \r\ngender parity in primary and secondary education and \r\nhave established 12,000 community clinics to ensure \r\nnutrition and health care for rural people, especially \r\nmothers and children. A climate change trust fund has \r\nbeen set up to implement adaptation and mitigation \r\nprogrammes. All those undertakings have helped in \r\nachieving Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \r\n3, 4 and 5, on gender parity and infant and maternal \r\nmortality, ahead of 2015.\r\nOur achievements have earned us global recognition \r\nthrough MDG, South-South and Food and Agriculture \r\nOrganization awards. Importantly, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has acknowledged those achievements by \r\n6 12-52349\r\nA/67/PV.14\r\nincluding me as a member of the Scaling Up Nutrition \r\nLead Group and as a champion for the Education First \r\ninitiative. We welcome his high-level panel on the \r\npost-2015 development agenda, which should consider \r\ncoherence with the sustainable development goals and \r\nshould prioritize poverty, hunger, nutrition, global \r\nfood and energy security, climate change and global \r\npartnership for sustainable development.\r\nI hope that the high-level panel will also consider \r\nformulating a position on the painful plight of autistic \r\nand disadvantaged children, who constitute about \r\n1 per cent of the world’s population. At home, we have \r\nput in place 55 special-needs schools and a centre for \r\nneurodevelopment and autism in children. In July 2011, \r\nwith the collaboration of the World Health Organization \r\nand Autism Speaks, we launched a global autism public \r\nhealth initiative. At the current Assembly session we \r\nwill submit a draft resolution on the autism spectrum \r\ndisorder, which I hope will receive the Assembly’s \r\nsupport.\r\nOur efforts are hindered by unjust developments \r\nresulting from climate change, such as increasing \r\npoverty, property loss, human displacement and the \r\nconsequent terrorism. The inevitable sea-level rise will \r\ncreate mass movements of displaced migrants. A new \r\nlegal regime ensuring social, cultural and economic \r\nrehabilitation of climate migrants — which I called for \r\nat the Assembly’s sixty-fourth session — must be put \r\nin place. \r\nIt was also emphasized at the Dhaka meeting in \r\n2011 of the Climate Vulnerable Forum that an alliance of \r\ncountries most vulnerable to climate change and rising \r\nsea levels has to be forged. As the current Chair of the \r\nForum, Bangladesh launched the second edition of the \r\nClimate Vulnerability Monitor yesterday in New York. \r\nI also reiterate my call for an international agreement \r\nlimiting greenhouse-gas emissions on the principle of \r\ncommon and differentiated responsibilities, on early \r\noperationalization of the Green Climate Fund for, inter \r\nalia, adaptation, mitigation and technology transfer.\r\nClosely linked to climate change is global food \r\nand energy security. The increase of food and energy \r\nprices due to climate change can be very disturbing \r\nindeed. It has dangerous implications for least \r\ndeveloped countries, which is why they need greater \r\ninternational support for socioeconomic security, for \r\nduty-free and quota-free access of their products to \r\nall markets, for the fulfilment of official development \r\nassistance commitments, for an equal voice in Bretton \r\nWoods institutions and other international financial \r\ninstitutions, and for free movement of labour to all \r\ncountries. In fact, we should immediately implement \r\nMode IV of the General Agreement on Trade in Services \r\nto benefit both sending and receiving countries.\r\nWe should also ensure documentation, safe \r\nmigration and the protection of the rights of migrant \r\nworkers, especially women and children, as a shared \r\nresponsibility of sending and receiving States in the \r\nWorld Trade Organization.\r\nThe blatant injustice perpetrated against, and \r\nmurder, torture and humiliation of the Palestinian \r\npeople by Israel marks a shameful chapter in human \r\nhistory. Deep frustrations at the injustice in Palestine \r\nand in other places also fuel terrorism. It is vital to \r\nresolve the Palestine and similar burning questions \r\nthrough justice and the establishment of democratic \r\nrights.\r\nIn Bangladesh, from 2001 to 2006, an environment of \r\nterrorism prevailed. Under the patronage of the previous \r\nBNP-Jamaat Government, such internationally banned \r\nterrorist outfits as Jama’atul Mujahideen Bangladesh, \r\nHarkatul Jihad, Hizb ut-Tahrir and Lashkar-e-Toiba, \r\namong others, carried out bomb and grenade attacks \r\nwith impunity, every other day, to eliminate the secular \r\nand progressive parties. Prominent instances were the \r\nbomb attacks on four cinemas killing 19 people on \r\n5 December 2002; the grenade attack on the British \r\nHigh Commissioner on 21 May 2004; bomb blasts at \r\n500 places in 63 out of 64 districts within a span of half \r\nan hour on 17 August 2005; grenade and firearm attacks \r\nthat killed former Finance Minister and Executive \r\nDirector of the Economic and Social Commission \r\nfor Asia and the Pacific Mr. S.A.M.S. Kibria, MP, \r\nMr. Ahsanullah Master, MP, Mr. Mumtazuddin, MP, \r\nand two popular judges inside the court premises.\r\nI was myself a target of a grenade attack at a public \r\nmeeting on 21 August 2004, which left 24 people dead \r\nand nearly 500 injured. Somehow, I miraculously \r\nsurvived. Another heinous kind of terrorism that we \r\nexperienced in Bangladesh was the brutal assassination \r\nof my father and the Father of the Nation, Bangabandhu \r\nSheikh Mujibur Rahman, and 18 members of our family \r\non 15 August 1975 by some misguided army personnel \r\nseeking to usurp State power. At that time, I was abroad \r\nwith my sister, Sheikh Rehana, and thus escaped \r\ndeath. In view of our nation’s tragic experiences with \r\n12-52349 7\r\nA/67/PV.14\r\nterrorism, my Government has adopted a firm policy of \r\nzero tolerance of terrorism and all forms of extremism.\r\nI conclude by joining the vast majority of United \r\nNations Members in stressing once again the urgent \r\nneed to reform the United Nations, the Bretton Woods \r\nInstitutions and other international financial institutions. \r\nTheir structures and decision making processes reflect \r\na balance of power that is 60 years old, serving the \r\ninterests of a privileged few and ignoring the large \r\nmajority. The new millennium, with its large number \r\nof independent sovereign States and globalization, \r\nhas ushered in a new world order. Today, we speak \r\nboldly of justice, equality, democracy, freedom, human \r\nrights, environment and the adverse impact of climate \r\nchange, among other things. These are the priorities of \r\nour time, which we must acknowledge in place of the \r\nbitter experiences of the past. The new world order of \r\nnations has to be based on justice, mutual respect and \r\nsovereign equality if we are to evolve towards the world \r\nof peace and hope that we wish to leave to our future \r\ngenerations.\r\nMay Bangladesh live forever! Long live the United \r\nNations!\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of \r\nBangladesh for the statement she has just made.\r\nSheikh Hasina, Prime Minister of the People’s \r\nRepublic of Bangladesh, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum.\r\nMr. Roman-Morey (Peru), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair.\r\nAddress by Ms. Yingluck Shinawatra, Prime \r\nMinister of the Kingdom of Thailand\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of the Kingom of Thailand.\r\nMs. Yingluck Shinawatra, Prime Minister of the \r\nKingdom of Thailand, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I \r\nhave great pleasure in welcoming Her Excellency \r\nMs. Yingluck Shinawatra, Prime Minister of Thailand, \r\nand inviting her to address the General Assembly. \r\nMs. Shinawatra (Thailand): On behalf of the \r\ndelegation of the Kingdom of Thailand, allow me to \r\ncongratulate the President of the General Assembly \r\nupon his election to preside over the Assembly at its \r\nsixty-seventh session.\r\nI would also like to convey our appreciation to the \r\noutgoing President, Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, \r\nfor his outstanding leadership of the General Assembly \r\nduring the previous session.\r\nWe continue to live in challenging times. Much still \r\nneeds to be done to restore stability and confidence in \r\nthe global financial and economic system, and to find \r\nlong-term solutions to the eurozone crisis. The Arab \r\nSpring has taught us that it is very important to listen to \r\nthe voice of the people. The risk of conflict in various \r\nregions around the globe may affect our efforts to \r\npromote peace, prosperity and democracy.\r\nWe have also seen how religious insensitivity and \r\nhate can lead to violence. In the light of this, we need \r\nto promote a culture of tolerance, mutual respect and \r\nunderstanding, both in and among societies. These are \r\nessential factors to prevent conflict and promote lasting \r\npeace.\r\nIn our efforts to promote lasting peace and security, \r\nwe are confronted with a wide range of threats, both \r\nold and new. It is therefore necessary for us to seek \r\ninnovative solutions and new thinking. We need strong \r\nleadership, political will and good global governance. \r\nIt is imperative that we settle international disputes \r\nby peaceful means. But even beyond that, we need to \r\nthink in terms of preventive and preemptive actions to \r\nprevent such disputes from arising in the first place. \r\nMost important, we have to think in terms of promoting \r\ninclusive and comprehensive peace and development, \r\nboth within and among countries. Peace, security and \r\ndevelopment are all interconnected.\r\nEconomic development must go hand in hand \r\nwith political advancement. Here, I would like to \r\nemphasize three points. First, an inclusive national \r\ndevelopment strategy is vital. During this period of \r\neconomic uncertainty, we must not consider economic \r\ngrowth alone. It is important to put people front and \r\ncentre in the development agenda. Sustainable growth \r\nand development, job creation, promoting poverty \r\nreduction and equality and addressing climate change \r\nmust go hand in hand. That is what every Government \r\nshould do — put people at the heart of the country’s \r\neconomic development strategy — because we believe \r\nthat the greatest asset of any country is the people, and \r\nhow much a country can excel depends on how much its \r\npeople can fully realize their potential.\r\n8 12-52349\r\nA/67/PV.14\r\ncommon security and stability. We must work closely \r\nwith our friends in each region to strengthen their \r\ncapacities in meeting their development goals. We \r\nbelieve that the peace and prosperity of our neighbours \r\nis that of our own. That is particularly relevant in the \r\ncurrent case of Myanmar during the critical period of \r\ntransition towards greater democracy, which Thailand \r\nfully supports. We must all work together as partners \r\nto help Myanmar continue in its process of change. We \r\nwill all benefit from that economic cooperation and \r\nintegration.\r\nWe live in a world of increasing interconnectivity, \r\nbut our peoples continue to face insecurity from cross-\r\nborder challenges. In this age of globalization, the \r\nconcept of security must be people-centred. Therefore, \r\ntransnational challenges — from people smuggling to \r\nhuman trafficking, from narcotics to pandemics, from \r\nnatural disasters to illegal trade in arms and materials \r\nfor weapons of mass destruction — must rank high \r\non our national agenda. The international community \r\nshould redouble its collective effort to act forcefully \r\nagainst transnational crimes that exist in a world of \r\nincreased interconnectivity.\r\nOne of the worst forms of human indignity is \r\nhuman trafficking. I consider that inhumane form of \r\nexploitation to be a matter of national priority and am \r\nfully committed to eliminating it.. Whether it is human \r\ntrafficking or other transnational crimes, the key is \r\nto ensure that the rule of law prevails and the basic \r\nrights of peoples are guaranteed. Vulnerable groups, \r\nsuch as women, children, the elderly and people with \r\ndisabilities, in particular deserve our attention.\r\nSolutions to those challenges cannot be achieved \r\nby Governments alone. We need to work with all \r\nstakeholders, especially in strengthening international \r\nnorms and standards. Through the United Nations, we \r\nneed to promote the rule of law as a solid foundation to \r\nachieve peace, international security, human rights and \r\nsustainable development.\r\nWe are committed to promoting peace and \r\nprosperity within countries and internationally, but, \r\nultimately, the process must begin at home. It can best \r\nbe accomplished by providing space for all within \r\na democratic framework and promoting national \r\nreconciliation. Above all else, we must think in terms of \r\npartnership and work together as responsible members \r\nof the international community.\r\nSecondly, an inclusive regional development is the \r\nway forward and would help strengthen the fabric of \r\nregional peace and security. Thailand strongly believes \r\nthat we and our neighbours in the region have a shared \r\nobjective. We have a shared interest in fostering common \r\npeace and prosperity. We need to therefore strive to \r\nprosper together because only by working together can \r\nwe create a much-needed synergy that would support \r\nour common development. That will also help limit the \r\nchance of conflict.\r\nIn South-East Asia, that is the spirit that drives the \r\n10 States members of the Association of Southeast Asian \r\nNations (ASEAN) to establish an ASEAN Community \r\nby the year 2015. As ASEAN moves towards greater \r\nintegration, great efforts are being made to close \r\ndevelopment gaps and expand connectivity across \r\nSouth-East Asia and beyond to the wider East Asia \r\nand South Asia. That would help spread development \r\nand growth more broadly across the continent. And as \r\neconomic activities become more concentrated in East \r\nAsia, that closer integration and expanded connectivity, \r\ntogether with an expanding region-wide network of free \r\ntrade agreements, will further strengthen the resilience \r\nof East Asia, create greater opportunities and unleash \r\nthe full potential of this promising region.\r\nThirdly, an inclusive process at the global level \r\nis crucial as the international community considers \r\nthe post-2015 development agenda. The Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) have been an important \r\ntool that resulted in better livelihoods for millions of \r\npeople. With 2015 fast approaching, the international \r\ncommunity should mobilize an all-out effort to make \r\nthe final push in realizing those MDGs. \r\nAt the same time, it is important to prepare beyond \r\n2015. The successes and failures of the implementation \r\nof the MDGs should be taken into account as the \r\ninternational community starts to frame the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda or the sustainable development \r\ngoals. The process towards that end should be as \r\ninclusive as possible to ensure that the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda will enjoy the broadest possible \r\nsupport and ownership of the international community. \r\nThailand will play an active and constructive role in \r\nthat process because development is an issue close to \r\nour heart.\r\nIn this age of globalization, the concept of absolute \r\nsecurity has become obsolete. Peace can never be \r\nachieved in isolation. We can only seek peace through \r\n12-52349 9\r\nA/67/PV.14\r\nAddress by Mr. Gordon Darcy Lilo, Prime \r\nMinister of Solomon Islands\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of Solomon Islands.\r\nMr. Gordon Darcy Lilo, Prime Minister of Solomon \r\nIslands, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have great pleasure \r\nin welcoming Mr. Gordon Darcy Lilo, Prime Minister \r\nof Solomon Islands, and inviting him to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMr. Lilo (Solomon Islands): I wish to congratulate \r\nMr. Vuk Jeremić on his election as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. I also \r\ncommend his predecessor, Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz \r\nAl-Nasser of Qatar, for his fine leadership during the \r\nlast session. In addition, I thank the Secretary-General, \r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon, for his tireless efforts in advancing \r\nsecurity, development and human rights, the three \r\npillars of the United Nations Charter.\r\nGlobal security remains a serious challenge \r\ntoday. States are increasing their military capabilities \r\nand arms sales have tripled in the last year and are \r\nreaching record levels. Closer to home, in the Asia-\r\nPacific region, new Cold War lines are being drawn \r\nand low-intensity territorial disputes are brewing. That \r\nsituation provides the option of unilateral action, which \r\nundermines the rule of law at the international level. \r\nThose challenges now demand an effective multilateral \r\ninstitution that responds meaningfully in real time to \r\nuphold the rule of law. In that regard, Solomon Islands \r\nwelcomes this year’s theme on adjustment or settlement \r\nof international disputes or situations by peaceful \r\nmeans. It is our desire that States that find themselves \r\nin international disputes adhere to the rule of law and \r\nwork towards ensuring global peace.\r\nSolomon Islands emerged from an internal conflict \r\nsome 10 years ago. A regional peace initiative known \r\nas the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands \r\n(RAMSI) has helped restore law and order and created \r\nan environment for nation-building and development. \r\nOur gratitude goes out to all our regional neighbours.\r\nA national truth and reconciliation commission that \r\nwas set up in 2009 to investigate the causes of the conflict \r\nWorking through the United Nations, we need \r\nto reach out to people who have been denied their \r\nlegitimate rights and aspirations. It is in that spirit that \r\nthe Royal Thai Government established diplomatic \r\nrelations with the State of Palestine on 1 August 2012, \r\nin the hope that both Israel and Palestine can achieve \r\ntrue and lasting peace based on a two-State solution.\r\nElsewhere in the Middle East, the situation in Syria \r\ncontinues to worsen. Thailand is deeply concerned \r\nabout the humanitarian impact of violence against \r\ncivilians and strongly condemns such violence. We \r\ncall for an immediate end to the use of force against \r\ncivilians. We call for all sides to engage in dialogue \r\ntowards a political solution, which can be achieved only \r\nby the efforts of the Syrian people themselves.\r\nIn the quest for peace and security, we believe it \r\nis necessary to continually look beyond our borders. \r\nThailand wishes to reaffirm our commitment to \r\npeacekeeping in difficult times as necessary. From \r\nTimor-Leste to Haiti to Darfur and in the Gulf of Aden, \r\nThailand’s peacekeeping operations also assist in local \r\nand community development, sharing our best practices \r\nin agriculture, health and water resource management.\r\nIn sum, Thailand has continued to engage with the \r\ninternational community across all three pillars of the \r\nUnited Nations: peace and security, development and \r\nhuman rights. The management of those interconnected \r\nissues will provide us with long-term solutions, not only \r\nfor conflict resolution via peaceful means, but also for \r\nways to prevent conflicts from arising altogether.\r\nI assure the Assembly that Thailand will continue \r\nto be a strong partner of the United Nations in helping \r\nto address those shared challenges of humankind. \r\nIt is with that conviction that we have submitted our \r\ncandidature as a non-permanent member of the Security \r\nCouncil for the term 2017-2018.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the Prime \r\nMinister of the Kingdom of Thailand for the statement \r\nshe has just made.\r\nMs. Yingluck Shinawatra, Prime Minister of the \r\nKingdom of Thailand, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum.\r\n10 12-52349\r\nA/67/PV.14\r\nsubmitted its report early this year. The Commission \r\nhas facilitated the national reconciliation and healing \r\nprocess, and the Government has established a working \r\ngroup to carefully consider the recommendations in the \r\nreport.\r\nSolomon Islands commends the General Assembly \r\nfor convening the High-level Meeting on the Rule of \r\nLaw at the National and International Levels this week. \r\nThe rule of law is fundamental in guiding the conduct \r\nof actors and addressing the realities within national \r\nand international jurisdictions.\r\nSince regaining peace and stability, Solomon \r\nIslands has achieved some social and economic \r\nprogress. For example, economically, the country has \r\nenjoyed steady growth in the last five years. External \r\nreserves continue to improve and, as of February 2012, \r\nthey stand at 10 months import cover. In addition, \r\nSolomon Islands is one of the 11 countries identified \r\nby the World Bank in 2012 as having most improved \r\nthe ease of doing business in the country across several \r\nareas of regulation. An economic core working group \r\nhas also been established to coordinate donor assistance \r\nand is playing an important role in public finance \r\nreforms, including debt management, and in creating \r\nfiscal buffers that enable us to cushion external shocks.\r\nIn the health sector, I am pleased to report that we \r\nhave almost eradicated malaria from two of our nine \r\nprovinces. Infant mortality has significantly decreased \r\nfrom 80 to 35 per 1,000 live births, and the maternal \r\nmortality rate has also decreased from 500 to 200 \r\ndeaths per 100,000 live births. The Government and \r\nits development partners continue to fund medical and \r\nhealth centres to deliver the services needed by our \r\npeople.\r\nMajor improvements in the law and order situation \r\nhave resulted in the reduction of major crimes and \r\ncreated a safer environment in the country. We have \r\nalso successfully hosted a number of international \r\nevents, such as the Oceania football tournament of the \r\nInternational Federation of Association Football, the \r\nFestival of Pacific Arts and recently the visit by the \r\nDuke and Duchess of Cambridge. We have regained \r\nour image of the country known as the happy isles in \r\nthe Pacific.\r\nAs part of our efforts to address governance \r\nissues, Solomon Islands has intensified its national \r\nconsultations to determine the appropriate mechanisms \r\nto improve political integrity and stability. National \r\nconsultations have been conducted to obtain feedback \r\nfrom the community on the required institutions and \r\nprocesses. Strengthening governance is expensive and \r\nneeds international partnership. I take this opportunity \r\nto thank the Department of Political Affairs for its \r\nassistance towards our electoral reforms.\r\nAfter almost 10 years, RAMSI is now in its \r\ntransitional phase. The Government is working closely \r\nwith the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands \r\nto ensure a smooth transition as the responsibility for \r\nsecurity and development is placed back in the hands of \r\nthe Government and community. My Government will \r\nengage with various stakeholders, including United \r\nNations bodies, to consolidate the gains that have been \r\nmade so far and in building a resilient State.\r\nSolomon Islands continues to strengthen its \r\nrelationship with the United Nations. This year we \r\nopened a second diplomatic Permanent Mission in \r\nGeneva. We are also pleased to see that the World Health \r\nOrganization office in Honiara has been upgraded from \r\na liaison office to the level of resident representative. We \r\nrequest the United Nations Development Programme \r\n(UNDP) to follow suit. I believe a stronger United \r\nNations presence at the country level will further \r\nenhance understanding of the country’s development \r\npriorities and challenges. The United Nations will only \r\nbe strengthened with a secretariat that represents the \r\ndiversity of its membership.\r\nSolomon Islands recognizes the sovereignty, \r\nindependence and territorial integrity of Fiji. \r\nWe will continue to dialogue with Fiji and call on \r\nthe region and the international community to support \r\nFiji’s “Engaging with the Pacific” process and its road \r\nmap to the 2014 general elections. We welcome Fiji’s \r\ncommitment to hold its general elections in 2014.\r\nSolomon Islands has also strengthened its mediating \r\nrole at the subregional level through the Melanesian \r\nSpearhead Group (MSG). The MSG is made up of Fiji, \r\nPapua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and the \r\nFront de libération nationale kanak socialiste. Within \r\nthe MSG secretariat, a peacekeeping unit has been \r\nestablished. However, Solomon Islands and the other \r\nMSG members believe that the United Nations remains \r\nthe bedrock of international peace and security.\r\nThe promotion of human rights is fundamental \r\nto creating a culture of peace and security. Solomon \r\nIslands welcomes the ongoing intergovernmental \r\nprocess to strengthen the effectiveness of human rights \r\n12-52349 11\r\nA/67/PV.14\r\nthe country. We have done this by unlocking domestic \r\nand regional resources through the establishment of a \r\ndebt strategy in partnership with the private sector and \r\nthe Asian Development Bank.\r\nFurthermore, we are taking steps to maximize \r\nreturns from our natural resources. As a party to the \r\nNauru Agreement, we have closed off pockets of high \r\nseas between our exclusive economic zones in a bid \r\nto protect and manage fish stocks. In that regard, we \r\nhave adopted the Vessel Day Scheme to guarantee an \r\nequitable share of benefits. We hold the position that the \r\nScheme must be embodied in bilateral and multilateral \r\nfisheries agreements. We call on all distant-water \r\nfishing nations to respect that principled position.\r\nIn the mining sector, we are now a member of the \r\nExtractive Industries Transparency Initiative, and we \r\ncontinue to develop policy and translate it into local laws \r\nand regulations. Mining presents a major opportunity \r\nto broaden our economic base. In that regard, we will \r\nbe granting mining leases to a major nickel-mining \r\ncompany before the end of the year. It is estimated that \r\nthe company will produce around 69,000 tons per year \r\nand generate significant job opportunities.\r\nAt the United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (Rio+20), we charted a new course to \r\ndevelop an improved paradigm for advancing and \r\nmeasuring the three pillars of sustainable development. \r\nThe full and timely implementation of the Rio+20 \r\noutcome (resolution 66/288, annex) is crucial. As we \r\napproach 2015, we must accelerate efforts to achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goal targets in the remaining \r\nthree years.\r\nSolomon Islands is implementing its national \r\ndevelopment strategy for the period 2011-2020. \r\nWe call on our development partners to align their \r\nassistance with the priorities that are contained in our \r\nnational development strategy. The proposed post-\r\n2015 development agenda must take into account any \r\nshortcomings in the implementation of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, and the sustainable development \r\ngoals must be viable economically, community-based \r\nand time-bound. We look forward to working with \r\nthe experts who will be establishing the framework. \r\nSolomon Islands is pleased to be one of the 50 countries \r\nthat UNDP will consult in developing the post-2015 \r\nglobal development agenda. We request that this \r\nconsultation process also mainstream issues of concern \r\nto small island developing States into the agenda \r\ntreaty institutions during this session. We recognize the \r\nuniversality of human rights and call for the elimination \r\nof double standards and the politicization of human \r\nrights violations.\r\nOn the situation in the Middle East, I believe \r\nthe United Nations is uniquely placed to provide a \r\ncomprehensive solution to the region’s complex issues, \r\nincluding the current situation in Syria. It is a region that \r\ndeserves freedom, democracy and long-term security. \r\nSolomon Islands continues to support the work of the \r\nQuartet and the good offices of the Secretary-General \r\nin defusing tensions and advancing political discussion \r\non a two-State solution for Israel and Palestine.\r\nThere is no justification for the killing of innocent \r\ncivilians, wherever it may occur. We therefore join \r\nthe international community in expressing our deep \r\nconcern about the sad events in Benghazi. \r\nWith respect to Non-Self-Governing Territories in \r\nthe Pacific, Solomon Islands supports New Caledonia’s \r\naspirations to self-determination. I wish to inform \r\nthe Assembly that, last month, members of the MSG \r\nundertook a second ministerial visit to the territory \r\nto monitor progress under the Noumea Accord. We \r\nencourage all efforts to enable the Kanaks to assume \r\nleadership in determining their future. Solomon Islands \r\nalso joins its regional neighbours in supporting the \r\nreinscription of French Polynesia in the list of countries \r\nto be decolonized. We also support other peoples \r\nwithin the Asia-Pacific region that aspire for self-\r\ndetermination and independence.\r\n I welcome the work done by the General Assembly \r\non strengthening the smooth transition process for \r\ncountries graduating from the group of least developed \r\ncountries. In working towards graduating from the \r\ngroup, we are embarking on a number of development \r\ninitiatives. Under the Istanbul Programme of Action, \r\nSolomon Islands is pursuing three high-value national \r\ninvestments. First, with support from New Zealand, a \r\nsecond international airport is being constructed in the \r\nwestern part of our country. Secondly, the submarine \r\nfibre-optic cable project is expected to go on line by \r\n2014. Thirdly, Solomon Islands is in the process of \r\nestablishing two tertiary universities, the Solomon \r\nIslands National University and the University of South \r\nPacific Solomon Islands Campus. \r\nThose national projects place Solomon Islands on \r\na path to transforming its economy and ensuring that \r\ninclusive and equitable economic growth takes root in \r\n12 12-52349\r\nA/67/PV.14\r\nits aspiration to be a member of the International \r\nCivil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change \r\n(UNFCCC). Although not a member of ICAO, Taiwan \r\nmanages more than 1 million f lights and 40 million \r\npassengers per annum. Similarly, Taiwan is the twenty-\r\nsecond-largest emitter of greenhouse gas, but it is not \r\na member of UNFCCC. I firmly believe that it is our \r\nshared responsibility to engage Taiwan in our efforts to \r\nadvance sustainable development and address climate \r\nchange.\r\nWith regard to Cuba, I thank the Government and \r\npeople of Cuba for the support they have provided to \r\nthe medical students of Solomon Islands. We join the \r\ninternational community in calling for the immediate \r\nlifting of the United States economic and trade embargo \r\nagainst Cuba. Solomon Islands encourages the United \r\nStates to respect the principle of good-neighbourliness.\r\nFinally, with regard to gender equality and the \r\nempowerment of women, I would like to thank Member \r\nStates for their confidence in electing Solomon Islands \r\nto the Executive Board of UN-Women. I also welcome \r\nthe call by the Secretary-General to convene the World \r\nConference on Women in 2015. Solomon Islands further \r\nacknowledges the $320 million in regional assistance \r\nfrom Australia to support gender programmes for \r\nPacific island countries. Women play a very important \r\nrole as peacemakers and leaders in Solomon Islands \r\nsociety. Our gender challenge has grown with time. \r\nToday we have national gender programmes that \r\nsupport empowerment. We look forward to working \r\nclosely with Australia and the other Board members in \r\nadvancing the cause of women and girls.\r\nSolomon Islands is committed to working closely \r\nwith the President in establishing an inclusive, \r\ntransparent and effective multilateral system. I would \r\nalso like to assure him of our support for our common \r\nendeavour to build a peaceful and secure world for our \r\nchildren and future generations.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPrime Minister of Solomon Islands for the statement he \r\nhas just made.\r\nMr. Gordon Darcy Lilo, Prime Minister of Solomon \r\nIslands, was escorted from the rostrum. \r\nof the 2014 Global Conference on the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States.\r\nI join my colleagues in the Alliance of Small Island \r\nStates in reiterating that climate change is an urgent \r\nand irreversible threat to humanity. Solomon Islands is \r\ndeeply troubled by the current low ambition level of the \r\npledges by developed countries. There is a discrepancy \r\nbetween what has been pledged and what is necessary to \r\nstabilize temperature decrease. That means mitigation \r\nmust be prioritized at the eighteenth ordinary meeting \r\nof the Conference of the Parties to the Convention \r\non Biological Diversity in Doha and greenhouse-gas \r\nemission levels meaningfully decreased. We need to \r\nhave certainty that we are working towards a temperature \r\nincrease of no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius, and not \r\n3 to 5 degrees Celsius, in order to ensure the survival, \r\nviability and sustainable development of small island \r\ndeveloping States and least developed countries. \r\nWe deeply regret that some countries have opted \r\nout of the Kyoto Protocol, some have refused to take \r\na second commitment and others have remained \r\nundecided on taking a second commitment.\r\nHowever, at the national level I am pleased to \r\nannounce that, in June, Solomon Islands launched its \r\nnational climate change policy, which mainstreams \r\nclimate change into all sectors of the country. Solomon \r\nIslands is a country with rich biological and cultural \r\ndiversity. It is a member of the Coral Triangle Initiative \r\non coral reefs, fisheries and food security. This year, 22 \r\nPacific Island countries and territories came together \r\nin Solomon Islands to showcase their cultural diversity \r\nand heritage. The region has indigenous biological and \r\ncultural diversity, which makes it an indigenous and \r\nbiocultural hot spot. That hot spot remains fragile and \r\nexposed to threats and needs international support. We \r\nwill be seeking ways and means of having that initiative \r\nfeatured on the global agenda.\r\nThe reform of the Security Council must keep pace \r\nwith the changing global realities. We support the call \r\nto make the Security Council more representative, \r\nrelevant and effective. After four sessions, we are \r\nconcerned about the slow progress of negotiations and \r\nhope to see progress during this session.\r\nMy Government recognizes Taiwan’s f lexible, \r\nmoderate and rational foreign policy, which continues \r\nto promote friendly cross-Strait relations. Solomon \r\nIslands continues to support Taiwan’s meaningful \r\nparticipation in the United Nations system, including \r\n12-52349 13\r\nA/67/PV.14\r\nSadly, there are forces at work in the world that \r\nwish to drag humankind to the brink of the precipice, \r\nto kindle the f lames of hostility wherever they go. \r\nOne glaring example is the video Innocence of \r\nMuslims, which symbolically appeared on the eve of \r\nthe General Assembly session. Kyrgyzstan condemns \r\nthe provocative nature of its content. It is unacceptable \r\nto insult anyone’s religious sensibilities, regardless of \r\ntheir faith. Humanism, tolerance and mutual respect \r\nmake the world better and safer. Therefore, we also \r\nreject the use of force against diplomats — envoys of \r\npeace and a symbol of cooperation — of any country.\r\nHumankind is developing and changing fast. \r\nRegional, and even local, events can impact on global \r\nprocesses. In 2011, we observed with sympathy and \r\nsolidarity the events in the Middle East and North Africa. \r\nThe situation in Syria that we have seen this year can \r\nonly be a cause of serious concern for the international \r\ncommunity. All attempts to resolve the military conflict \r\nand restore stability to that county have, sadly, failed. \r\nWith regard to the thousands of civilian victims, the \r\nKyrgyz Republic strongly advocates a speedy end to the \r\nviolence in that country, the opening of a broad national \r\ndialogue between the political forces and a continuation \r\nof political and socioeconomic reform and participation \r\nof all Syrian citizens. \r\nThe Afghan factor continues to be a source of \r\nthreat to international security. There are concerns that \r\na full, swift drawdown of coalition forces could open \r\nthe way for destructive forces and the emergence of \r\nvarious extremist and terrorist groups in neighbouring \r\ncountries. Every stakeholder in the world can make \r\na contribution to the issue of security by reviving \r\nAfghanistan’s economy and developing trade, economic, \r\ncultural and humanitarian ties with the country, as well \r\nas its communication infrastructure. \r\nSince 2001 Kyrgyzstan has played its part in that \r\nprocess, rendering assistance to the counter-terrorist \r\ncoalition in Afghanistan through the cargo Transit \r\nCenter at Manas International Airport. It is clear that \r\nthe counter-terrorist coalition, with the withdrawal \r\nof the military contingent from Afghanistan, must \r\nbring its mission to a logical conclusion to create the \r\nfoundation of a national administrative system for \r\nthat country so that all branches of power can be fully \r\nfunctional throughout the territory of Afghanistan. \r\nWe must do our utmost for the economic \r\nrehabilitation of Afghanistan by engaging it in the \r\nAddress by Mr. Asylbek Jeenbekov, Speaker of \r\nthe Parliament of the Kyrgyz Republic\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Speaker of \r\nthe Parliament of the Kyrgyz Republic.\r\nMr. Asylbek Jeenbekov, Speaker of the Parliament \r\nof the Kyrgyz Republic, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I \r\nhave great pleasure in welcoming His Excellency \r\nMr. Asylbek Jeenbekov, Speaker of the Parliament of \r\nthe Kyrgyz Republic, and inviting him to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMr. Jeenbekov (Kyrgyzstan) (spoke in Russian): \r\nFirst of all, let me congratulate His Excellency Mr. Vuk \r\nJeremić on his election as President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-seventh session, I wish him \r\nevery success in carrying out his important functions. \r\nIt is also a great pleasure to express my gratitude to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser for \r\nhis successful, fruitful leadership of the work of the \r\nAssembly’s previous session. \r\nIt would be difficult to say that the overall situation \r\nin the world has improved. We have not yet fully \r\nrecovered from one of the most serious global economic \r\ncrises in the past 65 years. Yes, the overall economic \r\nsituation is gradually normalizing. Proof of that is the \r\nimproving forecasts for world economic growth by key \r\ninternational organizations for this year. However, we \r\nshould point out that risks remain and that the recovery \r\nprocess is still very uncertain. \r\nIt is unfortunate that the world has not become \r\nany safer. We are seeing a rise in confrontations and \r\ntension in various parts of the world. Global climate \r\nchange, population growth against the background of \r\na deteriorating environment, the scarcity of natural \r\nresources and of access to drinking water, and many \r\nother problems are in the aggregate stoking tensions \r\nand the potential for conflict in areas of cooperation on \r\nthe international arena. \r\nTraditional ways of life are changing fast under the \r\nimpact of globalization processes. States are finding \r\nit increasingly hard to tackle modern challenges by \r\nthemselves because of the transborder nature of those \r\nchallenges. Terrorism, separatism, extremism, drugs, \r\ninformation wars — these are a kind of tumour for \r\nhumankind and cannot be eradicated at the local level \r\nalone. \r\n14 12-52349\r\nA/67/PV.14\r\nrequire serious transformation and integration of \r\nfundamentally new approaches.\r\nIn terms of the reform of the United Nations, we \r\npropose the expansion of the membership of the Security \r\nCouncil to make it more representative, transparent and \r\ndemocratic. The reform should be based on principles \r\nof universality, efficiency and broad geographic \r\nrepresentation, particularly for those countries that \r\nhave not yet had the chance to take part in its work as \r\nnon-permanent members.\r\nAt the same time, we need to strengthen the \r\ncoordinating role of the Economic and Social Council \r\nas a global governance mechanism on issues of \r\nsustainable development, food security, humanitarian \r\nassistance, environmental cooperation and achievement \r\nof the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by the \r\n2015 deadline. \r\nThe current global situation dictates the need \r\nto consolidate the efforts of all countries to develop \r\ntangible action based on objective, fair reflection of \r\ntheir interests and needs. On that basis, the Kyrgyz \r\nRepublic has submitted its candidature for the Economic \r\nand Social Council for the period 2013-2015. If elected \r\nby Member States to that organ with such enormous \r\npotential, the Kyrgyz Republic intends to play its part \r\nin tackling problems on the global agenda.\r\nThe problems of sustainable development \r\nand global climate change have presented serious \r\nchallenges in recent years, and the attention of \r\nthe international community must not slacken. In \r\nsupporting the global discussions on a green economy \r\nmodel that took place at the Rio+20 Conference on \r\nSustainable Development, Kyrgyzstan chose its future \r\npath towards long-term sustainable green development \r\nand an environment-minded economy. We would like \r\nto confirm our commitment to developing our economy \r\nthrough complying with requirements to protect our \r\nenvironment and with a safe approach to national \r\nresources, which are a national asset.\r\nAt Rio+20, the importance of development issues \r\nconcerning mountainous areas was acknowledged with \r\nregard to managing global natural resources, as was \r\nthe need for support for the sustainable development \r\nof mountain regions in developing countries. It should \r\nbe noted that despite the assistance of the international \r\nfinancial institutions, developing mountain States \r\ncontinue to suffer difficulties. High levels of poverty \r\nand isolation, increasing transport costs and large \r\ndevelopment of regional cooperation and implementing \r\njoint socioeconomic projects between international \r\norganizations and financial institutions. In that regard, \r\nKyrgyzstan is ready to expand trade and economic \r\nties to export electricity to Afghanistan as part of the \r\nCASA-1000 project, with the support of donor countries \r\nand the international financial institutions.\r\nThe peaceful development of Afghanistan is \r\nimpossible without eradicating the systemic, ubiquitous \r\ncultivation of opium in that country. For many years \r\nAfghanistan has been the biggest producer and exporter \r\nof drugs. The growing penetration of that deadly crop is \r\nharming the countries of Central Asia. Not only are they \r\non the northern transit route towards the countries of \r\nEurope and Asia, they are also progressively becoming \r\nconsumers. \r\nDrugs are the enemy of civilized humankind. Where \r\nthere are drugs, there are international organized crime \r\ngroups and transborder challenges. Easy money earned \r\nat the cost of people’s lives has no productive basis. It \r\nbrings destruction and the degradation of human value. \r\nDrugs also spawn corruption and erode State systems \r\nfrom the inside. Criminal proceeds are used to bribe \r\nlaw enforcement bodies and the judiciary. They fund \r\ncorrupt politicians who seek power. The international \r\ncommunity must provide technical, economic and \r\nother support to Afghanistan’s neighbours, including \r\nthe Central Asian countries, to build an effective \r\nshield to neutralize and localize drug trafficking from \r\nAfghanistan.\r\nWe believe that the mission of the United Nations, \r\nas the single universal multilateral Organization, is to \r\nbe on the front line in tackling all modern challenges \r\nand issues.\r\nWe should recognize that the global prevention \r\narchitecture, the international and regional security \r\nsystem of today, does not reflect the requirements of \r\nour time. It is unfortunate that despite the search for \r\nuniversal methods for mediation and peaceful conflict \r\nresolution, the international community still has not \r\nresolved those issues.\r\nThe need to reform the United Nations architecture \r\nand adapt it to the realities of the modern international \r\nsituation has not abated. A top priority is the reform \r\nof principal organs of the United Nations, namely, the \r\nSecurity Council and the Economic and Social Council. \r\nWe should point out that the tasks of those structures, \r\nin the light of the current international situation, \r\n12-52349 15\r\nA/67/PV.14\r\nmigration grew. One third of the working population \r\nwas forced to find employment abroad. We were left \r\nwith ineffective public administration institutions, \r\nlow per-capita income, a reduced budget, rampant \r\ncorruption and organized crime, as well as unhampered \r\ndrug-trafficking from Afghanistan to the north, east \r\nand west. \r\nCurrently, we are waging an uncompromising \r\nstruggle against the corruption that is wearing away the \r\nState system from within. Civil servants who are found \r\nto be involved in corruption are being prosecuted under \r\nthe law. In modern Kyrgyzstan, there will be no caste \r\nof those whom the law does not touch.\r\nThe battle against corruption is already seeing \r\ntangible results. Senior State officials under \r\ninvestigation have been arrested, including members \r\nof Parliament, ministers, their deputies and others. \r\nLeaders of organized crime groups are either in prison \r\nor on the run outside of the country.\r\nWe are determined to extradite for prosecution \r\nthose people for whom international warrants have \r\nbeen issued. In the name of fairness, the former leaders \r\nof Kyrgyzstan, who have taken shelter in neighbouring \r\ncountries along with their inner circle, must be \r\nsanctioned in strict compliance with Kyrgyz legislation. \r\nKyrgyzstan stresses that they are being prosecuted not \r\nfor politically motivated acts, but for specific crimes \r\npunishable by law. They gave the orders to open fire on \r\npeaceful civilians and to destroy innocent people. They \r\npillaged their own people and the country’s budget and \r\ntook enormous financial assets out of the country. They \r\nhave used criminal gains to buy villas, land and other \r\ncostly material goods. In such issues, punishment must \r\nbe just and inevitable so as to deter future leaders from \r\nrepeating such actions. \r\nTherefore, we still hope that the Byelorussian \r\nauthorities, partners of ours in the Collective Security \r\nTreaty Organization and the Eurasian Economic Union \r\nand who have assumed responsibilities under the Minsk \r\nand Kishinev Conventions, will show their commitment \r\nto their international legal obligations and extradite \r\nthe relatives and the retinue of the former President of \r\nKyrgyzstan, Kurmanbek Bakiyev, who have been hiding \r\nin their territory and even have Byelorussian passports. \r\nThe United Nations needs to establish clear standards \r\nand procedures to ensure justice at the international \r\nlevel, and especially for the return of illegally gained \r\nassets.\r\nforeign debts comprise the main problems facing \r\nmountain countries. In that situation, it will be difficult \r\nto achieve the MDGs and attain the status set out in the \r\nUnited Nations documents on sustainable development. \r\nIn that respect, I wish to call attention to the \r\nimportance of the launching of international discussions \r\non the question of exchanging Kyrgyzstan’s foreign \r\ndebt for sustainable development projects. We call on \r\nthe United Nations and its entities to render support on \r\nthat matter.\r\nBy the will of God, we gained independence 21 \r\nyears ago. Previous leaders were unable to cope with \r\nthe task of building a truly independent Kyrgyzstan. \r\nThey could not build an effective, transparent State \r\nsystem for governing that would work for the benefit of \r\nthe people. Most of the important issues were tackled \r\nbehind closed doors, without informing society. For \r\nthe sake of personal enrichment and gain, some State \r\ndecisions were even taken to the detriment of national \r\ninterests. \r\nThe former Kyrgyz leaders declared a course for \r\ndemocracy that in fact did not take place. The former \r\nregimes established a clan-like system of governance \r\nthat f louted the principles of a free society and usurped \r\npower. They not only attempted to hand power down \r\nto their children, but brought the people to their knees \r\nmerely for the sake of their personal enrichment. The \r\nfreedom-loving people of Kyrgyzstan therefore carried \r\nout two revolutions, in 2005 and 2010, in response to \r\nthe unjust, tyrannical and authoritarian power.\r\nThe latest choice has proved a difficult one for our \r\npeople, despite our commitment to democratic values, \r\nwhich is almost hard-wired in the Kyrgyz people, part \r\nof their very heritage. Over 100 glorious sons of our \r\ncountry laid down their lives for democracy during the \r\nApril revolution of 2010. Their memory lives on. Also, \r\n1,500 people were injured. \r\nOver the past two years, our country has begun to \r\nimplement new, democratic governance. The Kyrgyz \r\npeople have chosen a parliamentary, presidential form \r\nof governance. We believe that was a just decision. \r\nAccording to impartial observers, our country has \r\nmade significant progress during the past year in terms \r\nof building a democratic State. \r\nWe began under difficult conditions. In the years \r\nof independence in Kyrgyzstan, industry virtually \r\nground to a halt. No new jobs were created. Labour \r\n16 12-52349\r\nA/67/PV.14\r\nKyrgyzstan is steadfastly building a parliamentary \r\ndemocracy, a direct authority that represents the \r\npeople, their wishes and their needs. At present, there \r\nare processes in place that are gradually bringing our \r\nsociety to a healthy state. Today, Parliament is engaged in \r\npolitical processes. Gradually, polemics and arguments \r\nare transitioning from street democracy to a civilized \r\nform for resolving any significant controversial issues \r\nwithin the walls of Parliament. Under the national \r\nConstitution, the Kyrgyz Parliament is the highest \r\nrepresentative body, carrying out the functions of \r\nlegislative authority and control. The Government is \r\nfully accountable to the Parliament. \r\nA major test, and at the same time an indicator, is the \r\nfact that since the adoption of the new Constitution in \r\n2011, we have seen the peaceful launch of all institutions \r\nof authority in accordance with the letter of the law. The \r\nmembers of Parliament have been elected. At the end of \r\n2011 we saw, for the first time in Kyrgyzstan’s history, \r\na peaceful transfer of power from the President to the \r\nnewly elected Head of State, Almazbek Atambayev. A \r\nfunctioning coalition Government is in place. \r\nWe are reforming the judicial system, which must \r\nbe equitable and fully independent. Despite strong \r\nopposition from certain quarters who are not interested \r\nin seeing the successful conclusion of that issue, \r\nwe have, in the space of two years, launched a new, \r\ntransparent mechanism for the selection of judges. In \r\nmid-September, the Parliament approved the 25 judges \r\nof the Supreme Court. The selection of judges to the \r\nConstitutional Court and local courts is also under way. \r\nThe establishment of an independent judiciary \r\nis extremely important for us. It will allow us to \r\nachieve a just public administration in which every \r\ncitizen will be equal before the law. We are working \r\neffectively with the Office of the United Nations High \r\nCommissioner for Human Rights and other agencies on \r\nthe legal system and on improving legislation to ensure \r\neveryone’s equality before the law. \r\nWith the participation of the Parliament, the \r\ncountry has undertaken planning and reforms in all \r\nspheres of the State system — in the justice system, \r\nlaw enforcement, taxation, oversight and others. All of \r\nthat requires stronger legislation. Kyrgyzstan is taking \r\nits first steps in the new format of a parliamentary \r\nrepublic. Sustainable development depends on the level \r\nof governance, on the rule of law and on human rights. \r\nWe believe in the bright future of our country and that \r\nvery soon all our countrymen will be able to say with \r\npride that they are the citizens of a strong, prosperous \r\nKyrgyzstan. \r\n(spoke in Kyrgyz; interpretation provided by the \r\ndelegation) \r\nOne can more clearly see the sanctity of our \r\nfatherland and our true values of independence from afar.\r\nI would like to appeal to my countrymen from the \r\nhighest podium in the world. Twenty years ago, God \r\ngranted us the independence that our ancestors had \r\ndreamed of for centuries, for which they had shed \r\ntheir blood and sacrificed their lives. The freedom that \r\nwas sent down to our people as a blessing should be \r\nstrengthened without division, by tireless effort and \r\nlabour united in harmony. Regardless of provocation \r\nby two-faced forces, we need to continue to strengthen \r\nthe path on which we set forth. Let us build a strong, \r\nunited beloved Kyrgyzstan. To reach a bright future we \r\nneed to continue to move forward. Life is a struggle \r\nbetween light and dark, good and bad. We need unity. \r\nWe need work and welfare, not animosity and discord. \r\nMay the Creator bless our nation as it moves towards \r\nbright goals.\r\n(spoke in Russian)\r\nUnfortunately, our country is still weak and \r\neconomically dependent. We are not free in the choice \r\nof our foreign sources of energy, but that problem is \r\ngradually being tackled with the assistance of our \r\nstrategic partners. Kyrgyzstan needs the help of the \r\ninternational community to tackle the problem of \r\nour foreign debt, which is hampering the process of \r\neconomic growth of the State and the implementation \r\nof fundamental reforms.\r\nWe fully share what Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon said here in his opening statement at the \r\nAssembly’s sixty-seventh session, namely, that \r\ndeveloping States need support (see A/67/PV.1). We \r\nbelieve that developing democracies in particular need \r\nsupport from countries of the democratic club and \r\nfrom economically developed States. To consolidate \r\nparliamentary democracy, Kyrgyzstan vitally needs \r\nthe support of our principal partners for the complex \r\nreforms undertaken in restructuring or in writing off \r\nof Kyrgyzstan’s State debt. I wish to stress that we \r\nhave a clear vision of how to conduct reforms and how \r\nto achieve development of the State. However, in the \r\nlight of the high deficit, we need significant additional \r\nresources, which we will certainly return once we have \r\n12-52349 17\r\nA/67/PV.14\r\nachieved development and prosperity in the country in \r\nthe coming years. \r\nWe are open to mutually beneficial, trusting \r\npartnerships and cooperation with all States. Kyrgyzstan \r\nhas great economic potential. We are an open country, \r\nwilling to engage in mutual dialogue. We have great \r\nindustrial and metallurgical potential. In Kyrgyzstan \r\nyou can find most of the elements on Mendeleev’s table \r\nof elements. \r\nCritically important for many energy projects, \r\nwe have a highly qualified labour force and cheap \r\nelectricity. In the modern world, energy is the driver of \r\nprogress. Kyrgyzstan has huge hydroelectric potential, \r\nwhich we have begun to exploit. Every year we develop \r\naround 14 billion kilowatts per hour of electricity, which \r\nis not enough to satisfy the hydro-energy demand of \r\nKyrgyzstan, which is around 142.5 billion kilowatts per \r\nhour.\r\nOn 20 September, Kyrgyzstan and Russia concluded \r\nan agreement that is vital for the entire Central Asian \r\nregion on building and operationalizing the Kambar-\r\nAta and the Naryn Cascade power plants. Participation \r\nin building one of the biggest hydroelectric projects \r\nin Central Asia will include our neighbours in the \r\nregion and allow Kyrgyzstan not only to increase \r\nthe development of cost-effective, environmentally \r\nclean electricity but also to preserve the water in the \r\nfoothills that is currently supplying our neighbours \r\nduring the growing season. The benefit of the effective \r\nimplementation of such projects is clear. It will enhance \r\nour hydroelectric export potential and protect drinking \r\nwater for our neighbours. We invite all investors to take \r\npart in building those projects.\r\nTo conclude, I would like to note that the \r\ninternational community is undergoing a difficult \r\nperiod. Political and social upheavals are creating \r\nnumerous obstacles on the path to human development. \r\nWe are seeing a new era for the world order, combined \r\nwith new historical challenges and changes. At this \r\ncritical stage the Organization must continue its lofty \r\nmission to build peace and to achieve sustainable \r\ndevelopment throughout the world. Kyrgyzstan, in the \r\nspirit of solidarity and cooperation with the United \r\nNations, is prepared to play its part in tackling the \r\nmajor challenges of this day.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the Speaker of \r\nthe Parliament of the Kyrgyz Republic for the statement \r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Asylbek Jeenbekov, Speaker of the Parliament \r\nof the Kyrgyz Republic, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum\r\nAddress by Mr. Abdiweli Mohamed Ali, Prime \r\nMinister of the Transitional Federal Government \r\nof the Somali Republic\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of the Transitional Federal Government of the \r\nSomali Republic.\r\nMr. Abdiweli Mohamed Ali, Prime Minister of the \r\nTransitional Federal Government of the Somali \r\nRepublic, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I \r\nhave great pleasure in welcoming His Excellency \r\nMr. Abdiweli Mohamed Ali, Prime Minister of the \r\nTransitional Federal Government of the Somali \r\nRepublic, and inviting him to address the General \r\nAssembly.\r\nMr. Ali (Somalia): I would like to congratulate \r\nMr. Jeremić on his election as President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-seventh session and to commend \r\nAmbassador Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser for the \r\nmanner in which he guided the proceedings of the \r\nAssembly last year.\r\nJust over two weeks ago, Somalia took a bold and \r\ndecisive step away from decades of division, disorder \r\nand conflict, and instead towards the reconstitution \r\nof a more representative, more democratic Somali \r\nRepublic, at peace with itself, with its neighbours and \r\nwith the rest of the world. On 1 August this year, a \r\nNational Constituent Assembly adopted the new Somali \r\nConstitution and on 20 August a new Parliament was \r\nsworn in, which elected our new President, Hassan \r\nSheikh Mohamud, on 10 September. In the coming \r\nweeks, the President will appoint a Prime Minister and \r\na new cabinet will be duly established.\r\nLet me take this opportunity to convey the sincere \r\nregrets of President Mohamud. He would have liked to \r\nbe here himself to address the Assembly on this great \r\noccasion. However, the tremendous scale and urgency \r\nof the challenges facing him as leader of Somalia and \r\nthe demands of his new role did not permit him to travel \r\nhere to New York to present his remarks in person. He \r\n18 12-52349\r\nA/67/PV.14\r\nother parts of the country. We must build on the return \r\nof normality in Mogadishu, and elsewhere in Somalia, \r\nand on the growing public confidence in the future. It \r\nis the Somali people in the villages and the nomadic \r\npastoralists, with their resilience, drive and dynamism, \r\nwho are best placed to lend real stability to Somalia’s \r\nfuture.\r\nThe end of Somalia’s transition was brought about \r\nby the tremendous joint efforts of the Transitional \r\nFederal Government, Somali regional administrations, \r\ncivil society and our traditional elders. Against all \r\nodds, within one year Somalis were able to adopt a new \r\nprovisional Constitution, create a new Parliament and \r\nelect a new President, heralding the beginning of a new \r\nera. This one-year experience has shown several things. \r\nWhen we put our minds to it, we Somalis are capable \r\nof overcoming tremendous obstacles and delivering \r\non expectations. It has shown that we can effect our \r\npolitical transitions within our own country. It has \r\nshown that Somalis are indeed ready for a new chapter \r\nand are calling for a permanent Government that can \r\nbuild on the foundations of this remarkable year.\r\nSomalia’s transition has officially ended, but \r\nthe work of rebuilding our nation continues. The \r\nnew administration has four short years to translate \r\nagreements and objectives made on paper into concrete, \r\ntangible progress for our people, and to place Somalia \r\nfirmly on an irreversible path to enduring peace and \r\ngrowing prosperity.\r\nThe most urgent challenge is to restore peace \r\nand security throughout Somali territory. Our forces, \r\ntogether with our African Union allies, are making \r\ngreat progress in that regard. But a stable peace \r\ncannot be achieved through military means alone. We \r\nmust practise the politics of inclusion, establishing \r\na credible, representative, inclusive and capable \r\nGovernment — a Government by the people, for the \r\npeople, not a Government of the few, serving the \r\ninterests of the few. Initially, that Government must be \r\nabout delivering real governance and connections with \r\nthe people. It must be about the process of building \r\nlocal representation, addressing community justice \r\nand seeking to build basic services, rather than about \r\ndistant institutions of Government from Mogadishu, \r\nor even provincial centres. Power and responsibility \r\nmust be devolved as close to the people as possible, in \r\naccordance with the principles of federalism. It will be \r\nimportant to recognize the existence of other Somali \r\nauthorities, as well as de facto political and military \r\nasked me to come here to convey his warm greetings \r\nand his vision for Somalia’s future.\r\nFor more than two decades of crisis, the Somali \r\npeople have suffered and endured, but we have not done \r\nso alone. The United Nations has stood by us, providing \r\nhumanitarian assistance to those of our people in need, \r\nhelping us to rebuild from the ruins of war, bringing \r\nus time and again to the negotiating table to resolve \r\nour differences and maintaining the dignity of the \r\nSomali nation by keeping our f lag f lying throughout \r\nthese long, dark years. As we emerge from the long, \r\ndark days, I wish to express my personal thanks, and \r\nthose of the Somali people, to the Secretary-General \r\nand his Special Representative, Augustine Mahiga, for \r\ntheir tireless support and crucial role in helping to open \r\nthis new chapter in Somali history.\r\nSomalia’s progress is also due in great measure \r\nto the self less courage and sacrifice of our brothers \r\nand sisters in the African Union, including our closest \r\nneighbours, whose forces have fought long and hard, \r\nwith so many laying down their lives in the battle to \r\ngive our children a better future. With the support of \r\nthe African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) \r\nand other partners, our armed forces are becoming \r\nincreasingly experienced and capable, but we will need \r\nAMISOM’s steadfast presence and mentoring for some \r\ntime to come, and we call upon our brothers in the \r\nAfrican Union to renew their commitment as we move \r\nforward to assume our own responsibilities in full. We \r\nthank our international partners who are diligently \r\nsupporting AMISOM, especially the European Union \r\nand the United States, among others. \r\nThe members of the League of Arab States and \r\nthe Organization of Islamic Cooperation have also \r\nextended the hand of friendship to the Somali people \r\nduring these difficult times. We are especially grateful \r\nto the Government and people of Turkey for their faith, \r\ncourage and leadership in ending our long isolation and \r\nbuilding bridges between Somalia and the rest of the \r\nworld.\r\nBut now, with all these partners standing by us we \r\nmust increasingly learn to travel our own path with our \r\nown energies, developing the ability to stand on our \r\nown feet and step free from reliance on our kind friends. \r\nAlready, the Somali diaspora from around the world are \r\nreturning to the country with investment and skills that \r\nwill build the future Somalia. We can also learn from \r\nhow peace and growing prosperity have developed in \r\n12-52349 19\r\nA/67/PV.14\r\nfederation, and to do so in a way that unifies our people \r\nrather than dividing them. We must validate the new \r\nConstitution through consultation and referendum, and \r\nestablish systems of governance that serve the interests \r\nof the Somali people. We must design representative \r\nelectoral systems that serve to heal the divisions of our \r\nsociety rather than to aggravate them.\r\nAs we move away from transitional Government \r\ninto the era of permanent Government, we must establish \r\na new compact for national coexistence in which the \r\naspirations of all Somalis, not only some, are reflected. \r\nWe recognize that the bonds of love and solidarity that \r\nbound us together in 1960 have been heavily damaged \r\nand sorely tested. The talks initiated earlier this year \r\nbetween the Transitional Federal Government and the \r\nSomaliland administration have begun well, and we \r\nintend to continue them. We will not use military or \r\npolitical coercion to bring out an artificial unity; we \r\nwant a genuine unity that results from negotiations, \r\nmutual respect and mutual agreement.\r\nThe durability of our stabilization efforts will \r\ndepend in large part upon our ability to revive and \r\ndevelop the Somali economy. Security and durable \r\npeace cannot exist without jobs and food, and therefore \r\nwe must work hard to ensure that food is on the table of \r\nthe average Somali family, to create job opportunities \r\nand to enable Somalis to work for themselves.\r\nOur country is abundant in resources; we have the \r\nlongest coastline in Africa, 9 million acres of fertile \r\nland, the highest per capita number of livestock in the \r\nworld. We have oil and minerals. We are strategically \r\nlocated at the gateway of the Middle East and Africa, \r\nat the confluence of the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea. \r\nOur challenge as Somalis is to use those resources to \r\nbring our country and our people back onto the global \r\neconomic playing field.\r\nOn the topic of resources, we are committed \r\nto strengthening the Government’s financial \r\naccountability. Somalia is a poor country, and we \r\ncannot afford corruption. We seek the assistance of our \r\ninternational partners in establishing and strengthening \r\ntransparent systems of public financial management.\r\nThe problems of Somalia have spilled far beyond \r\nour borders. Foreign countries have taken in hundreds \r\nof thousands of Somalis f leeing the crisis in our country, \r\nat considerable sacrifice to their own citizens; Somali \r\npirates have become the scourge of shipping far from \r\nour shores. Extremists from across the world have used \r\nforces across the country, with which we will work to \r\nestablish a vibrant, prosperous and stable representative \r\nGovernment democracy, firmly adhering to and \r\ngrounded in Somali and Islamic values.\r\nWe will also require a fair and independent judiciary, \r\none resistant to executive interference, and one that will \r\nmeet the needs and earn the trust of ordinary citizens, \r\nwhile bringing an end to the culture of impunity that \r\nhas gripped our nation for the past two decades.\r\nWe have repeatedly extended an olive branch to the \r\nGovernment’s adversaries, and, although this has been \r\nrepeatedly rejected, our new President will continue \r\nto reach out and offer peace. Al-Shabaab is a complex \r\nand heterogeneous movement. Most of its members are \r\nordinary citizens who have aligned themselves with \r\nAl-Shabaab out of fear or a sense of grievance. At the \r\nsame time we must also be honest with ourselves and \r\nadmit that some of the members come from a nationalist, \r\nconservative faction of our fractured country, which \r\nhas been disillusioned and damaged by decades of \r\nconflict, and they have sought refuge in an extreme and \r\nharsh source of justice and security. To them we must \r\nprove that there is a better way. To them we have always \r\nsaid and will continue to say, “Brothers and sisters, lay \r\ndown your arms and let us talk”.\r\nWe Somalis have a saying — after every war comes \r\npeace. So let us remember that we have no choice as a \r\nnation but to live together. Let us settle our differences \r\nthrough dialogue and compromise, so that there is no \r\nlonger any justification for any Somali to take up arms \r\nagainst another. To those few ideological extremists in \r\nAl-Shabaab’s ranks who remain committed to the use \r\nof terror and the murder of innocents to achieve their \r\naims, we say, “There is no place in Somali society, nor \r\nin international society, for you and your violent creed. \r\nWe will fight you until Somalia is once again a nation \r\nfounded on the peace, tolerance and management that \r\nconstitute the true spirit of the great religion of Islam”.\r\nAs we focus our energies on these immediate \r\nchallenges, we must nevertheless keep our longer-\r\nterm goals clearly in view. The new Government \r\nunderstands clearly that its purpose is not to entrench \r\nitself indefinitely in power, but to lay the foundation \r\nfor a democratic system of governance, anchored in \r\nIslamic values and based on universal, competitive \r\nelections, by August 2016.\r\nThe new Government has just four short years \r\nwithin which to establish the states and regions of this \r\n20 12-52349\r\nA/67/PV.14\r\nIn that context, on behalf of the Somali people, I \r\nwant to convey our condolences to the United States \r\nand Algeria on the recent violent loss of their senior \r\ndiplomats. Diplomacy is a peaceful calling and the \r\nfoundation of the United Nations, and we must protect \r\ndiplomats for their important role in promoting dialogue \r\nand better understanding across countries and cultures.\r\nThe members of the Assembly are not strangers \r\nto conflict and war. Many countries have experienced \r\nviolence and destruction equal to or greater than my \r\nown. But few other countries in modern times have \r\nexperienced such a prolonged period of statelessness: \r\na nation without a recognized Government, a valid \r\npassport or a convertible currency.\r\nBut it is not just the material attributes of statehood \r\nthat we have missed. To be stateless in this world of \r\nStates is injurious to a people’s identity, to its rights and \r\nprivileges as a nation, and to its dignity. It is time for us \r\nto reclaim Somalia’s rightful place in the community of \r\nnations, to shoulder our duties and obligations, and to \r\nplace our country in the service of peace, security and \r\nprosperity on this planet we share.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the Prime \r\nMinister of the Transitional Federal Government of the \r\nSomali Republic for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Abdiweli Mohamed Ali, Prime Minister of the \r\nTransitional Federal Government of the Somali \r\nRepublic, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Rashid Meredov, Deputy \r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nTurkmenistan. \r\nMr. Meredov (Turkmenistan) (spoke in Russian): \r\nI wish at the outset to express my sincere gratitude \r\nfor being given the honour of speaking from this lofty \r\nrostrum. \r\nAllow me first of all to convey to the members of \r\nthe Assembly and to the peoples of their countries the \r\ngreetings and wishes for peace and prosperity of His \r\nExcellency the President of Turkmenistan, Gurbanguly \r\nBerdimuhamedov.\r\nAllow me to congratulate His Excellency Vuk \r\nJeremić on his election as President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-seventh session and to wish him \r\nevery success in his upcoming critical work. I would \r\nalso like to express appreciation to His Excellency \r\nour territory as a base from which to plan and launch \r\nattacks against foreign countries.\r\nAs Somalia reclaims its status as a full member \r\nof the international community, we must acknowledge \r\nour responsibility as a nation, both for the proliferation \r\nof these problems and for their eventual resolution. \r\nWe recognize the urgency of tackling these threats \r\nto international security, but we are also conscious of \r\ntheir complexity and of the fact that lasting solutions \r\ncan be achieved only through reflection, consultation, \r\nthe force of law and only, as a last resort, the judicious \r\nuse of force. We intend to engage with our international \r\npartners on all of these fronts, as we strengthen our \r\ninternal capacity to address these challenges.\r\nThe road ahead is long, but we, the Somali people, \r\nare committed, and we are ready. We have created the \r\nguideposts, and we have chosen a new leadership to \r\nhelp us move forward. We are grateful for the support \r\nof the world community; we would not be here today \r\nwithout its moral, political and financial support. Most \r\ndear to us is the personal sacrifice made by our African \r\nbrothers and sisters who came in person to help us \r\nprotect our country and people. We cannot thank them \r\nenough, and we hope one day to be able to repay them.\r\nAs many today have noted, the United Nations \r\nwas founded on the conviction that the nations of the \r\nworld could come together in the spirit of cooperation \r\nto tackle their common problems for the sake of the \r\nwhole of humanity.\r\nThe world is going through a challenging \r\nperiod — economic crises, religious tensions and \r\nresource disputes. Every nation has its own challenges \r\nand priorities. And yet we come together as the United \r\nNations to forge a common way forward, because we \r\nrecognize that this small Earth is all the space we \r\nhave, and we must find a way to share it and coexist \r\npeacefully.\r\nAs Somalis, we have learned this hard lesson \r\nthrough bitter experience, and we are living through \r\nit every day, each time another young man chooses \r\nto take his own life and the lives of others; each time \r\na young mother has to bury a child. Let us not forget \r\nthat in rebuilding a nation, or in steering the world to \r\na better place, we are dealing with the lives of human \r\nbeings, each life as precious as the next. For the future \r\nof our children, we must work harder to make our world \r\npeaceful and prosperous.\r\n12-52349 21\r\nA/67/PV.14\r\nMembers of the United Nations, which, we believe, \r\nwould significantly help to find common approaches \r\nto solving one of the most urgent problems of modern \r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, held in June this year, clearly identified \r\nthe need to strengthen our efforts on ecological issues \r\nand environmental protection. Speaking at the meeting, \r\nthe President of Turkmenistan noted that, at the \r\ninstitutional level, today’s main objective is to merge \r\nand complement existing global, regional and national \r\ninstruments.\r\nIt is no secret that the Central Asian and Caspian \r\nSea regions have difficult environmental conditions. \r\nWe think that the efforts made to date to improve \r\nthe situation are clearly insufficient. We need a joint \r\nand results-oriented action plan that combines the \r\nuse of scientific, technological, political, diplomatic, \r\nadministrative and technical measures for effective \r\noutcomes in that direction. We therefore propose setting \r\nup, in cooperation with the United Nations, a regional \r\ncentre for climate change technologies in Central \r\nAsia and the Caspian basin. We believe that such a \r\nstructure would enable the countries in those regions \r\nto significantly strengthen cooperation on ecological \r\nsafety. It would promote the effective coordination of \r\nnational, regional and international efforts and would \r\nfurther mutual understanding and confidence-building \r\ntowards achieving sustainable development goals.\r\nWith regard to international politics, Turkmenistan \r\ngives particular attention to the issues of peace and \r\nsecurity and to ensuring sustainable development. In \r\nthat context, one of the main challenges facing the \r\ninternational community today is the need for our joint \r\nefforts to ensure non-proliferation and disarmament. \r\nAs a party to the principal international treaties and \r\nUnited Nations conventions in that field, Turkmenistan \r\nexpects to continue to fully support global disarmament \r\nprocesses. \r\nWe believe that it is relevant to pursue the \r\nmultilateral dialogue on the validity of the Treaty on \r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We propose \r\nthat a high-level consultative meeting be held next year, \r\nunder the auspices of the United Nations, to discuss \r\nsteps to expand the international non-proliferation legal \r\nframework. Turkmenistan’s initiative is particularly \r\nrelevant to the practical implementation of steps \r\ntowards a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Asia. \r\nAs we know, the agenda of the sixty-seventh session \r\nNassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-sixth session, for the skilful and \r\neffective manner in which he carried out his duties.\r\nToday the international community is witness to \r\ncomplex, multifaceted processes in geopolitics, the \r\nglobal economy and the humanitarian sphere. Serious \r\nenvironmental problems challenge us with their \r\nunprecedented urgency. It is no exaggeration to say that \r\nmajor global issues related to energy supplies acquiring \r\nuniversal importance. All of these require a constructive \r\nand effective response on the part of the United Nations \r\nand the elaboration of appropriate international \r\nmechanisms aimed at maximizing the effective use \r\nof existing political, financial, organizational and \r\nother resources, so as to overcome existing problems \r\nand challenges, enhance mutual understanding and \r\ntrust, and reaffirm the irreversibility of the process of \r\nsustainable development of all the peoples of our planet.\r\nObjectively speaking, energy security is \r\nfundamental to the stable and conflict-free development \r\nof today’s world. As a leading energy provider with \r\nthe fourth-largest reserves of hydrocarbon resources, \r\nTurkmenistan legitimately and consistently calls for \r\nthe establishment of a sound and reliable international \r\nenergy supply system and the drawing up of plans \r\nand projects for cooperation in world energy markets \r\nappropriate to modern realities. We believe that it is \r\nnow time for the United Nations to adopt consensus \r\ndecisions on universal political and legal mechanisms \r\nto govern global energy cooperation. \r\nAs members know, at previous General Assembly \r\nsessions, the President of Turkmenistan launched a \r\nnumber of initiatives on energy security and mutually \r\nbeneficial cooperation in the energy sector. The realities \r\nof modern life affirm the relevance of such initiatives. \r\nAs a step towards those initiatives, Turkmenistan \r\nproposes that States Members of the United Nations \r\nconsider in depth the establishment of an international \r\nlegal framework to govern the operation of an energy \r\nsupply system, taking into due account the interests \r\nof hydrocarbon producers and transit and recipient \r\nnations.\r\nAs a first step in that direction, we believe that \r\nit would be appropriate to draw up a draft resolution \r\nduring this session on the establishment of an \r\nexpert group to develop the relevant United Nations \r\ninternational instrument. At the same time, we look \r\nforward to constructive engagement with all States \r\n22 12-52349\r\nA/67/PV.14\r\nGoals, we believe it appropriate during this sixty-\r\nseventh session to consider including the humanitarian \r\nissues on the United Nations international agenda as a \r\nseparate issue.\r\nIn that context, Turkmenistan proposes establishing \r\na United Nations platform of action for humanitarian \r\naffairs with a view to it becoming the political and \r\nlegal basis for the consolidation of the international \r\ncommunity’s humanitarian efforts. We believe that \r\nsuch a holistic approach will enable us to galvanize \r\nthe activities of United Nations agencies, to develop \r\nlong-term solutions in line with international law \r\nand General Assembly resolutions, and to ensure the \r\npractical implementation of United Nations conventions \r\non humanitarian matters.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to emphasize that our \r\nforeign policy, which is based on our love of peace, \r\non neutrality and on broad international cooperation, \r\ntogether with the constructive positions advocated \r\nby our country, form a solid basis for Turkmenistan’s \r\nwork in the United Nations. In that spirit, we will rely \r\non broad cooperation with all countries of the world \r\nin order to strengthen and develop a comprehensive \r\ninternational partnership.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Dimitris Avramopoulos, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Hellenic Republic.\r\nMr. Avramopoulos (Greece) (spoke in French): I \r\nwould like to thank the outgoing President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-sixth session, Ambassador Nassir \r\nAbdulaziz Al-Nasser of the State of Qatar, and to \r\ncongratulate Mr. Vuk Jeremić of the Republic of Serbia \r\non his election to the presidency of the Assembly at the \r\nsixty-seventh session. I also want to thank Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon, who tirelessly carries on at the \r\nhelm of our Organization in an ever-shifting global \r\nenvironment.\r\nI wish to affirm our endorsement of the positions \r\nvoiced in the statement made by the observer of the \r\nEuropean Union. As always, Greece remains fully \r\ncommitted to the United Nations, to the values of peace, \r\nsecurity, and to raising the living standards of people \r\nall over the world so that they may lead lives of dignity.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nAt the recent High-level Meeting on the rule of law, \r\nthe States Members of the United Nations reaffirmed \r\ntheir commitment to one of the most important principles \r\nincludes an item on a nuclear-weapon-free zone in \r\nCentral Asia.\r\nOur country is ready to actively cooperate with the \r\nOffice of the Under-Secretary-General for Disarmament \r\nAffairs and to participate in a number of initiatives \r\nin that regard. Given that further improving relevant \r\nUnited Nations agencies may be one practical step in \r\nimplementing consistent disarmament measures, we \r\nthink it appropriate to consider the establishment of a \r\nUnited Nations subregional centre for disarmament in \r\nAsia.\r\nStrengthening comprehensive, targeted and long-\r\nterm cooperation with the United Nations is a strategic \r\nchoice of Turkmenistan and a priority of its foreign \r\npolicy. As an important part of that cooperation, \r\nour country is considering participating in United \r\nNations activities to ensure human development, better \r\nliving standards and people’s well-being; to establish \r\nconditions conducive to global economic and social \r\ngrowth; to utilize human creativity; and to promote \r\npeople’s rights and freedoms.\r\nIn pursuing those lofty goals and striving to \r\ncontribute, where possible, to their achievement, \r\nTurkmenistan has announced its candidacy for \r\nmembership of the Economic and Social Council for \r\nthe period 2013-2015. That decision was made on the \r\nbasis of the country’s current progress in the political, \r\nsocioeconomic, cultural and other fields, its active role \r\nin international processes and its understanding of the \r\nresponsibilities inherent to membership of the Council. \r\nIf elected, Turkmenistan plans to use all available \r\nmeans to improve international cooperation for the \r\neffective implementation of sustainable development \r\ngoals. At the same time, Turkmenistan will actively \r\ncontribute to strengthening the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil by expanding its role in addressing the urgent \r\nissue of global socioeconomic development.\r\nThe most important element of the modern system \r\nof international relations is humanitarian cooperation. \r\nTo underscore that the humanitarian component is at \r\nthe centre of the highest principles and values of the \r\ncommunity of nations, our country will continue to \r\npromote its cooperation with the United Nations on \r\nprotecting human rights and on establishing conditions \r\nconducive to human development. On that basis, \r\ngiven that the United Nations plays a major role in the \r\ncomprehensive development of humanity and bearing in \r\nmind the achievement of the Millennium Development \r\n12-52349 23\r\nA/67/PV.14\r\nSecurity in the Middle East remains a crucial quest \r\nfor the countries of the region and the world community. \r\nGreece maintains historic ties of friendship, cooperation \r\nand mutual respect with its neighbours in North Africa \r\nand the Middle East — countries that, following the \r\nmomentous events of the Arab Spring, are moving \r\ntowards successful electoral processes and towards \r\nbuilding democratic institutions. The European Union \r\nshould be there, right by their side, as they build their \r\nfuture. \r\nHowever, we have not seen successful outcomes \r\neverywhere. In Syria, demonstrators faced tanks \r\nand a brutal crack-down. On numerous occasions we \r\nhave called on President Al-Assad to open the way \r\nfor a transitional authority, comprising all sections of \r\nSyrian society. Yet, we are still in a prolonged bloody \r\nstalemate that jeopardizes the present and the future of \r\nthe Syrian people, and stability in our region. The result \r\nhas been no less than 29,000 victims, 250,000 refugees, \r\n2.5 million Syrian citizens in need. We are convinced \r\nthat a Syrian-led political solution is still achieveable, \r\nand we see no alternative to such a solution. Greece \r\nbelieves that there is no military solution to the Syrian \r\nproblem. \r\nPeace and security in the Eastern Mediterranean \r\ncannot be achieved without a just, lasting and \r\ncomprehensive solution of the Palestinian issue, on the \r\nbasis of a two-State solution. We regret the prolonged \r\nstagnation in the direct negotiations between the two \r\nparties. It is only through negotiations that peace \r\ncan finally be achieved. We believe that unilateral \r\nactions cannot fulfil Israel’s quest for security or the \r\nPalestinians’ aspirations for statehood, which we fully \r\nsupport. The two-State solution should remain feasible \r\non the ground.\r\nI would now like to outline the current position \r\non some salient issues concerning our immediate \r\nneighbourhood. The issue of the name of the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia is, beyond its semantic \r\ndimension, an important piece in the puzzle of putting \r\nto rest irredentist notions and attempts to rewrite \r\nhistory in our region. I have been informed of what \r\nthe representative of the former Yugoslav Republic of \r\nMacedonia said today in the General Assembly (see \r\nA/67/PV.12). Distorting reality in front of the entire \r\ninternational community and using nineteenth-century \r\nrhetoric in the twenty-first century is counterproductive \r\nand will lead us nowhere. Populism and nationalism \r\nmake up the worst possible mix for the promotion of \r\nunderlying the international order, which should be our \r\nguide in the conduct of diplomacy and international \r\nrelations. We fully agree with the Secretary-General’s \r\nopinion that freedom of expression is a fundamental \r\nright and privilege belonging to all people, without any \r\ndiscrimination, and should not be abused by anyone in \r\na disgraceful and shameful way.\r\nUnfortunately, there are those who will do \r\neverything to provoke, as we have witnessed again \r\nrecently in the provocative and unacceptable movie \r\nwhich denigrates Islam. Nevertheless, we should \r\nstrongly condemn all forms of violence, and, in \r\nthis particular case, the violence against diplomatic \r\nmissions. There is no justification for it. After all, the \r\nmeasure and limit of every right is the respect of the \r\nright of the other.\r\nGreece is dedicated to United Nations efforts to \r\nenhance international cooperation on the promotion and \r\nprotection of human rights. We have therefore decided \r\nto present our candidacy for membership in the Human \r\nRights Council for the 2013-2015 term. In this context, \r\nwe also support the adoption of the European Union \r\nStrategic Framework on Human Rights and Democracy \r\nand the appointment of the European Union Special \r\nRepresentative for Human Rights as important steps \r\ntowards a more coherent European policy and approach \r\nto human dignity.\r\nThe need to respect and protect human rights and \r\nhumanitarian law is now as urgent as ever. In fact, \r\nillegal migration in the Mediterranean region has given \r\nrise to a humanitarian crisis. That is why Greece has \r\nintroduced major legislative and institutional reforms \r\nin the fields of asylum and migration.\r\nI now turn to one of the main pillars of United Nations \r\naction: peace and security. Greece’s neighbourhood \r\nhas often been at the centre of serious, interrelated \r\nsecurity challenges. My country has consistently \r\nplayed a stabilizing role, which we have accomplished \r\nthrough the pursuit of a policy of peaceful resolution of \r\ndisputes, within the framework of the United Nations \r\nCharter, based on respect for international law and the \r\nprinciples of sovereignty, independence and territorial \r\nintegrity. Despite the economic and financial crisis, \r\nGreece has continued to participate actively in a number \r\nof United Nations missions and operations around the \r\nworld, including in Kosovo and Afghanistan and in the \r\nanti-piracy efforts off the coast of Somalia.\r\n24 12-52349\r\nA/67/PV.14\r\nresolutions and taking into account the fact that the \r\nRepublic of Cyprus is a member of the European \r\nUnion, which currently holds its presidency. However, \r\nafter 38 years, the division of the island continues and \r\nthe results of the talks have been disappointing, owing \r\nto Turkish-Cypriot intransigence about engaging in \r\nconstructive talks. We applaud Cyprus’s decision to act \r\non its sovereign right to exploit the natural gas deposits \r\nin its exclusive economic zone.\r\nWe are forging partnerships with other emerging \r\nenergy players in the region, including Israel and \r\nthe Arab countries, with which we enjoy traditional \r\nrelations of friendship and trust. Greece is contributing \r\nto bringing stability and economic growth to the Eastern \r\nMediterranean, in order to promote energy security \r\nand diversification of sources and suppliers for the \r\nEuropean energy markets. A resolution of the Cyprus \r\nissue would have a tremendously positive effect, not \r\njust for the Cypriots themselves but for Greek-Turkish \r\nrelations and stability in the Eastern Mediterranean as \r\na whole.\r\nI will conclude with a few words about the \r\neconomic crisis that Greece is confronting with the \r\nhelp of its partners in the European Union and the \r\ninternational community. The new tripartite coalition \r\nGovernment in Greece is implementing an ambitious \r\neconomic adjustment programme in order to improve its \r\nmacroeconomic outlook and achieve fiscal adjustment, \r\nwhile at the same time addressing structural reforms \r\naimed at growth and job creation. \r\nThat effort has produced impressive results, \r\nespecially a significant reduction of the primary \r\ndeficit. At the same time, the Greek economy has \r\nregained more than 50 per cent of its competitiveness in \r\nrelation to its global trade partners, while the business \r\nand investment climate is on a positive path. We are \r\ndetermined to continue along that path, bearing in mind \r\nthat the Greek people are suffering tremendously from \r\nthe implementation of the austerity programme.\r\nIn a broader view, it is evident that this crisis is not \r\njust Greek or European. International economies are \r\nintertwined, and therefore ours is also a global crisis. \r\nIn that respect, we need to examine measures aimed \r\nat generating all-inclusive and job-creating growth, \r\nmeasures that will regenerate economies and diminish \r\nthe social impact of the crisis.\r\nThe eurozone, with Greece at the forefront, is \r\nmaking a hard and painstaking effort and adopting new \r\nanyone’s national interests and the stability of our \r\nregion. \r\nGreece believes that the solution lies in a fair \r\nsettlement. That would be a name with a geographical \r\nqualifier, since Macedonia is a geographical region that \r\noverlaps the territories of three countries, the largest \r\npart being in Greece, followed by Bulgaria and then \r\nthe former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. And of \r\ncourse the name must be used in relation to everyone; \r\nit is an erga omnes obligation, to use the Latin phrase. \r\nWhen we resolve this issue, we will be able to realize \r\nthe vast potential in our relations, to our mutual benefit, \r\nand Greece will be the former Yugoslav Republic of \r\nMacedonia’s staunchest ally and friend in its efforts to \r\nfulfil its Euro-Atlantic aspirations. After all, as is well \r\nknown, Greece is the most important economic partner \r\nof the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, with a \r\nlarge presence of Greek companies operating there. We \r\nalso support the European Union-facilitated dialogue \r\nbetween Belgrade and Pristina, and we welcome the \r\nconstructive approach to the talks on the part of the \r\nSerbian leadership. Dialogue is the only way to resolve \r\nproblems in Kosovo, while unilateral measures and \r\nescalation, especially in the north, should be avoided \r\nby all means.\r\nLess than two years from now, Greece’s European \r\nUnion presidency will launch Agenda 2014, which \r\naims to reinvigorate the European perspectives of all \r\nour neighbours in the Western Balkans. Elsewhere in \r\nour immediate neighbourhood, Greece is consistently \r\npursuing stronger cooperation with Turkey, through a \r\nwide range of initiatives, so that we can improve our \r\nrelations to the benefit of both peoples. Moreover, \r\nGreece continues to support Turkey’s candidacy for full \r\nmembership in the European family, on the condition, \r\nof course, that all relevant membership criteria are met \r\nand that the necessary reforms are carried out. It is of the \r\nutmost importance that Turkey gives tangible signs of \r\nfull respect for international law and abandons attitudes \r\nlike the standing threat of casus belli against Greece, or \r\nits attitude vis-à-vis Cyprus, which undermines efforts \r\nto build trust.\r\nThat brings us to the Eastern Mediterranean as a \r\nwhole, where Greece continues to play its role as a force \r\nfor peace and stability. Greece supports the efforts of \r\nthe Government of the Republic of Cyprus to pursue \r\nnegotiations with the Turkish Cypriot community, \r\nunder United Nations auspices, aimed ultimately at \r\nreuniting the island, according to United Nations \r\n12-52349 25\r\nA/67/PV.14\r\nto thank Mr. Al-Nasser for his positive contribution as \r\nPresident at the last session.\r\nThe world is undergoing major and profound \r\nchanges. The trends towards multipolarity, economic \r\nglobalization and the application of information \r\ntechnology are gaining momentum. Countries have \r\nnever been as interconnected and interdependent as they \r\nare today. Emerging markets and developing countries \r\nhave never had such strong influence, and cross-\r\ncivilizational dialogue and exchanges are f lourishing \r\nas never before. To promote peace, development \r\nand cooperation has become the shared aspiration of \r\npeople across the world and the common pursuit of the \r\ninternational community.\r\nOn the other hand, the world is still far from being \r\npeaceful. The underlying impact of the international \r\nfinancial crisis and the European debt crisis remains \r\nstrong. Destabilizing factors and uncertainties affecting \r\nglobal growth have increased. Regional turbulence \r\npersists, hotspot issues keep emerging and traditional \r\nand non-traditional security issues have become \r\nintertwined. The international security environment is \r\nhighly complex.\r\nFacing both unprecedented opportunities and \r\nchallenges, we must not allow the outdated Cold War \r\nmentality and zero-sum game theory to stand in our \r\nway. We should act like passengers who stick together \r\nin a boat when crossing a torrential river and seek \r\nwin-win progress through cooperation. That is the only \r\noption for countries around the world. To ensure one’s \r\nown security, a country should respect and accommodate \r\nthe security of other nations. To achieve one’s own \r\ndevelopment, a country should actively promote \r\ncommon development. In pursuing one’s own interests, \r\na country should take into account the interests of \r\nother nations. Only by promoting common security and \r\ndevelopment for all its members can the international \r\ncommunity effectively address complex and multiple \r\nsecurity threats and global challenges, resolve \r\nincreasingly serious difficulties facing development and \r\nensure durable peace and sustainable development in \r\nthe world. With that in mind, China believes that it is \r\nimportant to do the following.\r\nWe should promote equality and democracy in \r\ninternational relations. Mutual respect and equality \r\nare basic norms governing international relations. All \r\ncountries, large or small, strong or weak, rich or poor, \r\nare equal members of the international community. \r\npaths and ways to climb out of the deep economic crisis. \r\nThe pivotal role and geopolitical importance of Greece \r\nin South-Eastern Europe, in the Eastern Mediterranean \r\nand the Middle East will emerge as a result of the \r\nevents unfolding in our neighbourhood. It is indeed \r\na stabilizing role, since our vital national interests \r\nare aligned with the promotion of peace, stability, \r\nprosperity and regional security. Our advantage is \r\nnot only our geographical position but also our strong \r\npolitical will to become a cornerstone of stability \r\nand security, at a time when uncertainty dangerously \r\nthreatens our region.\r\nDuring the past two years, Greece has been \r\nportrayed by the global media as a country defined \r\nby its economic need. It is true that our country is \r\nexperiencing a painful transition leading to economic \r\nrecovery and growth. It is also true that the Greek \r\npeople have known in their 3,000 years of history crises \r\nmore serious than the present one. We survived. We \r\nexcelled. Let me assure the General Assembly and the \r\nfamily of nations that Greece will make it.\r\nWe will make it because Greece is larger than its \r\ngeographical size and more precious than its present \r\nfiscal reality. Through knowledge, science and art, \r\nGreece is there when progress takes place. Through \r\ndemocracy Greece is present as a global civilization. \r\nThrough Olympism Greece unites humankind. Through \r\nour merchant f leet and our maritime tradition we carry \r\ngoods all around the world. Through our love for life \r\nwe constantly remind the world that progress should \r\nalways be measured on the human scale. Through and \r\nby our legacy we will make it once more.\r\nWe will make it because Greece is not about \r\nasking. Greece is about offering. Let us not forget that \r\nGreece holds intrinsic value in the hearts and minds \r\nof people irrespective of nationality, race and religion. \r\nAnd that gives us the moral power, the support and the \r\nencouragement, along with our partners in Europe, to \r\ngive to the world and to win our current fight.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Yang Jiechi, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the People’s Republic of China.\r\nMr. Yang Jiechi (China) (spoke in Chinese): I wish \r\nto congratulate Mr. Jeremić on his election as President \r\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. \r\nI am confident that with his ability and experience he \r\nwill successfully fulfil that lofty mission. I also wish \r\n26 12-52349\r\nA/67/PV.14\r\nauthority, efficiency and ability to address new threats \r\nand challenges through the required proper reform. \r\nIt is important to advance the building of a global \r\nsystem of economic governance with a focus on \r\nreforming the international financial system, rapidly \r\nimplement the quota and governance reform plans of \r\nthe International Monetary Fund and other financial \r\ninstitutions, and increase the representation and voice of \r\nemerging markets and developing countries. We should \r\nfully implement the outcome and consensus of the \r\nUnited Nations Conference on Sustainable Development \r\n(resolution 66/288, annex), further develop international \r\ncooperation on sustainable development and discuss the \r\nestablishment of a post-2015 international development \r\nagenda based on actively implementing the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. \r\nWe should launch a process of open, transparent \r\nand democratic intergovernmental consultation, \r\nwith development and poverty reduction as the core \r\nobjectives. We should also fully leverage the role of \r\ncivil society and the private sector in that task. Together \r\nwith all other parties, China is ready to actively \r\nparticipate in reforming the international system and in \r\nglobal governance and to jointly face the various global \r\nchallenges.\r\nWe should pursue common progress by embracing \r\nthe diversity of civilizations. According to ancient \r\nChinese philosophy, the world will be a great place \r\nwhen all things thrive without harming each another \r\nand when various efforts are pursued in parallel \r\nwithout their clashing. We should encourage exchanges \r\nand mutual learning among different civilizations and \r\nsocial systems, draw on each other’s strength through \r\ncompetition and comparison and make progress by \r\nseeking common ground, while maintaining our \r\ndifferences. We should respect the diversity of the world \r\nand the right of all countries to independently choose \r\ntheir development path. China encourages dialogue \r\nand exchanges among civilizations. We should replace \r\nconfrontation with dialogue and bridge differences \r\nwith inclusiveness in order to make the world more \r\nharmonious and to ensure common progress for \r\nhumanity.\r\nWe should seek common security amid growing \r\ninterdependence. No country is immune to the complex \r\nand multiple security threats and challenges in the \r\nworld. We should foster a new thinking on security that \r\nis characterized by mutual trust and benefit, equality \r\nRespect for each other’s sovereignty, core interests \r\nand choice of social system and development path is a \r\nfundamental principle guiding State-to-State relations. \r\nWe should resolutely promote greater democracy in \r\ninternational relations. A country should deal with its \r\ninternal affairs itself. Issues involving the interests of \r\nvarious countries should be handled by those countries \r\nthrough consultation. We should remain true to \r\nmultilateralism and uphold the purposes and principles \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations and the central role \r\nof the United Nations in international affairs. \r\nChina strives to strengthen political mutual trust \r\nand to address problems and differences with other \r\ncountries through dialogue and exchanges. China does \r\nnot interfere in the internal affairs of other countries or \r\nimpose its will on others. China does not allow outside \r\nforces to interfere in its internal affairs.\r\nWe should seek win-win progress through \r\ncooperation on development. As economic globalization \r\ndeepens, all countries have a high stake in each other’s \r\nsuccess. We should therefore enhance cooperation \r\nand develop common interests to achieve win-win \r\nprogress with benefits for all. We should tap the \r\npotential for cooperation in all countries, increase and \r\ndevelop cooperation, improve cooperation mechanisms \r\nand work together to make economic globalization \r\nbalanced, inclusive and beneficial to all. \r\nWe should accelerate the development of \r\ndeveloping countries and narrow the North-South gap. \r\nWe should enhance global development cooperation to \r\nensure that the benefits of development reach everyone. \r\nSince the start of the international financial crisis, \r\nwhile maintaining its own robust growth, China has \r\nsignificantly increased contributions to international \r\nfinancial institutions, extended a helping hand to other \r\ndeveloping countries and bought more bonds from \r\ncertain developed countries. That has helped to stabilize \r\nthe international economic and financial situation and \r\nto maintain the economic and social development of the \r\nrelevant countries.\r\nWe should ensure fairness and effectiveness in \r\nconducting global governance. Facing increasing \r\nglobal challenges, the international community should \r\nstrengthen coordination and cooperation, establish a \r\nfair, equitable, f lexible and effective system of global \r\ngovernance, properly address the various global issues \r\nand promote the common well-being of humanity. \r\nChina supports the United Nations in enhancing its \r\n12-52349 27\r\nA/67/PV.14\r\nan immediate end to the fighting and violence, to \r\nimplement the relevant Security Council resolutions, \r\nMr. Kofi Annan’s six-point plan and the communiqué \r\nof the foreign ministers’ meeting of the Action Group \r\nfor Syria (A/66/865, annex), and to launch an inclusive \r\npolitical dialogue and a Syrian-led political transition as \r\nsoon as possible. China is open to any political plan that \r\nis acceptable to all parties in Syria. The relevant parties \r\nof the international community should play a positive \r\nand constructive role in that regard, credibly support \r\nMr. Lakhdar Brahimi, Joint Special Representative \r\nof the United Nations and the League of Arab States, \r\nin conducting impartial mediation, and strive to set \r\nin motion and move forward the process of political \r\ntransition in Syria.\r\nThe Iranian nuclear issue has reached a new, critical \r\nstage. The relevant parties should remain committed to \r\na diplomatic solution and begin a new round of dialogue \r\nas soon as possible. In the spirit of respecting each \r\nother’s concerns, we should act with f lexibility and \r\npragmatism to expand common ground and overcome \r\ndifferences, seek early progress in dialogue and \r\nnegotiation and, over time, achieve a comprehensive, \r\nlong-term and appropriate solution to the issue. China \r\nhas always supported efforts to uphold the international \r\nnuclear non-proliferation regime and will continue to \r\nwork with the parties concerned and play a constructive \r\nrole in seeking a peaceful solution to the Iranian nuclear \r\nissue through dialogue and negotiation.\r\nThe Asia-Pacific region has maintained general \r\nstability and rapid growth for many years, thereby \r\nmaking important contributions to global stability \r\nand prosperity. Given the growing threat of shrinkage \r\nin the global economy and increasing volatility in the \r\ninternational situation, maintaining peace, stability \r\nand sound growth in the Asia-Pacific region is crucial \r\nto ensuring the well-being of its people and meets the \r\nbroader interests of the international community. \r\nWe should fully respect the reality of a \r\ndiverse and interdependent Asia-Pacific region, \r\nand continue to follow the approach of regional \r\ncooperation — building consensus, making \r\nincremental progress and accommodating each other’s \r\ncomfort levels — that has proved effective over the \r\nyears. We should promote regional development with \r\ngreater determination, advance regional cooperation \r\nwith increased resources, and handle differences with \r\nlonger-term interests in mind so as to uphold the peace, \r\nstability and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region.\r\nand coordination. We should adopt a holistic approach \r\nto address both the symptoms and the root causes of \r\nthe various security challenges and should build a \r\npeaceful and stable international and regional security \r\nenvironment. \r\nThe United Nations should fully play its role in \r\nmaintaining international peace and security and \r\nin establishing a fair and effective mechanism for \r\ncommon security. We must resolve disputes through \r\ndialogue and negotiation and oppose the wilful use or \r\nthreat of force. We must oppose all forms of terrorism, \r\nseparatism and extremism.\r\nWest Asia and North Africa are undergoing \r\nprofound changes. China respects and supports efforts \r\nby countries in those regions to independently deal \r\nwith their internal affairs. We respect the aspirations \r\nand calls of people in those areas for change and \r\ndevelopment. The unique features of those regions in \r\nterms of religion, civilization, history and ethnicity \r\nmust be respected. We hope that the relevant parties will \r\nsettle differences through inclusive and constructive \r\npolitical dialogue and that they will resolve problems \r\npeacefully. \r\nSafeguarding peace and stability in those areas, \r\nupholding the fundamental and long-term interests of \r\nArab countries and ensuring the growth of friendly \r\nChina-Arab relations will remain a central goal of \r\nChina’s policy towards such regions. We will continue \r\nto tirelessly strive, together with countries in those \r\nareas, to promote peace and development in line with \r\nthe purposes and principles of the Charter of the United \r\nNations.\r\nChina is deeply concerned about the stalled \r\nPalestinian-Israeli peace talks and the economic \r\nand humanitarian difficulties facing the Palestinian \r\npeople. The turbulence in the region should not divert \r\ninternational attention from the Palestinian issue. China \r\nsupports the Palestinian people in establishing, on the \r\nbasis of the 1967 border, an independent Palestinian State \r\nthat enjoys full sovereignty, with East Jerusalem as its \r\ncapital. China supports Palestine’s membership of the \r\nUnited Nations and other international organizations. \r\nChina urges both Palestine and Israel to take concrete \r\nmeasures to remove obstacles and to work for the early \r\nresumption and substantive progress of the peace talks.\r\nChina is deeply concerned about the ongoing \r\ntension and worsening humanitarian situation in \r\nSyria. We call on all relevant parties in Syria to put \r\n28 12-52349\r\nA/67/PV.14\r\nlocal economies and people’s lives in the countries \r\nconcerned. We have cancelled the debts owed to China \r\nby 50 heavily indebted poor and least-developed \r\ncountries. We have trained over 60,000 personnel in \r\nvarious sectors for 173 developing countries and 13 \r\nregional and international organizations. All of that has \r\ncontributed to the economic and social development of \r\nother developing countries.\r\nChina has taken an active part in reforming the \r\ninternational system and global governance, and \r\nassumed its due share of international responsibilities \r\nand obligations as its capabilities permit. We are \r\nworking to build a fair, equitable and non-discriminatory \r\nglobal trading system and a more equal and balanced \r\nnew global partnership for development. We support \r\na greater role for the Group of Twenty as the premier \r\nforum for international economic cooperation, as well \r\nas the efforts of emerging markets represented by the \r\nBRICS group — Brazil, Russia, India, China and South \r\nAfrica — aimed at exploring a new model of global \r\ncooperation.\r\nThe global economy is at a critical stage, and \r\nachieving full recovery and sustained growth will be a \r\nlong and difficult task. Last year, despite a challenging \r\neconomic environment both at home and abroad, China \r\nregistered a gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate \r\nof 9.3 per cent, and made good progress in adjusting its \r\neconomic structure and improving people’s lives. Since \r\nthe beginning of the year, in order to address some \r\nnew problems in economic performance, the Chinese \r\nGovernment has stepped up anticipatory fine-tuning of \r\nthe economy and introduced a series of targeted policy \r\nmeasures. That has boosted market confidence and \r\nensured steady growth. \r\nChina’s GDP grew by 7.8 per cent in the first half of \r\nthe year, and the country has enjoyed sound economic \r\nand social development. China is still in an important \r\nperiod of strategic opportunities for development. \r\nIndustrialization, urbanization, the application of \r\ninformation technology and agricultural modernization \r\nwill continue to unlock our great potential for \r\ndevelopment. We have the confidence, means and \r\nability to maintain steady and robust growth and \r\nachieve long-term, sound and sustainable development. \r\nDuring its twelfth five-year plan for the period \r\n2011-2015, China’s domestic market will become one of \r\nthe largest in the world. Its total imports are expected \r\nto exceed $10 trillion, and direct outbound investment \r\nAs an important participant in building the \r\ninternational system, China is committed to sharing \r\ndevelopment opportunities with other countries and \r\nto working with them to overcome various challenges \r\nand realize security and development for all. China \r\nwill stay the course of peaceful development. We seek \r\na peaceful international environment in which China \r\ncan promote its own development. By so doing, China \r\nwill contribute to global peace and development. China \r\nis firm in upholding its core interests. At the same \r\ntime, it respects the legitimate right of other countries \r\nto protect their interests. We seek to expand common \r\ninterests with other parties for the sake of the common \r\ngood. \r\nChina has contributed a total of some 21,000 \r\npersonnel to United Nations peacekeeping missions \r\nand taken an active part in international cooperation \r\non counter-terrorism, anti-piracy and non-proliferation \r\nefforts. In our efforts to resolve major international \r\nand regional hotspot issues, we have urged the parties \r\nconcerned to seek peaceful solutions through negotiation \r\nand thereby played an important and constructive role \r\nin easing tensions and achieving the political resolution \r\nof those issues. China has made remarkable progress \r\nin pursuing peaceful development and will continue to \r\nfollow that path in the years to come.\r\nChina will enhance friendly relations and \r\ncooperation with all other countries on the basis of \r\nthe five principles of peaceful coexistence and strive \r\nto promote a new type of relationship among major \r\ncountries based on mutual respect and win-win \r\ncooperation. Following a policy of building good \r\nrelationships and partnerships with neighbouring \r\ncountries, China has actively expanded exchanges with \r\nits neighbours.\r\nChina has contributed to over 50 per cent of \r\nAsia’s growth for many consecutive years. We have \r\nendeavoured to build mechanisms of mutual trust and \r\npolitical cooperation with other Asian countries and \r\nappropriately to address differences and frictions among \r\nrelevant countries. On the basis of firmly upholding \r\nChina’s sovereignty, security and territorial integrity, \r\nwe have worked with our neighbours to maintain sound \r\nrelations and overall stability in the region. China treats \r\nother developing countries as good friends and good \r\npartners; we therefore support each other and seek \r\ncommon development on the basis of equality. \r\nBy the end of 2011, the Chinese Government had \r\nbuilt over 2,200 projects that are important to the \r\n12-52349 29\r\nA/67/PV.14\r\nof individuals, nations and the planet. And it is about \r\nthe courage that comes with seeking peace with one’s \r\nenemies, as Yitzhak Rabin once told us. Leadership is \r\nalso about creating the conditions for people to choose \r\nhow to live their lives. Freedom is more than the mere \r\nabsence of physical or legal obstacles. \r\nThe very purpose of the United Nations is to \r\npromote freedom for all people — freedom from want, \r\nfreedom from fear, and the freedom to live in dignity. \r\nPeople are only truly free when they are able to choose \r\nthe way they want to live their own lives, regardless \r\nof race, gender or sexual orientation. It is the freedom \r\nof a woman to choose when to have children and also \r\nwhen not to have them. It is about her freedom from \r\nintrusion of her physical integrity, as well as her right \r\nto think and say what she wants. It is about the freedom \r\nthat allows mother and child to survive birth, and the \r\nfreedom that allows every child to live a healthy life, \r\nreceive education and walk to school without fear of \r\nland mines or cluster munitions. It is about the freedom \r\nof every man and every woman to organize, to speak \r\nout and to have their say as society progresses.\r\nThose freedoms lay the ground for development and \r\nprosperity. They give men and women a chance to build \r\na better future for themselves and for their families. \r\nSome people can only dream about those freedoms, but \r\nwhen they do exist they are often the result of collective \r\naction by families, communities, regions and States and \r\nat the global level. At the end of the day, that is why we \r\nare here in this Assembly.\r\nIn Syria, mass atrocities are continuing. The crisis \r\nin Syria started with a call for freedom and dignity \r\nthrough peaceful protests. The Syrian Government \r\nbears the primary responsibility. The privileges of the \r\nfew should no longer stand in the way of the aspirations \r\nof the many. The regime of Bashar Al-Assad has lost all \r\nlegitimacy and must cede power. The violence in Syria \r\nmust stop.\r\nEven in war, there are rules. All parties have clear \r\nresponsibilities under international humanitarian law. \r\nTo any party that commits violations of these principles, \r\nI say this: “You are all individually responsible. When \r\njustice prevails, you will be held accountable for the \r\ncrimes you have committed. Do not expect to be \r\npardoned by stating that your opponent committed the \r\nsame crime.”\r\nWhen the United Nations was formed in San \r\nFrancisco in 1945, we collectively decided to establish \r\nis expected to exceed $500 billion. That will create \r\nenormous business and job opportunities for the world \r\nand provide good opportunities for other countries’ \r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe Diaoyu Islands have been an integral part \r\nof China’s territory since ancient times. China has \r\nindisputable historical and legal evidence in that \r\nregard. Japan seized the islands in 1895 at the end of the \r\nSino-Japanese War and forced the Chinese Government \r\nof the time to sign an unequal treaty to cede the islands \r\nand other Chinese territories to Japan. After the Second \r\nWorld War, the Diaoyu Islands and other Chinese \r\nterritories occupied by Japan were returned to China \r\nin accordance with the Cairo Declaration, the Potsdam \r\nAgreement and other international documents. \r\nBy taking such unilateral actions as the so-called \r\nisland purchase, the Japanese Government has grossly \r\nviolated China’s sovereignty. This is an outright denial \r\nof the outcomes of the victorious anti-fascist World \r\nWar and poses a grave challenge to the post-war \r\ninternational order and the purposes and principles of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. The moves made by \r\nJapan are totally illegal and invalid. They can in no way \r\nchange the historical fact that Japan stole the Diaoyu \r\nIslands from China and that China has territorial \r\nsovereignty over them. The Chinese Government is \r\nfirm in upholding China’s territorial sovereignty. China \r\nstrongly urges Japan to immediately stop all activities \r\nviolating China’s territorial sovereignty, take concrete \r\naction to correct its mistakes and return to the path of \r\nresolving the dispute through negotiation.\r\nThe Communist Party of China will soon hold \r\nits eighteenth National Congress. We are confident \r\nthat the important meeting will lead China’s reform, \r\nopening-up and modernization drive to a new stage. \r\nThe facts have shown and will continue to prove that \r\nChina’s development is peaceful, open, cooperative and \r\nwin-win in nature. We will work with the international \r\ncommunity to follow the trend of history and the call \r\nof the times and build a harmonious world of enduring \r\npeace and shared prosperity.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Espen Barth Eide, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of Norway.\r\nMr. Eide (Norway): Leadership is about making \r\nchoices. It is about the ability to make the right decision \r\nat the right moment and to have the stamina to deliver \r\naccordingly. It is about the will to help shape the future \r\n30 12-52349\r\nA/67/PV.14\r\nIn Colombia, the Government and representatives \r\nof the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia \r\nhave made the wise choice of entering into formal \r\nnegotiations in order to end another age-old conflict.\r\nAs Norway’s Foreign Minister, I am the Chair of \r\nthe Ad Hoc Liaison Committee for the Coordination \r\nof International Assistance to Palestinians. We met on \r\nthe eve of this session of the General Assembly. I want \r\nto take this opportunity to share with Member States \r\nmy deep concern about the state of play in the Israel-\r\nPalestine relationship. Exactly one year ago, we agreed \r\nhere in New York that the Palestinian State-building \r\nprocess had reached a level where the institutions of \r\nState were in place. Great expectations were created, \r\nonly to be frustrated. \r\nTime is running short — shorter than many seem \r\nto understand. There is significant fatigue among the \r\nPalestinian population. They may become inspired \r\nto look for alternative options — options that would \r\nseverely hamper the prospects of Palestinians and \r\nIsraelis alike. I see a similar fatigue emerging among the \r\ncountries that are funding the Palestinian authorities.\r\nThe two-State solution is the only path to sustainable \r\npeace, but the prospect of realizing a Palestinian State \r\nbased on the two-State solution is diminishing as the \r\nexpansion of Israeli settlements continues. Those \r\nactions remain the main obstacle to peace and they must \r\nstop. To get the peace process back on track, we need \r\nto break the impasse and reinstall the trust in a political \r\nhorizon based on the final status issues. Negotiations \r\nremain the key to achieve that; they must start now.\r\nLeadership is also about trust. To achieve our \r\ngoals, we need a strong United Nations. I applaud the \r\nSecretary-General’s tireless efforts aimed at reforming \r\nthe internal workings of the Organization. We have \r\nelected a Secretary-General to lead, but we must allow \r\nhim to do so. Intergovernmental micromanagement \r\nof what would be the chief executive’s prerogative in \r\nany modern organization is nothing but the opposite of \r\nmaking the United Nations work.\r\nTo conclude, leaders have real choices. Leaders \r\nhave real responsibilities. Humankind shapes its own \r\nfuture. Failing to solve the most critical challenges \r\nof our time not only harms those who suffer under \r\npoverty, war or oppression; it also deprives people of \r\nthe conviction that they too can shape their own future. \r\nAnd that very conviction, that belief in oneself and each \r\nother, is what will make freedom from want, freedom \r\na Security Council to act on our behalf. The permanent \r\nmembers were then entrusted with the right of veto. My \r\ncountry’s delegation at the time was led by Mr. Trygve \r\nLie, who would later become the Organization’s first \r\nSecretary-General. On behalf of my country, he cast his \r\nvote in favour of the right of veto for the five permanent \r\nmembers, as did many other small and medium-sized \r\ncountries. They did so not only to reflect the world \r\norder of the day, but also to ensure that the Council \r\nwould have genuine authority to make decisions and be \r\nable to act on our behalf. They did not do so because \r\nthey held certain States to be superior to others. \r\nTherefore, and in the light of the Syrian drama, my \r\nmessage to the members of the Security Council is that \r\npeople in the Arab world, in Europe, in Asia, in Africa \r\nand in the Americas are watching with horror how \r\nhistory is repeating itself. Once again, the permanent \r\nmembers of the Security Council are divided and \r\nunable to protect people on the ground. In its absence, \r\nextremists on all sides are free to kill, maim and rape. \r\nWe now expect the members of the Council to act. We \r\nexpect them to put away outdated ideas of zero-sum \r\ngames or spheres of influence and to strive to seek a \r\ncommon position. Enough blood has been shed.\r\nThe verdict is harsh against those who choose the \r\nwrong side of history. They must not allow narrow \r\nself-interest to block the winds of change that the \r\nvast majority of members of this Assembly applaud. \r\nPresident Al-Assad of Syria was not forced to take the \r\npath of conflict and confrontation; he could have opted \r\nfor compromise and cooperation. Elsewhere in the \r\nworld, quite different choices are being made.\r\nToday in this Assembly, we have heard how \r\nMyanmar’s reformist President Thein Sein is opening \r\nthe door for a free and democratic Myanmar. I commend \r\nthe courage shown by the Myanmar Government. I also \r\ncommend the courage of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. She \r\nhas chosen to talk to the very people who once held her \r\nin confinement.\r\nEarlier today in Addis Ababa, the leaders of the \r\nSudan and South Sudan made the choice to end the \r\nbloody conflict that has marred their peoples’ lives for \r\ndecades. The Sudan and South Sudan had again been \r\non the brink of war, but by signing today’s agreements \r\nthey have opted for peace. We salute the African Union, \r\nwhich has, in close partnership with the Security \r\nCouncil, helped make that choice possible.\r\n12-52349 31\r\nA/67/PV.14\r\nconducted municipal elections in the 1920s and \r\nparliamentary elections in the past few decades. \r\nImportant results have been achieved in providing a \r\ngreater degree of equality, participation, transparency, \r\npolitical rights and human dignity. That is truly a \r\nhistorical milestone on the path towards building a \r\nsociety based on competitive sustainability, justice, \r\nthe rule of law, equality and the consecration of the \r\nprinciples of popular participation and representation \r\nin the decision-making process.\r\nNotwithstanding all those remarkable national \r\nachievements, since last year the Kingdom of Bahrain \r\nhas faced some serious challenges to its security and \r\nstability, which it has addressed in full transparency, \r\ncommitment and honesty. In that context, we established \r\nthe Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry to \r\nascertain the truth and provide redress. Consequently, \r\nwe launched a comprehensive dialogue among the \r\nvarious sectors of society that resulted in a series of \r\nconstitutional and legislative reforms encompassing all \r\naspects of life — political, economic, social and legal.\r\nAgainst that backdrop, His Majesty King Hamad \r\nbin Issa Al Khalifa of Bahrain proposed the creation of \r\nan Arab court of human rights to lay the foundations of \r\nan environment conducive to the protection of human \r\nrights and the prevention of their abuse in the Arab \r\nworld, using the model of the Inter-American Court of \r\nHuman Rights, the European Court of Human Rights \r\nand the African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights. \r\nThe Council of the League of Arab States endorsed that \r\nhistorical initiative, and arrangements are currently \r\nunder way to establish the legal basis for the court’s \r\nestablishment. We hope that the court will become a \r\nreality in the near future.\r\nLast week, consistent with our efforts to build \r\na pluralistic Bahraini society and in full respect for \r\nthe protection and enhancement of human rights, the \r\nKingdom of Bahrain approved more than 90 per cent \r\nof the recommendations made by the Human Rights \r\nCouncil in Geneva during its Universal Periodic Review, \r\nincluding a possible accession to the Optional Protocol \r\nto the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, \r\nInhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.\r\nThe challenges and threats facing our region have \r\nled the States members of the Gulf Cooperation Council \r\nto realize the need for greater synergies among them. \r\nThey have endorsed the proposal of the Custodian of \r\nthe Two Holy Mosques, King Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz \r\nfrom fear and the freedom to live in dignity possible for \r\nall. That is the purpose of our leadership.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Shaikh Khalid Bin Ahmed \r\nAl-Khalifa, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the \r\nKingdom of Bahrain.\r\nShaikh Khalid Bin Ahmed Al-Khalifa (Bahrain) \r\n(spoke in Arabic): It gives me pleasure to congratulate \r\nMr. Vuk Jeremić on his election as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. I \r\nam confident that he will successfully manage the \r\nsession thanks to his competence and his rich and long \r\nexperience in diplomacy in the service of his friendly \r\ncountry, the Republic of Serbia. I also express our great \r\nappreciation for the President of the Assembly at its last \r\nsession, Ambassador Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser of \r\nthe fraternal State of Qatar, and thank him for the vital \r\nrole he played, the constructive issues he advanced and \r\nhis excellent management of the work of the sixty-sixth \r\nsession. We are proud of him as a seasoned diplomat \r\nfrom a State member of the Gulf Cooperation Council, \r\nand wish him every success in his future endeavours.\r\nLet me also express our great appreciation for \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon and thank him for \r\nthe strenuous efforts he has made to enhance the \r\neffective role of the Organization in various fields. We \r\nlook forward to a renewed role for the United Nations \r\ncompatible with the Secretary-General’s new vision so \r\nthat the Organization will be able to address the major \r\nchallenges before it.\r\nSince joining the United Nations, the Kingdom \r\nof Bahrain has worked tirelessly to promote the noble \r\npurposes and principles of the United Nations, in \r\nparticular, the maintenance of peace and security and \r\nthe development of cooperation and friendly relations \r\namong nations on the basis of mutual respect. Guided \r\nby full respect for those principles, I am honoured to \r\nrepresent a country that acts upon its international \r\ncommitments and has laid the foundations of a modern \r\nState through initiatives, planning and political and \r\norganizational vision. We seek to build a modern \r\nsociety that is well organized and committed to its \r\nvalues in various fields, notably education, health, \r\nemployment, vocational training, economic reform and \r\nthe advancement of women. \r\nOur country, Bahrain, has opted for dialogue as \r\nan approach to all its modernization efforts aimed \r\nat meeting the requirements of its long history. We \r\n32 12-52349\r\nA/67/PV.14\r\nthe international community. The Kingdom of Bahrain \r\nbelieves that it is imperative to redouble efforts towards \r\na just, durable and comprehensive solution, notably \r\nthrough the creation of an independent Palestinian State, \r\nwith East Jerusalem as its capital, in conformity with \r\nthe relevant United Nations resolutions, the Arab Peace \r\nInitiative and the decisions of the international Quartet. \r\nWe are extremely concerned at attempts to violate the \r\nsanctity of the holy sites in Al-Quds Al-Sharif and the \r\nattempts to alter their identity. \r\nWe call on the international community to \r\nsupport Mahmoud Abbas, President of the State of \r\nPalestine, who is striving relentlessly to defend the \r\ncause of his occupied country and to achieve a just and \r\ncomprehensive peace in the region. We therefore urge \r\nthe international community to demand that Israel cease \r\nits settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian \r\nterritories and dismantle settlements that jeopardize \r\nthe chances for peace. We also stress the need to \r\nimplement the relevant General Assembly and Security \r\nCouncil resolutions by putting an end to ongoing Israeli \r\nviolations and aggression, and to ensure the principles \r\nof international legitimacy, notably the Fourth Geneva \r\nConvention of 1949, which prohibits any geographical \r\nor demographic alteration in occupied territories. We \r\nlook forward to peace in our region, which would serve \r\nthe interests of all its peoples.\r\nOne tenet of our foreign policy is to enhance peace \r\nand security in the region. In that regard, Bahrain \r\nreaffirms its unflinching position in favour of a \r\nnuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. That will \r\nbe possible only by compelling Israel to implement \r\nrelevant international resolutions, to adhere to the \r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, \r\nand to subject its nuclear facilities to the supervision of \r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). \r\nMoreover, we stress that the Islamic Republic of \r\nIran must fulfil its commitments in full and transparent \r\ncooperation with the IAEA. Indeed, nuclear weapons \r\nconstitute a serious threat to peace and security in the \r\nentire region, and various parties must therefore assume \r\ntheir responsibility for peace and security and refrain \r\nfrom the language of intimidation, threats and counter-\r\nthreats that have recently dominated our region.\r\nIn that regard, we stress the importance of an \r\nexcellent preparation process for the 2012 conference \r\nto be held pursuant to the agreement reached in the \r\nFinal Document of the 2010 Review Conference of \r\nthe Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \r\nAl-Saud, to move from cooperation to union as a \r\nmeans of addressing those challenges and threats and \r\nbuilding capacities to achieve a Gulf Cooperation \r\nCouncil society based on a shared vision of the future \r\nthat responds to the accelerating pace of the world and \r\nanswers to the aspirations of the peoples of the Gulf \r\nregion. They are convinced that their interests and \r\ngains can be served only through solidarity and unity \r\nwith a view to preserving national independence and \r\nState sovereignty and to meeting the needs arising \r\nfrom the strategic transformations on the regional and \r\ninternational scenes.\r\nMy country believes that the United Nations has an \r\nindispensable role to play in addressing international \r\nand regional problems and finding appropriate \r\nsolutions to them. Our region dearly needs that role \r\nto be fulfilled, given the catastrophic and fast-paced \r\ndevelopments taking place in Syria. The international \r\ncommunity, represented by the United Nations and \r\nits organs and bodies entrusted with the maintenance \r\nof international peace and security, is called upon \r\nto unify its position with a view to putting an end to \r\nthe humanitarian suffering of the Syrian people and \r\nfinding a political solution to the crisis that will end \r\nthe violence and bloodshed, preserve the unity of Syria \r\nand the cohesion of its people, and spare the region as a \r\nwhole serious repercussions that could spill far beyond \r\nthe borders of Syria. \r\nThe United Nations must therefore shoulder \r\nits responsibilities to protect unarmed civilians \r\nwithout allowing the Organization’s procedures and \r\nmechanisms to impede its ability to prevent crimes \r\nagainst humanity from being committed. It must set \r\naside narrow geopolitical interests and proceed to \r\nattain the supreme goal of protecting civilians in armed \r\nconflicts and wars. My Government welcomes the \r\nappointment of Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi as Joint Special \r\nRepresentative of the United Nations and the League \r\nof Arab States, and wishes him every success in his \r\nendeavours to achieve the legitimate demands of the \r\nbrotherly Syrian people.\r\nOn the basis of the same humanitarian principle, \r\nwe should also stand by the Rohingya Muslims in \r\nMyanmar in their ordeal and provide them with \r\nassistance and support while providing good counsel to \r\nthe Government of Myanmar in that regard.\r\nAlthough the Syrian crisis is preoccupying \r\nthe international community today, the Palestinian \r\nquestion remains the core issue for the Arab States and \r\n12-52349 33\r\nA/67/PV.14\r\nthe peaceful settlement of the Moroccan Sahara issue \r\npursuant to relevant Security Council resolutions.\r\nIn regard to the current political developments \r\nin Somalia, the Kingdom of Bahrain welcomes the \r\nelection of Mr. Hassan Sheikh Mohamud as the new \r\nPresident of the Somali Republic in the context of \r\nthe transitional process. We call on the international \r\ncommunity to offer its support and assistance in the \r\nrestoration of peace and security in the country and in \r\nthe preservation of Somalia’s territorial integrity and \r\npolitical independence. We commend the efforts of the \r\nSomali Government, together with the international \r\ncommunity, to restore peace, stability and cooperation, \r\nparticularly in combating piracy in the Horn of Africa.\r\nWe have recently witnessed ugly insults and \r\ndenigration addressed to our beloved Prophet \r\nMuhammad — peace be upon him, his family and \r\nhis companions. A typical example of that is the \r\nshameful video that the Kingdom of Bahrain condemns \r\nin the strongest terms, and which led to violence \r\nand destruction around the world. Our concern is \r\ncompounded by the unjustified aggression perpetrated \r\nagainst the diplomatic mission of the United States \r\nof America in Benghazi that killed Ambassador \r\nChristopher Stevens and a number of innocent \r\nAmerican diplomats, in f lagrant violation of the Vienna \r\nConvention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961.\r\nIn spite of these serious developments and \r\nrepercussions, we should not let that gloomy scene \r\novershadow the spectacle of the crowds that took to \r\nthe streets in Libya the following day to condemn that \r\nabominable attack on the American mission. We are \r\nall responsible, as peoples and nations, to teach each \r\nother about respect. We need to redouble our efforts to \r\nprevent the recurrence of insults to religions, prophets \r\nand other religious symbols as Allah commands us in \r\nthe Holy Koran: \r\n“We have created you from male and female \r\nand made you peoples and tribes that you may \r\nknow one another. Indeed, the most noble of you \r\nin the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you. \r\nIndeed, Allah is all-knowing and acquainted” \r\n(The Holy Koran, XLIX:13). \r\nThe Kingdom of Bahrain is among the first to \r\nhave achieved most of the Millenium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs) before the prescribed time frame in the \r\nfields of education, the empowerment of women, the \r\nexpansion of social security to vulnerable groups, equal \r\nof Nuclear Weapons (NPT/CONF.2010/50 (Vol. I)). \r\nWe also reaffirm that the principle of establishing \r\na nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East in no \r\nway precludes the right of all nations to access nuclear \r\ntechnology for peaceful purposes, provided that they \r\ndo so in full transparency and abide by the IAEA \r\nguarantee system.\r\nWhile the States members of the Gulf Cooperation \r\nCouncil (GCC) have extended their hand to their \r\nneighbour, the Islamic Republic of Iran, they have \r\nunfortunately found no positive Iranian response that \r\ncould facilitate confidence-building, peace and security. \r\nOn the contrary, we have had to endure constant \r\ninterference in our internal affairs from our neighbour. \r\nRecently, Iran has reiterated menacing threats to GCC \r\nMember States, in contradiction of the spirit of good-\r\nneighbourliness, thus generating tension and distrust in \r\nthe region. More importantly, the Kingdom of Bahrain \r\nreaffirms the need, either through direct negotiations \r\nor through arbitration by the International Court of \r\nJustice, to resolve the problem of the three United \r\nArab Emirates’ islands of Abu Musa, Greater Tunb and \r\nLesser Tunb that are occupied by the Islamic Republic \r\nof Iran.\r\nWith regard to the situation in brotherly Yemen, \r\nwe are aware of the need for a successful transitional \r\nperiod in order to achieve security and stability \r\nin the country, in line with the agreement reached \r\nwithin the framework of the GCC initiative and its \r\nimplementation mechanisms. We welcome the steps \r\ntaken by Mr. Abdrabuh Mansour Hadi Mansour, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Yemen, to launch a national \r\nYemeni dialogue, and we are fully confident of his wise \r\nleadership of Yemen during this critical transitional \r\nperiod, so that the aspirations of the Yemeni people can \r\nbe realized.\r\nIn that regard, the Kingdom of Bahrain welcomes \r\nthe convening of the donors conference for Yemen, \r\nheld in Riyadh and sponsored by the Kingdom of \r\nSaudi Arabia, and fully supports the recommendations \r\nand conclusions agreed upon with a view to building \r\na brighter future for brotherly Yemen, as well as the \r\noutcome of the meeting of the Friends of Yemen, held \r\ntoday in New York.\r\nWe also reaffirm the unwavering, principled and \r\nconsistent position of the Kingdom of Bahrain, in \r\nsolidarity with the Kingdom of Morocco, regarding the \r\npreservation of the territorial integrity of Morocco and \r\n34 12-52349\r\nA/67/PV.14\r\nto achieve the progress, dignity and prosperity to which \r\nour peoples aspire.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the f loor to Mr. Edouard Niankoye Lama, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs and for Guineans Living Abroad of \r\nthe Republic of Guinea.\r\nMr. Lama (Guinea) (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nthe delegation of Guinea, which I have the great \r\nhonour to lead, I would like first of all to congratulate \r\nthe President on his election to guide the work of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-seventh session at a time \r\nwhen our Organization is facing multiple challenges. \r\nThat mark of trust placed in him is a vibrant tribute \r\nto his country, the Republic of Serbia, as well as to \r\nhis recognized diplomatic qualities, which augur well \r\nfor the success of our deliberations. His predecessor, \r\nMr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, of Qatar, deserves our \r\ngratitude and thanks for his excellent work. I should also \r\nlike to express my Government’s highest appreciation \r\nto the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his \r\ndynamism and determination in the exercise of his \r\nmandate.\r\nThe theme of this session, “Bringing about \r\nadjustment or settlement of international disputes or \r\nsituations by peaceful means”, lies at the very heart of \r\nthe uncertainty that weighs on the future of humanity. \r\nThe emergence of new forms of violence at the hands \r\nof numerous actors and non-State groups, international \r\nterrorism, and above all the proliferation of small arms \r\nand light weapons, all constitute grounds for concern. \r\nWhile inter-State conflicts have decreased in recent \r\nyears, intra-State conflicts in certain regions of the \r\nworld have led to political instability, general insecurity \r\nand human tragedies, with their attendant economic, \r\nsocial and environmental crises.\r\nIt follows that the peaceful settlement of disputes, \r\nas a fundamental principle of international relations, \r\nis becoming more indispensable than ever for the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. That \r\nprinciple requires sustainable preventive strategies and \r\nconcerted efforts on the part of regional and subregional \r\norganizations along with international development \r\npartners. The critical need for States to promote and \r\ndefend the purposes and principles of the United \r\nNations Charter and of international law is the bulwark \r\npar excellence against attempts against the territorial \r\nintegrity and sovereignty of States.\r\nopportunities for men and women, and the enhancement \r\nof health services, notably for children. Therefore, the \r\nKingdom of Bahrain occupies an advanced position \r\nat the global level, as reflected in the United Nations \r\nHuman Development Reports issued during the past \r\nfew years.\r\nIf the international community is to overcome the \r\nchallenges facing Member States, we must be able to \r\nfully shoulder their responsibilities, especially as the \r\ndeadline for achieving the MDGs is approaching. We are \r\nonly three and a half years from that deadline. We have \r\nto redouble our efforts and review our policies in order \r\nto enhance national and regional capacities to avoid \r\nimbalances and to overcome challenges. According \r\nto the Millennium Development Goals Report 2012, \r\nand notwithstanding some negative indicators, child \r\nmortality has been decreasing across the world, the \r\npercentage of those living in extreme poverty has been \r\nhalved, and over 89 per cent of the world’s population \r\nnow has access to safe drinking water.\r\nHowever, it seems that other objectives are still \r\nunattainable in many countries, and inequalities \r\ncontinue to rise in some areas such as public health that \r\nremains dismal and a cause for great concern. That also \r\napplies to the scarcity of water resources. We therefore \r\ncannot use the global financial crisis as an excuse \r\nfor reneging on our financial commitments to those \r\ncountries in greatest need.\r\nIn that regard, Bahrain welcomes the outcome \r\nof the United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, as well as the Secretary-General’s vision \r\nwith regard to sustainable development. Much remains \r\nto be done, however, to ensure that people across the \r\nworld not only have access to the most basic needs, but \r\nthat they have the tools to maintain them over time. \r\nWe must acknowledge that sustainability is not merely \r\na response to needs but rather a principal element of \r\nhuman dignity.\r\nTo conclude, I believe that the formidable changes \r\nand challenges our world faces today present valuable \r\nopportunities that we can exploit through wisdom, \r\ncourage, patience and joint action. We must work with \r\nall our capacity to address the elements that divide us, \r\nparticularly backwardness, extremism and isolationism. \r\nAt the same time, we must continue to lend a hand \r\nto those most in need. We must use objectivity and \r\nhonesty to challenge immobility and prejudice in order \r\n12-52349 35\r\nA/67/PV.14\r\nreconciliation in that country. The Government of \r\nGuinea would like, at this time, to express its warmest \r\ncongratulations to the African Union Military Observer \r\nMission in Somalia.\r\nGuinea also supports the ongoing negotiations \r\nbetween the Governments of the Sudan and South Sudan \r\nregarding post-independence issues, in accordance \r\nwith the African Union road map of 24 April 2011, \r\nas approved by the Security Council in its resolution \r\n2046 (2012). We welcome the agreement reached by the \r\nparties on sharing petroleum revenue.\r\nIn the Middle East, the restoration of lasting \r\npeace in the region must of necessity depend on the \r\ncreation of an independent Palestinian State, living \r\nin peace and security side by side with the State of \r\nIsrael. The situation in Syria increasingly cries out to \r\nthe international community. We urge the concerned \r\nparties to spare no efforts to halt the violence, protect \r\nthe population and restore peace. My Government \r\nreaffirms its support for the declaration on Syria of \r\nthe recent extraordinary session of the Organization of \r\nIslamic Cooperation.\r\nThe adoption on 21 June of the outcome document \r\n(resolution 66/288, annex) of the United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) \r\noffered the international community an opportunity \r\nto renew its political commitment to sustainable \r\ndevelopment in all its dimensions — economic, social \r\nand environmental. The priority of the international \r\ncommunity today should be the effective implementation \r\nof the commitments made to take into account the \r\nlegitimate concerns of all countries, in particular in \r\nAfrica. To that end, Guinea remains convinced that \r\ndefining a post-2015 development agenda must take \r\ninto account the complementarity of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) and the sustainable \r\ndevelopment goals resulting from Rio+20 in order to \r\nensure maximum benefit from the subsequent synergy.\r\nIn consideration of Africa’s post-2015 development \r\nagenda, at the proposal of my country, the fifth Joint \r\nAnnual Meetings of the African Union Conference of \r\nMinisters of Economy and Finance and the Economic \r\nCommission for Africa Conference of African Ministers \r\nof Finance, Planning and Economic Development, held \r\nin Addis Ababa in March, and the seventeenth session of \r\nthe High-level Committee on South-South Cooperation, \r\nheld in New York in May, agreed to promote South-\r\nSouth and triangular coalition.\r\nInternational mediation as a means of prevention \r\nor a way to end violence through dialogue, along with \r\nnegotiation and the achievement of final agreements, \r\nshould be given pride of place. In that context, the \r\nGuinean delegation encourages the rapid deployment \r\nof mediators and experts. It also wishes to offer its \r\nemphatic support to the Secretary-General’s initiative \r\nencouraging the role of women in the mediation process.\r\nIn developing States, especially in Africa, \r\nmediation and settlement mechanisms should be \r\nstrengthened through capacity-building and the \r\nallocation of sufficient resources to assure a holistic \r\nand effective approach. The institutionalization at the \r\nnational, regional and international levels of a culture \r\nof peace that includes dialogue between civilizations \r\nand religious tolerance is the irreversible path towards \r\na world of solidarity and peace.\r\nIn West Africa, where the northern part of our \r\nneighbour, Mali, has been occupied for months \r\nby terrorist and rebel groups, the strengthening of \r\ndemocratic institutions and the restoration of territorial \r\nintegrity constitute the primary challenges of note. \r\nGuinea reiterates its support for the initiatives of the \r\nEconomic Community of Western African States and \r\nthe African Union in their search for a solution to that \r\ncrisis, whose effects on the countries of the subregion \r\ncould well be devastating. In that regard, Guinea joins \r\nthe Government of Mali in urgently demanding the \r\nSecurity Council to deploy an international contingent \r\nto restore the territorial integrity of that brother country. \r\nIn Guinea-Bissau, the consolidation of peace and \r\nstability requires the restoration of all democratic \r\ninstitutions. With respect to the Great Lakes countries, \r\nwe support the efforts of the international community \r\nand the Central African Economic and Monetary \r\nCommunity, which seek to restore peace and security \r\nin the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo, which is fundamental for the stability of that \r\ncountry and the region.\r\nIn the Horn of Africa, there has been encouraging \r\nprogress with respect to the peace process in Somalia. \r\nThe implementation of a new federal Parliament, the \r\nadoption of a new interim Constitution and the election \r\non 10 September of Mr. Hassan Sheikh Mohamud \r\nas President of the Republic, all demonstrate the \r\ncommitment of the Somali people, the Intergovernmental \r\nAuthority on Development, the African Union and \r\nthe United Nations to support peace, democracy and \r\n36 12-52349\r\nA/67/PV.14\r\njudiciary. We are convinced that strengthening the \r\nsecurity and stability of the country and of the subregion \r\ndepend on that. \r\nIn the economic and social field, there has been \r\nsignificant progress in combating the macroeconomic \r\nimbalances and in improving prospects for growth and \r\npeople’s living conditions.\r\nThose policies enabled Guinea to reach the \r\ncompletion point of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries \r\nInitiative a few days ago, following meetings of the \r\nExecutive Boards of the International Monetary Fund \r\nand the World Bank. The subsequent foreign debt relief \r\nwill make it possible to release significant financial \r\nresources to investment in basic social services to \r\nalleviate poverty. The normalization of relations with \r\ncreditors, restoring the State’s credibility, will promote \r\naccess to new foreign financial resources. However, \r\nthe Government of Guinea is aware that reaching the \r\ncompletion point is only a first step and that many \r\nchallenges must be overcome to launch the country \r\non the path of sustainable growth. Our objective is to \r\nrapidly raise the country to the ranks of an emerging \r\neconomy through the exploitation of its natural \r\nresources.\r\nI would like to conclude by reiterating Guinea’s \r\nfirm support for efforts to reform the General \r\nAssembly and the Security Council so as to strengthen \r\nthe effectiveness and democratic governance of our \r\nuniversal Organization.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now call \r\non His Excellency Mr. Rafael Roncagliolo Orbegoso, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Peru.\r\nMr. Roncagliolo Orbegoso (Peru) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): At the outset, on behalf of President Ollanta \r\nHumala Tasso and the Government and people of Peru, \r\nI wish to congratulate the President of the General \r\nAssembly on his election to lead this session, during \r\nwhich we are very honoured to support him as one of \r\nthe Vice-Presidents. I would also like to congratulate \r\nhim on his initiative to make the pacific settlement of \r\ndisputes the central topic of our debate. The pacific \r\nsettlement of disputes is the fundamental way to \r\neradicate the scourge of war, which, in turn, is the \r\nmain objective of the Organization and its Charter. The \r\ncommitment not to resort to the threat or use of force \r\nis the cornerstone of international peace and security.\r\nPeru reaffi rms its ongoing and resolute commitment \r\nto the principles that inspired the birth of the United \r\nSouth-South and triangular cooperation is now \r\nbecoming a new modality for international cooperation \r\nin order to deal with the debt and financial market \r\ncrises and the lack of traditional official development \r\nassistance and implement international development \r\ngoals, such as the MDGs and the Istanbul Programme \r\nof Action, among others. From this rostrum, I would \r\nlike to launch an urgent appeal to all Member States \r\nand development partners to support that innovative \r\ninitiative of solidarity by the international community \r\ntowards Africa. The continent remains the weakest link \r\nin the international development mechanism despite its \r\nvast potential and its economic performance in recent \r\nyears.\r\nSince the election in 2010 of President Alpha Condé \r\nto the highest office, the Government has undertaken \r\nan vast programme of democratization and political, \r\ninstitutional, economic and social reforms. At the \r\npolitical level, a law on the fair reconstitution of the \r\nIndependent National Electoral Commission, adopted \r\nby the National Transition Council, was approved by \r\nthe President. We hope that that will open the way for \r\nthe holding of legislative elections by the end of the \r\nyear.\r\nI would like to reiterate the Government’s \r\ncommitment to continuing to promote human rights \r\nand to ensure public freedoms. To meet the various \r\nchallenges facing the country following the 2010 \r\npresidential election, the Government has submitted \r\nto the Peacebuilding Commission a request for support \r\nand assistance in three priority areas, namely, national \r\nreconciliation and unity, security sector reform and \r\nyouth and women’s employment. \r\nThose priorities resulted in a statement of \r\nmutual commitment, adopted here in New York on \r\n23 September 2011 in the presence of our Head of \r\nState. A year later, the implementation of those mutual \r\ncommitments has produced encouraging results thanks \r\nto the significant efforts of the Government, the United \r\nNations and other partners. I would especially like to \r\nwelcome the significant progress in security sector \r\nreform, in particular the biometric census of troops and \r\nthe retirement of nearly 4,000 soldiers.\r\nIn order to build on those achievements, we believe \r\nthat Guinea and its partners should benefit from the \r\nmomentum and trust created by those initial steps to \r\ncontinue the reform by extending it to all components \r\nof the security sector, in particular the police and the \r\n12-52349 37\r\nA/67/PV.14\r\nPeru also condemns once again the unfair, \r\nillegitimate and illegal economic, financial and \r\ncommercial blockade imposed against Cuba, to which \r\nthe Organization has been unable to put an end despite \r\nthe countless condemnations from the Assembly.\r\nWe also regret that it has not yet been possible \r\nto find a solution to the nearly 200-year-old dispute \r\nbetween Argentina and the United Kingdom regarding \r\nthe Malvinas Islands. We call upon the parties once \r\nagain to initiate a dialogue leading to a negotiated \r\nsolution.\r\nTo overcome these and other shortcomings and \r\ndeficiencies of the current international order, it is \r\nurgent to adopt measures within our own Organization, \r\nthe most urgent one probably being a reform of the \r\nSecurity Council aimed at making it a more efficient, \r\ntransparent, democratic and representative forum. The \r\nUnited Nations must reflect the realities of the twenty-\r\nfirst century and update the current architecture, which \r\nremains best suited to the post-war world of 1945. The \r\ncurrent scenario requires that developing countries take \r\ngreater responsibility for preserving peace and security. \r\nWe deplore the limited progress made in negotiations on \r\nthis issue. We consider that the time is ripe to relaunch \r\nthe reform process, and we call upon Member States \r\nto spare no effort in bringing this process to a speedy \r\nconclusion.\r\nAs a concrete sign of Peru’s contribution to \r\nstrengthening the rule of law, it was my pleasure to \r\ndeposit yesterday the instruments of ratification of \r\nthe Convention for the Protection of All Persons from \r\nEnforced Disappearance and the Convention on Cluster \r\nMunitions, as well as the amendments to the Montreal \r\nProtocol regarding ozone-depleting substances. We call \r\non all countries to accede to these instruments, which \r\nare aimed at protecting the environment, ensuring \r\nrespect for human rights and fighting against all \r\nforms of impunity. It is a moral duty to ensure that the \r\nperpetrators of serious crimes against humanity are \r\nduly tried and punished.\r\nThe rule of law also requires more inclusive \r\nsocieties. Civil, political and social citizenship must \r\nencompass everyone equally. Accordingly, Peru has \r\nincorporated into its national legislation the provisions \r\nof Convention 169 of the International Labour \r\nOrganization. Since Peru is the first country to adopt \r\nthese measures, its indigenous peoples will be able to \r\nfully exercise their rights and ensure that all investors \r\nNations: multilateralism, the pursuit of international \r\npeace and security, solidarity and cooperation. In \r\nthat context, Peru solemnly affirms its continuing \r\ncommitment to the pacific settlement of disputes.\r\nIn that task, the International Court of Justice, as \r\nthe main judicial organ of the United Nations system, \r\nplays a fundamental and, fortunately, increasing role, \r\nin particular in Latin America. Peru reaffirms its full \r\nrespect for the work of the Court and calls on States to \r\nturn to it to resolve their differences and to respect and \r\ncomply with its decisions, pursuant to Chapter XIV of \r\nthe United Nations Charter.\r\nThe 123 disputes that had been submitted to the \r\nCourt as at December 2011 are proof of the fact that \r\nthe international community is actively committed to \r\nthe pacific settlement of disputes, to diplomacy and \r\nnot to war. Recourse to the Court, far from being an \r\nunfriendly act, is an eloquent testimony to our desire \r\nfor peace.\r\nWe reiterate our faith in multilateralism and \r\ndeplore the existence of situations to which, to date, our \r\nOrganization has not been able to find solutions. The \r\nlatest and most painful one of these, due to the high toll \r\nit is taking in human lives, is the crisis in Syria. Peru \r\ncondemns the use of force and violence in that country, \r\nand calls once again on all parties to the conflict to \r\nimmediately cease hostilities and to initiate a genuine \r\nprocess of dialogue and peacemaking, in the framework \r\nof respect for the independence and sovereignty of that \r\ncountry and for the fundamental rights and freedoms \r\nof its citizens. \r\nWe support the efforts undertaken by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and the Arab League to find a negotiated and \r\npeaceful solution to the conflict. We would encourage \r\nthe mission of the Joint Special Representative, Lakhdar \r\nBrahimi, to continue its efforts.\r\nHowever, that is not the only outstanding issue. Peru \r\ndeems regrettable the fact that in more than 60 years \r\nour Organization has not been able to find a solution \r\nto the legitimate demand of the Palestinian people to \r\nestablish an independent State and to live in peace \r\nwithin secure and internationally recognized borders. \r\nPeru recognizes the Palestinian State, has established \r\ndiplomatic relations with it and, based on Peru’s \r\nhistorical position since 1947 and on international law, \r\nsupports its admission as a full Member of the United \r\nNations, without detriment to Israel’s right to its own \r\nsecurity.\r\n38 12-52349\r\nA/67/PV.14\r\nparty to the main disarmament and non-proliferation \r\ntreaties. Furthermore, Peru hosts the headquarters \r\nof the Regional Centre for Peace, Disarmament and \r\nDevelopment in Latin America and the Caribbean. \r\nWe promote confidence-building measures with \r\nneighbouring countries, especially measures aimed at \r\nconventional disarmament to favour the development \r\nof our peoples. In that context, we cannot but welcome \r\nwith enthusiasm and high expectations the efforts made \r\nby the Government of President Santos Calderón of \r\nColombia to open the path of dialogue in order to end \r\nlong years of violence, as justly claimed by the people \r\nof Colombia. Peru expresses its best wishes for the \r\nsuccess of that initiative.\r\nFrom the South American perspective, we also \r\naspire to build bridges with all the regions of the world. \r\nIn such a spirit, Peru will in a few days welcome heads \r\nof State and Government of South American and Arab \r\ncountries to the third Summit of South American and \r\nArab Countries. The Summit has become an important \r\ninstrument in bringing the two regions closer together \r\nand, through it, its member countries have opened a \r\nchannel for dialogue and political understanding at \r\nthe highest level. That will afford us the opportunity \r\nto develop common interests in areas such as trade, \r\ninvestment and culture, all for the benefit of our peoples.\r\nThanks to appropriate macroeconomic policies, \r\nPeru has continued to grow, reaching a growth rate in \r\n2011 of 6.92 per cent and a 5.7 per cent average rate \r\nover the past 10 years. Despite those good results, wide \r\nsectors of the population do not fully participate in the \r\nbenefits of economic growth. Hence, it is time to ensure \r\ngrowth with social inclusion, as President Ollanta \r\nHumala Tasso has pointed out since the beginning of \r\nhis Administration. The new vision that Peru promotes \r\nis oriented towards further economic growth and \r\ndemocratic stability as it expands and maximizes \r\nsocial well-being and harmonizes productive activities \r\nwith environmental preservation. In Peru’s view, \r\nstarting with the Rio+20 Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, the establishment of the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda must achieve a convergence of the \r\nprocesses of the Millennium Development Goals with \r\nthe processes of the sustainable development goals. \r\nPeru’s commitment to the United Nations is \r\nlong-standing and deep. Allow me to conclude by \r\nhonouring here to three prominent Peruvian diplomats \r\nwho have held the highest responsibilities within the \r\nOrganization — Ambassador Javier Pérez de Cuellar, \r\nhave obtained the requisite social licence, within the \r\nframework of State powers.\r\nIn spite of all of those efforts, new and diverse \r\nthreats to the rule of law have emerged. Transnational \r\norganized crime, funded mainly by drug trafficking, \r\ntoday constitutes the main threat to democratic societies. \r\nThe magnitude of this problem requires, more than ever \r\nbefore, combined efforts with an integrated vision of \r\nshared responsibility at the global level.\r\nIt is for that reason that this past June Peru hosted \r\nthe International Conference of Ministers of Foreign \r\nAffairs and Heads of Specialized National Agencies \r\nagainst the World Drug Problem, in an attempt to resume \r\na political dialogue that had been interrupted for nearly \r\n20 years. That valuable opportunity proved to us that \r\namid our diversity there are many more convergences \r\nthan discrepancies, and that the will exists to intensify \r\ncooperation in this area. \r\nWe are confident that this first step will be further \r\ncomplemented by new initiatives that will guarantee \r\ngreater exchange of information, a better allocation \r\nof resources, and better results in reducing the supply \r\nand demand of narcotic drugs as well as in the field of \r\nalternative development, a topic that will be addressed \r\nnext November at an international conference to be \r\nhosted by Peru.\r\nThat Peruvian initiative on the fight against \r\ndrugs is not the only reflection of our commitment \r\nto multilateralism and integration. Since June, Peru \r\nhas held the presidency pro tempore of the Union of \r\nSouth American Nations (UNASUR). We want to see \r\ndemocracy consolidated throughout South America. \r\nMany lives have been lost during the long journey \r\ntowards consolidating democracy in our region. For that \r\nreason, we will not be deterred by any circumstance \r\nthat may threaten that undertaking. \r\nIn our capacity as President Pro Tempore of \r\nUNASUR, we reiterate that democracy will remain an \r\nessential requirement for integration and cooperation \r\nin South America. We also hope that South America \r\nwill become a zone of peace, without exclusions. It \r\nis already a nuclear-weapon-free zone, and we will \r\nwork tirelessly so that it can soon be a zone free of \r\nanti-personnel mines. The money currently spent on \r\narms must be redirected towards development and \r\novercoming poverty and inequality.\r\nPeru is peace-loving country and a staunch defender \r\nof disarmament. At the international level, we are \r\n12-52349 39\r\nA/67/PV.14\r\nis party to all major international instruments banning \r\nthe production and use of weapons of mass destruction, \r\nnamely, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \r\nWeapons (NPT), the Chemical Weapons Convention \r\nand the Biological Weapons Convention, and that is \r\nfully committed to all its relevant legal obligations \r\nunder such treaties; a country that is proud of having \r\nproposed the idea of establishing a nuclear-weapon-free \r\nzone in the Middle East and that continues to strongly \r\nsupport its realization; and a country that has never \r\nbeen involved in terrorist activities but has lost more \r\nthan 17,000 of its citizens, including nuclear scientists, \r\nto martyrdom at the hands of foreign-backed terrorists; \r\na country that has been the main victim of the modern \r\nuse of chemical weapons in nearly 600 attacks, which \r\nresulted in the injury or martyrdom of more than \r\n100,000 Iranian citizens, including more than 7,000 \r\ninjuries among civilians stemming from nearly 30 \r\nattacks on Iranian cities and villages. \r\nLikewise, I do not wish to refer to the totally \r\ndark record of the Israeli regime in ruthlessly killing \r\ninnocent women and children and committing genocide, \r\nwar crimes and crimes against humanity over more \r\nthan six decades. The 33-day war against Lebanon and \r\nthe 22-day barbaric attack on Gaza, together with its \r\ninhuman blockade of the Gaza Strip, are only a few \r\nrecent examples of such atrocities. \r\nNor do I wish to describe the dark history of \r\nterrorist activities committed by the current regime, \r\nwhose roots are in terrorism, and which is the founding \r\nfather of State terrorism as used in the recent history \r\nof war.\r\nWhat I would like to bring to the Assembly’s \r\nattention is only a very small part of the dark history \r\nof this regime, namely, its record of non-compliance \r\nwith the international instrument regulating weapons \r\nof mass destruction (WMD) and its related obligations \r\nunder the United Nations Charter and international \r\nlaw. Not only is the Israeli regime the only non-party \r\nto the NPT in the Middle East, but, despite repeated \r\ncalls from the international community, it has never \r\nintended to become party to it. The worst of it is that \r\nin a statement on 11 December 2006, the then Prime \r\nMinister of the Israeli regime admitted its position \r\non nuclear weapons, which, as has been repeatedly \r\nstated by the 120 States members of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement, “poses a serious and continuing threat to \r\nthe security of their neighbours and other States”.\r\nSecretary-General from 1982 to 1991; Ambassador \r\nVictor Andrés Belaúnde, President of the General \r\nAssembly at its fourteenth session, from 1959 to 1960; \r\nand Ambassador José Luis Bustamante y Rivero, \r\nPresident of the International Court of Justice from \r\n1967 to 1969. The recognition and responsibilities \r\nthat those individuals received from the international \r\ncommunity show that Peru has always been committed \r\nto peace and to the observance of international law. I \r\nam pleased to see the Permanent Representative of Peru \r\npresiding over the debate this evening.\r\nAs a co-founder of some of the main regional \r\nforums, such as the Andean Community, the Union \r\nof South American Nations and the Community of \r\nLatin American and Caribbean States, Peru has always \r\nbeen a standard-bearer for integration and for positive, \r\nrespectful relations with all countries of the world \r\nand, in particular, with the countries of our region and \r\nneighbouring countries. As a basis of that policy, Peru \r\nhas always trusted — and will continue to place its \r\ntrust — in the strength and primacy of international \r\nlaw and in the peaceful settlement of disputes. It is \r\nwith that conviction that the Government of President \r\nOllanta Humala Tasso reiterates its staunch adherence \r\nto the purposes and principles of the United Nations.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I shall \r\nnow call on those representatives who wish to speak in \r\nexercise of the right of reply. May I remind delegations \r\nthat statements in the exercise of the right of reply are \r\nlimited to 10 minutes for the first intervention and to \r\nfive minutes for the second intervention, and should be \r\nmade by delegations from their seats. \r\nMr. Al Habib (Islamic Republic of Iran): Today, \r\nin the Assembly, the Prime Minister of the notorious \r\nIsraeli regime made a series of entirely baseless \r\nallegations against my country. At this late hour, I do \r\nnot wish to take the precious time of my colleagues to \r\nreply to such unfounded statements, which I will not \r\ndignify with an answer other than to categorically reject \r\nthem, in particular regarding the nuclear programme \r\nof my country, which is exclusively peaceful and in \r\nfull conformity with our international obligations and \r\nundertaken in exercise of our inalienable right to use \r\nnuclear science and technology for peaceful purposes. \r\nI also do not wish to take the valuable time of my \r\ncolleagues to explain the very well-known history and \r\nrecord of my country — a country that has no record of \r\naggression in its centuries-long history; a country that \r\n40 12-52349\r\nA/67/PV.14\r\nall this irresponsible behaviour in a volatile region such \r\nas the Middle East.\r\nFinally, for the second time in the recent history of \r\nthe United Nations, today, in the General Assembly, an \r\nunfounded and imaginary graph was used to justify a \r\nthreat against a founding Member of the Organization. \r\nIt is worth mentioning, however, in our increasingly \r\ninterconnected world, and in the information age, it is \r\nhardly possible for nations to be fooled by such absurd \r\ndevices. It is evident that no amount of slanderous \r\ndeception or smear campaigning by the Zionist regime \r\ncan obscure its dark history or divert attention from the \r\nreality.\r\nMr. Kodama (Japan): My delegation would like to \r\nexercise its right of reply in response to the statement \r\nmade by the representative of the People’s Republic of \r\nChina on the issue of the Senkaku Islands.\r\nIn his address in the general debate (A/67/PV.9), \r\nMr. Noda, the Prime Minister of Japan, stressed that \r\nvarious international issues should be solved by reason \r\nrather than force. He has also repeatedly pointed out \r\nthe importance of the rule of law, which is one of the \r\nfoundations of global peace, stability and prosperity, \r\nand that any attempt to achieve a country’s ideological \r\naims or claims by the unilateral use of force or the threat \r\nof force is inconsistent with the fundamental spirit of \r\nthe United Nations Charter.\r\nThe Cabinet of the Government of Japan made a \r\ndecision in January 1895 to formally incorporate the \r\nSenkaku Islands into the territory of Japan, while the \r\nisland of Formosa and the islands appertaining or belong \r\nto it were ceded to Japan in accordance with the Treaty \r\nof Shimonoseki, signed in April 1895. It is therefore \r\nclear at the outset that the assertion that Japan took the \r\nislands from China cannot logically stand. In any case, \r\nJapan had been conducting thorough surveys of the \r\nSenkaku Islands since 1885. Those surveys confirmed \r\nthat the Senkaku Islands were not only uninhabited but \r\nshowed no trace of having been under China’s control. \r\nBased on that information, Japan formally incorporated \r\nthe Senkaku Islands into its territory.\r\nJapan renounced territorial sovereignty over the \r\nisland of Formosa — Taiwan — and the Pescadores, \r\nceded by China after the Sino-Japanese war, in \r\naccordance with article 2 (b) of the San Francisco \r\nPeace Treaty. It was made clear, however, that the \r\nSenkaku Islands were not included with Formosa \r\nand the Pescadores, by the fact that the United States \r\nTaking into account these realities, and the Final \r\nDocument of the 2010 NPT Review Conference \r\n(NPT/CONF.2012/50 (Vol.1)), adopted by consensus, \r\n189 States party to the NPT, including the United \r\nStates and other significant supporters of the Zionist \r\nregime, unanimously appealed to that regime, by name, \r\nto accede to the NPT without conditions, and to put all \r\nits clandestine nuclear activities under international \r\nsafeguards.\r\nNow the Prime Minister of the regime has \r\nshamelessly and hypocritically raised an outcry, \r\nand, by his baseless and absurd allegations about my \r\ncountry’s exclusively peaceful nuclear programmes, \r\ntried to abuse the tribune of the General Assembly to \r\ndistract Member States’ attention from the danger of \r\nits nuclear arsenals, clandestine nuclear programme \r\nand unsafeguarded nuclear facilities, which are the \r\nonly source of threats to peace, security and stability \r\nin the Middle East and beyond. Instead of making \r\nbaseless allegations against other countries in the \r\nregion, this regime must obey the repeated demands of \r\nthe international community and accede promptly and \r\nwithout conditions to the NPT as a non-nuclear-weapon \r\nparty, as well as to place all its nuclear-related facilities \r\nunder the comprehensive International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency verification system.\r\nThe international community should also continue \r\nto exert all possible pressure on this regime, particularly \r\nduring the upcoming 2012 NPT-related Conference on \r\nthe establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the \r\nMiddle East, in order to force it to abide by international \r\ndemands. Similarly, this regime, which is also not a \r\nparty to WMD-related treaties other than the NPT, and \r\nwhich, by developing weapons of mass destruction, \r\ntries to solve its inherent legitimacy problems, must \r\nbe compelled to comply fully with all its international \r\nobligations.\r\nWhile the use or threat of use of force on any \r\npretext is a grave violation of the principles of the \r\nUnited Nations Charter and international law, as well \r\nas the norms of international relations, the officials \r\nof the Israeli regime, who, rude as they are, threaten \r\ncountries in the region, particularly my country, with \r\nmilitary attack on a daily basis. Iran has the strength \r\nto defend itself, and reserves its full right to retaliate \r\nwith full force against any attack. At the same time, \r\nthe international community should live up to its \r\nresponsibilities and exert pressure on this regime to end \r\n12-52349 41\r\nA/67/PV.14\r\ninternational obligations in good faith, one of which \r\nwas to return to China all the territories, including \r\nthe Diaoyu islands, that Japan had stolen. However, \r\ndespite the many years that have gone by, the Japanese \r\nGovernment still clings to its obsolete colonial mindset, \r\nbreaches its international obligations time and again, \r\nand attempts to continue to occupy the Diaoyu islands. \r\nThe recent so-called island purchase by the \r\nGovernment is no different than money laundering. \r\nIts purpose is to legitimize its stealing and occupation \r\nof Chinese territory through illegal means and to \r\nconfuse international public opinion and deceive the \r\npeople of the world. Japan’s action constitutes a serious \r\nencroachment upon China’s sovereignty, with Japan \r\nintending to continue its occupation and legitimize the \r\nfruits of its colonial policy. It is an open denial of the \r\noutcomes of the victory of the world anti-fascist war \r\nand a grave challenge to the post-war international \r\norder and the purposes and principles of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations. \r\nAny illegal act, no matter how it is packaged, is \r\nillegal in nature and never generates rights. That is a \r\nbasic principle of international law. Japan’s act falls \r\ninto that category and is utterly illegal and void. It will \r\nnever change the fact that the Diaoyu islands are part of \r\nChina’s territory, nor will it ever shake China’s resolve \r\nto safeguard its territorial integrity and sovereignty \r\nover the Diaoyu islands and their affiliated islands. \r\nThe Government and the people of China will never \r\nwaver in their will and determination to uphold China’s \r\nterritorial integrity and sovereignty. \r\nChina is capable of safeguarding the integrity of its \r\nterritory. The Chinese Government urges the Japanese \r\nside to put an immediate halt to all acts that undermine \r\nChina’s territorial integrity and sovereignty.\r\nMr. Kodama (Japan): There is no doubt that the \r\nSenkaku islands are an inherent territory of Japan, \r\nbased on historical fact and international law. Indeed, \r\nthe Senkaku islands are clearly under Japan’s legitimate \r\ncontrol. China’s assertions have no grounds at all. In \r\nany case, there exists no territorial sovereignty issue \r\nto be resolved with respect to the Senkaku islands. I \r\nrefrain from entering into any more detailed rebuttal \r\nof the statement made by the delegation of the People’s \r\nRepublic of China. The position of the Government of \r\nJapan on the issue is as stated previously.\r\nMr. Li Baodong (China) (spoke in Chinese): China \r\nfirmly opposes the statement made by the Japanese \r\nof America actually exercised administrative rights \r\nover the Senkaku Islands, as part of the Nansei Shoto \r\nsouthwest islands, in accordance with article 3 of the \r\nPeace Treaty, and the islands were explicitly included \r\nin the areas whose administrative rights reverted to \r\nJapan in 1972.\r\nIt was only in the 1970s that the Government of \r\nChina and the Taiwanese authorities began making \r\ntheir own assertions of territorial sovereignty over the \r\nSenkaku Islands, which are part of Japan’s inherent \r\nterritory. Until then they had never expressed any \r\nobjections to Japan, nor did they protest the fact that the \r\nislands were included in the area over which the United \r\nStates exercised administrative rights in accordance \r\nwith article 3 of the San Francisco Peace Treaty. The \r\nposture of simply attributing this difference of opinion \r\nbetween the two countries to the past war is not just \r\nunconvincing and unproductive; it is also a way to \r\nevade the essence of the issue.\r\nMr. Li Baodong (China) (spoke in Chinese): \r\nOn the question of the Diaoyu islands, the Japanese \r\nrepresentative once again brazenly distorted history and \r\nresorted to spurious, fallacious arguments that defy all \r\nreason and logic to justify their aggression of Chinese \r\nterritory. Minister for Foreign Affairs Mr. Yang Jiechi \r\nreiterated China’s firm position on the Diaoyu Dao issue \r\nin the statement he made to the General Assembly. That \r\nposition is consistent and clear-cut. \r\nThe Diaoyu islands and their affiliated islands \r\nhave been an integral part of China’s territory since \r\nancient times, and China has indisputable historical \r\nand jurisprudential evidence to support that claim. \r\nJapan waged an expansionist war of aggression against \r\nChina at the end of the nineteenth century. In the same \r\nway that other colonial countries grabbed and occupied \r\nthe land of many countries in Asia, Africa and Latin \r\nAmerica, Japan stole Taiwan and its affiliated islands, \r\nincluding the Diaoyu islands, from China through that \r\nwar and began its colonial rule over them. \r\nDuring the Second World War, China, the United \r\nStates and the United Kingdom issued the Cairo \r\nDeclaration, which clearly stipulated that one of the \r\npurposes of the three countries in fighting that war \r\nwas to make sure that all the territories that Japan had \r\nstolen from the Chinese would be restored to China. \r\nThe Potsdam Declaration and the Japanese Instrument \r\nof Surrender issued in 1945 further confirmed that \r\nJapan, as a defeated country, would have to honour its \r\n42 12-52349\r\nA/67/PV.14\r\nThe Japanese act is a rejection of international \r\nefforts to end colonialism, an outright denial of the \r\nvictorious defeat of Japan in the world anti-fascist war \r\nand a grave challenge to the post-war international \r\norder and international law. China is firmly opposed \r\nto that position. China will continue to take resolute \r\nand forceful measures to unswervingly safeguard \r\nChinese territorial integrity and sovereignty. The \r\ncurrent situation has been caused by the Japanese side \r\nsinglehandedly. Japan must respect history, face reality, \r\ndiscard illusions, refrain from daydreaming, honour its \r\ninternational obligations, take concrete measures to \r\nredress its mistakes and stop all acts that violate and \r\nundermine China’s sovereignty.\r\nThe meeting rose at 11.20 p.m.\r\nrepresentative, who not only feels no guilt for Japan’s \r\nhistory of aggression and colonialism, but instead \r\nmakes remarks that do not hold water at all. China is \r\nstrongly opposed to such a position. \r\nJapan’s so-called nationalization of the Diaoyu \r\nislands is based purely on the logic of thieves. At the \r\nend of the nineteenth century, Japan stole large chunks \r\nof territory from China, including the Diaoyu islands, \r\nthrough a colonial war of aggression. We are now in the \r\ntwenty-first century, but Japan continues to hold on to \r\nits obsolete colonial mentality in an attempt to exercise \r\nlong-term occupation of islands that it stole from China. \r\nThe entire 1.3 billion Chinese people have expressed \r\nstrong indignation against that state of affairs and will \r\nfirmly fight against such practices. \r\n"
