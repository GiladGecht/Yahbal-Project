The world is \r\nbecoming more interconnected, which strengthens \r\neconomic opportunities and accelerates development. \r\nAdvances in science and technology are bringing \r\nmeasurable progress for humankind. The profound \r\ntransformations in North Africa have raised the hopes \r\nof people for real democracy and freedom. \r\nHowever, there is also much that is disturbing. \r\nConflicts in many parts of the world are wreaking \r\nhavoc on innocent civilians. Our planet is experiencing \r\ngrowing environmental damage. The global financial \r\nand economic crisis is still negatively affecting the \r\nmajority of countries in both the developing and the \r\ndeveloped world. International peace and security \r\nare under strain from terrorism, extremism, poverty, \r\ninequality, human rights abuses and persecution.\r\nIn confronting such challenges, Croatia acts in the \r\nglobal arena on the basis of two fundamental tenets. \r\nWe stand ready to assume our responsibility towards \r\nour own citizens and our neighbours in the region \r\nand to be a constructive actor in Europe and a reliable \r\npartner to all peace-loving countries in the world. We \r\nactively promote solidarity with vulnerable groups \r\nand communities and with the poor, the needy, the \r\ndefenceless and the underprivileged. Responsibility \r\nand solidarity are two central principles of our \r\nengagement in the United Nations in the pursuit of \r\npeace and security and in advancing freedom and \r\ndemocracy, protecting human rights, enhancing \r\nsustainable development, respecting international law, \r\nensuring equality and social justice and promoting the \r\nrule of law.\r\nThis year, Croatia marks the twentieth anniversary \r\nof its membership of our global Organization. We are \r\ngrateful to the United Nations for playing an important \r\nrole in our country’s struggle for political independence, \r\ninternational recognition and full territorial integrity. \r\nWe have great expectations of the United Nations. \r\nAs a beacon of multilateralism, it provides the only \r\nUnited Nations A/67/PV.16\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-seventh session\r\n16th plenary meeting\r\nFriday, 28 September 2012, 3 p.m.\r\nNew York\r\nOffi cial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Jeremić . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Serbia)\r\n2 12-52402\r\nA/67/PV.16\r\nuniversal framework for finding common solutions to \r\ninternational crises and current challenges. However, \r\nwe must ask ourselves whether the United Nations does \r\nenough and what we can do collectively to improve its \r\nperformance.\r\nWe support the United Nations reform process, \r\nwhich seeks to enhance its accountability, efficiency, \r\neffectiveness and transparency. United, we are stronger \r\nthan alone. But let me stress something. If each of our \r\ncountries becomes more democratic, more developed, \r\nbetter run, more stable and more responsible, our \r\ncombined strength will rise exponentially.\r\nThe topic of the general debate, namely, resolving \r\ninternational disputes by peaceful means, is at the very \r\nheart of the United Nations. The Organization was built \r\nto prevent war and to keep the peace. We highly value \r\nthe instruments of preventive diplomacy and mediation \r\nand other peaceful means of resolving disputes. In \r\nparticular, we see merit in resorting to the International \r\nCourt of Justice, the Permanent Court of Arbitration \r\nand other existing institutions. We ourselves have \r\ndone so. We agreed to settle the border issue with our \r\nneighbour, Slovenia, through arbitration. \r\nHowever, we must understand that, in the long run, \r\npeace cannot be imposed on parties to a dispute. Each \r\nsituation has its own pace and dynamics. However, \r\nthere should be no excuse for a lack of genuine effort. \r\nMoreover, without a thorough resolution of issues, \r\nthere can be no room for a true reconciliation process \r\nto take place. In that vein, it is reassuring to note that \r\nsupport for the peaceful resolution of disputes comes \r\nfrom many parts of the world, including countries that \r\nhave opted to use military means to settle disputes with \r\ntheir immediate neighbours in the recent past.\r\nNot everyone, however, shares equal respect \r\nfor peace and international law. This year has been \r\nparticularly unfortunate in terms of the efficiency of \r\nthe United Nations in the area of conflict prevention, \r\nmediation and the protection of civilians. We have \r\nwitnessed appalling events, and thousands of civilian \r\nvictims have been exposed to heavy arms and the \r\nbrutality of armed forces and paramilitary groups. \r\nThe lack of univocal action against the most severe \r\nviolations of the United Nations Charter is deeply \r\ntroubling. We must resolutely counter such an obsession \r\nwith violence and repression. We should not shy away \r\nfrom our responsibilities. \r\nAt this juncture, I must strongly condemn the recent \r\nkilling of the United States Ambassador to Libya. People \r\ncome from different cultures, legal traditions, historical \r\nbackgrounds and forms of Government. Violence can \r\nnever be an acceptable response to freedom of speech.\r\nLike many previous speakers, I stress the \r\nimportance of keeping strong international attention \r\non Syria. We align ourselves with the position of the \r\nEuropean Union on the situation in Syria. We see the \r\nneed for prompt action on two fronts. The immediate \r\npriority is to stop the loss of life on both sides in the \r\nconflict, to provide humanitarian aid and assistance to \r\nthe Syrian people and to support plans for the country’s \r\neconomic and political stabilization. Further fighting \r\nand militarization will only exacerbate the suffering and \r\nmake a peaceful resolution of the crisis more difficult. \r\nIn addition, we have to remain committed to pursuing \r\na Syrian-led political transition that will meet the \r\ndemocratic aspirations of the Syrian people. Resolving \r\nthe crisis is our common responsibility. We therefore \r\ncall unceasingly for the full respect of international \r\nlaw, especially international humanitarian law, human \r\nrights and refugee law. \r\nThere is no peace without justice and there is no \r\njustice without the rule of law and without the fight \r\nagainst impunity. We support concepts of human \r\nsecurity and the responsibility to protect, as well as \r\ntheir implementation and improvement through an \r\nopen and constructive dialogue within the framework \r\nof the United Nations. We also support the work of \r\nthe International Criminal Court. Undoubtedly, there \r\nare sufficient conflict prevention tools at our disposal. \r\nThe question remains whether we can muster enough \r\nresolve to use them.\r\nSyria is the most recent and most striking example \r\nof the need for a greater role for preventive diplomacy \r\nand mediation in the early phases of a conflict. The later \r\nwe engage, the more divided we are. Timely prevention \r\nis crucial for successful conflict resolution. Prevention \r\nis also indispensable for countering other threats that \r\ndestabilize countries and societies. Let me cite an \r\nexample. If a country is forced to fight corruption \r\nthrough its law enforcement bodies and the judiciary, \r\nthat is usually a sign that it is too late, that corruption has \r\nalready left its corrosive imprint on society. Our goal is \r\nto invest efforts aimed at building a society in which \r\ncorruption is not an endemic phenomenon, in which \r\nelected officials in Government structures demonstrate \r\nresponsibility towards their public office. That in turn \r\n12-52402 3\r\nA/67/PV.16\r\nof human rights at the universal level remains one of \r\nthe cornerstones of the role of the United Nations in \r\nthe world. Further development of the capacity of the \r\nHuman Rights Council is of the utmost importance \r\nif we are to address seriously and efficiently urgent \r\nhuman rights situations and crises. \r\nWe give special attention to continually improving \r\nthe degree of respect accorded the fundamental human \r\nrights of women and girls in different post-conflict \r\nsocieties. Women and children do not have armies to \r\nprotect them or trade unions to negotiate on their behalf. \r\nYet, more and more women are becoming the primary \r\nbreadwinners in their families. The empowerment of \r\nwomen and their full and equal participation in societies \r\nare prerequisites for security, economic opportunity, \r\neffective governance and social development. Croatia \r\nwill also continue with its active contribution to the \r\nwork of the United Nations human rights forums, \r\nin particular safeguarding the rights of vulnerable \r\nmembers of society, such as lesbian, bisexual, gay and \r\ntransgendered persons, promoting the moratorium \r\non the use of death penalty and ensuring the right to \r\nconscientious objection to military service.\r\nIn times of economic uncertainty, be it due to \r\nfinancial crisis or long-term poverty, some tend \r\nto downplay the importance of human rights or of \r\nconsolidating democracy. Every day we witness the sad \r\nrealities of starving children, deaths from preventable \r\ncommunicable diseases, inadequate education and \r\nhealth systems, and the continuous degradation of the \r\necosystem. Challenges we are facing require integrated \r\nsolutions across interconnected issues and the \r\nfurther strengthening of the multilateral architecture. \r\nWe welcome the outcome of the United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development and encourage \r\nits follow-up process. We look forward to more \r\nenergetic work on the implementation of sustainable \r\ndevelopment goals, which should complement existing \r\ncommitments and encompass all three dimensions \r\nof sustainable development — economic, social and \r\nenvironmental — in a balanced and synergistic way. \r\nCroatia sees the Economic and Social Council and its \r\nsubsidiary bodies as a cornerstone for the achievement \r\nof balanced integration of sustainable development. \r\nCroatia is firmly devoted to participation in those \r\nprocesses, in particular in the fields of education and \r\ngender equality. Education is a sector which builds \r\na firm foundation for responding to the challenges \r\nof pursuing a post-2015 development framework. \r\nencourages citizens to foster a corruption-free culture \r\nthrough their daily behaviour. When leaders lead by \r\npositive example, people tend to follow. That is because \r\nculture f lows from structure. That is also the reason \r\nwhy, at the level of the United Nations, we provide our \r\nfull support to the implementation, wider acceptance \r\nand universalization of international legal instruments \r\non non-proliferation, arms control and disarmament, \r\ncountering terrorism and preventing corruption. \r\nThe global economic crisis combined with the \r\neffects of globalization has contributed to the rise \r\nof popular distrust in the capability of political \r\nleaders to deliver needed solutions. That calls for \r\ngreater responsibility, better governance and stronger \r\ncooperation among States, civil society and the private \r\nsector. The Croatian Government has made notable \r\nprogress in making its work more transparent and \r\nmore available to its citizens. As a member of the \r\nOpen Government Partnership initiative, we have \r\nbecome active in the fields of fiscal transparency, \r\naccess to information, information technology and \r\ncivil society participation. We are pleased to host the \r\nSecond European Outreach and Support Meeting of the \r\nInitiative on 4 and 5 October in Dubrovnik, where we \r\nexpect to see the sharing of best practices and further \r\npromotion of cooperation between Governments and \r\ncivil society organizations.\r\nCroatia has undergone an extensive but successful \r\npolitical, economic and social transition in a fairly \r\nshort period of time. For that reason, we have a \r\nspecial understanding and first-hand experience of the \r\ninterwoven nature of peace, security, development and \r\nthe promotion and protection of human rights. Today \r\nwe are sharing our knowledge and experiences with \r\ncountries in the region of South-Eastern Europe and with \r\ncountries emerging from crises, where our post-conflict \r\nunderstanding in nation- and institution-building is \r\nparticularly relevant. \r\nCroatia is currently a Vice-Chair of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission. My country stands ready \r\nto assume its responsibility for creating more relevant, \r\nbetter-performing and more empowered peacebuilding \r\nstructures. Croatia has already joined the Civilian \r\nCapacity Project’s CAPMATCH initiative designed to \r\naddress the State-building needs of fragile and conflict-\r\naffected countries by offering our help in various fields \r\nof expertise gained through our own political transition, \r\npost-conflict rehabilitation and unique European \r\nUnion accession process. Promotion and protection \r\n4 12-52402\r\nA/67/PV.16\r\nTherefore, Croatia salutes the launching of the \r\nSecretary-General’s Education First initiative and is \r\npleased that the Croatian President has been invited to \r\njoin the steering group known as the Group of Member \r\nState Champions.\r\nI have already mentioned Croatia’s successful post-\r\nconflict transition. In addition to having joined NATO \r\nsince 2009, Croatia will become the twenty-eighth \r\nmember of the European Union (EU) next year. Our \r\ninternational engagement is visible and strong. Croatia \r\nhas been an active participant in United Nations \r\npeacekeeping missions, and I praise our women and \r\nmen who have risked their lives for the common good. \r\nWe have been providing substantial contributions \r\nto international efforts to stabilize Afghanistan and \r\nimprove the living conditions of its people, highlighting \r\nthe need for the protection of human rights, in particular \r\nthe rights of women and children. Croatia is also actively \r\nparticipating in EU meetings at a time when the Union \r\nis intensively trying to find ways of overcoming the \r\ncrisis and assuming its rightful place in the world.\r\nLet me emphasize that Croatia greatly appreciates \r\nthe role that the EU has been playing in the United \r\nNations as a significant and positive force behind a \r\nnumber of initiatives. At the same time, for Croatia, \r\nthe process of EU accession was primarily an exercise \r\nin institution-building and State transition. We built a \r\nstronger State so we can play a more substantive role in \r\nworld affairs. \r\nThe perspective of EU membership has proved \r\nto be the main motivator and catalyst for social and \r\npolitical reforms. We want our neighbours in South-\r\nEastern Europe to undertake the same demanding \r\nbut rewarding road. We do not intend to assume a \r\nmentoring role in the region, but we stand ready to share \r\nour experiences and contribute constructively to the \r\nreforms in neighbouring countries based on democracy \r\nand European values. \r\nA peaceful and prosperous South-Eastern Europe \r\nis in Croatia’s strategic interest. Our vision is not just \r\na region devoid of war. We strive to achieve genuine \r\npolitical, societal and economic development. We want \r\npeople, especially young women and men, to have \r\nbetter standards of living and better prospects, to live \r\nin a clean environment and in a well-organized State \r\nwith fully functioning institutions, to speak less about \r\nwhat was and much more about what could be.\r\nThat reminds me of a quotation by Croatian public \r\nhealth expert Dr. Andrija Štampar, a man who founded \r\nthe World Health Organization decades ago, who once \r\nsaid that, “All people, regardless of whether they are \r\nrich or poor, have the right to be healthy!” I agree. Only \r\nhealthy and self-confident people can shape a healthy \r\nand progressive society. It is our primary responsibility, \r\nindividual and collective, to build such a world and \r\nbequeath it to our children.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Croatia for the statement he has just made. \r\nMr. Zoran Milanović, Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof Croatia, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Patrice Emery Trovoada, Prime \r\nMinister of the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome \r\nand Principe\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Democratic \r\nRepublic of Sao Tome and Principe.\r\nMr. Patrice Emery Trovoada, Prime Minister of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe, \r\nwas escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure \r\nin welcoming His Excellency Mr. Patrice Emery \r\nTrovoada, Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic \r\nof Sao Tome and Principe, and inviting him to address \r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nMr. Trovoada (Sao Tome and Principe) (spoke in \r\nPortuguese; English text provided by the delegation): \r\nFirst of all, on behalf of the Government of Sao Tome \r\nand Principe, and in my own name, I would like to \r\ncongratulate Vuk Jeremić on his election as President \r\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. \r\nI am convinced that his experience as Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Serbia will be a most \r\npositive contribution to strengthening the affirmation \r\nof the principles of the United Nations Charter for \r\nworld security and peace, and I trust that he will lead \r\nthe work of this session with clarity and balance.\r\nThe Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe \r\nalso wishes to express its great appreciation for the \r\nwork of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and for his \r\nrole in expanding our Organization and encouraging \r\nit to continue its efforts to achieve the objectives of \r\nworld peace and security. I would also like to take this \r\n12-52402 5\r\nA/67/PV.16\r\nopportunity to thank Ambassador Nassir Abdulaziz \r\nAl-Nasser for his highly positive contribution during \r\nthe sixty-sixth session.\r\nAs it did during the debates of the sixty-sixth \r\nsession of the General Assembly, the Democratic \r\nRepublic of Sao Tome and Principe reiterates its \r\nhope that the United Nations will play a key role in \r\nmediating international conflicts. Unfortunately, today \r\nwe continue to look on with concern as conflicts that \r\ncould jeopardize international peace and security \r\npersist and further exacerbate the deep economic and \r\nfinancial crisis that is devastating the world. Sadly, \r\nour Organization continues to suffer from roadblocks \r\nthat prevent urgent decisions from being taken and \r\nthat undermine this forum’s credibility. That inaction \r\ntranslates into impunity for leaders who martyrize their \r\nown peoples, paving the way for more international \r\ndisorder, despair and the sentiment of injustice that is \r\nexperienced when peoples receive unequal treatment.\r\nWe need no further evidence of the urgency for \r\nin-depth reforms of our Organization, primarily the \r\nSecurity Council, than our inability to put an end to \r\nthe horrific images of children, symbols of purity and \r\ninnocence, who are killed daily in Syria, to prevent the \r\ndestruction of the world’s historic and cultural heritage, \r\nas by gangs of destructive criminals in Mali and in \r\nAfghanistan, and to forestall coups d’état or obvious \r\nattempts to destabilize States and democratically elected \r\nGovernments that in fact solve nothing and irreparably \r\ndelay the lengthy process of building democracy and \r\nfighting poverty.\r\nWe must prevent the disintegration of territories \r\nand remedy the abnormal and degrading situations \r\nof peoples who have already suffered from the \r\npoverty and exclusion created by a lack of democratic \r\nleadership or of effective and democratic rule of law. \r\nIn the specific case of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, \r\nwith which Sao Tome and Principe maintains deeply \r\nrooted historic, cultural and linguistic links, the \r\ninternational community should bring both firmness \r\nand persistence to bear in finding a credible, inclusive \r\nand lasting solution that will ensure that coups d’état \r\ndo not recur in that country. To do so necessarily \r\nrequires a reform of the armed forces as well as a \r\nstrong warning to the political class as a whole to make \r\na steadfast commitment to respect political dialogue \r\nand democratic legality. On our side, we will continue \r\nto make efforts, in cooperation with the Community \r\nof Portuguese-speaking Countries and other engaged \r\nregional and international organizations, to guarantee a \r\nbetter future for the people of Guinea-Bissau.\r\nRegarding the occupation of the north of the \r\nRepublic of Mali by groups of terrorists and the persistent \r\nconflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sao \r\nTome and Príncipe acknowledges and applauds the \r\nefforts the international community has made through \r\nthe United Nations and the African Union to establish \r\npeace, security and stability. However, it seems that it is \r\nbecoming increasingly essential for us to ask the States \r\nthat share borders with those two African countries to \r\nestablish more effective, intelligent and effective ways \r\nto cooperate, based on trust and on a matrix of mutually \r\nbeneficial and realistic economic interests.\r\nIt is common knowledge that the forces of \r\ndestabilization, despair and terror are fuelled and \r\nfurthered by differences and distrust between \r\nStates, which in turn paralyses the international \r\ndecision-making process. However, we must point out \r\npositive signs in the trends of a few conflicts on the \r\nAfrican continent, such as the cases of the Republics of \r\nthe Sudan, South Sudan and Somalia. Consequently, we \r\ncannot fail to applaud the recent agreement signed by the \r\nRepublic of the Sudan and South Sudan. Through that \r\nframework, the two countries will be able to live in peace \r\nand harmony. We also welcome the positive role of the \r\nAfrican Union Mission in Somalia, which paves the way \r\nto returning the political, economic and social situation \r\nof that country and the region to normalcy. Moreover, \r\nin our opinion, the important recommendations of the \r\nSecretary-General’s report on the situation concerning \r\nthe Western Sahara (S/2012/197) are a positive asset for \r\na permanent resolution. \r\nThe social movements that took place in North \r\nAfrica in 2011, which had the merit of reinstating \r\nthe right to freedom and democracy for the different \r\npeoples, were popular movements that in many cases \r\nwere mobilized through social networking and modern \r\ninstruments of technical communication. Various \r\nsituations of insecurity and reprehensible acts, as well \r\nas the acts recently committed in Benghazi of which \r\nAmerican diplomats were the victims, raise the issue of \r\nhow we may live in this new context of the circulation \r\nand dissemination of images and information at the \r\nglobal level, in a world that we want to be free, open \r\nand tolerant, but in which large segments of the world \r\npopulation still live in a state of extreme poverty, with \r\nno access to education and with the growing conviction \r\nthat they face exclusion and discrimination.\r\n6 12-52402\r\nA/67/PV.16\r\nHow do we deal with the offences committed \r\nby people, including even some persons with public \r\npolitical responsibilities such as State leaders, who \r\nfail to recognize the right of other peoples and States \r\nto exist? In that regard, we would like to take the \r\nopportunity that this platform affords us to express \r\nto the mourning families of diplomats, journalists, \r\nmembers of non-governmental organization and \r\npeacekeepers our sincere and deep condolences as well \r\nas our unfailing solidarity. Our ongoing obligation to \r\nwork to build a better world and to invest in education \r\nand the promotion of human and democratic values is \r\nfundamental, beginning with Member States complying \r\nwith all United Nations resolutions.\r\nThe massacres in Syria must cease, the integrity \r\nand security of the State of Israel must be effectively \r\nguaranteed, the Palestinian people must have their \r\nown State, the embargo against Cuba must end, \r\ncountries, including Iran, must have the right to civil \r\nnuclear technology and must scrupulously observe the \r\ncommitments that that entails, and polluters must be \r\nthe principal payers. It must be our ambition, and not \r\na mere hope, to ensure that we return here next year \r\nwith an agenda that includes fewer of these troublesome \r\nissues, many of which are recurring.\r\nWe are pleased to note a few positive signs in the \r\ndialogue between the Republic of China on Taiwan \r\nand the People’s Republic of China on the one hand, \r\nand, on the other, the willingness of the United States \r\nCongress and the European Parliament to admit Taiwan \r\nas a member of international organizations. Sao Tome \r\nand Principe supports initiatives such as these, which \r\nwill make it possible for the people of Taiwan to make a \r\nsignificant contribution to international issues without \r\nignoring the necessity for the two parties in the Straits \r\nof Formosa to work peacefully to agree to frame and \r\nnormalize their relations.\r\nThe High-level Meeting that preceded the general \r\ndebate was an excellent opportunity for Member States \r\nto share information on how democratic reforms are \r\nbeing implemented and the rule of law strengthened \r\nboth in individual countries and at the international \r\nlevel. It is very pleasing that this discussion is leading \r\nto significant progress in implementing the democratic \r\nand institutional reforms that can help to strengthen the \r\nrule of law, internally and internationally. In that regard, \r\nSao Tome and Principe congratulates the Republic \r\nof Angola on its recent successful and transparent \r\ngeneral elections, since they also constitute another \r\nstep towards strengthening the democratic process in \r\nits sister country of Sao Tome and Principe.\r\nThreats to our global security, particularly \r\ntransnational crimes such as piracy and the trafficking \r\nand sale of arms and drugs, are a matter of great concern \r\nfor Sao Tome and Principe, a country with a long \r\ncoastline located in the Gulf of Guinea. Such events \r\nare threats that we cannot ignore; they demand that we \r\ncooperate as closely as possible both with the States \r\nwe share the coastline with and the other partners and \r\norganizations that have experience in dealing with such \r\nissues, and adopt mechanisms — which we resolve to \r\nstrengthen — for preventing, managing and resolving \r\nconflicts caused by organized crime in order to improve \r\nour collective security.\r\nIn that context, we applaud the important resolutions \r\n2018 (2011) and 2039 (2012) adopted by the Security \r\nCouncil on maritime safety and security in the Gulf \r\nof Guinea. As part of the Gulf of Guinea region, we \r\nrepeat our firm pledge to do everything we can, jointly \r\nwith our partners, to prevent that region, rich as it is in \r\nraw materials of strategic importance to industrialized \r\neconomies, from becoming a stage for maritime piracy \r\nand other scourges that hinder economic trade, peace \r\nand security in the region. To that end, we reiterate that \r\nwe are absolutely ready and willing to help implement \r\ninitiatives to hold an international summit on maritime \r\npiracy in the Gulf of Guinea.\r\nThe substantial transformations that have occurred \r\nin the international political arena as a result of the grave \r\nglobal financial crisis have forced the citizens of small \r\nStates, and of Sao Tome and Principe in particular, to \r\nmake major sacrifices. In that regard, Sao Tome and \r\nPrincipe believes that the continuing international \r\nand economic financial crisis and its effects on the \r\neconomies of small countries, which have included \r\nreductions and slowdowns in official international aid, \r\ntend to threaten social cohesion as well as previous \r\nimprovements in fiscal discipline, the business climate \r\nand political stability itself. The acceptability of \r\ncontrolling and reducing public deficits in developing \r\ncountries such as ours is reaching its limits where \r\nour citizens are concerned, and good governance now \r\ndemands measures that can effectively jump-start our \r\neconomies through productive investments.\r\nWe believe that the most vulnerable populations, \r\nin both the northern and southern hemispheres of our \r\nplanet, are demanding changes in the practices and \r\n12-52402 7\r\nA/67/PV.16\r\nrules of the international financial system, and new \r\nworld financial governance that is better able to hold \r\naccountable the financial stakeholders and speculators \r\nwho undermine the efforts of Governments and their \r\npeoples to develop economies that bring progress.\r\nInternally, the Government of the Democratic \r\nRepublic of Sao Tome and Principe is making efforts \r\nto reduce poverty and increase transparency in public \r\nmanagement and economic growth. Institutional \r\nreforms in the areas of public finance, justice and \r\nnational defence, whose purpose is to strengthen the \r\ncapacities of our democratic institutions and develop \r\nthe country, have been progressing at a good pace. \r\nRegarding the Millennium Development Goals, for \r\nwhich the United Nations has set a deadline of 2015, \r\nthe Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe can \r\nreport significant progress, particularly in the areas \r\nof education, with a literacy rate of 92 per cent of the \r\npopulation, and health, especially in the fight against \r\nmalaria. However, we realize that meeting the deadline \r\nwill require further effort.\r\nTo achieve those goals, our country hopes to \r\ncontinue to receive support in many forms from the \r\ninternational community. In that regard, I would like \r\nto take this opportunity to extend the sincere thanks of \r\nthe Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe to \r\nthe entire international community, and in particular \r\nUNESCO and all of its member States, for designating \r\nthe island of Principe a UNESCO World Biosphere \r\nReserve, thus recognizing and providing further \r\nincentives for our efforts to defend and preserve the \r\nenvironment.\r\nI would like to conclude by repeating that the \r\nGovernment of Sao Tome and Principe, which I have \r\nthe honour of representing, stands ready and willing to \r\ntake part in efforts to mobilize the will and synergy \r\nneeded to achieve the honourable goals that guided the \r\ncreation of the United Nations.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe for the \r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Patrice Emery Trovoada, Prime Minister of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe, \r\nwas escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Hailemariam Desalegn, Prime \r\nMinister of the Federal Democratic Republic \r\nof Ethiopia\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Federal \r\nDemocratic Republic of Ethiopia.\r\nMr. Hailemariam Desalegn, Prime Minister of the \r\nFederal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Hailemariam Desalegn, \r\nPrime Minister of the Federal Democratic Republic of \r\nEthiopia, and inviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Desalegn (Ethiopia): I would like to \r\ncongratulate the President on his election to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh \r\nsession, and to thank him for the inspiring speech he \r\nmade at the opening of the general debate (see A/67/\r\nPV.6). We are confident that the spirit exemplified in \r\nthat speech will guide him during his presidency. Let me \r\nalso take this opportunity to express my appreciation to \r\nthe outgoing President.\r\nThe reason I am here on this rostrum, making my \r\nmaiden speech to the General Assembly as Head of \r\nGovernment of the new Ethiopia, is because we lost our \r\nleader only a little more than a month ago. The passing \r\nof Prime Minister Meles Zenawi is a huge loss for \r\nEthiopia, and undoubtedly for Africa as well. He was a \r\nman of prodigious intellect who was uncompromising \r\nin his insistence that Ethiopians and Africans should \r\nown and protect their development strategies and their \r\napproaches to governance and democratization. The late \r\nEthiopian Prime Minister, and the party he led, have \r\nfacilitated the emergence of a new Ethiopia, rekindling \r\nthe hopes of Ethiopians for the future and strengthening \r\ntheir confidence in their ability to overcome adversity.\r\nEthiopians proved their mettle, and what they are \r\nmade of, when they received the unexpected news of \r\nthe tragedy with which the nation was faced. It is an \r\nhonour and a blessing to be the leader of a people who \r\nare generous in paying tribute to those, like Prime \r\nMinister Meles, who served them self lessly; a people \r\nwho have the maturity and wisdom to see, and even \r\nlucidly articulate, who has done what for the nation \r\nand for the people of Ethiopia. That would naturally \r\nmake any human being who is given the opportunity to \r\nlead a country ask himself what more he can do for his \r\n8 12-52402\r\nA/67/PV.16\r\nof the woods. We salute all those, most particularly the \r\ncontributors of troops to the African Union Mission in \r\nSomalia, for the sacrifice they have made. The African \r\nUnion (AU) has made an enormous contribution to \r\nlaying the basis for the progress that Somalia has made. \r\nWe also acknowledge the very useful cooperation \r\nbetween the AU and the United Nations, including \r\ntheir two Councils responsible for security. We have to \r\nrecognize the role of partners as well. But much more \r\nneeds to be done in Somalia to ensure that the new \r\nGovernment stands on its own feet. We would be naive, \r\nhowever, if we believed that the enemies of peace of \r\nSomalia and the region are completely defeated. That \r\nis why it is so critical that the momentum is not lost \r\nin Somalia and Somalia’s ownership of the process \r\nof national reconciliation is strengthened. We will \r\ncontinue to assist Somalia and the new President of the \r\ncountry, Mr. Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, and the people \r\nof Somalia can count on that.\r\nWe are pleased that there is also major progress in \r\nthe peace process between the Sudan and South Sudan. \r\nWe are confident that the two parties will maintain the \r\nmomentum towards durable peace, which is the basis for \r\nensuring the viability of both. We are indeed indebted \r\nto former President Thabo Mbeki and the African \r\nUnion High-level Implementation Panel for their \r\nperseverance and commitment to peace between the \r\ntwo sisterly countries. What has been achieved by the \r\ntwo parties over the last few days, which culminated in \r\nthe signing of the much anticipated agreements on vital \r\nmatters, is a significant breakthrough, which needs to \r\nbe consolidated and used as a basis for resolving the \r\nissues still remaining. We are confident that the two \r\nparties appreciate how vital their joint effort for a \r\nwin-win outcome is, not only for their peoples, but also \r\nfor us all. \r\nPeace between the Sudan and South Sudan and a \r\nclose partnership between the two, above and beyond \r\nthe benefit it has for us all, has for us Ethiopians an \r\nadditional emotional and sentimental value. That was \r\nan issue that our late Prime Minister, even as he was \r\nstruggling for his life, was following with the same \r\nintensity as before, and he continued to offer whatever \r\nadded value he could bring to bear on the peace \r\nprocess. Let me thank both the Sudan and South Sudan \r\nfor placing their trust in us, as has been so manifest in \r\nthe deployment of the United Nations Interim Security \r\nForce for Abyei. Indeed, we are proud of our troops in \r\npeople — not in words but in deeds, as our late Prime \r\nMinister often emphasized. As might be expected, \r\ndoomsday scenarios for Ethiopia’s future were bandied \r\nabout.\r\nBut the people of Ethiopia — from north to south, \r\nfrom east to west, across the length and breadth of \r\nthe country — were categorical in stating in unison \r\nhow much they embrace the unity of the country, \r\nunity that celebrates their diversity and is built on the \r\nbedrock of their federal Constitution. Let me take this \r\nopportunity to thank, on behalf of the Ethiopian people \r\nand myself, all those leaders and heads of delegation \r\nwho came to Addis Ababa to be with us at our time of \r\ngrief. We cherish your friendship. I wish to reiterate my \r\ncondolences to the peoples and Governments of Ghana, \r\nMalawi and Guinea-Bissau, who have also lost their \r\nleaders recently.\r\nWe Ethiopians are confident that we have come \r\na long way. Never before in its modern history has \r\nEthiopia had the kind of rapid economic growth that \r\nit has witnessed over the last decade or so. Indeed, for \r\nthe first time in its modern history, Ethiopia has begun \r\nto see a bright light at the end of the tunnel in terms of \r\nreal prospects for economic transformation. We are, for \r\nsure, on a hugely promising trajectory. Our Growth and \r\nTransformation Plan, to which our late Prime Minister \r\nwas devoted, and which is now embraced by our people, \r\nis designed to catapult our nation to a destination \r\nthathas long eluded it but is now within reach.\r\nWe go forward with full recognition of our \r\nresponsibility, as the second most populous country \r\nin Africa, to contribute to regional integration. We \r\nforesee huge possibilities for bringing the countries of \r\nthe greater Horn of Africa together. We have already \r\ngone some distance in playing a catalytic role in laying \r\nthe infrastructural basis for consolidating economic \r\nties with the countries of our region. The electric power \r\ninterconnections and the road and railway networks \r\nthat we have built and are in the process of building \r\nwith Djibouti, the Sudan, Kenya and South Sudan are \r\nemblematic of our resolve to play our part in regional \r\nintegration. We are confident that Somalia and others, \r\nwithout exception, will follow suit.\r\nBut our success hinges on a number of conditions \r\nbeing met, none of which is amenable to our unilateral \r\ninitiative. First is the question of peace and stability \r\nand the challenge of extremism. Here, also, we have \r\nmade much progress. Somalia is gradually coming out \r\n12-52402 9\r\nA/67/PV.16\r\neconomy, the strategy for which has already been \r\nissued and is being implemented. We seek effective \r\ncooperation in this endeavour.\r\nWe had hoped that the United Nations Conference \r\non Sustainable Development would achieve more than \r\nit did. Nevertheless, we look forward to meaningful \r\nand effective work by the working group on sustainable \r\ndevelopment, to which we are ready to contribute as best \r\nwe can. We are also hopeful that the intergovernmental \r\nprocess under the auspices of the General Assembly \r\nin connection with financing for development will not \r\nturn into a filibustering exercise without any impact on \r\nthis issue, which is so critical for the development of \r\nlow-income countries.\r\nAs I conclude, I wish to express my agreement \r\nwith previous speakers that the twenty-first century \r\nis indeed an African century. As mentioned by my \r\nbrother, the President of Ghana, out of the 10 fastest \r\ngrowing economies in the world last year, six were \r\nAfrican countries. I should also mention that Ethiopia \r\nwas among the six. Africa is indeed changing, and \r\nchanging for the better. There is no greater human \r\nrights violation than attempts to put obstacles in the \r\nway of the success of the ongoing transformations of \r\nAfrica, which will have enormous salutary implications \r\nfor hundreds of millions of Africans.\r\nAfrica is no longer the marginalized continent \r\nof the 1980s or even of the period a little later than \r\nthat. Ethiopia will continue to play its part to ensure \r\nthe success of the transformation and the success \r\nof multilateralism under the auspices of the United \r\nNations.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nFederal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia for the \r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Hailemariam Desalegn, Prime Minister of the \r\nFederal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Royal Highness Prince Moulay \r\nRachid, Prince of the Kingdom of Morocco\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by His Royal Highness Prince Moulay \r\nRachid, Prince of the Kingdom of Morocco.\r\nAbyei, as we are of all our people serving under the \r\nUnited Nations f lag, including those in Darfur.\r\nBefore I move on to the second challenge we face, I \r\nwish to say a few words on broader issues that help put \r\nin perspective the challenge our region faces in securing \r\nsustainable peace and stability. The major war we have \r\nto win is undoubtedly the war on poverty. The most \r\ndifficult challenge we face here in developing the most \r\neffective means to wage that war is that of ensuring that \r\nthe rule of law is observed, both in inter-State relations \r\nand in the domestic sphere. At its most fundamental \r\nlevel, the struggle against extremism is one aspect of \r\nthe struggle to ensure that the rule of law is respected \r\nand the principles of tolerance are adhered to. Wherever \r\nan act of intolerance or a violation of laws occurs, \r\nsometimes in an egregious manner, as in Benghazi, it \r\nneeds to be condemned.\r\nThe second challenge we face in sustaining our \r\ndevelopment agenda relates to a host of issues impinging \r\non our capacity to ensure sustainable development. \r\nLet us be frank and admit that there is a huge deficit \r\nin international cooperation for the development of \r\nboth low-income and least developed countries. At \r\nthe end of the day, regardless of other impediments to \r\ndevelopment, the major bottleneck for countries such \r\nas Ethiopia for ensuring sustainable development and \r\nsuccessfully achieving the Millennium Development \r\nGoals is related to shortfalls in development finance. \r\nWe said as much in the Paris Declaration on Aid \r\nEffectiveness and the Accra Agenda for Action, \r\nand, recently, in the Busan Partnership for Effective \r\nDevelopment Cooperation, but the results have been \r\nfew and far between. In our view, the current global \r\neconomic situation should never be allowed to detract \r\nattention from the critical need for development finance \r\nof low-income countries.\r\nThe challenge in this area is compounded and \r\nmade even worse by climate change, which is a global \r\nchallenge calling for responsible and wise leadership \r\nat the international level. The response should rely \r\non full commitment to the principle of common but \r\ndifferentiated responsibilities. However boring it may \r\nbe, something that is universally acknowledged bears \r\nrepeating. Countries such as Ethiopia which did not \r\ncontribute to climate change are nonetheless those most \r\naffected by it. But, still, we recognize our obligation. \r\nThat is why Ethiopia has already opted for a green \r\ngrowth path, and our current five-year Growth and \r\nTransformation Plan is based on developing a green \r\n10 12-52402\r\nA/67/PV.16\r\nHis Royal Highness Prince Moulay Rachid, Prince \r\nof the Kingdom of Morocco, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Royal Highness Prince Moulay Rachid, \r\nPrince of the Kingdom of Morocco, and inviting him to \r\naddress the General Assembly.\r\nPrince Moulay Rachid (Morocco) (spoke in \r\nArabic): His Majesty King Mohammed VI asked me to \r\nconvey his appreciation and respect, and I am pleased \r\nto read my speech at the sixty-seventh session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nFirst, I would like to warmly congratulate Mr. Vuk \r\nJeremić, President of the General Assembly at its sixty-\r\nseventh session, on his election. That election is a mark \r\nof esteem for the friendly country of Serbia as much as \r\nit is a recognition of the vast diplomatic experience he \r\nbrings to the presidency.\r\nI also would like to commend Mr. Jeremić’s \r\npredecessor, Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, President \r\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session, on \r\nhis efforts and achievements during the past year.\r\nSimilarly, I would like to commend Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for his untiring action and his \r\nkeen desire to tackle crises. I applaud his initiatives \r\naimed at enabling the United Nations to rise to the \r\ngrowing challenges facing our world.\r\nSweeping changes are affecting today’s \r\ninternational arena. They include, in particular, a \r\nprotracted global economic crisis that has various \r\nimplications and consequences. There are also a growing \r\nnumber of hotbeds of tension, political disputes and \r\narmed conflicts, as well as complex global challenges \r\nthat exceed the capabilities of individual States, such \r\nas achieving sustainable development, protecting the \r\nenvironment, ensuring respect for human rights and \r\nfighting against the growing scourge of international \r\nterrorism and all forms of organized crime.\r\nGiven the current changes in the world, we, the \r\nStates Members of the United Nations, ought to provide \r\nthe Organization with the means it needs to tackle those \r\nchallenges. To that end, we must expand the scope of \r\nthe Organization’s actions and revitalize its approach, \r\nwhile preserving its principles and purposes, so as to \r\nmake it an active player in ensuring effective political \r\ngovernance and an instrument for equitable economic \r\ngovernance.\r\nThe Kingdom of Morocco fully backs the decision \r\nto give special importance to resolving disputes by \r\npeaceful means. My country applauds the General \r\nAssembly’s decision to make the strengtheing of the \r\nforemost principle in the Charter of the United Nations \r\nthe key objective of the current session.\r\nAchieving international peace and security remains \r\nthe core historic mission entrusted to the United Nations. \r\nThe tens of thousands of United Nations peacekeepers \r\nserving throughout the world to protect civilians and \r\nworking to bring about the right conditions for political \r\ndialogue between the concerned parties clearly attest to \r\nthe vital role played by our Organization in that regard.\r\nThe Kingdom of Morocco takes pride in being one \r\nof the first States to have contributed to peacekeeping \r\noperations under the United Nations banner. So far, \r\nmy country has sent more than 50,000 members of \r\nthe Royal Armed Forces to places around the world to \r\nserve in promoting the lofty objectives of the United \r\nNations. Morocco will remain committed to managing \r\ncrises and will support efforts to promote preventive \r\ndiplomacy.\r\nThe experience gained by the United Nations in \r\nconflict-affected countries points to the importance \r\nof securing smooth, systematic transition from peace \r\nrestoration to peace consolidation. That requires, above \r\nall, a prompt response to the pressing needs raised by \r\ncurrent developments and threats. Otherwise, the threat \r\nof a return to violence and partition will continue to \r\nhang over the countries and regions concerned.\r\nDuring the past year, the African continent has seen \r\na serious deterioration in the situation on the continent, \r\nparticularly in the Sahel and the Sahara regions, owing \r\nto criminal, terrorist and separatist activities, which \r\nnow threaten the stability of the countries concerned.\r\nOur sister nation, the Republic of Mali, is \r\nconfronted with a situation that threatens the country \r\nand its national unity and territorial integrity. Despite \r\nthe sincere efforts exerted by countries in the region, \r\nincluding Morocco and the Economic Community of \r\nWest African States, the contribution of the United \r\nNations is also needed in order to achieve national \r\nconsensus, overcome the political crisis and confront \r\nseparatist activities in the north. Only an independent, \r\nfocused effort on the part of the United Nations can \r\nhelp achieve those objectives. I should like, in that \r\nrespect, to reiterate to our brothers in Mali Morocco’s \r\ncommitment to continue to provide them with aid and \r\n12-52402 11\r\nA/67/PV.16\r\nproviding medical services on a daily basis to Syrian \r\nrefugees in the sisterly Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.\r\nThe rapid developments in the Arab region must \r\nnot distract us from the fundamental, longstanding \r\nchallenge of resolving the Palestinian issue. In \r\nthat regard, the Kingdom of Morocco calls for the \r\nmobilization of international support to back the steps \r\ntaken by the Palestinian National Authority to secure \r\nnon-member State status. At the same time, my country \r\nis of the view that negotiations are the best way for the \r\nPalestinian people to regain their legitimate national \r\nrights and to set up an independent, fully viable and \r\ngeographically contiguous Palestinian State, living side \r\nby side with Israel, in peace and security. I therefore look \r\nforward to seeing the international community change \r\nits approach to resolving that crisis by reconsidering \r\nits intervention mechanisms and work methods in order \r\nto ensure that direct negotiations are resumed very \r\nsoon and in the best possible circumstances, under the \r\nauspices and with the commitment of the influential \r\nPowers.\r\nThat cannot be achieved if the fait accompli \r\npolicy is allowed to continue. In that regard and in my \r\ncapacity as Chair of the Al-Quds Committee, I have \r\nstrongly condemned the Israeli plan for the Judaization \r\nof occupied East Jerusalem, as well as the Israeli plans \r\nto wipe out the city’s spiritual and cultural identity \r\nand change its demographic and urban features. Let \r\nme reaffirm, in that regard, that there can be no peace \r\nwithout East Jerusalem as the capital of an independent \r\nPalestinian state.\r\nSteadfast in its belief in the importance and \r\neffectiveness of joint regional action, the Kingdom \r\nof Morocco has undertaken initiatives and bilateral \r\ncontacts to inject fresh momentum into the Arab \r\nMaghreb Union. Indeed, my country believes that such \r\na strategic, inclusive regional bloc is urgently needed; \r\nnot only does it meet the legitimate aspirations of our \r\npeoples, but it is also necessitated by the security and \r\ndevelopment challenges facing the five Maghreb States. \r\nIn a bid to overcome obstacles that might hinder the \r\nrealization of that Maghreb ambition, the Kingdom of \r\nMorocco has contributed in a sincere, dedicated manner \r\nto negotiations aimed at finding a realistic, mutually \r\nacceptable political solution to the artificial regional \r\ndispute over the Moroccan Sahara — a solution that \r\nwould guarantee the Kingdom’s national unity and \r\nterritorial integrity, allow for reunification to take \r\nactive support for the success of the political process \r\nand the preservation of their country’s national unity \r\nand territorial integrity.\r\nAt the same time, the Kingdom of Morocco lauds \r\nthe notable progress made in several parts of Africa, \r\nespecially in the sister nations of Côte d’Ivoire and \r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, towards the \r\npromotion of national reconciliation and a return to \r\npolitical normalcy. Moreover, Morocco reiterates \r\nits firm commitment to pursuing cooperation and \r\nsolidarity programmes with various African sister \r\nnations, using efficient, dyпаmic approaches to South-\r\nSouth cooperation for the benefit of African citizens.\r\nThe changes witnessed in the Arab region reflect \r\nthe will of the peoples involved to build democratic \r\nsocieties where human rights are respected and where \r\ncitizens enjoy equal opportunities and a dignified life. \r\nThe peoples in the sister nations of Tunisia, Libya, Egypt \r\nand Yemen have ushered in a new era and have made \r\ngreat headway towards a democratic transition, despite \r\na complex and tumultuous political environment, a \r\nfact that makes it incumbent upon the international \r\ncommunity to provide support and assistance to those \r\ncountries to deal with the constraints and difficulties \r\nthat they face.\r\nIt is, on the other hand, most regrettable that the \r\nSyrian people are each day paying a daily price in \r\nblood for their freedom. They yearn for the kind of \r\ndemocratic change that would enable each component \r\nof the Syrian population to contribute to achieving the \r\ndesired change. Morocco, as the only Arab country \r\nsitting on the Security Council, has significantly \r\ncontributed to mobilizing international support for the \r\nLeague of Arab States’ initiatives and resolutions. We \r\ncall for concerted efforts and decisive action to compel \r\nthe Syrian regime to put an end to the violence. We \r\nalso call for a political transition process that would \r\nallow for the full spectrum of opinions to be heard, \r\nthe aspirations of the Syrian people to be fulfilled, and \r\nSyria’s national unity and territorial integrity, as well \r\nas for stability in the entire region, to be ensured.\r\nAt the same time, it is necessary to raise the financial \r\nresources required to meet the needs of refugees \r\nin neighbouring countries and those of internally \r\ndisplaced persons, as well as to ease the suffering of \r\nour Syrian brothers and put an end to their tragedy. In \r\nthat regard, Morocco continues to show its solidarity by \r\n12 12-52402\r\nA/67/PV.16\r\nthe scourge of war, which... has brought untold sorrow \r\nto mankind”. Those are the words of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations: the legacy of our predecessors. Our \r\nhistory tells us that conflict grows in the spaces where \r\nhuman rights are denied; that, where deprivation, \r\ninequality and injustice erode human dignity and \r\npotential, conflict is the consequence; that war follows \r\nhunger, and hunger follows war. That is why the Charter \r\nexpresses in simple and clear terms our commitment \r\nto fundamental human rights. It reaffirms our “faith \r\nin the dignity and worth of the human person, in the \r\nequal rights of men and women and of nations large \r\nand small”.\r\nWords can at times become too familiar, so familiar \r\nthat their force and impact fade with time. We who \r\ngather here each year must remind ourselves what we \r\nstand for, ref lect honestly on what we have achieved and \r\nwhat we have not achieved, and rededicate ourselves to \r\nthe ideals set out in our Charter. We must make those \r\nlofty words relevant again to the peoples for whom we \r\nspeak here.\r\nThe struggle for human rights is being fought every \r\nday in every region of the world. There are too many \r\nforgotten places and forgotten causes. We must not turn \r\naway from the dark corners where the media spotlight \r\ndoes not shine or from which the media spotlight has \r\nlong departed. We must speak here for the five-year-\r\nold child, without a family, struggling to survive in a \r\nrefugee camp; for the hungry mother cradling a dying \r\ninfant at a feeding station; for those who cannot speak \r\npublicly in their own lands and who look to us here \r\nfor the vindication of their basic rights; for those who \r\nbelieve in the words of our Charter and expect us to act \r\non them.\r\nWhat is happening in Syria is an affront to \r\nhumanity. Syrian children, Syrian women and Syrian \r\nmen, young and old, are being slaughtered by their own \r\nGovernment. A national army — the army of a sovereign \r\nState and Member of this Organization — is shelling its \r\nown people as they queue for bread, and is launching \r\nairstrikes on its own cities. We find compelling evidence \r\nof wholesale massacres in towns such as Houla, and \r\nwe see Syrian children trying to make sense of their \r\nshattered lives in refugee camps in neighbouring \r\ncountries. The violence is indiscriminate, and on an \r\nappalling scale. And it is not confined to one side.\r\nThe people of Syria deserve the full support of \r\nthe international community for the efforts to bring \r\nplace, and respect the characteristics of the region’s \r\npopulations.\r\nMorocco remains committed and willing to \r\nnegotiate on the basis of the principles established and \r\nrepeatedly reaffirmed by the Security Council, as well \r\nas the autonomy initiative, which the international \r\ncommunity has deemed serious, realistic and credible. \r\nMorocco will also continue to cooperate constructively \r\nwith the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in \r\nWestern Sahara, on the basis of the mandate entrusted \r\nto it by the Security Council — a mandate that will not \r\nchange in any way; neither in form nor substance.\r\nI cannot conclude without referring to the need for \r\ncollective, effective and concerted action against all \r\nforms of extremism, hatred, xenophobia, provocation \r\nand rejection of those different from us and the \r\nundermining of their beliefs, for whatever reason and \r\nin whichever form. Given the increase in appalling \r\nacts of that kind, often with tragic consequences, I \r\nbelieve national efforts to tackle them must be part of \r\na concerted international strategy that should take into \r\naccount existing constructive initiatives, build on the \r\nmobilization of all United Nations bodies, be based on \r\nclear commitments, and encourage law-making and the \r\ndissemination of national and regional best practices in \r\nthat area.\r\nIt is up to us as Member States to provide the \r\nnecessary means and to reiterate our political will to \r\nsupport the Organization and reform its structures and \r\nintervention mechanisms. The aim is to enhance its \r\neffectiveness in terms of achieving peace and security \r\nand promoting cooperation, while enabling it to fulfil \r\nits indispensable mission of furthering tolerance and \r\ncoexistence, for the benefit of all mankind.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank His Royal Highness Prince \r\nMoulay Rachid, Prince of the Kingdom of Morocco, for \r\nthe statement he has just made.\r\nHis Royal Highness Prince Moulay Rachid, Prince \r\nof the Kingdom of Morocco, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Eamon Gilmore, Deputy Prime \r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of \r\nthe State of Ireland.\r\nMr. Gilmore (Ireland): The primary mission of the \r\nUnited Nations is to “save succeeding generations from \r\n12-52402 13\r\nA/67/PV.16\r\nthat goal, would accord Palestine non-member State \r\nobserver status. Ireland will be proud to support a \r\nfair and balanced resolution to that end, and we look \r\nforward to the forthcoming consultations.\r\nWe know of course that such steps will not alter \r\nthe situation on the ground. Israel must stop expanding \r\nsettlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, \r\nwhich only impede the prospect of achieving Israel’s \r\nown stated desire for a Palestinian State. The peace \r\nand security of the people of Israel, to which they are \r\nentitled, gain nothing from denying the basic rights of \r\nthe people of Gaza, who are subjected to an unjust and \r\ncounterproductive blockade.\r\nThere is no alternative to serious negotiations \r\nbetween the two sides aimed at a comprehensive \r\nsettlement. I would like to see President Abbas and \r\nPrime Minister Netanyahu commit themselves to \r\nachieving a comprehensive peace agreement within \r\na specified timescale. That will not be easy and will \r\nrequire painful compromises on both sides. But if both \r\nleaders are willing to embark on that path they will \r\nhave the unstinting support of the entire international \r\ncommunity, including Ireland.\r\nPeace and security are inextricably linked to \r\ndevelopment. And development is at the heart of \r\nIreland’s foreign policy. We have maintained our \r\nofficial development assistance above 0.5 per cent of \r\ngross national product — an important achievement \r\nin the face of major economic difficulties — and we \r\nremain committed to reaching the United Nations target \r\nof 0.7 per cent as soon as we possibly can.\r\nIreland’s aid programme represents a genuine \r\ninvestment by the Irish people in the world we share \r\nwith the people of developing countries. We focus in \r\nparticular on the countries of sub-Saharan Africa. We \r\nhave prioritized investments in education, in health, in \r\ngood governance, and in the lives and rights of girls \r\nand women and of persons living with HIV and AIDS. \r\nWe have seen remarkable economic progress made in \r\nAfrican countries as a result of such investments. But \r\ngreat inequalities still persist.\r\nIt is in all our interests as global citizens to stay \r\nthe course in relation to the Millennium Development \r\nGoals and to continue to work together for a sustainable \r\nand just world in which States operate on the basis of \r\nthe rights of all people to participate in and contribute \r\nto society and inclusive economies.\r\nabout an end to their suffering and to achieve an early \r\npolitical transition. Ireland backs the Joint Special \r\nEnvoy of the United Nations and the League of Arab \r\nNations, Lakhdar Brahimi, in his difficult task. The \r\npriority must be to achieve an immediate ceasefire and \r\nto get a political process under way that will facilitate \r\nthe transition.\r\nWhat is needed, above all, is a strong Security \r\nCouncil resolution that will authorize targeted sanctions. \r\nIt must include a comprehensive arms embargo against \r\nall those who are responsible for violating the human \r\nrights of the Syrian people. That is what the Syrian \r\npeople want from us, and what they have a right to \r\nexpect.\r\nThere must also be full accountability for human \r\nrights abuses. To prevent further atrocities now and to \r\nsave lives now, we must make it clear now that atrocities \r\nwill not go unpunished. That is why Ireland supports \r\nthe call by the United Nations High Commissioner for \r\nHuman Rights and by Switzerland and others for the \r\nSecurity Council to refer the situation in Syria to the \r\nInternational Criminal Court. We are working to build \r\nup strong cross-regional support for such a referral.\r\nIf the events in the Arab world over the past two \r\nyears have taught us anything, it is that leaders who deny \r\nlegitimate demands for greater political and economic \r\nfreedom and who instead resort to waging war on their \r\nown people will inevitably lose the right to rule. The \r\nsystematic denial of human rights and suppression of \r\ndemocratic liberties has fuelled a profound desire for \r\nchange. In Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Syria, Bahrain and \r\nelsewhere, Ireland has supported the will of the people, \r\npeacefully expressed, to bring about long-overdue \r\ndemocratic reforms.\r\nAs world attention focuses on Syria, peace and \r\njustice remain elusive elsewhere in the Middle East. \r\nThe need for a lasting resolution of the Arab-Israeli \r\nconflict is as urgent as ever. Yet a depressing stalemate \r\npersists, with no progress towards a comprehensive \r\nsettlement. Ireland has said on many occasions that \r\nthe establishment of a Palestinian State, within borders \r\nbased on those of 1967, is long overdue. We have made \r\nclear our hope that Palestine will be formally admitted \r\nto the United Nations as a full Member. While that hope \r\nremains to be fulfilled, we welcome the announcement \r\nby President Abbas of his plans to consult with the \r\nmembership of the General Assembly on a resolution \r\nthat, as an interim step towards the achievement of \r\n14 12-52402\r\nA/67/PV.16\r\nA deep attachment to the safeguarding of human \r\nrights has been at the heart of Ireland’s foreign policy \r\nsince the foundation of our State. Ireland’s commitment \r\nto the protection and promotion of human rights has \r\nbeen shaped by our own history. As a small island \r\nnation that has experienced the impact of colonialism, \r\ncivil war and conflict, we learned the hard way that \r\nhuman rights can never be taken for granted.\r\nFrom the earliest days of our United Nations \r\nmembership, we pioneered the promotion of nuclear \r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation. We also paid close \r\nattention to decolonization and the struggle against \r\napartheid. Today, we make substantial contributions \r\nto United Nations development agencies and funds and \r\nare active participants in United Nations peacekeeping \r\noperations. Thousands of Irishmen and Irishwomen \r\nhave served in United Nations peacekeeping forces, \r\nand our people are intensely proud of that contribution \r\nto the ideals of the United Nations.\r\nIreland also plays an active role in the work being \r\ndone in the United Nations framework to protect and \r\npromote human rights. We are proud that our former \r\nPresident, Mary Robinson, served with distinction as \r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights \r\nfrom 1997 to 2002. When the Human Rights Council \r\nwas first established in 2006, Ireland declared that it \r\nwould seek election to that body in 2012. That is the \r\nfirst occasion on which we have sought election to the \r\nCouncil.\r\nWe are committed to a robust and effective Human \r\nRights Council. We want to see a principled Council \r\nthat provides real leadership in that critical area. We \r\nalso value and support the full participation of small \r\nStates in the work of the Council. The Universal \r\nPeriodic Review process has opened up an important \r\nspace for national dialogue on human rights. Ireland \r\nengaged constructively and self-critically in its own \r\nreview. We are also firmly committed to a strengthened \r\nUnited Nations treaty monitoring body system and have \r\nactively contributed to efforts to reinforce that system.\r\nThreats to human rights worldwide are proliferating \r\nsteadily, whether from widespread poverty and hunger, \r\nrepressive systems of governance, religious intolerance, \r\ngender-based violence or other sources. If Ireland is \r\nelected to the Human Rights Council in November, \r\nwe will serve the cause of international human rights \r\nprotection as an active and committed member of the \r\nCouncil.\r\nAgainst that background, the reality of hunger \r\npersists in our world. The scandal is that we have the \r\ntools to tackle that suffering and that terrible waste of \r\nhuman potential. How can people realize their rights \r\nand potential if they cannot meet their most basic needs \r\nfor existence?\r\nNo country knows that better than Somalia. Once, \r\nSomalia was at the centre of the world’s attention. But \r\nthe media spotlight moved on, and the people of Somalia \r\nhave faced a long struggle to emerge from war, famine \r\nand instability. Today, more than two million Somalis \r\nstill need our help. On the last Sunday of July 2012, \r\nI visited Mogadishu. Amidst the grinding poverty and \r\nthe misery of insecurity, I saw genuine signs of hope \r\nand opportunity. Schools, homes, shops and businesses \r\nare being rebuilt and reopened, and people are returning \r\nfrom exile. Increased international engagement has \r\nbeen essential. Real progress is also being achieved \r\nin Somalia’s transition to democracy, with impressive \r\nengagement by Somali traditional and political leaders. \r\nWe must support them.\r\nI pledge today that Ireland will not turn away from \r\nSomalia or from humanitarian emergencies elsewhere \r\nin the Horn of Africa, the Sahel and across the globe. \r\nWe will work with our partners to highlight forgotten \r\ncrises and the needs of fragile States, as well as to forge \r\na more coherent and effective international approach \r\ntowards humanitarian action and development policy.\r\nIreland has made the fight against hunger and \r\nundernourishment the key priority of its development \r\npolicy. We have delivered on our commitment to direct \r\n20 per cent of our aid budget to that priority. With our \r\npartners, we have worked closely with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to build and support the Scaling Up Nutrition \r\nmovement. But we must do more. Collectively, we must \r\nact now to recognize the systemic linkages between \r\nrecurring food price crises, humanitarian emergencies, \r\nchronic undernourishment and the effects of climate \r\nchange.\r\nThere is nothing that connects us more across \r\nborders, across oceans and across generations than \r\nour mutual dependence on the planet that we share. \r\nClimate change is not something happening in a far-off \r\nland or in a distant future. It is happening now and it is \r\nhappening fast. It is not for another generation to solve. \r\nIt is for us to take responsibility, to strive to achieve \r\nclimate justice, and to act.\r\n12-52402 15\r\nA/67/PV.16\r\nof the United Nations as a multilateral forum for \r\naddressing today’s crises and challenges. The conflicts \r\nin Syria and Mali and the ongoing reform processes in \r\nmany parts of the Arab world demonstrate that we can \r\nface such challenges only through concerted action.\r\nIn Syria, thousands have lost their lives in their \r\nstruggle for freedom and reform owing to crimes \r\ncommitted by a regime that denies them every basic \r\nhuman right in order to stay in power. Austria condemns \r\nthe systematic human rights violations and bloodshed \r\nin Syria in the strongest possible terms. The more than \r\n27,000 victims and some 2.5 million people in dire \r\nneed of humanitarian assistance are a stark reminder \r\nfor each and every one of us that it is high time for the \r\nUnited Nations to finally act. The Security Council, in \r\nparticular, must assume its responsibilities in relation \r\nto the ever-worsening situation in the country. Violence \r\nhas to stop immediately, and both sides have to engage \r\nin a meaningful dialogue facilitated by Joint Special \r\nRepresentative Lakhdar Brahimi. There will be no \r\nsolution unless President Al-Assad steps aside and \r\ngives way to the forces of reason and reconciliation.\r\nAustria continues to fully support the ongoing \r\ntransition processes in the Arab world. We welcome \r\nthe efforts undertaken so far to lay the foundations \r\nfor more open, inclusive and prosperous societies. We \r\nencourage the newly empowered authorities to fulfil \r\ntheir mandate for democratic change responsibly. The \r\naspirations of the people for dignity and freedom must \r\nbe satisfied, thereby contributing to peace and stability \r\nin the region.\r\nIn that context, let me reiterate my strongest \r\ncondemnation of the recent attacks on diplomatic \r\nmissions and personnel, especially the murder of \r\nAmbassador Chris Stevens and three of his colleagues \r\nin Benghazi. Violence is never an acceptable response \r\nto the exercise of the fundamental right of freedom of \r\nspeech. To attack an Embassy and its personnel is not \r\nonly contrary to international law but an attack on the \r\nvery ideals that the United Nations stands for, namely, \r\nthe peaceful cooperation of Member States to build a \r\nbetter future together.\r\nThe still unresolved Israeli-Palestinian conflict \r\ncontinues to gravely destabilize the Middle \r\nEast. The terms of a negotiated and sustainable \r\nsolution — two States with secure and mutually \r\nrecognized borders — have been discussed over and \r\nover again and are broadly supported by the people and \r\nThe United Nations was founded on the principle \r\nthat diplomatic engagement and dialogue between \r\nnations are essential to peace and human development. \r\nAttacks on diplomatic missions, such as we saw \r\nrecently in Benghazi, are attacks on that principle. \r\nThey are never acceptable and must be condemned by \r\nthe international community.\r\nIreland is currently chairing the Organization for \r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). That has \r\nenabled us to make a contribution to the search for \r\nagreement across the full range of the OSCE’s activities. \r\nWe have drawn on our own experience in building \r\npeace in Northern Ireland to contribute to the work of \r\nthe OSCE, which seeks to find peaceful settlements to \r\nprotracted conflicts. I am hopeful that by the end of our \r\nterm in office we will have been able to make progress \r\nin some key areas, including in the so-called human \r\ndimension of the OSCE and on some conflict issues.\r\nWe have used our chairmanship to prioritize \r\nInternet freedom, reflecting the increasing importance \r\nof the Internet as a platform for the exercise of human \r\nrights and fundamental freedoms. A major conference \r\nin Dublin last June focused on how human rights \r\nand fundamental freedoms do not change with new \r\ntechnologies, but extend seamlessly into the digital \r\nage. We look forward to assuming the presidency of the \r\nEuropean Union Council of Ministers in the first half \r\nof next year. We will bring to that role the same energy \r\nand commitment that we have devoted to discharging \r\nour OSCE responsibilities.\r\nA distinguished Irish politician and lawyer of the \r\nlate eighteenth century, John Philpot Curran, once \r\nremarked that “the price of liberty is eternal vigilance”. \r\nIf we are to live up to the aspirations of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations, we must also assume the burden of \r\neternal vigilance. The daily challenges to human rights \r\nare painfully obvious. Our response must be clear and \r\nunrelenting. In the words of the Vienna Declaration and \r\nProgramme of Action, the promotion and protection \r\nof human rights is “the first responsibility” of \r\nGovernments. We cannot and must not shy from that \r\nresponsibility.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to \r\nMr. Michael Spindelegger, Vice-Chancellor and Federal \r\nMinister for European and International Affairs of \r\nAustria.\r\nMr. Spindelegger (Austria): The events of recent \r\nmonths have illustrated once again the importance \r\n16 12-52402\r\nA/67/PV.16\r\nthe international community, and yet we experienced a \r\ncomplete lack of progress in the last year. We therefore \r\ncall on the leadership on both sides to finally assume \r\ntheir responsibilities and enable a lasting peace and \r\nsecurity to be established for their children and future \r\ngenerations.\r\nThe situation in Mali also continues to be a \r\nmatter of grave concern. Austria has been dismayed \r\nby the political turmoil, with its disastrous effects on \r\nthe Malian population. Growing insecurity and the \r\ncontinued deterioration of the humanitarian and human \r\nrights situation call for concerted action. The high-level \r\nmeeting held on Wednesday was an important signal \r\nthat we are moving in that direction. We fully support \r\nthe efforts by the Economic Community of West \r\nAfrican States and the African Union to try to find, \r\ntogether with the United Nations, a lasting political \r\nsolution to the crisis in Mali and the Sahel region as \r\na whole. Austria will advocate for increased support \r\nfrom the European Union to contribute to that end.\r\nIn the light of the crises and challenges the \r\ninternational community is facing, Austria welcomes \r\nPresident Jeremić’s timely choice of theme to highlight \r\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes in this year’s \r\ngeneral debate. Prevention is always better — and \r\ncheaper — than a cure. The progress made in Sierra \r\nLeone, Kyrgyzstan, Nepal and Myanmar testifies how \r\nsuccessful sustainable mediation efforts can be.\r\nThe peaceful settlement of disputes can be achieved \r\nonly through open dialogue, based on mutual respect. \r\nAustria has a long-standing tradition of promoting \r\nintercultural and interreligious dialogue. We are proud \r\nto host the fifth Global Forum of the United Nations \r\nAlliance of Civilizations in Vienna. It will take place on \r\n27 and 28 February 2013, under the title “Responsible \r\nLeadership in Diversity and Dialogue”. Austria highly \r\nvalues the contribution of youth as a transformative \r\nforce. Therefore, the day before the Global Forum will \r\nbe dedicated to the Alliance of Civilizations youth \r\nevent in order to benefit from their views.\r\nIn that context, I am also pleased to inform that \r\nthe King Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz International Centre \r\nfor lnterreligious and Intercultural Dialogue will be \r\ninaugurated on 26 November in Vienna. The Centre, \r\na joint initiative of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, \r\nthe Kingdom of Spain and the Republic of Austria, \r\nwill certainly offer a significant contribution to the \r\npromotion of dialogue.\r\nWe need to be clear that sustainable peace and \r\ndevelopment go hand in hand with respect for human \r\nrights, democracy and the rule of law. These are universal \r\nvalues that no human being should be denied. We must \r\nnot falter until this goal is achieved. In 2011, Austria \r\nwas elected to the Human Rights Council. We fully \r\nsupport the Council and its mechanisms, especially the \r\nuniversal periodic review. The Council is best placed \r\nto react swiftly in case of human rights emergencies. \r\nIts special sessions on Syria and Libya illustrated that \r\nthe international community will not turn a blind eye \r\non gross human rights violations and indiscriminate \r\nattacks against the civilian population. Human rights \r\nabuses must not go unpunished. Violations must be \r\nthoroughly investigated and perpetrators must be \r\nheld accountable before credible judicial institutions, \r\nincluding the International Criminal Court.\r\nOur membership of the Human Rights Council \r\nis an opportunity to continue working on the key \r\npriorities that Austria pursued during its Security \r\nCouncil membership in 2009 and 2010: the protection of \r\ncivilians, the safety of journalists, the implementation \r\nof resolution 1325 (2000) on women, peace and security, \r\nthe freedom of religion and belief, and the protection of \r\nchildren from violence and abuse.\r\nThe High-level Meeting of 24 September was an \r\nimportant opportunity to renew our commitment to \r\nthe rule of law at the national and international levels. \r\nIt now needs an adequate follow-up. As chair of the \r\nGroup of Friends of the Rule of Law, Austria will \r\nprovide concrete proposals for the upcoming report of \r\nthe Secretary-General.\r\nThe various United Nations headquarters in Vienna \r\nare a hub for promoting peace and security. The work \r\nof the International Atomic Energy Agency is more \r\nrelevant than ever. I am pleased that we can now also \r\ndraw on additional services from the new office of the \r\nOffice for Disarmament Affairs established in Vienna.\r\nAustria is deeply concerned about programmes \r\nfor weapons of mass destruction and proliferation \r\nactivities in several regions of the world. The creation \r\nof a zone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of \r\nmass destruction in the Middle East is more urgent than \r\never. In that respect, let me underline that Iran must \r\nfinally give credible evidence for the peaceful nature of \r\nits nuclear programmeme and engage in earnest in the \r\ntalks with the European Union three plus one group. \r\nThe continued inability to even initiate substantive \r\n12-52402 17\r\nA/67/PV.16\r\nmultilateral disarmament negotiations is unacceptable. \r\nAustria is committed to working with other interested \r\nStates to move forward on that crucial issue. I would \r\nlike to thank the Secretary-General for his continued \r\nsupport in that matter.\r\nWe need to move beyond a strictly military security \r\napproach that originates from the Cold War period. It \r\nis time to change the discourse on nuclear weapons. \r\nAny use of nuclear weapons would be devastating for \r\nthe whole world in its humanitarian and environmental \r\neffects. In the twenty-first century, such an existential \r\nthreat to humankind can no longer be handled \r\nexclusively by a few States as a national security matter.\r\nAustria is committed to strengthening and further \r\ndeveloping international law and a humanitarian \r\napproach to advance the global disarmament and \r\nnon-proliferation agenda. A lot has been achieved in \r\nthe past two decades, as evidenced by the successful \r\nconclusions of the conventions to ban anti-personnel \r\nmines and cluster munitions. We hope that similar \r\nprogress can be achieved on the arms trade treaty in the \r\ncoming months. Other Member States should join the \r\nemerging consensus on regulating the trade in arms in \r\na comprehensive manner.\r\nVienna and its United Nations headquarters also \r\nserve as a platform for the discussion on sustainable \r\ndevelopment. We welcome the decision of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to establish an implementation office for his \r\nSustainable Energy for All initiative. That will help \r\nto advance this important agenda. Universal access to \r\nenergy and the improvement of energy efficiency, along \r\nwith a higher share of renewable energy, are goals that \r\nwill help bring electricity to the billion and a half people \r\nworldwide lacking access. Equally, it will help control \r\ngreenhouse gas emissions and global warming, which \r\nthreaten the very existence of many Member States.\r\nThis year’s United Nations Conference on \r\nSustainable Development marked the beginning of a \r\nnew era, renewing the prospects for future generations \r\nvia the sustainable development goals, as tailored to \r\nthe needs of different countries or groups of States \r\nand regions. While implementing those new global \r\ngoals, we should not cease our efforts to achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals by the target date of \r\n2015.\r\nAustria remains fully committed to an effective \r\nmultilateral system. Therefore we will support the \r\nefforts of the President of the Assembly and of the \r\nSecretary-General to further increase the effectiveness \r\nof our Organization in order to better enable us to face \r\nthe challenges of our time.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Samuel Santos López, Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof the Republic of Nicaragua.\r\nMr. Santos López (Nicaragua) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nAs I address the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh \r\nsession, I would like first of all to convey the warm \r\ngreetings and solidarity of the people of Nicaragua and \r\nits Government of national reconciliation and unity, \r\nled by Comrade President Comandante Daniel Ortega \r\nSaavedra, who wishes us success in our work. \r\nThe changes now taking place in science, economy, \r\ngeopolitics, technology, ecology and culture are truly \r\nrevolutions in the life of all human societies around \r\nthe world, but they raise doubts about the effectiveness \r\nof international organizations in conducting global \r\naffairs. The situation in the world today proves that \r\nwhen governance is conceived and conducted from the \r\nperspective of global capitalism — savage, as it was \r\ncalled by His Holiness Pope John Paul II — instead of \r\nbecoming a factor for positive transformation, as we \r\nwere led to believe it would, it can lead us to the edge \r\nof civilization.\r\nThe vertiginous development of speculative venture \r\ncapital in developed countries has reduced the role of \r\nthe State in public affairs. The market imposes itself \r\nin all areas — the economy, politics, culture, society, \r\nindividuals and the mass media — thus strengthening the \r\ninfluence of the interests of giant corporations involved \r\nin food production, communications, medicine and the \r\nmilitary-industrial complex. They are the real power \r\nin decisions having a global impact; their decisions \r\ndetermine the course of many important events related \r\nto the economy and to peace. That is totally contrary to \r\nthe idea that gave rise to our Organization. That situation \r\nis aggravated by the growing sense that, increasingly, \r\nwell-being and world power are completely in the \r\nhands of market and finance elites, that the people’s \r\nstandards of living are dramatically crumbling and \r\nthat confidence in the capacity of all Governments to \r\nsolve the most pressing problems is decreasing at an \r\naccelerating pace.\r\nMr. Balé (Congo), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe impact of the economic and financial crisis on \r\nthe centres of power of global capitalism is provoking \r\n18 12-52402\r\nA/67/PV.16\r\nNations system. We say “reinvent” because the present \r\nOrganization no longer permits reforms; those that \r\nhave been proposed so far have not made progress, due \r\nthe policy of some permanent members of the Security \r\nCouncil. In the name of the people of Nicaragua, I \r\ninvite all to strongly push for that proposal, in order to \r\nmake a reality of a new Charter of the United Nations \r\nthat guarantees democratization of the Organization.\r\nPeace is a supreme value and a condition in \r\nwhich human activity can develop in a stable manner \r\nbeneficial for all. However, some developments \r\nestablish a dangerous path.\r\nWe consider the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial blockade of Cuba a f lagrant violation of \r\ninternational law and the most basic norms of peaceful \r\ncoexistence. Furthermore, today it is claimed that \r\nthat blockade is based on the arbitrary, groundless \r\nand unilateral inclusion of that fraternal country in a \r\nlist of States sponsoring international terrorism. We \r\ndemand the immediate and unconditional end of that \r\ncrime against humanity, which constitutes an affront \r\nto the conscience of our peoples. We also demand the \r\nimmediate and unconditional release of the five Cuban \r\npatriots who are unjustly kept in prison in the United \r\nStates of America.\r\nWe demand respect for the sovereignty and \r\nindependence of the fraternal Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela, which faces a wave of conspiratorial actions \r\nseeking to destabilize and destroy the democratic plan \r\nof the Bolivarian Revolution and the popular interests, \r\nthus undermining the enormous social and economic \r\ngains obtained by the Venezuelan people through great \r\neffort and courage, with the distinguished leadership of \r\nPresident Hugo Chávez Frias.\r\nThe peace process in Colombia should be fully \r\nsupported in order for the people to start on a path of \r\ntrue social progress.\r\nInternational law should be given unrestricted \r\nsupport as regards the inviolability of Ecuador’s \r\ndiplomatic Mission in the United Kingdom. We also \r\nreaffirm our support of Argentina’s sovereign rights \r\nover the Malvinas Islands and the right of Puerto Rico \r\nto obtain its full independence.\r\nBearing in mind the information disseminated \r\ndaily by the world’s main communication media, it \r\nhas escaped no one’s attention that there is a risk of \r\nwidespread war in the Middle East. The situation in \r\npolitical and social changes with great international \r\nrepercussions. The United States and European \r\ncountries, paradigms of that egotistical model, are at a \r\nloss to find solutions to their structural problems. They \r\ndrag their citizens and the world into unemployment, \r\nsocial insecurity and greater poverty. Thus the \r\nexclusive nature of the privatization of the State and its \r\nsubjection to market forces, speculation and financial \r\nfraud becomes clear, demonstrating the urgent need for \r\nequitable distribution of wealth worldwide.\r\nMany outstanding thinkers describe the scenario as \r\na struggle between the market and the State. However, \r\nthe paradox is that the very State that wanted to find the \r\nparadigm for development in the greater comfort of its \r\ncitizens is one that today, without political scruples or \r\nethics, develops a new neoliberal programme, disguised \r\nas necessary adjustments to save the economy and \r\ndefend the citizens. That reveals that in developed \r\ncountries, the economy, the market and political power \r\nare the same thing. In them, the State has evolved only to \r\nmerge into one programme the interests of speculative \r\nfinancial capital, of large global corporations and \r\nindustries and of the military-industrial complex. \r\nWe are certain that the nature of these adjustments is \r\npermanent, and that it is a new economic agenda that \r\nwill direct the greatest concentration of power to the \r\nhighest global level in the quest to dictate the path of \r\na new capitalist model that in all spheres of life is ever \r\nmore concentrated.\r\nThe world of 1945, after the Second World War, \r\ngave rise to all the institutions that constitute global \r\ngovernance, beginning with our Organization. That \r\nworld no longer exists. Thus today as never before it \r\nis imperative that we re-establish a philosophy of firm \r\nand lasting world peace and of economic development \r\nfor the benefit of all the peoples of the world — that is, \r\nthe philosophy that inspired the founders of the United \r\nNations system, the philosophy of global governability \r\nand management.\r\nIn that connection, we reiterate the urgency of \r\nmaking progress in the reform of the United Nations \r\nsystem, or rather in its reinvention. Nicaraguans have \r\nthe honour of having taken the initiative in this matter. \r\nOur brother, the former Foreign Minister of Nicaragua \r\nand President of the the General Assembly at its sixty-\r\nthird session, Father Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann, \r\ntogether with President Daniel Ortega Saavedra and \r\nother great present-day thinkers, have taken on the task \r\nof developing a plan for the reinvention of the United \r\n12-52402 19\r\nA/67/PV.16\r\nresources for the prohibition and interception of drugs, \r\nconsequently delaying our social investments. \r\nIn that scenario, which is not very encouraging \r\nand in which we are far from being triumphant, Latin \r\nAmerica and the Caribbean are making great strides \r\nin strengthening their economic, political, social and \r\ncultural integration and unity through the Central \r\nAmerican Integration System, the Bolivarian Alliance \r\nfor the Peoples of Our America and the Community of \r\nLatin American and Caribbean States. Our regional \r\nprocess of integration and unity through the Central \r\nAmerican Integration System advances consistently and \r\non solid ground, based on the common objectives that \r\nfurther the peace and economic and social development \r\nof Central Americans. Our model for integration and \r\nunity is also evident in the Bolivarian Alliance for the \r\nPeoples of Our America, which has a component of \r\nfair trade, complementarity, cooperation and solidarity \r\namong its members. Another expression of this process \r\nis the Community of Latin American and Caribbean \r\nStates, which was established in 2011 and is convincing \r\nproof of our integrationist calling. \r\nThe principles and purposes of the Movement of \r\nNon-Aligned Countries constitute a broad common \r\nplatform, which has world reach and is contributing \r\nto the development of a multipolar world and to the \r\nstrengthening of peace and international security. In \r\nthat context, our Government of national reconciliation \r\nand unity, presided over by Comandante Daniel Ortega \r\nSaavedra, and our people are achieving important \r\nresults in the struggle against poverty. That strengthens \r\nthe process of restoring rights, which translates into \r\nmore health, better education, more productive and \r\nservice-oriented infrastructure, and a higher living \r\nstandard for all our citizens. \r\nVery soon we will have transformed our energy \r\nmatrix, using sources of renewable energy, so that by \r\n2017, 94 per cent of energy consumed will be renewable \r\nenergy. We have decided to take the necessary steps for \r\nthe construction of the great inter-ocean canal through \r\nNicaragua for ships weighing more than 250,000 tons.\r\nClimate change and all its related effects constitute \r\none of the most formidable challenges of our time. The \r\ndeveloped countries should comply with their legally \r\nbinding environmental commitments. The valuable \r\nnatural resources of our planet must not be privatized \r\nin favour of a few.\r\nSyria is unacceptable. We strongly condemn the acts of \r\nterrorism that have cost the lives of high-level officials \r\nof President Bashar Al-Assad’s Government and of \r\nthe population of Syria. Nicaragua recalls that it is a \r\nform of aggression that was already condemned by the \r\nInternational Court of Justice in 1986 in the case of The \r\nRepublic of Nicaragua v. The United States of America. \r\nIt is evident that the mediation promoted by the United \r\nNations is going nowhere, simply because it is being \r\nblocked by the members of NATO and their allies with \r\ninterests in the region. \r\nA peaceful solution with regard to the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran should be promoted. We need to \r\nresolve without delay the aspirations of the Palestinian \r\npeople by supporting the peace negotiations and their \r\nlegitimate right to their own State and to be part of \r\nthe United Nations. We strongly condemn the terrorist \r\nacts in Benghazi, Libya, on 11 September, in which \r\nUnited States Ambassador Christopher Stevens and \r\nthree other United States citizens lost their lives, just \r\nas we condemn any act of terrorism that is an assault \r\non civilization, culture, religion and justice anywhere \r\nin the world.\r\nWe welcome the recent positive developments with \r\nregard to the relationship between China/Taiwan and \r\nthe People’s Republic of China. We have to address the \r\nlegitimate aspirations of Taiwan to participate more \r\nbroadly in all United Nations specialized agencies and \r\norgans.\r\nWe reaffirm our commitment to total and complete \r\ndisarmament and international security. A world free \r\nof nuclear arms and weapons of mass destruction is \r\nindispensable.\r\nOn a different matter, Central America is a transit \r\nzone for the drugs produced in the South and that find in \r\nthe North, in the United States, their largest consumer \r\nmarket and the largest money-laundering operation for \r\nthe traffic in drugs. Central America has expressed \r\nthe need for destination countries to eradicate drug \r\ntrafficking and consumption within their borders, \r\nusing all the technology and resources at their disposal. \r\nLikewise, we have agreed to demand economic support \r\nfor all of Central America in its constant struggle \r\nagainst organized crime and drug trafficking. However, \r\nthe slow pace or lack of commitment to that issue \r\ndoes irreparable damage, especially to the peoples \r\nof Mesoamerica, who have to allocate enormous \r\n20 12-52402\r\nA/67/PV.16\r\nbest of our human nature and our history. The other \r\nworld, the world that refuses change, the world of war \r\nand human misery, the world of the apocalypse being \r\nannounced on television as a novelty, will fail. The \r\nhope and the future for which we struggle will grow \r\nand shine on its remains.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Sergey Lavrov, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Russian Federation.\r\nMr. Lavrov (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): For over a year and a half, the situation in the \r\nMiddle East and North Africa has been the nerve centre \r\nof global politics. The deep changes that have swept \r\nover the region intertwine with the key problems of \r\nmodern international relations and require everyone to \r\ntake a comprehensive approach and to reject simplistic \r\nand ideology-driven patterns and double standards.\r\nRussia has consistently supported peoples in their \r\naspiration to determine their destiny and to pave the \r\nway to more effective models of public governance. \r\nWe believe it is particularly important to carry out \r\nthose transformations in a non-violent way and without \r\noutside interference. We strongly believe that all \r\nmembers of the international community should be \r\ninterested in making the Middle East-North Africa \r\nregion peaceful, stable, democratic and free from \r\ndomestic and inter-State conflicts. So far, however, \r\nthere has been no progress in reaching unanimity in \r\nthe efforts of outside players to create conditions for \r\nachieving that goal.\r\nOf particular concern is the deepening internal \r\nconflict in Syria. We have consistently called for \r\nconsolidated efforts by the international community \r\nto compel the Government and its opponents to \r\nimmediately cease the violence, come to the negotiating \r\ntable and work out a compromise on the content and \r\npace of reforms that would satisfy all Syrians and \r\nensure the safety and rights of all ethnic and religious \r\ngroups. That was the substance of the consensus \r\nrecorded in the final communiqué of the Action Group \r\nfor Syria (S/2012/523, annex), agreed upon in Geneva \r\nas a follow-up to the Kofi Annan plan.\r\nWe call upon all members of the Action Group \r\nto fully abide by the commitments we all took on in \r\nGeneva. That is the fastest way to stop the loss of human \r\nlife in Syria. We proposed a Security Council resolution \r\nendorsing the Geneva communiqué as the basis for \r\nnegotiations at the beginning of the transitional period, \r\nFurthermore, in times of crisis, we can see that \r\nwe run the risk of not reaching all of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals that we proposed to reach by 2015. \r\nWe cannot allow that to happen. The commitments \r\nof the developed countries to allocate 0.7 per cent of \r\ntheir gross national product to official development \r\nassistance must be honoured. \r\nAnother grave problem is that of food insecurity. \r\nThe food crisis is a serious obstacle in the struggle \r\nagainst poverty and hunger. We must work together \r\nto universally restore that right to the peoples. Our \r\nsocieties are struggling with the urgency of satisfying \r\ntheir most basic needs, with equitable profits from the \r\nbenefits of development and with the importance of \r\ndeveloping democracies based on representation and \r\ndirect participation of the citizens. That is a road whose \r\nspecificities must be respected without interference of \r\nany kind. \r\nDangers lurk and have resulted in events that do not \r\ncontribute to our political stability. Coups d’état, such \r\nas those attempted in Venezuela, Bolivia and Ecuador \r\nor those carried out in Honduras and Paraguay, must \r\nbe condemned and rejected, regardless of how they are \r\nexecuted or attempted. We cannot allow coups to once \r\nagain become entrenched as methods for a political \r\nsolution to conflicts, whether within any country or \r\nbetween States.\r\nWe cannot ignore that the process of concentration \r\nof global power has repercussions in the political \r\nand social systems governing our societies. The \r\nfinal blow is intended to destroy or break up popular \r\nsocial movements in order to eliminate States and \r\nGovernments that do not align themselves with the \r\nneoliberal model. Therefore, in the progressive or \r\nrevolutionary national projects manifested through \r\nthe nation States of our Latin and Caribbean America, \r\nour citizens, our peoples, are called to resist and to \r\nraise banners of peace, dignity, identity and national \r\nsovereignty.\r\nWe are constructing a new world governance with \r\nour work to transform international institutions. We are \r\nstrengthening a new world governance by incorporating \r\nmore and more citizens in the work of building this new \r\nworld to which we aspire. The present global order and \r\nits institutions are at an impasse. The only headway \r\nbeing made is through the new effort I am describing \r\nto deeply transform the economy, politics, society and \r\nculture. That effort alone will endure as the fruit of the \r\n12-52402 21\r\nA/67/PV.16\r\namong themselves. In that matter, the League of Arab \r\nStates should play an important role.\r\nOn the whole, we support closer ties between the \r\nUnited Nations and regional entities. I would note \r\nthat in our part of the world today a memorandum on \r\ncooperation was signed between the secretariat of the \r\nCollective Security Treaty Organization and the United \r\nNations Department of Peacekeeping Operations. I am \r\nconvinced that it will increase the efficiency of common \r\nefforts to ensure stability and security.\r\nAll our actions should be founded solidly on the \r\nUnited Nations Charter, which makes no provision \r\nfor the right to change regimes. It is unacceptable to \r\nimpose a political system on a country and its people. \r\nOur position was clearly stated by President Vladimir \r\nPutin speaking at the Kremlin on 26 September. The \r\nentire sequence of events in the Arab world and other \r\nregions proves the futility of any such policy, which can \r\nlead to dangerous interethnic and interreligious clashes \r\nin international relations. \r\nWe believe it is an obligation of all States to protect \r\nfrom provocations and blasphemy the religious feelings \r\nof people of any religious affiliation. At the same \r\ntime, of course, there can be no justification for acts \r\nof terror, regardless of where they are committed, be \r\nthey in Libya, Syria, Iraq, Yemen or anywhere else. \r\nAttacks against diplomats or United Nations personnel \r\nare absolutely unacceptable.\r\nIn general, we are convinced that today, when the \r\nworld is going through a transition period characterized \r\nby instability in the spheres of the economy, politics and \r\ninter-civilizational relations, it is particularly important \r\nfor United Nations Member States to be able to rely \r\non accepted rules of conduct and to agree on a joint \r\nresponse to the threats to global stability. We should \r\nnot allow irresponsible actions dictated by expedient \r\ninterests to shatter the system of international law. The \r\nworld order is threatened by arbitrary interpretation \r\nof such essential principles as the non-use or threat of \r\nforce, the peaceful settlement of disputes, respect for \r\nthe sovereignty and territorial integrity of States and \r\nnon-interference in their domestic affairs.\r\nThose are the key principles of the United Nations \r\nCharter, which confers the primary responsibility for \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security on \r\nthe Security Council. In advancing the reform of the \r\nUnited Nations, it is essential to preserve the capacity of \r\nthe Security Council to perform those functions. Their \r\nbut that proposal was blocked. Those who oppose the \r\nimplementation of the Geneva communiqué bear an \r\nonerous responsibility. They insist on a ceasefire by \r\nthe Government alone and encourage the opposition \r\nto intensify hostilities, in fact pushing Syria even \r\ndeeper into the abyss of bloody internecine strife. The \r\nmilitarization of the conflict continues, with calls for \r\nopen intervention. \r\nExtremist organizations including Al-Qaida \r\nhave become more active in Syria. They perpetrate \r\nterrorist attacks against innocent civilians and civil \r\ninfrastructure. The number of war crimes is growing, on \r\nthe part of both Government forces and the opposition, \r\nas recorded in the recent report of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil’s commission of inquiry (A/HRC/21/50).\r\nRussia resolutely condemns any violence, wherever \r\nit comes from, and is convinced that there is still an \r\nopportunity to undertake collective action. Practical \r\nsteps to overcome the crisis need to begin with a \r\ncomprehensive ceasefire, the release of prisoners and \r\nhostages and the provision of additional humanitarian \r\naid. That would create the conditions to start an \r\ninter-Syrian dialogue. We hope that Lakhdar Brahimi, \r\nJoint Special Representative of the United Nations and \r\nthe League of Arab States, will be able to bring his vast \r\nexperience to bear on moving towards an agreement on \r\nsuch arrangements, with the support of the international \r\ncommunity. Russia will provide its full support to \r\npromote the success of his mission.\r\nThe changes taking place in the Middle East \r\nshould not marginalize the Palestinian problem. The \r\nachievement of a comprehensive, just and lasting Arab-\r\nIsraeli settlement, which should lead, among other \r\nresults, to the establishment of an independent, viable \r\nand contiguous Palestinian State, coexisting in peace \r\nand security with Israel, would be a major contribution \r\nto the normalization of the overall regional situation. \r\nThe Arab Peace Initiative fully retains its relevance, \r\nand we support the efforts of the League of Arab States \r\nto move it forward.\r\nI also wish to stress the importance of implementing \r\nthe decision on convening in 2012 a conference on \r\nestablishing in the Middle East a zone free of weapons \r\nof mass destruction and their means of delivery (see \r\nNPT/CONF/2010/50 (Vol.I)). It is clearly necessary to \r\nensure the participation in the conference of all States in \r\nthe region, and they should agree on key arrangements \r\n22 12-52402\r\nA/67/PV.16\r\nAll of this is related to the debate regarding the \r\nconcept of the so-called responsibility to protect. Further \r\ndiscussion of this concept should be held on the basis \r\nof the approach agreed on at the 2005 World Summit, \r\nwhich reaffirmed the need to observe the principles of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations when responding to \r\nconflicts within States. The protection of civilians is an \r\nissue far too serious to be exploited to achieve political \r\ngoals. The ambiguity of the so-called responsibility-\r\nto-protect concept can be better understood in light of \r\ninitiatives formulated by Brazil and several other States \r\nto move towards consensus.\r\nLet us not forget that the founders of the United \r\nNations, in their wisdom, agreed upon and endorsed \r\na Charter that enshrined principles for the regulation \r\nof a multipolar world order. Now that the abnormal \r\nbipolar period of the Cold War is over, and now that \r\nit has become clear to all that there is no place for \r\nmonopolarity in the modern world and international \r\naffairs can only be polycentric, we have a unique \r\nchance to fully implement the original potential of that \r\nCharter.\r\nThis is a difficult challenge. International relations \r\nare clearly experiencing a lack of credibility. We regard \r\nthis as the main obstacle to practical progress towards \r\nthe establishment of universal foundations for equal \r\nand indivisible security, whether in the Euro-Atlantic \r\narea, Asia-Pacific region or other parts of the world. \r\nSuch a state of affairs clearly contradicts the concept \r\nof collective security embodied in the Charter and the \r\ndeep interdependence of the modern world, where most \r\nchallenges and threats are common to us all and have a \r\ncross-border dimension.\r\nStrengthening confidence and collective principles \r\nin international affairs, with the emphasis on \r\nnegotiating the pursuit of compromise solutions, would \r\nhelp substantially reduce the level of instability and \r\nmove forward in the settlement of crisis situations, not \r\nonly in the Middle East, but also with respect to Iran, \r\nAfghanistan, the Korean peninsula and other situations \r\nthroughout the world.\r\nThe final goal of the efforts to settle a conflict is \r\nto ensure the right to life and other fundamental human \r\nrights, be they political, economic or social. The events \r\nof recent years confirm that, without lasting peace and \r\nsustainable development, it is impossible to ensure \r\nhuman rights. In turn, the protection of human rights \r\nshould contribute to security and development, rather \r\nerosion would deprive the international community of \r\nan essential mechanism for developing joint approaches \r\nto the settlement of crisis situations.\r\nIt is appropriate to mention the compulsory \r\ninstruments at the disposal of the United Nations. Under \r\nthe United Nations Charter the imposition of sanctions \r\nfalls exclusively under the jurisdiction of the Security \r\nCouncil. Decisions must be made on a collegial basis, \r\nwith the understanding that sanctions should not lead \r\nto isolation of the State targeted for sanctions, but \r\nrather encourage it to engage in a dialogue to remove \r\nquestions that the Member States may have. It is \r\nessential that sanctions should be well-measured and \r\nthat they not cause any suffering to the population. In \r\nthe past the Security Council has discussed the issue of \r\nthe humanitarian limits of sanctions, but somehow the \r\ndiscussions have faded away. We believe it is important \r\nto resume them.\r\nAnother issue that needs to be discussed in the \r\nSecurity Council is the consequences of unilateral \r\nsanctions imposed by a State or a group of States \r\nsidestepping the United Nations to advance their \r\npolitical goals. We have no doubt that such sanctions, \r\nespecially when they are applied extraterritorially, \r\nweaken the unity of the international community \r\nand undermine the effectiveness of its efforts. For \r\nmany years, the commercial, economic and financial \r\nrestrictions imposed by the United States on Cuba \r\nhave remained an illustration of the negative impact \r\nof unilateral sanctions. Russia, together with the \r\noverwhelming majority of members of the international \r\ncommunity, calls for the swift lifting of the blockade, \r\nwhich is a relic of the Cold War.\r\nSpecial attention should be given to the practical \r\nenforcement of Security Council decisions regarding \r\nsanctions against non-State actors and illegal cross-\r\nborder formations. In general, the events of recent \r\nyears have clearly shown that unilateral action which \r\nviolates international law and circumvents or distorts \r\nthe decisions of the Security Council does no good.\r\nOf course, the legal norms of international affairs \r\nwill be further adjusted as necessary. But these \r\ntransformations should be treated with the greatest \r\nsense of responsibility and full consciousness of the \r\nserious risks involved. Consensus should be the sole \r\nroute to their adoption. Violations of international \r\nlaw should not be portrayed as some sort of creative \r\ndevelopment.\r\n12-52402 23\r\nA/67/PV.16\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now give \r\nthe f loor to His Excellency Mr. Thongloun Sisoulith, \r\nDeputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof the Lao People’s Democratic Republic.\r\nMr. Sisoulith (Lao People’s Democratic Republic): \r\nAt the outset, I would like to express my sincere \r\nappreciation to Mr. Vuk Jeremić upon his election \r\nto serve as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-seventh session. It is my firm belief that, with \r\nhis extensive experience and constructive initiatives, \r\nhe will guide the Assembly towards achieving its \r\nobjectives while serving the common interests of all its \r\nmembers.\r\nMay I also take this opportunity to extend my \r\nprofound congratulations to Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz \r\nAl-Nasser, President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-sixth session, on the successful discharge of his \r\nduties.\r\nLikewise, I would like to commend Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for tirelessly leading United \r\nNations efforts to meet its obligations and achieve its \r\nobjectives, as well as working to improve the overall \r\nworking methods of the United Nations.\r\nOver the past two years, the international \r\ncommunity has encountered complex challenges in \r\nall areas. Regional political complexity and unrest, \r\nespecially in the Middle East, seem unlikely to be \r\nresolved any time soon. The use of violence in any form, \r\nas seen in attacks on diplomatic compounds in Syria, \r\nis unacceptable to us. In addition, the global economic \r\nand financial crisis affecting all parts of the world has \r\nreached an alarming point, causing great concern for \r\nall nations, and even for the European Union — a major \r\neconomic force.\r\nSuch crises have challenged the capacity \r\nand credibility of the existing global governance \r\nmechanisms designed by the international community \r\nto address global challenges. This is a clear indication \r\nthat our joint efforts and actions have not yet produced \r\ntangible outcomes.\r\nNegotiations on climate change have shown no \r\nprogress, although the Kyoto Protocol is expiring this \r\nyear. Efforts to formulate an international instrument \r\nto govern arms trade and prevent illegal trading, \r\nwhich started some years ago, have also failed. There \r\nhas also been little commitment on the part of the \r\ndeveloped countries to help the most vulnerable groups \r\nthan serve as a pretext for illegal interference in the \r\ndomestic affairs of States.\r\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights states \r\nthat everyone is entitled to an international order in \r\nwhich their rights can be fully realized. Those who use \r\nmilitary force and sanctions, bypassing the Charter, \r\nengage in illicit supplies of arms, or provide cover for \r\nterrorists grossly violate this right.\r\nRussia stands for the implementation of the \r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights and respect for \r\nthe traditional values on which human civilization is \r\nbased and where all world religions converge. This is \r\na moral foundation of modern society. It is the cement \r\nthat bonds together nations and peoples. In recent \r\nyears, these values have been put to the test by displays \r\nof immorality, extremism and racial intolerance. Of \r\nsimilar concern are the even more assertive actions \r\nof those who, citing freedom of speech, condone the \r\nglorification of the Nazis and their accomplices and \r\ndesecrate the memory of the victims of the Second \r\nWorld War and the victors of fascism. Such actions are \r\nincompatible with the obligations of States under the \r\nCharter of the United Nations.\r\nLet me recall that the International Covenant \r\non Civil and Political Rights directly prohibits the \r\npropaganda of war and incitement of national and \r\nreligious discord. This means that freedom of speech \r\nand assembly cannot be used to justify the promotion \r\nof Nazi or other radical or extremist views, in violation \r\nof the basic principles and norms of international law.\r\nYesterday, the Human Rights Council endorsed a \r\nresolution proposed by Russia on the interrelation of \r\nhuman rights and traditional values. It is regrettable \r\nthat a number of Western States voted against this \r\ndocument, which is especially relevant today.\r\nProgress towards genuine partnership in \r\ninternational relations is possible only on the basis \r\nof equality and mutual respect. The course of events \r\nin the world leaves no alternative for anyone but to \r\njoin efforts in order to build a stable, equitable and \r\ndemocratic international system. It would be possible \r\nto resist this objective trend and try to preserve the old \r\norder for some time, but such resistance would cost yet \r\nmore lives, suffering and destruction. Let us display \r\nour vision and, instead of looking back at the history of \r\nprevious centuries, take the side of the events unfolding \r\nbefore us today, and answer the call for strong collective \r\nstatesmanship.\r\n24 12-52402\r\nA/67/PV.16\r\nDespite those achievements, the Lao People’s \r\nDemocratic Republic continues to face numerous \r\nchallenges and constraints. In addition to problems \r\nresulting from the global and regional economic crises, \r\nnatural calamities and the remnants of war, such \r\nas unexploded ordnance, continue to harm people’s \r\nlives and pose major obstacles to national social and \r\neconomic development, including the attainment of \r\nthe MDGs. In that regard, we call upon all countries to \r\nbecome party to the Convention on Cluster Munitions \r\nwith a view to fully banning the use of such weapons.\r\nThe Lao People’s Democratic Republic feels \r\nhonoured to be entrusted with hosting the 9th Asia-\r\nEurope Summit Meeting, which will be held on \r\n5 and 6 November in Vientiane, the capital of the Lao \r\nPeople’s Democratic Republic. That will provide a \r\ngreat opportunity for the leaders of Asia and Europe \r\nto discuss and exchange their views on global issues of \r\nmutual interest. \r\nThe international community wishes to see the \r\nrestoration of peace and stability in the Middle East. \r\nThe conflict between Israel and Palestine will not \r\nbe resolved without the full implementation of the \r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions supporting the \r\nestablishment of two States, Israel and Palestine, living \r\nside by side in peace. The Lao People’s Democratic \r\nRepublic reaffirms its support for the membership of \r\nPalestine to the United Nations.\r\nThe economic, financial and trade embargo \r\nimposed on the Republic of Cuba has long caused \r\nconsiderable hardship to the standard of living of the \r\nCuban people. That embargo must be unconditionally \r\nand immediately lifted.\r\nOwing to their geographical locations, the \r\nlandlocked developing countries are among the most \r\nvulnerable Members of the United Nations. The special \r\nchallenges and major development obstacles they face \r\nare the result of their great distance from world markets \r\nand high transit transport costs, which impede their \r\nnational sustainable development efforts. Each year, the \r\nlandlocked countries bear a heavy financial burden in the \r\neffort to improve their transit transport infrastructure \r\nnetwork in order to ensure that their export products, \r\nwhich constitute a crucial part of their national income, \r\nhave better access to world markets. Those problems \r\nare compounded when their national economies are \r\naffected by financial or social crises, natural disasters \r\nand climate change, inter alia. In addition, 50 per \r\nof countries: the least developed countries (LDCs), \r\nthe landlocked developing countries (LLDCs), and the \r\nsmall island developing States.\r\nIn the light of the current situation, it is more \r\ncrucial than ever to strengthen the United Nations, \r\nthe only universal Organization, in order to increase \r\nits effectiveness in addressing important global issues. \r\nTo that end, all Member States should strive to extend \r\ntheir full support and cooperation to revitalize the \r\nUnited Nations, finding a harmonious balance between \r\nnational and international interests in order to address \r\nthe enormous global challenges in a timely and effective \r\nmanner.\r\nIn the current context, regional organizations have \r\nplayed an increasingly important role in addressing \r\nthe global issues. In that connection, more and more \r\ncountries in the world now attach greater importance to \r\nthe Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) \r\nand the ever-expanding ASEAN-initiated cooperation \r\nframeworks. ASEAN is entering a crucial stage in \r\nimplementing its leaders’ commitment to establishing \r\nan ASEAN community comprised of three pillars — a \r\npolitical-security community, an economic community \r\nand a social-cultural community — by 2015. I firmly \r\nbelieve that, by utilizing its own resources combined \r\nwith external support, especially from its dialogue \r\npartners, ASEAN will be able to realize its ultimate \r\ngoal of becoming a community that is politically stable, \r\neconomically integrated and socially and culturally \r\nharmonious, thus contributing to the cause of peace and \r\nprosperity in the region and the world at large.\r\nAs a member of the international community, the \r\nLao People’s Democratic Republic has done its utmost \r\nto fulfil its international obligations by pursuing a \r\npolicy of cooperation with other countries based on the \r\nprinciples of equality, mutual benefit, and respect for \r\nthe principles of national independence, sovereignty \r\nand non-interference in each other’s internal affairs, \r\nthus building an international environment conducive \r\nto national development. \r\nOver the past year, despite numerous challenges, \r\nthe Lao People’s Democratic Republic has continued to \r\nenjoy political stability and social order. There has been \r\ngood progress in developing the national economy. That \r\nhas laid a solid foundation for attaining the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) by 2015 and created \r\nconditions conducive to the country’s graduation from \r\nleast developed country status by 2020.\r\n12-52402 25\r\nA/67/PV.16\r\nthe world we hope for. The outcome document, entitled \r\n“The future we want” (resolution 66/288, annex), \r\nmarks a substantial advancement for sustainable \r\ndevelopment. The task before us now is to capitalize on \r\nour achievements thus far and exert even greater effort \r\non follow-up actions such as developing sustainable \r\ndevelopment goals, strengthening the institutional \r\nframework and mobilizing finance.\r\nAs part of such endeavours, the Republic of Korea \r\nestablished the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI). \r\nSixteen countries signed the agreement to establish the \r\nGGGI on the margins of the Rio+20 meeting, and the \r\nInstitute will be launched as an international organization \r\nstarting in October. The GGGI will engage in a range of \r\nactivities for disseminating the green growth paradigm, \r\nin which the economy and the environment form a \r\nvirtuous cycle. Moreover, the Korean Government is \r\nprepared to step up its contribution to international \r\nefforts to achieve a sustainable future by hosting the \r\nsecretariat of the Green Climate Fund. The Republic of \r\nKorea stands ready to render wholehearted support for \r\nthe successful launch and stable operation of the Fund.\r\nThe Republic of Korea is keen on contributing \r\nto the balanced and harmonious development of the \r\ninternational community and is fully cooperating \r\nin such efforts in the context of the United Nations. \r\nThe Korean Government continues to increase its \r\nofficial development assistance to help achieve the \r\ninternationally agreed development goals, including \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. The Republic of \r\nKorea underscored the importance of inclusive growth \r\nand development partnership at the 2010 Seoul Summit \r\nof the Group of Twenty and the Fourth High-level \r\nForum on Aid Effectiveness, held in Busan in 2011. In \r\nJune, the Global Partnership for Effective Development \r\nCooperation was launched for the implementation of the \r\nBusan commitments. The Busan Forum and the launch \r\nof the Global Partnership will mark a turning point for \r\ninternational development cooperation by broadening \r\nour perspective from aid effectiveness to development \r\neffectiveness.\r\nOur own experience has taught us that investment \r\nin education is at the heart of effective development. \r\nIn that vein, we are confident that the Education First \r\ninitiative of the Secretary-General will, indeed, provide \r\na solid foundation for achieving the international \r\ndevelopment goals. The Korean Government extends \r\nits strong support for the initiative.\r\ncent of the LLDCs are also LDCs. I therefore urge the \r\ninternational community to devote greater attention and \r\nprovide assistance to that vulnerable group of countries \r\nthrough full implementation of the Almaty Programme \r\nof Action, as well as to play an active part in the 10-year \r\nreview of the implementation of the Almaty Programme \r\nof Action, to be held in 2014.\r\nThe Lao People’s Democratic Republic reiterates \r\nonce again its firm commitment and determination \r\nto continue working closely with the international \r\ncommunity to build a peaceful world under a just and \r\nmore democratic new order, based on cooperation with \r\nall countries in tackling the various global challenges \r\nfacing us. I am convinced that only through firm \r\ndetermination will we be able to achieve the immediate \r\nand long-term development objectives and ensure that \r\nthe world is secure, peaceful and prosperous. \r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Kim Sung-hwan, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs and Trade of the Republic of Korea.\r\nMr. Kim Sung-hwan (Republic of Korea): Allow \r\nme at the outset to express my sincere congratulations \r\nto Mr. Vuk Jeremić on his assumption of the presidency \r\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. I \r\nhave every confidence that under his able leadership \r\nthis session will be crowned with great success.\r\nHumankind continues to advance, drawing on our \r\ncollective wisdom to address challenges throughout \r\nhuman history. Although new global challenges to \r\nmankind such as climate change, poverty and disease, \r\nunderdevelopment, terrorism and proliferation of \r\nweapons of mass destruction are now testing the \r\ninternational community, I have no doubt that we will \r\novercome those challenges on our future path.\r\nThe United Nations, the symbol of our collective \r\nwisdom, should take greater responsibility in coping \r\nwith the challenges. I note with great satisfaction that \r\nthe United Nations is becoming a more accountable and \r\ntrusted international Organization under the prominent \r\nleadership of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. In that \r\nregard, I recognize and support the Secretary-General’s \r\nfive-year Action Agenda, which I believe will guide \r\nus in addressing current world challenges and onward \r\ntowards the future we are aiming for.\r\nThe United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (Rio+20), held in June in Rio de Janeiro, \r\nrepresented a critical step forward towards ushering in \r\n26 12-52402\r\nA/67/PV.16\r\nBoth a sound historical consciousness and a \r\nheartfelt soul-searching into any past wrongdoings are \r\nrequired in order to establish solid peace and stability \r\nbetween nations. A country’s true valour is proven when \r\nit confronts the dark side of its history and endeavours \r\nto rectify past wrongdoings.\r\nIt is the firm conviction of the Korean Government \r\nthat respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty \r\nas enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, \r\nshould be the guiding principle for stable international \r\nrelations. \r\nNo country should abuse international legal \r\nprocedures or the concept of the rule of law in order to \r\ninfringe upon the territorial integrity and sovereignty \r\nof other countries or distort historical justice.\r\nThe Republic of Korea is actively contributing \r\nto the global efforts being undertaken in pursuit of a \r\nworld without nuclear weapons. The Seoul Nuclear \r\nSecurity Summit held last March brought together \r\nleaders from across the world to galvanize the vision \r\nand the determination of the international community \r\nto achieve a peaceful world without nuclear terrorism. \r\nDuring the Summit, the Korean Government played a \r\nleading role in forging a consensus to take important \r\npractical steps, such as the substantial reduction of \r\nnuclear materials, the promotion of the universality of \r\ninternational conventions and cooperation to combat \r\nillicit trafficking of nuclear materials. I am delighted \r\nthat the High-level Meeting on Countering Nuclear \r\nTerrorism, which was convened this morning, has \r\nprovided new momentum to further energize the efforts \r\nseen at the Seoul Summit for the prevention of nuclear \r\nand radiological terrorism. \r\nFurthermore, existing and emerging threats \r\nin cyberspace, such as rampant transnational \r\ncybercrime and potential cyber conflicts, present \r\na serious challenge. It is therefore imperative that \r\nthe international community address those threats. \r\nBy hosting the 2013 Conference on Cyberspace, the \r\nRepublic of Korea hopes to contribute in multiple ways \r\nto the ongoing global efforts to maximize the benefits \r\nof digital networks. We further believe that the event \r\nwill provide an unparalleled opportunity to pool our \r\nefforts to cope with threats stemming from the misuse \r\nof information and communication technologies.\r\nThe North Korean nuclear programme continues \r\nto pose a threat, not only to the security of the \r\nKorean peninsula and North-East Asia, but indeed to \r\nThe Republic of Korea is also taking an active part \r\nin the discussions on shaping the post-2015 development \r\nframework. We fully recognize the importance of a \r\ncomprehensive approach that takes into account the \r\neconomic, social and environmental dimensions of \r\nsustainable development.\r\nThe aspiration for human rights, fundamental \r\nfreedoms and democratic values is the primary driving \r\nforce for the advancement of humanity. Today, many \r\ncountries have been striving to advocate human rights \r\nin tandem with democracy. The United Nations, as the \r\nepicentre of the international community’s efforts to \r\npromote and protect human rights, has provided timely \r\nassistance to such countries.\r\nRecently, we witnessed the strong desire of people \r\nin the Middle East and North Africa to realize their \r\naspirations for democracy and respect for human \r\nrights. The recent positive developments in Myanmar \r\nare also well worth noting in that regard. However, \r\nwhile those changes are still unfolding, enormous \r\nchallenges and difficulties still lie ahead. In Syria, a \r\ngreat number of civilians have been killed and gross \r\nviolations of human rights have been witnessed. With \r\nhigh hopes towards the efforts of Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, \r\nthe Joint Special Representative of the United Nations \r\nand the League of Arab States for Syria, the Korean \r\nGovernment will stand by the Syrian people through \r\nthis time of suffering together with the international \r\ncommunity.\r\nThe Korean Government expresses deep concern \r\nat the recent attacks against diplomats and diplomatic \r\nmissions in several places. Such violence cannot be \r\njustified regardless of the motivation.\r\nPutting an end to sexual violence against women \r\nin armed conflict is another issue that warrants serious \r\nattention. Wartime sexual violence is a fundamental \r\ninfringement of human rights and is, in fact, an affront to \r\nhuman dignity and integrity. History has left important \r\nlessons that warn against such egregious acts.\r\nThe Republic of Korea would like to urge the \r\nUnited Nations system and all Member States to do \r\ntheir utmost to put an end to such atrocities, not only \r\nby taking all measures to protect women and girls in \r\narmed conflict, but also by providing effective remedies \r\nand reparations for victims and ending impunity by \r\nbringing the offenders to justice in accordance with the \r\nrelevant resolutions of the United Nations.\r\n12-52402 27\r\nA/67/PV.16\r\nPrince Abdulaziz bin Abdullah (Saudi Arabia) \r\n(spoke in Arabic): At the outset, it gives me great pleasure \r\nto convey to Mr. Vuk Jeremić my sincere congratulations \r\non his election as President of the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-seventh session. We wish him every success \r\nin the performance of his duties and responsibilities, \r\nparticularly under the current critical circumstances \r\nin which the international community finds itself at \r\npresent. I would also take this opportunity to express \r\nmy deep gratitude and appreciation to his predecessor, \r\nAmbassador Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, President of \r\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session, who \r\nfulfilled his mandate with wisdom and professionalism. \r\nMoreover, it gives me pleasure to commend once more \r\nthe great efforts of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in \r\nserving the Organization and promoting its message \r\naimed at achieving international peace and security, \r\nespecially under difficult and critical circumstances. \r\nThe Palestinian issue, which is at the core of the \r\nArab-Israeli conflict, has been a constant challenge \r\nfor the United Nations since its inception more than \r\n60 years ago. The cause of the stalemate is Israel’s \r\nattitude. We all know how intransigent Israel has been \r\nin its positions, which have undermined negotiations \r\nand have emptied all discussions of any meaning. \r\nMoreover, Israel has taken unilateral actions that could \r\nlead to more complications in the occupied Palestinian \r\nterritories and to undermining the efforts of Arab \r\ncountries and others in the international community \r\nto reach a just, comprehensive and lasting solution by \r\nestablishing an independent, viable and contiguous \r\nPalestinian State, with Jerusalem as its capital. \r\nThe situation requires that the international \r\ncommunity, as represented by the United Nations, \r\nmove quickly in order to put an end to the calamity that \r\nthe situation represents for the Palestinian people and \r\nprovide all manner of support and assistance for the \r\nPalestinian Authority. My country finds that Palestine \r\nmust receive full membership in the United Nations, as \r\nthat is its natural and legitimate right, and we should all \r\nhelp the Palestinians to achieve that objective. For its \r\npart, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is sparing no effort \r\nin fulfilling its commitment to the peace process with \r\nrespect to our Palestinian brethren by providing various \r\ntypes of support and assistance. \r\nThe issue of Syria is a very complex and exacerbated \r\none and has led to the killing and displacement of tens \r\nof thousands of people. The international community \r\nhas shown its inability to act, because of divisions in \r\nthe very basis of the international non-proliferation \r\nregime. As long as the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea continues to pursue its nuclear and missile \r\nprogrammes, achieving the goal of sustainable peace \r\non the Korean peninsula and in the region will remain \r\nfar off. Unfortunately, the international community’s \r\naspirations were shattered once again when the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea launched a \r\nlong-range missile in April 2012. In response to that \r\nprovocative action, the Security Council reaffirmed \r\nthat the international community will not tolerate the \r\ncontinued pursuit by the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea of its nuclear and missile programmes by \r\nissuing a firm and resolute presidential statement in an \r\nunprecedentedly swift manner (S/PRST/2012/13).\r\nWe urge with concern that the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea should take concrete measures aimed \r\nat denuclearization, which will also open an avenue to \r\nimproving the livelihood of its people. At the same \r\ntime, we sincerely hope that the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea will listen to the international \r\ncommunity’s call for the improvement of that country’s \r\nhuman rights situation, as repeatedly affirmed in the \r\nrelevant United Nations resolutions.\r\nAs a country that has risen from the ashes of war, \r\nwe have learned the values of peace and security. In \r\nthat context, we earnestly hope to have the opportunity \r\nto promote such values by serving as a non-permanent \r\nmember of the Security Council for the 2013-2014 term. \r\nThe Republic of Korea is determined to fulfil that role \r\nwith the greatest enthusiasm and devotion. We hope \r\nthat States Members of the United Nations understand \r\nand support our bid for membership in the Council.\r\nWe are united by the ideals set out in the United \r\nNations Charter. In pursuit of international peace \r\nand security, the continued promotion of social and \r\neconomic development and the promotion of human \r\nrights, we should embrace a spirit of cooperation and \r\ntolerance, with the United Nations at the centre of \r\ninternational efforts to that end. The Republic of Korea \r\nwill persist in fully playing its part in the invaluable \r\nwork of the United Nations, taking on the various \r\nchallenges that humanity will continue to confront. \r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now call \r\non His Royal Highness Prince Abdulaziz bin Abdullah, \r\nVice-Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of \r\nSaudi Arabia.\r\n28 12-52402\r\nA/67/PV.16\r\nwith IAEA inspectors monitoring its nuclear facilities \r\nin order to put an end to the crisis.\r\nIn that regard, Saudi Arabia reaffirms the \r\nimportance of making the Middle East a zone free \r\nfrom nuclear weapons and all other weapons of mass \r\ndestruction. We also stress the need for Israel to place \r\nits nuclear facilities under the international inspection \r\nand safeguards of the IAEA and to sign the Treaty on \r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. \r\nThe security and stability of the Arab Gulf region \r\nwill be reached only through the establishment of \r\ngood relations based on good-neighbourliness and \r\nconstructive cooperation. Also, Iran must end its \r\noccupation of the three islands belonging to the United \r\nArab Emirates. We must solve that issue peacefully, \r\neither through bilateral negotiations or by referring the \r\nissue to the International Court of Justice.\r\nThe phenomenon of terrorism is one of the most \r\nimportant challenges that we currently face and the most \r\nimportant issue confronting the entire international \r\ncommunity. We must eliminate terrorism in all its forms \r\nand sources. In order to fight that scourge and uproot \r\nit completely, the efforts of the Kingdom have not \r\nbeen limited to fighting it locally. We have reinforced \r\nefforts at all levels, whether regional or international, \r\nincluding by hosting an international conference in \r\n2005 that resulted in many recommendations, including \r\nthe establishment of the United Nations Counter-\r\nTerrorism Centre, which was launched in New York on \r\n19 September 2011.\r\nOur world today urgently needs to spread the \r\nculture of tolerance and understanding and dialogue \r\nbetween the followers of different religions. Our \r\nefforts in that regard are led by the Custodian of the \r\nTwo Holy Mosques, King Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz \r\nAl-Saud, aimed at achieving a dialogue between \r\nreligions and cultures. That was reflected in the 2008 \r\nWorld Conference on Dialogue, held in Madrid. There \r\nwas also a call for a high-level meeting hosted by the \r\nUnited Nations to promote dialogue and tolerance \r\nbetween different cultures and religions. Our call for \r\nmutual understanding, the acceptance of others and \r\ncoexistence has led to the establishment in Vienna of the \r\nKing Abdullah bin Abdulaziz International Centre for \r\nDialogue among Followers of Religions and Cultures. \r\nIn addition, the foresight of the Custodian of the Two \r\nHoly Mosques was demonstrated by his announcement \r\nof the establishment of a centre for dialogue among \r\nthe Security Council and because of the failure of all \r\nArab and international initiatives as a result of the \r\nintransigence of the Syrian regime, which still believes \r\nthat it can use the power of its security apparatus to \r\nend the crisis without taking into account the high \r\nhumanitarian cost. \r\nSince the first day of the crisis, my country has \r\nbeen dealing with it in accordance with the framework \r\nand resolutions of international legitimacy and with \r\nfull respect for the principles of human rights and \r\ninternational humanitarian law, through the Gulf \r\nCooperation Council, the League of Arab States, the \r\nUnited Nations and the outcomes of the Organization \r\nof Islamic Cooperation summit meeting, held in Mecca \r\nin August, on the status of Syria. \r\nThe success of Joint Special Representative Lakhdar \r\nBrahimi’s efforts will depend on the implementation of \r\na new strategy and a clear plan that aims at achieving a \r\npeaceful transition of power. The Security Council must \r\nprovide him with the support he needs to deal with the \r\nSyrian crisis at both the political and the humanitarian \r\nlevels.\r\nWe call upon our brothers in Yemen to continue to \r\ntake the same positive and constructive approach and to \r\nstand against any foreign interference in their internal \r\naffairs in order to achieve security and stability and \r\neconomic development throughout Yemen. Meanwhile, \r\nwe call upon the international community to fulfil its \r\npledges to Yemen by providing it with all forms of \r\nsupport and assistance to achieve those goals. Saudi \r\nArabia reaffirms its full support for all international \r\nefforts undertaken in that context. We hosted the donors’ \r\nconference, held earlier this month, and participated \r\nin the Friends of Yemen conference held at the United \r\nNations on 27 September 2012.\r\nThe Iranian nuclear crisis is one of the most \r\nimportant challenges threatening international peace \r\nand security in general and the security and stability \r\nof the Arab Gulf region in particular. In that context, \r\nmy country supports the ongoing efforts of the five \r\nplus one group to peacefully resolve the crisis in a \r\nmanner that guarantees Iran and all countries in the \r\nregion the right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy, \r\nin accordance with the criteria and procedures of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and \r\nunder its supervision. On the other hand, we urge \r\nIran to respond to those efforts and to implement the \r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions by cooperating \r\n12-52402 29\r\nA/67/PV.16\r\ninstitutions in order to build a global economic system \r\nthat is based on a new partnership between developing \r\nand developed countries. That partnership should \r\nbe established on the basis of cooperation, justice, \r\nequality, transparency and mutual benefits. \r\nConcerning energy security, the Kingdom of Saudi \r\nArabia has spared no effort in the pursuit of stability in \r\nthe world oil markets in a manner that has served the \r\ndevelopment and growth of the global economy. In that \r\nregard, we cannot ignore the fact that energy security \r\nis not limited to the security of supply, but includes the \r\nsecurity of demand as well. My country believes that \r\nthere should be a dialogue between energy producers and \r\nconsumers in order to avoid volatility and speculation \r\nin prices, and to avoid imposing discriminatory taxes \r\non oil. We welcome the establishment of the Secretariat \r\nof the International Energy Forum headquarters in \r\nRiyadh in order to promote such dialogue. \r\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, as one of the United \r\nNations founding countries, has since its inception \r\nparticipated in its meetings and conferences on the \r\nbasis of its belief in the Organization’s noble principles \r\nand the role it can play in service to humanity and its \r\nadvancement.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reaffirm that the \r\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia will be at the vanguard of \r\nany international efforts aimed at implementing and \r\nachieving the principles and purposes of the United \r\nNations and achieving the security, stability and \r\nprosperity to which we all aspire.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.35 p.m.\r\nIslamic sects at the fourth special session of the Islamic \r\nSummit Conference, held in Mecca in August 2012.\r\nIn that regard, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia \r\nstrongly condemns the production by an irresponsible \r\ngroup of an offensive movie about the Prophet \r\nMuhammad — peace be upon him. The Kingdom \r\nasserts its rejection of all acts that offend or disdain \r\nreligions and their sacred symbols. In that context, the \r\nKingdom renews its call to enact the necessary laws \r\nand legislation that forbid the defamation and disdain \r\nof religions and their sacred symbols.\r\nMeanwhile, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia \r\ncondemns the acts of violence against the United States \r\nforeign missions and any attack against any foreign or \r\ndiplomatic mission around the world for any reason, \r\nregardless of the disagreement involved. Such acts \r\nprevent missions from carrying out their diplomatic \r\nfunctions and international interests. \r\nIn the light of the ongoing discussion on the question \r\nof global economic, social and human development, the \r\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia, through its participation \r\nin the Group of Twenty, emphasizes its support of \r\nthe efforts aiming to stabilize the global economy, to \r\nadvance world trade, to take further action to liberalize \r\ntrade and to avoid protectionist policies that impede the \r\nefforts to end the global financial crisis. Meanwhile, \r\nwe should not ignore the matter of helping developing \r\nStates to overcome the consequences of that crisis.\r\nFurthermore, my country believes that efforts \r\nto reform the international financial, monetary and \r\ntrade system should be channelled through existing \r\n"
