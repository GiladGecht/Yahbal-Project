That was a time when \r\ncomputers had barely been invented. The Internet \r\nwas decades away. And it was not always easy for \r\nthe representatives at that founding conference in \r\nSan Francisco to establish contact with their faraway \r\ncapitals for instructions that might be needed. \r\nThese days, we have instant access to the global \r\ninformation network. Tweets are being written as I \r\nspeak. There are more connected devices than there are \r\npeople in the world, and development is accelerating in \r\nevery respect. In 2012, we who are gathered here have \r\nall become representatives of the connected nations of \r\nthe world. But, connectivity also carries risks, as we \r\nsaw recently in our interconnected financial system,\r\nRecently, we also all followed with horror and \r\ndisbelief the fact that an odious film clip posted \r\nsomewhere on YouTube could lead to outrage and deadly \r\nviolence 10,000 miles away. But the opportunities \r\ncreated by connectivity are vastly more important \r\nthan the risks. Globalization, marked by more open \r\nsocieties in a more open world and facilitated by the \r\nenormous advances of science and technology, has \r\nbeen an incredible force for good. Mobile banking \r\nbrings financial services to East Africans. Skype \r\nreinforces messages from the Arab street. Virtual \r\nmarketplaces unleash entrepreneurial talent. More \r\ncontact, more movement and more trade — a more \r\nopen world — have already lifted hundreds of millions \r\nof people out of poverty and despair, and more is \r\ncertain to come.\r\nIn this world of connected nations, people around \r\nthe globe, including tens of thousands of Swedes of \r\nSyrian origin, are following the tragedy unfolding in \r\nDamascus, Aleppo and Homs with intense concern. We \r\nhave all been reminded of a simple truth — violence \r\nis easy to start but very difficult to stop. What began \r\nas a popular protest has now turned into a civil war, \r\nwhich, if unchecked, brings the risk of sectarian \r\nfragmentation across the wider region. We must do \r\neverything possible to prevent that from happening. \r\nWe call on the divided Security Council to put global \r\nresponsibilities above narrow national interests. In the \r\nstrongest possible terms, we urge the Al-Assad regime \r\nto stop killing its own people and start respecting its \r\nobligations as a Member of the United Nations. And \r\nwe remind those responsible for deadly violence and \r\nabuse that they should rest assured that they will be \r\nheld accountable one day.\r\nUnited Nations A/67/PV.17\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-seventh session\r\n17th plenary meeting\r\nFriday, 28 September 2012, 6 p.m.\r\nNew York\r\nOffi cial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Jeremić . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Serbia)\r\n2 12-52408\r\nA/67/PV.17\r\nThere is no alternative to a political solution. \r\nTogether with our European partners, we offer our \r\nfull support to the Joint Special Representative, \r\nMr. Lakhdar Brahimi. Syria is a society that is rich \r\nin culture, history and traditions. Damascus is one of \r\nthe oldest continually inhabited cities in our world. To \r\npreserve and protect the mosaic that Syria represents \r\nis vital to its future, and, I would argue, to all of our \r\nfutures.\r\nBut we must also help those now so tragically \r\naffected by what is happening. A thousand people are \r\nbeing killed every week, according to the latest reports \r\nwe are receiving. We are witnessing an enormous human \r\ntragedy. More than 2.5 million people are in need of \r\nhumanitarian help. More than a million people have \r\nbeen displaced inside Syria, and there are a quarter of \r\na million refugees in the region as a direct consequence \r\nof the current crisis. The regime must give unhindered \r\naccess for assistance to the displaced and suffering, and \r\nthe countries that have generously opened their borders \r\nshould be commended and supported. Sweden, which \r\nis one of the world’s largest humanitarian donors, has \r\ncontributed massively, and we stand ready to further \r\nincrease our support here and elsewhere around the \r\nworld where people in need are suffering.\r\nIn this world of connected nations, the human \r\nrights of every child, woman and man are a matter of \r\nconcern for us all. Protecting and promoting human \r\nrights is one of the central duties of the international \r\ncommunity. Not only is that a question of protecting \r\nindividual human beings — their life, their freedom, \r\ntheir future — but it is also crucial to promoting peace, \r\nstability and prosperity around the globe. And critical \r\nto those efforts is working for gender equality and the \r\nempowerment of women, because it is right, because it \r\nis smart and because it is fundamental to realizing the \r\neconomic and political potential of society.\r\nSweden, the largest financial contributor to \r\nthe work of the Office of the United Nations High \r\nCommissioner for Human Rights today, is a candidate \r\nfor a seat on the Human Rights Council for the period \r\n2013-2015. As a Council member, Sweden would be \r\nan active and reliable partner. We would work with \r\neveryone who shares our conviction, reach out to those \r\nwho disagree and support those who need it. But in that \r\narea as well, we must adjust to the world of connectivity. \r\nThe human rights and fundamental freedoms enshrined \r\nin the Universal Declaration of Human Rights must \r\napply in the modern world of today. Sweden will take \r\nevery opportunity to champion freedom of expression \r\nonline and the immense development potential that is \r\nvested in the Internet and all of the new communication \r\ntechnologies. Earlier this year, the Human Rights \r\nCouncil decided that the rights that apply offline apply \r\nonline as well, and called on all States to promote \r\nand facilitate access to the Internet. That landmark \r\nresolution (Human Rights Council resolution 20/8) was \r\nunanimously adopted in Geneva, and I hope that it has \r\nbeen duly noted here in New York as well. The fight for \r\nfreedom on the Internet is the new front line in the fight \r\nfor freedom in the world.\r\nIn this world of connected nations, we share a planet \r\nwith common development challenges. The world’s \r\npoor — indeed, all of us — need development that is \r\ninclusive, equitable and sustainable. The international \r\ncommunity has met three of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals well ahead of time, but we are \r\nlagging significantly behind in others. And while we \r\naccelerate efforts to reduce child mortality and improve \r\nmaternal health, we have started to look beyond the \r\nimmediate future. Sweden welcomes the high-level \r\npanel on the post-2015 development agenda and looks \r\nforward to contributing to its recommendations.\r\nIn Rio, world leaders recently launched a process \r\nfor working towards sustainable development goals. \r\nIt is up to all of us to take that agenda forward: to \r\ninvolve scientists and business, to explore the potential \r\nof information and communications technology and \r\ninnovation, to pursue all three dimensions of sustainable \r\ndevelopment and to ensure that democracy and human \r\nrights are part of the equation. And as an active partner \r\nand a major donor, Sweden will certainly do its part.\r\nIn this world of connected nations, geography is \r\nsometimes of little consequence. Distances might at \r\ntimes seem enormous. But the melting Arctic ice cap \r\nin the North can pose an existential threat to small \r\nisland States in the South. The Arctic today is warming \r\ntwice as fast as the global average. And right now as \r\nwe gather here, the Arctic Sea ice cover has receded \r\nso much that it has reached a new historical minimum. \r\nThere is less ice this autumn in the Arctic than ever \r\nbefore in recorded history.\r\nThe impact of climate change is global. The world \r\nis not on track for keeping the increase in global \r\naverage temperatures to below two degrees Celsius. \r\nWe therefore urgently need progress in the negotiations \r\nunder the United Nations Framework Convention on \r\n12-52408 3\r\nA/67/PV.17\r\nAl Nahyan, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the United \r\nArab Emirates.\r\nSheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al Nahyan (United \r\nArab Emirates) (spoke in Arabic): At the outset, I would \r\nlike to congratulate Mr. Vuk Jeremić on his election \r\nas President of the General Assembly at its sixty-\r\nseventh session. I am confident that his experience in \r\ninternational affairs will enable him to guide the work \r\nof this session wisely and ably, and I wish him every \r\nsuccess in his task.\r\nI would also like to commend his predecessor, \r\nAmbassador Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, for his \r\nsuccessful and prudent leadership of the sixty-sixth \r\nsession of the General Assembly, and to commend the \r\ngreat efforts made by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \r\nand pay tribute to his tireless efforts and the role of this \r\ninternational Organization in promoting international \r\npeace, security and development.\r\nSecurity and stability in the Arab Gulf region are a \r\nhigh priority for all of us. Our balanced policies are based \r\non the principles of the Charter of the United Nations \r\nand the provisions of international law, especially those \r\ncalling for peaceful coexistence, confidence-building, \r\ngood neighbourliness, mutual respect, non-interference \r\nin the internal affairs of other States, and pursuing \r\npeaceful means in resolving conflicts and disputes.\r\nOn the basis of those principles, my Government \r\nexpresses, once again, its regret regarding the \r\ncontinued Iranian occupation of our three islands: \r\nAbu Musa, Greater Tunb and Lesser Tunb. We demand \r\nthe restoration of the United Arab Emirates’ full \r\nsovereignty over those islands. We emphasize that all \r\nactions and measures taken by Iran are null and void, \r\nand are in contravention of international law and all \r\nnorms and universal human values.\r\nThe events unfolding in Syria are for us a cause \r\nfor great sadness. They have gone beyond all limits \r\nand norms. The United Arab Emirates is closely, and \r\nwith great concern, following the policies of violence, \r\nkilling, displacement and expulsion being pursued by \r\nthe Syrian regime against its people, which regime \r\nhas lost all its legitimacy. We therefore call upon the \r\ninternational community to consider with seriousness \r\nand firmness what is happening to our Syrian brothers \r\nand to shoulder its humanitarian responsibilities. \r\nWe see it as our duty to stop those atrocities against \r\nthe peaceful Syrian people. We are convinced that a \r\nClimate Change and effective implementation of the \r\nglobally agreed outcomes. Sweden calls on everyone in \r\nthis Hall to do their utmost to contribute to ensuring \r\nthat that occurs, and developed nations should take the \r\nlead.\r\nThere are severe challenges, but there are also great \r\nopportunities. Technology brings new possibilities — to \r\nreduce emissions, increase growth, and  move towards \r\na truly sustainable future. As the current Chair of the \r\nArctic Council — comprising the eight nations whose \r\nlandmass extends beyond the Arctic Circle — Sweden \r\nwill make its contribution. Together, we will set an \r\nexample of positive cooperation in an area drawing \r\nrapidly increasing global attention and where, not long \r\nago, many were predicting competition and conflict.\r\nWe live in a new era. What happens in the Levant, \r\nthe Arctic or elsewhere has immediate implications \r\nfor us all. In order to deal with the challenges of this \r\nera, the connected nations of this world need a strong \r\nUnited Nations — a United Nations to discuss the \r\nissues of today and to truly seize the opportunities for \r\ncollective action in order to shape a better tomorrow; a \r\nUnited Nations where we convene in these days to say \r\nthat, while ridiculing what by others is held sacred is \r\nmean and offensive, it can never be used as an excuse \r\nfor violence, destruction and death.\r\nBut the United Nations — our United \r\nNations — needs to step up to the challenge. The \r\nSecurity Council must assume its responsibilities, in \r\nSyria and elsewhere. Member States must empower the \r\nUnited Nations to become better at conflict prevention \r\nand peacebuilding, and ensure that it can deliver \r\ndevelopment results effectively and as one.\r\nIt is up to us, the Member States, to meet our \r\ninternational human rights obligations, not just in order \r\nto protect the individual human being, but because \r\nrespect for human rights is also, as we have bitterly \r\nlearned throughout history, critical to peace and \r\nsecurity.\r\nIn these times of accelerating global change, with its \r\ngreat risks and even greater opportunities, Sweden will \r\nremain a steadfast member of this global Organization \r\nand, together with our partners in the European Union, \r\nwe will continue to promote an effective multilateral \r\nsystem with the United Nations at its core.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now give \r\nthe f loor to His Highness Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed \r\n4 12-52408\r\nA/67/PV.17\r\nsolution to the crisis can be achieved only through an \r\norderly transition of power.\r\nThat severe humanitarian crisis requires us \r\nto support the people of Syria, in particular the \r\nrefugees. The United Arab Emirates has shouldered \r\nits responsibilities and obligations towards the Syrian \r\nrefugees in Turkey and Jordan and will continue to do \r\nso by providing relief. We urge all States to contribute \r\nto such humanitarian efforts.\r\nThe Middle East holds great importance for us, \r\nand we believe that peace and stability will never be \r\nachieved in that region until the Arab-Israeli conflict \r\nis resolved. That is the central and vital issue to the \r\npeople of the entire region, and reaching a just solution \r\nis the key for bringing peace and stability to the whole \r\narea. It cannot be realized without putting an end to \r\nthe Israeli occupation of the Palestinian and Arab \r\nterritories through Israel’s withdrawal to the lines \r\nof 4 June 1967, including from East Jerusalem, the \r\noccupied Syrian Golan Heights and the remaining \r\noccupied Lebanese territories. The achievement of a \r\njust and comprehensive peace must be carried out in \r\naccordance with resolutions of international legitimacy, \r\nthe principle of land for peace, the Arab Peace Initiative \r\nand the establishment of an independent Palestinian \r\nState, with East Jerusalem as its capital.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates welcomes the \r\nconsiderable progress achieved in the political process \r\nin Somalia through the completion of the transitional \r\nphase, the convening of the Constituent Assembly, \r\nthe adoption of the Constitution of Somalia and the \r\nelection of Mr. Hassan Sheikh Mohamud as the new \r\nPresident of Somalia. We also reaffirm our support \r\nfor the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political \r\nindependence of Somalia, and look forward to working \r\nwith its Government towards achieving security and \r\nstability and countering piracy in a region of such \r\nvital importance, not only with respect to oil and gas \r\ntransport but also to the world economy in general.\r\nIn the United Arab Emirates, we remain committed \r\nto supporting the security and stability of Afghanistan \r\nand confirm the continuation of our humanitarian and \r\ndevelopmental support to that distressed country. In \r\nthat context, we welcome the outcome of the donors \r\nconference that was held in Tokyo, with the hope that \r\nthe pledges announced at the conference will contribute \r\nto the process of the reconstruction of Afghanistan. As \r\nwe approach the year 2014 and the commitment for \r\nmilitary withdrawal from Afghanistan and for turning \r\nthe country over to its people and Government, we \r\naspire to see an Afghanistan that is free from terrorism, \r\nextremism and violence. \r\nAt the same time, the United Arab Emirates \r\nexpresses its deep concern over the violence against \r\nthe Rohingya Muslim community in Myanmar and \r\ncalls upon the international community to urge the \r\nGovernment of Myanmar to cease all acts incompatible \r\nwith the principles of fundamental human rights.\r\nWe reaffirm our commitment to all requirements of \r\nnuclear non-proliferation and renew our support for the \r\nefforts aimed at designating the region of the Middle \r\nEast, including the Arab Gulf region, a zone free of \r\nweapons of mass destruction — especially the Arab \r\nGulf region. In that context, we must also call upon \r\nIsrael to join the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons and subject all of its nuclear facilities \r\nto the comprehensive safeguards regime. \r\nIn that regard, we urge the Islamic Republic of Iran \r\nto fully cooperate with the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency in implementing its international commitments \r\nin order to dispel all fears and suspicions surrounding \r\nits nuclear programme. We look forward to a peaceful \r\nsolution to that crisis, ensuring that our region remains \r\nfree of tension and conflict, while guaranteeing the \r\ntransparency and peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear \r\nprogramme.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates began in 2009 to develop \r\na nuclear energy programme for peaceful uses in order \r\nto meet the country’s growing demand for energy and to \r\nsupport economic development projects. It ensured that \r\nthe programme’s rules and regulations were based on \r\nthe highest standards of sustained safety and security \r\nmeasures and principles of nuclear non-proliferation. \r\nI take the opportunity to call upon the States of the \r\nregion to draw on the experience of the United Arab \r\nEmirates in that field and to study the standards of \r\ntransparency, technology, safety and security upon \r\nwhich the programme is based.\r\nWe would like to emphasize the importance of \r\naddressing the implications of climate change, which \r\ninvolves developing renewable energy technologies to \r\nachieve sustainable development and providing clean \r\nenergy for developing countries, which are among \r\nthe goals advocated by the United Arab Emirates in \r\noffering various types of humanitarian and development \r\nassistance.\r\n12-52408 5\r\nA/67/PV.17\r\nThe United Arab Emirates reiterates its firm \r\ncondemnation of all acts of terrorism, illicit trafficking \r\nin drugs and arms and human trafficking, as well as \r\norganized crime, which are interlinked phenomena that \r\nfeed into each other. It reaffirms its resolve to continue \r\ncooperating with international and multilateral efforts \r\naiming at the total elimination of those negative \r\nphenomena, which pose a direct threat to international \r\npeace and security. \r\nThe United Arab Emirates has announced the \r\nestablishment of the International Centre of Excellence \r\nfor Countering Violent Extremism, in collaboration with \r\nseveral influential friends and actors, which will begin \r\nits work in Abu Dhabi at the end of the year. Moderation \r\nand tolerance are the basic principles guiding our \r\npolitical orientation and represent lofty values to the \r\ncitizens of the United Arab Emirates and to society as \r\na whole. In that sense, the United Arab Emirates has \r\nbeen and will remain committed to moderation in its \r\napproach, and accepts other communities as part of a \r\ndiverse world built on mutual respect. Those are the \r\nhuman values that have formed our convictions with \r\nregard to many issues, such as counterterrorism, human \r\nrights, the empowerment of women and coexistence \r\namong peoples and religious sects.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates emphasizes the \r\nimportance of consolidating the values of tolerance, \r\nmoderation and respect for religions, as well as the \r\nimportance of protecting religions against defamation \r\nand contempt and stresses the need to develop the \r\nnecessary legislation in that regard. I must condemn, \r\nin the strongest possible terms, abuses against Islam, \r\nas freedom of expression should not be allowed to \r\nundermine any religion or belief, whatsoever. We also \r\ncondemn all violent reactions to any such abuse.\r\nTerrorism poses a challenge to international peace \r\nand security and leads to violating the human rights \r\nof ordinary people by depriving them of the right \r\nto live in peace and prosperity. In that context and \r\nbased on our commitment to the principles of human \r\nrights, the United Arab Emirates renews its support of \r\ninternational efforts aimed at ensuring peace, security \r\nand prosperity for all the peoples of the world, and \r\nlooks forward to expanding its engagement in that area.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates has also been focusing \r\nits efforts on reducing gender discrimination. \r\nTherefore, we look forward to playing an active role \r\nin the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and \r\nthe Empowerment of Women, based on our successful \r\nnational experience in empowering the women of \r\nthe United Arab Emirates, who actively participate \r\nin managing the affairs of the State as well as the \r\ncommunity.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to appeal to all \r\nMember States to support the quest of the United Arab \r\nEmirates to host World Expo 2020 in Dubai under the \r\nslogan “Connecting Minds, Creating the Future”. We \r\nlook forward to receiving the support necessary to \r\nstrengthen my country’s candidacy, particularly since it \r\nis the first time that the event will be held in the Middle \r\nEast, North Africa and South Asia region.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now call \r\non His Excellency Mr. José Badia, Minister for External \r\nRelations and for Economic Affairs and International \r\nFinances of the Principality of Monaco.\r\nMr. Badia (Monaco) (spoke in French): The \r\nSecretary-General has shared with us the priorities that \r\nhe plans to implement during the sixty-seventh session \r\nof the General Assembly. His warning concerning \r\nthe multiplicity of new threats and his clear-sighted \r\nrecognition of their interconnections should inspire and \r\nguide our work.\r\nThe maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity — need it be said again — are the very \r\nessence of the mission of our Organization. What \r\ndo we see before us? Crises and threats to peace and \r\nsecurity are multiplying and are often even mutually \r\nreinforcing, along with the endangerment of human \r\nrights. What global vision do we share of the challenges \r\nthat confront our planet, its States and its peoples? By \r\nbearing in mind that it is our mission and urgent need \r\nto uphold our vision, which calls on us to support the \r\nfive priorities of the programme of action that have \r\nbeen drawn up for the next five years and submitted \r\nto us by the Secretary-General. Since he has invited \r\nus to so, we wish to underline the need to prioritize \r\nthe strengthening of the United Nations system as well \r\nas the development of partnerships in all areas of its \r\nactivity.\r\nThe President rightly sought to focus the general \r\ndebate of this session on the subject of the peaceful \r\nsettlement of international situations and disputes. This \r\nhistoric debate, launched at the beginning of the week \r\nby the General Assembly, has shown that respect for the \r\nrule of law, at both the national and the international \r\nlevels, is indispensable for the establishment of \r\nresponsible societies that are able to promote \r\n6 12-52408\r\nA/67/PV.17\r\ncooperation and ensure the well-being of their citizens. \r\nRecent history leads us to take a serious look at the \r\ncurrent difficulties confronting the world. While last \r\nyear we welcomed the magnificent spark of democracy \r\nthat was kindled in the Arab world, it is intolerable now \r\nthat minority factions and extremists are threatening \r\nthe hopes and dampening the expectations of people \r\nwho aspire to live in liberty.\r\nThe Government of  the Principality of Monaco \r\nechoes those who have condemned the acts of violence \r\nperpetrated both by the authorities and by opposition \r\ngroups in the Syrian Arab Republic, where the \r\nsituation only continues to deteriorate. I would also \r\nlike to convey my full support for the efforts made by \r\nthe International Committee of the Red Cross and its \r\nresolve in seeking to ensure that humanitarian needs \r\nare met. Clearly, that is involves ensuring that each and \r\nevery one respect the rule of international humanitarian \r\nlaw as the minimum requirement for meeting the basic, \r\nelementary moral standards of our peoples, standards \r\nthat do not, unfortunately, seem to be shared by all.\r\nWe are equally concerned by the recent events in \r\nthe Sahel region, including in Mali, which are growing \r\nworse. The Principality of Monaco, which is involved in \r\nvarious humanitarian efforts in the region, supports all \r\nsuch actions by the international community, given the \r\nurgency and gravity of the situation. We will support \r\na strategy established by the United Nations that can \r\naddress the issues of security, governance, development, \r\nhuman rights and humanitarian aspects. The values that \r\nwe are committed to uphold in adopting the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations are based on our common humanity \r\nand on the recognition of our differences, which are at \r\nthe very core of our humanity.\r\nAllow me, in that regard, to pay tribute to all those \r\nwho have been committed to serving those values on \r\nthe ground, often paying with their lives. They seek to \r\nuphold the aims and principles that bring us together \r\nhere in this forum. Our authorities have resolutely \r\ncondemned all attacks perpetrated against diplomatic \r\nand consular missions and personnel. We must all \r\nensure the obligation of guaranteeing their protection \r\nin all circumstances.\r\nAt a time when the world is facing worrying \r\ndevelopments, the theme that the President has selected \r\nfor this session of the General Assembly merits the \r\nunanimous support of all in our community. Aware of \r\nthe challenges, I would like to take the opportunity to \r\ncommend Mr. Vuk Jeremić, President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-seventh session, on his election \r\nand to assure the Assembly of my delegation’s full \r\nsupport.\r\nMore than ever before, we need to resort to the \r\npeaceful settlement of our disputes and seek to prevent \r\nrather than react to events. In the 1950s, Secretary-\r\nGeneral Dag Hammarskjöld urged us to be mindful of \r\nthe need to respond at an early stage to crises in order \r\nto avoid the outbreak of disputes between parties or the \r\nconflagration of a dispute into an open conflict, or in \r\nthe event that a conflict does break out, to ensure that \r\nit can be contained.\r\nWe have been caught unaware and so many ongoing \r\nproblems in the year 2012 have gone unsolved. We have \r\nbeen largely successful in ensuring that international \r\nlaw prevails over the right to wage war. However, the \r\ninvolvement of our Organization in conflict prevention \r\nstill falls quite short, as avowals and statements of intent \r\non their own are insufficient. It is therefore our common \r\nduty to strengthen understanding, tolerance and mutual \r\nrespect. As was recalled by the Secretary-General here \r\non 13 September, as well as by his predecessor, one of \r\nthe strongest factors for conflict prevention, and thus \r\nfor the inculcation of an authentic culture of peace, is \r\neducation. That kind of prevention is aimed at  enrolling \r\nthe young generations to whom we owe a future.\r\nThe challenges are manifold. Among them, I would \r\nsingle out the economic and financial crisis, which has \r\naffected the overwhelming majority of our States since \r\n2008. We can overcome the crisis, creating employment \r\nwhile protecting our environmental heritage. But \r\nin order to do so, we need an ambitious long-term \r\nvision, and that is why, in spite of the budget cuts, \r\nthe crisis has compelled us to realize that we cannot \r\nafford to lose sight of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals — elimination of poverty and hunger; education; \r\nchild and maternal health; and combatting pandemics, \r\nincluding HIV/AIDS and malaria, which sap humankind \r\nof its strength — which must remain uppermost on our \r\nagenda.\r\nThe upcoming deadline must encourage us to do \r\nstill more to intensify our efforts in order to ensure their \r\nachievement. In 2015, we will adopt a new programme \r\nof action, based on the results achieved and on the new \r\nchallenges to be met.\r\nIn his address to the United Nations Conference on \r\nSustainable Development, His Serene Highness Prince \r\n12-52408 7\r\nA/67/PV.17\r\nAlbert II of the Principality of Monaco welcomed the \r\nfact that we are progressing towards a shared definition \r\nof sustainable development goals. Those goals will \r\nframe our actions at the international, national and local \r\nlevels, and in turn, that will make the implementation of \r\nour commitments more effective and more transparent. \r\nOne of those objectives should emphasize \r\nthe sustainable development of oceans and on the \r\nimportance of the blue economy.\r\nThat objective should concern all sectors that \r\ndepend on ocean resources and maritime areas. It \r\nis urgent that that objective be comprehensive and \r\nsustainable so that those sectors can continue to benefit \r\nfrom economic, social and environmental services. \r\nAccordingly, our delegation will support all initiatives \r\nseeking to improve the coordination and effectiveness \r\nof the United Nations work in the oceans. Indeed, we \r\nbelieve that that is the right path to follow in order to \r\nultimately ensure the sustainable use and management \r\nof the oceans and thereby their conservation.\r\nThe fate of future generations lies in our hands. \r\nFor that reason, we are obliged to ensure that the Doha \r\nClimate Change Conference is a success. It is therefore \r\ncrucial that we reach agreement on the establishment \r\nof a second period of commitments under the Kyoto \r\nProtocol. We therefore commit ourselves to working \r\npositively and effectively in the negotiations on reaching \r\na new global post-2020 climate agreement, taking into \r\naccount the needs of the most vulnerable.\r\nHis Serene Highness Prince Albert II welcomes \r\nthe celebration next year of the twentieth anniversary \r\nof Monaco’s joining the United Nations as a Member \r\nState.  In that connection, Monaco wishes to express \r\nits resolve to contribute to the further strengthening of \r\nour Organization to the extent that a small State can \r\ndo so. Members may rest assured that the Principality \r\nwelcomes the Assembly’s two-fold intention of \r\nfurther involving itself in the field of development \r\nand establishing an advisory framework that seeks to \r\nenhance the cooperation between the General Assembly \r\nand international financial institutions. \r\nOn the occasion of the twentieth anniversary of the \r\nForum of Small States, of which Monaco is a member, \r\nand also in its capacity as a member of the Global \r\nGovernance Group, the Principality intends to play its \r\nfull role in the work of those bodies. The magnitude of \r\nthe challenges and crises that we all face have shown \r\nthat the size of a State is not the deciding factor when \r\nit comes to resolving such problems. Rather, it is solely \r\nour ability to work together and cooperate that enables \r\nus to respond to everyday needs and that will lead us on \r\nthe path towards international peace and security. \r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now call \r\non His Excellency Mr. Abdulaziz Kamilov, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Uzbekistan.\r\nMr. Kamilov (Uzbekistan): Allow me very briefly \r\nto address what are, in our opinion, some of the most \r\nimportant items on the agenda of this session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. First of all, today, in this century \r\nof globalization and rapidly changing situations and \r\ngrowing tensions and confrontations in many regions \r\nof the world, we need to come up with unconventional \r\nand extraordinary responses to crisis situations and \r\nwars that have been ongoing for many decades and are \r\ntherefore persistent features of our agenda.\r\nTo our great regret, instead of seeking to deeply \r\nunderstand emerging problems and confrontations in \r\none region of the world or another and addressing them \r\nin a timely manner, finding their true origins or focusing \r\nthe international community on preventing them from \r\ngrowing into large-scale crises and wars, the world \r\nis letting its most precious resource — time — slip \r\nthrough its fingers. That leads, of course, to enormous \r\ncosts and the waste of other precious resources. Let me \r\noffer a few examples.\r\nAs early as in 1993, President Karimov of the \r\nRepublic of Uzbekistan, when he spoke before the \r\nforty-eighth session of the General Assembly (see \r\nA/48/PV.6), drew the international community’s \r\nattention to the need to immediately resolve the situation \r\nin Afghanistan, given the close connection between \r\nregional and global security, the need to respect the civil \r\nand religious rights of the people of Afghanistan and the \r\nneed to prevent the conflict from growing into a full-\r\nscale civil war. Otherwise the problems in Afghanistan \r\nwould turn into a painful and bitter issue of concern \r\nto the international community as a whole. Difficult \r\nproblems may resurface when the imminent withdrawal \r\nof the International Security Assistance Forces from \r\nAfghanistan occurs by late 2014 and the responsibility \r\nfor ensuring stability in the country is turned over to \r\nthe newly created Afghan National Security Forces. It \r\nis obvious today that that turn of events may lead to a \r\nstand-off between opposing forces in Afghanistan itself \r\nand in neighbouring countries. It may also lead to the \r\ngrowth of extremism and radicalism, cause a surge in \r\n8 12-52408\r\nA/67/PV.17\r\nAmu Darya and the Syr Darya — are the main sources \r\nof water and life for the millions of people residing \r\nnear them, should be addressed in accordance with \r\nthe universally recognized norms of international law \r\nprovided for in the 1992 United Nations Convention on \r\nthe Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses \r\nand International Lakes and the 1997 United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Non-navigational Uses of \r\nInternational Watercourses.\r\nThose instruments require adherence to the \r\nprinciple of doing no harm to the environment or to \r\nthe interests of neighbouring States when exploiting the \r\nresources of transboundary rivers. \r\nIt is therefore reasonable that Uzbekistan calls for \r\nthose principles and standards to be our guides in the \r\nsearch for mutually acceptable compromise decisions \r\non water use. We believe that all hydropower facility \r\nconstruction projects in the upper waters of the Syr \r\nDarya and Amu Darya basins should be evaluated by \r\ninternational experts under the auspices of the United \r\nNations and agreed to by the downstream countries. \r\nOnly after such agreement and coordination should \r\nconstruction begin on two proposed dams, which \r\nare practically the largest in the world, namely, the \r\n350-metre-high Rogun hydropower station in the upper \r\nwaters of the Amu Darya and the 275-metre-high \r\nKambarata 1 station in the upper waters of the Syr \r\nDarya. Furthermore, that construction has to be carried \r\nout in mountainous terrain where seismicity levels can \r\nreach 9 to 10 points on the Richter scale.\r\nTo comply with international requirements, it is \r\nessential to set priorities for water use. The region’s \r\nlimited water resources must first be used to meet \r\ndrinking and sanitary needs, and only after that to \r\nensure food security and to meet ecological demands \r\nand the needs of the industry and power sectors.\r\nThirdly, Uzbekistan remains committed to \r\npreserving peace, stability and security in the region. \r\nThat principled position is stipulated in the Republic of \r\nUzbekistan’s position paper on foreign policy activity, \r\nformulated on the initiative of the Head of State of \r\nUzbekistan. In particular, the document includes the \r\nfollowing important provisions. \r\nFirst, the Republic of Uzbekistan reserves the right \r\nto enter into alliances, join commonwealths and other \r\ninter-State establishments, as well as to leave them, \r\nguided by the supreme interests of the State, the people, \r\ntheir well-being and security, the priority guidelines for \r\ndrug trafficking and aggravate tensions in the region \r\nas whole.\r\nAs the situation is unfolding, the best way to \r\naddress the situation in Afghanistan is to establish a \r\ncontact group under the auspices of the United Nations \r\nwith the participation of the country’s neighbours, \r\nthe United States, NATO and the Russian Federation. \r\nThe principal goal of such efforts should be to reach a \r\ncompromise and an agreement between the opposing \r\nforces and form a coalition Government on that basis. \r\nSuch a coalition Government could be comprised of \r\nthe core ethnic, national and religious groups involved \r\nin the military and political stand-off taking place in \r\nAfghanistan.\r\nUzbekistan has suggested that approach a number \r\nof times, for example, at the NATO summits in \r\nBucharest in 2008 and in Chicago this year, as well as \r\nat the High-level Plenary Meeting on the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals held in New York in 2010 (see \r\nA/65/PV.3). The Republic of Uzbekistan has always \r\nconducted, and will always maintain, a friendly, good-\r\nneighbourly policy towards its neighbour Afghanistan. \r\nUzbekistan has built its relationship with Afghanistan \r\non a bilateral basis, taking into account the national \r\ninterests of both countries and respecting the Afghan \r\npeople’s choice in terms of the future of their country. \r\nToday, Uzbekistan offers comprehensive forms of \r\nassistance to Afghanistan so that it may return once \r\nagain to peace. Specifically, we have contributed \r\nto the construction of bridges, motorways and the \r\nstrategic Khairaton-Mazar-e-Sharif railroad link, \r\nwhich connects Afghanistan with the States of Central \r\nAsia, as well as providing an uninterrupted supply \r\nof electricity to Kabul. Uzbekistan plays a key role \r\nin ensuring the stable and effective operation of the \r\nnorthern distribution network.\r\nSecondly, climate change and the global \r\ndeteriorating ecological situation have made ensuring \r\nthe reasonable and rational use of water resources the \r\nmost acute problem of the modern world. Increasing \r\nshortages of fresh water, which is needed to provide \r\nfood security and protect human life, serve to confirm \r\nthat assertion. In that connection, I would like to \r\npresent the Republic of Uzbekistan’s main approach to \r\naddressing those issues, which are of vital importance \r\nfor all the States of Central Asia. \r\nWe believe that all water and energy issues in our \r\nregion, where the largest transboundary rivers — the \r\n12-52408 9\r\nA/67/PV.17\r\nGovernments of States Members of the United Nations \r\nfor their valuable support for our candidacy and for \r\ntheir solidarity with Azerbaijan during 17 rounds of \r\nelections.\r\nThe theme of the this year’s general debate, \r\n“Bringing about adjustment or settlement of international \r\ndisputes or situations by peaceful means”, is timely \r\nand topical. It also represents a logical continuation of \r\ndiscussions we had during the previous session. Indeed, \r\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes is one of the key \r\nand core principles of international law enshrined in \r\nthe United Nations Charter. Its true value is to be able \r\nto commit States to respecting one another’s territorial \r\nintegrity and political independence, refraining in \r\ntheir international relations from the threat or use of \r\nforce and resolving their disputes in conformity with \r\ninternational law.\r\nAt its sixty-fi fth and sixty-sixth sessions, the General \r\nAssembly adopted two resolutions on strengthening the \r\nrole of mediation in the peaceful settlement of disputes, \r\nconflict prevention and resolution (resolutions 65/283 \r\nand 66/291), and the Secretary-General submitted \r\na report on the subject that contains a Guidance for \r\nEffective Mediation (A/66/811, annex I). As a sponsor \r\nof those resolutions, Azerbaijan considers the process \r\nbegun by their adoption to be an essential effort \r\ntowards reinforcing the promotion of mediation in the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes, conflict prevention \r\nand resolution, as well as providing useful guidance to \r\nexisting and future mediation mechanisms. A crucial \r\nfactor is that those resolutions, and the Guidance for \r\nEffective Mediation developed by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, reaffirmed the key importance of the United \r\nNations Charter and of international law and justice, \r\nin particular the commitment to respect and uphold \r\nthe sovereignty, territorial integrity and political \r\nindependence of States.\r\nDuring Azerbaijan’s presidency of the Security \r\nCouncil this past May, we organized an Arria-formula \r\nmeeting of the Council to encourage a frank exchange \r\nof views, within a f lexible procedural framework, on \r\nthe role of mediation, judicial settlement and justice in \r\npromoting durable peace and reconciliation based on \r\ninternational law. We look forward to further initiatives \r\non the topic in the General Assembly and the Security \r\nCouncil with a view to contributing to the development \r\nand implementation of comprehensive peace strategies \r\nwithin specific frameworks that provide that dispute \r\nmodernizing the country, existing national legislation \r\nand international obligations that have been assumed. \r\nThe paper continues, stating that Uzbekistan maintains \r\na peace-loving policy, does not participate in military-\r\npolitical blocs, and reserves the right to leave any \r\ninter-State body if the latter is transformed into a \r\nmilitary-political bloc. Next, the Republic of Uzbekistan \r\nwill take political, economic and other measures to \r\nprevent its involvement in military conflicts or hotbeds \r\nof tension in adjacent States and will not allow the \r\ndeployment of foreign bases and facilities on its own \r\nterritory. Next, the armed forces of the Republic of \r\nUzbekistan will not participate in military operations \r\nabroad. Finally, the main priority concern of the foreign \r\npolicy of Uzbekistan is the region of Central Asia, \r\nwhere the country’s crucial interests lie. \r\nThe problems of Central Asia must be addressed \r\nby the countries of the region without interference \r\nfrom external Powers. Uzbekistan remains committed \r\nto pursuing an open, friendly and pragmatic policy \r\ntowards its immediate neighbours, and proceeds from \r\na position that all outstanding political, economic and \r\necological problems of the region should be addressed \r\non the basis of the mutual consideration of interests, \r\nconstructive dialogue and the norms of international \r\nlaw.\r\nWe set great store by the United Nations as a \r\nuniversal structure and the only worldwide, universally \r\naccepted body capable of ensuring security, stability \r\nand consistent development, including in our region. \r\nUzbekistan stands ready to continue to cooperate \r\neffectively with the Organization and its specialized \r\nbodies in order to achieve those high and noble goals.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Elmar Maharram oglu \r\nMammadyarov, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the \r\nRepublic of Azerbaijan.\r\nMr. Mammadyarov (Azerbaijan): At the outset, I \r\nwould like to congratulate my good friend, Mr. Vuk \r\nJeremić, on his election to the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-seventh session, and to wish him \r\nevery success in fulfilling his highly responsible duties. \r\nWe are also grateful to Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser \r\nfor presiding ably over the sixty-sixth session.\r\nThis is the fi rst general debate that I have addressed \r\nsince Azerbaijan was elected to a non-permanent seat \r\non the Security Council, and I would like to express \r\nour sincere gratitude and profound appreciation to the \r\n10 12-52408\r\nA/67/PV.17\r\nsettlement and conflict resolution must be based on \r\nrespect for the rule of law and for justice.\r\nThe world continues to face persistent, grave and \r\nsystematic violations of the fundamental norms and \r\nprinciples of international law. There are still instances \r\nwhere archaic patterns of the use of force against the \r\nterritorial integrity and political independence of \r\nStates are used to achieve territorial gains. Hundreds \r\nof thousands of people throughout the world continue \r\nto suffer from aggression, military occupation, ethnic \r\ncleansing and a prevailing culture of impunity for the \r\nmost serious crimes of concern to the international \r\ncommunity.\r\nThe ongoing armed conflict between Armenia \r\nand Azerbaijan continues to represent a serious threat \r\nand challenge to international and regional peace and \r\nsecurity. The conflict has led to the occupation of \r\nalmost 20 per cent of the territory of Azerbaijan and \r\nhas turned more than one million people in the country \r\ninto internally displaced persons or refugees. The war \r\nhas also led to the deaths and wounding of thousands \r\nof Azerbaijanis, including women, the elderly and \r\nchildren. In addition, the aggression against Azerbaijan \r\nhas severely damaged the country in socioeconomic \r\nterms. Not a single Azerbaijani historic or cultural \r\nmonument has been left undamaged, and no sacred \r\nsite has escaped desecration in either the occupied \r\nterritories or in Armenia.\r\nWe sincerely believe that there is no alternative \r\nto peace, stability and mutually beneficial regional \r\ncooperation. As a country suffering from the occupation \r\nof its territories and the forcible displacement of \r\nhundreds of thousands of its citizens, Azerbaijan is the \r\nmost interested party in the earliest possible negotiated \r\nsettlement of the conflict. Without prejudice to its rights \r\nunder the United Nations Charter, in particular those \r\nset forth in Article 51, Azerbaijan embarked on and \r\nremains committed to the conflict settlement process, \r\nconfident that it will lead to the end of the illegal \r\nArmenian occupation, ensure the return of forcibly \r\ndisplaced people to their homes and guarantee the \r\npeaceful coexistence of the Armenian and Azerbaijani \r\ncommunities in the Nagorno Karabakh region within \r\nthe Republic of Azerbaijan.\r\nAttempts by the Armenian side to misinterpret \r\nthe norms and principles of international law and \r\nits insistence on unrealistic annexationist claims, \r\nwhich Azerbaijan will never accept, speak to the real \r\nintentions of Armenia’s leadership and represent an \r\nopen challenge to the conflict settlement process, as \r\nwell as a serious threat to international and regional \r\npeace and security. In f lagrant violation of the United \r\nNations Charter, Armenia continues to use force to \r\nmaintain its occupation of the Nagorno Karabakh \r\nregion and seven other districts of Azerbaijan, as well \r\nas to prevent internally displaced Azerbaijani persons \r\nfrom returning to their homes. It is attempting to alter \r\nthe demographic balance in the occupied territories \r\nand to remove any signs of their Azerbaijani cultural \r\nand historical roots. Additionally, regular ceasefire \r\nviolations and deliberate attacks by the armed forces of \r\nArmenia against the inhabitants of towns and villages in \r\nAzerbaijan along the front line and the border between \r\nthe two States have become more frequent and violent \r\nin recent times, resulting in the killing and injuring of \r\nmany Azerbaijani civilians.\r\nWe have no doubt that the Azerbaijani and \r\nArmenian communities of Nagorno Karabakh will \r\none day live side by side in peace and dignity in that \r\nregion of Azerbaijan. It is therefore essential and vital \r\nto continue efforts for peace and coexistence between \r\nthe two communities. Azerbaijan considers that an \r\nimportant part of the whole reconciliation process \r\nand has therefore accepted invitations from a number \r\nof European non-governmental organizations to hold \r\nintercommunal meetings. However, those proposals \r\nhave so far been blocked by the authorities in Yerevan. \r\nMoreover, the aggressive rhetoric of Armenia’s \r\nleadership and its blatant promotion of odious ideas of \r\nracial superiority, ethnic and religious incompatibility \r\nand hatred towards Azerbaijan and other neighbouring \r\nnations only deepen mistrust and make more elusive \r\nthe prospect of a speedy negotiated settlement.\r\nThe situation is further complicated by Armenia’s \r\nirresponsible and unacceptable behaviour in the highly \r\nsensitive domain of justice and reconciliation. The \r\nperpetrators of war crimes and crimes against humanity, \r\nincluding acts of genocide against the Azerbaijani \r\npeople, not only remain unpunished in Armenia but \r\nare even promoted, venerated and officially rewarded \r\nwith the title of hero. Schools, universities and streets \r\nare named after them and monuments are erected in \r\ntheir honour. War criminals who proudly avow their \r\nrole in the mass killing of Azerbaijani civilians are \r\nreincarnated as highly placed politicians, military \r\ncommanders and public figures.\r\n12-52408 11\r\nA/67/PV.17\r\nbetween the parties. We call upon the parties to \r\ncreate the conditions conducive to the resumption of \r\nnegotiations. In that regard, we share the concerns of \r\nthe international community over settlement activity \r\nin the occupied Palestinian territories, which places \r\na tremendous burden on civilians, seriously obstructs \r\nthe peace process and, what is even more dangerous, \r\nthreatens the two-State solution and the emergence of \r\na viable Palestinian State. We reiterate our support for \r\nPalestine’s application for admission to membership in \r\nthe United Nations and look forward to a solution to \r\nthat issuebased on international law.\r\nAzerbaijan also remains deeply concerned \r\nabout the escalation of violence and the worsening \r\nsocioeconomic and humanitarian situation in Syria. We \r\nbelieve that the solution to the crisis lies in the hands \r\nof the Syrian people and in their desire for mutual \r\nreconciliation and an all-inclusive political process. We \r\nwelcome the appointment of Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi as \r\nthe Joint Special Representative of the United Nations \r\nand the League of Arab States for Syria, and express \r\nour firm support for his efforts.\r\nWe must once again express our deep concern \r\nover the recent escalation provoked by the blasphemy \r\nagainst Islam. We strongly condemn all assaults against \r\nreligions. At the same time, attacks on civilians, in \r\nparticular on diplomatic personnel, are unjustifiable \r\nunder any circumstances. It is critical to foster global \r\ndialogue and cooperation to promote tolerance, peace \r\nand better understanding across countries, cultures and \r\ncivilizations.\r\nWe are confident that during the sixty-seventh \r\nsession of the General Assembly, Member States will \r\nbe able to take successful steps towards a stronger \r\nand more effective United Nations. With its active \r\nparticipation in the work of the organs of the United \r\nNations, most notably the General Assembly and \r\nSecurity Council, Azerbaijan will continue to be in the \r\nforefront of international efforts to that end.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now call \r\non His Excellency Mr. Ratu Inoke Kubuabola, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs, International Cooperation and \r\nCivil Aviation of the Republic of Fiji.\r\nMr. Kubuabola (Fiji): On behalf of the Prime \r\nMinister and the people of Fiji, I congratulate the \r\nPresident on his election and have full confidence in \r\nhis guidance of the sixty-seventh session of the General \r\nAssembly. I wish also to pay tribute to the tireless efforts \r\nArmenia must finally realize that the irresponsible \r\nand provocative policy of territorial claims, animosity \r\nand hatred towards neighbouring countries and nations \r\nbased on historical, cultural, racial and religious \r\nprejudices has no chance of success. The earlier it \r\ngrasps that fact, the sooner our countries will be able to \r\nreach mutual understanding and enjoy peace, stability \r\nand cooperation.\r\nIt is clear that both the conflict-settlement process \r\nand its outcome must be consistent with international \r\nlaw. The achievement of peace, security, stability and \r\nconfidence therefore depends first and foremost on the \r\nremoval of the consequences of Armenia’s illegal use \r\nof force. That will ensure that the occupation of the \r\nterritories of Azerbaijan is at an end and that the right \r\nof internally displaced Azerbaijani persons to return to \r\ntheir homes and recover their property and possessions \r\nwill be implemented. That is what international \r\nlaw and the relevant Security Council and General \r\nAssembly resolutions require, which means that this \r\ncondition cannot be subject to compromise or used as \r\na bargaining chip in the conflict settlement process. \r\nArmenia’s implementation of its obligation to withdraw \r\nits armed forces from the territory of Azerbaijan and \r\nto resolve outstanding issues of State responsibility for \r\nacts deemed wrongful under international law cannot \r\nbe made contingent on addressing the aggressor’s \r\nunlawful and unacceptable claims.\r\nThe fact that the situation has remained unresolved \r\nfor so long does not speak well for the strength and \r\nefficiency of the international organizations that are \r\ndeaing with the issue. It is obvious that the primary \r\nrole in the resolution of the conflict lies with the \r\nStates concerned. At the same time, when it comes to \r\nprinciples, it is everyone’s duty to defend them. In that \r\nregard, Azerbaijan highly appreciates the principled \r\nstance of Member States, as expressed in various \r\nforums, including the most recent summits of NATO, \r\nthe Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement, on issues of vital importance \r\nto our country and pertaining to its sovereignty and \r\nterritorial integrity. We count on the continued resolve \r\nof the international community to defend the purposes \r\nand principles of the United Nations Charter, and on its \r\nstrong solidarity with the just position of Azerbaijan.\r\nWe would like to express our concern over the \r\nsituation with regard to the Middle East peace process, \r\nwhich has been at a standstill with no substantive \r\nprogress towards the resumption of direct talks \r\n12 12-52408\r\nA/67/PV.17\r\nBut the reward is not in meeting the goals; the \r\nreward is in children who are healthier, families that are \r\nless burdened, and generations given a better chance to \r\nbecome productive adults. We must never forget that \r\nbehind each of those Millennium Development Goals \r\nare human beings — the citizens of our nations — who \r\nlook to us to provide opportunities for a fuller life. We \r\nstill have work to do particularly in meeting MDGs 1, \r\n3 and 6, and we are working on those as best we can. \r\nThe particular case of small island developing States \r\nin meeting those goals and their specific challenges \r\nwill be addressed by the third Global Conference on the \r\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing \r\nStates, to be held in the Pacific region in 2014. The \r\nsuccess of the Conference will be measured in actions, \r\nnot simply in more words. Substantive preparations \r\nfor the Conference must therefore be oriented towards \r\ntaking action and achieving specific goals.\r\nIn addition to support for regional development, \r\nFiji is also taking the lead in the region on broadband \r\nconnectivity. It is clear to us that broadband is \r\nan essential technology for improving education, \r\nmedicine, agriculture and environmental services. \r\nBroadband technology is especially important to us \r\nbecause it will help unite a dispersed people and help \r\ndraw us closer to our island neighbours in the Pacific. \r\nIf we take care to make it accessible, affordable and \r\nunderstandable, we will bring an entire universe of \r\nwisdom and understanding to the smallest schools and \r\nremotest villages. Information need no longer be the \r\nproperty mostly of people who live in the cities or who \r\nare attached to large institutions.\r\nLike all islands nations, Fiji relies on the ocean and \r\nits resources as our economic lifeblood and source of \r\nsustainable development. While fish and other living \r\nmarine resources have been vital to Fiji’s economy \r\nand livelihood, we believe that our efforts to explore \r\ndeep-sea mineral resources have greater potential, \r\nprovided that a precautionary approach with regard to \r\nenvironmental sustainability is ensured.\r\nThe theme selected by the President for this \r\nyear’s general debate, “Bringing about adjustment or \r\nsettlement of international disputes or situations by \r\npeaceful means”, is most relevant in these times of \r\nturbulence across the world. The United Nations must \r\ncontinue to be at the vanguard of international peace \r\nand security. It must be able to respond to new types \r\nof crises, always with an aim to stabilize the places it \r\nof his predecessor, Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, \r\nthrough what has been an eventful and turbulent year \r\nfor the global community of nations.\r\nThe world is facing many challenges that demand \r\nour attention and collective action. As we all gathered \r\nlast June in Rio de Janeiro for the United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development, millions \r\nof people were recovering from, or living through, \r\nnatural disasters. In Fiji, we experienced our worst \r\nf looding on record during the months of January and \r\nApril. Beyond the human cost, the economic damage \r\nto infrastructure, schools, businesses, agriculture and \r\ntourism — a sector that generates 33 per cent of Fiji’s \r\ngross domestic product — was immense, and we still \r\nhave not fully recovered. Our f loods were by no means \r\nthe world’s worst climatic disaster of the year; other \r\npeoples suffered much worse. But as a people who live \r\non a group of small islands in the South Pacific, we feel \r\nparticularly vulnerable.\r\nThe ongoing failure of the international community \r\nto seriously address climate change means that we will \r\nall see more frequent and more intense weather events. \r\nThose will erode our development gains and leave our \r\npeople feeling poorer and less secure, so it is clear that \r\nit is indispensable to incorporate disaster risk reduction \r\ninto global and national development strategies.\r\nThe post-2015 development agenda is now under \r\ndiscussion, and frameworks and modalities are being \r\ndeveloped. However, our job with the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) is not complete. As a \r\nglobal community of nations that has committed to \r\nthose goals, we must give meaningful support to all \r\nthose States lagging in their progress. We must also \r\nensure that a post-2015 development agenda does not \r\nsimply delay the target date for the MDG indicators \r\nand goals. The development community can do much \r\nmore, including meeting our agreed objectives for \r\ndevelopment funding.\r\nFiji has embarked on a comprehensive reform \r\nprogramme not only to promote development, but also \r\nto improve the lives of our people. We have embraced \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals as they were \r\nintended — to provide specific objective standards for \r\nimproving the lives of our people. We are the second \r\ncountry in the world to introduce the pneumococcal \r\nand rotavirus immunizations as standard, with a view \r\nto minimizing child mortality. That represents progress \r\ntowards meeting MDGs 4 and 5. \r\n12-52408 13\r\nA/67/PV.17\r\nparties. Fiji works through the Melanesian Spearhead \r\nGroup in monitoring the progress of implementation \r\nof the Noumea Accord. Additionally, at the Engaging \r\nwith the Pacific Meetings held in Fiji in 2011 and 2012, \r\nPacific island leaders committed to supporting the \r\ninalienable right of the people of Ma’ohi Nui/French \r\nPolynesia to self-determination. We look forward to \r\nworking through the United Nations processes and with \r\nall relevant partners in order to have the question of \r\nMa’ohi Nui’s self-determination placed on the United \r\nNations agenda again.\r\nFiji is itself working through a period of reform and \r\ntransition. We are building a sustainable democracy \r\nfounded on the principle of “one person, one vote, one \r\nvalue”. Elections will be held under a new constitution \r\nand electoral system no later than September 2014. \r\nThose elections will see the citizens of Fiji go to the \r\npolls without regard to their race for the first time in \r\nour nation’s history. Fiji’s new constitution will be \r\nbased on some unassailable democratic principles: a \r\nsecular State that recognizes our multi-faith society; \r\na common national identity in which all citizens, not \r\njust indigenous people, will call themselves Fijians for \r\nthe first time; a war against corruption, which inhibits \r\nthe country’s development; an independent judiciary \r\nto uphold the rights of every Fijian; social justice and \r\nthe elimination of all forms of discrimination, so that \r\nevery Fijian is treated equally; good and transparent \r\ngovernance; and lowering the voting age to 18 to give \r\nour young people a voice.\r\nWe set up an independent Constitutional \r\nCommission in March to draft a new constitution \r\nguided by those principles. It will be a constitution \r\nof and for the people. Ordinary Fijians are seizing \r\nthe opportunity to put forward their views at public \r\nhearings throughout the country and to voice the issues \r\nthat are most important to them. The Commission’s \r\nrecommendations will be reviewed by a Constituent \r\nAssembly in early 2013. This body, made up of a broad \r\ncross-section of Fijian society, will formulate the final \r\ndocument through public discussion and debate. That \r\nwill set the scene for elections in 2014, for which \r\npreparations have already begun. Through a process of \r\nelectronic registration carried out in July and August \r\nof this year, almost half a million Fijians have so far \r\nregistered to vote.\r\nThroughout this process, we have stayed true to \r\nthe principle that we in Fiji must determine our own \r\ndestiny, one that is inclusive and fair to all citizens. \r\nenters and leave behind not just a state of peace and \r\nstability, but also an environment that fosters freedom \r\nand opportunity for the people.\r\nIn that context, Fiji continues to play a role in \r\npeacekeeping missions around the world that is far \r\nbeyond what is expected of a country of our size \r\nand level of development. We contribute troops and \r\npolice personnel to operations in Iraq, Liberia, South \r\nSudan, Darfur and Timor-Leste. Fiji has responded to \r\nexigent requests by the Department of Peacekeeping \r\nOperations, above and beyond agreed contributions, \r\nto ensure that peacekeeping operations in Iraq can \r\ncontinue unhindered, despite the additional burden it \r\nhas placed on our troops operating far from home and \r\nfor longer than envisaged. We believe that all nations \r\nmust find ways to make the world safer, more humane \r\nand more livable, and as a people we are proud that we \r\ncan make that contribution to global peace and security \r\nand to the lives of citizens far away from us. That is \r\nnot just Government policy; it is a calling that is deeply \r\nembraced by the Fijian people.\r\nRecognizing the role that peacekeeping missions \r\nwith expanded mandates play in helping to build the \r\nfoundations of a sustainable future, Fiji has in the past \r\nyear also started to contribute in a small yet meaningful \r\nway to the corrections and justice sector of peacekeeping \r\nmissions. Mentoring and strengthening corrections and \r\njustice institutions is part of the process of allowing \r\npost-conflict societies to take control of their own \r\ndestinies, and Fiji is pleased to be able to be a part of \r\nthose unfolding stories around the world.\r\nFiji has been honoured to be a part of that process \r\nin our own region through our contributions in Timor-\r\nLeste via the United Nations Integrated Mission in \r\nTimor-Leste (UNMIT). Following the successful \r\nelections in Timor-Leste early this year, UNMIT will be \r\nin a position to wind down its operations later this year, \r\nallowing the Timorese people to take full ownership \r\nand control of their own destinies. Timor-Leste is now \r\nan observer to the regional organization of which Fiji is \r\nthe current Chair, the Melanesian Spearhead Group, and \r\nwe trust that through that organization and the United \r\nNations we will have many years of collaboration ahead.\r\nIn the spirit of supporting self-determination, \r\nFiji continues to work through the Decolonization \r\nCommittee of the United Nations to ensure that New \r\nCaledonia’s right to self-determination, as expressed in \r\nthe Noumea Accord, is implemented faithfully by all \r\n14 12-52408\r\nA/67/PV.17\r\nopportunities for the young and less aff luent. As part \r\nof Fiji’s progress in reform towards democracy, we \r\nare reviewing our current labour laws to ensure their \r\ncompliance with the 34 ILO conventions that Fiji has \r\nratified. The tripartite Employment Relations Advisory \r\nBoard is a key participant in this process. This year \r\nalone, Fiji has ratified or adopted eight ILO instruments, \r\nas recommended by the tripartite Board, including the \r\n2006 Maritime Labour Convention. \r\nBy empowering Fijians, the Government is \r\nseeking to ensure that all citizens, regardless of ethnic \r\nbackground, are on a level playing field and in possession \r\nof the tools needed to compete with their peers in the \r\nglobal community, improve their livelihoods and fulfil \r\ntheir dreams. By modernizing Fiji, the Government is \r\nseeking to make the country and its institutions and \r\nlegal system strong, independent and world-class.\r\nFiji may be a relatively small country, but it has \r\nbig aspirations. They include being a good global \r\ncitizen, a leader by example among island nations, \r\nand an actively engaged member of the international \r\ncommunity. In the spirit of constructive contribution \r\nto the global community and the United Nations, I \r\nam pleased to say that at today’s ministerial meeting \r\nof the Group of 77 and China, Fiji was endorsed as \r\nthe Chair of the Group for the year 2013. Fiji takes \r\non this responsibility with a deep sense of humility, a \r\nwillingness to work collaboratively with all States, and \r\na commitment to addressing the inequalities that exist \r\nbetween developing and developed countries.\r\nAs we look forward to a productive sixty-seventh \r\nsession of the General Assembly, we reiterate our full \r\nsupport for and cooperation with the President and all \r\nMembers, with a view to advancing the objectives of \r\nthis body and the aspirations of the global community.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now call \r\non His Excellency Mr. Gilbert Saboya Sunyé, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs and Institutional Relations of the \r\nPrincipality of Andorra.\r\nMr. Saboya Sunyé (Andorra) (spoke in Catalan; \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): I would first \r\nlike to extend hearty congratulations to the President \r\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session, \r\nMr. Jeremić, to whom I wish the greatest success in his \r\nwork.\r\nJust one year ago, I ended my statement \r\n(see A/66/PV.27) by reasserting the notion of \r\nWe are taking the time necessary to get it right. We \r\nhave endured criticism and a degree of isolation at the \r\nhands of some of our traditional friends among the \r\nworld’s democracies. By now, those countries have \r\nbegun to recognize that we are serious about building a \r\nsustainable democracy that is racially blind, that offers \r\nequal opportunity, and that protects all citizens from \r\nthe tyranny of the majority. We need the support of the \r\nworld’s democracies, and we invite them to work with us \r\nin our quest to establish the kind of democratic system \r\nthat they enjoy. After 40 years of strife and instability, \r\nthe work of true and sustainable democracy is just \r\nbeginning, and we ask the international community to \r\nsupport us.\r\nWe have examined and redefined our world view \r\nto help forge productive, friendly relationships with \r\nall nations of goodwill. In 2011, Fiji opened three \r\nnew embassies in Brazil, Indonesia and South Africa. \r\nWe have expanded our diplomatic presence this year \r\nby opening embassies in the Republic of Korea and \r\nthe United Arab Emirates. We want to learn more, to \r\nexchange more, to develop more, to trade more, and \r\ncertainly to contribute more through active and robust \r\nengagement with other nations.\r\nIn the United Nations, Fiji pledges to work in the \r\nmost constructive manner possible, and to respect the \r\nideals of the United Nations Charter. That includes the \r\nInternational Labour Organization (ILO), with which \r\nwe are engaged at the present moment. The Fijian \r\nGovernment’s commitment to a future of equality and \r\nopportunity for all Fijians includes ensuring that the \r\nrights of working people are protected and extended. \r\nThe Constitutional Commission has received \r\nsubmissions from all sectors of Fijian society, including \r\ntrade unions and public employees. We expect the new \r\nconstitution to help us continue to build an environment \r\nthat promotes safe working conditions, protects \r\nworkers from arbitrary actions, and allows workers to \r\nform unions. We seek to ensure that unions can take \r\ncollective action, as directed by their member workers, \r\nand are subject only to restrictions that are generally \r\naccepted as protecting the public good. We also seek to \r\nprotect the rights of those workers who choose not to \r\naffiliate with unions.\r\nThe Fijian Government is committed to protecting \r\nworkers who are fortunate enough to have jobs and \r\nto ensuring that all workers receive fair wages. \r\nWe are equally committed to creating employment \r\n12-52408 15\r\nA/67/PV.17\r\nafford the luxury of falling into complacency. The \r\ndemand for just and strong responses is very real.\r\nThe change of regime in Libya and the ongoing \r\ngrievous conflict in Syria have presented the \r\ninternational community with the awkward dilemma of \r\nhaving to find a fair balance between resolving conflicts \r\npeacefully and the rule of law — in short, between \r\npeace and justice. It would appear that, in order to attain \r\na peaceful solution to a conflict or to end hostilities, \r\njustice must be sacrificed while those who have violated \r\nhuman rights go unpunished; or that, due to inflexible \r\napplication of international law, conflicts will continue \r\nforever. A fair balance must not allow either those who \r\nviolate human rights to go unpunished, or conflicts to \r\ncontinue endlessly. With regard to Syria, it is time to \r\nsupport open societies and political transitions that can \r\nguarantee a framework for democratic development. I \r\nwish to praise the commitment of the Secretary-General \r\nand Joint Special Representative Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi \r\nto finding a solution to the conflict in Syria. \r\nThe Secretary-General has said that people \r\nwant progress and solutions today. They want ideas, \r\nleadership and concrete hope for the future. The \r\nSecretary-General’s words accurately reflect what the \r\nworld expects from all Member States. We also need \r\nto maintain perspective, because if complacency is \r\ndangerous, so too are harsh criticism and pessimism. \r\nWhile the working methods of the United Nations \r\nsystem are far from optimal, we should not forget that \r\nthe reality of today seemed an unattainable dream a \r\ncentury ago. We should move on from talk of dreams \r\nto talk of ambition. We should move on from dreaming \r\nabout change to exerting the ambition to change. We \r\nshould move on from “I have a dream”, as stated by \r\nMartin Luther King, Jr., to speaking about the ambition \r\nthat we all share. \r\nIn his statement at the opening of the general debate \r\n(see A/67/PV.6), Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon rightly \r\nmentioned raising our levels of ambition. The step \r\nfrom dream to ambition needs perspective; dreaming \r\nrequires knowing only how we would like things to be, \r\nbut having and realizing ambition requires us to know \r\nhow far we are prepared to go, while bearing very \r\nmuch in mind the path travelled and everything to be \r\nexperienced along the way.\r\nIn that respect the United Nations and its system \r\nallow us to face the future with cautious optimism, as \r\nthe world has been better and more just with the presence \r\ncommitment as a fundamental value and linchpin \r\nof our political action, understood as a deep belief \r\nin the values of democracy, respect for human rights \r\nand the rule of law; as the assumption of individual \r\nresponsibilities for a common project; and ultimately \r\nas a desire for dialogue and understanding. It is in the \r\npursuit of that commitment and that balance — what \r\nwe might call the right balance — that the difficulty of \r\nGovernment resides. That is the case at home, in every \r\none of our States, and also in our shared home of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nA year ago in this Assembly, we echoed a phrase of \r\nthe then French President, who stated: “Let us choose \r\nthe path of compromise, which is neither renunciation \r\nnor repudiation, but which allows us to move forward, \r\nstep by step” (A/66/PV.11, p. 23). Indeed, on the path of \r\ncompromise and the right balance, we cannot and must \r\nnot abandon the defence of human rights, the rule of \r\nlaw and the most essential democratic values such as \r\nfreedom of expression. We cannot and should not deny \r\nrespect to others. \r\nHowever, establishing a fair balance does not mean \r\nconducting a balancing act. Indeed, that balance must \r\nbe based on strong principles. There can be no excuse \r\nfor violence, intolerance or impunity. President Obama \r\nwas right when he mentioned in this Hall that the \r\nrecent attacks on diplomatic missions were not solely \r\nan attack on the United States, but also an assault on the \r\nfoundations of the United Nations itself. There can be \r\nno excuse or impunity for such acts. \r\n(spoke in English)\r\nWe are all Chris Stevens. But what defines us is not \r\nhow we fall but how we rise again. We will stand by all \r\nChris Stevens as they rise to defend the ideals of the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n(spoke in Catalan)\r\nAllow me today to echo the words of the new \r\nPresident of the French Republic, François Hollande, \r\nCo-Prince of Andorra, who stated before this Assembly \r\nthat “The mission of the United Nations is to tackle \r\nthese challenges and to find strong and just responses to \r\nthem together.” (A/67/PV.6, p. 43) For over 65 years, the \r\nUnited Nations has been a reference for peace, justice \r\nand respect for human rights. Remarkable progress has \r\nindeed been observed in recent years. It is no less true, \r\nhowever, that the countries represented here cannot \r\n16 12-52408\r\nA/67/PV.17\r\nof the United Nations than without it. However, when \r\nwe look at its evolution, we realize that something is not \r\nquite right, as the evolution process has been fraught \r\nwith limitations, shortcomings and obstacles that the \r\ninternational community must address in its efforts to \r\nresolve conflicts peacefully and in accordance with \r\nthe law. The Secretary-General rightly emphasized \r\nhis new Education First initiative, which encourages \r\ndemocratic values, human rights and the rule of law. \r\nAnd those values can guarantee equal opportunity and \r\nsocial cohesion. \r\nDuring its forthcoming presidency of the Council of \r\nEurope, Andorra will prioritize education as a tool for \r\nencouraging democratic values, respect for human rights \r\nand the rule of law. Andorra is particularly sensitive \r\nto education, not only in the sphere of international \r\ncooperation, but also domestically, as it is aware that \r\nits unique, multicultural and multilingual educational \r\napproach, featuring three public systems — Andorran, \r\nFrench and Spanish — in a small society with its own \r\nidentity, has not been a problem, but rather an asset and \r\nan essential element of social cohesion.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nWe see that commitment to multiculturalism and \r\nmultilingualism within the francophone community. \r\nThe commitment to openness and exchange among \r\nindividuals is good and is far from self-absorption in \r\none’s own language or culture. Now is not the time \r\nfor self-absorption but rather for openness; it is time \r\nfor ambition and not protectionism. The work of the \r\nfrancophone community is deeply aligned with our \r\nvalues, and we will convene in Africa at the forthcoming \r\nSummit of the Francophonie to defend the spirit of \r\nopenness to democratic values and human rights.\r\n(spoke in Spanish)\r\nThat commitment to multiculturalism also belies \r\nthe strong bonds we feel with our Latin American \r\nfriends. Our involvement within the General Assembly \r\nin the preparatory work for the forthcoming Cadiz \r\nsummit, to be hosted by our dear neighbour Spain, \r\nshould also be viewed through the prism of openness \r\nand the defence of democratic values, human rights and \r\nthe rule of law. \r\n(spoke in Catalan)\r\nThe Principality of Andorra today reasserts its \r\ncommitment to the founding principles of the United \r\nNations: the promotion of peace, liberty, justice, \r\ndemocracy and human rights. Those are not utopian \r\nvalues and principles; quite the contrary, it would be \r\nunrealistic and unthinkable to seek to establish stability \r\nin the world with any other values. What is important \r\nis to come here today to proclaim not that Andorra \r\nhas one of the oldest and most stable parliaments and \r\npolitical systems on the planet, but that at the end of the \r\nthirteenth century its political system was consolidated \r\nin a very short period of time and in circumstances that \r\nwere far from ideal. In a very brief time span, the same \r\nsystem was again able to adapt to modern reality at the \r\nend of the twentieth century. In our country, indeed, it \r\nwas not until 1971 that women were entitled to vote. \r\nYet only 40 years later, in 2011 the people of Andorra \r\nelected a Parliament with the second-highest number of \r\nfemale representatives in the world. This is why I spoke \r\nearlier of viewing things from a perspective of process \r\nand evolution. \r\nHistory shows us that what appeared utopian \r\nnot long ago has become reality today. We should \r\nnot assume that things cannot change and cannot get \r\nbetter. The limits that the United Nations seems to have \r\nencountered after almost seven decades of existence \r\nwill be overcome one day, and today’s challenges will \r\nbe viewed as things of the past. The numerous countries \r\nthat form the international community have shown how \r\nrapidly things can change when there is a will to act. \r\nOne only has to take a look at the determination with \r\nwhich many of the members of this Assembly have \r\njoined forces and coordinated their policies to find \r\nsolutions to the grave financial and economic crisis that \r\nhas rocked the world over the last few years.\r\nThe need for rapid and profound change has also \r\narrived in Andorra. A year ago, we stated in our speech \r\nthat our country had one of the most closed economies \r\non the planet and that it posed significant barriers to \r\nforeign investment, as foreigners had to meet costly \r\nrequirements to attain full economic rights. Today, \r\nonly 12 months later, the Andorran economy is 100 per \r\ncent open to foreign capital, and every foreign resident \r\nis granted full economic rights from the first day of his \r\nor her residency. \r\nThe President took the Chair.\r\nEarlier, I referred to openness in a broad sense, \r\nbut today economic openness should enable us to \r\nrediscover the path of inclusive growth that has defined \r\nus, albeit now within an open and diversified economy \r\ngeared to the pursuit of competitiveness, innovation \r\n12-52408 17\r\nA/67/PV.17\r\nand general progress. This entire process has been \r\naccompanied by an updating of the Andorran model, \r\nwith an appropriate tax framework and a commitment \r\nto transparency towards the international community. \r\nThe whole process is based on the belief that recovery \r\nmeans not faint-hearted withdrawal, but rather the \r\nambition to open up to the world and a willingness to \r\ncompete. That conviction is the driving force behind \r\nthe implementation by the Principality of Andorra of \r\nsome of the most significant socioeconomic changes in \r\nits entire history.\r\nTwenty years ago, the United Nations pioneered \r\nthe promotion of sustainable development. When the \r\ninternational community met in Rio de Janeiro in \r\n1992, at what was called the Earth Summit, the need \r\nto consider sustainable growth became manifest and \r\nthe subject was tackled from a threefold economic, \r\nenvironmental and social perspective. The conclusions \r\nof that Rio Summit, to which scant or no attention has \r\nbeen paid, are today so topical that the United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development, held in Rio \r\nin June, stressed the very same policies. However, \r\nalthough 20 years ago sustainability might have seemed \r\nsolely an environmental issue, experience has shown \r\nus that public finance, economic growth and our \r\nmodel of social protections must also be sustainable. \r\nThe challenge of sustainability is now, more than ever, \r\nshared and interdisciplinary.\r\nMany years ago, the United Nations was created \r\nin the belief that maintaining peace and security in \r\nthe world was unrealistic without advances in human \r\nrights, in international law and in democracy. There \r\ncan be no lasting peace or security without liberty or \r\njustice. More recently, we have all learned not only \r\nthat separating democracy from economic progress \r\nmakes no sense, but also that it is foolish to believe \r\nin unrestrained, unlimited growth at any cost, the \r\nconsequences of which we are still feeling. \r\nA few days ago, at the reception for the diplomatic \r\ncorps, our Episcopal Co-Prince, Joan Enric Vives \r\nSicilia, noted the dangerous tendency to prioritize \r\nhaving rather than being. We must learn the lessons of \r\nrecent years, in which the desire to have everything we \r\nwanted too often led us to forget to pursue everything \r\nwe needed. We must build a more sustainable, more \r\ninterrelated and more co-responsible world in order to \r\nlay the foundations for more secure economic growth. \r\nA pledge to progress and prosperity also means support \r\nfor democracy, for security and for peace.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in \r\nthe general debate for this meeting.\r\nI shall now call on those representatives who wish \r\nto speak in exercise of the right of reply. May I remind \r\nmembers that statements made in exercise of the right \r\nof reply are limited to 10 minutes for the first statement \r\nand to five minutes for the second, and should be made \r\nby delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Llorentty Solíz (Plurinational State of Bolivia) \r\n(spoke in Spanish): Earlier today, the Foreign Minister \r\nof Chile referred to the address to the Assembly made \r\nby the Constitutional President of the Plurinational \r\nState of Bolivia, Evo Morales Ayma. Bolivia cannot and \r\nwill not remain silent about the series of inaccuracies, \r\nomissions and falsehoods that were presented to the \r\nAssembly as facts. \r\nThe Foreign Minister of Chile stated that “Bolivia \r\nhas no right to claim sovereign access to the sea” and \r\nthat “Chile has fully met its obligations” under the \r\nTreaty of Peace and Friendship of 1904 (A/66/PV.15). \r\nWhat he failed to say is that in 1879 Chile invaded \r\nBolivian territory, with the help of transnational \r\ncompanies, for the oligarchic purposes of appropriating \r\nfor itself natural resources belonging to Bolivians. He \r\nalso omitted to say that the result of that invasion was \r\nan unjust and imposed treaty that has not been fully \r\nimplemented. \r\nIt is unjust in that it deprives a country of the \r\nexercise of many of its rights and has left a deep wound \r\nin the heart of South America in an attempt to acquire \r\nrights by the use of force. The Treaty was imposed \r\nbecause it was concluded through the use of force, \r\nnot with free consent but under threat. The Treaty is \r\nunfulfilled because the Republic of Chile has not \r\nimplemented its provisions. To cite one example, the \r\nrestrictions on free transit and the nearly decade-long \r\nclosure on the Chilean side of the Arica-La Paz railway \r\nare, among other things, undeniable evidence of Chile’s \r\nnon-observance of the provisions of the Treaty with the \r\nState of Bolivia. \r\nThe Plurinational State of Bolivia rejects the \r\nsubjective views put forward by Chile about events in \r\nthe League of Nations in 1921 and at the forty-second \r\nGeneral Assembly of the Organization of American \r\nStates. Neither that organization nor its Judicial \r\nCommittee made a negative evaluation of the basis \r\nfor Bolivia’s claim. Bolivia categorically rejects any \r\nstatement to the effect that the League of Nations or \r\n18 12-52408\r\nA/67/PV.17\r\nMr. Errázuriz (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): I must \r\nrespond on behalf of the State of Chile to the assertions \r\nmade by the delegation of the Plurinational State of \r\nBolivia, which is seeking once again to distract the \r\nattention of the Assembly towards issues that are \r\noutside its competence by invoking my country’s name. \r\nChile is a State that respects international law \r\nand the sovereign equality of  all members of the \r\ninternational community. It actively cooperates \r\nwith the international human rights system and has \r\ndemonstrated its support for international peace and \r\nsecurity, in particular through its peacekeeping troops. \r\nMy Government cannot allow the general debate \r\nto be used as a pretext to revisit history and existing \r\ntreaties and to distort the context of our relationship \r\nwith Bolivia. We have offered signs of our willingness \r\nto engage in broad dialogue. Our physical integration \r\nprocess with Bolivia, in which the free transit regime is \r\nunimpeded and duty free, has achieved positive results. \r\nWe have granted unilateral benefits that serve Bolivia’s \r\nforeign trade and all of its inhabitants. At the forty-\r\nsecond regular session of the General Assembly of the \r\nOrganization of American States, held in Cochabamba \r\nin June, no country indicated that this subject should \r\nbe addressed within an international organization or \r\non the basis of resolutions that have been superceded \r\nby subsequent developments. The organization \r\nunderscored the bilateral nature of the matter. \r\nPresident Morales Ayma, in an interview given to \r\nEl Mercurio, published on 23 March 2011, provided an \r\nextensive overview of the dialogue process in which he \r\nwas engaged at the time with the Chilean Government, \r\nexpressing his satisfaction and confidence that the \r\nprocess would end successfully. For unexplained \r\nreasons, on the same day he indicated in an address \r\ngiven in his country, and using offensive and hostile \r\nlanguage, that the negotiations were over and that \r\nBolivia would litigate its maritime aspirations. There is \r\na public record of all he said. \r\nChile once again reaffirms its comprehensive \r\ncommitment to the rule of international law. Respect \r\nfor and compliance with international treaties and the \r\npeaceful coexistence between States are foundations of \r\nour policy. Nothing shall lead my country to stray from \r\nthat duty, and we hope that Bolivia will also return to \r\nthe bilateral approach. \r\nMr. Ri Tong Il (Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea): Today, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nany other judicial or multilateral organ of that time \r\nor of ours has denied the right of Bolivia to free and \r\nsovereign access to the Pacific Ocean and its coast. \r\nThe Plurinational State of Bolivia rejects the \r\nassertion of the Government of the Republic of Chile \r\nthat the Constitution of the Plurinational State of \r\nBolivia adopted in 2009 includes provisions that \r\ncontravene international law.  We maintain that, on \r\nthe contrary, those provisions are in full conformity \r\nwith international law, even as we reaffirm our right \r\nto a sovereign coastal outlet to the Pacific Ocean, and \r\nreassert the commitment of the Bolivian State to the \r\nmechanisms for the peaceful settlement of disputes set \r\nout in Article 33 of the United Nations Charter. \r\nFor decades, Bolivia has sought to resolve the matter \r\nthrough dialogue. However, in 2010 Chile rejected the \r\nattempts at reconciliation made in a 13-point agenda, \r\nwhich included useful and feasible proposals to resolve \r\nthe injustice. Chile has stated that our dispute is a \r\nstrictly bilateral matter, but we recall that there are 11 \r\nresolutions of the Organization of American States in \r\nforce, among which we highlight resolution 426 of the \r\nGeneral Assembly of the Organization of American \r\nStates, of 31 October 1979, a century after the invasion, \r\nwhich states that \r\n“it is of continuing hemispheric interest that an \r\nequitable solution be found whereby Bolivia will \r\nobtain appropriate sovereign access to the Pacific \r\nOcean, and (…) resolves to recommend to the \r\nstates most directly concerned with this problem \r\nthat they open negotiations for the purpose of \r\nproviding Bolivia with a free and sovereign \r\nterritorial connection with the Pacific Ocean. \r\nThese negotiations shall take into account the rights \r\nand interests of the parties involved, and might \r\nconsider, among other things, the inclusion of a \r\nport area for integrated multinational development, \r\nas well as the Bolivian proposal that no territorial \r\ncompensation be included.”\r\nWe believe that recent statements that use the term \r\n“force” are incompatible with the spirit not only of the \r\nsession of the General Assembly that has begun, whose \r\ntheme is the “Bringing about adjustment or settlement \r\nof international disputes or situations by peaceful \r\nmeans”, but also runs counter to the principles of the \r\nOrganization. As President Morales Ayma stated in his \r\naddress to the Assembly, this is no longer the time of \r\nintra-regional or foreign colonization. \r\n12-52408 19\r\nA/67/PV.17\r\nare a threat to North-East Asia. That is not at all true. \r\nAs far as the threat is concerned, the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea has a different perspective. \r\nAs soon as they came to power in 2008, the incumbent \r\nSouth Korean authorities totally rejected the Joint \r\nDeclaration adopted twice at the Inter-Korean summit \r\nmeetings in 2000 and 2007, driving the situation into \r\nits worst state ever in the history of the divided Korean \r\nnation. Those two Inter-Korean summit meetings and \r\nDeclarations were regarded as a reflection of the hope \r\nfor peace and unification of the entire Korean nation \r\nand international community. It was demonstrated by \r\nthe Assembly’s unanimous adoption of a resolution \r\nin this very Hall, giving great hope and expectations \r\nfor the eventual unification of the country and lasting \r\npeace on the Korean peninsula and in the region.\r\nMoreover, South Korea did not hesitate to join in \r\nhostile activities and military manoeuvres with the \r\nUnited States. Those two countries have not hesitated \r\nto engage every year in large-scale joint military \r\nexercises. For them, it is everyday business to threaten \r\nand challenge the desire of the region and the entire \r\ninternational community for peace, security and détente \r\nin the Korean peninsula. Those military exercises are \r\nbased on the so-called joint operation plans 5029 and \r\n5030; they have various numbers and code names. They \r\npresuppose the occupation of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea, followed by military rule. They \r\nhave had this war scenario ready for some years now. \r\nA typical example of that was the operation held \r\njust last month by South Korea and the United States. It \r\nwas the largest ever. Over 400,000 troops and different \r\ntypes of sophisticated weapons were involved. All \r\nthe troops of the various units were involved, heavily \r\ntrained and fully ready to cross into the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea at any time once the order \r\nwas given. That means that the United States and South \r\nKorea are fully ready to cross the demarcation line to \r\nattack the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. That \r\nis the reality.\r\nConcerning the missile issue, again, South Korea did \r\nnot hesitate to join in categorizing the satellite launch, \r\nwhich was entirely legitimate under international law, \r\nas a ballistic missile launch. Never before in the history \r\nof the Security Council has a satellite been accused \r\nof being a ballistic missile. The United States is the \r\nlargest producer of missiles and the largest launcher \r\nof satellites, but the Security Council has never taken \r\naction on that issue. Only the Democratic People’s \r\nSouth Korea made a statement touching on the nuclear \r\nissue of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea \r\nand the so-called human rights in the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea. Concerning those issues, \r\nthe delegation of the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea totally rejects those allegations as provocative \r\nand unsubstantiated statements with no grounds and \r\nconsiders them to be misleading with regard to reality \r\nand the facts  and distorting of the truth. In that regard, \r\nthe delegation of the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea would like to clarify its position. \r\nFirst, with regard to the origins of the nuclear issue \r\non the Korean peninsula, the first nuclear weapon \r\nwas introduced by the largest nuclear-weapon State, \r\nthe United States. The United States did not hesitate \r\nto bring and deploy the first nuclear weapon in South \r\nKorea in 1957. In the 1970s, again the United States did \r\nnot hesitate to increase the number of nuclear weapons \r\nto over 1,000.\r\nWith regard to the policy or doctrine about how \r\nto use nuclear weapons, in the 1950s former President \r\nTruman again did not hesitate to give orders to prepare \r\nto use the strategic force of nuclear weapons during the \r\ntime of the Korean War. Again, the Force Commander \r\nat the time, General MacArthur, did not hesitate to \r\nopenly blackmail the people of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea and the entire Korean nation by \r\nsaying that he would spray radioactive nuclear powder. \r\nHe said that only after 120 years would living things \r\nbegin to grow again. In 2002, the Bush Administration \r\nlisted the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea as \r\npart of the axis of evil, together with Iran and Iraq, \r\nand again the Bush Administration did not hesitate to \r\nput the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea on the \r\nlist for pre-emptive nuclear first strike, together with \r\nIran, Iraq, Syria, China and Russia. In 2010, the current \r\nAdministration again did not hesitate to clarify its \r\nposition that the non-nuclear weapon States, with the \r\nexception of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea \r\nand Iran, would be given so-called security assurances. \r\nThat means that the United States will continue to \r\npre-emptively target the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea and Iran. All those facts very clearly indicate \r\nthat the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea has \r\nbeen living under the direct threat of nuclear weapons \r\nand blackmail. \r\nSecondly, there is the issue of threat. In its \r\nstatement, South Korea alleged that the nuclear \r\nweapons of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea \r\n20 12-52408\r\nA/67/PV.17\r\nfabricated name used in the statement of the Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the United Arab Emirates, is \r\ntotally groundless and absolutely unacceptable, and \r\nbears no legal or political value.\r\nMr. Llorentty Solíz (Plurinational State of Bolivia) \r\n(spoke in Spanish): The Plurinational State of Bolivia \r\nwishes to exercise its right to reply in order to respond \r\nonce again to the distortion presented by the delegation \r\nof the Republic of Chile.\r\nThe Chilean delegation referred to 23 March. That \r\nis the date on which the Bolivian people painfully \r\ncommemorate the loss of our coast as the result \r\nof an invasion and the use of force. On that day, we \r\ncommemorate the death of one of our heroes in defence \r\nof Bolivian territory at the bridge of Topáter. On that \r\nday, young people, boys and girls, take to the streets in \r\nprocessions in Bolivia, clamouring for the return of our \r\nsovereign access to the Pacific Ocean.\r\nUndeniably, Chile has failed to comply with the \r\nprovisions of the 1904 Treaty of Peace and Friendship \r\nbetween Chile and Bolivia. Not only does the legal \r\nfree transit regime not exist, but in fact difficulties and \r\nobstacles have been raised that have largely voided the \r\nTreaty. By way of example, we reiterate the case of the \r\nArica-La Paz railway, in addition to the limitations \r\nimposed on the transport of goods and persons to the \r\nports of the Pacific Ocean.\r\nReference has been made to an attempt to revise \r\nhistory, but what prevails in the scenario is the need \r\nto rectify the injustices that have been committed \r\nthroughout the history of our people and that continue to \r\nwreak suffering upon individuals. No military victory, \r\nno degree of arrogance grants unlimited rights when \r\nthey are the result of force, nor should any treaty that \r\nis imposed by force or threat be considered immutable \r\nover time, especially when it exercises a stranglehold \r\non an entire population. For decades now, Bolivia has \r\nunderscored the need for dialogue, but to date, after \r\nmore than 100 years since that invasion, the dialogue \r\nhas received no tangible response acknowledging that, \r\nas stipulated in the resolution of the Organization of \r\nAmerican States, there is a need to restore sovereign \r\nmaritime access to the Plurinational State of Bolivia. \r\nBolivia shall continue to raise the issue in all \r\ninternational forums, to the extent permitted by \r\ninternational law, in order to demand the return of its \r\nmaritime outlet based on reason, international law and \r\nRepublic of Korea was blamed, and South Korea was \r\nhell-bent on joining in against the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea.\r\nThirdly, as far as human rights are concerned, the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea totally rejects \r\nwhat they call the resolution on the human rights \r\nsituation in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. \r\nThe most serious violator of human rights in the world \r\nis none other than South Korea. The incumbent South \r\nKorean authorities are using a dictatorship under what \r\nthey call the updated national security law. It offers \r\nno guarantee whatsoever of political freedom, social \r\nfreedom or democracy.\r\nIn conclusion, the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea delegation once again clarifies the position \r\nthat its possession of a nuclear weapon is due to the \r\nblackmailing and hostilities of the United States \r\nand South Korea, which threaten the survival and \r\nsovereignty of the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea. That is the stark reality in the Korean peninsula.\r\nMr. Sahraei (Islamic Republic of Iran): The \r\nIranian islands of Abu Musa, Greater Tunb and \r\nLesser Tunb are an integral and eternal part of Iranian \r\nterritory. The Government of the Islamic Republic of \r\nIran categorically rejects any claim to the contrary, \r\nincluding the baseless claim raised in today’s meeting. \r\nIran underlines that the measures undertaken on those \r\nislands by the Iranian authorities are fully based on \r\nthe sovereign rights of Iran and the principle of its \r\nterritorial integrity, as enshrined in the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations and the provisions of international law. \r\nWhile stressing the importance of the brotherly \r\nand good-neighbourly relations that exist between Iran \r\nand its neighbouring countries in the Persian Gulf, \r\nwe continue to believe that constructive negotiations \r\nbetween the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran \r\nand the relevant officials of the United Arab Emirates \r\nwill lead to the further expansion of relations in various \r\nfields and help to remove any misunderstanding \r\nthat may arise with regard to the implementation of \r\nthe arrangements emanating from the documents \r\nexchanged in 1971 on that issue.\r\nMoreover, the Islamic Republic of Iran wishes to \r\nstress that the only historically correct and universally \r\nrecognized name for the body of water between Iran \r\nand the Arabian peninsula, as emphasized by the United \r\nNations itself, is the Persian Gulf. Accordingly, any use \r\nof a fabricated name for that body of water, including the \r\n12-52408 21\r\nA/67/PV.17\r\ninternational law, which Chile cannot accept and which \r\nare not valid.\r\nMr. Al-Yafei (United Arab Emirates) (spoke in \r\nArabic): I must exercise my right of reply to the false \r\nand illegal claims made by the representative of the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran concerning the United Arab \r\nEmirates islands of Abu Musa, Greater Tunb and \r\nLesser Tunb. My country, which has never renounced \r\nits sovereign, legitimate and historic rights to those \r\nthree islands, which have been militarily occupied by \r\nIran since 1971, categorically rejects all the erroneous \r\nIranian allegations, which are contrary to all of the \r\nhistorical and legal facts and documents affirming the \r\nsovereignty of the United Arab Emirates over those \r\nthree islands. \r\nMy country categorically rejects, on the basis of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations and the provisions of \r\ninternational law, all of the illegal measures that Iran \r\nhas taken with respect to those islands. We therefore \r\nappeal anew to the international community to urge \r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran to engage in unconditional \r\nbilateral negotiations with the United Arab Emirates, in \r\naccordance with the United Nations Charter, in order to \r\nput a definitive end to the occupation of the three islands \r\nthat belong to the United Arab Emirates, or alternatively \r\nto request arbitration before the International Court of \r\nJustice, as a number of countries have done in dealing \r\nwith similar cases. \r\nWe again emphasize that the strengthening of \r\nrelations of cooperation between the States of the region \r\nand Iran, and the promotion of stability and economic \r\nprosperity in the Arabian Gulf region require Iran to \r\ncommit to establishing good-neighbourly relations \r\nbased on the principles of respect for the sovereignty \r\nand independence of States, their territorial integrity \r\nand non-interference in their internal affairs.\r\nMr. Sahraei (Islamic Republic of Iran): Based on \r\na vast variety of historical documents, it is perfectly \r\nevident that throughout history the three islands in \r\nquestion have been an integral part of Iranian territory. \r\nAs has been emphasized regularly, the territorial \r\nintegrity and sovereignty of the Islamic Republic of \r\nIran over the islands is not negotiable. In that regard, my \r\ncountry stands ready to have bilateral discussions with \r\nthe relevant officials of the United Arab Emirates in \r\norder to remove any concern or any misunderstanding \r\nthat may arise regarding the implementation of the \r\njustice. The Political Constitution of our State referred \r\nto by the delegation of Chile states that \r\n“[t]he effective solution to the maritime dispute \r\nthrough peaceful means and the full exercise of \r\nsovereignty over that territory are permanent and \r\ninalienable objectives of the Bolivian State”.\r\nIn recent years, President Morales Ayma has \r\nupdated the Assembly on the setbacks or progress made \r\nin the bilateral process. Unfortunately, the bilateral \r\ndialogue was unilaterally called off by Chile. I reiterate \r\nthat Bolivia naturally reserves the right to apply to all \r\ninternational and jurisdictional forums that permit it to \r\nregain its sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean.\r\nMr. Errázuriz (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): The \r\ndelegation of Bolivia has a distorted vision not only of \r\nhistory, but also of the facts. The 1904 Treaty was signed \r\n20 years after the ceasefire. I reiterate that it was not \r\nChile that called off the dialogue with Bolivia — quite \r\nthe contrary. In spite of those circumstances, we have \r\ncontinued to appeal to Bolivia for understanding, as did \r\nour Minister for Foreign Affairs today. \r\nThe representative of Bolivia suggested that Chile \r\nhas not complied with the 1904 Treaty. The General \r\nAssembly should know that the Arica-La Paz railway \r\nto which he referred was practically destroyed after it \r\nhad been operated by a Bolivian company, which made \r\nit necessary not only to rehabilitate the rails themselves \r\nbut to clean up the contamination that resulted from \r\nthe transport of minerals. Bolivia knows that Chile has \r\ninvested tens of millions of dollars in recent years to \r\nensure that the railway shall become operative once \r\nagain this year.\r\nSimilarly, we must underscore that the President \r\nof Bolivia, when addressing the General Assembly \r\n(see A/67/PV.11), indicated with pride that his country’s \r\nreserves had risen for the first time $13 billion. We \r\nmight therefore indicate that, without a doubt, a \r\nsignificant portion of that increase in its reserves is \r\ndue to Bolivia’s foreign trade, which is largely carried \r\nout using Chilean ports, precisely on the basis of the \r\n1904 Treaty and on the free transit facilities that Chile \r\nprovides. \r\nChile remains prepared to resume dialogue, \r\nbut without preconditions demanding, without legal \r\nfoundation, a sovereign maritime access, or that \r\nrely on constitutional provisions that run counter to \r\n22 12-52408\r\nA/67/PV.17\r\nI think that it is obvious that despite Iran’s claims \r\nto have the right to militarily occupy the territory \r\nof another State, and given the fact that Iran refuses \r\nto enter into direct negotiations on the question of \r\nits occupation of the Emirate islands and to submit \r\nthe question to the International Court of Justice, it \r\nobviously cannot offer any legal or historical document \r\nto substantiate its allegations. That is well known, and \r\nIran is continuing to exercise a fait accompli policy \r\nby maintaining its illegal military occupation of three \r\nislands of the United Arab Emirates.  \r\nThe meeting rose at 8.55 p.m. \r\nagreement concluded between the two countries in \r\n1971 on the issue.\r\nMr. Al-Yafei (United Arab Emirates) (spoke in \r\nArabic): I am taking the f loor once again in exercise of \r\nmy country’s right of reply to respond to the claim made \r\nby the representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran \r\nthat his country possesses legal documents regarding \r\nits occupation of the three islands of the United Arab \r\nEmirates. If that were true, I would ask Iran to table \r\nthose documents and to bring the matter to the attention \r\nof the International Court of Justice, which would then \r\nexamine Iran’s claims and allegations. \r\n"
