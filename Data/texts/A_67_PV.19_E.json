Since the \r\nfirst session was convened in Central Hall Westminster \r\nin London in January 1946 until the calling to order of \r\nthis new session, precisely 66 years and eight months \r\nhave elapsed. The General Assembly is now two  thirds \r\nof a century old — two thirds of a century during which \r\nthe Assembly and the planet have been witness to both \r\ngreat achievements and grave injustices and have seen \r\nboth human triumphs and human tragedies. \r\nIt has been two thirds of a century during which \r\nthe peoples of the world made powerful progress. We \r\nhave launched humans into orbit. We have mapped the \r\nhuman genome and unlocked various mysteries of life \r\nand science. We have pulled hundreds of millions of \r\npeople out of abject poverty. And yet it has also been \r\ntwo thirds of a century during which we suffered deep \r\ndisappointment — the worst incidents of terrorism \r\nin the world’s history, including the largest terror \r\nattack ever, here in New York on 11 September 2001; \r\nthe failure to anticipate and prevent genocide in \r\nCambodia and Rwanda; and the stubborn persistence \r\nof totalitarianism and despotism. Some developments \r\nwere predictable. Others no one foresaw, and nobody \r\ncould have scripted. \r\nAs we stand on the threshold of the next third of a \r\ncentury, we are reminded of that old adage, “the only \r\nconstant is change”.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nThe only constant is change. Indeed, our world \r\ncontinues to change and at a rapid pace in all domains. \r\nAt the geopolitical level, change means a rebalancing \r\nof power and new opportunities. Not since the Cold \r\nWar has so much change occurred so quickly. In \r\nthese turbulent times, when change can be swift and \r\nunexpected, it is all the more important that we focus \r\nwith precision on the constants that remain true. \r\n(spoke in English)\r\nCanada is a maritime nation bordered by three \r\noceans. Please allow me, then, to use a nautical \r\nUnited Nations A/67/PV.19\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-seventh session\r\n19th plenary meeting\r\nMonday, 1 October 2012, 10 a.m.\r\nNew York\r\nOffi cial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Jeremić . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Serbia)\r\n2 12-52557\r\nA/67/PV.19\r\nanalogy. At one time, sailors would navigate by the \r\nNorth Star. Winds and currents would shift, storms \r\nwould blow, ships might even veer off course, but the \r\nNorth Star remained fixed — as a guide and as a goal. \r\nIn the same way, the only way for us to navigate the \r\nseas of change is to follow fixed principles and chart a \r\ncourse for immutable goals. In our opinion, those goals \r\nare the well-being, prosperity, security and dignity of \r\nhumankind, objectives that are reflected in the purposes \r\ninscribed in Article 1 of the United Nations Charter. \r\nWe owe it to those we serve — to the people of this \r\nplanet — to maintain consistent effort in that direction.\r\nThey will judge our success by how well we further \r\nthe ends of prosperity, security, and human dignity. One \r\nmeasures results by measuring the results themselves, \r\nnot by weighing best efforts, not by counting good \r\nintentions, and not by calculating inputs. I do not \r\npropose, therefore, to dwell extensively on reform of \r\nthe United Nations. This Organization is not a goal; it \r\nis merely the means to accomplish goals. However, the \r\nUnited Nations must spend less time looking at itself, \r\nand more time focused on the problems that demand its \r\nattention. I make that observation in a constructive and \r\npositive spirit.\r\nCanada was an original signatory to the Charter, \r\nand is today the seventh-largest contributor to the \r\nbudget of this important Organization. Our commitment \r\nto the United Nations has been tested and is proven. \r\nOur commitment to the United Nations is important. \r\nNevertheless, because of our commitment to this body, \r\nwe cannot and will not participate in endless, fruitless \r\ninward-looking exercises.\r\nCanada’s Permanent Mission to the United Nations \r\nwill henceforth devote primary attention to what the \r\nUnited Nations is achieving, not to how the United \r\nNations arranges its affairs. The United Nations spends \r\ntoo much time on itself. It must now look outward. The \r\npreoccupation with procedure and process must yield \r\nto substance and results. If the United Nations focuses \r\non the achievement of goals — such as prosperity, \r\nsecurity and human dignity — then reform will take \r\ncare of itself. As the international community sets its \r\nsights on a post-2015 development framework, it should \r\nnot forget the work that remains to be done and the \r\ncommitments it has made.\r\nThe United Nations Commission on Information \r\nand Accountability for Women’s and Children’s Health, \r\nco-chaired by Canada’s Prime Minister, Stephen \r\nHarper, and President Jakaya Kikwete of the United \r\nRepublic of Tanzania, is the type of initiative that \r\nCanada would like to see more of in the future, and its \r\nrecommendations need to be integrated into a post-2015 \r\nframework.\r\nThe Preamble to the Charter of the United Nations \r\nreflects our collective determination to achieve “better \r\nstandards of life” for all humankind. It sets as a goal \r\n“the economic and social advancement of all peoples”. \r\nThat is no mean ambition. Those of us who recognize \r\na Creator accept the responsibility to use the Creator’s \r\ngifts to improve the well-being of all. Openness and \r\nengagement are vital to progress and prosperity. Since \r\nbefore recorded history, societies have reached out to \r\ntheir neighbours and beyond. As soon as human beings \r\ninvented transport, we invented trade, exchanging not \r\njust the fruits of the Earth, but also goods, practices and \r\nideas. Informed by our successes and failures — that \r\nis, having benefited from engagement and having paid \r\nthe price of isolation — humankind has learned several \r\nlessons. We cannot develop understanding by building \r\nwalls between cultures. We cannot achieve prosperity \r\nby erecting walls between economies. And we cannot \r\nadvance a people by putting walls between them and \r\nthe State.\r\nIt is no longer necessary for humankind to endlessly \r\ndebate how to make people better off. There is no \r\nspecial alchemy required. Blessed with the benefit of \r\nhuman experience, we know what produces prosperity: \r\nfree trade among open societies operating under \r\ntransparent, consistent and fair rules. As Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon recently wrote, “engaging in the \r\nworld is the best path to a better future”. \r\nThe fight for the economic and social advancement \r\nof all peoples is manifested in the struggle for open \r\nmarkets, open society and open-mindedness. It is a \r\nstruggle in which Canada is decidedly not neutral. We \r\nrecognize that the well-being of Canadians depends \r\nboth on openness at home and on openness to the world. \r\nCanadians know, from experience, the connection \r\nbetween trade and prosperity. After all, in order to \r\nsupport the world’s tenth-largest economy with only \r\nthe world’s thirty-sixth-largest population, we must be \r\na trading nation. We are expanding trade at a rate of \r\nunparalleled ambition, and consequently we are looking \r\nfor partners. But we fully recognize that sustained trade \r\nrequires stability and security.\r\nThe United Nations will also be judged by how \r\nwell it advances the security of humankind. The goal of \r\nsecurity is not separate from the objective of well-being. \r\n12-52557 3\r\nA/67/PV.19\r\nchemical weapons remains secure against possible use \r\nor proliferation by those who would do evil.\r\nWhen the post-Al-Qadhafi Libya declared its \r\nwillingness to destroy previously unknown stockpiles, \r\nCanada stepped in and provided $6 million to the \r\nOrganization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons \r\nin order to achieve that vital objective. Until such an \r\nopportunity arises in Syria, Canada stands ready \r\nto assist neighbouring States in taking measures to \r\nreduce the threat of the proliferation of those terrible \r\nweapons. Until that time, Canada continues to call for \r\nan immediate end to the violence. Al-Assad must be \r\nreplaced by a new order that protects Syria’s territorial \r\nintegrity and all the rights of each and every citizen. \r\nI have seen the despair of the Syrian people first \r\nhand on the Jordanian border, where a little girl heart-\r\nwrenchingly told me that all she wanted to do was to go \r\nhome. That experience will no doubt leave a lasting scar \r\non the children caught in the middle of the tragedy. We \r\nmust ensure that they have the opportunity for a better \r\nlife — for a life free of fear and full of opportunity. \r\nI pledge that Canada will work to address the urgent \r\nhumanitarian crises wrought by the violence of the past \r\n18 months. It behoves all Member States in a position \r\nto do so to improve conditions for the Syrian civilians \r\naffected by their great struggle against tyranny in \r\npursuit of dignity.\r\nToday, the most significant threat to global peace \r\nand security remains the regime in Iran. It refuses to \r\ncomply with Security Council resolutions. It routinely \r\nthreatens the very existence of the State of Israel. It \r\nfoments hatred against the Jewish people and incites \r\ngenocide. It provides aid, comfort and support to \r\nterrorist groups. It is guilty of the widespread and \r\nmassive repression of the human rights of its own people, \r\nincluding gays, lesbians and religious minorities.\r\nA nuclear Iran would embolden an already reckless \r\nregime and would perpetuate a very destabilizing \r\nfactor not just for an already fragile region, but also \r\nfor the entire planet. The Government of Canada has \r\nnot only formally listed the Iranian regime as a State \r\nsponsor of terrorism under Canadian law, but we have \r\nalso suspended diplomatic relations. Some may ask \r\nwhy a country committed to openness and engagement \r\nwould suspend relations. We do not take such decisions \r\nlightly.\r\nOn a practical level, the regime’s blatant disregard \r\nfor the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations \r\nSecurity is, after all, a vital part of people’s well-being. \r\nOnce again, openness and engagement are important \r\nmeans of achieving that goal. While there may at times \r\nbe tension in the means of execution, there exists no \r\nfundamental conflict between national security and the \r\nopen society; both seek to protect the same values, the \r\nsame rights and the same freedoms.\r\nIt is not enough for a society to protect its own \r\nsecurity. Global security affects all of us as members \r\nof the global community. Or, as Nelson Mandela \r\neloquently put it, “freedom would be meaningless \r\nwithout security in the home and in the streets”. Thus, \r\nour freedom is strengthened when others are free, and \r\nour liberty is diminished so long as any of our brothers \r\nor sisters are imprisoned by fear. Because a threat to \r\none is a threat to all, our security is enhanced when we \r\ncooperate to protect fragile democracies or to block the \r\nforces of instability.\r\nThe crisis in Syria is a test of this Organization’s \r\nability to achieve results. While the brutal and repressive \r\nregime of Bashar Al-Assad continues the slaughter of \r\nits own people, the United Nations continues to fail to \r\nimpose binding sanctions that would stem the crimson \r\ntide of that bloody assault. Until the last moment of \r\nrecorded time, the world will remember and history will \r\njudge Member States that are allowing the atrocities to \r\ncontinue.\r\nMany people of the planet, including many of the \r\ncitizens whom we represent, cannot understand why \r\nthis Organization — despite the sound and fury of \r\ndebate in this great Assembly — has been unable to \r\ntake concrete steps. Some ask, “What business is it \r\nof ours?” Our citizens would argue that the business \r\nis our common humanity, and our mandate is the \r\nstrengthening of humanity’s bonds. It is difficult \r\nto fault their logic. The late Martin Luther King Jr. \r\nonce said: “He who passively accepts evil is as much \r\ninvolved in it as he who helps to perpetrate it. He who \r\naccepts evil without protesting against it is really \r\ncooperating with it”. And if the collective interest in \r\nour shared humanity does not motivate us to act, then \r\nthe self-interest of our own security should. After all, \r\na stockpile of chemical and biological weapons does \r\nnot respect national sovereignty or recognize territorial \r\nintegrity. Who among us would be secure if the \r\nchemical and biological weapons of another Member \r\nState fell into the wrong hands? That is why Canada \r\ncalls on the Syrian regime to ensure that its stockpile of \r\n4 12-52557\r\nA/67/PV.19\r\ncreated real and legitimate concern for the safety and \r\nsecurity of our civilian diplomats. But there is also a great \r\nprinciple at stake. While Canada prizes engagement \r\nand open relations, there can be no open engagement \r\nwith a regime that dishonours its word, repudiates \r\nits commitments and threatens to perpetuate crimes \r\nagainst humanity. Canada’s philosophy is captured in \r\nthe wisdom of Dag Hammarskjöld, the second United \r\nNations Secretary-General, killed 51 years ago while \r\nfighting for peace and justice. He advised: “Never, for \r\nthe sake of peace and quiet, deny your own experience \r\nor convictions”. That is why Canada has imposed some \r\nof the toughest economic sanctions against the Iranian \r\nregime. \r\nHowever, let me be absolutely clear. Our quarrel \r\nis not with the people of Iran, but with the regime, \r\nwhich aims to silence their voices. Canada urges Iran \r\nto comply with its international nuclear obligations and \r\nto cease sensitive enrichment activities. We support \r\nthe process of the five plus one group of countries. \r\nIran needs to seize the opportunity provided by the \r\ninternational community and negotiate in good faith \r\nby showing demonstrable progress and by meeting its \r\nnuclear obligations.\r\nThe Iranian regime still has the chance to redeem \r\nitself. In fact, I encourage Iran to follow the example \r\nof some of its neighbours, some of whom Canada has \r\nsupported in building nuclear energy programmes for \r\npeaceful purposes. We will continue to work closely \r\nwith the United States, the European Union and \r\nother allies to put pressure on Iran to comply with its \r\nimportant international nuclear obligations. Rather than \r\naccept as inevitable the conflict that Iran seems intent \r\non provoking, Canada seeks a peaceful alternative. Iran \r\nmust act immediately to stop all enrichment and must \r\nabandon technology that could be used for weapons. \r\nIran is testing the will of the international community \r\nto its utmost. That, too, must end.\r\nThe world’s security is closely linked to the third \r\ngoal that should animate this Organization, namely, \r\nprotecting the dignity and worth of every person by \r\nupholding and protecting fundamental freedoms. The \r\ngreat poet Kahlil Gibran inspired us to remember that \r\nsafeguarding the rights of others is the most noble and \r\nbeautiful goal of a human being. \r\nThat principle is not simply a question of beliefs and \r\nvalues. It includes a requirement for action. Protecting \r\nhuman rights and human dignity is an obligation that \r\neach State owes its citizens. It is a mutual obligation \r\nthat all members of the international community must \r\nshare. History teaches us that an open society that is \r\ntolerant, pluralistic and free is the best guarantor of \r\nhuman rights and dignity.\r\nA threat to the security of humankind is often \r\ncoupled with the crushing of human rights. Yet human \r\nrights abuses that do not threaten security still concern \r\nus. The enslavement of others is a vicious human rights \r\nabuse. It takes many forms, such as the notorious \r\npolitical prisoner camps of North Korea, the forcible \r\nrecruitment by the Mouvement du 23 mars group \r\nin the Democratic Republic of Congo, and the early \r\nand forced marriage of young girls, which is a truly \r\nbarbaric form of slavery. Another despicable type of \r\nenslavement is the criminalization of sexuality: jailing, \r\ntorturing and killing people for who they are and whom \r\nthey love. Other abuses enslave the soul by suppressing, \r\nsometimes with brutal force, the right to worship \r\nfreely, to practise a faith and to hold religious beliefs. \r\nAssaults on human dignity, wherever they occur, are \r\nunacceptable. \r\nAt the start of my address, I observed that results \r\nmatter. This Organization was created to achieve \r\ncertain goals, and it will be measured by its success \r\nin doing so. No one ever said that it would be easy to \r\nmake real progress in advancing the prosperity, well-\r\nbeing, security and dignity of humankind. It is not easy \r\nbut it is essential. Despite the challenges, the frequent \r\nsetbacks and the cost, which is often heavy, we know \r\nthat the nations and peoples of the world are up to the \r\nchallenge. As we celebrate Mohandas Gandhi’s birthday \r\ntomorrow, let us be inspired by his words: “You must \r\nnot lose faith in humanity. Humanity is an ocean; if a \r\nfew drops of the ocean are dirty, the ocean does not \r\nbecome dirty.”\r\nEmboldened and bolstered by our faith in humanity, \r\nlet us move forward together to secure the results that \r\nthis Organization was established to achieve.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Edward Nalbandyan, Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof the Republic of Armenia.\r\nMr. Nalbandyan (Armenia) (spoke in French): I \r\nwould like to join previous speakers in congratulating \r\nMr. Vuk Jeremić on his election as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. I would \r\nalso like to extend our thanks to the outgoing President, \r\nMr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser.\r\n12-52557 5\r\nA/67/PV.19\r\nThis session of the General Assembly is an \r\ninvaluable opportunity to bring together Member States \r\nin order to examine the challenges facing humanity and \r\nto join efforts in effectively addressing those challenges \r\nand in achieving internationally agreed goals. We \r\nall know that when decisions are based on common \r\nunderstanding and agreement, their implementation \r\nand success are more likely.\r\nArmenia continues to be committed to strengthening \r\nthe institutional capacities of the Organization. We \r\nsupport the United Nations reform processes and are \r\nready to contribute to them. We believe that the reforms \r\nare an opportunity to strengthen the role of the United \r\nNations in solving the major issues facing our world \r\nand to achieve both the Millennium Development Goals \r\nand the sustainable development goals.\r\nWe welcome the fact that the agenda of the sixty-\r\nseventh session, which encompasses the most pressing \r\nissues of our joint responsibility for the maintenance \r\nof international peace and security, proposes that \r\nthe session focus on the settlement of disputes by \r\npeaceful means. In that context, we view the goals of \r\ndisarmament and arms control as major elements of \r\nglobal and regional security systems. We must also \r\nshoulder the responsibility to work together to counter \r\nmilitaristic threats.\r\nA few days ago, on 14 September, within the \r\nframework of the United Nations, the first ever High-\r\nLevel Forum on the Culture of Peace took place, calling \r\nfor tolerance and seeking to build mutual understanding \r\nand respect. Unfortunately, today, hate and intolerance \r\ncontinue to spread in some parts of the world, and we \r\nhave yet to dig into the root causes of such situations, \r\nto have the courage to openly ask difficult questions as \r\nto the reasons for them, and to face sometimes painful \r\nresponses.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nRegrettably, we have witnessed intolerance and \r\nhatred in our part of the world, too. Year after year, \r\nArmenia has, from this rostrum, raised concerns \r\nabout the militaristic rhetoric, blatant violation of \r\ninternational commitments and anti-Armenian hysteria \r\nbeing instilled into Azerbaijani society from the \r\nhighest levels of its leadership. Many international \r\norganizations on human rights have been alerted to \r\nf lagrant cases of xenophobia, racism, intolerance and \r\nviolations of human rights in Azerbaijan, as well as \r\nabout the policy of hatred against Armenians.\r\nWhat has been the Azerbaijani response? It not \r\nonly ignores the expectations of the international \r\ncommunity, but it constantly takes new steps that go \r\nagainst the values of the civilized world. The latest \r\nsuch case is the Azeri Government’s release and \r\nglorification of the murderer Mr. Ramil Safarov, who \r\nhad slaughtered an Armenian officer in his sleep with \r\nan axe, during a NATO programme in Budapest, simply \r\nbecause he was Armenian. The Azerbaijani leadership \r\nmade him a symbol of national pride and an example \r\nfor young people to follow.\r\nThe world’s reaction was unanimous and very \r\nclear in condemning what was done by Baku, the \r\ncapital of Azerbaijan, in granting him clemency. \r\nAzerbaijan continues to express bewilderment at the \r\nstance of the international community. What did they \r\nexpect — that the international community would \r\napplaud the glorification of a heinous murderer? The \r\nAzerbaijani leadership continues to pretend that the \r\nact was in accordance not only with the Azerbaijani \r\nConstitution and legislation, but also with the norms \r\nand principles of international law and the relevant \r\nEuropean conventions. The leadership of the country \r\nclaims that what was done was very good. It is very sad \r\nindeed that the constitution and legislation of a country \r\nwould permit making a hero of a murderer and paying \r\nsuch a brutal criminal a salary for the years he spent in \r\nprison.\r\nThe Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council \r\nof Europe warned that “to glorify and reward such a \r\nperson f lies in the face of all accepted standards for \r\nhuman rights protection and rule of law”. The President \r\nof the European Parliament and the President of the \r\nParliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe \r\nexpressed concern about the abuse of the European \r\nlegal instrument in question. The United Nations High \r\nCommissioner for Human Rights said on 7 September: \r\n“ethnically motivated hate crimes of this gravity should \r\nbe deplored and properly punished — not publicly \r\nglorified by leaders and politicians”.\r\nIt is very clear that there are different perceptions \r\nabout international legal principles and laws, different \r\nperceptions in Azerbaijan and the rest of the world \r\nabout what is good and what is bad. That is deeply \r\nirresponsible and shameful behaviour, not only for a \r\nnon-permanent member of the Security Council, but \r\nalso a Member State of the United Nations.\r\nIt is clear that the international community cannot \r\ntolerate the attempts of the Azerbaijani leadership to \r\n6 12-52557\r\nA/67/PV.19\r\nadjust international law to their own racist ideology. \r\nWith a rich domestic experience in corruption, Baku is \r\nattempting to transfer that vice to inter-State relations, \r\nexploiting it as a tool in order to impose its own false \r\nperceptions on others. The international community \r\ncannot tolerate the attempts of Azerbaijan to replace \r\nthe rule of law with the rule of oil.\r\nThe scandalous situation regarding Safarov \r\nhas seriously undermined the Nagorno Karabakh \r\nnegotiation process and endangered the already fragile \r\nregional security and stability. Azerbaijan poses a threat \r\nto the security and stability in the region by constantly \r\nthreatening to use force against Nagorno Karabakh \r\nand Armenia, along with the daily unprovoked \r\nwarmongering by its leadership. It has not only \r\nrejected the proposals of the three co-Chair countries \r\nof the Organization for Security and Cooperation \r\nin Europe (OSCE) group on the consolidation of the \r\nceasefire agreement and on the creation of a mechanism \r\nof investigation of incidents along the line of contact \r\nbut also systematically commits ceasefire violations, \r\nnot only on the contact line between Nagorno Karabakh \r\nand Azerbaijan but also through provocations along the \r\nborder with Armenia and ceaseless acts of vandalism \r\nagainst the Armenian historical and cultural heritage.\r\nWhile Armenia and the international mediators \r\nhave been working hard around the negotiation table, \r\nAzerbaijan has increased its military budget more than \r\ntwenty-fold during the past few years, and boasts about \r\nit. While Armenia and the international community \r\nhave been calling for the withdrawal of snipers from the \r\nline of contact, Azerbaijani leaders have been rejecting \r\nthose calls and have opened sniper schools for young \r\npeople. While Armenia has been calling for regional \r\neconomic cooperation, which could become a tool for \r\nincreasing confidence between the parties, Azerbaijani \r\nauthorities have declared that, together with Turkey, \r\nthey will continue the blockade until there are no more \r\nArmenians in Armenia.\r\nArmenia and the international community are \r\nspeaking in one language regarding the Nagorno \r\nKarabakh issue. The documents on the settlement of \r\nthe Nagorno Karabakh conflict adopted within the \r\nframework of the OSCE Astana Summit in 2010; the \r\nOSCE Ministerial Conferences of Helsinki in 2008, \r\nAthens in 2009, Ahnaty in 2010 and Vilnius in 2011; \r\nthe statements of Presidents of the Co-Chair countries \r\nwithin the framework of the Group of Eight Summits in \r\nl’Aquila in 2009, in Muskoka in 2010, and in Deauville \r\nin 2011; and during the Group of 20 Summit in 2012 \r\nin Los Cabos serve as proof of that. The position of \r\nArmenia is in line with those documents, and it is in \r\nline with the position of the international community, \r\nnamely, to accept the settlement on that basis.\r\nDespite the intensive efforts of the three Co-Chair \r\ncountries of the OSCE, it has been impossible to reach a \r\nbreakthrough, because the Azerbaijani side has rejected, \r\none after another, all of the proposals presented by the \r\nmediators. Despite Azerbaijan’s destructive stance, \r\nArmenia will continue to work towards the settlement \r\nof the Karabakh issue exclusively through peaceful \r\nmeans and on the basis of the purposes, principles and \r\nnorms reflected in the Charter and international law.\r\nLike many other speakers, I wish to express our \r\nconcerns about the developments and worsening of the \r\nhumanitarian situation in Syria, which also directly \r\naffects the large Armenian community in that country. \r\nThat community was formed mainly by the survivors \r\nof the Armenian genocide in the Ottoman Empire at \r\nthe beginning of the twentieth century. Today, they \r\nare struggling for life, as are many Syrian citizens. \r\nArmenia continues to receive refugees from Syria; \r\nthose refugees are full of worries about the escalation \r\nof violence in that country. It is impossible to reach a \r\ndurable settlement without the cessation of hostilities \r\nby all parties and without an inclusive political dialogue \r\nthat takes into account the interests of all Syrians.\r\nNext year, the United Nations will mark the sixty-\r\nfifth anniversary of the Convention on the Prevention \r\nand Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. That \r\nanniversary will become an important landmark \r\nand occasion on which to create a more effective \r\ninstrument for combatting the crimes of genocide. \r\nThe denial of genocide and impunity pave the way \r\nfor the repetition of new crimes against humanity. As \r\ndescendants of the nation that survived the horrors \r\nof the first genocide of the twentieth century, we \r\nare convinced that the international community \r\nmust stand together — independent of any kind \r\nof considerations — in the recognition and strong \r\ncondemnation of genocide, so as to be able to prevent \r\nit from occurring. In the absence of such unanimity, \r\nhumankind will witness new attempts at crimes against \r\nhumanity. Our strong conviction is that we should \r\nkeep the issue high on our common agenda. We should \r\nrecommit to a world where the crime of genocide can \r\nnever occur again.\r\n12-52557 7\r\nA/67/PV.19\r\nArmenia gladly assumes its share of our common \r\nresponsibility to support the United Nations as a \r\nplatform for dialogue, multilateralism and collective \r\naction in addressing the multiple challenges of today’s \r\nworld.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Yousef Bin Al-Alawi Bin Abdulla, Minister of \r\nState for Foreign Affairs of Oman.\r\nMr. Abdulla (Oman) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I would like to offer the President and his \r\nfriendly country, the Republic of Serbia, my warmest \r\ncongratulations on his election to the presidency of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. I would \r\nalso like to express my appreciation to his predecessor, \r\nMr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, from the brotherly \r\nState of Qatar, for the exemplary way in which he \r\nconducted the work of the previous session.\r\nI would also like to take this opportunity to convey \r\nmy appreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \r\nfor his role and efforts in improving the Organization’s \r\nworking mechanisms, and to wish him every success \r\nin his endeavours. The record of the United Nations \r\nincludes numerous positive and tangible achievements \r\nthat have helped to promote international peace and \r\nsecurity and reach a political consensus on many \r\nregional and international issues.\r\nIn our Middle East region, the Syrian crisis \r\ncontinues to be of great concern, owing to the great loss \r\nof life and property that it has caused and the instability \r\nthat it has produced in the region and the world as a \r\nwhole. Despite the efforts of the United Nations and \r\nthe League of Arab States, the parties involved in the \r\nSyrian crisis have failed to reach a peaceful solution \r\nthat could spare the lives of the Syrian people.\r\nWe call on our brothers in Syria to renounce \r\nviolence, end hostilities and launch a political process \r\nthat will fulfil the aspirations and hopes of the \r\nSyrian people and preserve Syria’s security, stability \r\nand unity. At the same time, we call on the Security \r\nCouncil, the international body primarily responsible \r\nfor the maintenance of international peace and security, \r\nto reach consensus on a unified position on the Syrian \r\ncrisis, without political disagreements and without bias \r\ntowards any side, by way of starting a serious national \r\ndialogue between all political forces in Syria, with no \r\nexceptions. We believe that the principles and guidelines \r\nfor a Syrian-led process of transition, as contained in \r\nthe final communiqué of the Action Group for Syria \r\n(S/2012/523, annex), issued at its meeting in Geneva in \r\nmid-2012, could form the basis for a solution, if agreed \r\non and accepted by all Syrian and international parties.\r\nThe conflicting interests among some countries \r\nand their disagreements on how to address the Syrian \r\nconflict no longer serve any purpose, because the time \r\nhas come to take collective action that can preserve \r\nsecurity, stability and development for every country \r\nin the Middle East, especially since the alternative \r\nwould be the spread of violence, killing, destruction \r\nand chaos. We believe that it is not in the world’s best \r\ninterests to allow the Middle East to become another \r\nglobal f lashpoint.\r\nI would also like to take this opportunity to say that \r\nmy country welcomes the appointment of Mr. Lakhdar \r\nBrahimi as the Joint Special Representative of the \r\nUnited Nations and the League of Arab States for Syria. \r\nWe hope that he can provide practical and concrete \r\nproposals to pull Syria out of the current cycle of \r\nviolence and killing.\r\nWe are aware of the complexities that arise in any \r\ndiscussion of the question of Palestine at sessions of the \r\nAssembly. We all know, however, that while the United \r\nNations has explored every avenue and adopted many \r\nresolutions and policies on the Palestinian question, that \r\nissue continues to be a cause for concern and a source \r\nof unending threats and conflicts in the Middle East \r\nand beyond. We believe, therefore, that the role of the \r\nUnited Nations with regard to the question of Palestine \r\nshould change from one of managing the crisis to one \r\nof seriously seeking a just, lasting and comprehensive \r\npolitical solution that would take into account the \r\ninterests of both Palestinians and Israelis and lead to \r\nthe establishment of a State of Palestine, living side by \r\nside with the State of Israel. In that context, my country \r\nsupports Palestine’s application for non-member \r\nState observer status at the United Nations, hoping \r\nthat that will usher a new phase in the Palestinian-\r\nIsraeli negotiations and one that could make a positive \r\ncontribution to settling the issue.\r\nThe Somali people have long suffered from an \r\nabsence of security, stability and State institutions \r\nand bodies; we therefore welcome the formation of the \r\nnew Somali Parliament and the election of Mr. Hassan \r\nSheikh Mohamud as President of Somalia. We hope \r\nthat his Government will be able to achieve national \r\nreconciliation and establish security and stability \r\nthroughout Somalia.\r\n8 12-52557\r\nA/67/PV.19\r\ndeliberate abuse of and slander against the sanctity of \r\npeople’s beliefs, with a view to deterring others who \r\nmay attempt to spread hatred among people.\r\nThe world today is facing a genuine threat of food \r\nshortages, owing to the steady increase in the world’s \r\npopulation and the problems facing the global economy, \r\nwhich have resulted in the famines currently plaguing \r\nmany parts of Africa, Asia and Latin America. There \r\nis no doubt that addressing that problem will require \r\nus to undertake a practical study of alternatives that \r\ncould alleviate the negative impacts of food shortages. \r\nAmong the ideas we deem worthy of exploring is \r\nthe establishment of a global food reserve system to \r\ndeal with food shortages, with food reserve centres \r\nlocated in various continents of the world and managed \r\nthrough an international fund specifically established \r\nto support the system. States, international institutions \r\nand sovereign funds that have the capacity to contribute \r\nto the fund would also be allowed to do so. We are of \r\nthe view that the Food and Agriculture Organization \r\nof the United Nations, in the light of its expertise in \r\nthat field, could be the appropriate body to oversee the \r\npreparation and implementation of such a study.\r\nWe would like to take this opportunity to encourage \r\nindustrialized countries to increase their investment \r\nin agricultural research and to utilize science and \r\ntechnology in their search for innovative solutions \r\naimed at increasing food production so as to keep pace \r\nwith the steady increase in the global demand for food.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate my \r\ncountry’s support for all international efforts to achieve \r\nthe aspirations of peoples to a safer, more stable and \r\nprosperous world.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Cuba.\r\nMr. Rodríguez Parrilla (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nNever before have Latin America and the Caribbean \r\nexpressed themselves with such strength and unity as \r\nthey did at the Summit of the Americas, held last April \r\nin Cartagena de Indias, Colombia. Once again, Cuba \r\nwas excluded at the insistence of the United States. \r\nArgentine sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands, which \r\nour country fervently supports, and the lifting of the \r\nblockade against Cuba were the focus of a declaration \r\nthat demonstrated that the American homeland \r\nenvisaged by Bolivar — our America as envisaged \r\nAs we call on the international community to \r\nprovide support and assistance, whether political, \r\neconomic or humanitarian, to the Somali people, we \r\nurge the Somali factions and parties from various \r\npolitical and tribal affiliations and organizations to \r\nreject violence, cease hostilities and place the higher \r\ninterest of the nation above all others. We believe that \r\na national dialogue, involving all parties in the Somali \r\nconflict, regardless of their ideological and political \r\ndifferences and inclinations, is essential and will \r\nhelp restore security, stability and nation-building in \r\nSomalia.\r\nWe would like to commend the international efforts \r\nto combat piracy and the armed robbery of merchant \r\nvessels in the Indian Ocean, particularly in the Arabian \r\nSea. The Sultanate of Oman, which is located on the \r\nArabian Sea, reaffirms its continuing support for \r\ninternational efforts to eradicate the problem, and will \r\ncooperate with countries that have a naval presence \r\nin the area in order to protect international trade and \r\nnavigation.\r\nFrom the outset, the Sultanate of Oman has \r\nsupported the proposal to establish a zone free of nuclear \r\nweapons and all other weapons of mass destruction \r\nin the Middle East. In that regard, we welcome the \r\nReview Conference of Parties to the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, scheduled to be \r\nheld in Finland at the end of this year. We hope it will \r\nbe able to officially declare the Middle East a zone free \r\nfrom nuclear and all other weapons of mass destruction, \r\nsimilar to other such zones that have been established \r\nelsewhere in the world.\r\nAt a time when Muslims are trying to promote a \r\nculture of tolerance and coexistence, we note that there \r\nare those who abuse their right to express themselves \r\nby deliberately slandering monotheistic religions and \r\nprophets and messengers of God. My country condemns \r\nthe video slandering the Prophet Muhammad — peace \r\nbe upon him — which clearly and deliberately sought to \r\nspread a culture of hatred against Muslims. Despite the \r\ngravity of the offence, we reject escalating the reaction \r\nto a level resulting in attacks against diplomatic \r\nmissions and representatives, such as those against \r\nUnited States and other Western diplomatic missions.\r\nAgainst the backdrop of those events and similar \r\nincidents earlier, we believe that it is incumbent on \r\nthe United Nations to adopt international legislation \r\nthat would hold accountable those responsible for any \r\n12-52557 9\r\nA/67/PV.19\r\nof dialogue between the Colombian Government and \r\nthe Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia.\r\nOur America will remain mutilated as long as \r\nPuerto Rico, a Latin American and Caribbean nation, \r\nlacks its independence — a cause that we fully support.\r\nToday’s world is in no way similar to the one \r\nthat was envisioned by those who drafted the United \r\nNations Charter, over the ashes left by the Second \r\nWorld War, when they expressed their determination to \r\nsave our generations from the scourge of war; protect \r\nthe fundamental rights of human beings and equality \r\namong all nations, large and small; and promote justice, \r\ndignity and social progress. Today, the overthrow of \r\nGovernments through the use of force and violence is \r\nbeing blatantly encouraged. Regime change is being \r\nimposed from Washington and other NATO capitals, \r\nand wars of conquest are being waged for the control \r\nof natural resources and areas of strategic importance.\r\nThe Governments of the United States and some \r\nEuropean countries have decided to overthrow the \r\nSyrian Government. To that end, they have armed, \r\nfinanced and trained opposition groups, and turned to \r\nthe use of mercenaries.\r\nOwing mainly to the firm opposition of Russia \r\nand China, it has not been possible to manipulate the \r\nSecurity Council into imposing the interventionist \r\nformula that has been applied in the context of recent \r\nbellicose ventures.\r\nCuba reaffirms the right of the Syrian people to \r\nthe full exercise of its right to self-determination and \r\nsovereignty without interference or foreign intervention \r\nof any sort. The violence, massacres and terrorist acts, \r\nwhich have taken a high toll in innocent lives, must \r\ncease. The trafficking in arms and money f lows that \r\nhelps fund insurgent groups, as well as the shameful \r\nmanipulation of reality by the media, must also come \r\nto an end.\r\nIt is the duty of the General Assembly to make use of \r\nthe means at its disposal to promote a peaceful solution \r\nto the current situation, which is destroying that Arab \r\ncountry, and prevent foreign military aggression, which \r\nwould have serious consequences for the entire Middle \r\nEast region.\r\nThe General Assembly should act with resolve and \r\nrecognize the Palestinian State as a full Member of the \r\nUnited Nations, within the borders established prior \r\nto 1967 and with East Jerusalem as its capital; and it \r\nby Marti — has entered a new era: the century of its \r\nultimate independence.\r\nSome months prior, the Community of Latin \r\nAmerican and Caribbean States (CELAC) held its \r\ninaugural summit meeting in Caracas. No other \r\ninstitutional entity in our hemisphere in the course of \r\nthe last century is of such major importance, wrote \r\nthe leader of the Cuban Revolution, Fidel Castro Ruz, \r\nabout CELAC. We know that CELAC still has not yet \r\nreached its full development, so that our peoples can \r\ngo forward in ranks as compact as the veins of silver \r\nin the roots of the Andes. But Latin America and the \r\nCaribbean have definitively changed, and they are \r\nprepared to make a greater contribution to the world \r\norder. However, the threats, dangers and obstacles \r\nshould not be underestimated.\r\nThe policy of the United States with regard to \r\nour region, under both Democratic and Republican \r\nAdministrations, has been essentially the same. The \r\npromises made by the current President in 2009 have \r\ngone unfulfilled. Tireless efforts have been made to \r\ncontrol our wealth, to impose their models, culture and \r\nideas, and to interfere in our internal affairs. Despite \r\ntalk of “intelligent power” and the use of fabulous new \r\ntechnology, the focus remains on security and military \r\ndeployment, rather than on democratic and mutually \r\nbeneficial relations between equal, sovereign States.\r\nIn the circumstances of a global economic crisis, \r\nthe depletion of resources and the shifting balances in \r\nthe world, NATO continues to perceive our region as \r\na mere periphery of the Euro-Atlantic area, in which \r\nit might intervene to protect its interests, however \r\nillegitimate.\r\nThe upcoming elections in the sister nation of the \r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela will be decisive \r\nfor the shared destiny of our region. We would like \r\nto express to the Venezuelan people and their leader, \r\nPresident Chávez Frías, our full solidarity in the face of \r\nthe looming attempts at destabilization. The governing \r\npowers in the United States would be making a very \r\nserious mistake of untold consequences if they were \r\nto attempt to reverse by force the social achievements \r\nattained by our peoples.\r\nCuba has continuously contributed to peace in \r\nColombia, with discretion and modesty. We fully \r\nsupported the confidential exploratory talks held \r\nthroughout this year in Havana, and we will continue to \r\ndo so as a guarantor and host of the upcoming process \r\n10 12-52557\r\nA/67/PV.19\r\nshould do so now, with or without the consent of the \r\nSecurity Council; with or without a United States veto; \r\nand with or without new peace negotiations.\r\nThe global economic crisis, which is having a \r\nparticularly strong impact on Europe, reflects the \r\ninability of Governments and institutions to solve a \r\nproblem that requires a rethinking of the basic tenets of \r\nthe current system of international economic relations, \r\nwhich serves only to pillage underdeveloped countries.\r\nThe harsh consequences of the crisis in the \r\ndeveloped world and the failed policies adopted so far \r\nin an attempt to stop it continue to be borne by workers, \r\nthe increasing number of unemployed, immigrants and \r\nthe poor, whose protest movements are being brutally \r\nrepressed. The predicted increase in food prices as a \r\nresult of the drought that is affecting much of North \r\nAmerica threatens to exacerbate global food insecurity.\r\nEnvironmental destruction is also worsening. \r\nThe loss of biodiversity and of the natural balance \r\nof ecosystems is accelerating; and the growing \r\nirrationality of production and consumption patterns, \r\nthe marginalization of more than half of the world’s \r\npopulation and the lack of comprehensive measures to \r\nhalt climate change pose an ever-increasing risk to the \r\nphysical integrity of entire nations, particularly small \r\nisland States.\r\nIn the face of those colossal challenges, we wonder \r\nif anything could ever justify the fact that, 20 years \r\nafter the end of the so-called Cold War, military budgets \r\nhave almost doubled, reaching the astronomical figure \r\nof $1.74 trillion. As President Raúl Castro Ruz asked, \r\nagainst what enemies will those weapons be used? Will \r\nthey be used to eliminate the masses of poor people \r\nwho can no longer tolerate their poverty, or to halt the \r\nunstoppable migrations of survivors?\r\nUnder these circumstances, it is urgent to save the \r\nUnited Nations and subject it to deep-seated reform, so \r\nas to put it at the service of all, equally sovereign States \r\nand free it from the arbitrariness and double standards \r\nof a handful of industrialized and powerful countries.\r\nInternational law and the purposes and principles of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations should be resolutely \r\nenforced; the key role of the General Assembly should \r\nbe restored; and a democratic, transparent and truly \r\nrepresentative Security Council should be relaunched.\r\nThe Summit of Non-Aligned Countries was \r\nsuccessfully held in Tehran and reaffirmed the \r\nMovement’s positions in defence of peace, independence \r\nand the sovereign equality of States; justice; the right \r\nto development; sovereignty over natural resources; \r\ngeneral and complete disarmament, particularly \r\nnuclear disarmament; and the right to the peaceful use \r\nof nuclear energy. We have pledged our full support to \r\nthe chairmanship of the Movement.\r\nOn July 31, the State Department of the United \r\nStates included Cuba once again on its unilateral, \r\narbitrary list of States that sponsor international \r\nterrorism. The true motive behind the inclusion of Cuba \r\non that spurious list is to fabricate pretexts to increase \r\nthe persecution of Cuba with respect to its financial \r\ntransactions and justify the policy of blockade, which \r\nhas caused immense human and economic harm \r\ntotalling $1 trillion, based on the current value of gold.\r\nThe United States does not have the slightest moral \r\nor political authority to judge Cuba.It is well known \r\nthat the United States Government has resorted to State \r\nterrorism as a weapon in its policy against Cuba, which \r\nhas caused the deaths of 3,478 of our compatriots and \r\ninjured another 2,099. It is also harbouring dozens \r\nof terrorists, some of whom live in freedom in that \r\ncountry, and continues with the prolonged, inhumane \r\nimprisonment and cruel and arbitrary retention on its \r\nterritory of the five Cuban anti-terrorists.\r\nCuba strongly rejects the use of so sensitive an issue \r\nas terrorism to pursue political goals and calls for the \r\nUnited States Government to stop lying and put an end \r\nto this shameful exercise, which is an outrage against \r\nthe Cuban people, the North American victims and the \r\ninternational community and discredits the cause of the \r\nstruggle against terrorism.\r\nWe reiterate to the United States, on the eve of \r\nthe elections in that country, our irrevocable yearning \r\nfor peace and our interest in moving towards the \r\nnormalization of bilateral relations through dialogue, \r\non an equal footing and with absolute respect for our \r\nindependence.\r\nWith absolute certainty, our people, come what \r\nmay, with all and for the well-being of all, will continue \r\non the path they have already chosen until they have \r\nachieved full justice.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. S.M. Krishna, Minister for External \r\nAffairs of the Republic of India.\r\n12-52557 11\r\nA/67/PV.19\r\nNations. Priority must be given to the challenges of \r\npoverty, unemployment, food and energy, water, health, \r\nenvironmental sustainability, unsustainable lifestyles \r\nand, above all, economic growth.\r\nEnsuring gender equality and women’s \r\nempowerment is essential to the pursuit of building \r\ninclusive societies. It is also an imperative for building \r\nstrong and resilient economies. We are happy to support \r\nthe efforts of the United Nations. We also need to pay \r\nparticular attention to upgrading the skills of young \r\npeople and to ensuring employment opportunities for \r\nthem. Children and youth are our future. We need to \r\ninvest in them to reap the demographic dividend to \r\nsecure our future.\r\nIndia remains firmly committed to scaling up \r\nour development partnership with Africa, including \r\nthrough the framework of the India-Africa Forum \r\nSummit. Similarly, we will continue to build on our \r\ncommitments for enhanced cooperation with least \r\ndeveloped countries, landlocked developing countries \r\nand small island developing States within the framework \r\nof South-South cooperation.\r\nIndia is a multireligious, multi-ethnic and \r\nmultilingual society. Our civilizational ethos has been \r\nunderpinned by peaceful coexistence and tolerance, \r\nvalues that the founder of the nation, Mahatma Gandhi, \r\nplaced at the core of India’s national life. Those \r\nprinciples are enshrined in our Constitution, which \r\nprovides the foundation for our secular, democratic and \r\ninclusive society. \r\nMutual respect for deeply held religious sentiments \r\nis the bedrock of tolerance and coexistence. Unfortunate \r\nrecent events have highlighted the need for enhanced \r\ndialogue among faiths and civilizations. Violence \r\ncannot lead to greater understanding. It is necessary \r\nto uphold norms of peaceful international discourse. \r\nIn particular, the safety and security of diplomatic \r\npersonnel should be fully respected.\r\nTerrorism remains one of the most potent threats \r\nto international peace and security. The international \r\ncommunity must adopt a zero-tolerance approach to \r\nterrorism and must focus on efforts to dismantle the \r\ninfrastructure of terrorism, including its invidious \r\nnetwork of epicentres, training facilities and financing. \r\nIt is time we demonstrated the necessary political will to \r\nagree on a comprehensive convention on international \r\nterrorism so as to strengthen the normative framework \r\nMr. Krishna (India): It is indeed a great privilege \r\nfor me to be able to address the General Assembly. \r\nLet me begin by congratulating Mr. Vuk Jeremić on \r\nhis election to the office of President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-seventh session. I assure him of \r\nour constructive support in his work over the coming \r\nyear.\r\nWe are assembled in New York at a time when we \r\nface multiple global challenges that transcend national \r\nboundaries. Developing countries are still to recover \r\nfrom the downturn in the global economy. Their quest \r\nfor poverty eradication and sustainable development \r\nremains an uphill task. Food and energy security as well \r\nas health and education for their populations remain \r\ndaunting challenges. The West Asia-North Africa \r\nregion is seeing unprecedented sociopolitical upheaval. \r\nThe question of Palestine remains unresolved. Threats \r\nemanating from terrorism, maritime piracy, drug \r\ntrafficking and the proliferation of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction continue to multiply. Those challenges \r\ndemand that we work for solutions in a concerted and \r\ncoordinated manner. That is the only path to success.\r\nAt the United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (Rio+20), the international community \r\nrenewed its commitment to sustainable development \r\nand recognized poverty eradication as the greatest \r\nglobal challenge. To act on that, it unequivocally \r\nreaffirmed the sanctity of the Rio principles. India \r\nremains committed to addressing climate change \r\nthrough a comprehensive, equitable and balanced \r\noutcome based on the principles of equity and common \r\nbut differentiated responsibilities. In less than two \r\nweeks, in Hyderabad, we will host the eleventh meeting \r\nof the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on \r\nBiological Diversity. We seek the support of parties to \r\nfashion an outcome that harmonizes strong biodiversity \r\naction with our basic development objectives.\r\nThe process to develop a set of sustainable \r\ndevelopment goals has begun. The Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) must be integrated in the \r\nnew framework so that the unmet development priorities \r\ncontinue to be the main focus. In the interim, with still \r\nthree years to go to the MDG target date of 2015, it \r\nis imperative to ensure that all efforts to achieve the \r\nMDGs are made. In the global discourse on the post-\r\n2015 development agenda, the focus ought to be on the \r\nword “development”. It ought to be firmly entrenched \r\nin the understandings and principles of Rio+20 and be \r\nanchored in the intergovernmental process at the United \r\n12 12-52557\r\nA/67/PV.19\r\nof the crisis can have catastrophic consequences for \r\nthe region. We urge all parties to commit themselves \r\nto resolving the crisis without any further bloodshed \r\nthrough an inclusive, Syrian-led political process \r\nthat can meet the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian \r\npeople. We support the efforts of the United Nations \r\nand urge all sides to cooperate in good faith with the \r\nJoint Special Representative of the United Nations and \r\nthe League of Arab States, Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi. \r\nSupport for the Palestinian cause has been a \r\ncornerstone of India’s foreign policy. We were privileged \r\nto receive President Mahmoud Abbas in India earlier this \r\nmonth. We support Palestine’s aspirations for enhanced \r\nstatus at the United Nations. It is imperative that there be \r\nan early realization of a sovereign, independent, viable \r\nand united State of Palestine, with East Jerusalem as its \r\ncapital, living within secure and recognized borders, \r\nside by side and at peace with Israel, as endorsed in \r\nthe Arab Peace Initiative, the Quartet road map and the \r\nrelevant United Nations resolutions.\r\nIndia desires constructive and friendly relations \r\nwith all its neighbours. We have a vision of a peaceful, \r\nstable and prosperous region with enhanced cooperation \r\nand connectivity linking us with Central Asia, the \r\nGulf and South-East Asia. Within South Asia, we have \r\nsought to enhance bilateral relations individually with \r\neach of our neighbours and through the aegis of the \r\nSouth Asian Association for Regional Cooperation. \r\nWe have embarked on a resumed dialogue process \r\nwith Pakistan and advocate a step-by-step approach to \r\nnormalizing our bilateral relations. \r\nAn unwarranted reference has been made from \r\nthis rostrum to Jammu and Kashmir. Our principled \r\nposition on the issue has been consistent and is well \r\nknown. The people of Jammu and Kashmir have chosen \r\ntheir destiny and reaffirmed it repeatedly through \r\nIndia’s well-established democratic processes. We wish \r\nto make it abundantly clear that Jammu and Kashmir is \r\nan integral part of India.\r\nIndia supports the Government and people of \r\nAfghanistan in their endeavour to build a peaceful, \r\nstable, democratic and prosperous country. We are \r\nready to partner with the Afghan people as they rebuild \r\ntheir country in accordance with their own priorities \r\nand national circumstances. The continuing existence \r\nbeyond Afghanistan’s borders of safe havens and \r\nsanctuaries for terrorists is the major impediment to the \r\nrestoration of peace and security in Afghanistan. India \r\nagainst the increasingly sophisticated and globalized \r\nterrorist challenge.\r\nIndia continues to be gravely concerned by the \r\nmenace of piracy and armed robbery at sea. Apart from \r\nthe major economic and commercial consequences of \r\nthat scourge, it has serious humanitarian implications \r\nfor the large number of seafarers held hostage by \r\npirates. The need of the hour is once again concerted \r\ninternational action under United Nations auspices, \r\nwith special attention to addressing the welfare of \r\nseafarers and their families.\r\nPeacekeeping and disarmament are among the \r\nunique pursuits of the United Nations, because \r\nthey embody the promise and innate potential of the \r\nOrganization to make the world a better place. India \r\nhas a proud history of participation in United Nations \r\npeacekeeping operations dating back to the 1950s, \r\nhaving taken part in as many as 43 peacekeeping \r\noperations. The challenge before the international \r\ncommunity today is to ensure that United Nations \r\npeacekeeping is adequately resourced and enabled to \r\nmeet the realities of today, including in post-conflict \r\nand peacebuilding contexts. In that regard, we are \r\nhopeful that progress will be made on all outstanding \r\nissues between the Sudan and South Sudan.\r\nIndia is committed to achieving a nuclear-\r\nweapon-free world. The principles of the Rajiv Gandhi \r\naction plan of 1988 for achieving nuclear disarmament \r\nin a time-bound, universal, non-discriminatory, \r\nphased and verifiable manner remain relevant, even \r\nafter more than two decades. A renewed consensus \r\non non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament must \r\nbe forged. Meaningful dialogue among all States \r\npossessing nuclear weapons is needed in order to build \r\ntrust and confidence and to reduce the salience of \r\nnuclear weapons in international affairs and security \r\ndoctrines.\r\nMeasures must be taken to reduce nuclear \r\nrisks, including the grave risk of terrorists gaining \r\naccess to weapons of mass destruction, and thus \r\nto strengthen nuclear security. The Conference on \r\nDisarmament — the international community’s sole \r\nmultilateral disarmament negotiating forum — deserves \r\nour support in discharging its mandate of negotiating \r\ntreaties on issues on the international disarmament \r\nagenda. \r\nThe crisis in Syria continues unabated and is a matter \r\nof serious concern for us.

I wish him every success in his new \r\nresponsibilities.\r\nThe global economic and financial context remains \r\nmore troubling than ever. The successive and increasing \r\neconomic and financial crises that began in 2008 affect \r\nus all. Both developed and developing countries face \r\nan uncertain environment, with economies slowed if \r\nnot in recession, sluggish growth, crushing debts and \r\ndeficits that threaten certain States with bankruptcy, as \r\nwell as growing unemployment rates. In such a context, \r\ndeveloping nations, in particular the least advanced, are \r\nseverely impacted economically as well as socially. The \r\nnegative consequences for achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) have been enormous. In \r\nmany African countries, reaching those Goals by 2015 \r\nis jeopardized despite the fact that they have spared no \r\neffort to step up implementation before the deadline. \r\nIt is in times of difficulty that we must show \r\nresponsibility and solidarity by honouring our respective \r\ncommitments. It is therefore important that the fate of \r\nthe least advanced African countries be examined with \r\nparticular attention with a view to helping them lighten \r\ntheir burden, improve their productive capabilities and \r\nfacilitate access for their products to world markets \r\nunder more favourable conditions. My Government calls \r\nfor the comprehensive implementation of the Istanbul \r\nProgramme of Action for the Least Developed Countries \r\nfor the Decade 2011-2020 (A/CONF.219/3/Rev.1). \r\nThe current financial and economic crises have \r\nmultidimensional consequences in Africa; any effort \r\nto resolve them must take into account Africa’s \r\nspecific needs and must ensure that commitments \r\nmade at international meetings are implemented. I \r\ntake this opportunity to welcome the establishment of \r\nis committed to creating an enabling environment in \r\nwhich the Afghan people can live in peace and security \r\nand decide their future for themselves, without outside \r\ninterference, coercion or intimidation.\r\nThe United Nations and the norms of international \r\nrelations that it has fostered remain the most \r\nefficacious means for converting today’s challenges \r\ninto opportunities. However, we need to ensure that the \r\narchitecture of global governance reflects contemporary \r\nrealities. Sticking to structures designed at the end of \r\nthe Second World War only constrains multilateralism \r\nfrom delivering on its promises.\r\nThe most important and decisive step towards \r\nremedying that situation pertains to the Security \r\nCouncil, which must be expanded in both the permanent \r\nand non-permanent categories. A reformed Council \r\nmust include countries that are capable of bearing, and \r\nwilling to bear, the additional burdens relating to the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, as well \r\nas willilng to sustain global campaigns against new and \r\nemerging global threats. Let me also stress that we must \r\naddress, sooner rather than later, the incongruity of the \r\nlack of permanent membership for Africa. \r\nEqually, India will promote and lend its weight to \r\nenhancing the voice and participation of developing \r\ncountries in decision-making in global economic and \r\nfinancial institutions. The quota reform process of the \r\nInternational Monetary Fund must be accelerated with \r\naltered quotas that reflect contemporary economic \r\nweight.\r\nSpeaking in the Assembly on 14 October 1968, \r\nPrime Minister Indira Gandhi said, \r\n“The United Nations is the trustee of the \r\nworld’s peace and represents the hopes of mankind. \r\nIts very existence gives a feeling of assurance that \r\nthe justice of true causes can be brought fearlessly \r\nbefore the world. This Assembly and the agencies \r\nof the United Nations should, in all that they do, \r\nsustain those hopes and promote the causes of \r\npeace”. \r\nThose words remain true to this day.\r\nLet me conclude by assuring the President and the \r\nmembers of the Assembly that India will continue to \r\nabide by the purposes and principles of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations and will strive to strengthen the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\n14 12-52557\r\nA/67/PV.19\r\nunfortunately on the list of those deficient in potable \r\nwater and which is considered a country at risk of water \r\nshortages in the next 25 years. For most countries in \r\nour situation, the effects of climate change accentuate \r\nexisting disparities. \r\nSustainable development must take an approach \r\nfocused on meeting the needs of populations. Women, \r\nchildren and young people should be the target of \r\nany implementation policy derived from the Rio+20 \r\noutcome document (resolution 66/288, annex) and of \r\nall discussions geared to formulating the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda. Human capital is my country’s \r\nmain asset, and that is why my Government devotes \r\nparticular attention to its development. Social policies \r\nare being developed around the goal of promoting and \r\nenhancing the rights and well-being of young people \r\nand women. It is a national priority to guarantee \r\ngender equality and to empower women through access \r\nto health care and protect them from all forms of \r\ndiscrimination and violence. My Government therefore \r\nwelcomes the African Union initiative recommending \r\nthat at its sixty-seventh session the Assembly adopt \r\na draft resolution aimed at intensifying efforts to \r\neliminate female genital mutilation from the world. \r\nWe welcome the measures undertaken by the African \r\nGroup in New York to that effect. \r\nYouth, which is our future, constitutes a sure asset \r\nfor the African continent. Indeed, almost 65 per cent \r\nof the African population is under the age of 35. It \r\ngoes without saying that addressing their present and \r\nensuring their social well-being is the way to success \r\nfor our country. The challenges are enormous given \r\nthe global economic stagnation. My Government has \r\ntherefore set up social policies and programmes in \r\norder to respond to the specific needs of young people \r\nin the areas of education, health care and employment.\r\nOn behalf of the Republic of Djibouti, I would like \r\nto reiterate my warmest congratulations to the new \r\nPresident of the Somali Republic, Mr. Hassan Sheikh \r\nMohamud, and to his people on having taken the first \r\nstep towards the reconciliation and stabilization of \r\nSomalia and on having found the necessary resources \r\nto overcome all obstacles on the way. The civil and \r\npeaceful climate among the candidates at the time of the \r\nelection and the maturity that they showed throughout \r\nan historic and inclusive electoral process must be \r\ncommended. Those realities are the best guarantee of \r\nsuccess for the future. The hope of seeing a reconciled \r\nand peaceful Somalia is in sight.\r\na United Nations monitoring mechanism to review the \r\ncommitments made related to Africa’s development.\r\nThe United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (Rio+20) in June was an opportunity \r\nfor all Governments to renew their commitment to a \r\nsustainable development that embraces the economic, \r\nsocial and environmental spheres. It is important that our \r\nshared political will be swiftly transformed into action \r\nand that the work we put into the Rio commitments for \r\n“The future we want” becomes a reality.\r\nThe elimination of poverty remains an absolute \r\npriority on the path to sustainable development. It is \r\na major challenge for many countries of the world, \r\nincluding those of the Horn of Africa. Our region is \r\nsuffering enormously from the adverse effects of climate \r\nchange, and has been for a number of years. Trapped \r\nin the cycle of chronic droughts and f loods, our most \r\nvulnerable people are seeing their means of subsistence \r\ndestroyed and their productive capacity and access to \r\nsufficient, nutritious food hampered. Our Government \r\nhas implemented social policies designed to relieve the \r\nburden of extreme poverty and its corollary, hunger, and \r\nhopes its partners will continue their support by acting \r\nin accord with the national priorities, within a long-term \r\napproach that will enable us to move from emergency \r\noperations geared to the relief of affected populations \r\nto a perspective of sustainable development.\r\nThat means, from the emergency stage onward, a \r\ncomprehensive global approach accompanied by efforts \r\nto guarantee women, children and men the right to \r\nfood. Guaranteeing food security to our fellow citizens \r\nremains our priority. I am convinced that the goals \r\nof the Secretary-General’s Zero Hunger initiative are \r\nachievable, because they have been developed within \r\nthe perspective of an integrated, effective strategy to \r\neliminate hunger that involves all actors. \r\nI wish to acknowledge the support of our partners, \r\nwho have spared no effort to help us reach that goal, \r\nespecially in the efforts to reduce the disparities \r\nbetween rural and urban populations and to develop our \r\nagricultural production. In that regard, my country has \r\nimplemented a number of agricultural infrastructure \r\nprojects, including the development of arable land in \r\nneighbouring countries such as Ethiopia and the Sudan \r\nand a project to capture the water of the Awash River on \r\nthe Ethiopian border when it f loods.\r\nAccess to potable water and water purification \r\ncontinue to be a critical goal for my country, which is \r\n12-52557 15\r\nA/67/PV.19\r\nreliable financing of the AMISOM troops so that the \r\nreconciliation, stabilization and peacebuilding strategy \r\ncontinues and reaches all Somalia.\r\nIn that regard, strengthening the security gains \r\nis crucial. The countries in the region — Uganda, \r\nBurundi, Ethiopia, Kenya and Djibouti — have done \r\nuseful work and continue to serve the noble cause of \r\npeace. However, the transformation of the AMISOM \r\nforces into a United Nations peacekeeping force now \r\nseems inevitable. We can no longer avoid that issue. It is \r\nup to the Security Council to take that timely decision.\r\nI would also like to launch an appeal for the \r\nconvening of a donor conference in order to mobilize \r\nresources for the reconstruction of the Somali economy. \r\nI am convinced that we are all aware of the necessity \r\nof meeting the individual recovery, reintegration and \r\nreconstruction needs of countries emerging from \r\nconflict. Somalia is no exception. Here at the United \r\nNations, we must consider the steps to be taken, in \r\nparticular by the Peacebuilding Commission.\r\nThe theme of the General Assembly this \r\nyear — “Bringing about adjustment or settlement \r\nof international disputes or situations by peaceful \r\nmeans” — is relevant given the many conflicts in the \r\nworld that threaten international peace and security. \r\nOur region, the Horn of Africa, has unfortunately not \r\nbeen spared. As members know, my country, which \r\nhad successfully preserved the peace, was attacked and \r\nbrought into a border conflict by Eritrea in June 2008. \r\nSince then, the Government has spared no effort \r\nto resolve the dispute peacefully within regional and \r\ninternational organizations. In the conviction that \r\ndialogue is possible, my Government accepted the \r\ngood offices of His Royal Highness the Emir of Qatar \r\nand his mediation. On the ground, that took the form \r\nof deploying Qatari troops at the border between \r\nDjibouti and Eritrea and the withdrawal of Eritrean \r\ntroops from Ras Doumeira and Doumeira Island. The \r\nSecurity Council adopted resolutions 1862 (2009), 1907 \r\n(2009) and 2023 (2011) to express the concern of the \r\ninternational community in the light of that new crisis \r\nin the Horn of Africa.\r\nTo date, two and a half years after the signing \r\nof the mediation agreement, we are still waiting for \r\nthe demarcation of the border and the return of our \r\nprisoners of war. The request for the release of the \r\nDjibouti prisoners and the implementation of resolution \r\n1862 (2009) remain sensitive issues for my country. \r\nA new phase in the country’s political life is \r\nbeginning for the Somali people after more than \r\n20 years of suffering and violence. The momentum \r\nand enthusiasm prompted by those elections among \r\nSomalis in the diaspora and within the country are \r\nunprecedented. However, at this point it is crucial to \r\naddress two major challenges. The short-term priorities, \r\nnamely, security, good governance and economic \r\nrecovery, are challenges that the Somali Government \r\ncannot overcome alone. \r\nSomalia is at a crossroads and will need more than \r\never the support and cooperation of all its partners \r\nand friends. Donors and the international financial \r\ninstitutions must stand beside the new Somali leadership \r\nin order to help fulfil its new vision and to improve \r\nthe lives of Somalis as soon as possible. Their action \r\nmust be strengthened, coordinated and consistent with \r\nthe priorities of the new Government as there are many \r\nchallenges to overcome. Those challenges range from \r\nrestoring the security services to access to justice and \r\nfrom establishing the rule of law to respect for human \r\nrights, not to mention the problems of terrorism and \r\npiracy off the Somali coast, which will not disappear \r\nin the short term.\r\nIn short, it is clear that the end of the transition \r\nin Somalia does not mean the completion of the peace \r\nprocess. Politically, it is important that all phases of \r\nthe road map be implemented and that the political \r\ndialogue continue. From the humanitarian point of \r\nview, the situation remains critical. Millions of Somalis \r\nneed humanitarian assistance and have no means of \r\nsubsistence. The problem of refugees and internally \r\ndisplaced persons also remains a source of concern. \r\nRestoring security and maintaining it is not the \r\neasiest thing in Somalia giving the new upsurge in \r\nthe terrorist acts and guerrilla tactics of extremist \r\ngroups, such as Al-Shabaab, despite the undeniable \r\nsuccess of the troops of the African Union Mission in \r\nSomalia (AMISOM) and of the Somali and Ethiopian \r\nsecurity forces.\r\nI would like to pay tribute here to the memory of the \r\nlate Meles Zenawi, former Prime Minister of Ethiopia, \r\nwho made peace his centrepiece. I would also like to \r\nexpress admiration for the tireless efforts and heavy \r\nsacrifices of the AMISOM troops, the Somali Security \r\nForces and the allied forces. Their contribution was and \r\nremains invaluable to improving the security situation in \r\nMogadishu and the surrounding areas. The international \r\ncommunity must ensure the continued, predictable and \r\n16 12-52557\r\nA/67/PV.19\r\nMy Government remains convinced that mediation \r\nis the path that will enable us to achieve peace. We will \r\nnever stop believing in the virtues of dialogue, which \r\nis the only way for our region to strengthen the gains \r\nof peace.\r\nThe events that have taken place in the world \r\nin recent weeks following the dissemination of an \r\nanti-Islam film and of caricatures denigrating the \r\nimage of the Prophet of Islam cannot and must not leave \r\nthe international community indifferent. The tragic \r\nconsequences that led in particular to the loss of human \r\nlives demand our attention. Political and religious \r\nleaders and all people of goodwill must form a common \r\nfront against extremist and fanatical excesses of all \r\nkinds. Given the desire of some to spread religious \r\nintolerance, States Members of the United Nations must \r\nensure that the provisions of the Human Rights Council \r\nconsensus resolution 16/18 and General Assembly \r\nconsensus resolution 66/167 provide the answer. \r\nWhile all legal steps must be taken to ensure freedom \r\nof expression, it is just as important that malicious acts \r\nthat incite people to religious hatred, discrimination, \r\nviolence and intimidation through negative stereotypes, \r\nas well as violence and discrimination on the basis of \r\nreligion, in particular against Muslims or any other \r\ngroup, must be condemned and rejected, in accordance \r\nwith the relevant human rights instruments.\r\nGiven their increasing role in our modern societies, \r\nthe media and social networks have responsibilities \r\nand must be on the side of those who contribute to \r\nunderstanding and respect among the various cultures \r\nand civilizations. It is more urgent than ever to be \r\non the side of tolerance, moderation and reason. All \r\ninitiatives and actions that promote peace in minds and \r\nhearts and mutual understanding among peoples must \r\nbe encouraged. \r\nThe establishment of the United Nations gave rise \r\nto immense hope in the world following the Second \r\nWorld War and symbolized the will of all peoples of \r\nthe world not to be plunged again into the throes of \r\nwar. The Organization has been a forum for all nations \r\nunder colonization and a platform for them to acquire \r\nsovereignty and to free themselves from domination.\r\nHowever, it seems that, since 1947, there has \r\nbeen an exception, to the detriment of the Palestinian \r\npeople. Palestine still lives under occupation, \r\nwhich today is morally reprehensible and politically \r\nunacceptable. It is high time that justice be delivered \r\nto the Palestinian people and that the peace process \r\nbetween the Palestinian authorities and the occupying \r\nforce succeed. Freedom, justice, dignity and respect for \r\nhuman rights are the only bastions against extremist \r\nexcesses. The international community has a moral \r\nduty and a political responsibility to put an end to the \r\nsuffering of the Palestinian people, which has lasted for \r\nmore than 60 years.\r\nHistory is on the side of those that show the \r\npolitical courage required to achieve peace and to \r\ngive the peoples concerned hope for a better life. The \r\nrecognition of a Palestinian State as a fully-f ledged \r\nMember of the United Nations by the General Assembly \r\nis the first step in the solidarity that the international \r\ncommunity owes to the Palestinian people, who have \r\nshown patience and self lessness until now.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Walid Al-Moualem, Deputy Prime Minister and \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Expatriates of the \r\nSyrian Arab Republic.\r\nMr. Al-Moualem (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in \r\nArabic): I would like to congratulate Mr. Vuk Jeremić \r\nand his friendly country, the Republic of Serbia, on his \r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-seventh session and to wish him every success \r\nin conducting our work in a way that restores to the \r\nAssembly President his important and neutral role in \r\nfulfilling his duties without regard for any political, \r\nnational or international agendas that violate the rules \r\nof international law and contradict efforts to achieve \r\nsecurity and stability in the world. We also wish the \r\nSecretary-General every success in carrying out his \r\nduties and enhancing the purposes and principles \r\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nOur world today faces many events that are \r\naffecting its States and continue to cast their shadow \r\non the international arena. Many countries are facing \r\npolitical, economic and financial crises, whose their \r\nnegative consequences exceed the capacity of States to \r\ncope with them individually. \r\nWhile the peoples of the world await effective and \r\ncoordinated international efforts to overcome those \r\ncrises, the situation indicates instead an escalation \r\nof hegemony and domination over the fortunes \r\nand potentials of nations and peoples in a way that \r\ncontradicts the principles and purposes enshrined in \r\nthe Charter and the norms of international law. \r\n12-52557 17\r\nA/67/PV.19\r\nInstead of seeking to contribute to the settlement of \r\nregional and international disputes by peaceful means, \r\nsome well-known countries continue to pursue new \r\ncolonial policies based on political hypocrisy in dealing \r\nwith those crises. Under the pretext of humanitarian \r\nintervention, these countries interfere in the domestic \r\naffairs of States and impose unilateral economic \r\nsanctions that lack any moral or legal basis. Under the \r\npretext of concepts such as the responsibility to protect, \r\nthe drums of war are beaten and the seeds of sedition \r\nand unrest are sown to damage the structure of national \r\nsocieties. Perhaps worse of all, permanent members \r\nof the Security Council, who have launched wars \r\nunder the pretext of combating terrorism, now support \r\nterrorism in my country, without any regard for United \r\nNations resolutions that established the regulations and \r\nmechanisms for concerted international efforts to fight \r\nthis scourge without political polarization or double \r\nstandards.\r\nFor over a year now, my country has faced organized \r\nterrorism that has affected our citizens, our human and \r\nscientific cadres, our national institutions and many of \r\nSyria’s historic and archeological landmarks through \r\nterrorist bombings, assassinations, massacres, looting \r\nand acts of sabotage that have horrified citizens in \r\nmany parts of the country. The most recent example \r\nis the terrorist bombing that took place in Damascus \r\non 26 September. A terrorist group under the name of \r\nthe Al-Nusra Front, one of Al-Qaida’s affiliates, took \r\nresponsibility for that attack. \r\nIt is no surprise that the Security Council has \r\nfailed to condemn this and other terrorist bombings, \r\nas some of its members support such acts. This \r\nterrorism is externally supported and is accompanied \r\nby unprecedented media incitement seeking to ignite \r\nreligious extremism sponsored by well-known States \r\nin the region. Those States facilitate the f low of arms, \r\nmoney and fighters through the borders of some \r\nneighbouring countries. They also turn a blind eye to \r\nthe activities of terrorist groups crossing their borders, \r\nwhile others provide active material and logistical \r\nsupport from their territory for such groups. \r\nThese facts lead me to question whether the \r\ninternational consensus among Member States on \r\ncombating terrorism was serious or merely ink on \r\npaper. How should we understand the explicit request \r\nby the United States to the armed terrorist groups \r\nnot to surrender their arms in response to amnesty \r\ndecrees and decisions issued by the Syrian leadership? \r\nWe also wonder about the statements by Qatar, Saudi \r\nArabia, Turkey, the United States, France and others \r\nwho explicitly induce and support terrorism in Syria \r\nwith money, weapons and foreign fighters. To what \r\nextent are those statements in line with those countries’ \r\ninternational responsibility to combat terrorism? \r\nOne of the ironies that we face today is evident in the \r\nefforts to encourage extremists in countries within and \r\noutside our region to go to the Syrian border and enter \r\nthe country to carry out terrorist acts under the banner \r\nof jihad, in collaboration with terrorists from within \r\nthe country. This is a fact that has been confirmed by \r\nreports by both international and Arab observers. To \r\nthis very day, and as a result of this terrorism, Syria \r\nhas lost thousands of martyrs from among its military \r\nranks and its civilians. This is the price that Syria has \r\npaid for its efforts to defend the integrity of the Syrian \r\nState and its citizens in the face of that global terrorist \r\ncampaign.\r\nThe Syrian Government called for dialogue at the \r\nbeginning of the events in my country, but there was \r\nno positive response from most opposition parties. \r\nMoreover, my Government responded positively \r\nthroughout the crisis to each and every sincere \r\ninitiative aimed at finding a peaceful solution based \r\non national dialogue among Syrians, rejecting external \r\nmanipulation, stopping the shedding of Syrian blood \r\nand preserving the unity of Syria and its future. \r\nBased on this principled position, Syria cooperated \r\nwith the Arab observer mission and the subsequent \r\ninternational initiatives linked to the work of the Joint \r\nSpecial Envoy, Kofi Annan. We did so despite the \r\nconviction of the Syrian leadership that there are no \r\nsincere intentions on the part of certain regional and \r\ninternational parties who push for the escalation of the \r\nSyrian crisis, fuel its fire and prolong it by thwarting all \r\nattempts for dialogue, and insist on creating a state of \r\ninstability to ensure the need for foreign interference. \r\nSyria, on the basis of its principled position, \r\nreceived the United Nations Supervision Mission in \r\nthe Syrian Arab Republic (UNSMIS), and furnished it \r\nwith all the facilities needed to enable it to deploy in \r\nrecord time. The Syrian leadership also announced its \r\nfull commitment to the implementation of the six-point \r\nplan presented by Mr. Annan and started the practical \r\nimplementation of its provisions. It also welcomed the \r\nGeneva communiqué (A/66/865, annex) that stressed \r\nthe need for the implementation of those provisions. \r\n18 12-52557\r\nA/67/PV.19\r\nthem. That is blatant interference in the domestic affairs \r\nof Syria, which undermines the unity of its people and \r\nthe sovereignty of its decision-making. Only the people \r\nof Syria have the right to choose their own future and \r\nthe form of their State — one that accommodates all \r\ngroups and parties covering the entire spectrum of \r\nthe Syrian people, including those who have been \r\ndeceived and misled. It is the Syrian people who will \r\nchoose their leadership through the ballot box, which is \r\nthe most important tool of democracy and democratic \r\nexpression.\r\nIf some of the countries that are interfering in \r\nSyria’s internal affairs are proud of their democracy and \r\ntheir people’s freedom to choose, it would be better for \r\nthem to support us on our democratic path and leave the \r\nSyrian people to choose their leaders through elections, \r\nwhose form has been set by the new Constitution and the \r\nrelevant legislation, after which the ballot box will have \r\nthe final say. I say to those countries that we have had \r\nenough of illusions, and I invite the national opposition \r\nto work together to stop the shedding of Syrian blood, to \r\nsit at the negotiation table and to participate in building \r\nthe present and future.\r\nWe are not betting on any party or faction apart from \r\nthe Syrian people, who are uniformly determined to \r\nreject all forms of foreign interference in their domestic \r\naffairs and to defeat the advocates of sectarianism, \r\nextremism and terrorism, because in my country the \r\nlinks between State policies and the aspirations of the \r\npeople are very strong.\r\nDespite everything I have described about what my \r\ncountry is experiencing, we still believe in a political \r\nsolution as the essential way out of this crisis. From this \r\nrostrum I call, first, on all parties and political groups \r\nand factions, inside and outside Syria, to engage in a \r\nconstructive dialogue under the aegis of our homeland. \r\nThe doors of Syria, like its heart, are open to anyone \r\nwho wants constructive dialogue. To that end, I call \r\non all countries represented in the General Assembly \r\nto exert pressure to end the violence in my country by \r\nputting a stop to the arming, financing, harbouring and \r\ntraining of armed terrorist groups. Secondly, the results \r\nof that national dialogue, after being agreed on by all \r\nparties, will determine the map and future direction of \r\nthe country towards establishing a more pluralistic and \r\ndemocratic Syria.\r\nThe events in Syria have produced a surge in \r\nhumanitarian needs in several key sectors in areas \r\naffected by takfiri terrorist groups, which has led to \r\nHowever, the armed groups sought to exploit the Syrian \r\nGovernment’s commitment to the plan and the Geneva \r\ncommuniqué in order to make gains on the ground \r\nand expand the area of their presence. In addition, the \r\nstatements issued by some Western and Arab countries \r\nexposed the actors and States working to thwart these \r\ninitiatives.\r\nSyria welcomed the appointment of Mr. Lakhdar \r\nBrahimi as the Joint Special Representative, succeeding \r\nMr. Annan, and stressed its willingness to cooperate \r\nfully with him based on the principles agreed on by the \r\ninternational community, in particular the six-point plan \r\nand the Geneva final communiqué (S/2012/523, annex). \r\nI should point out that, in addition to the commitment of \r\nthe Syrian Government, the success of any international \r\neffort requires that the States supporting armed groups \r\nin my country — in particular Turkey, Saudi Arabia, \r\nQatar and Libya, among others — stop arming, funding, \r\ntraining and harbouring armed terrorist groups, and \r\ninstead encourage dialogue and renounce violence.\r\nFor more than a year now, we have said that what \r\nmy country is witnessing is a two-sided problem: one \r\nside is based on the need for the political, economic \r\nand social reforms that the public demands; the other \r\nis based on the exploitation of those public needs and \r\ndemands in the service of goals that are completely \r\nunconnected to the demands of the Syrian people and \r\ntheir interests, and for which those peaceful demands \r\nare being used as a vehicle for armed groups working \r\nto sow sedition and undermine security in my country.\r\nI referred to that in my statement from this rostrum \r\nlast year (see A/66/PV.25). I have returned today to \r\ntell the Assembly that the Syrian Government has \r\ntaken serious and important steps towards reform, \r\nculminating in a new Constitution that embraces \r\npolitical pluralism and that has been adopted by popular \r\nreferendum. As a result, parliamentary elections open \r\nto multiple political parties were held. I can also say \r\nthat Syria is continuing to work with patriotic members \r\nof the opposition to build a new and pluralist Syria that \r\nis responsive to its people’s aspirations. At the same \r\ntime, Syria is determined to fulfil its duty to protect its \r\npeople from jihadist and takfiri terrorism, which armed \r\nterrorist groups are using to spread chaos and sedition \r\namong Syrians, threatening their peaceful coexistence.\r\nThere have been calls from this rostrum and at \r\nother forums asking the President of the Syrian Arab \r\nRepublic to step down, made by people who are ignorant \r\nof or ignore the facts, or who have a stake in distorting \r\n12-52557 19\r\nA/67/PV.19\r\nrelevant resolutions of the Security Coucil, in particular \r\nresolution 497 (1981).\r\nSyria renews its support for the legitimate call \r\non the international community to recognize a free \r\nand independent Palestinian State on the Palestinian \r\nterritories occupied in 1967. As everyone knows, the \r\nfailure of efforts to achieve a just and comprehensive \r\npeace in the Middle East on the basis of the international \r\nterms of reference endorsed by the international \r\ncommunity as a basis for peace between Palestinians \r\nand Israelis is due to the unilateral positions and actions \r\nof Israel, especially Israel’s insistence on continuing its \r\nsettlement policy and its evasion of the requirements \r\nof peace.\r\nMy country renews its call for the international \r\ncommunity to work to rid the Middle East of all \r\nweapons of mass destruction. In that context, we recall \r\nthe initiative put forward by Syria in late 2003, during \r\nits tenure as a non-permanent member in the Security \r\nCouncil for the period 2002 to 2003, and we call on the \r\nCouncil to adopt it. Syria stresses that ridding the region \r\nof all weapons of mass destruction cannot be achieved \r\nwithout forcing Israel, the only nuclear Power in the \r\nregion, to adhere to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \r\nof Nuclear Weapons and to place its nuclear facilities \r\nunder the comprehensive inspections regime of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency. At the same time, \r\nwe emphasize the Treaty’s provisions guaranteeing the \r\nright of every State to acquire nuclear technology for \r\npeaceful purposes.\r\nThe insistence of the United States and countries \r\nof the European Union and others to impose unilateral \r\neconomic measures violates the rules and norms of \r\ninternational law and the principles of free trade. It \r\nalso raises questions about the legality and morality of \r\nsuch practices. On that basis, we call for the lifting of \r\nthe embargo that the United States has imposed against \r\nCuba for decades. We also renew our call for ending \r\nall unilateral coercive measures imposed on the peoples \r\nof other countries, such as the Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela, Belarus, the Islamic Republic of Iran, the \r\nSyrian Arab Republic and the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea.\r\nOur aspiration to achieve a positive reform of this \r\ninternational Organization stems from our desire to \r\ncreate a world based on justice, security and prosperity \r\nfor all the peoples of the world, free from the colonial \r\nand hegemonic tendencies of some countries that seek \r\ndeteriorating living conditions for Syrian citizens \r\nwho live there. While my Government is working \r\nhard to meet the basic needs of citizens who have \r\nbeen forced to f lee their homes by the violence of \r\narmed groups, some have sought to fabricate a refugee \r\ncrisis in neighbouring countries by inciting armed \r\ngroups to intimidate Syrian civilians in border areas, \r\nforcing them to f lee to those countries. There they are \r\naccommodated in military training bases or camps that \r\nresemble places of detention, in arid or rugged regions. \r\nTheir plight is being exploited in order to secure aid \r\nthat is mostly spent on things that have nothing to do \r\nwith humanitarian purposes. I appeal to those Syrian \r\ncitizens from this rostrum to return to their towns and \r\nvillages, where the State will guarantee their safe return \r\nand dignified lives, free from the inhuman conditions \r\nthey are enduring in those camps.\r\nAt this point, I would like to ask a legitimate \r\nquestion about the credibility of those who claim \r\nto care about providing humanitarian assistance in \r\nresponse to Syrian citizens’ needs, and about how such \r\nclaims correspond with a policy of tightening unilateral \r\neconomic sanctions that have a severe effect on those \r\nsame citizens’ living conditions, whose interests \r\nthose imposing the sanctions claim to serve. How can \r\nimposing sanctions on the banking, health, transport \r\nand other sectors be consistent with caring for Syrians’ \r\nbest interests?\r\nI also wonder if the legitimate public demands of our \r\ncitizens, to which the Syrian leadership has responded \r\ntransparently and sincerely, justify their being used by \r\nsome as an excuse to continue providing every kind \r\nof military, financial and media support to those who \r\nare killing innocent people in Syria — who include \r\njournalists, doctors, university professors and even \r\nreligious figures. Or is this simply another practical \r\ninterpretation of the concept of creative chaos, which \r\ncontributes only to strengthening Western hegemony \r\nover Mediterranean countries, and serves only Israel’s \r\nexpansionist interests?\r\nWhat is happening in my country must not lead \r\nus to lose our basic focus, which is Palestine and the \r\nSyrian Golan. The Syrian Arab Republic therefore \r\nreaffirms its natural right to recover all of the occupied \r\nSyrian Golan up to the 4 June 1967 borders. Syria \r\nunderscores its rejection of all measures taken by Israel, \r\nthe occupying Power, to change the natural geographic \r\nand other aspects of the Golan, in clear violation of the \r\n20 12-52557\r\nA/67/PV.19\r\nof a standard of living that has led Barbados to be \r\nconsistently ranked among the top 50 nations in the \r\nUnited Nations Development Programme’s annual \r\nHuman Development Index.\r\nMr. Balé (Congo), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nSuch a status has been achieved as a result of the \r\ncommitment of successive Governments to invest \r\nheavily in our people, particularly in education, health \r\nand other social safety nets. As a nation poor in natural \r\nresources, we have placed priority on our greatest \r\nresource, our people. A significant factor in our ability \r\nto overcome our constraints at the national level has \r\nbeen the tripartite social partnership comprising \r\nGovernment, workers’ unions and employers. The \r\npartnership grew out of an economic crisis during \r\nthe early 1990s and continues to function effectively \r\ntoday. Those strategies have been reinforced by our \r\ncommitment to observing the rule of law. We are a \r\nprincipled country that firmly adheres to the core \r\nvalues enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, \r\nincluding respect for the rule of the law, respect for \r\nhuman rights and the principle of sovereign equality.\r\nWe have been classified as a middle-income \r\ndeveloping country. In reality, we are a small island \r\ndeveloping State, characterized by high debt, high \r\nvulnerability to external shocks, and susceptibility to \r\nthe impacts of climate change and natural disasters. \r\nThe global economic and environmental situation has \r\nhad a disproportionate effect on our successful, but \r\nnevertheless vulnerable, economy. We bear the burden \r\nof rising food and fuel prices and a decline in foreign \r\ninvestment. Our efforts to address those threats have \r\nbeen severely undermined by international financial \r\nand cooperation mechanisms that fail to take account of \r\nthe vulnerability and capacity constraints that we face \r\nBarbados and similar vulnerable countries have been \r\ngraduated from grant and concessionary financing by \r\nmultilateral institutions, such as the Inter-American \r\nDevelopment Bank and the World Bank, without regard \r\nfor our unique situation. There is a clear need for greater \r\nequity, fairness and transparency in the process used to \r\ndetermine classifications and resource allocation. The \r\npersistent use of international classification and ratings \r\nsystems that are solely based on gross domestic product \r\nper capita and other narrow criteria must be expanded \r\nin scope to take into account meaningful variables such \r\nas vulnerability.\r\nIn this context, we welcome the assertion by the \r\nSecretary-General that the use of per capita income to \r\nto exploit the United Nations to achieve their own \r\ninterests at the expense of other countries.\r\nWe hope that the United Nations can take the \r\npeoples of the world to a better future that fulfils their \r\naspirations for life, coexistence, development and food \r\nsufficiency, free from all forms of tension, confrontation \r\nand war, in accordance with the purpopses and \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations, which \r\nseek to preserve the sovereignty and equality of States \r\nin rights and duties.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on Her Excellency \r\nMs. Maxine Pamela Ometa McClean, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs and Foreign Trade of Barbados.\r\nMs. McClean (Barbados): On behalf of my \r\ndelegation, I have the honour to congratulate His \r\nExcellency Mr. Vuk Jeremić, President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-seventh session, on his election. \r\nI assure him of the full support and cooperation of \r\nthe delegation of Barbados during his presidency. Let \r\nme also convey my appreciation to his predecessor, \r\nMr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-sixth session, for his able \r\nleadership during that session.\r\nThe theme of this year’s session, “Bringing about \r\nadjustment or settlement of international disputes \r\nor situations by peaceful means”, underscores a core \r\nprinciple of the Charter of the United Nations. In \r\nthe current global environment, where challenges to \r\ninternational peace and security are widespread, it is \r\nimportant to reaffirm the validity of that principle as \r\none of the cornerstones on which the Organization is \r\nfounded.\r\nAs a small island developing State, Barbados \r\nis severely challenged by the global financial and \r\neconomic crisis and the recession that has resulted from \r\nit. Moreover, climate change and other environmental \r\nchallenges continue to pose significant threats to the \r\nachievements of Barbados since its independence, \r\nin November 1966. As a relatively young nation, our \r\nindependence was achieved by negotiation rather \r\nthan by war. We have enjoyed the benefits of stability \r\nfor more than 370 years of unbroken parliamentary \r\nGovernment. We are a peace-loving, democratic nation, \r\nextremely proud of our political and economic stability. \r\nOur relatively peaceful situation does not mean that \r\nwe are insulated or isolated from the prevailing global \r\ninstability that is very evident today. Our political \r\nand social stability have facilitated the achievement \r\n12-52557 21\r\nA/67/PV.19\r\nBarbados and other small island developing States \r\nhave thrown their full support behind the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s Sustainable Energy for All initiative. In May \r\nthis year, the Government of Barbados, in collaboration \r\nwith the United Nations Development Programme, \r\nhosted a High-level Conference of the small island \r\ndeveloping States on achieving sustainable energy for \r\nall in SIDS, focused on challenges, opportunities and \r\ncommitments. At that meeting the Barbados Declaration \r\nwas adopted, outlining an ambitious and action-oriented \r\nagenda for achieving the goal of sustainable energy \r\nfor all in SIDS. As a concrete expression of our solid \r\ndetermination, some 22 SIDS agreed to inscribe, in \r\nan annex to the Declaration, a spectrum of ambitious \r\nvoluntary commitments to promote transformational \r\nactivities in the areas of renewable energy, energy \r\nefficiency, energy access and low-carbon development. \r\nI commend the Governments of Australia, Denmark, \r\nNew Zealand, Norway and the United Kingdom for \r\npledging, in the Barbados Declaration, to support SIDS \r\nin the implementation of our ambitious commitments. \r\nWe urge other development partners to join us on \r\nthis journey to ensure our energy independence. For \r\nus, sustainable development is not possible without \r\nsustainable energy.\r\nBarbados shares the view of the Secretary-General \r\nthat the United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (Rio +20) in Brazil this year reached a \r\nnumber of important milestones. In the words of the \r\nPrime Minister of Barbados, \r\n“Rio +20 will be remembered as that unique moment \r\nin time when we decided not to yield to our fears, \r\nbut rather to transform this present period of global \r\nuncertainty and volatility into a major opportunity \r\nto set new agendas, which can then be developed \r\nmore fully over the next few years”. \r\nBarbados welcomes the agreement at Rio to \r\nconvene the third Global Conference on SIDS in 2014, \r\nsome two decades after the convening of the first SIDS \r\nConference in Barbados. The international community \r\ncan be assured that Barbados will do its part to ensure \r\nthe success of the Conference.\r\nDuring this session, the Assembly will consider \r\na draft resolution on the sustainable development of \r\nthe Caribbean Sea. Within the Caribbean we have \r\nrecognized that an integrated management approach \r\nthat involves all stakeholders provides us with the \r\nbest option for protecting the Caribbean Sea, our most \r\nclassify countries as a means of guiding development \r\ncooperation disregards the nature and multidimensional \r\nnature of development. Barbados endorses the need \r\nfor the adoption of new indices and measures of \r\ndevelopment and applauds the ongoing work of bodies \r\nsuch as the Commonwealth and the United Nations \r\nStatistical Commission to develop new indices.\r\nThere is no greater threat to the survival, viability \r\nand indeed the security of my country and other small \r\nisland developing States (SIDS) than the threat posed \r\nby climate change. Science continues to warn that we \r\nare on the threshold of irreversible and potentially \r\ncatastrophic changes to the global climate system. \r\nGlobal emissions, the main cause of human-induced \r\nclimate change, are rising at their fastest rate in history, \r\neven as we bear witness to massive and accelerating ice \r\nloss from the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica \r\nand a doubling of the rate of sea-level rise. \r\nWe are at a major turning point in the history \r\nof mankind. Are we willing to sacrifice the most \r\nvulnerable members of the international community? \r\nThat is the stark choice we face. But after the islands \r\ndisappear, who will be next? Inaction or inadequate \r\naction is inexcusable and morally indefensible, given \r\nthe level of certainty of the scientific evidence before us \r\nand the technological and financial tools at our disposal \r\nto effect the necessary change. \r\nWhile some useful progress was made at the \r\nDurban Climate Change Conference in December \r\nlast year, we are not close to finding a solution to \r\nthe problem. Barbados welcomes the decision taken \r\nin Durban to launch negotiations on a new legally \r\nbinding agreement that would take effect after 2020. \r\nHowever, for us a post-2020 agreement is meaningless \r\nif ambitious actions are not taken now to reduce \r\nglobal emissions and provide finance and technology \r\nto vulnerable developing countries. That is essential \r\nif we are to adapt to the ever-worsening impacts of \r\nclimate change. The upcoming United Nations Climate \r\nChange Conference in Doha must therefore prioritize \r\nthe pre-2020 actions necessary to ensure that the \r\nworld is on track in 2020 to meet the below 2 degree \r\nor 1.5 degree globally agreed goals. Such actions will \r\nrequire clarity from developed countries on the scale of \r\nclimate finance after the end of the fast-start finance \r\nperiod this year and a greater sense of urgency and \r\nambition in reducing global emissions before 2020 to \r\nminimize and avoid potentially catastrophic impacts of \r\nclimate change.\r\n22 12-52557\r\nA/67/PV.19\r\nreinforcing. Barbados is therefore heartened that in \r\ndealing with conflict prevention, the United Nations \r\nhas moved beyond traditional preventive diplomacy. \r\nWe support the pursuit of comprehensive strategies \r\nthat address deep-rooted structural causes of conflict, \r\npoverty eradication and development, human rights and \r\nthe rule of law, elections and the building of democratic \r\ninstitutions.\r\nAs a family of nations, we continue to strive for \r\nthe achievement of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs). Success has been mixed, and made \r\nmore difficult by the current global financial crisis. The \r\ntarget implementation date of 2015 looms large, and \r\nwe share international concerns that the MDGs may \r\nbecome casualties of the current environment. As we \r\narticulate the post-2015 development agenda, we must \r\nnot lose sight of the urgency of fulfilling these goals.\r\nLet me reiterate my country’s commitment to \r\nthe rule of law and our unwavering commitment to \r\nthe principles enshrined in the Charter of the United \r\nNations. I take this opportunity to speak out against \r\nthe continued unilateral imposition of the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo against Cuba by \r\nthe United States. Barbados joins the overwhelming \r\nmajority of Member States in opposing this action, \r\nwhich has persisted for too long. This situation merits \r\nimmediate resolution if the unnecessary hardship and \r\nsuffering it has wrought on the Cuban people is to \r\nend. We therefore encourage constructive engagement \r\nbetween the two sides.\r\nStrong, functioning democracies are the foundation \r\non which international peace, security and prosperity \r\nare built. As a democratic State with a longstanding and \r\nfirm commitment to effective multilateralism, Barbados \r\nreiterates the crucial nexus between development, \r\npeace, security and human rights. The United Nations \r\nis the only global body with the unquestionable \r\nlegitimacy to lead a global response to the challenges \r\nfacing humanity. Recognizing this, Barbados remains \r\nsteadfast in its commitment to the United Nations and \r\nall it stands for.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now give \r\nthe f loor to His Excellency Mr. Osman Mohammed \r\nSaleh, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the State of \r\nEritrea.\r\nMr. Saleh (Eritrea): Let me start by extending my \r\nsincere congratulations to the President of the General \r\nAssembly and his country, Serbia, upon his election to \r\nvaluable shared resource. Barbados has led the regional \r\neffort in the Association of Caribbean States to create \r\nthe Caribbean Sea Commission. The Commission \r\nrepresents an oceans governance framework to promote \r\ncooperation towards effective management of the \r\nCaribbean Sea area. Barbados calls on the international \r\ncommunity to support this initiative, including \r\nthrough the designation by the General Assembly of \r\nthe Caribbean Sea as a special area in the context of \r\nsustainable development.\r\nCitizen security remains a major concern for \r\nBarbados. The Caribbean Community subregion \r\nhas become a major transit and destination point \r\nfor the trafficking of illicit drugs and firearms. As a \r\nconsequence, the incidence of crime and violence \r\ncontinues to escalate in the region and threatens \r\nto reverse many of our economic and social gains. \r\nDeveloping countries like ours have been compelled \r\nto divert financial and other resources earmarked for \r\nsocial and economic development for use in combating \r\nthis transnational scourge.\r\nThe heavy toll that that takes on the populations of \r\nour region brings into sharp focus the importance of \r\nthe United Nations Programme of Action to Prevent, \r\nCombat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms \r\nand Light Weapons in All Its Aspects. It also emphasizes \r\nthe need for a strong, legally binding arms trade treaty, \r\nwhich sets the highest possible international standards \r\nfor the transfer of conventional arms. We share the \r\nprofound disappointment of many Member States at \r\nthe failure of the Arms Trade Treaty Conference to \r\nreach agreement on a treaty text before its conclusion. \r\nBarbados cannot envisage an arms trade treaty that \r\ndoes not include small arms and light weapons, their \r\ncomponents and ammunition. Barbados expects that, \r\ndespite the setback, negotiations on the arms trade \r\ntreaty will resume during this session.\r\nAt the national level, we are appreciative of \r\ncontinuing cooperation with bilateral partners and \r\nregional and international bodies like the United Nations \r\nOffice on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). These include \r\nprogrammes aimed at preventing and reducing levels \r\nof violence and crime in our society. We look forward \r\nto the imminent reopening of the UNODC Office for \r\nthe Caribbean subregion, which my Government has \r\noffered once again to host.\r\nIt is well recognized that peace, security and \r\ndevelopment are inextricably linked and mutually \r\n12-52557 23\r\nA/67/PV.19\r\nUnited Nations — are being eroded and wilfully \r\nf louted. The noble aims of protecting human rights \r\nand civilian lives are being selectively and cynically \r\nemployed to justify military aggression, external \r\nintervention and imposition of sanctions — collective \r\nas well as unilateral — to destabilize nations, change \r\nGovernments and gain economic advantages.\r\nThis summary assessment, Eritrea believes, is \r\nshared by the majority of States Members of the United \r\nNations. It is indeed the position of Africa, of most \r\ndeveloping countries, the Non-Aligned Movement, the \r\nemerging Powers and many in the developed world. \r\nWhat this emerging consensus now needs is a concerted \r\nand coordinated effort to effect real change, including \r\nin the United Nations system, that would lead to a more \r\npeaceful, just and equitable world.\r\nNo part of the world is in need of positive change \r\nmore than the African continent, which remains \r\nmarginalized and almost voiceless. And yet Africa is \r\na continent of massive potential, and there are already \r\nunmistakable, if tentative, signs of its awakening. A \r\nnumber of African countries are taking serious steps \r\nin the economic, political and social arenas and the \r\nrevitalization of the African Union proceeds apace. \r\nWe hope that this African initiative, which will have a \r\nsalutary effect on the world economy and international \r\ngovernance, will be supported by a more conducive \r\ninternational environment and by the United Nations.\r\nEritrea is convinced that our subregion, the Horn \r\nof Africa, will overcome its current difficulties and \r\nmake a substantial contribution to the re-emergence \r\nof a dynamic and prosperous Africa. Despite the \r\ndifficulties it has faced, it has made remarkable progress \r\nin providing and caring for its people and rebuilding \r\nits economy, and has embarked on modernizing its \r\ninfrastructure, including developing renewable energy, \r\nwith the perspective of regional trade, investment and \r\nintegration. It will continue to work to ensure a life of \r\ndignity and prosperity for its citizens, in a peaceful and \r\ncooperative region, and a more just and equitable world.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now give \r\nthe f loor to His Excellency Mr. G. L. Peiris, Minister for \r\nExternal Affairs of the Democratic Socialist Republic \r\nof Sri Lanka.\r\nMr. Peiris (Sri Lanka): On behalf of the Government \r\nof the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, I \r\ncongratulate Vuk Jeremić on his election as President \r\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. \r\npreside over the sixty-seventh session. I am confident \r\nthat, with his extensive experience and diplomatic skill, \r\nhe will lead this session of the General Assembly to \r\na successful conclusion. I pledge the support of the \r\nEritrean delegation for his noble efforts for the common \r\ngood.\r\nI wish to pay profound tribute to the outgoing \r\nPresident, Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, for his \r\ncommendable work at the sixty-sixth session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. He indeed served us well. I would \r\nalso like to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for \r\nhis leadership and his report (A/67/2) on the work of \r\nour United Nations at the outset of this general debate.\r\nAlmost seven decades have elapsed since the \r\nestablishment of the United Nations, and, undoubtedly, \r\nthe world has seen much political, economic, social \r\nand technological progress. However, it is clear that \r\nthe United Nations has not succeeded in its paramount \r\npurpose of saving humankind from the scourge of \r\nwar. In the past 67 years, there has hardly been one in \r\nwhich no war raged somewhere in the world. What is \r\nparticularly significant is the fact that in most of these \r\nwars, the major Powers were the main architects and \r\nactors — those same Powers which, by virtue of their \r\nposition in the Security Council, should have shouldered \r\nthe greatest responsibility in the maintenance of peace \r\nand stability.\r\nOn another front, and again despite the progress \r\nmade, in the twenty-first century, hundreds of \r\nmillions of people in the developing world, as well as \r\nin developed countries, continue to suffer from the \r\nscourge of poverty, easily preventable diseases and \r\navoidable premature deaths.\r\nIn addition to the twin scourges of war and \r\npoverty, our world now faces an environmental threat \r\nthat puts human livelihoods and survival at risk. It is \r\ntherefore disconcerting that the current global political, \r\neconomic and security architecture is inadequate to \r\naddress the challenges that we all face. The United \r\nNations system, as has been repeatedly pointed out, \r\nis indeed outdated. The General Assembly has been \r\nemasculated. The Security Council is dominated by \r\none powerful permanent member, and is increasingly \r\nbecoming paralysed. Change is being resisted by \r\nthose who believe they have benefited from the old, \r\nanachronistic order. Respect for the sovereign equality \r\nand territorial integrity of nations and non-interference \r\nin their internal affairs — which constitute the \r\npillars of international law and the Charter of the \r\n24 12-52557\r\nA/67/PV.19\r\nstruggling to regain lost opportunities and improve the \r\nlivelihood of their people while staring global warming \r\nin the face. Our carbon footprint remains negligible. \r\nIt is imperative that the developed world deliver on its \r\nsolemn undertakings to assist developing countries, as \r\nwe seek the common goal of arresting climate change, \r\nwhich is caused by human activities.\r\nThe United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (Rio+20), held in June 2012, demonstrated \r\nconvincingly the efficacy of United Nations processes. \r\nThe potential of the green economy, however, will be \r\nless attractive if we do not clearly understand its long-\r\nterm consequences at the national level for sustainable \r\neconomic strategies. The transition to a green economy \r\nmust not generate negative externalities that retard \r\neconomic growth and perpetuate societal inequity \r\nand poverty. Assistance to developing countries under \r\nNorth-South development cooperation mechanisms \r\nmust take into account global initiatives to mitigate \r\nthe adverse consequences of too rigid an application of \r\ngreen economic principles. The efforts of developing \r\ncountries themselves in this regard must be recognized \r\nand further facilitated. \r\nAs Member States, we must respect the principles \r\npatiently negotiated by the international community. \r\nThese are, in particular, the equality of rights, \r\nthe equal sovereignty of all States and the right to \r\ndevelopment, as underlined in the Rio+20 outcome \r\ndocument (resolution 66/288, annex). The interests of \r\nthe developing world must be entrenched and protected. \r\nHence, no constraining conditions should be applied to \r\ndevelopment models or approaches adopted by Member \r\nStates that could prevent the achievement of sustainable \r\ndevelopment together with the eradication of poverty.\r\nThe middle-income countries are the main driving \r\nforce for strengthening our global economy. Sri Lanka’s \r\nbalanced socioeconomic policy strategies propelled \r\nus to middle-income status a few years ago. As we \r\nhave repeatedly emphasized, countries’ attainment \r\nof middle-income status does not by itself provide a \r\nsolution to the issue of poverty and other development \r\nchallenges.\r\nI wish to mention in particular that Sri Lanka \r\nemploys a unique development strategy that empowers \r\ncitizens, with special attention to social development \r\nneeds. It has continued to achieve transformational \r\nchange in the lives of its people by effectively \r\nmobilizing available resources and delivering \r\nsustainable and citizen-centred programmes. Sri Lanka \r\nHis proven skills and charming personality leave no \r\nroom for doubt that under his able leadership we will \r\nachieve our goals for this session. Sri Lanka is also \r\npleased to endorse the theme proposed by him for this \r\nyear’s high-level debate.\r\nFor 67 years, the United Nations has provided the \r\npremier forum for the resolution of international disputes \r\nand the negotiation of landmark global goals. In the \r\nconduct of international relations, Sri Lanka, a founding \r\nmember of the Non-Aligned Movement, firmly upholds \r\nthe tenets of peaceful coexistence, mutual respect \r\nfor each other’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, \r\nnon-interference in the internal affairs of other States, \r\nequality and mutual benefit. Sri Lanka believes that, \r\nin the settlement of international disputes, action must \r\nbe based on the fundamental principle of the sovereign \r\nequality of States, a principle firmly enshrined in the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. The noticeable recent \r\ntendency to selectively and arbitrarily intervene in the \r\ninternal affairs of States f lies in the face of this principle \r\nand dilutes the confidence so carefully nurtured in the \r\nUnited Nations system.\r\nThe global financial crisis has posed a major \r\nchallenge to the entire international community. In \r\nthis context, it is of the greatest importance to ensure \r\nthat any strategies employed to achieve recovery do not \r\nimpose unjustifiable burdens on developing countries, \r\nas they strive to achieve better living conditions for \r\ntheir people. A recovery that does not simultaneously \r\nuplift developing countries will be, by its very nature, \r\nunsustainable. It is paradoxical that the very countries \r\nin which the financial crisis originated now seek to \r\nprovide policy prescriptions for others. \r\nIt has been noted that many countries of the South \r\nhave weathered the financial storm successfully. Sri \r\nLanka’s economy, which has been carefully managed \r\nduring this period, is one of the Asian economies \r\nthat has recorded impressive gains by any standard. \r\nA growth rate of 8.2 per cent was achieved in 2011. \r\nFollowing the end of the conflict in 2009, the areas \r\nformerly controlled by terrorists, namely the northern \r\nprovince, recorded a 27 per cent growth in gross \r\ndomestic product in 2011. The exponential boom in \r\nagriculture and fisheries in particular has contributed \r\nsubstantially to this result.\r\nWe are now at a significant juncture in human \r\nhistory, as climate change looms as the greatest \r\nchallenge to the very existence of humanity. Many \r\ndeveloping countries, including my own, are still \r\n12-52557 25\r\nA/67/PV.19\r\nLanka is firmly committed to redressing the grievances \r\nof all parties affected by the internal conflict. After \r\nthe release of the report of the Lessons Learnt and \r\nReconciliation Commission, a local mechanism set in \r\nplace by the President of Sri Lanka, an action plan to \r\ngive expeditious effect to its recommendations was \r\nadopted. A comprehensive national action plan for \r\nhuman rights with specific timelines has been approved \r\nby the Cabinet of Ministers. The Government has also \r\nproposed a transparent and democratic process under a \r\nparliamentary select committee to address post-conflict \r\nreconciliation issues. That initiative has, regrettably, \r\nbeen delayed by the failure of some opposition parties \r\nto nominate their representatives.\r\nSri Lanka exemplifies the challenges faced by \r\na society emerging from the shadow of a sustained \r\nconflict that spanned three decades; the country is now \r\nentering an era of peace and tranquillity. The gradual \r\ndiminution of the challenges and the brevity of the \r\nperiod that has elapsed since the end of the conflict \r\nleave no room for doubt as to the degree of success \r\nachieved by the Government of Sri Lanka with respect \r\nto a wide range of issues relating to development and \r\nreconciliation. It has only been about three years since \r\nthe conflict ended.\r\nPrioritization was a central feature of the \r\nGovernment’s plan of action. The progress on the \r\nground during the last three years with regard to \r\nthe resettlement of internally displaced persons; the \r\nreintegration into society of thousands of ex-combatants \r\nafter exposure to programmes of livelihood skills \r\ntraining, which equipped them to earn their living with \r\ndignity and independence; the rapid completion of the \r\nmine-clearance process; and the unprecedented focus \r\non infrastructure development leading to very visible \r\ninvigoration of the economy of the island as a whole, \r\nand the Northern province in particular, are quite \r\napparent.\r\nThe experience of Sri Lanka demonstrates that, \r\nwith the dynamic leadership of high quality and the \r\nunwavering commitment that President Mahinda \r\nRajapaksa has provided, along with an effective \r\npolitical and military strategy and strong rapport with \r\nall sections of the public, it is possible to prevail against \r\nthe most ruthless forces of terror. No one has a greater \r\ncommitment to reconciliation in an all-inclusive spirit \r\nthan our Government. Unhelpful external pressures \r\nthat support narrow partisan interests could easily \r\nderail initiatives that have produced very substantial \r\nhas emphasized synergistic interactions between health \r\ncare and education, public infrastructure development, \r\nincluding improved water and sanitation, transport \r\nand communications, especially under an integrated \r\nregional development approach, which we consider to \r\nbe important. We also enjoy a 98 per cent literacy rate, \r\nwith the score for girls being even higher. The success \r\nof this strategy is reflected in Sri Lanka’s high ranking \r\non the human development index, of which we are \r\nlegitimately proud.\r\nSri Lanka has achieved many of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) and is well on track to \r\nrealize all of them by 2015, including the eradication \r\nof poverty. Eradicating poverty and improving the \r\nquality of life of our people has been the cornerstone \r\nof social development policies in Sri Lanka over \r\nmany decades. Sri Lanka’s key policy document, \r\n“Mahinda Chintana —Vision for the Future”, has set \r\nspecific targets to combat poverty within the MDG \r\nframework. A range of projects has been designed \r\nfor the eradication of poverty by 2016. Through the \r\nGama Naguma and Divi Naguma programmes, which \r\ndeal with village awakening and the enhancement of \r\nlivelihoods and incomes, we have been addressing \r\nrural poverty eradication and ensuring food security. \r\nThese programmes continue to promote the concept \r\nof self-employment, directing financial and technical \r\nassistance to youth and women in rural areas, including \r\nthose who suffered from the terrorist conflict. \r\nThe contribution of women in Sri Lanka’s \r\nsuccessful realization of most of the MDGs is of great \r\nsignificance. Women who are literate also encourage \r\ntheir children to focus on education and aspire to higher \r\ngoals. It is through the participation of women that Sri \r\nLanka has been recognized for its achievements in the \r\nWorld Health Organization breastfeeding promotion \r\nand immunization programmes. I note with great pride \r\nthat Sri Lanka produced the first elected woman Prime \r\nMinister in the world in 1960.\r\nWe have made genuine efforts to ensure that the \r\nfruits of economic development are equally distributed \r\nand are accessible, especially to the most vulnerable \r\nsegments of society. We have ensured that social \r\nmobility is not confined to the privileged in the towns \r\nand cities of the island, but penetrates deep into the \r\nrural hinterland.\r\nThree years ago, our Government ended the \r\nterrorist challenge largely through its own efforts. Sri \r\n26 12-52557\r\nA/67/PV.19\r\nProcess, we are committed to cooperation in capacity-\r\nbuilding, the exchange of best practices and law \r\nenforcement cooperation. At the same time, we believe \r\nin the necessity to share information in good faith, \r\nacknowledging that action on the part of a variety of \r\nMember States, with their various national interests, is \r\nessential to counter the sophisticated human smuggling \r\nrings.\r\nOne long-standing issue that weighs on the \r\nconscience of the international community and which \r\nneeds our sustained collective attention is the restoration \r\nof the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people. Sri \r\nLanka fully supports the implementation of all relevant \r\nUnited Nations resolutions on Palestine, which will \r\npave the way for the achievement of Statehood for \r\nthe Palestinian people and bring lasting peace to the \r\nregion. Sri Lanka fully supports Palestine in its efforts \r\nto achieve full membership in the United Nations.\r\nSri Lanka unreservedly condemns the defamation \r\nof all religions and religious leaders. While the right \r\nto free speech is fundamental to our value system, that \r\nright should not be abused in order to hurt the feelings \r\nof the faithful, whether they be Buddhists, Muslims, \r\nChristians, Hindus, Jews or followers of other faiths. \r\nAll available mechanisms must be employed to prevent \r\nthe defamation of all religions and the exploitation of \r\nreligious symbols for commercial purposes.\r\nIn conclusion, Sri Lanka is currently in the \r\nprocess of making arrangements to host the World \r\nYouth Conference in 2014. The primary objective \r\nwill be the strengthening of youth inclusion in \r\nnational decision-making processes in relation to the \r\ndevelopment and implementation of the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda. I cordially extend an open \r\ninvitation to all fellow Member States to join hands \r\nwith us to make that global event a success.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Basile Ikouebe, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs and La Francophonie of the Republic \r\nof the Congo.\r\nMr. Ikouebe (Congo) (spoke in French): It is a \r\nhappy coincidence — and one that gives me great \r\npleasure — that my fellow countryman, who is presiding \r\nat this meeting, has given me the f loor. \r\nDespite progress in the field of knowledge and \r\nforecasting, the evolution of humankind remains \r\nsubject to uncertainties. In that connection, the work \r\nresults and peace on the ground, as we begin a new and \r\nexciting chapter in our country’s history.\r\nIn the international community’s quest to bring \r\nsome semblance of equity to economic development \r\nacross the continents, we must maintain increased focus \r\non the continent of Africa, especially through South-\r\nSouth cooperation. Sri Lanka is vigorously expanding \r\nits engagement with the region, especially in matters \r\nrelating to trade, investment, tourism and technical \r\nassistance.\r\nAll of our current endeavours should have a stronger \r\nfocus on children and youth, who are the custodians of \r\nour future. \r\nWe have continuously supported resolution 66/6 and \r\nthe need to end the unjust economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo against Cuba. Unilateral sanctions \r\nof that nature, which harm ordinary people, have no \r\nplace in modern international intercourse.\r\nTerrorism remains a scourge in the contemporary \r\nworld, threatens our societies and impedes the \r\nsocioeconomic progress of our people. As a country \r\nthat has emerged from ruthless and brutal terrorism, Sri \r\nLanka continues resolutely to support all multilateral \r\nefforts to enhance peace and security and eliminate \r\nall forms of terrorism, without discrimination. In our \r\ncollective quest to eradicate terrorism, the selective \r\napplication of principles and double standards must be \r\nscrupulously avoided. Terrorism from whatever source \r\nmust be unequivocally condemned and countered.\r\nIt has been established that terrorism has developed \r\nclose links with transnational organized crime in the \r\nform of cybercrime and identity theft, environment-\r\nrelated crime, maritime piracy, the smuggling of \r\nmigrants and trafficking in persons and drugs. \r\nMaritime piracy has emerged as a major threat to \r\ninternational sea lanes and has added an additional \r\neconomic burden to global trade. Sri Lanka, which has \r\nbeen a trading nation for centuries, eagerly supports \r\nmultinational efforts to counter that threat. But it must \r\nbe remembered that piracy originates on land and that \r\nany solution to piracy must also address its causes and \r\ndevelopments on land.\r\nThe illicit transportation of migrants to greener \r\npastures overseas by criminal networks requires \r\nour collective attention. Sri Lanka also continues to \r\ncooperate closely in that regard with our bilateral \r\nand multilateral partners. As a member of the Bali \r\n12-52557 27\r\nA/67/PV.19\r\nthe conflicts and crises that have marked the African \r\ncontinent for the whole of its post-independence history \r\nhave also enriched it with the experience of mediation \r\ninitiatives and have mobilized efforts aimed at settling \r\nthe conflicts by peaceful means.\r\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo is dealing \r\nwith a serious crisis in the eastern part of the country, \r\ncharacterized by repeated violence that has resulted \r\nin an intolerable humanitarian tragedy produced by \r\nsmall armed groups of the Mouvement du 23 mars \r\nand other opposition forces. That situation is a serious \r\nthreat to peace and security and to the integrity and \r\ndevelopment of our brother country. Furthermore, the \r\npolitical, security, socioeconomic and humanitarian \r\nconsequences can be felt throughout the Great Lakes \r\nregion. The heads of State and Government of the \r\nregion, meeting at the International Conference on the \r\nGreat Lakes region, are fully committed to seeking \r\npeaceful solutions.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity, as I did this \r\nmorning, to commend again the initiative of Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon to organize a high-level meeting \r\non 27 September on the situation in the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo, which will certainly provide a \r\nstimulus to the International Conference on the Great \r\nLakes Region, supported by the African Union. The \r\nCongo, which is committed to that effort as a neighbour, \r\na State member of the Conference and a member of \r\nthe Peace and Security Council of the African Union, \r\nconcurs with the conclusions of that important meeting, \r\nhoping to see them realized as soon as possible, so as \r\nto enable the Democratic Republic of the Congo to \r\nregain its stability and play the role expected of that \r\ngreat country. Our region will continue with its efforts \r\nto achieve the objectives we have sought and will use \r\nevery mechanism we have to attain them.\r\nIn December the Congo will host the thirty-fifth \r\nministerial meeting of the United Nations Standing \r\nAdvisory Committee on Security Questions in \r\nCentral Africa, which will allow us to celebrate the \r\ntwentieth anniversary of that General Assembly body \r\nand continue our cooperation on settling crises in the \r\nsubregion.\r\nThe collapse of democracy in Mali, which was once \r\na fine example of democracy in Africa, represents a \r\nrelapse that my country has condemned, while calling \r\nfor a return to constitutional order. The deteriorating \r\nhumanitarian situation, combined with the risk of \r\nof the United Nations, which is the appropriate forum \r\nfor seeking collective solutions to the many challenges \r\nthat make up our world, is markedly affected by those \r\nuncertainties.\r\nThe persistence and resurgence of hotbeds of \r\ntension of all kinds pose a serious threat to peace and \r\ninternational security, jeopardize the implementation \r\nof all projects for sustainable development and pose \r\na dangerous threat to the promotion and protection \r\nof human rights. In that context, it is appropriate that \r\nthe sixty-seventh session of the General Assembly has \r\nopened under the banner of the theme, “Bringing about \r\nadjustment or settlement of international disputes or \r\nsituations by peaceful means”. My delegation welcomes \r\nthat choice, which is also in line with the theme of the \r\nprevious session on mediation and reflects in a timely \r\nmanner the concerns of the day and aspirations of our \r\nStates.\r\nA year ago, speaking from this rostrum, I asserted \r\nthe importance and necessity of mediation as an \r\nessential tool for the prevention and settlement of \r\nconflicts, a tool that has proved itself, not only in Africa \r\nbut around the world. Having endured the horrors of \r\narmed conflict for years in the 1990s, the Congo chose \r\nthe path of mediation and dialogue. Thanks to that \r\ncommitment, my country has been able to overcome \r\nthe sociopolitical upheavals of its recent history, and \r\ntoday, the peace that reigns throughout the country has \r\ncleared the way for the impetus needed to strengthen \r\nour democratic process and economic development. \r\nTwo rounds of legislative elections were conducted \r\nin an atmosphere of calm on 15 July and 5 August, \r\nfollowed by the peaceful celebration on 15 August of \r\nthe fifty-second anniversary of our independence in \r\nKinkala, city seat of the Department of Pool, which had \r\nendured violence for a long time; those events serve as \r\nadditional examples of positive developments.\r\nStrengthened by that experience, the Congo would \r\nlike to voice its deep concern about the continuing \r\ncrises threatening peace and security, regionally and \r\ninternationally. For many years Africa has been the \r\ntheatre of choice for conflict. Today a number of African \r\ncountries — indeed, in some cases an entire region, \r\nlike the Sahel — are still at the mercy of instability \r\nand increasingly complex crises. Several meetings \r\ndedicated to conflicts in Africa are listed on the agendas \r\nof high-level meetings during the General Assembly’s \r\ncurrent session, which is unquestionably an indicator \r\nof instability in the world. However, we can agree that \r\n28 12-52557\r\nA/67/PV.19\r\npresents for the subregion and the world, we call for a \r\ncoordinated and negotiated settlement that takes into \r\nconsideration the interests of the various parties, so \r\nas to put an end to the escalating violence and serious \r\nviolations of human rights.\r\nRegarding the nuclear issue, which represents a \r\nserious threat to humankind in general, it is essential \r\nthat the nuclear-weapon States take responsibility, as \r\nthey should, to implement specific measures that will \r\nenable progress towards genuine nuclear disarmament, \r\nwhile monitoring the ban on nuclear proliferation \r\nwith regard to military purposes. We reaffirm the \r\nimportance of respecting the three pillars of the Treaty \r\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, that is, \r\nnuclear disarmament, non-proliferation and the right \r\nof every State to develop nuclear energy for peaceful \r\npurposes under the supervision of the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency.\r\nThe development agenda of the United Nations is \r\nstruggling to give sustainable support to our countries \r\nin their unceasing efforts to improve their economic \r\ndevelopment and their peoples’ well-being. The \r\ncommitments made by industrialized countries at the \r\nmajor international conferences under the auspices of \r\nthe United Nations have still not been met. The global \r\neconomic and financial crisis continues to weaken the \r\neconomies of developed as well as developing countries \r\naround the world. We are also concerned about the \r\nongoing crisis in the euro zone and its effects, which \r\nare having a considerable impact on the achievement \r\nof social development objectives at the international \r\nlevel, including the Millennium Development Goals. \r\nAreas such as the fight against poverty, employment, \r\neducation and health are affected by the crisis. In \r\nthat light, my delegation reaffirms the responsibility \r\nand central role of the United Nations in forging the \r\nspirit of solidarity and cooperation that can enable the \r\ncommitments made in the areas of aid and financing of \r\ndevelopment to be respected.\r\nClimate change remains a serious threat to the \r\nequilibrium of mankind. Sadly, we have to admit that \r\nwe have not done enough to reverse its negative effects \r\non the environment. It is therefore important to waste \r\nno more time and work to find solutions that will ensure \r\na better future for coming generations.\r\nAlong those lines, my delegation took an active part \r\nin June at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (Rio+20), a high-level exchange on the \r\nchallenge of sustainable development. The President \r\nspreading terrorism, calls for urgent implementation \r\nof the decisions of the Economic Community of West \r\nAfrican States, together with the support of the African \r\nUnion, the United Nations and the international \r\ncommunity, so as to ensure that that dangerous \r\nprecedent is not repeated anywhere else and that any \r\nimpulses towards destabilizing and partitioning States \r\nby terrorist groups are quashed.\r\nMy delegation can only welcome the positive \r\ndevelopments in the political process established by \r\nthe African Union in Somalia, which culminated in \r\nthe election on 10 September of the new President \r\nof the Republic, Mr. Hassan Sheikh Mohamud. \r\nMany challenges remain, of course, particularly \r\nthose of security, unification and reconciliation and \r\nestablishing the rule of law, to name only a few. In \r\nthat regard, we must support Somalia by helping that \r\ncountry to strengthen the gains of recent months, \r\nfocusing everything we do on working within a global \r\nstrategy for the reconstruction and development of the \r\nentire Somali territory and maintaining a coordinated, \r\norganized and coherent approach on the part of the \r\ninternational community, in support of the efforts of \r\nthe African Union Mission in Somalia.\r\nRegarding the dispute between the young Republic \r\nof South Sudan and the Republic of the Sudan, my \r\ndelegation urges both countries to demonstrate the \r\nnecessary political will and to spare no effort to \r\nsuccessfully and implement sign the Comprehensive \r\nPeace Agreement, as called for by the African Union \r\nin envisioning the existence of two viable States \r\nand a lasting peace. We support the African Union’s \r\nnegotiations in Ethiopia on that issue.\r\nOutside the African continent, particularly with \r\nrespect to the Middle East, the ongoing violence in \r\ncertain countries continues to erode the prospects for \r\npeace in the region, not to mention the blocked peace \r\nprocess between Israel and Palestine, now deadlocked \r\nfor several decades and, even worse, 10 years after the \r\nadoption of the Arab Peace Initiative. The Arab spring \r\nhas apparently not bloomed there, to the detriment of \r\nthe interests of a people who have the same right as any \r\nother to live in peace with its neighbours in a viable \r\nState. The Palestinian State has a rightful place in this \r\nbody.\r\nThe situation in Syria is particularly troubling, as \r\nspeakers before me have emphasized. Faced with the \r\nrisks of the general destabilization that that situation \r\n12-52557 29\r\nA/67/PV.19\r\npeaceful, prosperous and just world for the benefit of \r\nall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ngive the f loor to His Excellency Mr. Arvin Boolell, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, Regional Integration and \r\nInternational Trade of the Republic of Mauritius.\r\nMr. Boolell (Mauritius): The world is living \r\nthrough unprecedented times. The challenges of an \r\neconomic crisis now loom large. All nations, developed \r\nand developing, face growing uncertainties about their \r\neconomic prospects. Serious concerns about the global \r\neconomy arise now just after global prosperity had \r\nreached unprecedented heights. A second paradox is \r\nthat the countries most seriously affected by the crisis \r\nare those that contributed the least to its root causes.\r\nAs fallout from the crisis threatens to produce ever \r\nmore significant impacts, many already vulnerable \r\nsmall island States also face a major threat of a \r\ndifferent nature. The threat is an existential one. As \r\nwith the economic crisis, the countries that may be \r\nmost severely affected by climate change are those that \r\nhave contributed the least to the root causes of climate \r\nchange. Many small island developing States thus face \r\nthe dual threat of the impact of the worsening economies \r\non their trading and their development partners and that \r\nof climate change.\r\nAlready vulnerable nations face greater threats at \r\nthe international level, and more vulnerable groups face \r\ngreater difficulties within nations. Young people are \r\nfaced with higher levels of unemployment, and women \r\nand children are faced with reduced access to public \r\nservices, health and education. Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon, speaking at the latest Group of 20 meeting, \r\nput food and nutrition security at the top of the agenda. \r\nMeeting the energy needs for development is a major \r\nconcern. Recent meetings convened by the Economic \r\nand Social Council have again highlighted other major \r\nconcerns, including structural unemployment, rising \r\ninequality and the lag in poverty eradication. \r\nMany countries, both developing and developed, \r\nface a major challenge with respect to youth \r\nunemployment. Improving access to education and \r\ntackling the mismatch between qualifications and \r\nemployment are now a top policy goal. The world \r\ncannot let its young people down and must give them \r\nan opportunity to contribute to economic recovery and \r\nprosperity. What we do for young people and what they \r\nof the Congo, Denis Sassou Nguesso, brought Africa’s \r\nvoice to the Conference, in his role as spokesperson for \r\nthe continent. While we welcome the analysis and the \r\nreaffirmation of shared positions that the Conference \r\nyielded, my delegation remains concerned about the \r\nlack of real progress on the important issues of an \r\ninstitutional framework for sustainable development \r\nand for global environmental governance, as well as \r\nplans for their implementation. \r\nAlthough not all of Africa’s concerns were \r\naddressed, Africa’s common positions are nevertheless \r\nwell represented in the Rio+20 final document (resolution \r\n66/288, annex), thanks to the dogged perseverance and \r\nresolve of the African Group, which maintained unity \r\nand strove throughout the negotiation process to keep \r\nthe African point of view in the fore. I want to take \r\nthis opportunity here in New York to convey President \r\nSassou Nguesso’s words of appreciation to the African \r\nGroup and to extend his special thanks to the group of \r\nexperts led by Kenya and its Permanent Representative.\r\nThe sixty-seventh session of the Assembly is an \r\nimportant forum for a follow-up to Rio+20. I once \r\nagain urge African delegates to speak with one voice \r\nin defending African interests in the vital matter of \r\nsustainable development. Especially important is the \r\nintergovernmental process for developing proposals for \r\neffective sustainable development financing strategies \r\nto mobilize resources and put them to effective use.\r\nI could well have raised many other issues, such \r\nas Security Council reform and the need for genuine \r\nglobal governance that takes into account people’s \r\ndesire for multilateralism. But I will limit myself to a \r\nfew words about certain concerns that should be taken \r\ninto account. First is the need for global governance \r\nof political and security issues through the necessary \r\nreform of the Security Council. We also need to address \r\nglobal economic management by granting greater \r\nauthority to the Economic and Social Council. Finally, \r\nthere is the need for global environmental management \r\nthrough an international institution with real power \r\nto protect the environment and promote sustainable \r\ndevelopment. \r\nOur times demand the pursuit of those legitimate \r\ngoals, shared by the majority of Member States of our \r\nworld Organization. Its credibility and credit in the \r\nworld will increase if we meet the challenge of global \r\ngovernance with a unified drive to create a more \r\n30 12-52557\r\nA/67/PV.19\r\na crucial role in the debate on globally coordinated \r\nsolutions.\r\nWe reaffi rm our support for a revitalized Economic \r\nand Social Council, which should be able to exercise the \r\neffective role and function attributed to it by the Charter. \r\nIn that context, we also welcome the reaffirmation of \r\nthe mandate of the United Nations Conference on Trade \r\nand Development (UNCTAD) at Doha. UNCTAD \r\nmust continue to serve as the focal point of the United \r\nNations system for the integrated treatment of trade \r\nand development and the interrelated issues of finance, \r\ntechnology, investment and sustainable development. \r\nAs the world engages in the current debate on global \r\nsolutions, we must promote more economic exchanges \r\namong developing nations. Regional integration and \r\ncooperation are key to future development. Trade \r\nand investment must also be accompanied by greater \r\nregional cooperation through the pooling of resources \r\nand the provision of public goods. Pooling entails \r\nincreased economies of scale and makes it less costly \r\nto acquire technology.\r\nOne area where regional cooperation can make a \r\nsignificant contribution is the energy sector. Pooling \r\nresources and coordinating policies at the regional \r\nlevel and among groups of developing countries with \r\ncommon requirements can facilitate the development \r\nof technology and the implementation of renewable \r\nenergies.\r\nAs we celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of the \r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, \r\nlet us remind ourselves of the potential of the oceans \r\nas an engine for growth and promote international \r\ncooperation in a vast collective effort to tap that \r\npotential. There is potential there with respect not only \r\nto food and mineral resources but also to transport, \r\nleisure and the advancement of science.\r\nWe welcome the reaffirmation by world leaders \r\nin Rio de Janeiro that small island developing States \r\nremain a special case for sustainable development in \r\nview of their unique and particular vulnerabilities. We \r\nexpect that the commitment to take urgent and concrete \r\naction to address the vulnerabilities of small island \r\ndeveloping States will be followed by concrete actions. \r\nIt is imperative that small island developing States \r\nissues be more effectively mainstreamed throughout \r\nthe entire United Nations system and that a dedicated \r\nand clearly identified focal point be set up within \r\nevery United Nations entity dealing with small island \r\ncan do for the world they will inherit will shape the \r\neconomic future of our world.\r\nAs all nations work to promote sustainable \r\ndevelopment, essential components of governance \r\nrequired to achieve that goal include more equitable \r\nand inclusive growth, the fight against corruption, \r\ngreater accountability, more transparency and a general \r\nculture of integrity. Mauritius affirms that along with \r\ninitiatives to revisit development objectives, reform \r\nof the international financial architecture and global \r\neconomic governance must remain a top priority. \r\nMauritius strongly supports the view that the present \r\neconomic crisis is of a global nature and that solutions \r\nfor inclusive green growth also need to be global in \r\nnature.\r\nThe inconclusive talks of the Doha Round and those \r\non the United Nations Climate Change Convention \r\nboth suffered from a historical divide that regrettably \r\nresurfaces from time to time and is resurfacing now \r\nat a time when global solutions are more than ever \r\nnecessary. The debate over good economic and fiscal \r\ngovernance at the national level will always remain \r\nvalid and necessary but, however sound such domestic \r\npolicies may be, the global environment will have an \r\nimpact on growth and development, especially on that \r\nof developing countries and smaller economies.\r\nThirty-two years ago, the Independent Commission \r\non International Development Issues highlighted, in the \r\n1980 Brandt report, the interdependence of developing \r\nand developed economies and the mutuality of their \r\ninterests. The report explained how all nations would \r\nbenefit from a strengthened global economy. As the \r\nworld faces another crisis, all nations should recall \r\nhow much interdependence has grown since the Brandt \r\nreport and bear in mind the interconnection and \r\nmutuality of interests in the development agenda. \r\nIn that context, nations must resist protectionist \r\nmeasures as an easy way out. They would definitely \r\nbe detrimental in the medium and long term. \r\nThe Committee for Development Policy, in its \r\nJuly 2012 report (E/2012/33), called for a Transformative \r\nDevelopment Agenda. The international community \r\nmust pledge its support for a transformative agenda \r\nbased on the recognition that globally coordinated \r\nsolutions are necessary to accompany sound domestic \r\npolicies. It is imperative that the General Assembly, \r\nwith its pre-eminent and universal membership, play \r\n12-52557 31\r\nA/67/PV.19\r\nMauritius very much welcomed the High-\r\nlevel Meeting of the Assembly on the rule of law. \r\nDevelopment and greater economic prosperity go \r\nhand in hand with enhanced rule of law at both the \r\nnational and the international levels. There will be no \r\nmeaningful rule of law at the international level unless \r\nand until all nations, especially the small ones, have \r\navenues for resolving their disputes with other States. \r\nThe United Kingdom excised part of Mauritian \r\nterritory prior to independence, has refused to enter \r\ninto talks in good faith on that dispute and has ensured \r\nthat the dispute cannot be resolved by the International \r\nCourt of Justice. Thus, the decolonization of Africa \r\nhas not been completed. At a time when the United \r\nNations debates the rule of law at both the national \r\nand the international levels, we urge the international \r\ncommunity to work on machinery that would enable \r\nStates, whatever their size or economic power, to have \r\nat their disposal judicial and other peaceful means of \r\nresolving disputes. The rule of law at the international \r\nlevel cannot be normative only. There must also be \r\nadequate enforcement mechanisms, without which \r\nthere is no meaningful rule of law. The full realization \r\nof the territorial integrity of Mauritius also requires a \r\nsettlement that would enable us to effectively assert our \r\nsovereignty over Tromelin Island. We look forward to \r\ncontinued dialogue with France in a spirit of mutual \r\ncooperation.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nThe challenges that our countries currently face call \r\nfor exemplary solidarity on the part of the community \r\nof nations. Our common interests must guide all of our \r\nactions. We will not be able to pull through without \r\neach other. All Governments, civil society, researchers \r\nand entrepreneurs must therefore be aware of the \r\ninterdependence of our economies and work together \r\nfor the good of all nations. Countries often turn inwards \r\nin times of crisis and look out only for what they believe \r\nto be their own interests. However, true solutions are \r\ncollective. A global recovery would serve the interests \r\nof all States.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nBefore I end, let me convey to the Assembly the \r\ngreetings of the Prime Minister of the Republic of \r\nMauritius and its people. \r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ngive the f loor to His Excellency Mr. Enrique Castillo, \r\ndeveloping States issues. The Small Island Developing \r\nStates Unit within the Department of Economic and \r\nSocial Affairs should be strengthened to enable it to \r\nprovide coordinated support for small island developing \r\nStates.\r\nMauritius joins other world leaders who have \r\ncalled on all countries to deliver on their assistance \r\ncommitments. The international community cannot \r\nspend so much capital on negotiating new pledges and \r\nundertakings in a whole array of outcome documents \r\nand then ignore what has been agreed. We can move \r\nforward only if past commitments are honoured.\r\nWe welcome the proposed establishment of a \r\nsustainable development council to follow up on the \r\nUnited Nations Conference on Sustainable Development \r\nand formulate sustainable development goals. We also \r\nwelcome the appointment of a high-level panel on the \r\npost-2015 development agenda. Those entities and \r\nothers should be able to build on what has already been \r\nagreed through global negotiations.\r\nI must say that our hearts go out to the people of \r\nSyria, who are enduring the consequences of a severe \r\nhumanitarian crisis, as there is no prospect in sight of \r\na resolution to the political struggle. The international \r\ncommunity cannot remain indifferent to such suffering. \r\nThe world can also not remain indifferent to the \r\nsuffering of the Palestinian people, who are without a \r\nuniversally recognized State and face severe economic \r\nhardships and insecurity. Those challenges will test \r\nthe credibility and moral authority of the international \r\nsystem.\r\nI must also say that, while we have the utmost respect \r\nfor all faiths and religions, we strongly believe that \r\nthere is no justification for violence, however profound \r\nthe outrage in response to religious vilification. We \r\nalso support the fundamental principle of the protection \r\nof diplomats and diplomatic premises, which is at the \r\ncore of the interaction between nations, and we call on \r\nall members of the comity of nations to fully respect \r\nthat principle.\r\nWe also call on the international community to \r\nsupport the full implementation of the road map worked \r\nout in our neighbouring State of Madagascar and to \r\nprovide the transitional Government with the means \r\nto ensure a speedy return to constitutional rule and \r\ndemocracy in that great country.\r\n32 12-52557\r\nA/67/PV.19\r\nconflicts or to strip them of their violent consequences, \r\nwe must promote preventive diplomacy and mediation. \r\nWe enjoy the best results when these processes generate \r\nlegally binding agreements and decisions within the \r\nframework of the rule of law. A clear link therefore \r\nexists between the theme proposed by President \r\nJeremić for this session and the commitment by the \r\nUnited Nations and its Member States to the rule of law.\r\nCosta Rica believes in the power of mediation, and is \r\nthus part of a group of countries dedicated to promoting \r\nit within the United Nations. In July 2011, thanks to \r\nan initiative by the group that was enthusiastically \r\nsupported by many other States, the Assembly adopted \r\nby consensus its first resolution aimed at strengthening \r\nthe role of mediation (resolution 66/291). A few days \r\nago, the Assembly gave its support to a follow-up text.\r\nMoreover, Costa Rica is proud to have headed up \r\none of the most successful mediation processes in the \r\nhistory of our hemisphere. In the mid-1980s, various \r\narmed conflicts bloodied our brotherly countries in \r\nCentral America. There seemed to be no way out of the \r\nconflict. However, thanks to the tenacious leadership \r\nof former Costa Rican President Óscar Arias Sánchez, \r\non 7 August 1987, the region’s Heads of State signed \r\nthe Central American peace plan in Guatemala. That \r\nleadership earned our compatriot and President the \r\nNobel Peace Prize.\r\nThe success of the peace plan stemmed from \r\nthe double commitment of the signatories: to cease \r\nhostilities, and to address their root causes. Thanks \r\nto this comprehensive approach, the vision of the five \r\nPresidents of the Central American isthmus and effective \r\ninternational support, Central America silenced its \r\nguns and achieved peace. It was a peace founded on \r\ndemocracy and the commitment to development and \r\njustice.\r\nUnfortunately, the region today faces another \r\nchallenge of similar proportions. I refer to the onslaught \r\nof drug trafficking and international organized crime. \r\nWe are a transit route between the production centres of \r\nthe south and the large consumption centre of the north. \r\nThis situation has made us the victims of a problem \r\nover which we exercise minimal control. Our resources \r\nto deal with the problem are even more meagre. \r\nCentral Americans countries have agreed on regional \r\nstrategies to work jointly on prevention, interdiction \r\nand suppression, but our capacity for action is limited \r\nand has prevented any rapid implementation.\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Costa \r\nRica.\r\nMr. Castillo (Costa Rica) (spoke in Spanish): I will \r\nbegin my remarks by congratulating Mr. Vuk Jeremić, \r\nPresident of the General Assembly, on his election. \r\nMy country offers its support to him as he fulfils his \r\nimportant role. Success in his work will also represent \r\nsuccess for the United Nations and therefore for all the \r\npeoples of the world. We endorse his commitment to \r\nthe “adjustment or settlement of international disputes \r\nor situations by peaceful means”, and we support \r\nthe road map that he has outlined for the exercise of \r\nhis duties. We welcome the outstanding work of his \r\npredecessor, Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, and \r\nemphasize in particular his commitment to mediation. \r\nWe reiterate our support for the five imperatives of the \r\nagenda presented in January by Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon for his second term.\r\nBarely a year ago, we gathered in this Hall, \r\nencouraged by an echo of hope. It came from North \r\nAfrica and the Middle East and was broadcast by \r\na wide cross-section of voices gathered around one \r\nuniversal value — freedom. That hopeful clamour can \r\nstill be heard in the complex transitions to democracy, \r\npropelled by the will of the people. Tunisia, Egypt and \r\nLibya are the best examples. We convey our admiration \r\nand respect to those countries and their people.\r\nToday, however, the sounds most strongly \r\nresonating in this Hall are the desperate cries of \r\nwomen and children in Syria. To them, we convey our \r\nsolidarity. At the same time, we are distressed at the fury \r\nunleashed by those who would manipulate intolerance \r\nand extremism. We are worried by the resurgence of \r\nterritorial conflicts, the warmongering rhetoric of some \r\nStates and the indifference of autocratic regimes. We \r\nface the ongoing challenges of relentless terrorism, drug \r\ntrafficking and organized crime. Meanwhile, alarming \r\nsigns of environmental destruction are cropping up \r\nwith increasing urgency. These challenges have made \r\nus aware of the many threats we face, and they reiterate \r\nthe seminal importance of this Organization and of the \r\nmultilateral system as a whole. \r\nThe peaceful settlement of disputes is imperative \r\nfor peaceful coexistence among individuals, peoples \r\nand countries. For Costa Rica, it is also a part of daily \r\nlife and a central goal of our foreign policy. It is a value \r\nthat is deeply rooted in our respect for diversity and our \r\ncommitment to tolerance and the rule of law. To prevent \r\n12-52557 33\r\nA/67/PV.19\r\nconflicts or, at least, limiting their destructive effects. \r\nAt the end of July 2012, we failed to reach a consensus \r\non a universal, robust and binding arms trade treaty. \r\nIt was a sombre moment for peace and human dignity. \r\nCosta Rica, one of the co-authors of that initiative, will \r\nnot cease in its efforts to promote the kind of instrument \r\nthat the millions of victims of conventional weapons \r\nare demanding from the silence of their tombs.\r\nThe rule of law should also be the foundation of \r\nglobal governance. If this governance is to be robust in \r\nany area, it should be in the area of the environment. \r\nThe United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment brought about important progress in this \r\nrespect. However, the biggest tasks and commitments \r\nremain pending. While the global temperature \r\ncontinues to rise, droughts and f loods continue to \r\nexact a toll in lives, destroy infrastructure and displace \r\npopulations. The environmental threat is about to \r\nassume exponential dimensions. We cannot wait any \r\nlonger to act.\r\nCosta Rica adopted sustainability as a development \r\nmodel several years ago and has embraced its national \r\nresponsibilities on the matter. We have increased \r\nour forest coverage. We generate 90 per cent of our \r\nenergy from renewable sources. Over 25 per cent of \r\nour territory is made up of national parks, and we have \r\nadopted the goal of becoming a carbon-neutral country \r\nby 2021. But these and many other initiatives by small \r\ncountries will be useless without the commitment of \r\nthe biggest carbon emitters and without international \r\ncooperation for mitigation and adaption in the most \r\nvulnerable countries.\r\nThe formulation of the post-2015 sustainable \r\ndevelopment goals gives us an excellent opportunity \r\nto move forward. We expect their formulation to be a \r\nmultisectoral and participatory process that includes \r\nrule of law and good governance components.\r\nMiddle-income countries still need the support \r\nof the international community to consolidate our \r\nimprovements in economic and human development. \r\nLet us not forget that our achievements are due, in \r\npart, to the proper use of cooperation mechanisms. \r\nTo eliminate these because they have been well used \r\nwould be a disastrous mistake. That is why Costa \r\nRica, together with other middle-income countries, \r\nwill continue to participate actively in improving the \r\nmethodology guiding the graduation processes in the \r\ncontext of the United Nations Development Programme. \r\nAs we mentioned, we must consider, in the models for \r\nDespite all this, Costa Rica has rejected the \r\ndangerous notion of a “war” to confront these scourges. \r\nRather, we are working to expand opportunities for \r\nyoung people, promote preventative measures, improve \r\npolice capacity, strengthen the effectiveness of the \r\njudiciary and assist addicts. Fortunately, we are seeing \r\nresults in terms of civil security. For example, our \r\nmurder rate, which is the lowest in Central America, \r\nhas fallen from 11.7 per 100,000 people in May 2011, \r\nto 9 per 100,000 in May of this year. Reports of crime \r\nin general decreased by 12 per cent from 2010 to 2011. \r\nHowever, the cartels’ onslaught is so intense, the \r\nlogic of the drug market so disastrous, and the global \r\nstrategies to control it so disorganized and insufficient \r\nthat the outlook is grim.\r\nCosta Rica therefore believes a more active link \r\nmust be developed between the United Nations and \r\nthe design and implementation of balanced regional \r\nstrategies to deal with the drug trade. Moreover, drug \r\ntraffickers must be viewed as a real threat to peace and \r\ninternational security.\r\nCosta Rica is a small, democratic, unarmed \r\nand civilian country. The multilateral system and \r\ninternational law are our only means of defence. For this \r\nreason, we have recognized the compulsory jurisdiction \r\nof the International Court of Justice since 1973.\r\nAt the end of 2010, we appealed to the Court after the \r\nGovernment of Nicaragua illegally deployed military \r\nforces and civilian personnel in part of our national \r\nterritory. In March of the following year, the Court \r\npronounced a series of provisional measures. Among \r\nthem, the Court ordered Nicaragua to remove its forces \r\nfrom the disputed area and granted environmental \r\ncustody to Costa Rica. However, the Government \r\nof Nicaragua has consistently f louted the order and \r\ncontinued to send personnel to that area. It has done so \r\nin open defiance of the Court, to the detriment of our \r\nbilateral relations, and in violation of paragraph 31 of \r\nthe Declaration on the Rule of Law at the National and \r\nInternational Levels that was adopted a week ago by the \r\nAssembly (resolution 67/1). We do not want this case to \r\nmar relations or, even worse, the profound human ties \r\nbetween our countries. But Nicaragua has still failed to \r\nfulfil the provisional measures of the Court. We regret \r\nthis, we condemn this and we denounce this once again \r\nin this Hall.\r\nDespite its clear adherence to the rule of law and \r\ncommitment to mediation, the international community \r\nhas been unable to adopt a key instrument for avoiding \r\n34 12-52557\r\nA/67/PV.19\r\nMr. Ohin (Togo) (spoke in French): At the outset, \r\nI would like to address my warmest congratulations \r\nto Mr. Vuk Jeremić on the confidence that the entire \r\nUnited Nations family has invested in him by electing \r\nhim to the high office of President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-seventh session. \r\nI would also like to take this opportunity to reiterate \r\nTogo’s support to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for \r\nall of the work that he continues to undertake in order to \r\npromote peace in the world. We appreciate the immense \r\nefforts that he is pursuing in Africa and many other \r\nregions of the world in order to find a peaceful outcome \r\nto the conflicts that they face by prioritizing dialogue, \r\nmediation and cooperation. \r\nThe choice of the peaceful settlement of disputes as \r\nthe central theme of this session is a wise choice, and I \r\nwelcome it. Indeed, it allows us, in the complex world \r\nwe live in today, to reconnect with the original purpose \r\nand founding values of the United Nations. Over the \r\ndecades, our Organization has taken it upon itself to \r\nrespond to the many challenges posed by a world that \r\nis constantly changing. It remains present and active in \r\nall the areas that present opportunities for progress by \r\nhumankind. \r\nHowever, in spite of our efforts and the progress \r\nthat has been achieved, here and there, in the areas \r\nof technology, economy and social issues, we note, \r\nunfortunately, that force continues to be used all \r\ntoo frequently in international relations. On many \r\noccasions, recourse to the use of armed force has been \r\nchosen before all avenues for the peaceful means of \r\ndispute resolution have been exhausted. \r\nThe African continent, unfortunately, has paid and \r\ncontinues to pay a heavy price when it seeks to save \r\ntime by prematurely cutting short the process for the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes. Yet, experience has \r\nshown that even in the rare cases where recourse to the \r\nuse of weapons has allowed one of the parties to the \r\nconflict to quickly prevail over the other, lasting peace \r\nand stability have not been achieved. \r\nThat is why my country, Togo, welcomes the fact \r\nthat the sixty-seventh session of the General Assembly \r\ngives all of us the opportunity to revisit the original \r\nvalues of the United Nations Charter in order to better \r\nguide our work in dealing with the challenges of our \r\ncontemporary world. Indeed, perhaps it is time to put \r\ndialogue among nations at the centre of the international \r\nagenda again. But today we need to go further, and also \r\nthese processes, not only income, but also other criteria \r\nthat better reflect the extent of our challenges and \r\nthat foster cooperation strategies that provide greater \r\nsupport to our development efforts.\r\nThe main leadership role in global governance \r\nshould be played by the United Nations, on the basis \r\nof international law. Only legitimate multilateral \r\naction can promote and protect the most important \r\nglobal public goods. We cannot discount the external \r\nchallenges to the leadership of this Organization. But it \r\nis more important that we recognize the internal need to \r\ncommit ourselves to making it more vigorous, effective, \r\nefficient, inclusive and representative. Member States \r\nshould understand that the best way to promote our \r\nnational interests through the United Nations is to \r\nreform it in order to improve its performance.\r\nCosta Rica aligns itself with the concept of a global \r\nSecretariat that was formulated by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, and is ready to give its constructive support to \r\ntranslating this idea into reality. We are also committed \r\nto the comprehensive reform of the Security Council \r\nand believe that improving its working methods should \r\nbe an ongoing process.\r\nWe emphasize the value of the responsibility \r\nto protect as a critical operative principle of the \r\ninternational community. \r\nThe fight against impunity is part of the fight for \r\nhuman dignity. This is why we ardently support the \r\nInternational Criminal Court, one of the most relevant \r\nachievements of the multilateral system since the \r\ncreation of the United Nations.\r\nThe upheavals in the world today demand our \r\nattention and fill us with dismay, but hope also \r\nf lourishes alongside them. What better example is \r\nthere, in this regard, than the spirit recently embodied \r\nby the Olympic and Paralympic athletes in London, who \r\ncompeted with clear rules, fair play, mutual respect and \r\na feeling of achievement? If the conflicts of our world \r\nmimicked that experience, the course of humanity \r\nwould be different. Maybe such a fundamental change \r\nis not possible, but we should at least continue to work \r\nfor a world that is more just, peaceful, free, sustainable, \r\nand respectful of human dignity and the rule of law. \r\nCosta Rica reiterates its profound commitment to this \r\ntask.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now give \r\nthe f loor to His Excellency Mr. Elliot Ohin, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Togolese Republic.\r\n12-52557 35\r\nA/67/PV.19\r\nin the area of promoting peace and security in the \r\nworld. As Members of the United Nations, we do not \r\nhave that choice, because the community of values \r\nthat unites us is a permanent call to promote solidarity \r\nand even complementarity between the specific \r\ngoals of subregional organizations and the search for \r\nuniversality that is the very foundation of the United \r\nNations. \r\nOn that point, it should be noted that the protocol \r\nestablishing a Peace and Security Council in the \r\nAfrican Union in 2002 created a great deal of hope \r\nat the time. Modelled on the Security Council of the \r\nUnited Nations, that new institutional tool was intended \r\nto enable the African Union to intervene directly in \r\ncountries in crisis. Sadly, recent experiences, whether \r\nin Libya or Côte d’Ivoire, have shown that, faced with \r\nthe antagonisms that characterize the international \r\ncommunity, that tool has not been able to fulfil our \r\nexpectations. Those modest beginnings confirm the \r\nurgent need for close cooperation between regional \r\npeacekeeping mechanisms and the system established \r\ndecades ago by the United Nations to ensure collective \r\ninternational security.\r\nFrom that point of view, I would like to join my \r\nvoice to those of previous speakers to invite the entire \r\ninternational community to assist all the institutional \r\nplayers who are proceeding with good will to help Mali \r\nin its determination to recover its territorial integrity as \r\nquickly as possible and to help that country re-establish \r\npeace so that the transition period can be successful. \r\nThat obligation of solidarity is a call to all of us. \r\nRecent events in the north of the African continent have \r\nonce again exposed the sad reality that the reduction of \r\ntension and the prevention and settlement of internal \r\ndisputes all too often involve elements that extend well \r\nbeyond individual States. \r\nDrawing on its experience of the past two decades, \r\nwhich were marked by major political shocks, and \r\nhonoured to sit as a non-permanent member of the \r\nSecurity Council, Togo resolutely joins the dynamic of \r\nthe continuing search for peace focusing on dialogue \r\nand cooperation. In that regard, on behalf of my \r\ncompatriots, and from this high rostrum, I would \r\nlike to salute the United Nations, other international \r\norganizations and all friendly nations and partners of \r\ngoodwill who recently helped the Togolese people set \r\nout on the path of dialogue to overcome the weight of \r\nthe past. That wise choice enabled us to embark on the \r\nmake dialogue within nations an important component \r\nof our efforts to achieve peace. Dialogue within nations \r\nis in fact an indispensable corollary of dialogue among \r\nnations. It should be encouraged and cultivated in the \r\nsame vein, because it is the prelude to preserving peace \r\namong nations. \r\nIndeed, since the contemporary world is marked by \r\ninterdependence, when misunderstandings degenerate \r\ninto internal conflicts because there is no dialogue, it is \r\nrare that they do not have repercussions in neighbouring \r\ncountries. The Syrian crisis and the climate of growing \r\ninsecurity in the Sahel-Sahara region are textbook \r\nexamples. \r\nThat is why I would like to urge our common \r\nOrganization and its Member States to persevere in \r\nthe efforts already under way to make dialogue within \r\nnations a cornerstone of their conflict-prevention work \r\nin the world. Before all else, encouraging dialogue \r\nwithin nations comes down to adopting a constructive \r\napproach that strives to promote universal values \r\nwhile taking into account the realities specific to each \r\ncountry, as well as local and regional specificities. It \r\nis also a matter of making citizens, whatever country \r\nthey live in, responsible through various means for the \r\nculture of peace, for listening to one another and for a \r\nsense of compromise in order to make dialogue a cross-\r\ncutting value in our modern societies.\r\nWith that in mind, the West African Economic \r\nand Monetary Union — over which Togo is honoured \r\nto preside and which now enjoys observer status in the \r\nGeneral Assembly — decided at its May 2012 meeting \r\nin Lomé to give higher priority to matters of peace \r\nand security than to purely economic issues. That \r\nnovel move by a regional economic organization is \r\nfundamentally guided by the desire to make dialogue a \r\npriority tool for conflict prevention.\r\nIn that regard, I remain profoundly convinced that \r\ndecentralization of conflict prevention and resolution \r\nthat makes use of the contribution of subregional \r\norganizations is one of the most viable options for \r\npeacekeeping in the world. The proximity of such \r\nbodies to the geographic areas of conflict and to their \r\nhistorical and cultural roots is a major asset that should \r\nbe maximized in conflict prevention and the settlement \r\nof disputes.\r\nStill, the increased responsibility of subregional \r\norganizations should not be a pretext to justify a kind of \r\ndisguised renunciation of our collective responsibility \r\n36 12-52557\r\nA/67/PV.19\r\nin material destruction, that it is urgent to do everything \r\nto prevent its reappearance in Togo or elsewhere. That \r\nis both an individual and a collective responsibility. We \r\nshould leave no stone unturned in the struggle that has \r\nbeen launched at all levels to prevent the elections from \r\nbeing synonymous with violence and chaos. \r\nCivil society has an important role to play in that \r\ncrucial area. States must help civil society to better \r\norganize itself in order to play its full role and to become \r\na type of citizens’ watch that can truly contribute to the \r\nevolution of human societies. However, in return, those \r\norganizations must demonstrate their probity and lack \r\nof bias. They must also refrain from aligning themselves \r\nwith belligerent factions or fighting for the cause of the \r\nprotagonists in political battles. Civil society must not \r\nbe a Trojan horse for political groups.\r\nMr. Charles (Trinidad and Tobago), Vice-President, \r\ntook the Chair.\r\nBecause of their proximity to citizens, the \r\norganizations of civil society must free themselves \r\nfrom political cliques so as to contribute to the rapid \r\ndevelopment of human societies in key areas of \r\neconomic and social life. In that regard, I welcome \r\nthe decision taken several years ago to encourage \r\ncitizen action by accrediting to the Economic and \r\nSocial Council those organizations that have been \r\nrecognized for their usefulness. That is a judicious \r\nway to encourage, within those citizen organizations, \r\na heightened awareness of their responsibilities when \r\nfacing today’s major challenges, economic crises, \r\nenvironment crises and the aspirations to democracy \r\nand freedoms that, although they assume new forms, \r\nshould not obstruct the momentum of our societies.\r\nThe peoples’ fight for more open and democratic \r\nsocieties should not dissipate at the borders of nation \r\nStates. That fight must extend to the international level, \r\nin which the rules of the game must also continue to \r\nevolve in order to take into account the major changes \r\nthat have taken place since the creation of the United \r\nNations. And yet, since 1945, the basic rules that govern \r\nthe functioning of the Security Council have literally \r\nbeen frozen in an immobility that is increasingly \r\nappalling. It is obvious that maintenance of the status \r\nquo in a context of profound change cannot fail to \r\ngenerate serious dysfunctions. The Council’s incapacity \r\nto agree on certain major cases of great importance \r\nis a perfect illustration, and again sharply raises the \r\nquestion of reform of that body, which is at the heart of \r\nconstruction of a new country, one reconciled with \r\nitself and facing out onto the world.\r\nOur feeling of gratitude is all the more profound \r\nbecause we have been able to see in just a few years \r\nthe economic and social progress that the Togolese \r\npeople can achieve on their own, now that they are \r\nliving in peace and harmony among themselves, with \r\ntheir neighbours and with the rest of the world. We have \r\nrenewed our economic growth and are intensifying \r\nour efforts to ensure better political and economic \r\ngovernance through sweeping institutional and \r\nconstitutional reforms. We intend to implement them \r\nout of respect for the republican agenda.\r\nFrom one year to the next, public freedoms have \r\ntaken root in Togo. Political pluralism, which is deeply \r\ningrained in Togolese customs, has a natural ally in the \r\nacknowledged right of all citizens to demonstrate in \r\ncomplete freedom, so long as they respect prevailing \r\nrules.\r\nThe challenge in Togo today is to consolidate \r\neconomic recovery, to promote a firm foundation for \r\ndemocracy and the rule of law, and to promote the \r\nindivisibility of human rights in order to propel the \r\ncountry towards new gains, particularly in the social \r\narena, where expectations are both numerous and \r\nurgent. Of course, the progress made in recent years \r\nin the economic, political and social realms is still \r\nfragile. That is why the Government remains alert \r\nto the different views expressed on the best ways to \r\nconsolidate that progress. We have opted to make the \r\nsearch for consensus a central axis for managing the \r\naffairs of State.\r\nIn that same spirit, the Togolese Government is \r\nworking to build on the excitement that has gripped \r\nthe country’s political class on the eve of legislative \r\nelections. Now that dialogue has been reopened, I \r\nhave good reason to hope that it will lead to broader \r\nmembership in that class so that its conclusions will \r\nbe accepted by all. Our immediate priority is to hold \r\nsuccessful, free, peaceful and transparent legislative \r\nelections. Indeed, we aim to raise Togo to the ranks \r\nof those countries that have managed to eradicate the \r\nsyndrome of violence before, during and after elections. \r\nNonetheless, we must recognize that such violence has \r\nunfortunately turned elections into a cause of mortality \r\nin various regions of the world. \r\nThat scourge has caused so much damage on the \r\nAfrican continent, in both the loss of human lives and \r\n12-52557 37\r\nA/67/PV.19\r\n“A growing number of States are determined to \r\nenhance their external engagement, aspiring to \r\nplay greater roles in their respective regions and \r\nbeyond. As a result, power and influence in the \r\ninternational arena are becoming more diffuse”. \r\n(A/67/PV.6, p. 4)\r\nWhen Trinidad and Tobago mounted this rostrum \r\nfor the first time 50 years ago, our Permanent \r\nRepresentative Sir Ellis Clarke, an illustrious legal \r\nscholar, remarked: \r\n“We recognize the responsibility which we have \r\nassumed with membership in this Organization. \r\nThat responsibility we can neither shirk nor \r\ndelegate.” (A/PV.1122, para. 126) \r\nToday, I stand in reconfirmation of that responsibility. \r\nIn these decades of engagement, we are always \r\nanchored by the three main pillars on which the United \r\nNations was founded: peace and security, human rights \r\nand development.\r\nAt the core of our commitment has been the rule of \r\nlaw both within and beyond our borders, which is the \r\nbasis of the theme set for this year’s debate: “Bringing \r\nabout adjustment or settlement of international disputes \r\nor situations by peaceful means”, which reaffirms a \r\ncore principle enshrined in the Charter of the United \r\nNations.\r\nToo often we have witnessed the severity of the \r\nconsequences when States act unilaterally to solve \r\ndisputes through the illegal use of force. Trinidad \r\nand Tobago calls on all nation States to ratify the \r\namendments to the Rome Statute of the International \r\nCriminal Court on the crime of aggression. We expect \r\nto ratify those amendments by the next Assembly of \r\nStates Parties. The entry into force of those amendments \r\nwill fill a crucial gap by making it possible to bring to \r\njustice those criminally responsible for the commission \r\nof the crime of aggression.\r\nIn the light of recent troubling developments, \r\nTrinidad and Tobago is compelled to reaffirm the \r\nprovisions of the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic \r\nRelations. The Convention requires States to protect the \r\npremises of diplomatic missions and ensure the safety \r\nof diplomatic personnel. Those sacred principles must \r\nbe upheld even in times of armed conflict and armed \r\nviolence.\r\nThe United Nations is the principal vehicle for \r\nfacilitating the settlement of disputes or situations \r\nthe entire United Nations system. That process, which \r\nhas countless times been broached and put off for later, \r\ntoday deserves full and immediate attention.\r\nThus, Togo would like to solemnly reaffirm its \r\nsteadfast support for the African Union initiative \r\nthat seeks to grant the African continent, following \r\nthe modalities that have not yet been defined, more \r\nadequate representation within the United Nations \r\nSecurity Council. I firmly believe that it is up to the \r\nnations that have always had the privilege of having \r\na permanent seat on the Council to take a small step \r\nthat would allow all of humankind to make a giant leap \r\nforward. That gesture seems essential to me because \r\nit is a sine qua non for generating a new dynamic that \r\nwould allow us to collectively deliver more coordinated, \r\nbolder and determined responses and to thus forge a \r\nglobal governance that is more mature and more free, \r\nwith greater analytical capacity.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Winston Dookeran, Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nthe Republic of Trinidad and Tobago.\r\nMr. Dookeran (Trinidad and Tobago): Her \r\nExcellency Mrs. Kamla Persad-Bissessar, MP, Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, on \r\nwhose behalf I speak, extends her congratulations to \r\nMr. Vuk Jeremić on his election as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. The \r\nhonourable Prime Minister has also asked me to convey \r\nto the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, Trinidad \r\nand Tobago’s appreciation for his untiring efforts in \r\nworking towards peace and security in today’s world.\r\nI am privileged to address this Hall at a time \r\nwhen the world is faced with turmoil and uncertainty. \r\nToday, the world is radically different from what it was \r\na year ago. The redistribution of wealth and the very \r\nnature of global power are shifting. New dynamics \r\nare emerging as we witness the growing economies in \r\nLatin America, Asia and Africa. The global pattern of \r\ndistribution of resources is being transformed by new \r\ndiscoveries and by changes in technological processes \r\nand in information. The world map of financial f lows \r\nhas changed, forcing us to look with more scrutiny on \r\nthe economic forces surrounding us and the threat they \r\npose to financial sustainability.\r\nIt is in this context that Trinidad and Tobago \r\nendorses the President’s statement at the opening of the \r\nAssembly’s sixty-seventh session on 25 September: \r\n38 12-52557\r\nA/67/PV.19\r\ndevelopment sectors of interest to the Caribbean, as part \r\nof the Caribbean convergence initiative. In the view of \r\nTrinidad and Tobago, the imperative of the initiative \r\ncompels us to regard the economic blockade of Cuba \r\nas an anachronism. We therefore call yet again for its \r\nremoval.\r\nWe are only three years away from the deadline \r\nset by world leaders for the achievement of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). While \r\nTrinidad and Tobago would have preferred a more \r\nequitable geographical distribution on the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s panel on the acceleration of efforts to achieve \r\ntargets set by the MDGs, we nevertheless welcome its \r\nestablishment. We also call for fresh and bold changes \r\nand a paradigm shift in thinking in the design of the \r\npost-2015 development agenda.\r\nWe must safeguard the environment for future \r\ngenerations and in that regard move decisively to fully \r\nimplement our obligations under the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change and its \r\nKyoto Protocol. That would guarantee the survival of \r\nthose of us who are most vulnerable to climate change, \r\nclimate variability and sea-level rise. Every moment of \r\ndelay takes us closer to our own demise. \r\nThe health and well-being of our people is central to \r\nour development. The prevalence of non-communicable \r\ndiseases, in particular, poses a serious threat to \r\nCaribbean development. Trinidad and Tobago laments \r\nthe lack of action on the Political Declaration on the \r\nPrevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases \r\nadopted one year ago (resolution 66/2, annex). We \r\ncannot risk further inaction on the matter. The adverse \r\nconsequences are significant. We therefore urge that \r\nthe matter be given high priority on the international \r\ndevelopment agenda.\r\nThe stability of many regions is being undermined \r\nby the illicit trade in conventional weapons, which has \r\nfuelled armed conflict and armed violence. Trinidad and \r\nTobago is encouraged by the support of many countries \r\nfor the conclusion of a robust and legally binding arms \r\ntrade treaty. However, we deeply regret the failure of the \r\nUnited Nations Conference on the Arms Trade Treaty, \r\ndespite the support of an overwhelming majority. \r\nThat reflects the refusal of a few States to agree to an \r\ninstrument that would prevent the diversion of arms \r\nto the illegal market. Illegal weapons, including small \r\narms and light weapons, in the hands of terrorists, \r\ndrug dealers, gang leaders and other actors involved \r\nin transnational organized crimes, are an affront to \r\namong States by peaceful means. The architecture is in \r\nplace to achieve that objective. However, it needs to be \r\nstrengthened. To achieve that noble goal, the political \r\ncommitment of Member States, whether large or small, \r\ndeveloped or developing, is absolutely necessary.\r\nMember States must move swiftly to restructure the \r\nSecurity Council. For Trinidad and Tobago, the status \r\nquo is unacceptable. The Council must be reformed \r\nto reflect the geopolitical realities of the twenty-first \r\ncentury. The legitimacy of that body can be reaffirmed \r\nonly if the new dynamics of global power are reflected \r\nin its composition and operation.\r\nIt is a matter of grave concern to Trinidad and \r\nTobago that the Security Council has not been able to \r\neffectively address the situation in Syria. We appeal to \r\nthe Council to fully support the work of Mr. Lakhdar \r\nBrahimi, the Joint Special Representative for Syria \r\nof the United Nations and the League of Arab States. \r\nThe Council must uphold its sacred Charter mandate \r\nand ensure that all sides involved in that conflict are \r\nmade to account for their actions, which have caused \r\ntremendous human suffering and continue to threaten \r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nAt the same time, we also call for more principled \r\nleadership by the permanent members of the Council \r\nto bring an end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. \r\nDespite the adoption of numerous resolutions by \r\nthe General Assembly and the Council, and several \r\npeace initiatives, including that of the League of Arab \r\nStates, we continue to witness, almost on a daily basis, \r\nwanton violence and tremendous loss of life, resulting \r\nin further escalation of tensions. A resolution of the \r\nconflict remains elusive, and the conflict is a catalyst \r\nfor regional insecurity and instability. That makes even \r\nmore urgent the need to find a formula for enduring \r\npeace. The United Nations must commit all available \r\nresources to mediating a two-State agreement in order \r\nto begin to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian situation, in \r\nfull accordance with resolutions reaffirming borders \r\nexisting before 1967.\r\nI will now address other issues relating to the global \r\ndevelopment agenda. \r\nThe completion of Cuba’s reintegration as a full \r\nand equal partner in the international system is an \r\nissue close to the Caribbean. Over the years, that \r\npolicy objective has been given practical content \r\nthrough the establishment of a wide-ranging dialogue \r\nand in specific cooperation agreements in a variety of \r\n12-52557 39\r\nA/67/PV.19\r\non the major international lending agencies to recognize \r\nthe special circumstances of middle-income countries \r\nand not push them to the margins of the development \r\nagenda.\r\nWe must advance the global economic governance \r\nagenda. To this end, middle-income and small nations \r\nmust not be excluded from development cooperation \r\nand financing on the basis of per capita income alone.\r\nAs we look forward to the next 50 years of \r\nmembership of the United Nations, Trinidad and \r\nTobago has a renewed optimism. In spite of the hurdles \r\nof the past, we are witnessing a new vitality in the \r\nUnited Nations today, and we reiterate our advocacy for \r\na new dialogue and a new diplomacy. The international \r\ncommunity is once again embracing multilateralism \r\nwith higher expectations. The ongoing development of \r\nnew rules and new norms in human rights; trade and \r\ndevelopment; protection of the environment; and peace \r\nand security gives hope that the human tragedies which \r\nbedevilled the twentieth century can be avoided. A \r\nnew leadership with a global mindset must engage the \r\nvarious communities of interests to find more durable \r\nsolutions in a volatile global environment. This new \r\ninternational leadership must find the right mix of \r\npower, politics and economics to achieve the necessary \r\nperformance level for sustainable regional and global \r\neconomic growth, and ultimately development, that \r\nwill benefit the citizens of all nations.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago will engage regional, \r\nhemispheric and global partners to assist the United \r\nNations in making the world a safer and better place \r\nfor all humankind. But let me conclude by reminding \r\nus all that we do not have the luxury of time. The eyes \r\nof the world are upon us. Our actions today must allow \r\ntomorrow’s generations to experience a better and more \r\nsecure future.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ismael Abraão Gaspar Martins, \r\nChairman of the delegation of Angola.\r\nMr. Gaspar Martins (Angola) (spoke in Portuguese; \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): On behalf \r\nof the Government of the Republic of Angola, I avail \r\nmyself of this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Vuk \r\nJeremić on his election to preside over the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-seventh session and to assure him \r\nof the support of my country in the fulfilment of his \r\nmission. It is our belief that under his leadership this \r\nsession will confirm the importance and role of the \r\nthe efforts undertaken to resolve disputes by peaceful \r\nmeans. In the Caribbean, and I daresay elsewhere, the \r\nhigh incidence of gun-related crimes is intolerable. \r\nWe join with our Caribbean Community partners and \r\nothers in the call for the resumption of negotiations on \r\nthe arms trade treaty by the first quarter of 2013.\r\nWe also recognize the important role of women \r\nas agents of change — not as mere victims — in all \r\ninitiatives related to the resolution of disputes and \r\nconflicts. Trinidad and Tobago was privileged to host \r\na high-level discussion with representatives of other \r\nMember States, the United Nations Office for \r\nDisarmament Affairs and the non-governmental \r\norganization community at the margins of the General \r\nAssembly last week on the topic of women, disarmament, \r\nnon-proliferation and arms control. The high point of \r\nthe discussion was the signing of a joint statement by \r\nGovernment representatives to promote the equitable \r\nrepresentation of women in all decision-making on \r\nthe matter. Trinidad and Tobago requests all Member \r\nStates to support this draft resolution when it comes \r\nbefore the General Assembly later in the session.\r\nThe majority of States settle disputes by peaceful \r\nmeans. We take this opportunity to applaud the special \r\nagreement signed by the Governments of Belize and \r\nGuatemala to submit their long-standing border dispute \r\nto the International Court of Justice for adjudication.\r\nWe in Trinidad and Tobago have delimited our \r\nmaritime boundaries through bilateral negotiations and \r\narbitration, in keeping with the provisions of the 1982 \r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. This \r\nconduct has not only promoted good-neighbourliness \r\namong States in the region, but also provided an \r\nenvironment conducive to the exploration and \r\nexploitation of living and non-living marine resources \r\nso vital to the social and economic development of our \r\npeople.\r\nIn this increasingly multipolar world, where \r\ninterconnectivity is crucial, small States are faced with \r\nmounting challenges to find a space and a place in the \r\nnew world order. Trinidad and Tobago has promoted in \r\nevery forum the need for constructive dialogue between \r\nsmall States, the Group of 20, Brazil, Russia, India, \r\nChina and South Africa, and the international financial \r\ninstitutions.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago recognizes this call for a \r\nnew diplomacy, and we therefore join with Mrs. Portia \r\nSimpson-Miller, Prime Minister of Jamaica, in calling \r\n40 12-52557\r\nA/67/PV.19\r\norder to serve the interests of all countries in a global \r\nperspective. In this regard, my Government reiterates \r\nits support for initiatives aimed at liberalizing \r\ninternational trade in line with the Doha Round. The \r\nreform of the international economic and financial \r\nsystem’s regulatory institutions is of crucial importance \r\nto ensure greater f lexibility and transparency in \r\nallocating capital to the least developed countries — a \r\ncategory that includes the majority of African nations.\r\nIt is also essential to take appropriate measures \r\ntowards strengthened support for international action \r\non sustainable development and increased financial \r\ncontributions to the United Nations to enable our \r\nOrganization to fulfil its mandate efficiently. It must \r\ndo so by renewing its commitments to the sustainable \r\ndevelopment issues contained in Agenda 21, adopted \r\nat the United Nations Conference on Environment and \r\nDevelopment in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. The United \r\nNations Conference on Sustainable Development \r\nprovided a solid framework for creating national and \r\ninternational policies to ensure the social, economic \r\nand environmental welfare of our peoples. \r\nWe note that despite the progress made, there is \r\na continued need for the international community to \r\ntranslate commitments into action in order to achieve \r\nsustainable development. Africa in general, and my \r\ncountry in particular, believe that intensive efforts on \r\nthe part of the international community are needed to \r\ntackle the phenomena that threaten to reverse progress \r\nmade with respect to development. Drought and \r\ndesertification, climate change, natural disasters, loss \r\nof biodiversity and rapid urbanization are just some of \r\nthe factors that adversely affect development efforts \r\nworldwide.\r\nThe Security Council plays a key role in preventing \r\nand resolving conflicts, and in peacekeeping efforts, in \r\naccordance with the powers conferred upon it by the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. The central theme at \r\nthe heart of our debate calls for reform of the Security \r\nCouncil, as well as ensuring the fair representation \r\nof all regions and the broadening of its permanent \r\nmembership in order to adapt it to contemporary reality.\r\nAllow me to refer to a set of conflicts that are of \r\ncritical concern to my country. In the Great Lakes \r\nregion, the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo continues to worry the international community.\r\nMy country reaffirms its support for the decisions of \r\nthe third extraordinary summit of the International \r\nConference on the Great Lakes Region, held in \r\nGeneral Assembly in finding solutions to the burning \r\nissues affecting humankind, thereby helping to make \r\nthe world safer and fairer. I would also like to express \r\nour gratitude to Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser for \r\nthe exemplary and wise manner in which he conducted \r\nthe work of the Assembly at its previous session. I \r\nfurther salute Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for \r\nthe dynamism he has invested in the work of our \r\nOrganization. In this connection, I would like to thank \r\nhim for his visit to my country in February of this \r\nyear, during the celebration of the tenth anniversary \r\nof the advent of peace in Angola. During that visit, \r\nhe had the opportunity to familiarize himself with the \r\nprogress made in the reconstruction of the country and \r\nconsolidation of democratic institutions. \r\nThis session of the General Assembly is taking place \r\nat a time of profound international political, economic \r\nand social transformations, which reaffirm the relevance \r\nof the central theme of our discussion: maintaining \r\ninternational peace and security, eradicating poverty, \r\npromoting development, protecting the environment \r\nand ensuring a better future for generations to come, \r\nguaranteeing the rule of law in international relations, \r\nand promoting and ensuring the protection of human \r\nrights. These are indeed the main challenges facing us \r\ntoday.\r\nIn addition to these, there are further challenges \r\nrequiring priority attention from our Organization, \r\nincluding disarmament, the fight against organized \r\ncrime, the implementation of the Global Counter-\r\nTerrorism Strategy, and the persistence of armed \r\nconflicts and their impact on people’s lives. Having \r\nhad the painful experience of war, which still has \r\nmajor consequences for the lives of our people, Angola \r\nreiterates that dialogue and negotiation are the way to \r\na peaceful resolution of conflict. Angola will continue \r\nto meet its obligations and fulfil its responsibilities \r\nat the international level, in particular with regard \r\nto Africa as a whole, as well as in the context of the \r\nregional economic and political groups to which it \r\nbelongs, including the Southern African Development \r\nCommunity, the Community of Portuguese-speaking \r\nCountries, the Economic Community of Central \r\nAfrican States and the International Conference of the \r\nGreat Lakes Region.\r\nThe international economic and financial crisis \r\nthat is affecting all countries in the world continues \r\nto demand solutions, including the reform of the \r\neconomic, financial and international trade system in \r\n12-52557 41\r\nA/67/PV.19\r\nexacerbate the humanitarian situation in the region. \r\nAngola urges the international community to support \r\nthe efforts of Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, Joint Special \r\nRepresentative of the United Nations and the League \r\nof Arab States for Syria, to seek a negotiated solution \r\nto the conflict.\r\nThe embargo imposed on Cuba violates international \r\nlaw and for decades has been a major impediment to that \r\ncountry’s development and improvements in the lives \r\nof its citizens. Angola reiterates its principled position \r\naffirming the need to end the embargo in accordance \r\nwith the relevant United Nations resolutions.\r\nAngola’s foreign policy will continue to be based on \r\nmutual respect, mutual benefit, good-neighbourliness \r\nand the strengthening of regional economic integration. \r\nAngola will continue to comply with all the international \r\ncommitments and international instruments to which it \r\nis a party. \r\nTen years after achieving peace, Angola has \r\nrecorded significant progress in consolidating its \r\ndemocratic process. General elections were held on \r\n31 August in a civil and peaceful atmosphere, thus \r\ndemonstrating the maturity of its people. The results \r\nexpressed the sovereign will of the Angolan people, \r\nas verified by international observers who closely \r\nfollowed the election.\r\nCurrently, Angola is joyfully celebrating the \r\ninvestiture of its organs of State sovereignty, including \r\nthe President of the Republic and the National Assembly, \r\nas well as the assumption of office by members of the \r\nGovernment. It is experiencing a dynamic reconstruction \r\nand development process marked by the consolidation \r\nof macroeconomic stability that has had positive \r\neffects on the stabilization of the national currency. \r\nIn addition, the rehabilitation and modernization of \r\nmajor productive and social infrastructure, namely \r\nthe reconstruction of roads, railways, electricity \r\nsupply and distribution systems, water supply systems \r\nand sanitation and telecommunication networks, are \r\ncontributing to the progressive improvement of the \r\nliving conditions of Angolans.\r\nPolitical stability and the strengthening of \r\ninstitutional capacity have enabled the Angolan \r\neconomy to grow at an average rate of 9.2 per cent over \r\nthe past five years, while the non-oil sector has grown \r\nat an average rate of 12 per cent. Those growth rates \r\nwere due to effective measures by the Government \r\naimed at stabilizing the fiscal, monetary and currency \r\nKampala, as well as the efforts of the African Union \r\nand the Southern African Development Community.\r\nAngola welcomes the normalization of the legal \r\nand constitutional order in Somalia as a result of the \r\ncompletion of the transition process, including the \r\ninauguration of President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud. \r\nGiven that the situation remains unstable, Angola urges \r\nthe international community to continue to support the \r\nstabilization process in that country.\r\nThe situation in the Sudan has seen positive \r\ndevelopments. Angola welcomes the recent agreements \r\nbetween the sisterly Republics of South Sudan and the \r\nSudan, with a view to the settling of their disputes. \r\nAngola urges stakeholders to engage with one another \r\nand to show the political will necessary to implement \r\nthe commitments undertaken.\r\nWith respect to Mali, Angola deplores the \r\nworsening humanitarian situation resulting from \r\nthe crisis prevailing in that country. Angola calls \r\nupon the international community to demonstrate its \r\ndetermination to preserve the unity, sovereignty and \r\nterritorial integrity of Mali. \r\nIn the sisterly nation of Guinea-Bissau, we \r\nadvocate a comprehensive solution and the permanent \r\nnormalization of the constitutional order, in accordance \r\nwith the relevant resolutions of the Security Council, the \r\nAfrican Union, the Community of Portuguese-speaking \r\nCountries and the Economic Community of West \r\nAfrican States, as well as the wishes of all the internal \r\nactors, in order to stabilize the country and establish \r\npeace.\r\nWe remain concerned about the lack of progress \r\nin resolving the issue of Western Sahara. We call on \r\nthe parties involved to continue negotiations under \r\nthe auspices of the United Nations so that the people \r\nof Western Sahara can exercise their right of self-\r\ndetermination.\r\nThe prevailing situation in the Middle East in \r\ngeneral, and the Palestinian territories in particular, \r\nis one of the most serious problems facing the \r\ninternational community. Angola supports the creation \r\nof an independent Palestinian State living side by side \r\nwith the State of Israel in peace and security and within \r\nsecure internationally recognized borders, in line with \r\nthe position of the international community.\r\nThe conflict in Syria poses a grave threat to \r\ninternational peace and security and will seriously \r\n42 12-52557\r\nA/67/PV.19\r\nhave shown in us and for the assistance provided by \r\ninternational partners which, added to investment from \r\nnational sources, has allowed us to achieve the level of \r\neconomic growth the country has been experiencing. \r\nWe are aware that there is still much to do to ensure \r\nthat the high growth rates the country has seen in the \r\nrecent past are reflected in an effective, systematic and \r\ngradual increase in the standard of living of the Angolan \r\npeople, through a better distribution of national income \r\nand higher employment levels, especially among youth, \r\nand increased and better investment in the area of social \r\nwelfare. \r\nIn conclusion, I must reiterate Angola’s commitment \r\nto the purposes and principles embodied in the Charter \r\nof the United Nations and state that we will continue \r\nto engage in the search for solutions to the challenges \r\nfacing the international community.\r\nThe meeting rose at 2.45 p.m.\r\nmacroeconomic indicators and thereby facilitating the \r\nrevival of the economy.\r\nThe fi ght against hunger and the struggle to reduce \r\nand eradicate poverty are two of the biggest challenges \r\nbeing addressed by the Angolan State owing to their \r\nimpact on people’s lives. Indeed, their resolution is \r\ncrucial if we are to build a more prosperous society and \r\nachieve social justice.\r\nDespite Angola’s successes in the last decade, \r\nit was not possible to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals as we had wished. However, the \r\ncountry’s macroeconomic development indicators have \r\npermitted the Committee for Development Policy of \r\nthe Economic and Social Council to consider Angola \r\neligible to graduate from its least developed country \r\nstatus starting in 2015.\r\nOn behalf of the Angolan Government, we would \r\nlike to express our gratitude for the trust that investors \r\n"
