Our Organization and our \r\nCharter have survived and thrived through dark times \r\nand great adversity. The letter and spirit of the Charter \r\nremain alive and vibrant in a constantly changing world. \r\nOur work continues to be important, even in the face of \r\ndoubts about the relevance of multilateral institutions. \r\nAll that was possible because at the heart of our \r\ndetermination to build peace has been our commitment \r\nto the rule of law. Keeping faith in the law allows us \r\nto treat each other fairly and in the spirit of sovereign \r\nequality. It provides the rules that enable nations to \r\nrelate to one another and work together. It reduces \r\narbitrariness and unilateralism. Fidelity to the rule of \r\nlaw allows us not only the means to resolve differences \r\nbut also the substance on which to build better \r\nunderstanding.\r\nOur advocacy for the rule of law not only is born \r\nof our experience and insights as a founding Member \r\nof the United Nations and an active participant in \r\ninternational affairs, but also is deeply rooted in our \r\nexperience as a nation. Our freedom was hard-won. \r\nOur democracy was achieved only after decades of \r\ndictatorship. Our governance was sullied by corruption \r\nand patronage in previous years.\r\nOur President, Benigno S. Aquino III, has placed \r\nthe rule of law at the centre of his governance. As a \r\nresult, the culture of impunity has been neutralized, \r\nour economy is on the upswing and our people’s rights \r\nand freedoms are assured.\r\nAmong the gravest threats that continue to face us \r\ntoday is the deadly testament of man’s ability to destroy \r\nhis fellow man. The full force of the rule of law must be \r\nbrought to bear to prevent the proliferation of nuclear \r\nweapons, to promote nuclear disarmament and to end \r\nthe f low of illicit weapons. The Philippines is proud \r\nto have presided over the 2010 Review Conference \r\nof the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \r\nof Nuclear Weapons. The historic adoption of the 64 \r\naction points strengthened the legal regime of the \r\nTreaty.\r\nWe also support nuclear-weapon-free zones, \r\nincluding the Southeast Asian Nuclear-Weapon-Free \r\nZone created by the Association of Southeast Asian \r\nNations. It is essential that such a zone be created \r\nUnited Nations A/67/PV.20\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-seventh session\r\n20th plenary meeting\r\nMonday, 1 October 2012, 3 p.m.\r\nNew York\r\nOffi cial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Jeremić . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Serbia)\r\n2 12-52563\r\nA/67/PV.20\r\nfor the volatile Middle East, as envisaged by the 2010 \r\nReview Conference. The Philippines commends the \r\nStates of the region, the depository States of the 1995 \r\nresolution 50/78, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and \r\nthe Government of Finland for setting the stage for \r\nthe 2012 Conference that will pursue that most urgent \r\nobjective.\r\nThe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty \r\nis another critical pillar of global disarmament and \r\nnon-proliferation. The Philippines commends Indonesia \r\nfor being the latest annex 2 State to ratify the Treaty, \r\nand it reiterates its call to the remaining eight annex \r\n2 States to accede at the soonest possible time. Other \r\nStates not included in annex 2, but not parties to the \r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, must do the \r\nsame to ensure the universality of the Treaty.\r\nWe must also actively pursue respect for the law of \r\npeace and humanitarian law in the numerous regional \r\nconflicts that affect the lives, safety and well-being of \r\nmillions of people around the world. Towards that end, \r\npeacekeeping is the crucial tool by which the Charter’s \r\nmandate is carried out. Despite its limited resources, \r\nthe Philippines is doing its part in that important task. \r\nWe are currently a major contributor to United Nations \r\npeacekeeping missions. We call on others to also do \r\nall that they can. And we support innovative efforts to \r\nhelp embattled communities, including proposals on \r\npossible unarmed peacekeeping that would expand the \r\ncivilian component of our endeavours.\r\nThe Philippines also recognizes the important role \r\nof women in the promotion of peace and continues to \r\ndeploy more female peacekeepers to peacekeeping \r\nmissions. We aim to attain and surpass the 10 per \r\ncent deployment target of women in country troop \r\ncontingents and 20 per cent for police deployments.\r\nWith a tenth of the population of our country in \r\nforeign lands, there is a very real and human dimension \r\nto our quest to strengthen the rule of law. To further \r\ngalvanize international dialogue and cooperation, the \r\nPhilippines has been among the principal advocates for \r\ndeveloping norms of international law that will protect \r\nnot only our overseas Filipinos but all migrants. Human \r\ntrafficking is a crime of such magnitude that it cannot \r\nbe dealt with by a single nation or even by a group of \r\nnations. The international community as a whole must \r\nstand together against that scourge. For that reason, the \r\nPhilippines became a founding member of the Group \r\nof Friends United against Human Trafficking, and we \r\nare the main sponsor of the biennial General Assembly \r\nresolution on trafficking in women and girls.\r\nIn pursuit of that objective, we call on all Member \r\nStates to implement the Global Plan of Action against \r\nTrafficking in Persons and to ratify and enforce human \r\nrights instruments such as the Palermo Protocol and \r\nthe International Convention on the Protection of the \r\nRights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their \r\nFamilies.\r\nMany of my country’s overseas Filipinos are found \r\non merchant ships. Filipinos form the bulk of seafarers. \r\nMany have fallen victim to pirates. Maritime piracy \r\ncontinues to be a menace to the entire world. A full 80 per \r\ncent of world trade travels by sea — almost six billion \r\ntons of cargo, moved by some 93,000 merchant vessels, \r\nmanned by 1.25 million seafarers. The business and \r\nhuman costs of piracy cannot be overstated. We support \r\nbilateral, multilateral, regional and interregional efforts \r\nto address the impact of piracy, including measures to \r\nimprove the welfare of affected seafarers.\r\nThe Philippine Constitution values the dignity of \r\nevery human person and guarantees full respect for all \r\nhuman rights. Our National Human Rights Action Plan \r\n2009-2014 aims to mainstream human rights standards \r\ninto all parts of the national Government and national \r\nlife. The Plan fully respects our obligations under the \r\neight major international human rights treaties.\r\nAs a founding and current member of the Human \r\nRights Council, the Philippines works with the other \r\nmembers of the Council to safeguard the human \r\nrights of vulnerable groups, such as migrants, women, \r\nchildren, young people, the elderly, indigenous peoples \r\nand persons with disabilities. The Philippines has \r\nactively contributed to initiatives on human rights, \r\nextreme poverty, human rights education, combating \r\ntrafficking in persons, especially women and children, \r\nand climate change.\r\nThe Philippines was one of the first nations to \r\nsubmit to the universal periodic review process of \r\nthe Human Rights Council. Last month, the Council \r\nadopted by consensus our second report under that \r\nreview mechanism.\r\nThe noble vision of the Universal Declaration of \r\nHuman Rights and of many other profound declarations \r\nis far from being realized for the poor, the deprived, \r\nthe oppressed and the marginalized. The recent global \r\nfinancial and economic crises have left such vulnerable \r\n12-52563 3\r\nA/67/PV.20\r\nInternational Labour Organization and the International \r\nOrganization for Migration.\r\nThe rule of law is an instrument of justice and \r\ndevelopment. Yet the continuing global economic \r\nchallenges and financial instability make it even more \r\nimportant that we focus on ensuring that the rule of \r\nlaw gives everyone their due. Poverty, hunger, poor \r\nhealth and education and a deteriorating environment \r\nare threats to all and require nothing less than our \r\nconcerted and collective response.\r\nIn all development efforts, we must respect the \r\nprinciples and norms of sustainability that are crucial \r\nto the continued health of the Earth and of our peoples. \r\nConsequently, the Philippines will further integrate \r\nkey ideas from the United Nations Conference on \r\nSustainable Development into the review of its medium-\r\nterm development plan, even as we continue to pursue \r\nthe attainment of the Millennium Development Goals \r\nby 2015.\r\nFor many developing countries such as the \r\nPhilippines, food security remains a crucial issue. \r\nRecent events have shown that the capacity to \r\nsource affordable food can affect millions of people, \r\nsometimes even to the extent of their sheer survival. We \r\nexpress our appreciation to the General Assembly for \r\nthe adoption of resolution 66/222, declaring 2014 the \r\nInternational Year of Family Farming.\r\nAs a country particularly prone to natural disasters, \r\nincluding those wrought by climate change, we value \r\nthe work being done in advancing the management of \r\nnatural disaster risk reduction. Global and regional \r\ncooperation through partnerships is the best way \r\nto strengthen the international humanitarian and \r\nemergency response system.\r\nNatural disasters plague mankind. The forces of \r\nnature are difficult to contain. That should not be the \r\ncase in humankind’s quest for peace. While natural \r\ndisasters are impossible to prevent, the same is not true \r\nof war and conflict.\r\nThe United Nations was created to protect the \r\nweak from the strong, to provide for the equality of \r\nall sovereign States and to enshrine the rule of law \r\nas the governing principle in regulating international \r\ndisputes.The Philippines is therefore steadfast in \r\npromoting the peaceful settlement of disputes through \r\na rules-based approach. We stand firmly behind the \r\nefforts of the United Nations to promote the rule of law \r\nand mediation.\r\nsectors of our societies in even greater danger. The \r\nPhilippine Government therefore strongly supports \r\nmeasures for the empowerment of those disadvantaged \r\nand endangered groups and strongly advocates policies \r\nthat aim to raise their participation and integration in \r\nsociety.\r\nFor that reason, it is important to achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) and to plan \r\nfor the post-MDG period, after 2015. Accordingly, \r\nthe Philippines, together with Tanzania, initiated \r\nresolution 66/124, entitled “High-level Meeting of the \r\nGeneral Assembly on the realization of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and other internationally agreed \r\ndevelopment goals for persons with disabilities”. The \r\n2013 High-level Meeting seeks the inclusiveness of the \r\ndisabled, a cause to which all should rally.\r\nWe are instituting measures to enhance the role \r\nand the status of women and are strengthening their \r\nprotection through the Philippine Commission on \r\nWomen, whose foundation predates the Convention on \r\nthe Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against \r\nWomen, through the key legislation of the Magna Carta \r\nof Women and through the Philippine Plan for Gender-\r\nResponsive Development 1995-2015.\r\nMigration remains an unheralded and \r\nunderappreciated dimension of globalization today. Yet \r\nthe reality is that hundreds of millions live and work \r\noutside their native lands, providing benefits to both \r\ntheir host nations and their countries of origin. The \r\nGlobal Forum on Migration and Development, which \r\nthe Philippines chaired in 2008, allows us to share our \r\npractical experiences in migration management and in \r\nprotecting the rights and welfare of all migrants. We \r\nlook forward to a successful outcome of the Forum \r\nsummit in Port Louis, Mauritius, in November.\r\nEarlier this year, the Philippines was pleased to \r\nratify two key international instruments that affect \r\nmigrants everywhere, namely, the Maritime Labour \r\nConvention and the Convention concerning Decent \r\nWork for Domestic Workers. Our ratification brings \r\nthose two agreements into force next year.\r\nAs a further indication of our commitment to \r\nprotecting the rights of migrants, the Philippines \r\nwill co-host a regional meeting of the Global Forum \r\non Migration and Development, under the title \r\n“International Migrant Domestic Care Workers at the \r\nInterface of Migration and Development”, in Manila \r\nlater this month, with the support of UN-Women, the \r\n4 12-52563\r\nA/67/PV.20\r\nIn 1982, we adopted the Manila Declaration on \r\nthe Peaceful Settlement of Disputes. This year marks \r\nits thirtieth anniversary. The principles and processes \r\nset out in the Manila Declaration remain applicable to \r\nthis day and are a stark reminder that we have yet to \r\novercome the barriers that divide countries and peoples \r\nthroughout the planet. For that reason, we share the \r\nPresident’s view that “Bringing about the adjustment \r\nor settlement of international disputes or situations \r\nby peaceful means” is essential to the future peace, \r\nprogress and prosperity of all nations.\r\nFurthermore, from the perspective of the rule of law, \r\nand given the maritime disputes that have intensified \r\nin the Asian region, the United Nations Convention on \r\nthe Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) has never been more \r\nrelevant than it is today. All States must respect their \r\nobligations to settle their maritime disputes by peaceful \r\nmeans under UNCLOS, without the threat or use of \r\nforce. A rules-based approach under UNCLOS can \r\npeacefully resolve the Asian maritime disputes.\r\nToday, my country faces its most serious \r\nchallenge — a challenge to the security of its maritime \r\ndomain and the integrity of its national territory, as well \r\nas its effective protection of its marine environment. \r\nTo address this challenge and to arrive at a durable \r\nresolution, we must rely on the rule of law and not the \r\nforce of arms. We must rely on the body of rules that \r\nstate that disputes must be resolved peacefully. We must \r\nrely on the norms and rules enshrined in UNCLOS. We \r\ntherefore rely on our friends and allies and all those \r\nwho believe in the peaceful and fair management of the \r\nseas and oceans to uphold the rule of law and UNCLOS. \r\nWe will endeavour to elicit a more proactive approach \r\nfrom the General Assembly.\r\nWe often hear the quote that “we are a country of \r\nlaws and not of men”. I shall modify it to say that “we \r\nare a community of nations and not of hegemons”. Let us \r\nmake this a reality. Let us all, without exception, respect \r\nthe international legal framework to utilize institutions \r\nand adhere to commitments in treaties and conventions. \r\nFor in so doing, we create global norms that will serve \r\nour nations in good stead today and in the future, and \r\nwe will preserve the one great institution that we have \r\ncharged with promoting peace and prosperity in our \r\nworld, our United Nations. If we achieve this, rather \r\nthan being forced to accept that might is right, we will \r\ninstead demonstrate that right is might.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Wilfred Elrington, Attorney General, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade of \r\nBelize.\r\nMr. Elrington (Belize): It is my distinct honour \r\nto address the Assembly on behalf of the Government \r\nand people of Belize. I wish to congratulate Mr. Vuk \r\nJeremić on his election as President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-seventh session. I am confident \r\nthat he will guide the deliberations of the Assembly in \r\na forthright and skilful manner.\r\nI take this opportunity to reaffirm Belize’s \r\nunequivocal commitment to the principles, goals \r\nand ideals of the United Nations, and to pledge our \r\nunconditional support for the success of its endeavours. \r\nBased on its performance over the past 67 years, we \r\nfeel confident to opine that, whereas the United Nations \r\nis unquestionably imperfect, just as our democracy is \r\nimperfect, our United Nations is also, however — like \r\ndemocracy — the best institution devised by mankind \r\ndedicated exclusively to achieving a safer, more just \r\nand prosperous world.\r\nAs the twenty-first century inexorably evolves, \r\nlaying bare the fragility and vulnerability of our planet \r\nto dangerous global forces, both natural and man-made, \r\nwhich threaten the existence of all living things on \r\nour planet, the genius and prescience of the founding \r\nfathers in creating the United Nations is illuminated \r\nbeyond doubt. It is probably debatable whether in \r\n1945 the imperative for mankind to work together \r\nin harmony to ensure the survival of our very planet \r\nwas appreciated by all nations. It may be questionable \r\nwhether it was universally appreciated in 1945 that it \r\nwas absolutely necessary to have a global institution \r\ndedicated to the protection of mankind against man’s \r\npenchant for causing destruction as well as against \r\nNature’s destructive elements and forces. Today, \r\nhowever, the need for the United Nations is not only \r\nmanifest to everyone, but there are clarion calls for it \r\nto do more and to be more inclusive, representative and \r\ndemocratic, calls to which Belize adds its voice.\r\nMy country gained its independence largely in \r\nconsequence of a resolution of the United Nations \r\ncalling upon the United Kingdom to grant us our \r\nindependence by the end of 1981, thereby bringing to \r\nan end more than 100 years of colonial administration. \r\nBut whereas we attained our political independence in \r\nSeptember 1981, our sovereignty over our homeland is \r\nstill being threatened by a territorial claim dating back \r\nto the post-1940s by our neighbour Guatemala.\r\n12-52563 5\r\nA/67/PV.20\r\nWe therefore find the theme for this session’s \r\ndebate a timely and fitting one, namely, bringing about \r\nadjustment or settlement of international disputes or \r\nsituations by peaceful means. Happily, I can today \r\ninform the Assembly that the Governments of Guatemala \r\nand Belize both have agreed to a recommendation of \r\nthe Secretary-General of the Organization of American \r\nStates to allow the Guatemalan claim to be adjudicated \r\nupon by the International Court of Justice if that is \r\nthe will of the citizens of our respective countries, as \r\nexpressed in simultaneous referendums to be held on \r\n6 October 2013.\r\nThe resolution of the territorial differendum \r\nbetween Belize and Guatemala will not only consolidate \r\nBelize’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, but also \r\nenhance the peace and security of our subregion and be \r\nconducive to the strengthening and deepening of our \r\nregional integration process.\r\nBelizeans are a peace-loving people. We abhor \r\nconflict. We believe in the rule of law. And we have \r\nfaith in the United Nations.\r\nWith almost half of our population under the age \r\nof 25 and approximately 37 per cent under the age of \r\n18, our nation’s future and destiny are inextricably tied \r\nto the welfare of our children. And in order for them \r\nto attain their full potential, they must be properly \r\nnurtured and fed with balanced, nutritious meals. They \r\nmust be safely and comfortably housed and they must \r\nbe properly educated and trained, beginning from the \r\ntime they are in the cradle. Our children must be trained \r\nand educated especially in science and technology. \r\nThey must be trained to think creatively, to be fiercely \r\ncompetitive, to be industrious and to be prudent in \r\nthe management of our resources. Our Government is \r\nconvinced that it is only with this type of training and \r\ndevelopment that our citizens will be able to compete \r\nsuccessfully in the world market and generate the \r\nwealth that is required to transform our society into a \r\ntruly developed nation. If we fail our children today, we \r\nare setting ourselves up to fail in our common future.\r\nWith a view to attaining development objectives, \r\nour Government has initiated some ambitious, \r\ncomprehensive pro-poor policies. For example, our \r\nGovernment is committed to a programme to ensure that \r\nlow-income Belizean families do not have to face the \r\ndifficult choice between sending their children to school \r\nor buying food. Qualifying families in underserved \r\nrural or urban areas can already rely on our conditional \r\ncash-transfer programme and on our food pantry \r\nprogramme. We provide education subsidies to families \r\nof children attending secondary school. We continue \r\nto emphasize and expand early childhood education \r\nand to improve access to alternative education. We are \r\ninvesting in improving the quality of the health care to \r\nwhich our citizens have access.\r\nAs a small State that took its place among the \r\nnations of the world only 31 years ago, Belize is \r\nexperiencing all the growing pains that naturally aff lict \r\nthe young. Furthermore, our situation is aggravated by \r\nthe fact our population is less than 350,000 persons, \r\nwho trace their origins to all over the globe and are \r\nconsequently multi-ethnic, multi-faith, multilingual \r\nand multicultural. With such a diverse population, the \r\nurgency of social cohesion cannot be overstated. When \r\nwe add to this mix the challenges which today confront \r\nus all, occasioned by natural disasters such as climate \r\nchange and by man-made ones such as the global \r\nfinancial collapse and transnational criminal activity, \r\nit becomes readily apparent that it is wholly beyond \r\nthe capacity of any one Government to discharge its \r\nobligation towards its citizens solely through national \r\ninitiatives and devices and solely with domestic \r\nresources.\r\nFor this reason, the Belize Government has \r\nembraced the multilateral system and our cooperation \r\npartners around the world. We are partnering with \r\nthem in many fields, including economic, social, \r\nenvironmental and humanitarian, in our perennial \r\nquest to better secure all our citizens and develop them \r\nto their fullest potential. In this regard, United Nations \r\nfunds, programmes and agencies such as the United \r\nNations Development Programme, the United Nations \r\nPopulation Fund, UNICEF, UNESCO, the Food and \r\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations, the \r\nUnited Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, and  the \r\nWorld Health Organization are working tirelessly with \r\ncountries like Belize to carry out the decisions of the \r\ninternational community and support efforts to meet \r\nthe aspirations of our people. Belize avails itself of this \r\nopportunity to thank all our development partners for \r\nthe tremendous contributions they make daily to the \r\nsecurity and development of our country and people.\r\nWe know that more can and, indeed, must be done \r\nto raise our ambitions in delivering for the poor, for the \r\nneedy and for the vulnerable. It is therefore urgent that \r\nwe move to shape a post-2015 development agenda that \r\nreflects our equal stake in a common future, addresses \r\n6 12-52563\r\nA/67/PV.20\r\nthe concerns of the wealthy and strong, and meets the \r\nneeds of the poor and the vulnerable.\r\nBelize remains fully supportive of all regional \r\ninitiatives. We have sought and obtained membership \r\nin the Organization of American States, the Caribbean \r\nCommunity (CARICOM), the Central American \r\nIntegration System and the Community of Latin \r\nAmerican and Caribbean States. We work closely in all \r\nthese subregional groupings on the issues of concern \r\nto us such as climate change, security and economic \r\ndevelopment. And here we feel constrained to point \r\nout that the impact of climate change on our region has \r\nbeen direct, dire and devastating, compelling us to join \r\nforces with our CARICOM partners and with the wider \r\nAlliance of Small Island States to advance our interests \r\nin the climate change negotiation process. In that \r\nconnection, Belize is proud of its contribution as host \r\nnation of the CARICOM Climate Change Centre, which \r\nis tasked to provide technical and scientific advice \r\nto inform subregional policy positions in executing \r\nadaptation and mitigation projects in our subregion and \r\nto raise awareness of the deleterious impact of climate \r\nchange in our respective countries. We thank the staff \r\nof that institution for the sterling work they are doing.\r\nWith respect to the nefarious enterprises of \r\ntransnational trafficking in humans, drugs and arms, \r\nBelize subscribes to the view that a regional response \r\nis imperative to combat these pernicious scourges. \r\nOur countries are not the markets for these illicit \r\ncommodities. Our countries do not benefit from \r\nthe immense profits generated by these criminal \r\nenterprises, yet we bear the burden of having to divert \r\nscarce resources, badly needed for development, to \r\ncombat the activities of these merchants of death and \r\ndestruction. Indeed, our countries are overwhelmed by \r\nthe grim tasks which now befall us of having to mend \r\nthe shattered lives of our children and of mourning \r\ntheir untimely deaths. That is why Belize is committed \r\nto the implementation of the Central America Regional \r\nSecurity Strategy and to working with our partners \r\nto ensure that the Strategy has the level of support \r\nnecessary to guarantee that it is effective.\r\nOur region, Central America and the Caribbean, \r\nhas been labelled as among the most violent regions \r\nof the world, with homicide rates that have reached \r\ncrisis levels, occasioned largely by the use of small \r\narms and light weapons. But almost all small arms and \r\nlight weapons found in our region start out as legally \r\nmanufactured and legally traded arms. Every Member \r\nof the United Nations is involved in some measure in this \r\ntrade, which we believe is of dubious value to mankind. \r\nIt is therefore deeply regrettable that, despite what \r\nappeared to be an emerging consensus and despite the \r\nunderlying global urgency of a multilateral response, \r\nthe conclusion of an arms trade treaty has so far been \r\nbeyond the reach of the international community. It \r\nis urgent, in our view, that we redouble our efforts to \r\nbreak the gridlock and reach the compromise necessary \r\nto arrive at a consensus on an arms trade treaty as soon \r\nas possible.\r\nThe States of Latin America and the Caribbean are \r\nalmost all classified — wrongly and unjustly, in our \r\nview — as middle-income countries. That is a generic \r\nclassification that masks the varied challenges our \r\ncountries continue to face arising from poverty, high \r\nlevels of income inequality, economic vulnerabilities \r\nand debt. As a consequence, all our countries have \r\nbeen calling for a change in paradigm so that the \r\nclassification of countries as middle-income countries \r\nno longer guides development cooperation. We urge all \r\nour development partners to heed this call and address \r\nthis situation.\r\nFinally, we would like to echo the call of other \r\nMembers of this institution who have advocated the \r\nlifting of the economic embargo against Cuba, which \r\ncontinues to fetter the development of that sister \r\nCaribbean nation and its people.\r\nBelize also notes and joins those positive voices \r\nthat support Taiwan. We therefore urge Taiwan’s full \r\nparticipation in the United Nations.\r\nWe ask also that urgent attention be given to the \r\nconcerns of the people of Israel and Palestine, whose \r\nlegitimate expectation to live peaceful, fruitful lives \r\ncontinues to be frustrated. And we stand in solidarity \r\nwith the citizens of the Middle East, particularly those \r\nin Syria, in their quest for those democratic freedoms \r\nto which we all aspire.\r\nAs we move ahead to take on the new challenges \r\nthat will emerge during the sixty-seventh session, as \r\nwe redouble our efforts to address the long-standing \r\nproblems our world faces, and as we renew our faith \r\nin the multilateral system, the role of the Assembly \r\nand of our United Nations Organization will become \r\nincreasingly critical and relevant. This is the only body \r\nthat is truly universal in character and which commands \r\nlegitimacy and authority. The entire world looks to the \r\nUnited Nations to solve the multitudinous problems \r\n12-52563 7\r\nA/67/PV.20\r\nwhich beset mankind. In the circumstances, the United \r\nNations is simply just too big to fail in the discharge of \r\nits singular obligation: to safeguard the well-being and \r\nsafety of humankind and planet Earth.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Vladimir Makei, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Republic of Belarus.\r\nMr. Makei (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): We often \r\ninvoke the phrase “the spirit of San Francisco”. We do \r\nthat when we speak and think about positive aspects of \r\ninternational relations. Indeed, the message sent from \r\nthe 1945 Conference in San Francisco offered immense \r\nhope to the generation that had just survived the most \r\nhorrible war ever experienced — hope for building \r\na fundamentally new world. Justice was intended \r\nto replace violence, cooperation was to replace \r\nlawlessness. The United Nations, founded in that city, \r\nwas called upon to become the key element of a new \r\norder.\r\nHave the hopes, born in San Francisco, come \r\ntrue? To some extent, they have. After all, today there \r\nis no sign of the sharp ideological confrontation that \r\ncharacterized the twentieth century. Nor is there the \r\ndirect, open conflict between the major Powers that had \r\nmarked all previous centuries with its violence. What \r\nis more, such scourges as colonialism, slavery and \r\napartheid have been irrevocably consigned to oblivion.\r\nBut the spirit of San Francisco was about something \r\nmore than just preventing the recurring mistakes of \r\nthe past. First and foremost, it was a message about a \r\npromising future. Unfortunately, that is precisely what \r\nhas failed to become a reality. Why? Reinhold Niebuhr, \r\nan outstanding American philosopher who was writing \r\nin those fateful times, noted that general community \r\nis established only when the knowledge that we need \r\none another is supplemented by the recognition that the \r\nother form of life, or that unique other community, is \r\nthe limit beyond which our ambitions must not run.\r\nToday that point is as insightful as it was then. \r\nSome countries see neither the limits of their foreign \r\npolicy nor forms of statehood other than their own. \r\nAnd that is exactly what gives rise to many of today’s \r\ngeopolitical problems. States that refuse to follow \r\npatterns imposed from the outside and choose to defend \r\ntheir real sovereignty must pay dearly for that right.\r\nTake the case of Cuba. The historic choice to pursue \r\nan independent path of development that was made by \r\nits people more than five decades ago encountered \r\nrejection and economic blockade on the part of those \r\nwho still believe, in the twenty-first century, that they \r\ncan continue to write the history of humankind in the \r\nsame manner as they did in the past. And that is not the \r\nonly example.\r\nBelarus is fully convinced that any attempt to make \r\nsomeone do something against their will is doomed to \r\nfail. Are we not learning the lessons of the past? After \r\nall, neither weapons nor wealth constitute the greatest \r\nsource of power on Earth. That power stems rather \r\nfrom the spirit of self-determination. If a nation has \r\nembarked on its own path of peaceful and progressive \r\ndevelopment, then no external force is able to stop it in \r\nits tracks. Battles can be won against such a nation, but \r\nnever wars.\r\nThe time of imperialism, in whatever lofty slogans \r\nit is now being dressed — democracy, human rights, \r\ngood governance — is irreversibly past. Furthermore, \r\ntoday we are weighed down by global economic \r\nchallenges, nearly all of which have resulted from a \r\npolicy of so-called market fundamentalism relentlessly \r\npursued by its proponents over the past four decades. \r\nIts major outcome is a steady rise in inequality at \r\nall levels. Essentially we are witnessing the great \r\ndivergence. Clearly, the situation resembles a slowly \r\nticking time-bomb of future mass upheavals fraught \r\nwith unpredictable consequences.\r\nUnfortunately, the current economic woes are \r\nstructural and therefore unlikely to be quickly and \r\ndecisively resolved. That is attested to by the fact that \r\nthe crisis persists all over the world four years after \r\nit began. The measures adopted over that period have \r\nfailed to do much to remedy the situation. Yet, what \r\nis far more disturbing is that the countries whose \r\npolicies had nothing to do with market fundamentalism \r\nhave also experienced severe hardships. Because of \r\nthe growing global interdependence of all aspects of \r\ninternational life, they simply have no other option.\r\nWe call attention to another chronic ailment of \r\nmodernity, of a moral nature. Double standards in the \r\nforeign policy of the world Powers have become a norm. \r\nAs a result, those major world players are willing to go to \r\ngreat lengths to cater to the interests of their “friends”. \r\nYet they advocate the forced imposition of democracy \r\nand human rights on their adversaries. Guided solely by \r\ntheir own interests, the players who were shaking hands \r\nwith you yesterday openly contribute to your downfall \r\ntoday. In considering human rights situations in other \r\n8 12-52563\r\nA/67/PV.20\r\nthemselves — they result from human action. At this \r\npoint we are living in a system that may be viewed as \r\na dysfunctional multipolarity. Indeed, we are forced \r\nto witness a rising number of global players that are \r\nproving unable to cope effectively with increasing \r\nglobal demands.\r\nIf we fail to restructure the situation, then we \r\nwill most likely end up with a scenario that is even \r\nworse — something that resembles the dark era of the \r\nMiddle Ages but aggravated by ever more dangerous \r\ntransnational threats and challenges. Thus, again we \r\nreturn to the perennial question: how is it possible to \r\nbuild an effective global order in a world that lacks a \r\nglobal government?We can offer an idea. A response \r\nwould involve addressing the structural issue by means \r\nof a functional approach. Let us try to devise an effective \r\nglobal system by tackling specific functional problems. \r\nAfter all, is it not the case that all positive-minded \r\nglobal stakeholders have an interest in addressing fewer \r\nproblems or eliminating them altogether? \r\nWe are deeply convinced that global partnerships \r\nwill provide the means whereby we realize that vision. \r\nThey can bring together multiple players on the world \r\nstage in a common effort against specific transnational \r\nthreats and challenges. So let us begin working on and \r\nimplementing functional partnerships on each of the \r\nissues. Indeed, my country has already been doing just \r\nthat, for instance, in the fight against human trafficking \r\nwithin the framework of the global partnership against \r\nslavery and human trafficking proposed by Belarus \r\nsome time ago.\r\nThirdly, there is the economic dimension. Mass \r\nprotests across the world, like the Occupy Wall Street \r\nmovement, testify to public rejection of the prevailing \r\ndevelopment model. This is hardly surprising; after \r\nall, the model was built with the interests of corporate \r\ncapital in mind. Clearly, the classic recipe of Adam Smith \r\ndoes not work in a modern world. Contrary to general \r\nexpectations, the invisible hand of the market has not \r\nled to universal public well-being. The experience of \r\nthe past few decades indicates that the invisible hand \r\ncontributes to the enrichment of the corporate sector \r\nalone, while impoverishing others.\r\nThe global economy of the twenty-first century is \r\ntoo sophisticated to be left to the whims of market forces. \r\nThat economy requires a reasonable balance among \r\nits various elements. As far as the balance per se is \r\nconcerned, it cannot be established by default, someone \r\nmust do it. Only a State is able to accomplish that task, \r\ncountries under a microscope, those players have \r\nrefused to acknowledge the obvious faults in their own \r\ncountries. In other words, we have come to witness the \r\nrise of unscrupulous and barbaric behaviour in foreign \r\npolicy that is worthy of the teachings of Machiavelli \r\nhimself.\r\nIt is unfortunate that the United Nations, by and \r\nlarge, has been sidelined in that context. Nevertheless, \r\nit has not been the fault of the Organization. The \r\nbrainchild of San Francisco has simply not been allowed \r\nto function in the manner conceived by its founders.\r\nIs there a way out of the seemingly hopeless \r\nsituation? We are certain that there is. The current \r\nchallenges have not become insurmountable yet. We \r\nwill be able to overcome them. However, that will \r\nrequire us to revive the spirit of San Francisco. We \r\nshould return to the principles and foundations, which \r\ncould serve as the building blocks for a better world \r\ntoday. Multilateralism, justice and cooperation are as \r\nrelevant today as they were in 1945. \r\nSo, what in practical terms must be done? Belarus \r\ndoes not pretend to have exhaustive answers. We would \r\nlike just to draw attention to four areas that, in our view, \r\nare most crucial: the rule of law, politics, economics \r\nand the environment. First, to establish the rule of law \r\nglobally, the system of international law must become \r\nfully functional. Forged through centuries of suffering, \r\nit is the foundation without which all other elements \r\nof modern civilization cannot operate. Having signed \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations, the world’s countries \r\ncommitted themselves to abide by the principles of \r\ninternational law. In other words, they refused to live \r\nany longer under conditions of destructive anarchy and \r\nlawlessness.\r\nInternational law has been shaped as a historic \r\ncompromise between the interests of all States. It \r\nmay be supplemented and revised only if all States \r\nagree to do so. There should be no place for arbitrary \r\ninterpretations that seek to subordinate international \r\nlaw to private interests. Let us bear in mind that such \r\nbehaviour leads to infringement of the interests of other \r\ninternational actors. That is why no trendy concepts \r\nsuch as humanitarian intervention or responsibility to \r\nprotect can justify interference in the internal affairs of \r\nsovereign States.\r\nSecondly, in political terms, we need a stable and \r\npredictable global order. It is up to us whether we will \r\nhave one. Global systems cannot establish and manage \r\n12-52563 9\r\nA/67/PV.20\r\nfor his skilful stewardship of the sixty-sixth session. \r\nMy delegation is confident that under the President’s \r\nguidance and wise leadership, the General Assembly \r\nwill achieve a successful and fruitful outcome. I \r\ntherefore pledge the full support and cooperation of \r\nmy delegation to him, in the discharge of his onerous \r\nresponsibilities.\r\nBotswana is among the developing countries \r\nthat have been adversely affected by the 2008 global \r\neconomic and financial crisis. Consequently, we \r\nwere compelled to reorder our priorities and also \r\ndefer implementation of various approved projects in \r\nour National Development Plan, some of which were \r\nof strategic national importance. In that regard, we \r\ncontinue to be concerned that many of our traditional \r\ndonors who helped us to progress to where we are today, \r\nhave virtually abandoned us following Botswana’s \r\ngraduation to higher middle-income developing country \r\nstatus. Contrary to the perception that Botswana is an \r\neconomically well-off country, we now, more than ever \r\nbefore, need development assistance, on account of the \r\nvaried nature and gravity of the challenges we continue \r\nto face.\r\nWith respect to the African continent, Botswana \r\nhas followed with concern some recent peculiar \r\ndevelopments. The military coups in Mali and Guinea-\r\nBissau early this year are a sad reminder of what we \r\nthought was a closed chapter of the dark days of African \r\npolitics driven by self-interest. Those developments \r\nseriously undermine the significant progress which \r\nAfrica has made to date in embracing and consolidating \r\ndemocracy, good governance, respect for human rights \r\nand the rule of law. We therefore call on the African \r\nUnion to remain firm and resolute in its rejection of \r\nunconstitutional changes of Government on the African \r\ncontinent, and we implore the international community \r\nto give full importance and full support to the African \r\nUnion in that regard.\r\nElsewhere on the continent, we particularly \r\nwelcome the recent agreement between the Sudan and \r\nSouth Sudan on the implementation of the African \r\nUnion road map, aimed at resolving outstanding issues \r\nin the relations between the two countries. However, we \r\nremain concerned about the fragile security situation, \r\nand we therefore appeal to both parties to exercise \r\nmaximum restraint and to commit to honouring the \r\nterms of the road map. Although the appeal is made to \r\nboth sides, we are very much aware that the Sudan is the \r\nmain cause of the instability between the two countries. \r\nand more crucially, a strong, socially oriented State that \r\ndoes not live by borrowing from future generations, as \r\nis currently the case in some advanced countries.We are \r\nconvinced that a State-based paradigm, as we suggest, \r\nwill permit the severe imbalance to be redressed. \r\nLikewise, it is key to significantly reducing poverty in \r\nthe world.\r\nFinally, what is required of us in terms of the \r\nenvironment? Climate change is the central and \r\ndefining challenge of today’s world. This is the wall \r\nthat separates current and future generations from a \r\nprosperous future. Our efforts in all other areas will \r\nprove futile if we fail to tackle this core challenge. We \r\nmust preserve the life-giving ecosystem of the Earth. \r\nThis, therefore, is where there is the greatest need for \r\ncomprehensive international cooperation. \r\nThe United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (Rio+20) was held in June. The \r\nConference’s decisions essentially marked the start of a \r\nnew green deal that is expected to rally all stakeholders \r\nfor common action. We need to move forward \r\ndecisively to implement its individual elements. It is, \r\nabove all, about elaborating sustainable development \r\ngoals and ensuring the transfer and integration of \r\ngreen technologies. In the context of the follow-up to \r\nRio+20, the formulation of a comprehensive United \r\nNations energy agenda must be seriously considered. \r\nWe believe it would contribute to an urgently needed \r\ncomprehensive approach to addressing the interrelated \r\nissues of climate change, energy and food security.\r\nThe United Nations is the natural place for the \r\nimplementation of all the ideas articulated above. No \r\nother international body possesses such universal \r\nlegitimacy. Let us therefore, at last, empower the \r\nUnited Nations. We are certain that the United Nations \r\nwill then be able to realize with dignity the vision set \r\nforth in San Francisco so many years ago.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Phandu T. C. Skelemani, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs and International Cooperation of the \r\nRepublic of Botswana.\r\nMr. Skelemani (Botswana): Allow me, on behalf of \r\nmy delegation, to join preceding speakers in expressing \r\nour felicitations to Mr. Vuk Jeremić on his assumption \r\nof the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-\r\nseventh session. Let me also seize the opportunity to \r\nsincerely commend his predecessor,  Ambassador \r\nNassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, of the State of Qatar, \r\n10 12-52563\r\nA/67/PV.20\r\nThe catalogue of incidents of provocation and blatant \r\nacts of aggression against the Republic of South Sudan \r\nby the North that has led to instability in that region has \r\nbeen typical of the Sudanese regime for many years.\r\nWe live in times when our common well-being \r\nis seriously compromised by such threats as nuclear \r\nproliferation, terrorism, climate change, environmental \r\ndegradation, underdevelopment and pandemic diseases, \r\ncoupled with the effects of the global economic and \r\nfinancial crisis and internal conflicts. The resolution \r\nof the myriad of challenges and threats confronting \r\nmankind requires urgent and concerted action by the \r\ninternational community. Because of its universality, \r\nthe United Nations commands the requisite legitimacy \r\nand moral authority to provide guidance and leadership \r\nin addressing those threats and challenges. It is therefore \r\nimperative that the United Nations of the twenty-first \r\ncentury respond effectively to present realities and \r\neffectively handle future challenges.\r\nWe believe that the international community \r\nshould act and speak out strongly and forthrightly \r\nagainst human rights abuses and atrocities wherever \r\nand whenever they occur. In that regard, my delegation \r\nobserves with deep regret that, over the past few months, \r\nthe world community has watched helplessly and \r\nfailed hopelessly to intervene as Syria descended into \r\nprotracted anarchy. In the process, the Syrian people \r\nhave been subjected to a cycle of violent repression and \r\nsome of the worst human rights abuses and atrocities \r\nknown to mankind.\r\nEven as we speak, the violent crackdown and \r\nbloodshed in that country continue unabated. Al-Assad \r\nhas displaced more than a million Syrians to satisfy \r\nhis lust for power. He has caused around 300,000 \r\nSyrians to f lee into neighbouring countries because \r\nof his criminal acts. He has slaughtered 20,000 of his \r\ncitizens in order to remain President. He has killed \r\nmen, women, children and babies to achieve that. The \r\ninternational community has, regrettably, failed to \r\nrespond collectively. And Syria remains a Member of \r\nthe United Nations, a body with the expressed objective \r\nof defending humankind. That surely cannot be right. \r\nSyria’s allies in the Security Council and in the region \r\nneed to be equally condemned.\r\nThe uprisings in the Middle East, commonly \r\nreferred to as the Arab Spring, have demonstrated that \r\nno amount of force can suppress the will of the people \r\nforever. The situation in Libya, Tunisia and Egypt, \r\nwhere the popular will of the people has ushered in \r\ndemocratic dispensations, attests to that.\r\nConcerning Libya, which had to engage in an \r\ninternal conflict to rid itself of a brutal dictator, we \r\ncommend the Libyan people and their allies in the \r\nmilitary coalition that imposed a no-fly zone in order \r\nto remove Colonel Al-Qadhafi and his regime.\r\nMy delegation is of the view that given its \r\nmandate to maintain international peace and security, \r\nthe Security Council should assume the high moral \r\nground in defending the victims of war crimes and \r\ncrimes against humanity, such as those currently being \r\ncommitted in Syria. The principle of the responsibility \r\nto protect, as expressed in Security Council resolution \r\n1674 (2006), should be forcefully applied wherever \r\ncrimes against humanity occur. In that connection, my \r\ndelegation condemns in the strongest possible terms \r\nthe persistent vetoes by China and Russia of successive \r\nSecurity Council resolutions aimed at putting pressure \r\non the Syrian leadership to cease its heinous crimes \r\nagainst its citizens. We therefore call on those members \r\nof the Council to live up to their responsibilities, in \r\naccordance with the provisions of the United Nations \r\nCharter. We urge the international community to \r\nact swiftly to save the people of Syria from further \r\nunwarranted bloodshed.\r\nBotswana will continue to sponsor and support \r\nthe various General Assembly and Human Rights \r\nCouncil resolutions aimed at addressing the situation in \r\nSyria, as a practical demonstration of our unwavering \r\ncommitment towards a resolution of the Syrian \r\ncrisis. It is for that reason that we join forces with \r\nlike-minded countries in calling for the situation in \r\nSyria to be referred to the International Criminal Court \r\nfor investigation, so that those responsible for crimes \r\nagainst humanity can be held accountable. Al-Assad \r\nand his regime should be removed as soon as possible. \r\nWe must encourage the opposition to unite and to form \r\na transition administration that we can all recognize.\r\nWe wish to commend Turkey and the other countries \r\nthat have taken on the burden of accommodating Syrian \r\nrefugees, have spoken out against the deteriorating \r\nsecurity and humanitarian situation in Syria and \r\nhave responded, with others, to the plea of the \r\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for \r\nRefugees (UNHCR) for contributions. For its part, \r\nBotswana has made a modest contribution to UNHCR to \r\nhelp the humanitarian relief efforts for Syrian refugees. \r\n12-52563 11\r\nA/67/PV.20\r\nactions as permitted under any of these freedoms, \r\nincluding freedom of speech, is itself irresponsible.\r\nTurning to environmental issues, we note the limited \r\nand disappointing progress made at the United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development in addressing \r\nsustainable development issues, as has been the case at \r\nsimilar summits in the past. As we all know, the world \r\nis facing the twin challenges of scarcity of resources \r\nand climate change. Those problems are particularly \r\nacute in Africa, owing to the high incidence of poverty \r\nthere. \r\nTo respond to those big problems, which clearly \r\nneed visionary solutions and strong partnerships for \r\nsustainability on a scale and with an impact that are \r\nunprecedented, my country took the important initiative \r\nof hosting in May the Summit for Sustainability in \r\nAfrica.  Participation was at the Head of State level, \r\nand included representatives of some of the most \r\ninfluential and significant private-sector stakeholders \r\nin the world. The Summit adopted the Gaborone \r\nDeclaration, which, among other things, provides for \r\npolicy improvements at both the Government and the \r\nprivate-sector levels, aimed at integrating the value of \r\nnatural capital development. The Declaration also calls \r\nfor increased private-sector investment in Africa to \r\nhelp reduce food insecurity, improve livelihoods and \r\nincrease sustainability. We therefore call on the United \r\nNations system and the international community in \r\ngeneral to commit to implementing the Declaration.\r\nThere are many important and urgent issues \r\naffecting developing countries that must be addressed. \r\nThey include technology transfer, funding and capacity-\r\nbuilding in other areas, aimed at enabling such countries \r\nto adapt to the requirements of a green economy in the \r\ncontext of sustainable development. In that regard, we \r\nurge the developed world to help developing countries \r\nto address these critical issues and take accelerated \r\naction in order to deal with climate change and its \r\ncauses in their economies.\r\nHowever, we welcome the agreement to launch an \r\nintergovernmental negotiation process that will lead \r\nto the adoption of sustainable development goals as \r\npart of the post-2015 development agenda, when the \r\nimplementation process of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals will have run its course. My delegation believes \r\nthat the process for developing sustainable development \r\ngoals should be synchronized with the 2013 review of the \r\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals. \r\nWe also wish to commend responsible human-rights \r\norganizations, such as Amnesty International and \r\nHuman Rights Watch, for the work they do in seeking \r\nto safeguard the principles that protect humankind. \r\nTheir mission — to act as watchdogs in matters of \r\nsafeguarding human rights — is a very necessary \r\none. Similarly, we commend those humanitarian \r\nnon-governmental organizations that work tirelessly, \r\nwith meagre resources and under very difficult \r\ncircumstances, to bring relief to refugees affected by \r\nnatural and man-made disasters.\r\nHuman rights abuses and atrocities are not limited \r\nto Syria. It is in that context that we affirm our support \r\nfor the International Criminal Court and urge it to \r\ncontinue to fulfil its mandate, including prosecuting \r\nthose indicted for human rights abuses and crimes \r\nagainst humanity. We therefore appeal to States parties \r\nto fully cooperate with the Court in its efforts to bring \r\nthe suspected perpetrators of such crimes to justice.\r\nWe wish to add our voice in condemning the violence \r\nthat occurred following the release of a publication that \r\noffended people of the Islamic faith. There can be no \r\njustification for such a violent response. The violence \r\nitself caused offence to its victims. Retaliation against \r\noffensive expressions therefore cannot take the form \r\nof other offensive actions aimed at innocent parties. \r\nHowever, where democracy is defined as Government \r\nof the people, by the people, for the people — in \r\nother words, doing what is in the best interests of the \r\npeople — how can it be in the people’s best interests if \r\nfreedom of speech results in insults?\r\nOther freedoms, in a democratic dispensation, \r\ninclude freedom of association — but we cannot \r\nassociate with terrorist or criminal groups without \r\nconsequences, since it is not in the people’s best interests \r\nto live among terrorists and criminals. Freedom of \r\nexpression allows for protests — but only peaceful \r\nprotests — in democracies, because it is also not in \r\npeople’s best interests to have violent protests; and in \r\ndemocracies consequences do follow if protests become \r\nviolent. The same goes for freedom of the press, if it is \r\nabused, as it often is. There must be consequences, in \r\norder to protect people’s interests from misinformation \r\nand attempts to discredit or defame them. With all such \r\nfreedoms there must be limits. Democracy is supposed \r\nto be responsible. Causing offence and insult cannot by \r\nany stretch of the imagination be passed off as what \r\nwe want in a democracy. Trying to justify irresponsible \r\n12 12-52563\r\nA/67/PV.20\r\nand tourism score high. The design and construction \r\nof relevant infrastructure demonstrate Suriname’s \r\npotential to be a player on the supply side of strategic \r\ncommodities. \r\nPresident Bouterse also presented a social package \r\nin which education and health care figure prominently. \r\nHe made the point that strong international ratings are \r\nencouraging indicators for investors. However, the \r\ncitizens of Suriname who lack the right opportunities \r\nwill share in the achievements only if the Government \r\nis able to present them with a package comprising job-\r\noriented education at an academic as well as a vocational \r\nlevel, adequate health services, sports facilities, access \r\nto potable water, information and communications \r\ntechnology facilities and proper waste disposal. The \r\nchallenge of financing such an improved social package \r\nmakes it necessary to empower our production and \r\nservice sectors by providing funds and know-how to \r\nour entrepreneurs.\r\nSuriname, as a young nation, is experiencing an \r\nongoing decolonization process that involves both its \r\nstructure and its mindset. Building a nation of half a \r\nmillion people constitutes an enormous challenge when \r\nat least seven different ethnic and cultural traditions \r\noriginate from the Americas, Africa and Europe, while \r\na considerable part of the population traces its roots to \r\nIndia, Indonesia, China and the Middle East. .\r\nSuriname is known for the presence of a synagogue \r\nlocated next to a mosque in the heart of the capital \r\nParamaribo, while Christian churches coexist with \r\nHindu temples and places of worship with a strong \r\nAfrican affinity. We are proud to state that we have \r\nbeen able to convert that challenge into a unique and \r\nexemplary benefit and  that the divide-and-rule policy \r\nof colonial days is gradually disappearing, making way \r\nfor mutual respect, tolerance and peaceful coexistence, \r\nwhich redound to the advantage of all our citizens.\r\nSuriname is a country blessed with an exuberant \r\narray of biodiversity. That splendid gift of the Almighty \r\nmust be cherished and protected to the fullest extent. \r\nIt needs to be mapped out in a way that allows for \r\nresponsible use. The challenge we face is responding to \r\nthe genuine developmental needs of our people, while \r\nat the same time respecting and preserving  biodiversity \r\nfor future generations, and indeed for humankind.\r\nMy country has committed itself to that cause \r\nby, among other actions, creating a nature reserve of \r\n1.8 million hectares. We have accepted the obligation \r\nWe would like to take this opportunity to commend the \r\nwork done by environmental organizations worldwide \r\nin their efforts to save the planet from climate change \r\nand its negative effects.\r\nBotswana participated in the ill-fated United Nations \r\nConference on the Arms Trade Treaty in July, whose \r\npurpose was for Member States to agree on common \r\ninternational standards for regulating the international \r\ntrade in conventional weapons. We believe that, when \r\nadopted, an arms trade treaty will complement the \r\nUnited Nations programme of action for combating the \r\nproliferation of arms and ammunition, which continue \r\nto cause untold suffering.\r\nBefore concluding, I wish to state that Botswana \r\nfully supports the call for implementing the Assembly’s \r\nsuccessive resolutions on lifting sanctions against Cuba, \r\nsomething we believe is logical and long overdue.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Winston Lackin, Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nthe Republic of Suriname.\r\nMr. Lackin (Suriname): On behalf of Mr. Desiré \r\nDelano Bouterse, President of the Republic of Suriname, \r\nI avail myself of this opportunity to extend to Mr. Vuk \r\nJeremić my congratulations on his election as President \r\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. \r\nThe wealth of experience that he brings to this body \r\nwill certainly assist him in successfully discharging his \r\nduties. We pledge our full support and cooperation. \r\nAllow me to salute his predecessor for his skilful \r\nleadership at the sixty-sixth session. We wish him \r\nwell in his future endeavours. To Secretary-General \r\nBan Ki-moon we pledge our support for his valuable \r\ncontribution in advancing the purposes and principles \r\nof the Organization.\r\nIn his annual statement last week, in which he \r\nintroduced the 2013 national budget, the President of \r\nSuriname highlighted Suriname’s strengths and the \r\nopportunities and challenges we are facing as a young, \r\nvibrant member of the international community. As \r\nrefiners and exporters of crude oil and its derivatives, as \r\nwell as producers and exporters of gold, a combination \r\nof windfalls in earnings related to the trade of those \r\ncommodities and the application of prudent fiscal \r\npolicies, have resulted in a politically and economically \r\nstable environment. That stability in turn has become \r\nconducive to solid domestic and foreign investments \r\nin the more sustainable sectors, in which agriculture \r\n12-52563 13\r\nA/67/PV.20\r\nwe firmly call for an immediate end of those coercive \r\nmeasures, which cause so much suffering to the people \r\nof Cuba.\r\nWhen Suriname became a Member of the United \r\nNations 36 years ago, we were little aware of the \r\nimportance of a number of issues not specifically \r\ndealing with decolonization. Now we have grown \r\nin our understanding. We realize that a properly \r\nfunctioning United Nations, including a democratically \r\nbased Security Council, has the potential to become \r\nthe single most important stabilizing factor in a world \r\nthat has moved from bipolarity to multipolarity. In the \r\nworld of ever-shifting economic, political, diplomatic \r\nand military Powers, the themes of the sixty-seventh \r\nsession of the General Assembly were appropriately \r\nchosen.\r\nWe specifically want to draw the Assembly’s \r\nattention to the need for dialogue in situations of \r\nconflict. In our understanding, it is not easy for Powers \r\nthat have grown accustomed to controlling other \r\nnations to grasp fully what it means to move away from \r\ndominance and dependence to interdependence and the \r\nneed for dialogue in solving real or alleged conflicts. \r\nBoth the United States of America and the Federative \r\nRepublic of Brazil clearly endorsed the concept in their \r\nstatements at the opening of our general debate.\r\nWe urge all Member States in general and the \r\nformer colonial Powers in particular to accept the new \r\nreality of our world by categorically refraining from \r\napplying their own standards in judging the outcome of \r\nother countries’ democratic structures and aspirations, \r\ndisrespecting the internationally accepted principles of \r\nterritorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of \r\nnations all over the world.\r\nIt is within that framework that I quote the closing \r\nremarks at the presentation of the 2013 national budget \r\nby Mr. Desiré Delano Bouterse, President of the \r\nRepublic of Suriname:\r\n“As regards the sovereignty of our beloved \r\nSuriname as an independent nation, our principal \r\ntask is none other than to respect and to defend the \r\nsovereignty of our nation against all violations and \r\nattacks from outside.\r\n“Whenever and by whomever our sovereignty \r\nis being challenged, our legitimate Government \r\nhas no other duty than to defend and safeguard the \r\nentrusted sovereignty of the country”.\r\nto educate our small gold miners in the use of modern \r\ntechnology that will not only prove more lucrative and \r\nsafe but also respect the need for a clean environment, \r\nallowing for potable water and profitable agriculture. \r\nSuriname must remain green and smart.\r\nSuriname is very much aware of the fact that \r\nwhile we have solid advantages as a nation, we can \r\nonly survive and prosper by adapting to a world that is \r\nbecoming more and more interdependent. Having been \r\nblessed with oil reserves, trillions of cubic metres of \r\nfossil water reserves, along with hundreds of rivers, \r\nswamps, creeks, arable land and minerals, including \r\ngold, copper, granite, rare earth and more, Suriname \r\nhas become a focal point in view of the ever-growing \r\nscarcity of those commodities.\r\nIn order to maintain and enhance our political \r\nstability, we must deepen and widen our eco-commercial \r\nposition and be able to keep our country and people \r\nsafe from any outside intervention and interference. \r\nSuriname has engaged in a serious quest for integration \r\nwith its immediate neighbours — Guyana, France \r\nand Brazil — at a bilateral and, wherever possible, \r\ntripartite level. Suriname is also a devoted participant \r\nin the historic movement of regional integration that is \r\ngrowing in form and substance. We are active members \r\nof the Union of South American Nations, the secretariat \r\nof which will be based in Suriname as from July 2013.\r\nWe are committed to the creation of a Caribbean \r\nCommunity multinational corporation, giving a more \r\nmeaningful basis to the single market and economic \r\ngoals put in place since 2006. As one of the founding \r\nmembers of the Community of Latin American and \r\nCaribbean States, we continue to be dedicated to the \r\nintegration mechanism of the Americas, remaining \r\ncommitted to the principles and objectives of the \r\nOrganization of American States. \r\nAlthough our region is making enormous strides in \r\nfurthering democracy and development, we must draw \r\nthe attention of the international community to the lack \r\nof progress in assisting one of the most disadvantaged \r\ncountries in the Western Hemisphere, namely Haiti. \r\nWe call on the international community to honour its \r\npledges to assist the Government and people of Haiti in \r\ntheir efforts to rebuild their beloved country.\r\nFurthermore, our quest for integration will never \r\nbe complete if we continue to accept the isolation of our \r\nsister nation, Cuba, as a consequence of the unjustly \r\nimposed economic and trade embargo. Once again, \r\n14 12-52563\r\nA/67/PV.20\r\nto provide the necessary means to combat the serious \r\nconsequences of overconsumption, pollution and carbon \r\nemissions, which threaten to undo our achievements \r\naimed at protecting the environment and securing the \r\nwell-being of our peoples. We continue to expect the \r\nUnited Nations to spearhead the efforts for technical \r\nassistance and to advance continued dialogue.\r\nSuriname is deeply concerned with regard to the \r\nbasis on which countries in development are classified \r\nin the international financial institutional framework. \r\nSuch classifications, without due consultations, \r\nnegatively affect the type and level of assistance that \r\na country can receive from international financial \r\ninstitutions. We can only characterize those decisions \r\nas undemocratic and as a virtual punishment of \r\nour achievements in improving our socioeconomic \r\nsituation.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to solemnly declare that \r\nSuriname will always put its faith in multilateralism \r\nthrough its unwavering support for the principles \r\nand objectives enshrined in the Charter of the United \r\nNations.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Joseph Bandabla Dauda, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs and International Cooperation of the Republic \r\nof Sierra Leone.\r\nMr. Dauda (Sierra Leone): It is a distinct honour \r\nfor me to convey the sincere regrets of my President, \r\nMr. Ernest Bai Koroma, who, on account of unavoidable \r\ncircumstances, was unable to address the Assembly at \r\nits sixty-seventh session.\r\nI wish to join previous speakers in congratulating \r\nthe President on his election to direct the affairs of this \r\nsession and to assure him of my delegation’s fullest \r\nsupport and cooperation throughout his tenure. Allow \r\nme to commend his predecessor, Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz \r\nAl-Nasser, and to thank him for the skilful manner in \r\nwhich he efficiently conducted the affairs of the last \r\nsession. My profound appreciation also goes to the \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his tireless \r\nefforts in advancing the United Nations agenda to make \r\nthe world a peaceful and safer place for humankind.\r\nThe President’s choice of the theme “Bringing about \r\nadjustment or settlement of international disputes or \r\nsituations by peaceful means” is a timely wake-up call \r\nfor the United Nations to fully embrace the fundamental \r\nprinciple upon which our Organization was established. \r\nIndeed, only with such adjustments and the practical \r\nThe United Nations was built on the ashes of the \r\nSecond World War, and we pledged to save successive \r\ngenerations from the scourge of war. The peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes is the only avenue through \r\nwhich we can ensure that the planet will be saved from \r\nannihilation. That principled stand must be applied \r\nto all areas of conflict, whether the conflict is in the \r\nMiddle East, Africa, the Americas or anywhere else in \r\nthe world.\r\nThe target date for achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals is fast approaching. The year \r\n2015 will be a decisive year when world leaders will \r\ngather once again to assess the implementation of the \r\ncommitments made. We underscore the importance \r\nof creating well-being for all and providing greater \r\nopportunities for the vulnerable in our society by giving \r\nfull access to high-quality education at all levels and \r\naffordable and high-quality health care and services, as \r\nwell as realizing the commitments to gender equality \r\nand the empowerment of women.\r\nIt is necessary to increase the ability of women all \r\nover the world to bring about change, to ensure that \r\nthey can exist in an environment free from violence \r\nand conducive to their well-being, including access to \r\ndecent employment, services and housing.\r\nWe acknowledge the global burden and threat of \r\nnon-communicable diseases. In moving towards the \r\nfull implementation of the Political Declaration of the \r\nHigh-level Meeting of the General Assembly on the \r\nPrevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases \r\n(resolution 66/2, annex), as well as other commitments \r\nwe have made, we stress the importance of multisectoral \r\nactions, strengthening health systems, ensuring the \r\navailability of adequate and sustained resources, as \r\nwell as enhanced international cooperation through \r\neffective partnerships. Suriname has increased its \r\nefforts in the fight against those often overlooked silent \r\nkillers.\r\nMr. Touray (Sierra Leone), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nThe United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment concluded without an agreement on a \r\nclear commitment with regard to the financing of \r\nsustainable development. That is a very serious matter, \r\nconsidering the threat of climate change, among others, \r\nto a successful outcome of the efforts of small States \r\nlike Suriname to achieve sustainable development. The \r\ninternational community cannot abandon its obligation \r\n12-52563 15\r\nA/67/PV.20\r\nstability, sustainable peace, security and development. \r\nWe therefore remain strongly committed to the rule of \r\nlaw, respect for and the protection of human rights, gender \r\nequality, the empowerment of women, equal access to \r\njustice, fighting corruption with zero tolerance and \r\npursuing the internationally agreed development goals, \r\nincluding the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). \r\nTo that end, we are committed to ensuring participatory \r\ngovernance, conducting free, fair, transparent and \r\ncredible elections, and combating transnational \r\norganized crime in all its forms.\r\nSierra Leone therefore views with disappointment \r\nthe fact that the United Nations Conference on the Arms \r\nTrade Treaty ended without a negotiated consensus \r\non the treaty’s adoption. The Sierra Leone delegation \r\nbelieves that we must all earnestly endeavour to \r\nadopt a well-considered and balanced treaty with \r\nadequate provisions to effectively regulate the transfer \r\nof conventional weapons. If we continue to delay \r\nin that respect, we face the risk of their continuous \r\nuse in committing grave violations of national and \r\ninternational law, which has the potential to destabilize \r\npeace and security. We therefore urge Member States \r\nto consider our moral obligation to humankind as \r\nour key guiding principle and to sincerely commit to \r\ncontributing to the establishment of mechanisms to \r\nprevent the diversion of such weapons into the illicit \r\nmarket.\r\nIn three years, we will reach the target date of 2015 \r\nfor the implementation of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. For many Member States, particularly those \r\nof the global South, the voyage has been rough and, \r\nat times, turbulent. Worse still, the effects of the \r\nfood, fuel and financial crises that struck the global \r\ncommunity in 2008, as well as the impact of climate \r\nchange, conflicts and deadly pandemics, have further \r\nexacerbated the situation and compromised the \r\ndetermination and efforts of developing countries, \r\nespecially least developed countries (LDCs), to attain \r\nthe internationally agreed development goals, including \r\nthe MDGs. \r\nWe commend Brazil on successfully hosting \r\nthe United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (Rio+20). We also applaud our solidarity \r\nand f lexibility during the negotiation process, \r\nenabling the incorporation of LDCs and conflict-\r\naffected countries in the Rio+20 outcome document \r\n(resolution 66/288, annex). We look forward to a similar \r\nspirit of solidarity in defining sustainable development \r\nmanifestation of our collective commitment to peaceful \r\ncoexistence can we, as a global family, successfully \r\ntackle the myriad of prevailing global challenges. \r\nThey include poverty, hunger, the gross and systematic \r\nviolation of human rights, extremist fundamentalism, \r\nterrorism and transnational organized crime, as well as \r\nthe reconstruction and strengthening of fragile States \r\nand economies emerging from conflict. In that context, \r\nwe should remind ourselves that, a little over a year ago, \r\nthe Assembly adopted the landmark resolution 66/291 \r\non mediation that recognizes its growing usefulness \r\nas a means of preventing disputes from escalating into \r\nconflicts and as a cost-effective tool in the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes and the prevention of conflicts.\r\nAmid such security challenges and global economic \r\nuncertainties, the African continent continues to \r\nstrive hard to contain and to address the resurgence \r\nof conflicts in the region by peaceful means. At \r\nthe regional and subregional levels, the year under \r\nreview has been marred by sporadic terrorist strikes \r\nby extremists, leading to the extensive loss of life and \r\nmassive destruction of property, including coveted \r\nworld heritage sites, and the recent killing of the United \r\nStates Ambassador and three other Americans in \r\nLibya. Sierra Leone strongly condemns such brutal and \r\ncowardly acts and will continue to work closely with \r\nall partners, particularly within the framework of the \r\nMano River Union, the Economic Community of West \r\nAfrican States, the African Union (AU) and the United \r\nNations, in seeking a lasting solution to that scourge.\r\nUntil recently, the use of preventive diplomacy in \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security \r\nwas not used to its fullest potential by the United \r\nNations system. Rather, it was used more as a tool in \r\ncrisis management. I am, however, heartened by the \r\npresent impetus and would like to take this opportunity \r\nto commend the role of the Secretary-General, his \r\nSpecial Representatives and the crisis-management \r\noperations and missions around the world, as well as \r\nthe increasing role of the AU, subregional organizations \r\nand international contact groups, in tackling crisis \r\nsituations that have emerged globally in recent times.\r\nSierra Leone will continue to wholeheartedly \r\nembrace mediation and other conflict-prevention \r\ninitiatives as a key and indispensable tool in settling \r\ndisputes and in preventing and resolving conflicts. The \r\nlessons learned from our experience have enhanced our \r\nconviction in the core principles of democracy, human \r\nrights and good governance as prerequisites for political \r\n16 12-52563\r\nA/67/PV.20\r\ngoals that take on board the concerns of the most \r\nvulnerable members of the community of nations.\r\nDespite the onerous challenges facing the global \r\ncommunity, Sierra Leone has recorded significant \r\nprogress in strengthening its political and economic \r\ngovernance, including the improvement of its social \r\nindicators. We have made substantial progress in \r\nimplementing the President’s Agenda for Change \r\n(2008-2012), which covers the priorities of our national \r\ndevelopment aspirations, as well as key peacebuilding \r\npriorities, in tandem with the United Nations Joint \r\nVision for Sierra Leone.\r\nThe ongoing foreign direct investment in various \r\nsectors of the economy, notably the mining sector, is \r\nbrightening the prospects for the economy. Hopefully, \r\nit will place Sierra Leone among the fastest growing \r\neconomies in the world in the next few years.\r\nThe Agenda for Change continues to provide a \r\nstrong partnership link between Sierra Leone and \r\nthe United Nations, as well as other international \r\ndevelopment partners. To date, its implementation has \r\nhad a great impact on peacebuilding and on laying \r\nthe foundations for sustainable development and the \r\nconsolidation of peace. \r\nSierra Leone today is considered a showpiece of \r\nbest practices in donor coordination and a success story \r\nin peacebuilding. In that regard, we reiterate our call to \r\nthe international community to continue to invest in our \r\nsuccess in the spirit of the New Deal for Engagement \r\nin Fragile States, which was agreed in Busan, and \r\nthe need for special attention to be paid to countries \r\nemerging from conflict. The successor development \r\nframework to our Agenda for Change, entitled Agenda \r\nfor Prosperity, is anchored on the New Deal and is well \r\nunder way.\r\nIn its short existence to date, the peacebuilding \r\narchitecture has proven its worth as envisaged by the \r\nleaders at the 2005 World Summit, whose goal was \r\nto help countries emerging from conflict make an \r\nirreversible transition from war to sustainable peace. \r\nAs one of the first countries on the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission’s agenda, Sierra Leone has charted a \r\npath that can serve as a learning model for others. In \r\nthat regard, we strongly believe that strengthening \r\npeacebuilding will help to better safeguard countries \r\nfrom relapsing into conflict and sustain peace beyond \r\nthe life of peacekeeping missions. It will also help \r\nensure that the enormous investments that Member \r\nStates make in peacekeeping operations will achieve \r\ntheir intended result.\r\nSierra Leone continues to uphold the principles \r\nof interreligious tolerance, peaceful coexistence and \r\nrespect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. At \r\nthe national level, we have enhanced political stability \r\nby strengthening good governance institutions, giving \r\nthem sufficient leverage and latitude to deliver on their \r\nrespective statutory mandates. That arrangement has \r\nearned the Human Rights Commission of Sierra Leone \r\nan “A status” accreditation from the International \r\nCoordinating Committee of National Human Rights \r\nInstitutions. In that regard, we remain focused on our \r\nobligations to report to international treaty bodies and \r\nhave therefore submitted our initial report with regard \r\nto the International Covenant on Civil and Political \r\nRights, while work is well under way on our reports \r\nin compliance with the Convention against Torture \r\nand Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or \r\nPunishment and the African Charter on Human and \r\nPeoples’ Rights.\r\nAlong those lines, we recently established a national \r\ncommission for disabled persons, consistent with the \r\nrelevant provisions of the 2011 Disability Act, enacted \r\nthe 2012 Sexual Offences Act to address the specific \r\nissue of sexual violence against women and girls, and \r\npassed into law the 2012 bill on arms and ammunition \r\nto regulate gun ownership so as to ensure compliance \r\nwith the Economic Community of West African States \r\nConvention on Small Arms and Light Weapons. A \r\ngender-equality bill is also in process for enactment.\r\nI commend the support of the United Nations and \r\nthe international partners for the work of the Special \r\nCourt for Sierra Leone, which has made a number \r\nof critical contributions to the advancement of the \r\nrule of law at both the national and the international \r\nlevels. In particular, we compliment the Special Court \r\nfor bringing to trial perpetrators of crimes against \r\nhumanity and violations of international humanitarian \r\nlaw committed in Sierra Leone during the course of \r\nour 11-year conflict. Sierra Leone, the United Nations \r\nand the international community can be proud of the \r\nSpecial Court’s immense achievements. With our \r\ncontinued support, the Special Court can complete its \r\nremaining work.\r\nPresident Ernest Bai Koroma, in his address to \r\nthe General Assembly at the opening of its sixty-sixth \r\nsession, underscored the imperative of peacefully \r\n12-52563 17\r\nA/67/PV.20\r\nsettling disputes in Africa and the world at large \r\nby emphasizing that the world is so interconnected \r\nin trade, politics and the social spheres that a single \r\nnation’s upheaval could affect many other countries \r\n(see A/66/PV.20). It is against that background that \r\nwe, as a country, have continued to nurture closer \r\nties with our sister States in the Mano River basin in \r\norder to deepen cooperation and collaboration and \r\naddress issues of common concern, ranging from \r\ntransnational organized crime to border disputes. \r\nThe recent decision by the Presidents of Sierra Leone \r\nand her sister Republic of Guinea to demilitarize the \r\nYenga border area and establish a joint committee of \r\nthe two countries in order to ensure a final peaceful \r\nresolution of the Yenga problem is consistent with our \r\ncommitment to the peaceful resolution of international \r\ndisputes. Indeed, our steadfast commitment to global \r\npeace and security is evident in our participation in \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping missions in Lebanon, \r\nSomalia, the Sudan, South Sudan and Timor-Leste.\r\nThe 2012 presidential, parliamentary and \r\nlocal council elections scheduled to take place on \r\n17 November are barely 46 days away. With the support \r\nof our bilateral and multilateral partners, preparations \r\nare in full swing for the conduct of the third round of \r\nsuch elections within the decade following the end \r\nof our civil conflict. The Government is fully aware \r\nthat the conduct and outcome of the elections will be a \r\ncritical benchmark for assessing the level of our gains \r\nin the area of peace consolidation and democracy. The \r\nGovernment, relevant stakeholders and our development \r\npartners are therefore expressly determined to exert a \r\ncollective effort and use every available opportunity to \r\nensure that we put solid mechanisms in place for the \r\npeaceful conduct and achievement of transparent and \r\ncredible democratic elections. It is in that regard that, \r\nin May this year, all key stakeholders in the country \r\ncommitted themselves to a credible and violence-free \r\nprocess by signing the declaration on the 2012 \r\nElections. We have thus consolidated the electoral laws \r\nand established electoral offences courts to ensure the \r\nlegitimacy and credibility of the electoral process.\r\nAs Coordinator of the Committee of Ten Heads of \r\nState of the African Union for the reform of the United \r\nNations Security Council, I am pleased to report to the \r\nGeneral Assembly that, at the last AU Summit held in \r\nAddis Ababa, African heads of State reaffirmed their \r\nstrong commitment to the Ezulwini Consensus and \r\nthe Sirte Declaration containing the African common \r\nposition on the reform of the Security Council. To \r\nthat end, we are committed to building alliances \r\nin support of the African common position with \r\nvarious interest groups and Member States engaged \r\nin the intergovernmental negotiations, with a view to \r\nachieving reform of the Security Council as soon as \r\npossible. In that pursuit, member States of the African \r\nUnion have been called upon to include the issue of \r\nSecurity Council reform among the priorities in their \r\nforeign policies.\r\nIn that respect, Africa continues to engage in the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations with an open-door \r\npolicy aimed at correcting the historical injustice \r\nsuffered by Africa as the only continent not represented \r\nin the permanent-member category of the Council and at \r\nthe same time underrepresented in the non-permanent \r\ncategory. Since the Security Council remains at the \r\ncentre of global governance in the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security, it is both imperative \r\nand compelling that the international community \r\nrecognize the need described in the 2005 World \r\nSummit Outcome to make the Council more broadly \r\nrepresentative, efficient and transparent in order \r\nto enhance its effectiveness and the legitimacy and \r\nimplementation of its decisions, as well as the need to \r\ndemocratize the Council’s decision-making process and \r\ncorrect the lingering historical injustice inflicted upon \r\nthe continent. In that regard, we urge the wider United \r\nNations membership to work with Africa to urgently \r\naddress that injustice. Africa is not being unreasonable \r\nin its demand, and we all know that procrastination on \r\nthe matter has led to a travesty of justice and fair play, \r\nwhich undermines the dignity of our peoples.\r\nWe are determined at the national level to surmount \r\nall impediments on our way to development and to \r\ndelivering fully on all the projects in our “Agenda for \r\nChange”. We are confident that with sustained support \r\nfrom our bilateral and multilateral partners, we shall \r\npromote socioeconomic progress and provide a better \r\nstandard of living for our people in an atmosphere of \r\npeace and security. What we cannot afford at this time \r\nin our history is to fail in our duty and obligation to \r\nprovide peace, security and sustainable development \r\nfor our people.\r\nAt the global level, as we look at the work that \r\nlies before the sixty-seventh session, let us not lose \r\nsight of our shared obligation to ensure a peaceful \r\nand secure world by resolving our differences through \r\nconstructive dialogue and thus strengthen the existing \r\n18 12-52563\r\nA/67/PV.20\r\nthat promotes the development of that global village, a \r\nresponse that deserves the continued and wholehearted \r\nsupport of Governments and social organizations.  \r\nHuman history has always presented paradoxical \r\nor conflictive situations that have given rise to \r\nfrustration and feelings of injustice. Today, in a \r\ncontext of generalized interdependence, the disparity \r\nbetween wealth and poverty is more pronounced and \r\nunacceptable than ever. The disorderly expansion of \r\ntechnical and economic progress has intensified the gap \r\nbetween those who have the education and the means to \r\nadvance and those who lack both. The multiple legal \r\nand economic ties that unite nations are not sufficiently \r\njust and equitable, and they have become a conveyor \r\nbelt for the serious economic and financial crisis, which \r\nhas spread as quickly as a forest fire, affecting the \r\nmost vulnerable first. For some of the world’s people, \r\nresorting to crime and terrorism or waging war in the \r\nname of ideological, ethnic or cultural beliefs seems to \r\nbe the easiest, if not the only available way to escape \r\npoverty and become the heroes of the global village. \r\nSuch acts of violence are abetted by the perverse use \r\nof communications technology and by the excessively \r\neasy access to the tools of war.\r\nIf, in the 1990s, the state of legal and political \r\nprogress allowed us to believe that the danger of nuclear \r\nwar had receded, today the likelihood of regional \r\nconflicts with unpredictable outcomes has once again \r\ncreated a threatening atmosphere that should impel us \r\nto intensify our efforts to establish a truly constructive \r\ndialogue within the international community. \r\nDuring the period of the Cold War, the United \r\nNations was a meeting place and a point of discussion \r\nand balance between the opposing Powers. The \r\nOrganization managed to support the decolonization \r\nand independence of a large number of new States and \r\nto mitigate, and even at times resolve, regional, bilateral \r\nand civil conflicts in a context that was nonetheless \r\nmarked by severe ideological confrontation. At the \r\nsame time, United Nations agencies made an important \r\nintellectual, political and judicial contribution to the \r\nuniversal recognition of human rights and strengthened \r\ncooperation for development and regional economic \r\nintegration. Those advances constituted fundamental \r\nprogress towards strengthening the rule of law, which \r\nitself provides a favourable framework and is the best \r\nguarantor of human rights and peaceful international \r\ncooperation.  \r\nmediation mechanisms provided in the Charter and \r\ninstitutionalized within the United Nations system.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nArchbishop Dominique Mamberti, Secretary for \r\nRelations with States of the Holy See.\r\nArchibishop Mamberti (Holy See) (spoke in French): \r\nAs I congratulate the President on behalf of the Holy \r\nSee on his election to the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-seventh session, I have the honour \r\nof conveying warm greetings from His Holiness Pope \r\nBenedict XVI, who wishes for him and all members the \r\nblessings of all-powerful God.\r\nAt a time when the world is witnessing a disturbing \r\nincrease in bloody regional conflicts, the Holy See \r\nis particularly pleased to note the central theme \r\nthat has been chosen for the work of this session, \r\nnamely “Bringing about adjustment or settlement of \r\ninternational disputes or situations by peaceful means”. \r\nSince the establishment of the United Nations, a \r\ntight web of structured legal relationships has evolved, \r\ncovering virtually every aspect of the relations between \r\nStates and of life in the societies within States. In \r\nthat regard, the Charter of the United Nations, the \r\nmajor human rights treaties and the treaties governing \r\nhumanitarian law, along with the Vienna Conventions \r\non the law of treaties and diplomatic law and the key \r\nconventions on disarmament, may be viewed as a nearly \r\nuniversal legal corpus that promotes social relations \r\nbased on the law and that furthers durable peace.\r\nThat is a historically unprecedented development \r\nand a genuine achievement of the United Nations; it \r\nstands as a credit to the United Nations and certainly \r\nas one of its most successful achievements with respect \r\nto the aims enshrined in the Preamble and first Article \r\nof the Charter.  \r\nOver the course of the 67 years since the \r\nestablishment of the United Nations, the world \r\nhas undergone profound transformation.  Growing \r\ntechnical and economic interdependence, along \r\nwith the exponential development of new forms of \r\ncommunication, has led to the advent of what has \r\ncommonly been known, ever since the middle of the \r\ntwentieth century, as the global village: a diverse and \r\ncontinuously evolving village that has experienced \r\nastonishing development but that has also seen terrible \r\ninjustice. In that regard, the labour of legal construction \r\nundertaken by the United Nations is a worthy response \r\n12-52563 19\r\nA/67/PV.20\r\nout in the Preamble and Chapter I of the Charter. \r\nI note in particular saving succeeding generations \r\nfrom the scourge of war, practicing tolerance with \r\na spirit of good-neighbourliness, uniting strength \r\nfor the maintenance of peace and security, recourse \r\nto peaceful means to settle disputes, in conformity \r\nwith the principles of justice and international law, \r\nand cooperation to solve international problems of an \r\neconomic, social, cultural or humanitarian character \r\nand to promote and encourage respect for human rights \r\nand for fundamental freedoms. \r\nThe loss of trust in the value of dialogue and the \r\ntemptation to favour a priori one party in national \r\nor regional conflicts endanger respect for the legal \r\nmechanisms of the United Nations. However, the \r\npre-eminence of the values affirmed by the Charter \r\nshould lead to the adoption of all means possible to \r\nguarantee the protection of the most vulnerable, uphold \r\nthe rule of law and human rights, and safeguard ancient \r\ncultural and religious balances. \r\nMr. Gaspar Martins (Angola), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nThe urgency of the situation is all the more obvious \r\ngiven the events taking place in the Middle East, \r\nespecially in Syria. There can be no solution outside \r\nthe rules of international law and humanitarian law \r\nand implementation of mechanisms established by the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. All parties concerned \r\nmust not only do everything possible to facilitate the \r\nmission of the Joint Special Representative of the \r\nUnited Nations and the League of Arab States for Syria, \r\nbut also to guarantee humanitarian aid to populations \r\nin distress. The international community must unite its \r\nefforts to ensure that all parties concerned substitute \r\nnegotiation for recourse to arms and demand effective \r\nrespect for religious freedom, human rights and all \r\nfundamental freedoms. \r\nAs Pope Benedict XVI recently reiterated during \r\nhis trip to Lebanon, we should import ideas of peace \r\nand creativity, we should find ways of accepting each \r\nperson in his otherness, we should therefore make \r\nvisible before the world the respect that religions have \r\nfor one another, respect for man as a creature of God, \r\nand love of neighbour as fundamental to all religions. In \r\nthat way, using all possible means, including material \r\nassistance, we must help to bring an end to war and \r\nviolence so that all can help rebuild the peace. On his \r\nreturn from Lebanon, the Holy Father called on Arab \r\nAllow me here to welcome the Declaration \r\nof the High-level Meeting of the General \r\nAssembly on the Rule of Law at the National and \r\nInternational Levels (resolution 67/1), which was \r\nadopted at the beginning of this session. The 67 \r\nyears since the establishment of the United Nations \r\nalso include a distinguished history of humanitarian \r\ninterventions, peacekeeping operations and, more \r\nrecently, peacebuilding operations. Also of special \r\nimportance for the fate of humanity as a whole have been \r\nthe adoption of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons and the activities of the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency aimed at promoting universal \r\naccession to the Treaty, controlling the implementation \r\nof the Treaty and facilitating international cooperation \r\non the peaceful use of the atom.\r\nOver the past 20 years, the United Nations, together \r\nwith regional organizations, has made an essential \r\ncontribution to resolving a number of urgent situations, \r\nparticularly in Africa, by collaborating with the \r\nAfrican Union and other institutions of that continent. \r\nNonetheless, the current reality presents us with a \r\nUnited Nations system without the strength of unity and \r\npersuasion that could legitimately be expected of it; a \r\nsystem in which, unfortunately, power relationships are \r\nplayed out to the benefit of specific strategic interests.\r\nYet the possibilities that emerged at the end of the \r\nCold War seemed to portend a possible strengthening \r\nof the institutional and political presence of the \r\nUnited Nations in the service of world’s most critical \r\nchallenges, such as climate change and the preservation \r\nof the environment. How is it possible that, despite \r\nuniversal adhesion to the Charter of the United Nations \r\nand the essential treaties, we are still unable to establish \r\na just and true form of global governance?  \r\nThe Holy See would like to offer a moral answer \r\nto that question by calling attention to the importance \r\nof the values that, of necessity, underlie all human \r\nsocieties. Indeed, before engaging in political or \r\ntechnical considerations, it is important to ask whether \r\nthe crises currently convulsing the planet are linked to \r\na crisis of trust in the collective values enshrined in \r\nthe very Charter of the United Nations. Moreover, the \r\nquestion arises whether the crises aff licting the planet \r\nare linked to a serious anthropological crisis, which \r\nis to say the lack of a shared understanding of what it \r\nmeans to be human. \r\nToday we are witnessing a weakening in the \r\npractical reach of the purposes and principles set \r\n20 12-52563\r\nA/67/PV.20\r\nthe lack of basic health care and abject poverty, as well \r\nas of vast populations living in inhuman conditions, \r\ndisplaced populations and refugees, among whom are \r\nthousands of children. \r\nGiven the difficulty of finding common solutions \r\nthat respect the principles of self-determination, \r\nindependence, and the equality of States and the right \r\nof peoples, the anthropological crisis of which I spoke \r\nhas emerged, that is, a lack of conviction in the supreme \r\ndignity of every individual, even when they have just \r\nbeen conceived or are in a vegetative or terminal state. \r\nIt is an illusion to want to create true harmony \r\namong peoples, to guarantee peaceful coexistence \r\nand real cooperation between States if we confine \r\nourselves to a vision of mankind that — without in \r\ntheory denying the importance of the dignity and \r\nfundamental rights of the individual — consigns the \r\nprofound dimension of the person and his uniqueness \r\nto the rank of secondary factors, and insists on vague \r\ncollective concepts that reduce the individual to the \r\nsimple category of consumer or agent of production in \r\nthe market. A human being is not a mere number in \r\nthe masses of the global population. And the masses of \r\nthe global population cannot be viewed coldly or with \r\nsuspicion as a danger threatening the environmental and \r\nsocial balances. We are talking about  men and women, \r\neach with dignity and rights. Ideological visions that \r\ndo not take that into account lead irreparably to social \r\ndisintegration and conflict.\r\nIn that sense, we must reject attempts to view the \r\nMillennium Development Goals and the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda, as well as the interpretation of \r\nhuman rights treaties, on the basis of a limited and \r\nrelativist vision of humankind that, cleverly using \r\nambiguous expressions, threatens the right to life and \r\npresents a deconstruction of the family model based on \r\nthe union of a man and a woman and oriented towards \r\nprocreation and the education of children. In the end, \r\nthose attempts risk the irremediable weakening of the \r\ncredibility and legitimacy of the Organization as a \r\nuniversal tool for sustainable cooperation and peace. \r\nIt is of the first importance to provide an effective \r\nsolution to the open debate on the reform and \r\nimprovement of the functioning of United Nations \r\norgans in order to revitalize its ability to anticipate \r\nconflicts and resolve them peacefully. However, that \r\nwill be possible only with a constantly renewed effort \r\nto return to the founding vision of the Organization. \r\ncountries, as brothers, to propose workable solutions \r\nthat respect the dignity, the rights and the religion of \r\nevery individual. Those who wish to build peace must \r\ncease to see in the other an evil to be eliminated. It is \r\nnot easy to see in the other a person to be respected and \r\nloved, and yet that is necessary if one desires to build \r\npeace, if one desires fraternity.\r\nMoreover, only an international community \r\nstrongly rooted in values that genuinely uphold human \r\ndignity can provide viable solutions to the new types \r\nof conflict perpetrated by transnational groups, \r\nwhich spread a pseudo-religious hegemonic ideology \r\ncontemptuous of individual rights and civil peace. We \r\nthink of the instability and the recent terrorist attacks \r\nin some countries of Africa and Asia, or the collusion \r\nbetween drug trafficking and terrorism in other regions \r\nof the world. \r\nBeyond even situations of conflict, today all \r\nStates, rich and poor, see their stability threatened by \r\nthe economic crisis to which no true and sustainable \r\nsolution has been found to date. Just a few years \r\nago international discussions were essentially about \r\npotential ways to share the resources of the rich \r\ncountries, where well-being appeared to be firmly \r\nestablished, or about the legitimate recognition of \r\nthe rights of developing countries. The debate was \r\nabout finding the right balance between free trade \r\nand financial assistance; the transfer of know-how, \r\ntechnologies and direct aid to the poorest populations; \r\nthe clash of ideas about the foreign debt of the poorest \r\ncountries; the role of the World Trade Organization and \r\nits connections to the United Nations; the reform of \r\nmultilateral financial institutions; and comprehensive \r\naccess to essential drugs. \r\nThat unavoidable debate must be continued, even \r\nif today it is overshadowed and made more complex by \r\nthe issues related to financial stability, whose impact is \r\nglobal. In fact, we can all see that the financial stability \r\nof the most developed societies has been seriously \r\nendangered, especially because of shortsighted \r\neconomic policies often based only on maximizing \r\nshort-term profits. \r\nThe threat of collapse of financial systems in \r\neconomies that were until now the most prosperous \r\nhas serious consequences for social cohesion. It has led \r\nto the resurgence of old fantasies such as exacerbated \r\nnationalism, populism and xenophobia. Add to that the \r\ntragedy of millions of people weighed down by hunger, \r\n12-52563 21\r\nA/67/PV.20\r\nThe President took the Chair.\r\nIt is in that spirit that the Holy See wishes to offer \r\nits contribution to the present session of the General \r\nAssembly, aligning itself with the wish you expressed in \r\nyour inaugural address, Mr. President, that all Member \r\nStates, which share the responsibility to implement the \r\nprinciples and objectives of the Organization, would \r\nrenew their commitment to resolve disputes by peaceful \r\ndialogue and not by resorting to confrontation. Only \r\nin that way will the aspirations and hopes of all be \r\nachieved. Only in that way can the United Nations play \r\nits indispensable role in peace and development.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Pak Kil Yon, Vice-Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.\r\nMr. Pak Kil Yon (Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea) (spoke in Korean; English interpretation provided \r\nby the delegation):  Allow me to congratulate you, Sir, \r\non your election to preside over the General Assembly \r\nat its sixty-seventh session. I expect your proficient \r\nstewardship will guide the Assembly to success.\r\nAt the outset, I would like to express our profound \r\ngratitude to the heads of State and Government and \r\npeoples of the States Members of the United Nations, \r\nthe Secretary-General, the President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-sixth session, representatives \r\nof United Nations bodies and of many countries for \r\ndeep condolences they extended to us at the demise in \r\nDecember last year of the great leader of our people, \r\nKim Jong Il. General Kim Jong Il devoted tireless \r\nefforts until the last moment of his life to firmly \r\nsafeguarding the dignity and sovereignty of our country \r\nand the prosperity and happiness of its people, as well \r\nas to accomplishing the cause of global independence \r\nand world peace and stability. \r\nToday, having hailed dear respected Marshal Kim \r\nJong Un as the Supreme Leader of the Party, State and \r\nArmy, our people are striving to build a prosperous \r\nand powerful socialist State. Dear respected Marshal \r\nKim Jong Un safeguards the peace and stability of the \r\nKorean peninsula by carrying forward the Songun \r\npolicy of General Kim Jong Il in good faith. He wisely \r\nleads the general advance march for developing our \r\neconomy, improving people’s livelihood, and devising \r\na development strategy of our own style and innovative \r\nmethods with his insight into the world.\r\nSustainable peace will not be possible without each and \r\nevery one of us engaging in a constructive dialogue \r\ndirected toward achieving dignified and decent living \r\nconditions for all human beings. \r\nThat can be done only through a shared belief with \r\nregard to fundamental values that guarantee respect \r\nfor human life. In that regard, respect for religious \r\nfreedom is essential, within national public life as well \r\nas internationally. Reason tells us that each person has \r\ntranscendental dignity, which brings with it freedom \r\nto determine one’s own ultimate destiny and which \r\nnational and international authorities, as well as social \r\nmechanisms, must fully respect. That is why actions \r\nby Governments and international organizations must \r\nnecessarily strive to promote comprehensive human \r\ndevelopment, creating legal, economic and social \r\nconditions that genuinely reflect the importance of \r\nhuman dignity and its transcendental dimension, both \r\nat the personal level and collectively. \r\nReligion should not be thought of other than as \r\na factor of peace and progress, a living force for the \r\nwell-being of all. Indeed, it leads human beings to \r\novercome every egotistical interest and to devote their \r\nenergies to the service of others, including for peace \r\namong peoples. That is why all forms of fanaticism \r\nand exclusivism and all acts of violence towards \r\none’s neighbour are an exploitation of and a deviation \r\nfrom religion. Moreover, history has shown that a \r\nbiased concept of secularism, or tolerance that would \r\nlimit religious matters to the private sphere, can only \r\nundermine the bases for peaceful coexistence, at both \r\nthe national and international levels. \r\nThe Holy See has been involved in international \r\ncooperation activities since they were first given \r\ninstitutional structure. We established our Permanent \r\nMission to the United Nations in New York in 1964. The \r\nreason for its presence as a subject of international law in \r\nthis intergovernmental institution is first of all its desire \r\nto offer to the international community a transcendent \r\nview of life and social relations, recalling in particular \r\nthe dignity of the individual and his fundamental \r\nrights, in the first place the right to religious freedom. \r\nThe international community has always welcomed \r\nthis contribution, which allows common initiatives \r\nto put back into a profound perspective, in which the \r\nunderlying unity of the human family and the call to \r\nthe generosity of individuals and peoples must always \r\nbe reaffirmed.\r\n22 12-52563\r\nA/67/PV.20\r\nintegrity of Syria and the right to self-determination \r\nand existence of Palestine should be rejected.\r\nDemocratizing the United Nations and, in \r\nparticular, strengthening the authority of the General \r\nAssembly are urgent issues for enhancing the central \r\nrole of the United Nations in international relations. \r\nThe Assembly resolution adopted long ago on \r\ndismantling the so-called United Nations Command \r\nstationed in South Korea and the resolution adopted \r\nannually on ending the United States blockade against \r\nCuba remain unimplemented. These are typical \r\nexamples that show the need to strengthen the authority \r\nof the General Assembly.\r\nIt is quite natural for the General Assembly, which \r\nrepresents the general will of all Member States, to \r\nsupervise the overall activities of the Organization. In \r\nparticular, it should be given the authority to undertake \r\nfinal review of Security Council resolutions related to \r\npeace and security, such as sanctions and use of force. \r\nThe abuse of the Security Council as a tool for pursuing \r\nstrategic interests by a handful of countries should \r\nnever be overlooked. Last April, the United States took \r\nissue with our legitimate and peaceful space launch, \r\nwhich followed universal international law, and forced \r\nthe Council to adopt an unjust statement. That alone \r\nshows how the Council has been abused.\r\nSecurity Council reform, which is at the core of \r\noverall United Nations reform, is a matter that should \r\nno longer be delayed. It should be carried out in a \r\nmanner that guarantees responsibility, transparency, \r\nimpartiality and objectivity in its activities and ensures \r\nfull representation of developing countries in its \r\ncomposition.\r\nOther United Nations bodies in which double \r\nstandards and the theory of force are extremely evident \r\nare the Third Committee of the General Assembly and \r\nthe Human Rights Council. Politicization, selectivity \r\nand double standards in deliberations on human rights \r\nshould be put to an end. We should never allow the \r\ncontinuation of the practice whereby human rights \r\nsituations of selected countries are either called into \r\nquestion or simply ignored in accordance with the \r\npolitical purposes and interests of the West and the \r\nWestern standard values.\r\nIn the field of sustainable development, which \r\nis now one of the three targets set by the United \r\nNations, the agreement reached in the United Nations \r\nOur dear respected Marshal Kim Jong Un is firmly \r\ndetermined to make our people, who have overcome \r\nmanifold hardships, enjoy a happy life to their heart’s \r\ncontent in a prosperous socialist State. Dear respected \r\nMarshal Kim Jong Un is implementing independent \r\nforeign policy and opening up a new chapter in the \r\ndevelopment of relations with other countries that are \r\nfriendly to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, \r\nnot bound by the past. Our people are following dear \r\nrespected Marshal Kim Jong Un with absolute trust in \r\nhim and are vigorously advancing to the final victory \r\nwith full conviction in and optimism about the future, \r\nsingle-heartedly united behind him.\r\nThe founding of the United Nations in the last \r\ncentury gave hope to mankind following a tragic \r\nworld war — hope of achieving common prosperity \r\nby ensuring peace and security and developing \r\ncooperation among States based on the principle of \r\nsovereign equality. Yet today, after the first decade \r\nof the new century, that desire of the mankind has yet \r\nto be achieved. At present in international relations, \r\nhigh-handedness and arbitrariness are becoming ever \r\nmore undisguised, and the use of force and acts of \r\nState terrorism aimed at infringing on sovereignty, \r\ninterference in internal affairs and effecting regime \r\nchange are being perpetrated under such pretexts as \r\nnon-proliferation and humanitarian intervention.\r\nWe are now witnessing the resurrection of the \r\noutdated international relations of the first half of the \r\ntwentieth century, when a handful of great Powers \r\ndominated the world by resorting to the use of force. \r\nThis resurrection tarnishes the credibility of the United \r\nNations, whose mandate is to ensure global peace and \r\nsecurity.\r\nThe fact that the theme “Bringing about adjustment \r\nor settlement of international disputes or situations by \r\npeaceful means” was chosen for the current session \r\nshows the seriousness of the current international \r\nsituation. The most serious issue in the international \r\narena at present is a f lagrant violation of the principles \r\nof respect for sovereignty and equality. Unless the \r\nhigh-handedness and arbitrariness of certain countries \r\nare thoroughly eliminated, it will be hard to say that \r\nthe United Nations is fulfilling its role and function as \r\na centre for coordinating cooperative relations between \r\nStates based on the principle of sovereign equality as \r\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nThe unjustifiable interference, pressure and use \r\nof force that violate the sovereignty and territorial \r\n12-52563 23\r\nA/67/PV.20\r\nof Korea that have prevented the continued military \r\nprovocations of the United States from turning into all-\r\nout war on the Korean peninsula. However, this does \r\nnot mean that the patience of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea is inexhaustible. Our people value \r\npeace and stability in pursuing their overall goal of \r\nbuilding a prosperous and powerful State. But the \r\ndignity of our nation and the sovereignty of our country \r\nare even more valuable.\r\nOur principled stand is based on reacting to an \r\naggressor’s reckless provocations with an immediate, \r\ncorresponding strike in defence of our nation’s dignity \r\nand sovereignty, and to respond to a war of aggression \r\nwith a just war of reunification of the country. The \r\nrealities of the situation on the Korean peninsula \r\nprove that we have been absolutely right to have built \r\na military deterrent capacity for our self-defence, by \r\ntightening our belts in order to pursue the path of \r\nSongun and independence. Our military deterrent is a \r\nmighty weapon that defends the country’s sovereignty \r\nand a powerful means of preventing war on the Korean \r\npeninsula, as well as a strong guarantee that enables \r\nus to focus our efforts on economic construction and \r\nimproving people’s livelihoods.\r\nThe only way to prevent war and ensure lasting \r\npeace on the Korean peninsula is to put an end to \r\nthe hostile policy of the United States towards the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea. That policy \r\nis the root cause that has made the Korean peninsula \r\nthe world’s most dangerous hotspot, and it is the chief \r\nobstacle to lasting peace and security. The nuclear \r\nissue on the Korean peninsula is also a product of that \r\npolicy. None of these problems, including the Korean \r\npeninsula nuclear issue, can be resolved without first \r\nending the hostile policy of the United States, which \r\nviews the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea as an \r\nenemy target and tries to stif le it at any cost. That is the \r\nessence of the process of our dialogue with the United \r\nStates and a lesson we have drawn from practical \r\nexperience.\r\nSince the turn of the new century, North-South \r\nsummit meetings have been held twice, amid the joyful \r\nenthusiasm of all our fellow countrymen. They resulted \r\nin the adoption of the 15 June North-South Joint \r\nDeclaration and the 4 October Declaration, and created \r\nan atmosphere in which the desire for reconciliation, \r\ncooperation and reunification between North and South \r\nreached a peak. Soon after taking office, however, the \r\nnew South Korean authorities annulled all inter-Korean \r\nConference on Sustainable Development, held last June \r\nin Rio de Janeiro, should be implemented. Practical \r\nmeasures should be taken to solve such issues as \r\nestablishing fair international economic and trade \r\nrelations, fulfilling official development assistance \r\ncommitments, transferring environmentally clean \r\ntechnologies to developing countries and strengthening \r\nfinancial support.\r\nToday, due to the ongoing hostile policy of \r\nthe United States towards the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea, a vicious cycle of confrontation \r\nand aggravation of tension continues to aff lict the \r\nKorean peninsula, which has become the world’s most \r\ndangerous hotspot, a place where a spark could set off \r\na thermonuclear war. At the root of that hostile policy, \r\nwhich has lasted for more than half a century, towards \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea lies the \r\nintention of the United States to destroy the ideas and \r\nsystem our people have chosen and to occupy the entire \r\nKorean peninsula, in order to use it as a stepping stone \r\nin realizing its strategy of dominating all of Asia.\r\nSince the day the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea was founded, the United States has designated it \r\nan enemy and refused to recognize its sovereignty. Since \r\nthen, it has pursued every kind of sanction, pressure and \r\nmilitary provocation against the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea for more than half a century. Its \r\nhostile policy is most deeply rooted in the military field. \r\nNo precedent can be found in modern history for the \r\nsituation whereby the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea and the United States have continued as warring \r\nparties after hostilities ended and for more than 60 \r\nyears altogether.\r\nWith a view to eliminating the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea by force, the United States has \r\nalready finalized various war scenarios, and is waiting \r\nfor a chance to implement them, as it has outlined in a \r\ncontingency plan to impose military rule after a military \r\ninvasion. In accordance with those plans for military \r\noperations, the United States has staged various joint \r\nmilitary exercises under different names in and around \r\nthe Korean peninsula for several decades. A typical \r\nexample was a combined military exercise named Ulji \r\nFreedom Guardian, staged at the end of last August and \r\ninvolving huge numbers of armed forces, which pushed \r\nthe situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of \r\nwar.\r\nIt is only the patience and military deterrent self-\r\ndefence capacity of the Democratic People’s Republic \r\n24 12-52563\r\nA/67/PV.20\r\nhumanism, multilateralism and the equality of States \r\nbefore the law. Since then, the great majority of \r\ncountries have fought to see those principles complied \r\nwith, but there have also been countries whose power \r\nhas wrongfully enabled them  to fail to live up to the \r\nprinciples and to their obligations within the system.\r\nThe world has changed substantially since the \r\nroad map for the United Nations was designed, and its \r\nfunctions must adapt to the new demands of international \r\nrelations, characterized by exchanges of information \r\nand communications and by interdependent economies. \r\nWe believe the time has come to end the illegitimate \r\npolitical exploitation of United Nations bodies by \r\ncertain Powers, which continue to exert political and \r\neconomic pressure and even to intervene militarily \r\nin sovereign States whose Governments criticize the \r\ninternational status quo or focus on different ideologies \r\nfrom those promoted by some Powers, or whose public \r\npolicies are opposed to the economic interests of large \r\ntransnational companies. Such pressure delegitimizes \r\nthe system and distorts multilateralism itself.\r\nIn the five years of President Rafael Correa’s \r\nGovernment, Ecuador has regained sovereignty in \r\ndecision-making on its internal and international \r\npolicies, pursuing decisions that promote a horizontal \r\nrelationship between countries with the same rights and \r\nobligations. In those five years Ecuador has supported \r\npeace. That is why we have expressed our concern \r\nabout the terrible consequences for human beings that \r\nresult from military interventions conducted by the \r\nPowers, and why we are calling loudly for dialogue \r\nand for respect for human rights and the people’s self-\r\ndetermination in all countries in conflict. We have \r\nhad enough of geopolitical visions that are imposed by \r\nforce, destroying human rights. In that regard, Ecuador \r\nwelcomes with great hope and enthusiasm the dialogue \r\nprocess in the sister Republic of Colombia, which is \r\nthe bravest step that the Government of that fraternal \r\ncountry could have taken.\r\nToday the world is experiencing constant changes \r\nin the distribution of power. New regional Powers have \r\nemerged in the past 20 years and have begun to play \r\na decisive role in international politics and security. \r\nRussia, China, India, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, \r\nArgentina, Indonesia, Venezuela and the developing \r\nworld, in general, are now the drivers of the global \r\neconomy. It is therefore a political imperative that \r\nmultilateralism be strengthened and promoted with \r\nregard to respect and equality among States. \r\nagreements, including the 15 June North-South Joint \r\nDeclaration and the 4 October Declaration, which had \r\nbeen warmly welcomed and were fully supported by the \r\nentire Korean nation and the international community, \r\nincluding the United Nations. Furthermore, the \r\nconfrontation between fellow countrymen and systems \r\nhave caused an extreme deterioration in inter-Korean \r\nrelations. The South Korean authorities rubbed salt in \r\nthe wounds of our people, who had suffered such a huge \r\nnational loss, even insulting our supreme dignity with \r\nacts of political terrorism, and leaving inter-Korean \r\nrelations totally bankrupt. History will bring them to \r\njustice.\r\nThe Government of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea will join hands with anyone who \r\ntruly desires the country’s reunification and national \r\nreconciliation and prosperity. With responsibility and \r\npatience, and relying on the nation’s concerted efforts, \r\nit is making every effort to realize the historic cause \r\nof national reunification by preventing interference by \r\noutside forces and any attempt by anti-reunification \r\nforces to achieve permanent national division.\r\nThe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea will \r\ncontinue to further strengthen and develop the relations \r\nof friendship and cooperation with all countries that \r\nrespect its sovereignty, pursuant to the principles \r\nof independence, peace and friendship on which its \r\nforeign policy is based, and will actively cooperate with \r\nthe efforts of United Nations Member States to secure \r\nworld peace and stability and to achieve sustainable \r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Marco Albuja, Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nand Political Integration of Ecuador.\r\nMr. Albuja (Ecuador) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nMr. President, I would like to extend to you the \r\ncongratulations of the Government of Ecuador on your \r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-seventh session, for which we will provide \r\nwhatever support you need to help achieve the \r\ninternational agenda’s commitments, especially those \r\nthat have to do with revitalization of the Assembly.\r\nWe are participating in this important forum with \r\nthe clear purpose of sharing our ideas and proposals for \r\nthe international system that governs us. We are well \r\naware that the United Nations system was conceived \r\nin the middle of the last century and that its structure \r\nis based on, among other things, the principles of \r\n12-52563 25\r\nA/67/PV.20\r\nare a small group of countries that decide the system’s \r\nfuture and other measures that affect the remaining \r\ncountries. The new system would require all countries, \r\nas equals, to be equally represented in decision-making \r\nthat affected the international system. It should not \r\nallow non-compliance with international standards by \r\nsome States, but must rather demand strict adherence \r\nto international law and full respect for international \r\njudicial authority as the only way of promoting peaceful \r\ncoexistence among nations.\r\nEcuador supports the comprehensive reform of the \r\nUnited Nations system and the democratization of the \r\ninternational decision-making bodies. We advocate \r\na comprehensive reform of the Security Council that \r\nincludes decisions on membership categories, the veto \r\nissue, regional representation, the size of an expanded \r\nSecurity Council and its working methods, and its \r\nrelationship with the General Assembly — in other \r\nwords, a comprehensive change in its composition \r\nand operation. The idea is to make the Council \r\nrepresentative, democratic and effective to enable \r\nthe international community to have an appropriate \r\ncollective security system. We believe that we must \r\nwork on that proposal, study it, discuss it and decide \r\non it together.\r\nOur country also calls for a comprehensive \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly. We propose \r\nthat its role as the main depositary of global sovereignty \r\nbe fully recognized within the United Nations system \r\nsince it is only there that all members are represented. \r\nThe General Assembly should therefore have the \r\nability to discuss and take binding decisions on all \r\nsignificant issues on the international agenda, including \r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nAn example of the imbalance and lack of democracy \r\nof the current United Nations system that clearly reflects \r\nthe urgent need for its reform is the situation in which \r\nthe abhorrent blockade on the sisterly Republic of Cuba \r\ncontinues because an economic and military Power is \r\nable to impose its will and political view despite the \r\ncontrary decision of 186 countries. Then again, the \r\nUnited States cannot continue to include Cuba on its \r\nspurious list of countries that sponsor terrorism simply \r\nbecause of an ideological unwillingness to accept that \r\nthe island has survived its forced isolation. Arbitrariness \r\nhas played a great part in that issue.\r\nCuba has declared that its territory has never been \r\nused nor ever will be used to organize, finance or \r\ncarry out terrorist acts against any country, including \r\nIt is important to point out that Latin American \r\ncountries committed to multilateralism, in response \r\nto unilateral actions that undermine international \r\nstability, have established regional institutions, such \r\nas the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our \r\nAmerica — Peoples’ Trade Agreement (ALBA), the \r\nUnion of South American Nations (UNASUR) and the \r\nCommunity of Latin American and Caribbean States. \r\nSuch bodies are restoring the principle of universal \r\nrepresentation in global governance and endowing it with \r\nnew characteristics so as to adjust it to today’s political \r\nand social reality. However, while such countries and \r\norganizations seek to keep the institution of inter-State \r\nwork alive, the continuing unilateral actions of certain \r\nPowers without consultation jeopardize the ability of \r\nmultilateral bodies to provide legitimate and valid \r\nresponses to international needs and problems.\r\nIn that context, Ecuador believes that the \r\nweakening of the decision-making system in the United \r\nNations undermines international law. Open dialogue \r\nis therefore needed in order to effectively reform our \r\nOrganization. We believe that it is time to begin a \r\nstructural reform of the United Nations that makes it \r\nmore democratic and up to date and that prevents the \r\npolitical and illegal use of its bodies. The system will \r\nbe truly democratic, as it claims to be, when everyone \r\naccepts that each country has a vote and that the \r\nmajority decides in a democratic, free and sovereign \r\nway, without a small group of States that represents \r\n2.5 per cent of the Organization’s membership being \r\nable to veto the remaining 97.5 per cent.\r\nWe must of course restore the fundamental principles \r\nof the United Nations, namely, the legal equality of \r\nStates, international social justice, unconditional \r\nrespect for international law, the protection and defence \r\nof all human rights, cooperation and the promotion \r\nof the mutual interests of nations, respect for the \r\nsovereignty of States, the free self-determination of \r\npeoples, non-intervention in the internal affairs of \r\nother States, the elimination of wars of aggression and \r\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes through dialogue, \r\nwithout recourse to the threat or, worse still, the use of \r\nforce. But, above all, we must restore the principle of \r\ncollective action. As a result, we must give it values, \r\nsuch as democracy, universality and supranationality. \r\nIn order to be effective and efficient in its work \r\nto maintain international peace and stability, the new \r\nmultilateralism should not uphold the veto power or \r\nthe existence of an exclusive club, whose members \r\n26 12-52563\r\nA/67/PV.20\r\nStates Ambassador to Libya, Christopher Stevens. \r\nEcuador stands in solidarity with the people of the \r\nUnited States and reaffirms its condemnation of those \r\nviolent acts against United States personnel in Libya \r\nand Egypt. Once again, we declare our respect for the \r\ninviolability of the premises of diplomatic missions.\r\nMy country believes that it is essential for \r\ninternational organizations to support and promote the \r\nobservance and development of all human rights. That \r\nshould be their ultimate objective, not just a politically \r\ncorrect way to make a discussion attractive or to justify \r\nimplementing a geopolitical outlook on different \r\ncultural realities. Human rights are a principle that is \r\nlived every day and that is constantly developed and \r\nupheld. It is a principle including all of humankind \r\nwith no exception, no discrimination, no categories and \r\nno prioritization. The principle admits no reservations \r\nor double standards. It is either completely defended \r\nand we submit to it, or it is rejected. But conditioned, \r\npartial compliance is not admissible. We are, of course, \r\nspeaking of the progressive development of international \r\nand national instruments governing human rights and \r\nthe legal international bodies that ensure compliance \r\nwith those instruments.\r\nTo write on paper that all men and women around \r\nthe world are equal without applying it in practice is \r\nnothing but hypocrisy. Human rights, as a whole, can \r\nbe summarized in the right to life. The question is: \r\nhow many thousands of human beings must continue \r\nto be sacrificed in the name of the abstract principle \r\nwithout understanding, without really feeling what the \r\nconcept is. When will humanity ask, for example, if \r\nthe defence of democracy in its Western version or the \r\naccumulation of transnational capital and the expansion \r\nof organized crime constitute sufficient justification \r\nfor the sacrifice of tens of thousands of human lives or \r\nfor the destruction of the planet.\r\nIn order to guarantee the rights of human beings, \r\ndeepen their social and economic development, and \r\nachieve the harmony of nature while being fully \r\nresponsible towards all generations, Ecuador has \r\nchanged some traditional policies since the adoption \r\nof the new Ecuadorian Constitution in 2008. We \r\nunderstand that we must overcome the archaic concept \r\nthat the rule of law consists of laws carved in stone \r\nthat were approved at some time in history but are \r\nobsolete and out of date today. The law cannot be \r\nabstract, because in essence it is a living thing needed \r\nto give security to human beings, and it cannot be \r\nthe United States. Similarly, the prominent former \r\nUnited States President, Jimmy Carter, has stated that \r\nthe role of Havana as a guarantor in the peace talks \r\nbetween the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de \r\nColombia and the Colombian Government refutes any \r\nargument about the need for Cuba to remain on that \r\nlist. The former President, whom we consider a friend \r\nof the Latin American cause, said that a more sincere \r\ndialogue could take place between the two countries if \r\nthe United States were to remove Cuba from its list of \r\nState sponsors of terrorism. We share and support that \r\nview.\r\nConsistent with Ecuador’s recognition of the \r\nPalestinian State within the 1967 borders and with \r\nEast Jerusalem as its capital, my country supports \r\nthe inclusion of Palestine as a full Member of the \r\nOrganization. Likewise, Ecuador reiterates its support \r\nfor the historic rights of the Argentine Republic over \r\nthe Malvinas Islands. The specific and anachronistic \r\nsituation of those Islands should pave the way for \r\nrenewed direct negotiations with the United Kingdom, \r\nas called for by Argentina. That appeal has been \r\nreiterated in several resolutions of the relevant United \r\nNations bodies.\r\nFor Ecuador, it is essential that disputes, including \r\nthose related to borders, be resolved peacefully. \r\nEcuador has successfully achieved that.\r\nEcuador has also worked to strengthen the \r\nfundamental institutions of international law, such as \r\nthe inviolability of diplomatic missions, as provided \r\nfor in the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic \r\nRelations. I wish to recall that, a few weeks ago, the \r\nGovernment of Ecuador had an unexpected diplomatic \r\ndispute with the Government of the United Kingdom \r\non exactly that issue. In response, Ecuador advocated \r\nthat various multilateral forums adopt resolutions \r\naffirming that principle of international law. We must \r\nsay with deep gratitude that Ecuador received the \r\nresolute support of the Governments of States members \r\nof UNASUR, ALBA and the Organization of American \r\nStates and of other Governments, such as that of \r\nRussia, condemning any attempt at forced entry into or \r\nviolation of diplomatic premises. \r\nThe Government of Ecuador accordingly \r\ncondemned the terrible events of 11 September, when \r\nthe United States diplomatic mission and consulate in \r\nCairo and Benghazi were attacked by armed groups \r\nwith a tragic loss of life, including that of the United \r\n12-52563 27\r\nA/67/PV.20\r\nplace, with full respect for their ancestral culture and \r\ntheir traditions, customs, beliefs and political views.\r\nWe are also one of the countries that has \r\nstrengthened gender equality, the development of the \r\nrights of women, and the application of affirmative \r\naction measures that cut across public policies in all \r\nthe functions of our Government. However, those \r\nsuccessful changes have led to a reaction from sectors \r\nof traditional power, both inside and outside Ecuador. \r\nJust yesterday, we noted the second anniversary of an \r\nattempted coup d’état and assassination. But things \r\nhave changed. The empowerment of citizens fully \r\nidentified with the Government has made it possible to \r\novercome this year’s crisis as well as an international \r\nmedia campaign of criticism and misinformation on the \r\nactivities and achievements of our country.\r\nI would like to highlight from this rostrum that \r\nEcuador is the first country in the world to have \r\nrecognized the rights of nature in its Constitution. \r\nNature stops being a passive object and becomes an \r\nactive subject. In that connection, the Constitution \r\nof Ecuador states that Mother Earth, or Pachamama, \r\nwhere life reproduces and f lourishes, has a right to \r\nfull respect for its existence and the maintenance and \r\nregeneration of its vital cycles, structure, functions and \r\ndevelopmental processes. By recognizing those rights, \r\nwe close the circle of the complementary relationship \r\nwith the rights of human beings. The Constitution \r\nof Ecuador has led to major progress in legal and \r\nenvironmental areas. It overcomes the human-centred \r\nvision of law prevailing in the world. We aspire to \r\nopen a discussion in this forum aimed at preparing a \r\nuniversal declaration on the rights of nature.\r\nIn the environment, Ecuador is one of the leading \r\npromoters at the international level of environmental \r\nsustainability policies. We have developed new \r\ninitiatives in the fight against climate change, such \r\nas the “net avoided emissions” mechanism. That has \r\nmade the Yasuní-ITT initiative an innovative sovereign \r\ndecision. We have also planned to protect natural \r\nresources and the cultures of several ethnic groups in \r\nthe Amazon region and have accepted the responsibility \r\nto reduce greenhouse-gas emissions.\r\nIn that context, Ecuador has been a leader in the \r\nregional debate on a model for domestic sustainable \r\ndevelopment. At the same time, together with the \r\nregional Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas bloc, we \r\nhave played a critical role within the United Nations \r\ndivorced from reality. That is why we also advocate \r\nthat the standards that are part of international legal \r\ncoexistence should be discussed and updated, because \r\ntheir forced application leads to chaos and weakens the \r\nrule of international law.\r\nFrom that point of view, our Constitution calls \r\non us to live in a constitutional State of rights and \r\nguarantees. The fundamental objective is what is called \r\nin the Quechua language sumak kawsay, or “the right \r\nto a good life” of people and nature, knowing how to \r\nlive fully, without any discrimination. It is based on \r\ndignity, solidarity, equality and the complementarity \r\nof people, cultures, nationalities, people’s social groups \r\nand countries in general.\r\nIt is the commitment to being human that calls on \r\nus to encourage tolerance, respect and full support for \r\neverybody, especially those aff licted with disabilities. \r\nEcuador has been nationally recognized on that front, \r\nbecause, in the last five years, it has maintained \r\nthe highest ratings for effectiveness in programme \r\nsupport and reintegration into daily life of our brothers \r\nand sisters with disabilities. The strength of our \r\nVice-President Lenín Moreno Garcés in his battle \r\nagainst discrimination against people with disabilities \r\nhas made it possible for him to be globally recognized. \r\nAdmiration of his programmes has led to his being \r\nnominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.\r\nSince human beings are at the centre of the \r\ncovenant of the popular revolution, we have given full \r\nsupport to those who suffer persecution because of \r\ntheir political ideas and sexual preferences. My country \r\nhas the largest number of refugees in Latin America \r\nand one of the largest numbers in the entire Western \r\nhemisphere. Almost 60,000 people living in Ecuador \r\nare refugees. We also have around 500,000 economic \r\nmigrants. That has led to recognition and expressions \r\nof gratitude by United Nations bodies. Because people \r\nin the situation of being refugees and asylum-seekers \r\nhave been incorporated into Ecuadorian society, they \r\nreceive political and social protection as well as an \r\neconomic subsidy from the Ecuadorian State.\r\nSocial groups that traditionally were discriminated \r\nagainst in Ecuador for ethnic or cultural reasons have \r\nalso seen a substantial improvement in their situation. \r\nThat is shown by the indicators for education, health \r\nand housing. But above all, President Rafael Correa has \r\nstressed that action to benefit the poorest is the main \r\nobjective of State policy. The incorporation of social \r\ngroups into the active life of the country has taken \r\n28 12-52563\r\nA/67/PV.20\r\nis written in concrete, practical actions as part of a \r\nnational development plan, overseen and managed by \r\nthe President of the Republic himself, that is bringing \r\nrapid change to our country — and without the usual \r\nsocial ills that result from the prescriptions of the \r\ninternational financial institutions. On the contrary, \r\nours is a participatory model founded in solidarity. \r\nWe have not neglected foreign direct investment, \r\nwhich we believe essential to our development strategy, \r\nso long as it complements our national initiatives, \r\nincluding our national development plan. I state with \r\npride that the Constitution of the Republic of Ecuador \r\nis the first in the world to define legal security as a \r\nhuman right in itself, respect for which and the direct \r\napplication of which are guaranteed by judicial, \r\nadministrative and constitutional authorities.\r\nNevertheless, we believe that progress for Ecuador \r\nor for any other country is at risk if the international \r\nsystem, either because of general indifference or \r\nbecause of interests that run contrary to global well-\r\nbeing, feeds a new era of anarchy in which unilateral \r\nactions or geopolitical conflicts predominate. For that \r\nreason, we would like to take this opportunity to reiterate \r\nthe need to rehabilitate and revitalize multilateralism, \r\nto upgrade international mechanisms and strengthen \r\ninternational law, so as to safeguard international peace \r\nand security and a healthy environment, which are the \r\nnecessary ingredients for worldwide development and \r\nprosperity. We want to use this platform to urge the \r\ninternational community and the representatives of all \r\nthe countries of the world to join in demonstrating the \r\nresolve, bravery and political will to drive the creation \r\nof a new international order — new in being more just, \r\nmore open, more participatory and more democratic.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Pham Quang Vinh, Deputy Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam.\r\nMr. Pham Quang Vinh (Viet Nam): On behalf \r\nof the delegation of Viet Nam, I extend my warmest \r\ncongratulations to you, Sir, on your election as President \r\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. I \r\nam confident that under your stewardship this session \r\nwill be crowned with success. I appreciate the excellent \r\nwork done by the Secretary-General and welcome the \r\noutcomes of the sixty-sixth session, presided over by \r\nMr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser.\r\nTo start with, we would like to welcome the theme \r\nproposed for this year’s general debate, “Bringing \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change, and we \r\nhave noted the scant political will, especially in the \r\ncountries in the North, to let themselves be subject to \r\nlegally binding commitments to reduce greenhouse-gas \r\nemissions. Ecuador has proposed, on the international \r\nlevel, an alternative sustainable participatory \r\ndevelopment model.\r\nWhen it comes to promoting human rights and the \r\nfreedom of expression, the Government of Ecuador \r\nhas been faithful to its tradition, which is to protect \r\nthose who seek refuge in its territory or its diplomatic \r\nmissions because they are victims of political \r\npersecution,  and has granted diplomatic asylum to the \r\nAustralian citizen Julian Assange in response to his \r\nrequest to the President of the Republic of Ecuador and \r\nafter an exhaustive judicial assessment. That has been a \r\nunique opportunity for the world community to debate \r\nthe process of asylum in that context and to observe \r\nthe political, legal and human repercussions of its \r\napplication within the framework of the strict respect \r\nfor international law. Ecuador is proud of having taken \r\na sovereign decision in a legal procedure that protects \r\nhuman beings anywhere in the world.\r\nOur country promotes the reform of the multilateral \r\nUnited Nations system through example and not just \r\nin words. We have also undertaken an unprecedented \r\ninstitutional reform of our own. The results have been \r\nhighly satisfactory, with outstanding levels of growth \r\nand poverty reduction. I want to mention just a few \r\nfigures, so that members can have a clear idea of our \r\nachievements. Under the Government of the Citizens’ \r\nRevolution, the poverty rate has been reduced from \r\n36.7 per cent to 25.3 per cent, a reduction of more than \r\n11 per cent. Extreme poverty, that is, abject poverty, \r\nhas come down from 16.5 per cent to 9.4 per cent. We \r\nhave reduced the Gini coefficient from 0.55 per cent \r\nto 0.47 per cent. For the first time in our two centuries \r\nas a republic, the extreme poverty rate for Ecuador’s \r\npopulation is below 10 per cent. An annual education \r\nbudget of $858 million has now grown by a factor of \r\n5.1, to $4.366 billion. Payment of external debt is not \r\nmore than 4.2 per cent of gross domestic product, while \r\nour spending on public social services stands at 11 per \r\ncent of gross domestic product.\r\nEvery international agency that has reviewed \r\nour macroeconomic numbers and social spending \r\nagree that the changes in our country are drastically \r\nimproving the lives of our citizens. We have not settled \r\nfor mere words, but, rather, our country’s success story \r\n12-52563 29\r\nA/67/PV.20\r\nthe Sea (UNCLOS) later this year, we should further \r\nreaffirm our strong commitment to and compliance \r\nwith that constitution of the seas, which contributes \r\nto the maintenance of peace, stability and maritime \r\nsecurity, safety and cooperation.\r\nThe United Nations continues to play an \r\nindispensable role, entrusted to it by the international \r\ncommunity, in the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security. Viet Nam commends the work done by \r\nthe United Nations, especially in helping settle regional \r\ndisputes and conflicts by peaceful means, including \r\nthrough the strengthened use of peacekeeping \r\noperations. We expect the Organization will continue \r\nto build further upon its experience in that area and \r\npromote a culture of peace and dialogue, to better \r\nresolve ongoing conflicts and prevent the eruption of \r\nnew ones.\r\nThe United Nations must step up efforts in \r\ndisarmament and the non-proliferation of nuclear \r\nweapons and other weapons of mass destruction, while \r\nstrengthening international cooperation and ensuring \r\nthe right of States to use related technologies for \r\npeaceful purposes. Multilateral negotiating forums in \r\nthis area, particularly the Conference on Disarmament, \r\nmust be revitalized and intensified.\r\nFurthermore, we should recognize the increasingly \r\nimportant role of regional organizations. In East Asia, \r\nthe Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) \r\ncontinues to play a central role in the regional \r\narchitecture and helps promote peace, stability and \r\nsecurity in the region, including maritime security \r\nin the South China Sea. Viet Nam fully supports \r\nASEAN’s six-point principles statement on the South \r\nChina Sea, which further reaffirms the settlement of \r\ndisputes by peaceful means, respect for international \r\nlaw, particularly UNCLOS, the full implementation \r\nof the Declaration of Conduct of Parties in the South \r\nChina Sea and a timely agreement on a code of conduct.\r\nPeace is the prerequisite for development. Yet it is \r\nsustainable development, including the end of poverty, \r\nthe promotion of social justice and the elimination of \r\ninequality in international relations, which helps resolve \r\nthe root causes of conflicts and lays the foundation for \r\na sustained peace.\r\nToday, the global economy continues to be in \r\ndifficulty. The Doha Development Round has yet to \r\nmake progress, while protectionism persists and the \r\nshortcomings of the international economic and financial \r\nabout adjustment or settlement of international disputes \r\nor situations by peaceful means”. This theme is of \r\nparticular relevance in today’s world, when instability \r\nand conflicts continue in various regions, especially in \r\nNorth Africa and the Middle East. The decades-long \r\nPalestinian-Israeli conflict lingers on and requires a \r\nsatisfactory solution, including the establishment of \r\nan independent sovereign Palestinian State coexisting \r\npeacefully with the State of Israel. Progress has yet \r\nto be made in disarmament, particularly nuclear \r\ndisarmament, while the risk of the proliferation of \r\nweapons of mass destruction continues to grow. New, \r\ncomplicated developments are emerging in the Asia-\r\nPacific region, a dynamically growing and important \r\nregion of the world.\r\nWe believe that the success of this General \r\nAssembly session will significantly contribute to the \r\nprimary goal of the United Nations, maintaining world \r\npeace and security. Accordingly, we must further uphold \r\ninternational law and strengthen compliance with \r\nit. Nations must strongly commit to the fundamental \r\nprinciples of international law and the United Nations \r\nCharter, particularly the peaceful settlement of disputes \r\nand non-use of force, as well as respect for the national \r\nindependence, sovereignty and territorial integrity \r\nof States. We must promote dialogue and the use of \r\npeaceful means in the settlement of disputes, especially \r\nrecourse to international and regional organizations \r\nand international legal mechanisms. And we must \r\nnot accept the imposition of sanctions like those \r\nagainst Cuba, the removal of which the Assembly has \r\nrepeatedly called for.\r\nInternational law is an intellectual creation of the \r\ncivilized world, which all States must respect and abide \r\nby in good faith. If international law is enforced, the \r\nrisk of conflict will be minimized and sustained peace \r\nwill be better secured.\r\nViet Nam therefore welcomes the important \r\noutcome of the recent High-level Meeting on the \r\nRule of Law at the National and International Levels \r\n(resolution 67/1), which reaffirmed that the rule of law \r\nis fundamental to political dialogue and cooperation \r\namong States and is the indispensable bedrock for a \r\nmore peaceful, prosperous and just world. Compliance \r\nwith international law is an essential principle that \r\nguides the policies and actions of each nation, as well \r\nas the joint endeavours of the international community.\r\nWhen we commemorate the thirtieth anniversary \r\nof the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of \r\n30 12-52563\r\nA/67/PV.20\r\npeople, which places the people at the centre and \r\npromotes their ownership and rights in all spheres.\r\nPursuing the policy of proactive international \r\nintegration, Viet Nam continues to contribute \r\nactively to the work of the United Nations, ASEAN, \r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement, the International \r\nOrganization of la Francophonie and others. We also \r\ncontribute constructively in multilateral forums in \r\nendeavours designed to respond to global challenges \r\nincluding nuclear security; disarmament and the \r\nnon-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; \r\nsustainable development; climate change; water, food \r\nand energy security; and the achievement of the MDGs. \r\nViet Nam has been implementing with good results \r\nthe United Nations initiative of Delivering as One. To \r\nfurther contribute to the work of the United Nations, \r\nViet Nam has put forth its candidature for membership \r\nin the Human Rights Council for the term 2014-2016, \r\nand we look forward to the Assembly’s support.\r\nViet Nam always endorses efforts to enhance \r\nthe role and effectiveness of the United Nations to \r\nenable the Organization to become the true centre for \r\nharmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment \r\nof the common goals enshrined in its Charter. We \r\ntherefore support the continued reform of the United \r\nNations, including the strengthening of the General \r\nAssembly as the most representative deliberative body, \r\nand of the Economic and Social Council in the field of \r\nsocioeconomic development, as well as the expansion \r\nof Security Council membership and reform of its \r\nworking methods.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.05 p.m.\r\nsystems have yet to be overcome. As a result, many \r\ncountries, especially developing countries, continue to \r\nface great difficulties in their development, including \r\nin their efforts to achieve the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs). In that context, it is essential that we \r\nreaffirm our strong political commitment to ensuring \r\nthe realization of the MDGs, the promotion of inclusive \r\nsustainable and green development, and the effective \r\nresponse to natural disasters, climate change and other \r\nglobal challenges. \r\nThe United Nations needs to strengthen global \r\npartnerships for development and take the lead in \r\nan inclusive process to formulate the post-2015 \r\nglobal development agenda, including the proposed \r\nsustainable development goals. In that regard, we urge \r\ndeveloped countries to fulfil their pledges for increased \r\ndevelopment assistance and support developing \r\ncountries in capacity-building.\r\nThis year, Viet Nam commemorates the thirty-fifth \r\nanniversary of its membership in the United Nations. \r\nThroughout that time, Viet Nam has consistently been \r\nan active and responsible member of the Organization, \r\nstriving for peace, national independence, democracy, \r\nsocial progress and prosperity for all nations. Building on \r\nits 25 years of reform and important accomplishments, \r\nViet Nam has been working towards a growth model \r\nthat links economic development with social progress \r\nand environmental protection. \r\nIn the face of recent global economic difficulties, \r\nViet Nam has taken steps to effectively maintain \r\nmacroeconomic stability and ensure social security. \r\nViet Nam continues to strengthen the rule of law and \r\nbuild a State of the people, by the people and for the \r\n"
