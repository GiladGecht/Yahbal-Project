In the complex web of interdependence in \r\nour world today, a local crisis can — with what was once \r\nunthinkable speed — affect the hopes and aspirations \r\nof entire societies halfway around the globe. Such \r\nchallenges, while daunting, present new opportunities \r\nto strengthen international dialogue and cooperation. \r\nASEAN is currently redoubling its efforts in \r\nregional integration via the establishment of an \r\nASEAN community by 2015. Underlining those efforts \r\nis a firm commitment to the work and principles of the \r\nUnited Nations. As such, ASEAN seeks to strengthen \r\ncoordination and cooperation on key global issues of \r\ncommon interest and concern. \r\nIn that spirit, ASEAN wishes to share with the \r\nGeneral Assembly certain issues of importance. \r\nFirst, ASEAN attaches great importance to sustained \r\neconomic growth. In the context of declining economic \r\nprospects and mounting global challenges, collective \r\naction at the regional and global levels is needed in \r\norder to produce an effective response. While ASEAN \r\ncontinues its efforts to establish an ASEAN economic \r\ncommunity by 2015, economic integration with all \r\nits partners has been strengthened. Moreover, in an \r\neffort to stabilize the financial sector, ASEAN has \r\nworked closely with China, Japan and the Republic \r\nof Korea to strengthen a regional financial safeguard \r\nmechanism — the Chiang Mai Initiative (CMI) — with \r\na recent doubling of CMI funds from $120 billion to \r\n$240 billion as a firewall against a liquidity crisis.\r\nIn the global context, ASEAN contributes to \r\nthe Group of 20 (G-20) annually. At this year’s G-20 \r\nSummit in Los Cabos, Mexico, Cambodia, acting as \r\nASEAN’s representative, reiterated the need to sustain \r\neconomic stability and structural reform for growth \r\nand employment, and the urgency to improve and \r\nstrengthen international financial architecture in an \r\ninterconnected global economy.\r\nSecondly, meeting the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs) is one of the pillars of sustainable \r\ndevelopment. As the deadline nears, greater progress \r\nin achieving the MDGs is of paramount importance. \r\nAs enshrined in the ASEAN Charter, reducing poverty \r\nUnited Nations A/67/PV.22\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-seventh session\r\n22nd plenary meeting\r\nTuesday, 9 October 2012, 10 a.m.\r\nNew York\r\nOffi cial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Jeremić . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Serbia)\r\n2 12-53869\r\nA/67/PV.22\r\nand narrowing the development gap within ASEAN \r\nthrough mutual assistance and cooperation is a primary \r\nmandate of ASEAN. As such, ASEAN is in absolute \r\nconcurrence with the report of the Secretary-General \r\non the work of the Organization (A/67/1), in that we \r\nmust not lose our momentum on reaching the MDGs \r\nby 2015.\r\nTo that end, ASEAN has been advancing its \r\nown efforts, as contained in its vision of an ASEAN \r\nsociocultural community. With the aim of facilitating \r\ncloser intra- and intersectoral collaboration, ASEAN \r\nadopted a road map in August 2011 for the attainment \r\nof the MDGs. Since then, remarkable progress has been \r\nmade by ASEAN member States, with some reaching \r\ntheir targeted goals. However, significant challenges \r\nremain, particularly in narrowing the development gap \r\nwithin the region.\r\nWe agree with the Secretary-General that disaster \r\nrisk reduction is essential to sustainable development. \r\nGiven the fact that Southeast Asia is prone to natural \r\ndisasters, disaster management is one of our top \r\npriorities. We reiterate the importance of strengthening \r\nASEAN’s collective response towards disasters \r\nby strengthening the ASEAN disaster response \r\nmechanism, namely, its Agreement on Disaster \r\nManagement and Emergency Response, and enhancing \r\nthe role of ASEAN’s Secretary General as Coordinator. \r\nCooperation between ASEAN and the United Nations \r\nis also strengthened through the ASEAN Coordinating \r\nCentre for Humanitarian Assistance on disaster \r\nmanagement.\r\nASEAN welcomes efforts to define new paradigms \r\nfor sustainable development and fully endorses \r\nthe outcome of the United Nations Conference on \r\nSustainable Development and the policy guidelines \r\noutlined in the outcome document, entitled “The future \r\nwe want” (resolution 66/288, annex).\r\nThirdly, in order to preserve our planet for the \r\nnext generation, immediate and concerted action to \r\naddress the critical problem of climate change is vital. \r\nSmall States in the Asia-Pacific and Caribbean regions \r\nremain threatened by rising sea levels, and developing \r\nnations dependent on agriculture face threats to their \r\nlivelihoods as a result of the externalities of climate \r\nchange. \r\nIn that context, it is regrettable that the international \r\ncommunity remains divided on the most appropriate \r\nresponse. We call on the developed countries to reduce \r\ntheir greenhouse-gas emissions in accordance with the \r\nUnited Nations principle of common but differentiated \r\nresponsibilities. It is disappointing that many of the \r\npromises made by nations since Copenhagen 2009 have \r\nnot been fulfilled in a timely manner. \r\nFourthly, ASEAN’s commitment to regional and \r\nglobal peace remains high on our agenda. This year \r\nmarked the forty-fifth anniversary of the founding of \r\nASEAN. Within a single generation since its initial \r\nfounding, the region has enjoyed sustained and durable \r\npeace and stability, which have been consolidated via \r\ninitiatives such as the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation \r\nin Southeast Asia and the establishment of the ASEAN \r\nRegional Forum.\r\nASEAN firmly believes that peacekeeping \r\nremains the pre-eminent instrument for maintaining \r\ninternational peace and security. We would also like to \r\nreiterate, however, that peacekeeping operations must \r\nrespect the principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity \r\nand non-interference in internal affairs. We are of the \r\nview that the cooperation between ASEAN and the \r\nUnited Nations in the area of peacekeeping is of great \r\nimportance. At present, around 5,000 police, military \r\nexperts and troops from ASEAN member States have \r\nactively participated in United Nations peacekeeping \r\noperations, including in demining activities.\r\nFifthly, ASEAN continues to strongly support \r\ninternational disarmament efforts, including efforts \r\ntoward achieving the goal of a nuclear-weapon-free \r\nworld. We believe that nuclear-weapon-free zones play \r\nan important part in maintaining peace and security \r\nin our region. ASEAN has worked hard to facilitate \r\nthe signing of the protocol to the Treaty on the South-\r\nEast Asia Nuclear Weapon Free Zone and its related \r\ndocuments by the five nuclear-weapon States as early \r\nas possible.\r\nFinally, ASEAN attaches great importance to the \r\npromotion and protection of human rights. Currently, \r\nASEAN is in the process of finalizing the ASEAN \r\nhuman rights declaration for adoption at the twenty-\r\nfirst ASEAN Summit in November 2012, with the aim \r\nof establishing a regional framework for cooperation to \r\nfully realize human rights in the region.\r\nWhile we move forward to consolidate regional \r\nintegration and attain the MDGs by 2015, we remain \r\nfirmly committed to working in tandem with the \r\nUnited Nations, and we support all efforts to reinforce \r\nand enhance ties between our respective organizations. \r\n12-53869 3\r\nA/67/PV.22\r\non the situation of human rights in the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea in order to address the \r\ngrave concerns of the international community there, \r\nincluding on the abductions issue.\r\nRegarding the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security, which is one of the primary tasks of \r\nthe United Nations, progress was made through the \r\nconcerted efforts of the international community during \r\nthe sixty-sixth session, in particular when looking at \r\nthe situations concerning the Sudan and South Sudan, \r\nand in Somalia and Yemen. In that regard, Japan is fully \r\ncommitted to contributing to United Nations efforts by \r\nparticipating in peacekeeping operation missions and \r\nextending assistance of various kinds to the affected \r\nareas. Japan is currently sending an engineering unit \r\nwith approximately 330 personnel to the United Nations \r\nMission in South Sudan and is operating a Self-Defence \r\nForce facility in the Republic of Djibouti, which is \r\nactively engaged in counter-piracy operations in the \r\nGulf of Aden and off the coast of Somalia.\r\nJapan welcomes the work undertaken by the United \r\nNations in the field of peacebuilding through the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission and the Peacebuilding Fund \r\n(PBF). Japan allocated an additional $12.5 million to the \r\nPBF last November. We believe that stronger emphasis \r\nmust be placed on the linkages between peacekeeping \r\nand development operations. Japan remains committed \r\nto ensuring that peacebuilding dividends are felt on \r\nthe ground through the work of the United Nations \r\npeacebuilding architecture. In addition, we welcome \r\nthe initiative by the Secretary-General to strengthen \r\ncivilian capacities in post-conflict States, including \r\nthrough the launching of CapMatch, the online United \r\nNations civilian capacities exchange, last month. Japan \r\ntakes interest in that initiative and its trial.\r\nThe adoption of resolution 66/290 on human \r\nsecurity by the General Assembly last month was a \r\nsignificant step towards addressing widespread and \r\ncross-cutting challenges to the survival, livelihood and \r\ndignity of people. Recognizing that the three pillars of \r\nthe United Nations — peace and security, development \r\nand human rights — are interlinked and mutually \r\nreinforcing, Japan will continue to further promote \r\nhuman security and seek specific ways to implement \r\nthat principle on the ground. \r\nTo that end, the Government of Japan has announced \r\na contribution of $10 million to the United Nations \r\nTrust Fund for Human Security. In addition, on the \r\noccasion of the fi fth Tokyo International Conference on \r\nASEAN warmly welcomes the strengthening of the \r\nrelations between the two organizations since the \r\nadoption of the Joint Declaration on Comprehensive \r\nPartnership between ASEAN and the United Nations \r\nin November 2011. In that context, ASEAN will submit \r\nto the General Assembly at the end of October the \r\ndraft of a resolution on cooperation between ASEAN \r\nand United Nations, which reflects the improved \r\nrelationship between the two organizations. ASEAN \r\nhopes that the draft resolution will receive strong \r\nsupport and co-sponsorship from all Member States as \r\nin the past.\r\nMr. Kodama (Japan): First of all, I would like to \r\nbegin by congratulating you, Sir, on your assumption \r\nof your duties as President of the General Assembly \r\nat its sixty-seventh session. Japan looks forward to \r\nyour leadership during the current session as we deal \r\nwith the global challenges that the General Assembly \r\nis mandated to discuss, as outlined in the Charter. We \r\nreaffirm our commitment to contributing to that work. \r\nI also would like to convey to Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon Japan’s deep appreciation for his efforts in \r\nguiding the diverse activities of the United Nations and \r\nfor his latest report on the work of the Organization \r\n(A/67/1).\r\nThe spirit of the United Nations Charter and the \r\nshared principles of the international community call \r\nupon us to settle international disputes in a peaceful \r\nmanner based on international law. Japan is committed \r\nto those principles and is determined to protect \r\npeace, ensure the safety of its people and protect its \r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity in accordance with \r\ninternational law. Japan reiterates its firm belief that \r\nany attempt to realize a certain ideology or claim by the \r\nunilateral use or threat of force is inconsistent with the \r\nUnited Nations Charter. In that connection, Japan will \r\ncontinue to work with the United Nations to strengthen \r\nthe rule of law, including through efforts to facilitate \r\nthe use of international courts and tribunals and by \r\nextending assistance to developing countries for the \r\nimprovement of their legal systems and the development \r\nof their human resources.\r\nFurthermore, it is our strong belief that the idea \r\nof the rule of law has a strong connection with the \r\nenhancement of human rights, which is one of three \r\npillars of the United Nations. Japan will continue to \r\nactively contribute to efforts to strengthen our role \r\nin the promotion of human rights. Japan will again \r\nsubmit, with the European Union, a draft resolution \r\n4 12-53869\r\nA/67/PV.22\r\nAfrican Development, to be held in Yokohama, Japan, \r\nin June next year, the Government of Japan will seek \r\nto discuss various measures that could be adopted and \r\nimplemented by participating African States for their \r\npeople and communities, with a view to strengthening \r\nhuman security.\r\nHuman security also applies when coping with \r\nnatural disaster. In order to share the lessons learned \r\nfrom the great East Japan earthquake of March 2011 \r\nand to formulate a framework for the sake of future \r\ngenerations, Japan reiterates its intention to host the \r\nthird World Conference on Disaster Reduction in 2015 \r\nand would like to substantiate our preparation for the \r\nConference with the support of the General Assembly.\r\nFrom the perspective of human rights, strengthening \r\ncapacity-building and the empowerment of individuals \r\nand communities, especially women and young people, \r\nis also crucial in the context of human security. \r\nBearing that in mind, Japan will also continue in \r\nvarious forums, including UN-Women and the Security \r\nCouncil, to address the challenges facing women in \r\norder to achieve gender equality and the empowerment \r\nof women. Furthermore, in the light of resolution 66/67 \r\non volunteerism, which was adopted in 2011, Brazil \r\nand Japan have jointly submitted draft resolution \r\nA/C.3/67/L.8 on mainstreaming and promoting \r\nvolunteerism for the next decade.\r\nThe transitions in the Middle East and North Africa \r\nhave again highlighted the importance of democracy \r\nand the rule of law. Japan will continue to support \r\ndemocratization and reform efforts by all countries.\r\nThe continuous violence and suppression, as well \r\nas the serious violations of human rights, in Syria \r\ncannot be overlooked from the perspective of the rule \r\nof law. Japan strongly condemns such violence in \r\nSyria and fully supports the efforts by Mr. Brahimi, \r\nJoint Special Representative of the United Nations \r\nand the League of Arab States for Syria. Japan also \r\nhas extended humanitarian assistance to the people of \r\nSyria. Furthermore, Japan commends the leadership \r\nof the United Nations for the mediation and electoral \r\nsupport provided in Libya and the engagement for \r\npolitical transition in Yemen. Such assistance is vital \r\nfor those countries in their efforts to achieve peaceful \r\ntransitions based on rule of law.\r\nWith regard to the Middle East peace process, the \r\nUnited Nations must also play a proactive role there. \r\nJapan strongly hopes for the immediate resumption \r\nof direct negotiations between the parties and is \r\ncommitted to continuously contributing to the efforts \r\nby the international community to realize a two-State \r\nsolution.\r\nIn its efforts to strengthen the rule of law in both \r\nthe regional and global contexts, the United Nations \r\nneeds to redouble its efforts aimed at suppressing the \r\nproliferation of arms that could fuel conflicts around \r\nthe world. The threat posed by weapons of mass \r\ndestruction continues to be one of the most pressing \r\nissues that the United Nations and its Member States \r\nneed to tackle. \r\nJapan has been playing a leading role in the adoption \r\nof the General Assembly resolutions that call for united \r\naction to achieve a world without nuclear weapons. \r\nFurthermore, the nuclear and missile programmes \r\nof the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea pose \r\nserious threats to the region, as well as to the entire \r\ninternational community. Japan strongly urges the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea to fully comply \r\nwith the relevant Security Council resolutions and its \r\ncommitments under the Joint Statement of the Fourth \r\nRound of the Six-Party Talks of 2005. \r\nWith regard to Iran, Japan continues to cooperate \r\nwith the Security Council Committee established \r\npursuant to resolution 1737 (2006). Japan strongly \r\nbelieves that full implementation of the Security Council \r\nresolutions on sanctions is of critical importance, as \r\nit provides a solid basis for United Nations action to \r\nstrengthen international peace and stability. \r\nIn order to strengthen the commitment of States \r\nMembers of the United Nations to full implementation \r\nof the relevant resolutions, Japan has been holding a \r\nnumber of New York-based conferences since 2010, and \r\nwe will continue to do so. We also need to establish the \r\nhighest common standards to regulate the international \r\ntrade in conventional arms, and in that connection, \r\nthe creation of a strong arms trade treaty is one of \r\nthe highest priorities. As we were unable to conclude \r\nnegotiations on such a treaty at the previous session, \r\nJapan, as one of the original seven authors of the \r\nresolution on the arms trade treaty, will do its utmost \r\nto finalize our work at the earliest possible time during \r\nthis session of the General Assembly.\r\nTerrorism also remains a grave threat and \r\nchallenge to peace, democracy, and freedom that \r\nrequires a continuing and comprehensive effort by the \r\ninternational community. Japan has been extending \r\n12-53869 5\r\nA/67/PV.22\r\nassistance to Afghanistan and many other countries in \r\norder to address local conditions that may be conducive \r\nto the spread of terrorism. Together with its partners \r\nin the international community, Japan remains firmly \r\ncommitted to the eradication of safe havens for terrorists \r\nin order to ensure peace and security in the world.\r\nAmong the multitude of challenges confronting \r\nthe United Nations, as presented in the report of the \r\nSecretary-General, foremost is the building of the \r\nfoundations for sustainable development. In that \r\ncontext, accelerating worldwide efforts to achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) is a crucial \r\ntask, and Japan is determined to contribute to that \r\nprocess and also to work toward the formulation of \r\nthe next development framework. In that regard, my \r\ndelegation welcomes the establishment of the High-\r\nlevel Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 \r\nDevelopment Agenda by the Secretary-General, in \r\nwhich former Prime Minister Naoto Kan is an active \r\nparticipant. \r\nWith a view to substantively contributing to the \r\npost-2015 discussions, including the High-level Panel, \r\nJapan has been leading an informal discussion forum, \r\nknown as the post-MDGs contact group, since last year. \r\nAs the chair of the contact group, Japan produced the \r\nsummary of the chair’s note and the framing questions \r\nas input to the Panel.\r\nThe issue of sustainable development, in particular \r\nthe follow-up to the outcome of the United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20), \r\nis another major task that the United Nations must \r\naccomplish. Japan will actively participate in the \r\nfollow-up process, including through discussions on the \r\nsustainable development goals. Japan is also committed \r\nto following up the Green Future Initiative, which the \r\nGovernment of Japan announced at Rio+20. In that \r\nregard, Japan will host the International Conference on \r\nUrban Planning and Regional Development next year.\r\nThe issue of climate change should not be put on \r\nthe back burner. We must keep advancing concrete \r\nefforts to reduce greenhouse gases without waiting for \r\nthe establishment of the future framework. It is also \r\nimportant that such efforts be made in effective and \r\nefficient ways, not only in each country but through \r\ninternational partnerships. In that regard, we proposed \r\nJapan’s vision and actions towards low-carbon growth \r\nand a climate-resilient world at the seventeenth \r\nConference of the Parties to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change, and have \r\nactively advanced regional and bilateral efforts alike.\r\nJapan’s efforts have included the first formulation \r\nwithin the Asia Low-Carbon Growth Partnership of a \r\nstrategy to promote low-carbon growth and climate- \r\nresilient development in the framework of the Tokyo \r\nInternational Conference on African Development and \r\nthe new flexible market mechanism proposed by Japan.\r\nAlthough Japan appreciates the General Assembly’s \r\ncomplementary efforts concerning the grave situation \r\nin Syria, it is regrettable that the Security Council has \r\ncontinued to fail to unite and speak in one voice on the \r\nissue. \r\nThe malfunction in the Security Council reminds us \r\nthat reform of the Council is long overdue and is one of \r\nthe most urgent tasks that Member States should tackle \r\nwith priority. Based on that belief, the Foreign Ministers \r\nof the Group of Four countries met in the margins of the \r\nopening of the current session of the General Assembly \r\nand reconfi rmed their common vision for reform. In that \r\ncontext, Japan appreciates the concrete efforts made \r\nby the Chair of the intergovernmental negotiations, \r\nAmbassador Zahir Tanin, during the sixty-sixth session \r\nand welcomes his recommendations contained in his \r\nletter dated 25 July. Japan calls for the drafting of a \r\nconcise working document on the matter, and calls \r\nupon other Member States to be actively engaged in \r\ngenuine text-based negotiations during this session \r\nwith a view to the holding of a high-level meeting on \r\nSecurity Council reform.\r\nRegarding administration and budgetary issues, \r\nthat significant topic includes two important items, \r\nnamely, the scale of assessments and human resources \r\nmanagement, including the mobility framework. Both \r\nitems will have great impact on the future of the \r\nOrganization, and Japan will be actively and positively \r\ninvolved in the negotiations on those items. Japan \r\nexpresses its appreciation for the Secretary-General’s \r\ncontinued strong commitment to better management in \r\nthe Secretariat, and we welcome his recent efforts to \r\nimprove transparency in the area of management. \r\nWith regard to the regular budget, Japan will push \r\nfor budgetary discipline and will carefully scrutinize \r\npotential additional requirements for the current \r\nbudget. Furthermore, it is imperative for the Secretariat \r\nto consider the next biennium budget carefully, not by \r\nsimply extending the 2012-2013 budget, but through a \r\nfresh look at the true needs of the Organization.\r\n6 12-53869\r\nA/67/PV.22\r\nI will close my statement today by reaffirming \r\nJapan’s firm commitment to the efforts of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in ensuring a common, effective and efficient \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nMr. Khalil (Egypt): It gives me great pleasure to \r\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of \r\nthe General Assembly. I would also like to thank the \r\nSecretary-General for his valuable report (A/67/1).\r\nThe successful conclusion of the United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) \r\nConference and the adoption of its outcome document, \r\n“The future we want” (resolution 66/288, annex), \r\nmarked the launching of the era of sustainable \r\ndevelopment in the work of our Organization, which \r\nrequires a more integrated approach so as to confront \r\nthe global challenges that we are facing. In the coming \r\nera, interlinkages among the challenges facing us must \r\nbe recognized, and economic, environmental and social \r\naspects must be incorporated in dealing with those \r\nchallenges, while avoiding separate paths towards the \r\nsame objective.\r\nIn that context, integration and coherence are key \r\nwords that should also apply to our working methods, \r\nincluding addressing the post-2015 development \r\nagenda, which should be fair, inclusive, sustainable \r\nand supportive of development efforts. While the rules \r\nfor the future establishment of the working group on \r\nsustainable development were not among the topics \r\naddressed in the report of the Secretary-General, I take \r\nthis opportunity to express concern about the delay in \r\nthe establishment of that group.\r\nIn that regard, I would like to suggest considering \r\nthe appointment of two facilitators — one from the \r\ndeveloping countries and the other from the developed \r\ncountries — and to convene the working group in \r\nan open format, until consensus is reached on its \r\ncomposition, so as to start substantive work at the \r\nearliest opportunity,. That is consistent with the spirit \r\nand letter of paragraph 248 of the Rio+20 outcome \r\ndocument, which provides for the launching of an \r\nintergovernmental process that is transparent, inclusive \r\nand open to all stakeholders and for the establishment \r\nof an open-ended working group for that purpose.\r\nEgypt stresses the importance of accelerated \r\nprogress to achieve the Millennium Development \r\nGoals by 2015. We view the mention in the report of the \r\ndecrease, for the first time in many years, in the level \r\nof official development assistance as well as the rise of \r\ntrade protectionism, with great concern. They may have \r\npotential negative consequences on the development \r\nefforts of developing countries.\r\nEgypt reaffirms that any international response to \r\nclimate change must enhance the implementation of \r\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange. It must be in accordance with the principles \r\nand provisions of the Convention, in particular the \r\nprinciples of equity and common but differentiated \r\nresponsibilities.\r\nEgypt looks forward to a positive and effective \r\noutcome to the Conference of the Parties to the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to \r\ntake place in Doha, Qatar. We hope that it will succeed \r\nin achieving and agreeing a legally binding second \r\ncommitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. \r\nWe also look forward to United Nations efforts to \r\nhelp African countries to address their development \r\ngoals. We call for providing adequate funding for \r\npeacebuilding programmes by intensifying cooperation \r\nwith international and regional financial organizations. \r\nWe also look forward to increasing the available \r\nresources of the Peacebuilding Fund.\r\nThe Syrian crisis is deteriorating after more than \r\n18 months. With thousands of innocent civilians \r\nkilled, it is evident that the Syrian people do not need \r\nfurther decisions or initiatives. What they really need \r\nis substantive improvement on the ground. That will \r\nnot be possible unless an immediate cessation of \r\nviolence is achieved. The Syrian regime bears the main \r\nresponsibility for the violence. We believe that any \r\nplans to resolve the crisis should be based on starting the \r\nprocess of transition and political change immediately \r\nin order to respond to the legitimate aspirations of the \r\nSyrian people and provide the necessary guarantees for \r\nall factions of Syrian society.\r\nThe democratic transition in Egypt and the Arab \r\nworld has proved that real democracy comes from the \r\npeople, from their own priorities, from their aspirations \r\nto economic development and social justice, and from \r\ntheir cultural and religious specificities. It highlights \r\nthe interrelated and interdependent relationship \r\nbetween political, civil, economic, social and cultural \r\nrights. That is why it is extremely important to provide \r\nfurther support for United Nations efforts to promote \r\nall human rights and fundamental freedoms, including \r\nthe right to development.\r\n12-53869 7\r\nA/67/PV.22\r\nThe starting point of any discussion on the \r\nresponsibility to implement the concept of the \r\nresponsibility to protect is to affirm that such \r\nresponsibility lies mainly with the Member States. \r\nThe role of the international community is to support \r\nGovernments in carrying out that responsibility. We must \r\ncontinue discussions on the concept of responsibility to \r\nprotect in accordance with the relevant paragraphs of \r\nthe 2005 World Summit Outcome document (resolution \r\n60/1) and the General Assembly resolutions, including \r\nresolution 64/291. We should avoid politicization of the \r\nconcept. We should also avoid using it as a pretext to \r\ninterfere in domestic affairs.\r\nEgypt welcomes the inclusion of youth issues \r\namong the priorities of the Secretary-General in his \r\nsecond term, as well as his emphasis on the comments \r\nmade by the Egyptian President in his statement before \r\nthe General Assembly (see A/67/PV.9) to consider the \r\nestablishment of a United Nations body on youth in \r\norder to address the challenges facing young people \r\nand to respond to their aspirations in areas of education \r\nand employment. We also express our appreciation \r\nfor the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality \r\nand the Empowerment of Women for its activities in \r\nCairo and its commitment to promote women’s political \r\nparticipation in the Arab States.\r\nCorruption in all its forms is the most dangerous \r\ncrime in all societies. It undermines security and \r\nstability. It destroys national economies. It is also closely \r\nlinked to forms of organized crime. Egypt looks forward \r\nto identifying the contribution of the United Nations \r\nTask Force on Transnational Organized Crime and \r\nDrug Trafficking, established by the Secretary-General \r\nin 2011, in the fight against corruption and achieving \r\ndevelopment, especially in developing countries. We \r\nalso look forward to effective international efforts to \r\nrecover illegally acquired funds smuggled abroad from \r\ndeveloping countries, and to establish a mechanism to \r\ntrace those assets in all countries, banks and financial \r\ninstitutions.\r\nI would like also to thank the Secretary-General \r\nfor emphasizing the importance of implementing the \r\noutcome of the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties \r\nto the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \r\nWeapons (NPT). I wish to highlight the particular \r\nimportance that Egypt attaches to the upcoming 2012 \r\nconference on the establishment of a Middle East zone \r\nfree of nuclear weapons and all other weapons of mass \r\ndestruction. The outcome document of the 2010 Review \r\nConference (NPT/CONF.2010/50 (Vol. I)) clearly \r\nmandated the Secretary-General and the three NPT \r\ndepositary States to take the necessary measures to \r\nconvene the conference, in consultation with the States \r\nof the region. \r\nWe reiterate that the achievement of the universality \r\nof the NPT remains the basis of the multilateral \r\ndisarmament regime. I would like to emphasize here \r\nthat the final document of the 2010 Review Conference \r\ncannot be compared to other documents emanating \r\nfrom other forums with limited participation and less \r\nauthority.\r\nEgypt agrees with the recommendations of the \r\nSecretary-General on the need to combat the illicit \r\nproliferation of small arms and light weapons. It is also \r\nimportant to address the issue of the accumulation of \r\nstockpiles by producing States for purposes of export \r\nand profit. The arms trade treaty should achieve \r\na balance between the interests of exporting and \r\nimporting countries. It must also affirm the rights of \r\nStates to self-defence and to acquire, export and import \r\nweapons within legal frameworks.\r\nIn conclusion, I express our appreciation to the \r\nSecretary-General for his important report, and I \r\nassure you, Sir, of Egypt’s readiness to work with you \r\nand with all other delegations to reach concrete results \r\nduring this session in order to contribute to achieving \r\nour goals of peace, justice, development and universal \r\nhuman rights.\r\nMr. Rahman (Bangladesh): My delegation wishes \r\nto thank the Secretary-General for his report on the \r\nwork of the Organization (A/67/1). We appreciate \r\nhis continued efforts and those of his staff, both at \r\nHeadquarters and in the field, to meet the expectations \r\nof the membership.\r\nThe global community today is facing unprecedented \r\nchallenges to peace, security and development. \r\nRanging from popular uprisings to political turmoil, \r\nfrom climate disaster to global financial crises, from \r\nhuman rights violations and deprivation to extremism \r\nor terrorism, the list of threats to humankind is ever-\r\nexpanding. The times call for us to reaffirm our resolve \r\nand fight the challenges collectively and peacefully \r\nunder the auspices of the United Nations.\r\nThe ideal of global peace and stability will remain \r\nan empty slogan without prosperity in the developing \r\ncountries. The global economic downturn has, \r\nunfortunately, worn away years of development gains in \r\n8 12-53869\r\nA/67/PV.22\r\nwill begin soon. As agreed in Rio, that work will \r\nhave to be closely associated and coordinated with the \r\nprocesses that will take up the development agenda \r\nbeyond 2015. Priority must be given to the challenges \r\nof poverty, employment, food and energy, water, health \r\nand environmental sustainability. The Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals must be integrated into the new \r\nframework so that the unmet development priorities \r\ncontinue to be the main focus of the international \r\ncommunity.\r\nClimate change is having a serious impact on many \r\ncountries and is even threatening their existence. Its \r\nimpact is undermining the development efforts of many \r\ncountries. It is high time that a global, comprehensive \r\nand ambitious agreement on climate change is reached. \r\nThe agreement should include not only provisions on \r\ngreenhouse-gas emissions based on the principle of \r\ncommon but differentiated responsibilities and burden-\r\nsharing, but also the concerns of climate migrants, \r\nthe transfer of green technologies and the funding of \r\nthe Green Climate Fund, inter alia, for adaptation and \r\nmitigation purposes.\r\nWe support all efforts to mainstream the rule of \r\nlaw into the activities of the United Nations system. \r\nWhether it is for the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security or the promotion of development \r\nand protection of human rights, it is crucial to stick to \r\nand respect the rule of law. The countries that promote \r\nthe rule of law internally must also respect the rule of \r\nlaw in international settings.\r\nMy delegation is deeply concerned over the \r\nstagnation of the multilateral negotiations on \r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation. Progress in the \r\nnuclear field continues to be impeded in particular \r\nby the inability of the Conference on Disarmament to \r\novercome its differences and agree on a programme of \r\nwork that would allow for the resumption of substantive \r\nwork. There is also need for meaningful dialogue \r\namong all States possessing nuclear weapons to build \r\ntrust and confidence for reducing the imperative of \r\nnuclear weapons in their security doctrines.\r\nPoor regulation of the global trade in arms continues \r\nto pose a significant threat to peace and security. It is \r\ntherefore very disappointing that the United Nations \r\nConference on the Arms Trade Treaty failed to agree \r\non the text of a treaty that would have set common \r\nstandards for the international trade in conventional \r\narms. It frustrates the hopes of the millions of people \r\nall over the world who bear the brunt of the negative \r\nmany countries. Under those circumstances, the quest \r\nfor poverty eradication and sustainable development \r\nbecomes an uphill task. It thus appears that the \r\nrealization of the Millennium Development Goals by \r\n2015 will not be possible for many developing countries, \r\nespecially the least developed countries (LDCs), \r\nwithout additional financing. Against that backdrop, \r\nthe reported decline in official development assistance \r\nlast year is indeed alarming. \r\nIn general, developing countries should have more \r\nsay in international economic affairs. It is necessary \r\nto establish a rules-based and fair multilateral trade \r\nsystem and push towards multilateral trade negotiations \r\ngrounded in the principles of mutual understanding and \r\nconcession. It is also essential to review decision-making \r\nprocesses in the international financial system and \r\nensure that developing countries have more weight in \r\nthose processes. \r\nSupport for the least developed countries like \r\nBangladesh must come in the form of granting market \r\naccess, removing trade barriers, the fulfilment \r\nof overseas development assistance targets, more \r\naid commitments, funding adaptation to climate \r\nchange, and giving us equal voice in the Bretton \r\nWoods institutions and other international financial \r\ninstitutions. Commitments have been made by the \r\ninternational community to strengthen the economic \r\nstability of LDCs. It is now time for the development \r\npartners to implement the commitments made in \r\nMonterrey, Paris, Brussels and, most recently, Istanbul. \r\nMigration for development is one of the largest \r\ninter-State economic activities of this century. The \r\nmajority of the world’s labour migrants are from the \r\ndeveloping South. Their remittances alleviate poverty \r\nand contribute to development in both the sending and \r\nthe receiving States. Although there is relatively free \r\nf low of capital, there is no free f low of labour. In that \r\nregard, Bangladesh continues to advocate in favour of \r\nimplementation of Mode 4 of the General Agreement on \r\nTrade in Services under the World Trade Organization.\r\nBuilding the foundations of sustainable \r\ndevelopment is the greatest challenge we face today \r\nas an international community. At the United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development Conference \r\n(Rio+20), the international community renewed its \r\ncommitment to sustainable development. In its outcome \r\ndocument (resolution 66/288, annex), Member States \r\nagreed to define universally applicable sustainable \r\ndevelopment goals. The work to develop the goals \r\n12-53869 9\r\nA/67/PV.22\r\nNations. We welcome and support efforts to transform \r\nthe Secretariat into a more efficient and responsive \r\nbody. In our view, a dynamic Secretariat, accountable \r\nto all its stakeholders, is needed to deliver quality \r\nresults for the benefit of the wider membership.\r\nFinally, it is our sincere hope that in this session \r\nthe General Assembly will continue to move from \r\ncommitments to action and that the United Nations \r\nwill continue the process of transforming itself into an \r\ninstitution ready to meet the challenges of the day.\r\nMr. Khan (Indonesia): Allow me first of all to \r\nthank the Secretary-General for his report on the \r\nwork of the Organization (A/67/1). We share many of \r\nhis assessments of the current world situation and the \r\nactivities of the United Nations during the past year. \r\nThe most important thing for us to do is ensure that \r\nthe United Nations delivers. We must deliver to achieve \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and other \r\ninternationally agreed development goals. We must \r\ndeliver to bring peace to places of conflict. And we \r\nmust deliver to promote human rights, rule of law and \r\ndemocracy.\r\nIndonesia aligns itself with the statement made \r\nby the representative of Cambodia on behalf of the \r\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). \r\nThe world is confronted by multifaceted, interlinked \r\nand simultaneous challenges. Only by working together \r\nwill we find the effective avenues and capacity needed \r\nto address them. I wish to take this opportunity to share \r\nsome thoughts on the report, as follows.\r\nFirst, I note with pleasure the successful conclusion \r\nof the United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (Rio+20), which renewed the global \r\ncommitment to mainstreaming a balanced approach in \r\norder to integrate the three dimensions of sustainable \r\ndevelopment. It is essential that we honour our \r\ncommitments made at the Rio+20 Conference. While \r\ndeveloped countries are expected to do more to help \r\ndeveloping countries, the latter must also strive to do \r\ntheir utmost. When it comes to following up the Rio+20 \r\noutcome decisions, it is important that the international \r\ncommunity work in a coordinated manner to scale up its \r\nefforts. The United Nations should therefore focus on \r\nensuring that follow-up efforts to the Rio+20 outcomes \r\nare implemented.\r\nSince their inception, the MDGs have lifted \r\nmillions out of poverty and to a better standard of \r\nliving. Yet progress has been uneven and unbalanced, \r\nconsequences of conflict and violence fuelled by the \r\nunregulated arms trade.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the Secretary-General’s \r\nefforts in the areas of peacekeeping and peacebuilding, \r\nwhich are the vital cornerstones upon which the \r\nUnited Nations was created. The challenge before \r\nus is to ensure that United Nations peacekeeping is \r\nadequately financed and enabled to meet the realities \r\nof today. We strongly support continued partnership \r\namong the troop- and police-contributing countries, \r\nthe General Assembly and the Security Council to \r\nmake peacekeeping more effective. It is also essential \r\nto ensure that all stakeholders are closely involved with \r\nplanning and managing peacekeeping operations.\r\nThe establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission \r\n(PBC), the Peacebuilding Support Office and the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund was an important development. The \r\nPeacebuilding Commission provides a much-needed \r\nforum in which all actors involved in peacebuilding can \r\ncoordinate their efforts. The ongoing engagement of the \r\nPBC and the programmes funded by the Peacebuilding \r\nFund have made critical contributions to fostering \r\nstability in post-conflict countries. We need to nurture \r\nthose nascent structures in the greater interest of peace \r\nand stability in the world.\r\nWe need to make the United Nations and its work \r\nmore relevant to the evolving international order. As \r\nsuch, we support the ongoing efforts to undertake \r\nnecessary reform. The objective of the reform should \r\nbe to strengthen the leading role of United Nations in \r\ninternational affairs, enhance its working efficiency \r\nand strengthen its capacity to deal with various threats \r\nand challenges. \r\nMy delegation attaches importance to the ongoing \r\nprocess of revitalizing the General Assembly. The \r\nprimacy of the Assembly f lows from the universality \r\nof its membership and the principle of the sovereign \r\nequality of all its members. The General Assembly \r\nshould be emboldened as the chief deliberative and \r\npolicymaking organ of the United Nations. \r\nUnited Nations reform will not be complete \r\nwithout meaningful Security Council reform. The \r\nSecurity Council needs to be reformed by expanding \r\nboth the permanent and non-permanent categories \r\nof membership in order to reflect the realities of the \r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nWe attach great importance to the transparent, \r\naccountable and efficient management of the United \r\n10 12-53869\r\nA/67/PV.22\r\nand many countries are still not on track to meet the \r\nMDGs by 2015. We should therefore make it an urgent \r\npriority to greatly accelerate progress by providing \r\nthose countries with the necessary support. And as the \r\ndeadline to achieve the MDGs approaches, this is an \r\nappropriate time to begin a discussion that will lead to \r\na robust, bold and ambitious agenda for development \r\nbeyond 2015.\r\nFor developing countries, economic growth and \r\neradicating poverty remain overriding priorities. We \r\nshare others’ concern that as the supply of fossil-fuel-\r\nbased energy is depleted, we must seek more sustainable \r\nand efficient energy sources. Indonesia is making \r\nongoing efforts to establish bilateral and multilateral \r\ncooperation in the promotion and development of \r\nrenewable energy use. In that regard, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s initiative on sustainable energy for all could \r\nbe used as a basis for formulating national policy on \r\nenergy. \r\nConcerning the issue of climate change, it is vital \r\nthat the Doha Climate Change Conference, to be held at \r\nthe end of this year, make significant progress towards \r\nsaving the planet. The Conference should ensure that \r\nthe second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol \r\nwill be effectively implemented in order to create a \r\nfoundation for stabilizing the global climate in future. \r\nWhile, in a spirit of common and differentiated \r\nresponsibility, developed countries should take the lead \r\nin reducing emissions and developing countries should \r\nalso make their best efforts, the world must come up \r\nwith a cogent and comprehensive climate-change \r\nregime for the years following 2020.\r\nIt is estimated that this year global unemployment \r\nwill reach 200 million, of whom 75 million are \r\nyoung people. In developing countries, where young \r\npeople constitute the fastest-growing segment of \r\nthe population, prolonged youth unemployment is \r\ndamaging to inclusive, sustainable and equitable \r\ngrowth. In Indonesia’s experience, it is important to \r\nencourage growth in sectors that can generate greater \r\nemployment, and to invest intensively in sectors such as \r\nhealth and education. Cooperation in education, skills \r\ndevelopment and training, including internships, is \r\nvery important. On-the-job training for young people \r\nthat helps to support a successful transition from school \r\nto work should also be included.\r\nWhere United Nations peacekeeping operations are \r\nconcerned, we must ensure that adequate equipment \r\nand resources, along with training, are available so \r\nthat personnel are prepared for the complexity of \r\ntheir mandated tasks, particularly those relating to the \r\nprotection of civilians. Indonesia has been an active \r\nparticipant in United Nations peacekeeping missions \r\nsince 1957, and will continue to contribute troops and \r\npolice to such missions. We are now the top troop-\r\ncontributing country to the United Nations Interim \r\nForce in Lebanon.\r\nWe would like to emphasize the importance of \r\nenhanced transparency in the selection and appointment \r\nof strategic posts in United Nations peacekeeping \r\noperations, both in the field and at Headquarters, taking \r\ninto account Member States’ troop contributions. We \r\nalso plan to broaden our participation by becoming a \r\nprovider of global civilian capacity in the aftermath \r\nof conflict. In that regard, we continue to support \r\ntransparent dialogue among Member States and other \r\nrelevant stakeholders, in keeping with the provisions of \r\nresolution 66/255 on civilian capacity in the aftermath \r\nof conflict.\r\nMr. Touray (Sierra Leone), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nWe are deeply concerned about the many threats we \r\nsee to international peace and security. We are worried \r\nthat the continued existence of nuclear weapons and \r\nthe growing arms race are casting a shadow over the \r\nstability and security of the world. We must exercise \r\nour political will and capacity to act to overcome the \r\ncontinuing lack of progress and impasse that aff lict \r\nour disarmament machinery. We must tackle the \r\nproblems that are hindering progress on disarmament \r\nand non-proliferation firmly and in all seriousness. \r\nThe impasse in the Conference on Disarmament is an \r\nobstacle to our attainment of a world free of nuclear \r\nweapons. It is vital that the Conference, as the single \r\nmultilateral negotiating forum on disarmament and \r\nnon-proliferation, start its substantive work on the core \r\nissues of its agenda.\r\nIndonesia welcomed the third biennial review in \r\nJune of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism \r\nStrategy and therefore also welcomes the full \r\nimplementation of the Counter-Terrorism Strategy’s \r\nfour pillars. Indonesia has based its national response \r\nto the challenge of terrorism on those pillars for several \r\nyears now, and we believe that they provide the kind \r\nof holistic framework necessary to ensure coordination \r\nand success. \r\n12-53869 11\r\nA/67/PV.22\r\ndialogue and improved coordination with its partners at \r\nthe global, regional, national and local levels. In New \r\nYork in March, Indonesia, together with Australia, Peru \r\nand Norway, formed the Group of Friends for Disaster \r\nRisk Reduction as an open-ended informal mechanism \r\naimed at discussing and promoting awareness of \r\ndisaster risk reduction, including the post-2015 Hyogo \r\nFramework for Action.\r\nGiven the magnitude of the challenges confronting \r\nus, strengthened cooperation and partnership between \r\nthe United Nations and regional organizations are \r\nenormously important in helping us to address them. \r\nIn that connection, we would like to emphasize that the \r\nadoption of the Joint Declaration on the Comprehensive \r\nPartnership between ASEAN and the United Nations, \r\nat the fourth ASEAN-United Nations Summit in Bali \r\nin November 2011, showcases the concerted efforts of \r\nboth organizations in teaming up to that end.\r\nIndonesia appreciates the work of the Secretariat, \r\nparticularly that of the Division for Ocean Affairs and \r\nthe Law of the Sea, which has assumed the duty of \r\norganizing numerous ocean and law of the sea meetings. \r\nTo that extent, we encourage stronger support to the \r\nDivision to facilitate the provision of excellent service.\r\nIn the spirit of friendship and open dialogue, we \r\nwill be able to move forward with the agenda before us \r\nat the sixty-seventh session of the General Assembly. \r\nIn that regard, you can count on the cooperation and \r\nsupport of my delegation.\r\nMr. Estreme (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nThe Argentine Republic wishes to express its thanks \r\nto the Secretary-General for his presentation of the \r\nreport on the work of the Organization (A/67/1). We \r\nagree with the Secretary-General that the pillars of \r\nthe Organization’s work are becoming increasingly \r\ninterrelated. In that sense, we welcome the efforts to \r\nimprove the coordination of all activities, particularly \r\nthe identification of the five areas in which cooperation \r\nwith Member States will allow better execution of the \r\nmandates.\r\nSustainable development calls for integrating \r\naspects of economic growth, social development and \r\nenvironmental protection. It also needs to be inclusive. \r\nThe paradigm of sustainable development must be \r\nbased on the fundamental principles that all States \r\nhave accepted, particularly the principle of common \r\nbut differentiated responsibilities. That principle was \r\nreaffirmed last June at the United Nations Conference \r\nAt the regional level, Indonesia has participated \r\nin several initiatives focusing on various areas of \r\ncounter-terrorism. Through ASEAN, we have a strong \r\nand highly coordinated approach involving various \r\ncounter-terrorism programmes, as well as the ASEAN \r\nConvention on Counter-Terrorism. We believe that \r\nthe Convention will fully supplement and support the \r\nimplementation of the United Nations Global Counter-\r\nTerrorism Strategy, especially in the area of human \r\nrights, and address the issue of conditions conducive \r\nto terrorism.\r\nThe promotion and protection of human rights is \r\none of our Government’s basic pillars. We continue to \r\nsupport the work of human rights institutions. In the \r\nlight of this, we welcome the progress made by the \r\nUnited Nations during the year in review. We share the \r\nview that not only are these rights universal, indivisible, \r\ninterdependent and interrelated, but that development \r\ncannot take place if human rights are imperilled. Social \r\nadvancement and stability can be guaranteed only if \r\nthey are planted in the fertile soil of human rights. In \r\nthat regard, we are pleased to be able to participate in \r\nUnited Nations efforts to strengthen and enhance the \r\neffective functioning of the human rights treaty system.\r\nIndonesia is pleased that 2012 was designated \r\nthe Year of Prevention. Without doubt, recent events \r\nin the Middle East and North Africa have underlined \r\nthe importance of the concept of the responsibility \r\nto protect in guiding countries that have to deal with \r\npreventing and responding to such events.\r\nThose providing humanitarian assistance should \r\ncontinue to uphold the principles of neutrality, humanity, \r\nimpartiality and respect for the sovereignty of the \r\ncountries in question. All international humanitarian \r\nassistance should be organized around the principle \r\nthat the countries affected have primary responsibility. \r\nIt is therefore essential to strengthen the capacity \r\nand resources of national and local Governments \r\nto coordinate and deliver humanitarian assistance, \r\nincluding in disaster risk management and mitigation.\r\nWe welcome the continuing role of the Central \r\nEmergency Response Fund, which last year stood at \r\n$465 million. However, funding must continue to be \r\nsustainable and predictable, and accountability for \r\nthe use of funds should be improved through greater \r\ntransparency and evidence of results delivered, \r\namong other things. The work of the United Nations \r\nin promoting effectiveness and efficiency in disaster \r\nrisk reduction should be enhanced through continuing \r\n12 12-53869\r\nA/67/PV.22\r\nWe agree with the Secretary-General that in recent \r\nyears, conflicts have become more complex. The \r\nresponse of the United Nations must be appropriate to \r\nthe circumstances. It must help prevent conflict through \r\nthe various methods for peaceful settlement of disputes \r\nprovided for in Chapter VI of the Charter of the United \r\nNations, using force only exceptionally and as a last \r\nresort. We welcome the decision of the President of the \r\nAssembly to devote the topic for this general debate and \r\nthe theme for the current session to a concept which \r\nmy country holds dear — the peaceful settlement \r\nof disputes. We reaffirm Argentina’s unshakeable \r\ncommitment to that concept. We will encourage other \r\nStates to adopt similar positions.\r\nWe highlight the fundamental importance of \r\nrespect for fundamental freedoms and human rights, not \r\nonly for development but to put an end to the violence \r\nthat threatens international peace and security. We \r\nbelieve that it is right to include human rights policy in \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations and political \r\nmissions. We are certain that this will contribute to the \r\neffective execution of the Organization’s mandates and \r\nstrengthen the link between peacekeeping operations \r\nand respect for those very important rights.\r\nArgentina leads a worldwide campaign to promote \r\nand universalize the International Convention for the \r\nProtection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. \r\nOur country was the first in Latin America and \r\nthe second in the world to ratify the Convention. \r\nWe welcome the first session of the Committee on \r\nEnforced Disappearances and the signing in Geneva in \r\nFebruary 2012 of the third Optional Protocol to United \r\nNations Convention on the Rights of the Child on a \r\ncommunications procedure, which Argentina signed \r\nlast July.\r\nArgentina agrees with the Secretary-General \r\nin highlighting the important contribution of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court to the fight against \r\nimpunity. The Court is the first permanent international \r\ncriminal tribunal, and 2012 marks the tenth anniversary \r\nof its establishment. Also this year, the Court delivered \r\nits first decision, sentencing Thomas Lubanga for \r\nrecruiting children in the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo. We emphasize the importance of addressing at \r\nthe United Nations the issue of the financing of referrals \r\nmade by the Security Council to the Court. We also \r\nstress the importance of cooperation by all States, both \r\nparties and non-parties to the Rome Statute, with the \r\nCourt, especially with regard to arrest warrants.\r\non Sustainable Development. For my country, that \r\nprinciple has been an integral part of environmental \r\nnegotiations for over two decades, and rightly so. \r\nThe obligations of each country in economic, social \r\nand environmental areas worldwide must match \r\nits development, its specific circumstances and its \r\ndifferent historical responsibilities for environmental \r\ndeterioration.\r\nAnother fundamental principle in the context \r\nof the intersection of the three pillars of sustainable \r\ndevelopment is the full sovereignty of each country \r\nover its natural resources.\r\nArgentina maintains that there is no single \r\ndevelopment model applicable to each and every nation. \r\nBut we believe that growth must be accompanied by \r\nsocial inclusion and must permit the creation of decent \r\nwork, which allows those who have the least to regain \r\ntheir dignity. We are not in favour of single models, \r\nneither our own nor those of others, when it comes to \r\nimplementing each country’s policies for sustainable \r\ndevelopment.\r\nWe are willing to work within the General Assembly \r\nin an inclusive and transparent fashion to move forward \r\nin the achievement of sustainable development goals. It \r\nis necessary for the process we launch to be strongly \r\nrooted in the principles that have guided us since \r\n1992, to be invigorated by scientific and technological \r\nknowledge and advances, and, above all else, to have \r\nthe means it requires for its implementation. We must \r\nalso consider together how to make future sustainable \r\ndevelopment goals compatible with the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, adopted 12 years ago.\r\nTurning to the idea of the green economy, \r\nArgentina will not accept any proposal that would \r\nresult in green protectionism, nor will we accept \r\nthe promotion of policies that constitute disguised \r\nrestrictions on international trade or arbitrary and \r\nunjustifiable discrimination. We do not believe that \r\nthe green economy should replace the paradigm of \r\nsustainable development. For that reason, it will only \r\nbe possible to conceive of the green economy as another \r\ntool for sustainable development — a tool that includes \r\nthe necessary means of implementation and that each \r\ncountry will be able to use in a sovereign fashion, taking \r\ninto account its political needs and national priorities, \r\nas agreed in the outcome document “The future we \r\nwant” (resolution 66/288, annex).\r\n12-53869 13\r\nA/67/PV.22\r\nfor the interests of all Member States. Only in that way \r\nwill the international community be able to achieve \r\na prosperous world that is free of poverty, disease, \r\nanachronistic protectionist measures and unilateral \r\neconomic sanctions. \r\nWe believe that the United Nations is not making \r\nsufficient use of factors conducive to promoting a global \r\neconomic recovery. In that context, we draw attention to \r\nmiddle-income countries as one such element. Planned \r\nand targeted assistance to such countries will increase \r\nthe number of donor States and will clearly show least \r\ndeveloped countries the possibilities for multilateral \r\ncooperation once they have achieved a new level of \r\ndevelopment.\r\nWe place particular hope in the upcoming four-\r\nyearly comprehensive policy review of operational \r\ndevelopment activities within the United Nations \r\nsystem. In our opinion, that review must lead to a system \r\nof targeted measures seeking to ensure sustainable \r\ndevelopment for all States that receive United Nations \r\nassistance.\r\nWe are concerned about the decreasing share \r\nof resources for the programme activities of United \r\nNations operational bodies. That has a negative impact \r\non the predictability and coordination of their work. In \r\nthat regard, we believe that the efforts of the United \r\nNations system to stabilize financing for development \r\nmust be stepped up by increasing the number of donors \r\nand public-private partnerships. \r\nThe United Nations role in ensuring sustainable \r\ndevelopment cannot overlook supporting young people. \r\nThat will help to achieve the Millennium Development \r\nGoals and the post-2015 development agenda. We \r\nwelcome the efforts of the United Nations in establishing \r\nand implementing projects to support young people, in \r\nparticular the most vulnerable groups. In that respect, \r\nBelarus welcomes the Secretary-General’s new global \r\ninitiative on education so as to invest in the next \r\ngeneration. We also call for the support of talented \r\nyoung people to be more actively included in United \r\nNations programmes in order to help educate a new \r\nkind of future leader and manager. We are impressed \r\nby the Secretary-General’s drive to introduce a new \r\nsystem of talent management in the Secretariat.\r\nThe links between development and the \r\nmaintenance of peace and security are clear. Belarus \r\nshares the report’s concern about the lack of progress \r\non resolving disarmament and non-proliferation issues. \r\nFor more than a decade, there has been international \r\nacknowledgement of the need for multilaterally \r\nnegotiated standards that introduce predictability in \r\nthe transfers of conventional weapons and that require \r\nthose exchanges to be carried out in accordance with \r\nthe principles of international law. Such a need stems \r\nfrom various reasons, among which we underscore the \r\nunlawful use of arms, given the norms of international \r\nhumanitarian and human rights law, and the risk of their \r\ndiversion to terrorist or criminal groups. In that regard, \r\nArgentina believes that it is important to complete the \r\nwork of the United Nations Conference on the Arms \r\nTrade Treaty as soon as possible and to adopt a treaty \r\nwithin the framework of the United Nations.\r\nWith regard to strengthening the Organization, \r\nArgentina supports all measures to improve its \r\nadministrative management as long as they come \r\nunder the mechanisms provided for in the budget and \r\nare strategic and in line with the relevant General \r\nAssembly resolutions. Likewise, regarding the \r\nmanagement of human resources, we will closely \r\nconsider the Secretariat’s proposals, taking into account \r\nthe importance of adequately protecting the rights of \r\nstaff and their contractual position. With respect to \r\nthose issues, we believe that close consultation among \r\nMember States is key to the success of any reform \r\nprocess.\r\nMr. Dapkiunas (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): \r\nThe delegation of Belarus notes the businesslike \r\nand constructive nature of the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport (A/67/1). We share the view of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that the main task facing us as the international \r\ncommunity is to lay the foundations for sustainable \r\ndevelopment. \r\nBelarus reaffirms its commitment to the decisions \r\nof the United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment and is ready to contribute to multilateral \r\nefforts to implement those decisions. First and foremost, \r\nthat applies to issues such as drawing up sustainable \r\ndevelopment objectives, strengthening the Economic \r\nand Social Council, technology transfers and technical \r\ncooperation in various fields, including energy.\r\nIt is important not to reverse the sustainable \r\ndevelopment achievements made to date because of the \r\nglobal economic crisis. On the post-2015 development \r\nagenda, we must provide for steps that will make the \r\nachievements of Member States in various development \r\nfields irreversible. Cooperation and development must \r\nbe built on full compliance with the principle of respect \r\n14 12-53869\r\nA/67/PV.22\r\nThe reform of the Organization is more urgent than \r\never. Without it, we will not have an effective toolkit for \r\nthe prevention of global crises. We urge the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to continue to provide valuable assistance to \r\nMember States in their efforts to revitalize the General \r\nAssembly, to strengthen and enhance the transparency \r\nof the Security Council and to expand its membership, \r\nand to reform and strengthen the role of the Economic \r\nand Social Council. We believe that the reform of the \r\nOrganization’s principal organs should be coordinated \r\nand comprehensive. That will ensure the harmony and \r\neffectiveness of the United Nations system.\r\nThe Secretary-General rightly notes in his report \r\nthat the success of our common efforts to uphold the \r\nfundamental principles of the United Nations Charter \r\ndepends on our ability to implement a meaningful \r\nagenda. Belarus hopes that a constructive spirit, \r\nmarked by respect for the positions of States and their \r\napproaches to resolving current issues, will prevail \r\nat this General Assembly session. We trust that such \r\na spirit will enable us to find effective responses to \r\ntoday’s threats and challenges.\r\nMr. Nuñez Mosquera (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nWe thank the Secretary-General for the presentation \r\nof his annual report on the work of the Organization \r\n(A/67/1). The issues addressed by the Secretary-General \r\nin his report are multiple and essential.\r\nCuba attaches great importance to the future \r\nestablishment of the post-2015 development agenda. \r\nThat process should be distinguished by its deeply \r\nintergovernmental, transparent and inclusive nature, \r\nunder the auspices of the General Assembly. The \r\nprocess should critically analyse the reasons for the \r\nfailure to achieve the Millennium Development Goals \r\nand to establish a development agenda that responds to \r\nthe needs and strategies of the countries of the South \r\nthat are the beneficiaries of international cooperation.\r\nInitiatives to improve the functioning of the United \r\nNations system for development, both at Headquarters \r\nand in the field, should be based on agreement among \r\nMember States and be accountable to them. Similarly, \r\nthey should respect the nature and functions of \r\neach institution and ensure the alignment of their \r\nactivities with the national priorities and strategies for \r\ndevelopment of each country. \r\nWe must be very cautious when participating in or \r\nfollowing up on exclusionary agendas and processes \r\nthat have not been agreed upon in the framework of the \r\nWe support the rapid launch of substantive work by the \r\nConference on Disarmament. Its progress will depend \r\non the political will of a group of leading States and of \r\nthe five nuclear Powers. Belarus supports the drafting \r\nof a new international instrument to resolve issues \r\nrelated to the uncontrolled proliferation of conventional \r\narms. \r\nWe share the concerns of the Secretary-General \r\nover the failure of negotiations at the United Nations \r\nConference on the Arms Trade Treaty. Continued \r\nnegotiations as part of the arms trade treaty should \r\nserve as an additional catalyst for the efforts of the \r\ninternational community to solve the urgent issue of the \r\nproliferation of conventional arms.\r\nBelarus underscores the importance of the rule of \r\nlaw as the key to conflict prevention, peacebuilding, \r\nconflict settlement and the maintenance of peace and \r\nsecurity. The recent High-level Meeting of the General \r\nAssembly on that issue and its outcome document \r\n(resolution 67/1) are very significant. We believe that \r\nany initiative concerning conflict prevention and the \r\nprevention of loss of human lives that is submitted for \r\nconsideration must ensure strict compliance with the \r\nprinciples of the rule of law. We underscore the need for \r\nall States to agree on the modalities for such initiatives \r\nbefore their practical implementation.\r\nBelarus supports continued effective cooperation \r\non combating terrorism at all levels within the United \r\nNations system. We underscore the importance of \r\nstrengthening the legal framework for countering \r\nterrorism and of establishing an effective and \r\nnon-selective system for the provision of technical \r\nassistance for State capacity-building and to help States \r\nmeet their commitments. \r\nBelarus values the Secretary-General’s commitment \r\nto combating violence against women and children, \r\nincluding victims of human trafficking. We note with \r\nsatisfaction that the United Nations plays an increasingly \r\nvisible role in the global fight against human trafficking \r\nand that it promotes the forging of constructive \r\ndialogue and cooperation among Member States, the \r\nUnited Nations system, agencies and international \r\norganizations in order to counter that modern form \r\nof slavery. We urge support for the initiative of the \r\nGroup of Friends United against Human Trafficking on \r\nthe convening of a high-level meeting of the General \r\nAssembly in 2013 to assess the implementation of \r\nthe United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat \r\nTrafficking in Persons (resolution 64/293).\r\n12-53869 15\r\nA/67/PV.22\r\nIn the same vein, the incursion by the Security \r\nCouncil into issues that are clearly within the \r\njurisdiction of other bodies of the United Nations \r\nsystem is also of concern, especially their increasing \r\nlinkage to human rights issues mandated to the Human \r\nRights Council and the Third Committee. Concepts \r\nsuch as the responsibility to protect, human security \r\nand preventive diplomacy, inter alia, which are not \r\nclearly defined or intergovernmentally agreed, cannot \r\nbe used as a pretext for interfering in the internal affairs \r\nof States, the violation of their sovereignty, military \r\ninvasion or to promote regime change from the outside.\r\nWith regard to regional arrangements, we believe \r\nthat their role should be in full accordance with Chapter \r\nVIII of the Charter. They cannot substitute for the role \r\nof the Organization, or ignore the strict application \r\nof the basic principles of peacekeeping operations. \r\nThe main responsibility for maintaining international \r\npeace and security lies within the United Nations. The \r\nGeneral Assembly has the primary responsibility for \r\nformulating and assessing concepts and policies on \r\npeacekeeping operations. In that regard, we believe \r\nthat any directive or doctrinal document drawn up by \r\nthe Secretariat that has an impact on the way in which \r\nMember States participate in peacekeeping operations \r\nshould be previously agreed upon through a process of \r\nintergovernmental negotiating.\r\nThe interaction of host countries of peacekeeping \r\noperations with the troop-contributing countries, the \r\nSecretariat and the Security Council must continue to be \r\nstrengthened. Host countries and the troop-contributing \r\ncountries, in most cases, are not guaranteed truly \r\nactive participation in all stages of the decision-making \r\nprocess for peacekeeping operations. We also believe \r\nthat there should be broader coordination between the \r\nSpecial Committee on Peacekeeping Operations and \r\nthe Fifth Committee.\r\nOne of the major challenges that we continue to \r\nface is that of reforming the United Nations so that \r\nit can continue to serve the interests of all nations on \r\nan equal footing. We cannot allow reform to turn our \r\nOrganization into an instrument which acts in the \r\ninterests and on the whims of a few rich and powerful \r\ncountries. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Cuba \r\nindicated at the recently concluded general debate, \r\n“it is urgent to save the United Nations and subject \r\nit to deep-seated reform, so as to put it at the service \r\nof all, equally sovereign States and free it from the \r\nUnited Nations but that nevertheless affect the central \r\nrole of the United Nations and the General Assembly in \r\ntaking the most important international decisions.\r\nFurthermore, we wish to draw the Assembly’s \r\nattention to the plethora of initiatives that have been \r\npresented as intended to reform the United Nations but \r\nthat have had unsatisfactory results or simply have not \r\nproduced any essential change. Before continuing to \r\nmake new proposals for change and reform, the current \r\nprocesses must come to a close and their impact must be \r\nassessed. In that context, we welcome the reorientation \r\nof the enterprise resource planning project (Umoja) after \r\nthe institutional crisis that almost paralysed the costly \r\nupdate of the Organization’s information technology \r\nresources. We hope that the new management of the \r\nproject will bring it to a successful conclusion. Also, we \r\nmust hope that the conclusion of ongoing construction \r\nprojects, such as the Capital Master Plan, will come to \r\nan end before we start new ones. \r\nWe welcome the dialogue of the Secretariat with \r\nMember States, which is essential in addressing the \r\nreforms and administrative and budgetary processes \r\nof the Organization. In that context, the accountability \r\nof the Secretariat at all levels is of great importance. \r\nResolution 66/257 is clear about the requirements \r\nto renew accountability by the Secretariat. We have \r\nexpressed our concerns at some reports made by the \r\nGroup of 77 and China, which indicate what appear to \r\nbe duplications of functions.\r\nAllow me to highlight the launch of the \r\nintergovernmental process to strengthen and improve \r\nthe effective functioning of the system of human rights \r\ntreaty bodies, which occurred at the last session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. We have supported the process since \r\nits inception. A few weeks ago, it concluded its first \r\ncycle of consultations, and negotiations will continue \r\nthroughout the current session.\r\nWith regard to human rights, we are concerned over \r\nthe ongoing imbalance in the way they are dealt with \r\nwithin the United Nations system. Economic, social and \r\ncultural rights continue to be sidelined. Furthermore, \r\nwe deplore the increasingly extended exploitation of \r\nthe issue of human rights in the Human Rights Council \r\nand other settings of the United Nations to politicize, \r\ncherry-pick and manipulate opinion against certain \r\ndeveloping countries, while systematic violations of \r\nhuman rights that take place in other countries, in \r\nparticular developed countries, are ignored. \r\n16 12-53869\r\nA/67/PV.22\r\narbitrariness and double standards of a handful of \r\nindustrialized and powerful countries. \r\n“International law and the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations should \r\nbe resolutely enforced; the key role of the General \r\nAssembly should be restored; and a democratic, \r\ntransparent and truly representative Security \r\nCouncil should be relaunched” (A/67/PV.19, p. 10). \r\nWe cannot speak of the true reform of the \r\nOrganization as long as there is no real reform of the \r\nSecurity Council. This year showed that the process \r\nof intergovernmental negotiations for the reform of \r\nthe Council is at a stalemate. We urgently need a truly \r\nequitable and representative Security Council that \r\nacts on behalf of all and within its mandate under the \r\nCharter, without usurping, as it does with increasing \r\nfrequency, the functions and prerogatives of other \r\nbodies of the system.\r\nThere are still more than 20,000 nuclear weapons \r\nin the world, and more than 7,000 of them are ready \r\nfor immediate deployment — and they are far more \r\npowerful than those that wreaked terror and death on the \r\nJapanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Completely \r\nbanning and eliminating all nuclear weapons continues \r\nto be an urgent unfulfilled duty.\r\nThose are some of the elements that we wanted to \r\nto raise in connection with the item before us. We will \r\nexpand on our ideas in discussions in the Committees.\r\nSerious challenges lie ahead of us. The world needs \r\nthe United Nations and unified action on our part more \r\nthan ever. Cuba will continue to work tirelessly for a \r\nbetter world for everyone.\r\nMr. Tarar (Pakistan): As we start our work for \r\nthis session, we are guided by our leaders who, in the \r\ngeneral debate, shared their perspectives on the global \r\nchallenges that we face, the opportunities that we must \r\nseize and the collective action that we must mobilize for \r\nour common good, peace and prosperity. They clearly \r\nreaffirmed and acknowledged that the United Nations \r\nwas the key to the success of that endeavour.\r\nThe central role of the United Nations is evident \r\nfrom the annual report of the Secretary-General on \r\nthe work of the Organization (A/67/1). We thank the \r\nSecretary-General for his report, which provides a \r\nuseful overview of the range of activities of the United \r\nNations in the three pillars of work — peace and \r\nsecurity, development and human rights.\r\nThe United Nations has indeed a demanding \r\nagenda. I would like to take this opportunity to express \r\nour appreciation for the energy and strong leadership \r\nthat Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has brought to \r\nour work. We support his efforts to adjust and realign \r\nthe Organization’s structures to enable it to effectively \r\ntackle the contemporary threats and challenges. We \r\nalso commend his commitment to building bridges and \r\nbringing the membership together in the pursuit of our \r\nshared goals and objectives.\r\nPakistan supports the activities of the United \r\nNations. We have contributed to the collective efforts \r\nof the United Nations constructively and consistently. I \r\nassure the President of the Assembly and the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that Pakistan will always be in the forefront of \r\nsupport for the United Nations.\r\nFaltering economic growth is leading to growing \r\nunemployment across the globe. The sovereign debt \r\ncrisis runs the risk of spreading to other economies. The \r\nUnited Nations system must come together in forging a \r\nresponse to the ongoing economic crisis. It is not enough \r\nto seek solutions in exclusive gatherings. We need an \r\ninclusive United Nations development agenda that is in \r\nsync with the imperatives of poverty eradication, green \r\neconomic growth and sustainable development. That \r\nshould remain an overarching priority.\r\nWe are pleased to note the thrust of the report on \r\nprogress in achieving the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs). However, that progress has been uneven. \r\nAs we move towards 2015 and beyond, it is critical for \r\nthe United Nations system as a whole to keep in mind the \r\nlessons learned from the implementation of the MDGs. \r\nWe also need to ensure that new processes, including \r\nthe elaboration of the sustainable development goals, \r\nwill build on the MDGs.\r\nPakistan remains committed to accelerating \r\nprogress on achieving the MDGs. We would like the \r\nUnited Nations system to help Pakistan navigate \r\nthrough its own challenges. To that end, we would \r\nalso invite the high-level panel on the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda to undertake a special review of \r\nthe circumstances that countries like my own are facing \r\nin achieving the MDGs.\r\nPakistan supports the Secretary-General’s \r\nSustainable Energy for All initiative. We would, in \r\nfact, like to benefit from the initiative and to work \r\nwith the Secretary-General’s Office and Mr. Kandeh \r\n12-53869 17\r\nA/67/PV.22\r\nYumkella of the United Nations Industrial Development \r\nOrganization to develop a plan of action for Pakistan.\r\nPakistan welcomes the agreement reached at the \r\nUnited Nations Conference on Sustainable Development \r\n(resolution 66/288, annex). Notwithstanding the \r\ndifficulties, we succeeded in laying a solid basis for \r\nachieving “The future we want”. As the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report correctly points out, the international \r\ncommunity must deal with that challenge head-on, \r\nparticularly when it comes to arresting and halting \r\nthe negative trends in climate change. Even though \r\nPakistan is closely engaged in negotiating the future \r\nlegal framework by 2015, we do not think that efforts \r\nat addressing climate change must come to a halt until \r\nthe time we manage to reach that agreement. Such \r\nan approach, as apparently suggested by some major \r\npolluters, would be disastrous for vulnerable developing \r\ncountries.\r\nWe agree with the Secretary-General that the \r\nOrganization will not be able to meet the demands \r\nand expectations in regard to the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security without the necessary \r\nresources and equitable global burden sharing. Over the \r\nyears, Pakistan has provided concrete support for the \r\nwork of the United Nations and for achieving success on \r\ninternational peace and security as a leading contributor \r\nof personnel to United Nations peacekeeping missions, \r\nparticularly in Africa.\r\nCurrently, as a non-permanent member of the \r\nSecurity Council serving for the seventh time, \r\nPakistan will continue to play its constructive role in \r\nconsolidating the successes achieved in many situations \r\nand addressing the challenges that remain in so many \r\nothers. We are particularly conscious of the urgency of \r\nthe situations in Syria and Mali.\r\nWe take this opportunity to call for a renewed \r\npolitical commitment to United Nations peacekeeping \r\nand for the provision of adequate and timely resources. \r\nThe long-overdue issue of troop-cost reimbursement \r\nmust also be updated as a matter of priority. I should also \r\nemphasize that the adjustment of the size and mandates \r\nof missions must be done carefully and correspond to \r\nthe specific requirements and trajectories in different \r\nsituations. We must also utilize the true potential of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission.\r\nWe appreciate the continued involvement and \r\noversight of the United Nations in Jammu and Kashmir \r\nthrough its peacekeeping mission, the United Nations \r\nMilitary Observer Group in India and Pakistan. We \r\nbelieve that the peaceful settlement of long-standing \r\ndisputes, as those of Palestine and Jammu and Kashmir, \r\nwill help promote international peace and stability and \r\nenhance the prestige and sanctity of the United Nations.\r\nPakistan has an unwavering commitment to \r\nAfrica. From our support to the continent’s struggle \r\nfor decolonization, to our cooperation and assistance in \r\ncapacity-building, to our participation in peacekeeping, \r\nwe have all along stood with Africa. We commend \r\nAfrica’s own leadership and initiatives in addressing its \r\nchallenges and will continue to support all international \r\nefforts for peace and development on the continent.\r\nDisarmament and non-proliferation are mutually \r\nreinforcing processes, which must be pursued in \r\ntandem while respecting the right to equal security for \r\nall States. In seeking ways to overcome the deadlock \r\nin the Conference on Disarmament, it is imperative \r\nto acknowledge and address the underlying security \r\nconcerns of all States. Pakistan will continue to support \r\nthe international community’s efforts geared towards \r\nnuclear safety and nuclear security. We reiterate our \r\ncall for the convening of a special session of the General \r\nAssembly to craft a new consensus on the disarmament \r\nand non-proliferation agenda and machinery. \r\nPakistan is committed to the promotion and \r\nprotection of human rights. More than ever before, it has \r\nbecome essential to avoid selectivity and to genuinely \r\npromote all human rights — civil and political, as well \r\nas economic, social and cultural rights, including the \r\nright to development.\r\nWe appreciate the coordination role played by the \r\nUnited Nations in humanitarian assistance, of which \r\nPakistan itself has been a major beneficiary. We \r\ntake note of the launch of the Inter-Agency Standing \r\nCommittee Transformative Agenda, which tackles the \r\nchallenges and lessons learned from the humanitarian \r\nresponses to Haiti and Pakistan. An inclusive and \r\nconsultative approach remains critical for effective \r\nhumanitarian work.\r\nWe are cognizant of the increasing threat to peace \r\nand security posed by organized crime, drug trafficking \r\nand terrorism. The funding and fuelling of terrorism \r\nthrough illicit drug trafficking has emerged as a major \r\nproblem. Pakistan will hold a regional conference later \r\nthis year to develop a unified approach to stamp out the \r\ndrug trade.\r\n18 12-53869\r\nA/67/PV.22\r\nThe sociopolitical upheaval in West Asia and North \r\nAfrica since last year has unleashed profound change \r\nand transition with which the region is still coming \r\nto terms. India is very concerned at the escalating \r\nsituation in Syria. We support United Nations efforts \r\nto find a solution to the crisis through dialogue and an \r\ninclusive, Syrian-led political process.\r\nIt is a matter of regret that the question of Palestine \r\nremains unresolved, and we support the Palestinians’ \r\nrequest for enhanced status at the United Nations. India \r\nfirmly supports the aspirations of the Palestinian people \r\nto achieve a sovereign, independent, viable and united \r\nState of Palestine, with East Jerusalem as its capital, \r\nliving within secure and recognized borders side by \r\nside and at peace with Israel.\r\nEven as we approach the 2015 finish line for the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, there is already haste \r\nto look to the post-2015 agenda. The quest for poverty \r\neradication and sustainable development remains \r\nas salient as ever. Significant roadblocks still stand \r\nin the way of food and energy security, health and \r\neducation for much of the developing world. Countries \r\nare only tentatively emerging from the shadow of the \r\nworst economic and financial crisis since the Great \r\nDepression. The magnitude of the challenge is driven \r\nhome by the fact that more than a billion people \r\nworldwide continue to languish in extreme poverty and \r\nhunger.\r\nOne thing is abundantly clear — unmet \r\ndevelopment priorities must be well integrated into the \r\npost-2015 framework. The United Nations Conference \r\non Sustainable Development handed us a robust \r\nagenda on sustainable development. We must now \r\ntrain our energies on the best way to implement it in an \r\nintergovernmental setting. As we embark on a process \r\nof framing sustainable development goals, crucial \r\nissues — such as that of resource mobilization, be it \r\nthrough official development assistance, technology \r\ntransfer, trade or foreign direct investment — must find \r\nappropriate priority and be enshrined in the principles \r\nof common but differentiated responsibilities and \r\nequity.\r\nOn climate change, India will work with others \r\nto design a comprehensive, equitable and balanced \r\noutcome at the upcoming eighteenth session of the \r\nConference of the Parties to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change, to be held \r\nin Doha, Qatar. We ourselves are currently hosting the \r\neleventh Conference of Parties to the Convention on \r\nInternational counter-terrorism efforts will require \r\ncontinued cooperation and coordination among Member \r\nStates. At the same time, the role of the United Nations \r\nwill remain crucial and it will need to be adequately \r\nprepared for the challenge.\r\nOur objective of international harmony will be best \r\nserved by promoting understanding among religions \r\nand civilizations. The recent deliberate incidents of \r\ndefamation of Islam and our Prophet — peace and the \r\nblessings of Allah be upon him — remind us of the \r\nneed to discourage and combat such acts. We appreciate \r\nthe Secretary-General’s forthright stance on those \r\nincidents. As President Zardari said in this address to \r\nthe General Assembly: \r\n“Although we can never condone violence, the \r\ninternational community must not remain a silent \r\nobserver and should criminalize such acts, which \r\ndestroy the peace of the world and endanger global \r\nsecurity by abusing the freedom of expression. \r\nPakistan asks that the United Nations immediately \r\naddress this matter of great alarm and concern \r\nand bridge the widening rift in order to enable the \r\ncomity of nations to be one again.” (A/67/PV.7, p. 23) \r\nThe common good lies in pursuing policies and \r\nactions that will make us all stakeholders in each \r\nother’s futures. Cooperation, not confrontation, is the \r\nanswer to the many problems that we face.\r\nThe United Nations is the best mechanism to promote \r\ncooperative multilateralism. It is in our collective \r\ninterest to adapt, equip, reform and strengthen the \r\nUnited Nations to play its role effectively. We remain \r\ncommitted to achieving this objective with the support \r\nand consensus of all Member States.\r\nMr. Ahamed (India): I am privileged to address \r\nthe General Assembly today. Allow me to begin by \r\ncongratulating Mr. Vuk Jeremić on assuming the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh \r\nsession.\r\nThe annual report of the Secretary-General on \r\nthe work of the Organization (A/67/1) covers the wide \r\nspectrum of issues that inform the activities of the United \r\nNations. It underscores the global and interdependent \r\nnature of the challenges we face. It shines a spotlight \r\non the unfinished agenda of development and reform. \r\nIt points to the turbulent times we live in. It reinforces \r\nour conviction that the need of the hour is genuine \r\nmultilateralism.\r\n12-53869 19\r\nA/67/PV.22\r\nreform the Secretariat, including through large-scale \r\nbusiness transformation projects such as the new \r\nenterprise resource planning system, Umoja; the \r\nInternational Public Sector Accounting Standards; \r\nand the Capital Master Plan. While each involves \r\nconsiderable investment, we see them as important \r\ndrivers in modernizing the United Nations. \r\nNevertheless, it is our deep-rooted conviction \r\nthat the relevance of the United Nations ultimately \r\nhinges on more fundamental reform of its governance \r\narchitecture, which is frozen in another era that \r\nperpetuates the rights of the haves of the mid-1940s. \r\nIt is only through such governance reform that the \r\nUnited Nations can truly invigorate action on issues \r\nof pressing global concern, be they peace and security, \r\nclimate change, development or all human rights.\r\nLet me therefore conclude by raising something that \r\ninexplicably is not mentioned in the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport. That is the important issue of Security Council \r\nreform, on which intergovernmental negotiations \r\nhave seen much movement and a clear affirmation by \r\nan overwhelming majority of the Member States for \r\nexpansion in both the permanent and non-permanent \r\ncategories. We regard the omission of the progress made \r\nin the intergovernmental negotiations on the issue as a \r\nsignificant drawback of the Secretary-General’s report. \r\nWe hope to see it corrected in future reports.\r\nIn terms of the process itself, India looks forward \r\nto capitalizing on the momentum generated so far to see \r\nreal, fruitful and productive negotiations in the current \r\nsession of the General Assembly on that important \r\nreform.\r\nMr. Wang Min (China) (spoke in Chinese): The \r\nChinese delegation welcomes Secretary-General \r\nBan Ki-moon’s report on the work of the Organization \r\n(A/67/1).\r\nToday, the world is undergoing important \r\nand profound changes. Multipolarity, economic \r\nglobalization and the spread of information technology \r\nin society are all developing in depth. All countries \r\nare interconnected and more interdependent than ever \r\nbefore. Peace, development and cooperation are the \r\ngeneral wishes shared and pursued tirelessly by the \r\npeoples of all countries. At the same time, the deep \r\nimpact of international economic and fi nancial crises are \r\nfar from over. The recovery of the world economy faces \r\nrisks, which calls into question the on-time realization \r\nof the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). \r\nBiological Diversity. Our expectation is that all parties \r\nwill work for a strong development-oriented outcome \r\nand for the early implementation of the Nagoya \r\nProtocol to ensure the equitable sharing of the benefits \r\nof biodiversity.\r\nIn so far as our development partnership initiatives \r\ngo, we are resolved to carry forward and expand our \r\nmultifaceted and vibrant cooperation with Africa, \r\nincluding through the framework of the India-Africa \r\nForum Summit. Similarly, we will continue to build on \r\nour commitments for enhanced cooperation with least \r\ndeveloped countries, landlocked developing countries \r\nand small island developing States, within the rubric of \r\nSouth-South cooperation.\r\nThe international community has long acknowledged \r\nthe ever-present and pervasive threat posed by \r\nterrorism. No country, city or region is immune from \r\nthis global scourge. And yet, regrettably, we have \r\nfailed by continuing to procrastinate in concluding a \r\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism. \r\nIt is high time that Member States summoned the \r\nnecessary political will to agree on such a convention as \r\na sound legal framework for the fight against terrorism. \r\nWe need concerted global action. Such action should \r\nbe predicated on zero tolerance towards terrorism and \r\naimed at systematically dismantling its infrastructure.\r\nIndia has a proud and time-tested association with \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping dating back to its very \r\ninception. We have contributed over 130,000 personnel \r\nso far to this f lagship endeavour of the United Nations. \r\nAs peacekeeping moves forward, we must remain \r\nmindful of the challenges of operating in increasingly \r\ncomplex environments. Particular attention should be \r\npaid to ensuring that complex mandates are matched \r\nby adequate resources so as to get the job done safely \r\nand effectively. In this process, it is of the utmost \r\nimportance that there be real, effective and continuous \r\nconsultation with troop-contributing countries in \r\nframing and implementing mandates.\r\nIt is also not lost on us that, if it is to be enduringly \r\nsuccessful, peacekeeping must be seamlessly dovetailed \r\nwith peacebuilding efforts. The United Nations needs to \r\npay better attention to evolving a cogent and coherent \r\npeacebuilding framework that takes into account the \r\ncapacities at hand and the complexities on the ground.\r\nI should like to make one final remark regarding \r\nthe Secretary-General’s internal reform efforts. We \r\nhave taken note of the initiatives to modernize and \r\n20 12-53869\r\nA/67/PV.22\r\nthe Charter of the United Nations and the basic norms \r\ngoverning international relations. State sovereignty \r\nand territorial integrity cannot be violated, and the \r\npost-Second World War international order cannot be \r\nchallenged.\r\nMember States also need to respect the solemn \r\nprinciples of equality and non-interference in \r\ninternal affairs and should espect countries’ rights \r\nto autonomously choose their social systems and \r\napproaches to development. The United Nations should \r\nadvocate and promote a culture of peace and support \r\nthe settlement of disputes by peaceful means, including \r\nthrough dialogue and negotiations.\r\nTerrorism is a common thread facing the \r\ninternational community. China opposes all forms \r\nof terrorism. In fighting terrorism, it is necessary to \r\nrenounce double standards. It is a noble goal to protect \r\nhuman rights and to protect innocent civilians from \r\nharm, but no State may forcibly pursue change in the \r\nname of humanitarian intervention. We should respect \r\ndiversity in the world. The international community \r\nshould further advocate dialogue, exchanges, mutual \r\nrespect and equal coexistence among different \r\ncivilizations and religions.\r\nIn the face of those new developments, it is the \r\ngeneral expectation of the international community \r\nthat the United Nations should play a greater role \r\nin maintaining world peace, promoting common \r\ndevelopment and strengthening international cooperation. \r\nChina supports the Organization’s efforts to carry \r\nout necessary and sound reforms so as to improve \r\nits authority and efficiency and to better perform the \r\nmandates entrusted to it by the Charter. United Nations \r\nreforms should give developing countries a greater say \r\nin international affairs and help the Organization play \r\na bigger role in coordinating international efforts to \r\nrespond to the new global threats and challenges. It is \r\nnecessary to proceed in a balanced way with reforms \r\nin areas of security, development and human rights. \r\nIt is especially necessary to promote positive results \r\nin the area of development and to provide necessary \r\nsafeguards for development in terms of mechanisms \r\nand resources.\r\nChina has always advocated, supported and \r\npractised multilateralism and has supported the core \r\nrole of the United Nations in international affairs. \r\nChina will continue to actively participate in all areas \r\nof United Nations work, to safeguard the authority of \r\nthe United Nations and to firmly support the purposes \r\nThe international security situation is complex. \r\nRegional hotspot issues keep on emerging here and \r\nthere. Turbulence in West Asia and North Africa \r\npersists. The prospect for nuclear non-proliferation \r\nremains grim. Both traditional and non-traditional \r\nsecurity problems are interwoven. \r\nIn the past year, in the face of multifaceted threats \r\nand challenges, the United Nations has been actively \r\npromoting multilateral cooperation and has played \r\nan important role in promoting economic growth and \r\nsustainable development, safeguarding international \r\npeace and security, promoting and protecting human \r\nrights, coordinating international humanitarian \r\nassistance, combating terrorism, and promoting \r\ndisarmament and nuclear non-proliferation.\r\nThe next five-year programme of action proposed \r\nby the Secretary-General has also made initial progress. \r\nI would like to take the opportunity to express our \r\nappreciation for his diligent work in the past year.\r\nIt is necessary for the United Nations to continue to \r\nplay a coordinating role in development. As economic \r\nglobalization is deepening, the interests of Member \r\nStates are further integrated. We need to expand \r\nareas of cooperation and improve the mechanisms for \r\nthat purpose in the interest of a balanced, generally \r\nbeneficial and win-win development of economic \r\nglobalization. We need to further promote the \r\ndevelopment of developing countries and narrow the \r\ngap between North and South so that the benefit of \r\ndevelopment can be shared by all peoples in the world.\r\nAt present, we need to earnestly implement the \r\noutcome and consensus reached at the United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development and promote \r\nprogress in international cooperation for sustainable \r\ndevelopment. To actively implement the MDGs, the \r\nUnited Nations needs to explore the formulation \r\nof a post-2015 international development agenda. \r\nThe Organization should take development and the \r\neradication of poverty as its core objectives and engage \r\nin open, transparent and democratic intergovernmental \r\nconsultations. It should also allow civil society, the \r\nprivate sector and others to play an active role.\r\nTo effectively respond to complex and varied \r\nsecurity threats and challenges, it is necessary to \r\nfully explore the core role of the United Nations in \r\nmaintaining international peace and security. In \r\ninternational relations, Member States should continue \r\nto steadfastly adhere to the purposes and principles of \r\n12-53869 21\r\nA/67/PV.22\r\nThe outcome of Rio+20 (resolution 66/288, annex) \r\nreaffirmed our collective commitment to sustainable \r\ndevelopment and launched a series of essential \r\nprocesses to make that goal a reality. The development \r\nof sustainable development goals will require our \r\ncooperative efforts. The goals must be consistent \r\nwith the principle of common but differentiated \r\nresponsibilities and must allow for f lexibility in order \r\nto accommodate the specificities and priorities of \r\ndeveloping countries. \r\nEqually important are the mandates for the \r\nestablishment of the high-level political forum, the \r\nintergovernmental process on options for an effective \r\nstrategy for financing sustainable development, and the \r\nfacilitation mechanism that promotes the development, \r\ntransfer and dissemination of clean and environmentally \r\nsound technologies. We must pursue them in earnest.\r\nWith regard to peace and security, political \r\ninstability and emerging conflicts continue to pose a \r\nserious threat to regional and international security in \r\nmany parts of the world. United Nations peacekeeping \r\noperations continue to be one of the most crucial aspects \r\nof the Organization’s work for millions of people \r\naround the world. We strongly support the continued \r\npartnership among the troop- and police-contributing \r\ncountries, the General Assembly, the Security Council \r\nand the Secretariat to make peacekeeping more effective. \r\nProgress must be achieved in bringing peacekeeping \r\nand peacebuilding activities together, in improving \r\nthe interaction of United Nations missions with the \r\nlocal population and in enhancing the protection of \r\ncivilians. One challenge of particular importance today \r\nis how to address the complex problems of security \r\nand development in ways that are distinct yet mutually \r\nreinforcing.\r\nWith regard to the development of Africa, the \r\ncontinent remains a key priority of the Organization’s \r\nwork. Brazil continues to be an engaged partner of \r\nAfrican countries in their endeavour to maintain peace, \r\nto protect human rights, to promote economic growth and \r\nto achieve sustainable development. We are following \r\nwith great interest the increasing collaboration between \r\nthe United Nations and African institutions, such as \r\nthe African Union and regional organizations. We are \r\nalso confident that the Organization can play a decisive \r\nrole in advocating for enhanced cooperation with the \r\nAfrican continent in the implementation of the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development.\r\nand principles of the Charter, ensuring that in its work \r\nthe Organization pays greater attention to the interests \r\nof developing countries so that it can make an even \r\ngreater contribution to building lasting peace, common \r\nprosperity and world harmony.\r\nMr. Dos Santos (Brazil): I wish to thank Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for his comprehensive report \r\non the work of the Organization (A/67/1). It describes \r\nthe activities of the United Nations during a period in \r\nwhich the world’s demands on and expectations of the \r\nUnited Nations remain very high.\r\nIn facing today’s most pressing global challenges, \r\nstrengthening multilateralism must be at the forefront \r\nof our plans and actions. We must all endeavour to \r\nrevitalize the work of the General Assembly through \r\nconcrete initiatives. The Security Council must be \r\nreformed and expanded to reflect the current political \r\nrealities and to allow for greater participation by \r\ndeveloping countries, including as permanent members. \r\nAllow me make a few comments on specific issues.\r\nAs we approach 2015, we must accelerate our \r\nefforts towards the achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. The international community \r\nmust make good on its commitments on the transfer \r\nof technology and the sharing of good practices, \r\nknowledge and experience, and on support for national \r\ncapacity-building, especially for countries that are \r\nlagging behind.\r\nAt the same time, we must start work on the post-\r\n2015 development agenda. We are confident that the \r\nSecretary-General’s High-level Panel of Eminent \r\nPersons will provide an important input for Member \r\nStates to deepen and broaden the set of development \r\ngoals in a manner that reflects the most pressing \r\nchallenges faced by the international community and \r\nthat helps to build the strong international partnership \r\nand cooperation framework and the financial and \r\npolitical support needed to achieve those goals.\r\nThe United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (Rio+20) was a crucial milestone on the \r\nroad towards sustainable development. The agreement \r\nthat we reached in Rio reinforced multilateralism. I \r\nwish to take this opportunity to sincerely thank the \r\nSecretary-General and all United Nations staff for their \r\nunwavering support and for their close collaboration, \r\nwhich made Rio+20 the largest and most inclusive \r\nconference in the history of the United Nations.\r\n22 12-53869\r\nA/67/PV.22\r\nmoving faster and requires a rapid response. The \r\nproblems that we face today are simply too complex \r\nto be solved by Governments alone. They require \r\ncollective, coordinated, enhanced cooperation and a \r\nmore participatory decision-making process. In that \r\nregard, we welcome the Secretary-General’s plan to \r\ndevelop a comprehensive proposal that seeks to harness \r\nthe power of partnership.\r\nFirst, on the issue of peacekeeping, we strongly \r\nsupport intensified strengthening of United Nations \r\nstrategic and operational collaboration with regional \r\norganizations such as the African Union, the \r\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development and the \r\nEconomic Community of West African States with \r\nrespect to peacekeeping operations. In that regard, I \r\nwish to reaffirm Ethiopia’s commitment, as the largest \r\nAfrican troop-contributing country to United Nations \r\npeacekeeping efforts, to continue working together \r\nwith the United Nations and the African Union to \r\nrealize peace and security in Africa and elsewhere.\r\nSecondly, we commend the Secretary-General’s \r\ncontinued commitment to Africa. Despite the \r\nconsiderable progress achieved in the past 10 years, \r\nAfrica continues to face significant challenges in the \r\narea of peace and security, as well as socioeconomic \r\ndevelopment. Hence, there is a need for concerted \r\naction by the international community to contribute \r\ntowards alleviating the development challenges of \r\nAfrica. Obviously, Africa has been negatively affected \r\nby the global economic situation. No part of the world \r\nis immune to the consequences of the global economic \r\ndownturn, and for obvious reasons, the least developed \r\ncountries, the majority of whom are African, are \r\naffected. \r\nDespite those factors, we have made much progress \r\nin the past decades. We are on track on many of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). In fact, our \r\nachievements regarding Goal 1, on poverty alleviation, \r\nGoal 2, on universal primary education, and Goal \r\n3, on gender equality and women’s empowerment, \r\nare encouraging. During the three years remaining \r\nto achieve the MDGs, Ethiopia will continue its \r\ncommitment to eradicating extreme poverty and hunger \r\nby continuing to improve the productivity and output \r\nof smallholder agriculture and to enhance the income \r\nof the rural population. Ethiopia’s resource allocation \r\nhas been guided by the Government’s pro-poor growth \r\npolicy, whereby the lion’s share of available resources \r\nis allocated for spending on the poor. In 2011, the share \r\nHuman rights is a basic pillar of the United Nations \r\nand a central part of its work. Brazil’s commitment \r\nto the promotion of the rights of the human person \r\nis unwavering. The United Nations must strive to \r\noperate in a non-selective and constructive manner, \r\nwhile maintaining the capacity to address situations of \r\nparticular concern.\r\nWith regard to the responsibility to protect, we \r\nemphasize the importance of prevention. Whenever \r\nforceful collective action is contemplated, after \r\nexhausting all non-coercive measures, there is a need to \r\npromote responsibility while protecting as a necessary \r\ncomplement to the responsibility to protect. \r\nRegarding strengthening the Organization, Brazil \r\nsupports efforts to make the United Nations more \r\neffective, efficient and responsive to the needs of \r\nMember States. In that regard, we look forward to the \r\nconsideration by the Fifth Committee of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s proposals in the areas of administrative reform \r\nand change management. We welcome a process of \r\ntransparent and open communication between Member \r\nStates and the Secretariat. That is key to ensuring \r\nsuccessful reforms. We also highlight the importance of \r\nimproving the transparency of the budgetary process, \r\nparticularly with regard to voluntary contributions. \r\nThe Secretary-General has stated that human \r\nresources management, in particular mobility, is a \r\npriority for the Organization. We agree with him. It is \r\nessential that the Organization have access to a talented, \r\nmulti-skilled, motivated and diverse workforce. In \r\nthat regard, Brazil will engage constructively in the \r\ndiscussions on the Secretary-General’s proposals for \r\nmobility, with due regard for the need for equitable \r\ngeographic representation in the Secretariat.\r\nBrazil will continue to be actively and constructively \r\nengaged in the work of the Organization.\r\nMs. Dibaco (Ethiopia): At the outset, allow me to \r\nexpress once again my delegation’s congratulations to \r\nMr. Jeremić on his election as President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-seventh session. \r\nMy delegation also wishes to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his comprehensive report on the work of \r\nthe Organization (A/67/1). The report describes the \r\nprogress that the Organization has made over the past \r\nyear on the eight long-term global priorities identified \r\nby Member States. As illustrated in the report, the \r\nglobal political, economic and social situation is \r\n12-53869 23\r\nA/67/PV.22\r\nI would like to conclude by thanking the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and the staff of the United Nations for a job \r\nwell done, both at Headquarters and in the field.\r\nMs. Díaz Mendoza (Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela) (spoke in Spanish): The Bolivarian Republic \r\nof Venezuela salutes Secretary-General Mr. Ban \r\nKi-moon and thanks him for presenting his annual \r\nreport on the work of the Organization (A/67/1) to the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nThe Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela reaffirms \r\nits commitment to peace, justice, solidarity and \r\ndevelopment. We are convinced that the full realization \r\nof those objectives requires unrestricted respect for \r\ninternational law, in accordance with the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nThroughout its history, the United Nations has \r\nrecorded important achievements in the area of the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes. However, its record \r\nis not free of failures or limitations. Those can be \r\nattributed to lack of agreement among Member States, \r\nespecially in relation to the actions of hegemonic \r\nPowers that have tried to impose their agendas to the \r\ndetriment of the sovereignty, self-determination and \r\ncollective interests of peoples and Governments that do \r\nnot support neoliberalism and seek a life in the concert \r\nof the United Nations \r\nThe role of the United Nations in the search for \r\npeaceful settlements of disputes that affect international \r\npeace and security must be framed within the purposes \r\nand principles of the Charter that are expressed in \r\nnon-interference in the internal affairs of States, the \r\nsovereign equality of States, non-use of force or threat \r\nof force against the territorial integrity or political \r\nindependence of any State, and respect for sovereignty.\r\nThe creation of favourable economic and social \r\nconditions is fundamental to settling disputes, \r\nwhich are generated by poverty, social exclusion and \r\nracism — powerful breeding grounds for crises with \r\nrepercussions for international peace and security. \r\nBut it is also evident that those countries where social \r\njustice and the eradication of hunger and poverty are \r\ntaking shape or are progressively prevailing are being \r\nharassed, intimidated, blasphemed and manipulated \r\nfor not being examples of the injustices that capitalism \r\ncreates with its brutal and neoliberal methods. That has \r\nbeen the case of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. \r\nThe Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela condemns \r\nthe threat of or use of force to resolve disputes. It \r\nof pro-poor spending stood above 13 per cent of gross \r\ndomestic product. \r\nThirdly, climate change is a global phenomenon \r\nthat will continue to affect Ethiopia’s efforts to \r\nachieve the MDGs and its vision of sustained long-\r\nterm growth and development to eradicate poverty. \r\nClearly, the international community must tackle the \r\ndifficult task of reconciling the challenge of mitigating \r\nand adapting to climate change while supporting the \r\ngrowth priorities of developing countries. To do so, it \r\nmust mobilize financial and technological resources \r\nfar beyond historical levels, especially for the least \r\ndeveloped countries. \r\nAccording to the Secretary-General’s report, \r\nclimate change is already having an impact on people. \r\nExtreme weather events have increased in frequency \r\nand intensity. In 2011, globally, some 106 million \r\npeople were hit by f loods and 60 million were affected \r\nby drought. In that regard, I would like to express \r\nEthiopia’s commitment to working with Member States \r\nto secure resources and a global binding agreement \r\ncommensurate with the threat and impact of climate \r\nchange by 2015, as agreed in Durban. \r\nFourthly, in the area of human rights, I fully agree \r\nwith the comments just made by the representative of \r\nBrazil. The Human Rights Council must operate in \r\na non-selective and constructive manner, especially \r\nthrough the universal periodic review, while maintaining \r\nthe capacity to address situations of particular concern. \r\nIn our view, human rights are most effectively ensured \r\nby dialogue and cooperation. Ethiopia is now prepared \r\nto engage directly in the process through membership \r\nin the Human Rights Council, for which we seek the \r\nsupport of the United Nations membership during the \r\nelection in November.\r\nThe continuing terrorist attacks remind us that \r\nterrorism remains one of the most serious threats to all \r\nStates and peoples. No cause or grievance can justify an \r\nact of terrorism. The third biennial review of the United \r\nNations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy concluded \r\nin June with an agreement to develop national and \r\nregional strategy implementation plans that enhance \r\ncapacity-building efforts, including the Integrated \r\nAssistance for Countering Terrorism Initiative. The \r\nGeneral Assembly should keep up the momentum \r\nand make every effort to reach an agreement on the \r\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism.\r\n24 12-53869\r\nA/67/PV.22\r\nWe believe that the United Nations must promote a \r\nmodel of sustainable development based on such values \r\nas solidarity, justice, social inclusion, equality, respect \r\nfor human rights and civic participation. There must \r\nbe respect for the diversity of systems and approaches. \r\nEach State has a sovereign right to implement these in \r\norder to achieve its objectives in terms of development, \r\nprosperity and the well-being of its people. In a world \r\nthat is increasingly interrelated, this right is crucial in \r\nrelations and cooperation among States in the pursuit of \r\na peaceful, prosperous world. \r\nVenezuela supports initiatives on dialogue and \r\ncoexistence between civilizations and religions as \r\nimportant elements to support international efforts \r\nto promote dialogue and diversity on the basis of \r\njustice, brotherhood and equality. Such efforts must \r\noppose any attempt to impose monoculturalism or \r\nspecific political, economic, social, legal or cultural \r\ndevelopment models; instead, they should promote \r\ndialogue between civilizations, the culture of peace \r\nand interfaith dialogues that will contribute to peace, \r\nsecurity, stability and development. \r\nWe also support the promotion of a culture of \r\npeace based on the respect for the sovereignty and \r\nterritorial integrity of States, non-interference in the \r\ninternal affairs of States, the right to self-determination \r\nof peoples under foreign occupation and colonial \r\ndomination, the prevention of violence, the promotion \r\nof non-violence, strict adherence to the principles \r\nof international relations enshrined in the United \r\nNations Charter, and the full exercise of the right to \r\ndevelopment. \r\nIn that respect, the establishment of a culture of \r\npeace in the world is unquestionably related to the \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals. \r\nAt least 2.5 billion people survive on less than €2 a \r\nday, 854 million go hungry, 144 million children of \r\nschool age do not go to school, 11 million children \r\nunder 5 years of age die every year, 2.4 billion people \r\nhave no access to safe drinking water, and 3 million \r\ndie of HIV/AIDS every year. When we take into \r\naccount the impact of war and social conflicts in some \r\nareas of the world and the alarming effects of climate \r\nchange, f loods, earthquakes, forest fires and so on, it is \r\nimpossible to speak of peace in the world. \r\nReform of the United Nations, especially its main \r\norgans, is a pending task that must be addressed in \r\norder to strengthen the Organization. The General \r\ntherefore categorically rejects military interventions \r\ncarried out by the imperial Powers and their allies. \r\nVenezuela is concerned about the role of the Security \r\nCouncil with regard to the unilateral use of force under \r\nthe pretext of legitimate defence and, more recently, \r\nunder the misnomer “responsibility to protect”, in clear \r\nviolation of the purposes and principles of the Charter \r\nof the United Nations.\r\nSyria, as was Libya, is the object of meddling \r\nby the imperial Powers and their allies, who \r\nsupport — through training, financing, political \r\nsupport and weapons — armed groups that have \r\nbeen compromised by committing acts of violence \r\nthat have caused the deaths of thousands of civilians. \r\nThe Venezuelan Government highlights the need to \r\nencourage dialogue between the parties to the conflict \r\nand reach a resolution to the conflict that is agreed \r\nbetween the parties themselves, free from foreign \r\ninterference. This will create a stable climate conducive \r\nto the strengthening of democracy and the political \r\nreforms encouraged by President Al-Assad. \r\nThe new global reality presents new challenges \r\nto the common goal of building a new international \r\norder under the auspices of the United Nations that \r\nis multipolar, fair and equitable and characterized by \r\nconsensual and inclusive multilateralism. Developing \r\ncountries find themselves facing a serious social, \r\neconomic and political crisis and a new offensive \r\non the part of imperial Powers, which are trying to \r\nundermine the foundation of solidarity between peoples \r\nand attempting once again to impose their strategic \r\ninterests, undermining our aspirations to peace, justice, \r\ndevelopment, solidarity and cooperation. Humankind \r\nfaces a complex and dynamic situation in which the \r\npolitical and economic elites of the world refuse to \r\nset aside their selfish, partial views at a time when the \r\nreality of issues that involve the destiny of peoples must \r\nbe addressed in a comprehensive manner and in a spirit \r\nof dialogue and solidarity. \r\nThe economic and political realities of our times \r\nhave demonstrated that the global crisis of capitalism is \r\nstructural in nature and calls for a radical change in the \r\nunfair economic and financial order. The Bretton Woods \r\ninstitutions have failed, as evidenced by the crisis in \r\nEurope and other countries of the North. The situation \r\ncalls for the building of a new financial architecture on \r\nthe basis of inclusive multilateralism that expresses the \r\ninterests of all the peoples of the world. \r\n12-53869 25\r\nA/67/PV.22\r\nas the United Nations, where all States in the family of \r\nnations have a say in how best to achieve the common \r\ngood. \r\nWhile this increasing trend makes short-term \r\nagreements easier to achieve, it makes long-term global \r\ndevelopment, peace and security, and the other noble \r\nresponsibilities of the United Nations more difficult \r\nto achieve. It is therefore imperative that all actors, \r\nwhether they be States, civil society organizations \r\nor religious institutions, renew their commitment \r\nto fostering greater trust among one another and \r\nrecommit themselves to working together to address the \r\nchallenges of our time so that the authentic objectives \r\nof this institution may be fulfilled.\r\nAs the Assembly prepares for the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda, the Holy See looks forward to \r\nworking with delegations to ensure that the proposed \r\nsustainable development goals are capable of addressing \r\nthe challenges of the world in a manner that places the \r\nhuman person at the centre of concern, rather than \r\nviewing the person as an obstacle to development. That \r\nmodel must recognize that the aim of development is \r\nnot simply economic growth, but a true growth of the \r\nentire human person in all its dimensions, including its \r\nintellectual, spiritual or physical development.\r\nIn addition, we must recognize that in order to \r\nfoster a human-centred development model, we must \r\nwork to ensure that this labour is done in a manner \r\nthat respects the relationship between humankind and \r\nthe environment and our role as responsible stewards \r\nof creation. That relationship requires recognition \r\nthat care for the environment, human prosperity and \r\ndevelopment are not mutually exclusive concepts. \r\nRather, responsible concern for the environment \r\nrequires recognition that all members of society have \r\na responsibility to be good stewards of our planet so \r\nthat we can fulfil our accountability to each other and \r\nsucceeding generations.\r\nWhen human rights are not based on their natural \r\nmoral and ethical foundation, they can become a tool \r\nnot for the liberation of peoples, but for suppressing \r\ndiscussion about rights and what they constitute, and \r\nthe promotion of so-called human rights that promote \r\nthe taking of life itself. That tragic consequence can \r\nbe seen in many regions of the world and in some \r\norganizations, where the right to life of the unborn or \r\nthe lives of the elderly or the disabled are seen not as \r\na paramount and inviolable right to be safeguarded, \r\nbut rather as a secondary right that must be subjugated \r\nAssembly must be revitalized in accordance with the \r\nfunctions given to it by the Charter in terms of peace \r\nand security, sustainable development, human rights \r\nand international cooperation, taking its democratic, \r\nrepresentative and universal nature into account. We \r\nalso believe that the Security Council must be reformed \r\nin order to make it more democratic, transparent and \r\nlegitimate, in line with the reality of current times. \r\nThe anachronistic right of veto must be eliminated \r\nand the principle of the sovereign equality of States \r\nupheld. Countries of the developing world in Africa, \r\nLatin America and the Caribbean and Asia must be \r\nadded as new permanent members. The Economic and \r\nSocial Council must fulfil its tasks as the main policy \r\ncoordination body in the economic and social areas, in \r\naccordance with the tasks assigned to it by the Charter \r\nat its establishment.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the observer \r\nof the Observer State of the Holy See. \r\nArchbishop Chullikatt (Holy See): As the \r\nSecretary-General notes in his report (A/67/1), it was \r\n70 years ago that world leaders united to adopt the \r\npurposes and principles that continue to guide this \r\ninstitution. These principles were valid then, and \r\nthey remain compelling today. While the succeeding \r\nyears since the founding of the Organization have \r\nseen progress in many areas of its mandate, still today \r\ntoo many long for a world free of war, where legal \r\nsystems are just, where everyone’s life is respected, \r\nprotected and defended, where Governments and other \r\ninstitutions affecting the international order are held \r\naccountable, and where basic health and nutrition are \r\nan expected right rather than an elusive dream.\r\nThe United Nations continues to face a number \r\nof additional challenges in fulfilling its mandate, but \r\nat the heart of these challenges is the need to foster \r\ntrust — trust between nations, trust within society, \r\nand trust that those in positions of power will carry \r\nout their mandate in a way that promotes the common \r\ngood for all of society rather than only to advance self-\r\nseeking interests. Today, this trust remains elusive \r\nand, rather than working together to restore such trust, \r\nwe increasingly see major decisions on issues such \r\nas international security, disarmament, protection of \r\nthe environment, international financial governance, \r\ninternational trade, population, health care, food \r\nsecurity and human rights being made in venues in \r\nwhich those in power can more easily dictate the terms \r\nof the agreement rather than in an organization, such \r\n26 12-53869\r\nA/67/PV.22\r\nnations will lead to a more prosperous and peaceful \r\nworld. Let us join in unambiguous concert to promote \r\nthat trust so that, together, we will fulfil our duty to \r\nachieve the objectives for which this great Organization \r\nwas established.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on this item. \r\nI shall now give the f loor to those representatives \r\nwho wish to speak in exercise of the right of reply. \r\nMay I remind members that statements in exercise \r\nof the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes for the \r\nfirst intervention, and to five minutes for the second \r\nintervention, and should be made by delegations from \r\ntheir seats.\r\nMrs. Khampa (India): I am taking the f loor to \r\nexercise India’s right of reply. The representative of \r\nPakistan has regrettably made a gratuitous reference, \r\ntotally out of context, to the state of Jammu and Kashmir, \r\nwhich is an integral part of India. Such remarks deserve \r\nto be rejected in their entirety.\r\nMr. Tarar (Pakistan): With reference to what \r\nwe have heard just now, I think “gratuitous” is a \r\nrather favoured word with the Indian delegation and \r\nit is something that we hear every time Kashmir is \r\nmentioned. Suffice it to say that vocabulary cannot be a \r\nsubstitute for truth. If that were the case, Noah Webster \r\nwould be a prophet. I will just confine myself to giving \r\nthe advice that we should not tackle important, long-\r\nstanding, festering issues like that of Kashmir by just \r\ntrying to cast them aside with such casual remarks. \r\nMrs. Khampa (India): I am taking the f loor \r\nagain to exercise our second right of reply in response \r\nto the untenable references made once again by the \r\nrepresentative of Pakistan about the Indian state of \r\nJammu and Kashmir, which is and has always been an \r\nintegral part of India. We reject those remarks, which \r\nhave no place in this Assembly. \r\nMr. Tarar (Pakistan): Lest repetition create the \r\nillusion of veracity, I would just like to draw the attention \r\nof the Assembly to the exchanges we have had with the \r\nIndian delegation previously on this subject during the \r\nongoing sixty-seventh session of the Assembly, which \r\nwould bring out the truth of the matter. Again, I do \r\nnot wish to further dignify these mechanical retorts \r\non an issue of such grave international importance, \r\nas underlined by various resolutions of the Security \r\nCouncil, which remain unimplemented to this day.\r\nto other so-called human rights that are not based on \r\nthe natural moral law. To respect the right to life from \r\nthe moment of conception to natural death is not an \r\ninfringement of rights, but rather the fulfilment of our \r\npromise as leaders of nations to recognize the inherent \r\ndignity of all members of the human family, no matter \r\nhow young, or how frail, or how helpless.\r\nLikewise, the right to religious freedom remains \r\nelusive in many parts of the world. In many corners of \r\nthe globe, the very practice or profession of one’s faith \r\nis deemed unwelcome, illegal or blasphemous. Even in \r\nthe great democracies of the world, we see today that \r\nthis first freedom is under attack. The right to religious \r\nfreedom encompasses not only the right to hold one’s \r\nfaith in private, but also the freedom to preach, to \r\neducate, to evangelize and to contribute to the political \r\nand social discourse in order to achieve the common \r\ngood. That public profession of an individual’s faith \r\nshould not be seen as a danger to democratic governance \r\nor as a violation of a public safety that requires \r\nlimitation; rather, it must be understood and accepted \r\nas a welcome addition to the debates that foster vibrant \r\nand healthy Governments and societies which claim or \r\ndesire to be equal members of the international order.\r\nTherefore, it is imperative that leaders of this \r\ninstitution and its Member States make every effort to \r\nensure that human rights are applied and interpreted in \r\na way that fosters trust within society and within this \r\ninstitution. Efforts to radically redefine or reinterpret \r\nhuman rights using a reductionist and relativist notion \r\nof humankind or by relying on ambiguous terminology \r\nwill lead in the end to a breakdown in trust in those \r\nbodies mandated to upholding human rights. Such \r\nattempts, moreover, foster distrust between nations \r\nand result in a world where basic human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms are challenged rather than \r\nprotected. \r\nIn order to respect those rights, the United Nations \r\nand its membership must work collectively to recommit \r\nthemselves to the visions set out in the Charter and in \r\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights so as to \r\nreaffirm the transcendent dignity of the human person, \r\nnot in theory or as a secondary factor, but rather as \r\nthe foundation upon which true and genuine respect \r\nfor human rights, development and lasting peace and \r\nsecurity can take root.\r\nIn conclusion, this institution was founded in large \r\npart on the belief that fostering greater trust between \r\n12-53869 27\r\nA/67/PV.22\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly has thus \r\nconcluded this stage of its consideration of agenda item \r\n106.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.50 p.m.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that the \r\nGeneral Assembly takes note of the report of the \r\nSecretary-General on the work of the Organization, \r\ncontained in document A/67/1?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\n"
