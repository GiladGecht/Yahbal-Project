The Fifth Committee adopted \r\nthe draft resolution entitled “Scale of assessments \r\nfor the apportionment of the expenses of the United \r\nNations: requests under Article 19 of the Charter” \r\nwithout a vote. May I take it that the Assembly wishes \r\nto do the same?\r\nThe draft resolution was adopted (resolution 67/2).\r\nThe President: The Assembly has thus concluded \r\nthis stage of its consideration of agenda item 134.\r\nAgenda items 115 and 116\r\nImplementation of the resolutions of the \r\nUnited Nations\r\nRevitalization of the work of the \r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nThe President: I welcome this opportunity to \r\naddress the Assembly at the start of the debate on \r\nhow to further strengthen the authority of the General \r\nAssembly. This is the only body in which all countries \r\ncome together as sovereign equals to advance the aims \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations. To be able to meet \r\nthe expectations of humankind, we must continue with \r\nthe process of revitalizing and modernizing it.\r\nThe topic we are focusing on today is not a new one. \r\nAs early as in 1948, the General Assembly recognized \r\nfor the first time the need to adapt to changing \r\ncircumstances. Near the end of the third session — in \r\nfact, one day after the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights was adopted — an additional item was placed \r\non the agenda of the plenary. It called for the creation \r\nof an ad hoc committee to consider methods and \r\nprocedures which would enable the General Assembly \r\nto discharge its functions more effectively and \r\nexpeditiously. Decades later, we continue to try to \r\nmake headway in what has always been understood as \r\na work in progress.\r\nLet me begin by thanking Mr. Alexander \r\nLomaia, Permanent Representative of Georgia, and \r\nMrs. Susan Waffa-Ogoo, Permanent Representative of \r\nthe Gambia, for leading the Ad Hoc Working Group on \r\nUnited Nations A/67/PV.23\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-seventh session\r\n23rd plenary meeting\r\nThursday, 11 October 2012, 10 a.m.\r\nNew York\r\nOffi cial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Jeremić . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Serbia)\r\n2 12-54292\r\nA/67/PV.23\r\nthe Revitalization of the General Assembly during the \r\nsixty-sixth session. Its report, contained in document \r\nA/66/891, together with resolution 66/294, adopted by \r\nconsensus on the final day of that session, will guide \r\nour deliberations over the coming year.\r\nFor the first time, the two agenda items being \r\ndiscussed today have been scheduled to immediately \r\nfollow the Secretary-General’s report on the work of \r\nthe Organization. This was done to highlight their \r\nimportance for the General Assembly. I believe it is \r\ncritical for Member States to consistently implement \r\nthat which has already been agreed in the Hall. That \r\nshould be a core principle of effective multilateralism \r\nin the twenty-first century.\r\nDuring this session, the Ad Hoc Working Group is \r\nmandated to review the inventory of General Assembly \r\nresolutions on revitalization, and to issue an updated \r\nversion in its report to the plenary. It is my sincere \r\nhope that the findings of the review will suggest \r\nthat we are moving in the right direction. So far, we \r\nhave made some progress in a number of areas and, \r\nas President, I will work tirelessly to ensure that the \r\nprocess is further enhanced. I have already begun to \r\nbuild closer relationships with the other main bodies \r\nof the United Nations. I have started to exchange views \r\nwith the Secretary-General, the Presidents of the \r\nSecurity Council and Economic and Social Council, \r\nand the Heads of various United Nations entities and \r\nspecialized agencies, as well as with the Chairs of the \r\nMain Committees. Yesterday, in fact, I met with this \r\nlast group. I thanked those in attendance for their \r\ncommitment to our shared goals, and reiterated my \r\nbelief that their deliberations are critical to advancing \r\nthe plenary’s agenda.\r\nThe increasing number of informal thematic debates \r\nand high-level events has contributed to the relevance \r\nof this body in addressing a growing number of global \r\nissues. As mandated by resolution 66/294, I will consult \r\nwith Member States on the topics to be discussed, with \r\na view to achieving results-oriented outcomes at the \r\nsixty-seventh session. As President, I will continue the \r\ntradition established by my predecessors and convene \r\ninformal meetings of the plenary before and after \r\nGroup of 20 (G-20) preparatory meetings, as well as the \r\nannual Heads of State or Government Summit.\r\nIn my view, however, we should work on increasing \r\nthe complementarity of both policies and actions \r\nbetween the United Nations and key international \r\neconomic players. It is with this in mind that I have \r\nproposed to launch a process leading to the establishment \r\nof an effective consultative framework between the \r\nGeneral Assembly and international financial and \r\ntrade institutions, as well as groupings such as the \r\nG-20. I believe that if we do this in the right way, the \r\nkey actors’ decisions can actually help strengthen and \r\nfurther revitalize the General Assembly.\r\nThe issue before us today has been on the \r\nGeneral Assembly’s agenda for decades, and some \r\nbreakthroughs have been made. But I believe that much \r\nmore needs to be done. Let us take a step back for a \r\nmoment and consider the overall context in which the \r\nprocess of revitalization is taking place. Whether in the \r\npolitical, economic or technological realm, the world is \r\nbecoming increasingly volatile and unpredictable. The \r\noverall scope and rapidity of the transformations we \r\nface are unprecedented in the annals of history. This \r\nglobal trend is likely to continue well into the future.\r\nThe speed of the changes taking place outside these \r\nwalls is increasingly outpacing the tempo of the changes \r\nwe are able to agree upon in this building. To retain \r\nthe capacity to change the world for the better, we will \r\nneed to find the strength to keep changing ourselves.I \r\nam afraid that we are confronted with the choice of \r\neither adapting to the new times, or simply being left \r\nbehind to watch the gap between our duties and our \r\ncapabilities widen by the day. I am not advocating \r\nhaste or revolution, but I am trying to instil a sense of \r\nurgency. \r\nI have tremendous faith in the United Nations. It is \r\ndoubtless the greatest humanist project of the twentieth \r\ncentury, and I firmly believe that its greatness should \r\nextend well into the twenty-first. But that is not going \r\nto happen by default. A bold action is needed. It is up \r\nto the Member States — and to the Member States \r\nonly — to propose and decide how to move forward. \r\nI was elected to serve them, to serve the General \r\nAssembly, and I pledge my unwavering commitment \r\nto its endeavours. I believe we all are in favour of \r\nrevitalizing and thereby strengthening the authority of \r\nthe Assembly. Yet, as the nineteenth-century Scottish \r\nsocial commentator Thomas Carlyle succinctly put \r\nit, conviction is worthless unless it is converted into \r\nconduct. \r\nSo let us conduct ourselves with the courage of our \r\nconvictions. Let us revitalize this institution so that \r\nit remains, in the words of the Charter, a centre for \r\nharmonizing the actions of nations. \r\n12-54292 3\r\nA/67/PV.23\r\nIn our view, new ideas on how to explore further ways \r\nand means of reinvigorating the process in order to give \r\nit a higher profile warrant our consideration.\r\nThe Non-Aligned Movement emphasizes the need to \r\nfully respect the functions and powers of each principal \r\norgan of the United Nations, in particular the General \r\nAssembly, and to maintain the balance among the \r\norgans within their respective Charter-based functions \r\nand powers. In that regard, the Security Council must \r\nfully observe all Charter provisions as well as all \r\nAssembly resolutions which clarify its relationship \r\nwith the Assembly and other principal organs.\r\nNAM reiterates its concern, raised at previous \r\nsessions, about the continuous attempt by the Security \r\nCouncil to encroach upon the powers and prerogatives \r\nof the General Assembly. Article 24 of the Charter does \r\nnot endow the Security Council with the competence to \r\naddress issues that fall within the functions and powers \r\nof the General Assembly and the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil.\r\nIn the same vein, NAM calls on the Security \r\nCouncil to submit a more explanatory, comprehensive \r\nand analytical annual report to the General Assembly, \r\nassessing the work of the Council. Furthermore, the \r\nMovement is convinced that activities of the Special \r\nCommittee on the Charter of the United Nations and \r\non the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization \r\nwill contribute greatly to the whole process of \r\nrevitalization and supports the initiative of the creation \r\nof an open-ended working group to study the proper \r\nimplementation of the Charter with respect to the \r\nfunctional relationship of its main organs, in particular \r\nthe General Assembly, the Security Council and the \r\nEconomic and Social Council, as well as the initiative, \r\nunder the aforementioned Special Committee, on \r\nstrengthening the role of the Organization and \r\nenhancing its effectiveness.\r\nWe reaffirm the role and authority of the General \r\nAssembly, including in questions related to international \r\npeace and security, and its intergovernmental, \r\ninclusive and democratic character, which have \r\nimmensely contributed to the promotion of the \r\npurposes and principles of the Charter and the goals \r\nof the Organization. The Movement also reaffirms the \r\nintergovernmental nature of the United Nations as such \r\nand underscores the necessity to consult with Member \r\nStates on initiatives and activities undertaken within \r\nthe Organization and the right of all Member States to \r\nMr. Benmehidi (Algeria): I thank you, \r\nMr. President, for convening this meeting. On behalf of \r\nthe members of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), I \r\nwould like to thank you, Sir, for the level of priority you \r\nintend to dedicate to the issue of the revitalization of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and for having taken the initiative \r\nto start with that important topic immediately after the \r\nreport of the Secretary-General (A/67/1). You can count \r\non the Non-Aligned Movement to further convey the \r\nmessage thereof. \r\nAt the outset, allow me to express the gratitude of the \r\nmembers of the Non-Aligned Movement to Ambassador \r\nSusan Waffa-Ogoo, Permanent Representative of \r\nthe Gambia, and Ambassador Alexander Lomaia, \r\nPermanent Representative of Georgia, for their tireless \r\nefforts and excellent work in co-chairing the Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group on the Revitalization of the General \r\nAssembly during the sixty-sixth session.\r\nNAM welcomes the adoption of resolution 66/294 \r\nlast September, by which the Assembly established \r\nthe Working Group to discuss the issues related to \r\nthe Assembly’s revitalization during the sixty-seventh \r\nsession, and to continue, in particular, to build on the \r\nprogress achieved at past Assembly sessions and on \r\nprevious resolutions, and to assess the status of their \r\nimplementation.\r\nThat assessment and a clear identification of the \r\nunderlying causes behind any lack of implementation \r\nare of utmost importance if we are to progressively \r\neliminate the constraints that continue to prevent the \r\nprocess of revitalizing the General Assembly from \r\nrealizing its full potential. In that regard, the Movement \r\nreaffirms the validity and relevance of its principled \r\npositions related to the process and reiterates its \r\nwillingness to contribute effectively and constructively \r\nto the activities of the Working Group with a view to \r\nidentifying ways and means to strengthen the role and \r\nauthority of the Assembly.\r\nWe underline that the revitalization process is of \r\na political nature, aimed mainly at strengthening the \r\nrole of the General Assembly as the chief deliberative \r\npolicymaking and representative organ in the wider \r\nUnited Nations system. The Movement therefore \r\nreiterates the importance of the revitalization of the \r\nAssembly as an item that deserves consideration on an \r\nequal footing with other important topics and welcomes \r\nthe President’s decision y to address it at the beginning \r\nof the current session, so that we can make better use of \r\ntoday’s deliberations in ourwork throughout the session. \r\n4 12-54292\r\nA/67/PV.23\r\nexpress their positions before the Assembly at any time \r\nthey wish to do so.\r\nThe General Assembly, as the policymaking \r\norgan of the Organization, holds the authority and the \r\nessential role of drafting the framework, upholding \r\nthe principles and identifying the objectives of the \r\nwider United Nations system and its numerous organs, \r\nagencies and programmes. Furthermore, the Assembly \r\nshould remain the principal organ that reviews the \r\nwork of all its subsidiary organs and bodies. It should \r\nmaintain its role and mandate in setting the priorities \r\nof the United Nations in considering all budgetary and \r\nadministrative issues and reforms, including its absolute \r\nauthority to allocate and reallocate financial and human \r\nresources, and in the appointment of senior officials \r\nof the Secretariat, in accordance with the Charter \r\nand relevant Assembly resolutions. In that regard, the \r\nprerogatives of the Assembly, as the chief oversight \r\norgan of the Organization, including on management \r\nand procurement for peacekeeping operations, must be \r\nrespected.\r\nWhile expressing its readiness to continue to \r\nsupport all ongoing efforts to strengthen the central \r\nrole and authority of the General Assembly, NAM \r\nwishes to state that it will oppose any approach that \r\nseeks to undermine or minimize the achievements of \r\nthe Assembly, diminish its current role and functioning \r\nor raise questions about its relevance and credibility.\r\nIt is clear that while the prerogatives of the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly have not changed, \r\nhis role and activities have evolved over the past years, \r\nin adapting to the growing activities, conferences \r\nand initiatives of the Assembly, performing official \r\nprotocol functions, representing the Assembly around \r\nthe world, and making the Assembly’s work better \r\nknown and more visible. Therefore, the activities of the \r\nOffice of the President of the General Assembly have \r\nincreased drastically over the years. The agenda of the \r\nAssembly and consequently that of its President include \r\na tremendous number of issues. \r\nThe expansion of activities of the General \r\nAssembly — including the yearly adoption of more or \r\nless 300 resolutions and decisions, the establishment of \r\nworking groups and facilitations that convene meetings \r\nand consultations throughout the year — has made the \r\nPresident’s presence and active participation necessary \r\nduring the whole session. The Assembly’s workload \r\nis no longer limited to the main part of its session but \r\nrather covers the whole period from the opening of the \r\nsession in September to its closing. This tremendous \r\nand increasing activity should of course be matched \r\nwith the necessary resources, both human and financial.\r\nNAM recalls in this regard that resolution 66/294 \r\nrequests the Secretary-General to submit proposals, in \r\nthe context of the proposed programme budget for the \r\nbiennium 2014-2015, to review the budget allocations \r\nto the Office of the President of General Assembly, and \r\nemphasizes the importance of ensuring the effectiveness \r\nof the Office, including through the strengthening of its \r\ninstitutional memory. While noting with appreciation \r\nthe progress already achieved in that regard, we are of \r\nthe view that a particular effort should be devoted to \r\nthe implementation of the already existing resolutions \r\non this matter, as well as to identifying, during the \r\nupcoming discussions of the Working Group, ways and \r\nmeans to pursue this objective progressively and with \r\ndetermination.\r\nAmong other prerogatives and mandates of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, the selection and appointment of \r\nSecretaries-General of the United Nations is of utmost \r\nimportance. As for future Secretary-General mandates, \r\nNAM reaffirms the need for the selection of the \r\nSecretary-General to be transparent to and inclusive \r\nof all Member States and emphasizes, therefore, the \r\nneed for the Assembly’s participation in the selection \r\nand appointment of the Secretary-General to be more \r\nactive, effective and efficient, in conformity with the \r\nCharter of the United Nations and in accordance with \r\nthe provisions of its resolutions 51/241, 60/286, 64/301 \r\nand 66/294. NAM stresses the importance of the full \r\nimplementation of those resolutions in the process of \r\nthe selection and appointment of the next Secretary-\r\nGeneral.\r\nIn conclusion, we reaffirm that a reinvigorated \r\nGeneral Assembly, fully exerting its role and authority \r\nin a more responsive environment, would significantly \r\ncontribute to the strengthening of the wider United \r\nNations system and to the improvement of international \r\ngovernance and enhancement of multilateralism.\r\nThe President: I call on the observer of the \r\nEuropean Union.\r\nMr. Tricot (European Union): I have the honour to \r\nspeak on behalf of the European Union and its member \r\nStates.\r\nThe European Union and its member States are \r\nstrongly attached to effective multilateralism, with \r\nthe United Nations at its core. In this context, we are \r\n12-54292 5\r\nA/67/PV.23\r\ncommitted to revitalization and to supporting efforts \r\naimed at strengthening the role and authority of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, in line with the Charter of the United \r\nNations and relevant resolutions. It is our wish that \r\nthe General Assembly, as the only intergovernmental \r\nbody with universal membership, be able to take up the \r\nchallenge of conciliating legitimacy and efficiency in a \r\ncontext of emerging global challenges.\r\nWe believe that revitalization can be ensured only \r\nwhen the General Assembly takes relevant action \r\non issues of common concern to the international \r\ncommunity. Ву doing so, it lives up to its role as one of \r\nthe principal organs of the United Nations.\r\nThe European Union and its member States \r\nwelcome the adoption of resolution 66/294. We would \r\nlike to stress the importance of the implementation of \r\nall the Assembly’s resolutions, including those on the \r\nrevitalization of its work, and note the impact of such \r\nimplementation on the authority, effectiveness and \r\nefficiency of the General Assembly. The revitalization \r\nof the Assembly’s work is clearly interlinked with the \r\noverall reform of the United Nations.\r\nI would like to assure the Assembly that the \r\nEuropean Union and its member States will continue to \r\nengage in a pragmatic manner in all future proceedings \r\non the matter.\r\nMr. Advani (India): Let me begin by congratulating \r\nyou, Sir, upon your assumption of the presidency of \r\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. You \r\ncarry an enormous responsibility on your shoulders, \r\nand I wish you the very best for the year ahead.\r\nMany of us with long living memories thought that \r\nthe decade that ended in 2010 was the most challenging \r\nthe international community had witnessed since the \r\nSecond World War. But today we know better. Never \r\nbefore has the need for enduring calm and certainty in \r\ninternational relations been felt as ardently as over the \r\npast few years. The political upheaval in West Asia, the \r\nGulf and North Africa that began in early 2011 and is \r\nstill continuing is unprecedented, in terms of both scale \r\nand impact. The ongoing global financial and economic \r\ncrisis, which began in the developed world and spread \r\nsouthwards, has exposed the downside of globalization \r\nand seriously undermined the Cold War-era structures \r\nof global governance.\r\nOur responses to the most challenging sociopolitical \r\nand economic crises of the past 50 years cannot be \r\npatchy and half-hearted. The process should begin here \r\nat the United Nations and must be guided by a sense of \r\nurgency.\r\nToday, I was listening very carefully to you, Sir, \r\nwhen you made your introductory remarks, and I fully \r\nagree with what you had to say regarding the urgency \r\nof what we propose to do today. To quote what you said \r\nthis morning: \r\n“I am afraid we are confronted with the choice \r\nof either adapting to new times or simply being left \r\nbehind to watch the gap between our duties and our \r\ncapabilities widen by the day. I am not advocating \r\nhaste or revolution, but I am trying to instil a sense \r\nof urgency.”\r\nThe ongoing global financial and economic crisis is \r\ncertainly asking us to do this immediately. \r\nFirst and foremost, the deficit in global governance \r\nmust be addressed. The Security Council, whose \r\nstructure and set of governing norms harken back to the \r\nrealities of the late 1940s, is, I stress, an anachronism. \r\nFor the Council to reflect current geopolitical realities, \r\nit needs to be expanded in both the permanent and \r\nnon-permanent categories. A reformed Council must \r\ninclude countries that are willing to bear additional \r\nburdens relating to the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security and be able to sustain worldwide \r\ncampaigns against new and emerging global threats, \r\nincluding terrorism and piracy. That is exactly what \r\nyou stressed, Sir, when you said that the gap between \r\nour duties and capabilities is widening by the day.\r\nNext, we need to revitalize the General Assembly. \r\nWe need to change it from a mere talking shop to a \r\nplace where transnational issues that impact each and \r\nevery one of us are addressed swiftly and truly global \r\nsolutions prescribed. We therefore appreciate the \r\nimportance that you, Sir, have attached to this issue. \r\nYou told Member States on the first day of the current \r\nsession, on 18 September 2012: \r\n“To revitalize this most universal of multilateral \r\ninstitutions is to renew our faith not only in the \r\nUnited Nations programmes and purposes, but also \r\nin each other. Member States can count on me to \r\nassist and facilitate in advancing the revitalization \r\nagenda, including the Security Council reform \r\nprocess” (A/67/PV.1, p. 3).\r\nWe welcome your resolve, Mr. President. You can \r\ncount on India’s support in this regard.\r\n6 12-54292\r\nA/67/PV.23\r\nThe starting point of my delegation’s position \r\nis the firm belief that the General Assembly can \r\nbe revitalized only when its position as the chief \r\ndeliberative, policymaking and representative organ of \r\nthe United Nations is respected, both in letter and in \r\nspirit. The Assembly should take the lead in setting the \r\nglobal agenda and restoring the centrality of the United \r\nNations in the formulation of multilateral approaches \r\nto resolving transnational issues. In particular, \r\nrevitalization must restore the primacy of the United \r\nNations in development matters.\r\nWithout prejudging the proceedings of the Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group, which should start soon, I would like \r\nto place on record the Indian delegation’s considered \r\nviews on the two agenda items under consideration \r\ntoday.\r\nFirst of all, it is critical that we establish a \r\nrespectful relationship between the General Assembly \r\nand the Security Council with regard to their respective \r\nmandates, in the spirit of the Charter. The Council \r\nshould not encroach upon the Assembly’s mandate \r\nthrough extremely wide and permissive interpretations \r\nof what constitutes a threat to international peace and \r\nsecurity, breaches of the peace and acts of aggression, \r\nand of the situations under which it can take action \r\nunder Chapter VII of the Charter. The Assembly’s \r\ncompetence in areas such as the process of standard-\r\nsetting and codification of international law must be \r\nscrupulously respected.\r\nIt is clear that the Council’s agenda is overburdened, \r\nto say the least, because it has anointed itself with \r\nthe responsibility of dealing with issues that, though \r\nseemingly important, leave it with less time to deal \r\nwith the real hotspots that constitute the real threats to \r\ninternational peace and security. The balance between \r\nthe Assembly and the Council is only one of the \r\ndimensions of what needs to be addressed.\r\nSecondly, the Assembly, we believe, must have a \r\ngreater say in the process of selecting the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. The continued circumscription of the \r\nAssembly’s role and responsibilities in the process of \r\nselecting and appointing the Secretary-General needs to \r\nchange in the interests of the United Nations system in \r\ngeneral and the Assembly’s prerogatives in particular.\r\nWe could also identify objective criteria for \r\ncandidatures, including commitment to the purposes \r\nand principles of the Charter and extensive leadership, \r\nadministrative and diplomatic experience, with due \r\nregard being given to regional rotation and gender \r\nequality. It would be equally useful and practical to \r\nencourage the formal presentation of candidatures in a \r\nmanner that allows sufficient time for interaction with \r\nMember States and also requires candidates to present \r\ntheir views to all members of the General Assembly.\r\nThirdly, the Assembly and the other entities \r\nthat form part of the United Nations system must \r\nreflect diplomatic best practices in their day-to-day \r\nfunctioning. They have a lot to learn from Member \r\nStates in this regard.\r\nIn conclusion, let me re-emphasize the need to \r\ndiscuss substantive measures that would strengthen the \r\nrole of the General Assembly as the chief deliberative, \r\npolicy-making and representative body of the \r\ninternational community. The General Assembly can \r\nexpect India’s constructive support and participation in \r\nthese efforts.\r\nMr. Khalil (Egypt): Egypt associates itself with \r\nthe statement delivered earlier by the representative of \r\nAlgeria on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement.\r\nAt the outset, I would like to express Egypt’s \r\nappreciation of your decision, Mr. President, to include \r\nthe revitalization of the work of the General Assembly \r\nat the top of your priorities during the sixty-seventh \r\nsession, and for your pledge to assist in advancing the \r\nrevitalization agenda.\r\nI take this opportunity to thank the Permanent \r\nRepresentatives of the Gambia and Georgia for their \r\nefforts as co-Chairs of the Ad Hoc Working Group on \r\nthe Revitalization of the Work of the General Assembly \r\nduring the sixty-sixth session, which led to the adoption \r\nof resolution 66/294. That resolution and the report \r\n(A/67/891) represent a strong basis for the discussions \r\nduring the current session.\r\nThe increasing challenges facing our world today \r\nrequire, more than ever, a strong and responsive \r\nGeneral Assembly, so that this universal body may \r\nplay its leading role in global governance in the \r\npolitical, economical and social spheres. For more \r\nthan two decades, Member States have adopted by \r\nconsensus resolutions containing specific measures \r\nto revitalize the work of the General Assembly as the \r\nmain deliberative, policy-making and representative \r\nprincipal organ of the United Nations. These measures \r\nwere not fully implemented, due to the lack of political \r\n12-54292 7\r\nA/67/PV.23\r\nwill to ensure that the Assembly fulfils its mandate \r\naccording to the Charter.\r\nEgypt believes that the first step towards achieving \r\ntangible progress in the revitalization of the Assembly \r\nis to transform decisions into actions. The Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group should continue to evaluate the status \r\nof implementation of the provisions of all previously \r\nadopted resolutions to identify the obstacles hindering \r\ntheir implementation, and then specify what should be \r\ndone to overcome them. One of the main obstacles facing \r\nthe revitalization of the work of the Assembly is the \r\nSecurity Council’s continued encroachment on its role \r\nand functions. The Council tends to redefine the scope \r\nof its competence through a broader interpretation of \r\nthe issues that may constitute a threat to international \r\npeace and security.\r\nWe should strive to establish a mutually reinforcing \r\nand complementary relationship between the principal \r\norgans of the United Nations. It is not sufficient to \r\nclaim that each individual body performs its functions \r\nin accordance with the Charter. It is necessary to \r\npromote greater coordination among them. The General \r\nAssembly should not be a mere forum for deliberations. \r\nIt must also be a forum for finding solutions. It should \r\nassume a more proactive role in responding to emerging \r\nchallenges of common concern to the international \r\ncommunity. The adoption of resolutions 66/253 A and \r\n66/253 B on the situation in Syria shows clearly that \r\nthe Assembly can make decisions where the Council \r\ncannot.\r\nAs the current Chair of the Arab Group, Egypt, \r\nalong with all the members of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement, is eager to see the State of Palestine become \r\na full Member of the United Nations. The least we can \r\nexpect at this stage of the current session is that the \r\nGeneral Assembly will adopt a resolution to upgrade \r\nPalestine’s status to that of a non-member observer \r\nState at the United Nations, proving that the Assembly \r\nsupports the principles of justice and equality without \r\nselectivity or politicization.\r\nEgypt also commends you, Mr. President, for \r\nchoosing “Bringing about adjustment or settlement of \r\ninternational disputes or situations by peaceful means” \r\nas the overarching theme for the sixty-seventh session of \r\nthe General Assembly. It is completely consistent with \r\nthe objective of strengthening the role of the Assembly \r\nin the areas of international peace and security and \r\nserving the noble cause of preventing new conflicts and \r\nresolving existing ones. The Assembly should continue \r\nto increase the visibility of its work by interacting more \r\nwith civil society, non-governmental organizations and \r\nthe private sector.\r\nMr. President, your Office should be further \r\nstrengthened through the allocation of more financial \r\nand human resources from the United Nations regular \r\nbudget so that it can keep up with the growing demands, \r\nworkload and responsibilities of the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly from one session to the next. It is not \r\nacceptable that the budget allocation for the Office has \r\nnot increased since 1998. The establishment in 2010 of \r\nthe Trust Fund in support of the Office of the President \r\nwas not the best solution. No contribution was made to \r\nthe Trust Fund during the sixty-sixth session. That is \r\nwhy the President’s Office should not have to rely on \r\nvoluntary contributions. Resources should be increased \r\nfrom within the regular budget in order not to affect the \r\ncredibility or impartiality of the President’s position.\r\nThe selection and appointment of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral is yet another issue of great interest to the \r\nwider membership. The General Assembly should be \r\nmore involved at an early stage in the selection process \r\nand in identifying candidates for this key post.\r\nMs. Flores (Honduras), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair.\r\nThe revitalization of the work of the General \r\nAssembly is linked to other processes under the wider \r\numbrella of the United Nations reform. It should not \r\nbe considered in isolation from the wider context of \r\ninstitutional reform of the United Nations. There is a \r\ndire need to address every element of the reform process \r\nwith equal attention. The issue of the revitalization \r\nof the Assembly lies at the core of that process. In \r\nconclusion, I would particularly like to thank the \r\nPresident for his introduction of this item this morning, \r\nand for his inspirational statement. I would also like \r\nto assure him of the Egyptian delegation’s full support \r\nfor all his efforts to enhance the role of the General \r\nAssembly in achieving peace, stability and prosperity \r\nfor all.\r\nMr. Singh (Malaysia): On behalf of my delegation, \r\nI wish to thank the President for convening this meeting \r\non an issue that is of particular importance to us and \r\nthat we feel strongly about. It is pleasing to note that \r\nthe President feels as strongly about it as we do. I would \r\nalso like to express Malaysia’s appreciation to the \r\nPermanent Representatives of Georgia and the Gambia \r\nfor their efforts and leadership in steering the Ad Hoc \r\n8 12-54292\r\nA/67/PV.23\r\nmandates, in accordance with the United Nations \r\nCharter. Both organs must work together in consultation \r\nand cooperation to create a more harmonious working \r\nrelationship. Encroachment by one organ on the \r\nmandate of the other would severely affect not only the \r\nfunctioning of the organ itself, but the entire United \r\nNations machinery.\r\nIt is obvious that the role and activities of the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly have evolved \r\nsignificantly over the years. A greater number of issues \r\nand agenda items are now considered by the Assembly \r\nthan was the case just a few years ago. Furthermore, \r\nthe workload of the General Assembly now spans \r\nthe whole year rather than being limited to its main \r\nsession. It is therefore only natural that the Office of \r\nthe President should be provided with the additional \r\nresources required to enable the President to efficiently \r\nand effectively perform the role that has been entrusted \r\nto him or her by the United Nations Charter.\r\nWhile we recognize the benefits of the Trust \r\nFund established to assist in the funding of the work \r\nof the President of the Assembly, it is nonetheless \r\nimportant that the funding from the regular budget be \r\nincreased so that the Office of the President will no \r\nlonger be dependent on the Trust Fund and voluntary \r\ncontributions. In this regard, Malaysia looks forward \r\nto proposals to review the budget of the Office of the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly for the biennium \r\n2014-2015.\r\nOn the subject of the appointment of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Malaysia firmly believes that the Assembly \r\nneeds to play a more meaningful role in the selection \r\nprocess. That process needs to be more transparent and \r\ninclusive of all Member States, as the Secretary-General \r\nrepresents all the Members of the United Nations and \r\nnot merely the members of the Security Council. It is \r\ntherefore important, when selecting and appointing \r\nthe Secretary-General in future, to implement past \r\nresolutions, especially paragraphs 17 to 22 of the annex \r\nto resolution 60/286.\r\nThere is an undeniable need to focus on the \r\nsubstantive aspects of the revitalization process and to \r\nensure that the General Assembly continues in its role \r\nas the principal policy-making and norm-setting organ \r\nof the United Nations. The issue of the revitalization \r\nof the General Assembly has been the subject of \r\nplenary debate since 1991. Given the number of years \r\nthis issue has been considered, it is high time that all \r\nMember States approach the subject with openness \r\nWorking Group on the Revitalization of the Work of \r\nthe General Assembly during the Assembly’s sixty-\r\nsixth session. We appreciate the convening of four \r\nseparate thematic meetings that enabled Member States \r\nto clearly focus on various aspects of revitalization, one \r\ntheme at a time. Those discussions, along with all the \r\nefforts by Member States, culminated in the report of \r\nthe Ad Hoc Working Group (A/66/891), for which we \r\nshould also thank the co-Chairs. On that note, I wish to \r\nalign my statement with that made by Algeria on behalf \r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement.\r\nYear after year, revitalization remains a priority \r\nissue for the General Assembly. Despite the attention \r\nit attracts, we have managed to achieve only qualified \r\nsuccess in revitalizing it. Over the years, we have \r\nseen some improvements in the Assembly’s working \r\nmethods, but they are minor. We have still failed to \r\naddress the real issue of why the General Assembly must \r\nbe revitalized. We should not forget that the key word \r\nhere is “revitalization”, not “minor improvements”. \r\nThe General Assembly is unquestionably the chief \r\ndeliberative policymaking and representative organ \r\nof the United Nations. It is the highest authoritative \r\nbody of the United Nations, since it represents all 193 \r\nMember States. We must therefore accord it the role \r\nand authority it rightly deserves.\r\nMy delegation firmly believes that the lack of \r\nimplementation of General Assembly resolutions \r\ncontinues to be the biggest stumbling block to \r\nenhancing its role and effectiveness. We reiterate \r\nthat no other weakness of the General Assembly \r\nundermines its relevance or effectiveness more than the \r\nfailure to implement resolutions. Malaysia commends \r\nthe Ad Hoc Working Group’s decision to continue its \r\nreview of the Assembly’s resolutions on revitalization. \r\nWe look forward to receiving the updated inventory \r\nof those resolutions, which will give Member States \r\na better understanding of the reasons behind the \r\nfailure to implement them. The Ad Hoc Working \r\nGroup could then discuss the issue and find ways to \r\novercome problems so as to ensure that the resolutions \r\nare implemented. This is the first step towards the \r\nultimate goal of realizing the full implementation of all \r\nAssembly resolutions.\r\nMalaysia continues to take the issue of \r\nencroachment seriously. We cannot emphasize enough \r\nthe need for all principal organs, especially the two \r\nleading organs — the General Assembly and the \r\nSecurity Council — to faithfully respect each other’s \r\n12-54292 9\r\nA/67/PV.23\r\nWith respect to the implementation of General \r\nAssembly resolutions, it seems that, to a large extent, \r\nthis problem is related to the degree of realism and \r\nachievability of the goals and provisions of the \r\noriginal resolutions. Before a decision is proposed, it \r\nis important for us to ask ourselves how implementable \r\nit is in principle. Such an approach should also be \r\nfollowed in the Group’s own work. We suggest that we \r\nadopt the line of “less is better”.\r\nMr. Yaroshevich (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): \r\nThe Republic of Belarus attaches high priority to \r\nstrengthening the role of the General Assembly. We \r\nsupport an enhanced role for the Assembly in resolving \r\nissues of international peace and security, in line with \r\nthe United Nations Charter, and we want to maintain \r\na balance between the principal organs of the United \r\nNations in considering all issues on the United Nations \r\nagenda. We highlight the need to ensure proper \r\nimplementation of General Assembly resolutions, to \r\nfurther enhance the role of the President of the Assembly \r\nand his Office, and to improve the methods for electing \r\nthe Secretary-General and the working methods of the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nThe Belarus delegation commends the work of the \r\nAd Hoc Working Group on the Revitalization of the \r\nWork of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. \r\nWe are pleased to note the interactive debates that were \r\nheld with the Chairs of the Main Committees of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and representatives of the Secretariat \r\nand the effective work of the Chairs in organizing the \r\nnegotiation process.\r\nThis year, on the initiative of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement, together with other participants in the \r\nnegotiating process, a very important step, in our view, \r\nwas taken towards enhancing the General Assembly’s \r\nrelevance and visibility. We can now can see it quite \r\nclearly when we simply open the Journal of the United \r\nNations. Resolution 66/294, for the first time in many \r\nyears, established the order in which the principal \r\norgans are set out in the Journal, in line with Article \r\n7 of the Charter — that is, with the General Assembly \r\nfirst and then the Security Council. That is in line with \r\nthe tradition that was followed in the early years of the \r\nOrganization’s existence. \r\nWith regard to the current session, the delegation of \r\nBelarus will continue to participate actively in the Ad \r\nHoc Working Group. In particular, we believe that it is \r\nnow urgently necessary to design and adopt mechanisms \r\nthat will provide clear procedures for agreeing on \r\nand the necessary political will to realize tangible and \r\nsubstantial progress. If the pace of reform continues to \r\nbe as slow as it has been in the past, we will face the \r\nawkward task of revitalizing the revitalization process. \r\nThis is something we should certainly avoid.\r\nMr. Sergeyev (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): We are grateful to the President for convening \r\ntoday’s meeting. \r\nThe Russian delegation intends to continue to \r\nparticipate constructively in the Ad Hoc Working \r\nGroup on the Revitalization of the Work of the General \r\nAssembly at this session. We hope that the work of this \r\nGroup will be balanced, realistic and depoliticized and \r\nwill seek to enhance the effectiveness of the General \r\nAssembly. All initiatives and proposals must be based \r\non the principle of strict respect for the distribution of \r\npowers among the principal United Nations organs, as \r\nset out in the Charter. \r\nThe emphasis in the work of the Group must be \r\nplaced on the issue of improving the working methods \r\nof the General Assembly and streamlining its agenda. \r\nThe Assembly’s programme of work is in many ways \r\noverburdened, and it would therefore be appropriate to \r\nreview the possibility of transferring some of its agenda \r\nitems to a biennial or triennial cycle. It would also be \r\nappropriate to lighten the workload in terms of high-\r\nlevel meetings during the week of the general debate, \r\nwhen, due to the presence in New York of Heads of State \r\nand Government and Ministers for Foreign Affairs, \r\nthere is an especially busy programme of events and \r\nmeetings, including bilateral meetings. We should limit \r\nthe number of high-level meetings during that period, \r\nand the remaining events should be evenly spread over \r\nthe entire session of the Assembly. \r\nWe are prepared to examine proposals to enhance \r\nthe institutional memory of the Office of the President \r\nof the General Assembly. However, we would point \r\nout that, as with any proposal that has financial \r\nimplications for the United Nations regular budget, \r\nthis issue must receive full consideration, in line with \r\nexisting procedures, that is, in the Advisory Committee \r\non Administrative and Budgetary Questions and the \r\nFifth Committee. As to the General Assembly’s role in \r\nselecting and appointing the Secretary-General, Russia \r\nhas consistently advocated maintaining the current \r\npractice, based on Article 97 of the Charter, according \r\nto which the Secretary-General is appointed by the \r\nGeneral Assembly upon the recommendation of the \r\nSecurity Council. \r\n10 12-54292\r\nA/67/PV.23\r\nthe fielding of candidatures for the Assembly’s Main \r\nCommittees and an order of rotation for the chairs and \r\nrapporteurs from the regional groups. Adopting such \r\na mechanism will facilitate enhancing the role and \r\nauthority of the Assembly, streamline current practices \r\nand establish a clear mechanism for the election of \r\nChairs and bureaux of the Main Committees. We call \r\nupon our partners to take an active part in working on \r\nthe issue in order to achieve an effective and mutually \r\nacceptable decision.\r\nBelarus is convinced that stepping up work to \r\nrevitalize the General Assembly will also help us to \r\nmake progress in the work of the Special Committee \r\non the Charter of the United Nations and on the \r\nStrengthening of the Role of the Organization. In that \r\nregard, we express our support for the initiative of \r\nVenezuela and Cuba, which is being considered in the \r\nframework of the Special Committee. Issues raised by \r\nour friends deserve serious and balanced examination, \r\nconsidering the functions and competencies of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council and the \r\nsubstantive decisions taken by them.\r\nIt is strategically important that, in the work to \r\nreanimate the activities of the General Assembly, the \r\nletter and spirit of the Charter be followed, as the \r\nCharter establishes that universal organ in the primary \r\nrole, with its higher f lexibility and capacity to promptly, \r\nappropriately and effectively respond to current issues \r\nof international life. In other words, the Assembly \r\nshould be the world’s “number one situation room” \r\nand should be considered as such. In that connection, \r\nthe Belarus delegation shares the view of the President \r\nof the General Assembly stated earlier in the meeting \r\nthat the General Assembly must “adapt... to the new \r\ntimes”. The world that is changing before our very eyes, \r\nwith globalization and technological revolutions and \r\nother types of revolutions, requires that the process of \r\noptimizing the work of the Assembly be a permanent, \r\neven uninterrupted, process.\r\nSuccessful businessmen are convinced that they \r\nhave to work every minute of the day on improving \r\nbusiness processes. Businessmen are responsible \r\nfor businesses and their employees, and they make \r\nprofit their target. All of us regard as of paramount \r\nimportance the more serious and important values of \r\nour shared responsibility, which is unconditional and \r\nfar greater. Therefore our work — the work of the \r\nGeneral Assembly — must conform to the very highest \r\ncontemporary standards of efficacy, quality and \r\npractical results. \r\nMr. Wang Min (China) (spoke in Chinese): At \r\npresent, the international situation is undergoing \r\ncomplex and profound changes. Under the new \r\nsituation, the international community expects the \r\nUnited Nations to play a greater role in safeguarding \r\nworld peace, promoting common development and \r\nstrengthening international cooperation. The General \r\nAssembly is the Organization’s pre-eminent policy \r\ndeliberation body and one of its most important Charter \r\nbodies. The numerous Member States, particularly the \r\ndeveloping countries, would like to see the General \r\nAssembly further enhance its prestige and efficiency \r\nand better fulfil the duties entrusted to it by the Charter.\r\nThe revitalization of the General Assembly bears \r\non the vital interests of all Member States and has \r\nimportant, far-reaching implications for enhancing the \r\nprestige and credibility of the United Nations. China \r\ncommends the President of the General Assembly for \r\nmaking revitalization of the Assembly one of his priority \r\nitems and supports giving full play to the Assembly’s \r\npolicy deliberation function. The Assembly, on the \r\nbasis of the development of the international situation \r\nand targeting the salient challenges faced by the United \r\nNations in all fields, should emphasize deliberating \r\non and dealing with important questions of common \r\nconcern to Member States, particularly those involving \r\nthe vital interests of the developing countries. \r\nThe General Assembly should give particular \r\nattention to, and step up efforts on, development issues \r\nso as to play a greater role in advancing international \r\ncooperation for development. It should strengthen its \r\narrangements for division of work and cooperation \r\nwith organs such as the Security Council and the \r\nEconomic and Social Council so that each can deploy \r\nits full strength and step up information exchange and \r\ninteraction. \r\nOn matters regarding the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security, the General Assembly \r\nshould strengthen its coordination and cooperation with \r\nthe Security Council, on the basis of the division of \r\nwork set out in the Charter. China supports improving \r\nthe Assembly’s working methods, simplifying its \r\ndecision-making procedures and enhancing its \r\nefficiency. Enhancing the quality of reports and \r\ndocuments should be emphasized. Reports should be \r\nconcise and clear, and analytical recommendations \r\nshould be well targeted. Pragmatic, action-oriented \r\n12-54292 11\r\nA/67/PV.23\r\nGeneral Assembly, whose level of implementation is \r\nunacceptably low despite their having been adopted by \r\nconsensus. As we have stated on previous occasions, \r\nthe task of revitalizing the General Assembly cannot \r\nbe limited to speeches. The General Assembly enjoys \r\nall the legal prerogatives necessary to act. We therefore \r\nhope that this year, the Ad Hoc Working Group will \r\nadopt a broad and f lexible agenda aimed at achieving \r\nambitious goals. \r\nThe General Assembly is the principal organ for \r\ndeliberation, the adoption of policies and representation \r\nof the United Nations. Owing to its broad and democratic \r\nnature, it enjoys legitimacy and great prestige. It is \r\nthe maximum expression of the principle of sovereign \r\nequality among States. The revitalization of its work is \r\nan issue of the greatest importance.\r\nThe main obstacle to revitalizing the work of the \r\nGeneral Assembly is the lack of political will on the \r\npart of certain States that attempt to put their narrow \r\npolitical interests above the views of the majority. \r\nThe revitalization issue is therefore not a technical \r\nmatter, as some countries would have us believe, but \r\nfundamentally a political issue. It is necessary to strike \r\nthe appropriate balance among the principal organs of \r\nthe United Nations, in accordance with the Charter.\r\nMy delegation wishes to reiterate its concern over \r\nthe attempts of the Security Council to establish legal \r\nnorms and definitions, overlooking the fact that, under \r\nArticle 13 of the Charter, the progressive development \r\nof international law and its codification are the \r\nexclusive responsibility of the General Assembly. \r\nThose dangerous trends and the increasing broadening \r\nof the agenda of the Security Council beyond its \r\ncompetence must immediately cease because they are \r\nclear violations of the provisions of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations and restrict the debate, transparency \r\nand democratic way in which the problems of today’s \r\nworld should be addressed.\r\nWe would like to take this opportunity to urgently \r\nappeal once again for a radical reform of the Security \r\nCouncil that transforms it into the transparent, \r\nparticipatory and democratic organ demanded by the \r\ninternational community. The action of the Security \r\nCouncil and its members is subject to international law, \r\nin particular the Charter.\r\nWe cannot speak of an Organization in consonance \r\nwith the system of contemporary international relations \r\nwithout reforming the Security Council and placing \r\nwork styles should be developed. Member States \r\nshould also respect the solemnity of General Assembly \r\nresolutions and ensure their full implementation so \r\nas to safeguard the authority and effectiveness of the \r\nAssembly. \r\nThe effective functioning of the Office of the \r\nPresident is an important guarantee of the smooth work \r\nof the Assembly. China supports the strengthening \r\nof the Office of the President in both manpower and \r\nbudgetary terms, particularly in order to resolve \r\ncurrent difficulties faced by developing countries when \r\ncarrying out the functions of the presidency.\r\nThe numerous Member States have high hopes \r\nfor the revitalization of the General Assembly. China \r\nfirmly supports the President’s efforts to that end, for \r\na more effective role for the Assembly in the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes and the promotion of global \r\ndevelopment. China wishes to continue to advance \r\nthe implementation of the series of resolutions on the \r\nrevitalization of the Assembly within the framework of \r\nthe Ad Hoc Working Group on the Revitalization of the \r\nWork of the General Assembly. We hope that the work \r\nwill move steadily forward on the basis of democratic \r\nconsultations, going from easier to more difficult \r\nissues in an orderly and gradual manner. China will \r\nwork with other Member States for good progress on \r\nthe important agenda item of the revitalization of the \r\nGeneral Assembly during the current session of the \r\nAssembly.\r\nMr. León González (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): The \r\ndelegation of Cuba endorses the statement made by the \r\nrepresentative of Algeria on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement, which represents the position of 120 \r\ncountries. We wish to add some remarks in our national \r\ncapacity. \r\nFirst, the Cuban delegation wishes to thank the \r\nco-Chairs of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the \r\nRevitalization of the Work of the General Assembly for \r\ntheir commendable work during the sixty-sixth session \r\nof the General Assembly. Under their leadership, the \r\nAd Hoc Working Group contributed to strengthening \r\nthe leading role that the General Assembly plays \r\nin the system of international relations and in the \r\nOrganization.\r\nIt is unacceptable that numerous General Assembly \r\nresolutions, despite being an important body of \r\nlaw, have not been implemented. That also applies \r\nto the many resolutions on the revitalization of the \r\n12 12-54292\r\nA/67/PV.23\r\npolitical, legal and budgetary implications, it is \r\nimportant for everyone to be aware of both the deficit \r\nand the progress in the implementation of relevant \r\nUnited Nations resolutions and decisions on making the \r\nAssembly robust.\r\nWe therefore reiterate our request that the Secretariat \r\nupdate the chart and provide the Working Group \r\nwith information about the challenges and obstacles \r\nhindering the timely and concrete implementation of \r\nall relevant resolutions pertaining to the various themes \r\nstated in the inventory charts.\r\nRegarding the selection and appointment of the \r\nheads of United Nations agencies and senior officials \r\nof the Secretariat, we stress that their selection and \r\nappointment must also conform to the criteria of a more \r\nbalanced geographical representation.\r\nSecondly, we underline that a faithful implementation \r\nof United Nations resolutions is vital to strengthening \r\nthe oversight role of the Assembly. In that regard, we \r\nconcur that a strong oversight role of the Assembly is \r\nneeded in the management and procurement of United \r\nNations peacekeeping operations, as well as in the wider \r\nUnited Nations system’s post-conflict peacebuilding \r\nefforts, including in the areas of preventive diplomacy, \r\nconflict resolution and mediation.\r\nIndonesia is pleased that the theme of this year’s \r\nsession focuses on the settlement of disputes by \r\npeaceful means. That focus should be sustained. As \r\nwe have already proposed, it would therefore be fitting \r\nthat, just as peacekeeping issues have a forum in the \r\nSpecial Committee on Peacekeeping Operations of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, and post-conflict peacebuilding \r\nissues in the Peacebuilding Commission (PBC), the \r\nissues of preventive diplomacy, mediation and peaceful \r\nconflict resolution should also have a dedicated United \r\nNations intergovernmental forum. We also believe that \r\nthe Assembly, which is one of the parent bodies of the \r\nPBC, should play a more effective role in guiding and \r\nsupporting the Commission’s work.\r\nAs my third and last point, I would submit that it is \r\nnot for any shortage of resolutions or decisions that the \r\nAssembly has not yet fully claimed its Charter role as \r\nthe chief deliberative, policymaking and representative \r\norgan of the United Nations. It is chiefly the lack of \r\npolitical will and necessary support that is the cause. \r\nThe many mutually shared and complex problems of \r\nour globalized world today will not be solved if we do \r\nnot come together and strengthen the United Nations \r\nthe General Assembly at the centre of debate and \r\nmultilateral work. The revitalization of the General \r\nAssembly is essential in order to achieve a genuine \r\nreform of the United Nations. We cannot be satisfied \r\nwith our work until the General Assembly fully \r\nexercises all its functions and powers.\r\nCuba reiterates that only a universal and democratic \r\norgan, such as the General Assembly, can tackle the \r\nexisting global problems, whose solutions exceed the \r\nlimited capacity of a country or a group of countries, \r\nhowever powerful they believe themselves to be.\r\nMr. Khan (Indonesia): At the outset, Indonesia \r\nthanks the President for convening this important \r\ndebate on the revitalization of the work of the General \r\nAssembly, which it fervently supports. Indonesia \r\ncommends his strong commitment to strengthening \r\nthe General Assembly’s role in line with the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations. We pledge our full support for his \r\nefforts and those of Member States towards realizing an \r\neffective Assembly.\r\nMy delegation aligns itself with the statement \r\nmade by the representative of Algeria on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement.\r\nWe welcome the recent adoption of resolution \r\n66/294, mandating the Ad Hoc Working Group on the \r\nRevitalization of the Work of the General Assembly \r\nto continue its work on the issue during the sixty-\r\nseventh session. Resolution 66/294 underscores the \r\nzeal of delegations to reinforce the gravity of the \r\nreform process of the Assembly as an invaluable United \r\nNations principal organ. \r\nThat the Assembly alone uniquely reflects the \r\naspirations and concerns of all Member States must \r\nelevate the status of its revitalization efforts. We all \r\nneed to participate to adequately support the work \r\non strengthening the Assembly’s role. We therefore \r\nstress the importance of this year’s Ad Hoc Working \r\nGroup continuing to build upon the results of previous \r\nsessions and how vital it is for us to support the Group \r\nas it carries out its work. Allow me to make a few \r\nobservations on advancing the work of that Group\r\nFirst, we emphasize updating and utilizing the \r\ninventory chart annexed to the annual reports of the \r\nAd Hoc Working Group. The chart has proved to be a \r\nvaluable tool in systematically identifying, monitoring \r\nand proposing solutions to the issue of the Assembly’s \r\nrevitalization. While my delegation is mindful of \r\nthe sensitive nature of that exercise, with its obvious \r\n12-54292 13\r\nA/67/PV.23\r\ninternational peace and security be recognized. \r\nAlthough Articles 12 and 24 of the Charter invest the \r\nSecurity Council with the primary responsibility in \r\nthat area, that responsibility should not be the Council’s \r\nsole domain. In our view, the Assembly must respond \r\nmore rapidly to relevant issues that affect international \r\npeace and security. \r\nWe also affirm the need to improve the quality \r\nand content of the annual Security Council reports \r\nsubmitted to the Assembly; they should be more \r\nanalytical and comprehensive so as to refl ect the context \r\nin which the Council resolutions were adopted and the \r\nsituations in which the Council was unable to take any \r\naction. Periodic meetings should be held among the \r\nheads of the principal organs of the United Nations, and \r\nMember States should be informed of the outcomes of \r\nthose meetings on a regular basis. It is also important to \r\npromote cooperation and coordination and exchanges \r\nof information between the Assembly and those \r\norgans through regular and transparent mechanisms \r\nthat specifically provide for the participation of the \r\ncountries directly affected.\r\nWith regard to improving the working methods \r\nof the Assembly, my delegation believes that, while \r\na number of resolutions have been adopted with a \r\nview to improving the working methods of the Main \r\nCommittees and the convening of high-level meetings, \r\nit is nevertheless important to study thoroughly some \r\nrelevant proposals, such as the need to streamline \r\nthe work of the Committees, with the support of all \r\nMember States. We must also facilitate the access \r\nof developing countries to detailed and updated \r\ninformation on the websites of the Main Committees \r\nand make such information available in all the official \r\nlanguages, including Arabic. We should ensure that \r\nresolutions, reports and other documents are concise \r\nand that there is an exchange of best practices among \r\nthe Committees, taking into account the specific nature \r\nof each Committee. Arrangements for strengthening \r\nthe coordination of efforts and setting up schedules \r\nfor high-level meetings so that they are optimally \r\ndistributed, for the benefit of all, should also be \r\nthoroughly considered.\r\nRegarding the appointment of the Secretary-General \r\nand the senior managers of the Secretariat, I reiterate \r\nour thanks to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his \r\nefforts to organize broader consultations with Member \r\nStates, based on cooperation and transparency, in order \r\nto enhance the effectiveness of the Organization’s \r\nmultilateral framework that we ourselves created for \r\nthat purpose. Let us rise above our differences and \r\nempower and support the Assembly to perform its work \r\neffectively.\r\nI affirm Indonesia’s readiness to work actively \r\nand constructively with all delegations in our common \r\nendeavour to enhance the authority, effectiveness and \r\nefficiency of the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Jerandi (Tunisia) (spoke in Arabic): I would \r\nfirst of all like to thank the Ambassadors of the \r\nGambia and Georgia for their efforts as co-Chairs of \r\nthe Ad Hoc Working Group on the Revitalization of the \r\nWork of the General Assembly during the sixty-sixth \r\nsession. While aligning ourselves with the statement \r\nmade by the representative of Algeria on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement, my delegation would like to \r\nmake the following remarks.\r\nWith regard to enhancing the role and the authority \r\nof the General Assembly, my country’s delegation \r\nbelieves that the revitalization of the work of the \r\nAssembly is a key element in the comprehensive reform \r\nof the United Nations since, aside from the Assembly’s \r\nrole in establishing the norms and codification of \r\ninternational law, it is the principal deliberative and \r\ndecision-making body and the most representative \r\nentity of the Organization. We affirm the need to \r\ncontinue strengthening the work and the role of that \r\nimportant organ by stepping up our efforts. At the \r\nsame time, we must ensure that the relevant Assembly \r\nresolutions are implemented as a basic requirement for \r\nmaking progress in that area.\r\nWe believe that enhancing the role and authority of \r\nthe Assembly means including urgent issues of common \r\ninterest to the international community in its agenda. \r\nWe must also ensure that the Assembly adapts rapidly to \r\nthe global changes so that it maintains its strength and \r\neffectiveness and is able to meet emerging challenges. \r\nAt the same time, we would like to reiterate that the \r\nAssembly should organize thematic debates. Such \r\ndebates are a forum for interaction, allowing exchanges \r\nof views on current issues of great international \r\nimportance to the Assembly. It would also enable us to \r\ninteract with civil society. We hope that such debates \r\nwill continue under Mr. Jeremić’s presidency of the \r\nAssembly during this sixty-seventh session in order to \r\nachieve tangible and specific outcomes. \r\nStrengthening the role and authority of the \r\nAssembly also requires that its role in maintaining \r\n14 12-54292\r\nA/67/PV.23\r\nWe continue to advocate for measures to ensure the \r\nimproved efficiency, effectiveness and transparency \r\nof the United Nations system. Therefore, streamlining \r\nand prioritizing the agenda and improving the practices \r\nand working methods of the Main Committees will be \r\nthe primary focus of our interactions with the Working \r\nGroup during the sixty-seventh session.\r\nAs part of our efforts to ensure that the General \r\nAssembly remains relevant, we should also encourage \r\nthe more timely publishing of General Assembly \r\nresolutions soon after their adoption. Informing \r\nothers of our work will highlight the important issues \r\nthat we cover and would encourage more expeditious \r\nimplementation of General Assembly resolutions by \r\nMember States. Just as providing information to the \r\nworld outside of New York is important, the General \r\nAssembly would be better served by increased \r\ninteraction between the heads of the principal organs \r\nof the United Nations and the Chairs of the Main \r\nCommittees and the President of the General Assembly.\r\nThat could perhaps be accomplished by exchanging \r\nviews and priorities at the start of each new General \r\nAssembly session. Greater cooperation and increased \r\ncoordination among the organs of the United Nations \r\nare critical for enabling us to achieve our goal of \r\nstreamlining agendas and reducing wasteful overlap. \r\nWe will continue to work with other delegations on \r\nour proposals to improve working methods, such as \r\ndiscontinuing the practice of adopting resolutions on \r\noutdated or obscure topics, merging or clustering items \r\nclosely related in substance, proposing comprehensive \r\nor omnibus resolutions, and encouraging Member \r\nStates to exercise greater discipline in their submission \r\nof draft resolutions, that is, to be more deliberate in \r\nkeeping their statements succinct and to focus on key \r\nthemes. We encourage Member States to consider \r\nreviewing existing resolutions biennially or triennially, \r\nrather than annually, and to exercise greater discipline \r\nin their submission of draft resolutions.\r\nWe also propose setting deadlines for achieving \r\nobjectives, encouraging General Assembly working \r\ngroups to complete their work on time, and rationalizing \r\nthe General Assembly’s meeting schedule to allow for \r\nwidespread Member State participation. We hope to \r\nsee progress on those goals during the sixty-seventh \r\nsession.\r\nThe roles of the General Assembly and the Security \r\nCouncil in selecting the Secretary-General are clearly \r\ndefined in the Charter. The General Assembly should \r\nperformance. We hope that during this session we will \r\nfocus on improving the selection process for senior \r\nmanagers of the Secretariat, while taking into account \r\nthe recommendations set out in the report of the Joint \r\nInspection Unit (A/65/34), submitted during the sixty-\r\nfifth session.\r\nWith regard to strengthening the support of the \r\nOffice of the President of the General Assembly, we \r\nbelieve that it is necessary to provide the Office with \r\nadequate financial and human resources to allow the \r\nPresident of the Assembly to fulfil his function as well \r\nas possible. That support should at least reflect the \r\nchanges in the regular budget. We also stress the notion \r\nof strengthening the Assembly’s institutional memory \r\nand benefiting from lessons learned, in the interest of a \r\nsmooth transition from one presidency to the next.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate my country’s \r\nsupport for resolution 66/294, adopted in September, \r\nwhich provides for the establishment of the Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group on the Revitalization of the Work of \r\nthe General Assembly. In our view, the priority of that \r\nWorking Group should be to assess the difficulties \r\nin implementing resolutions so that the revitalization \r\nprocess can move forward. \r\nMr. Pope (United States of America): The United \r\nStates would like to add its thanks to last year’s co-Chairs \r\nof the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Revitalization \r\nof the Work of the General Assembly, Ambassador \r\nWaffa-Ogoo of the Gambia and Ambassador Lomaia \r\nof Georgia, for their attention to this issue during the \r\nsixty-sixth session of the General Assembly. Their \r\nleadership culminated in the recently adopted resolution \r\n66/294, which serves as a basis for our continued work \r\non the topic. We also offer the incoming co-Chairs our \r\nfull support once they are named. We look forward to \r\nworking with fellow Member States as we consider \r\nthe best options for revitalizing the General Assembly \r\nand build on the recommendations that we made to the \r\nWorking Group this past session.\r\nThe United States is committed to multilateral \r\nengagement and a strong United Nations system. We \r\nrecognize the important contributions of the General \r\nAssembly to fulfilling the mission of the United \r\nNations. We hope that our discussions and the efforts \r\nof the Working Group will be constructive in allowing \r\nus to consider how we can improve working methods to \r\nbetter enable the Assembly to carry out its work.\r\n12-54292 15\r\nA/67/PV.23\r\nDuring this first week of substantive debate on \r\nindividual items on the agenda of the current session, \r\nlet me present Japan’s general views on several key \r\nissues.\r\nFirst, it is essential to strengthen the relations \r\nbetween the General Assembly and the other principal \r\norgans of the United Nations. With respect to the \r\nSecurity Council in particular, while the Council \r\nbears primary responsibility for the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security, the General Assembly \r\nmay play a complementary role when the Council fails \r\nto fully exercise its functions, as in the case of the \r\nSyrian Arab Republic. Such functions of the General \r\nAssembly highlight the necessity of establishing a \r\nbetter relationship between the two organs. Regular \r\nconsultations between the Presidents of the Security \r\nCouncil and the General Assembly would be one \r\npractical way of proceeding in that regard. We look \r\nforward to a debate on the annual report of the Security \r\nCouncil in November this year with a view to deepening \r\ndiscussions on the matter.\r\nSecondly, with a view to enhancing its public \r\nawareness, the General Assembly must demonstrate to \r\nthe people of the world that it is an organ that is capable \r\nof responding adequately to emerging challenges of \r\ncommon concern and of producing results-oriented \r\noutcomes. In that regard, thematic debates on relevant \r\ncurrent issues, such as that held in April 2012 on \r\ndisaster risk reduction, are most welcome. That practice \r\nhas proved to be a useful instrument for encouraging \r\nbroader and more f lexible exchanges of views outside \r\nthe constraints of the formal agenda. Resolution 66/290 \r\non human security, adopted by consensus in September, \r\nis another notable achievement of the General \r\nAssembly. I am confident that the General Assembly \r\nwill continue to make notable contributions to putting \r\nhuman security into practice.\r\nThe useful outcomes produced by the General \r\nAssembly lose their meaning if they are not implemented \r\nand followed up. Repeated non-implementation \r\nof General Assembly resolutions would over time \r\nrisk diminishing the authority of the Assembly. My \r\ndelegation will actively participate in the work of the \r\nAd Hoc Working Group on the Revitalization of the \r\nWork of the General Assembly in conducting a review \r\nof the inventory of General Assembly resolutions as \r\nagreed upon during the previous session.\r\nThirdly, it is important to rationalize the work of \r\nthe General Assembly with a view to better enabling it \r\nnot, as a priority for its own revitalization, consider \r\npursuing changes to the Council’s role in selecting a \r\ncandidate for Secretary-General.\r\nMy delegation looks forward to working closely \r\nwith the President of the General Assembly and with \r\nour counterparts from other delegations towards a \r\nconstructive dialogue on concrete reform.\r\nMr. Kodama (Japan): At the outset, allow me to \r\ncongratulate Mr. Vuk Jeremić, President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-seventh session, on his assumption \r\nof duties as President and to thank him for his leadership \r\nin advancing the revitalization agenda. I would also like \r\nto extend my sincere gratitude to Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz \r\nAl-Nasser, President of the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-sixth session, as well as to Mr. Alexander \r\nLomaia, Permanent Representative of Georgia, and \r\nMrs. Susan Waffa-Ogoo, Permanent Representative of \r\nGambia, who served as co-Chairs of the previous Ad \r\nHoc Working Group on the Revitalization of the Work \r\nof the General Assembly. Their initiative and dedicated \r\nwork culminated in a report (A/66/891) that included \r\nthe text of resolution 66/294, which was adopted by \r\nconsensus on the final day of the previous session.\r\nAs the body in which all 193 Member States \r\nparticipate, the General Assembly is universally \r\nrecognized as the most representative organ of the \r\nUnited Nations. The General Assembly is mandated \r\nto address any issue and questions falling under its \r\nresponsibility, in accordance with the Charter, except \r\nas provided in Article 12.1.\r\nDuring the course of this year’s general debate, \r\nwhich was convened under the theme of “Bringing about \r\nadjustment or settlement of international disputes or \r\nsituations by peaceful means”, we witnessed a number of \r\nthoughtful statements by dignitaries along with various \r\nside events on the full spectrum of international issues. \r\nThat demonstrated once again the importance of this \r\nbody in multilateral diplomacy. The General Assembly \r\ncan offer a useful forum as we endeavour to adapt to \r\ntoday’s complex society. In the words of Japanese Prime \r\nMinister Yoshihiko Noda’s address to the General \r\nAssembly on 26 September, we need “to give adequate \r\nconsideration to future generations and solve disputes \r\ncalmly by reason under rules” (A/67/PV.9, p. 47) . The \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly is thus of high \r\nimportance. Building upon mutual trust and confidence \r\namong Member States, we must make steady progress \r\ntowards achieving feasible and realistic results on this \r\nmatter.\r\n16 12-54292\r\nA/67/PV.23\r\nto focus its activities on current challenges and events \r\nof common interest to the international community. \r\nIt is appropriate, therefore, to continue to consider \r\nways to streamline and prioritize the agenda of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and its Main Committees. Various \r\npossibilities, such as having biennial or triennial \r\nreviews of agenda items and clustering or eliminating \r\nagenda items, should be given proper consideration, \r\nbased on the relevant resolutions.\r\nWe also need to consider how to improve working \r\nmethods so as to carry out the Assembly’s work \r\nefficiently. For instance, we recall that Member States \r\nwere not able to reach consensus on the composition of a \r\nworking group on sustainable development goals before \r\nthe opening of the current session, as was mandated in \r\nthe outcome document of the United Nations Conference \r\non Sustainable Development (resolution 66/288, annex). \r\nThe question of the underrepresentation of the Asia-\r\nPacific States, in terms of equitable geographical \r\nrepresentation, might also be posed in that regard.\r\nIn the light of the considerable importance of the \r\nissue, Japan looks forward to having constructive \r\ndiscussions aimed at further enhancing the role of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. I would like to reiterate once again \r\nJapan’s commitment to making an active contribution \r\nto that end.\r\nMr. Mustafizur Rahman (Bangladesh): I am \r\npleased to address the General Assembly plenary in \r\nthis joint debate. Allow me first of all to join previous \r\nspeakers in thanking Ambassador Waffa-Ogoo of the \r\nGambia and Ambassador Lomaia of Georgia for their \r\nexcellent work during the past session as the co-Chairs \r\nof the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Revitalization \r\nof the Work of the General Assembly. Their joint \r\nstewardship resulted in the adoption of resolution \r\n66/294 in September, which we consider to be a very \r\ngood basis for future discussion on the matter.\r\nThe revitalization of the General Assembly is a \r\ncritical component of the wider reform of the United \r\nNations. The continued attention the issue is receiving \r\nindicates the collective desire of the United Nations \r\nmembership to see the General Assembly attain its \r\nrightful place in global discourse. We are aware that \r\nreform is a continuous process, but we cannot discuss \r\nthe issue ad infinitum. As we will embark on another \r\nround of discussions soon, we must make sure that the \r\nexercise results, within a reasonable period of time, in \r\ndecisions that can be implemented.\r\nThere are a number of issues relating to the \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly that have been \r\ndiscussed at length over the past years and have been \r\nreflected in the relevant resolutions. The views and \r\npositions of my delegation are generally in line with \r\nthe statement made by the representative of Algeria on \r\nbehalf of the Non-Aligned Movement. I will, however, \r\ntouch on a few points to reinforce our position.\r\nThe objective of the revitalization of the \r\nAssembly is to strengthen its role and position as the \r\nchief deliberative, legislative, policy-making and \r\nrepresentative body of the international community. \r\nThe General Assembly should take the lead role \r\nin setting the global agenda and in formulating \r\nmultilateral approaches to solving global concerns. The \r\nGeneral Assembly is the forum in which all members \r\nof the international community have the opportunity \r\nto exchange ideas on an equal footing about issues of \r\ncommon interest and where global consensus can be \r\nreached and solutions to challenges can be found. \r\nWe recognize the importance of close cooperation \r\nand coordination among the principal organs of \r\nthe United Nations, especially among the General \r\nAssembly, the Economic and Social Council and the \r\nSecurity Council. In that regard, we welcome the \r\nregular meetings being held between the heads of \r\nthose organs. That practice should continue in order to \r\npromote system-wide coherence and effectiveness. \r\nThere is a need for the two leading organs of the \r\nUnited Nations, the General Assembly and the Security \r\nCouncil, to work in concert and create a harmonious \r\nrelationship for maintaining peace and security and \r\nfostering development. In so doing, both organs should \r\nrespect each other’s mandates as provided for in the \r\nCharter. We are concerned about the encroachment of \r\nthe Security Council on the prerogatives of the General \r\nAssembly. It is being done through extremely broad \r\ninterpretations of Charter provisions on threats to \r\ninternational peace and security. \r\nAlthough several General Assembly resolutions \r\nhave been adopted expressing concern on the issue, the \r\nencroachment unfortunately continues and has even \r\nincreased in recent years. In our view, the agenda of \r\nthe Council is already overburdened with real threats \r\nto international peace and security, leaving it little time \r\nto deal with peripheral issues, and it should therefore \r\ndesist from doing so.\r\n12-54292 17\r\nA/67/PV.23\r\nThe role and activities of the President of the General \r\nAssembly have significantly evolved over the years. It is \r\nessential to ensure sufficient and predictable financial \r\nand human resources for the efficient and successful \r\nfunctioning of the Office of the President. We welcome \r\nthe measures already adopted for its strengthening. We \r\nalso welcome the decision to allocate dedicated staff \r\nwithin the Secretariat for coordinating the transitions \r\nbetween Presidents. It is important that funding for the \r\nOffice from the regular budget be increased, so as to \r\navoid having the President be dependent on the Trust \r\nFund and on voluntary contributions to manage the \r\nOffice. In our view, such dependence would affect the \r\ncredibility and impartiality of that important position.\r\nThe General Assembly should have a strong role \r\nin the appointments of the senior management of \r\nthe United Nations Secretariat. The selection and \r\nappointment process of the Secretary-General should \r\nbe more transparent and inclusive. The process should \r\ninvolve the entire membership of the United Nations. \r\nMany resolutions have been adopted assigning the \r\nGeneral Assembly a greater role in the process. \r\nWe regret that most of the provisions regarding the \r\nselection and appointment of the Secretary-General \r\nare being overlooked. In that regard, we call for full \r\nimplementation of the relevant provisions in considering \r\nfuture appointments.\r\nThe objective of revitalization is to render the \r\nAssembly more efficient and effective. It will require \r\nimprovement of working methods and an adjustment of \r\nthe agenda to meet current global realities. Discussions \r\non improving working methods have been exhaustive, \r\nand we recognize some improvements. We appreciate \r\nthe convening of thematic debates and high-level \r\nevents aimed at establishing a broad international \r\nunderstanding of current issues. The General Committee \r\nalso has an important role to play in considering ways \r\nand means to further improve the Assembly’s working \r\nmethods and improve its efficiency. \r\nThe agenda of the General Assembly has grown \r\nsteadily in response to global demands and expectations. \r\nThat has also led to a reduction in the actual time \r\navailable to focus on any particular issue. We concur \r\nwith the numerous General Assembly resolutions that \r\ncall for rationalizing and streamlining the agenda so \r\nthat we can pay more attention to priority issues. We \r\nsupport the biennialization, triennialization, clustering \r\nor even elimination of some items, while preserving \r\noptions to add new items.\r\nThe number of reports requested should also be \r\nrationalized, so as to improve the quality and precision \r\nof documents and to permit more focused deliberation. \r\nWe suggest that all of those actions be undertaken with \r\nthe clear consent of the co-sponsoring or concerned \r\nStates. There should be no attempt to employ artificial \r\ndeadlines or so-called sunset clauses to remove an item \r\nwithout prior approval of the General Assembly or \r\nconsent of the concerned State.\r\nThe issue of revitalization is a matter that requires \r\npolitical will. Technical improvement is possible \r\nthrough implementation of the proposals already made, \r\nbut a true revitalization of the body would require \r\ngenuine political will and openness. Let us garner such \r\npolitical will to make the General Assembly a truly \r\ndeliberative and decision-making body for the benefit \r\nof all of humankind.\r\nMr. Al Habib (Islamic Republic of Iran): I am \r\npleased that the General Assembly is focusing due \r\nattention on the old yet crucially important issue of \r\nthe revitalization of its work within the core of the \r\nworking agenda of this sixty-seventh session. Let \r\nme also take this opportunity to thank Ambassador \r\nSusan Waffa-Ogoo, Permanent Representative of \r\nthe Gambia, and Ambassador Alexander Lomaia, \r\nPermanent Representative of Georgia, for their \r\nexcellent stewardship of the Ad Hoc Working Group on \r\nthe Revitalization of the Work of the General Assembly \r\nduring the past session, leading to the adoption of \r\nresolution 66/294.\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran aligns itself with \r\nthe statement made by the Permanent Representative \r\nof Algeria on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement, \r\nwhich, we believe, introduced a number of key points \r\ninto this important debate. I would also like to make a \r\nfew additional remarks and underline some points of \r\nparticular significance.\r\nThe General Assembly debate on the revitalization \r\nof the work of the Assembly, held in December \r\n(see A/66/PV.70), reflected the urgent need to strengthen \r\nthe central role of the Assembly in addressing issues of \r\ngenuine concern to the international community in the \r\npolitical, economic and social arenas. In that connection, \r\nIran and all the members of the Non-Aligned Movement \r\nhave demonstrated their renewed commitment to \r\nengaging in a meaningful effort to reinforce the work \r\nof the General Assembly.\r\n18 12-54292\r\nA/67/PV.23\r\nstandards, making laws and establishing definitions in \r\nareas beyond its competence. Let me recall Article 13 of \r\nthe Charter, according to which the General Assembly, \r\nas the only universal organ representing every State \r\nMember of the United Nations, is primarily responsible \r\nfor the progressive development of international law \r\nand its codification.\r\nWith regard to the role and responsibility of the \r\nGeneral Assembly in the process of selecting and \r\nappointing the Secretary-General and in order to comply \r\nwith Article 97 of the Charter, we should not relegate \r\nthe role of the General Assembly to that of a rubber \r\nstamp. In our view, there is a strong desire among a \r\nlarge majority of the Members of the Organization to \r\narticulate and improve the procedure for the selection of \r\nthe Secretary-General by giving the General Assembly \r\na more meaningful and determining role in it.\r\nAt the same time, ensuring the effectiveness of the \r\nOffice of the President of the General Assembly is also \r\nan important factor in enhancing the role and authority \r\nof the General Assembly. In that regard, we reiterate \r\nthe importance of strengthening the institutional \r\nmemory of the Office of the President by allocating to \r\nit sufficient human and financial resources from the \r\nregular budget of the United Nations, so as to enable \r\nall Member States, developed and developing, to have \r\nan equal opportunity to assume the presidency of the \r\nAssembly efficiently and effectively.\r\nIn conclusion, we believe that focusing only \r\non procedural aspects and the working methods of \r\nthe Assembly, important as they are, will not lead \r\nto the comprehensive improvement in its work that \r\nis long overdue. For that, a fundamental shift, an \r\nall-embracing approach and a vigorous effort are \r\nneeded. The revitalization of the General Assembly, \r\nas part of the comprehensive reform of the United \r\nNations, is a dynamic and continuing process. We \r\nshould remain committed and constructive throughout \r\nthat ongoing exercise, with a view to strengthening \r\nthe role and authority of the Assembly as the most \r\nrepresentative and chief deliberative and policymaking \r\norgan of the United Nations. My delegation stands \r\nready to participate actively in the future deliberations \r\nto be held in that framework in a transparent, open and \r\ninclusive manner.\r\nMr. Hermida Castillo (Nicaragua) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): The delegation of Nicaragua would like \r\nto thank the President for organizing this meeting. \r\nNicaragua endorses the statement made by the \r\nSince 1991, we have adopted 20 resolutions \r\ncontaining specific measures aimed at revitalizing and \r\nenhancing the work of the General Assembly as the most \r\nrepresentative and chief deliberative and policy-making \r\nprincipal organ of the United Nations. Unfortunately, \r\nthose measures, adopted by consensus, have not been \r\nfully implemented, owing mainly to the lack of the \r\npolitical will needed to ensure that the Assembly plays \r\nits leading role in joint global governance. A thorough \r\nevaluation of the status of implementation of General \r\nAssembly resolutions and a clear identification of the \r\nunderlying reasons for their lack of implementation \r\nare therefore crucial to gradually eliminating the \r\nconstraints that still prevent the revitalization process \r\nfrom achieving its full potential.\r\nThe fact that a large number of United Nations \r\nresolutions have dealt with the revitalization of the \r\nrole and authority of the General Assembly clearly \r\ndemonstrates how important the enhancement of the \r\ncentral role and authority of that organ is for the general \r\nmembership. The Assembly should take the lead in \r\nsetting the global agenda and restoring the credibility \r\nand centrality of the United Nations in the formulation \r\nof multilateral approaches to resolving international \r\nissues. That was the role intended for the Assembly as \r\nexpressed in Article 10 of the Charter, namely, that it \r\nshould discuss any questions or matters within the scope \r\nof the Charter or relating to the powers and functions of \r\nany of the organs provided for in the Charter. We should \r\ntherefore increase our efforts to explore concrete ways \r\nand means towards full realization of the Assembly’s \r\nfunctions and powers, as laid down in the Charter.\r\nRegarding relations between the General Assembly \r\nand the other principal organs of the United Nations, \r\nthe relationship between the General Assembly and the \r\nSecurity Council, in particular, has been a matter of \r\nextensive debate, especially in the context of the various \r\nreform efforts, for many years. A considerable number \r\nof Assembly resolutions have established various \r\ncriteria aimed at clarifying the relationship between \r\nthose two important principal organs. The Charter \r\nconfers important functions and responsibilities on \r\nboth bodies. \r\nNonetheless, in recent years we have witnessed \r\nnumerous cases of the Security Council’s gradual but \r\npersistent encroachment on the functions and powers of \r\nthe Assembly and other organs, such as the Economic \r\nand Social Council. We are particularly concerned \r\nabout the Security Council’s practice of setting \r\n12-54292 19\r\nA/67/PV.23\r\nalso important to say that all resolutions adopted by \r\nconsensus on the revitalization of the Assembly should \r\nbe implemented fully and as quickly as possible, so as \r\nto actually achieve that goal. \r\nWe must rebuff all attempts to minimize the \r\nachievements and importance of the General Assembly, \r\nto diminish its role and functions or to impugn its \r\nrelevance and credibility. For the good of all of the \r\npeoples we represent, the voice and the votes of all \r\nStates Members of the Organization should be ever \r\nmore loudly heard. Nicaragua will continue to support \r\nall efforts to strengthen the central role and authority \r\nof the General Assembly, and we are always ready to \r\nengage in constructive debate on any issue that will \r\nlead to improving the work of our Organization.\r\nMr. Raza Bashir Tarar (Pakistan): We thank \r\nthe President of the General Assembly for convening \r\nthis debate, which deals with a subject of paramount \r\nimportance for Member States. Pakistan pledges its full \r\nsupport and cooperation.\r\nWe appreciate the work done by the two co-Chairs \r\nof the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Revitalization \r\nof the Work of the General Assembly, as well as that \r\nof their predecessors. We also align ourselves with \r\nthe statement made on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement.\r\nIn the past two decades, much effort has been \r\ndirected towards the shared goal of revitalizing this \r\nunique and universal body. It has been a worthwhile \r\npursuit for several reasons. Together we have made \r\nconsiderable progress in rationalizing and streamlining \r\nthe work of the Committees. Our collective effort has \r\nled to increased financial savings and efficiency gains. \r\nWe have also raised the profile of the General Assembly.\r\nHowever, for many of us, the revitalization debate \r\nseems to be losing vitality. Concerns persist over a \r\nrange of issues, including the non-implementation of \r\nresolutions, the growing encroachment by the Security \r\nCouncil on the role and authority of the Assembly, the \r\nmarginalization of Assembly’s role in the selection \r\nand appointment of the Secretary-General and others. \r\nPerhaps, we first need to revitalize the revitalization \r\ndebate.\r\nAs to the reform of the Security Council, it can be \r\nmeaningful only if it is decided with the widest possible \r\nmargin of agreement and in a spirit of compromise and \r\nf lexibility. Any exercise in reform should make the \r\nrepresentative of Algeria on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement, which expressed our position and that of the \r\nmajority of the States Members of this Organization. \r\nOur delegation reiterates its firm commitment to \r\nthe process of revitalizing and democratizing the \r\nGeneral Assembly, and we wish to continue to work \r\nconstructively, so that the Assembly can be seen to be, \r\nin every aspect, the most representative and legitimate \r\norgan of the Organization.\r\nAs we have stated on various occasions, Nicaragua \r\nconsiders the democratization of the United Nations \r\nto be very important; in order to achieve that goal \r\nwe must continue to work to restore the authority of \r\nthe General Assembly and enable it to function as the \r\nchief deliberative, standard-setting and democratic \r\norgan of the Organization. We believe that the process \r\nof revitalizing the work of the Assembly must be \r\nuniversal, transparent and accountable, arrived at \r\nthrough open and inclusive consultations, which \r\nare a critical component of United Nations reform, \r\nincluding reform of the Security Council. The Council \r\ncannot continue to usurp the functions and powers \r\nof the General Assembly. The process of electing the \r\nSecretary-General is also very important.\r\nCarrying out that initiative will require restoring \r\nand increasing the authority of the General Assembly, \r\nwhich in turn will require restoring its functions \r\nand jurisdiction and strengthening its relations and \r\ncollaboration with other organs of the Organization. \r\nSuch a reinvigoration of the General Assembly would \r\nmake it able to answer the needs of all 193 Member \r\nStates equally and fulfil the principle of the equality of \r\nall Members. \r\nA similar reinvigoration is essential for the Office \r\nof the President of the General Assembly. Measures \r\nmust be taken and procedures put in place to augment \r\nits human and financial resources. Every State should \r\nhave the possibility of presiding over the Assembly. \r\nFinancial considerations should not be an impediment. \r\nIncreased funding for the Office is therefore important \r\nto strengthening the General Assembly.\r\nThe Nicaraguan delegation believes that the \r\nGeneral Assembly should more rigorously fulfil its \r\nresponsibilities in the nomination and appointment \r\nof the Secretary-General, and should engage Member \r\nStates’ participation in a more inclusive way. Likewise, \r\nall Member States should have increased input into \r\nthe debate about and the election of candidates. It is \r\n20 12-54292\r\nA/67/PV.23\r\nWe strongly believe that the revitalization of the \r\nGeneral Assembly will help strengthen the determination \r\nof Member States to pursue multilateralism, which \r\nwill, in turn, have a major and far-reaching impact on \r\nrebuilding the authority and credibility of the United \r\nNations system as a whole. In that regard, we wish to \r\nunderline the critical importance of the Ad Hoc Working \r\nGroup, and we urge it to build upon its progress in \r\nprevious sessions. To that end, we are convinced that \r\nresolutions 65/315 and 66/294 in particular, along with \r\nother earlier resolutions, can and should serve as the \r\nbasis for the work of Ad Hoc Working Group.\r\nAs for the relationship of the General Assembly to \r\nthe other principal organs of the United Nations, my \r\ndelegation is of the view that it remains important to \r\nimprove transparency, the exchange of information \r\nand cooperation. The General Assembly should benefit \r\nfrom information about meetings between the President \r\nof the General Assembly, the Security Council and the \r\nEconomic and Social Council, as well as meetings \r\ninvolving the Chairs of subsidiary bodies. \r\nPeriodic briefings by the President of the General \r\nAssembly on his recent activities, including official \r\ntravel, continue to be an appreciated practice and are a \r\nvaluable source of information. We also appreciate the \r\ncontinued practice of holding periodic informal briefings \r\nby the Secretary-General on his priorities, travels and \r\nmost recent activities, including his participation in \r\ninternational meetings and events organized outside the \r\nUnited Nations, and we encourage him to continue with \r\nthat practice.\r\nOn the issue of working methods, we would like \r\nto stress the need for the further rationalization and \r\nstreamlining of the agendas of the General Assembly \r\nand its Main Committees, so as to better define the \r\nfocus and avoid duplication in our deliberations. In \r\nthat regard, leadership by the Chairs and the Bureaux \r\nof the Main Committees is of particular importance. \r\nAlthough each Main Committee is master of its own \r\nrules of procedure, we believe that streamlining and \r\nstandardizing certain rules would lead to greater \r\nefficient in the work of the Committees.\r\nWhile noting with appreciation the progress \r\nachieved so far, we feel that debates in the General \r\nAssembly have often shown duplication, resulting \r\nin the adoption of overlapping resolutions without an \r\neffective mechanism for assessing and evaluating their \r\nimplementation, with the result that the assessment’s \r\nCouncil more democratic and accountable to the general \r\nmembership and not create new centres of privilege. \r\nIn a new debate on revitalization, it would be useful \r\nto focus on two mutually reinforcing aspects, efficiency \r\nand efficacy. In some ways, considerable discussion has \r\nalready taken place on improving the working methods \r\nof United Nations bodies, including the Assembly and \r\nits Committees. In fact, several measures have been \r\nadopted, including a more streamlined programme of \r\nwork, the biennialization or triennialization of agenda \r\nresolutions and the early selection of the Chairs of the \r\nCommittees and Bureaus. \r\nHowever, those steps have essentially focused \r\non efficiency and rationalization, and much progress \r\nhas indeed been made on that count. Yet, to many of \r\nus, the effectiveness and authority of the Assembly \r\nseems to remain a largely unfulfilled task. We must \r\ntherefore dig deeper and identify the real causes behind \r\nthe conundrum whereby efficiency gains seemingly \r\ncontinue to defeat the larger political imperative of \r\neffectiveness. We look forward to a more focused debate \r\non the correlation between the objectives of efficiency \r\nand effectiveness.\r\nIt may also be worthwhile to explore new ideas \r\nabout how to bring more vigour, visibility and attention \r\nto the revitalization debate. We propose that the Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group examine the possibility of convening \r\na high-level meeting in the future. We support the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement’s suggestion in that regard and \r\nlook forward to exchanging views within the Working \r\nGroup.\r\nMr. Workie (Ethiopia): At the outset, allow \r\nme to join others in commending the Permanent \r\nRepresentatives of the Gambia and Georgia for their \r\nvery hard and valuable work in co-facilitating the Ad \r\nHoc Working Group on the Revitalization of the Work \r\nof the General Assembly during the previous session. \r\nAllow me also to align my delegation with the statement \r\nmade by the Permanent Representative of Algeria on \r\nbehalf of the Non-Aligned Movement.\r\nThe General Assembly is not only one of the \r\nprincipal organs of the United Nations but also its most \r\nrepresentative and chief deliberative, policy-making \r\nbody. No other intergovernmental body in the world \r\nenjoys such a universal membership or covers such \r\na broad spectrum of issues as the General Assembly. \r\nThat breadth of membership and scope has a direct \r\nimpact on international peace and security.\r\n12-54292 21\r\nA/67/PV.23\r\nof that Office. In that regard, resolution 66/294, which \r\nallocates the necessary budget to and strengthens \r\nthe human resources component of the Office of the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly, is of critical \r\nimportance.\r\nIn conclusion, Ethiopia is ready, as in the past, to \r\nextend its cooperation and looks forward to doing so \r\nby working with the Ad Hoc Working Group during \r\nthe current session. We believe that the continuation \r\nof the discussion within the Ad Hoc Working Group \r\ncontributes to moving forward not only the process of \r\nthe revitalization of the General Assembly but also the \r\nenhancement of the overall reform efforts of the United \r\nNations system, including the Security Council.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): We have \r\nheard the last speaker in the debate on the agenda items \r\nbefore us. The Assembly has thus concluded this stage \r\nof its consideration of agenda items 115 and 116.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.35 p.m.\r\nrelevance or effectiveness in helping to achieve the \r\ndesired outcomes is undermined. In that regard, we are \r\nin favour of launching the regular review of resolutions \r\nand decisions adopted previously by the Assembly and \r\nof making the necessary adjustments on the basis of the \r\nresults stemming from their implementation.\r\nThe selection and appointment of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral is yet another issue of great interest to the wider \r\nmembership. Our view on the subject is that, without \r\nprejudice to Article 97 of the Charter, the Assembly \r\nshould play a more meaningful role in the process of \r\nthe selection and appointment of the Secretary-General \r\nof the United Nations. We share the views expressed \r\nby others that there must be substantive interaction \r\nbetween the candidates and the Assembly and that due \r\nregard must continue to be given to regional rotation.\r\nEnsuring the effectiveness of the Office of the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly is also essential \r\nto improving the role and authority of the Assembly, \r\nincluding through enhancing the institutional memory \r\n"
