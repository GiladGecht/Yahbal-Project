I believe that \r\nensuring Africa’s development should be a strategic \r\ntask for the entire United Nations system. NEPAD is \r\nan excellent platform on which we can move forward \r\ntogether, for it has established itself as a truly credible \r\ninternational partner in providing a realistic vision \r\nand policy framework for the continent’s renewal and \r\ndevelopment in the twenty-first century. As President \r\nof the General Assembly, I fully endorse NEPAD’s \r\nwork as an African-owned and African-led blueprint \r\nfor the future.\r\nIn my previous capacity, I was privileged to travel \r\nto Africa on almost 40 different occasions for bilateral \r\nvisits or to attend ministerial meetings and summits \r\nof the African Union. For me, Africa is a place of \r\nenormous potential and endurance. It has shown great \r\ndetermination to overcome seemingly insurmountable \r\nobstacles, including centuries of exploitation unique in \r\nthe annals of human history.\r\nAs many African States celebrate five decades \r\nof their independence, allow me to reflect back for a \r\nmoment on the role the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) \r\nplayed in the continent’s quest to affirm its dignity on \r\nthe world stage. Perhaps no foreign policy achievement \r\nin my nation’s history fills me with as much pride \r\nas the role that we played in NAM. For me, its 1961 \r\ninaugural summit in Belgrade represents the moment \r\nwhen the empowerment of the majority of the human \r\nrace became irreversible. At its birth, the Movement \r\nasserted the aim of establishing what the first Belgrade \r\nDeclaration termed a “new order based on cooperation \r\nbetween nations, founded on freedom, equality, and \r\nsocial justice for the promotion of prosperity”.\r\nI have cherished this legacy throughout my career \r\nthus far. As President of the General Assembly, I want to \r\ncontinue to build on this way of engaging with Africa, \r\nencouraging African solutions to African challenges. \r\nThe United Nations has become an important actor in \r\nthe efforts to achieve the full political and economic \r\npotential of the continent, thanks in large part to the \r\nhard work of the Secretary-General and his Special \r\nAdviser on Africa.\r\nUnited Nations A/67/PV.25\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-seventh session\r\n25th plenary meeting\r\nWednesday, 17 October 2012, 10 a.m.\r\nNew York\r\nOffi cial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Jeremić . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Serbia)\r\n2 12 55213\r\nA/67/PV.25\r\nSomalia’s eight-year political transition came to an \r\nend with the election of Mr. Hassan Sheikh Mohamud as \r\nPresident, opening a new phase of peacebuilding in the \r\ncountry. The Sudan and South Sudan are negotiating a \r\nseries of agreements to fully normalize their relations. \r\nThese are two encouraging trends, and, thankfully, \r\nthere are many more.\r\nYet the grave security and humanitarian situation \r\nin the Sahel remains truly alarming. I believe it \r\nrequires our urgent attention. The United Nations \r\nrecently adopted a resilience action plan for the Sahel. \r\nCombining short-, medium- and long-term goals, it is \r\ndesigned to enable the region to overcome a persistent \r\npattern of recurring and increasingly acute crises.\r\nOne of the most dangerous of these is the threat of \r\nsecession. In Mali, terrorists have taken over some of the \r\ncountry’s northern territories, displacing hundreds of \r\nthousands and impacting the stability of neighbouring \r\ncountries. We must strongly support Mali’s sovereignty \r\nand territorial integrity, as well as that of every other \r\nMember State. This includes the countries of the Great \r\nLakes region, another worrying area. With all due \r\nrespect to existing efforts to ameliorate the crisis, I \r\ndo not think that we are devoting enough resources to \r\naddressing the complex challenges facing that part of \r\nthe world. As President, I will work with all relevant \r\nstakeholders to help generate the political will necessary \r\nfor peace and security to fully take hold.\r\nThe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) must \r\nremain at the core of our shared vision for a prosperous, \r\npeaceful and equitable Africa. We hear predictions that \r\na number of countries will not achieve the MDGs by the \r\n2015 deadline. I believe, however, that by redoubling \r\nour efforts, the targets can still be largely met. I look \r\nforward to hearing from African delegations on what the \r\nGeneral Assembly can do to ensure expedited progress \r\nover the next three years. One of the most important \r\nquestions we face, in my view, is how to overcome the \r\nlack of fulfilment of monetary commitments, as per \r\nresolution 66/293.\r\nWe also have to keep looking at the longer term. \r\nThat is why the General Assembly will need to focus on \r\nthe post-2015 agenda, especially as it applies to Africa. \r\nThis body has been mandated to implement what was \r\nagreed by world leaders in June in Rio de Janeiro, \r\nBrazil. As President, I will push preparations for a high-\r\nlevel forum, to be convened at beginning of the sixty-\r\neighth session. I will also engage with Member States \r\non the establishment of a working group to define a list \r\nof sustainable development goals for consideration and \r\nadoption by the plenary.\r\nAfrican concerns, and those of the rest of the \r\ndeveloping world, should be high on the agenda, \r\nincluding those that fall within NEPAD’s six areas \r\nof focus, starting with youth employment and \r\ninfrastructure expansion. I also wish to underscore the \r\nimportance of ensuring that our efforts and those of \r\nthe Secretary-General’s High-level Panel of Eminent \r\nPersons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda are \r\nmutually reinforcing and complementary.\r\nAdditional resources will no doubt be needed in \r\norder to successfully implement the conclusions of the \r\nUnited Nations Conference on Sustainable Development \r\n(Rio+20). I will prioritize the establishment of an \r\nintergovernmental process, under the framework of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and in line with the mandate this body \r\nwas given in Rio, to recommend options for an effective \r\nfinancing strategy. I believe that moving forward in the \r\nbold undertaking envisaged by the Rio+20 Conference \r\nnot only complements but will decisively reinforce \r\nall other efforts to strengthen international peace and \r\nsecurity, especially in the African context.\r\nA number of African countries are the hardest-\r\nhit victims of the global economic crisis. Despite \r\nthis troubling reality, growth rates in many parts \r\nof the continent have been resilient. Over the past \r\nseveral years, trade and investment have expanded, \r\nthe continent-wide internal market has been built \r\nup, and macroeconomic indicators have improved. \r\nBy any measure, this progress is unprecedented and \r\nremarkable.\r\nYet much more needs to be done in a number of \r\nareas. That includes finding solutions on how to lessen \r\nthe difference in living standards between urban and \r\nrural populations and properly addressing the increasing \r\ndisparities among the continent’s economies. To be \r\neven more effective, I believe the various assistance \r\nmechanisms should more closely reflect NEPAD’s \r\nagenda and those of the individual African Member \r\nStates. The voices of those in need must be heard loud \r\nand clear. What they say has to serve as a significant \r\nguidepost for our way forward.\r\nTo bridge the gap between the promise of Africa \r\nand the reality on the ground, I believe the United \r\nNations must continue to give priority to the continent’s \r\nsingular needs. The United Nations agencies, \r\nprogrammes and entities need to become engaged, as \r\n12 55213 3\r\nA/67/PV.25\r\nAfrica is the world’s youngest continent in terms \r\nof the median age of its population, which is growing \r\nrapidly and will reach 2 billion by 2050, when the \r\nmajority will be under 25 years old. That situation is \r\ncertainly a major challenge, but it is also a tremendous \r\nopportunity. Therefore, the promotion of decent \r\nemployment, particularly for young people, must \r\nremain a key element of the strategies implemented \r\nby NEPAD. This, too, is why, for many years now, \r\nLuxembourg has placed particular stress on capacity-\r\nbuilding and vocational training for young people in its \r\ndevelopment cooperation programmes for the African \r\ncontinent.\r\nThe report before us shows the significant progress \r\nachieved by African Governments in the sectoral \r\napplication of NEPAD. In that context, I would \r\nparticularly note governance, where an ever-increasing \r\nnumber of countries participate in the African Peer \r\nReview Mechanism. In parallel, important progress \r\nhas been made in the area of infrastructure to promote \r\nregional integration, and with respect to information \r\nand communications technologies. Luxembourg \r\nactively supports African Union programmes to \r\nimprove internet connectivity linking all of the \r\ncontinent’s capitals and major population hubs, as well \r\nas initiatives promoting regional integration in Africa.\r\nWe welcome the fact that numerous African \r\ncountries continue to make progress towards the \r\ngoal of allocating 10 per cent of their budget to \r\nagriculture, in accordance with the provisions of the \r\nMaputo Declaration on Agriculture and Food Security. \r\nThose significant efforts contribute directly to the \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals and \r\nnotably towards achieving Goal 1, which is to reduce \r\nthe number of those suffering from hunger by half.\r\nAs a multilateral instrument, NEPAD follows a \r\nlogic based on the principles of mutual accountability \r\nand partnership, by underlining the commitments made \r\nboth by development partners and by African countries.\r\nI wish to underscore that the fight against poverty \r\nis a stated priority of Luxembourg. Since the year \r\n2000, Luxembourg has reached the target set by the \r\nUnited Nations by dedicating at least 0.7 per cent of \r\nits gross national income (GNI) to official development \r\nassistance (ODA). In 2009 and 2010, our ODA surpassed \r\nthe threshold of 1 per cent of GNI. The Government \r\nof Luxembourg is determined to maintain that \r\neffort, despite budgetary constraints. Our assistance \r\nis benefiting least developed countries (LDCs) in \r\nnever before, in the task of supporting African nations \r\nto unlock their full potential. In my view, the overall \r\ncredibility of this Organization may well stand or fall \r\ndepending on whether it can help fulfil what one of \r\nthe world’s greatest living statesmen, Nelson Mandela, \r\nonce defined his dream as an Africa that is at peace \r\nwith itself, the dream of realizing the unity whereby \r\nAfrican leaders combine in their efforts to solve, for \r\ngood, the problems of this continent.\r\nMr. Asselborn (Luxembourg) (spoke in French): \r\nMr. President — my dear friend Vuk Jeremić — allow me \r\nto commend the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, \r\nfor the reports guiding our work today, and to welcome \r\nMr. Maged Abdelaziz, Under-Secretary-General and \r\nSpecial Adviser on Africa, to whom I wish every \r\nsuccess in his new role.\r\nThe reports before us (A/67/204 and A/67/205) \r\ncomplement each other well, given that the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) \r\ncontains some important elements in terms of \r\nresponding to the question of promoting sustainable \r\npeace and development in Africa. Furthermore, the \r\nimprovement of public health, notably by combating the \r\nscourge of malaria, is a vital contribution in promoting \r\nthe well-being of peoples and laying the foundation for \r\nsustainable development.\r\nIn that regard, it is particularly welcome that at the \r\nend of the last session, the General Assembly adopted \r\nby consensus resolution 66/293, which establishes a \r\nmonitoring mechanism to review commitments made \r\ntowards Africa’s development. It is naturally within \r\nthe United Nations — by definition, the most inclusive \r\nand legitimate multilateral forum — that it is possible \r\nto ensure the consistency of all processes deployed \r\nglobally and multilaterally in favour of development, \r\nand more particularly in favour of Africa. Among \r\nthose initiatives, NEPAD occupies a special place, in \r\nthe sense that it presents a collective African vision \r\nof development and of the integration of the African \r\ncontinent into the world economy.\r\nIn 2011, despite the global crisis, the African \r\ncontinent distinguished itself as one of the regions with \r\nthe most continuous growth rates in the world; and \r\nThe Economist  was on target in dedicating a special \r\nissue to the subject of “Africa rising” in December 2011. \r\nIndeed, when one considers the future, the economic \r\noutlook remains optimistic despite important regional \r\ndisparities.\r\n4 12 55213\r\nA/67/PV.25\r\nparticular. Here again, we surpass the target set by the \r\nUnited Nations, by allocating more than 0.20 per cent of \r\nour GNI to LDCs, most of which — as is known — are \r\nin Africa.\r\nThe report on the causes of conflict and the \r\npromotion of a durable peace and sustainable \r\ndevelopment in Africa underlines that the continent has \r\nshown mixed results in the past year. A number of grave \r\ncrises have marred an otherwise positive overall trend. \r\nBy taking into account last year’s popular movements \r\nin North Africa, the report underscores the obligation \r\nto give renewed attention to models of governance and \r\ndemocratic evolution, as well as to the necessity of \r\ninclusive economic development which gives priority \r\nto the creation of decent jobs.\r\nAllow me to concentrate on one aspect in particular \r\nof the report of the Secretary-General, namely, exclusion. \r\nExclusion is one of the main triggers of conflict and \r\nhinders sustainable development. Our Head of State said \r\nas much in this very Hall in the general debate, when \r\nhe stated, “to ensure lasting peace, one must tackle the \r\nroot causes of conflicts”. He cited among those root \r\ncauses in particular “social inequalities resulting from \r\npersistent poverty”(A/67/PV.9, p. 11). Luxembourg fully \r\nsubscribes to the recommendation of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral encouraging African Governments, with \r\nthe help of the United Nations system, to survey and \r\nimplement participatory and equitable policies, which \r\nreduce inequalities of access to basic social services \r\nand economic opportunities, in particular for young \r\npeople, women and other marginalized groups.\r\nFor its part, Luxembourg has for many years \r\nbeen supporting initiatives by African civil society \r\naimed at ensuring effective citizen participation by \r\nvulnerable groups, notably women and young people. \r\nLuxembourg’s experience in the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission has further strengthened our conviction \r\nthat the recommendation is equally relevant for \r\npeacebuilding efforts, in order to avoid a relapse into \r\nviolence.\r\nLuxembourg welcomes the efforts made in the fight \r\nagainst malaria. Our objective must be its complete \r\neradication in all developing countries, especially in \r\nAfrica, by 2015, in conformity with resolution 66/289, \r\nadopted by the Assembly at the past session, with \r\nLuxembourg as one of the sponsors. Time is short. \r\nTo achieve Millennium Development Goal 6, we need \r\nrenewed commitment by all stakeholders, within the \r\nframework of a global and consistent approach.\r\nLuxembourg is answering that call by giving \r\npriority to the strengthening of health systems in \r\nthe partner countries of its development cooperation \r\npolicy. We supplement that approach by partnering \r\nwith multilateral stakeholders such as the World Health \r\nOrganization, whose activities in the fight against \r\nmalaria and tropical disease research programme we \r\nsupport with an annual contribution of €3 million. \r\nSimilarly, our annual voluntary contribution to the \r\nbudget of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis \r\nand Malaria amounts to €2.5 million. We need to be \r\ncreative and innovative, not only when it comes to \r\nthe financing of access to prevention and treatment \r\nof malaria but also so as not to lose sight of the wider \r\ncontext in which the disease evolves and to strengthen \r\nnational health systems in a sustainable manner.\r\nI would like to conclude by underlining that \r\nLuxembourg’s commitment to Africa is proof of \r\nour conviction that we must adopt a holistic and \r\nmultidimensional approach, taking into account \r\ndevelopment issues, peacebuilding issues and issues \r\nrelated to the maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity. We must recognize the intrinsic links among \r\nsecurity, development and respect for human rights \r\nand the rule of law. All of those elements deserve clear \r\nfocus as we embark together on defining the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda.\r\nMrs. Kaur (India): I am honoured to address the \r\nAssembly at today’s joint debate on the New Partnership \r\nfor Africa’s Development, progress in implementation \r\nand international support, and the Decade to Roll \r\nBack Malaria in Developing Countries. Allow me to \r\nconvey our sincerest appreciation to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his timely and extremely informative \r\nreports on the agenda items under discussion today \r\n(A/67/204 and A/67/205).\r\nThe New Partnership for Africa’s Development \r\n(NEPAD) articulates both a vision and a strategic \r\nsocioeconomic development framework for Africa. \r\nIndia applauds the progress achieved by Africa in the \r\nimplementation of NEPAD priorities over the past 10 \r\nyears through multisectoral initiatives in agriculture, \r\ninfrastructure, health, education, science, information \r\ntechnology and the environment.\r\nHowever, despite those positive strides, serious \r\nchallenges remain to be addressed before the African \r\ncontinent can achieve all-round development and \r\nprosperity. Extreme poverty, hunger, lack of adequate \r\nnutrition, conflicts and other ills continue to shackle \r\n12 55213 5\r\nA/67/PV.25\r\nthe tremendous potential of the African people. It is \r\ntherefore important to acknowledge that addressing \r\nAfrica’s development needs and challenges requires an \r\nunwavering commitment backed by resolute action, not \r\nonly from within Africa but, equally important, from \r\noutside the continent.\r\nIt is imperative that the international community \r\nremain resolute in its support for Africa through \r\nsustained cooperation, including transfer of \r\ntechnology and resources and an enabling international \r\nenvironment. As pointed out in the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport, as a proportion of the total global aid allocation \r\nin 2011 provided by the Organization for Economic \r\nCooperation and Development, Africa’s share remained \r\nvirtually unchanged at a mere 37 per cent. Indeed, to date \r\nAfrica has received only half of the pledged increase \r\nmade at the Group of Eight Summit in Gleneagles. The \r\ninternational community therefore needs to urgently \r\naddress that gaping gap between promise and delivery. \r\nIn these times of political uncertainty and economic \r\nmeltdown, it is more incumbent than ever on the \r\ncontinent’s development partners to stay the course and \r\nhelp African countries achieve their development goals.\r\nThe India-Africa relationship is based on firm \r\nhistorical foundations and over the decades has \r\ngrown into one of the most productive and durable \r\npartnerships. Our similar historical experiences have \r\nengendered a common world view. Understanding \r\nand sensitivity to each other’s strengths, requirements \r\nand constraints have given our partnership lasting \r\nstrength and resilience. India is today on a path of rapid \r\neconomic growth. Africa is also witnessing a phase of \r\nrobust resurgence. Some of the world’s fastest-growing \r\neconomies are in Africa, and Africa is blessed with \r\na young and dynamic population. We have therefore, \r\ntogether with our African friends, transformed our \r\nage-old and traditional bond into an enduring and \r\nmultidimensional relationship.\r\nOur partnership with Africa is aligned with the \r\npriorities integral to the development goals of Africa \r\nand is built on the foundations of mutual equality and \r\ncommon benefit. At the Second India-Africa Forum \r\nSummit in 2011, India committed $5 billion for the next \r\nthree years in lines of credit to help our African partners \r\nachieve their development goals. We also committed an \r\nadditional $700 million to establish new institutions and \r\ntraining programmes, in consultation with the African \r\nUnion and its institutions. We also decided to support \r\nthe development of a new Ethio-Djibouti railway line in \r\nthe amount of $300 million, in keeping with NEPAD’s \r\npriority of infrastructure development.\r\nFollowing the success of the Pan-African e-Network \r\nProject, we are working on the establishment of an \r\nIndia-Africa virtual university, which will help to \r\nmeet some of the demand in Africa for higher studies \r\nin Indian institutions. We are making available 10,000 \r\nnew scholarships to the university exclusively for \r\nAfrican students. Our total commitment until 2014 \r\nby way of scholarships to African students, including \r\nunder the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation \r\nProgramme, stands at more than 22,000. To strengthen \r\ntrade and investment f lows, in May we launched the \r\nIndia Africa Business Council, whose core sectors \r\nof cooperation include agriculture, manufacturing, \r\npharmaceuticals, textiles, mining, petroleum \r\nand natural gas, Internet technology and Internet \r\ntechnology-enabled services, financial services, \r\nincluding microfinance, energy, roads and railways.\r\nGiven the sheer potential of untapped trade, we \r\nhave raised our bilateral trade target to $90 billion \r\nby 2015 from the $70 billion target set earlier. We are \r\nalready making available duty-free and quota-free \r\nmarket access for goods from 34 of the least developed \r\ncountries (LDCs) in Africa, which covers 94 per cent \r\nof India’s total tariff lines and provides preferential \r\nmarket access on tariff lines that add up to 92.5 per \r\ncent of the global exports of all LDCs. Moreover, under \r\nthe India-Brazil-South Africa Facility for Hunger and \r\nPoverty Alleviation trust fund, we have completed \r\nseveral successful projects in Burundi, Cape Verde, \r\nGuinea-Bissau and Sierra Leone for strengthening \r\ninfrastructure and capacity-building.\r\nIndia’s capacity-building partnership with Africa \r\nincludes training for medical specialists to tackle \r\npandemics like malaria, HIV and tuberculosis. \r\nOur private sector has invested substantially in \r\npharmaceutical manufacturing facilities in several \r\nAfrican countries. We remain committed to the \r\ncomplete elimination of malaria and would like to \r\nthank the Secretary-General for adopting that as one of \r\nhis top priorities.\r\nIndia’s engagement with Africa is built on a \r\nstrong focus on comprehensive capacity-building, \r\ncontributing to human resource development and \r\nfacilitating greater intra-African cooperation. We have \r\nredirected our age-old bonds of friendship to respond \r\nto the contemporary aspirations of our peoples and \r\nare building a partnership that is increasingly being \r\n6 12 55213\r\nA/67/PV.25\r\ncited as the beacon of South-South cooperation. That \r\npartnership, indeed, has the potential to strengthen \r\nglobal governance systems and democratize multilateral \r\ninstitutions.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to quote the words of \r\nmy Prime Minister, Mr. Manmohan Singh:\r\n“The twenty-first century is often described as \r\nthe Asian century. India wishes to see the twenty-\r\nfirst century as the century of Asia and Africa, with \r\nthe people of the two continents working together \r\nto promote inclusive globalization. Events in India \r\nand Africa in the middle of the twentieth century \r\nchanged the world. Today, we have a second chance \r\nto take charge of our own destiny and give new \r\nmeaning to the concept of sustainable, equitable \r\nand environment-friendly development.”\r\nMr. Maalim (United Republic of Tanzania): Despite \r\na century of scientific progress in preventing, treating \r\nand understanding the malaria parasite and its means of \r\nreproduction, malaria continues to be one of the world’s \r\nmost burdensome diseases. Malaria is concentrated in \r\nsub-Saharan Africa and disproportionately affects the \r\nrural poor. Rural households in sub-Saharan Africa \r\nare mostly engaged in agricultural production. Malaria \r\ninfection has a significant negative impact on such \r\nagricultural households, because it is both costly to \r\ntreat and damaging to household production due to loss \r\nof labour. In Tanzania, malaria remains one of the major \r\nhealth challenges. In mainland Tanzania, it is a leading \r\ncause of outpatient and inpatient hospital visits, such \r\nthat between 30 and 40 per cent of all outpatient visits \r\nare attributable to malaria. People die from malaria \r\nevery day, mainly children and pregnant women.\r\nOur Government has implemented several efforts \r\nto address malaria. Between 2008 and May 2012 we \r\nsucceeded in reducing its prevalence among young \r\nchildren by 44 per cent. In Zanzibar, deaths from \r\nmalaria are near zero. Our challenge in Zanzibar is to \r\nsustain that achievement. For mainland Tanzania, we \r\nare replicating lessons learned in Zanzibar, such as \r\nresidual spraying on malaria breeding sites; making \r\nlong-term insecticide-treated nets available at every bed \r\nsite; and providing early treatment for those infected, \r\nas well as control and surveillance aimed at preventing \r\nre-emergence and epidemics.\r\nWe have registered significant progress with the \r\navailability of long-lasting insecticide-treated nets. \r\nIn order to cover every sleeping space with treated \r\nnets as quickly as possible, the Government made a \r\ndeliberate decision to give free nets to all children and \r\nthen to every household. This progress, coupled with \r\ntargeted applications of indoor residual spraying and \r\nmodest increases in access to intermittent preventive \r\ntherapy, rapid diagnosis tests, and artemisinin-based \r\ncombination therapies (ACTs), has resulted in visible \r\nreductions in rates of malaria cases, hospital admissions \r\nand deaths.\r\nIn combating malaria, we already know what \r\ninterventions and tools are needed. We also know what \r\nworks and what does not. It is important to follow the \r\nrecommendations of the World Health Organization \r\n(WHO) on banning the use of monotherapies, although \r\nthat requires making the right combination therapies \r\navailable at affordable prices. In Tanzania, ACTs are \r\navailable in the public sector at no cost to pregnant \r\nwomen and children and at an affordable price for \r\nsome other groups. In the private sector, the price for \r\na course of treatment is high, which is a hindrance \r\nto the majority of the patients seeking treatment in \r\nprivate health centres. In that regard, the Government \r\nis partnering with the Affordable Medicines Facility, \r\na subsidy mechanism of the Global Fund, to support \r\naffordable ACTs to both sectors.\r\nIn our view, Governments should consider reducing \r\nor waiving taxes and tariffs for nets and other products \r\nneeded for malaria control, both to reduce the price of \r\nthe products for consumers and to stimulate free trade \r\nin those products. Tanzania was the first country in \r\nAfrica to do so. Eliminating such taxes and tariffs helps \r\nto reduce import delays and lowers prices in both the \r\npublic and the private sectors. The budget benefit to \r\nhealth far outweighs the revenue loss.\r\nIn spite of the very positive advances we have made, \r\nnumerous challenges remain. Certainly, success in the \r\nfight against malaria requires two things: leadership \r\nand resources. African leaders, through the African \r\nLeaders Malaria Alliance (ALMA), are providing the \r\nleadership and are working together to combat malaria. \r\nHowever, we face a huge resource gap. We all know \r\nthat malaria is a curable disease. Nonetheless, at this \r\npoint, and rightly so, our focus has been on prevention, \r\nas it is cheaper and easier. But establishing an effective \r\ntreatment infrastructure is also critical. Access to \r\nprompt, effective treatment is a key element to success \r\nin fighting malaria. And that access means having \r\nhealth-care facilities as well as health-care workers to \r\ndiagnose the disease and administer medication. That \r\n12 55213 7\r\nA/67/PV.25\r\nis where our problem lies. Most of our Governments \r\nin the developing world do not have the ability to \r\nguarantee access to treatment to the majority of people, \r\nparticularly in rural areas, where people suffer from \r\nmalaria without knowing it.\r\nIn the meantime, the Government has embarked on \r\na comprehensive programme to deal with the question \r\nof access to health care. We are building a dispensary \r\nin every village and a health-care centre in every ward. \r\nThis programme will certainly be instrumental to the \r\nsuccess of our anti-malaria effort, as it will guarantee \r\nprompt diagnosis and treatment. In the end, as we all \r\nknow, such programmes need massive resources, and \r\nthe Government cannot do it alone. We need support \r\nand partnership from the international community and \r\nthe private sector.\r\nWe are winning the battle against malaria. With \r\nthree years remaining until 2015, we must make \r\ngreater efforts to reach and even exceed the targets \r\nwe have set for ourselves. We must not only achieve \r\nuniversal coverage with effective interventions, we \r\nmust also work to remove stumbling blocks and \r\nbottlenecks that render our efforts less effective. We \r\nshould recommit, individually and collectively, to \r\nthe Abuja targets that we set ourselves. We should \r\nact on the WHO recommendations on banning the \r\nmarketing and use of monotherapies. We should also \r\nfind ways of accelerating the procurement of drugs and \r\ncommodities. Indeed, we must do whatever we can to \r\nwin the battle against malaria. We thank the secretariat \r\nof ALMA and the Special Envoy for Malaria, UNICEF \r\nand the World Bank for their efforts in helping member \r\nStates accelerate the procurement process. We implore \r\nthem to continue their efforts.\r\nMr. Haase (Australia): Thank you, Sir, for presiding \r\nover this joint debate. I also thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his reports (A/67/204 and A/67/205).\r\nIt is appropriate, as we mark Africa Week and the \r\nInternational Day for the Eradication of Poverty, and \r\nas we enter the second decade of the New Partnership \r\nfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD), that we recall \r\nNEPAD’s impressive achievements in promoting \r\ndevelopment and growth in Africa. It is also a time \r\nto consider how much work remains to be done to \r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \r\nin many countries, an issue on which the Australian \r\nPrime Minister, as co-Chair of the Secretary-General’s \r\nMDG Advocacy Group, is highly focused. As we know, \r\nsecurity and development are inextricably linked, and it \r\nis essential that, as we look to formulate the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda, we keep the lessons and needs of \r\ndevelopment in Africa firmly in focus.\r\nAustralia is highly optimistic about Africa. We \r\nrecognize its growing role and leadership. It is a credit \r\nto the leaders and people of Africa that 11 of the world’s \r\nfastest-growing economies are African. Australia is a \r\ngrowing partner for Africa. Our development assistance \r\nhas tripled since 2007 and continues to increase. This \r\ndevelopment cooperation is focused on supporting \r\nAfrican priorities, including the priorities expressed \r\nthrough NEPAD.\r\nAustralia seeks to make a practical and focused \r\ncontribution in areas where we have expertise and \r\nexperience: agriculture and food security, maternal and \r\nchild health, water and sanitation, mining governance \r\nand human resource capacity-building. As a growing \r\ndonor, we support the establishment of the NEPAD \r\nPlanning and Coordination Agency and its integration \r\ninto the processes and structures of the African Union. \r\nNEPAD assists us to set priorities and coordinate \r\nwith other initiatives in Africa at the national and \r\nregional levels. NEPAD’s Comprehensive Africa \r\nAgriculture Development Programme, for example, \r\nhas helped Australia focus our food security assistance, \r\ncoordinating with others and avoiding duplication.\r\nThe droughts in the Horn of Africa and the Sahel \r\nhave devastating impacts. We encourage NEPAD to \r\nwork with African Governments and the international \r\ncommunity to develop new strategies to respond to the \r\nimpact of climate change on food production and to \r\ncontinue to build long-term resilience to crises. Overall, \r\nAustralia has pledged $150 million to improve food \r\nsecurity in Africa, including through the Australian \r\nInternational Food Security Centre, which is set to \r\nopen an office in Nairobi.\r\nMr. Tanin (Afghanistan), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair.\r\nAustralia understands the blessings and curses \r\nof natural resource endowment. We are seeking to \r\nshare the lessons we have learned, through Australia’s \r\n$127 million Mining for Development initiative, which \r\nis helping African countries to maximize the benefits \r\nand opportunities of their mining sectors. Australia is \r\nalso working with the African Union and the Economic \r\nCommission for Africa to promote the Africa Mining \r\nVision 2050 and to assist in the establishment of the \r\nAfrican mining development centre.\r\n8 12 55213\r\nA/67/PV.25\r\ncivil society, efforts where partnerships are key. The \r\nAssembly may rest assured of Australia’s strong \r\npartnership as we work collectively towards these goals.\r\nMr. Tommo Monthe (Cameroon): I have the \r\npleasure to deliver, on behalf of the African Group, this \r\nstatement on three items of paramount importance to \r\nour continent’s quest for peace and development.\r\nThis important debate coincides with the \r\nInternational Day for the Eradication of Poverty. It \r\nshould therefore serve as a stark reminder to all of us \r\nthat, despite the progress made in lifting millions out of \r\npoverty around the world, too many of our fellow human \r\nbeings remain trapped in conditions of abject poverty. \r\nTherefore, we need to intensify our efforts for the full \r\nimplementation of the United Nations commitments \r\nto Africa with regard to the Millennium Development \r\nGoals, the 2005 World Summit Outcome (resolution \r\n60/1), the 2008 Doha Declaration on Financing for \r\nDevelopment (resolution 63/239, annex), the 2008 \r\npolitical declaration on Africa’s development needs \r\n(resolution 63/1), the Outcome of the 2009 Conference \r\non the World Financial and Economic Crisis and its \r\nImpact on Development (resolution 63/303, annex), \r\nthe Istanbul Declaration adopted at the Fourth United \r\nNations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, \r\nheld in 2011, and, last but not least, the implementation \r\nof the outcome document (resolution 66/288, annex) \r\nof the 2012 Conference on Sustainable Development \r\n(Rio+20).\r\nThe African Group expresses its appreciation \r\nto the Secretary-General for the substantive reports \r\nunder consideration today: “New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development: tenth consolidated progress \r\nreport on implementation and international support” \r\n(A/67/204) and “Causes of conflict and the promotion \r\nof durable peace and sustainable development in \r\nAfrica” (A/67/205). Those reports reflect the increasing \r\nefforts of the United Nations system in support to \r\nthe African Union, including through the NEPAD \r\nAgency, the regional economic communities, the \r\nEconomic Commission for Africa and other regional \r\nand subregional actors in the field, coordinated and \r\nsupported by the Special Adviser to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on Africa and by his Office. However, the \r\nAfrican Group would be keen to see some improvement \r\nin the reports’ contents. Indeed, the reports submitted \r\nto the Assembly have been too descriptive thus far. \r\nConsequently, the Group encourages the Secretariat to \r\nexplore ways to present more analytical and evaluative \r\nFurther enhancing Africa’s development outlook \r\nrequires stronger partnership from the international \r\ncommunity. We international partners need to do what \r\nwe say. We are therefore pleased with the establishment \r\nof a monitoring mechanism to review commitments \r\nmade towards Africa’s development.\r\nAgricultural trade liberalization, combined with \r\neffective aid for trade, will assist Africa to trade its \r\nway out of poverty. Australia is concerned with the \r\nstalling of the Doha Round and will continue to press \r\nrobustly for an ambitious, comprehensive outcome that \r\nliberalizes agricultural trade. NEPAD can continue to \r\nplay a useful role in supporting improved intraregional \r\ntrade, which remains too low. We also fully support \r\nNEPAD playing an enhanced role in undertaking \r\nappropriate reforms to attract private-sector investment \r\nand partnerships in order to support much-needed \r\ninfrastructure development.\r\nI turn now to the issue of malaria. Despite recent \r\nprogress, there are still more than 200 million cases \r\nof malaria globally each year. Africa is hardest hit. \r\nAustralia has been working to help African nations \r\nbattle malaria, including through our long-standing \r\nsupport for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis \r\nand Malaria, to which Australia has contributed \r\n$250 million since 2004 and committed another \r\n$170 million by 2015. Malaria is also undermining \r\ndevelopment and causing human suffering in the \r\nAsia-Pacific region, where there are approximately \r\n30 million cases each year, and where we are working, \r\nthrough the Asia-Pacific Malaria Elimination Network, \r\nto address this scourge.\r\nThe gains the global community has made in terms \r\nof malaria are at risk. Resistance to the drugs used to \r\ntreat malaria is emerging in the Mekong region of South-\r\nEast Asia. These drugs are our last line of defence. If \r\nwe cannot work together quickly to contain resistance, \r\nthere is a real threat that malaria will spread beyond \r\nAsia, with many more thousands of lives lost. It is in \r\nall of our interests to contain drug resistance. This is \r\nthe focus of an international conference to be held later \r\nthis month in Sydney, hosted by Australia’s Foreign \r\nMinister and the Special Envoy of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for Malaria.\r\nRealizing Africa’s development potential and \r\ncombating malaria require increased collective efforts \r\nthat draw on the strengths of national Governments, \r\nregional organizations such as the African Union, \r\ninternational organizations, the private sector and \r\n12 55213 9\r\nA/67/PV.25\r\nclimate change and in many other aspects that are \r\ndelaying the meeting of Africa’s developmental needs.\r\nLooking to the future, the African Group attaches \r\ngreat importance to the implementation of the outcome \r\ndocument of Rio+20. The sustainable development goals \r\nshould duly respect the African priorities as reflected \r\nin NEPAD and supplemented by the African consensus \r\nthat emerged at summit level before the Conference. \r\nThe means of implementation to be negotiated should \r\nensure that the financial means necessary to achieve \r\nsustainable development, including the sustainable \r\ndevelopment goals, will be provided to Africa as a \r\npriority.\r\nThe African Group also stresses the urgent need \r\nto activate the monitoring mechanism that the General \r\nAssembly established by resolution 66/293 to ensure \r\nmutual accountability and partnership, focusing on \r\nthe follow-up of the implementation of commitments \r\nmade by the African nations and by our partners in \r\ndevelopment. It would require extensive efforts to \r\ncollect the data that is required to ensure accuracy. \r\nAs the Office of the Special Adviser is mandated with \r\nthat task, the African Group trusts that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, in full compliance with the resolution, will \r\nmake available the necessary resources to ensure the \r\nsuccess of the mechanism from within the Organization’s \r\nexisting resources, and not from the existing limited \r\nresources of the Office of the Special Adviser.\r\nAnother important issue that requires greater \r\nattention is the preparatory process for the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda. The African Group believes that \r\nthat process should be built around the successes and \r\nfailures of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), \r\nin a manner that would not allow us to lose sight of the \r\nunfulfilled commitments to Africa in the achievement \r\nof the MDGs. The preparatory process in New York \r\nshould be streamlined with the preparatory process at \r\nthe regional level, so that the post-2015 developmental \r\nagenda becomes peoples-centred, thus ensuring its \r\nsuccess.\r\nIn all of those future processes, the African Group \r\nbelieves that African States and the Office of the Special \r\nAdviser should be appropriately involved, so as to \r\nensure synergy between the regional and international \r\ndimensions. That would also require that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral enhance that Office’s ability to undertake that \r\nresponsibility, including through additional financial \r\nmeans.\r\nreports in the future, in the light of predetermined goals \r\nand objectives.\r\nThe African Group also expresses its sincere \r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for his wise \r\ndecision to implement the relevant General Assembly \r\nresolutions by maintaining the Office of the Special \r\nAdviser on Africa as a separate and independent office \r\nwithin the Secretariat, through the appointment of an \r\nexperienced Under-Secretary-General as his Special \r\nAdviser on Africa. That decision, no doubt, will enhance \r\nthe interaction between the African Group and the \r\nUnited Nations system through the Special Adviser and \r\nhis Office to ensure intensified support of the United \r\nNations system to African efforts in development and \r\npeace and security. The African Group expects that the \r\ndecision will be the first step in a series of decisions to \r\nenhance the ability of Office of the Special Adviser on \r\nAfrica to undertake its important mandate effectively.\r\nAs NEPAD enters its second decade of \r\nimplementation, prospects for Africa’s development \r\nappear even brighter. With great political will, the \r\nAfrican nations can make sizeable gains in various \r\nNEPAD priority sectors. Progress made by the African \r\ncountries in agriculture, infrastructure, information and \r\ncommunication technology and governance has shown \r\nthat Africa is meeting the challenge and fulfilling its \r\nshare of the bargain. \r\nHowever, owing to resource gaps and capacity \r\nconstraints, international support should be intensified \r\nto complement Africa’s own efforts. The African Group \r\nis confident that despite the economic and financial \r\ncrisis affecting all of us, our partners in development \r\nwill push further in implementing their part of the \r\npartnership.\r\nIn that vein, the African Group stresses that \r\nintensified efforts are much needed to achieve the \r\nprogress required in many areas: first, in official \r\ndevelopment assistance, particularly as committed \r\nto in the 2005 summit of the Group of Eight (G-8) \r\nin Gleneagles; secondly, in agriculture and food \r\nsecurity, particularly as committed to at the G-8 \r\nSummits in L’Aquila and in Maryland; thirdly, in \r\nvigorously addressing Africa’s debt problems through \r\nthe Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative \r\nand the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative; fourthly, \r\nin effectively addressing the decline in foreign direct \r\ninvestment inflows to Africa; and fifthly, in pushing \r\nforward on issues of trade barriers, food security and \r\n10 12 55213\r\nA/67/PV.25\r\nOn the causes of conflict and the promotion of \r\ndurable peace in Africa, it must be noted that Africa \r\nhas seen many positive steps towards consolidating \r\ndemocracy. Twenty-three African countries will have \r\nheld democratic elections between August 2011 and \r\nMarch 2013. In addition, the progress made in the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Liberia and Sierra \r\nLeone towards solidifying democratic governance \r\nis a source of pride. Most significantly this year, the \r\nconstitutional referendum and elections in Somalia \r\nwere successfully concluded and agreements were \r\nreached between the Sudan and South Sudan on many \r\nof the pending issues.\r\nHowever, progress on elections and democracy has \r\nnot been without challenges. Democratic processes in \r\nMali and Guinea-Bissau were stalled after coups d’état \r\nin March and April, respectively. We highly appreciate \r\nthe support of the Secretary-General and the Security \r\nCouncil for the efforts of the African Union, the \r\nEconomic Community of West African States and other \r\nparties involved in the search for a solution. In that \r\ncontext, the African Group welcomes the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s initiative to convene four high-level meetings \r\non the situation in the Sahel region, Somalia, the Sudan \r\nand the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\r\nDespite that remarkable progress, significant \r\nefforts are needed to eradicate factors of instability \r\nand that cause the weakening of States, such as the \r\nproliferation of small arms and light weapons and the \r\nincreasing drug trafficking — two phenomena that feed \r\nterrorism, criminality and corruption.\r\nToday, Africa has both opportunities and \r\nchallenges. Let us capitalize on the opportunities and \r\nface the challenges. The African Group is committed to \r\ndoing so and counts on the support of the international \r\ncommunity for a better future for Africa and its peoples.\r\nI wish to say a few words in my capacity as \r\nrepresentative of Cameroon.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nFirst, I thank the Secretary-General for the reports \r\nunder consideration today and in particular for the \r\nprogress achieved. \r\nIn line with previous sessions, I will endeavour to \r\nprovide a somewhat simple view that is also consistent \r\nwith what I believe has happened over the past year. \r\nI will limit myself to a few salient points in order to \r\nplace them in relation to the causes of conflict and the \r\npromotion of durable peace and development in Africa.\r\nWe welcome the measures undertaken by the \r\nregional and international organizations and the \r\nUnited Nations system, as well as the African \r\ncountries themselves, in the sectors identified, namely, \r\ninfrastructure, agriculture and food security, health, \r\neducation, tourism, information and communications \r\ntechnology, science and technology. While progress \r\nhas been achieved in those sectors, we note with the \r\nSecretary-General that in spite of the increase in the \r\nofficial development assistance provided to Africa \r\nsince 2004, that influx is well below pledges.\r\nWith regard to debt in particular, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report does indeed point out that the debt \r\nburden of African countries has been considerably \r\nreduced through initiatives implemented at the \r\nglobal and bilateral levels. But at the same time, debt \r\nsustainability came under pressure as a result of the \r\nglobal financial and economic crisis, with the drop in \r\nforeign direct investment inflows to Africa.\r\nThat picture is in complete contrast with the \r\nassessment of NEPAD. It ref lects the reality of a \r\ndifficult economic situation that lends itself to the \r\ndevelopment of factors favourable to the emergence of \r\nconflicts. As stated so well in the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport,\r\n“the ... exclusion of significant portions of society \r\nfrom institutions of political governance and from \r\naccess to ... economic assets and social services \r\nis not only one of the main triggers of conflict, \r\nbut it also makes it difficult to attain sustainable \r\ndevelopment” (A/67/205, para. 3). \r\nThat assertion by the Secretary-General makes obvious \r\nthe issue of exclusion — or inclusion, according to the \r\nangle from which we tackle the problem. \r\nIn the Secretary-General’s report two specific items \r\nattracted our attention: sustained economic growth \r\nand sustainable development, and the management of \r\ndiversity. Both have been taken as means of preventing \r\nconflicts and promoting durable peace. With regard to \r\neconomic policies and access to resources, Cameroon \r\nlaunched a few years ago a policy called Grand \r\nAchievements, which concerns infrastructure, growth \r\nand jobs. In addition to the industrial jobs created \r\nthrough that enormous programme, young people have \r\nalso benefited from recruitment for 25,000 posts in the \r\ncivil service.\r\n12 55213 11\r\nA/67/PV.25\r\nand Coordinating Agency for its continued efforts in \r\ngenerating fresh momentum and new dynamism in the \r\nimplementation of the NEPAD priority activities.\r\nWith accelerated growth over the last decade, \r\nimprovement in governance, the spectre of conflicts \r\nreceding and improvement in leadership, it is clear that \r\nAfrica is at a critical turning point. Steady progress \r\nis also recorded in malaria control and prevention \r\nmechanisms, with many households sleeping under \r\ntreated mosquito bed nets. Some African heads of \r\nState, including the President of Sierra Leone, made a \r\nfurther commitment to reach the Secretary-General’s \r\ngoal of ensuring universal access to malaria control \r\ninterventions and launched the African Leaders Malaria \r\nAlliance with the goal of ending preventable malaria \r\ndeaths by 2015.\r\nHowever, we note that the progress made so \r\nfar continues to have less impact in the face of the \r\ndeepening effects of an unprecedented economic and \r\nfinancial crisis and the effects of climate change — a \r\ncrisis that undoubtedly has had a much graver impact on \r\nthe developing world, in particular the least developed \r\ncountries, most of which are in Africa.\r\nThe integration of NEPAD into the African Union \r\nprovides a window for strategic partnership to explore \r\nareas of cooperation in order to address such global \r\nchallenges as the debt issue, climate change, trade and \r\nregional integration, and sustainable development.\r\nWe are heartened by the ongoing implementation \r\nof NEPAD projects ranging from the Comprehensive \r\nAfrica Agriculture Development Programme, \r\ninfrastructure, environment, gender mainstreaming \r\nand education to training in information and \r\ncommunications technologies.\r\nAt the level of governance, advances in the \r\nimplementation of the African Peer Review Mechanism \r\ndemonstrate Africa’s resolve and commitment to \r\npromoting democracy, good governance, peace and \r\nstability on the continent. We are also encouraged by \r\nthe increase in the number of countries that have joined \r\nthe Peer Review Mechanism, and we commend its \r\nconsolidation as the African Union f lagship programme \r\non governance.\r\nIn order to build on these gains and make further \r\nstrides in development, we should continue to \r\nincrease domestic savings and lessen dependence on \r\nforeign aid. We should continue to invest further in \r\nscience, technology and innovation in order to take \r\nI conclude by saying that from an economic \r\nstandpoint, my country is doing everything it can to \r\npromote citizen participation in the national political \r\nlife without distinction as to ethnic or religious \r\nbackground. At the level of local groups, the current \r\ndecentralization programme also promotes the broadest \r\ncitizen participation possible. \r\nThose are the efforts undertaken by my country \r\nto tackle the root causes of conflicts and to promote \r\nsustainable peace and development in Cameroon, in our \r\nsubregion and in Africa.\r\nMrs. Jusu (Sierra Leone): At the outset, allow me \r\nto compliment the Secretary-General for his instructive \r\nand forward-looking reports on the New Partnership \r\nfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD) and progress on \r\nimplementation and international support (A/67/204) \r\nand on causes of conflict and the promotion of durable \r\npeace and sustainable development in Africa (A/67/205). \r\nMy delegation also expresses its appreciation of \r\nMr. Maged Abdelaziz, Under-Secretary-General and \r\nSpecial Adviser on Africa, and his dedicated team for \r\ntheir advisory and advocacy work in promoting Africa’s \r\ndevelopment agenda. Let me also thank Mr. Ibrahim \r\nAssane Mayaki, Chief Executive Officer of the NEPAD \r\nPlanning and Coordinating Agency, for his leadership, \r\ndrive and innovative approach in ensuring progress in \r\nthe implementation of the key priorities of NEPAD.\r\nSierra Leone attaches great importance to NEPAD, \r\nas it is a collective vision and strategic socioeconomic \r\ndevelopment framework aimed at generating broad-\r\nbased, sustained and equitable economic growth that \r\nallows Africa to reduce poverty and to better integrate \r\ninto the global economy. It is in that context that the \r\nfourteenth ordinary session of the Assembly of the \r\nAfrican Union integrated NEPAD into the structures \r\nand processes of the African Union. That decision \r\nadded further impetus to the role of NEPAD as the \r\ncontinent’s f lagship development programme.\r\nTo that end, African countries, with the support \r\nof the international community, have continued to \r\ntake policy actions to implement the NEPAD sectoral \r\npriorities and enhance their prospects of attaining the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. In that regard, we \r\ntake note of the positive indication in the report that, \r\ndespite the global economic slowdown and the lingering \r\nimpact of the global financial and economic crisis, \r\nprogress has been achieved in the implementation of \r\nNEPAD. We therefore commend the NEPAD Planning \r\n12 12 55213\r\nA/67/PV.25\r\nAfrica’s share of the world agricultural market \r\ncontinues to be extremely low and has decreased in \r\nrecent years. We therefore urge development partners \r\nto take bold steps to conclude trade negotiations \r\nwith development dimensions, which would reduce \r\ntrade-distorting subsidies for agricultural products, \r\nincrease access to markets for African farmers and \r\nphase out barriers to trade at the national and global \r\nlevels.\r\nIn keeping with internationally agreed \r\ndevelopment outcome documents — including \r\nthose on the MDGs (resolution 55/2), the United \r\nNations Conference on Sustainable Development \r\n(resolution 66/288, annex) and the Istanbul Programme \r\nof Action (A/CONF.219/3/Rev.1) — we also urge \r\ndevelopment partners to meet their commitments \r\nand deliver on the pledges made in Busan at the \r\nHigh-level Forum on Aid Effectiveness to achieve an \r\nofficial development assistance target of 0.7 per cent \r\nand 0.15 per cent for developing and least developed \r\ncountries, respectively.\r\nIn 2002, Sierra Leone emerged from a decade-long \r\ncivil conflict to become a country that is cited as a \r\nsuccess story for United Nations peacebuilding and \r\npeace consolidation efforts. Despite the major challenges \r\nwe still face, Sierra Leone is seen as a good example \r\nof how a country can move from conflict to a stable \r\nand peaceful democracy. Today, with support from our \r\ndevelopment partners, we have introduced policies to \r\naccelerate our interventions in the productive sectors, \r\nexpand our infrastructure, protect the environment and \r\nimprove social safety nets.\r\nIn order to position our development within \r\na focused, coherent and prioritized framework, \r\nin 2008 we developed the Agenda for Change, a \r\nfive-year development framework that is our second-\r\ngeneration poverty reduction strategy paper, with \r\nwhich the Peacebuilding Commission, the United \r\nNations country team and other development partners \r\nhave realigned their strategies. This development \r\nand peacebuilding framework sets clear priorities \r\nthat target the drivers of growth and the necessary \r\nconditions for sustainable development in key areas \r\nsuch as energy, agriculture, transport, health, youth \r\nemployment, gender and education. The strategies for \r\ndeveloping these priorities include, among other things, \r\nimproving the capacity of public services, enhancing \r\npublic- and private-sector partnerships and enhancing \r\ngood governance at all levels, including in our domestic \r\nfull advantage of progress in those areas, including \r\nin increasing value addition in natural resources, \r\njob creation, investment in infrastructure and the \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs). In that regard, foreign direct investment \r\naimed at creating public-private partnerships and a \r\nvibrant private sector continues to be a viable option \r\nin addressing unemployment and underemployment, as \r\nwell as in promoting socioeconomic development. \r\nMy delegation also calls on NEPAD to focus on \r\nimproving Africa’s global standing and enhancing \r\nlinkages with the continent’s regional economic \r\ncommunities.\r\nThere is increasing awareness that responsibility \r\nfor peace and security in Africa, including the capacity \r\nto address the root causes of conflict and to resolve \r\nconflicts in a peaceful manner, lies primarily with \r\nAfrican countries themselves. The African Union \r\nand the subregional organizations have undertaken to \r\nstrengthen their capacity in conflict prevention and \r\nresolution. While those efforts are ongoing, we are \r\nalso witnessing a new wave of challenges, including \r\ntransnational organized crime, the proliferation of small \r\narms and light weapons, terrorism, piracy, issues of \r\ngovernance and human rights and threats to democracy, \r\ndrought, famine and corruption. Furthermore, while \r\nreducing extreme poverty and hunger remains our main \r\ndevelopment challenge, most African countries are also \r\ngrappling with the problems of youth unemployment, \r\nclimate change and inadequate productive capacity. \r\nThose challenges continue to frustrate their efforts to \r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nTo ensure durable peace, it is vital to forge \r\ncoordinated partnerships aimed at strengthening \r\na country’s capacity to respond to the crises and \r\nsecurity threats associated with those challenges, \r\nparticularly in conflict and post-conflict countries. \r\nThere is a clear need to step up efforts to improve \r\nearly-warning systems for impending threats to peace \r\nand stability in Africa. In that context, my delegation \r\ncommends the 2010 comprehensive review (A/65/152) \r\nof the implementation of the 1998 recommendations \r\nof the Secretary-General on the causes of conflict \r\nand the promotion of durable peace and sustainable \r\ndevelopment in Africa (A/52/871), in the light of new \r\nand emerging issues affecting human security in \r\nAfrica. My delegation also notes the policy proposals \r\nand recommendations in the Secretary-General’s most \r\nrecent report, in document A/67/205.\r\n12 55213 13\r\nA/67/PV.25\r\nand the promotion of South-South and triangular \r\ncooperation are critical to achieving sustainable \r\ndevelopment. To achieve progress and to remain in \r\nline with country-specific priorities, there is a need \r\nfor technology transfer and greater investment in \r\ninfrastructure, agriculture and social facilities and \r\nservices. There is also a need for further incentives for \r\nforeign direct investment.\r\nWe are inspired by the Secretary-General’s \r\nSustainable Energy for All initiative and congratulate \r\nthe High-level Group for the work done and the financial \r\ncommitments secured. Increased private-sector \r\nparticipation in energy delivery is a prerequisite to the \r\nachievement of sustainable development. The private \r\nsector needs, therefore, to develop risk-mitigation tools \r\nand instruments that will encourage private capital to be \r\nallocated without sacrificing the need for efficiency and \r\nappropriate returns. The private sector must, in turn, \r\nlook at the long-term predictable income streams that \r\nthe energy sector offers and not ignore the stability that \r\nmost developing countries and emerging democracies \r\nnow enjoy. In that manner, they can price their risks \r\nreasonably. Energy remains an important engine of \r\ngrowth and development, a key to enhancing productive \r\ncapacity and a catalyst for job creation. In that regard, \r\nwe are committed to intensifying our cooperation in \r\nthe context of triangular and South-South cooperation \r\naimed at strengthening the productive capacity of \r\nvulnerable members of the global community, most of \r\nwhom reside in Africa.\r\nIn conclusion, allow me to reiterate Sierra Leone’s \r\ncommitment to furthering the objectives of NEPAD, \r\nthe promotion of good governance, durable peace and \r\nsustainable development on the continent.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nobserver of the European Union.\r\nMr. Beviglia Zampetti (European Union): I \r\nhave the honour to speak on behalf of the European \r\nUnion (EU) and its member States. The acceding \r\ncountry Croatia; the candidate countries the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Iceland \r\nand Serbia; the countries of the Stabilization and \r\nAssociation Process and potential candidates Albania \r\nand Bosnia and Herzegovina; as well as Ukraine, the \r\nRepublic of Moldova, Armenia and Georgia, align \r\nthemselves with this statement.\r\nAt the third Africa-European Union Summit held \r\nin November 2010, EU and African leaders renewed \r\nfinancial system. As a result, we have increased grid-\r\ndistributed electricity some tenfold and are on course \r\nto develop hydropower and biomass sources as the \r\ncore of our energy mix. Agricultural productivity has \r\nincreased, with improvements in food sufficiency, \r\nsecurity and nutrition. Indeed, Sierra Leone’s efforts \r\nhave been recognized with the President, Ernest Bai \r\nKoroma, and the Minister of Agriculture being named \r\nthe Comprehensive African Agricultural Development \r\nProgramme Champions of Africa.\r\nOur free health-care programme for lactating and \r\npregnant women and children under 5 years of age has \r\nsignificantly reduced  — by half — infant and maternal \r\nmortality in a little over a year, since its launch. Having \r\nstarted by signing gender acts into law, we have also \r\njust recently passed a sexual offences act to protect \r\nwomen against the most widespread abuse and violation \r\nof rights in our country. We have also introduced \r\nfree malaria treatment for all age groups in all public \r\nhealth facilities when the disease is confirmed by the \r\nuse of rapid diagnostic tests. Malaria control has seen \r\nsignificant progress, especially in the area of prevention \r\nthrough the use of long-lasting insecticide-treated nets.\r\nIn education, primary, secondary and tertiary \r\nenrolment has risen significantly, and the quality of \r\nthe results of our candidates in external exams is also \r\nseriously improving. We have reduced barriers to doing \r\nbusiness. We launched the largest road-construction \r\nprogramme in the history of Sierra Leone, privatized our \r\nseaport and substantially upgraded our airport. Those \r\nachievements and the highly favourable private-sector \r\ninvestment incentives have resulted in substantially \r\nincreased foreign direct investments over the years.\r\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, Sierra Leone \r\ncontinues to face multiple challenges in building \r\ncapacities in the public and private sectors, addressing \r\nunemployment among youth, improving health care, \r\nreducing food insecurity and poverty, increasing \r\ninvestment in education, providing access to safe \r\ndrinking water for everyone, meeting the increasing \r\ndemand for sustained information and communications \r\ntechnologies, and bringing sustainable energy to all. \r\nIn the current global economic climate, Sierra Leone, \r\nlike many other countries, continues to be affected \r\nin its quest to attract substantial donor support for its \r\ndevelopment projects.\r\nTo achieve our common vision, bold actions are \r\nrequired from all of us. In particular, international \r\nsupport from traditional and non-traditional donors \r\n14 12 55213\r\nA/67/PV.25\r\nAfrica continues to face a huge burden of potentially \r\npreventable and treatable diseases, which cause death \r\nand untold suffering while simultaneously blocking \r\neconomic development and damaging the continent’s \r\nsocial fabric. We know that malaria — alongside other \r\ndiseases such as HIV/AIDS — inflicts a heavy burden \r\non Africa, particularly on women, children and the \r\nmost vulnerable. Significant progress has been made \r\nin the global fight against that disease in recent years, \r\nincluding in Africa. Experience has shown how long-\r\nlasting insecticidal mosquito nets, rapid diagnostic \r\ntesting, effective artemisinin-based combination \r\ntreatment and indoor spraying with insecticides can \r\nachieve impressive results when those actions are \r\nunderpinned by strong and effective health systems. \r\nBut progress will be rapidly reversed if we relax our \r\njoint efforts. There is still much to do in order to drive \r\ndown even further the number of cases and deaths due \r\nto malaria. That cannot be achieved without sustained \r\ninvestment and political will.\r\nAs the world’s largest donor, both in general \r\nand in the health sector in particular, the EU and its \r\nmember States will continue to lead the international \r\ncommunity’s collective efforts to target malaria, \r\nalways seeking the most efficient modes of delivery \r\nand working through national Governments, the Global \r\nFund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the \r\nUnited Nations system and other relevant organizations \r\nand mechanisms, including non-governmental \r\norganizations and the Roll Back Malaria Partnership.\r\nCombating diseases such as malaria, through \r\nstrengthened national health systems, is, in our view, \r\none of the most effective ways to alleviate poverty and \r\npromote equitable and sustainable economic growth. \r\nWe need to further invest in workers in the health \r\nprofessions and build capacity in order to ensure \r\nequitable access to prevention, diagnosis, treatment and \r\ncare, which will help us accelerate progress towards \r\nthe achievement of MDG 4 on child health, MDG 5 on \r\nmaternal health and MDG 6 on combating H1V/AIDS, \r\nmalaria and other diseases. The EU continues to work \r\nclosely with African Governments to enable them to \r\nfulfil their commitment to allocate 15 per cent of their \r\nState budgets to health, in line with the 2001 Abuja \r\nDeclaration.\r\nLet me conclude by emphasizing that the EU and \r\nits member States remain committed to supporting \r\nAfrica and Africans in their quest for peace, democratic \r\ngovernance, human rights and sustainable development.\r\ntheir commitment to working together to tackle \r\nglobal challenges, namely, climate change, conflict \r\nprevention and good governance, inter alia, and to \r\naddress energy, infrastructure, food security and the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) as a priority. \r\nThey emphasized the need to encourage investment, \r\ngrowth and employment, in particular for youth. The \r\nEU recognizes the essential role played by the African \r\nUnion and its New Partnership for Africa’s Development \r\n(NEPAD) programme in the definition of continental \r\npolicy frameworks and programmes, respecting in \r\nfull the notions of subsidiarity and ownership, and the \r\nprogramme’s role as a monitor of commitments towards \r\nAfrican development needs.\r\nSupport from the international community must \r\nbe aimed at assisting African institutions and African \r\ncountries to develop their own capacities to promote \r\ncontinental, regional and national projects and to \r\nmobilize the necessary resources for the priorities \r\nidentified. Our aim is to support Africa’s political \r\nand economic integration through enhanced trade, \r\na strengthened political partnership and increased \r\ncooperation in promising new areas, as well as to foster \r\ninstitutional capacity-building at the national, regional \r\nand continental levels.\r\nWe view the Joint Africa-EU Strategy adopted \r\nat the 2007 Summit as a strategic framework for our \r\nsteadily expanding cooperation and dialogue with \r\nAfrica. The partnership is guided by the fundamental \r\nprinciples of the unity of Africa, the interdependence \r\nbetween Africa and Europe, shared values and interests, \r\nand joint ownership and responsibilities. Those are also \r\ncore principles of the African Union and NEPAD. \r\nWe welcome the progress made by the African \r\nUnion in addressing the many security challenges in \r\nthe continent, both through African-led peace-support \r\noperations and the establishment of its Peace and \r\nSecurity Architecture. The EU has supported those \r\nprocesses with more than €1 billion since 2004. We \r\nlook forward to replicating that success story in \r\nother promising areas of common interest, such as \r\ngovernance, energy, climate and environment, science \r\nand technology, and information and communications \r\ntechnologies. We will therefore continue to follow \r\nclosely the African-owned policy frameworks and \r\nto support their implementation, particularly in the \r\ncontext of the Africa-EU Strategic Partnership.\r\n12 55213 15\r\nA/67/PV.25\r\nFurthermore, the ties of history and shared \r\nstruggles to which I referred give a special quality \r\nto the collaboration that is taking place between the \r\nCaribbean Community and Africa in the establishment \r\nat United Nations Headquarters of a permanent \r\nmemorial in honour of the victims of slavery and the \r\ntransatlantic slave trade, as an acknowledgement of a \r\ndark period in our common history.\r\nCARICOM delegations have paid special attention \r\nto the contents of the Secretary-General’s report in \r\ndocument A/67/204, which describes the current status \r\nof the effort to implement the New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD) and to incorporate \r\nits priorities into the regional development effort. \r\nOur States are encouraged by the story of promise \r\nand of hope that seems to emerge from the pages of \r\nthis document. We see at work a new dynamic that \r\nhas effectively replaced the traditional stereotypical \r\nimage of Africa as a continent of poverty and despair. \r\nCARICOM is proud to see the level of dedication and \r\ncommitment of African countries in the implementation \r\nof their development agenda through economic reform, \r\nenhancing governance and tackling conflicts. Our \r\nCommunity acknowledges and is heartened by Africa’s \r\nnotable strides in the achievement of political stability, \r\nthe promotion of economic and social development \r\nand the strengthening of mechanisms for inclusive \r\nparticipation.\r\nBut Africa’s story is not one of unqualified optimism. \r\nAchieving sustainable development and durable peace \r\nremains a challenge for the States of the region, many \r\nof which, despite significant efforts, are likely to fall \r\nshort of attaining the Millennium Development Goals \r\nby the 2015 deadline. More concerted action is needed \r\nto support the continent in its effort to cope with the \r\nmanifest challenges which persist. Greater attention is \r\nrequired to critical areas such as poverty eradication, \r\nfood security, health care, education, governance, \r\ninfrastructure, and information and communication \r\ntechnology in order to provide the economic, social and \r\nphysical security that impacts the most vulnerable and \r\nhighly dependent groups.\r\nWe recognize further the need to support the \r\nframework for peacebuilding and conflict prevention \r\nand resolution in Africa in order to create the enabling \r\nenvironment required for sustained, inclusive and \r\nequitable economic growth and for strengthening \r\ndemocracy. We believe that there must be continued \r\nefforts to buttress the African States in their resolve \r\nI would like to remind the Assembly that we are not \r\ndistributing copies of this statement, but it can be found \r\non the EU delegation website.\r\nMs. Bethel (Bahamas): In today’s debate on the \r\n“New Partnership for Africa’s Development: progress in \r\nimplementation and international support” and “Causes \r\nof conflict and the promotion of durable peace and \r\nsustainable development in Africa”, I am both pleased \r\nand honoured to continue the Caribbean Community’s \r\ntradition of expressed support for the African continent \r\nand its peoples in their effort as a collective to achieve \r\nsustainable peace, economic growth and social and \r\npolitical development.\r\nThe golden thread that joins the Caribbean to Africa \r\nis spun by ties of culture and history, shared struggles \r\nand common aspirations. It is partly in recognition \r\nof this connection that the Caribbean Community \r\n(CARICOM) was privileged to participate in, and \r\nbe represented at the level of Prime Minister at, the \r\nfirst Global African Diaspora Summit, held last May \r\nin Johannesburg, South Africa. The Summit, which \r\nwas held under the theme “Towards the realization of \r\na united, integrated Africa and its Diaspora”, speaks \r\nto the mutual affiliation between the citizens of the \r\ncontinent and the diaspora. At the forum, leaders \r\nand representatives of Africa, Latin American and \r\nCaribbean nations and other members of the diaspora \r\ngathered together to recognize and celebrate the \r\ndiverse and rich threads of the diaspora, which are \r\ncontinuously interwoven into the single tapestry that is \r\nAfrica. It is our hope as the Caribbean Community that \r\nthe momentum and expectations of the Summit will \r\ncontribute to the emergence of a stronger Africa in the \r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nThe Caribbean Community takes this opportunity to \r\nreaffirm its commitment to strengthening collaboration \r\nwith Africa aimed at achieving the enhanced levels \r\nof development envisioned by both our regions. In \r\npursuit of this goal, the Community’s membership has, \r\nat a policy level, embarked on practical engagement \r\nwith the African region. This has materialized in an \r\nincrease of diplomatic representation in African States \r\nsuch as South Africa and Nigeria and in technical \r\nand economic cooperation. It is also witnessed in \r\nthe manifest commitment to greater exchange and \r\npartnership among the secretariats of CARICOM, the \r\nAfrican Union and the South African Development \r\nCommunity.\r\n16 12 55213\r\nA/67/PV.25\r\nto build the capacity of the most vulnerable groups \r\nwith a view to enhancing human capital, reducing \r\nvulnerability, promoting equity and positively \r\ndealing with issues that engender conflict and stymie \r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe persistent global financial and economic \r\ncrisis has impacted on the level of international \r\ncooperation and the provision of aid to developing \r\nStates such as those in Africa. We nonetheless call on \r\nthe international community and financial institutions \r\nto stay the course and help strengthen the platform \r\nof engagement between Africa and her development \r\npartners. While we acknowledge the importance \r\nof multilateral mechanisms, we note that for these \r\npartnerships to succeed, the mutual interests and \r\nconcerns of all parties must be considered. At the same \r\ntime, as developing States we must be able to draw \r\non one another’s strengths. It is in this context that \r\nSouth-South cooperation and partnerships are also an \r\nessential part of the international response, offering \r\nviable opportunities to countries in their individual and \r\ncollective pursuit of sustained economic growth and \r\nsustainable development.\r\nWhere climate change is concerned, while at \r\none level the particular geography of Africa, on the \r\none hand, and of  the CARICOM area, on the other, \r\nmakes for differing manifestations of the effects of this \r\nphenomenon, there is another level at which we are \r\nboth victims. An urgent, comprehensive and effective \r\nglobal response is needed sooner rather than later. \r\nWe therefore call for a speedy delivery of fast-start \r\nfinancing and the fulfilment of pledged commitments.\r\nThe Caribbean Community remains encouraged \r\nby Africa’s vision and steadfastness in pursuing a \r\nstrategy for development, as manifested in NEPAD. \r\nWe commend Africa for their collective drive in \r\ncommanding ownership of their development process. \r\nOur region wishes to reaffirm our solidarity with \r\nthe peoples of Africa as they aspire to equitable \r\ndevelopment and durable peace. \r\nMr. Khalil (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): Egypt \r\nis speaking today as a country that was among the \r\nfounding members of the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD). My statement also reflects the \r\nposition of the Group of Arab States, which Egypt is \r\nhighly honoured to be chairing this month.\r\nAt the outset, I wish to express our \r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for his reports \r\n(A/67/204 and A/67/205). I also wish to associate \r\nmyself with the statement made earlier today by the \r\nrepresentative of Cameroon on behalf of the African \r\nGroup.\r\nThe adoption of NEPAD a decade ago underscored \r\nthe resolve of African countries to collectively address \r\nthe scourges of poverty and marginalization that our \r\ncontinent had suffered for long decades through a \r\ncommon vision based on African needs and priorities. \r\nAs one of the five founding countries of NEPAD, Egypt \r\nis proud of the progress made in the main areas of that \r\nAfrican initiative’s development agenda, in particular \r\nagriculture and food security, infrastructure and \r\nregional integration, human development, information \r\nand communications technology and the empowerment \r\nof women. Moreover, 31 countries have now joined \r\nthe African Peer Review Mechanism, which reflects \r\nAfrica’s commitment to promote good governance and \r\nrespect for human rights.\r\nOur meeting today takes place a few months after the \r\nUnited Nations Conference on Sustainable Development. \r\nIts outcome document (resolution 66/288, annex) \r\nreiterates the international community’s commitment to \r\nfully implementing NEPAD and to tackling the specific \r\ndevelopment challenges facing Africa, in particular by \r\nfulfilling all the commitments made in various forums \r\nto support Africa’s development. Egypt believes that, \r\nin order to consolidate the progress towards achieving \r\nNEPAD’s main objectives, African Governments \r\nmust step up their efforts to mobilize more domestic \r\nresources to finance development and to build on the \r\nsound macroeconomic policies that are enabling the \r\ncontinent’s countries to mitigate the adverse impacts of \r\nthe world financial crisis on development achievements \r\nmade before the crisis. African countries must also \r\nstrive to extend social partnerships to cover larger \r\nsegments of African populations.\r\nFurthermore, achieving NEPAD’s objectives \r\nundoubtedly requires the international community to \r\ncreate an environment conducive to supporting national \r\nefforts through fairer trade terms and by alleviating \r\nthe debt burden on African countries, including \r\nmiddle-income countries, by increasing foreign \r\ndirect investment inflows and by enhancing Africa’s \r\nparticipation in international economic decision-making \r\nprocesses. In that regard, we look forward to the Group \r\nof Eight (G-8) resuming its engagement with NEPAD. \r\nWe expect the incoming Chair of the Group, the United \r\nKingdom, to extend an invitation to the leaders of \r\n12 55213 17\r\nA/67/PV.25\r\nNEPAD’s founding countries to participate in a joint \r\nannual meeting on the margins of the G-8 summit, \r\nwhich was not convened this year. Egypt will continue \r\nto work with other African countries and with the Group \r\nof Arab States and development partners to strengthen \r\ninternational support to NEPAD, including through the \r\nUnited Nations and other international organizations \r\nand forums.\r\nNotwithstanding the significant progress made \r\nby Africa in the areas of peace and security, our \r\ncontinent still faces genuine challenges, including \r\nunconstitutional changes of Governments, terrorism \r\nand organized crime, as well as piracy and armed \r\nrobbery at sea. African countries also face challenges \r\nin promoting respect for human rights and in addressing \r\nsocial exclusion. The Group of Arab States, including \r\nEgypt, agrees with the Secretary-General that effective \r\nmanagement by African countries of the diversity that \r\ncharacterizes their communities is crucial to achieving \r\npolitical stability and sustainable development.\r\nThe convening of several summits and high-level \r\nmeetings on African issues on the margins of the high-\r\nlevel segment of the sixty-seventh General Assembly \r\nsession underscores the depth of the challenges faced \r\nby Africa in consolidating peace and stability. Those \r\nmeetings also reflect the importance that the United \r\nNations attaches to overcoming those challenges. \r\nEgypt and the Arab Group welcome the fact that the \r\nhigh-level meetings showed progress in resolving the \r\noutstanding issues between the Sudan and South Sudan \r\nand towards enhancing peace and stability in Somalia. \r\nFurthermore, they demonstrate the international \r\ncommunity’s commitment to addressing the situation \r\nin the Sahel region, in eastern Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo and in the Great Lakes region.\r\nSuch meetings are a testimony to the growing \r\npartnership between the United Nations and the \r\nAfrican Union (AU) and subregional African \r\norganizations in addressing the challenges of peace and \r\nsecurity in Africa, in accordance with the provisions \r\nof Chapter VIII of the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nAs a part of its efforts to coordinate that partnership, \r\nEgypt will host the third High-level Retreat on the \r\nPromotion of Peace, Security and Stability in Africa \r\nduring the first week of November. The Retreat will \r\nbring together United Nations special representatives \r\nand African Union envoys to Africa. During our \r\npresidency of the AU Peace and Security Council \r\nlast month, Egypt organized a joint, ministerial-level \r\nmeeting of the Council and the Council of the League \r\nof Arab States in order to coordinate the positions of \r\nthe two organizations on peace and security issues of \r\ncommon interest.\r\nEgypt believes that the appointment of a \r\nSpecial Adviser to the Secretary-General on Africa \r\ndemonstrates the importance that the United Nations \r\nattaches to African issues. Egypt is proud that one \r\nof our eminent Egyptians has been appointed by the \r\nSecretary-General to occupy such an important position. \r\nWe congratulate Ambassador Maged Abdelaziz on his \r\nassumption of that post. We underscore the importance \r\nof allocating adequate resources to the Office of the \r\nSpecial Adviser on Africa so as to enable it to fulfil \r\nits mandate, including the continuing implementation \r\nof the monitoring mechanism to review commitments \r\nmade towards Africa’s development, established by \r\nresolution 66/293.\r\nThe international community has made significant \r\nprogress in eliminating malaria in developing countries, \r\nin particular in Africa. We have been able to eradicate \r\nthat disease in nearly half the countries in the world. \r\nThe international community must continue to provide \r\nits technical and financial support for anti-malaria \r\nprogrammes in African countries by improving access \r\nto prevention measures and proper treatment and by \r\nsupporting our efforts to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals by 2015, in particular Goal 6, on \r\ncombating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases.\r\nEgypt reaffirms the vital role of regional \r\nand subregional organizations and initiatives in \r\nstrengthening that work. We underscore the need for \r\ninternational support to ensure the success of such \r\nprojects, in particular the African Leaders Malaria \r\nAlliance. That initiative was established to support \r\nthe efforts of African Governments, but further \r\ninternational support is needed, particularly in the areas \r\nof prevention, access to medicines and the necessary \r\ndiagnostic techniques. We welcome the launching of \r\nthe African Union’s Roadmap for Shared Responsibility \r\nand Global Solidarity for AIDS, Tuberculosis and \r\nMalaria during the high-level segment of the General \r\nAssembly in September. The Roadmap reaffirms \r\nAfrica’s ownership of its efforts and initiatives to \r\novercome the challenges that it still faces in the health \r\ncare sector and with regard to the health of its people.\r\nThe success of our efforts to combat and eliminate \r\nmalaria is directly linked to resolving the trade-related \r\naspects of the intellectual property rights of existing \r\n18 12 55213\r\nA/67/PV.25\r\nThe world is now undergoing major upheavals, \r\nwhich have not spared Africa. Africa has been able \r\nto overcome the burdens of its history, and in spite \r\nof adversity and obstacles, it has for the past 20 years \r\nachieved significant progress. At least we now know \r\nthat the African continent has all of the assets needed \r\nto make progress, and NEPAD has prepared it for that \r\nchange.\r\nIn spite of the global economic slowdown, \r\nexacerbated by the negative impact of the debt crisis, \r\nespecially that caused by European sovereign debt, the \r\nstrategic framework offered by NEPAD has enabled \r\nAfrican countries to make encouraging progress \r\nin various areas of peace and security, sustainable \r\ndevelopment, new technologies of information and \r\ncommunications, and health and education. Most \r\nnotably, agriculture, considered to be the most important \r\nsubsector for ensuring rapid economic growth in the \r\nregion, has shown significant progress, thanks to the \r\ncomprehensive African agricultural development \r\nprogramme. It has also, in certain countries, improved \r\nthe prospects for attaining the Millennium Development \r\nGoals.\r\nThe continued commitment to working towards the \r\nimplementation of the sectoral priorities under NEPAD \r\nhas made it possible to achieve significant growth \r\nthrough regional and subregional initiatives, especially \r\nin infrastructure. With that in mind, the Republic of \r\nthe Congo has devoted itself resolutely to a programme \r\nof integrative projects in line with NEPAD priorities \r\nand has focused on those sectors that fuel development, \r\nnamely, energy and transport.\r\nThe only means of ensuring positive results and \r\nmaking sure that they have lasting effects is if we \r\npromote peace and security. Promoting peace and \r\nsecurity and reinforcing governance and institutions are \r\nsome of the priorities in NEPAD. Thirty-one States have \r\njoined the peer review mechanism and have established \r\nself-assessment rules for Africa for good governance \r\nthrough the concepts of democracy and political \r\ngovernance, of governance and economic management, \r\nand of socioeconomic development, which testifies to \r\ntheir commitment to good governance and democracy. \r\nAware of the implications of good governance for \r\ndevelopment, the Republic of the Congo has been \r\ninvolved in that self-assessment evaluation process \r\nsince its inception in 2003. Certainly major challenges \r\nremain, but the evolution towards good governance has \r\nmodern malaria medications and vaccines currently \r\navailable and those being developed. There is no doubt \r\nthat the international community has a responsibility \r\nto address such trade-related issues. Developed \r\ncountries should assume the financial burden to their \r\npharmaceutical companies of reduced intellectual \r\nproperty rights and at least subsidize the royalties \r\ncharged by their companies in connection  with the \r\nuse of medicines in order to ensure the effectiveness of \r\nefforts to eliminate malaria and to thwart the risk of its \r\ncontinued proliferation.\r\nFinally, I would like to assure the Assembly that \r\nEgypt will continue to work with Member States, as \r\nwell as with development partners and sisterly African \r\ncountries, to enhance international support to Africa \r\nand to reinstate the African priorities in the United \r\nNations development agenda now and in the future, as \r\nwell as in the context of the post-2015 programmes.\r\nMr. Balé (Congo) (spoke in French): I would like \r\nfirst to express my gratitude to Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon for his reports entitled “New Partnership \r\nfor African Development: tenth consolidated progress \r\nreport on implementation and international support” \r\n(A/67/204) and “Causes of conflict and the promotion of \r\ndurable peace and sustainable development in Africa” \r\n(A/67/205).\r\nBoth reports offer us very useful documentation \r\nthat sheds light on the constant support of the United \r\nNations to Africa and various pan-African institutions, \r\nas well as on the achievements on the part of \r\norganizations in the United Nations system with regard \r\nto the implementation of various decisions taken by \r\nthe General Assembly and other outcome documents \r\nof international conferences, as well as the priorities \r\ndecided through the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) and the action of African \r\npartnerships in the process.\r\nNEPAD, as is well known, has for a decade \r\nembodied the shared vision of development in the \r\nAfrican continent that serves as the foundation for \r\nthe promotion of a programme of regional political \r\nand economic integration. Based on that platform \r\nand the commitment of the African continent, the \r\nAfrican political leadership is working to overcome \r\nthe challenges that have inhibited the achievement of \r\npeace and security, regional integration, growth and \r\nsustainable development, the eradication of poverty, and \r\nthe integration of Africa in the process of globalization.\r\n12 55213 19\r\nA/67/PV.25\r\nspecific actions. At the same time, Africa must boost \r\nits capacity to persevere in the implementation of \r\nNEPAD in order to become a viable partner. That is a \r\ncommitment that has never been refuted by the African \r\nleadership.\r\nMs. Saban (United States of America): The \r\nUnited States welcomes the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral (A/67/204) on the New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD) and the report entitled \r\n“2001-2010: Decade to Roll Back Malaria in Developing \r\nCountries, Particularly in Africa” (A/66/169). We \r\nappreciate the opportunity to address them together.\r\nThe United States strongly supports Africa’s \r\nongoing efforts to generate broad-based, sustained \r\nand equitable economic growth, which will allow \r\nAfrican countries to reduce poverty and integrate into \r\nthe global economy. The United States has supported \r\nand will continue to support the New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development as the African States’ collective \r\nvision and strategic framework for socioeconomic \r\ndevelopment in Africa.\r\nNEPAD is bearing fruit. As the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report notes, there has been real progress \r\nby African States and their partners, as evidenced by \r\nincreasing economic growth, exports and foreign direct \r\ninvestment. According to World Bank data released \r\nearlier this month, sub-Saharan Africa is expected \r\nto grow at the rate of 4.8 per cent in 2012, broadly \r\nunchanged from the 4.9 per cent growth rate in 2011 \r\nand largely on track despite setbacks in other regions. \r\nAfrican exports rebounded well in the first quarter of \r\n2012, growing at an annual pace of 32 per cent, up from \r\nthe 11 per cent pace recorded in the last quarter of 2011. \r\nMoreover, a third of African economies will grow at or \r\nabove 6 per cent, a longer-term trend based on continued \r\nstrong investor interest in the region, with $31 billion \r\nin foreign direct investment inflows expected this year, \r\ndespite difficult global conditions.\r\nWe agree with the Secretary-General’s conclusion \r\nthat creating the conditions for sustained and inclusive \r\neconomic growth will permit African populations to \r\nbenefit more broadly from better incomes and living \r\nstandards. To that end, the United States supports \r\nNEPAD priorities for democratization, good governance \r\nand economic transparency, as well as its activities to \r\nenhance regional and national level infrastructure and \r\nfood security and nutrition. So much will depend upon \r\nactive public-private partnerships.\r\nnow become an irreversible process that deserves our \r\ncontinued support.\r\nMy delegation would also like to express our sincere \r\nappreciation for the continued support of the United \r\nNations and the international community for Africa \r\nand its relevant institutions in the areas of peace and \r\nsecurity. While endorsing the recommendations of the \r\nSecretary-General’s report on the causes of conflicts \r\nand the promotion of durable peace and sustainable \r\ndevelopment in Africa, my delegation would like to \r\nstress the need for a more integrated approach with \r\nregard to the issues of peace, security and development, \r\nwhile appealing for a more thorough consideration that \r\nwould seek other possible causes of conflict and crises \r\nbesides the poor management of diversity described in \r\nthe report.\r\nAt a time when our attention is turned to the \r\nelaboration of the post-2015 agenda and the sustainable \r\nMillennium Development Goals, we believe that it is \r\nwise to stress the need to see both processes reinforce \r\nand mutually complement each other in a coordinated \r\nand consistent manner, without abandoning the original \r\ndevelopment goals that we have not yet managed to \r\nachieve. It is also up to us to ensure that, in doing \r\nso, the goals that we establish reflect the priorities of \r\nNEPAD and Africa. We are certain that the future of \r\nAfrica means that African States must take control of \r\ntheir own development. There can be no doubt, on the \r\neve of the second decade of NEPAD, that Africa must \r\nconsolidate its leadership in the implementation of the \r\nnew agenda. There can be no other alternative. \r\nNevertheless, the profound changes we are \r\nobserving on the African continent cannot be ignored \r\nby our partners, which must accompany Africa in an \r\nequitable partnership, because NEPAD also symbolizes \r\na new kind of partnership that African countries have \r\nestablished with the rest of the world. The constraints \r\nwe are facing, individually and together, are multiple \r\nand quite complex. We are not always capable of \r\novercoming them individually. Now is the time to recall \r\nthe numerous unfulfilled promises and commitments \r\nthat have not yet been met by our development partners.\r\nI would like to conclude with the comment that \r\nwe all have implied today. There is every indication \r\nthat Africa has become a key player in the twenty-first \r\ncentury and can contribute to the globalization of our \r\nworld. The destiny of Africa is now linked to that of \r\nthe rest of the world. That means that other regions and \r\nthe entire international community must be involved in \r\n20 12 55213\r\nA/67/PV.25\r\nand international support”, adopted earlier this year. It \r\ndid so in support of the African-owned and African-\r\nled initiative, especially with respect to the important \r\nareas of agriculture, infrastructure, education, health, \r\nthe empowerment of women and the environment. We \r\nanticipate that a draft resolution will be submitted to the \r\nAssembly at the current session, and we look forward to \r\nkeeping the focus on Africa and its special needs.\r\nToday, the Assembly is also addressing the agenda \r\nitem entitled “2001-2010: Decade to Roll Back Malaria \r\nin Developing Countries, Particularly in Africa”. The \r\nUnited States is committed to addressing the prevention \r\nand treatment of malaria so as to improve the health \r\nand well-being of citizens living in malaria-endemic \r\nsettings, particularly young children and pregnant \r\nwomen, those most affected by that devastating disease. \r\nWe further recognize the negative impact of \r\nmalaria on household incomes and economic and \r\nsocial development in affected countries. Although \r\nthe Decade to Roll Back Malaria has concluded, the \r\ndisease persists. We must continue to support malaria \r\nprevention, treatment and control efforts.\r\nPresident Obama’s Malaria Initiative and our \r\ncontributions to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, \r\nTuberculosis and Malaria are part of the critical effort. \r\nThe goal of the Initiative is to achieve Africa-wide \r\nimpact by halving the burden of malaria in 70 per \r\ncent of the at-risk populations in sub-Saharan Africa. \r\nThrough the Initiative, which is a core component of \r\nPresident Obama’s Global Health Initiative, we are \r\nmeeting our commitment to substantially increase \r\nfunding to combat malaria to $5 billion over six years, \r\nstarting in 2009. Between 2009 and 2012, the United \r\nStates more than doubled its funding to expand malaria \r\nprevention and treatment, from $300 million to over \r\n$600 million. In 2011 alone, the President’s Malaria \r\nInitiative programming protected 58 million individuals \r\nin 19 focus countries in Africa and the Greater Mekong \r\nsubregion of South-East Asia.\r\nThe Global Fund is a key vehicle for sharing \r\nresponsibility and the world’s largest external source \r\nof finance for malaria-control programmes, providing \r\nthree fourths of all international financing. The United \r\nStates is the largest donor to the Global Fund, having \r\ncontributed more than $7.1 billion of the $19.1 billion \r\nin public and private funding received to date. The \r\nUnited States contribution to the Global Fund supports \r\nin-country capacity-building and health system \r\nstrengthening as well as direct service delivery. We \r\nIn response to Africa’s urgent food security and \r\nnutrition challenges, the United States Feed the Future \r\nInitiative has pledged over $3.5 billion over a three-year \r\nperiod to assist countries in southern, eastern, and \r\nwestern Africa to boost regional agricultural capacity, \r\nincrease private-sector investment in agriculture and \r\nintegrate national and regional markets to improve \r\nefficiency and the ability to respond to crises.\r\nAnother initiative, the New Alliance for Food \r\nSecurity and Nutrition, was launched by Group of Eight \r\n(G-8) and African leaders together at the May G-8 \r\nSummit. It is a shared commitment to achieve sustained \r\nand inclusive agricultural growth in Africa, with the \r\ngoal of raising 50 million people out of poverty over the \r\nnext 10 years. To that end, international and African \r\nprivate companies have pledged over $3.5 billion to \r\nagricultural and nutritional investments in Africa. More \r\ngenerally, we are encouraged by the efforts of African \r\nStates to create an enabling business environment that \r\nincludes infrastructure development. That is critical \r\nfor attracting domestic investment and encouraging a \r\nvibrant private sector. \r\nWe commend the NEPAD Planning and \r\nCoordinating Agency for its efforts, working with \r\nthe African Union, the United Nations, and the \r\nAfrican Development Bank, to drive and secure such \r\ninfrastructure improvements across the continent. Such \r\nactivities in support of public-private partnerships \r\ndemonstrate the recognition that official development \r\nassistance alone will not reap the desired results.\r\nPublic-private partnerships in other critical areas \r\nin Africa, such as education, are also moving forward \r\napace. The UNESCO Global Partnership for Girls’ \r\nand Women’s Education, which the United States \r\nco-launched, leverages public-private partnerships \r\nto address gender disparities and to provide quality \r\neducation for women and girls. It is showing success in \r\nEthiopia, Tanzania, Kenya, Lesotho and Senegal.\r\nWe agree with the Secretary-General’s conclusion \r\nthat, in a resource-constrained environment, the several \r\ndozen United Nations entities and affiliates must work \r\nalongside their African partners to make efficient \r\nand effective use of resources, in step with national \r\nblueprints and regional programmes and in line with \r\nNEPAD’s collective vision.\r\nThe United States joined the consensus on \r\nresolution 66/286, entitled “New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development: progress in implementation \r\n12 55213 21\r\nA/67/PV.25\r\nStrong, empowered women are a key component for \r\nthe success for both the Israeli and African societies. As \r\nI think about it, it occurs to me that, if the top echelons \r\nof Arab Governments were filled with empowered \r\nwomen with the same frequency, I am confident that \r\nwe would have a very different situation in the Middle \r\nEast today. \r\nThe New Partnership for Africa’s Development is \r\nan initiative led by Africans for Africa. In fact, Israel \r\nhas supported that approach for more than five decades. \r\nIn 1958, Golda Meir, then serving as Israel’s Foreign \r\nMinister, undertook a historic visit to the continent. At \r\nthe time, Israel was in its infancy. We were a developing \r\nnation facing a range of overwhelming challenges. Yet \r\nshe saw assistance to newly independent nations of \r\nAfrica as an imperative. She sent thousands of Israeli \r\nexperts of every sort — scientists, doctors, engineers, \r\nteachers and irrigation experts — to work hand in hand \r\nwith their African counterparts. \r\nSince that time, our development work in Africa has \r\nblossomed into an extensive programme of cooperation, \r\ncovering a wide range of sectors. In Ghana, Israeli \r\nhealth clinics have drastically improved maternal and \r\nbaby health. In Senegal, our drip irrigation system is \r\nincreasing crop yields and enriching the lives of farmers. \r\nIn Cameroon, Israeli doctors recently set up our eighth \r\nEye Camp, performing free life-changing surgery \r\non dozens of patients. In Kenya, Israel is partnering \r\nwith Germany to improve wastewater treatment and \r\nintroduce new technology into the tilapia fisheries of \r\nLake Victoria. Those efforts are also benefiting people \r\nin Tanzania and Uganda.\r\nThe medieval Jewish philosopher Maimonides \r\ntaught that we reach the highest level of righteousness \r\nwhen we give other people the means to sustain \r\nthemselves. That principle underlies Israel’s approach \r\nto development and our commitment to promoting \r\nentrepreneurship in all corners of the world. We \r\nbelieve that that is one of the greatest tools for global \r\ndevelopment. By unlocking minds, we can inspire \r\nchange. As President Kagame of Rwanda said, \r\nentrepreneurship is the surest way for a nation to meet \r\nits goals and develop prosperity for the greatest number \r\nof people. Building entrepreneurial cultures empowers \r\npeople with the skills and opportunities to solve \r\nproblems around them, unleashing waves of innovative \r\nideas and solutions.\r\nThe New Partnership for Africa’s Development \r\nis about supporting Africa as its people turn ideas \r\nencourage all donor and recipient nations to support \r\nglobal malaria-control efforts through appropriate \r\nfinancial contributions and stronger political \r\ncommitments.\r\nThe Assembly’s most recent malaria resolution, \r\n“Consolidating gains and accelerating efforts to \r\ncontrol and eliminate malaria in developing countries, \r\nparticularly in Africa, by 2015” (resolution 66/289), \r\nadopted by consensus in September, acknowledged \r\nthe progress made in parts of Africa in reversing the \r\nmalaria epidemic and the importance of strengthening \r\nhealth systems. It also recognized that increased global \r\nand national investments in malaria control have \r\nyielded significant results and that some countries were \r\nmoving towards malaria’s elimination. \r\nHowever, many countries still have high burdens \r\nof malaria, requiring a rapid increase in prevention \r\nand control efforts. Towards that goal, the resolution \r\ncalled on Member States, particularly malaria-\r\nendemic countries, to strengthen national policies and \r\noperational plans, with a view to scaling up efforts to \r\nachieve internationally agreed malaria targets for 2015. \r\nWe urge affected nations, especially those in Africa, \r\nto increase their own domestic spending on malaria \r\ncontrol as part of their overall plans to boost the share \r\nof their national budgets devoted to health.\r\nMr. Prosor (Israel): I speak to the Assembly today \r\nas someone who had the privilege of spending part \r\nof my childhood growing up in Africa, while Africa \r\nitself was growing up. My understanding of Africa is \r\nnot based on textbooks, or movies, or safaris. I speak \r\nfrom personal experience. As a young child living in \r\nwhat was then Tanganyika, I remember vividly the \r\nexcitement that went along with independence — and \r\nthe strong desire of the African people to take control \r\nof their destiny.\r\nAfrica and Israel share a deep connection — one \r\nthat dates back thousands of years. Both the Ethiopian \r\nand Jewish traditions tell the story of the Queen of \r\nSheba. After hearing about the wisdom of Israel’s King \r\nSolomon, she embarked on a three-year journey to meet \r\nthe only ruler at the time who could match her intellect, \r\nambition and visionary leadership. The story was a sign \r\nof things to come. Today, the women of Africa carry the \r\nsame determination and spirit. They are pioneers who \r\nspearhead the progress of their nations, from President \r\nEllen Johnson-Sirleaf in Liberia to Foreign Minister \r\nLouise Mushikiwabo in Rwanda to the late Nobel \r\nlaureate Wangari Maathai in Kenya.\r\n22 12 55213\r\nA/67/PV.25\r\nOther mechanisms can contribute to Africa’s \r\ndevelopment as well. With that in mind, Indonesia, \r\nthrough the New Asian-African Strategic Partnership, \r\nhas built a solid base for extensive cooperation with \r\nAfrica, especially in terms of trade and investment, \r\ntourism, information and communications technology \r\nand the environment. Indonesia has assisted in capacity-\r\nbuilding in the field of agriculture and food security. \r\nAppropriate technology has been transferred, and we \r\nare continuously working with a number of countries in \r\nAfrica to develop rice fields with varieties that suit the \r\ncontinent’s weather and farming conditions.\r\nThe magnitude of Africa’s development challenges \r\ndemands ever-increasing support and commitment. \r\nThe public health threat from malaria and other \r\ncommunicable diseases has not diminished. Eliminating \r\nmalaria in most developing countries, particularly in \r\nAfrica, remains a daunting challenge owing to limited \r\ncapacities, knowledge and resources. The transfer of \r\ntechnology and capacity-building need therefore to be \r\nfurther developed and broadened, including by working \r\nwithin the South-South cooperation framework, among \r\nother models.\r\nManaging a pandemic disease such as malaria \r\ntakes a great deal of resources. Indonesia recognizes \r\nthat global action is indispensable for effectiveness \r\nat the national level. First, it is important that any \r\nmalaria eradication programme be community-driven. \r\nA crucial priority is to raise awareness of the issues \r\nsurrounding malaria among all key components of the \r\ncommunity, including the private sector. Secondly, in \r\norder to achieve optimum results, malaria eradication \r\nprogrammes must have clear, precise and timely targets. \r\nThirdly, to prevent resistance to malaria, anti-malaria \r\ndrugs should be used correctly under the supervision \r\nof health-care personnel. Malaria patients must have \r\naccess to a high-quality diagnosis and early treatment. \r\nSafe, high-quality and affordable anti-malarial drugs \r\nshould be accessible to all those who need them. \r\nLast but not least, bilateral, regional and multilateral \r\npartnerships, including public and private partnerships, \r\nshould be encouraged and strengthened to achieve a \r\nmalaria-free world.\r\nAt the national level, my country has taken the \r\nnecessary measures to achieve a malaria-free Indonesia \r\nby 2030. On the occasion of the commemoration of \r\nWorld Malaria Day in April, Indonesia launched the \r\nnational Roll Back Malaria Partnership, which supports \r\nits national malaria strategic plan for 2012-2014.\r\ninto action and problems into solutions. As someone \r\nwho had the opportunity to witness at first hand the \r\nresourcefulness and resolve of the African people, \r\nI strongly believe that every African problem has an \r\nAfrican solution. An old African proverb says, “If you \r\ncan talk you can sing, if you can walk you can dance”. \r\nThe vast promise of Africa is clear. And to be true \r\npartners, the members of the international community \r\nmust hear the distinctive sound of the African continent, \r\nfeel its beat and move to its rhythm.\r\nMr. Khan (Indonesia): First of all, allow me to \r\nassociate my delegation with the statement made by the \r\nrepresentative of Algeria on behalf of the Group of 77 \r\nand China. Indonesia would also like to commend the \r\nSecretary-General for his reports on today’s agenda \r\nitems (A/67/204 and A/67/205).\r\nThe New Partnership for Africa’s Development \r\n(NEPAD) is a reflection of Africa’s renewed spirit for \r\nsustainable development, durable peace and stability. \r\nIndonesia therefore welcomes and supports NEPAD’s \r\nvision as an important progressive step for the continent \r\nand the world. A little over a decade after NEPAD \r\nwas launched, there has been very encouraging and \r\nnoteworthy progress by many African countries. Seeing \r\nthat progress in Africa provides increased confidence \r\nand hope about what can be achieved there.\r\nAfrica has taken important steps to practice \r\ngood governance, strengthen capacity, improve \r\nmacroeconomic frameworks for development and \r\nbuild infrastructure. It is important to support those \r\nhomegrown efforts intended to expand and upgrade \r\nAfrica’s linkages with the world economy and to create \r\nsustained peace on the continent. Africa will also \r\nbenefit immeasurably from an enabling international \r\nenvironment conducive to its development. Ensuring an \r\nequitable global trading and financial system is central \r\nto creating such an environment.\r\nGlobal partnership and international support are \r\nimperative to NEPAD’s success. They enable Africa \r\nto maximize its potential for growth and development. \r\nBilateral and triangular cooperation, as well as South-\r\nSouth cooperation, are important components of the \r\nglobal partnership. We should not forget that public-\r\nprivate and private-private partnerships play an \r\nimportant role in expanding Africa’s creative capacities. \r\nInternational support must also include financing for \r\nthe successful implementation of various domestic \r\ninitiatives.\r\n12 55213 23\r\nA/67/PV.25\r\nAlmost half a century ago, the Organization of \r\nAfrican Unity (OAU) was established with the primary \r\nmandate to liberate the continent from the scourges \r\nof colonization, imperialism and apartheid and to \r\npromote unity and solidarity among African States. \r\nThe decolonization and liberation of Africa did not \r\ncome on a silver platter but were won through the \r\ngallant struggles of ordinary and heroic people on the \r\ncontinent.\r\nWith many countries achieving independence \r\nand, ultimately, a democratic transition, and with the \r\nushering in of a new era in South Africa in 1994, it \r\nbecame necessary for the OAU to transform and to \r\nreclaim its rightful place in global affairs. Therefore, \r\nwith the formation of the African Union, African \r\ncountries began to look into new ways to deal with the \r\ncomplex challenges of poverty, underdevelopment and \r\nconflicts that faced the continent.\r\nThe African Union set up the African Peace and \r\nSecurity Architecture, aimed at engaging in conflict \r\nprevention, resolution and post-conflict reconstruction. \r\nThe Peace and Security Architecture includes \r\nmechanisms such as the Peace and Security Council, \r\nthe continental early warning system, the Panel of the \r\nWise as an enhanced mediation capacity, the African \r\nStandby Force and the African Union Post-Conflict \r\nReconstruction and Development Framework. It \r\nestablishes a wide range of basic norms and values, all \r\naimed at engaging in conflict prevention and resolution \r\nand post-conflict reconstruction.\r\nOn the economic and development front, it was \r\ncritical that the continent should come up with a new \r\napproach to define its relationship with the world. In that \r\ncontext, the New Partnership for Africa’s Development \r\n(NEPAD) provided a new dynamism and vision to the \r\nAfrican agenda for peace and development. It signified \r\nAfrica’s willingness, capacity and determination \r\nto assume full control of its destiny. As an African-\r\nowned and African-driven political, economic and \r\nsocial development blueprint for the continent’s future, \r\nNEPAD was welcomed by the entire international \r\ncommunity, including the General Assembly. For that \r\nreason, continued concerted efforts should be made to \r\nensure its successful implementation on the ground by \r\nboth Africans and international partners.\r\nMy delegation would like to express our sincere \r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for the reports \r\non issues affecting Africa under discussion today, \r\nincluding NEPAD (A/67/204), causes of conflict \r\nIndonesia is heartened to learn that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report on the causes of conflict and the \r\npromotion of durable peace and sustainable development \r\nin Africa (A/67/205) provides explicit references to \r\nthe nexus between peacekeeping and peacebuilding. \r\nIt also stresses the attainment of durable peace in the \r\nregion through conflict prevention. Indonesia has \r\nbeen not only a steadfast supporter and advocate of \r\npeacekeeping, peacebuilding and conflict prevention, \r\nbut also a key contributor to various United Nations \r\npeacekeeping missions. On post-conflict peacebuilding \r\nissues, Indonesia has undertaken work both within and \r\noutside the Peacebuilding Commission (PBC). We have \r\nbeen implementing conflict prevention at home, as well \r\nas in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations region.\r\nWe are pleased to note that the report contains \r\ninformation, although brief, on the report of the \r\nSecretary-General on civilian capacity in the aftermath \r\nof conflict (A/66/311), which is being used as a basis \r\nto develop and to implement capacity development \r\nguidance tools in order to strengthen the linkage among \r\nhumanitarian intervention, development and conflict \r\nprevention. Through the follow-up of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report, a valuable platform is provided for \r\nbringing conflict analysis and peacebuilding into \r\nregular development programming.\r\nIndonesia stresses upholding the national ownership \r\nprinciple, in particular in the PBC’s engagement with \r\nthe six countries of its country configurations, many of \r\nwhich have progressed in their national peacebuilding. \r\nWe commend their persistence in and focus on advancing \r\npeacebuilding in their respective countries, working \r\ntogether with regional and subregional organizations, \r\nwith the support of the international community and \r\nthe United Nations.\r\nIt is important to keep in mind that Africa should \r\nand must be given a chance to find solutions that \r\nspecifically address its own situation. We believe \r\nthat the nature of the international community’s \r\ndevelopment support to Africa must be adequate and \r\nsustainable. Africa desires such a partnership in order \r\nto overcome its historical constraints and enable it to \r\nenjoy the freedoms of free nations.\r\nMr. Mashabane (South Africa): Today’s debate \r\ncomes at a critical stage on the African continent. This \r\nyear marks the tenth anniversary of the establishment \r\nof the African Union (AU), and the first-ever female \r\nChair of the organization assumed office only two days \r\nago.\r\n24 12 55213\r\nA/67/PV.25\r\nOffice of the Special Adviser on Africa has a special \r\nand critical role to play in that regard.\r\nIn February 2010, the fourteenth ordinary session \r\nof the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of \r\nthe African Union established the NEPAD Planning \r\nand Coordinating Agency as a technical body of the \r\nAfrican Union and fully integrated NEPAD into the \r\nstructures and processes of the AU. NEPAD has entered \r\nits implementation phase. NEPAD implementation \r\nis also critical in the context of following up the \r\noutcome of the United Nations Conference on \r\nSustainable Development (resolution 66/288, annex) \r\nand considering its concerns, including droughts, \r\ndesertification and land degradation. Our continent’s \r\ndevelopment priorities, embedded in NEPAD, need to \r\nbe incorporated into the new development agenda.\r\nThe sixteenth session of the African Union \r\nAssembly endorsed seven regional infrastructure \r\nprojects, covering the five AU regions, all  championed \r\nby Heads of State and Government under the \r\nPresidential Infrastructure Champion Initiative. It is \r\nthe intention of the Initiative to provide leadership to \r\nunlock strategic and catalytic interventions in support \r\nof physical interconnectivity among the various regions \r\nand States in Africa. The interventions will facilitate \r\nthe free movement of goods, services, people, factors \r\nof production and investment, in order to enhance the \r\nintegration of the continent into the global economic \r\nzone. \r\nJacob Zuma, President of the Republic of South \r\nAfrica, is the Chair of the Presidential Infrastructure \r\nChampion Initiative. For its part, the United \r\nNations should continue to support efforts to boost \r\nintra-African trade, by assisting African countries \r\nand regional economic communities to move forward \r\nin implementing the continent’s regional integration \r\nagenda and to fast-track the establishment of the pan-\r\nAfrican free trade zone. Such support could cover the \r\nprovision of technical analysis, research and capacity-\r\nbuilding in harmonizing regulations and mobilizing \r\nsupport and resources in the areas of trade facilitation, \r\ntransport and infrastructure.\r\nMy delegation concurs with the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport in that the development partners should fulfil \r\nthe existing commitments to increase the quantity and \r\neffectiveness of development assistance.\r\nWe salute the Secretary-General in selecting \r\nmalaria as one of the priorities of his second mandate \r\nin Africa (A/67/205) and malaria. Furthermore, we \r\nwould like to reiterate the significance of the support \r\nto the New Partnership for Africa’s Development. We \r\nrecognize that NEPAD remains the critical blueprint \r\nfor Africa’s development.\r\nFor their part, African countries, through the AU \r\nand in their national capacities, have made efforts to \r\nensure that the necessary conducive environment \r\nfor the success of NEPAD exists. On the political \r\nfront, African countries have embraced the African \r\nPeer Review Mechanism as a positive and innovative \r\napproach to the promotion of good governance. In \r\nthat context, 30 African countries have acceded to the \r\nMechanism, of which 12 have undergone peer reviews.\r\nSeveral United Nations reports have highlighted \r\nthe fact that the majority of sub-Saharan countries \r\nare unlikely to achieve most of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals by the 2015 deadline. The \r\ninternational community needs to work with African \r\ncountries to ensure that concerted efforts are made \r\nto achieve those Goals. In that context, the support of \r\ninternational partners for NEPAD is an integral part \r\nof that success. Notwithstanding the many challenges \r\nfacing countries as a result of the recent global financial \r\nand economic downturn, international partners should \r\ncontinue to work with African countries to ensure that \r\nthe commitments made to NEPAD are translated into \r\nresults on the ground.\r\nIn taking stock of the level and rate of success \r\nof cooperation within NEPAD, we have no doubt \r\nthat NEPAD has made an important contribution \r\nto accelerating the pace of development in African \r\ncountries and to promoting their participation in and \r\nenjoyment of the benefits of the international economic \r\nsystem. With the help of NEPAD, economies in Africa \r\nhave provided opportunities for trade and investment \r\nwith each other and have played an important role in \r\nsharing their experience and expertise. They stand \r\nready to help one another in the attainment of the \r\ninternational development goals, particularly the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, so as to ensure \r\nsustainable development for all countries.\r\nSouth Africa reaffirms its support for the call to \r\nstrengthen the role of the United Nations system in \r\nfurthering NEPAD cooperation. In that regard, it is \r\ncritical that the members of the international community \r\nwork together so as to enhance the NEPAD vision for \r\nAfrica’s development. We also strongly believe that the \r\n12 55213 25\r\nA/67/PV.25\r\ncontinuing support of the United Nations system in the \r\nimplementation of the African agenda.\r\nThe General Assembly debate is of the utmost \r\nimportance to Africa’s development, particularly in \r\nbringing about the settlement of international disputes \r\nby peaceful means. In contributing to the debate, I recall \r\nthat during the last decade, NEPAD has played a critical \r\nrole in promoting democracy and good governance \r\nthrough its f lagship programme, the African Peer \r\nReview Mechanism. That monitoring mechanism is \r\nunique in the world for advancing good governance and \r\nbest practices among political peers.\r\nSince its inception, NEPAD has inspired sector \r\npolicy frameworks and programmes to guide African \r\nrenewal. In particular, the African Union has adopted \r\nthe Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development \r\nProgramme (CAADP) and the Programme for \r\nInfrastructure Development in Africa (PIDA), thereby \r\nhelping to change the livelihoods of African people.\r\nInfrastructure development is key for the \r\ncontinent’s sustainable growth and regional \r\nintegration. In demonstrating political commitment, \r\nAfrican leaders recently adopted the Presidential \r\nInfrastructure Champion Initiative to fast-track the \r\nimplementation of seven regional projects. The set \r\ntargets of PIDA are to develop 37,000 kilometres of \r\nhighways, 30,000 kilometres of railways and 16,000 \r\nkilometres of interconnected power lines, among other \r\nthings, by 2040. The expected impact is to facilitate the \r\nmovement of persons, goods and services throughout \r\nthe continent. To that effect, the NEPAD Agency, as \r\nthe executing entity of PIDA, is working towards the \r\nfacilitation and coordination of development corridors, \r\nthe promotion of sustainable energy and the expansion \r\nof Africa’s digital economy.\r\nAgriculture and food security are a key focus area \r\nfor NEPAD. Through CAADP, which will celebrate 10 \r\nyears in 2013, we are promoting investment planning \r\nin agriculture for increased public- and private-sector \r\nparticipation. We are also building the necessary \r\npartnership support through the Scaling Up Nutrition \r\ninitiative and the Group of Eight’s New Alliance for \r\nNutrition and Food Security, to achieve Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goal 1. To attain our targets, we actively \r\ncollaborate with regional economic communities, \r\ndevelopment banks, civil society and the private sector \r\nto implement NEPAD programmes.\r\nin office. Let me commend the work done by the \r\nRoll Back Malaria Partnership; the African Leaders \r\nMalaria Alliance; the Special Envoy of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for Malaria; the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, \r\nTuberculosis and Malaria; World Bank; the World \r\nHealth Organization; the United Nations Children’s \r\nFund; and other partners, in their assistance in the fight \r\nagainst malaria.\r\nWe are committed to increasing our domestic \r\ninvestment to combat malaria and support subregional \r\neconomic developmental blocks in order to improve \r\ncoordination and collaboration with our neighbours to \r\neliminate malaria across our borders. In that regard, \r\nwe call on international partners to complement our \r\nnational and subregional resources in the fight against \r\nmalaria and to assist us in building capacity to sustain \r\nthe gains we have made thus far.\r\nTo sustain the momentum that has been achieved, \r\nwe need to accelerate cross-border malaria intervention, \r\nenhance active case-based malaria surveillance to \r\nscreen populations harbouring malaria parasites and \r\nprovide treatment to cure and stop further transmission. \r\nIn addition, we need to expand our research on malaria \r\nby focusing on the development of new drugs, such as \r\nthe recently announced compound under development \r\nat the University of Cape Town in South Africa.\r\nSouth Africa continues to support the use of \r\nDDT for indoor residual spraying as it has proved to \r\nbe effective in many areas and has contributed to a \r\nhuge decline in malaria cases in the country. Those \r\ncountries that choose to use it are directly contributing \r\nto addressing the cause and not only dealing with the \r\neffect of the disease. Therefore, until such time as an \r\neffective and affordable alternative to DDT is available \r\nto developing countries, the use of residual spraying to \r\neradicate the disease should be allowed.\r\nThe Acting President: In accordance with General \r\nAssembly resolution 2011 (XX) of 11 October 1965 and \r\ndecision 56/475 of 15 August 2002, I now call on the \r\nobserver for the African Union.\r\nMr. Mayaki (African Union): On behalf of \r\nthe Planning and Coordinating Agency of the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), \r\nallow me first to convey my warmest congratulations \r\nto Mr. Vuk Jeremić on his election as the President \r\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. \r\nI trust that his experience and energy will contribute \r\nto the promotion of meaningful global cooperation and \r\n26 12 55213\r\nA/67/PV.25\r\nready to work with the United Nations system and the \r\ninternational community as a whole to improve the \r\ncoherence and coordination of sustainable development \r\nprogrammes and policies. The participation of women, \r\nyouth and other stakeholder groups in that process is \r\nalso critical.\r\nToday, as we observe the International Day for the \r\nEradication of Poverty, NEPAD reiterates its sound \r\ncommitment to combating poverty in Africa. Overall, \r\nAfrican countries have made significant progress \r\ntowards achieving the Millennium Development Goals, \r\neven though not all targets will be met by 2015. The \r\npost-2015 development agenda must take into account \r\nthe sustainability of Africa’s growth and development. \r\nAs the African Union f lagship programme, NEPAD \r\nwill therefore promote sustainable development goals \r\nthat combine economic, social and environmental \r\nsolutions. In that regard, we believe that sustainable \r\ndevelopment goals will unleash the potential for Africa \r\nto achieve its ambition as a pillar of global growth.\r\nBefore concluding, I wish to commend the quality \r\nof our relationship with the Office of the Special \r\nAdviser on Africa, under the able leadership of \r\nAmbassador Maged Abdelaziz. It is essential that the \r\nOffice continue to play its lead role in supporting the \r\nimplementation of NEPAD through the United Nations \r\nglobal platform. Equally, UNECA, the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme and other United Nations \r\nagencies have been critical in supporting NEPAD \r\nover the years. We will continue to work towards \r\nconsolidating our partnership with the international \r\ncommunity, represented here at the United Nations.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe Acting President: I would like to make the \r\nfollowing announcements concerning the work of the \r\nplenary. \r\nThe consideration of agenda item 38, “The \r\nsituation in Afghanistan”, originally scheduled for \r\nThursday, 8 November, has been postponed to Tuesday, \r\n27 November. \r\nIn addition, the joint debate on the following items, \r\noriginally scheduled for Tuesday, 27 November, has \r\nbeen moved to Wednesday, 28 November: agenda item \r\n14, “Integrated and coordinated implementation of and \r\nfollow-up to the outcomes of the major United Nations \r\nconferences and summits in the economic, social and \r\nrelated fields”; agenda item 113, “Follow-up to the \r\nAfrica is determined to maintain its macroeconomic \r\nreforms and growth path. Indeed, Africa has grown \r\nimpressively over the last 10 years, registering growth \r\nrates of over 5 per cent per year. The continent continues \r\nto exceed the global growth average, thereby exhibiting \r\na favourable economic trend. For Africa to sustain \r\nits transformation agenda, it is committed to moving \r\ntowards double-digit growth that is both inclusive and \r\nequitable.\r\nOne of the most critical factors in the changing \r\ndevelopment landscape is the primacy of domestic \r\nresources for our development. In that context, our \r\nleaders emphasized that mobilization of domestic \r\nresources by African Governments is critical for the \r\nimplementation of regional projects that have been \r\nprioritized through NEPAD. In that respect, NEPAD \r\nis collaborating with the United Nations Economic \r\nCommission for Africa (UNECA), the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme and the African Development \r\nBank to come up with appropriate mechanisms for \r\ndomestic resource mobilization and utilization. We are \r\nalso engaging stakeholders on reducing illicit financial \r\nf lows, which constitute a huge drain on Africa’s \r\nresources.\r\nIn the recent past, Africa has been reducing \r\nbarriers that hinder regional integration, particularly \r\nfor intra-African trade. Today, the continent is more \r\nprivate-sector and investment friendly. In 2010, the total \r\nforeign direct investment was more than $55 billion, \r\nwhich is five times larger than a decade ago. In 2011, \r\nprivate equity firms raised $1.5 billion for projects on \r\nthe continent. A key component of that transformation \r\nis the fact that the African private sector itself is \r\ninvesting more in the continent.\r\nThrough the African Union, the continent \r\nactively engaged with the international community \r\nat the United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (Rio+20). We applaud the adoption of the \r\nRio+20 outcome document (resolution 66/288, annex) \r\nand its affirmation of NEPAD as Africa’s sustainable \r\ndevelopment framework. We further welcome the \r\ncall on the international community to enhance its \r\nsupport and to fulfil its commitments to advancing \r\naction in areas that are critical to Africa’s sustainable \r\ndevelopment.\r\nWe hope to see the implementation of the framework \r\nfor action, with the use of regional institutions as \r\nfollow-up mechanisms. We affirm that NEPAD is \r\n12 55213 27\r\nA/67/PV.25\r\nFinally, agenda item 117, “Question of equitable \r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of \r\nthe Security Council and related matters”, originally \r\nscheduled for Monday, 3 December, will now be \r\nconsidered on Thursday, 15 November in a joint debate \r\nwith agenda item 30, “Report of the Security Council”.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.05 p.m.\r\noutcome of the Millennium Summit”; sub-item (a) of \r\nagenda item 118, “Strengthening of the United Nations \r\nsystem”, and sub-item (b) of agenda item 118, “Central \r\nrole of the United Nations system in global governance”; \r\nand agenda item 119, “United Nations reform: measures \r\nand proposals”. \r\n"
