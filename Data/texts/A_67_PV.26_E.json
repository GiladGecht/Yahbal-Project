My delegation aligns itself with \r\nthe statement made earlier by the representative of \r\nCameroon on behalf of the Group of African States (see \r\nA/67/PV.25).\r\nWe commend the appointment of Mr. Maged \r\nAbdelaziz as Special Adviser to the Secretary-General \r\non Africa, and consider the appointment as a proper step \r\ntowards reinvigorating and supporting the activities of \r\nthe Office of the Special Adviser on Africa.\r\nThe reports under consideration address a number \r\nof subjects relating to the challenges faced by the \r\ncontinent, including areas where significant progress \r\ncould be made by the African people. They also \r\nhighlight a number of policy measures taken by many \r\nAfrican countries and organizations regarding the \r\nimplementation of the priorities of the New Partnership \r\nfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD), the responses of \r\nthe international community and the support provided \r\nby the United Nations system in the past year.\r\nMy delegation notes that, despite those challenges, \r\nAfrican countries have made significant progress \r\nin the implementation of NEPAD sectoral priorities, \r\nespecially in the areas of governance, infrastructure, \r\ninformation and communications technology and \r\nagriculture. We are encouraged by the progress reports \r\non the support provided by the United Nations system in \r\nstrengthening the Regional Coordination Mechanism \r\nof United Nations agencies and entities working to \r\nsupport the African Union and its New Partnership \r\nfor Africa’s Development and its cluster system. We \r\nequally note the progress made in the area of capacity-\r\nbuilding through the United Nations-African Union \r\nsecretariat of the Regional Coordination Mechanism’s \r\nbusiness cluster plans.\r\nWith regard to those issues that have been singled \r\nout as areas where actions have been taken aimed at \r\nrealizing the goals of NEPAD, we wish to restate the \r\nneed for more investments in agriculture, food security \r\nUnited Nations A/67/PV.26\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-seventh session\r\n26th plenary meeting\r\nWednesday, 17 October 2012, 3 p.m.\r\nNew York\r\nOffi cial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Jeremić . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Serbia)\r\n2 12-55308\r\nA/67/PV.26\r\nand health. That is because one of the key sectors that \r\nrequires synergies of actions by the African countries \r\nand their partners is the development of agriculture \r\nand food security. As indicated in the reports of \r\nthe Secretary-General, Africa’s share of the global \r\nagriculture market is extremely low and has further \r\ndecreased in recent years.\r\nIn addition, some aspects of the report highlight \r\nthe importance of agriculture and food security for \r\nthe development of the continent. In a continuously \r\ninterdependent global environment, we wish to \r\nemphasize the need for the implementation of the \r\ncommitments made by development partners, which \r\ncould further assist African countries to overcome \r\ndevelopment challenges and facilitate the attainment of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals.\r\nIn that regard, we join the Secretary-General in \r\ncalling on Africa’s development partners to deliver on \r\nthe commitments made regarding Africa’s development \r\nneeds, including those concerning the implementation \r\nof NEPAD priorities, in order to fulfil their promises \r\nand implement their commitments. We also call on the \r\nGroup of Eight countries to fulfil the commitments \r\nmade to Africa at the 2005 Gleneagles summit. We \r\nespecially call for the fulfilment of the commitments in \r\nthe areas of agricultural funding and development, as \r\nstressed in the report.\r\nThe New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition, \r\nlaunched early this year, aims to support 50 million \r\npeople and to assist them to move out of poverty within \r\n10 years, in particular by mobilizing private capital for \r\nAfrica’s agriculture and by scaling up investment and \r\ntechnology to enhance agricultural productivity. We \r\nbelieve that that initiative could also serve as a model \r\nfor cooperation and engagement between Africa and \r\nthe rest of the world.\r\nOne challenge to development on the African \r\ncontinent has been the numerous conflicts and crises \r\nin various regions. We commend the discussion in the \r\nSecretary-General’s report on issues relating to the \r\ncauses of conflict and the promotion of durable peace \r\nand sustainable development in Africa. We agree that \r\nthe systematic exclusion of significant parts of society \r\nfrom the institutions of political governance and key \r\neconomic assets and social services is one of the causes \r\nof conflict on the continent. We also appreciate the \r\nfocus of this year’s report on the larger issues of the \r\nmanagement of diversity and the urgent need to address \r\nthe related challenges to peace, stability and sustainable \r\ndevelopment.\r\nMy delegation remains concerned about the report’s \r\ndiscussion of arms proliferation, which aggravates \r\nlong-standing conflicts and induces terrorist activities \r\nin some parts of the continent. It is more worrisome \r\nthat criminal groups in some regions have taken \r\nthe opportunity to increase recruitment and create \r\nlocal support networks for gathering information and \r\nsupplying arms and ammunition, thereby facilitating \r\ntransnational organized crime.\r\nIn that connection, let me take this opportunity \r\nto commend the efforts of Member States, which \r\nworked assiduously last month to work out the outcome \r\ndocument of the second United Nations Conference to \r\nReview Progress Made in the Implementation of the \r\nProgramme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate \r\nthe Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in \r\nAll Its Aspects (A/CONF.192/2012/RC/4, annex I), \r\nunder the presidency of Ambassador Joy Ogwu of \r\nNigeria.\r\nNigeria is not immune to some of those challenges. \r\nMy country is currently battling the heinous and \r\ncriminal activities of the Boko Haram group. Rest \r\nassured, however, that we are working tirelessly to \r\naddress the problem in a comprehensive manner. In the \r\nsubregion, Nigeria has also been guiding other African \r\nleaders in addressing the crisis in the Sahel region. We \r\ntherefore call on the international community to support \r\nthe current steps taken by the Economic Community of \r\nWest African States to address the political and security \r\nsituation in Mali. We believe that by addressing the \r\nsecurity situation in the region, especially the current \r\nsituation in Mali, regional States will be able to build \r\nupon the achievements made over the years towards the \r\nrealization of the Millennium Development Goals and \r\nin pursuit of the sustainable development goals.\r\nMy delegation notes the achievements of the \r\nAssembly in implementing the recommendations on the \r\nkey priority areas identified in the Secretary-General’s \r\nreview report of 2010 (A/65/165). The activities of the \r\nOffice of the Special Adviser on Africa, as outlined \r\nin the report, are commendable. However, there is \r\na need for additional posts and resources to enable \r\nthe Office to fulfil its mandate with regard to the \r\nUnited Nations monitoring mechanism. We call on all \r\nMembers of the United Nations to support the Office in \r\nrealizing its full mandate, especially in supporting the \r\n12-55308 3\r\nA/67/PV.26\r\nin the past few years. Larviciding and indoor residual \r\nspraying have also been rolled out in phases. The impact \r\nof such efforts is becoming obvious. More children now \r\nsleep under long-lasting insecticide-treated nets than \r\npreviously. It is estimated that over 166,000 lives of \r\nchildren under 5 years of age have been saved using the \r\nLives Saved Tool.\r\nA number of challenges currently threaten \r\nNigeria’s resolve to move from the control stage to the \r\nelimination stage of malaria intervention. In the past \r\ntwo months, many parts of the country have witnessed \r\nunprecedented f looding, which has left many people \r\nhomeless. That situation is likely to prompt an \r\nincreased incidence of malaria, given that there are now \r\nmore breeding sites for the mosquito vector than usual. \r\nBesides, many of the supplies needed for intervention \r\nhave been destroyed by the f loods.\r\nLet me affirm Nigeria’s fullest commitment to \r\nvigorously address the scourge of malaria through \r\nvarious means, including the adoption and use of long-\r\nlasting insecticide-treated nets for malaria control in the \r\ncountry. In order to rapidly scale up that intervention, a \r\nmixed model comprising a catch-up phase, as part of the \r\nmass universal campaign, and a keep-up phase in routine \r\ndistribution was identified as part of Nigeria’s National \r\nMalaria Control Programme 2009-2013. That has been \r\ndeclared as the strategy for scaling up that intervention. \r\nWe have received significant support from our external \r\npartners through the universal mass campaign, which \r\nbegan in 2009. We call on the international community \r\nto assist with capacity-building in the local production \r\nof long-lasting insecticide-treated nets.\r\nLet me affirm Nigeria’s continued commitment \r\nto improving the lives of the people of Africa. The \r\ncontinent must not be defined either by violence or by \r\nfailure. The African people and the world owe the future \r\ngenerations of Africans an enabling environment, \r\nwhere dreams are achieved and aspirations are met in \r\ntheir entirety.\r\nMr. Nam Bora (Cambodia): I would like to say \r\nthat Cambodia and the entire nation of Cambodia is \r\nmourning the passing of His Majesty former King \r\nNorodom Sihanouk, who was the architect of the \r\nfriendship between Asia and Africa.\r\nI am here today in mourning, yes, but I would like \r\nfirst of all to express thanks to the Secretary-General for \r\nhis comprehensive report contained in the documents \r\nentitled “New Partnership for Africa’s Development: \r\nimplementation of the outcome document of the United \r\nNations Conference on Sustainable Development \r\n(resolution 66/288, annex) and in shaping the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda. There is also a need to raise the \r\nprofile of interaction between African regional and \r\nsubregional organizations with Member States in order \r\nto further strengthen United Nations support for the \r\nactivities of the Office.\r\nTwo years after the target date for rolling back \r\nthe malaria scourge in Africa, malaria remains a \r\nmajor public health threat in Nigeria, accounting for \r\n30 per cent of the under-five mortality rate and 11 per \r\ncent of the maternal mortality rate. With a steady \r\ntransmission rate and a seasonal peak from April to \r\nOctober, the disease has a significant impact on the \r\neconomic situation in the country, where 167 million \r\ninhabitants are at risk. Approximately $835 million is \r\nlost annually in prevention and treatment costs, as well \r\nas absenteeism, lost productivity and disability.\r\nA number of measures are being implemented \r\nto address the issue. For instance, in line with \r\nthe transformation agenda of Nigeria’s current \r\nAdministration, the Government programme includes \r\na malaria-control initiative. Nigeria aligns itself with \r\nthe Abuja Declaration to Roll Back Malaria in Africa, \r\nannounced by African heads of State and Government \r\nat the beginning of the decade in order to halve the \r\nburden of the disease by the year 2010. Nigeria bases its \r\nmalaria-control and eradication efforts on four strategic \r\npillars, which include the distribution of long-lasting \r\ninsecticide-treated nets to achieve universal coverage \r\nof the population, prompt diagnosis and treatment \r\nwith effective medicines, indoor residual spraying to \r\ncurtail transmission and the prevention of malaria in \r\npregnancy through intermittent preventive treatment.\r\nSupported by external partners, high-impact \r\nmalaria interventions have been put in place and are \r\nbeing rapidly scaled up to achieve results. At last count, \r\n51.6 million long-lasting insecticide-treated nets had \r\nbeen distributed to the populace through campaigns. \r\nThat is being complemented by a robust strategy for \r\nroutine distribution to sustain the coverage of 80 per \r\ncent so far achieved.\r\nIn addition, the rational treatment of malaria with \r\nartemisinin combination therapy, based on diagnosis \r\nwith rapid diagnostic tests kits and microscopy, is seen \r\nas the gold standard for the prevention of resistance. \r\nIntermittent preventive treatment of pregnant women \r\nhas increased from 5 per cent to more than 13 per cent \r\n4 12-55308\r\nA/67/PV.26\r\ntenth consolidated progress report on implementation \r\nand international support” (A/67/204) and “Causes \r\nof conflict and promotion of durable peace and \r\nsustainable development in Africa” (A/67/205), as well \r\nthe earlier report entitled “2001-2010: Decade to Roll \r\nBack Malaria in Developing Countries, Particularly in \r\nAfrica” (A/66/169).\r\nCambodia attaches great importance to its \r\nfriendship and cooperation with Africa. Over the \r\ndecades, the relationships between Cambodia and \r\nAfrican countries have been consolidated and \r\nenhanced in the spirit of solidarity, close cooperation \r\nand mutual respect. Cambodia strongly supports the \r\nimplementation of the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) and considers it an important \r\ntool for addressing poverty and underdevelopment \r\nthroughout the African continent. Cambodia believes \r\nthat NEPAD has also provided a collective vision and \r\na strategic socioeconomic development framework for \r\nAfrica.\r\nI would like to remind the Assembly that in 2002, \r\nwhen Cambodia was Chair of the Association of \r\nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN), we took the initiative \r\nof sending an invitation to the NEPAD Chair, former \r\nSouth African President Mbeki, to come to Cambodia \r\nto deliver a statement about African development. \r\nCambodia also welcomes the significant progress made \r\nthrough the efforts of the African peoples and leaders \r\nto address some of the sectoral priorities of NEPAD and \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), such as \r\neducation, health, infrastructure and agriculture.\r\nAs emphasized in the Secretary-General’s reports, \r\nmost African countries face serious challenges in \r\nreaching the MDGs, particularly in the current fragile \r\nand uncertain global economic recovery. Cambodia \r\nshares the view that much needs to be done in support \r\nof Africa’s implementation of NEPAD and the MDGs. \r\nContinued attention and assistance for Africa should \r\nremain a focus of international development action \r\nplans and programmes. Cambodia will continue to \r\nwork in that direction.\r\nIn that regard, Cambodia also reaffirms its \r\ncommitment to strengthen its cooperation and \r\ncollaboration with Africa. We are ready to enhance \r\nour relationship and partnership with Africa for the \r\nachievement of the MDGs and sustainable development. \r\nWe believe that through mutual support and the \r\nsharing of experiences and practices in socioeconomic \r\ndevelopment both Cambodia and the African States can \r\nachieve those objectives.\r\nFurthermore, we believe that South-South \r\ncooperation is the best strategy to promote an ASEAN \r\nand African partnership. South-South cooperation \r\nis key to strategic areas, such as the Comprehensive \r\nAfrica Agriculture Development Programme, that \r\nwould significantly contribute to Africa’s development \r\nand integration in terms of poverty and hunger \r\neradication, agriculture and rural development, as well \r\nas the mitigation of and adaptation to climate change.\r\nIn that connection, the recent integration of NEPAD \r\ninto the structures and processes of the African Union \r\nand the establishment of the NEPAD Planning and \r\nCoordinating Agency can make a significant impact on \r\nNEPAD’s implementation. We also believe that it is a \r\ngood way to facilitate and to improve the management \r\nand coordination of Africa’s regional and continental \r\npriority programmes and projects, promising better \r\noutcomes for Africa’s development process.\r\nHaving said that, Cambodia fully supports the \r\nconclusion and recommendations of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral contained in his reports regarding the proper \r\nways and means to scale up the implementation of \r\nNEPAD and build on the momentum of international \r\nsupport for Africa’s development. In addition, we also \r\nsupport the recommendation to establish a review \r\nprocess as a monitoring mechanism of commitments to \r\nAfrica’s development.\r\nFinally, Cambodia welcomes every positive \r\ninitiative to advance the common development agenda \r\nbetween Cambodia and Africa. We stand ready to \r\nstrengthen that cooperation, collaboration and solidarity \r\nwith the international community, particularly with \r\nAfrica, to realize the internationally agreed upon \r\ndevelopment goals, including the MDGs.\r\nMr. Sergeev (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): \r\nAfrican countries today face complex challenges \r\nassociated both with internal transformations as well as \r\nwith the need to respond to external threats, including \r\nshocks on financial and commodities markets, climate \r\nchange and associated natural disasters.\r\nRussia welcomes the efforts of African countries to \r\naccelerate economic growth, strengthen political unity \r\nand cultural cooperation throughout the continent and \r\nincrease the role of Africa in world affairs. The active \r\nparticipation of African States in addressing urgent \r\n12-55308 5\r\nA/67/PV.26\r\ncontemporary problems and full-f ledged integration \r\ninto the global economic and political system are crucial \r\nfor the successful implementation of the outcomes of \r\nthe socio-economic agenda set by major United Nations \r\nconferences and summits.\r\nWe support coordinated measures designed to \r\npromote the sustainable development of the African \r\ncontinent. We attach priority importance to the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) by \r\nactively participating in the agreed steps to provide \r\nNEPAD comprehensive assistance, both bilaterally and \r\nmultilaterally.\r\nTo date, we have already written off the debt \r\nprincipal owed by the African States, which represents \r\nmore than $20 billion. Within the framework of a \r\ndebt-for-development swap, bilateral agreements with \r\nZambia and Tanzania have been signed to use the debt \r\nfor financing development projects. Preparation is \r\nunder way for signing similar agreements with Benin, \r\nMozambique and Ethiopia. The World Bank Group’s \r\nTrust Fund support for development in vulnerable \r\ncountries, primarily in sub-Saharan Africa, received \r\nour contribution of over $50 million.\r\nRussia has provided countries in the region with \r\nhumanitarian assistance, including bilateral assistance. \r\nThe Russian donor contribution to the World Food \r\nProgramme for 2011 was allocated to assist Ethiopia, \r\nSomalia, the Republic of Guinea, Kenya and Djibouti, \r\nand through UNICEF, assistance was provided to \r\nEthiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Djibouti and Eritrea. \r\nThrough the International Civil Defence Organization, \r\nRussian food aid was provided to the Republic of Côte \r\nd’Ivoire. A targeted earmarked contribution was made \r\nto the United Nations Office for the Coordination of \r\nHumanitarian Affairs for its fund to strengthen its \r\ncoordination capacity in the region.\r\nRussia continues to participate in financing efforts \r\nto support Africa through the Group of Eight, the World \r\nBank and other multilateral initiatives.\r\nThe objectives of socioeconomic progress and \r\nimproving living standards in Africa have also been \r\npromoted by the further development of trade and \r\neconomic relations, as well as investment links. A \r\ngrowing number of Russian companies realize that \r\nAfrica is a continent of tremendous opportunities for \r\nbusiness and have started operations or are currently \r\nexpanding their presence in African countries. The \r\nStates of the region enjoy extensive trade preferences. \r\nThe traditional exports of the least developed countries, \r\nmost of which are in Africa, are exempt from import \r\nand customs duties.\r\nRussia is participating in the Global Partnership \r\nfor Education. The Russian decision to allocate to the \r\nWorld Bank $42.9 million for 2008 to 2012 to improve \r\nthe programme to enhance the quality of basic education \r\nin developing countries, including in Africa, has been \r\ncarried out. Over 8,000 African students are currently \r\nstudying in Russian universities, and approximately \r\nhalf of them have scholarships funded by the Russian \r\nfederal budget.\r\nSignificant assistance is being provided to Africa \r\nin the field of public health. The total amount of our \r\nvoluntary contribution to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, \r\nTuberculosis and Malaria has reached $100 million. \r\nWe have pledged to reimburse up to $217 million of \r\nthe Fund’s expenditures for project implementation in \r\nRussia.\r\nRussia attaches great importance to the \r\nimplementation of the goals of the Decade to Roll \r\nBack Malaria in Developing Countries, Particularly \r\nin Africa. In 2011, we paid our full contribution of \r\n$20 million for the implementation of the World \r\nBank Malaria Booster Programme in Africa. In 2010, \r\n$4 million was allocated to a similar programme, the \r\nGlobal Programme for Vaccines and Immunization of \r\nthe World Health Organization.\r\nAs a permanent member of the Security Council, \r\nRussia makes a tangible contribution to the elaboration of \r\nthe strategic policies and practical measures undertaken \r\nby the international community to strengthen peace and \r\nsecurity in Africa. We participate in United Nations \r\npeacekeeping operations throughout the continent. We \r\nhave expanded the training programmes for African \r\npeacekeepers and law enforcement officers. We believe \r\nthat the settlement and prevention of armed conflicts is \r\na key factor in ensuring a safe future for the continent. \r\nWe support the increasingly active role of the African \r\nUnion and subregional organizations in that regard. We \r\nnote the efforts to establish the African Standby Force \r\nand the Continental Early Warning System.\r\nWe call for increased partnership between the \r\nSecurity Council and the African Union Peace and \r\nSecurity Council in settling acute crisis situations. We \r\nsupport the ongoing development of cooperation in that \r\narea between the United Nations and the African Union. \r\n6 12-55308\r\nA/67/PV.26\r\nAn important step in that regard was the adoption of \r\nSecurity Council resolution 2033 (2012) in January.\r\nTo ensure a more lasting peace on the continent, \r\nwhat is needed is more active involvement on the part of \r\nAfrican States themselves. It is essential to ensure that \r\nmeasures are adopted to combat illicit armed factions, \r\nstrengthen good-neighbourly relations and expand \r\ncooperation in order to secure borders and prevent \r\nthe spillover of conflicts, the infiltration of weapons \r\nand mercenaries, mass violations of international \r\nhumanitarian law and impunity for crimes against \r\nhumanity. Russia provides consistent political support \r\nto the relevant efforts undertaken by the African \r\ncommunity and stands ready to further contribute to \r\nthe strengthening of the capacities of African States to \r\ndeal with crisis.\r\nWe believe that all the barriers to transforming \r\nthe continent into an area of security, stability and \r\nsustainable development can be overcome on the sound \r\nbasis of international law, African unity and solidarity \r\nwith the peoples of the continent on the part of the \r\nfriends of Africa.\r\nRussia welcomes the establishment of a monitoring \r\nmechanism under the auspices of the General Assembly \r\nto review progress on commitments made by all \r\nparties for the development of Africa. We expect that \r\nsubstantial and depoliticized dialogue within that \r\nmechanism will help strengthen regional stability \r\nand promote the conditions necessary for sustainable \r\neconomic growth. We are ready to continue to provide \r\nmultifaceted assistance to resolve acute problems \r\nthroughout the continent on the basis of an equitable \r\nand mutually beneficial partnership.\r\nMr. Nishida (Japan): Today, the focus of the \r\ninternational community is on Africa, as the world’s \r\nnew economic frontier, after Asia. In recent years, the \r\nannual economic growth rate of the African continent \r\nhas exceeded 5 per cent.\r\nOn the other hand, Africa still faces various \r\nchallenges, including conflict and poverty. We must \r\nurgently strengthen efforts to help Africa take full \r\nadvantage of its rich natural resources and growing \r\npopulation in order to achieve economies and societies \r\nfrom which all people on the continent can benefit, \r\nincluding the socially vulnerable, such as women and \r\nthe poor. We must also strengthen our efforts to achieve \r\na society that is resilient to natural disasters such as \r\ndroughts and other crises arising from economic and \r\nsocial changes.\r\nThe African economy, like all economies, is \r\naffected by the trends of the global economy. Therefore, \r\nin order to strengthen and diversify sectors that can \r\nfoster robust and sustainable growth, infrastructure \r\ndevelopment in Africa is essential. For that reason, Japan \r\nstrongly supports the Programme for Infrastructure \r\nDevelopment in Africa (PIDA), which is an African \r\ninitiative; we will take the priorities set out in PIDA \r\ninto consideration in implementing our own assistance.\r\nWe should note the fact that more than 40 per cent \r\nof the African population is under 15 years old. Youth \r\nemployment is a matter of economic development, \r\nbut also, naturally, a matter of security. It is critical \r\nfor those young people to secure decent jobs, and job \r\ntraining for the younger generation is an urgent issue.\r\nAgriculture and food security are also key issues in \r\nAfrica. In particular, rural development, with special \r\ncare for women and smallholders, also contributes \r\nto poverty eradication. Japan welcomes the fact that \r\nAfrican countries have collectively committed, through \r\nthe Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development \r\nProgramme, to annually increasing their agricultural \r\nproductivity by 6 per cent and allocating 10 per cent of \r\ntheir national budget to agricultural investment.\r\nClimate change is another serious issue that is \r\nclosely related to agriculture and food security in \r\nAfrica. Supporting Africa so that it can adapt to climate \r\nchange, such as by breeding crop varieties that are \r\nresistant to drought and developing irrigation facilities, \r\nis very important. Japan is currently contributing to \r\nthat effort through the Africa Adaptation Programme \r\nand the formulation of a strategy to promote low-\r\ncarbon growth and climate-resilient development under \r\nthe framework of the Tokyo International Conference \r\non African Development (TICAD).\r\nRegarding health issues, we have made significant \r\nprogress in reducing under-five mortality rates \r\nand curbing the spread of HIV/AIDS, malaria and \r\ntuberculosis. Nevertheless, comprehensive efforts, \r\nincluding further efforts to promote maternal and child \r\nhealth, are necessary in order to accelerate progress \r\ntoward the achievement of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs) throughout Africa.\r\nWith regard to peace and security, which are \r\nnecessary preconditions for sustainable economic \r\n12-55308 7\r\nA/67/PV.26\r\ngrowth, the achievement of the MDGs and the formation \r\nof inclusive and resilient societies, Japan welcomes \r\nthe relevant African initiatives undertaken through \r\nthe African Union and subregional organizations, \r\nespecially in relation to South Sudan, Mali, Somalia and \r\nthe Sahel region. It is important for the international \r\ncommunity to support such African initiatives for \r\npeace and security.\r\nResolution 66/290 on human security, adopted \r\nlast month, was co-facilitated by Jordan and Japan. \r\nIt is important to realize its benefits on the ground. \r\nHuman security is an effective approach that focuses \r\non individual people and helps build societies in which \r\neveryone can live with dignity through action to protect \r\nand empower individuals and communities that are \r\nexposed to actual or potential threats. \r\nJapan is determined to contribute to advancing \r\nhuman security in every corner of the world, in \r\ncooperation with all stakeholders, bearing in mind \r\nthat the three pillars of the work of the United \r\nNations — peace and stability, security and development \r\nand human rights — are interconnected and mutually \r\nreinforcing. In that regard, the human security approach \r\nis also important in the context of Africa.\r\nSince 1993, TICAD has been promoting African \r\ndevelopment by emphasizing both ownership by \r\nAfrican countries and partnership on the part of the \r\ninternational community, including my own country, \r\nJapan. Since the launch of the New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD) in 2001, the TICAD \r\nprocess has been contributing to achieving NEPAD’s \r\npriorities, serving as an important framework for \r\npartnership. With the support of an increasing number \r\nof organizers, including the United Nations, the World \r\nBank, the United Nations Development Programme \r\n(UNDP) and the African Union Commission (AUC), \r\nTICAD has grown into an international forum with the \r\nparticipation of international organizations, regional \r\norganizations, members of civil society, various donors \r\nand Asian countries.\r\nIn 2008, TICAD IV adopted the Yokohama Action \r\nPlan, which included two main commitments: first, that \r\nJapan would double its official development assistance \r\nto Africa to $1.8 billion by 2012; and, secondly, that \r\nit would aim to double its investment in Africa to \r\n$3.4 billion by 2012. Japan has been working steadily \r\nto deliver on those commitments; in fact, it has already \r\nachieved and surpassed its investment commitment, \r\nsince our investments in Africa have in fact tripled \r\nrather than doubled.\r\nLast month, the General Assembly adopted \r\nresolution 66/293 on a monitoring mechanism to review \r\ncommitments made towards Africa’s development, \r\nwhich emphasized the importance of following up on \r\ncommitments made to development in Africa. Through \r\nits TICAD process, Japan has established a mechanism \r\naccording to which we hold annual ministerial follow-\r\nup meetings to closely monitor the progress of the \r\ncommitments made at TICAD IV. This is a pioneering \r\neffort aimed at improving accountability, and we are \r\nready to share our experience of it. \r\nFrom 1 to 3 June 2013, Japan, together with the \r\nUnited Nations, the World Bank, UNDP and the AUC, \r\nwill organize TICAD V in Yokohama, commemorating \r\nthe twentieth anniversary of the TICAD process and, at \r\nthe same time, the fiftieth anniversary of the founding \r\nof the Organization of African Unity. We are now in \r\nthe process of preparing for TICAD V, which includes \r\na senior officials’ meeting in Ouagadougou, Burkina \r\nFaso, from 15 to 17 November and a ministerial \r\npreparatory meeting in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, early \r\nnext year.\r\nAt TICAD V, we hope to strengthen both the \r\nownership of African countries and partnership with \r\ndevelopment partners. We are also considering ways \r\nin which civil society and the private sector, whose \r\ninvolvement is critical to Africa’s long-term self-\r\nsustaining development, can be incorporated into that \r\nprocess. Japan invites the participation of African \r\nHeads of State and cooperation with development \r\npartners, as we have done with all the previous TICAD \r\nmeetings.\r\nLet me conclude my statement by reaffirming \r\nJapan’s unwavering long-term commitment to African \r\ndevelopment.\r\nMr. Jerandi (Tunisia) (spoke in Arabic): At \r\nthe outset, I would like to congratulate Mr. Maged \r\nAbdelaziz on his appointment as Special Adviser on \r\nAfrica. His presence at every occasion when Africa is \r\nbeing discussed is testimony to the Secretary-General’s \r\nserious attention to African affairs.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nI would also like to thank the Secretary-General for \r\nhis reports on the items on today’s agenda (A/67/204 \r\nand A/67/205), which underscore Africa’s efforts to \r\n8 12-55308\r\nA/67/PV.26\r\nare now essential to helping to build development and \r\nlasting peace in Africa.\r\nA number of African countries, such as Tunisia, \r\nEgypt and Libya, have undertaken sweeping political \r\nand economic reforms in the wake of historic revolutions \r\nagainst the decades of dictatorship, corruption and poor \r\ngovernance they have endured. It is now up to the system \r\nof the United Nations, the international community \r\nand all our partners to strengthen their support to \r\nour countries as we seek to make the transition to \r\ndemocracy and national reconstruction.\r\nIn conclusion, based on our profound conviction \r\nthat we have a common destiny and that cooperation \r\nand solidarity among African nations is essential, \r\nTunisia is determined to work with our partners on the \r\ncontinent to make Africa an area of active partnership \r\nand to create the conditions necessary for lasting peace \r\nand development. The priority task of all interested \r\nstakeholders now is to honour their commitments to \r\nAfrica.\r\nMr. Wang Min (China) (spoke in Chinese): Facing \r\nthe impact of the international financial crisis in \r\nrecent years, African countries have made unremitting \r\nindependent efforts to promote the integration process, \r\nstrengthen international cooperation and maintain a \r\nsteady momentum of stability and development and have \r\nmade great strides in implementing the New Partnership \r\nfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD). The establishment \r\nof the NEPAD Planning and Coordinating Agency \r\nhas promoted the implementation of projects in such \r\nkey areas as infrastructure, agriculture, food security \r\nand health care and has enhanced the consistency and \r\ncoordination of the development efforts of African \r\ncountries. We are heartened by the achievements made \r\nby Africa and full of confidence in the continent. \r\nThat being said, one must also acknowledge the \r\nchallenges that Africa faces. The global economy \r\ncontinues to slow down owing to the lingering financial \r\ncrisis. The overall growth rate in Africa is still below the \r\npre-crisis level of 6.5 per cent, which is not sufficient for \r\nsubstantial poverty reduction. Though it has increased \r\nsomewhat since 2004, official development assistance \r\nto Africa is still far from what has been pledged. The \r\ninternational financial crisis and the sovereign debt \r\ncrisis in Europe have resulted in long-term pressure \r\non the sustainability of Africa’s debts, a reduction in \r\nforeign direct investment in Africa and a deterioration \r\nin the trade environment for Africa. Local conflicts \r\nin some parts of Africa persist, and the humanitarian \r\nemerge from underdevelopment, but which also point \r\nout the gaps and constraints that still exist, including in \r\nthe essential area of international support.\r\nToday, the whole world recognizes that Africa has \r\nmade significant progress in various areas in the first \r\n10 years of existence of the ambitious development \r\nprogramme known as the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD). The Secretary-General’s \r\nreport enables us to track that progress through the \r\nvarious components of NEPAD’s Programme for \r\nInfrastructure Development in Africa, in the areas \r\nof energy, transportation, water and sanitation and \r\ninformation and communications technology. \r\nIn the context of the current fragile and uncertain \r\nglobal recovery, the implementation of NEPAD and the \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals on \r\nthe continent require unfaltering determination and \r\nleadership on the part of Africa and its development \r\npartners in order to ensure that commitments are \r\nfulfilled on time if those development goals are to be met. \r\nIn that regard, my delegation stresses the importance \r\nof operationalizing the United Nations monitoring \r\nmechanism so as to ensure sufficient follow-up to all \r\ncommitments relating to Africa’s development.\r\nPromoting lasting peace and development in \r\nAfrica requires sustained, concrete, unified action on \r\nthe part of the international community that addresses \r\nthe root causes of underdevelopment and conflict on \r\nthe continent, with the aim of creating an environment \r\nconducive to investment and sustainable economic \r\ngrowth in Africa. Here I should reiterate Africa’s \r\nconcern about a particular phenomenon that is a major \r\nsource of social tension and poverty in Africa — youth \r\nunemployment. In Africa, where more than 60 per \r\ncent of the population is under the age of 25, youth \r\nunemployment has emerged today as a serious threat \r\nboth to African countries themselves and to the \r\ninternational community, due to the upheavals and \r\nother repercussions it has produced in our societies.\r\nDevelopment partners should therefore redouble \r\ntheir efforts in a holistic approach to helping Africa \r\nresolve the underlying causes of tension on the \r\ncontinent, which, besides unemployment, include food \r\ninsecurity, debt issues, desertification, climate change \r\nand water shortages. Facilitating people’s ability to \r\nmove from place to place, increasing direct foreign \r\ninvestment, strengthening official development aid, \r\nencouraging technology transfer and capacity-building \r\nso as to derive advantage from preferential treatment \r\n12-55308 9\r\nA/67/PV.26\r\nand governance capacity-building. Africa is fully \r\ncapable of controlling its own development agenda. \r\nThe international community should respect Africa’s \r\nrealities and the will of African countries, support their \r\nindependent efforts to handle their own affairs, further \r\nremove conditions attached to assistance and improve \r\nthe predictability and transparency of aid.\r\nIn the six years since the establishment of the new \r\nChina-Africa strategic partnership, China has deepened \r\nits relations with African countries and regional \r\norganizations including the African Union (AU). China \r\nhas rendered active support for Africa’s integration and \r\nhas continued increasing its support for NEPAD. In \r\nthe past three years, China’s total assistance to Africa \r\nhas nearly doubled and is increasingly directed to such \r\nareas as improving people’s lives, poverty reduction \r\nand alleviation, disaster prevention and mitigation and \r\ncapacity-building. We have built new schools, hospitals, \r\nroads, bridges and water-supply projects for Africa. \r\nChina has made good on its commitment to provide \r\n$15 billion in concessional loans to Africa. With \r\nsustained efforts to expand trade with and investment in \r\nAfrica, China has been Africa’s largest trading partner \r\nfor three consecutive years. Africa’s exports to China \r\nhave grown by a large margin and have doubled in the \r\npast three years. China’s direct investment in Africa \r\nhas exceeded $15 billion in cumulative terms, with \r\ninvestment projects covering 50 African countries.\r\nAt the Fifth Ministerial Conference of the Forum \r\non China-Africa Cooperation, held in July in Beijing, \r\nPresident Hu Jintao announced the measures in \r\nseveral priority areas that the Chinese Government \r\nwill take in the next three years to support peace and \r\ndevelopment in Africa. China will provide a $20 billion \r\ncredit line to African countries to assist them in \r\ndeveloping infrastructure, agriculture, manufacturing \r\nand small- and medium-sized enterprises. China will \r\nbuild more agricultural technology demonstration \r\ncentres as needed in order to help African countries \r\nincrease production capacity. China will help African \r\ncountries enhance capacity-building in meteorological \r\ninfrastructure and in forest protection and management. \r\nChina will continue to carry out well-drilling and water-\r\nsupply projects in Africa to provide safe drinking water \r\nto the African people. China will encourage established \r\nChinese companies and financial institutions to take \r\npart in transnational and transregional infrastructure \r\ndevelopment in Africa. China will help African \r\ncountries upgrade customs and commodity inspection \r\ncrisis has aggravated them. Africa, and sub-Saharan \r\nAfrica in particular, is confronted with huge challenges \r\nin achieving the Millennium Development Goals as \r\nscheduled.\r\nIn the second decade of NEPAD, the international \r\ncommunity should continue to increase its attention \r\nand contributions to Africa and should promote greater \r\nprogress in the implementation of NEPAD, so as to \r\npromote stability and prosperity in Africa. In that \r\ncontext, China wishes to put forward the following \r\nsuggestions. \r\nFirst, with regard to strengthening development \r\npartnerships, developed countries should demonstrate \r\ngreater political will and fully honour their aid and \r\ndebt-reduction commitments to Africa at an early date. \r\nThe international community should do its best to \r\nexpand assistance to Africa, increase aid for trade and \r\npromote an early conclusion of the Doha Round of trade \r\nnegotiations, so as to improve the trade environment \r\nfor African countries. Resolution 66/293 should be \r\nfully implemented so as to strengthen the monitoring \r\nmechanism to review commitments pledged towards \r\nAfrica’s development. \r\nIn recent years, South-South cooperation has seen \r\nrapid development, giving a forceful boost to economic \r\nand social development in Africa. We support efforts \r\nto further tap the potential of South-South cooperation \r\nand leverage the advantages of that type of cooperation \r\nin order to contribute more to the implementation of \r\nNEPAD. However, South-South cooperation is not a \r\nsubstitute for, but rather a complement to, North-South \r\ncooperation.\r\nSecondly, with regard to increasing United Nations \r\nsupport for Africa, recent years have seen progress in \r\nthe United Nations regional initiatives to support and \r\nhelp Africa. Priority should continue to be given to \r\nAfrica’s special development needs, so as to ensure \r\nthat the priorities of the United Nations agencies are \r\nconsistent with the priority areas of NEPAD. The \r\nimplementation of the post-2015 development agenda \r\nand the follow-up actions to implement the outcome \r\ndocument of the United Nations Conference on \r\nSustainable Development (resolution 66/288, annex) \r\nshould also give special consideration to Africa’s needs.\r\nThirdly,  with regard to Africa’s ownership of its \r\ndevelopment agenda, African countries have in recent \r\nyears made enormous efforts and obtained significant \r\nresults in economic reforms, conflict resolution \r\n10 12-55308\r\nA/67/PV.26\r\nfacilities to promote intraregional trade facilitation. \r\nMoreover, China will launch an initiative on the China-\r\nAfrica cooperative partnership for peace and security, \r\ndeepen cooperation with the AU and African countries \r\nin the area of peace and security in Africa, provide \r\nfinancial support for the AU peacekeeping missions \r\nin Africa and the development of the African Standby \r\nForce, and train more officials in peace and security \r\naffairs and peacekeepers for the AU.\r\nCooperation between China and Africa is being \r\ncarried out in the context of the fact that the two sides face \r\nsimilar circumstances and share the common mission \r\nof development. It is therefore highly constructive and \r\npromising. China attaches no political strings to its \r\naid for Africa. China and Africa have drawn on each \r\nother’s strengths in their cooperation with a view to \r\nsharing in the achievement of development, and such \r\ncooperation has provided opportunities for both sides. \r\nChina will give genuine support to African countries \r\nas they independently choose their path to development \r\nand will genuinely help African countries strengthen \r\ntheir capacity for self-development. China will forever \r\nbe a good friend, good partner and good brother of \r\nthe African people. Guided by an open and inclusive \r\napproach, China will work with other countries and \r\ninternational organizations to help promote development \r\nand prosperity and uphold peace and stability in Africa.\r\nMr. Diallo (Senegal) (spoke in French): I have \r\nnot had the opportunity to formally congratulate you, \r\nAmbassador Balé, on the election of your country as a \r\nmember of the Bureau of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-seventh session. It is with great pleasure that I see \r\nyou, Sir, presiding over the 26th plenary meeting of the \r\nAssembly. I would also like to welcome our friends, \r\nMr. Maged A. Abdelaziz, Under-Secretary-General \r\nand Special Adviser on Africa, and Dr. Ibrahim Assane \r\nMayaki, Chief Executive Officer of the Planning and \r\nCoordinating Agency of the New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD). \r\nSenegal is gratifi ed by the convening of this important \r\ndebate on NEPAD. This ambitious programme aims to \r\nrelease Africa from the grip of underdevelopment. I \r\nwould like to convey our wholehearted appreciation to \r\nthe Secretary-General who has just presented his high-\r\nquality reports (A/67/204 and A/67/205), with their \r\nrelevant and constructive recommendations for the \r\nsocioeconomic reconstruction of the African continent. \r\nThe continental initiative of NEPAD is based on an \r\nindigenous culture of development. At the same time, \r\nit embodies a new approach to the nature and direction \r\nof the best type of partnership that Africa should \r\nhave with the rest of the world. The implementation \r\nof this programme is therefore of great interest to \r\nAfrica, which bears the primary responsibility for its \r\nown development. But it also demands that concrete \r\nactions be undertaken by the rest of the international \r\ncommunity. \r\nAs is so well underscored by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in his report, it is evident today that over \r\nthe first 11 years of existence of NEPAD, Africa \r\nhas made significant progress in a number of areas, \r\nnamely in terms of extinguishing hotbeds of tension, \r\nthe return of economic growth, good governance \r\nand democracy, as well as the promotion of human \r\nrights and the empowerment of women. Let us agree, \r\nhowever, that despite the encouraging signs referred \r\nto by the Secretary-General, progress remains slow, \r\nand significant difficulties continue to cast a shadow \r\nover the future of our continent. Indeed, in many other \r\nareas the picture is grim, exacerbated by the recent \r\neconomic, food, energy and environmental crises, \r\nwhose inextricable difficulties have held Africa back, \r\nplacing it at a crossroads in its quest for development. \r\nThe high rate of poverty, HIV/AIDS infections, \r\nmalaria, tuberculosis and child mortality are even \r\nmore alarming challenges. Despite satisfactory growth \r\nrates, endemic poverty continues to weigh heavily \r\non Africa. To these recurring problems are added the \r\nfamiliar litany of other factors that continue to disrupt \r\nthe international debate on development, including \r\nrising levels of famine and unemployment; agricultural \r\nsubsidies, which significantly impede free trade; \r\nan intolerable debt burden; the energy crisis with its \r\ncollateral damage, such as untimely and uncontrolled \r\nf luctuations in the price of oil. At the same time, the \r\ngrowth of investments remains at the very heart of \r\nthe continent’s concerns as a major component of the \r\nstrategy aimed at stimulating sustained economic \r\ngrowth and establishing a genuine competitive \r\neconomy. \r\nClearly, Africa will find it difficult to develop unless \r\nan end is put to those countless constraints. Along the \r\nsame lines, serious threats weigh on the stability of a \r\ncontinent increasingly beset by international terrorism, \r\nreligious fundamentalism and the blind fanaticism of \r\nuncontrolled groups. In that regard, what is needed is \r\n12-55308 11\r\nA/67/PV.26\r\nin socioeconomic development in the region over \r\nthe past decade. However, Africa continues to face a \r\nnumber of crises, from political conflict to economic \r\nslowdown, from terrorist and criminal activities to \r\ndrought and famine. Together the African countries \r\nand the international community must ensure that such \r\nchallenges will not reverse the success and progress \r\nachieved to date.\r\nIt is the urgent task of the international community \r\nto support African countries in enhancing their \r\nprospects of attaining the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs). That can be achieved only through \r\nthe successful implementation of the NEPAD sectoral \r\npriorities aimed at promoting equitable economic \r\ngrowth that will allow Africa to be better integrated \r\ninto the global economy. It must also be our priority \r\nto strengthen Africa’s capacity to deal with persistent \r\nand emerging global challenges, be they food security, \r\nclimate change, disasters or pandemics.\r\nThailand, while pursuing people-centred \r\ndevelopment, believes that economic growth and \r\nsustainable development can be achieved only through \r\nthe development of human capital. Therefore, our \r\ndevelopment partnerships with African countries have \r\nfocused primarily on human resource development and \r\ncapacity-building in various fields, through bilateral, \r\ntrilateral and multilateral cooperation. We hope that \r\nThailand’s experience and expertise in agriculture, \r\npublic health and education will be of value to Africa.\r\nA prerequisite for sustainable development is a \r\nhealthy population. Thailand supports Africa’s efforts \r\nin attaining the MDGs by 2015, including combating \r\nHIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and other diseases. \r\nThailand supported and co-sponsored resolution \r\n62/180, “2001-2010: Decade to Roll Back Malaria in \r\nDeveloping Countries, Particularly in Africa”, with \r\nspecial emphasis on universal and equitable access to \r\ntreatment and medication without discrimination. We \r\nalso supported the establishment of the Global Fund \r\nto Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, dedicated to \r\nhelping developing countries stamp out those deadly \r\nscourges.\r\nAs Thailand has learned from hard experience, \r\nthere is no one-size-fits-all solution, especially when it \r\ncomes to development. We have therefore implemented \r\ndevelopment programmes tailored specifically to \r\nindividual country needs in Burundi, Madagascar, \r\nMozambique, Senegal and the Sudan. Moreover, we \r\nthe firm will of the international community to find \r\nlasting solutions to the conflicts, which cripple and \r\nslow efforts for Africa’s development. \r\nIt is time to welcome resolution 2071 (2012), \r\nadopted on 12 October by the Security Council, in \r\nwhich the Council encouraged Africa to assume its \r\nresponsibilities and declared its willingness to look \r\nfurther into the request of the Economic Community \r\nof West African States (ECOWAS) for intervention to \r\nremedy the alarming situation in Mali. Senegal firmly \r\ncondemns the occupation of half of Mali’s territory, \r\nand we would like to reaffirm our ongoing support for \r\nthat brotherly country in this very sensitive phase of \r\nthe reconquest of its territorial integrity and its march \r\ntowards prosperity,  understanding and progress. While \r\ncompletely rejecting any partitioning of that country, \r\nSenegal would like to voice its support for the peace \r\nplan adopted by ECOWAS. We commit ourself to \r\nensuring the plan’s full success. \r\nMy country takes the same position with regard \r\nto the need for solidarity to restore stability in Libya, \r\nSomalia, Darfur and Guinea-Bissau. Indeed, it is by \r\nfulfilling its promises and financing efforts that the \r\ninternational community will be able to truly help \r\nAfrica to free itself from the economic, financial, \r\nenvironmental, energy and food crises. Moreover, \r\nAfrica requires a genuine, sincere, fair and equitable \r\npartnership to eventually become the continent to bring \r\nabout global growth, as is its vocation.\r\nMr. Sinhaseni (Thailand): At the outset, Thailand \r\ncommends the Secretary-General for his comprehensive \r\nreport, contained in document A/67/204, which will \r\nfacilitate the implementation of the New Partnership \r\nfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD).\r\nPeace and development in Africa matter not only \r\nto our African brothers and sisters, but to all of us. \r\nAfrica is home to over a quarter of the United Nations \r\nfamily of nations, with a combined population of \r\nover 1 billion, or one sixth of the world’s population. \r\nIt is therefore our shared responsibility to promote \r\nstability and sustainable development in Africa. As the \r\nSecretary-General rightly states in his report, “African \r\ncountries and the international community ... should \r\nstrengthen their partnership for development on the \r\nbasis of mutual responsibility and accountability” \r\n(A/67/204, summary).\r\nNEPAD, along with other regional initiatives, has \r\nsignificantly contributed to the remarkable progress \r\n12 12-55308\r\nA/67/PV.26\r\nwe will continue to do our part to strengthen the global \r\npartnership for development. We look forward to \r\nsharing more of our experiences and best practices in \r\nvarious areas of development with our African brothers \r\nand sisters, so that our continents, while geographically \r\nfar apart, may become ever closer through cooperation.\r\nMr. Núñez Mosquera (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nCuba attaches the highest importance to the theme \r\nof today’s debate. Africa, a vastly rich continent, \r\ncontinues to face obstacles to development that are \r\nunacceptable. Rhetorical proclamations of support for \r\nthe continent are followed by the sad reality that, to \r\ntake just one example, African countries must waste \r\nresources paying five times in external debt what they \r\ncan on social development programmes. Powerful \r\nmultinational corporations fight for control of Africa’s \r\nmineral resources, while powerful countries, with a \r\nfew exceptions, break their already modest promises \r\nof official aid and resolutely persist in unjust trade \r\npractices that block the development of African nations. \r\nTo deal with Africa’s problems we need to shed the \r\nmindset of profit at all costs that sustains the unjust \r\nglobal economic system the world is subject to. Cuba \r\nwill continue to support the African Union and all \r\nmechanisms of regional cooperation in their efforts \r\nto find African solutions to African challenges and \r\nwill continue to call for honouring the principles of \r\nsovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs \r\nof African countries. We hope that in debating African \r\nissues the General Assembly will tackle the real core \r\ncauses of the continent’s challenges, which are the \r\nresult of decades of colonial plundering and neoliberal \r\nmeasures that only deepen economic disadvantage, even \r\nbankrupting many African countries. In that vein, we \r\nreiterate our support for resolution 66/293, which calls \r\nfor a monitoring mechanism to review commitments \r\nmade towards Africa’s development. \r\nThe quest for independence and our African heritage \r\nare indissolubly woven into the formation of the Cuban \r\nnation and our national identity. We are proud to say \r\nthat the Cuban people are direct inheritors of Africa’s \r\nvalour, bravery and culture of resistance, which have \r\nbattled obstacles heroically for centuries. During the \r\ncolonial period, more than 1.5 million slaves, primarily \r\nfrom sub-Saharan Africa, were transported to Cuba to \r\ndo forced labour on sugar-cane plantations and other \r\nsuch work. \r\nhave also established a partnership with Lesotho in \r\nsetting up an agricultural development and sufficiency \r\neconomy project, in line with the sufficiency economy \r\nphilosophy of His Majesty the King of Thailand, which \r\nvalues low-cost, sustainable solutions adapted to each \r\nsituation. We will continue our support in a spirit of \r\npartnership through South-South cooperation as well \r\nas triangular cooperation with United Nations agencies \r\nsuch as the United Nations Development Programme \r\nand the United Nations Conference on Trade and \r\nDevelopment through the International Trade and \r\nDevelopment Centre based in Bangkok.\r\nThailand believes that sustainable development \r\ncan never be achieved without durable peace and \r\nsecurity. As emphasized by my Prime Minister in the \r\ngeneral debate last month (see A/67/PV.14), innovative \r\nsolutions and new thinking are necessary. According to \r\nthe Secretary-General’s report (A/67/205), the past year \r\nwitnessed zero growth in North Africa due to political \r\nunrest. Conflicts have also led to large numbers of \r\nrefugees and the expansion of transnational criminal \r\nnetworks. In addressing those issues, the United \r\nNations has played a crucial and commendable role.\r\nFor our part, Thailand has contributed to collective \r\nefforts on peace and security through our participation \r\nin the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation \r\nin Darfur. Counter-piracy task groups in the Gulf of \r\nAden are another area where we have contributed, by \r\nproviding naval patrol vessels. We will continue to \r\nwork with Africa and the international community in a \r\nspirit of solidarity to maintain peace and security.\r\nThailand agrees with the Secretary-General, \r\nwho in the same report states that it is essential to \r\nunderstand and address the needs of diverse groups. \r\nDiversity, if not well managed, can become a source \r\nof conflict and instability, and ultimately hinder \r\ndevelopment. When managed well, however, unity in \r\ndiversity can be a powerful source of strength, as we \r\nin the countries of the Association of Southeast Asian \r\nNations have learned. Thailand commends the leading \r\nrole of the African Union in contributing similarly to \r\nregional socioeconomic development, particularly in \r\nthe face of the diverse array of challenges that confront \r\nthe continent.\r\nFinally, as a developing country that has undergone \r\ndecades of trial and error, Thailand now places \r\nsustainable development at the heart of its national \r\nagenda. As a member of the international community, \r\n12-55308 13\r\nA/67/PV.26\r\nThis year the debate on Africa comes at a time \r\nmarked by the persisting economic and financial crisis, \r\nwhose consequences have been felt more intensely in \r\nAfrica than elsewhere. Despite a certain amount of \r\npositive news about the revival of economic growth, it is \r\nimportant that we take note of the problems, challenges \r\nand issues that African countries are dealing with. \r\nWe should also note the policies implemented within \r\nthe framework of NEPAD, whose primary goal is to \r\nhelp build a major pole of growth in line with Africa’s \r\nlegitimate aspirations.\r\nIn dedicating NEPAD as a mechanism that provides \r\na frame of reference for establishing partnerships \r\nbetween Africa and the rest of the world, the international \r\ncommunity has chosen a new approach to cooperation \r\nand development with Africa. The development path \r\nfor Africa outlined by NEPAD is critical, thanks to \r\nthe free rein it gives to the principles of ownership and \r\npartnership that are at the heart of this African initiative. \r\nThe implementation of NEPAD remains based on clear \r\nleadership that aims to transform the ideals and vision \r\nof NEPAD’s founders into political action and realities, \r\nwith the ultimate objective being the achievement of \r\ngood political and economic governance, through \r\nstrengthened democracy and the rule of law but also \r\nthrough economic and social development.\r\nThe recent creation of the NEPAD Planning and \r\nCoordination Agency, led by Mr. Mayaki, and its \r\nintegration into the African Union’s structure, marks \r\na qualitative shift that enables NEPAD to implement \r\nregional and continent-wide structural projects and \r\nprogrammes. Besides imparting momentum to the \r\nimplementation of such projects and programmes, the \r\nAgency is in a position to encourage our development \r\npartners to respect their commitment to supporting \r\nthe implementation of NEPAD. In that context, \r\nAlgeria welcomes the General Assembly’s adoption \r\nof resolution 66/293, concerning the establishment of \r\na mechanism to monitor commitments made towards \r\nAfrica’s development. That new biennial mechanism \r\nshould provide a framework capable of evaluating the \r\nfulfilment of commitments undertaken by various \r\nparties in order to help promote cooperation and \r\npartnership.\r\nAware of how vital good political governance is to the \r\ncontinent’s economic development, NEPAD introduced \r\ninto its strategy the African Peer Review Mechanism, \r\na voluntary tool for promoting and strengthening the \r\nvalues of democracy and respect for the rule of law, and \r\nThe Cuban Revolution’s strong internationalist \r\nposition has meant that we have always stood by Africa, \r\nfrom our unconditional support for the anticolonial wars \r\nof independence to our many and various cooperative \r\nprojects promoting the continent’s economic and social \r\ndevelopment. More than 381,000 Cuban soldiers and \r\nofficers have fought self lessly to defend the integrity \r\nand sovereignty of our brotherly African countries for \r\nalmost three decades. As we have said before, the only \r\nthings we have taken away from Africa are the remains \r\nof our fallen heroes and pride in the knowledge of a \r\nduty honourably fulfilled.\r\nIn the context of South-South cooperation, \r\nour country continues to bring its human capital \r\nand experience to the work of collaboration with \r\nthe countries of Africa. To mention only the most \r\nsignificant examples, there are more than 2,600 \r\nAfricans pursuing professional studies on scholarships \r\nat Cuban universities, including those specializing \r\nin the medical sciences. More than 5,000 Cubans \r\nare providing services in 34 African nations with \r\nthe aim of encouraging development in such diverse \r\nareas as public health, education, agriculture, sport, \r\nconstruction and more. And more than 27,000 African \r\npatients have had their eyesight restored through our \r\nOperation Miracle programme.\r\nFor its part, Africa has always stood by Cuba. \r\nOver the more than 50 years of the economic, trade \r\nand financial blockade imposed on my country, the \r\nGovernments and peoples of Africa have closed ranks \r\non 20 occasions to go before the General Assembly to \r\ncall for the right of the Cuban people to determine their \r\nown destiny.\r\nCuba is an advocate for a fairer and more equitable \r\ninternational order. We seek no favours for Africa, only \r\nequality of opportunity. That is all that is needed for \r\nAfrica and other developing countries to tackle, without \r\ngrotesque obstacles, the challenges of working for the \r\nwell-being of our peoples.\r\nMr. Benmehidi (Algeria) (spoke in French): At the \r\noutset, I would like to welcome Mr. Ibrahim Assane \r\nMayaki, Chief Executive Officer of the Planning \r\nand Coordinating Agency of the New Partnership \r\nfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD), and to take the \r\nopportunity to once more congratulate Mr. Maged \r\nAbdelaziz on his appointment as Special Adviser of the \r\nSecretary-General on Africa.\r\n14 12-55308\r\nA/67/PV.26\r\nimpact, including achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and improving Africa’s ability to \r\nattract intra-African and international investment, this \r\nprogramme will enable us to close a backwardness \r\ngap that costs Africa two percentage points of growth \r\nannually.\r\nWe are compelled to conclude that the international \r\ncommunity’s support remains inadequate to the \r\nchallenges that Africa is facing. We call on it to adopt \r\nspecific measures designed to boost the economies \r\nof developing countries, particularly those in Africa, \r\nsuch as facilitating access to developed countries’ \r\nmarkets and respecting official development assistance \r\ncommitments. Beyond this, greater participation on \r\nAfrica’s part in global economic decision-making \r\nwould help considerably to reduce the continent’s \r\nmarginalization.\r\nTo conclude, Algeria wishes to convey its gratitude \r\nfor the contributions and commitments of a number \r\nof our partners, including the Group of 77 and China, \r\nwhich have enabled NEPAD to make a two-pronged \r\nmove forward in the fields of good governance and \r\nsustainable development.\r\nMr. Chinyonga (Zambia): At the outset, I wish \r\nto align myself with the statement made by the \r\nrepresentative of Cameroon on behalf of the Group of \r\nAfrican States (see A/67/PV.25).\r\nI wish to thank the Secretary-General for his \r\ninformative reports on the topics under consideration \r\ntoday (A/67/204 and A/67/205). The Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report on the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) brings out the issues, inter alia, \r\nof infrastructure development, agriculture, information \r\nand communications technology, especially telephone \r\ntechnology, governance and the African Peer Review \r\nMechanism, and the commitment to gender equality in \r\nAfrica.\r\nLet me commend the Office of the Special Adviser \r\non Africa, the NEPAD Planning and Coordinating \r\nAgency and the United Nations Economic Commission \r\nfor Africa for the NEPAD Africa Week that runs from \r\n15 to 19 October here in New York. The events that have \r\nbeen produced for the week, including today’s plenary \r\nmeeting, are both inspirational and reinvigorating.\r\nAll the issues raised in the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral have been identified before, but what is \r\nimportant and noteworthy is that African nations have \r\ntaken a leadership role in charting the course of their \r\nto consolidate social peace and sustainable growth. The \r\nMechanism, which will celebrate its tenth anniversary \r\nin 2013, has continued to strengthen its position as a \r\ntool for promoting good governance in Africa, with \r\nmore than 30 countries acceding to it, 14 of which have \r\nconducted self-assessment tests.\r\nFor its part, in 2012 Algeria, a founding member of \r\nthe Mechanism, submitted its second-phase report on \r\nthe implementation of its national action programme on \r\ngovernance. That report testifies to our determination \r\nand continuing willingness to strengthen civil society’s \r\nparticipation in achieving a sustainable development \r\nthat reflects current generations’ aspirations while \r\nsafeguarding those of their descendants. This report \r\non the implementation of the action programme was \r\nprepared at a time when Algeria was committing to a \r\nnew series of political, economic and social reforms, \r\nproclaimed by the President of the Republic in April \r\n2011.\r\nDuring the next decade, efforts undertaken in \r\nthe framework of NEPAD will focus on harmonizing \r\nsectoral policies and promoting common economic \r\npolicies on a regional and continental scale. Key sectors, \r\nsuch as agriculture, the environment, information and \r\ncommunications technologies and, in particular, basic \r\ninfrastructure, will now benefit from greater attention.\r\nAgriculture occupies a major position in Africa’s \r\ndevelopment. Indeed, with the goal of guaranteeing \r\nfood security, African countries have made significant \r\nprogress, aiming to allocate 10 per cent of national \r\nbudgets to agricultural development and to exceed the \r\ngoal of a 6 per cent growth rate for the agricultural \r\nsector. Thirty countries are now committed to this \r\nprogramme and 21 have devised a national investment \r\nplan for agriculture.\r\nFurthermore, Africa understands clearly that the \r\nfoundation of its integration process is the development \r\nof subregional and regional infrastructure. The \r\ngrowing interest of African leaders in developing \r\nand building up the central sector of infrastructure is \r\nclearly a result of the absolute priority accorded it in \r\nthe various plans and programmes initiated within the \r\nAfrican Union-NEPAD framework. That is why Algeria \r\nwelcomes the adoption in January by Africa’s Heads of \r\nState of the Programme for Infrastructure Development \r\nin Africa, embracing four areas for action at the \r\nregional and continental levels: energy, transborder \r\nwater resources, transportation and information and \r\ncommunications technologies. Besides its social \r\n12-55308 15\r\nA/67/PV.26\r\nZambia is committed to the promotion and protection \r\nof the rights of women in order to reduce inequalities. \r\nIn that regard, the Government has enacted a number \r\nof laws, such as the Anti-Gender-Based-Violence Act \r\nand the Anti-Human-Trafficking Act. It has further \r\nestablished a fully f ledged Ministry of Gender and \r\nChild Development to ensure the advancement and \r\nequality of women. \r\nIn line with the mandate of NEPAD, Zambia \r\ncalls on the NEPAD Agency to continue promoting \r\nagriculture and food security, regional integration \r\nand infrastructure development, human development \r\nand other cross-cutting issues such as gender and \r\ninformation and communications technologies.\r\nAs to the issue of rolling back malaria in developing \r\ncountries, the Government is working around the clock \r\nto ensure that Zambia achieves complete eradication of \r\nmalaria by 2030.  Working with different partners, such \r\nas the World Health Organization, the African Leaders \r\nMalaria Alliance and the United States President’s \r\nMalaria Initiative, inter alia, tangible gains in the \r\nfight against that endemic disease have been made. I \r\nam happy to note that high-impact interventions have \r\nresulted in the reduction of malaria deaths of persons \r\nof all ages by 66 per cent, thereby surpassing the 2010 \r\nRoll Back Malaria target by more than 50 per cent.\r\nLastly, positive trends have also been observed in \r\ncombating HIV/AIDS. One of our major challenges \r\ncontinues to be resource availability to fight the \r\nepidemic in a changing world economy amid reduced \r\nfinancial contributions from cooperating partners. For \r\nits part, the Government of Zambia, in its 2013 national \r\nbudget released last week, has allocated an amount \r\nrepresenting 11.3 per cent of the total national budget \r\ntowards the health sector, which translates to a 40 per \r\ncent increase over last year’s allocation. The HIV/AIDS \r\ncomponent will benefit from the increased allocation, \r\nalbeit at the expense of other equally essential \r\nrequirements. In that regard, the continued need for \r\nUnited Nations and other international collaboration \r\ncannot be overemphasized.\r\nI therefore wish to end by assuring the Assembly \r\nof Zambia’s undiminished commitment to these \r\nimportant developmental programmes, particularly for \r\nthe African continent.\r\nMs. Anderson (Ireland): I wish to thank the \r\nSecretary-General for the excellent reports that inform \r\ntoday’s debate (A/67/204 and A/67/205). There are \r\ndevelopment, especially in infrastructure development. \r\nMy own country, Zambia, has identified infrastructure \r\ndevelopment as a priority area in its sixth national \r\ndevelopment plan, which runs from 2011 to 2015, and \r\nis encouraging the public-private partnership concept \r\nto accelerate infrastructure development, especially for \r\nroads. The other priority area is human development, \r\nwhich is both a primary agent and a beneficiary of \r\ndevelopment. Zambia aims to develop skills that will \r\nmatch the demands of the labour market.\r\nIn terms of agriculture, Zambia has in recent years \r\nmade great strides and produced bumper harvests in \r\ngrain production, especially maize, which is the staple \r\nfood crop. However, the gains in agricultural production \r\nhave yet to be translated into poverty reduction owing \r\nto a number of challenges, including inadequate storage \r\ncapacity and limited road infrastructure between rural \r\nand urban centres, which create difficulties for crop \r\nmarketing and the distribution of agricultural inputs.\r\nAgriculture in Zambia is mostly rain-fed, which \r\nmakes it vulnerable to the effects of climate change. In \r\ndealing with that challenge, the Government is investing \r\nin drought-resistant crops, irrigation, early warning \r\nsystems and other adaptation measures. Furthermore, \r\nthe Government is promoting value addition in \r\nthe agriculture sector by providing incentives for \r\nagroprocessing industries. \r\nZambia sees the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture \r\nDevelopment Programme as providing an opportunity \r\nto develop the agriculture sector. We are also committed \r\nto allocating the agreed minimum required resources of \r\n10 per cent of the national budget to agriculture. \r\nIn line with the report of the Secretary-General, \r\nmajor strides have been made in information and \r\ncommunications technology, especially in the use \r\nof mobile telephones. The Government has created \r\nan environment conducive for development in that \r\nsubsector, with positive response from the private \r\nsector. That has, among other things, improved \r\ntelecommunication even in rural areas. However, high \r\ncharges still exist for calls within Zambia and the \r\nregion.\r\nI am delighted to state that, in terms of governance, \r\nZambia remains committed to promoting democracy, \r\nand we are proud to state that the country has, since the \r\n1990s, experienced a peaceful transition of power from \r\na ruling party to an opposition party through elections \r\non two occasions, notably in 1991 and 2011.\r\n16 12-55308\r\nA/67/PV.26\r\nundoubtedly some very positive elements in the reports, \r\nwhich testify to the growth, progress and resilience we \r\nare witnessing in Africa. At the same time, there is \r\nmuch that is sobering. The bottom line is bluntly stated: \r\n“[I]ts improved performance notwithstanding, \r\nAfrica’s growth is considerably below the \r\npre-crisis level … and inadequate to reduce poverty \r\nsignificantly”(A/67/204, para. 47).\r\nIreland is deeply engaged with the unfolding \r\nAfrican story. From the very beginning, the primary \r\nfocus of Irish Aid, Ireland’s overseas development \r\nprogramme, has been on Africa. The large majority of \r\nour aid partners are in Africa, and it is in Africa that \r\nwe have always concentrated the bulk, that is, 80 per \r\ncent, of our resources. Recognizing the extent and pace \r\nof change in Africa, the Irish Government launched \r\nan updated Africa strategy last year. The new strategy \r\ndeepens and develops our approach to date, while also \r\nunderlining the importance of the growing trade and \r\ninvestment links.\r\nGiven the time constraints of today’s debate, I \r\nintend to focus on just a couple of areas covered in the \r\nreports before us. Earlier, the speaker for the European \r\nUnion commented on the Roll Back Malaria initiative. \r\nI would simply note the enormous progress made over \r\nthe past decade, to the point that malaria is now on the \r\nretreat across the globe. None of that would have been \r\npossible without a 15-fold increase in international \r\nfunding for malaria control  and without creating new \r\nways of doing business.  Ireland was a founder member \r\nof the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and \r\nMalaria and has remained hugely committed over the \r\npast decade; our contributions to the Fund to date have \r\ntotalled almost $175 million.\r\nThe report before us on the New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD), in both its analysis and \r\nits recommendations, fully recognizes the importance \r\nof agriculture and of food and nutrition security to \r\nAfrica’s development. That resonates very strongly with \r\nIreland’s official development assistance priorities. \r\nIn 2008, we set ourselves a target of allocating 20 per \r\ncent of our overseas development programme to hunger \r\neradication. Earlier this year, we were able to announce \r\nthat the target had been met.\r\nLet me mention a few examples in Africa. We are very \r\nsupportive of the Comprehensive Africa Agricultural \r\nDevelopment Programme (CAADP) and support and \r\nprovide funding in several of our partner countries for \r\nthe CAADP compacts. We are also founding members \r\nof the Scaling Up Nutrition movement, which has many \r\nAfrican members. And in 2011, the Irish Government \r\nlaunched the Africa Agri-Food Development Fund to \r\nprovide financial support for initiatives that help to \r\nbuild capacity in agribusiness in Africa. The Fund is \r\nbeing piloted initially in Tanzania and Kenya.\r\nThe report is clear as to the challenges to \r\nstrengthening gender equality and women’s \r\nempowerment in Africa. I would like in particular today \r\nto address those challenges in a rural and agricultural \r\ncontext. We all know that women experience a number \r\nof disadvantages in agriculture. They perform a \r\ndisproportionate amount of farm labour, have weaker \r\nland rights and have poorer access to improved farm \r\ninputs, extension services and financial services. Yet we \r\nknow that if given equal rights, access to land and other \r\ncritical inputs and an equal say in decision-making, \r\nwomen can be powerful agents of change. Engaging \r\nand empowering women farmers must be a cornerstone \r\nof any strategy to boost agricultural productivity. \r\nIn all of Ireland’s engagement in Africa, we \r\nprioritize support for women’s land rights, access to \r\ncredit and improved farm inputs. We support efforts \r\nto change attitudes towards men’s and women’s \r\nagricultural workloads. We also emphasize gender-\r\nspecific indicators and gender-disaggregated data in \r\nagricultural projects. The landmark decision taken last \r\nweek by the High Court in Botswana will hopefully \r\nhave reverberations across the continent in terms of \r\nboosting women’s property rights.\r\nThe African Peer Review Mechanism is a \r\nvery welcome flagship programme of NEPAD. To \r\nensure follow-up and effective accountability, it is \r\nparticularly important that the country action plans \r\nfeed into the national mechanisms for planning and \r\nresource allocation, rather than remaining as stand-\r\nalone documents. Ireland has been active in our \r\npartner countries for many years in supporting better \r\ngovernance through providing assistance to Government \r\nministries and local authorities, parliaments, human \r\nrights commissions and other oversight institutions \r\nfor institution-building. We also help support good \r\ngovernance through civil society organizations.\r\nImproving the quality of financial management \r\nsystems remains a major challenge. To support that, we \r\nfund a number of initiatives, such as the African Tax \r\nAdministration Forum, which helps build the capacity \r\nto improve tax collection systems. Progress is being \r\n12-55308 17\r\nA/67/PV.26\r\nmade, as the report states, with revenue collection \r\nhaving tripled since 2002.\r\nManagement of diversity is rightly seen as a good \r\ngovernance issue. The Secretary-General’s report \r\nbefore us cogently addresses what he describes as one \r\nof the most pressing issues in Africa: the management \r\nof diversity. It is a challenge that is by no means \r\nconfined to Africa. We in Ireland have experienced on \r\nour own island the tensions and scars that history leaves \r\nbehind — the pain of people who believe themselves to \r\nbe on the wrong side of a border. We know how difficult \r\nit is to build the approaches and institutions that can \r\naccommodate differing identities and aspirations.\r\nThe Secretary-General, in paragraph 97 of his report, \r\ncalls for support to national processes and policies that \r\npromote inclusive and participatory political systems, \r\nequitable representation of minorities, and institutions \r\nthat address economic and political inequalities. The \r\nGood Friday Agreement of 1996 — an elaborate set of \r\narrangements that sought to establish parity of esteem \r\nand equal treatment for both communities in Northern \r\nIreland — is the outcome of just such a process. \r\nKnowing the long and tortuous road that led to the \r\nGood Friday Agreement, we wholeheartedly endorse \r\nthe Secretary-General’s call and stand ready to offer \r\nany practical help we can. \r\nThe impact of the global financial crisis on aid \r\nbudgets worldwide is clearly a matter of deep concern. \r\nFor our part, Ireland is committed to maintaining our \r\ndevelopment programme and to reaching the target of \r\n0.7 per cent gross national income. We are currently \r\ncontributing in excess of 0.5 per cent, and, despite the \r\ncurrent period of austerity in Ireland, which has required \r\nmajor cutbacks in domestic programmes, we will move \r\nresolutely ahead towards the 0.7 per cent target. As \r\nmentioned earlier, the large bulk of our resources, \r\nclose to 80 per cent, are devoted to Africa — more than \r\ntwice the 37 per cent share of the total Organization \r\nfor Economic Cooperation and Development global aid \r\nallocation that goes to Africa.\r\nThe African Union summit in January this year, \r\nwith its theme of boosting intra-African trade, was all \r\nabout a new African focus and confidence. Ireland’s \r\nAfrica strategy fully recognizes that new focus; we are \r\nkeen to promote stronger regional integration towards \r\nincreased intra-African trade, to provide technical \r\nassistance to enhance governmental capacity and \r\nindustrial development planning, and to promote new \r\nopportunities for business relations. Next week, on \r\n22 October, we will be hosting in Dublin the second \r\nAfrica-Ireland Economic Forum, a strong practical \r\ndemonstration of our commitment to expanding our \r\nbusiness engagement with Africa.\r\nTo conclude, on a personal note, I found it \r\nexhilarating to attend the African Union summit in \r\nAddis Ababa earlier this year. The continent is clearly \r\nand palpably on the move, and it is particularly gratifying \r\nto see African women taking their rightful place in the \r\nleadership of that move. Without overlooking any of \r\nthe sobering realities, or minimizing the difficulties \r\nthat lie ahead, it is clear that a new African narrative is \r\nemerging, and we in the United Nations are challenged \r\nto play our full part in that exciting new narrative.\r\nMr. Kandangha-Bariki (Togo) (spoke in French): \r\nAllow me to begin by extending my wholehearted \r\nthanks to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his \r\nattention to agenda item 13, “2001-2010: Decade to Roll \r\nBack Malaria in Developing Countries, Particularly \r\nin Africa”. I would also like to extend my warmest \r\ncongratulations to Mr. Vuk Jeremić, President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-seventh session, on his \r\nelection and on the leadership with which he is guiding \r\nour work.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the selection of malaria as \r\na topic of our debate today. We endorse the statement \r\nmade by Cameroon on behalf of the African Group and \r\nby Algeria on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. \r\nDespite the tireless efforts of countries located in areas \r\nexposed to malaria, the disease remains the primary \r\ncause of mortality and morbidity. Given the endemic \r\nnature of the disease, only a collective political \r\ncommitment, together with sufficient resources, \r\nwidespread understanding of the problem and the \r\nexistence of appropriate health-care services will help \r\nto eradicate, or at least considerably reduce, the tragedy \r\nof malaria. \r\nIn Togo, malaria is the primary public health \r\nproblem. The disease is endemic, ravaging the entire \r\nterritory all year long, with new outbreaks during the \r\nrainy season. According to national health statistics, \r\nmalaria represents 38.9 per cent of clinic consultations \r\nand 21.9 per cent of hospitalizations.  Malaria killed \r\nmore than 1,314 people in Togo in 2011, and we had \r\n506,000 cases recorded in public clinics. Children \r\nunder 5 years of age and pregnant women are the most \r\nvulnerable.\r\n18 12-55308\r\nA/67/PV.26\r\n(MDGs), to which Togo is fully committed. My country \r\nwelcomes the support of our bilateral and multilateral \r\npartners in combating malaria. We thank them for their \r\nwise counsel and technical and financial support.\r\nIn order to provide a more durable and effective \r\nresponse capable of meeting the challenges and our \r\ncollective ambition, we must take the measures needed \r\nto effectively manage the recruitment and training of \r\nqualified health personnel at all levels in order to meet \r\nour technical and operational needs. In that context, \r\nTogo reiterates its commitment to our people’s health. \r\nTo the best of our ability, we will increase earmarked \r\nresources to combat that illness and create appropriate \r\nconditions to effectively cooperate with the private \r\nsector and improve high-quality anti-malarial services. \r\nThat is why my country has taken the necessary \r\nsteps over time to provide an increased budget for \r\nthe anti-malaria campaign. But those efforts must be \r\nbolstered by considerable international aid so that we \r\ncan meet our objectives for the period 2012-2015.\r\nMr. Tin (Myanmar): At the outset, my delegation \r\nwould like to express our sincere thanks to the \r\nSecretary-General for his insight and his comprehensive \r\nreports (A/67/204 and A/67/205) on the important \r\nagenda items before us today. It has been over one \r\ndecade since the launching of the New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD) as a collective vision \r\nand a strategic socioeconomic development framework \r\nfor Africa, aimed at bringing about sustained and \r\nequitable economic growth for Africa and its improved \r\nintegration within the global economy. \r\nIn past years, many challenges have hindered the \r\ncollective effort to achieve the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs) in Africa. However, adoption of NEPAD \r\nhas forged broader support among the international \r\ncommunity, which has led to greater achievements on \r\nthe part of African countries through policy actions \r\naimed at implementing NEPAD’s sectoral priorities. \r\nIt has also further enhanced prospects of attaining the \r\nMDGs.\r\nThe establishment of the NEPAD Planning and \r\nCoordination Agency and its integration within the \r\nAfrican Union’s structure and process have gradually \r\nstrengthened the coherence and coordination of all \r\ndevelopment efforts in the continent. We need to learn \r\nfrom the experiences of the past 10 years and build on \r\nNEPAD’s success. We should work together towards \r\na new approach and better ways and means to ensure \r\nIn the context of its determined and continuous \r\nefforts to implement the development goals contained in \r\nthe international plan, Togo drafted a national five-year \r\nstrategic plan to combat malaria, entitled “Roll Back \r\nMalaria 2006-2010”, with a particular emphasis on \r\nmosquito nets as a means of protection. There is not the \r\nslightest doubt that it is my country’s wish to achieve \r\nthe highest rate of use of insecticide-treated mosquito \r\nnets, namely, 80 per cent, in order to protect vulnerable \r\npopulations, especially women and children. It is \r\ntrue that the numerous campaigns to distribute free \r\ninsecticide-treated mosquito nets have helped to \r\ndecrease somewhat the rate of malaria contamination in \r\nsome regions where 71 per cent of households, or 77 per \r\ncent of children under 5 years of age, have benefited \r\nfrom health-care interventions. However, about 64.7 per \r\ncent of women are still exposed to malaria.\r\nToday, my country is committed to meeting the \r\nchallenge and to extending the rate of preventive and \r\ncurative coverage to 80 per cent of the at-risk population, \r\nin conformity with the technical recommendations of \r\nthe World Health Organization, which should ensure a \r\n75 per cent reduction in the impact of malaria on our \r\npeople by 2015. With that in mind, we have started a \r\nnew, simple malaria diagnosis campaign, including \r\nfollow-up treatments with Coartem for infants and all \r\nchildren up to 10 years of age, which will run from \r\nearly October until the end of December. Togo has \r\nalso undertaken an anti-vector campaign, primarily \r\naimed at improving local environmental conditions and \r\nstrengthening sanitation.\r\nA reassessment of the 2005-2010 strategic plan \r\nindicated some progress as well as weaknesses. In \r\nreviewing the weaknesses, there were two main \r\nproblems, as seen in the target groups, namely, a low \r\nusage rate as far as the insecticide-treated nets were \r\nconcerned and possible future unavailability of the nets. \r\nWith respect to environmental management, hygiene \r\nand basic sanitation, the major problem identified is the \r\nlack of an intersectoral programme and basic sanitation \r\nmeasures aimed at dealing with the spread of larvae \r\nbreeding grounds.\r\nGiven all that, we must see our struggle to combat \r\nmalaria within an intra- and intersectoral framework. \r\nAs a priority, we must also increase resources to support \r\nsanitation and hygiene programmes. Togo believes that \r\nthe issue of malaria must be addressed not only as a \r\npublic health issue, but also as a development issue in \r\nterms of achieving the Millennium Development Goals \r\n12-55308 19\r\nA/67/PV.26\r\ngrowth. Myanmar’s recent significant changes and \r\nre-engagement with the international community have \r\nalso opened up greater opportunities to expand trade \r\nand economic relations with countries in Africa, which \r\nis of benefit to the peoples of both Myanmar and the \r\nfriendly countries of Africa.\r\nMyanmar rejoices in the reaffirmations and \r\ncommitments of the international community to the \r\nfull implementation of existing assistance pledges, \r\nincluding those made in connection with Agenda \r\n21, the Istanbul Programme of Action, the political \r\ndeclaration on Africa’s development needs (resolution \r\n63/1) and NEPAD at the United Nations Conference on \r\nSustainable Development.\r\nJust like many countries in Africa, Myanmar \r\nhas lagged behind in development for the past 60 \r\nyears owing to domestic insurgency problems and \r\nan unfavourable external environment. Yet, we are \r\nnow redoubling our efforts to promote peace and \r\ndevelopment in our country through both political and \r\neconomic reform measures aimed at enhancing the \r\nlivelihood of the people. With the growing support and \r\nencouragement of our development partners far and \r\nnear, we believe that Myanmar’s economy will start \r\nto gain momentum in the near future. Together with \r\nother developing countries, Myanmar looks forward to \r\nenhancing our engagements with our African friends in \r\ntheir development endeavours through the South-South \r\ncooperation framework, which we believe remains \r\nimportant for Africa’s development.\r\nIn conclusion, we would like to reiterate our \r\nsupport for the full and effective implementation of the \r\nNEPAD agenda to promote peace and development in \r\nAfrica, while building mutual understanding based on \r\nour friendship and cooperation in the Bandung spirit of \r\nAfro-Asian solidarity.\r\nMr. Kohona (Sri Lanka): The New Partnership \r\nfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD) has provided \r\na road map for strategic development for the most \r\ndisadvantaged countries in the African continent. As a \r\ncountry that adopted its own development path in order \r\nto realize most of the Millennium Development Goals, \r\nSri Lanka was able to graduate to middle-income status \r\nrecently and we compliment African States, which have \r\nachieved a great deal.\r\nIn the past, malaria was responsible for high \r\nmorbidity rates worldwide, especially in 2010, when \r\nan estimated 216 million cases of malaria occurred, \r\neffective implementation of the programme in the next \r\ndecade.\r\nAs NEPAD enters its second decade, clear resolve \r\nand commitment, as well as policy actions, are \r\nessential in order to meet Africa’s development needs \r\nand to effectively and fully implement the NEPAD \r\nagenda. We are pleased to witness Africa’s steady \r\ntransformation despite the tremendous challenges \r\nfacing the region. We are also encouraged to learn that \r\neven with its difficult geopolitical environment and the \r\ndecreasing momentum of the world economy, growth in \r\nAfrica was resilient, with a rate of 4.5 per cent in 2011. \r\nNevertheless, Africa’s growth is inadequate  for the goal \r\nof significantly reducing poverty, and the continent still \r\nlags behind other regions on progress in achieving the \r\nMDGs, because of the heavy effects caused by climate \r\nchange and food insecurity.\r\nIt is evident that, while domestic leadership is key \r\nto Africa’s development, a strengthened and sustained \r\nglobal partnership is critical to successful development \r\nendeavours. Although development partners have \r\ncommitted to helping Africa’s development needs, \r\nincluding implementation of the NEPAD priorities, \r\nonly limited progress has been made in that regard. We \r\ntherefore add our voice in calling on the international \r\ncommunity to increase support for Africa and to help \r\nit make further progress in the implementation of the \r\nNEPAD agenda. \r\nBoth sustained external financial support and the \r\ngood management of the resources are prerequisites for \r\nsuccess in the implementation of NEPAD. However, \r\nwe hardly need to stress here the importance of giving \r\nspecial consideration to the needs and priorities of \r\nAfrican countries, as well as to their right to self-\r\ndetermination.\r\nMyanmar was one of the leading countries in \r\nbuilding friendship and solidarity among Asian and \r\nAfrican countries over five decades ago, as one of the \r\norganizers of the historic Asian-African Conference, \r\nalso known as the Bandung Conference. Myanmar \r\nhas long been committed to the cause of peace and \r\ndevelopment on the African continent and a strong and \r\nsolid supporter of the decolonization efforts of African \r\ncountries. As Myanmar and Africa have a deep-rooted \r\nrelationship and tradition of friendship, allow me to \r\nreiterate that, in solidarity with Africa, Myanmar will \r\ncontinue to stand firmly in support of NEPAD’s goal \r\nof generating broad-based and equitable economic \r\n20 12-55308\r\nA/67/PV.26\r\nA heavy focus on preventative measures, such \r\nas carrying out early detection and operational \r\nresearch and giving adequate prominence to curative \r\nmeasures, were key factors in our success story. The \r\nmassive awareness campaign in the school system on \r\nepidemics caused by mosquitoes made a significant \r\nimpact. Political leadership, from the national level to \r\nthe grass-roots level, was also mobilized. An effective \r\npartnership with civil society organizations, the private \r\nsector and international development partners was a \r\ncontributory factor. I must acknowledge with gratitude \r\nthe solid partnership with the WHO and the Roll Back \r\nMalaria Partnership’s Global Malaria Action Plan, \r\nwhich has contributed tremendously to our efforts.\r\nSustaining those gains and preventing resurgence \r\nare even more challenging today, with population \r\npressures and the tropical environment of Sri Lanka. \r\nAnother challenge is the shift in the population group \r\nthat is at highest risk. The group most at risk in Sri \r\nLanka is now adult men, particularly those exposed to \r\nmalaria-carrying mosquitoes through their work, such \r\nas gem miners, service personnel and farmers. We are \r\nin the process of developing new strategies to address \r\ntheir needs as we progress with our success story.\r\nI would also commend the significant progress \r\nmade globally against malaria in recent years with the \r\nhelp of the United Nations and other partners, including \r\nbilateral and multilateral agencies. Sri Lanka is ready to \r\nshare its experience and expertise with others. Moving \r\nforward, especially in Africa, it will be critical for a \r\nrange of actors to work together. It will be necessary to \r\naccess low-cost and affordable treatments and drugs. \r\nThe private sector has a key role in this area. The only \r\nway to achieve universal targets like the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and those in the Roll Back Malaria \r\nPartnership’s Global Malaria Action Plan is to work \r\ntogether in partnership.\r\nMr. Dos Santos (Brazil): My delegation would like \r\nto thank the President for convening this joint debate \r\non the New Partnership for Africa’s Development \r\n(NEPAD) and on the Decade to Roll Back Malaria \r\nin Developing Countries, Particularly in Africa. The \r\ncurrent plenary meeting is an important opportunity to \r\nreaffirm our support for Africa’s development agenda, \r\nwhich is central to the achievement of the internationally \r\nagreed development goals, including the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). We would also like to \r\nconvey our appreciation for the quality of the reports \r\nand notes (A/67/204 and A/64/205) presented by the \r\nresulting in the deaths of 655,000 people, mostly in \r\nAfrica. Controlling malaria has been one of the most \r\ncost-effective challenges in the global public health \r\narena, providing an excellent return on investment. The \r\nSecretary-General has recognized the importance of \r\nmalaria as a barrier to the broader development agenda \r\nby making it one of his priorities for the beginning of \r\nhis second term. Globally, the incidence of the disease \r\nhas come down significantly during the past few years, \r\nespecially after the global community united behind \r\nthe comprehensive Global Malaria Action Plan of the \r\nRoll Back Malaria Partnership of the World Health \r\nOrganization (WHO) in 1998.\r\nThe Decade to Roll Back Malaria in Developing \r\nCountries is particularly relevant to Sri Lanka. The \r\nsocioeconomic advantages of Sri Lanka’s public-\r\nhealth-care delivery system have been acknowledged \r\nglobally. It is positively reflected in the very low child \r\nand maternal mortality rates in the country. In addition, \r\nour success in eradicating polio has also been cited in a \r\nspecial case study.\r\nSri Lanka, once plagued by malaria, now \r\nexperiences only sporadic cases in some parts of the \r\ncountry. It nearly eliminated malaria once. In 1963, \r\nduring the global malaria eradication effort, we achieved \r\na low of only 17 cases, down from 92,000 cases in \r\n1953. With funding declining and reduced spraying and \r\nsurveillance, we experienced a massive resurgence of \r\nup to 1.5 million cases in 1967-1968. That highlighted \r\nthe necessity of continued vigilance, investment and \r\nefforts to sustain results already achieved. Since 1970, \r\nSri Lanka has worked hard to bring malaria back under \r\ncontrol, with significant success. There has been a \r\ndramatic reduction of the caseload in the past decade, \r\ndown from 210,000 cases in 2000 to 558 cases in 2009, \r\na 99.7 per cent reduction. In 2011, only 124 locally \r\nacquired cases were reported.\r\nSri Lanka is also unique in that, despite nearly \r\nthree decades of internal conflict, it has succeeded in \r\nreducing malaria cases by 99.9 per cent since 1999 and \r\nis on track to eliminate the disease entirely by 2014. \r\nNormally, countries dealing with conflict situations \r\nexperience a weakening in their epidemic control \r\nmechanisms. Among the keys to success was the ability \r\nof Sri Lanka’s national programme to be f lexible and to \r\nadapt to difficult and volatile conditions. Public health \r\nworkers deployed mobile clinics equipped with malaria \r\ndiagnostic tools and anti-malarial drugs to protect \r\nhard-to-reach and displaced populations.\r\n12-55308 21\r\nA/67/PV.26\r\nAfrica’s development, and we call upon all donor \r\ncountries to fulfil their commitments as a matter of \r\nurgency.\r\nWe believe that the United Nations Conference \r\non Sustainable Development has provided important \r\ntools to enable us to step up our efforts to foster \r\nAfrica’s development agenda in all three dimensions \r\nof sustainable development, namely, the economic, the \r\nsocial and the environmental. Based on the principles \r\nof national ownership and leadership, NEPAD has our \r\nfull and enthusiastic support, as it offers an effective \r\nframework for cooperation and development, rooted in \r\nAfrican perspectives and African priorities.\r\nAfrica remains a priority for Brazilian foreign \r\npolicy. Over the past decade, Brazil has increased its \r\npresence in Africa, including through the establishment \r\nof a growing network of diplomatic and trade missions \r\nin the continent. Today, we are present in 37 African \r\ncapitals, including in Addis Ababa, the headquarters \r\nof the African Union. We have also been working to \r\nstrengthen regional political dialogue with a view to \r\nbroadening the scope and number of developing partners. \r\nThe Africa-South America Summit constitutes, in that \r\nsense, a good example of an innovative platform for \r\nincreased dialogue and cooperation.\r\nBilateral economic ties between Brazil and African \r\ncountries have also prospered. Over the past decade, \r\nBrazil-Africa trade f lows have increased more than six-\r\nfold, from $4.2 billion in 2002 to over $27 billion in 2011. \r\nWe have also expanded investment in several countries \r\non the continent, particularly in the construction, \r\nmining, energy and transportation sectors.\r\nBrazil fully supports the sector priorities established \r\nby NEPAD. In recognition of the essential role played by \r\nagricultural and rural development as crucial drivers of \r\nfood security and poverty eradication, we have sought \r\nto work with African partner countries to develop joint \r\ninitiatives in those areas. Since 2002, the Brazilian \r\nGovernment has signed more than 50 cooperation \r\nagreements in the field of agriculture with 18 African \r\ncountries, including Algeria, Angola, Cape Verde, \r\nCameroon, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Sao \r\nTome and Principe, Senegal, Tanzania and Tunisia. Two \r\nyears ago, we were pleased to host 45 African countries \r\nin the first Brazil-Africa Dialogue on Food Security, \r\nthe Fight against Hunger, and Rural Development.\r\nSince 2006, the Brazilian Agricultural Research \r\nCorporation, a State company, has been operating \r\nSecretary-General on the items under our consideration \r\ntoday.\r\nThe contours of Brazilian culture and society owe \r\nmuch to our historical ties with the African peoples. \r\nThose ties constitute an essential element of who we are \r\nas a nation. Brazil’s support for NEPAD reflects that \r\nawareness of our inextricable connections to Africa. The \r\nSecretary-General’s tenth progress report on NEPAD \r\nshows that Africa is undergoing a profound economic, \r\nsocial and political transformation. As highlighted by \r\nthe report, the New Partnership mechanism aims to \r\ngenerate broad-based, sustained and equitable growth \r\nthat allows Africa to reduce poverty and better integrate \r\nthe continent into the global economy. We believe that \r\ncooperation remains a key strategy for success, as \r\nprogress in development demands concerted action on \r\nmultiple fronts in order to ensure inclusive, equitable \r\nand sustainable growth.\r\nIn that connection, Brazil commends the \r\nprogress made in the African continent in a number \r\nof areas, as indicated in the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport, such as infrastructure, agriculture, food \r\nsecurity, health, education, environment, information \r\nand communications technology, and women’s \r\nempowerment. We wish to underscore the important \r\nrole played by the Programme for Infrastructure \r\nDevelopment in Africa as a framework for promoting \r\nsynergies at the regional and continental levels through \r\nactions focused on transport, energy and water \r\ninfrastructure.\r\nMany challenges still lie ahead. The world \r\neconomy continues to face renewed uncertainty, \r\nand many African countries still depend largely on \r\nexports of commodities for their economic well-being. \r\nThe lack of progress in the negotiations of the World \r\nTrade Organization Doha Round — particularly with \r\nregard to improved agricultural market access, an issue \r\nof central importance for the Round’s development \r\nobjectives — makes it much harder for poor countries \r\nto withstand the impacts of the global economic crisis. \r\nThe situation is further aggravated by the slow \r\npace in the increase of official development assistance \r\nto Africa. As noted in the Secretary-General’s report, \r\nAfrica has received only around half of the increased \r\nassistance pledged at the Group of Eight Summit \r\nin Gleneagles in 2005. We welcome, in that regard, \r\nthe adoption of resolution 66/293 on a monitoring \r\nmechanism to review commitments made towards \r\n22 12-55308\r\nA/67/PV.26\r\ngoals of achieving universal coverage in malaria \r\nprevention and treatment by 2010 and reducing global \r\nmalaria deaths to near zero preventable deaths by 2015. \r\nProgrammes related to early diagnosis and control have \r\nbeen able to decrease the global mortality by 25 per cent \r\nsince the beginning of the Roll Back Malaria initiative.\r\nHowever, there are still many significant challenges \r\nto be overcome. In addition to traditional prevention \r\nstrategies, such as the use of insecticide-treated nets and \r\nindoor residual spraying, national Governments should \r\nbe able to count on the support of the international \r\ncommunity to implement mechanisms aimed at ensuring \r\nuniversal access to free or affordable medicines for the \r\ntreatment of malaria for those who are already affected, \r\nmaking full use of the f lexibility in the Agreement \r\non Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property \r\nRights (TRIPS) of the World Trade Organization, in \r\naccordance with the Doha Declaration on TRIPS and \r\nPublic Health.\r\nMr. Gumende (Mozambique): Since this is the \r\nfirst time I am taking the f loor, I seize this opportunity \r\nto reiterate the congratulations of the Mozambican \r\ndelegation to Mr. Vuk Jeremić on his election to \r\npreside over the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh \r\nsession and to assure him of our full commitment to \r\ncontribute to the success of this session. The delegation \r\nof Mozambique aligns itself with the statement made \r\nby the distinguished representative of Cameroon, on \r\nbehalf of the African Group (see A/67/PV.25).\r\nIt is with great interest that my delegation joins in \r\nthis debate on the development of Africa, and we wish \r\nto commend the Secretary-General for the substantive \r\nreports before us today (A/67/204 and A/67/205). We \r\nalso take the opportunity to commend the various \r\ninitiatives related to the celebration of Africa Week, \r\nwhich contributes to keeping Africa’s development \r\nneeds at the centre of the international agenda.\r\nWe note with encouragement that the reports \r\nbefore us give evidence of the positive trends in \r\nAfrica’s development, from its remarkable growth rates \r\nto its growing political stability, recognizing that those \r\nachievements derive from strong leadership, good \r\ngovernance and increased reliance on home-grown \r\nsolutions that are appropriate to Africans as the subjects \r\nand owners of their own destiny.\r\nThe New Economic Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) has provided us with exceptional \r\nopportunities to improve capacities and policies aimed \r\nin Africa through an office in Ghana with a view \r\nto supporting the technological and productive \r\nimprovement of savannah agriculture in Africa. \r\nThrough that facility, we have been able to provide \r\nassistance to over 30 countries in the region. We \r\nalso believe in the large potential Africa has for the \r\nsustainable production of biofuels, while being careful \r\nnot to endanger food production or food security. In \r\nthat sense, Brazil has been working with countries \r\nsuch as Ghana and Senegal in order to develop national \r\ncapacity for the production of bioenergy.\r\nAs a rule, cooperation projects aim to transfer \r\nskills, build local capacity and empower local workers, \r\nwith the full engagement and ownership of African \r\nGovernments, in line with the principles that guide our \r\nengagement in South-South cooperation initiatives. \r\nFurthermore, together with our partners, India and \r\nSouth Africa, we have engaged in a number of capacity-\r\nbuilding projects with countries such as Burundi, Cape \r\nVerde, Guinea-Bissau and Sierra Leone.\r\nThe implications of health issues on the overall \r\nefforts to promote development are clear and have \r\nbeen reaffirmed in a number of internationally agreed \r\ndocuments, such as the Millennium Declaration \r\n(resolution 55/2). According to the World Health \r\nOrganization, there were, in 2011, around 216 million \r\ncases of malaria worldwide, with an estimated 655,000 \r\ndeaths per year, mainly in Africa, where every \r\nminute one child dies of that disease. NEPAD rightly \r\nrecognizes the close links between health, poverty, \r\nsocial exclusion, marginalization and environmental \r\ndegradation in Africa.\r\nAs one of the countries aff licted by malaria, Brazil \r\nis deeply committed to the international fight against \r\nthe disease. Our engagement is manifested through both \r\nbilateral cooperation and participation in multilateral \r\nefforts, such as the Roll Back Malaria Partnership, the \r\nInternational Drug Purchase Facility and the Global \r\nFund to fight HIV/AIDS, Malaria and Tuberculosis.\r\nBrazilian cooperation initiatives focus significantly \r\non creating and developing capacities in the area of \r\nhealth. On the bilateral level, we have developed joint \r\ntraining and capacity-building programmes with a \r\nnumber of African countries for the prevention and \r\ncontrol of malaria and the overall strengthening of \r\nnational health systems.\r\nThe international community has made remarkable \r\nprogress over the past few years in the pursuit of the \r\n12-55308 23\r\nA/67/PV.26\r\nHIV/AIDS being the most vulnerable. The 2010-2014 \r\nfive-year Government plan and its poverty eradication \r\nstrategy envisage bold measures to strategically develop \r\nnational systems and capacities in the health sector and \r\nto increase the coverage and quality of interventions, \r\nwhich can enable the country to move to an elimination \r\nplan sooner.\r\nAccordingly, the Ministry of Health is actively \r\nengaged in establishing participatory and integrated \r\nstrategies to mitigate the impact of diseases that directly \r\naffect the social and economic structure. It has also put \r\nin place a strategy that combines efforts to secure more \r\nf lexible and better-trained health personnel, as well as \r\na close monitoring mechanism for malaria eradication.\r\nIt is worth noting that Mozambique has witnessed \r\nsignificant progress in the reduction of the malaria \r\nburden in the country through various initiatives \r\nundertaken under the National Malaria Control \r\nProgramme, such as indoor residual spraying; \r\nincreased Roll Back Malaria awareness campaigns, \r\nbased on wide-scale mosquito net distribution, aiming \r\nat universal access; intermittent preventative treatment \r\nfor pregnant women; the use of rapid-diagnosis tests \r\nas well as combined therapy based on artemisinin for \r\nmalaria treatment. As a result, Mozambique has made \r\nsignificant steps towards reducing malaria occurrence \r\nand has increased the number of health units capable \r\nof performing malaria diagnosis on the ground. In \r\naddition, 100 per cent of health units and indoor \r\nresidual spraying agents are capable of assisting people \r\nwith malaria by providing first-line malaria treatment; \r\n57 per cent of the affected families have at least one \r\nmosquito net with long-lasting insecticide treatment; \r\n34 per cent of pregnant women were entitled to two \r\ndoses of intermittent preventative malaria treatment \r\nduring the first semester of 2012; indoor residual \r\nspraying covers 85 per cent of the targeted districts in \r\nthe country for the 2011-2012 period.\r\nOur efforts are geared towards measures that go \r\nbeyond the goal of malaria prevention. Our aim is to \r\nincrease collective awareness of good practices, with \r\na view to eliminating the scourge of malaria, which is \r\none of the constraints on our national development. As \r\nwe strive to keep up the momentum generated by the \r\nDecade to Roll Back Malaria, Mozambique would like \r\nto stress its view that the lessons learned and the best \r\npractices for scaling up national interventions add value \r\nto our efforts to improve universal access and reach the \r\ntargets to which we have committed ourselves.\r\nat delivering results in important socioeconomic areas \r\nand at promoting public and private partnerships, which \r\nhave added to the growing confidence in Africa’s ability \r\nto extricate itself from the malaise of underdevelopment \r\nwithin the continent and beyond, thus enabling many \r\ncountries to make progress towards achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs).\r\nAs the report of the Secretary-General underscores, \r\nthe African continent is making concerted efforts \r\nto ensure that international development assistance \r\nis gradually complemented by an increasing share \r\nof internally raised resources within the continent. \r\nNevertheless, we believe that international development \r\nassistance is still critical to helping the continent to \r\nbuild and consolidate the foundations for growth that \r\nwill eventually reduce dependence through investments \r\nin infrastructure and the social sectors, such as health \r\nand education.\r\nTherefore, while we are encouraged by the modest \r\nincrease in the levels of official development assistance \r\nto Africa from $47 billion in 2010 to $50 billion in 2011, \r\nwe would like to renew the call to the international \r\ncommunity to ensure that the shortfalls in attaining \r\nthe agreed levels of financial commitments made at \r\nUnited Nations conferences and by the Group of Eight \r\nat Gleneagles in 2005 and L’Aquila in 2009, including \r\nthose relating to the financing of food security and \r\nagriculture programmes, will soon be resolved. Only \r\nwith the support of its development partners can Africa \r\nsuccessfully address the prevailing challenges and stay \r\nthe course to sustainable development in peace and \r\nachieve the MDGs.\r\nTo that end, we concur with the recommendations \r\ncontained in the reports of the Secretary-General \r\nand would like to stress that, in order for Africa \r\nto continue to consolidate the socioeconomic and \r\npolitical achievements made so far, priority should be \r\ngiven to strengthening, among other things, inclusive \r\ngovernance, partnerships between public and private \r\nsectors so as to expand economic opportunities, build \r\ninfrastructure, develop local economies and reduce \r\npoverty.\r\nWith regard to sustained global partnerships, \r\nturning to agenda item 13, malaria remains a great \r\nconcern in our development efforts, as it accounts for \r\na high percentage of Mozambique’s disease burden, \r\nwith children under 5 years of age, pregnant women, \r\nsocially disadvantaged groups and people living with \r\n24 12-55308\r\nA/67/PV.26\r\nduring the past decade the rapid increase in measures \r\nto control malaria has saved more than a million lives \r\nin Africa, reducing deaths from malaria by 38 per \r\ncent. Those achievements should help to strengthen \r\nthe international partnership aiming to completely \r\neliminate malaria.\r\nThe Republic of Equatorial Guinea has contributed \r\nvigorously to those efforts at both the international and \r\nthe national levels. Internationally, the Government \r\nof the Republic of Equatorial Guinea sponsors the \r\nUNESCO-Equatorial Guinea International Prize for \r\nResearch in the Life Sciences, whose purpose is to foster \r\nscientific research aimed at the eradication of pandemic \r\ndiseases, such as malaria, that aff lict the continent of \r\nAfrica and other regions of the world. Nationally, the \r\nGovernment runs an anti-malaria initiative sponsored \r\nby the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, \r\nthe Marathon Oil Corporation and Medical Care \r\nDevelopment International, which currently focuses on \r\nBioko Island, but will be extended in 2013 to cover the \r\nmainland of the country. \r\nAs a result of those efforts on the part of the \r\nGovernment, in cooperation with its partners Marathon \r\nand Medical Care, the Republic of Equatorial Guinea \r\ntoday has one of the most successful programmes to \r\ncombat malaria, having reduced the incidence of the \r\ndisease by 57 per cent in only four years. In support \r\nof that initiative the Government is working towards \r\nthe completion of a wide-ranging set of projects to \r\nbuild and equip specialized hospitals, provide potable \r\nwater and supply electricity to all parts of the country. \r\nThose projects fall under the Government Horizon \r\n2020 initiative, which seeks to provide health care for \r\nall, education for all, livelihoods for all, food for all, \r\nelectricity for all and potable water for all.\r\nIn his address to the General Assembly at this session, \r\nMr. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, President of the \r\nRepublic of Equatorial Guinea, reiterated his support \r\nfor an approach based on common but differentiated \r\nresponsibility in the global fight against pandemic \r\ndiseases, including malaria (see A/67/PV.12). Because \r\ngood intentions are not enough, but must be proved by \r\nactions, the President of the Republic backed up his \r\nstated support with specific commitments. \r\nIn that vein, we express our sincere appreciation \r\nfor the noble work being done by the Roll Back Malaria \r\nPartnership under the leadership of Executive Director \r\nFatoumata Nafo-Traoré, Under-Secretary-General \r\nIn the efforts to address the scourge of malaria, \r\npartnerships with the relevant stakeholders, such as the \r\nprivate sector, civil society, development partners and \r\nneighbouring countries, are of paramount importance. \r\nAs such, Mozambique is among the eight Southern \r\nAfrican Development Community pilot group countries \r\nthat signed, in 2009, a malaria agreement establishing \r\n2020 as a target for malaria eradication. We are \r\nconvinced that a regional approach will ensure the \r\navailability of appropriate mechanisms to strengthen the \r\nongoing transborder initiatives and their sustainability. \r\nWe reiterate our regional common understanding that \r\nonly a common political commitment will drive us \r\ntowards establishing an appropriate health architecture \r\nby means of which we will be able to overcome \r\nthe challenge confronting the region, namely, the \r\neradication of malaria in this decade.\r\nI would like to conclude by stressing that, based \r\non the progress made so far and the commitments \r\nadhered to by the various partners, we are confident \r\nthat Africa will not be left behind. The Government of \r\nMozambique remains committed to accelerating and \r\nredoubling its efforts.\r\nMr. Ndong Mba (Equatorial Guinea) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): I would like, first of all, to align my delegation \r\nwith the statement made by Ambassador Tommo \r\nMonthe, Permanent Representative of Cameroon, in his \r\ncapacity as Chair of the African Group (see A/67/PV.25).\r\nWe are pleased that the Organization has convened \r\nthis meeting on the Decade to Roll Back Malaria in \r\nDeveloping Countries, Particularly in Africa, and \r\nwe thank the Secretary-General for his leadership in \r\nthat initiative and for his comprehensive report on the \r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development (A/67/204). \r\nI take this opportunity to express the Republic of \r\nEquatorial Guinea’s appreciation for the noble efforts \r\ndeployed over the past decade by the Roll Back Malaria \r\nPartnership in the framework of the New Partnership \r\nfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD), with the benefit of \r\nsubstantive international support. We also appreciate \r\nthe resources mobilized, which are greatly helping \r\nGovernments’ ongoing efforts to combat and eradicate \r\npandemic diseases in developing countries, such as \r\nmalaria. \r\nDespite those efforts, malaria continues to take \r\n780,000 lives a year. Malaria still affects 40 per cent \r\nof the world’s population, impeding socioeconomic \r\ndevelopment in the poorest communities. Nevertheless, \r\n12-55308 25\r\nA/67/PV.26\r\nseen as a marginalized part of the world that is fit only \r\nfor consideration from the perspective of humanitarian \r\nassistance. Even during difficult times at the global \r\nlevel, Africa has continued to register growth. That \r\ndoes not apply to all countries on the continent, but it \r\napplies to enough of them for the trend to be considered \r\nbroadly representative. \r\nIt is projected that Africa will grow at the rate of \r\n5 per cent in the next decade, which is not sufficient \r\nto ensure the graduation of most of its least developed \r\ncountries into the middle-income categories. If we \r\nare to achieve more, the global situation, including \r\nfinancing for development, has to improve.\r\nAlthough the continent has been moving towards \r\na more promising future, the development challenges \r\nfacing Africa remain complex. Global realities have \r\ncontinued to influence Africa’s development outlook \r\nsince the turn of the new millennium. The global \r\nfinancial and economic crisis, worsened by fiscal \r\ndisarray, and climate change have had an impact, direct \r\nand indirect, on the high gross domestic product growth \r\nrates in Africa, which had reached a peak of about 6 per \r\ncent in 2007.\r\nIn that context, the role of NEPAD is extremely \r\ncritical. NEPAD has moved into a new phase of \r\nAfrica’s development trajectory. The focus is now on \r\nthe implementation of key programmes and projects in \r\nkey sectors such as infrastructure, energy, agriculture \r\nand enhancement of African ownership. Essentially, the \r\ncore objectives of NEPAD should be realized through \r\neffective international cooperation.\r\nEthiopia is committed to the NEPAD vision of \r\ntaking full ownership of its development process. \r\nNEPAD should serve as the catalyst for development \r\nand regional integration. In that regard, we call on all \r\ndevelopment partners to work towards re-energizing \r\nNEPAD implementation. For its part, Ethiopia attaches \r\ngreat importance to strengthening regional integration. \r\nThe electric power connections and the road networks \r\nthat we have built and are building with Djibouti, the \r\nSudan, Kenya and South Sudan are emblematic of \r\nour resolve to play our part in regional integration. \r\nWe believe that that infrastructure development will \r\ncreate larger markets and develop stronger economies \r\nthat facilitate and enhance the regional economic \r\ntransformation.\r\nBeyond economic development, it is also essential \r\nto promote social development programmes guided \r\nMaged Abdelaziz, the Special Adviser of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on Africa, and Mr. Ibrahim Miyaki, Chief \r\nExecutive Officer of the Planning and Coordinating \r\nAgency of the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD), for the remarkable dynamism \r\nand pragmatism of the work being done within the \r\nframework of NEPAD, and for the international support \r\nin promoting sustainable development and lasting peace \r\nin Africa. \r\nI conclude my brief remarks by encouraging all \r\nof Africa’s partners and, indeed, the whole of the \r\ninternational community to support the strong efforts \r\nbeing made by the Governments of our continent and \r\nto help confront the numerous challenges they face \r\nin coping with the pandemic diseases, in particular \r\nmalaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS, while striving \r\nfor sustainable development and lasting peace in the \r\nregion.\r\nMs. Cizare (Ethiopia): Allow me at the outset to \r\nexpress my delegation’s appreciation to the President \r\nof the General Assembly for convening this plenary \r\nmeeting, which is of great importance for Africa. I \r\nwould also like to express our deep appreciation to the \r\nSecretary-General for his leadership and commitment \r\nin putting Africa’s agenda at the centre of the work of the \r\nUnited Nations system. Ethiopia welcomes the progress \r\nreport of the Secretary-General on the New Partnership \r\nfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD) (A/67/204). My \r\ndelegation fully associates itself with the statement \r\ndelivered by the representative of Cameroon on behalf \r\nof the African Group (see A/67/PV.25).\r\nThe year 2012 signals the beginning of the second \r\ndecade for NEPAD. A key milestone has been reached. \r\nSince its inception, NEPAD served as the common \r\nand shared vision for Africa’s renewal. The vision \r\nof NEPAD’s initiators is one that is premised on the \r\nneed for Africa to take its rightful place in the global \r\nsystem, based on our self-defined transformative \r\nagenda and ownership. Over the years NEPAD has \r\nmatured into the f lagship development programme of \r\nthe African Union. Its programmatic activities have \r\npromoted stronger African ownership through creative \r\nand effective cooperation with partners. NEPAD has \r\nbeen contributing immensely to the transformation \r\nof the policy design and implementation of Africa’s \r\ndevelopment objectives. \r\nThere is no doubt that Africa is witnessing a new \r\nera of renewed momentum. No longer is the continent \r\n26 12-55308\r\nA/67/PV.26\r\nwith issues related to security, development and the \r\nrule of law.\r\nThe State of Kuwait attaches special importance \r\nto the agenda item before us because of Kuwait’s close \r\nrelationship with Africa and the challenges that the \r\nAfrican continent faces. Those challenges require all \r\nof us to step up our efforts and cooperation and assist \r\nthe peoples of the continent as they address them. They \r\ninclude, inter alia, the steep increase in the rate of \r\nunemployment, the absence of security in a number of \r\nregions, the spread of armed conflicts, and the fact that \r\na significant number of African States remain far from \r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nEleven years have elapsed since the heads of African \r\nStates adopted the NEPAD initiative, the comprehensive \r\nstrategic vision for accomplishing economic and social \r\ndevelopment in Africa. Moreover, 10 years have elapsed \r\nsince the General Assembly held a high-level dialogue \r\non the NEPAD initiative, on 16 September 2002, and \r\nadopted, in November 2002 its resolution 57/7, making \r\nNEPAD the international community’s framework \r\nfor Africa’s development. The Assembly called upon \r\nthe United Nations, its specialized agencies and other \r\ndevelopment partners to harmonize their programmes \r\ndirected at supporting development efforts in Africa. \r\nUnfortunately, increases in the number of poverty \r\ncases and the spread of dangerous and communicable \r\ndiseases, together with the progressive decrease in \r\neconomic support and support for development projects, \r\nmakes it essential that the international community \r\ntake a serious stand, determine how to support and \r\nassist developing African States in overcoming the \r\ndifficulties they face in earning their livelihoods, and \r\nadhere to the resolutions and commitments it has made \r\nto increase official development assistance.\r\nDuring the past five years, the countries of the \r\nworld have witnessed the emergence of numerous \r\ninternational challenges and dangers that have impeded \r\ndevelopment efforts in many developing countries. \r\nPerhaps the most pressing of those challenges have \r\nbeen the rise in food prices, the turmoil in financial \r\nmarkets and the global economic crisis. However, \r\ndespite the significance of those crises, they should not \r\nimpede the international community in the fulfilment \r\nof its commitments to support development projects \r\nin the developing and the least developed countries. \r\nI therefore cannot fail to emphasize the need to urge \r\nAfrican countries to make greater efforts to address \r\nby the objective of social inclusion. Here again the \r\nchallenge is not to come up with a new strategy for \r\nsocial development but to implement the strategies that \r\nwe have on various occasions already charted. \r\nRecent reports describe Africa as a young continent, \r\nwith over 60 per cent of its current population being \r\nunder 30 years old. The current characteristics of \r\nAfrican demography represent a potential challenge. \r\nProper management of the demographic situation \r\nrequires active and substantive participation by youth \r\nin the economic, social and political environment. We \r\nbelieve, therefore, that the main principle in dealing \r\nwith the issue must be to recognize that the problems of \r\nyouth can be overcome successfully only by addressing \r\nthe challenges facing African societies as a whole. It is \r\nin that context that it becomes essential to help youth \r\norganize and to create the necessary political space \r\nand mechanisms for their engagement in addressing \r\nsocietal challenges.\r\nTurning to the issue of rolling back malaria in \r\ndeveloping countries, since 2000 Ethiopia has made \r\nsignificant and intensified efforts by initiating and \r\nscaling up the coverage of key malaria interventions \r\nthroughout the country. Our malaria prevention and \r\ncontrol programme is an integral part of our growth \r\nand transformation plan. As a result, the overall \r\nachievement has been a significant reduction in cases \r\nof malaria and malaria-related deaths. \r\nIn concluding, Ethiopia would like to underscore \r\nthat the post-2015 development agenda and the follow-\r\nup to and implementation of the outcomes of the United \r\nNations Conference on Sustainable Development, \r\nparticularly in the process of formation of sustainable \r\ndevelopment goals, should pay particular attention to \r\nthe development needs of Africa.\r\nMr. Al-Duwaisan (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): My \r\ncountry’s delegation is pleased to take part in discussing \r\nthe agenda item entitled “New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment”. We have followed with great attention \r\nthe content of the two reports of the Secretary-General \r\non the implementation of and international support \r\nfor the New Partnership for Africa’s Development \r\n(NEPAD) (A/67/204) and on the causes of conflict \r\nand the promotion of durable peace and sustainable \r\ndevelopment in Africa (A/67/205). We join others \r\nin urging the international community, African \r\nGovernments, development partners and international \r\nfinancial institutions to unite their efforts in dealing \r\n12-55308 27\r\nA/67/PV.26\r\ncontinent has always benefited from the activities of \r\nthe Fund. The total amount that the Kuwait Fund for \r\nArab Economic Development has spent on development \r\nprojects in Africa exceeds $6.4 billion. \r\nIn conclusion, I would like to emphasize the need \r\nfor the international community, all intergovernmental \r\nand non-governmental organizations and the private \r\nsector to stand united in providing the support and \r\nassistance needed to ensure the availability of the means \r\nfor lives of dignity and to strengthen the infrastructure \r\nof the developing countries in general and the African \r\ncountries in particular. That is in accordance with \r\nArticle 1 of the Charter of the United Nations, which \r\ndeals with international cooperation to solve economic, \r\nsocial, cultural and humanitarian issues.\r\nMr. Maina (Kenya): I wish to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his reports informing today’s debate \r\n(A/67/204 and A/67/205). I also take this opportunity \r\nto thank the Office of the Special Adviser on Africa, \r\nthe Planning and Coordinating Agency of the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) and \r\nthe United Nations Economic Commission for Africa \r\nfor organizing the NEPAD Africa Week. That event \r\nfollows the very successful commemoration of the tenth \r\nanniversary of NEPAD held last year here in New York. \r\nMy delegation supports the statement delivered at \r\nthe 25th meeting by the Permanent Representative of \r\nCameroon on behalf of the Group of African States.\r\nToday’s debate on Africa is crucial, as it takes \r\nplace at a time when there is even greater focus on \r\nAfrica’s development needs. Kenya was honoured, \r\ntogether with Sweden, to co-facilitate the General \r\nAssembly process on the establishment of a monitoring \r\nmechanism to follow up on all commitments related to \r\nAfrica’s development needs. I am happy to report that \r\nthe co-facilitators successfully completed that crucial \r\nexercise and presented a draft resolution to be adopted \r\nat the Assembly’s sixty-seventh session. I wish to thank \r\nall Member States for their active participation and \r\nfruitful contributions during the consultation process \r\nand the negotiation of the draft resolution.\r\nA monitoring mechanism on Africa’s development \r\nneeds is important, as it will help to identify existing \r\ngaps in numerous crucial sectors and because it will \r\nhold partner agencies and countries accountable and \r\nmaintain political momentum in efforts to achieve \r\ninternationally agreed development goals.\r\nthe requirements and the concerns of the international \r\ncommunity, such as laying the foundations of stability \r\nand good governance and providing the appropriate \r\nenvironment to encourage the donor countries in all \r\nits sectors to offer the needed economic and technical \r\nsupport to the countries on the African continent.\r\nIn that regard, I would like to mention that the \r\nState of Kuwait has not spared, nor will it spare, any \r\neffort to continue its support and provide assistance \r\nto developing countries in general and to African \r\ncountries in particular, through its official institutions \r\nand its private sector. Such assistance is considered a \r\nconstant in Kuwait’s foreign policy, which emanates \r\nfrom its conviction that advancing the economies of \r\nthose States and lending them a hand in achieving their \r\ndevelopment goals will benefit everyone, consolidate \r\npartnerships and cooperation and further strengthen \r\nglobal trade and economic systems. My country will \r\ncontinue to lend support so that developing countries \r\nin general and the African countries in particular can \r\nachieve their development goals.\r\nThe State of Kuwait has a history replete with \r\npartnerships with African countries and supporting \r\ntheir development. Kuwait’s economic relations with \r\nthe African countries have often preceded diplomatic \r\nand political relations. A fundamental element in \r\nthat regard is the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic \r\nDevelopment, which has a presence in 48 of the 54 \r\ncountries that constitute the African Union. His \r\nHighness the Amir of the State of Kuwait, Sheikh \r\nSabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, participated in \r\nthe nineteenth African Union summit, held in Addis \r\nAbaba. Kuwait joined the African Union as an observer \r\nand made a donation at the summit of funds to cover the \r\nexpenses of equipping the headquarters of the African \r\nUnion Commission. All those aspects emphasize the \r\ndepth of relations between Kuwait and the countries of \r\nAfrica and clearly demonstrate my country’s desire to \r\nsupport and assist the countries of Africa as they find \r\nsolutions to their problems.\r\nRecognizing the importance of joint work \r\nundertaken to benefit the peoples of developing \r\ncountries, my country established the Kuwait Fund \r\nfor Arab Economic Development. The activities of the \r\nFund have been expanded to 102 countries, all over the \r\nworld, including 48 African countries, contributing to \r\nthe financing of numerous projects in different sectors, \r\nincluding agriculture, transportation, energy, water, \r\nsanitation, health, education and so on. The African \r\n28 12-55308\r\nA/67/PV.26\r\nstemming from a harsh global economic environment, \r\nincluding the global economic and financial crises \r\nand humanitarian interventions. The crises, coupled \r\nwith rising food and energy prices and the negative \r\neffects of climate change, have severely interrupted the \r\ndevelopment priorities of most of our countries. \r\nThe increasing global challenges have made it \r\napparent that perhaps we need to change the strategy. \r\nThus, even as we continue our reflections on the \r\npost-2015 scenario, we must focus our attention on \r\naccelerating progress towards meeting the targets \r\nbefore the stipulated time. \r\nThe transition from the MDGs to the post-2015 \r\nstrategy must be combined with a degree of continuity. \r\nThe new development agenda should be formulated \r\nthrough a participatory, inclusive and bottom-up \r\nprocess and should be United Nations-led. The process \r\nshould build on the principles of the Millennium \r\nDeclaration (resolution 55/2), experiences with the \r\nMDGs, MDG successes and resource gaps. The \r\nMillennium Declaration presented six values that were \r\nconsidered to be fundamental for international relations \r\nin the twenty-first century — freedom, equality, \r\nsolidarity, tolerance, respect for nature, and shared \r\nresponsibility. The new global development blueprint \r\nmust re-emphasize and highlight the increasing \r\nchallenges facing poor countries, particularly those of \r\nsub-Saharan Africa, which have continued to negate \r\nthe social and economic development of the continent.\r\nThe post-2015 development strategy is therefore, \r\nmore than before, critical to Africa. Dedicated and \r\naccelerated development strategies are required to \r\nfully realize the vision expressed in the Millennium \r\nDeclaration and create a world where globalization \r\nbecomes a positive force for all.\r\nWe look forward to active engagement in the \r\nforthcoming discussion on the intergovernmental \r\nprocess on sustainable development goals, the post-\r\n2015 development strategy and the just-launched \r\nnegotiations in the quadrennial comprehensive policy \r\nreview. It is Kenya’s view that at the end of those parallel \r\nprocesses on the sustainable development goals and the \r\npost-2015 development strategy, we will come up with a \r\nsingle process which should be United Nations-led. The \r\nspecial needs of Africa must be prioritized, with Africa \r\nactively engaged in the negotiation process.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.05 p.m.\r\nAfrica is the most infrastructure-deficient region \r\nglobally. The continent requires massive investment \r\nin infrastructure development — transport, energy, \r\ninformation and communications technology, and water \r\nand sanitation — in order to strengthen the platform for \r\nsustained growth. It is estimated that the region will \r\nneed to commit over $200 billion annually, through the \r\nthree pillars, in order to develop the capacity required \r\nfor sustained development. That is far above what the \r\ncontinent receives in official development assistance \r\nand what national budgets can afford. In fact, available \r\ndata shows that the continent is able to marshal only a \r\nthird of the resources required to meet the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) and other internationally \r\nagreed development goals.\r\nThe MDGs represent an unprecedented global \r\nconsensus on measures to reduce poverty, especially \r\nin Africa. They have provided a powerful tool for \r\nsustaining global attention and for galvanizing support \r\nin many countries. The MDGs have shown that a set of \r\nclear and measurable targets can be an important driver \r\nof change, and that has provided incentives for a post-\r\n2015 global development agenda. \r\nIt is now a reality that no country in sub-Saharan \r\nAfrica is on course to achieve all the MDGs by 2015. \r\nWhile some have made commendable progress towards \r\nmeeting the MDG targets within the stipulated time \r\nframe, others are not on track to realize any of them. \r\nSome have in fact recorded negative growth and \r\nreversed gains.\r\nKenya’s experience in the pursuit of the MDG \r\ntargets has been mixed. We have significantly reduced \r\nthe proportion of our population living below the \r\npoverty line. We are on course to achieve the Goal on \r\nuniversal primary education, with the net enrolment \r\nrate rising from 74 per cent in 2000 to 95 per cent in \r\n2011. Positive progress has also been witnessed in \r\ngender equality and the development of women. Kenya \r\nis a Board member of the Roll Back Malaria programme \r\nand is currently consolidating gains achieved in the \r\nfight against malaria. \r\nIt was envisaged that in order to achieve the \r\nMDGs by 2015, developing countries would need to \r\nregister a consistent and sustainable annual growth \r\nrate of at least 7 per cent up to 2015. That forecast has \r\nnot been realized, as most countries have been forced \r\nto redirect their priorities in response to the impacts \r\n"
