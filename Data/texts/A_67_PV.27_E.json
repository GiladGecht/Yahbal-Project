Those five States cannot be re-elected. \r\nTheir names, therefore, should not appear on the ballot \r\npapers.\r\nApart from the five permanent members, the \r\nSecurity Council will include in the year 2013 the \r\nfollowing States: Azerbaijan, Guatemala, Pakistan, \r\nMorocco and Togo. The names of those States, therefore, \r\nshould also not appear on the ballot papers.\r\nOf the five non-permanent members that will \r\nremain in office in the year 2013, three are from Africa \r\nand Asia-Pacific, one is from Eastern Europe and one is \r\nfrom Latin America and the Caribbean. Consequently, \r\npursuant to paragraph 3 of General Assembly resolution \r\n1991 A (XVIII), of 17 December 1963, the five \r\nnon-permanent members should be elected according \r\nto the following pattern: two from Africa and Asia-\r\nPacific, one from Latin American and the Caribbean, \r\nand two from Western Europe and other States. The \r\nballot papers reflect that pattern.\r\nIn accordance with established practice, there is \r\nan understanding to the effect that, of the two States to \r\nbe elected from Africa and Asia-Pacific, one should be \r\nfrom Africa and one from Asia-Pacific.\r\nI should like to inform the Assembly that those \r\ncandidates — their number not exceeding the number \r\nof seats to be filled — receiving the greatest number \r\nof votes and a two-thirds majority of those present \r\nand voting will be declared elected. If the number \r\nof candidates obtaining a two-thirds majority is less \r\nthan the number of members to be elected, there shall \r\nbe additional ballots to fill the remaining places, the \r\nvoting being restricted to the candidates obtaining the \r\ngreatest number of votes in the previous ballot to a \r\nnumber not more than twice the seats remaining to be \r\nfilled.\r\nAlso, consistent with past practice, in case a \r\ntie vote should make it necessary to determine the \r\ncandidate to be elected or that will proceed to the next \r\nround of restricted balloting, there will be a special \r\nrestricted ballot limited to those candidates that have \r\nobtained an equal number of votes.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly agrees to \r\nthese procedures?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In accordance with rule 92 of the \r\nrules of procedure, the election shall be held by secret \r\nballot and there shall be no nominations.\r\nUnited Nations A/67/PV.27\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-seventh session\r\n27th plenary meeting\r\nThursday, 18 October 2012, 10 a.m.\r\nNew York\r\nOffi cial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Jeremić . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Serbia)\r\n2 12-55501\r\nA/67/PV.27\r\nRegarding candidatures, I have been informed by \r\nthe Chairpersons of the respective regional groups of \r\nthe following. For the two vacant seats from among \r\nthe African and Asia-Pacific States, four candidates \r\nhave been designated, namely, Bhutan, Cambodia, the \r\nRepublic of Korea and Rwanda. For the one vacant seat \r\nfrom among the Latin American and Caribbean States, \r\nthere is one endorsed candidate, namely, Argentina. \r\nFor the two vacant seats fromm among the Western \r\nEuropean and other States, there are three candidates, \r\nnamely, Australia, Finland and Luxembourg. \r\nIn accordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure, \r\nwe shall now proceed to the election by secret ballot.\r\nI now give the f loor to the representative of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo on a point of order.\r\nMrs. Malenga (Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo) (spoke in French): My delegation is speaking on \r\na point of order to recall that the Charter of the United \r\nNations confers on the Security Council the principal \r\nresponsibility for maintaining international peace and \r\nsecurity. In that regard, the States that are to have seats \r\nin the Council should be peace- and justice-loving \r\ncountries.\r\nBeyond its destabilizing role in the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo, Rwanda today is a haven of \r\ntranquillity for all war criminals operating in the \r\neastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, \r\nand who are wanted by the international justice system. \r\nAs such, my delegation objects to Rwanda being elected \r\nto the Security Council as a non-permanent member. \r\nThe President: I take note of that statement, \r\nand I would like to remind the representative of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo that, pursuant to rule \r\n88 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, \r\nno representative shall interrupt the voting except on a \r\npoint of order on the actual conduct of the voting.\r\nWe shall now begin the voting process. Members \r\nare requested to remain seated until all ballots have \r\nbeen collected. \r\nBallot papers marked “A”, “B” and “C” will now be \r\ndistributed. I request representatives to use only those \r\nballot papers that have been distributed.\r\nMay I ask representatives to write on the ballot \r\npapers marked “A”, for the African and Asia-Pacific \r\nStates, the names of the two States for which they wish \r\nto vote; on the ballot papers marked “B”, for the Latin \r\nAmerican and Caribbean States, the name of the one \r\nState for which they wish to vote; and on the ballot \r\npapers marked “C”, for the Western European and \r\nother States, the name of the two States for which they \r\nwish to vote.\r\nA ballot will be declared invalid if it contains more \r\nnames of Member States from the relevant region than \r\nthe number of seats assigned to it. A ballot will also be \r\ndeclared invalid if all the names of the Member States \r\non that ballot do not belong to the relevant region. If \r\na ballot paper of a region includes both the names of \r\nMember States that belong to and that do not belong to \r\nthat region, the ballot remains valid, but only the names \r\nof the Member States that belong to the relevant region \r\nwill be counted. The names of Member States that do \r\nnot belong to that region will not be counted.\r\nAt the invitation of the President, Mr. Cabezas \r\n(Chile), Ms. Shiolashvili (Georgia), Mr. Volkwein \r\n(Germany), Mrs. Djan (Ghana), Mr. Tadome (Japan) \r\nand Ms. Lindqvist (Sweden) acted as tellers.\r\nA vote was taken by secret ballot.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 10.45 a.m. and \r\nresumed at 12.10 p.m.\r\nThe President: The result of the voting is as \r\nfollows:\r\nGroup A — African and Asian-Pacifi c States\r\nNumber of ballot papers:                                        193\r\nNumber of invalid ballots:                                          0\r\nNumber of valid ballots:                                         192\r\nAbstentions:                                                                1\r\nNumber of members voting:                                   192\r\nRequired two-thirds majority:                                128\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nRwanda                                                       148\r\nRepublic of Korea                                       116\r\nCambodia                                                      62\r\nBhutan                                                           20\r\nUnited Republic of Tanzania                            3\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo                     1\r\nGroup B — Latin American and Caribbean States\r\nNumber of ballot papers:                                         193\r\nNumber of invalid ballots:                                          1\r\nNumber of valid ballots:                                         192\r\nAbstentions:                                                                 8\r\nNumber of members voting:                                   184\r\nRequired two-thirds majority:                                    123\r\n12-55501 3\r\nA/67/PV.27\r\nWe shall now begin the voting process.\r\nBallot papers marked “A” and “B” will now be \r\ndistributed.

Ballot papers marked “A” for the African \r\nand Asia-Pacific States will be declared invalid if they \r\ncontain the name of a State other than Cambodia or the \r\nRepublic of Korea, as well as if they contain the name \r\nof more than one State.

In accordance with established practice, there \r\nis an understanding to the effect that, of the two seats \r\nallocated to the African and Asian-Pacific States, one \r\nshould be filled by an African State and one by an Asia-\r\nPacific State. As Rwanda has already been elected, the \r\nremaining seat from among the African and Asian-\r\nPacific States should be filled by an Asian-Pacific \r\nState. We shall therefore proceed to the first restricted \r\nballot.\r\nThe second round of balloting shall be restricted \r\nto those two States from among the African and Asian-\r\nPacific States that were not elected but obtained the \r\nlargest number of votes in the previous ballot, namely, \r\nCambodia and the Republic of Korea, and those two \r\nStates from among the Western European and other \r\nStates that were not elected but obtained the largest \r\nnumber of votes in the previous ballot, namely, Finland \r\nand Luxembourg. This is in accordance with rule 94 of \r\nthe rules of procedure.\r\nBefore we begin the voting process, I should like to \r\nremind members that, pursuant to rule 88 of the rules of \r\nprocedure of the General Assembly, no representative \r\nshall interrupt the voting except on a point of order on \r\nthe actual conduct of the voting.\r\n4 12-55501\r\nA/67/PV.27\r\nThe President: The following five States have thus \r\nbeen elected members of the Security Council for a \r\nmandate of two years, beginning on 1 January 2013: \r\nArgentina, Australia, Luxembourg, the Republic of \r\nKorea and Rwanda.\r\nI congratulate the States that have been elected \r\nmembers of the Security Council, and I thank the tellers \r\nfor their assistance in this election.\r\nThe General Assembly has thus concluded its \r\nconsideration of sub-item (a) of agenda item 109.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.10 p.m.\r\n"
