My Office and the Council’s \r\nBureau have intensified their contacts over the past \r\nmonth with the aim of improving coordination and the \r\noverall effectiveness of our work. President Koterec \r\nand I have discussed a number of issues of common \r\ninterest, including how to strengthen our shared \r\napproach to the sustainable development agenda and to \r\npromoting a more inclusive global economy.\r\nIn my address to the Economic and Social Council \r\nspecial ministerial meeting, one of the questions I \r\nraised was how to fortify multilateral responses to \r\ndevelopment challenges. I welcomed the Council’s \r\ncommitment to playing a more pronounced role in the \r\npost-2015 discussions, in the light of the mandate it \r\nreceived from world leaders gathered in Rio in June. The \r\nstatement issued at the end of the Ministerial Meeting \r\nreaffirmed that a more sustainable development \r\nmodel can be achieved only through a broad alliance \r\nUnited Nations A/67/PV.28\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-seventh session\r\n28th plenary meeting\r\nMonday, 22 October 2012, 3 p.m.\r\nNew York\r\nOffi cial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Jeremić . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Serbia)\r\n2 12-56130\r\nA/67/PV.28\r\nof peoples, Governments, civil society and the private \r\nsector. That view is in line with the message of the “The \r\nfuture we want”, the outcome document (resolution \r\n66/288, annex) of the United Nations Conference on \r\nSustainable Development (Rio+20). \r\nI believe that we should also encourage enhanced \r\nparticipation in our efforts by the world’s public policy \r\ninstitutes and think-tanks. I hope that we can work \r\ntogether to find ways to draw on their tremendous \r\ncapabilities more effectively so that we can benefit \r\nfrom their wisdom and experience more than has been \r\nthe case in the past.\r\nA mandate was given to the General Assembly \r\nto establish an intergovernmental process to propose \r\noptions for an effective fi nancing strategy to advance the \r\nRio+20 agenda. We were also given the responsibility \r\nof preparing a high-level forum, to be launched at the \r\nbeginning of next session. In addition, the General \r\nAssembly was tasked with establishing a working \r\ngroup to propose a list of sustainable development \r\ngoals for consideration and adoption by the plenary. \r\nThe Secretary-General’s High-level Panel of Eminent \r\nPersons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda is \r\nanother significant part of this process, as is the role \r\nof the Economic and Social Council, in accordance \r\nwith paragraphs 82 and 83 of the Rio+20 concluding \r\ndocument.\r\nLet me underline the critical importance of \r\nenhancing coordination between the Secretariat, \r\nthe Economic and Social Council and the General \r\nAssembly at this session. We need to ensure that our \r\nwork is mutually reinforcing and complementary, and \r\nthat we avoid any duplication of effort. Here, I would \r\nlike to mention Africa in particular. I deeply believe \r\nthat we must better address its special needs in the \r\ntime ahead so that we can bridge the gap effectively \r\nbetween that continent’s promise and the reality on the \r\nground. I believe that the United Nations should truly \r\nprioritize supporting African nations in unlocking their \r\nfull potential.\r\nAs I underlined in my address to last month’s \r\nEconomic and Social Council ministerial meeting, I \r\nam of the opinion that the General Assembly should \r\nplay a more pronounced role in the ongoing debate on \r\nglobal economic governance. Let me be very clear that \r\nthe intent is not to infringe on existing prerogatives \r\nbut to complement existing efforts, in order to help \r\nanswer a number of questions related to transparency, \r\ninclusiveness and legitimacy. \r\nTo that end, I would like to bring three mutually \r\nreinforcing initiatives to members’ attention. The first \r\nis the participation of the Economic and Social Council \r\nin helping to organize an informal high-level debate in \r\nthe General Assembly on the United Nations in world \r\neconomic governance, in accordance with resolution \r\n66/256. I will continue to consult with the Member \r\nStates and President Koterec on the matter and expect \r\nto reach a common position on how to proceed in the \r\nnear future.\r\nAs President, I signal my intention to build closer \r\nand more formalized relations with international \r\nfinancial institutions, such as the World Bank and the \r\nInternational Monetary Fund, as well as with the Group \r\nof Twenty (G-20). That constitutes a second aspect of \r\nthe approach I believe we should take. I would welcome \r\nthe involvement of the Economic and Social Council \r\nin this endeavour, to be coordinated with the General \r\nAssembly. Senior representatives from the G-20 will \r\ncontinue to brief the Assembly, as has been the custom \r\nin previous years.\r\nIn my view, we could all benefit from regularizing \r\nthose interactions. That is why I have proposed to launch \r\na process leading to the establishment of an effective \r\nconsultative framework between the General Assembly \r\nand various intergovernmental financial institutions \r\nand informal groupings, with a focus on the G-20.\r\nA third aspect involves holding debates and \r\nconferences on global economic issues under the \r\nauspices of the Assembly ahead of the G-20 Summit \r\nin Saint Petersburg next year. In that context, I am \r\npleased to welcome the idea of the Government of \r\nKazakhstan to coordinate the agenda of the May 2013 \r\nAstana Economic Forum with related efforts here in the \r\nUnited Nations. That annual gathering of distinguished \r\neconomists and some of the world’s most innovative \r\nand influential minds from the private sector, think-\r\ntanks and civil society is an important platform for \r\nexchanging views, experiences and best practices on \r\nmajor economic, financial and social development \r\nissues.\r\nI believe that a more dynamic Economic and Social \r\nCouncil can make an even stronger contribution to \r\nthe work of the General Assembly. The report before \r\nus today serves as an important reference point in the \r\nprocess. In accordance with resolution 61/16, I will \r\nshortly announce the appointment of co-facilitators \r\nto lead consultations on how to further strengthen the \r\nCouncil. In my view, the task is of the utmost importance \r\n12-56130 3\r\nA/67/PV.28\r\ncreation for all. In association with the International \r\nLabour Organization and the United Nations system in \r\ngeneral, the Economic and Social Council has advocated \r\nan integrated, results-based approach to addressing the \r\nemployment crisis. Specifically, it has recommended \r\nthat collective endeavours focus on productive \r\nemployment, on jobs in the green economy, particularly \r\nfor young people, and on social protection. Those \r\nrecommendations were set down in a comprehensive \r\nministerial declaration, emphasizing also the need for \r\ncollective measures to be immediately put into effect \r\nto boost productivity and generate quality jobs for the \r\nunemployed and underemployed throughout the world.\r\nAs in previous years, ministerial considerations \r\nwere based on a consultative process. National and \r\nregional views of problems related to employment \r\nwere folded into the general consideration of the job \r\ncrisis at the world level. Through preparatory meetings \r\nin Africa, the Asia-Pacific region and Latin America \r\nand the Caribbean, consultations were held with key \r\nregional actors on matters ranging from productivity \r\nto small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as \r\ninclusive growth. The consultations were a major \r\nplatform for the exchange of best practices and regional \r\nexperiences.\r\nIn addition, eight countries made voluntary \r\nnational presentations to inform the Council on the \r\nprogress achieved towards their national development \r\nobjectives and on continuing difficulties in achieving \r\ntheir employment-related objectives and aims. \r\nIn the series of high-level meetings held, the \r\n2012 Development Cooperation Forum enjoyed \r\nunprecedented levels of participation and interest. \r\nIndeed, the Forum, which has met on only three \r\noccasions, has already consolidated its position as a \r\ncritical space for dialogue on policies and technical \r\nguidance regarding development. Recent appeals to \r\nmake cooperation for development more inclusive will \r\nno doubt ensure a greater role and prominence for work \r\nof this nature.\r\nIn the series of coordination meetings, consideration \r\nwas given to the follow-up by the United Nations \r\nsystem to the Economic and Social Council ministerial \r\ndeclaration of 2011 on education. Particular emphasis \r\nwas placed on the collaborative association of United \r\nNations bodies, civil society and the private sector. An \r\nin-depth consideration also took place on the matter of \r\nthe disconnect between knowledge and aptitudes, on \r\nfor the General Assembly, especially given the mandate \r\nwe share with Economic and Social Council and the \r\nSecretariat to follow up on the outcomes of Rio+20, as \r\nwell as our common responsibilities to set the post-2015 \r\nagenda.\r\nI believe that the Assembly and the Council \r\ncan become central pillars in ongoing multilateral \r\ncooperation efforts in the related fields of sustainable \r\ndevelopment and global economic governance, in \r\nkeeping with the terms of Chapter IX of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations. By working more closely together, \r\nwe can help further promote the role of the United \r\nNations in setting the world on a more secure, equitable \r\nand prosperous path.\r\nI give the fl oor to the Vice-President of the Economic \r\nand Social Council, His Excellency Mr. Luis-Alfonso \r\nde Alba, to introduce the report of the Economic and \r\nSocial Council.\r\nMr. De Alba (Mexico), Vice-President of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council (spoke in Spanish): Allow \r\nme to thank you, Sir, for your introductory remarks to \r\nour debate on the agenda item before us. Your words, \r\nin particular your readiness to cooperate very closely \r\nwith the Economic and Social Council, are without \r\ndoubt very welcome. All members of the Economic and \r\nSocial Council consider it to be essential, as you said, \r\nthat we work together and pool our efforts, especially \r\nin developing the mandates with which we have been \r\nentrusted by meetings recently held, particularly that \r\nof the United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (Rio+20). You may rest assured that all \r\nmembers of the Economic and Social Council and the \r\nBureau will work as closely as possible with you.\r\nThe report that I have submitted for 2012 (A/67/3) \r\nreveals a year of productive work and a wide range of \r\nactivities. At the same time, it has also been a year of \r\npreparation for tackling new challenges under the able \r\nleadership of Ambassador Koterec of Slovakia. I would \r\nlike on this occasion simply to draw attention to some \r\nof the most prominent aspects of our work during the \r\nperiod. \r\nFirst, I would recall that, as the principal organ \r\nof the United Nations responsible for development \r\nmatters, the Economic and Social Council has served \r\nas a platform in 2012 for over 40 ministers, high-level \r\npolitical policymakers, eminent academics, leading \r\nbusinessmen and members of civil society to share \r\nviews and know-how regarding opportunities for job \r\n4 12-56130\r\nA/67/PV.28\r\nthe one hand, and the needs of the labour market, on \r\nthe other. \r\nIn the Council’s coordination meetings, consideration \r\nwas also given to the follow-up process for the Monterrey \r\nConsensus and the Doha Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment. It was agreed to avoid overlap between \r\nthis process and the outcomes of Rio+20 in terms of \r\nfinancing for development. Likewise, a special meeting \r\nwas held on innovative mechanisms of development \r\nfinancing. That meeting concluded by highlighting \r\nthe need to consolidate global endeavours through \r\nspecial funds that could extend existing initiatives and \r\nintroduce new, innovative mechanisms, such as green \r\nvouchers, without duplicating efforts. \r\nDuring the series of meetings on operational \r\nactivities, preparations were completed for the \r\nAssembly’s quadrennial comprehensive policy review \r\nof operational activities for development of the United \r\nNations system. In this regard, consideration was given \r\nto the following matters, among others: assessment of the \r\nfunding of the United Nations system; the establishment \r\nof better instruments to enhance coherence; the \r\nstrengthening of the resident coordinator system; and \r\nthe enhancement of the efficacy of entrepreneurial \r\nactivities. This has given rise to a very solid analytical \r\nfoundation on which to base efforts to ensure that the \r\nwork of the Assembly during the current session can be \r\npursued in the most substantive manner possible. \r\nThe series of meetings on humanitarian matters \r\nfocused, as in earlier years, on the most complex \r\nemergencies occurring around the world and on \r\nsolutions to improve responses to future crises. As \r\nwe all remember, that series of meetings this year was \r\nnotable for its emphasis on the transition from aid to \r\ndevelopment, particularly in addressing the challenges \r\nof the Sahel region. Many participants drew attention \r\nto the need to maintain the f low of international aid \r\nat a level above and beyond what is needed in terms \r\nof an immediate response in that region. Specifically, \r\ndevelopment assistance in the region must encourage \r\ngrowth and promote stability and shared prosperity for \r\nall. \r\nIn the series of general meetings, the Council \r\nadopted measures with respect to a very wide range of \r\nissues on the basis of reports prepared by the functional \r\nand regional commissions, non-governmental \r\norganizations, the Committee of Experts on \r\nInternational Cooperation in Tax Matters, and various \r\nspecialized bodies and experts. Allow me to briefly \r\ndraw attention to three concrete outcomes of that series \r\nof meetings. \r\nFirst, a new plan of action was adopted to ensure \r\nthat the entire system can make progress on gender \r\nequality and the advancement of women. \r\nWith respect to the least developed countries, the \r\nCouncil paved the way for follow-up to the Istanbul \r\nProgramme of Action and supported the inclusion of the \r\nRepublic of South Sudan on the list of least developed \r\ncountries and the removal of Vanuatu from that same \r\nlist. The Council urgently appeals to the General \r\nAssembly to promptly adopt measures with respect to \r\nthese recommendations. \r\nIn addition, particular attention was given to aid \r\neffectiveness and policy coherence in South Sudan \r\nand Haiti, emphasizing efforts to ensure commitment, \r\ntransparency and accountability among those involved \r\nin the development of those countries. At the same \r\ntime, the Council focused on strengthening its own \r\ncollaborative relationships, recognizing an additional \r\n286 non-governmental organizations as consultative \r\nentities.\r\nThe Economic and Social Council must continue to \r\nbuild on the foundations of its 2012 achievements, taking \r\ninto account the challenges inherent in sustainable \r\ndevelopment, including the integration of the three \r\nprincipal pillars of sustainable development. The United \r\nNations Conference on Sustainable Development \r\nre-emphasized the mandate of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil as one of the principal organs responsible \r\nfor the integrated and coordinated follow-up of the \r\noutcomes of all United Nations conferences and \r\nsummits in the economic, social, environmental and \r\nassociated fields. It also recognized — and I think \r\nthis is particularly important — that the Council has \r\nmade a decisive contribution to the integration of the \r\nthree pillars of sustainable development in a balanced \r\nfashion. As you stated, Sir, this must be further pursued \r\nby the Assembly. \r\nThis renewed and strengthened mandate requires \r\nthe Economic and Social Council to build its capacity \r\nto successfully integrate the social, environmental \r\nand economic agendas and to convene all relevant \r\nactors. It has therefore requested the Secretary-\r\nGeneral — and, through him, Member States and \r\nother relevant actors — to submit proposals on its \r\nstrengthening, particularly of its methods of work. \r\n12-56130 5\r\nA/67/PV.28\r\nLastly, allow me to state that the Bureau of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council welcomes the unfailing \r\ncooperation of Governments and other associated \r\nactors within the United Nations system that support \r\nthese reform processes and who await concrete \r\nproposals, having repeatedly affirmed their readiness \r\nto immediately undertake significant efforts for a \r\ncomprehensive reform and the construction of the \r\nfuture we all want.\r\nThe President: I give the f loor to the observer of \r\nthe European Union.\r\nMr. Beviglia Zampetti (European Union): I have \r\nthe honour to speak on behalf of the European Union \r\n(EU) and its member States. The acceding country \r\nCroatia; the candidate countries the former Yugoslav \r\nRepublic of Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia; \r\nthe countries of the Stabilization and Association \r\nProcess and potential candidates Albania and Bosnia \r\nand Herzegovina; as well as Ukraine, the Republic \r\nof Moldova and Georgia align themselves with this \r\ndeclaration.\r\nWe would like to thank the Vice-President of \r\nthe Economic and Social Council for introducing \r\nthe Council’s report (A/67/3). We would also like to \r\nacknowledge with gratitude the support provided by \r\nthe Secretariat to the Council this year. The European \r\nUnion and its member States commend the work of \r\nthe Council during the reporting period and recognize \r\nthe committed leadership of its President, Mr. Miloš \r\nKoterec of Slovakia, and of the Bureau.\r\nIn the next few weeks and months, we will be \r\nactively engaged in the review of resolution 61/16 on \r\nthe strengthening of the Economic and Social Council. \r\nIn that regard, this statement will focus on three \r\npoints. First, the EU is encouraged by the progress \r\nin the revitalization of the Council. The Development \r\nCooperation Forum and the annual ministerial review, \r\nfor example, have become important elements of \r\nthe Council’s substantive session. Secondly, while \r\nwe primarily need to build upon that progress, there \r\nis room for improvement in many areas in order to \r\nmake the Council more effective and efficient in its \r\nworking methods. Thirdly, the relevance of the Council \r\nultimately depends on our own willingness to make it \r\nwork.\r\nThe EU and its member States would like to \r\nacknowledge the comprehensive preparations carried \r\nout for the substantive session of the Council, including \r\nthrough the organization of events such as the joint \r\nmeeting with the Peacebuilding Commission and the \r\ndialogue with youth representatives on jobs held during \r\nthe year. We equally welcome the work on employment \r\nundertaken by the Council at its current session. \r\nWe appreciate the role of the Council in fostering \r\ndialogue and helping to forge converging views and a \r\ncoherent policy vision on the follow-up to the United \r\nNations Conference on Sustainable Development and, \r\nin particular, the contribution of the Development \r\nCooperation Forum to promoting the broader post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda, especially on issues related to \r\ndevelopment effectiveness, mutual accountability and \r\ndevelopment-oriented partnerships.\r\nThe Economic and Social Council is an important \r\nand, in some respects, essential institutional home \r\nfor our debates and deliberations. It provides us with \r\na useful mechanism for oversight and coordination of \r\nthe crucial United Nations work in the economic, social \r\nand environmental fields, including its operational \r\nactivities for development. The Council also has a \r\nstrong mandate to contribute to improved coherence \r\nand coordination and a balanced integration of the three \r\ndimensions of sustainable development and of the long-\r\nterm perspective regarding policymaking. We should \r\ncollectively commit to following up on these efforts \r\nover time.\r\nHowever, there is always room for improvement. \r\nThe Economic and Social Council can build on its \r\nconvening power at the international level on global \r\nchallenges, trends and emerging issues. The Council \r\nhas a unique position as the main body for system-wide \r\ncoordination and for the follow-up to and implementation \r\nof the outcomes of United Nations conferences and \r\nsummits in the economic, social, environmental and \r\nrelated fields. The Council should strive to ensure \r\nbetter coherence in the way the system of subsidiary \r\nbodies, funds and programmes is able to respond to the \r\nmandates emanating from those outcomes. It should \r\nensure a coherent policy vision for the Rio+20 follow-\r\nup and the broader post-2015 development agenda, \r\ncontributing to convergence and coordination and \r\navoiding the overlapping and duplication of processes. \r\nMoreover, the multi-stakeholder nature of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council is one of its most important \r\nfeatures and something we should capitalize on. The \r\nCouncil has to be a window to realities outside the \r\nhalls of the United Nations. The further strengthening \r\nof the Council’s interactions with all stakeholders will \r\n6 12-56130\r\nA/67/PV.28\r\ncertainly improve public perception not only of that \r\nbody, but also of the United Nations as a whole, and \r\nincrease its ability to play a relevant role in global \r\naffairs. The implementation of sustainable development \r\nis a multi-stakeholder exercise that the Council should \r\nalso better reflect in its working methods. \r\nUltimately, as we endeavour to review the \r\nimplementation of relevant provisions related to the \r\nrevitalization of the Council, it is our firm belief that \r\nthe Council will be as strong and as relevant as we want \r\nit to be. As one participant stated during the special \r\nministerial meeting of the Council in September, \r\n“we get the ECOSOC we deserve”. The EU and its \r\nmember States stand ready to actively participate, \r\ntogether with all our partners, in the reflection on how \r\nto further improve the Economic and Social Council’s \r\neffectiveness.\r\nMr. Pisarevich (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): \r\nWe thank you, Mr. President, for your introductory \r\nremarks and the Vice-President of the Economic and \r\nSocial Council for his comprehensive introduction of \r\nthe report of the Council (A/67/3). \r\nBelarus commends the activities of the Economic \r\nand Social Council and notes the innovative approaches \r\nin its work. The Council remains the key policy \r\nplatform at the global level for crafting strategies for \r\ncollective action in the area of global development. \r\nThe Development Cooperation Forum reaffirmed \r\nthat fact. That event made it possible to undertake an \r\nanalysis of current trends in international cooperation \r\nin the context of the outcomes of the United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20).\r\nWe view the Council as the coordinator for \r\npractical implementation of the decisions of the Rio \r\nConference in order to reach a global transition to \r\nsustainable development. We must not let the consensus \r\nachieved in Brazil be buried by endless argument over \r\nprocedural issues. After all, that in principle would \r\ndelay substantive discussion by the international \r\ncommunity on problematic issues and the formulation \r\nof the post-2015 agenda.\r\nWe believe that the Council’s efforts at \r\nmacroeconomic coordination seek to ensure sustainable \r\nand balanced growth of the world economy. The \r\nCouncil must act to ensure full compliance with the \r\nprinciples of free and fair trade, which preclude the \r\nuse of various protectionist measures and unilateral \r\neconomic sanctions. Furthermore, the Council must \r\nwork to ensure that the implementation of the concepts \r\nof sustainable development and the green economy do \r\nnot aggravate the existing development gap between \r\ndeveloping and developed countries, strengthen the \r\ntechnological dependency of developing countries \r\non developed countries, reduce a country’s national \r\ncapacity for choosing the most effective strategies for \r\nsustainable development, or create new dividing lines \r\nor barriers. \r\nThe work of the Council’s 2012 substantive session \r\nreaffirmed the efforts of Member States to continue to \r\nrely on the mechanisms of the United Nations in order \r\nto address pressing social and economic challenges. We \r\nwelcome the new forms of work that were undertaken \r\nat the session. Specifically, we note the dialogue of \r\nmember States with the management of the primary \r\noperational funds and programmes on the issue of \r\npreparing for a quadrennial review of the operational \r\nactivities of the United Nations with the presidents \r\nof the regional commissions of the United Nations on \r\nprogramme activities, and on the holding of side events \r\non issues that are important for member States. \r\nThe holding of thematic events on medium-income \r\ncountries and on assistance to talented youth have \r\ngiven additional impetus to discussing the forms  of, \r\nand prospects for, cooperation in those areas between \r\nthe members and the agencies of the United Nations \r\nsystem. We support the continuing practice of holding \r\nhigh-level meetings of the Council by inviting the \r\nleaders of the Bretton Woods institutions, the World \r\nTrade Organization and the International Labour \r\nOrganization on the most pressing problems of the \r\nglobal economy and finances. Accordingly, we expect \r\nthat those discussions, taking place in the context of a \r\nhigh degree of global economic and fi nancial instability, \r\nwill be aimed at crystallizing practical steps to ensure \r\nsustainable economic development.\r\nWe look forward to the proposals of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on strengthening the Council and improving \r\nits working methods in the light of the views of its \r\nMembers.\r\nWe call on all interested States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations to contribute to strengthening the \r\nEconomic and Social Council. We cannot allow the \r\nreform of the Council to be turned into an endless \r\nrenovation that one can only suspend but never bring to \r\na successful conclusion. Today’s realities leave no time \r\nfor such an experiment. We all need a strong Economic \r\nand Social Council right now.\r\n12-56130 7\r\nA/67/PV.28\r\nMs. Prince (United States of America): The United \r\nStates values the Economic and Social Council as an \r\nessential platform for exchanging ideas, learning from \r\none another’s national experiences and sharpening \r\nour collective thinking about a next-generation global \r\ndevelopment agenda. Strengthening the Council has \r\nbeen a long-standing item on our shared agenda. \r\nIn the run-up to the United Nations Conference on \r\nSustainable Development (Rio+20), we began a renewed \r\nconversation about our multilateral institutions and \r\nhow we can better adapt them to meet the challenges \r\nand opportunities before us as a global community. \r\nThe global development landscape is changing \r\ndramatically. New drivers of wealth coexist with \r\nchronic impediments to prosperity. By 2030, the world \r\npopulation will grow to 8.3 billion people, who will \r\nrightly have rising expectations for their future and \r\nwho will make increasing demands on our world’s \r\nresources. A growing youth demographic will coexist \r\nwith the increasing age of most countries’ populations. \r\nUrbanization will accelerate, and new technologies \r\nwill continue to create opportunities for innovation and \r\naction. \r\nOur international architecture for development \r\nwill have to evolve apace. It will need to become \r\nmore responsive to twenty-first-century development \r\ndynamics and what drives development decisions \r\nand outcomes, including by better mobilizing and \r\ntargeting existing multilateral expertise, resources and \r\ncapacities. It will need to explore ways to reconcile the \r\nUnited Nations system’s diverse authorities with greater \r\nincentives for coherence. It will also need renewed \r\ncommitment to evidence-based decision-making, as \r\nwell as monitoring and evaluation that are responsive \r\nto the results that we are trying to achieve. Moreover, \r\nit will finally need a degree of f lexibility, especially \r\nbecause we are just at the beginning of our deliberations \r\non elaborating a post-2015 development agenda. \r\nThe Economic and Social Council has essential \r\ntools and should be a central venue for examining \r\nthose issues. Its thematic breadth and responsibility for \r\npolicy deliberation, coordination and oversight make it \r\nan important forum for a new approach that emphasizes \r\nconvergence, value added and results. For example, a \r\nkey issue such as women’s roles and sustainable rural \r\ndevelopment could be established as a thread that \r\nruns through all parts of the Council’s system, from \r\nthe spring meetings of the Bretton Woods institutions \r\nto the Commission on the Status of Women and the \r\nCommission on Science and Technology. \r\nWe know that we must cooperate in new ways \r\nthat span the existing development architecture and \r\nbridge institutional barriers. That includes partnerships \r\nwith the private sector, other multilateral entities and \r\nnon-governmental organizations, as well as civil \r\nsociety and local actors. \r\nOverall, the Economic and Social Council and its \r\nfunctional commissions and other subsidiary bodies \r\ncan provide a practical forum for integrated policy \r\ndebate and support. That will require strengthened \r\nworking methods, more responsive agenda-setting \r\nand a commitment to ongoing innovation. The high-\r\nlevel political forum agreed at Rio can also build on \r\nthe strengths of the Economic and Social Council \r\nsystem. Overall, we need to modernize institutional \r\narrangements to be focused, serious, credible and \r\nresponsive to citizens and leaders alike. Above all, we \r\nneed to deliver results to people around the world who \r\nrightly are demanding them. \r\nFinally, the United States would like to take this \r\nopportunity to express its appreciation for the granting \r\nof the United Nations Population Award earlier this \r\nyear to a pioneering advocate for reproductive health, \r\nMs. Adrienne Germain. Ms. Germain has been in the \r\nforefront of the field of women’s rights and family \r\nplanning since the 1970s. She was a member of the United \r\nStates delegations to the Fourth World Conference \r\non Women in Beijing in 1995 and the International \r\nConference on Population and Development in Cairo in \r\n1994, and has served as a civil society adviser in recent \r\nyears to the United States delegation to the United \r\nNations Commission on Population and Development. \r\nShe is well known to our Mission and others in New \r\nYork, and we are gratified that the contributions of this \r\nprominent American in this important field have been \r\nacknowledged with this award.\r\nMr. O’Brien (India): I am privileged to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly. I bring greetings from India. We \r\nare in the midst of our biggest festival of the year in \r\nBengal, the state of India where I live, and on behalf of \r\nthe people of India and the people of Bengal, I would \r\nlike to wish everyone here in the Hall a happy and \r\nprosperous Durga Puja.\r\nAt the United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (Rio+20) in June this year, the global \r\ncommunity made a solemn promise to craft a future that \r\n8 12-56130\r\nA/67/PV.28\r\nchampion of gender rights, female emancipation and \r\ngirls’ education, wrote: \r\n“How sad! The country whose male population is \r\nunkind, unreligious and unaware of the distinction \r\nbetween the good and the evil, and does not care \r\nabout justice and fairness, and where abiding the \r\nrituals is the chief preoccupation of religion, should \r\nnot give birth to girls!”\r\nThat philosophy, which Vidyasagar explained in \r\nthe 1850s, 150 years ago, anticipated the enlightenment \r\nof the MDGs. The MDGs represent the most cherished \r\nchapter of multilateralism. At Rio+20, we discussed \r\npractically every aspect of human endeavour and came \r\nup with a blueprint for action on sustainable development \r\nthat rightfully integrates economic growth with social \r\ninclusion and environmental sustainability.\r\nAs we sit down to fashion the sustainable \r\ndevelopment goals, we must do so with a clear idea that \r\nthey would form the crux of the post-2015 development \r\nagenda. Dealing with challenges related to poverty, \r\nfood, energy and livelihood issues should be our \r\npriority. The MDG framework has given us valuable \r\nlessons as to what works and what does not work. \r\nThere is little value in trying to reinvent the wheel. The \r\nframework of MDG goals should be replicated in the \r\nnew set of goals.\r\nOur commitment to the MDGs and to Rio+20 \r\nis unwavering, but the global economic situation \r\ndoes not seem to favour us. Slackened growth, high \r\ninflation — particularly food inflation — a mounting \r\ndebt burden and high youth unemployment are \r\nundercutting the development gains made in developing \r\ncountries. It is therefore of fundamental importance \r\nthat we, as a global community, be able to put the world \r\neconomy back on track. Nothing can be more helpful \r\nas we do our best to put more resources into and bring \r\ngreater focus onto our development goals.\r\nWe must also redouble our efforts to push for urgent \r\nprogress on the Doha Development Round. Those who \r\nprofess that more trade and not aid is the answer to the \r\ndevelopment gaps of our era need to put their words \r\ninto action. Shibboleths alone cannot do it. It is equally \r\nimperative to fashion a comprehensive and balanced \r\noutcome to climate-change negotiations, based on the \r\nprinciples of common but differentiated responsibility \r\nand equity.\r\nSouth-South cooperation must also contribute, \r\nand it must be allowed to grow within its own space \r\nwould truly and really — and not just in some clichéd \r\nway — belong to all, to each one of us, to every child of \r\nMother Earth. It was a promise to the marginalized to \r\ndeliver a life of dignity, a life of hope. It was a pledge to \r\nfight poverty as the greatest global challenge.\r\nWith just three years to go to the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) finish line, where do \r\nwe stand? The task at hand remains a daunting one. \r\nMore than a billion people in developing countries \r\ncontinue to live in extreme poverty, hunger and \r\nhopeless desperation. We need to do much more. About \r\nthe MDGs, we can take some comfort in collectively \r\nhaving made progress on poverty eradication, primary \r\neducation, gender equality and sanitation. However, \r\nwhen we introspect, our record on maternal mortality, \r\ninfant mortality and malnutrition remains a matter of \r\ndeep and abiding concern. \r\nWe will have a planet that is more populous in the \r\ntwenty-first century than ever before in human history. \r\nYet, are we doing enough to harness that demographic \r\ndividend? In India, we have pursued the path of \r\ninclusive growth for achieving poverty eradication. \r\nWe have in fact brought down poverty numbers \r\nsignificantly as compared with the 1990 levels, but we \r\ncontinue to be challenged by more than 300 million \r\npeople living below the poverty line of $1.25 a day. \r\nThat number, 300 million people, is about equivalent \r\nto the population of the United States, which should \r\nemphasize the enormity of the crisis and the moral \r\nobligation that still confronts us.\r\nIn primary education, India has achieved a near \r\n100 per cent enrolment. In part, that has been a result of \r\nour Right to Education Act, which makes eight years of \r\nschooling a legal right that the Indian State must ensure \r\nto every citizen. The challenge now is to focus on the \r\nquality of learning in our schools and to further narrow \r\nthe gender gap in secondary and primary schooling. \r\nOver the past decade, we have for the first time in our \r\nhistory added more female literates than males, an \r\nachievement that we are justifiably proud of.\r\nHowever, India is conscious of the health and \r\nsocial development gaps that have yet to be addressed. \r\nOur commitment to tackling infant and maternal \r\nmortality and augmenting women’s empowerment \r\nremains absolute and unflinching. In fact, it is part \r\nof our nation-building tradition. As Ishwar Chandra \r\nVidyasagar, one of the foremost minds of nineteenth-\r\ncentury Bengal, a pioneer of modern India and a \r\n12-56130 9\r\nA/67/PV.28\r\nWith our collaborative effort and collective will, we \r\ncan do it. We can fashion a better world for ourselves, \r\nand as a legacy for our children and succeeding \r\ngenerations. Acting multilaterally, though institutions \r\nand agencies such as the United Nations, we represent \r\nhope for millions across the world. This is a hope that \r\nseeks only basic necessities of life. This is a hope we \r\ncannot betray.\r\nAs the great Bengali poet Rabindranath Tagore, \r\nthe first Asian to win the Nobel Prize for literature, \r\neloquently put it: “I slept and dreamt that life was joy. I \r\nawoke and saw that life was service. I acted and behold, \r\nservice was joy.” Let us, as a global community, awaken \r\nto service and to joy. \r\nMr. Alotaibi (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): My \r\ndelegation is pleased to participate in discussing one of \r\nthe most important items on the agenda of the General \r\nAssembly, as reflected in the report of the Economic \r\nand Social Council (A/67/3). At the outset, I would \r\nlike to commend the contents of the report on the \r\neffective contributions and activities undertaken by the \r\nEconomic and Social Council in the past session.\r\nThe suffocating financial crisis that the world has \r\nwitnessed in recent years is still casting its shadow \r\nover the global economy. Abject poverty, increased \r\nunemployment and a host of other issues stand between \r\nmany developing countries and their achievement of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. All those challenges \r\nmake us more determined than ever to support the \r\nwork of the Economic and Social Council, develop \r\nits mechanisms and improve its competence as the \r\nsupreme international organ concerned with achieving \r\nsocioeconomic development, supporting the welfare of \r\npeoples and raising their standards of living. Given the \r\nfundamental role that the Council plays in fostering \r\nsustainable development, I would like to emphasize the \r\nimportance of strengthening the partnership between \r\nit and the other principal organs of the United Nations, \r\nparticularly the General Assembly.\r\nThe international community currently bears \r\nthe huge responsibility of addressing socioeconomic \r\nchallenges. It is therefore important to emphasize the \r\nneed to translate the results of the United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development into a \r\ntangible reality, especially with regard to sustainable \r\ndevelopment, the environment, climate change and \r\nthe integration of economic visions in a manner that \r\nwill help United States to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nand its own ecosystem and in accordance with its \r\nown principles. It cannot and must not be a substitute \r\nfor North-South cooperation. The two processes are \r\ncomplementary and, as a world community, we have to \r\navoid limiting ourselves to either-or choices.\r\nAn issue of crucial importance today for sustainable \r\ndevelopment is the deficit of global governance. Without \r\naddressing the issue of global governance, we cannot \r\nrestructure the twenty-first century comity of nations \r\nas an equitable matrix that serves the cause of all. The \r\ndecisions of the self-selected few can hardly provide the \r\nsolutions we seek for the many. It is crucial, therefore, \r\nthat developing countries be given due voice and \r\nparticipation in the decision-making structures of the \r\nglobal economic and financial institutions, especially \r\nthe Bretton Woods institutions. \r\nHere at the United Nations, it is critical that we \r\nmove urgently on reform of the Security Council \r\nby expanding it in both categories, permanent and \r\nnon-permanent, to revitalize the General Assembly and \r\nstrengthen the Economic and Social Council.\r\nThe Convention on Biological Diversity, born \r\nout of the Earth Summit, remains a seminal global \r\ncompact on development. This past week in India, we \r\nsuccessfully concluded the Eleventh Conference of the \r\nParties to the Convention on Biological Diversity. We \r\nhope that its outcome will help us achieve our collective \r\ncommitments. I wish to thank all participants for their \r\nsupport in making that event a success.\r\nMr. Charles (Trinidad and Tobago), Vice-President, \r\ntook the Chair.\r\nIn the developing countries, feeding our people \r\nand providing them with sustenance is a challenge \r\nthat we grapple with every day. We are hopeful that \r\nour biodiversity resources and conservation efforts \r\nwill help us find new solutions to food security and \r\nlivelihood issues. \r\nSpace scientists call our Earth the “Goldilocks \r\nplanet” — not too hot, not too cold, just right for life. \r\nIndeed, in keeping with that imagery, humankind’s \r\nevolution and prodigious attainments over the \r\nmillennia that have passed have been nothing short \r\nof a fairy tale — a true miracle. True, our challenges \r\nare many, but given what we have achieved; given the \r\ndiseases and scourges we have beaten back; and given \r\nthe disasters and calamities we have learned to protect \r\nourselves against, what we are left with is, frankly, only \r\nthe last mile.\r\n10 12-56130\r\nA/67/PV.28\r\nAchieving the three pillars of sustainable \r\ndevelopment — economic, social and \r\nenvironmental — requires our countries to adopt \r\ncomprehensive national policies to create a climate \r\nconducive to supporting those pillars and enacting \r\nappropriate legislation for their implementation. That \r\ninvestment in our countries’ capabilities will enable us \r\nto foster common international economic cooperation \r\nin confronting the challenges of our times.\r\nThe State of Kuwait, based on its firm belief in \r\nthe concept of international partnership, is helping \r\ndeveloping countries to overcome the obstacles and \r\ndifficulties they face by financing economic and \r\ndevelopment projects to improve their economies.\r\nIn recognition of the clear underpinnings of \r\nour foreign policy, which is based on fostering and \r\nstrengthening relations among States in order to achieve \r\nan ideal model for international partnership, built upon \r\nmutual respect and common interests, the Kuwait Fund \r\nfor Arab Economic Development has provided more \r\nthan $18 billion in assistance over the past five decades \r\nin the form of grants, technical support and concessional \r\nloans to more than 100 developing and least developed \r\ncountries to help them achieve sustainable development.\r\nThe State of Kuwait has continued to launch \r\ninitiatives calling for the establishment of specialized \r\nfunds covering different parts of the world in order \r\nto address economic, educational, environmental, \r\nhealth and development issues. It also contributes to \r\nresolving issues of unemployment, food security and \r\nother challenges faced by the peoples of developing \r\ncountries. The latest such initiative was launched by His \r\nHighness Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, \r\nAmir of the State of Kuwait, at the first summit of \r\nthe Asia Cooperation Dialogue, hosted by the State \r\nof Kuwait from 15 to 17 October, to establish a fund \r\nto finance development projects in non-Arab Asian \r\ncountries with $2 billion in capital. His Highness also \r\nannounced that Kuwait will contribute $300 million \r\nto help the least developed countries in Asia achieve \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. In addition, His \r\nHighness announced Kuwait’s readiness to join the \r\nAsian Development Bank, based on his interest in \r\nincreasing Kuwait’s cooperation with Asian countries.\r\nThe State of Kuwait attaches special importance \r\nto the activities of the Economic and Social Council \r\nand commits itself fully to the Council’s decisions and \r\npolicies, and to those of its subsidiary committees, to \r\ncoordinate and strengthen economic cooperation with a \r\nview to advancing the development goals, in particular \r\nthe eradication of poverty, combating serious and \r\ncommunicable diseases, and achieving sustainable \r\ndevelopment. Furthermore, the State of Kuwait has \r\nnever spared any effort in supporting the work of \r\ninternational and regional institutions involved in the \r\nfield of development to enable them to carry out their \r\nfunctions by providing them with all kinds of ongoing \r\nassistance and support to help developing countries and \r\nthe least developed countries achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nBased on its belief in the important role of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council, the State of Kuwait \r\npresented its candidature for membership of the Council \r\nfor the term 2013-2015. The election is to be held on \r\n31 October. We hope to receive the support and backing \r\nof Member States in order to enable us to proceed with \r\nour efforts in the economic, social and environmental \r\nfields through the international organ responsible for \r\nintegrating and coordinating international activities in \r\nthose fields.\r\nMr. Rahman (Bangladesh): Allow me to begin by \r\nthanking the Ambassador of Mexico, who in his capacity \r\nas Vice-President of the Council presented the report \r\nof the Council (A/67/3) on behalf of its President. We \r\ncommend the work of the Council and the leadership of \r\nAmbassador Miloš Koterec in steering the proceedings \r\nof the Council during the reporting year.\r\nOver the years, the Economic and Social Council \r\nhas played an important role in advancing a concerted \r\napproach to the global development agenda. It strives to \r\npromote an integrated and coordinated implementation \r\nof the commitments made in the major United Nations \r\nconferences and summits. The two innovative functions \r\nentrusted to that body — namely, the holding of the \r\nannual ministerial review and the biennial Development \r\nCooperation Forum — are considered to be useful in \r\nproviding substantive inputs and thereby contributing \r\nto a more effective follow-up. \r\nThrough these mechanisms, the Council is able to \r\nassess national and international efforts to achieve the \r\ndevelopment goals. It is now possible for the Council to \r\ntake a deeper look at all the cross-cutting areas of the \r\noutcomes of the major United Nations global events in \r\neconomic and social areas. The focus of the most recent \r\nannual ministerial review — the eradication of poverty, \r\nwhich is one of the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs) — has indeed facilitated an in-depth analysis \r\nof the progress made and remaining challenges in \r\n12-56130 11\r\nA/67/PV.28\r\nremains an important source of development financing \r\nfor the developing countries, especially for the LDCs. \r\nThere is a need for enhanced and predictable official \r\ndevelopment assistance, aligned with the priorities of \r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nAt the International Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment, held in Monterrey, the global community \r\nagreed that our collective goal was to eradicate poverty, \r\nachieve sustained economic growth and promote \r\nsustainable development. The commitment made in \r\nMonterrey and reiterated in Doha needs to be fulfilled \r\nurgently. The ODA commitment of 0.7 per cent of gross \r\nnational income must be met at the earliest possible \r\ndate.\r\nIt is important that the General Assembly and \r\nthe Economic and Social Council look into the \r\nmost appropriate modalities for follow-up to major \r\nconferences and summits, with a view to promoting \r\ncoherent, coordinated and integrated United Nations \r\nactions in that regard. Poverty eradication must continue \r\nto be the foremost priority of the post-2015 global \r\ndevelopment agenda. At Rio+20, it was unequivocally \r\nrecognized as the greatest global challenge. Our work \r\non the quadrennial comprehensive policy review and \r\nsustainable development goals must be anchored in \r\nthose imperatives. We should attach due importance \r\nto considering such issues as education, health care, \r\nemployment and access to water and sanitation while \r\ndrafting the sustainable development goals in the \r\ncoming days. In fact, all the unmet MDGs should be \r\nsubsumed within the future sustainable development \r\ngoals.\r\nClimate change is having a serious impact on many \r\ncountries and even threatening their existence. Its \r\nimpact is undermining the development efforts of many \r\ncountries. The United Nations Framework Convention \r\non Climate Change could not assure us of robust and \r\nimmediate actions on its decisions, including in the \r\nareas of adaptation and mitigation. It is high time that \r\na global, comprehensive and ambitious agreement on \r\nclimate change be reached, in line with and reflecting \r\nthe Kyoto Protocol. The agreement should include \r\nnot only provisions on greenhouse gas emissions, the \r\nprinciple of common but differentiated responsibilities, \r\nand burden-sharing, but also the concerns of climate \r\nmigrants, the transfer of green technologies, and \r\nprovisions of the Green Climate Fund, among others, \r\nfor adaptation and mitigation purposes. We must \r\nfighting that global scourge. It is timely as we approach \r\nthe deadline for achieving the MDGs.\r\nWith all that good work being done, we still believe \r\nthat there is room for further improvement in the \r\nfunctioning of the Economic and Social Council. We can \r\nand must work to make the Council the central United \r\nNations organ for the coordination and supervision of \r\ndevelopment activities, as was originally envisaged \r\nby the United Nations Charter and subsequently \r\nstrengthened by various United Nations resolutions, \r\nparticularly resolution 61/16. In that regard, the recently \r\nheld United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (Rio+20) provided considerable inputs \r\nwhich can help bring about the necessary reform of that \r\norgan. \r\nThe United Nations conferences and summits held \r\nsince the 1990s have generated an extraordinary global \r\nawareness of the need to pursue sustained, inclusive \r\nand equitable development. It is a widely shared view \r\nthat full and effective implementation of the outcomes \r\nof those events could significantly contribute towards \r\nachieving the cherished objective of prosperity for all. \r\nAs we engage in the annual review of the outcome \r\nand implementation of major global conferences, we \r\nneed to take stock of the current situation, evaluate \r\nhow much progress we have been able to achieve, and \r\nidentify what more is required to implement them fully. \r\nWhile there has been progress in several areas, it is \r\nclear that a lot remains to be achieved. Certainly, there \r\nis a need for resolute action to move the development \r\nagenda forward. The global economic uncertainties \r\nshould not become an excuse for inaction. The \r\nEconomic and Social Council has an important role to \r\nplay in that regard.\r\nThe ongoing global economic and financial \r\nchallenges pose serious impediments to peace, security \r\nand development. Unemployment, volatile food and \r\nenergy prices erode the policy space for developing \r\ncountries in advancing economic development efforts. \r\nThat has further undermined the limited capacity of \r\nthe poorer countries to cope with external shocks and \r\nvulnerabilities. \r\nIt is now evident that many developing countries, \r\nparticularly the least developed countries (LDCs), will \r\nnot be able to meet MDG targets within the timeline. A \r\nkey element for not being able to realize those minimum \r\ndevelopment aspirations is the gap in development \r\nfinancing. Official development assistance (ODA) \r\n12 12-56130\r\nA/67/PV.28\r\nleast developed countries, through capacity-building \r\ninitiatives conducted through the Malaysian Technical \r\nCooperation Programme and through other similar \r\ninitiatives undertaken in conjunction with development \r\npartners, including the United Nations.\r\nMalaysia is grateful for and elated by the \r\nselection of the Federation of Reproductive Health \r\nAssociations of Malaysia as the recipient for the 2012 \r\nUnited Nations Population Award in the institutional \r\ncategory, in recognition of the Federation’s outstanding \r\nachievements in advocating reproductive health \r\nand advancing the health and status of women and \r\nchildren in Malaysia.The Federation has played an \r\nimportant role in bringing visibility to family planning \r\nnot only in Malaysia but also in other parts of Asia. \r\nIt has also demonstrated a high level of commitment \r\nto improving the lives of disadvantaged communities, \r\nincluding refugees, sex workers, and transsexual and \r\nmarginalized youth in juvenile homes and orphanages. \r\nGiven these outstanding contributions, the recognition \r\nby the United Nations is very apt and timely.\r\nMalaysia concurs with the two functions entrusted \r\nby the World Summit to the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil — the Annual Ministerial Review and the \r\nBiennial Development Cooperation Forum — whose \r\naim is to ensure the effective implementation of the \r\ndevelopment agenda. It is important also that the \r\nCouncil work as a system and continue to adopt the \r\nthemes of reviews well in advance in order to give \r\nthe various actors sufficient time to contribute to its \r\ndeliberations.\r\nLooking ahead, Malaysia believes that the Council \r\nshould review its role within the United Nations \r\nsystem in the integrated follow-up to conferences and \r\nthe modalities for actors within the Organization to \r\ncontribute to such follow-up. To promote coherence, \r\ncoordination and integration of the United Nations \r\napparatus, the Council should also continue to look into \r\nthe most appropriate modalities for follow-up to major \r\nconferences and summits.\r\nThe deadline for achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goal (MDG) targets is fast approaching. \r\nWhile some progress has been made, it is well known \r\nthat many developing countries, in particular the least \r\ndeveloped countries, are still far from achieving their \r\nMDG targets by 2015. The challenges we face today \r\nare different from those of some years ago. The current \r\nglobal landscape, financial and economic pressures and \r\nenvironmental issues are hampering countries’ efforts \r\nalso push for an early implementation of the Cancún \r\nAgreements.\r\nWe all know that international trade is a critical \r\nengine of development, especially for developing \r\ncountries that are dependent on exports. Undoubtedly, \r\nlack of market access, Aid for Trade and the absence of \r\na multilateral rules-based trading system continue to \r\ndeny a level playing field for all and to affect the trade \r\nprospects of developing countries. \r\nIf we wish to make trade truly an engine \r\nof inclusive growth, it is essential to restart the \r\nstalled Doha Development Round and bring it to a \r\nconclusion at the earliest possible date. The Round \r\nmust comprehensively address trade-distorting \r\nfactors, including agricultural subsidies in developed \r\ncountries. Duty-free and quota-free market access and \r\nsupport for the productive capacity-building of LDCs \r\nshould be pursued expeditiously and comprehensively. \r\nDeveloped and developing countries in a position to \r\ndo so must provide duty-free and quota-free facilities \r\nto all products from all LDCs. This can and should be \r\ndone even before the conclusion of the Doha Round, \r\nunder the “early harvest” measures of the World Trade \r\nOrganization.\r\nWe cannot overemphasize the need to have a \r\ncoordinated, inclusive, equitable and transparent \r\nfollow-up to all these global aspirations, as reflected in \r\nthe outcomes of global conferences and summits.\r\nMr. Haniff (Malaysia): On behalf of my delegation, \r\nI wish to thank the President for holding this joint \r\ndebate. I also would like to express our appreciation \r\nfor the documents submitted under this agenda item \r\n(A/67/3, A/67/298 and A/67/82).\r\nThe ongoing global financial and economic crisis \r\nhas reversed much of the world’s economic growth and \r\nbadly affected much-needed development, particularly \r\nin the developing countries. This crisis has threatened \r\nthe achievement of the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs) by 2015.\r\nAgainst this backdrop, at the national level, \r\nMalaysia has adopted forward-looking macroeconomic \r\npolicies through the tenth Malaysia Plan, aimed at \r\ndelivering high economic growth in a sustained, \r\ninclusive and equitable manner and ensuring that \r\nMalaysia is on track to become a high-income nation \r\nby 2020. At the global level, Malaysia will continue to \r\nshare its knowledge and experience in economic and \r\nsocial development with other countries, especially the \r\n12-56130 13\r\nA/67/PV.28\r\nAs the deadline for achieving the MDG targets \r\nis less than three years away, Malaysia would like \r\nto reaffirm its commitment to joining the rest of the \r\ninternational community in further accelerating \r\nprogress towards the MDGs by 2015 and actively \r\ncontributing to the United Nations development agenda \r\nbeyond 2015, including the fashioning of sustainable \r\ndevelopment goals. In this respect, we are pleased to \r\nnote that Malaysia has become an increasingly active \r\ninternational partner for development and will continue \r\nto share its knowledge and experience in economic and \r\nsocial development with other developing countries. As \r\nan active player in South-South cooperation, Malaysia \r\nhas offered its expertise in areas of capacity-building \r\nand human-capital development to fellow developing \r\ncountries, mainly through the Malaysian Technical \r\nCooperation Programme. Since the Programme’s \r\nlaunch in 1980, more than 25,000 participants from 140 \r\ncountries have benefited from it.\r\nI would like to conclude by reaffirming Malaysia’s \r\ncommitment to implementing the outcomes of the major \r\nUnited Nations conferences in the economic, social \r\nand related fields by pursuing a development policy \r\nframework that is focused on high growth through \r\nsustained, inclusive and equitable economic, social and \r\nenvironmental policies, guided by the principles and \r\nobjectives of sustainable development.\r\nMr. Maksimychev (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): I would like to thank Ambassador De Alba, \r\nVice-President of the Economic and Social Council, for \r\npresenting the Council’s report (A/67/3), and to express \r\nmy gratitude to the Secretariat for having supported the \r\nwork of the Council this year.\r\nThe Russian delegation has consistently advocated \r\nthe strengthening of the Council’s coordination role \r\nwithin the United Nations development system. We \r\nview the Council as a key United Nations forum for \r\ncrafting collective approaches to pressing social and \r\neconomic problems.\r\nWe welcome the convening of the special \r\nministerial meeting of the Economic and Social Council \r\non the issue of strengthening the multilateral system for \r\nsustainable development in September. The outcome \r\nof that discussion provided a firm basis for holding a \r\nsecond round of consultations on reviewing progress \r\nin the implementation of General Assembly resolution \r\n61/16 on the strengthening of the Council during this \r\nsession of the General Assembly.\r\nto achieve global development goals. In this regard, \r\nwe urge all countries to re-strategize and realign their \r\napproaches to economic and social development.\r\nMalaysia is also of the view that the efforts to \r\neradicate extreme poverty should be complemented by \r\nefforts to provide better access to basic infrastructure, \r\nand that equal priority should be given to improving \r\naccess to basic services. To this end, our partners from \r\ndeveloped countries can continue to assist us in poverty \r\neradication in the developing world by continuing \r\nto fulfil their official development assistance \r\ncommitments. While we recognize that our partners \r\nmay be facing economic difficulties at home, we are \r\nconfident that such difficulties will not prevent them \r\nfrom fulfilling their official development assistance \r\ncommitments, as agreed at numerous United Nations \r\nconferences.\r\nThe 2010 MDG review shows that Malaysia \r\nhas attained, or is on track to attain, the MDGs at \r\naggregate level by 2015. In 2009, the poverty rate \r\nin Malaysia decreased to 3.8 per cent and, just last \r\nyear, 63,147 poor households were elevated under the \r\n1AZAM programme, a hardcore poverty eradication \r\nprogramme of the Malaysian Government. In order \r\nto plan, implement and monitor poverty eradication \r\nprogrammes, Malaysia introduced a monitoring \r\nsystem, called e-Kasih, in November 2007. E-Kasih \r\nwas awarded first prize in the United Nations Public \r\nService Awards for 2012, in recognition of its significant \r\ncontribution to poverty eradication. The e-Kasih is a \r\ndatabase system created at the national level to collect \r\ndata on poor families in Malaysia; it ensures the fair \r\ndistribution of assistance and avoids overlap between \r\nthe aid programmes of multiple Government agencies.\r\nThe progress made towards achieving the MDGs \r\nhas encouraged Malaysia to further improve other \r\nkey areas of development in rural areas through the \r\nadoption of effective policy actions. The Government \r\nhas also established the necessary framework, which \r\ncomprises four main pillars as drivers of change. These \r\npillars are the six national key result areas, as outlined \r\nin the Government Transformation Programme, the \r\n12 national key economic areas of the Economic \r\nTransformation Programme, the strategic economic \r\nreforms in the New Economic Model, and the tenth \r\nMalaysia Plan. These four pillars, which put emphasis \r\non inclusiveness and sustainability, are intended to \r\nbe the basis for propelling Malaysia forward towards \r\nbecoming a high-income nation by 2020.\r\n14 12-56130\r\nA/67/PV.28\r\nvoluntary presentation that reflected the national \r\nstrategy and practical measures undertaken by our \r\ncountry to promote sustained and fair economic growth, \r\nto improve the social well-being of the population and \r\nto ensure further progress in achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nAllow me once again to express my gratitude \r\nto delegations for their active and constructive \r\nparticipation in discussing the report. In 2012, the \r\nEconomic and Social Council reaffirmed its key role \r\nin the process of intergovernmental follow-up to the \r\nvarious international conferences on financing for \r\ndevelopment. We welcome the outcome of the special \r\nhigh-level meeting of the Economic and Social Council \r\nwith the Bretton Woods institutions, the World Trade \r\nOrganization and the United Nations Conference on \r\nTrade and Development. We also welcome the efforts of \r\nthe President and the Bureau of the Council to establish \r\ninformal contacts, in particular with the International \r\nMonetary Fund and the World Bank.\r\nOne of the Council’s priorities should be to continue \r\nexpanding mutually beneficial cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and international financial and trade \r\ninstitutions, the private sector and non-governmental \r\norganizations so as to effectively implement the \r\ninternational development agenda.\r\nThe Russian Federation is ready to cooperate \r\nconstructively with all partners in order to further \r\nstrengthen the Economic and Social Council, given \r\nthe role of the United Nations in global economic \r\ngovernance. \r\nMrs. Martinic (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nArgentina would like to thank Ambassador De Alba \r\nfor presenting the annual report of the Economic and \r\nSocial Council (A/67/3).\r\nThe United Nations must play a central role in \r\nworld governance so that the international community \r\ncan adequately respond to the many and increasing \r\nglobal challenges. Apart from the urgency of the topics \r\naddressed by the Security Council, which means that \r\nits decisions always seem to be critical and to appear \r\non the front pages of the press, the daily challenges in \r\nrelation to economic and social development that are \r\nfaced by most of the world’s population are equally \r\npressing or more so. That is an area where the United \r\nNations is not up to meeting the current challenge. That \r\nhas become increasingly clear since the end of the Cold \r\nWar.\r\nIn our view, the primary task of that review is to \r\ndefi ne the Council’s role in negotiating and implementing \r\nnew priorities for the post-2015 socioeconomic agenda \r\nand in the emerging global structure for international \r\ndevelopment cooperation. As part of the review, we \r\nalso look forward to in-depth discussions of ways to \r\noptimize the agenda and the programme of work of the \r\nCouncil’s substantive session. \r\nFurther work on reforming the socioeconomic \r\nsector of the United Nations must be based on \r\nthe outcome of the United Nations Conference on \r\nSustainable Development (resolution 66/288, annex). \r\nWe believe that the establishment of a high-level forum \r\non sustainable development is an integral part of the \r\nprocess of strengthening the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil and its subsidiary bodies.\r\nOverall, we commend the outcome of the \r\nCouncil’s substantive session this year, including the \r\nAnnual Ministerial Review on the progress towards \r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals and the \r\nDevelopment Cooperation Forum. We note the useful \r\nwork with regard to coordinating the operational \r\nactivities and humanitarian affairs segments of the \r\nsession. That clearly reaffirms the Council’s important \r\nrole in ensuring system-wide coherence and the \r\nrequired and effective implementation of the priorities \r\non the global social and economic agenda. \r\nFor the first time since 2006, the United Nations \r\nplatform was used for a comprehensive discussion under \r\nthe theme of all aspects of employment. The political \r\nguidelines for United Nations work in that area were \r\nset out. Without infringing on the leading role and the \r\nprerogatives of the International Labour Organization, \r\nthe Council was able to provide significant updates on \r\nthe decent-work issues on the United Nations agenda.\r\nThe ministerial declaration, based on the \r\noutcomes of the review, has become a firm normative \r\nbasis for strengthening the work and enhancing the \r\ncoherence and coordination of all United Nations \r\nstructures and bodies. Decisions within the Economic \r\nand Social Council must seek to further enhance \r\nmultilateral development cooperation and the effective \r\nimplementation of the concept of decent work.\r\nThe contributions of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil will be duly taken into account in preparing \r\nfor the International High-level Conference on Decent \r\nWork, to be held in Moscow in December. During the \r\nsession, the Russian representative made a national \r\n12-56130 15\r\nA/67/PV.28\r\nnecessary to take active employment and redistribution \r\nmeasures, as well as macroeconomic policies that \r\npromote productive investment and create decent jobs. \r\nA better distribution of income increases aggregate \r\ndemand, investment and growth, which, in turn, will \r\naccelerate job creation.\r\nEmerging economies continue to foment global \r\ngrowth. It is sufficient to cite the forecasts of the \r\nInternational Monetary Fund for gross domestic \r\nproduct growth for 2012 and 2013. They indicate that \r\nemerging and developing economies are proving to \r\nbe the engines of global growth, with a rate of 5.6 per \r\ncent for 2012 and 5.9 per cent for 2013. Meanwhile, \r\nthe developed economies, the epicentre of the global \r\neconomic crisis, show a growth forecast of 1.4 per cent \r\nin 2012 and 1.9 per cent in 2013.\r\nHowever, we have been attacked in multilateral \r\nforums by some who seek to discourage the use of \r\npublic policies to which we are legally entitled, in an \r\nattempt to limit the scope of our legitimate economic \r\npolicy. The ultimate goal of such attacks is to enable \r\ndeveloped countries to dump their exportable surpluses \r\non our domestic markets, through constrictive fiscal \r\npolicies that limit global aggregate demand. By \r\ncontrast, nothing is said in the same forums about \r\nthe stimulus packages and subsidies that the most \r\npowerful economies continue to provide for their \r\nown industrial and agricultural sectors and that have \r\nharmful repercussions for developing countries. To the \r\nformidable sums that in recent years, in response to the \r\ninternational crisis, have been expended on agricultural \r\nsupport for domestic producers, there have been added \r\nmillions in fiscal and monetary stimulus packages, \r\nwhose real overall distortive impact is immeasurable.\r\nWe are convinced that only a system of global \r\ngovernance based on an effi cient, inclusive, \r\nrepresentative and transparent multilateral \r\ndecision-making system, with clear and fair rules, \r\ncan provide effective solutions to global problems. \r\nPrioritizing and strengthening the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil could be a step in that direction. That will \r\ndepend on the political will of its members.\r\nMs. Morgan (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): I would \r\nfirst express our gratitude for the leadership of the \r\nPresident of the Economic and Social Council and of \r\nthe representatives of Egypt, Indonesia and Spain in \r\nconducting the work of the Council in 2012.\r\nUnder the Charter, the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil, as a principal organ of the United Nations, has \r\na prominent role in dealing with current challenges, such \r\nas promoting a transparent, fair and non-discriminatory \r\ninternational economic system that brings about \r\ndevelopment, social inclusion and economic growth, in \r\nparticular in developing countries.\r\nThe current reality is that the Council is not able \r\nto meet the present economic and social challenges. \r\nWe must find a way to make it more effective so that \r\nit can contribute decisively to the promotion of the \r\nthree pillars of sustainable development, namely, social \r\ndevelopment, economic growth and environmental \r\nprotection. To that end, we believe that the Council’s \r\nagenda should be streamlined because it currently deals \r\nwith countless reports on numerous topics without \r\nachieving the expected result. \r\nWe also believe that the Council should act as a \r\nsounding board for discussions taking place both in its \r\nsubsidiary bodies and in ad hoc forums. Above all, it \r\nshould be able to take responsibility for the discussion \r\nof the main topics in the international economic and \r\nsocial field.\r\nThe Council should also undertake the appropriate \r\nfollow-up to effectively implement the resolutions that \r\nit adopts. For example, this year, it adopted a resolution \r\nthat underscored the need to give the eradication of \r\npoverty the highest priority in the United Nations \r\ndevelopment agenda (E/RES/2012/12). That resolution \r\nmust be fully implemented.\r\nThe Council should generate a vigorous debate on \r\ncurrent issues, such as growth with social inclusion, \r\nto which Argentina attaches the greatest importance. \r\nThrough active State policies that focus on employment, \r\nsocial inclusion and industrial growth, Argentina has \r\nbeen able to achieve some of the highest growth rates \r\nin the world, while creating jobs and reducing poverty \r\nlevels. The investment rate reached a record 24.5 per \r\ncent of gross domestic product in 2011. We registered a \r\ndramatic fall in the unemployment rate from more than \r\n20 per cent in 2002 to 7.2 per cent in the second quarter \r\nof 2012.\r\nThe Council should invite relevant international \r\norganizations, such as the United Nations Conference \r\non Trade and Development, to participate in discussions \r\nso as to reach solutions to specific social problems. \r\nAs the Trade and Development Report 2012 notes, in \r\norder for growth and development to be inclusive, it is \r\n16 12-56130\r\nA/67/PV.28\r\nA coordinated follow-up to the outcomes of the \r\nmajor United Nations conferences in the economic, \r\nsocial and related fields, as well as the formulation of a \r\ncoherent, unified and universal post-2015 development \r\nagenda, calls for an Economic and Social Council \r\ncapable of responding to today’s challenges. We believe \r\nthat the Council is the natural forum for a global \r\napproach to addressing development-related issues. \r\nNonetheless, the Council, and its system of regional \r\nand organic committees, must regain the necessary \r\neffectiveness and capacity to be able to define and \r\nfollow up on a development agenda and to involve \r\nthe relevant stakeholders. What is needed is a process \r\nof thorough institutional reform that will enable the \r\nCouncil to comply fully with its mandate as laid down \r\nin Chapter X of the Charter. We are encouraged by \r\nthe discussion that was initiated during the special \r\nministerial meeting of the Council on 24 September, \r\nand we await with interest the report requested of the \r\nSecretary-General, with proposals for reform.\r\nThe United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment reaffirmed the mandate of the Council \r\nas one of the principal organs charged with carrying \r\nout the integrated and coordinated follow-up to the \r\noutcomes of the major United Nations conferences and \r\nsummits in the economic, social, environmental and \r\nrelated fields, and recognized its decisive contribution \r\nto the balanced integration of the three dimensions of \r\nsustainable development. A renewed and strengthened \r\nCouncil should be able to fulfil three specific functions: \r\nprovide leadership and integration capacity; promote \r\ncoordination and follow-up for a global development \r\nagenda; and promote more effective systemic cohesion \r\nand coordination. We should also revive the Council’s \r\nformer dynamism, which could be imparted to it by \r\nthe discussion and formulation of recommendations on \r\nserious and important topics that are currently facing \r\nthe international community.\r\nReform should be based on the premise that, for the \r\nCouncil to be effective, it needs a systemic approach \r\nthat can enable it to retain its capacity to act and \r\nrespond to development’s central challenges and to \r\nensure that each of its instruments gives added value. \r\nIt should do its work in a timely fashion, and to that \r\nend should revise its current meeting schedule and \r\nend the practice of concentrating too much of its work \r\ninto a single month of the year. It should also make use \r\nof its instruments to create inclusive spaces that can \r\nincorporate other actors. \r\nAs the coordinating entity for funds and \r\nprogrammes, we should strengthen the Development \r\nCooperation Forum as the central platform from which \r\nwe can build and reinforce interaction between the \r\nprincipal stakeholders in international cooperation, \r\nincluding the United Nations funds and programmes. \r\nWe also believe that, with a view to the future post-\r\n2015 development agenda, the Council must strengthen \r\nits role as a central platform for monitoring progress \r\nin commitments made in the area of international \r\ndevelopment. We should therefore ensure that the \r\nannual ministerial review has a solid and inclusive \r\npreparatory and follow-up process that is supported by \r\nthe entire United Nations system.\r\nThe reform of our multilateral development \r\ninstitutions is urgent. We should integrate the various \r\nfragmented efforts surrounding the Organization’s \r\ndevelopment agenda, take advantage of synergies and \r\navoid dissipating our already scant resources, working \r\nwithin a renewed strategic framework where every one \r\nof our actors plays its assigned role. In that context, \r\nthe mission of the Council should be to generate shared \r\nspaces where the relevant actors can make decisions.\r\nFurthermore, the United Nations should not \r\nhave parallel development agendas. We require an \r\nintegrated agenda where, once and for all, development \r\nis understood to be a single whole that incorporates \r\ndistinct but mutally complementary and reinforcing \r\npillars. We call on all Member States, without exception, \r\nto act and to cooperate with one another to improve the \r\nquality of life of their citizens. Finally, with respect \r\nto the development agenda, we believe that the high-\r\nlevel political forum established in Rio de Janeiro not \r\nonly should ensure the convergence between relevant \r\nactors at the global level but also should function as a \r\nbridge between the Assembly and the Council within \r\nthe United Nations.\r\nBefore concluding, I would like to thank the \r\nPresident of the Assembly, on behalf of Mexico’s \r\ndelegation, for his commitment to developing with the \r\nEconomic and Social Council a series of processes that \r\ncan lead the United Nations to renew its development \r\nagenda.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on these items. May I take it that \r\nthe General Assembly takes note of the report of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council contained in document \r\nA/67/3?\r\n12-56130 17\r\nA/67/PV.28\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: The General Assembly has \r\nthus concluded this stage of its consideration of agenda \r\nitems 9 and 14.\r\nAgenda items 63 and 13 (continued)\r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development: \r\nprogress in implementation and \r\ninternational support\r\n(a) New Partnership for Africa’s Development: \r\nprogress in implementation and \r\ninternational support\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/67/204)\r\n(b) Causes of conflict and the promotion of durable \r\npeace and sustainable development in Africa\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/67/205)\r\n2001-2010: Decade to Roll Back Malaria in \r\nDeveloping Countries, Particularly in Africa\r\nThe Acting President: Members will recall that the \r\nGeneral Assembly considered, in a joint debate, agenda \r\nitem 63 and its sub-items (a) and (b) and agenda item 13 \r\nat its 25th and 26th plenary meetings, on 17 October.\r\nMr. Emvula (Namibia): Namibia aligns itself with \r\nthe statement made by the representative of Cameroon \r\non behalf of the Group of African States (see A/67/\r\nPV.25). The social and economic development of the \r\nAfrican continent remains an urgent imperative. In \r\norder to succeed, we must redouble our collective \r\nefforts to improve the productive capacity of our \r\neconomies and equip our people, especially the youth, \r\nwith the needed skills and competencies. We should \r\nalso do more to improve access to public services \r\nsuch as education, health care, housing, electricity and \r\nother social amenities. In that regard, we join others \r\nin thanking the Secretary-General for his reports \r\n(A/67/204 and A/67/205).\r\nGlobal action to combat malaria has reduced \r\ndeaths by more than one third, saving 1.1 million lives \r\nin sub-Saharan Africa over the past decade. Namibia \r\nhas also made significant progress in the fight against \r\nmalaria in the past 10 years. Although Namibia is not \r\nyet malaria-free, the number of malaria cases recorded \r\nacross the country dropped by 97 per cent between \r\n2001 and 2011.\r\nThe number of malaria deaths has also decreased \r\nfrom 1,747 in 2001, to a mere 45 in 2010, which is a \r\nmortality reduction of 98 per cent. The decline in the \r\nnumber of malaria cases is due to a campaign that \r\nincludes the distribution of insecticide-treated mosquito \r\nnets and massive treatment efforts aimed at people who \r\nhave contracted malaria. Namibia is on track to achieve \r\nmalaria elimination by 2015.\r\nAfrican heads of State and Government adopted the \r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) at \r\nthe summit in Lusaka, Zambia, in 2001. That decision \r\nwas hailed in Africa and by the international community \r\nat large as a milestone and an important paradigm shift \r\nin our approach to economic and social development. \r\nWe have designed NEPAD as a development plan to \r\nfree our continent and its people from the scourge of \r\npoverty and underdevelopment. It is a vision and a \r\nprogramme of priority actions and strategies to guide \r\nAfrica’s way forward. Namibia believes that we need to \r\ndo more to fulfil the goals we set for ourselves when we \r\nestablished NEPAD.\r\nWe are convinced that the implementation and \r\npolitical championing of strategies and the active \r\npromotion of Africa’s regional infrastructure through \r\nthe work of the Heads of State and Government in the \r\nHigh-level Subcommittee on Infrastructure will ensure \r\nthe success of NEPAD and the African Union in their \r\nefforts to find adequate funding for the projects we \r\nhave identified and defined in accordance with our \r\ndevelopmental needs.\r\nIn conclusion, let me underline that the primary \r\nresponsibility for funding projects for Africa’s \r\ndevelopment lies with Africans. Others should only \r\ncomplement our efforts. I therefore wish to appeal to \r\nall of the international community to demonstrate the \r\npolitical will required and to match our commitments \r\nwith financial resources. Africa rose to the seemingly \r\ndaunting challenge of defeating colonialism. Now is the \r\ntime for us to rise to the challenge of Africa’s economic \r\ndevelopment with the assistance of the international \r\ncommunity — led by the Office of the Special Adviser \r\nof the Secretary-General on Africa — and with equal \r\ndetermination and creative energy.\r\nMr. Elmajerbi (Libya) (spoke in Arabic): At \r\nthe outset, I would like to extend my thanks to the \r\nSecretary-General for his two reports (A/67/204 and \r\nA/67/205) on the item under discussion. I express my \r\ndelegation’s solidarity with the statements made at the \r\n18 12-56130\r\nA/67/PV.28\r\ncountries must fulfil the commitments made in the \r\ncourse of the major United Nations conferences \r\non Africa. That requires all development partners, \r\nin particular the developed countries, to back the \r\ndeveloping African countries by fostering investment \r\nand creating policies conducive to encouraging local \r\nand foreign investment. That is particularly necessary \r\nas desertification, land degradation and drought have \r\nhad adverse effects on African efforts to achieve \r\ndevelopment.\r\nTo further regional efforts to address the problem, \r\nthe international community should assist Africa in \r\nimplementing the United Nations Convention to Combat \r\nDesertification in Those Countries Experiencing \r\nSerious Drought and/or Desertification, Particularly in \r\nAfrica. As a member of NEPAD, Libya will continue to \r\nactively cooperate with African States to advance the \r\nNEPAD agenda for progress, growth and prosperity for \r\nAfrican countries, through joint action, coordination \r\nand compliance with cooperation agreements concluded \r\nwith numerous African States in the past. We will strive \r\nthereby for the MDGs to be achieved and for African \r\ncountries to take their natural role in the international \r\neconomic system, especially since they possess the \r\nvaluable human and natural resources necessary for \r\nthem to reach the goals they have set.\r\nThe Acting President: In accordance with General \r\nAssembly resolution 49/2 of 19 October 1994, I now \r\ncall on the observer for the International Federation of \r\nRed Cross and Red Crescent Societies.\r\nMr. Lobry-Boulanger (International Federation \r\nof Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies): The \r\nInternational Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent \r\nSocieties (IFRC) supports the adoption last month of \r\nresolution 66/289, entitled “Consolidating gains and \r\naccelerating efforts to control and eliminate malaria in \r\ndeveloping countries, particularly in Africa, by 2015”. \r\nWe also welcome the inclusion of malaria among the \r\nSecretary-General’s priorities for his second term.\r\nWe have collectively made significant progress \r\nin the fight against malaria over the past 10 years, as \r\nhighlighted in the World Health Organization’s 2011 \r\nWorld Malaria Report. We know that our success is the \r\nresult of a significant scaling up of malaria prevention \r\nand control measures, including the widespread \r\nownership and increased use of bednets, better \r\ndiagnostics and the wider availability of effective \r\nmedicines to treat malaria.\r\n25th meeting by the representative of Cameroon, on \r\nbehalf of the African States, and by the representative \r\nof Egypt, on behalf of the Group of Arab States. \r\nAfter the adoption of the New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD) as the framework \r\nfor Africa’s socioeconomic development, the African \r\ncountries have adopted political strategies and measures \r\nto carry out NEPAD’s sectoral priorities, with the \r\nsupport of the international community.\r\nAfrican countries have achieved remarkable \r\nprogress in consolidating democracy, human rights \r\nand good governance, as well as sound economic \r\nmanagement. Yet, there have been noticeable adverse \r\nrepercussions resulting from the world economic and \r\nfinancial crisis, including price f luctuations in energy \r\nand foodstuffs, and increased challenges owing to \r\nclimate change, including drought, soil degradation, \r\ndesertification and the loss of biological diversity. \r\nThere have also been negative impacts on the fight \r\nagainst hunger and poverty and on the achievement of \r\nthe internationally agreed development goals, including \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).\r\nGiven that the African continent has been one of \r\nthe worst affected by the world economic and financial \r\ncrisis and despite the return of growth internationally, \r\nAfrica remains vulnerable with inconsistent growth. \r\nIt is therefore necessary to foster national efforts to \r\nachieve food security in Africa through increased \r\nallocations to agriculture and rural development in the \r\nbudgets of the African countries and to ensure better and \r\nsounder management. In that regard, the international \r\ncommunity must play a role in providing technological \r\nand financial support as well as modern agrarian skills \r\nto increase production and improve quality.\r\nThe fact that trade plays an important role in Africa \r\nin promoting economic growth, creating employment \r\nopportunities, especially given the huge unemployment \r\nwe face, and achieving the MDGs, there is an urgent \r\nneed to rectify trade practices that run counter to the \r\nrules of the World Trade Organization. All States, \r\nrelevant institutions and multilateral entities should \r\nalign their policies with those of the African States \r\nand provide assistance to strengthen trade, aimed at \r\novercoming the existing challenges in order to ensure \r\nthat Africa is on track to achieve free and fair trade. \r\nGiven the cardinal role of official development \r\nassistance in making progress on achieving sustainable \r\ndevelopment in developing countries, developed \r\n12-56130 19\r\nA/67/PV.28\r\nThe IFRC believes that malaria control and reaching \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) will \r\ndepend on sustained and increased funding support, \r\nas well as on political commitment. For instance, just \r\nby scaling up efforts to prevent malaria, including \r\nuniversal coverage with mosquito nets, an estimated \r\n3 million children’s lives will be saved by 2015. \r\nSustaining malaria-control efforts is an investment \r\nin development. Early and continued investment in \r\nmalaria control will greatly assist malaria-endemic \r\ncountries along the path to achieving the MDGs, \r\nespecially those relating to improving child survival \r\nand maternal health, eradicating extreme poverty and \r\nexpanding access to education. Furthermore, malaria \r\nfunding can be used as a gateway for the integration of \r\nother key health services to address MDGs 4 and 5, thus \r\noffering a synergistic solution to resource constraints \r\nglobally and within countries.\r\nThe power of partnership is one of the most important \r\npieces in the fight against malaria. Malaria is the cause \r\nof massive human suffering, and the international \r\ncommunity must play a greater role in supporting global \r\npartnerships to fight malaria. International efforts \r\nto scale up the proven, cost-effective tools available \r\nto prevent and control malaria must be maintained. \r\nHowever, in order to avoid the pitfalls experienced in \r\npast efforts to eradicate malaria, including growing \r\nresistance to insecticide and drugs, we must continue \r\nto invest in research and develop initiatives to stay \r\nahead of the mosquito and the parasite. We cannot risk \r\nreversing today’s gains and losing countless more lives \r\nto a preventable and treatable disease.\r\nThe Acting President: I thank the observer for the \r\nInternational Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent \r\nSocieties.\r\nWe have heard the last speaker in the debate on \r\nsub-items (a) and (b) of agenda item 63 and agenda item \r\n13. The Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its \r\nconsideration of those agenda items.\r\nThe meeting rose at 5.10 p.m.\r\nDespite those significant results, gains remain \r\ninequitable. While some countries are moving towards \r\nthe elimination of malaria, many others continue to \r\nsuffer unacceptably high burdens of the disease and \r\nrequire a rapid increase in prevention and control \r\nefforts.\r\nWe must not take recent hard-won advances in the \r\nglobal fight against malaria for granted. The gains made \r\nare fragile. Collectively, we must do more, do better and \r\nreach further. The IFRC calls for greater recognition, \r\nsupport and investment in community-based solutions, \r\nincluding a focus on the most vulnerable, marginalized \r\nand hard-to-reach communities, in order to ensure \r\nequitable access to malaria prevention, diagnosis and \r\ntreatment. Malaria is first managed in homes and \r\ncommunities, and it will be at that level that we will \r\ncontinue to see the biggest returns on investment by \r\nempowering individuals to take informed action against \r\nthe disease. \r\nThe Red Cross and Red Crescent national societies \r\nand their community-based volunteers have played \r\na crucial role in our global success to date. Those \r\nvolunteers, who are intimately aware of local barriers \r\nto health interventions, are working in communities to \r\nexpand the reach of prevention and control measures. \r\nVolunteers go door-to-door to ensure installation and \r\nproper care of nets, provide information on how to \r\neffectively prevent the disease, identify where to access \r\ndiagnosis and treatment and promote rapid treatment-\r\nseeking behaviour for pregnant women and children \r\nunder 5 years of age in order to stop preventable malaria \r\ndeaths.\r\nNew technology is also playing a role. In Haiti, \r\nfor example, the Red Cross, in addition to targeted \r\ndistributions in at-risk communities, is using mobile \r\ntechnology to put life-saving information directly \r\ninto the hands of people through a nationwide malaria \r\nprevention campaign that has included over 3.5 million \r\nSMS messages sent.\r\n"
