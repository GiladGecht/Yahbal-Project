I wish him the greatest of success \r\nin the discharge of his important functions.\r\nFollowing a well-established tradition reflecting \r\nthe Assembly’s interest in the Court and its support of \r\nthe Court, I would like to present a succinct report of \r\nthe judicial activity of the court over the past 12 months. \r\nDuring this period, the Court continued to fulfil its role \r\nas the privileged forum of the international community \r\nof States for the peaceful settlement of all sorts of \r\ninternational disputes that it has the jurisdiction to \r\naddress. It made every effort to meet the expectations \r\nof the international parties appearing before it in a \r\ntimely manner. It should be noted in this regard that \r\nas the Court has been able to clear its backlog of cases, \r\nStates that are contemplating submitting cases to the \r\nprincipal judicial organ of the United Nations can \r\nbe confident that, as soon as they are finished their \r\nwritten exchanges, the Court will be able to proceed \r\nwithout delay to oral hearings.\r\nDuring the reporting period, as many as 15 \r\ncontentious cases and one advisory procedure were \r\npending before the Court. On 31 July, 11 contentious \r\ncases remained before the Court. During the same \r\nperiod, one new contentious case was submitted to \r\nthe Court by Nicaragua, concerning Construction \r\nof a Road in Costa Rica along the San Juan River \r\n(Nicaragua v. Costa Rica).\r\nDuring the same period, the Court held a \r\nseries of public hearings on the following three \r\ncases: Jurisdictional Immunities of the State\r\n(Germany v. Italy: Greece intervening); Questions \r\nrelating to the Obligation to Prosecute or Extradite \r\n(Belgium v. Senegal); and Territorial and Maritime \r\nDispute (Nicaragua v. Colombia). The Court is at \r\npresent deliberating this last case and intends to deliver \r\nits judgment in the course of the next month. It also \r\nrecently held, from 8 to 17 October, hearings in the case \r\nconcerning Frontier Dispute (Burkina Faso/Niger) and \r\nhas begun its deliberations. Lastly, hearings will begin \r\nin the case concerning the Maritime Dispute (Peru v. \r\nChile) on 3 December. \r\nDuring the reporting period, the Court delivered \r\nfour judgments in the following cases: Application \r\nof the Interim Accord of 13 September 1995 (the \r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia v. Greece); \r\nJurisdictional Immunities of the State (Germany v. \r\nItaly: Greece intervening); Ahmadou Sadio Diallo\r\nUnited Nations A/67/PV.29\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-seventh session\r\n29th plenary meeting\r\nThursday, 1 November 2012, 10 a.m.\r\nNew York\r\nOffi cial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Jeremić . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Serbia)\r\n2 12-56915\r\nA/67/PV.29\r\n(Republic of Guinea v. Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo), on the question of compensation owed to \r\nGuinea; and Questions relating to the Obligation to \r\nProsecute or Extradite (Belgium v. Senegal). The \r\nCourt also delivered an advisory opinion concerning \r\nJudgment No. 2867 of the Administrative Tribunal of the \r\nInternational Labour Organization upon a Complaint \r\nFiled against the International Fund for Agricultural \r\nDevelopment.\r\nAs I usually do, I will report briefly on the four \r\nJudgments and the advisory opinion delivered by the \r\nInternational Court of Justice under the period under \r\nreview. I shall deal with these decisions in chronological \r\norder. \r\nOn 5 December 2011, the Court delivered its \r\nJudgment in the case concerning Application of the \r\nInterim Accord of 13 September 1995 (the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia v. Greece), which \r\nhad been brought in November 2008 by the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia against Greece for \r\nwhat is described as the “flagrant violation of [that \r\ncountry’s] obligations under Article 11” of the Interim \r\nAccord signed by the parties on 13 September 1995. \r\nAfter asking the Court in its application to \r\n“protect its rights under the Interim Accord and \r\nto ensure that it is allowed to exercise its rights \r\nas an independent State acting in accordance \r\nwith international law, including the right to \r\npursue membership of relevant international \r\norganizations”, \r\nthe former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia requested \r\nthe Court to order Greece to “immediately take all \r\nnecessary steps to comply with its obligations under \r\nArticle 11, paragraph 1” and to \r\n “cease and desist from objecting in any way, whether \r\ndirectly or indirectly, to the Applicant’s membership \r\nof the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and/or of \r\nany other ‘international, multilateral and regional \r\norganizations and institutions’ of which [Greece] is \r\na member”.\r\nGreece, for its part, considered that the case brought \r\nby the applicant did not fall within the jurisdiction of \r\nthe Court and that in any case the applicant’s claims \r\nwere inadmissible. It argued in the alternative that \r\nwere the Court to find that it had jurisdiction and that \r\nthe claims were admissible, those claims were without \r\nfoundation.\r\nWith regard to the respondent’s objections as to the \r\njurisdiction of the Court and the admissibility of the \r\napplicant’s claims, the Court ruled that it not only had \r\njurisdiction to entertain the application filed but also \r\nthat the application was admissible.\r\nAs for the second part of the applicant’s claims, the \r\nCourt found that the Hellenic Republic, by objecting \r\nto the admission of the former Yugoslav Republic of \r\nMacedonia to NATO, had violated its obligation under \r\narticle 11, paragraph 1, of the Interim Accord. The Court \r\nrejected all other submissions made by the applicant.\r\nOn 3 February, the Court rendered its Judgment \r\nin the case concerning Jurisdictional Immunities of \r\nthe State (Germany v. Italy: Greece intervening). On \r\n23 December 2008, Germany filed an application \r\ninstituting proceedings against Italy, whereby it \r\nrequested the Court to find that Italy had failed to respect \r\nthe jurisdictional immunity enjoyed by Germany under \r\ninternational law by allowing civil claims to be brought \r\nagainst it in the Italian courts seeking reparations for \r\ninjuries by violations of international humanitarian law \r\ncommitted by the German Reich during the Second \r\nWorld War. Germany also requested that the Court \r\nfind that Italy had also violated Germany’s immunity \r\nby taking enforcement measures against Villa Vigoni, \r\nGerman State property situated in Italian territory, and \r\nthat Italy had further breached Germany’s jurisdictional \r\nimmunity by declaring enforceable in Italy decisions \r\nof Greek civil courts rendered against Germany for \r\nacts similar to those which had given rise to the claims \r\nbrought before Italian courts. \r\nConsequently, Germany requested the Court \r\nto adjudge and declare that Italy’s international \r\nresponsibility was triggered; that Italy must, by means \r\nof its own choosing, take any and all necessary steps \r\nto ensure that all the decisions of its courts and other \r\njudicial authorities infringing Germany’s sovereign \r\nimmunity be without effect; and that Italy must take any \r\nand all necessary steps to ensure that in the future Italian \r\ncourts do not entertain legal actions against Germany \r\nfounded upon the aforementioned occurrences.\r\nIn its ruling, the Court found that Italy had violated \r\nits obligation to respect the immunity that Germany \r\nenjoys under international law by allowing civil \r\nclaims to be brought against it based on violations \r\nof international humanitarian law committed by the \r\nGerman Reich between 1943 and 1945; that Italy had \r\nviolated its obligation to respect the immunity which \r\nGermany enjoys under international law by taking \r\n12-56915 3\r\nA/67/PV.29\r\nCovenant on Civil and Political Rights and the African \r\nCharter on Human and Peoples’ Rights. Under the \r\nterms of the ruling on the merits, it followed that the \r\namount of compensation to be paid by the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo had to be set for any damages \r\nresulting from the wrongful detention and expulsion of \r\nMr. Diallo, including the resulting loss of his personal \r\nbelongings. \r\nIn the final stage of the proceedings, Guinea \r\nsought compensation amounting to $11,590,148, not \r\nincluding statutory default interest on four counts \r\nof damages: one non-material count referred to by \r\nGuinea as “psychological and moral damage” and three \r\ncounts of material damage for alleged loss of personal \r\nproperty, alleged loss of professional remuneration \r\nsuffered by Mr. Diallo during his detentions and after \r\nhis expulsion, and alleged deprivation of potential \r\nearnings. Guinea also requested the Court to order the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo not only to pay all \r\nthe costs, but also to pay it the amount of $500,000 for \r\ncosts it had been forced to incur in the proceedings. \r\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo, for its part, \r\nrequested the Court to adjudge that compensation in an \r\namount of $30,000, payable within a time limit of six \r\nmonths from the date of the Court’s ruling, was due to \r\nGuinea to make good on the non-material harm suffered \r\nby Mr. Diallo as a result of his wrongful detentions and \r\nexpulsion in 1995 and 1996. The Democratic Republic \r\nof the Congo rejected all other claims by Guinea.\r\nIn ruling on the non-material harm alleged by \r\nGuinea, the Court considered that the amount of \r\n$85,000 would provide appropriate compensation for \r\nthe damage suffered by Mr. Diallo. With regard to the \r\ncompensation for material damage, the Court, relying \r\non the jurisprudence of regional human rights courts, \r\nawarded the sum of $10,000 for the loss of Mr. Diallo’s \r\npersonal property. Having then found that Guinea had \r\nnot proven to the satisfaction of the Court that Mr. Diallo \r\nhad suffered a loss of professional remuneration during \r\nhis detentions and following his expulsion, the Court \r\ndecided to award no compensation for that injury. \r\nLastly, the Court decided to award no compensation \r\nto Guinea in respect of its claim relating to potential \r\nearnings of Mr. Diallo, insofar as that claim, which was \r\nbeyond the scope of those proceedings, amounted to a \r\nclaim relating to the injuries alleged to have been caused \r\nto Africom-Zaire and Africontainers-Zaire, while the \r\nCourt had already declared those claims inadmissible. \r\nenforcement measures against Villa Vigoni; and \r\nthat Italy had violated its obligation to respect the \r\nimmunity that Germany enjoys under international \r\nlaw by declaring enforceable in Italy decisions by \r\nGreek courts based on violations of international \r\nhumanitarian law committed in Greece by the German \r\nReich. The Court also found that Italy must, by enacting \r\nappropriate legislation or by resorting to other methods \r\nof its choosing, ensure that the decisions of its courts \r\nand those of other judicial authorities infringing the \r\nimmunity which Germany enjoys under international \r\nlaw cease to have effect.\r\nIn September, the Italian Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs and Minister of Justice of Italy, in agreement \r\nwith the Minister of Economy and Finance, presented \r\ndraft legislation to the Italian Chamber of Deputies \r\nproviding for the authorization of ratification by Italy \r\nof the United Nations Convention on Jurisdictional \r\nImmunities of States and Their Property and its \r\nimplementation. Furthermore, the draft legislation also \r\naddresses the effect in the Italian legal system of the \r\njudgment of the Court in the aforementioned case so as \r\nto ensure compliance with that decision.\r\nOn 19 June, the Court delivered its third ruling \r\nduring the period under review in the case concerning \r\nAhmadou Sadio Diallo (Republic of Guinea v. \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo). That ruling \r\nconcerned the question of compensation owed by \r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo to Guinea. It \r\nshould be recalled that, in the ruling on the merits of \r\n30 November 2010, the Court had found, inter alia, that \r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo had violated \r\ncertain international obligations as a result of Mr. Diallo, \r\na Guinean national, having been continuously detained \r\nin Congolese territory for 66 consecutive days between \r\nNovember 1995 and January 1996, and of his having \r\nbeen detained for a second time between 25 and \r\n31 January 1996, for a total of 72 days. \r\nIn that regard, the Court had found that Guinea \r\nhad failed to demonstrate that Mr. Diallo had been \r\nsubjected to inhuman or degrading treatment during \r\nhis detentions. In addition, it was found that Mr. Diallo \r\nhad been expelled by the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo on 31 January 1996 and that he had received \r\nthe notification of his expulsion on the same day. \r\nAccordingly, the Court had stated that the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo was required to compensate \r\nGuinea for breaches of its obligations under certain \r\nhuman rights conventions, namely the International \r\n4 12-56915\r\nA/67/PV.29\r\nAfter fixing 31 August 2012 as the deadline for \r\nthe payment of compensation owed by the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo to Guinea with post-Judgment \r\ninterest accruing at an annual rate of 6 per cent in the \r\nevent of late payment, the Court decided that each party \r\nshould bear its own procedural costs. The Court was \r\ninformed that the compensation was duly paid by the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo within the time \r\nlimit fixed for that purpose.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nI now come to the Judgment granted by the \r\nCourt in the case concerning Questions Relating to \r\nthe Obligation to Prosecute or Extradite (Belgium v. \r\nSenegal). In that case, which it submitted to the Court \r\nby means of an application dated 19 February 2009, \r\nBelgium complained that Senegal, where the former \r\nChadian President Hissène Habré had been living in \r\nexile since 1990, had taken no action on its repeated \r\nrequests to ensure that the latter be brought to trial in \r\nSenegal, failing his extradition to Belgium, for acts \r\ncharacterized as torture, crimes against humanity, war \r\ncrimes and the crime of genocide, allegedly committed \r\nwhile he was President of Chad between 1982 and 1990. \r\nBelgium contended that Senegal was in breach of \r\nits obligations under article 5, paragraph 2; article 6, \r\nparagraph 2; and article 7, paragraph ,1 of the 1984 \r\nConvention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or \r\nDegrading Treatment or Punishment, and its obligations \r\nunder customary international law. Senegal, for its part, \r\nsubmitted that there was no dispute between the parties \r\nwith regard to the interpretation or application of the \r\nConvention against Torture or any other relevant rules \r\nof international law. According to the respondent, the \r\nCourt therefore elected jurisdiction in the case. \r\nArguing in particular that none of the alleged \r\nvictims of the acts attributed to Mr. Habré was of \r\nBelgian nationality at the time the acts were committed, \r\nSenegal also objected to the admissibility of Belgium’s \r\nclaims because, in its view, the latter was not entitled \r\nto invoke the international responsibility of Senegal for \r\nthe alleged breach of its obligation to submit the case \r\nof Hissène Habré to its competent authorities for the \r\npurpose of prosecution, failing his extradition. \r\nGiven that the existence of a dispute was a \r\ncondition of the jurisdiction of the Court on both bases \r\nof jurisdiction invoked by Belgium — namely, article \r\n30, paragraph 1 of the Convention against Torture and \r\nthe declarations made by the parties under Article 36, \r\nparagraph 2, of the Statute of the Court — the Court \r\nbegan by considering that question. It found that, \r\nin view of the legislative and constitutional reforms \r\ncarried out in Senegal in 2007 and 2008, any dispute \r\nthat might have existed between the parties with \r\nregard to the interpretation or application of article \r\n5, paragraph 2 of the Convention — which requires a \r\nState party to the Convention to take such measures as \r\nmay be necessary to establish its jurisdiction over acts \r\nof torture in cases where the alleged offender is present \r\nin any territory under its jurisdiction if it does not \r\nextradite him pursuant to article 8 to any of the States \r\nmentioned in paragraph 1 of the same article — had \r\nended by the time the application was filed.\r\nAs regards Belgium’s claims relating to Senegal’s \r\nduties to comply with its obligations under article \r\n6, paragraph 2, and article 7, paragraph 1 of the \r\nConvention against Torture, which respectively require \r\na State party to the Convention to immediately make a \r\npreliminary inquiry into the facts when a person who \r\nhas allegedly committed an act of torture is found on \r\nits territory and, if it does not extradite him, to submit \r\nthe case to its competent authorities for the purpose of \r\nprosecution, the Court, after analysing the diplomatic \r\nexchanges between the parties, found that they had \r\nconflicting views concerning the interpretation and \r\napplication of the aforementioned provisions at the \r\ntime of the filing of the application. However, the Court \r\nconsidered that the dispute which had thus arisen did \r\nnot relate to breaches of obligations under customary \r\ninternational law.\r\nAfter recalling that, in the words of its preamble, the \r\nobject and purpose of the Convention against Torture \r\nis to make more effective the struggle against torture \r\nthroughout the world, the Court found that Belgium, as \r\na State party to the Convention, had standing to invoke \r\nthe responsibility of Senegal for the alleged breaches \r\nof its obligations erga omnes partes under article 6, \r\nparagraph 2, and article 7, paragraph 1. The claims of \r\nBelgium based on those provisions were thus declared \r\nadmissible.\r\nAfter assessing questions relating to the merits, the \r\nCourt found that Senegal had violated its obligations \r\nunder the two aforementioned provisions of the \r\nConvention and that its international responsibility \r\nhad been triggered. Noting the continuing nature of \r\nthose violations, it declared that Senegal was required \r\nto cease them by taking without further delay the \r\nnecessary measures to submit the case to its competent \r\n12-56915 5\r\nA/67/PV.29\r\nauthorities for the purpose of prosecution if it does not \r\nextradite Mr. Habré.\r\nI shall now turn to the Court’s advisory opinion \r\nconcerning the Judgment of the Administrative \r\nTribunal of the International Labour Organization \r\nupon a Complaint Filed against the International \r\nFund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). In that \r\ncase, the Court was asked to examine the validity of \r\na judgment granted by the Administrative Tribunal \r\nof the International Labour Organization concerning \r\nthe employment contract of Ms. Saez Garcia. It \r\nshould be recalled that the latter had accepted from \r\nthe International Fund for Agricultural Development \r\nan offer of a two-year fixed term contract serving \r\nas a programme officer in the Global Mechanism, \r\nan institution housed at the Fund. The employment \r\ncontract had been renewed on two occasions. \r\nThe Tribunal was seized of a dispute concerning \r\nthe decision of the President of the Fund to reject the \r\nrecommendations of the Joint Appeals Board of the \r\nFund following several internal procedures relating \r\nto the non-renewal of the contract of the individual \r\nconcerned and the abolition of her post. In its \r\njudgment, the Court set aside the President’s decision \r\nand ordered the Fund to pay damages and expenses. \r\nIn the course of the advisory proceedings before the \r\nCourt, the Fund asserted in particular that Ms. Saez \r\nGarcia was a staff member of the Global Mechanism \r\nand not of IFAD, and that her employment status had \r\nto be assessed in the context of the arrangement for the \r\nhousing of the Global Mechanism made between the \r\nFund and the Conference of the Parties to the United \r\nNations Convention to Combat Desertification in \r\nThose Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or \r\nDesertification, Particularly in Africa.\r\nAfter examining the texts defining the respective \r\npowers of and relations between IFAD and the Global \r\nMechanism, the Court came to the conclusion that the \r\nGlobal Mechanism, which is devoid of any international \r\nlegal personality, had no power and had not purported to \r\nexercise any power to enter into contracts, agreements \r\nor arrangements internationally or nationally. With \r\nrespect to Ms. Saez Garcia’s employment status, the \r\nCourt found that there was an employment relationship \r\nbetween her and the Fund, given that the staff \r\nregulations and the rules of the Fund were applicable to \r\nher. Accordingly, the Court unanimously found that the \r\nAdministrative Tribunal was competent under article 2 \r\nof its Statute to hear the complaint introduced against \r\nIFAD by Ms. Saez Garcia and that the decision given by \r\nthe Tribunal in its judgment was valid.\r\nIn the light of its concern about the inequality of \r\naccess to the Court arising from the review procedure \r\nprovided for in article XII of the annex to the statute \r\nof the Administrative Tribunal of the International \r\nLabour Organization, the Court examined the principle \r\nof equality before the Court of the Fund and Ms. Saez \r\nGarcia. It declared that the principle of equality must \r\nnow be understood as including access on an equal \r\nbasis to available appellate or similar remedies \r\nunless an exception can be justified on objective and \r\nreasonable grounds. In that regard, the Court questioned \r\nwhether the system established in 1946 allows for the \r\nimplementation of the modern-day concept of the \r\nprinciple of equality and access to justice, stating \r\nhowever that it did not fall to it to reform the current \r\nsystem.\r\nWhile the United Nations reformed its system of \r\nadministrative justice some time ago, it nevertheless \r\nremains impossible to request review of a judgment \r\nof the Administrative Tribunal of the International \r\nLabour Organization. In fact, the opportunity to \r\nchallenge a judgment of the Tribunal is available only \r\nto international organizations duly authorized to do so \r\nunder the statute of the Administrative Tribunal, and \r\nnot to any staff member affected by such a decision. In \r\nthat regard, the question arises as to whether the time \r\nhas come for the International Labour Organization to \r\nalso consider initiating a reform of the current system, \r\nsuch as that already being carried out by the United \r\nNations. \r\nTurning to more practical matters, I am delighted \r\nto tell the Assembly that the Court is refurbishing the \r\nGreat Hall of Justice at the Peace Palace. \r\nThat project, which has received the support of the \r\nCarnegie Foundation, is the first major renovation of \r\nthe Hall in a hundred years. In the past, minor work \r\nwas carried out to extend the bench to accommodate \r\nthe enlarged composition of the Court’s predecessor, \r\nthe Permanent Court of International Justice. However, \r\nno renovation on the scale of the current project has \r\npreviously been envisaged. Furthermore, the newly \r\nrenovated Great Hall of Justice will also be equipped \r\nwith improved modern technical facilities offering a \r\nwide range of possibilities. I am therefore very pleased \r\nto assure the Member States that not only do we hear \r\nand shall continue to hear cases to submitted to the \r\nCourt faithfully and impartially as required by the \r\n6 12-56915\r\nA/67/PV.29\r\nnoble judicial mission entrusted to the United Nations, \r\nbut that we are also modernizing the setting in which \r\nwe exercise that function. We have thus been able to put \r\nthe funds mobilized by the General Assembly to good \r\nuse in the refurbishment and renovation project.\r\nI hope I have conveyed to the General Assembly \r\nthe extent to which the Court seeks to meet the \r\nexpectations of the international community as a whole, \r\nincluding, as in the last decision that I reviewed, in \r\nrelation to particular aspects of the law of international \r\norganizations. That is why the Court has already \r\ndiscussed the schedule of its judicial work for 2013 and \r\n2014 with a view to fixing several series of hearings. \r\nI have already mentioned that hearings will begin in \r\nthe case concerning Maritime Dispute (Peru v. Chile) \r\nin December. In addition, the Court envisages holding \r\nhearings in April in the case concerning the request \r\nfor interpretation of the Judgment of 15 June 1962 \r\nin the case concerning Temple of Preah Vihear \r\n(Cambodia v. Thailand), and in early summer next \r\nyear, in the case concerning Whaling in the Antarctic \r\n(Australia v. Japan).\r\nOf course, the Court must do its utmost to serve the \r\nnoble purposes and goals of the United Nations using \r\nlimited resources, since the Member States allocate \r\nless than 1 per cent — exactly 0.8 per cent — of the \r\nOrganization’s regular budget to it. Nevertheless, I hope \r\nthat I have shown that the Court’s recent contributions \r\nare not to be measured in terms of the financial \r\nresources that sustain it, but against the great progress \r\nmade by it in the advancement of international justice \r\nand the peaceful settlement of disputes between States.\r\nI want to thank the Assembly for giving me this \r\nopportunity to address it today. I wish it every success \r\nin its sixty-seventh session. \r\nThe President: I thank the President of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice. \r\nMr. Gharibi (Islamic Republic of Iran): I have \r\nthe honour to deliver this statement on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement (NAM). \r\nThe Non-Aligned Movement attaches great \r\nimportance to agenda item 71, “Report of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice”, and takes note of the \r\nreport, contained in document A/67/4, regarding the \r\nactivities of the Court between 1 August 2011 and \r\n31 July 2012, as requested by the General Assembly last \r\nyear in resolution 66/102. I would also like to thank the \r\nPresident of the International Court of Justice for his \r\npresentation of the report to the Assembly.\r\nThe Non-Aligned Movement reaffirms and \r\nunderscores its principled positions concerning the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes and the non-use or threat \r\nof use of force. The International Court of Justice has \r\na significant role to play in promoting and encouraging \r\nthe settlement of international disputes by peaceful \r\nmeans, as reflected in the United Nations Charter, and \r\nin such a manner that international peace and security \r\nand justice are not endangered.\r\nThe Movement endeavours to generate further \r\nprogress towards achieving full respect for international \r\nlaw, and in that regard commends the role of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice in promoting the peaceful \r\nsettlement of international disputes in accordance with \r\nthe relevant provisions of the United Nations Charter \r\nand the Statute of the Court, in particular Articles 33 \r\nand 94 of the Charter.\r\nWith regard to advisory opinions of the Court, the \r\nNAM urges the Security Council to make greater use of \r\nthe International Court of Justice, the principal judicial \r\norgan of the United Nations, as a source of advisory \r\nopinions and interpretation of relevant norms of \r\ninternational law, and on controversial issues. It further \r\nrequests the Council to use the Court as a source of \r\ninterpretation of relevant international law, and urges \r\nthe Council to consider allowing its decisions to be \r\nreviewed by the Court, bearing in mind the need to \r\nensure that they adhere to the United Nations Charter \r\nand international law. The Movement also invites the \r\nGeneral Assembly, other organs of the United Nations \r\nand the duly authorized specialized agencies to request \r\nadvisory opinions of the International Court of Justice \r\non legal questions arising within the scope of their \r\nactivities.\r\nThe Non-Aligned Movement reaffirms the \r\nimportance of the Court’s unanimous conclusion issued \r\non 8 July 1996 on the question concerning the Legality \r\nof the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons. On this, the \r\nInternational Court of Justice concluded that \r\n“there exists an obligation to pursue in good faith \r\nand bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to \r\nnuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict \r\nand effective international control”.\r\nThe Non-Aligned Movement continues to call for \r\nfull respect by Israel, the occupying Power, Member \r\n12-56915 7\r\nA/67/PV.29\r\nStates and the United Nations of the 9 July 2004 \r\nadvisory opinion of the International Court of Justice \r\non Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall \r\nin the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and that they \r\nconsider the possibility of requesting a further advisory \r\nopinion from the Court regarding the prolonged Israeli \r\noccupation of the Palestinian territory since 1967.\r\nMr. Rowe (Australia): On behalf of Canada, New \r\nZealand and my own country, Australia — the CANZ \r\ngroup — I would like to thank the President of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, Judge Tomka, for his \r\ninformative report on the work of the Court for the \r\nperiod 1 August 2011 to 31 July 2012 (A/67/4). \r\nCANZ continues to strongly support the Court \r\nin its role as the principal judicial organ of the \r\nUnited Nations. The sustained caseload of the Court, \r\ncovering a diversity of subject matter and geographic \r\ncircumstance, demonstrates the universal appeal of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice and the vital role it plays \r\nin the promotion of the rule of law.\r\nAs we review the Court’s work over the reporting \r\nperiod, we see that cases before the Court are increasing \r\nin factual and legal complexity and continue to include \r\nissues at the forefront of international justice. We \r\ncommend the Court for its ongoing efforts to increase \r\nits efficiency and sustain its increased workload. In that \r\nregard, we welcome President Tomka’s statement to the \r\nStates Members of the United Nations in September \r\nthis year that the Court has more than doubled its work \r\nrate since 1990. \r\nDuring the period under review, the Court has, \r\nas President Tomka mentioned, handed down four \r\njudgments, one advisory opinion and three orders, and \r\nit has now successfully cleared its backlog of cases. \r\nNevertheless, we know that the agenda of the Court in \r\nthe year ahead will remain heavily charged, as countries \r\ncontinue to affirm their confidence in the Court and its \r\nprimary role in the peaceful settlement of international \r\ndisputes. \r\nCANZ also welcomes the increased public \r\naccessibility to the work of the Court and the Court’s \r\nefforts to ensure the greatest possible public awareness \r\nthrough the Court’s publications, multimedia and \r\nwebsite, which now features the full body of the Court’s \r\njurisprudence. \r\nCANZ strongly believes that wider acceptance of \r\nthe compulsory jurisdiction of the Court would enable \r\nit to fulfil its role more effectively by permitting the \r\nCourt to move beyond jurisdictional issues and to the \r\nsubstance of disputes more quickly. Accordingly, we \r\ncontinue to urge Member States that have not done so \r\nto deposit with the Secretary-General a declaration of \r\nacceptance of the Court’s compulsory jurisdiction. \r\nFinally, Canada, New Zealand and Australia \r\nwould like to express their appreciation for the \r\ntremendous contributions of Judges Koroma, Simma \r\nand Al-Khasawneh to the development of international \r\nlaw through their work as members of the Court, and \r\nwe wish them all well in their future endeavours. We \r\nalso congratulate Judges Bhandari, Gaja and Sebutinde \r\non their recent election to the Court. \r\nMs. Heptulla (India): I extend my sincere gratitude \r\nto Judge Peter Tomka, President of the International \r\nCourt of Justice, for his comprehensive and detailed \r\nreport (A/67/4) covering the judicial activities of \r\nthe Court over the past year. I also thank him and \r\nVice-President Judge Bernardo Sepúlveda-Amor for \r\ntheir leadership of the Court over that period.\r\nIndia attaches the highest importance to the \r\nCourt as the principal judicial organ of the United \r\nNations. The foremost purpose of the United Nations \r\nis the maintenance of international peace and security. \r\nThe peaceful settlement of international disputes is \r\nfundamental to achieving that objective. The Court \r\nhas fulfilled admirably the task of resolving disputes \r\npeacefully since its establishment.\r\nThe Court remains the only judicial body with \r\nlegitimacy derived from the United Nations Charter and \r\nenjoying universal character with general jurisdiction, \r\nwhereas other international judicial institutions have \r\ncompetence and jurisdiction in specific areas only. \r\nThe Statute of the International Court of Justice is an \r\nintegral part of the Charter. This is a unique status \r\nenjoyed by the Court among the international courts \r\nand tribunals.\r\nAs stated in the Preamble to the Charter, one of \r\nthe primary goals of the United Nations is to establish \r\nconditions under which justice and respect for the \r\nobligations of international law can be maintained. The \r\nInternational Court of Justice, as the only international \r\ncourt with general international law jurisdiction, is \r\nuniquely placed to fulfil that role. The report of the \r\nCourt clearly illustrates the confidence that States have \r\nreposed in it, as shown by the number and scope of cases \r\nentrusted to it and the Court’s growing specialization \r\n8 12-56915\r\nA/67/PV.29\r\nrelations. My country has been involved twice in the \r\nrecent past in proceedings before the International \r\nCourt of Justice. I have in mind the case concerning \r\nMaritime Delimitation in the Black Sea (Romania v. \r\nUkraine), which was settled by the Court by a Judgment \r\nrendered unanimously on 3 February 2009, and the \r\nproceedings of the advisory opinion on the question of \r\nthe accordance with international law of the unilateral \r\ndeclaration of independence in respect of Kosovo. We \r\nhave thus had the opportunity to convince ourselves of \r\nthe efficiency and the professionalism, as well as the \r\nfull impartiality, of the Court. We are confident that \r\nthe submission of disputes to international adjudication \r\nis preferable to protracted bilateral talks and is capable \r\nof removing sensitive issues from the political agenda. \r\nThe increasing number of cases on the docket of \r\nthe Court and the reference to the jurisdiction of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice in numerous conventions \r\nof universal application stand as proof of the expanding \r\nrole of the Court. \r\nThe judgments and the advisory opinion issued \r\nin the past year gave, in our opinion, important clues \r\nabout the current stage of certain issues of customary \r\ninternational law. In particular, the judgment in the \r\ncase concerning Jurisdictional Immunities of the \r\nState (Germany v. Italy: Greece intervening) offered \r\nguidance with respect to the customary international \r\nnorms concerning an issue that we consider to be \r\nimportant — the immunity of States. Moreover, \r\nwe note that the judgment in the case concerning \r\nQuestions relating to the Obligation to Prosecute or \r\nExtradite (Belgium v. Senegal) not only provided for \r\nthe interpretation and application of the Convention \r\nagainst Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading \r\nTreatment or Punishment, but also made a clear \r\nstatement on the fact that the prohibition of torture has \r\nbecome part of peremptory norms of international law, \r\nor jus cogens. \r\nThe Court is the highest judicial organ of the United \r\nNations and has an acknowledged body of pre-eminent \r\nprofessionals in the legal field. We think that the United \r\nNations and its Member States must do everything to \r\nmaintain and consolidate its high professional status \r\nand to improve the procedures before the Court, \r\nwhile complying with its Statute. We acknowledge \r\nsome recent debates related to an International Court \r\nof Justice bar meant to improve the quality of legal \r\nrepresentation before the Court.\r\nin complex aspects of public international law. This \r\nclearly establishes the universality of the Court.\r\nDuring the past year, the Court has handed down \r\nfour judgments and one advisory opinion. The Court \r\nhas in one judgment highlighted the significance of the \r\nprinciple of the sovereign immunity of States. In another \r\njudgment, the Court has confirmed the relevance of the \r\nprinciple of either prosecute or extradite. The Court’s \r\ndocket of pending cases has grown consistently in \r\nfactual and legal complexity. Presently, the number of \r\npending contentious cases stands at 11, involving States \r\nall over the world.\r\nSince its inception, the Court has dealt with a \r\nvariety of complex legal issues. The subject matter of \r\ncases before the Court has varied widely, including \r\nterritorial and maritime disputes, environmental \r\ndamage, violation of territorial integrity, violation \r\nof international humanitarian law and human rights, \r\ngenocide, and the interpretation and application of \r\ninternational treaties.\r\nThe Court has remained highly sensitive in \r\nrespecting the political realities and sentiments of \r\nStates, while acting within the provisions of the \r\nUnited Nations Charter, its own Statute and other \r\napplicable international law. The Court has contributed \r\nsignificantly towards settling legal disputes between \r\nsovereign States, thus promoting the rule of law in \r\ninternational relations. Through its second function of \r\nproviding advisory opinions on legal questions referred \r\nto it by organs of the United Nations and specialized \r\nagencies, the Court continues to fulfil the important \r\nrole of clarifying key international law issues.\r\nI am glad to note that the Court has taken significant \r\nsteps in recent years to enhance its own efficiency in \r\norder to be able to cope with the steady increase in its \r\nworkload. We are happy to note that, accordingly, the \r\nCourt has successfully cleared its backlog of cases, \r\nwhich further strengthens the confidence of States in \r\nthe Court’s competency and efficiency.\r\nI wish to reiterate in my concluding remarks the \r\ngreat importance the international community attaches \r\nto the work of the International Court of Justice, and \r\nto draw the Assembly’s attention to the importance of \r\nstrengthening the functioning of the Court by providing \r\nall necessarily required means.\r\nMr. Galea (Romania): Romania is a strong supporter \r\nof the role played by the International Court of Justice \r\nin the promotion of the rule of law in international \r\n12-56915 9\r\nA/67/PV.29\r\nthe Court — an obligation that arises specifically and \r\ndirectly from Article 94 of the Charter.\r\nConsequently, Peru believes it extremely important \r\nthat the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice \r\nbe universally accepted by all States. According to the \r\nCourt’s latest report (A/67/4), to date 67 States have \r\naccepted it, pursuant to paragraph 2 of article 36 of its \r\nStatute. In that regard, Peru calls urgently on States that \r\nhave not yet done so to accept the Court’s compulsory \r\njurisdiction over contentious issues and encourages the \r\nSecretary-General to pursue his efforts to promote this \r\ncause.\r\nWe reiterate our full support for the work of the \r\nCourt in its adjudicating and consulting roles, and \r\nhighlight the high-profile work of its judges as first-\r\nrate legal officials whose effective management has \r\nenabled the Court to fulfil its mandate as the principal \r\njudicial organ of the United Nations system. It behoves \r\nMember States to ensure that the Court enjoys the \r\nresources adequate to performing its work. In that \r\nregard, we believe that the positive response to the \r\nrequest mentioned in paragraph 24 of the report for an \r\nassociate legal officer within the Department of Legal \r\nMatters would strengthen the Court’s ability to manage \r\nits workload. In that context, we note with concern the \r\nobservations made by the President of the Court in his \r\nexplanatory memorandum (A/66/726, annex), in which \r\nhe refers to the need for the correct balance to be struck \r\nin order to ensure that budgetary limitations in no way \r\nimpair the Court’s important work.\r\nMr. Schaper (Netherlands), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nLastly, Peru wishes to point out that recourse to \r\nthe International Court of Justice is a commitment \r\nto peace whereby States emphatically reaffirm their \r\ncommitment to the rule of law and the well-being of \r\ntheir peoples, fully consistent with the principles and \r\npurposes enshrined in the United Nations Charter.\r\nMr. Song (Singapore): My delegation would like to \r\nexpress its thanks to the International Court of Justice \r\nfor the comprehensive and informative report on its \r\nwork from 1 August 2011 to 31 July 2012 (A/67/4). It is \r\nevident that the Court has had an extremely busy year \r\ndealing with a myriad of legal issues. It is therefore a \r\ntestament to the leadership of President Peter Tomka \r\nand former President Hisashi Owada that the Court has \r\nbeen able to discharge its duties with the highest  level \r\nof competence, efficiency and professionalism.\r\nGiven our firm support for the International \r\nCourt of Justice, we intend to start a national debate \r\nconcerning the possibility of accepting the compulsory \r\njurisdiction of the Court.\r\nMr. Bonifaz (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): I would \r\nlike to thank the President of the International Court of \r\nJustice, Judge Peter Tomka, for being here this morning \r\nand for his interesting presentation on the intensive \r\nwork carried out by the Court from 1 August 2011 to \r\n31 July 2012. \r\nThe establishment of the International Court of \r\nJustice as a principal organ of the United Nations sought \r\nto create a universal system allowing States to resolve \r\ntheir differences peacefully. This year, we celebrate \r\nthe thirtieth anniversary of the Manila Declaration \r\non the Peaceful Settlement of International Disputes, \r\nwhich was adopted by consensus on 15 November 1982, \r\nin resolution 37/10. In this regard, it is always worth \r\nrecalling that the Manila Declaration reiterates that \r\nlegal disputes should, as a general rule, be submitted by \r\nthe parties to the International Court of Justice and that \r\nthis submission should not be considered an unfriendly \r\nact by States. \r\nMoreover, this session of the General Assembly \r\nis of particular significance for the work of the Court, \r\nsince the President of the General Assembly himself, \r\nduring his statement at the general debate of the sixty-\r\nseventh session of the Assembly, invited all States to \r\nspeak under the theme of “Bringing about adjustment \r\nor settlement of international disputes or situations by \r\npeaceful means”. That is why the Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of Peru, during his statement in the general \r\ndebate, stated that:\r\n“Peru reaffirms its full respect for the work of the \r\nCourt and calls on States to turn to it to resolve \r\ntheir differences and to respect and comply with its \r\ndecisions, pursuant to Chapter XIV of the United \r\nNations Charter.” (A/67/PV.14, p. 37)\r\nLikewise, on 24 September, the High-level Meeting \r\non the Rule of Law at the National and International \r\nLevels was held and a Declaration (resolution 67/1) \r\nadopted, recognizing the positive contribution of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice and the importance of \r\nits work in promoting the rule of law. The Declaration \r\nof the High-level Meeting of the General Assembly \r\non the Rule of Law at the National and International \r\nLevels reaffirms, among other things, the obligation \r\nof States to respect and comply with the decisions of \r\n10 12-56915\r\nA/67/PV.29\r\nIt is Singapore’s firmly held view that international \r\nrelations must be governed by the rule of law in order to \r\npreserve international peace and stability. Fundamental \r\nto the rule of law is the notion that disputes must be \r\nresolved by peaceful means. Where disputes fail \r\nto be resolved through informal processes such as \r\nnegotiations or mediation, serious consideration should \r\nbe given to having them adjudicated by a neutral third \r\nparty.\r\nNeedless to say, the Court plays a vital role in that \r\nregard. Under international law, there is no formal \r\nhierarchy among the various judicial mechanisms and \r\ninternational tribunals, but the Court unquestionably \r\ncommands immense prestige and authority. First, it is \r\nthe only international court of a universal character with \r\ngeneral jurisdiction. Secondly, it is the principal judicial \r\norgan of the United Nations and draws on a heritage \r\ndating back to the Permanent Court of International \r\nJustice. Its judgments have been and continue to be \r\nextremely influential, and have a deep impact on the \r\ndevelopment of international law. The Court therefore \r\nplays a fundamental role in ensuring that the rule \r\nof law in international relations is maintained and \r\nstrengthened.\r\nDuring the period covered by the report, there \r\nwere a number of jurisprudential developments of \r\nparticular interest to my delegation. We note that \r\nthe Court has taken the opportunity to clarify the \r\njurisprudence relating to its jurisdiction in response to \r\nrequests to adjudicate and render advisory opinions. \r\nSuch clarifications are useful in this developing area \r\nof international law, and given the growing number \r\nof cases where such arguments are being made, we \r\nanticipate that in future there will be other occasions \r\nfor further elaboration and development.\r\nWe also note the increasing number of disputes \r\ninvolving issues of environmental law being brought \r\nbefore the Court. We look forward to hearing the Court’s \r\nviews on such issues, given the dynamic growth of this \r\narea of law and their relevance to the global community.\r\nWe also keenly followed the Court’s deliberations in \r\nthe case concerning Questions relating to the Obligation \r\nto Prosecute or Extradite (Belgium v. Senegal). \r\nThe interpretation of this obligation concerns the \r\ninternational community as a whole, given the \r\nprevalence of such clauses in a whole range of \r\ninternational treaties, including those on counter-\r\nterrorism. It is no coincidence that the International \r\nLaw Commission is also in the process of examining \r\nthis issue and has in fact specifically noted that an \r\nin-depth analysis of the case will be conducted in order \r\nto fully assess its implications for the topic.\r\nWith regard to the Court’s administration, my \r\ndelegation applauds the Court for successfully clearing \r\nits backlog of cases. We share its confidence that States \r\nconsidering coming to the principal judicial organ of the \r\nUnited Nations can now be assured that as soon as the \r\nwritten phase of the proceedings has come to a close, \r\nthe Court will be able to move to the oral proceedings \r\nin a timely manner. We are also encouraged to read that \r\nwork is proceeding on modernization of the Great Hall \r\nof Justice, including the introduction of information \r\ntechnology resources on the judges’ bench, and we look \r\nforward to its speedy completion.\r\nSingapore notes the Court’s request for the creation \r\nof an associate legal officer post (P-2) within the \r\nDepartment of Legal Matters in its budget submission \r\nfor the biennium 2012-2013, which was not granted. \r\nMy delegation’s view is that the request was not made \r\nlightly, given the efforts of the Court to increase its \r\nefficiency, including holding deliberations on several \r\ncases simultaneously. Considering the central role \r\nthe Court plays and the range of issues which it has \r\nto deal with, including those of a highly complex and \r\ncontroversial nature, it is only right that we support this \r\nrequest.\r\nIn conclusion, Singapore reiterates its belief that \r\nthe Court plays a vital role in ensuring the existence and \r\nmaintenance of the rule of law in international relations. \r\nWe continue to hold the Court in highest regard and \r\npledge our continued support for its work. We wish it \r\nevery success in meeting its future challenges and in \r\ndischarging its duties for the year ahead.\r\nMr. De Vega (Philippines): At the outset, the \r\nPhilippines aligns itself with the statement made earlier \r\nby the representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran on \r\nbehalf of the Non-Aligned Movement.\r\nWe thank President Peter Tomka and his team at \r\nThe Hague for their comprehensive report (A/67/4) on \r\nthe work of the International Court of Justice in the past \r\nyear. After perusing that report, my delegation has a \r\nfew recollections, reflections and hopes to express.\r\nThe first recollection is the very basis for the Court. \r\nArticle 92 of the Charter of the United Nations defines \r\nthe Court as the principal judicial organ of the United \r\nNations.\r\n12-56915 11\r\nA/67/PV.29\r\neconomic independence. The Declaration supported \r\ntheir aspirations by articulating the norms of the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes as outlined in Chapter \r\nVI of the United Nations Charter. Of the eight means \r\nfor the peaceful settlement of disputes outlined in part \r\nI, paragraph 5, of the Manila Declaration, judicial \r\nsettlement, specifically through the Court, is the most \r\nformal and perhaps the most rules-based means. May I \r\ntherefore emphasize that if a party to a dispute moves \r\nfor a judicial settlement of the dispute by the Court, that \r\nis not an unfriendly act and should not be taken as such \r\nby the other party to the dispute.\r\nOur second reflection builds on the continuing \r\nrelevance of the Court. There is now a greater need for \r\nits services. Beginning with the case of Corfu Channel \r\n(United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland \r\nv. Albania) in 1947 until the adoption in 1982 of the \r\nManila Declaration — a span of 35 years — the Court \r\ndisposed of 49 contentious cases. Since 1982, however, \r\nthe caseload of the Court has increased, and it disposed \r\nof 76 contentious cases in a comparably briefer period.\r\nThis apparently increasing confidence in the \r\ncapabilities, credibility and impartiality of the Court, \r\nparticularly among developing countries, is not \r\nwholly unrelated to the norms, values and aspirations \r\narticulated by the Manila Declaration on the Peaceful \r\nSettlement of International Disputes. After all, the \r\nDeclaration reflects the international community’s \r\nincreasing reliance on the rule of law as a cornerstone \r\nnot only of the peaceful settlement of disputes, but also \r\nof the maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nContinuing with the arc of peace, law and justice \r\nin international relations, our third reflection is that the \r\nmandate and jurisdiction of the Court are sharper than \r\never before. The creation of the International Criminal \r\nCourt and specialized dispute-settlement mechanisms, \r\nsuch as the International Tribunal for the Law of \r\nthe Sea and the Appellate Body of the World Trade \r\nOrganization, do not make the Court any less important \r\nin the twenty-first century. On the contrary, the new \r\ninternational legal architecture only strengthens \r\nthe Court as the only forum for resolving justiciable \r\ndisputes between States concerning the vast field of \r\ngeneral international law.\r\nThis brings us to our fourth reflection. Through the \r\nwork of the Court, we appreciate even more why States \r\nchoose to put a limit on their sovereignty by agreeing \r\nto customary and novel rules of international law. Quite \r\nsimply, it is in our national interest to do so. International \r\nThe second recollection is the purpose of the Court. \r\nIt resolves disputes that cannot otherwise be resolved \r\nby or through the political organs of the United Nations. \r\nIn other words, it resolves legal or justiciable disputes. \r\nUnder Article 38 of the Statute of the Court, those are \r\ndisputes capable of settlement through the application \r\nof the sources of international law: treaty, international \r\ncustom, general principles of law and, as subsidiary \r\nsources, judicial decisions and the teachings of the \r\nmost highly qualified publicists.\r\nThe third recollection is the relevance of the Court. \r\nOn September 24, for the first time since international \r\nlaw created the United Nations 67 years ago, we finally \r\ndevoted a high-level meeting to the rule of law at the \r\nnational and international levels (A/67/PV.3). We \r\nadopted resolution 67/1, which recognizes that, across \r\nand beyond the United Nations system, we have the \r\ninstitutions, the working methods and the relationships \r\nto make the rule of law relevant to peace and security, \r\nto human rights and to development.\r\nOne of those institutions is none other than \r\nthe Court. In paragraph 31 of the Declaration, we \r\nrecognized its positive contribution in promoting the \r\nrule of law. We also affirmed our duty to comply with \r\nits decisions in contentious cases. The Philippines \r\napproaches the rule of law at the international level \r\nfrom the prism of Article 1, paragraph 1 of the United \r\nNations Charter, which lays down that one purpose of \r\nthe Organization is \r\n“to bring about by peaceful means, and in conformity \r\nwith the principles of justice and international law, \r\nadjustment or settlement of international disputes \r\nor situations which might lead to a breach of the \r\npeace”.\r\nGuided by that inspiration, the Philippines reiterates \r\nits categorical support for the President’s overriding \r\npriority for his presidency, as reflected in his choice for \r\nthe theme of this session. That is the very rationale for \r\nthe 1982 Manila Declaration on the Peaceful Settlement \r\nof International Disputes (resolution 37/10, annex), \r\nwhose thirtieth anniversary we will commemorate on \r\n15 November.\r\nMay I now share our first ref lection. There is no \r\ndoubt that the Court continues to play a vital role in \r\ninternational relations. I shall explain. The Manila \r\nDeclaration was negotiated and adopted by the General \r\nAssembly during the Cold War, when non-aligned \r\ncountries were seeking to consolidate their political and \r\n12 12-56915\r\nA/67/PV.29\r\nMy Government fully appreciates that the Court \r\nis also at its busiest time in its history, particularly \r\nover the last few years, and that its work schedule has \r\nreached its maximum level. \r\nAs President Tomka mentioned in his statement \r\nat the High-level Meeting on the Rule of Law at the \r\nNational and International Levels, held on 24 September \r\n(see A/67/PV.3), the Court has rendered 60 judgments \r\nsince 1990, as compared to the 52 delivered during \r\nits first 44 years. That achievement is all the more \r\nremarkable in the light of the fact that the Court \r\nmaintained high-quality work through the judicial \r\nrigour of the members of the Court, with the support \r\nof the highly dedicated Registry. That is an element \r\nthat truly places the Court as the principal judicial \r\norgan of the United Nations. Japan commends the \r\nCourt for continuing to make efforts to re-examine its \r\nprocedures and working methods in order to conduct \r\nits activities in a sustainable manner while assuming \r\nthe challenging task of warranting impartiality against \r\npolitical pressure and maintaining respect for equality \r\nbetween parties to a dispute.\r\nAs the recently held High-level Meeting made \r\nvery clear, the enhancement of the rule of law has now \r\nbecome a common priority agenda of the international \r\ncommunity. Indeed, again at no time in history \r\nhave we heard daily of the mounting expectations \r\nacross the globe for international law to serve as a \r\ndevice for disentangling heated controversies and \r\ndifusing tensions by providing actors with a common \r\nlanguage. My Government strongly believes that the \r\ninternational community must seize this moment to \r\nmake international law play a more important role \r\nin international relations. The threat or use of force \r\nare prohibited under international law and should no \r\nlonger be resorted to as a means to resolve conflicts. \r\nBut the reality is that more needs to be done. The \r\ninternational community as a whole needs to recommit \r\nitself to establishing the primacy of international law, \r\nas well as to settling disputes through peaceful means, \r\nincluding by judicial mechanisms. Japan is committed \r\nto upholding the rule of law in international relations. \r\nAs my Government has reiterated on many occasions, \r\nthe universal acceptance of the Court’s jurisdiction by \r\nMember States is a key step forward in enabling the \r\nenhancement of the rule of law at the international level. \r\nJapan itself has steadfastly accepted the compulsory \r\njurisdiction of the Court since 1958. Our delegation \r\nlaw is even more important for developing or, if you \r\nwill, less powerful countries. Only a strong rule of law \r\nat the international level can guarantee the respect, \r\norder and stability that we desire and deserve. That is \r\nhow we contribute to the progressive development of \r\ninternational law.\r\nIf there is anything that the United Nations Charter \r\nand the Statute, jurisprudence and experience of the \r\nCourt all teach us, it is that the weak, if their cause is \r\njust, should have no fear of the mighty; it is that, through \r\nthe work of the Court, the rule of law in international \r\nrelations has a chance to prevail; it is that, through the \r\nrule of law, we can demonstrate that right is might.\r\nThe Philippines welcomes the recent election of \r\nfive new members of the Security Council. They are \r\nfriends who have a strong record on peace and security, \r\nas well as the rule of law at the international level. With \r\nthat development, I end my statement by expressing \r\nthe hope that was expressed earlier on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement. We hope that the Security \r\nCouncil will consider Article 96 of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations by making greater use of the Court as \r\na source of advisory opinions and of interpretation of \r\nrelevant norms of international law, particularly on \r\nthe most current and controversial issues affecting \r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nMr. Nishida (Japan): At the outset, I would like to \r\ncongratulate President Peter Tomka on his election as \r\nPresident of the International Court of Justice and to \r\nthank him for his comprehensive and detailed report \r\n(A/67/4) on the praiseworthy work of the Court over \r\nthe past year. His report highlights the important role \r\nthat the Court plays in inter-State conflict resolution \r\nby peaceful means. Japan would like to take this \r\nopportunity to commend the work of the Court under \r\nthe leadership of President Tomka.\r\nAt no time in history has the Court occupied such \r\na preponderant role in the international legal system as \r\nit does at this present time. Our delegation welcomes \r\nthe growing trend towards a greater use of the Court \r\nby Member States in all corners of the world. The wide \r\nvariety of the subject matters of the disputes referred to \r\nthe International Court of Justice, from territorial and \r\nmaritime boundary questions to rights of individuals, \r\nfurther testifies to the confidence that Member States \r\nplace in the vigorous judicial work achieved by the \r\nCourt.\r\n12-56915 13\r\nA/67/PV.29\r\nAt the opening of the sixty-seventh session of \r\nthe General Assembly, on the occasion of the High-\r\nlevel Meeting on the Rule of Law at the National and \r\nInternational Levels, on 24 September (see A/67/PV.3), \r\nStates made solemn pledges relating to the rule of \r\nlaw. In that framework, among other things, Italy \r\nannounced its readiness to accept the compulsory \r\njurisdiction of the International Court of Justice under \r\nArticle 36 of its Statute. Even in the absence of that \r\ndeclaration, Italy had already agreed to submit disputes \r\nto the Court on a number of occasions. By accepting \r\nthe compulsory jurisdiction of the Court, Italy is now \r\ndetermined to take a further step towards strengthening \r\nthe foundations for an age of accountability. It is also \r\nreaffirming its commitment to the rule of law as a pillar \r\nof its foreign policy.\r\nThe broader the acceptance of the compulsory \r\njurisdiction of the Court is, the stronger the chances \r\nare for a more just and peaceful world. Respect for \r\ninternational law is to be achieved in practice through \r\ncompliance with the law and its enforcement.\r\nMr. Fife (Norway): I would like to start by thanking \r\nthe International Court of Justice, the principal judicial \r\norgan of the United Nations, for its annual report \r\n(A/67/4) to the General Assembly. I would also like \r\nto express my gratitude to its President, Judge Peter \r\nTomka, for his able presentation.\r\nAs one of the principal organs of the United Nations \r\nand the only international court of a universal character \r\nwith general jurisdiction, the Court occupies a special \r\nposition. It plays a significant role in the promotion of the \r\nrule of law through its judicial activities in contentious \r\ncases and through its advisory opinions. That was also \r\nduly noted at the plenary High-level Meeting on the \r\nRule of Law at the National and International Levels, \r\nheld here in New York on 24 September (see A/67/\r\nPV.3).\r\nAs noted in the report of the Court, almost as an \r\nunderstatement, the subject matter in the cases referred \r\nto the Court has varied widely. Moreover, those cases \r\nare growing in factual and legal complexity. Also for \r\nthose reasons, the Court is particularly well placed to \r\nprovide guidance, through its judicial activities, on how \r\nto counter difficulties arising from the diversification \r\nand expansion of international law, which is sometimes \r\nreferred to as the fragmentation of international law. \r\nWe are convinced that the cohesion of international \r\nlaw is actively promoted notably through a coherent \r\ncalls upon all Member States that have not yet done so \r\nto accept the jurisdiction of the Court.\r\nFinally, we cannot overemphasize the importance \r\nof strengthening the functioning of the Court. Japan \r\nwill continue to contribute to the efficient and effective \r\nwork of the International Court of Justice and wishes \r\nthe Court every success in its endeavours.\r\nMr. Ragaglini (Italy): It is a privilege for me today \r\nto address the General Assembly on its consideration of \r\nthe annual report of the International Court of Justice \r\n(A/67/4). I wish to congratulate Judge Peter Tomka on \r\nhis election as the President of the International Court of \r\nJustice. I am certain that, under his able leadership, the \r\nworld Court will continue to meet the expectations and \r\nthe needs of the international community. I would also \r\nlike to thank President Tomka for his comprehensive \r\nreport, which illustrates very well the renewed pivotal \r\nrole of the Court at the present juncture in international \r\nrelations.\r\nOn 3 February, the Court issued a Judgment \r\non a dispute between Germany and Italy relating to \r\nJurisdictional Immunities of the State (Germany v. \r\nItaly: Greece intervening). Just a few weeks after the \r\nJudgment, Italy’s domestic courts provided for its \r\nimplementation in accordance with Article 94 of the \r\nStatute of the International Court of Justice. Currently, \r\nthe adoption of specific legislation to further strengthen \r\ncompliance with the Court’s Judgment is under way. \r\nThe prompt response both by the judiciary and the \r\nGovernment and Parliament of Italy shows the strong \r\ncommitment of the entire Italian legal system to the \r\nrule of law.\r\nOn a more general note, President Jeremić has \r\nchosen “Bringing about adjustment or settlement of \r\ninternational disputes or situations by peaceful means” \r\nas the theme for the sixty-seventh session of the General \r\nAssembly. We think that the choice is very appropriate.\r\nStates have an obligation under the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations to settle their disputes peacefully. That \r\nobligation not only entails the peaceful resolution of \r\ndisputes but also indicates that international disputes \r\nmust be settled. Any policy of protracted non-compliance \r\nwith international law or any attempt to delay the \r\nexecution of obligations f lowing from international \r\nrules creates tensions and fosters unfriendly relations. \r\nIn some areas, it may be to the detriment of common \r\nbattles to combat crime and strengthen the rule of law.\r\n14 12-56915\r\nA/67/PV.29\r\nWe are also pleased to note that in its fi rst delimitation \r\nJudgment in the Dispute concerning delimitation \r\nof the maritime boundary between Bangladesh and \r\nMyanmar in the Bay of Bengal (Bangladesh/Myanmar), \r\ndelivered in March, the International Tribunal for the \r\nLaw of the Sea also confirmed the cohesive body of law \r\ndeveloped by the Court, thus contributing to further \r\nconsolidation and preventing the fragmentation of \r\ninternational law in that field. That comes in addition to \r\nsimilar contributions made by ad hoc arbitral tribunals \r\nestablished to resolve maritime delimitation issues in \r\nthe recent past.\r\nI would like to conclude by reiterating Norway’s \r\nlong-standing and unwavering support for the \r\nInternational Court of Justice as a cornerstone of the \r\ninternational legal order.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on this item for this meeting. \r\nAs announced at the beginning of the meeting, we \r\nshall hear the remaining speakers at a later date to be \r\nannounced.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly takes note of \r\nthe report of the International Court of Justice (A/67/4)?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: The General Assembly has \r\nthus concluded this stage of its consideration of agenda \r\nitem 71.\r\nAgenda item 74\r\nReport of the International Criminal Court\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/67/378 and \r\nA/67/378/Add.1)\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/67/308)\r\nThe Acting President: It is now my great honour \r\nto welcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Sang-Hyun Song, President of the International \r\nCriminal Court. I now give him the f loor.\r\nMr. Sang-Hyun Song (International Criminal \r\nCourt): I am honoured to take the f loor before the \r\nAssembly for the fourth time to deliver the annual \r\nreport of the International Criminal Court’s (ICC) to \r\nthe United Nations (A/67/308). \r\nComing to the General Assembly on behalf of the \r\nICC gives me the feeling of a grown-up child returning \r\nto his parental home once a year to talk about his \r\ninterpretation of treaties on the basis of the principles \r\nand rules contained in the Vienna Convention on the \r\nLaw of Treaties.\r\nThe reporting period was marked by a number \r\nof significant decisions on the part of the Court. We \r\nwould also like to commend the Court for the steps it \r\nhas taken to enhance its efficiency and to cope with the \r\nsteady increase in its workload.\r\nWe note with appreciation that it has successfully \r\ncleared its backlog of cases, as explained in the report.\r\nIt is also against that background that Norway \r\nnotes that the potential for the active use of the Court \r\nas a key organ for the peaceful settlement of disputes, \r\nin conformity with the Charter, actually surpasses \r\nthe number of States — 67 so far — that have made a \r\ndeclaration recognizing the jurisdiction of the Court as \r\ncompulsory. In that regard, we welcome the national \r\ndebate just announced by Romania to that effect. Thus, \r\nsome 300 international agreements also provide for the \r\njurisdiction of the Court. Moreover, States may decide \r\nto agree on the referral of cases to the Court after the \r\nnegotiation of special agreements, where the parties \r\nmay agree on the specific issues they wish to submit \r\nto the Court.\r\nThe costs related to dispute settlement before the \r\nCourt should not discourage States from submitting \r\ntheir disputes for settlement. States that are able to do \r\nso should therefore consider contributing to the Trust \r\nFund to Assist States in the Settlement of Disputes \r\nthrough the International Court of Justice, established \r\nby the Secretary-General, from which States may apply \r\nfor financial support in order to finance their dispute \r\nsettlement or to comply with the Court’s judgments. In \r\nthat regard, I am pleased to announce that Norway has \r\ndecided to contribute $80,000 to the Trust Fund and \r\nwill proceed promptly with the transfer.\r\nThe International Court of Justice plays a crucial \r\nrole, not only in the resolution of contentious cases and \r\nthrough its advisory role but also in the clarification and \r\ndevelopment of international law at large. We welcome \r\nthe Court’s seminal contributions in various fields, \r\nincluding with regard to the development of the modern \r\nlaw of the sea, and in particular its role in consolidating \r\nand refining principles of maritime delimitation. In \r\ndoing so, the Court has provided invaluable guidance \r\nto States engaged in the negotiation of treaties on the \r\ndelimitation of their continental shelves and economic \r\nzones.\r\n12-56915 15\r\nA/67/PV.29\r\nFurthermore, the ICC has been seized of an eighth \r\nsituation following the Mali Government’s referral \r\nto the ICC Prosecutor of the situation in Mali since \r\nJanuary 2012 on 18 July. The Prosecutor is currently \r\nconducting a preliminary examination to determine \r\nwhether the criteria for opening an investigation have \r\nbeen fulfilled. \r\nLet me briefly address the state of judicial \r\nproceedings in each of the seven active situations. \r\nThe situation in the Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo was the first investigation opened by \r\nthe ICC Prosecutor in 2004, following a referral by \r\nthat country’s Government. The ICC’s first trial of \r\nMr. Thomas Lubanga Dyilo arose from that situation. \r\nOn 14 March 2012, Trial Chamber I rendered its \r\nverdict in the case, finding Mr. Lubanga guilty of the \r\nenlistment, conscription and use of children under the \r\nage of 15 to participate actively in hostilities in the Ituri \r\ndistrict between September 2002 and August 2003. On \r\n10 July, the Trial Chamber sentenced Mr. Lubanga to 14 \r\nyears’ imprisonment. On 7 August, the Chamber issued \r\nthe ICC’s first decision on reparations for victims, \r\nestablishing principles relating to reparations and \r\ntasking the Trust Fund for Victims to collect proposals \r\nfor reparations from victims. Let me stress that the \r\nverdict, sentence and reparations decision in the case \r\nof Mr. Lubanga are all under appeal and therefore not \r\nyet final. \r\nThe second trial relating to the conflict in Ituri \r\nagainst Mr. Katanga and Mr. Ngudjolo Chui concluded \r\nin May with closing statements. The Trial Chamber is \r\nexpected to issue its judgment in the coming months. \r\nThe ICC’s third case relating to Ituri is against \r\nMr. Bosco Ntaganda, who has evaded justice for the \r\npast seven years. A second arrest warrant was issued \r\nfor Mr. Ntaganda in July, expanding the allegations \r\nagainst him from the use of child soldiers to murder, \r\nrape, sexual slavery and other crimes. \r\nIn other developments related to the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo, Mr. Callixte Mbarushimana \r\nwas released from custody on 23 December 2011, \r\nfollowing the Pre-Trial Chamber’s ruling that there \r\nwas not sufficient evidence to substantiate the charges \r\nagainst him. In the meantime, a new arrest warrant has \r\nbeen issued on the basis of allegations related to the \r\nKivus region against Mr. Sylvestre Mudacumura, who \r\ncurrently remains at large. \r\nstudies, work and life. At 10 years old, the ICC is a \r\nthriving, independent organization with broad support. \r\nIt is the centrepiece of a new justice paradigm that has \r\nbeen joined by 121 States that have decided to bolster \r\ntheir national jurisdictions with an international court \r\nof last resort in order to prevent impunity for the gravest \r\ncrimes known to humankind.\r\nThat achievement would not have been possible \r\nwithout the formative role of the United Nations and, \r\nspecifically, the General Assembly, in the history \r\nof the International Criminal Court. The Assembly \r\nis where the seed of the ICC was first planted, with \r\nthe adoption of the Convention on the Prevention and \r\nPunishment of the Crime of Genocide and the early \r\nwork of the International Law Commission. That is \r\nwhere the process was revived in 1989, following the \r\nproposal by Trinidad and Tobago. It was the General \r\nAssembly that established the Preparatory Committee \r\non the Establishment of an International Criminal \r\nCourt. As the Assembly knows, the Rome Statute of \r\nthe International Criminal Court was adopted under the \r\nauspices of the United Nations on 17 July 1998.\r\nOn 1 July 2002, the Rome Statute entered into \r\nforce. Since then, the ICC has stood on its own feet, \r\nseparate from but closely connected to the United \r\nNations through our Relationship Agreement. During \r\nits first decade, the ICC has firmly established its role \r\nin a multilateral system that aims to end impunity. I \r\nwelcome the General Assembly’s recognition of that \r\nrole in the Declaration of the High-level Meeting of the \r\nGeneral Assembly on the Rule of Law at the National \r\nand International Levels (resolution 67/1), held on \r\n24 September. On behalf of the ICC, its elected officials \r\nand staff, I thank the General Assembly for all the \r\nsupport we have received from it.\r\nThe ICC’s written report provides a comprehensive \r\nupdate on the Court’s judicial proceedings covering the \r\nperiod from 1 August 2011 to 31 July 2012. Today I \r\nwill only highlight the most important developments \r\nthat have taken place since I last appeared before the \r\nAssembly (see A/66/PV.44).\r\nThere have been some important institutional \r\ndevelopments. Ms. B. Fatou Bensouda was sworn in as \r\nthe second Prosecutor of the ICC, six new judges were \r\nelected, and the new President of the Assembly of States \r\nParties took office. The ICC has continued investigations \r\nin seven situations — the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo; Uganda; the Central African Republic; Darfur, \r\nthe Sudan; Kenya; Libya; and, finally, Côte d’Ivoire. \r\n16 12-56915\r\nA/67/PV.29\r\nIn the situation in Uganda, arrest warrants against \r\nMr. Joseph Kony and three other alleged leaders of the \r\nLord’s Resistance Army have remained outstanding \r\nsince 2005. I find that unacceptable and an affront to all \r\nthose affected by the conflict in northern Uganda. Once \r\nagain, I strongly urge all relevant States to cooperate \r\nin order to reach the goal of bringing those persons to \r\njustice without delay. \r\nIn the situation in the Central African Republic, the \r\nICC’s third trial, of Mr. Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo, has \r\nmoved to the defence phase. The trial proceedings will \r\ncontinue well into next year. \r\nIn the situation in Darfur, the Sudan, one case is \r\nin the trial preparation phase — that of Mr. Banda and \r\nMr. Jerbo, who are accused of crimes allegedly committed \r\nduring an attack on African Union peacekeepers. Last \r\nweek, the Trial Chamber rejected the defence request \r\nfor a stay of proceedings and requested submissions \r\non the date for the commencement of the trial. A \r\nnew arrest warrant was issued in the Darfur situation \r\non 1 March against Mr. Abdel Raheem Muhammad \r\nHussein. Regrettably, Mr. Hussein remains at large, and \r\narrest warrants also remain outstanding in relation to \r\nthree other persons in the Darfur situation. I call upon \r\nall States to cooperate, with a view to executing those \r\narrest warrants in order that the suspects may face the \r\ngrave allegations asserted against them. \r\nThe two cases in the situation in Kenya have \r\nprogressed from the pre-trial to trial phase. Of the \r\nsix suspects, the Pre-Trial Chamber confirmed the \r\ncharges relating to post-election violence against four \r\nof them, while releasing the two others. Two trials, each \r\ninvolving two accused, are set to start next April. \r\nSignificant developments have occurred in the \r\nsituation in Côte d’Ivoire since I last addressed the \r\nAssembly. An arrest warrant was issued in relation to the \r\nformer President of the country, Mr. Laurent Gbagbo, \r\nand he was turned over to the ICC on 30 November \r\n2011. The case is currently in the pre-trial stage. \r\nI now come to the situation in Libya. The two \r\nsuspects subject to the ICC arrest warrants, Mr. Saif \r\nAl-Islam Al-Qadhafi and Mr. Abdullah Al-Senussi, are \r\nin the custody of Libyan authorities. An admissibility \r\nchallenge made by Libya is currently pending before \r\nthe Pre-Trial Chamber. In the context of the Libya \r\nsituation, last summer the ICC experienced a serious \r\ncrisis when four of our staff members were detained \r\nin Zintan, Libya, in the course of the exercise of their \r\nofficial duties. I would like to extend the ICC’s sincere \r\ngratitude to the United Nations and the many Member \r\nStates that helped the Court to secure the release and \r\nsafe return of our colleagues. \r\nWithout the assistance of States the ICC cannot \r\nperform its mandate effectively. I fully agree with \r\nthe emphasis that the Assembly’s Declaration of \r\n24 September placed on cooperation with the ICC \r\n(resolution 66/102). Cooperation is not merely a \r\nquestion of discharging obligations contained in the \r\nRome Statute. The international community, including \r\nthe General Assembly, has on multiple occasions \r\ndeclared its determination to end impunity for the \r\ngravest crimes. Cooperation with the ICC is a concrete \r\nway to give effect to that objective. \r\nA historic first debate on the ICC’s role, held in \r\nthe Security Council on 17 October (see S/PV.6849), \r\nwas a useful reminder of the specific challenges that \r\ncooperation poses in situations referred by the Council, \r\nnamely, those of Darfur and Libya. In those situations, \r\nthe ICC is exercising its mandate on behalf of the \r\nUnited Nations membership as a whole in that they \r\nwere referred to the ICC by the Security Council on the \r\nbasis of the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nBy way of resolutions adopted under Chapter VII, \r\nthe Security Council has urged all States to cooperate \r\nwith the ICC in the context of the Darfur and Libya \r\nsituations. The question of expenses incurred by the \r\nICC in the context of the referred situations was also \r\ndiscussed during the Security Council debate. In that \r\nrespect, I am grateful that the General Assembly, in its \r\nresolution 66/262, of 29 May 2012, invited all States to \r\nconsider making voluntary contributions towards such \r\nexpenses.\r\nThe Rome Statute empowers victims in multiple \r\nways — as participants in judicial proceedings, as \r\nrecipients of reparations following a conviction and \r\nas beneficiaries of victims’ assistance provided by \r\nthe Trust Fund for Victims that is associated with \r\nthe ICC. In that regard, the Rome Statute system \r\nhas unprecedented potential to bring retributive and \r\nrestorative justice closer to each other. Through its \r\nengagement in situation countries, the Trust Fund for \r\nVictims is able to give a human face to the process \r\nof international criminal justice. It has continued its \r\nimportant work with victims in northern Uganda and \r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo. Furthermore, \r\nit has officially notified the Pre-Trial Chamber of its \r\n12-56915 17\r\nA/67/PV.29\r\nintention to undertake programmes in the Central \r\nAfrican Republic, initially focusing on victims of \r\nsexual and gender-based violence. \r\nThe assistance that the Trust Fund for Victims \r\nis able to provide to victims depends upon voluntary \r\ndonations, which are also needed to fund reparations \r\nwhen a convicted person is indigent. As we get closer \r\nto the implementation of the first reparations orders, \r\nthe Trust Fund is in greater need of financial support \r\nthan ever before. I would like to thank those States that \r\nhave already generously supported the Trust Fund’s \r\nimportant work. I call upon others to join them in doing \r\nso, for the benefit of the victims of unspeakable crimes.\r\nThe Rome Statute system has changed the way that \r\nthe world looks at grave crimes under international \r\nlaw. With the advent of a permanent international court \r\nto prosecute such crimes, national jurisdictions have \r\nsimultaneously been encouraged and empowered to \r\nprevent impunity. As the Secretary-General said in that \r\nsame Security Council debate, \r\n“justice is crucial for breaking cycles of violence and \r\nfragility. Even the possibility of ICC engagement in \r\na given situation can create an incentive to set up \r\nlocal mechanisms to deliver justice”. \r\nI suffered the horrors of war as a small child. I would \r\nnot want anyone to experience what I went through in \r\nmy childhood. By enforcing norms of international law \r\nand by protecting those most vulnerable, with special \r\nattention to the needs of children and women, the ICC \r\nrepresents a giant leap in humankind’s efforts to ensure \r\nlasting peace and security for everyone.\r\nThe ICC is independent, but at the same time it is still \r\nthe world’s court. The community of nations created it \r\nout of the desire to protect the most fundamental values \r\nof concern to humankind as a whole. I wholeheartedly \r\nendorse the Assembly’s call upon States not yet party to \r\nthe Rome Statute to consider joining the ICC. \r\nPreventing grave crimes and combating impunity is \r\na shared interest of the entire international community. \r\nAs the ICC enters its second decade, it remains firmly \r\ncommitted to upholding the rule of law and the principles \r\nof judicial and prosecutorial independence, guided by \r\nthe Rome Statute and inspired by the common goals \r\nof humankind — values that we share with the United \r\nNations and the Assembly.\r\nThe Acting President: The debate on this agenda \r\nitem will take place on Tuesday, 6 November, following \r\nthe continuation of the debate on agenda item 71.\r\nThe General Assembly has thus concluded this \r\nstage of its consideration of agenda item 74.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nOrganization of work, adoption of the agenda and \r\nallocation of items\r\nLetter dated 29 October 2012 from \r\nthe Chair of the Committee on \r\nConferences addressed to the President \r\nof the General Assembly (A/67/352/Add.1)\r\nThe Acting President: Members are aware that, \r\npursuant to section I, paragraph 7, of resolution 40/243, \r\nno subsidiary organ of the General Assembly may \r\nmeet at United Nations Headquarters during a regular \r\nsession of the Assembly unless explicitly authorized by \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nAuthorization is thus sought for the United Nations \r\nAppeals Tribunal to hold one meeting in New York \r\nduring the main part of the sixty-seventh session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, on the strict understanding that the \r\nmeeting would be allocated conference services on an \r\nas-available basis from within existing resources and in \r\nsuch a way that the work of the General Assembly and \r\nits main Committees is not impeded.\r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of the General \r\nAssembly to authorize the United Nations Appeals \r\nTribunal to meet during the main part of the sixty-\r\nseventh session of the General Assembly?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe Acting President: I would like to \r\ninform members that the Assembly will consider \r\nagenda item 109 (b), “Election of eighteen \r\nmembers of the Economic and Social Council”, on \r\nThursday, 8 November. The item was previously \r\nscheduled to take place on Wednesday, 31 October.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.30 pm.\r\n"
