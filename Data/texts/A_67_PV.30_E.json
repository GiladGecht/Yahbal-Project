His prepared statement will \r\nsubsequently be issued as a note by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. Copies of the prepared statement are also \r\navailable here in the Hall. \r\nI now give the f loor to the representative of Canada \r\nto introduce draft resolution A/67/L.3.\r\nMs. Ventura (Canada): On behalf of the Canadian \r\ndelegation, acting on behalf of the Chair of the Board \r\nof Governors of the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency (IAEA), it is my pleasure to introduce the \r\ndraft resolution entitled “Report of the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency”. As colleagues are aware, \r\nthe General Assembly considers this draft resolution \r\nannually. It derives from a requirement pursuant to the \r\nIAEA statute and the 1957 Agreement governing the \r\nrelationship between the IAEA and the United Nations.\r\nThe draft resolution is the means by which the \r\nGeneral Assembly takes note of the statement of the \r\nIAEA Director General and of the resolutions and \r\ndecisions adopted by the General Conference, and \r\nrecognizes the work of the Agency.\r\nThe draft text before the General Assembly was \r\ndiscussed in Vienna among IAEA member States, as \r\nwell as during informal consultations here in New York.\r\nIt is a simple factual update of last year’s text \r\n(resolution 66/7) that merely changes the relevant dates \r\nand lists the relevant resolutions and decisions adopted \r\nby the General Conference at its fifty-sixth plenary \r\nmeeting.\r\nIt is my pleasure to commend this text for \r\nconsideration by the General Assembly. We sincerely \r\nhope that it will attract consensus again this year.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nobserver of the European Union.\r\nMr. Mayr-Harting (European Union): I have the \r\nhonour to speak on behalf of the European Union (EU). \r\nThe acceding country Croatia; the candidate countries \r\nthe former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, \r\nMontenegro, Iceland and Serbia; the countries of the \r\nStabilization and Association Process and potential \r\ncandidates Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina; the \r\nEuropean Free Trade Area countries Liechtenstein and \r\nNorway, members of the European Economic Area; as \r\nUnited Nations A/67/PV.30\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-seventh session\r\n30th plenary meeting\r\nMonday, 5 November 2012, 10 a.m.\r\nNew York\r\nOffi cial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Jeremić  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Serbia)\r\n2 12-57291\r\nA/67/PV.30\r\nwell as Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova, align \r\nthemselves with this statement.\r\nWe are pleased to support the draft resolution \r\nentitled “Report of the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency” (IAEA), a report that again reaffirms the \r\nindispensable role of the Agency with regard to the \r\nnon-proliferation of nuclear weapons, and in assisting \r\nthe development and practical application of atomic \r\nenergy for peaceful uses, as well as in technology \r\ntransfer and in nuclear verification, safety and security.\r\nThe European Union remains committed to effective \r\nmultilateral action against the proliferation of weapons \r\nof mass destruction and emphasizes the importance of \r\nuniversalizing the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT). We call on States that have not \r\ndone so to join the Treaty as non-nuclear-weapon States. \r\nThe EU welcomed the consensus reached on the Action \r\nPlan at the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the \r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. \r\nThe Action Plan, as well as the agreement on a process \r\nfor the implementation of the 1995 NPТ resolution on \r\nthe Middle East, including a conference on a zone free \r\nof weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East to be \r\nconvened in 2012, demonstrated our common resolve \r\nnot only to uphold but also to strengthen the nuclear \r\nnon-proliferation regime. In that respect, the EU \r\ncommends the Facilitator, His Excellency Mr. Jaakko \r\nLaajava, for the professional work and consultations \r\ncarried out, as well as for his report on the preparation \r\nof a 2012 conference on a zone free of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction in the Middle East presented during the \r\nNPT Preparatory Committee meeting held earlier this \r\nyear in Vienna.\r\nThe European Union recalls the IAEA forum \r\nheld in November 2011 on that issue and welcomes \r\nthe Agency’s support for the implementation of the \r\n1995 resolution, including through the preparation of \r\nbackground documentation for the 2012 conference \r\nregarding modalities for a zone free of nuclear weapons \r\nand other weapons of mass destruction and their \r\ndelivery systems, as requested by the 2010 NPT Review \r\nConference Action Plan. In that regard, with a view to \r\ncontributing to those international efforts, the European \r\nUnion is pleased to reaffirm its support for a process \r\nleading to the establishment of a zone free of weapons \r\nof mass destruction in the Middle East, as demonstrated \r\nby the recent adoption, on 23 July, of a new EU Council \r\ndecision. As announced at this year’s NPT Preparatory \r\nCommittee, the EU is pleased to announce that a track \r\n2 seminar by the EU Non-Proliferation Consortium is \r\ntaking place in Brussels today and tomorrow and is \r\nexpected to allow for an open exchange of views on all \r\naspects related to the creation of a zone free of weapons \r\nof mass destruction in the Middle East.\r\nThe 2010 NPT Review Conference reaffirmed the \r\nrole of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) \r\nin verifying and ensuring compliance by States with \r\ntheir safeguards obligations, with a view to preventing \r\nthe diversion of nuclear material from peaceful uses. \r\nThe European Union remains deeply concerned \r\nby the protracted and serious challenges to the \r\nnon-proliferation regime posed by the Islamic Republic \r\nof Iran, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and \r\nthe Syrian Arab Republic, concerns reinforced by the \r\nrecent reports of the Director General of the IAEA to \r\nthe Board of Governors. Once again, the Board felt it \r\nnecessary to adopt a resolution on Iran reaffirming the \r\nrequirements of its 2011 resolution and urging Iran to \r\ncomply fully and without delay with all its obligations \r\nunder the relevant resolutions of the Security Council, \r\nas well as to meet the requirements of the Board of \r\nGovernors, including the application of modified \r\nCode 3.1 and the implementation and prompt entry into \r\nforce of the Additional Protocol, The European Union \r\nfully supported the adoption of that resolution.\r\nThe European Union would like to stress again \r\nthat the Security Council, as the final arbiter of \r\ninternational peace and security, has the mandate to \r\ntake appropriate action in the event of non-compliance \r\nwith NPT obligations, including safeguards agreements. \r\nThe Agency’s system of safeguards is a fundamental \r\ncomponent of the nuclear non-proliferation regime and \r\nplays an indispensable role in the implementation of \r\nthe NPT. In that respect, the European Union would \r\nlike to express its satisfaction that the IAEA General \r\nConference adopted by an overwhelming majority a \r\nresolution entitled “Strengthening the effectiveness and \r\nimproving the efficiency of the safeguards system and \r\nthe application of the Model Additional Protocol”. The \r\nEuropean Union is grateful for the wide support received \r\nfrom the IAEA member States for what is traditionally \r\nan EU-sponsored resolution. The EU reiterates its view \r\nthat the measures contained in the model additional \r\nprotocol form an integral part of the IAEA safeguards \r\nsystem, and that comprehensive safeguards agreements, \r\ntogether with additional protocols, constitute the \r\ncurrent IAEA verification standard. The European \r\nUnion calls for the universalization of those two \r\n12-57291 3\r\nA/67/PV.30\r\nessential instruments of the IAEA safeguards system \r\nwithout delay.\r\nWith regard to nuclear safety, in particular with \r\nregard to the EU responses to the Fukushima Daiichi \r\nnuclear accident, I would like to mention that, on \r\n25 March 2011, the European Council called for \r\ncomprehensive risk and safety assessments — stress \r\ntests — to be conducted at European nuclear power \r\nplants. The 17 national reports — from 15 EU countries, \r\nSwitzerland and Ukraine — covering all nuclear power \r\nplants of the EU and of participating countries have \r\nbeen assessed by 80 reviewers from Europe. Many \r\nobservers from third countries also took part in that \r\nunprecedented initiative. The peer-reviewed report was \r\ntransmitted to the June 2012 European Council meeting. \r\nIn July, an action plan was agreed upon in order to \r\nfollow the implementation of the recommendations \r\nof the report. As requested by the European Council \r\nin March 2011, the European Commission will now \r\nexamine possible evolutions of European legislation, \r\nnotably of the nuclear safety directive, and submit them \r\nto Member States.\r\nThe EU attaches the utmost importance to the \r\nimplementation of the highest standards of nuclear \r\nsafety worldwide. International cooperation is crucial \r\nto promoting the global nuclear safety framework. \r\nIn that context, the Convention on Nuclear Safety, \r\nthe Convention on Assistance in Case of a Nuclear \r\nAccident or Radiological Emergency, the Convention on \r\nEarly Notification of a Nuclear Accident and the Joint \r\nConvention are instruments of major importance. The \r\nEuropean Union calls on all Member States that have \r\nnot yet done so to become contracting parties to the \r\nrelevant safety Conventions without delay. The IAEA \r\nAction Plan on Nuclear Safety is also an important \r\ninstrument that should be implemented by Member \r\nStates and the Secretariat.\r\nWe face a new era of threats from non-State actors, \r\nparticularly terrorists, who seek to acquire weapons of \r\nmass destruction and related technology and materials \r\nand present one of the potentially most destructive risks \r\nto global security. In the light of such ongoing threats, \r\nthe EU actively supports Security Council resolutions \r\n1540 (2004) and 1887 (2009), as well as a number of \r\nother international initiatives, such as the Group of \r\nEight Global Partnership against the Spread of Weapons \r\nand Materials of Mass Destruction, the Proliferation \r\nSecurity Initiative, the Global Initiative to Combat \r\nNuclear Terrorism, the Nuclear Security Summits \r\nand the Global Threat Reduction Initiative. The EU \r\nlooks forward to the Agency’s July 2013 lnternational \r\nConference on Nuclear Security: Enhancing Global \r\nEfforts, which is open to all States, and welcomes the \r\nrole that international processes and initiatives can play \r\nin facilitating synergy and cooperation in the area of \r\nnuclear security.\r\nThe EU supports IAEA activities in the areas of \r\nnuclear security in the framework of the implementation \r\nof the EU’s strategy against the proliferation of weapons \r\nof mass destruction. The EU, together with individual \r\nmember States, is one of the main contributors to \r\nthe Nuclear Security Fund, having provided around \r\n€30 million to date. So far, more than 50 countries have \r\nbenefited from assistance funded through EU joint \r\nactions and Council decisions. That number continues \r\nto grow.\r\nDuring the period 2007-2013, under the EU \r\nInstrument for Stability, nearly €260 million has been \r\ndedicated to chemical, biological, radiological and \r\nnuclear (CBRN) risk mitigation worldwide. Of that \r\namount, more than €100 million has been allocated \r\nto the EU’s regional CBRN centres of excellence \r\ninitiative. The objective of the centres of excellence is \r\nto invest in strengthening the institutional capacity of \r\nstakeholders in partner countries to mitigate chemical, \r\nbiological, radiological or nuclear risks, irrespective of \r\ntheir origin. At the same time, the European Union has \r\nstepped up its outreach and coordination efforts to key \r\npartners and international organizations. On 19 April, \r\nthe Security Council welcomed the establishment of \r\nthe CBRN centres of excellence (see S/PV.6752); a \r\nmajor conference on the centres was held at the United \r\nNations in New York on 22 June; and EU services are \r\nabout to finalize a broad understanding on coordination \r\nwith the IAEA’s Office of Nuclear Security that will \r\ninclude regular work on a strategic and technical level \r\non the radiological and nuclear aspects of the CBRN \r\ncentres of excellence initiative.\r\nEffective physical protection is of the utmost \r\nimportance in order to prevent nuclear material falling \r\ninto the hands of terrorists or being accidentally \r\nmisused, as well as to protect nuclear facilities against \r\nunauthorized use and malicious acts. The EU therefore \r\nurges all States that have not yet done so to become \r\nparty to the Convention on the Physical Protection of \r\nNuclear Material and its 2005 amendment.\r\nFinally, the European Union uses several of its \r\nfinancial instruments to support both the IAEA and \r\n4 12-57291\r\nA/67/PV.30\r\ncooperation with third countries in the peaceful uses \r\nof nuclear energy and technology, amounting to a total \r\nof some €150 million per year. Where the peaceful \r\nuses of nuclear energy are concerned, the Agency \r\nplays an important role in the areas of human health, \r\nfood and agriculture, water resources, the environment \r\nand nuclear energy, as well as in nuclear and radiation \r\nsafety, in participating Member States. Part of the \r\nEU’s funding through its financial instruments is \r\nimplemented in third countries through the IAEA’s \r\nTechnical Cooperation Fund, to which the EU and its \r\nmember States are among the largest contributors. We \r\nalso make substantial contributions to the Agency’s \r\nPeaceful Uses Initiative. On 4 May, on the margins \r\nof the meetings of the Preparatory Committee for \r\nthe 2015 Review of the Parties to the Treaty on \r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the EU \r\norganized a side event on the topic of peaceful uses, \r\nwith the participation of the Agency.\r\nMr. Ferguson (Australia): Australia commends \r\nDirector General Amano for his report (A/67/152) on \r\nthe achievements of the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency (IAEA) and on the challenges it will face over \r\nthe coming years.\r\nAs a member of the IAEA Board of Governors, \r\nAustralia takes very seriously the responsibilities that \r\nentails. We attach great importance to the central role \r\nplayed by the IAEA in improving the safety and security \r\nof nuclear activities, enlarging the humanitarian \r\ncontribution made by nuclear technology and verifying \r\nStates’ non-proliferation commitments.\r\nIn the post-Fukushima accident era, Director \r\nGeneral Amano’s ongoing actions and initiatives have \r\nimproved international nuclear safety, particularly \r\nthrough the implementation of the IAEA Action Plan \r\non Nuclear Safety. The Action Plan is a strong and \r\npractical demonstration of the priority the international \r\ncommunity attaches to achieving the highest possible \r\nstandards in nuclear safety. We encourage States to be \r\nproactive in undertaking the actions outlined in the \r\nPlan, and any additional actions that are relevant to \r\ntheir own circumstances.\r\nAustralia welcomes the positive outcomes of \r\nthe second Extraordinary Meeting of Parties to the \r\nConvention on Nuclear Safety, held in August, especially \r\nthe upgrading of the rules and guidelines that will \r\nstrengthen nuclear safety through more comprehensive \r\nnational reporting and robust peer-review processes.\r\nWhile important, safety measures are not the only \r\nelements required to properly protect people and the \r\nenvironment. The IAEA’s nuclear security programme \r\nand its role in international nuclear security initiatives \r\nand activities are equally important. The IAEA \r\nsafeguards system is one of the central pillars of the \r\nnuclear non-proliferation regime. To be completely \r\neffective, the IAEA’s safeguards system must have \r\nuniversal coverage. The universalization of the Treaty \r\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) \r\nis indispensable to the system. We continue to call on \r\nthose States that have not signed and ratified the Treaty \r\nto do so as soon as possible, and to place their nuclear \r\nfacilities under IAEA safeguards. We continue to call \r\non all those States party to the NPT that have yet to \r\nfulfil their relevant obligations under the Treaty to \r\nconclude comprehensive safeguards agreements and to \r\nadhere to the Additional Protocols  without delay.\r\nStates must comply with their safeguards obligations. \r\nIAEA safeguards obligations are not voluntary. It is \r\ntherefore a matter of deep concern that certain States \r\ncontinue to be in breach of their obligations. We call on \r\nthose countries to engage with the Agency to resolve \r\nall issues, demonstrate conclusively the peaceful intent \r\nof their nuclear activities, and comply fully with all of \r\ntheir international obligations, including addressing \r\nthe concerns of the international community. Australia \r\ncommends the Agency for its continuing efforts to \r\nresolve those issues.\r\nAustralia continues to support the Agency in \r\ndeveloping safeguards techniques and approaches. \r\nRecently, the University of Western Australia became \r\nthe newest member of the Agency’s network of \r\nanalytical laboratories. In that role, it will analyse \r\nenvironmental samples with the ability to detect illicit \r\nnuclear activities.\r\nAustralia is committed to working closely with the \r\nAgency and our neighbours in the Asia Pacific region \r\non peaceful applications of nuclear energy. Australia \r\nshares its skilled scientific research base, equipment \r\nand personnel with regional neighbours and other \r\nMember States, and we provide strong support to the \r\nAgency’s technical cooperation programme.\r\nThe Agency plays a vital role in enhancing States’ \r\ncapacities to prevent, diagnose and treat health problems \r\nthrough the use of nuclear techniques. We should never \r\nlose sight of such humanitarian benefits, to which the \r\nIAEA is uniquely able to provide worldwide support.\r\n12-57291 5\r\nA/67/PV.30\r\nAustralia has recently announced an expansion \r\nof its nuclear medicine production capability, which \r\nin coming years will be able to supply a large part \r\nof global need for medical radioisotopes. It is crucial \r\nthat we advance both health outcomes from nuclear \r\nmedicine and global nuclear non-proliferation efforts \r\nby minimizing the civilian use of highly enriched \r\nuranium. Our new facility is based solely on the use \r\nof low-enriched uranium. Australia is also further \r\ndeveloping its specialized nuclear waste management \r\ntechnology, Synroc, to encapsulate and store safely the \r\nwaste from its expanded nuclear medicine production.\r\nFinally, the external environment in which the \r\nAgency operates is highly f luid, and we must ensure \r\nthat the Agency has the capability to respond quickly \r\nand effectively to external developments, be they \r\nrelated to nuclear safety, physical protection, nuclear \r\nproliferation or sustainable development. Australia will \r\ncontinue to provide the technical, financial and political \r\nsupport to ensure that the Agency can help States meet \r\nthe challenges of today and tomorrow.\r\nAustralia is pleased to sponsor draft resolution \r\nA/67/L.3 on the report of the IAEA. \r\nMs. Tandon (India): My delegation thanks the \r\nDirector General of the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency (IAEA) for preparing the annual report for the \r\nyear 2011, as transmitted in the note by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral (A/67/152).\r\nThe increasing global demand for energy, as well as \r\nconcerns about climate change, volatile fossil fuel prices \r\nand the security of energy supplies, remain essential \r\nfactors in deciding an energy mix for any country. \r\nThis is aptly reflected by the observation in the report \r\nthat, despite the nuclear accident in Japan in March \r\n2011, nuclear power remains an important option not \r\nonly for countries with existing nuclear programmes, \r\nbut also for developing countries with growing energy \r\nrequirements. We note that the IAEA’s post-accident \r\nprojections of global nuclear power capacity in 2030 \r\nare slightly lower than previously projected, as some \r\ncountries have deferred their decisions to introduce \r\nnuclear programmes.\r\nThe Fukushima accident elicited a global response \r\nto the issue of enhancing nuclear safety, with Member \r\nStates reassessing the safety of existing nuclear power \r\nplants. While the results of these reassessments will \r\nbe further refined as necessary in the light of new \r\ninformation that might emerge in the future, it is a \r\nmatter of satisfaction that the data collected by the \r\nIAEA and the World Association of Nuclear Operators \r\nshows that in 2011 the level of nuclear safety among the \r\n435 operating nuclear power plants in operation around \r\nthe world remained high. \r\nHowever, as Fukushima has demonstrated, there \r\nis no room for complacency. The IAEA should also \r\ntake all necessary measures to allay misapprehension \r\namong the public and member States about the safety \r\nof nuclear power plants, taking into account the current \r\nadvances in relevant design and technology areas. \r\nTherefore, we would like to call on all stakeholders \r\nto work collectively to continue to enhance nuclear \r\nsafety. In this context, we would like to encourage the \r\nIAEA to make concerted efforts to enable the free f low \r\nof the latest information, technology and equipment \r\npertaining to nuclear safety among member States.\r\nNuclear energy has a crucial role to play in \r\nachieving the objectives of India’s sustainable economic \r\ngrowth. At the same time, India is extensively engaged \r\nin the development of nuclear technologies in diverse \r\nfields extending beyond nuclear power. These include \r\napplications for improved crop varieties, crop protection \r\nand radiation-based post-harvest technologies, \r\nradiodiagnosis and radiotherapy for diseases, and \r\ntechnologies for safe drinking water, among others.\r\nThe nuclear power programme in India is oriented \r\ntowards maximizing the energy potential of available \r\nuranium resources and the utilization of its large \r\nthorium reserves. We believe that available global \r\nuranium resources cannot sustain the projected \r\nexpansion of nuclear power without adopting a closed \r\nfuel cycle approach and subsequently adopting a \r\nthorium fuel cycle. \r\nIn this context, we would like to mention the \r\nIAEA technical meeting held in India in October \r\n2011, where over 50 experts from 20 member States \r\ndeliberated on diverse subjects related to thorium. The \r\nparticipants noted thorium’s promise in extending the \r\nglobal deployment of nuclear power, and concluded \r\nthat the technology is sufficiently mature for an initial \r\ncommercial deployment. We encourage the IAEA \r\nto further engage in the thorium fuel cycle. With its \r\nexcellent physical and nuclear properties, thorium is \r\nwidely and rightly viewed as the fuel of the future.\r\nCurrently, India has 20 operating reactors \r\nwith an installed capacity of 4,780 megawatts, and \r\nseven reactors under construction with an installed \r\n6 12-57291\r\nA/67/PV.30\r\ncapacity of 5,300 megawatts. The first unit of the \r\n1,000-megawatt electrical pressurized heavy-water \r\nreactor at Kudankulam is due to attain first criticality \r\nvery shortly. The second unit is to follow soon after. \r\nWork is proceeding on four nuclear power plants \r\nof indigenous design of 700-megawatt electrical \r\npressurized heavy-water reactor type, two each at \r\nRawatbhata, in Rajasthan, and Kakrapar, in Gujarat. \r\nThe prototype fast breeder reactor of 500 megawatts \r\nis also in an advanced stage of construction. A number \r\nof other reactor projects are under negotiation with \r\nprospective foreign vendors for the setting up of nuclear \r\npower plants at different sites.\r\nWe were happy to welcome three new members \r\ninto the fold of the International Project on Innovative \r\nNuclear Reactors and Fuel Cycles (INPRO) in 2011. India \r\nhas been associated with INPRO since its inception, \r\nand has contributed to its progress. We believe that \r\nthis programme has great potential for making nuclear \r\nenergy accessible in a safe and sustainable manner, \r\nparticularly to new entrants embarking on this path. \r\nThe IAEA, through INPRO, should continue to play a \r\ncentral role in developing innovative technology for the \r\nsafe utilization of nuclear power.\r\nMy delegation fully supports other activities of the \r\nIAEA undertaken to stimulate innovation in nuclear \r\npower through technical working groups for different \r\nreactor technologies, small  and medium-sized reactors, \r\nand non-electrical applications. The coordinated \r\nresearch projects organized by the IAEA provide an \r\nexcellent forum for understanding and developing \r\ntechnology.\r\nIndia attaches great importance to the IAEA’s \r\nwork in the field of nuclear science. We contribute to \r\nthese activities through participation in the technical \r\nmeetings and coordinated research projects and support \r\nthe IAEA’s programme in nuclear fusion.\r\nMy delegation believes that the IAEA’s programmes \r\nand achievements in nuclear applications in food \r\nand agriculture, human health and nutrition, water \r\nresources management, protection of the environment \r\nand industry go a long way towards meeting the needs \r\nof developing countries. We will continue to provide \r\nour support to these IAEA programmes, including \r\nby offering experts’ services and seats in reputed \r\ninstitutions for training fellows from member States.\r\nWith these comments, we take note of the IAEA’s \r\nannual report for 2011. India supports the work of the \r\nIAEA and has sponsored draft resolution A/67/L.3 on \r\nthe report of the International Atomic Energy Agency.\r\nMr. Lazarev (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): On behalf \r\nof the delegation of the Republic of Belarus, allow me to \r\nexpress our appreciation for the report of the Director \r\nGeneral of the International Atomic Energy Agency \r\n(IAEA), Mr. Yukiya Amano, on the activities of the \r\nAgency over the past year (see A/67/152). The Belarusian \r\ndelegation reiterates its support for the Agency as the \r\nleading international organization contributing to the \r\nsafe, reliable and peaceful use of nuclear energy for the \r\npurposes of sustainable development.\r\nThe past year has been difficult for the entire \r\ninternational nuclear community, in particular the \r\nIAEA, in the light of the accident at the Fukushima \r\nnuclear power plant in Japan. A quarter of a century \r\nafter the Chernobyl disaster, the world was again \r\nconfronted by a nuclear accident. That has forced us \r\nto reassess the issue of nuclear safety and of how to \r\nensure it. \r\nWe note the great amount of work undertaken by \r\nthe Agency’s secretariat, in cooperation with member \r\nStates, to adapt current approaches to ensuring a global \r\nnuclear safety regime. Belarus has taken an active part \r\nin that process and intends to make its own contribution \r\ntowards implementing the IAEA Action Plan on Nuclear \r\nSafety, endorsed at the fifty-fifth regular session of the \r\nGeneral Conference in September 2011. \r\nBelarus attaches the utmost importance to ensuring \r\nnuclear and radiation safety in the implementation of its \r\nnational nuclear power programme. The safety of such \r\nfuture programmes is a State priority and our country \r\nundertakes all the necessary phases of developing \r\nnuclear energy in close cooperation with the Agency \r\nand in strict compliance with its norms and standards. \r\nThat was reaffirmed by the successful hosting of the \r\nIntegrated Nuclear Infrastructure Review mission \r\nin Belarus in June. The efforts of Belarus were \r\nhighly commended during visits to that country by \r\nthe Agency’s Director General, Yukiya Amano, in \r\nApril and by its Deputy Director General, Alexander \r\nBychkov, in October. \r\nWe note the fruitful cooperation with the Agency’s \r\nSecretariat on strengthening nuclear security. With \r\nIAEA assistance, Belarus is implementing a relevant \r\nand coordinated plan of action. We believe such \r\nactivities to be a significant contribution of Belarus \r\n12-57291 7\r\nA/67/PV.30\r\ntowards bolstering nuclear security not only nationally \r\nbut also regionally.\r\nBelarus is firmly convinced of the importance \r\nof the IAEA’s coordinating role in the global efforts \r\nto strengthen nuclear security and to prevent nuclear \r\nterrorism. Only the agreed and joint actions of the \r\ninternational community in that area can produce \r\ntangible results. In that regard, we attach great \r\nsignificance to the implementation of and broader \r\nparticipation by States in the international legal \r\ninstruments adopted under the auspices of the Agency, \r\nincluding the Convention on the Physical Protection of \r\nNuclear Material. \r\nBelarus actively participates in the Agency’s \r\nTechnical Cooperation Programme, through which \r\nprovision is made for considerable assistance in \r\napplying nuclear knowledge and technology. The main \r\nnational priorities are the development of the nuclear \r\npower infrastructure, environmental protection, the \r\nrehabilitation of territories that suffered as a result \r\nof the Chernobyl disaster and health issues. We \r\nbelieve that maintaining and bolstering the Technical \r\nCooperation Programme, as well as ensuring its robust \r\nfinancial support, must remain a priority among the \r\nIAEA activities. As a firm and steadfast champion of \r\nnuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, Belarus \r\nstrictly complies with its obligations under the Treaty \r\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and its \r\nsafeguards agreement. We deem it very important to \r\nstrengthen the IAEA safeguards system, including the \r\nadditional protocol, as the standard for verification \r\nactivity.\r\nIn conclusion, we would like to reiterate our support \r\nfor the Agency’s work. We note that Belarus is a sponsor \r\nof draft resolution A/67/L.3, which has been submitted \r\nfor the consideration of the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Wang Min (China) (spoke in Chinese): The \r\nChinese delegation welcomes the report of Mr. Yukiya \r\nAmano, Director General of the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency, on the work of the Agency \r\n(see A/67/152).\r\nOver the past year, the IAEA has conscientiously \r\nperformed its duties in accordance with its statutory \r\nmandate by maintaining a balanced development of \r\nits two major mandates of promoting the peaceful use \r\nof nuclear energy and of preventing the proliferation \r\nof nuclear weapons, and has achieved fruitful results \r\nin various areas of its work. In the field of nuclear \r\nsafety in particular, the Agency has taken a series of \r\nmeasures to ensure the comprehensive and effective \r\nimplementation of the Action Plan on Nuclear Safety \r\nsince its adoption at the fifty-fifth regular session of \r\nthe General Conference of the IAEA. China believes \r\nthat such efforts by the Agency are of great importance \r\nto restoring public confidence in nuclear energy, to \r\nimproving international nuclear safety and emergency \r\nresponse and to ensuring the safe and sustainable \r\ndevelopment of global nuclear energy.\r\nAt the same time, through its Technical \r\nCooperation Programme, the Agency has promoted \r\nthe application of nuclear technology in a broad range \r\nof areas, such as public health, medical services, \r\nagriculture and environmental protection. On the basis \r\nof the Programme, the Agency has provided important \r\nguidance to developing countries on developing nuclear \r\nenergy. It has also supported and assisted member \r\nStates in strengthening their nuclear security and \r\nsafety capabilities by establishing the Nuclear Security \r\nGuidance Committee and by drawing up guiding \r\ndocuments, such as the Nuclear Security Fundamentals. \r\nThe Agency continuously strives to promote the \r\nuniversality of the comprehensive safeguards agreement \r\nand its additional protocol, and has resolutely carried \r\nout its safeguards functions. The Chinese delegation \r\nis glad to see that the Agency’s work has been widely \r\nrecognized and supported by member States.\r\nThe Fukushima nuclear accident triggered deep \r\nreflection within the international community on the \r\nuse of nuclear energy, and countries increasingly have \r\na sound understanding of nuclear power development. \r\nOn the one hand, nuclear power, as a clean and efficient \r\nform of energy, still plays an irreplaceable role in \r\nsafeguarding energy security, in promoting economic \r\ndevelopment and in combating climate change. The \r\nglobal trend for nuclear power development has \r\nessentially remained the same. On the other hand, \r\nsafety is a priority for and fundamental to developing \r\nnuclear energy. \r\nChina always adheres to the principle of safety \r\nfirst in developing nuclear energy. We have established \r\na comprehensive system of legal standards and a \r\nregulatory framework for nuclear safety, and will \r\ncontinue to improve such structures. We have enhanced \r\nthe management of our nuclear safety and emergency \r\nresponse, stepped up efforts in staff training and \r\ntechnology research and development and have a good \r\ntrack record in nuclear safety. China has endorsed \r\n8 12-57291\r\nA/67/PV.30\r\npriority areas as health, food security, environmental \r\nprotection and the management of water resources is \r\nan important contribution to improving life on our \r\nplanet. Cuba attaches particular importance to the \r\ntechnical cooperation activity of the Agency because \r\nit is an essential way to promote nuclear technology in \r\ndeveloping countries. Among other aspects, that can be \r\nseen in the strict fulfilment of our obligations to the \r\nIAEA Technical Cooperation Programme. In 2011, \r\nCuba fulfilled on time its financial commitments to the \r\nTechnical Cooperation Fund and paid 100 per cent of \r\nits expenses for its national participation, achieving a \r\n92 per cent implementation rate for national projects, \r\nwhich is a figure higher than average. \r\nIn the case of Cuba, IAEA technical cooperation \r\nprojects fit harmoniously with our development \r\nprogrammes, which guarantees their impact and \r\ncontinuity. Cuba continues to increase its contributions \r\nto the IAEA Technical Cooperation Programme through \r\nvarious actions, among which I note the contribution of \r\n44 experts who have participated in 70 missions, and \r\nthe organization of 20 courses and/or regional training \r\nworkshops. \r\nCuba also considers it vitally important to continue \r\ncooperation between developing countries. That is why \r\nwe reiterate our support of the Regional Cooperative \r\nArrangements for the Promotion of Nuclear Science and \r\nTechnology in Latin America, an essential mechanism \r\nfor promoting nuclear cooperation among the countries \r\nof Latin America and the Caribbean. We welcome \r\nthe measures that have been taken to strengthen that \r\nprogramme, both by participating countries and by \r\nthe IAEA itself. Cuba is playing an active role in that \r\nprocess.\r\nThe economic trade and financial embargo applied \r\nby the United States of America to Cuba for more \r\nthan 50 years affects the activities of the IAEA in our \r\ncountry and violates the statutes of that body. Because \r\nof the blockade, the IAEA has had problems purchasing \r\nspecialized equipment for projects in Cuba, since North \r\nAmerican companies or those that provide training to \r\nCubans are not allowed to sell their equipment for use \r\nin Cuba because of the sanctions. Furthermore, it is \r\ndifficult for Cuban nationals to participate in training \r\ncourses organized in the United States, which also \r\naffects the implementation of projects linked to the \r\nfight against cancer, which is an IAEA priority. Once \r\nagain, I denounce the unjust and criminal blockade. \r\nCuba recognizes, however, the ongoing efforts of the \r\nand actively participated in relevant international and \r\nregional exchanges and cooperation in order to further \r\nimprove nuclear safety. To that end, it has also worked \r\ntirelessly to develop and to implement advanced nuclear \r\nenergy technology.\r\nChina also attaches great importance to nuclear \r\nsecurity capacity-building and supports and actively \r\nparticipates in relevant international cooperation. In \r\nMarch 2012, President Hu Jintao attended the Nuclear \r\nSecurity Summit in Seoul, where he expounded on \r\nChina’s policy and measures on nuclear security issues \r\nin a comprehensive manner. China played a constructive \r\nrole in ensuring the success of the Summit and \r\nmade a great contribution to promoting international \r\ncooperation on nuclear security. \r\nAt present, the construction of the centre of \r\nexcellence on nuclear security in China, in cooperation \r\nwith relevant countries, is proceeding in an orderly \r\nfashion. China will strive to make it a regional centre \r\nof excellence, and cooperate and interconnect with \r\nother centres to raise the level of nuclear security in \r\nthe region. In addition, China supports the leading \r\nrole of the International Atomic Energy Agency in \r\nthe field of nuclear security, and will continue to offer \r\ncontributions to the Nuclear Security Fund.\r\nThe Agency is the most authoritative and \r\nrepresentative international organization in the nuclear \r\nfield. Member States have high expectations for it. \r\nIt is China’s hope that, facing the new situation, the \r\nAgency will give priority, first, to further promoting \r\nthe implementation of the Action Plan on Nuclear \r\nSafety and international exchanges and cooperation on \r\nnuclear safety, and to helping member States enhance \r\nnuclear safety and emergency response capabilities; \r\nsecondly, to further improving the standards and \r\nguidelines in nuclear security and assisting Member \r\nStates in upgrading their national nuclear security \r\nsystem with a view to playing a more important role in \r\nenhancing nuclear security at the global level; thirdly, \r\nto strengthening the safeguards regime and effectively \r\npreventing nuclear proliferation; and, fourthly, to \r\nmaintaining an objective and impartial stand on \r\nsensitive and controversial nuclear issues, and playing \r\na constructive role in peacefully resolving those issues \r\nthrough dialogue and cooperation.\r\nMr. León González (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nCuba welcomes and supports the important role of \r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). \r\nThe application of nuclear technologies in such \r\n12-57291 9\r\nA/67/PV.30\r\ninterests of member States. We call on the IAEA \r\nsecretariat to continue to work to provide a climate of \r\nimpartiality, trust, understanding and transparency, \r\nbased on objectivity and truth, which will help resolve \r\nthe specific issues of compliance with safeguards \r\nagreements being considered by the Board of Governors \r\nand/or the General Conference of the IAEA. In that \r\nregard, we reaffirm the need to respect the inalienable \r\nright of all States to use nuclear energy for peaceful \r\npurposes. \r\nWe once again affirm our support for the \r\ndenuclearization of the Korean peninsula and for a \r\nnegotiated solution to the issue on the part of all those \r\ninvolved. We are firmly convinced that only through \r\ndiplomacy and dialogue through peaceful means will \r\nit be possible to achieve a long-term solution to the \r\nnuclear issue on the peninsula.\r\nWe would also reiterate our support for the \r\nestablishment of a zone free of nuclear weapons in the \r\nMiddle East. That would be an important contribution to \r\nachieving the goal of nuclear disarmament and a major \r\nstep forward in the peace process in the region. In order \r\nto bring that about, Israel should join the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons without further \r\ndelay or conditions and submit its nuclear installations \r\nto the broad safeguards of the IAEA. Cuba hopes that \r\nthe conference on the establishment of a zone free of \r\nnuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction \r\nin the Middle East will be held with success in 2012 \r\nwith the participation of all States of the region.\r\nWhile we support the important role played by the \r\nIAEA and its links with the United Nations system, in \r\nparticular with the disarmament machinery, we would \r\ntake this opportunity to reiterate that our joint efforts \r\nmust be to continue to defend nuclear disarmament \r\nas the highest priority owing to the serious threat to \r\ninternational peace and security and the survival of the \r\nhuman race posed by the existence of more than 20,000 \r\nnuclear warheads and military doctrines and strategies \r\nthat perpetuate their possession and use. \r\nFinally, we wish to emphasize that nuclear \r\ndisarmament cannot be a goal that is postponed or \r\nsubject to conditions. Cuba will stand firm in the battle \r\nfor a better world free of nuclear weapons. \r\nMr. Kodama (Japan): One and a half years after the \r\nGreat East Japan Earthquake and its resulting tsunamis \r\nand the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear \r\nPower Station of the Tokyo Electric Power Company, \r\nIAEA secretariat to find alternatives or solutions to \r\nthat problem.\r\nMy country appreciates the work of the \r\nOrganization in the area of nuclear safety, and \r\nstresses the fundamental responsibility of States in \r\nthat area. In March, Cuba and the IAEA signed an \r\nintegrated support plan for physical nuclear safety, the \r\nimplementation of which is advancing satisfactorily. \r\nWe welcome the excellent level of cooperation that has \r\nbeen achieved with the IAEA Department of Nuclear \r\nSafety and Security in the implementation of projects \r\nto improve physical nuclear safety in border control and \r\ninstallations with Category 1 and 2 radioactive sources. \r\nCuba has also hosted regional training events, an area \r\nof IAEA support that we consider to be fundamental.\r\nMy country also welcomes the preparations being \r\ncarried out by the International Atomic Energy Agency \r\nto host the important international conference on \r\nnuclear security that will take place in Vienna from 1 to \r\n5 July 2013, with the participation of all member States. \r\nIn that context, I would like to inform the Assembly \r\nthat Cuba is at an advanced stage of the constitutional \r\nprocess of ratifying the Amendment to the Convention \r\non the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material. We \r\nreaffirm the need to strengthen the nuclear security \r\nregime at the international level, and stress that this \r\nis the primary responsibility of States with nuclear \r\ninstallations. Moreover, we recognize the IAEA’s \r\ncentral role in promoting and coordinating international \r\nefforts and cooperation to strengthen nuclear security \r\nat the global level. \r\nCuba is part of the small group of countries that \r\nhave met their commitments in the area of safeguards, \r\nas certified by the IAEA, which confirms that we are a \r\ncountry that does not have undeclared nuclear material \r\nor engage in undeclared nuclear activities. We attach \r\ngreat importance to the sensitive issue of safeguards and \r\nto the impartial and professional conduct of the IAEA \r\nsecretariat in the activities undertaken in that area. \r\nWe have repeatedly criticized the manipulation and \r\npoliticization of the Agency for political purposes, as \r\nwell as the double standards that unfortunately prevail \r\nin its analyses. Activities in that area are the exclusive \r\ncompetence of the IAEA, and we therefore reiterate \r\nour rejection of the decisions that have involved the \r\nSecurity Council in their consideration. \r\nCuba reaffirms that verification activities must \r\nfirst and foremost respect the sovereignty and national \r\n10 12-57291\r\nA/67/PV.30\r\nJapan is continuing its efforts, including those directed \r\ntowards decontaminating and restoring the stricken \r\nareas. We once again express our gratitude for the great \r\nsupport and assistance that we have received from the \r\ninternational community to date.\r\nI take the opportunity afforded by today’s debate \r\nto talk about some of the major steps we have taken \r\nto contribute to progress in the Nuclear Safety Action \r\nPlan of the International Atomic Energy Agency \r\n(IAEA) over the past year. That issue is of particular \r\nimportance to Japan, as my country is organizing the \r\nFukushima Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Safety \r\nnext December, in co-sponsorship with the IAEA. We \r\nfind it important to urge the international community to \r\nimplement the Action Plan and to share lessons learned \r\nand knowledge derived from the accident.\r\nFirst of all, in order to strengthen international \r\nnuclear safety, we have fully imparted information and \r\nknowledge about the accident with the international \r\ncommunity. Japan has already presented two detailed \r\nreports to the IAEA on the course of events.\r\nSecondly, Japan decided to strengthen its national \r\nnuclear regulatory body. A new regulatory body, the \r\nNuclear Regulation Authority, was established in order \r\nto separate the authority to regulate nuclear energy \r\nfrom that of promoting it, and to ensure that the new \r\nAuthority will enjoy a high degree of independence \r\nso that it can assume responsibility for all important \r\nnuclear regulatory functions — safety and security, \r\nradiation protection and, beginning in April 2013, \r\nsafeguards issues, that is, each of the three “S” \r\nfunctions. Furthermore, Japan welcomes Director \r\nGeneral Amano’s expressed intention to prepare a \r\ncomprehensive report on the Fukushima Daiichi \r\naccident, which will be finalized in 2014. Japan will \r\nactively cooperate with that effort.\r\nIn order to strengthen global nuclear security, \r\nJapan will continue to endeavour to provide assistance \r\nto developing countries through the activities of the \r\nIntegrated Support Centre for Nuclear Non-proliferation \r\nand Nuclear Security, working in concert with other \r\ncountries and the IAEA. Japan appreciates the IAEA’s \r\nefforts aimed at promoting the entry into force of \r\nthe amendment to the Convention on the Physical \r\nProtection of Nuclear Material. Japan, recognizing that \r\nthe amendment will bring important changes to global \r\nnuclear security, will make the necessary efforts to that \r\nend.\r\nThe IAEA is the only international organization \r\nthat has expertise in all aspects of nuclear energy; its \r\nexpertise is not limited to nuclear safety and security. \r\nWe should not lessen our efforts aimed at supporting \r\nthe IAEA as it undertakes all its roles.\r\nJapan attaches importance to the steady \r\nimplementation of the Action Plan agreed at the 2010 \r\nReview Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on \r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, in concert \r\nwith the IAEA and others. In that connection, Japan \r\nwelcomes the ongoing efforts by the United States \r\nand Russia towards the control and disposal of certain \r\nweapons-grade plutonium and the implementation of \r\nthe IAEA verification system. We expect similar efforts \r\nfrom the other nuclear-weapon States.\r\nYears of constant effort by the international \r\ncommunity to improve the effectiveness and efficiency \r\nof the IAEA safeguards have been indispensable. Thanks \r\nto them, the number of States with additional protocols \r\nin force increased from 110 to 119 over the past year, \r\nwhich is progress that Japan welcomes. Accordingly, \r\nJapan will further contribute to efforts for the \r\nuniversalization of the additional protocol. Specifically, \r\nwe will do our utmost through the joint efforts of the \r\nNon-Proliferation and Disarmament Initiative (NPDI), \r\nwhich is a cross-regional group that aims to promote \r\nthe implementation of the consensus outcome of the \r\n2010 Review Conference and to contribute to the steady \r\nreduction of nuclear risks. Japanese Foreign Minister \r\nGemba co-chaired the most recent ministerial level \r\nmeeting of the NPDI, which was held on 26 September \r\nat the margins of the General Assembly. As expressed \r\nin the joint ministerial statement of that meeting, the \r\nNPDI is working on the ministerial letters that will \r\nurge action on the additional protocol.\r\nRegional nuclear issues remain the most pressing \r\nchallenge for the international community. The IAEA, \r\ncarrying out its mission to, inter alia, prevent the \r\ndiversion to military uses of nuclear energy, has been \r\nplaying important roles on those issues in the light of \r\nthe nuclear non-proliferation regime. \r\nThe nuclear issue of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea is a threat to peace and security in \r\nEast Asia and for the entire international community. \r\nIts uranium enrichment programme constitutes a \r\nclear violation of Security Council resolutions and the \r\nSeptember 2005 Joint Statement of the Six-Party Talks. \r\nJapan supports the critical role that the IAEA continues \r\n12-57291 11\r\nA/67/PV.30\r\nother countries, to ensure the world of the highest level \r\nof safety and security in its peaceful uses of nuclear \r\nenergy, and further secure confidence that there is no \r\ncause for concern regarding nuclear proliferation in or \r\nby Japan.\r\nMs. Hussain (Singapore): The delegation of \r\nSingapore would like to thank the Director General \r\nof the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), \r\nMr Yukiya Amano, and his secretariat for the \r\ncomprehensive annual report of the Agency (see A/67/152).\r\nAs the global focal point for nuclear cooperation, the \r\nIAEA makes important contributions to international \r\npeace and security through its promotion of the safe, \r\nsecure and peaceful uses of nuclear science and \r\ntechnology, and nuclear non-proliferation. Its mission \r\nof safety and security, safeguards and verification, and \r\nscience and technology constitutes a comprehensive \r\nregime. Singapore strongly supports the IAEA’s \r\nimportant work and is pleased to co-sponsor draft \r\nresolution  A/67/L.3 on the report of the IAEA.\r\nThe Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident in March \r\n2011 was a wake-up call against complacency with \r\nregard to the safe operation of nuclear power plants \r\nand the effective regulation of the nuclear industry. \r\nIt was a painful reminder that safety can never be \r\ntaken for granted. In the aftermath of the accident, \r\nin September 2011 IAEA member States adopted the \r\nIAEA Action Plan on Nuclear Safety, which is now \r\nbeing implemented.\r\nProgress has been made in many areas, and we \r\ncommend the efforts of the secretariat to oversee \r\nthe implementation of the Action Plan in the 12 key \r\nareas to enhance the global nuclear safety framework. \r\nHowever, much more work remains to be done. The full \r\nand effective implementation of the Action Plan will \r\nrequire the cooperation and commitment of all member \r\nStates, the secretariat and other relevant stakeholders. \r\nIn this regard, we look forward to a meaningful and \r\nconstructive outcome at the upcoming Fukushima \r\nMinisterial Conference on Nuclear Safety, to be held in \r\nDecember 2012. \r\nAt the same time, while the primary responsibility \r\nfor nuclear safety rests with individual States, the far-\r\nreaching and potentially devastating transboundary \r\nimpact of a nuclear accident means that ensuring and \r\nstrengthening the safety standards of nuclear facilities \r\nare of concern to the international community as a \r\nwhole, and in particular the IAEA. Proposals to enhance \r\nto play in resolving the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea nuclear issue.\r\nWith regard to the Iranian nuclear issue, it is \r\nindispensable for Iran to take substantive measures to \r\nassuage the concerns of the international community \r\nand build its confidence. Japan will continue to act in \r\nconcert with the international community for a peaceful \r\nand diplomatic settlement of the issue.\r\nThe IAEA, which is pivotal in the nuclear \r\nnon-proliferation system, has also been working \r\ndecisively for the resolution of regional nuclear issues. \r\nFor instance, last November, the IAEA hosted the \r\nForum on Experience of Possible Relevance to the \r\nCreation of a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in the Middle \r\nEast to contribute to confidence-building efforts by the \r\nStates concerned.\r\nThe IAEA’s promotion of the peaceful uses of \r\nnuclear energy in a manner that ensures nuclear safety, \r\nsecurity and safeguards is sure to benefit all the States \r\nMembers of the United Nations. Japan attaches great \r\nimportance to IAEA technical cooperation and, as part \r\nof our action in that regard, will make a contribution \r\nto the IAEA in the amount of $3.5 million in this \r\nfiscal year, in addition to the contribution made in the \r\n2011 fiscal year, in order to ensure the success of the \r\nIAEA’s Peaceful Uses Initiative. In addition, Japan will \r\ncontinue to contribute to the promotion of technical \r\ncooperation in areas such as radiological science.\r\nIn the light of the accident at Tokyo Electric Power \r\nCompany’s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station \r\non 11 March 2011, the Japanese Government, with a \r\nview to realizing a society not dependent on nuclear \r\npower by the 2030s, and while constantly reviewing \r\nand re-examining policies and carefully assessing the \r\nfuture outlook, including the international situation \r\nregarding energy, will mobilize all possible policy \r\nresources to demonstrate to the world a model that \r\nstrikes a good balance between economic growth and \r\nthe shift towards green energy.\r\nAs a responsible country where this nuclear \r\naccident took place, we are taking the lessons from this \r\naccident fully into account with a view to enhancing \r\nsafety in the peaceful use of nuclear energy worldwide, \r\nJapan will continue to cooperate with the international \r\ncommunity. Japan is resolved to overcome the \r\nchallenges posed by this historic accident by benefiting \r\nwidely from the wisdom of the world. Japan will \r\nendeavour, through cooperation with the IAEA and \r\n12 12-57291\r\nA/67/PV.30\r\nauthoritative global source of information on illicit \r\ntrafficking. Singapore is pleased to announce that we \r\njoined the IAEA Illicit Trafficking Database in March.\r\nThe IAEA’s work goes beyond nuclear \r\nnon-proliferation and nuclear energy. The Agency \r\nmakes important contributions to tackling fundamental \r\nglobal problems such as food security, water and energy \r\nshortages, and climate change, as well as in the area of \r\nhuman health. Member States must continue to support \r\nthe IAEA’s role in promoting the peaceful application \r\nof nuclear science and technology, such as for use in \r\ncancer treatment in developing countries.\r\nSingapore recently completed its term as a member \r\nof the IAEA Board of Governors. We would like to \r\nreiterate our continued support for the Agency’s vital \r\nrole and tasks. Over the past decade, Singapore has \r\nhosted 23 scientific visits, 92 fellowship attachments \r\nand 25 regional training events with the IAEA. More \r\nrecently, in June this year we hosted the Asia-Europe \r\nMeeting seminar on nuclear safety, with a specific focus \r\non emergency preparedness and response, which is one \r\nof the key areas of focus in the Action Plan on Nuclear \r\nSafety. As part of our continued cooperation with the \r\nIAEA, Singapore will jointly host a regional workshop \r\non notification, reporting and requesting assistance in \r\nDecember. In addition, we will continue to support the \r\nIAEA in promoting capacity-building, in particular \r\namong developing countries, through various technical \r\nassistance and cooperation projects.\r\nMr. Seger (Switzerland) (spoke in French): Once \r\nagain, the past year has been very important for the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The \r\nchallenges facing the IAEA are no less important. \r\nSwitzerland would like to underline three.\r\nFirst, Switzerland welcomes the fact that, unlike \r\nlast year, the IAEA General Conference in September \r\nadopted its traditional resolution on safeguards without \r\nopposition. However, the debate surrounding the \r\nadoption of the resolution highlighted the concerns \r\nof some member States as to the direction taken \r\nby the secretariat on the conceptual development \r\nof safeguards, namely, the “State-level concept”. \r\nSwitzerland fully supports efforts to enhance the \r\neffectiveness of safeguards. In this regard, we believe \r\nthat increased transparency in the participation not \r\nonly of the secretariat regarding the progress of its \r\nwork, but also of the member States with respect to \r\nthe effectiveness of the Convention on Nuclear Safety \r\nwere also discussed during the Second Extraordinary \r\nMeeting of Contracting Parties to the Convention, held \r\nin Vienna in August. We welcome efforts that would \r\nstrengthen the Convention.\r\nWe also encourage the IAEA to step up its capacity-\r\nbuilding cooperation with regional organizations to \r\npromote and uphold the IAEA standards of safety \r\nand security in the development of nuclear energy \r\nfor peaceful uses. This would help to enhance and \r\nstrengthen nuclear safety in the world. In this regard, \r\nwe are pleased to report that good progress has been \r\nmade on the Network of Nuclear Regulatory Bodies or \r\nRelevant Authorities of the Association of Southeast \r\nAsian Nations (ASEAN), an initiative of Thailand, \r\nto establish a network of nuclear regulatory bodies \r\namong South-East Asian countries, and to enhance \r\nregional cooperation on nuclear safety, security and \r\nsafeguards matters, including emergency preparedness \r\nand response and environmental radiation monitoring. \r\nWe look forward to close collaborations between the \r\nASEAN nuclear regulatory network and the IAEA and \r\ninternational partners.\r\nNuclear non-proliferation remains a core aspect of \r\nthe IAEA’s mission. Singapore firmly believes that all \r\nStates have the right to develop and use nuclear energy \r\nfor peaceful purposes. At the same time, the IAEA \r\nhas the vital task of ensuring that nuclear material \r\nand technology meant for peaceful purposes are not \r\ndiverted for non-civilian uses that could threaten \r\nregional and international peace and stability. The \r\nIAEA’s safeguards and verification regimes remain \r\ncentral to multilateral efforts to curb the proliferation \r\nof nuclear weapons. It is therefore both in the interests \r\nand the responsibility of all States to comply with \r\nthese regimes. In this connection, Singapore strongly \r\nurges all States which have not done so to accede to the \r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \r\nand the IAEA’s comprehensive safeguards agreements \r\nand additional protocols. Those States that have done \r\nso should fully implement these agreements.\r\nThe IAEA plays a central role as the global platform \r\nfor strengthening nuclear security. It focuses on helping \r\nto minimize the risk of nuclear and other radioactive \r\nmaterial falling into the hands of terrorists, or of \r\nnuclear facilities being subjected to malicious acts. \r\nIn this regard, the IAEA Illicit Trafficking Database, \r\nwhich monitors thefts and other unauthorized activities \r\ninvolving nuclear and radioactive materials, is the \r\n12-57291 13\r\nA/67/PV.30\r\ncountry that has or is planning its own nuclear power \r\nprogramme. The existing international treaty basis \r\nconcerning nuclear safety and the reaction to nuclear \r\naccidents requires further improvement. The relevant \r\nwork has already started in Vienna, and we believe that \r\npositive results could be achieved.\r\nAllow me to take this opportunity to reiterate \r\nour gratitude to those countries and international \r\norganizations that continue to provide us with support \r\nand assistance in overcoming the consequences of the \r\nChernobyl accident. I am pleased to report that, in \r\nApril 2012, we reached an important milestone — the \r\nstart of work on assembling the new safe confinement \r\nconstruction over the destroyed unit 4 of the Chernobyl \r\nnuclear power plant. This work, to be completed in \r\n2015, will pave the way for further transformation of \r\nthe shelter object into an ecologically safe system.\r\nNuclear security is an essential programme of the \r\nAgency. Ukraine commends the IAEA for its activities \r\naimed at assisting States in preventing and combating \r\nnuclear terrorism. We would like to emphasize the \r\nimportant role of the Agency in fostering international \r\ncooperation on nuclear security, in establishing a \r\ncomprehensive set of nuclear security guidelines, and in \r\nassisting member States, upon their request, to enhance \r\ntheir nuclear security.\r\nUkraine reaffirms its view that the responsibility \r\nfor nuclear security rests with each individual State. All \r\nStates have the responsibility to establish appropriate \r\nsystems of accounting and control to take the necessary \r\nmeasures to prevent, detect and respond to malicious \r\nacts involving nuclear material. Ukraine supports the \r\nimplementation of the IAEA Nuclear Security Plan \r\nfor 2010-2013. We acknowledge the progress achieved \r\nby the Agency in improving control over radioactive \r\nsources.\r\nProviding a contribution to the success of both \r\nthe Washington, D. C., and Seoul Nuclear Security \r\nSummits, Ukraine announced and implemented in full \r\nits decision to get rid of all national stocks of highly \r\nenriched uranium. The meaning of our voluntary step is \r\ncrystal clear. Ukraine remains a consistent, predictable \r\nand reliable member of the international community \r\nand makes an active contribution to combating nuclear \r\nterrorism, focusing its efforts on strengthening the \r\nphysical protection of nuclear materials. In this regard, \r\nwe would like to recall that, during the sixty-fifth \r\nsession of the General Assembly, the delegations of \r\nUkraine, Mexico and Chile jointly declared themselves \r\ntheir real concerns, could contribute to overcoming \r\nthese difficulties.\r\nSecondly, Switzerland welcomes the decision of the \r\nSecond Extraordinary Meeting of Contracting Parties \r\nto the Convention on Nuclear Safety, held in August \r\nin Vienna, to establish a working group to address the \r\nstrengthening of the Convention.\r\nSwitzerland will actively participate in that \r\nworking group and in the ministerial conference on \r\nnuclear safety to be held in December in Fukushima. \r\nSwitzerland is indeed convinced that a credible global \r\nnuclear safety regime requires the firm commitment \r\nof States to conducting periodical peer reviews and to \r\naddressing safety issues in a fully transparent manner.\r\nFinally, Switzerland welcomes the decision of the \r\nIAEA to organize a conference on nuclear security \r\nin Vienna in July 2013. This decision will allow us \r\nto continue, in a more inclusive way,  the discussions \r\nalready initiated during the three most recent nuclear \r\nsecurity summits. \r\nMr. Tsymbaliuk (Ukraine): The Chernobyl \r\nnuclear power plant accident in 1986 triggered not only \r\nthe revision of international nuclear safety standards, \r\nbut the creation of numerous international instruments \r\nto ensure both the highest level of nuclear, nuclear \r\nwaste and radiation safety worldwide and a relevant \r\nsystem of emergency preparedness and response. \r\nIn 2011, those instruments were put to the test in \r\nresponse to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant \r\naccident. We believe that, given its unique expertise, \r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has \r\na leading role to play in any nuclear-related accident or \r\nemergency, and that its on-site involvement is vital in \r\naddressing situations such as that at Fukushima.\r\nWhile responsibility for nuclear safety rests with \r\neach member State, we believe that the IAEA safety \r\nfundamentals and requirements should constitute a \r\nminimum obligatory basis for States that have advanced \r\ncivil nuclear programmes. \r\nWe believe that activities under both the \r\nConvention on Nuclear Safety and the Joint Convention \r\non the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the \r\nSafety of Radioactive Waste Management enhance the \r\nsafety of nuclear energy uses worldwide. We call upon \r\nall countries that have not yet done so to join these \r\nimportant instruments. We consider that participation \r\nin those conventions is in the best interest of any \r\n14 12-57291\r\nA/67/PV.30\r\nkey to effectiveness is to meet the needs of member \r\nStates. In order to maximize the socioeconomic \r\nimpact of technical cooperation projects, it is crucial \r\nthat the IAEA further develop partnerships with other \r\ninternational organizations where appropriate.\r\nWe recognize the importance of the Agency’s \r\nresearch activities regarding nuclear energy, particularly \r\nin the fields of safety, waste management, radiation \r\nprotection, innovative reactor technologies and fuel \r\ncycles. Ukraine will continue to participate actively \r\nin the International Project on Innovative Nuclear \r\nReactors and Fuel Cycles. Maintaining competence and \r\nknow-how across the nuclear sector is fundamental to \r\nthese activities.\r\nIn conclusion, we would like to join other delegations \r\nin welcoming the IAEA report to the General Assembly \r\nat its sixty-seventh session (see A/67/152), and to \r\nexpress our appreciation for the work of the Agency. \r\nMr. De Vega (Philippines): Cognizant of the \r\ncrucial role played by the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency (IAEA) as the central multilateral forum for \r\nthe promotion of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, \r\nthe Philippines welcomes the report of the IAEA \r\n(see A/67/152) and lends its full support to achieving \r\nthe Agency’s goals and objectives.\r\nThe IAEA and its important role took centre \r\nstage last year amid concerns on nuclear safety in the \r\naftermath of the Fukushima accident. More importantly, \r\nthe nuclear accident provided opportunities for member \r\nStates to consider ways to strengthen the Agency’s \r\nwork in nuclear safety. The Philippines welcomes the \r\nsignificant progress achieved in the implementation of \r\nthe IAEA Action Plan on Nuclear Safety, and lauds the \r\ncombined efforts of the secretariat and member States \r\nin pursuing concrete actions. These include conducting \r\nstress tests of nuclear power plants, carrying out \r\ncapacity-building activities, and enhancing emergency \r\npreparedness response measures.\r\nFor our part, the Philippines is working with the \r\nIAEA secretariat in looking at the possibility of tapping \r\nour former nuclear power plant in Bataan, which we \r\nclosed in 1986, to serve as a regional and international \r\ntraining facility on nuclear power plants.\r\nThe Philippines also welcomes the important work \r\ndone by the Inter-Agency Committee on Radiological \r\nand Nuclear Emergencies this past year. We reaffirm \r\nour commitment to working with the IAEA to facilitate \r\nto be countries that have voluntarily exerted efforts \r\nto minimize the use of highly enriched uranium. We \r\ncall upon other Member States to follow our example \r\nand to take a practical step in support of international \r\nnon-proliferation efforts.\r\nUkraine reaffirms the Agency’s role in verifying \r\nand ensuring compliance by States with their safeguards \r\nobligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \r\nof Nuclear Weapons. Ukraine reiterates the paramount \r\nimportance of IAEA safeguards in providing effective \r\ncontrol over sensitive materials and activities. The \r\nAgency’s system of safeguards is a fundamental \r\ncomponent of the global nuclear non-proliferation \r\nregime. Measures contained in the Model Additional \r\nProtocol are an integral part of this system. The \r\ncomprehensive safeguards agreement, together with \r\nthe Additional Protocol, currently constitute the best \r\nverification standard. \r\nWe would like to say that we strictly fulfil our \r\nobligations under our Safeguards Agreement and the \r\nAdditional Protocol. Since January 2006, Ukraine \r\nhas had a comprehensive Safeguards Agreement and \r\nAdditional Protocol in force. In 2010, Ukraine received \r\npositive broad conclusions from the IAEA regarding \r\nour nuclear activities. We continue to work with the \r\nAgency to establish the necessary conditions for the \r\neffective application of IAEA integrated safeguards in \r\nUkraine.\r\nIn 2011 and 2012, the Agency continued to make \r\nsignificant contributions to global development \r\nobjectives. We commend the Agency for its efforts, \r\nand call upon the IAEA and member States to increase \r\nfurther the contribution of nuclear technology to \r\nhealth and economic development, and to promote the \r\ndissemination of knowledge on the peaceful application \r\nof nuclear technologies among States.\r\nUkraine has always been a strong supporter of \r\nthe IAEA Technical Cooperation Programme, which \r\nconstitutes an important statutory function of the \r\nAgency. Ukraine considers the implementation of \r\nthe Programme to be the cornerstone of international \r\ncooperation on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. We \r\nacknowledge the work done by the IAEA in planning \r\nand implementing technical cooperation activities that \r\nreflect the needs of different countries and regions. \r\nWe believe it is important to ensure fair access to \r\ntechnical cooperation funds and the predictable \r\nfunding of technical cooperation programmes. The \r\n12-57291 15\r\nA/67/PV.30\r\nInsect Pest Control Laboratory of the Joint IAEA/Food \r\nand Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in \r\nSeibersdorf, Austria, on the development of a sterile \r\ninsect technique package for disease-transmitting \r\nmosquitoes. The Philippines is open to working closely \r\nwith the Seibersdorf Laboratory in the future to further \r\nits work.\r\nIn the area of nuclear medicine, the IAEA’s \r\nassistance allowed the Philippines to establish a \r\ntechnetium-99 generator facility, which makes nuclear \r\nprocedures using technetium-99 now affordable \r\nto the public. Through another regional technical \r\ncooperation project, the Philippines looks forward to \r\nthe establishment of a medical cyclotron facility that \r\nwill supply affordable positron emission tomography \r\nradiopharmaceuticals to local hospitals.\r\nOn water resources assessment and management, \r\nthe Philippines undertakes activities to develop \r\nsustainable and socially responsible water resource \r\nmanagement plans under the IAEA Water Availability \r\nEnhancement Project. We encourage the Agency to \r\nremain involved in this area in order to assist member \r\nStates in strengthening their national capacities to \r\nconduct comprehensive water resource assessments.\r\nThe Philippines reaffirms the importance of \r\nstrengthening the Agency’s activities in addressing \r\nthe threats posed by nuclear terrorism and the illicit \r\ntrafficking of nuclear and radioactive material.\r\nUnder the Philippines’ national nuclear security \r\nplan, we commit to securing nuclear and radioactive \r\nmaterials used for peaceful purposes. We also commit \r\nto preventing the illicit trafficking of such materials. \r\nThe Philippines will update this plan in coordination \r\nwith the IAEA.\r\nIn January 2012, the Philippines hosted the \r\nthird review meeting of the Radiological Security \r\nPartnership, which looked at the developments and \r\nchallenges in subscribing to and implementing nuclear \r\nguidance documents in nuclear and radioactive security.\r\nIn partnership with the IAEA, we will host in \r\nFebruary 2013 the International Forum on Effective \r\nBorder Controls: Global Status, which will develop \r\nrecommendations to strengthen border controls \r\nin combating the illicit trafficking of nuclear and \r\nradioactive materials.\r\nWith the continuing proliferation of nuclear \r\nweapons, we underscore the need to strengthen the \r\nimprovements in nuclear and radiological incident and \r\nemergency preparedness and response systems.\r\nFollowing the Fukushima accident, the Philippines \r\nconducted environmental radioactivity monitoring in \r\nnine provinces and shared the data collected with the \r\nUnited Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects \r\nof Atomic Radiation. The Philippines continues \r\nthese monitoring activities through the regional \r\ntechnical cooperation project on the assessment of the \r\nenvironmental impact of the Fukushima accident in the \r\nAsia-Pacific region.\r\nThe Philippines also welcomes the regional \r\ninitiative within the Association of Southeast Asian \r\nNations (ASEAN) to establish the ASEAN Network \r\nof Regulatory Bodies on Atomic Energy, which will \r\nserve as a forum for the exchange of information on \r\nbest practices among the nuclear regulatory bodies of \r\nASEAN member States. The Network is also expected \r\nto enhance cooperation and develop national capacities \r\nin nuclear safety, security and safeguards.\r\nDespite the Fukushima accident, countries keen to \r\nuse nuclear power as a safe and clean source of energy \r\nhave turned to the IAEA for technical assistance in \r\nthe development or expansion of their national nuclear \r\npower programmes. In August, the Agency provided \r\ntechnical assistance to the Philippines in organizing \r\na national workshop on the evaluation of alternative \r\nenergy strategies and establishing a national position \r\non nuclear power. This workshop and future related \r\nactivities will aid the Philippine Government in crafting \r\nits position on nuclear power.\r\nThe Philippines believes that the IAEA continues \r\nto play an important role in helping countries achieve \r\ntheir Millennium Development Goals through its \r\nTechnical Cooperation Programme and its various \r\nactivities in nuclear applications. The Philippines \r\nespecially welcomes the Director General’s focus this \r\nyear on nuclear applications related to food, which is of \r\nparticular importance to my country, with its growing \r\npopulation. In June, the Philippines hosted the IAEA \r\nregional meeting on supporting climate-proof rice \r\nproduction systems on the basis of nuclear applications. \r\nThis project not only addresses the impact of climate \r\nchange on rice production, but provides an opportunity \r\nfor scientific exchanges as well.\r\nIn the field of health, the Philippines continues \r\nto address the health problems caused by dengue and \r\nmalaria. In that regard, we commend the work of the \r\n16 12-57291\r\nA/67/PV.30\r\nAgency’s nuclear verification capabilities and establish \r\nconfidence in the peaceful nature of nuclear activities.\r\nFinally, the Philippines shares the vision of a \r\nworld free of nuclear weapons and strongly supports \r\nthe establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones as a \r\nway to contribute to international peace and security. \r\nWe remain hopeful of the convening of the 2012 \r\nconference on the Middle East, as laid out in the Final \r\nDocument of the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties \r\nto the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \r\nWeapons (NPT/CONF.2010/50 (Vol.I)) before the end \r\nof the year.\r\nMr. Diallo (Senegal) (spoke in French): I am very \r\nhappy to see you, Vice-President Gaspar Martins, \r\npresiding over this plenary meeting of the General \r\nAssembly. I take this opportunity to wish you every \r\nsuccess in your high-level work in the Assembly’s \r\nBureau. I would also like to express my delegation’s \r\nthanks to the Secretariat for the excellent analysis \r\nprovided in the annual report of the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for 2011 (see A/67/152). \r\nThe issue of nuclear safety is once again at the \r\nheart of our concerns. Indeed, although nuclear energy \r\nis indispensable to finding new solutions for our needs \r\nthrough its applications in health, agriculture, the \r\nproduction of electricity and many other areas, its use \r\npresents real security and safety risks. That is why \r\nthe IAEA verification programme remains crucial to \r\nthe efforts of the international community to bring \r\nabout a world free of nuclear weapons, as it limits the \r\nproliferation of such weapons. \r\nThe Agency should therefore continue, in \r\ncooperation with concerned States, to play its role in \r\nfollowing up on the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \r\nof Nuclear Weapons and other treaties, such as those \r\nestablishing nuclear-weapon-free zones. Indeed, \r\nnuclear power cannot be developed unless the optimal \r\nconditions for safety and security are in place. Therefore, \r\nall necessary measures must be adopted in order to \r\nstrengthen these elements. I reaffirm my country’s \r\ncommitment to the peaceful use of nuclear energy in \r\nfull transparency and in a safe and sustainable manner.\r\nWith regard to technical cooperation, we are \r\nreassured by the fact that the IAEA continues to \r\nfulfil its mandate “to accelerate and enlarge the \r\ncontribution of atomic energy to peace, health and \r\nprosperity throughout the world”. Indeed, the peaceful \r\napplications of nuclear energy offer solutions to a \r\nseries of socioeconomic and development issues that \r\nare essential to meeting the needs of humankind and \r\nthus to achieving the Millennium Development Goals. \r\nAs underlined in the report, technical cooperation \r\nprojects on issues as varied as nuclear-powered \r\nelectricity, knowledge management, human health, \r\nthe improvement of water management, more accurate \r\ndetermination of the sources of pollution and nuclear \r\nsafety or security enable Member States to find \r\nsolutions to serious development problems. \r\nSenegal therefore recognizes and values the \r\nscientific and technical cooperation that it has with \r\nthe IAEA. This rich and varied cooperation covers \r\nmany areas. First, it includes support for research in \r\nthe area of water resource management, agricultural \r\nproductivity improvement, livestock farming \r\ndevelopment, protection from radiation and research on \r\nsolutions to malnutrition.\r\nSecond is the acquisition of a gamma camera, which \r\nrepresents major progress in the treatment of diabetes, \r\nthyroid disease and cancer. Third is support for the \r\nfight to eliminate the tsetse f ly along the Atlantic coast, \r\nnorth of Dakar. Fourth is cooperation with the IAEA, \r\nwhich has raised research facilities in Senegal to the \r\nstatus of world-class scientific centres. We are grateful \r\nfor the support provided by the United States State \r\nDepartment since 2010 in the fight against the tsetse \r\nf ly in West Africa. Further examples of cooperation \r\nare management training, technology transfer and \r\nexchanges of experts in the context of the various \r\nprojects on which Senegal is working with the Agency. \r\nFifth is energy production and planning and research to \r\nimprove nutrition for women. \r\nStrengthened by such fruitful experience, Senegal \r\nwill spare no effort to expand its excellent cooperation \r\nwith the IAEA, through an aggressive policy to \r\npromote socioeconomic development through nuclear \r\nscience and technology. My delegation therefore calls \r\nfor increased support for the Agency in implementing \r\nits mandate.\r\nMr. Haniff (Malaysia): I would like to take this \r\nopportunity to thank Mr. Amano, Director General \r\nof the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), \r\nfor his circulated statement on the annual report of \r\nthe Agency (see A/67/152), for the period 1 January to \r\n31 December 2011. Malaysia also wishes to commend \r\nthe Director General for his commitment to, and \r\nstewardship of, the IAEA.\r\n12-57291 17\r\nA/67/PV.30\r\nAt this juncture, Malaysia wishes to welcome \r\nthe Republic of Fiji, the Republic of San Marino and \r\nthe Republic of Trinidad and Tobago as new States \r\nmembers of the Agency. The latest addition has resulted \r\nin a total of 155 countries becoming States members \r\nof the Agency. That in turn has further strengthened \r\nand universalized the membership of the Agency, \r\nand has helped it to carry out its role and mandate in \r\nassisting in the development and practical application \r\nof atomic energy for peaceful uses, technology transfer \r\nto developing countries, and promoting nuclear safety, \r\nverification and security. It is indeed pleasing to note \r\nthat, despite its limited resources, not only has the \r\nAgency managed to successfully carry out its work, but \r\nin fact its work has expanded in recent years.\r\nAs with other developing countries, Malaysia fully \r\nsupports the peaceful use by member States of nuclear \r\npower as a source of energy. Currently, the Government \r\nof Malaysia is undertaking an in-depth study on \r\ndeveloping a nuclear power programme in the country, \r\nincluding on its legal and regulatory frameworks. The \r\noverarching objective of the study is to ensure that the \r\nhighest standards of nuclear safety and security are \r\nobserved at all times.\r\nMalaysia has always attached the utmost importance \r\nto nuclear safety. The Fukushima Daiichi incident \r\nhas therefore weighed heavily on Malaysia’s mind as \r\nit embarks on a nuclear power programme. There are \r\ncertainly valuable lessons to be learned. In that regard, \r\nMalaysia welcomes the formulation and implementation \r\nof the IAEA Action Plan on Nuclear Safety, following \r\nthe unprecedented Fukushima accident.\r\nMalaysia also welcomes the report entitled \r\n“Highlights of the Lessons Learned from the IAEA \r\nIntegrated Regulatory Review Service in 2006-2010”, \r\nwhich was presented at the third Workshop on Lessons \r\nLearned from Integrated Regulatory Review Missions \r\nin October 2011. The report addresses areas that need \r\nimprovement, such as the governmental, legal and \r\nregulatory frameworks, certain areas of core regulatory \r\npractices, and the efficiency and effectiveness of the \r\nmissions themselves. It also provides recommendations \r\non how countries can meet the Agency’s safety \r\nrequirements for national safety infrastructures. \r\nMalaysia wishes to extend our support in enhancing \r\nnuclear safety, and looks forward to participating in the \r\nMinisterial Conference on Nuclear Safety, to be held in \r\nFukushima later this year.\r\nFor our part and in response to the Agency’s \r\nrequest, Malaysia has hosted a number of events related \r\nto nuclear radiation, transport and waste safety. In the \r\nlight of the IAEA’s newly revised International Basic \r\nSafety Standards, Malaysia hosted a regional workshop \r\non the IAEA General Safety Requirements in April \r\n2012. We stand ready to assist in hosting similar events \r\nin the future.\r\nMalaysia has consistently considered the issue \r\nof nuclear security to be an inseparable component \r\nof nuclear energy. To that end, we have implemented \r\nvarious legal mechanisms and conventions, \r\nincluding the Convention on Physical Protection \r\nof Nuclear Material and its 2005 Protocol, the \r\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of \r\nActs of Nuclear Terrorism, the Additional Protocol \r\nto the IAEA Safeguards Agreement, the Treaty on \r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), \r\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and the \r\nvarious IAEA codes of conduct.\r\nMalaysia appreciates the opportunity to share its \r\nknowledge on nuclear security, as well as its expertise, \r\nwith a few selected member States. In that regard, \r\nMalaysia will host a regional workshop on radioactive \r\nsource security for industrial radiography with various \r\ndonor member States by the end of 2012. Malaysia also \r\nlooks forward to discussing the possibility of Malaysia \r\nbeing recognized as a centre of excellence for nuclear \r\nsecurity training in the region and beyond.\r\nMalaysia continues to stress the importance of the \r\nTechnical Cooperation Programme in promoting the \r\npeaceful use of nuclear technology. The extension of \r\nthe Programme should obviously be based upon the \r\nneeds and requests of member States. We believe that \r\nthe programme should take into account the evolving \r\nrequirements of member States, as well as the issue of \r\nfunding. At the most recent meeting of the Preparatory \r\nCommittee for the Review Conference of the Parties to \r\nthe NPT, some States parties called for the Technical \r\nCooperation Programme to be supported by the regular \r\nbudget instead of relying on the Technical Cooperation \r\nFund. My delegation joins in that call, and we look \r\nforward to further discussions on the matter under the \r\nworking group for financing the Agency’s activities. \r\nMalaysia has indeed benefited from the Technical \r\nCooperation Programme. At the same time, it has \r\nalso contributed in-kind to the Programme, as well \r\nas provided training and sharing expertise with other \r\nmember States.\r\n18 12-57291\r\nA/67/PV.30\r\nfacilitator for the conference and wishes him success \r\nin this regard.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation wishes to reaffirm \r\nMalaysia’s commitment to continuing its long-standing \r\ncooperation with the work of the Agency in fulfilling \r\nits mandate. Malaysia is confident that the Agency \r\ncould play a greater role in responding to all the needs \r\nof its member States in the future if it were provided \r\nwith greater resources. Nevertheless, we wish to once \r\nagain express our appreciation to the Director General \r\nof the IAEA, as well as to the IAEA secretariat, for the \r\nsignificant and valuable work that they have carried out \r\nthus far. In this regard, Malaysia is pleased to sponsor \r\nthe draft resolution on the report of the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency (A/67/L.3) at the sixty-seventh \r\nsession of the General Assembly.\r\nMrs. Aitimova (Kazakhstan): Kazakhstan wishes \r\nto congratulate Mr. Yukiya Amano, Director General \r\nof the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), on \r\nthe outstanding work of the Agency. The annual report \r\n(see A/67/152) demonstrates the shift in the nature of \r\nthe Agency’s functions from pure verification activities \r\nto safety and security measures for nuclear power \r\nplants, countering potential nuclear terrorism, focusing \r\non nuclear applications and technical cooperation for a \r\nbetter and safer world.\r\nAs a member of the Agency, Kazakhstan is proud \r\nof its record of collaboration in seeking to apply nuclear \r\nenergy, nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation \r\nat the national and Central Asian regional levels. It \r\nis clear today more than ever that it is important to \r\nbring international legal norms in line with the reality \r\nof the existence of de facto nuclear-weapon States, \r\nnecessitating compliance with the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) by States \r\nparties. This is to ensure improved global mechanisms \r\nfor managing processes in the development of nuclear \r\npower. We therefore propose conducting, under the \r\nauspices of the IAEA, regular stress tests of nuclear \r\nplants and protection systems, as well as rapid rescue \r\nresponses.\r\nKazakhstan is a major producer of uranium ore and \r\nhas the fuel fabrication capability to further expand the \r\npeaceful uses of nuclear energy within the framework \r\nof IAEA safeguards. We collaborate with the Russian \r\nFederation in making its uranium available for \r\nenrichment at the national centre in Angarsk, Siberia, \r\nfor use in nuclear power reactors. We are also working \r\nAs for the new project cycle for the period 2013-2014, \r\nmy delegation hopes to work closely with the Agency to \r\nensure that the projects under the Programme will be \r\nadequately funded. My delegation also appreciates the \r\nconfidence that the Agency has placed in Malaysia’s \r\ncontinuing to host the Post-Graduate Education Course \r\nin Radiation Protection, which we would execute to the \r\nbest of our abilities.\r\nMalaysia accords high importance to the peaceful \r\nuses of nuclear science and technology in agricultural, \r\nbiotechnology, industrial, environmental and medical \r\napplications. In that context, Malaysia has always believed \r\nthat research, development and knowledge-sharing are \r\nkey to the successful and sustainable development of \r\nnuclear technology by any member State. Therefore, \r\nMalaysia attaches great importance to research and \r\ndevelopment activities within the framework of \r\ncoordinated research activities, which are an important \r\navenue for multilateral cooperation and the sharing of \r\nknowledge among scientists and engineers across the \r\nglobe.\r\nOn the issue of cancer treatment and research, \r\nMalaysia is committed to further upgrading its cancer \r\ndetection, monitoring and treatment systems. Malaysia \r\nrecognizes and appreciates the role of the IAEA on \r\nnuclear techniques in that regard. We therefore decided \r\nto join the World Health Organization-IAEA Joint \r\nProgramme of Action for Cancer Therapy by requesting \r\nan Integrated Mission for Programme of Action for \r\nCancer Therapy to Malaysia. We wish to thank the \r\nAgency for acceding to our request.\r\nAs a State party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \r\nof Nuclear Weapons, Malaysia will continue to play \r\na constructive role in both bilateral and multilateral \r\ncooperative arrangements in ensuring the security of \r\nnuclear materials. Malaysia commends the consensus \r\nreached in the Final Document of the 2010 NPT Review \r\nConference (see NPT/CONF.2010/50 (Vol.I)).\r\nWe believe that efforts to convene a conference \r\nin 2012 on the establishment of a zone free of nuclear \r\nweapons and all other weapons of mass destruction \r\nin the Middle East should be supported by all. Such a \r\nconference would give momentum to the establishment \r\nof a zone free of nuclear weapons in the Middle \r\nEast, which would undoubtedly contribute to greater \r\npeace and security in the region. Malaysia welcomes \r\nthe appointment of Mr. Jaako Laajava of Finland as \r\n12-57291 19\r\nA/67/PV.30\r\nglobal focal point for nuclear and radiological safety or \r\nsecurity-related incidents.\r\nDespite being a key and responsible member \r\nof IAEA, Kazakhstan is denied the opportunity to \r\nparticipate in the work of elective bodies due to the \r\nexisting rules of procedure. Kazakhstan fully supports \r\nthe early entry into force of the amendments to article \r\nVI of the IAEA statute, and hopes that a solution will \r\nbe found.\r\nKazakhstan’s technical cooperation with IAEA \r\nfrom 2010 to 2015 includes nuclear education, medicine, \r\nagriculture, research reactor safety, and radioisotope \r\nand radiation applications for collective global human \r\nsecurity. My country contributes regularly to the IAEA \r\nbudget, as well as to the Technical Cooperation Fund, \r\nand stands ready to fulfil its financial obligations.\r\nWe express our gratitude to IAEA for its support \r\nto the International Day against Nuclear Tests, and in \r\nthe ongoing activities of the Nuclear Discussion Forum, \r\ninitiated jointly by Kazakhstan and the EastWest \r\nInstitute.\r\nTo conclude, we fully support the mandate of the \r\nIAEA, and look forward to another cycle of even more \r\nproductive collaboration on current and future issues in \r\nnuclear technology.\r\nMr. Khalil (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): I would like \r\nat the outset to thank the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency (IAEA) and its Director General, Mr. Yukiya \r\nAmano, for their valuable work over the past year, as \r\nreflected in the Agency’s report (see A/67/152). Egypt \r\nis eager to join the list of sponsors of the annual draft \r\nresolution on the report of the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency (A/67/L.3).\r\nI would like first to underline the contribution of \r\nnuclear technology to electric power generation. This \r\ndemonstrates in turn our continued interest in the \r\nexercise of the inalienable right to the development, \r\nproduction and peaceful uses of nuclear energy, \r\nas enshrined in article IV of the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).\r\nFor almost half a century, Egypt has devoted \r\nattention to nuclear energy and its peaceful applications. \r\nFollowing Egypt’s transition to a new democratic era \r\nresulting from the revolution of 25 January 2011, we \r\nwill pursue the implementation of Egypt’s peaceful \r\nnuclear programme by establishing our first nuclear \r\nplant for power generation. Egypt looks forward to \r\non the Kurchatov Nuclear Technologies Park, which is \r\nunder IAEA surveillance.\r\nWe support the IAEA initiative to develop a new \r\nframework for nuclear energy based on multilateral \r\napproaches to the nuclear fuel cycle that are non-political \r\nand non-discriminatory. These should be available to \r\nall safeguards-complying member States, so that no \r\nState will need to give up its rights under the NPT.\r\nKazakhstan has officially confirmed in writing to \r\nthe Agency its readiness to host an IAEA nuclear fuel \r\nbank on two of its sites for countries unable to acquire \r\na nuclear fuel supply on the market. As soon as the site \r\nhas been determined, steps will be taken to establish \r\nthe bank. The national atomic energy company, \r\nKazatomprom, is in the process of creating a vertically \r\nintegrated establishment with a complete nuclear fuel \r\ncycle meeting IAEA standards.\r\nThe Central Asian nuclear-weapon-free zone is \r\nanother contribution of our efforts towards a world free \r\nfrom nuclear weapons, to reduce the risk of nuclear \r\nterrorism and the smuggling of nuclear weapons and \r\nradioactive materials in the region, as well as to address \r\nenvironmental concerns regarding ecological radiation. \r\nKazakhstan supports the establishment of a nuclear- \r\nweapon-free zone in the Middle East as a solution for \r\npeace in that region. We will work collaboratively with \r\nthe Facilitator and other Member States towards that \r\ngoal.\r\nWe are consistently implementing the International \r\nConvention for the Suppression of Acts of \r\nNuclear Terrorism, as well as Security Council \r\nresolution 1540 (2004), to strengthen measures \r\nto combat illegal trafficking of nuclear and other \r\nmaterials. As a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group \r\nand the Zangger Committee, Kazakhstan maintains the \r\nstrictest controls over its equipment and installations \r\nthat enrich uranium and reprocess spent nuclear fuel.\r\nLast year, Kazakhstan ratified and acceded to four \r\nmajor nuclear security conventions, and is reviewing a \r\ndraft law to accede to the Vienna Convention on Civil \r\nLiability for Nuclear Damage. We are decommissioning \r\nthe BN-350 nuclear reactor and, with the support of the \r\nUnited States Department of Energy, implementing a \r\nproject to convert the second research reactor to produce \r\nradioisotopes from low-enriched uranium. My country \r\nwelcomes the proposal to strengthen the infrastructure \r\nof the IAEA Incident and Emergency Centre as the \r\n20 12-57291\r\nA/67/PV.30\r\nall of its nuclear facilities to IAEA comprehensive \r\nsafeguards. There is no doubt that this situation has \r\nincreased the nuclear proliferation risk in the Middle \r\nEast and continues to prevent the achievement of the \r\ngoal of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East.\r\nSixth, Egypt stresses the importance of holding the \r\n2012 conference on the establishment of a zone free of \r\nnuclear and other weapons of mass destruction in the \r\nMiddle East, as agreed at the 2010 Review Conference \r\nof the Parties to the NPT. Egypt also emphasizes the \r\nneed for the conference to adopt a concrete and binding \r\noutcome with a view to achieving its objectives, as \r\nset forth at the 2010 Review Conference. Egypt looks \r\nforward to the contribution of the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency to the 2012 conference and to receiving \r\nas soon as possible the background documentation \r\nthat the IAEA has been mandated to prepare for \r\nthe conference. Egypt notes its appreciation for the \r\nAgency’s efforts in organizing a forum in November \r\n2011 on the relevance of the experience gained through \r\nthe establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone to the \r\nMiddle East.\r\nSeventh, Egypt stresses that any retraction from the \r\ncommitment to convene the conference on schedule this \r\nyear, in accordance with the Final Document of the 2010 \r\nReview Conference (see NPT/CONF.2010/50 (Vol. I)), \r\nwill affect the effectiveness and benefit of verification \r\nactivities in the Middle East. It will also affect the \r\nintegrity of international efforts to prevent nuclear \r\nproliferation and the credibility of the NPT review \r\nprocess. It could even lead to the failure of the next \r\nReview Conference in 2015.\r\nEighth, Egypt reiterates the need to enable \r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency to carry \r\nout verification activities related to disarmament \r\nagreements, including those concerning the \r\nestablishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones, now and \r\nin the future. We look forward to the Agency’s active \r\nrole in that domain in the Middle East, through the \r\nimplementation of its five-year Medium-Term Strategy \r\nfor the period 2012-2017. \r\nIn conclusion, Egypt calls on all Member States \r\nto support the three pillars of the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency — verification, nuclear safety and \r\nsecurity, and peaceful uses of nuclear energy — in an \r\nintegrated manner in order to contribute to fulfilling \r\nthe purposes of the United Nations in the maintenance \r\nof international peace and security and in achieving \r\nsustainable development.\r\ncontinued close cooperation with the IAEA in that \r\narea, given the Agency’s growing role in support of \r\nsustainable development.\r\nIn commenting on the IAEA’s report on its activities \r\nin 2012, I would like to highlight the following points. \r\nFirst, the Agency’s technical cooperation activities \r\nare a priority for developing countries in terms of \r\nemploying nuclear applications, including radioisotope, \r\nradiation and other technologies, in the areas of health, \r\nagriculture, food and water resources in order to \r\npromote progress towards development. Egypt calls for \r\nincreased funding for technical cooperation activities, \r\nas well as equitable funding of all of the other activities \r\nof the IAEA. Technical cooperation is a key component \r\nof the work of the Agency pursuant to its statute.\r\nSecond, it is important to enhance international \r\ncooperation in strengthening national capacities in \r\nnuclear safety and emergency response to radiological \r\nand nuclear accidents. That would help to ensure easy \r\naccess to safety information and equitable transfer of \r\nrelated technology. My delegation takes this opportunity \r\nto emphasize that the Agency should intensify efforts \r\nto assist member States in emergency preparedness and \r\nresponse to nuclear accidents by promoting technology \r\ntransfer and capacity-building activities, including \r\neducation and training in the field of crisis management.\r\nThird, we stress that any rules or guidelines on \r\nnuclear security and safety must be developed and \r\nnegotiated within a multilateral framework. Measures \r\nand initiatives aimed at strengthening nuclear security \r\nand safety should not be used as an excuse to restrict \r\nthe inalienable right of developing countries to develop \r\nnuclear energy for peaceful purposes, in accordance \r\nwith the statute of the Agency.\r\nFourth, the role of the IAEA in verification and \r\nnuclear non-proliferation is closely related to its role in \r\npromoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy in support \r\nof States’ development programmes that fulfil their \r\nobligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \r\nof Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the statute of the IAEA.\r\nFifth, all countries of the Middle East except \r\nIsrael have joined the IAEA comprehensive safeguards \r\nsystem. Israel remains the only country in the region \r\nwith ambiguous nuclear activities that are not subject to \r\ninternational control and supervision. Israel continues \r\nto ignore the resolutions of the General Assembly and \r\nthe General Conference of the IAEA urging it to accede \r\nto the NPT as a non-nuclear-weapon State and to subject \r\n12-57291 21\r\nA/67/PV.30\r\ncreate an international network of nuclear fuel cycle \r\ncentres.\r\nWe note with satisfaction that while our initiative \r\nhas been sorely needed, it is also truly capable \r\nof resolving the tasks necessary to guarantee the \r\nunhampered access of all NPT States parties to the \r\nbenefits of the peaceful use of nuclear energy, provided \r\nthat they faithfully comply with their non-proliferation \r\nobligations.\r\nIn practice, however, it has afforded States the \r\nability to enjoy the advantages of nuclear energy and to \r\nguarantee their nuclear fuel needs without introducing \r\nelements to the nuclear fuel cycle that are expensive and \r\nunsound from the standpoint of nuclear proliferation. \r\nIn the context of that initiative, together with \r\nKazakhstan, Ukraine and Armenia, we have launched \r\non Russian territory an international uranium \r\nenrichment centre, to which we invite all States \r\nworking to develop nuclear power in compliance with \r\ntheir non-proliferation obligations.\r\nAnother important step in establishing the global \r\nnuclear energy infrastructure was the creation in \r\nRussia of a shared supply of low-enriched uranium \r\nadministered by IAEA. It has already been fully \r\nestablished, and States members of the Agency that are \r\nin compliance with their non-proliferation obligations \r\nare eligible to enjoy that resource.\r\nWe are convinced that lessons must be drawn \r\nfrom the outcome of the accident at the Fukushima \r\nDaiichi nuclear power plant in order to prevent such a \r\nrecurrence in future. The central role in that endeavour \r\nmust belong to the Agency as the only international \r\norganization with the requisite expertise and authority. \r\nOne of the key lessons of the Fukushima accident is \r\nthat the international community needs to perfect the \r\ninternational legal framework and the technological \r\nand organizational aspects of nuclear safety.\r\nBased on that understanding, Russia has proposed \r\nimportant initiatives to fill the existing gaps in relevant \r\ninternational legal documents and instruments. In that \r\ncontext, we note additions to the Convention on Nuclear \r\nSafety and the Convention on Early Notification \r\nof a Nuclear Accident. Moreover, Russia has made \r\nproposals to improve the Agency’s safety standards \r\nand anticipates that these initiatives will enjoy broad \r\nsupport and come to fruition.\r\nMr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): We have carefully studied the report of \r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to \r\nthe General Assembly (see A/67/152). Russia highly \r\ncommends the work of the Agency aimed at improving \r\nand strengthening the global non-proliferation regime \r\nand at guaranteeing the widespread and safe use of \r\nnuclear energy.\r\nThe Agency is making a noteworthy contribution \r\nto resolving the issues of a secure energy supply, the \r\nfight against the global effects of climate change, \r\nand maintaining the health and well-being of people \r\nthroughout the world. It is important that the Agency \r\ncontinue to formulate its efforts based on broader \r\ninternational cooperation in the peaceful use of nuclear \r\nenergy.\r\nIn speaking of the Agency’s activities, we cannot fail \r\nto note the unique nature of its verification mechanism, \r\nwhich enables the highly efficient tracking of States’ \r\nimplementation of their obligations under the Treaty on \r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).\r\nWe advocate improvement of the Agency’s \r\nverification capacity, including through the adoption of \r\nthe additional protocol to its comprehensive safeguards \r\nsystem as the universally accepted standard for States’ \r\nimplementation of their nuclear non-proliferation \r\nobligations. An unbiased approach to nuclear \r\nverification based on objective indicators is the most \r\nimportant element in supporting the legitimacy of \r\nthe IAEA comprehensive safeguards system and the \r\nnon-proliferation regime in general.\r\nRussia is actively participating in the Agency’s \r\nactivities as a financial donor, including through its \r\nvoluntary contributions to the International Project on \r\nInnovative Nuclear Reactors and Fuel Cycles and the \r\nNuclear Security Fund. We wholeheartedly support \r\nthe efforts of the Agency in technical cooperation and \r\nthe provision of appropriate assistance to developing \r\nStates. \r\nIn the context of the large-scale development of \r\nnuclear energy, the Russian Federation attaches priority \r\nto establishing a new architecture for peaceful nuclear \r\ncooperation based on multilateral approaches to the \r\nnuclear fuel cycle; the guaranteed provision of services \r\nfor the nuclear fuel cycle; and resolving problems of \r\nspent fuel and radioactive waste management. On the \r\nbasis of those priorities, Russia has launched an initiative \r\nto develop a global nuclear energy infrastructure and \r\n22 12-57291\r\nA/67/PV.30\r\nThe Agency’s support in areas such as food and \r\nagriculture, human health, water resource management \r\nand the environment is essential to the attainment of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. Furthermore, \r\nmy delegation welcomes the publication of training \r\npackages for medical physicists in the area of diagnostic \r\nradiology and nuclear medicine. South Africa continues \r\nto host fellows and scientific visitors to assist capacity-\r\nbuilding in nuclear medicine.\r\nMy country also welcomes the Africa pilot project \r\nof the Virtual University and Regional Training \r\nNetwork for Cancer Control, which entered its second \r\nyear in 2011. The project is both a vehicle and a \r\nfacilitating mechanism to enhance cancer control, \r\ne-learning, education and training in Africa, and South \r\nAfrica looks forward to participating in the initiative, \r\nwhich will pave the way for subregional cancer control \r\nworkforce training hubs.\r\nGlobal security of energy supply has become one \r\nof the key focus areas worldwide, mainly because \r\nof decreasing natural resources, global warming, \r\nclimate change, pollution and rapid global growth. \r\nSouth Africa’s nuclear energy policy is driven by \r\nthe imperative of ensuring the security of its energy \r\nsupply and reducing its carbon footprint, and by the \r\nbeneficiation of our strategic mineral resources for the \r\neconomic development of our country.\r\nIn that regard, my Government approved the \r\nIntegrated Resource Plan 2010-2030, which incorporates \r\na significant expansion of nuclear power by the year \r\n2030. The Cabinet has also established the National \r\nNuclear Energy Executive Coordination Committee, \r\nan executive body comprised of ministers who have a \r\ndirect role to play in the nuclear energy programme. \r\nIn preparation for its nuclear build programme, South \r\nAfrica has adopted the IAEA milestones approach, \r\nwhich addresses many critical elements necessary for \r\nsuccessful implementation.\r\nSouth Africa is working closely with the Agency, \r\nand has requested an Integrated Nuclear Infrastructure \r\nReview Mission in the country. In that context, the \r\nSouth African Minister of Energy recently announced \r\nSouth Africa’s intention to invite the IAEA to conduct \r\nan external assessment of its readiness and to identify \r\nany possible risks that may need attention in order to \r\nensure a successful nuclear build programme.\r\nRegarding nuclear safety, South Africa is pleased \r\nto note that the level of nuclear safety among the \r\nAn extremely important task remains to establish \r\na due level of protection of all nuclear facilities and \r\nmaterials in order to prevent possible perpetration of acts \r\nof nuclear terrorism by non-State actors. In the interest \r\nof strengthening nuclear physical security, Russia was \r\na sponsor of Security Council resolution 1540 (2004). \r\nTogether with the United States, in 2006 it introduced \r\nthe Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism. The \r\nInitiative is now supported by 85 States and serves as \r\nan effective instrument of cooperation in the sharing of \r\nextensive experience and practical measures aimed at \r\ncountering the threat of nuclear terrorism.\r\nRussia has signed and ratified the International \r\nConvention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear \r\nTerrorism and the Convention on the Physical Protection \r\nof Nuclear Material and Nuclear Facilities, as well as its \r\namendment. We call on the States that have not yet done \r\nso to expedite completion of their domestic procedures \r\nin order to accede to those most important international \r\ninstruments.\r\nWe are convinced that the Agency must play the \r\ncentral role in coordinating States’ efforts to guarantee \r\nnuclear security. We support the implementation of the \r\nAgency’s programme on that issue for 2010-2013 and \r\nits proposal to convene an international conference on \r\nnuclear security issues in 2013.\r\nRussia positively commends the practical \r\ncontribution of the Agency to the multilateral quest for \r\nways to resolve regional proliferation challenges. We \r\ncommend the endeavours of the Agency in using its \r\nexpert potential to ensure the sustainable functioning \r\nof the nuclear non-proliferation regime. \r\nWe support draft resolution A/67/L.3 on the report of \r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency. As a sponsor \r\nof the draft resolution, Russia wholeheartedly endorses \r\nthe work of the Agency in the interest of strengthening \r\nand ensuring the nuclear non-proliferation regime and \r\nachieving reliable energy supplies.\r\nMr. Kellerman (South Africa): First of all, \r\nmy delegation thanks the Director General of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and \r\nhis staff for the comprehensive overview of IAEA \r\nactivities contained in the Agency’s annual report (see \r\nA/67/152). We appreciate the valuable contribution of \r\nthe Agency in supporting developing countries’ use \r\nof nuclear science and technology to address national \r\ndevelopment needs. \r\n12-57291 23\r\nA/67/PV.30\r\n“to facilitate, and have the right to participate in, the \r\nfullest possible exchange of equipment, materials \r\nand scientific and technological information for the \r\npeaceful uses of nuclear energy”. \r\nFurthermore, in that context, we underline the \r\nimportance of article III of the NPT, according to which \r\neven the required safeguards\r\n“shall be implemented in a manner designed \r\nto comply with article IV of this Treaty, and to \r\navoid hampering the economic or technological \r\ndevelopment of the Parties or international \r\ncooperation in the field of peaceful nuclear \r\nactivities, including the international exchange of \r\nnuclear material and equipment for the processing, \r\nuse or production of nuclear material for peaceful \r\npurposes”. \r\nMy delegation also would like to emphasize that, \r\naccording to articles II and III of the IAEA statute, \r\n“[t]he Agency shall seek to accelerate and enlarge the \r\ncontribution of atomic energy to peace, health and \r\nprosperity throughout the world...; [t]o encourage \r\nand assist research on, and development and \r\npractical application of, atomic energy for peaceful \r\nuses throughout the world; and, if requested to \r\ndo so, to act as an intermediary for the purposes \r\nof securing the performance of services or the \r\nsupplying of materials, equipment, or facilities by \r\none member of the Agency for another...; to perform \r\nany operation or service useful in research on, or \r\ndevelopment or practical application of, atomic \r\nenergy for peaceful purposes; [and t]o foster the \r\nexchange of scientific and technical information on \r\npeaceful uses of atomic energy”.\r\nAccordingly, we underline the Agency’s primary \r\nresponsibility to assist member States and the \r\nimportance of its other statutory functions. In that \r\nconnection, we stress the need for strict observance \r\nby the IAEA of the principles of impartiality and \r\nprofessionalism; along with the States members of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement, “strongly reject attempts by \r\nany State to politicize the work of the IAEA, including \r\nits Technical Cooperation Programme”; and call for \r\nan end to any interference in the Agency’s activities, \r\nespecially its verification process, as such acts could \r\njeopardize the authority, efficiency and credibility of \r\nthe IAEA and endanger the credibility of the NPT and \r\nthe inalienable right of its parties to develop research, \r\n435 nuclear power plants in operation around the world \r\nremains high. My delegation takes note of the activities \r\nundertaken by the Agency to increase nuclear safety as \r\ndetailed in the Director General’s report on the IAEA \r\nAction Plan on Nuclear Safety.\r\nIn conclusion, South Africa attaches great \r\nimportance to the Agency’s Technical Cooperation \r\nProgramme. We welcome the support rendered through \r\na range of regional and national projects to address \r\nsocioeconomic development needs of Member States, \r\nespecially African countries. In that regard, we also \r\nvalue the continuous support of the Agency through \r\nthe activities of the African Regional Cooperative \r\nAgreement for Research, Development and Training \r\nrelated to Nuclear Science and Technology — in Africa \r\nand in the region. \r\nMr. Khazaee (Islamic Republic of Iran): Nuclear \r\nscience is among the greatest achievements of \r\nhumankind and should therefore be used to serve its \r\nwell-being. Given the numerous peaceful applications of \r\nnuclear technology as a cost-effective, environmentally \r\nfriendly and climatically benign source of energy, it \r\nhas gained a prominent position in the economic life \r\nand advancement of nations. Without a doubt, demand \r\nfor the development and use of nuclear energy and \r\ntechnology will continue to grow in future.\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran considers the \r\ninalienable right to develop research, production and \r\nuses of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without \r\ndiscrimination — including the right of every State \r\nparty to develop for peaceful purposes a full national \r\nnuclear fuel cycle — to be the very foundation and \r\none of the most important pillars of the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). While \r\nattaching great importance to the full, effective, balanced, \r\nsimultaneous, non-selective and non-discriminatory \r\nimplementation of all provisions of the NPT, we \r\nstrongly stress that the exercise of the inalienable right \r\nto pursue nuclear science, energy and technology for \r\npeaceful purposes, which is an inherent part of the \r\nsovereignty of States parties, can never be suspended \r\nor restricted by any organ, under any circumstances or \r\npretexts whatsoever.\r\nAccording to article IV of the NPT, not only shall \r\nnothing in the Treaty be interpreted as affecting that \r\ninalienable right, but all parties have a firm legal \r\nobligation \r\n24 12-57291\r\nA/67/PV.30\r\nand its big ally. One may easily conclude that such \r\ninformation is as credible as the childish cartoon that \r\nwas drawn here in this Hall in September by the Zionist \r\nregime’s Prime Minister.\r\nMrs. Cizare (Ethiopia): First of all, I would like \r\nto thank Ambassador Yukiya Amano, Director General \r\nof the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), \r\nfor his annual report on the work of the Agency (see \r\nA/67/152). I also wish to express our support for the \r\ndraft resolution before us (A/67/L.3).\r\nEthiopia firmly believes that the work of the IAEA \r\nin general, and specifically its annual activities as \r\ndescribed in the report, are of paramount importance \r\nto ensuring the maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity. We also acknowledge the Agency’s growing \r\nrole in ensuring that nuclear science and technology are \r\nused only for peaceful purposes, as well as its technical \r\ncooperation in bringing about tangible progress in \r\nnational efforts to reduce poverty and achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals.\r\nEthiopia is one of the beneficiary States of the \r\nIAEA’s activities under the Agency’s Technical \r\nCooperation Programme. The Agency’s support \r\nhas been instrumental in helping us develop modest \r\ncapabilities in the control of tsetse f lies, the treatment \r\nof cancer, diagnostic nuclear medicine services, isotope \r\nhydrological analysis and non-destructive quality \r\ntesting. Despite that encouraging cooperation, I would \r\nlike to underline that we are still far from the optimal \r\nuse of the transferred technologies or from sustaining \r\nthe services initiated through the various technical \r\ncooperation projects that have been implemented in the \r\npast several years.\r\nOur major technical cooperation project with the \r\nAgency is aimed at eradicating the tsetse f ly from the \r\nsouthern Rift Valley region of Ethiopia through an \r\nintegrated pest-management approach. The project is \r\ncurrently being implemented, and, so far, remarkable \r\nachievements have been registered and quite a \r\nsubstantial number of communities have benefited \r\nby regaining their farmland and seeing the return of \r\nhealth to their livestock. The project has been and \r\nwill continue to be the top priority in our technical \r\ncooperation with the IAEA. In that regard, we wish \r\nto request that the Agency continue to accord high \r\npriority to agricultural and livestock development in \r\nAfrica, including in Ethiopia. My country reaffirms \r\nits strong commitment to peaceful nuclear applications \r\nas an important component of the effort to tackle the \r\nproduction and use of nuclear energy for peaceful \r\npurposes without discrimination. \r\nUnfortunately, the application of a discriminatory, \r\nselective, highly restrictive and politically motivated \r\napproach to nuclear cooperation by developed States \r\nparties to the NPT, the main suppliers of nuclear high \r\ntechnology, has given rise to the impression that being a \r\nparty to the NPT is not a privilege, because rather than \r\nfacilitating nuclear cooperation, it impedes it. In that \r\nconnection, it is a source of grave concern that those \r\nwho have chosen not to accede to the NPT not only \r\nare not subject to any pressure to do so, but are also \r\nencouraged and generously rewarded in different ways. \r\nA living example is the well-documented \r\nassistance and cooperation provided by certain Western \r\ncountries — in particular, the United States and the \r\ntwo nuclear-weapon States members of the European \r\nUnion, the United Kingdom and France — to the Israeli \r\nregime, which, in addition to having an unsafeguarded \r\nnuclear programme, possesses one of the world’s \r\nlargest stockpiles of nuclear weapons. Such measures, \r\nof course, run counter to the letter and spirit of the NPT \r\nand, accordingly, are clear cases of non-compliance \r\nwith the explicit legal obligations under the Treaty. \r\nUndoubtedly, those policies severely undermine the \r\nuniversality, relevance, integrity and credibility of \r\nthe NPT. We did not see any reference to that point \r\nby the Director General of the IAEA in his statement \r\ndistributed today. \r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran, while being extremely \r\nproud that it is exercising its inalienable right to the \r\npeaceful uses of nuclear energy, is also fully committed \r\nto its legal obligations, and its nuclear activities are and \r\nhave always been exclusively for peaceful purposes. \r\nDespite all external political pressures on the IAEA, \r\nit has repeatedly concluded that “declared nuclear \r\nmaterial in Iran remain[s] in peaceful activities”. In that \r\nregard, it is worth noting that that is exactly the same \r\nconclusion that the IAEA secretariat has come to for \r\n51 States with additional protocols in force, as well as \r\nfor 61 States without additional protocols in force.\r\nFinally, with regard to the so-called alleged studies \r\non Iran’s nuclear programme referred to in the IAEA \r\nreport, I would like to point out that they are forged \r\nreports and include graphs that are not credible, which \r\nis why the Agency is not allowed to make them available \r\nto the Islamic Republic of Iran. As always, most of that \r\ninformation has been provided by the Israeli regime \r\n12-57291 25\r\nA/67/PV.30\r\nWe share the Agency’s assessment that nuclear \r\nenergy should continue to be a preferred source of \r\nviable, safe and sustainable alternative energy in the \r\nfuture, despite the justifiable public anxiety that arose \r\nin the wake of the Fukushima accident.\r\nPakistan recognizes the important role played by \r\nIAEA verification regime. We have fully complied with \r\nour obligations pursuant to our Safeguards Agreements \r\nwith the IAEA. The unanimous approval last year by the \r\nIAEA Board of our C.3 and C.4 Safeguards Agreements \r\nreflected the international community’s recognition of \r\nPakistan’s expertise in the safe and secure operation of \r\nnuclear power plants.\r\nPakistan believes that all States should fully comply \r\nwith their safeguards obligations and international \r\ncommitments in order to maintain the credibility of \r\nthe safeguards regime. Maintaining a balance between \r\nthe regulatory, promotional and safety functions of the \r\nAgency is essential. The Agency must be seen by all \r\nmember States as an impartial, efficient and professional \r\nbody. It is important to correct the public perception of \r\nthe IAEA as being only a watchdog. Its primary role in \r\nthe promotion of peaceful uses of nuclear science and \r\ntechnology needs to be re-emphasized.\r\nPakistan is a strong advocate of utilizing nuclear \r\ntechnology for peace, progress and prosperity for all. \r\nAs Pakistan is the sixth most populous nation in the \r\nworld, socioeconomic development is a priority for \r\nour Government. For over 55 years now, the Pakistan \r\nAtomic Energy Commission has been actively engaged \r\nin harnessing nuclear technology for our development \r\npriorities. In the past five decades, Pakistan has sought \r\nto enhance the application of nuclear technology for our \r\npeople in a variety of ways and in collaboration with \r\nthe Agency.\r\nEven as we utilize nuclear technology for diverse \r\npurposes, the harnessing of nuclear science for power \r\ngeneration remains a priority. At present, the share of \r\nnuclear power in Pakistan’s electricity mix is modest. \r\nHowever, in view of our large population, the deficit \r\nin fossil fuels and rising energy demand, we plan to \r\nincrease the current level of 750 megawatts of nuclear \r\npower-generation capacity to at least 8,800 megawatts \r\nby the year 2030. That is a challenging task, but we are \r\ndetermined to pursue it as an important development \r\nimperative.\r\nThree nuclear power plants are already on line and \r\nhave been performing very well. The oldest of these \r\nchallenges of development. In that regard, the support \r\nof the IAEA in ensuring food safety and security, as \r\nwell as energy, through nuclear technology should be \r\nmaintained and strengthened.\r\nThe other important area of partnership where \r\nEthiopia continues to benefit from the IAEA Technical \r\nCooperation Programme is the application of nuclear \r\ntechnology and techniques in the area of human health. \r\nIn response to the rise in the number of cases of cancer in \r\ndeveloping countries, Ethiopia has come increasingly to \r\nrely on the IAEA’s comprehensive Programme of Action \r\nfor Cancer Therapy. In that respect, while expressing \r\nappreciation to the Agency for its technical assistance \r\nand for the impact assessment made, Ethiopia hopes to \r\nsee a further strengthening of our partnership with the \r\nAgency. The annual incidence of cancer is estimated \r\nto be about 150,000 cases, of which 80 per cent will \r\nrequire radiotherapy. It is for that compelling reason \r\nthat we call upon the Agency to further strengthen its \r\nsupport to Ethiopia and other developing countries in \r\nthe fight against cancer through sustainable cancer \r\ntherapy programmes by carrying out more integrated \r\nnational and regional programmes.\r\nIn conclusion, as one of the founding States \r\nmembers of the Agency, Ethiopia reiterates its strong \r\ncommitment to the peaceful use of nuclear technologies \r\nand to respecting and implementing global and regional \r\ninstruments designed to control radioactive and other \r\nnuclear materials. However, we are also fully aware \r\nthat the threats of nuclear weapons to international \r\npeace and security are real and need to be confronted \r\nwith collective and concerted efforts. Ethiopia will \r\ncontinue to support the IAEA’s activities to effectively \r\nexecute its global mandate of ensuring the peaceful \r\nuse of nuclear science and technology for the benefit \r\nof humankind.\r\nMr. Hashmi (Pakistan): We thank Director \r\nGeneral Amano for presenting the annual report of \r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and \r\ncongratulate Fiji, San Marino and Trinidad and Tobago \r\non becoming the newest members of the Agency.\r\nFor over five decades, the IAEA has worked \r\nsuccessfully as a catalyst for promoting nuclear science \r\nand related technologies. It has helped member States \r\nadvance their development priorities, while ensuring \r\nthat nuclear science and technology are used in a safe, \r\nsecure and sustainable manner. For that, the Agency \r\ndeserves the deep appreciation of us all.\r\n26 12-57291\r\nA/67/PV.30\r\nPakistan is implementing a cradle-to-grave concept, \r\nin accordance with IAEA nuclear security series \r\ndocuments.\r\nFinally, the IAEA can make a significant \r\ncontribution to increasing the contribution of atomic \r\nenergy to peace, health and prosperity throughout \r\nthe world. The Agency is uniquely placed to meet the \r\nneeds and challenges of the twenty-first century in a \r\nbalanced manner. Pakistan believes in an equitable, \r\nnon-discriminatory and criteria-based approach to \r\nadvance the universally shared goals of non-proliferation \r\nand promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. \r\nWe hope that  safety and security considerations will \r\nfacilitate, not hinder, the pursuit of the peaceful uses of \r\nnuclear energy for promoting the development agenda \r\nand offsetting environmental degradation.\r\nMr. Shin Dong Ik (Republic of Korea): At the \r\noutset, my delegation would like to thank Mr. Yukiya \r\nAmano, Director General of the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency (IAEA), for transmitting the IAEA’s \r\nannual report for 2011 (see A/67/152) and for providing \r\nadditional information on the Agency’s more recent \r\ndevelopments and activities in his prepared statement \r\n(see A/67/152/Add.1). We appreciate the competent and \r\nprofessional manner in which the Director General \r\nand the Secretariat have steered the Agency through \r\nits extensive activities with a view to accelerating \r\nand expanding the contribution of atomic energy to \r\npeace, health and prosperity throughout the world. \r\nWe note with particular appreciation that, in carrying \r\nout its mandate, the Agency has risen to meet an \r\narray of challenges, ranging from the risks of nuclear \r\nproliferation and nuclear terrorism, to nuclear safety in \r\nthe wake of the Fukushima accident last year.\r\nIn that context, my delegation would like to \r\ncommend the Agency for its achievements in the \r\nfield of nuclear safety. As outlined in the report, the \r\nAgency has been successful in implementing the \r\nAction Plan on Nuclear Safety adopted at the fifty-\r\nfifth session of the IAEA’s General Conference, held \r\nlast year. Through implementation of the Action Plan \r\nwith the full cooperation and participation of member \r\nStates, the Agency is successfully incorporating the \r\nlessons learned from Fukushima, thereby enhancing \r\nthe effectiveness of both the regulatory framework and \r\nthe operating organizations in IAEA member States. \r\nWe also note with satisfaction that the Agency has \r\ntaken steps to upgrade its emergency preparedness and \r\nresponse capabilities as a whole, which we anticipate \r\nwas commissioned way back in 1972. Besides those \r\nthree, two more nuclear power plants, generating 340 \r\nmegawatts each, are under construction and are expected \r\nto be commissioned by 2016. All nuclear power plants \r\nin Pakistan operate under IAEA safeguards.\r\nPakistan has also been actively engaged in \r\ndrawing lessons from the events at Fukushima. As a \r\nresult of stress tests and extensive studies, a response \r\naction plan has been developed in collaboration with \r\nthe Pakistan Nuclear Regulatory Authority (PNRA). \r\nThe plan is at various stages of implementation \r\nunder PNRA oversight. Pakistan has always attached \r\ngreat importance to ensuring that all its work in the \r\nnuclear power domain is conducted within secure and \r\ntransparent institutional structures. At the national \r\nlevel, the Pakistan Nuclear Regulatory Authority, \r\nwhich is an independent regulatory and licensing body, \r\nhas been performing professionally and efficiently \r\nfor 11 years now. At the international level, we have \r\nhad a long-standing engagement with IAEA forums. \r\nWe have invited and supported World Association of \r\nNuclear Operators peer review missions. We have also \r\nwelcomed individual experts under the aegis of the \r\nIAEA.\r\nIt is a matter of growing concern that even the \r\nsupply of safety-related equipment has fallen victim \r\nto the restrictive and discriminatory export-control \r\npolicies of some States. That does not augur well for the \r\nIAEA’s goal of encouraging worldwide enhancement of \r\nsafety standards.\r\nNuclear security is both a global challenge and a \r\nnational responsibility. Pakistan accords the highest \r\npriority to ensuring the establishment of robust \r\nsecurity mechanisms. Over the years, we have put in \r\nplace extensive physical protection measures, robust \r\ncommand-and-control structures, comprehensive \r\nexport controls and wide-ranging regulatory regimes. In \r\ncooperation with the IAEA, Pakistan is implementing \r\na nuclear security action plan that has been called a \r\nmodel for other States. We have gained considerable \r\nexperience in the field of nuclear security. A national \r\ntraining academy runs multi-tier training modules for \r\ncomprehensive nuclear security solutions, and is being \r\nopened for international training courses as well. A \r\nnuclear emergency management system is being put \r\nin place. Pakistan subscribes to the IAEA’s Code of \r\nConduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive \r\nSources, and to its Illicit Trafficking Database. Where \r\nthe security of radioactive sources is concerned, \r\n12-57291 27\r\nA/67/PV.30\r\nAgreement between the Agency and the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea, adopted by consensus \r\nat the fifty-sixth session of the General Conference, \r\nheld this year. We also reiterate the international \r\ncommunity’s call for the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea to come into full compliance with the NPT \r\nand to cooperate promptly with the Agency in the \r\nfull and effective implementation of comprehensive \r\nsafeguards. The resolution voices the international \r\ncommunity’s serious concern about the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea’s nuclear programme, \r\nincluding its construction of a light-water reactor and \r\nits uranium enrichment activities. The resolution also \r\nreaffirms the consensus that exists in the international \r\ncommunity that the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea should not have nuclear-weapon-State status. It \r\nalso underlines concern about the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea’s statement in August announcing \r\nits intention to totally re-examine its nuclear policy. As \r\nthe resolution clearly states, whatever that review may \r\nconsist of, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea \r\nmust reaffirm its commitment to denuclearization and \r\nto the 2005 Joint Statement of the Six-Party Talks.\r\nWith regard to the Agency’s activities in the field of \r\nsafeguards, we welcome the continuing increase in the \r\nnumber of countries for which both a comprehensive \r\nsafeguards agreement and an additional protocol are in \r\nforce. With a total of 114 States now having additional \r\nprotocols in force — an increase of 10 since the last \r\nreport — the additional protocol is well on its way \r\nto becoming the universal international safeguards \r\nstandard.\r\nWe strongly believe that the additional protocol \r\nconstitutes a crucial verification instrument that \r\nnot only enhances the Agency’s ability to verify the \r\npeaceful nature of all nuclear material in a State but \r\nalso ensures international confidence in a State’s \r\nnuclear programme. In that regard, we call for other \r\nmember States to conclude and bring into force the \r\ncomprehensive safeguards agreement and the additional \r\nprotocol if they have not yet done so.\r\nIn the light of the full support for the IAEA’s work to \r\nachieve our common goal of harnessing nuclear energy \r\nin the service of peace and development for humankind, \r\nthe Republic of Korea is pleased to co-sponsor draft \r\nresolution A/67/L.3 on the report of the IAEA.\r\nMr. Tarbah (Libya) (spoke in Arabic): At the outset, \r\nwe would like to congratulate Mr. Yukiya Amano, \r\nDirector General of the International Atomic Energy \r\nwill result in tangible improvements to national \r\nemergency preparedness and response arrangements.\r\nThe work of the IAEA in the field of nuclear \r\nsecurity, particularly its efforts to coordinate and \r\nenhance cooperation among various initiatives and \r\nactivities, is also worthy of note. We welcome the \r\nprogress that the Agency has made in implementing \r\nthe goals and priorities set out in its Nuclear Security \r\nReport 2011. We are also pleased to note the successful \r\nestablishment of the Nuclear Security Guidance \r\nCommittee as a standing body of experts on nuclear \r\nsecurity.\r\nThe Republic of Korea hosted the second Nuclear \r\nSecurity Summit last March in Seoul. The Seoul \r\nSummit resulted in comprehensive agreed measures \r\nfor action to prevent nuclear and radiological terrorism, \r\nincluding eliminating and reducing nuclear materials; \r\nencouraging wider adherence to international \r\ninstruments; and combating the illicit trafficking of \r\nnuclear and radiological materials. In addition, the \r\nSeoul Summit emphasized the central role that the \r\nIAEA plays in strengthening the international nuclear \r\nsecurity framework. In that regard, we welcome and \r\nsupport the IAEA International Conference on Nuclear \r\nSecurity, to be held in Vienna in July 2013. My delegation \r\nis convinced that the Conference will provide a timely \r\nglobal forum to discuss future directions and priorities \r\nfor nuclear security, as well as generate valuable input \r\nfor the preparation of the 2014-2017 Nuclear Security \r\nPlan.\r\nIn early September, the Director General released \r\nan updated report on the application of safeguards in the \r\nDemocratic  People’s Republic of Korea. As the Director \r\nGeneral stated in his report, the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea’s nuclear programme is a matter \r\nof serious concern, and its statements about uranium \r\nenrichment activities and the construction of a light-\r\nwater reactor continue to be deeply troubling. Sharing \r\nas we do the Director General’s serious concern, my \r\ndelegation would like to point out that those activities \r\nare a clear breach of Security Council resolutions 1718 \r\n(2006) and 1874 (2009). My delegation therefore urges \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to comply \r\nfully with its obligations under the relevant resolutions \r\nof the Council.\r\nFurthermore, we would like to recall the \r\nresolution on the implementation of the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) Safeguards \r\n28 12-57291\r\nA/67/PV.30\r\nFirst of all, the International Atomic Energy Agency \r\n(IAEA) is without justification and has no power to \r\nintervene on the nuclear issue of the Korea peninsula. \r\nThe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is not a \r\nState party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons or a member of the IAEA. As far as \r\nour relationship with the IAEA is concerned, already \r\nin the early 1990s the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea cut off its official relations with the Agency \r\nand severed all contacts of any kind with it. We made \r\nthat decision when the Agency lost the impartiality \r\nexpected of an international organization by adopting \r\nthe wrongful and biased attitude implicit in siding with \r\nthe politically motivated conspiracy of the United States \r\nagainst the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.\r\nHowever, at a later stage, the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea and the United States entered into \r\nbilateral talks and the Six-Party Talks were opened, \r\nat which point the United States requested that the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea allow the \r\nIAEA to offer technical consultation on the sidelines \r\nof the Six-Party Talks. We reluctantly honoured that \r\nrequest. The condition for that allowance was that the \r\nconsultation would take place only while the Six-Party \r\nTalks were in progress. \r\nNevertheless, considering the current situation \r\nand developments on the Korean peninsula, the United \r\nStates has not hesitated to escalate, aggravate and \r\nramp up its threats and attempts at blackmail through \r\nincreased hostilities towards the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea. The situation on the peninsula is on \r\nthe brink of explosion. Nobody knows when war may \r\nbreak out. \r\nIn those circumstances, the Six-Party Talks \r\nhave come nearly to the point of being a dead letter. \r\nIn that state of affairs, the IAEA has no role to play. \r\nFurthermore, the IAEA has sided with the hostile \r\nUnited States against the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea, blindly following the United States policy \r\nagainst my country. It has complicated the way towards \r\na peaceful resolution of the nuclear issue on the Korean \r\npeninsula. We can therefore say that the IAEA has no \r\njustifiable role to play. \r\nDespite all of the foregoing, we now have this \r\nyear’s annual report before us. The IAEA has come \r\nout and produced such language as “deeply troubling” \r\nwith regard to the new enrichment facilities and light-\r\nwater reactor construction, while also expressing the \r\nAgency (IAEA), for the valuable and comprehensive \r\nreport on the activities of the Agency (see A/67/152). \r\nThe report reflects the sincere efforts made to \r\nachieve the international goals set by the international \r\ncommunity, foremost of which are non-proliferation, \r\nthe complete elimination of nuclear weapons, the use \r\nof nuclear energy for sustainable development and the \r\nadvancement of scientific knowledge for the good of \r\nall humankind in all areas. We would like to stress the \r\nfollowing points.\r\nFirst, we emphasize the importance and central role \r\nof the IAEA in the areas of inspection and verification, \r\nas well as in providing technical assistance to \r\ndeveloping countries in the peaceful uses of nuclear \r\nenergy. Secondly, we stress the inalienable right of all \r\nStates to acquire and use nuclear energy for peaceful \r\npurposes, as well as the need to avoid a monopoly on \r\nnuclear technology by some States while depriving \r\nothers from acquiring it. Thirdly, we underline the need \r\nfor all member States to commit without exception to \r\nopening their nuclear facilities to IAEA inspection and \r\nverification. Fourthly, the international community \r\nshould bring pressure to bear on Israel to accede to the \r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \r\nand to open its nuclear facilities to the international \r\ninspection and verification regime of the Agency.\r\nIn closing, we would like to stress that Libya is \r\neager to promote and support a cooperative partnership \r\nwith the IAEA in a transparent manner. We are willing \r\nto provide all assistance necessary to IAEA inspectors \r\nto fulfil their functions in Libya as appropriate.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on this item. \r\nWe shall now proceed to consider draft \r\nresolution A/67/L.3. Before giving the f loor to speakers \r\nin explanation of vote or position, may I remind \r\ndelegations that explanations of vote are limited to 10 \r\nminutes and should be made by delegations from their \r\nseats.\r\nMr. Ri Tong Il (Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea): Regarding the report under discussion (see \r\nA/67/152) and the related draft resolution (A/67/L.3), \r\nmy country’s delegation considers the report to be far \r\nfrom correct or true and believes that it fails to cover the \r\nfundamental reality of the nuclear issue on the Korean \r\npeninsula. With regard to that matter, my country’s \r\ndelegation would like to clarify its position. \r\n12-57291 29\r\nA/67/PV.30\r\ntarget on the ground for an air strike exercise involving \r\nlive ammunition. It is clear that the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea is a target to be eliminated by the \r\nUnited States. \r\nIn the face of that threat and in response to such \r\nblackmail from the largest nuclear-weapon State, the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea had no option \r\nbut to go nuclear to defend itself, to safeguard its \r\nsecurity and sovereignty and to safeguard the right to \r\nexistence of the entire Korean nation. Therefore, the \r\nnuclear deterrent of the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea represents the deterrence of war and it is an \r\nalmighty and most treasured sword that can guarantee \r\npeace, stability and security on the Korean peninsula \r\nand in the region. It is therefore in the interests of the \r\nregional countries to move towards peace, development, \r\ndétente and stability. \r\nConcerning the withdrawal of the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea from the NPT and the IAEA, \r\nour objective is to make the United States abandon its \r\nstrong-arm policy and move towards reconciliation and \r\ncoexistence with the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea. As long as that hostile policy continues, the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea will increase, \r\nstrengthen and expand its nuclear capability and its \r\narsenal of nuclear weapons. Therefore, the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea would like to kindly \r\nrecommend that the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency not repeat its issuance of this kind of annual \r\nreport, with its absurd content and language. It will \r\nresult only in tarnishing and destroying its own image. \r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the only \r\nspeaker in explanation of position. \r\nThe Assembly will now take action on draft \r\nresolution A/67/L.3, entitled “Report of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency”. I give the f loor \r\nto the representative of the Secretariat.\r\nMr. Botnaru (Department for General Assembly \r\nand Conference Management): I should like to announce \r\nthat, since the submission of the draft resolution, \r\nin addition to those delegations listed in document \r\nA/67/L.3, the following countries have become \r\nsponsors of the draft resolution: Albania, Argentina, \r\nArmenia, Australia, Austria, Bangladesh, Belarus, \r\nBenin, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Bulgaria, \r\nBurundi, Cameroon, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech \r\nRepublic, Egypt, Estonia, Ethiopia, Finland, Georgia, \r\nGermany, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Iraq, \r\nAgency’s so-called readiness to resume its involvement \r\nin verification activities.\r\nAll of that is absurd and makes no sense in the \r\ncontext of what I have just said. \r\nOn this occasion, the delegation of the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea would like to draw the \r\nattention of all participants here to the different \r\nstatus of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. \r\nThe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, as \r\neverybody knows, has emerged as a full-f ledged and \r\njustifiable nuclear-weapon State. It is clear that the \r\nIAEA cannot and should not use the same standard \r\nit was using when the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea’s nuclear activities were limited to peaceful \r\npurposes. The function of the IAEA is to deal mainly \r\nwith non-nuclear-weapon States and the case of the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea is different, as \r\nclearly observed in the IAEA’s previous approach. The \r\nAgency has never raised an issue or expressed concern \r\nabout the nuclear activities of the other nuclear-weapon \r\nStates; it has done so only with regard to the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea. That does not make sense; \r\nit is absurd and yet another instance of the Agency’s \r\ndiminishing impartiality in its activities. \r\nSecondly, the IAEA cannot and is not in a position \r\nto offer a helping hand in the settlement of the nuclear \r\nissue of the Korean peninsula. The resolution of all such \r\nissues should be based on an objective analysis of the \r\nfundamental current reality behind those issues. With \r\nregard to the fundamental essence of the nuclear issue \r\nof the Korean peninsula, it is absolutely the product \r\nof the hostile, deeply rooted and long-standing policy \r\nof the United States against the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea. Moreover, the United States did \r\nnot hesitate to list the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea as part of the axis of evil and as a first nuclear \r\npre-emptive strike target by the United States. \r\nFurthermore, when one considers the United States \r\nmilitary activities in South Korea this year, its holding \r\nof one large-scale exercise after another, involving \r\nup to 500,000 troops, is unprecedented. The United \r\nStates is more than ready to attack the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea at any time. Another joint \r\nmilitary exercise is now under way, involving over \r\n200,000 troops of the United States and South Korea. \r\nAs representatives can imagine, they are using live \r\nammunition. In an exercise this summer, they used \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s f lag as a \r\n30 12-57291\r\nA/67/PV.30\r\nmilitarism without expressing any apology for its past \r\ncrimes, including crimes against humanity, of which \r\nwe are all aware.\r\nConcerning the remarks made by the representative \r\nof South Korea, again, the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea cannot have the status of nuclear-\r\nweapon State. The Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea has never requested such status. It is up to us \r\nwhether we do so or not; it is our right in response to the \r\nthreat. And South Korea has allowed American nuclear \r\nweapons into South Korea since 1957, blackmailing the \r\nentire Korean nation. They cannot hide or cast aside \r\nthis fact. Moreover, South Korea is still under the \r\nnuclear umbrella of the United States.\r\nMr. Kodama (Japan): I would like to exercise my \r\nright of reply in response to the statement just made by \r\nthe representative of the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea. \r\nFirst, the Government of Japan’s adherence to \r\nthe three non-nuclear principles — not possessing, \r\nmanufacturing or permitting the introduction of nuclear \r\nweapons into our territory — remains unchanged, and \r\nJapan’s determination in pursuit of the total elimination \r\nof nuclear weapons with a view to achieving a world \r\nwithout nuclear weapons is unshakable.\r\nSecondly, Japan maintains an exclusively \r\ndefence-oriented policy, and therefore exercises \r\nconducted by the Self-Defence Forces of Japan do not \r\ntarget any particular country or area. Moreover, the \r\nballistic missile defence system that Japan has decided \r\nto introduce is purely defensive and does not threaten \r\nany country or area surrounding Japan.\r\nThirdly, it is not a fact that the Government of Japan \r\nhas ever allowed the introduction of nuclear weapons \r\nby the United States onto Japanese territory. Based \r\non the United States nuclear policy expressed to date, \r\nincluding the 1991 announcement, it is the judgement \r\nof the Japanese Government that there is currently no \r\nintroduction of nuclear weapons by the United States, \r\nincluding via vessels and/or aircraft calling at port in, \r\nlanding on or transiting Japanese territories. I reiterate \r\nthat the Japan continues to maintain the policy of \r\nadhering to the three non-nuclear principles.\r\nLastly, Japan has acted in strict compliance with \r\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \r\n(NPT) and its International Atomic Energy Agency \r\nsafeguards obligations as an NPT State party. Japan’s \r\nIreland, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, \r\nMontenegro, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Paraguay, \r\nPeru, the Philippines, Poland, the Republic of Korea, \r\nthe Republic of Moldova, Romania, the Russian \r\nFederation, San Marino, Serbia, Singapore, Spain, \r\nSweden, Thailand, the former Yugoslav Republic of \r\nMacedonia, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Ukraine, the \r\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, \r\nUruguay and Zambia. \r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\ntake a decision on draft resolution A/67/L.3. May I \r\ntake it that the Assembly decides to adopt the draft \r\nresolution?\r\nDraft resolution A/67/L.3 was adopted \r\n(resolution 67/3).\r\nThe Acting President: I shall now call on those \r\nrepresentatives who wish to speak in exercise of the \r\nright of reply. May I remind members that statements \r\nin the exercise of the right of reply are limited to 10 \r\nminutes for the first intervention and to five minutes \r\nfor the second intervention, and should be made by \r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Ri Tong Il (Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea): Concerning the remarks made by the \r\nrepresentatives of Japan and South Korea, the delegation \r\nof the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea would \r\nlike to exercise its right of reply.\r\nFirst, concerning the statement made by the \r\nrepresentative of Japan that the nuclear weapons of the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea are a threat \r\nto East Asia, we totally reject this allegation, as it \r\nmakes no sense at all in the context of the fundamental \r\nreality of the Korean peninsula for the reasons I have \r\njust elaborated upon. But one thing is clear. When we \r\nconsider who is the source of the threat in the region, it \r\nis none other than Japan. Japan has nuclear capabilities. \r\nIt has over 40 tons of plutonium. It is a plutonium world \r\nchampion. It is acknowledged that Japan can assemble \r\nnuclear weapons at short notice, even within only a few \r\nhours’ time.\r\nJapan has a secret nuclear agreement with the \r\nUnited States, adopted in 1960, under which it allows \r\nnuclear-weapon-capable American warships to enter \r\nits territorial waters at any time. Japan continues to \r\ntell the world that it has three non-nuclear principles, \r\nwhich are not legalized but are only oral. In reality, it \r\nis doing something quite different; it is moving towards \r\n12-57291 31\r\nA/67/PV.30\r\ndisputes with all neighbouring countries, including \r\non the Korean peninsula, China and Russia. Japan is \r\nmaking territorial claims that are utterly unfounded \r\nand aimed purely at promoting the expansionist and \r\nmilitaristic interests of Japan.\r\nMr. Kodama (Japan): I have no intention of \r\nrepeating the statement I made earlier to refute \r\nthe allegations made by the representative of the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea. With respect \r\nto other groundless allegations made by the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea delegation against Japan, I \r\nwould rather my delegation reserve its right of reply \r\nuntil an appropriate opportunity arrives in due course.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is \r\nthe wish of the General Assembly to conclude its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 85? \r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.30 p.m.\r\npeaceful uses of nuclear energy have been confirmed \r\nby the IAEA in its annual conclusions that all nuclear \r\nmaterials remain in peaceful activities. Moreover, \r\nbeyond legal obligations, as a measure of international \r\ntransparency Japan has regularly reported the amount \r\nof its plutonium holdings in accordance with the \r\nguidelines for the management of plutonium, most \r\nrecently on 17 September.\r\nMr. Ri Tong Il (Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea): Concerning the remarks made by the \r\nrepresentative of Japan, once again the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea totally rejects this allegation. \r\nAll that has been said is simply political cover-up. It \r\nis a fact that in 1960 Japan concluded a secret nuclear \r\nagreement with the United States that goes against the \r\nthree non-nuclear principles, which are themselves \r\ncontained in no legal or legitimate document. If Japan is \r\nserious about its non-nuclear position, then why should \r\nit hesitate to adopt a legitimate document?\r\nLastly, Japan is pursuing militarization, seeking \r\nto become a military Power. It is creating territorial \r\n"
