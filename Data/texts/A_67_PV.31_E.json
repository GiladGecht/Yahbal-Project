Costa Rica attaches great importance to \r\nthe International Court of Justice. In keeping with that \r\nrespect, we have recognized the Court’s compulsory \r\njurisdiction since 1973.\r\nThe peaceful settlement of international disputes \r\nis one of the principal reasons for being of the United \r\nNations. As the sole international court with global \r\njurisdiction and one of the principal organs of the United \r\nNations, the Court, in its work to settle such disputes, is \r\na fundamental tool for the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security. It is therefore the responsibility of \r\nthe United Nations and its States Members to support \r\nthe Court in its work. To deliver that support, the United \r\nNations must provide the Court sufficient resources for \r\nit to process the cases brought before it effectively and \r\nwith complete procedural and juridical independence. \r\nWe are pleased that the Organization’s support and \r\nthe Court’s diligent efforts have succeeded in clearing \r\nthe accumulated backlog in cases to be heard, and that \r\nnow that the written phase of processing cases has been \r\nconcluded we may now move on expeditiously to the \r\noral phase.\r\nStill more important in the cause of strengthening \r\nthe rule of law and the Court itself is for all States \r\nwithout exception to respect its rulings and provisional \r\nmeasures. Such a categorical, good-faith respect \r\nis essential to ensuring the integrity of cases and \r\nsolidifying the key role of the Court in maintaining \r\njustice and peace.\r\nAlong those lines, Costa Rica welcomes the fact \r\nthat the Declaration of the High-level Meeting on the \r\nRule of Law at the National and International Levels \r\n(resolution 67/1), held on 24 September, underlined both \r\nthe importance of the Court and the absolute necessity \r\nof abiding by its decisions.\r\nLastly, I want to congratulate Judges Owada, \r\nTomka and Xue on their re-election, as well as Judge \r\nGaja on his election. We commend the Court for its \r\nefficient and transparent work, and we reiterate our full \r\nconfidence in its continuing efforts to bolster peace and \r\njustice in carrying out its duties.\r\nUnited Nations A/67/PV.31\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-seventh session\r\n31st plenary meeting\r\nTuesday, 6 November 2012, 10 a.m.\r\nNew York\r\nOffi cial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Jeremić  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Serbia)\r\n2 12-57486\r\nA/67/PV.31\r\nMr. Panin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): \r\nWe would like to thank the President of the International \r\nCourt of Justice, Mr. Peter Tomka, for his briefing.\r\nThe Organization’s calendar year began with the \r\nholding of the landmark High-level Meeting on the \r\nRule of Law at the National and International Levels, \r\nheld on 24 September. That was a complex event whose \r\noutcome, which garnered conflicting assessments \r\nfrom States, will be discussed for a long time to come. \r\nBe that as it may, the International Court of Justice \r\nhas proved to be one of those rare cases about which \r\nStates were unanimous during the High-level Meeting \r\nin giving positive assessments. In that connection, I \r\ncannot fail to say a few words about the significance of \r\nthe Court, not only as a key body in resolving disputes \r\nbetween States but as a body that plays a special role in \r\nstrengthening the rule of law in international relations. \r\nAs is rightly noted in the report of the Court \r\n(A/67/4), all the work of that organ is aimed at promoting \r\nthe rule of law. Today the Court not only settles land \r\nand maritime border disputes between neighbouring \r\nStates — as it primarily did during the early period \r\nof its existence — but its caseload also includes \r\ninternational concerns spanning a range of issues \r\nfrom States’ jurisdictional immunity to questions of \r\nterritorial integrity. In adjudicating such complicated \r\ninternational issues, the Court is creating international \r\nlaw and actively furthering its broader recognition and \r\ndissemination.\r\nToday the International Court of Justice’s work is \r\nin one of the most active phases in its history. It has \r\nconsidered 15 contentious cases and one adviosry \r\nprocedure. It has produced decisions on some very \r\ncomplex issues, the most interesting of which are \r\nthe judgements in the case concerning Jurisdictional \r\nImmunities of the State (Germany v. Italy: Greece \r\nintervening), in which the Court affirmed the \r\nextraordinarily important principle of the supremacy of \r\nthe jurisdictional immunity of sovereign States, and the \r\ncase concerning Questions relating to the Obligation to \r\nProsecute or Extradite (Belgium v. Senegal), in which \r\nthe prosecute-or-extradite principle was powerfully \r\nelaborated.\r\nNoting the steady upward trend in the Court’s \r\ncaseload and the momentum of its proceedings, we \r\nwelcome the efforts of its leaders aimed at optimizing \r\nits legal processes. The simultaneous consideration of \r\ncases, the great pace of proceedings in the chambers, the \r\nregular updating of practical procedures and working \r\nmethods, the speedier consideration of incidental \r\ncases relating to provisional measures, applications \r\nfor permission to intervene and other measures — all \r\nof that has enabled the Court to speed up its ability \r\nto deliver judgements without hindering their quality. \r\nThat modernization of the chief judicial body of the \r\nUnited Nations also changes the attitude that States \r\nhave to it. It is evident that in the eyes of States the \r\nCourt is gradually becoming more modern and is seen \r\nas the proper body for settling international disputes.\r\nWhen it comes to strengthening the rule of law \r\nit is precisely such genuinely functioning bodies as \r\nthe International Court of justice, with its universal \r\nrecognition and the trust of States, that should be \r\nstrengthened and supported; we should not try to \r\nintroduce a proliferation of new, dubious bodies \r\nwith unclear status and confused mandates. In that \r\nconnection, we are pleased that in the budget period \r\nunder review we have been able to resolve various \r\nfinancial and staffing problems for the Court. We \r\nbelieve that the issues of providing additional funding \r\nfor the Court, modernizing its legal processes and \r\nsupporting its judges’ special status should be settled \r\nwithout delay. For our part, we are prepared to make \r\nevery effort necessary to achieving that goal.\r\nWe are convinced that the International Court \r\nof Justice will remain a model of an objective and \r\nindependent international judiciary whose authoritative \r\nopinion on the most complex issues will always help to \r\nstrengthen international law.\r\nMrs. Martínez Lievano (Mexico) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): The delegation of Mexico would like to \r\nexpress its deep appreciation to the International \r\nCourt of Justice for the hard work accomplished this \r\nyear. We also thank the Court’s President, Judge Peter \r\nTomka, who a few days ago (see A/67/PV.29) presented \r\na report (A/67/4) that gives a clear picture of the \r\ndisputes currently before the Court and demonstrates \r\nits universal nature.\r\nWe would also like to congratulate Judge Tomka and \r\nJudge Bernardo Sepúlveda-Amor on their respective \r\nelections as President and Vice-President of the Court. \r\nThe election of Judge Sepúlveda-Amor, a distinguished \r\nMexican jurist, makes us proud. Mexico would also like \r\nto express its appreciation to the Registrar of the Court, \r\nMr. Philippe Couvreur, for his excellent performance.\r\nIn this brief statement, Mexico wishes to highlight \r\nthe great legal value of the Court’s decisions, both \r\n12-57486 3\r\nA/67/PV.31\r\nfor the parties concerned in the disputes and for the \r\ninternational community as a whole. The Court plays \r\nan essential role in the development of international \r\nlaw, particularly in leading a dialogue with other \r\njurisdictional bodies, thus enriching international \r\nlaw and preventing its fragmentation. In that regard, \r\nwe deem particularly relevant the recent judgements \r\nin which the Court cited precedents derived from \r\nother tribunals’ jurisdiction, such as the International \r\nTribunal for the Law of the Sea and the European and \r\nInter-American Courts of Human Rights.\r\nOur delegation would also like to call on the \r\nGeneral Assembly to provide the Court with the means \r\nnecessary for its optimal performance as the principal \r\njudicial organ of the United Nations.\r\nFinally, I would like to recall that the Declaration \r\nadopted at the High-level Meeting on the Rule of \r\nLaw at the National and International Levels in \r\nSeptember (resolution 67/1) is a clear demonstration \r\nof the international community’s commitment to \r\nstrengthening international law and one that recognizes \r\nthe important contribution of the International Court of \r\nJustice to strengthening the rule of law. In that context, \r\nwe call on States that have not yet done so to accept the \r\nCourt’s jurisdiction.\r\nMr. Errázuriz (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): Allow me \r\nto convey my delegation’s greetings to the President of \r\nthe International Court of Justice, Judge Peter Tomka, \r\nwho presented a comprehensive report covering the \r\nperiod from 1 August 2011 to 31 July 2012 (A/67/4).\r\nWe value the great responsibility of the International \r\nCourt of Justice and its work as the principal judicial \r\norgan of the United Nations. The President’s report \r\nclearly reflects that tradition and deserves our gratitude. \r\nWe are members of the international community and we \r\nshare with it the respect for the Court’s institutionality, \r\nits mission and its work, which reflects the primacy \r\nof international law. We join with those who have \r\nhighlighted the fundamental task as a consultative body \r\nthat the Charter of the United Nations has entrusted \r\nto the Court, a function that it has discharged with \r\nexemplary clarity and commitment, bringing, through \r\nits decisions, security and stability to the Organization \r\nand to States as whole.\r\nWe note in particular the contribution the Court \r\nmakes to relations between States on the basis of \r\nthe application of international law and by adding \r\nto its effectiveness. The Court is an essential part of \r\nthe international legal system. States recognize and \r\nappreciate its leading role and the assurances it provides \r\nto all the members of the international community \r\nwithin its purview.\r\nAs the President pointed out, the Court’s purview \r\nis based on multilateral and bilateral treaties and on \r\nStates’ unilateral declarations, all of it in accordance \r\nwith the system as laid down in the Rome Statute. The \r\nCourt’s judicial resolution of disputes embodies one \r\nof the essential goals of the international legal order \r\nconcerning the stability of relations between States \r\nand guarantees of existing standards. We are convinced \r\nthat, in the framework of international peace and \r\nsecurity, the Court contributes to strengthening relations \r\nbetween States and to establishing an international legal \r\norder that respects the law, together with the rule of law \r\nand respect for human rights, adapting the fundamental \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations to the \r\nrequirements of contemporary life. \r\nWe join the General Assembly, as the principal \r\nlegal organ of the system, in expressing our respect and \r\nsupport for the Court. We trust that the Organization \r\nwill continue to ensure the Court’s autonomy and to \r\nprovide the necessary human and material resources, \r\nas required for its legal duties and important functions. \r\nMy country greatly appreciates the dissemination \r\nof public information that the Court undertakes with \r\nregard to its work and its outreach with regard to its \r\nteachings and activities. We hope that resources will be \r\nmade available to continue in that direction, providing \r\nthe Court with the means and technological resources \r\nfor that purpose. We know how much the Court is \r\ndoing to disseminate information about its work and to \r\nsupport the efforts of those who consult its documents. \r\nThat effort will surely ensure that international law is \r\nenforced. We want to make our contribution to ensuring \r\nthat will always be the case when it comes to relations \r\namong States.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to say that we recognize \r\nthe valuable work of the Court that Judge Tomka \r\npresides over, which aligns itself with the observance \r\nof international law as a requirement and sentiment, \r\ncontributing to its effectiveness and its implementation.\r\nMr. Tladi (South Africa): Allow me to congratulate \r\nJudge Peter Tomka on his election as President of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, as well as to thank \r\nhim for his statement made last Thursday (see A/67/\r\nPV.29). I also thank the Court for its report (A/67/4). In \r\n4 12-57486\r\nA/67/PV.31\r\naddition, I wish to thank all the members of the Court \r\nfor their work over the reporting period. And I wish \r\nto congratulate the new members of the Court, Judges \r\nSebutinde, Gaja and Bhandari, on their first-time \r\nelection to the Court. I also extend our congratulations \r\nto Judges Owada, Tomka and Xue Hanqin on their \r\nre-election.\r\nThis year, the focus of the United Nations has been \r\non rule-of-law issues. In January, during South Africa’s \r\npresidency of the Security Council, the Council held a \r\ndebate at which it adopted a presidential statement on \r\nthe rule of law (S/PRST/2012/1). Only two weeks ago, \r\nthe Council also held a debate on the rule of law focused \r\non the relationship between the International Criminal \r\nCourt and the Security Council (see S/PV.6849). On \r\n24 September, the General Assembly held a High-\r\nlevel Meeting on the Rule of Law at the National and \r\nInternational Levels, at which a Declaration was adopted \r\nby heads of State and Government (resolution 67/1).\r\nAn important focus of those United Nations \r\nrule-of-law-related activities has been the work of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, the principal judicial \r\norgan of the United Nations. South Africa’s own \r\nparticipation in the activities has been to highlight \r\nthe important and critical role that the Court can play \r\nin the promotion of the rule of law and in advancing \r\nthe principles and purposes of the United Nations \r\nby providing a forum for the peaceful settlement of \r\ndisputes. In that regard, the Declaration of the High-\r\nlevel Meeting recognizes the positive contribution of \r\nthe Court to the adjudication of disputes and to the \r\npromotion of the rule of law. Similarly, in its presidential \r\nstatement, the Security Council emphasized the key \r\nrole of the Court in adjudicating disputes and the value \r\nof its work in the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security.\r\nThe promotion of the rule of law, which is \r\nindispensable for durable peace and security, cannot \r\nf lourish in a world in which all States have a near \r\nlimitless right to interpret international law as they deem \r\nfit. My delegation has, countless times, stressed the \r\nneed to avoid auto-interpretation and auto-application \r\nof international law. In that regard, the Court can \r\nplay an important role in being the final arbiter on the \r\ncontent of international law.\r\nAs we all know, the Court plays its important role \r\nnot only in the context of the settlement of disputes in \r\ncases brought by States, but also through the provision \r\nof advisory opinions. We are therefore pleased that, \r\nover the years, the Court has had an opportunity to \r\nclarify a number of important legal principles relevant \r\nto the work of the United Nations, including through \r\nits advisory opinion on the Legal consequences of \r\nthe construction of a wall in the occupied Palestinian \r\nterritory (see A/ES-10/273) and many other advisory \r\nopinions. In that regard, I refer to advisory opinions to \r\nstress that South Africa will, as appropriate, support \r\nthe referral of questions of law to the International \r\nCourt of Justice for such opinions.\r\nTurning to the current work of the Court during the \r\nreporting period, we are pleased to see that the Court \r\nwas very active and productive, holding three hearings, \r\ndelivering an advisory opinion and handing down four \r\njudgements, including one or two much-anticipated \r\nones. While we do not wish to pronounce ourselves on \r\njudgements made by the Court, we would like to make \r\nsome observations on the importance of some of those \r\ncases for the development of a rich body of law.\r\nWhile the Court’s judgement in the case Questions \r\nrelating to the Obligation to Prosecute or Extradite \r\n(Belgium v. Senegal) was restricted to the obligation \r\nas contained in article 7 of the Convention against \r\nTorture, we note that the formulation of the aut dedere \r\naut judicare principle in the Convention closely follows \r\nthe trend reflected in The Hague Convention for the \r\nSuppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft, namely, \r\nthat the custodial State shall, if it does not extradite the \r\nindividual in question, be obliged, without exception, \r\nto submit the case to its authority — a trend followed \r\nin the more recent articulation of the principle and, \r\nindeed, a point that is alluded to in paragraph 90 of the \r\njudgement of the Court and more elaborately canvassed \r\nin the separate opinion of Judge Yusuf. We are pleased \r\nthat the Court has clarified the nature of the obligation, \r\nwhich is something that has been the subject of much \r\ndiscussion, by holding that the primary obligation \r\nimplied by aut dedere principle is the obligation to \r\nprosecute, while extradition is an option offered to a \r\nState by the Convention.\r\nThe Court’s judgement in the case Questions \r\nrelating to the Obligation to Prosecute or Extradite \r\n(Belgium v. Senegal) was also insightful in its conclusion \r\nthat the prohibition against torture was a peremptory \r\nnorm of international law — ius cogens. While the \r\nCourt’s judgement is not definitive, the Court seems to \r\nbe suggesting that the fact that the prohibition against \r\ntorture is ius cogens does not, in and of itself, activate \r\nthe aut dedere aut judicare obligation. \r\n12-57486 5\r\nA/67/PV.31\r\nThe question of the legal consequences, or perhaps \r\nimplication, of ius cogens norms is another question \r\nof importance in contemporary international law that \r\naffects such important topics as immunities, and even \r\nuniversal jurisdiction. We have noted that the Court, in \r\nparagraph 93 of its judgement in the case Jurisdictional \r\nImmunities of the State (Germany v. Italy: Greece \r\nintervening) addresses that question by noting the \r\ndifferences between procedural norms and substantive \r\nnorms. That view can be contrasted with Judge Cançado \r\nTrindade’s dissenting opinion, as well as the joint separate \r\nopinion of Judges Higgins, Kooijmans and Buergenthal, \r\nin the case Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000 \r\n(Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Belgium). \r\nIndeed, in the case Questions relating to the Obligation \r\nto Prosecute or Extradite (Belgium v. Senegal), \r\nJudge Cançado Trindade expressed the view that the \r\narticulation of a norm as ius cogens had the effect of \r\ncreating an obligation of result, and not just one of \r\nconduct.\r\nMoreover, while the separate opinion of Judge \r\nBennounna and the dissenting opinions of Judges \r\nYusuf and Gaja do not directly address the question \r\nof the interaction between ius cogens and other norms \r\nof international law, the sentiments expressed therein \r\nabout the interaction of norms of international law \r\nappear more in tune with Judge Higgins, Kooijmans \r\nand Buergenthal’s separate opinion and Judge Cançado \r\nTrindade’s separate opinion with respect to ius cogens \r\nand its relationship with other norms.\r\nHow does the latter approach, which is intuitively \r\nattractive, compare with the Court’s treatment of the \r\nrelationship between substantive and procedural norms \r\nin the context of ius cogens? We are hopeful that, over \r\nthe coming years, the various judgements and opinions \r\nof the Court will contribute to a thorough examination \r\nof those and other issues of importance to international \r\nlaw.\r\nThe richness of the judgements of the Court, as \r\nwell as the individual opinions of the members of the \r\nCourt, are proof of the contribution, recognized in the \r\nhigh-level Declaration, that the Court has made to the \r\nrule of law.\r\nAllow us, finally to congratulate the Court on \r\nthe renovation of the Great Hall of Justice, which we \r\nare sure will continue to serve as the monument of \r\ninternational justice.\r\nMr. Llorentty Solíz (Plurinational State of Bolivia) \r\n(spoke in Spanish): On behalf of the Plurinational State \r\nof Bolivia, I would like to express our gratitude for \r\nthe excellent report presented by the President of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, Judge Peter Tomka \r\n(A/67/4), which covers the Court’s work from 1 August \r\n2011 to 31 July 2012. \r\nIn the International Court of Justice the United \r\nNations has the principal reference for what the \r\ninternational community considers to be universal \r\njustice. Its main contribution is its function as a \r\nmechanism for the peaceful, fair and legal settlement \r\nof disputes — a civilized way of handling disputes \r\nbetween States. Progress in international law has made \r\nit possible to reject outdated practices such as the \r\nunilateral imposition of measures by strong States on \r\nweaker ones, as well as to prohibit the threat or use \r\nof force and the conquest of territory by neighbouring \r\nStates. The International Court of Justice, as the \r\nmain judicial body of the United Nations, clearly acts \r\nas guarantor, protecting States threatened by such \r\ncontentious practices. In that context, it is important \r\nto highlight the United Nations resolutions that \r\ncrystallize those principles of international law, which \r\nin turn form the foundations of the Court’s rulings. It \r\nis precisely for that reason that Bolivia reiterates its \r\nsupport for the Manila Declaration on the Peaceful \r\nSettlement of International Disputes (resolution 37/10, \r\nannex), adopted on 15 November 1982. In Section II, \r\nparagraph 5, the Declaration states that:\r\n“Recourse to judicial settlement of legal disputes, \r\nparticularly referral to the International Court of \r\nJustice, should not be considered an unfriendly act \r\nbetween States.”\r\nThere has been a healthy trend in the conduct \r\nof States towards submitting their disputes to the \r\nCourt’s jurisdiction. Members of the international \r\ncommunity have gone even further, not only working \r\nto resolve differences peacefully but even seeking \r\nthrough peaceful settlements to improve relationships \r\nof friendship, political relations and trade links, in the \r\nspirit of the Manila Declaration. \r\nBolivia agrees with the opinion voiced by \r\nother delegations during the general debate of this \r\nsixty-seventh session to heed the wise call by the \r\nPresident of the Assembly to seek to bring about the \r\nsettlement of international disputes or situations by \r\npeaceful means. The Court’s most prominent work \r\n6 12-57486\r\nA/67/PV.31\r\nwas also highlighted during the recently held High-\r\nlevel Meeting on the Rule of Law at the National \r\nand International Levels. The Declaration adopted at \r\nthe Meeting (resolution 67/1) recognized the positive \r\ncontribution made by the International Court of Justice \r\nand reaffirmed the obligation of States to respect and \r\ncomply with the judgements and rulings of the Court.\r\nThe vast majority of the members of the international \r\ncommunity ardently desire that the mechanism for \r\nthe judicial settlement of disputes — which the \r\nInternational Court of Justice has the responsibility to \r\nimplement — be universally accepted, with ever more \r\nStates recognizing its jurisdiction and honouring its \r\nfundamental role in maintaining international peace. \r\nIn that connection, we call on States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations to recognize the Court’s jurisdiction \r\nand to see its judgements as a reaffirmation of the \r\nprimacy of international law.\r\nMr. Sarki (Nigeria): My delegation would first \r\nof all like to congratulate Judge Peter Tomka on his \r\nwell-deserved election as President of the International \r\nCourt of Justice. We also congratulate the new judges \r\non their elections to the Court.\r\nWe welcome the report of the International Court \r\nof Justice (A/67/4), which contains a comprehensive \r\npresentation on the activities of the Court during the \r\nperiod under review. The dual role of the Court as the \r\nprincipal judicial organ of the United Nations and a \r\ncourt of unique and universal jurisdiction enables it to \r\nrender impartial decisions in the peaceful settlement of \r\ndisputes. Over the years, the Court has not only served \r\nin advancing international peace and security through \r\nits rulings and judicial notices but also contributed \r\nimmensely to the corpus of international jurisprudence. \r\nThe Court’s judgements and advice invariably have \r\nhad salutary effects on the maintenance of peace and \r\nsecurity in all regions.\r\nIn that connection, we note the contribution of the \r\nCourt towards the delineation of land and maritime \r\nborders between Nigeria and the Republic of Cameroon, \r\nwhich contributed significantly to the peaceful \r\nresolution of the problem. On 10 October 2002, the \r\nCourt ruled on the ceding of the Bakassi Peninsula to \r\nthe Republic of Cameroon after Nigeria submitted to the \r\nCourt’s jurisdiction. That marked a significant turning \r\npoint in the history of Nigeria. In the period since, \r\nNigeria has not only maintained its utmost respect for \r\nthe rule of law by implementing the decision in full but \r\nhas also adhered to its international commitment to \r\nrespect its neighbour’s borders and territorial integrity, \r\nin the interest of promoting international peace and \r\nsecurity.\r\nNigeria has always chosen the path of dialogue \r\nand negotiations in the settlement of regional and \r\ninternational disputes. We firmly believe that other \r\nStates should do likewise. Nigeria also faithfully \r\npursued the implementation of the Green Tree \r\nAgreement, including the dismantling of all its civil and \r\nmilitary structures in territories ceded to Cameroon. It \r\nis our hope that vestiges of problems, especially those \r\nrelated to the resettlement of displaced communities \r\nand human rights and humanitarian concerns, will \r\nbe addressed constructively in the coming weeks and \r\nmonths, in order lay to rest the outstanding issues \r\nbetween our two countries.\r\nDespite such successes, we note that things have \r\nnot always progressed satisfactorily in relation to the \r\nCourt’s activities. Last year, for instance, we witnessed \r\nseveral contentious cases that came before the Court, \r\ncutting across all stratums, such as territorial and \r\nmaritime delimitation, violations of territorial integrity, \r\nracial discrimination, violations of human rights and \r\nthe interpretation and application of international \r\nconventions and treaties, among others. In spite of the \r\nchallenges, we commend the Court’s discharge of its \r\nresponsibilities in the delivery of judgments — six \r\norders and public hearings in five contentious cases \r\nduring the period were delivered. We also note the \r\ninitiation of two new cases before the Court and a \r\nrequest for an advisory opinion, which we are confident \r\nwill be delivered with competence, professionalism and \r\nobjectivity.\r\nThe revitalization of the procedures and working \r\nmethods of the Court over the years has ensured that \r\nit operates with the maximum level of efficiency and \r\ntransparency. The initiatives and innovations that \r\nwere introduced by the Court that led to the successful \r\nelimination of its backlog of cases and improved the \r\nmanagement of both its human and material resources \r\nmust be commended. \r\nIn the face of heightened security challenges, \r\nespecially those posed by global terrorism, my delegation \r\nsupports the  notion that there is a need for the General \r\nAssembly to approve, within its resource capacity, the \r\nallocation of additional funds for the Court to establish \r\na security assistant post, so as to strengthen the existing \r\nsecurity team while improving other security sectors. \r\nIn addition, we support the appointment of more legal \r\n12-57486 7\r\nA/67/PV.31\r\nofficers to handle the increasing number of cases \r\nreferred to the Court. We note the need to adequately \r\naddress the myriad administrative requests through \r\nproper budgeting.\r\nNigeria reiterates that the recourse to the Charter \r\nprovision on the peaceful settlement of disputes \r\nand embracing the jurisdictional authority of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, including referrals to \r\nthe Court for advisory opinions, are all strategies in \r\nstrengthening the activities of the United Nations. In \r\nthat respect, the stagnation in the number of States to \r\nhave recognized the compulsory jurisdiction of the \r\nCourt, which remains at 67, with some States having \r\nregistered reservations thereto, after six decades is not \r\nparticularly encouraging. An opportunity to garner \r\nsupport for the Court was presented during this year’s \r\nHigh-level Meeting on the Rule of Law at the National \r\nand International Levels for States that have not made \r\ndeclarations of recognition of the Court to do so. \r\nMost important, in view of the signifi cant role played \r\nby the Court in the consolidation of international law, we \r\nfeel that States that have registered reservations should \r\nbe called upon to withdraw them. The introduction of \r\nvoluntary pledges made during the High-level Meeting \r\nwas aimed at satisfying the need for States to strengthen \r\ntheir resolve to uphold rule-of-law activities at both the \r\nnational and international levels.\r\nMrs. Kazragienė (Lithuania): Allow me to \r\nbegin by thanking Judge Peter Tomka, President of \r\nthe International Court of Justice, for introducing \r\nthe Court’s annual report (A/67/4) last week. As is \r\nevident from the report, the Court made significant \r\nefforts during the reporting period in ensuring both the \r\ncompetence and efficiency in its judicial activities. We \r\nnote with appreciation that, notwithstanding the wide \r\nvariety of legal topics and the growing factual, legal \r\nand procedural complexity, the Court has successfully \r\ncoped with its workload and delivered four important \r\njudgments, as well as handing down an advisory \r\nopinion. Moreover, it managed to clear its backlog of \r\ncases, thus providing room for hearing new cases in a \r\ntimely manner.\r\nThe greater role of the Court is largely dependent \r\non the members of the international community. One of \r\nthe primary features of the domain of international law \r\nin which the Court operates is that it is driven by the \r\nwillingness of States, the main actors of the international \r\ncommunity, and relies upon their voluntary acceptance \r\nof commitments. The same applies to their choice of \r\nmeans for the peaceful settlement of disputes, if the \r\nneed arises. The Court itself is one such means or, as \r\nthe President of the Court put it in his introduction, a \r\nforum of choice.\r\nWe see a great opportunity during the current \r\nsession of the General Assembly to advance reliance on \r\nthe Court. The Court’s fundamental role in maintaining \r\nand strengthening the legitimacy of international \r\nrelations was manifested during both the High-level \r\nMeeting on the Rule of Law and the general debate of \r\nthe General Assembly, as they focused on the themes \r\npertinent to the purpose and activities of the Court. \r\nWe hope that that momentum will continue to build \r\nand translate into more decisive actions. We think that \r\nwill be significant in increasing the importance of \r\ninternational justice.\r\nLithuania is pleased to contribute to the \r\nstrengthening of the role of the Court. During this \r\nyear’s United Nations treaty event, Lithuania deposited \r\nwith the Secretary-General its declaration recognizing \r\nthe jurisdiction of the Court as compulsory under \r\nArticle 36, paragraph 2, of the Statute of the Court, \r\nbringing the total number of States that have done so to \r\n68. Lithuania also deposited instruments of accession \r\nto the Optional Protocols to the Vienna Convention \r\non Diplomatic Relations and the Vienna Convention \r\non Consular Relations concerning the Compulsory \r\nSettlement of Disputes, which were added to the long \r\nlist of treaties in respect to which Lithuania had already \r\nrecognized the Court’s jurisdiction.\r\nThat was a logical step for my country, as it \r\ndovetails with the long-standing legal tradition rooted \r\nin the Permanent Court of International Justice, the \r\njudicial body of the League of Nations. Basing its \r\nstatehood on the right of the self-determination of its \r\npeople, the Lithuanian State had no choice but to follow \r\nthe ideas of the rule of law and the peaceful settlement \r\nof disputes in its international relations. International \r\njustice provided at least titular security guarantees for \r\nthe young nation. Not surprisingly, Lithuania was one \r\nof the first to accept the compulsory jurisdiction of the \r\nPermanent Court when it signed the optional clause of \r\nthe Permanent Court’s Statute in 1922.\r\nThe faith of the Lithuanian Government in reliance \r\non international justice was rewarded in full. The \r\nLithuanian State defended its legitimate place among \r\nindependent nations and successfully stood up for its \r\ninterests in all three cases before the Permanent Court. \r\nThe three cases, all related to different aspects of \r\n8 12-57486\r\nA/67/PV.31\r\naccordance with Article 36 of its Statute. Moreover, \r\nwe welcome the large number of cases submitted to the \r\nCourt, which is proof of the increasing belief around \r\nthe world in the primacy of the law and the importance \r\nStates place on the peaceful settlement of disputes. The \r\ncritically important role of the Court as the principal \r\njudicial organ of the United Nations and the forum for \r\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes is self-evident in the \r\ngrowing trust in the Court by States, which more and \r\nmore submit to the wisdom of the judges. \r\nIn promoting legal solutions to differences and the \r\nrule of law in general the Court both contributes to \r\npeaceful relations among States and fosters respect for \r\nthe rule of law at the international level. Furthermore, \r\nthe Court’s rulings and judgments on various \r\nsituations constitute a body of jurisprudence and legal \r\nreasoning that serves to enrich, codify and standardize \r\ninternational law. \r\nFor the Court to continue to fulfil its noble task, \r\nhowever, it must be provided with adequate means. \r\nThe Court has not been spared the shortages endemic \r\nto international legal mechanisms. Another major \r\nconcern that should always receive our full attention is \r\nthe small number of Member States to have recognized \r\nthe Court’s compulsory jurisdiction. Today, only 66 \r\nStates, accounting for 34 per cent of our membership, \r\nhave done so. That situation undermines the legitimacy \r\nof the Court and the global application of its rulings. In \r\nthat context, we commend and support the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s decision, outlined in his report A/66/749, of \r\n16 March 2012, to launch an international campaign \r\nfor global recognition of the Court’s compulsory \r\njurisdiction. \r\nTo conclude, my delegation would like to underscore \r\nits full support for the International Court of Justice \r\nand to commend its laudable work in promoting the \r\nsettlement of disputes between States by legal and \r\npeaceful means.\r\nMs. Prince (United States of America): We would \r\nlike to thank President Tomka for his leadership as \r\nPresident of the International Court of Justice and for \r\nhis report on its activities (A/67/4), including on the \r\nvery important cases on which the Court rendered \r\ndecisions during the past year. The International Court \r\nof Justice is the principal judicial organ of the United \r\nNations. The Preamble of the Charter of the United \r\nNations underscores the determination of its drafters to \r\nestablish conditions under which justice and respect for \r\nthe obligations arising from treaties and other sources \r\nthe territorial rearrangements that followed the First \r\nWorld War, provide much valuable material for both \r\na historical examination of international relations \r\nin Europe between the two World Wars and a legal \r\nanalysis of the Permanent Court’s judgments, as well as \r\nthe development of international law in general.\r\nNo less important, the recent recognition of the \r\ncompulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of \r\nJustice was a constitutional requirement, as it follows \r\nconstitutional principles of Lithuania that necessitate \r\nrespect for universally recognized principles and norms \r\nof international law and contributing to the creation of \r\nthe international order based on law and justice.\r\nLithuania accepted the compulsory jurisdiction \r\nof the Court September. We invite all States that have \r\nnot yet done so to do so and thereby join the voluntary \r\nsystem of the compulsory settlement of disputes by \r\npeaceful means and in accordance with international \r\nlaw.\r\nMrs. Niang (Senegal) (spoke in French): I would like \r\nat the outset to thank the President of the International \r\nCourt of Justice, Judge Peter Tomka, for his substantive \r\nand comprehensive report on the Court’s work during \r\nthe period under consideration (A/67/4). I would also \r\nlike to thank the entire staff of the Court and to express \r\nmy delegation’s gratitude for the chance to take part \r\nyet again in this annual meeting to consider the Court’s \r\nannual report.\r\nSenegal sees this meeting as an apt occasion to pay \r\nhomage to the Court’s constructive efforts in promoting \r\nthe ideals of peace and justice that lie at the very \r\nfoundation of the United Nations. Promoting respect for \r\nthe rule of law and the peaceful settlements of disputes \r\nis essential to creating a fairer and more peaceful world. \r\nIt is for that reason that, by promoting international \r\njustice, developing international law and safeguarding \r\ninternational peace and security, the International \r\nCourt of Justice has particular responsibility and plays \r\na crucial role in bringing about a peaceful and just \r\nworld. In that context, I would like to recall the words in \r\nArticle 1 of the Charter, which state that the settlement \r\nof disputes “by peaceful means, and in conformity with \r\nthe principles of justice and international law” is one of \r\nthe fundamental goals of the United Nations. \r\nSenegal attaches great importance to promoting \r\njustice and the rule of law. We reiterate the trust \r\nwe place in the Court, as clearly reflected in our \r\nrecognition of the Court’s compulsory jurisdiction, in \r\n12-57486 9\r\nA/67/PV.31\r\nAgenda item 74 (continued)\r\nReport of the International Criminal Court\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/67/308)\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/67/378)\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nobserver of the European Union.\r\nMr. Marhic (European Union): I have the honour \r\nto speak on behalf of the European Union (EU) and \r\nits member States. The acceding country Croatia; the \r\ncandidate countries the former Yugoslav Republic \r\nof Macedonia, Montenegro, Iceland and Serbia; the \r\ncountries of the Stabilization and Association Process \r\nand potential candidates Albania and Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina; as well as Georgia, align themselves with \r\nthis statement.\r\nWe thank the International Criminal Court (ICC) \r\nfor its eighth annual report to the United Nations (see \r\nA/67/308), which covers the period from 1 August \r\n2011 to 31 July 2012. During the reporting period, \r\nCape Verde, Guatemala, Maldives, the Philippines and \r\nVanuatu deposited their instruments of ratification \r\nor accession to the Rome Statute of the International \r\nCriminal Court, bringing the number of States \r\nparties to 121. We welcome the new members. We \r\nalso welcome the announcement made by Haiti in the \r\ncontext of the recently held High-level Meeting of the \r\nGeneral Assembly on the Rule of Law at the National \r\nand International Levels concerning its intention to \r\nratify the Rome Statute. We praise the decision of the \r\nGovernment of Côte d’Ivoire to commit to ratifying the \r\nsame treaty following the reform of its constitutional \r\nframework.\r\nThis year, we celebrate the tenth anniversary of the \r\nentry into force of the Rome Statute. Notwithstanding \r\ndiscussions on what can be done better, the Court is \r\nan unprecedented success. Earlier this year, the Court \r\nissued its first verdict and sentence in the case The \r\nProsecutor v. Thomas Lubanga Dyilo. That judgment \r\nis a milestone for international criminal justice and \r\nconstitutes a significant achievement for the Court. \r\nIt demonstrated that perpetrators cannot act with \r\nimpunity and it raised awareness of the fact that \r\nenlisting and conscripting children under the age of \r\n15 as soldiers and using them to participate actively in \r\ncombat was a war crime. The case also marked the first \r\noccasion for the Court to pronounce itself on principles \r\nand procedures to be applied with regard to reparations.\r\nof international law can be maintained. That goal lies at \r\nthe core of the Charter system, in particular of the role \r\nof the Court. \r\nThe General Assembly itself, in its Declaration of \r\nthe High-level Meeting on the Rule of Law at the National \r\nand International Levels, adopted on 24 September \r\n(resolution 67/1), underscored the positive contribution \r\nof the International Court of Justice, including in \r\nadjudicating disputes among States and the value of its \r\nwork for the promotion of the rule of law. In addition, \r\nthe Security Council, in its presidential statement on \r\nthe rule of law issued earlier this year (S/PRST/2012/1), \r\nsimilarly emphasized the key role of the Court and the \r\nvalue of its work. \r\nIt is against that backdrop that we can see the \r\nreal importance of the renewed willingness of States \r\nover the past two decades to turn to the International \r\nCourt of Justice to resolve their disputes peacefully. \r\nAs President Tomka has noted, just since 1990, the \r\nCourt has more than doubled its rate of decisions. The \r\nincreasing caseload demonstrates the appreciation that \r\nStates, and the international community more broadly, \r\nhave for the value of the Court’s work. It is against \r\nthat backdrop that we can see the real importance of \r\nthe fact that under President Tomka’s leadership the \r\nCourt has been able to clear its backlog of cases and \r\nof the effort of the Court to ensure that States will \r\nbe able to move promptly to the oral stage as soon as \r\nthey complete their written exchanges. Such efforts \r\ncontribute immeasurably to the confidence States can \r\nhave in bringing cases to the Court and, in turn, to the \r\nability of the Court to fulfil its mandate in helping to \r\nensure the peaceful resolution of disputes. \r\nFor its part, the United States applauds such efforts. \r\nIt takes this opportunity to express its pleasure with the \r\nsuccesses of the Court in fulfilling its key role in the \r\nUnited Nations system, together with the other Charter \r\norgans, in the peaceful resolution of disputes between \r\nStates. The United States is pleased to add its voice to \r\nthe many today who have emphasized the success of the \r\nCourt’s work.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on agenda item 71.\r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of the General \r\nAssembly to conclude its consideration of \r\nagenda item 71?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\n10 12-57486\r\nA/67/PV.31\r\nThe recent report by the ICC describes the efforts \r\nthat the Court has made in fulfilling its mission. It also \r\ndescribes the challenges that the ICC is facing. One \r\nmain challenge continues to be the universality of the \r\nRome Statute. The perpetrators of the most serious \r\ncrimes must be made accountable for their actions. We \r\ntherefore need to continue to work tirelessly to make \r\nthe Rome Statute truly universal, as well as to extend \r\nthe Agreement on the Privileges and Immunities of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court. The worst crimes should \r\nnot go unpunished, no matter where or by whom they \r\nare committed.\r\nAnother fundamental challenge remains the \r\nnecessity to ensure cooperation with the Court, and in \r\nparticular how to react to instances of non-cooperation \r\nby States that are in violation of their obligations with \r\nregard to the ICC. Without State cooperation, the ICC \r\ncannot fulfil its mandate. That applies to all States \r\nparties to the Rome Statute, as well as when the Security \r\nCouncil refers a situation to the Court in accordance \r\nwith Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nOf the 23 individuals against whom the ICC \r\ncurrently has open cases, 12 are currently absconding \r\nfrom justice and some have done so for several years. \r\nThat stif les the ICC’s capacity to deliver justice. \r\nNon-cooperation with the Court in respect of the \r\nexecution of arrest warrants constitutes a violation \r\nof international obligations. The EU and its member \r\nStates underline the importance of consistent action to \r\nencourage the full cooperation of States with the ICC, \r\nincluding the prompt execution of arrest warrants.\r\nThe primary responsibility for bringing offenders \r\nto justice lies with States themselves, in conformity \r\nwith the relevant provisions of the Rome Statute. \r\nComplementarity is a core principle in the Rome Statute; \r\nin order to make it operational, all States parties need \r\nto prepare and adopt effective national legislation to \r\nimplement the Rome Statute in their national systems.\r\nThe EU and its member States are firm supporters \r\nof the ICC. In particular, we are committed to \r\ncontinuing to give high priority to the fight against \r\nimpunity in the context of our development cooperation \r\nand technical assistance to partner countries, within \r\nthe broader framework of strengthening the rule of law \r\nand advancing legal and institutional reforms, not least \r\nin post-conflict peacebuilding processes.\r\nWe welcome the actions undertaken by States, \r\ninternational organizations and civil society to increase \r\ntheir cooperation with, and assistance to, the ICC. \r\nOn their part, the European Union and its member \r\nStates undertake to pursue their efforts in the area of \r\ncombating impunity, notably by giving the Court full \r\ndiplomatic support.\r\nOur common goal is clear: to further strengthen \r\nthe Court to fulfil its mandate. We will continue to \r\nencourage the widest possible participation in the Rome \r\nStatute. We are dedicated to preserving the integrity \r\nof the Rome Statute, to supporting the independence \r\nof the Court and to ensuring cooperation with it. We \r\nare also committed to fully implementing the principle \r\nof complementarity, enshrined in the Rome Statute, by \r\nfacilitating the effective and efficient interplay between \r\nnational justice systems and the ICC in the fight against \r\nimpunity.\r\nMr. Charles (Trinidad and Tobago): I have the honour \r\nto make this intervention on behalf of the 14 member \r\nStates of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM).\r\nCARICOM is proud of the strides made by the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC) over the past decade \r\nas the only permanent international criminal tribunal \r\nestablished to prosecute those accused of committing \r\ngrave crimes of concern to the international community.\r\nAs a region, CARICOM is proud of its role in the \r\nestablishment of that important institution, which goes \r\nback to 1989. At that time, many did not share our vision \r\nfor a permanent international court to assist in bringing \r\nto justice the most notorious of international criminals, \r\nas well as to serve as a vehicle to assist in promoting \r\nglobal peace and security. We are humbled that many \r\nnow share that vision.\r\nThe Court is on its way to achieving universality. In \r\na relatively short time, 121 States have become parties \r\nto the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. \r\nThat number includes 11 States parties from within the \r\nCARICOM region.\r\nDespite its detractors, it is difficult to rebut that \r\nthe ICC has lived up to its mandate under the Rome \r\nStatute. It has become a beacon of hope for all those \r\nvictims of heinous crimes who are seeking justice. \r\nThose include innocent children who call for justice for \r\nacts committed by criminals who have shown no regard \r\nfor international humanitarian law and international \r\nhuman rights law.\r\nCARICOM compliments Judge Sang-Hyun Song, \r\nPresident of the ICC, for his address to the General \r\n12-57486 11\r\nA/67/PV.31\r\naddition to the sentencing of Mr. Lubanga Dyilo, \r\nCARICOM also pays tribute to the Court on its \r\nlandmark decision on reparations for victims. That \r\nparticular decision is comprehensive in scope, as it also \r\nestablishes principles relating to reparations.\r\nIt is our hope that in the near future the ICC will be \r\nin a position to commence the trials of other individuals \r\nwho are accused of committing crimes under article 5 \r\nof the Rome Statute. In order to achieve that objective, \r\nhowever, the relevant entities must honour their \r\nlegally binding obligations to execute the outstanding \r\narrest warrants issued by the Court and to arrest and \r\nsurrender to the ICC those individuals who continue to \r\nevade justice. We wish to remind those that have failed \r\nto honour their obligations that they are contributing \r\nto a culture of impunity that does not only prevent the \r\ndispensing of justice, but also serves to undermine the \r\nrule of law.\r\nCooperation with the ICC is at the centre of the \r\nRome Statute. It does not fall only to States parties, \r\nbut also to all States Members of the United Nations, \r\nespecially as it relates to referrals by the Security \r\nCouncil. Those who argue that the ICC is an obstacle to \r\nachieving lasting peace and security in some quarters \r\nmust be reminded that, consistent with the doctrine of \r\ncomplementarity, which is embedded in the Statute, \r\nthe jurisdiction of the ICC is invoked only when States \r\nare unable or unwilling to prosecute those individuals \r\naccused of perpetrating the most severe crimes of \r\nconcern to the global community. In other words, no \r\nindividual or State should fear the ICC, because it is a \r\ncourt of last resort. CARICOM is satisfied that in its 10 \r\nyears of operation the ICC has rosbustly adhered to that \r\ncardinal principle.\r\nThe Declaration (resolution 67/1) adopted at the \r\nHigh-level Meeting of the General Assembly on the \r\nRule of Law at the National and International Levels, \r\nconvened at the General Assembly in September, \r\nrecognized the significant contribution of the ICC to \r\nthe promotion of international justice and the rule of \r\nlaw. CARICOM is hopeful that that recognition will \r\nserve as a catalyst for more States to ratify or accede to \r\nthe Rome Statute, as well as a means for deepening the \r\nrelationship between the United Nations and the ICC.\r\nWith the imminent cessation of operations of \r\nthe ad hoc criminal tribunals, the global community \r\nmust fully embrace the ICC as the only permanent \r\ninternational tribunal dedicated to the prosecution of \r\nall individuals, without distinction as to rank or status, \r\nAssembly (see A/67/PV.29), in keeping with the \r\nRelationship Agreement between the United Nations \r\nand the International Criminal Court (A/58/874, \r\nannex). That Agreement has benefited the international \r\ncommunity in its pursuit of justice for victims of serious \r\ncrimes, which affront all humankind. We also welcome \r\nthe report of the Secretary-General on this important \r\nsubject.\r\nAs a result of the symbiotic relationship that \r\nexists between the United Nations and the ICC, it is \r\nCARICOM’s expectation that long before the ICC \r\ncelebrates its twentieth anniversary, the United Nations \r\nwould honour fully its obligations under Article 115, \r\nparagraph (b) of the Rome Statute to meet the expenses \r\nof the Court associated with referrals by the Security \r\nCouncil. In our view, those expenses should not subsist \r\nsolely on the voluntary contributions of Member States.\r\nOver the past year, the Court witnessed the election \r\nof a new Prosecutor in the person of Ms. Fatou Bensouda. \r\nHer election has demonstrated the importance that States \r\nparties attach to the achievement of gender equality in \r\nthe election and appointment of qualified individuals \r\nto key positions in the ICC. We have full confidence \r\nin the ability of Prosecutor Bensouda to carry out her \r\nduties with the same degree of professionalism and \r\nenthusiasm as her illustrious predecessor, Mr. Luis \r\nMoreno-Ocampo.\r\nCARICOM is also very pleased that the Court \r\ncontinues to uphold democratic traditions as far as the \r\nelection of judges is concerned. That was witnessed \r\nduring the last session of the Assembly of States \r\nParties with the election of six judges, including Judge \r\nAnthony Carmona of Trinidad and Tobago. CARICOM \r\nis indeed honoured that to date it has contributed three \r\nof its nationals to the bench of the ICC.\r\nDuring the last year as well, we observed with \r\ntremendous appreciation the continued work of the \r\nCourt to bring to justice several accused persons in \r\nnumerous situations referred to the institution. Most \r\nimportantly, CARICOM welcomes the verdict rendered \r\non 14 March 2012, in which the ICC found Mr. Thomas \r\nLubanga Dyilo guilty of the enlistment, conscription \r\nand use of children under the age of 15 to participate \r\nactively in hostilities in the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo between September 2002 and August 2003.\r\nWe are further satisfied that at each stage of the \r\nproceedings, the ICC adhered to all of the tenets \r\nassociated with the conduct of an impartial trial. In \r\n12 12-57486\r\nA/67/PV.31\r\ncommitment to ensuring accountability for the worst \r\ncrimes known to humankind.\r\nThe 10-year anniversary of the ICC was celebrated \r\nworldwide, including in the Nordic countries, where its \r\npolitical and popular support remains strong. Although \r\nwe believe that the Court is a success and that it has \r\nlived up to, if not exceeded, the high expectations we \r\nhad 10 years ago, there are, alas, recurring incidents of \r\nStates failing to cooperate with the ICC and increased \r\npressure on the resources available to the Court.\r\nIt is a cause for concern that the number of \r\noutstanding arrest warrants is growing each year. States \r\nparties have a legal obligation under the Rome Statute \r\nto cooperate fully with the Court. Therefore, we urge \r\nall States parties to strengthen their efforts to execute \r\nthe orders of the Court and to abstain from inviting and \r\nreceiving suspects who are subject to an arrest warrant \r\nby the ICC. All States should also fully comply with \r\ntheir obligations under the Charter of the United Nations \r\nand with Security Council resolutions 1593 (2005) and \r\n1970 (2011), which urge States and organizations to \r\nfully cooperate with the ICC in the Darfur and Libya \r\nsituations. We call in particular on  the Sudanese and \r\nLibyan authorities to comply with their respective legal \r\nobligations under those resolutions.\r\nThe crisis this summer when four ICC staff \r\nmembers were detained during a mission conducted in \r\nZintan highlights the importance of the legal protection \r\nof the Court’s staff during travel to situation countries \r\nor elsewhere. On that note, we stress the need for all \r\nStates parties and non-States parties alike that have not \r\nyet done so to ratify and fully observe the Agreement \r\non Privileges and Immunities of the International \r\nCriminal Court as a matter of priority.\r\nThe mandate of the ICC is to hold perpetrators \r\nfor crimes under the Statute to account by exercising \r\ncriminal jurisdiction in fair and efficient trials, with \r\nvictims’ interest duly taken into account. Delivering \r\njustice is a valuable end in itself, but we must not forget \r\nthe broader role of the ICC in fostering the principles of \r\nthe rule of law and respect for universal human rights. \r\nBeing independent does not mean that the Court stands \r\nalone. It should be seen as part of a global system of \r\ngovernance where the United Nations, States and \r\nother relevant organizations work together to close \r\nthe impunity gap for perpetrators under international \r\ncriminal law.\r\nwho commit international crimes that have the potential \r\nto undermine the political and economic order of States.\r\nCARICOM remains committed to the progressive \r\ndevelopment of the relationship between the United \r\nNations and the ICC as part of our overall support for \r\nthe maintenance of an international regime based on \r\nrespect for the inalienable human rights of individuals, \r\nrespect for the territorial integrity of States and the \r\nneed to bring to justice to those who commit serious \r\nbreaches of the provisions of the Rome Statute which, \r\nin our view, represent customary international law.\r\nMs. Burgstaller (Sweden): I have the honour to \r\nspeak on behalf of the five Nordic countries — Denmark, \r\nFinland, Iceland, Norway and my own country, Sweden.\r\nLet me start by thanking the International Criminal \r\nCourt (ICC) for its annual report to the United \r\nNations (see A/67/308). I would also like to thank \r\nJudge Sang-Hyun Song, President of the ICC, for his \r\ncomprehensive presentation elaborating on key issues \r\nin the report. It is evident from the report and President \r\nSong’s introduction that the Court’s activities continue \r\nto increase.\r\nA highlight of the reporting period was the delivery \r\nof the ICC’s first judgment, in March, in the case The \r\nProsecutor v. Thomas Lubanga Dyilo. The verdict was \r\na milestone for international criminal justice and raised \r\nawareness about the plight of child soldiers. It must \r\nserve as an important deterrent against such crimes. \r\nThe Court also took a guiding decision on the principles \r\nfor reparations. The rights of victims to reparations \r\nand to participate in the Court’s proceedings are \r\nunique features of the Rome Statute. Victims’ issues \r\nare a key issue for the Nordic countries, especially for \r\nvictims of the scourge of gender-based violence. We \r\nencourage States to contribute to the ICC’s Trust Fund \r\nfor Victims. Increased resources for the Fund enable us \r\nto make victims’ rights real. Furthermore, we should \r\nconstructively seek justice dividends from the ICC’s \r\nwork that could make a broader positive impact in war-\r\ntorn countries.\r\nThe quest for universal adherence to, and \r\nimplementation of, the Rome Statute continues. We \r\nnote with pleasure that during the reporting period \r\nCape Verde, Guatemala, Maldives, the Philippines \r\nand Vanuatu became States parties, bringing the total \r\nnumber to 121. The Nordic countries warmly welcome \r\nthe five new ICC countries and salute their firm \r\n12-57486 13\r\nA/67/PV.31\r\nThe open debate in the Security Council two weeks ago \r\n(see S/PV.6849) provides ample evidence of that. But \r\nit is nevertheless often not understood that the Rome \r\nStatute does in fact create not just another international \r\ntribunal with a seat in The Hague, but rather a system of \r\naccountability of potentially global reach. That system, \r\nwhich builds on that most basic international consensus \r\nthat we ensure accountability for the most serious \r\ncrimes under international law, will work effectively \r\nonly if all stakeholders play their part. That leads, in \r\nparticular, the following several points.\r\nFirst, all States, whether parties to the Statute \r\nor not, are called upon to help strengthen national \r\njudiciaries in order to enable them to investigate and \r\nprosecute in accordance with international standards. \r\nVery important parts of the United Nations system \r\nand relevant United Nations programmes are already \r\nactive in that area, although, ideally, there should be \r\njust one United Nations department that provides legal \r\nand judicial advice and capacity to any Member State \r\nseeking it, whether a State party or not.\r\nSecondly, complementarity also entails cooperation \r\nwith the ICC, in particular where the Court has \r\njurisdiction and has opened an investigation. A special \r\nsituation in that respect can arise when the State in \r\nquestion is required to cooperate with the Court under \r\nChapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nIn those situations where the Security Council has \r\nreferred a situation to the Court, the Council must also \r\nplay its role in ensuring cooperation and an appropriate \r\ncomplementarity dialogue between the Court and the \r\nState concerned.\r\nThirdly, States parties will have to engage \r\nin a discussion on some of the difficult questions \r\nthat have arisen in the context of such situations \r\ninvolving complementarity to show ownership of the \r\naccountability system we have created together. It is no \r\nlonger enough to invoke complementarity; we also have \r\nto do our part to make it work in practice. There is a lot \r\nof room for us to be more creative than we have been \r\nin the past.\r\nEmbracing and understanding complementarity \r\nis an inevitable step in our progress towards a truly \r\nuniversal accountability system. But it is also the key \r\nto understanding that the success and impact of the \r\nCourt cannot be measured against the number of trials \r\nheld and convictions handed down, as some of us still \r\ndo. Nevertheless, trials will of course always be a core \r\nfunction of the Court. The conclusion of the trial against \r\nIn that regard, we would also like to highlight the \r\nneed for cooperation with the Office of the Prosecutor \r\nwith regard to preliminary examinations.\r\nAccording to the Rome Statute, the mandate of the \r\nICC is subject to the principle of complementarity. It is \r\nStates that have the primary responsibility to investigate \r\nand prosecute ICC crimes. The ICC is thus a Court of \r\nlast resort. We must, however, acknowledge that for \r\nmany States there is a lack of resources and capacity \r\nto exercise genuine criminal law proceedings for such \r\ncomplex and large-scale crimes as genocide, crimes \r\nagainst humanity and war crimes. The Nordic countries \r\nare prepared to assist those States parties that are willing \r\nto enhance their national legal capacities in this field. \r\nOne concrete example of complementarity engagement \r\nis Justice Rapid Response, which is a supporting \r\nmechanism for providing States and organizations with \r\ncriminal justice professionals trained for international \r\ninvestigations who can be rapidly deployed, for instance \r\nto commissions of inquiry established by the Human \r\nRights Council.\r\nLet me conclude by pledging that the Nordic \r\ncountries will remain principal supporters of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court. We are committed \r\nto continue working for the Court’s effectiveness, \r\nprofessionalism, independence and integrity. Those \r\nare prerequisites for the ICC’s ability to achieve \r\naccountability and meaningful justice for victims.\r\nPrince Zeid Ra’ad Zeid Al-Hussein (Jordan): \r\nI have the honour to speak today on behalf of my \r\ncolleagues from Liechtenstein, Ambassador Christian \r\nWenaweser, and Costa Rica, His Excellency Mr. Bruno \r\nStagno Ugarte, as well as on my own behalf — the three \r\nof us being former Presidents of the Assembly of States \r\nParties to the Rome Statute.\r\nThis year’s report of the International Criminal \r\nCourt (ICC) (see A/67/308), presented by President \r\nSang-Hyun Song some 10 years after the entry into \r\nforce of the Rome Statute, gives us a unique opportunity \r\nto take stock of where we stand and, in particular, \r\nto identify the challenges we face, in particular in \r\nconnection with the cooperation between the Court \r\nand the United Nations. Key among those challenges \r\nis certainly making the complementary nature of the \r\nICC understood and acted upon accordingly. It is often \r\nemphasized that the Court is an institution of last resort \r\nand that national jurisdictions have primacy in dealing \r\nwith the crimes over which the Court has jurisdiction. \r\n14 12-57486\r\nA/67/PV.31\r\nsignificantly higher costs. In practice, the Council \r\nhas made referrals to the ICC without putting the \r\nfinancial burden on the United Nations membership, as \r\nit rightfully should have, both in accordance with the \r\nRome Statute and the Relationship Agreement between \r\nthe Court and the United Nations. We hope that that \r\npractice will be changed in the near future so that the \r\nrelationship between the two organizations becomes a \r\nreal partnership. The States parties should not have to \r\ncontinue bearing the costs of the decisions arising from \r\nSecurity Council decisions.\r\nLet me conclude with some brief remarks on \r\nthe amendments to the Rome Statute that States \r\nparties adopted by consensus at the Kampala Review \r\nConference. The amendments on the crime of \r\naggression in particular are of direct and immediate \r\nrelevance to the Assembly. The prohibition of the illegal \r\nuse of force, which is at the core of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, has finally been given its complement \r\nin international criminal justice. As early as 2017, the \r\nCourt can exercise its jurisdiction over the crime of \r\naggression — the worst forms of the illegal use of force, \r\ncarried out by persons in leadership positions — once \r\n30 States have ratified the Kampala amendments \r\nand the Assembly of States Parties has decided to \r\nactivate the regime. The Kampala consensus is firmly \r\nbased on, and would not have been possible without, \r\nresolution 3314 (XXIX), on the topic of aggression. We \r\nhope that members of the Assembly will therefore look \r\nfavourably at the possibility of ratifying the Kampala \r\namendments and to help the Court achieve what was \r\nstarted in the Hall almost 40 years ago with the adoption \r\nof resolution 3314 (XXIX).\r\nMr. McLay (New Zealand): I have the honour to \r\nspeak on behalf of Canada, Australia and New Zealand \r\n(CANZ). We reiterate our strong support for the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC) and the critical role \r\nit plays in ensuring accountability for the most serious \r\ncrimes of concern to the international community. \r\nStates of course have the primary responsibility to \r\nprosecute such crimes committed on their territory or \r\nby their nationals. However, as a Court of last resort, \r\nthe ICC has jurisdiction to act where domestic courts \r\nare unwilling or unable to investigate and prosecute \r\nsuch crimes.\r\nThis is the tenth anniversary of the entry into force \r\nof the Rome Statute. CANZ commends all bodies of the \r\nCourt on their contribution to the establishment of the \r\nCourt as a significant part of the international justice \r\nThomas Lubanga Dyilo should be a moment for us to \r\ntry to enhance the efficiency of judicial proceedings. \r\nThe lessons learned from the trial, combined with \r\nthose we can draw from the ad hoc tribunals whose \r\nwork is closing down, offers enormous potential in \r\nthat respect. Clearly, expediting judicial proceedings is \r\nin the interest of due process and the effectiveness of \r\nthe Court alike. We hope that we will see a dialogue \r\nbetween States and Court officials on the basis of the \r\nexperience accumulated over the past two decades \r\nand, as a result, agreement on a range of measures to \r\nimprove the proceedings before the Court.\r\nEven the most efficient proceedings do not help if \r\nan individual indicted by the Court is not arrested. That \r\nsituation still prevails with respect to 12 outstanding \r\narrest warrants, including the first ones ever issued by \r\nthe Court. Cooperation by States is key with respect \r\nto every aspect of the work of the Court, but nowhere \r\nmore important than in the area of arrests. The past \r\nyears have seen very important advances towards the \r\nuniversality of the Rome Statute, as its membership \r\nhas reached critical mass and is approaching two-thirds \r\nof the membership of the Assembly. Nevertheless, we \r\nneed to make sure that we deepen the support for the \r\nCourt, in addition to broadening it. Most important, \r\nwe must pursue accountability in a consistent and \r\npersistent manner. The work before the Assembly gives \r\nample opportunity for doing so, almost on a daily basis. \r\nToo often, we squander those opportunities.\r\nMore so than other areas, international criminal \r\njustice tends to be plagued by controversial discussions \r\nabout budgetary issues. It is not easy to explain why that \r\nis, in particular because international criminal justice is \r\nnot expensive. For some $150 million per year, we have \r\nestablished a functioning, professional, independent \r\nCourt that constitutes probably the most significant \r\nadvance in the global architecture of international \r\norganizations in the past few years. But certainly, we \r\nmust address the criticism, by making the Court more \r\nefficient and more accountable for administrative \r\nmatters. We understand that those discussions are on \r\na good path.\r\nThere is one aspect, though, that only the Assembly \r\ncan address: the financing of investigations mandated \r\nby the Security Council. In referring situations to the \r\nCourt, the Council de facto seizes the opportunity \r\noffered by the Rome Statute to use the Court as a \r\nsubstitute for an ad hoc tribunal — which the Council \r\nalso has the mandate to establish, of course, but at \r\n12-57486 15\r\nA/67/PV.31\r\nissued by the ICC. We encourage States parties to arrest \r\nindicted persons if, for whatever reason, such persons \r\narrive on their territory.\r\nThe effectiveness of the ICC is also dependent on \r\nthe support of the Security Council. CANZ believes \r\nthat when the Council makes a referral to the ICC, it \r\nshould do so with a clear commitment to follow through \r\nand to ensure that the Court receives all the necessary \r\nsupport. We encourage the Council to consider how it \r\ncould better support the work of the Court.\r\nIt is clear that the ICC has a hugely valuable role \r\nto play on behalf of the international community in its \r\nefforts to deter the most serious crimes and to ensure \r\naccountability for such crimes. Canada, Australia and \r\nNew Zealand remain deeply committed to providing \r\nthe Court with unwavering support. We look forward to \r\nworking with all States parties to advance our common \r\ncause of ensuring that the perpetrators of the most \r\nserious crimes of international concern are truly held \r\nto account.\r\nMr. Pírez Pérez (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nThe delegation of Cuba takes note the report of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court contained in the note \r\nby the Secretary-General (A/67/308) and wishes to \r\nreiterate its commitment to fighting impunity for \r\ncrimes that affect the international community. \r\nThe events of recent years are irrefutable proof \r\nof the lack of independence of the International \r\nCriminal Court largely as a result of the provisions \r\nof article 16 of the Rome Statute and the broad and \r\nunfair powers granted to the Security Council with \r\nregard to the Court’s work. Besides distorting the basis \r\nof the Court’s jurisdiction, that violates the principle \r\nof the independence of jurisdictional bodies and of \r\ntransparency and impartiality in the administration of \r\njustice. \r\nThe referrals to the Court by the Security Council, \r\nin particular those of heads of State in office, affirm \r\nthe negative trend that our country has condemned \r\non various occasions. Such referrals by the Security \r\nCouncil are a constant violation of international law \r\nand are an attack on developing countries in the name \r\nof fighting impunity. For that reason, Cuba reiterates \r\nits position in favour of establishing an impartial, \r\nnon-selective, effective and fair international criminal \r\njurisdiction that complements national justice systems \r\nand that is truly independent, and therefore free from \r\narchitecture. The international community can take \r\ngreat pride in the progress achieved since the adoption \r\nof the Rome Statute. Today, the Court is a fully \r\nfunctioning institution. Those committed to providing \r\nit with political and diplomatic support have grown \r\nfrom the 60 States parties required to bring the Rome \r\nStatute into force, to — as Trinidad and Tobago, Sweden \r\nand others have reminded us — a community of 121 \r\nStates. CANZ welcomes the progress towards universal \r\naccession to the Rome Statute and the strengthened \r\nprospect of justice for victims that such universal \r\naccession would represent. We encourage States not yet \r\nparty to the Statute to join us in taking a strong stand \r\nagainst impunity by acceding to the Statute.\r\nIn its tenth year, the delivery of the Court’s first \r\njudgment, followed by decisions on sentencing and \r\nreparations, were milestones for the Court, and we \r\ncongratulate all those involved. We welcome the \r\nfact that the trial of the Court’s second case has also \r\nbeen completed. We await the outcome of the Trial \r\nChamber’s deliberations. We also welcome the fact that \r\ntwo further cases are in the trial phase and the issuance \r\nof two new arrest warrants this year.\r\nCANZ also takes this opportunity to welcome the \r\nICC’s new Prosecutor, Ms. Fatou Bensouda. We have \r\nevery confidence that she will provide outstanding \r\nleadership as the Office of the Prosecutor enters the next \r\nphase of the Court’s development. While applauding the \r\nCourt’s substantial achievements over the past decade, \r\nCANZ recognizes that it faces ongoing challenges. The \r\ndetention of four staff members in June highlighted \r\nthe risks that the Court staff face in carrying out their \r\nfunctions. As the 2012 report of the International \r\nCriminal Court (see A/67/308) emphasizes, the Court \r\nmust rely heavily on the cooperation of the international \r\ncommunity in order to carry out those functions \r\neffectively. \r\nThe cooperation of States is particularly required \r\nin relation to the enforcement of international arrest \r\nwarrants, the surrender of accused persons, the \r\nallocation of adequate resources and the protection of \r\nvictims and witnesses. CANZ acknowledges that the \r\nnon-execution of the Court’s requests may impede its \r\nability to carry out its mandate. \r\nWe therefore call on all States to cooperate fully \r\nwith the Court and its processes. In particular, we \r\ncall on both States parties and non-States parties that \r\nare subject to obligations under Security Council \r\nresolutions to act on the outstanding arrest warrants \r\n16 12-57486\r\nA/67/PV.31\r\nsubordination to political interests that may distort its \r\nessence.\r\nIssues related to such matters were not settled by \r\nthe outcomes of the Review Conference of the Rome \r\nStatute, held in Kampala from 31 May to 11 June \r\n2010. As a body of international criminal jurisdiction, \r\nthe Court remains subject to the Security Council’s \r\nillegal, anti-democratic and outrageous decisions, \r\nwhich are contrary to international law. As a result of \r\nthe behaviour of some of its permanent members, the \r\nCouncil continues to provide complete impunity to the \r\nreal perpetrators of crimes and massacres of concern to \r\nthe international community. \r\nIt is regrettable that Security Council resolutions \r\nprovide that crimes committed by the forces of Powers \r\nthat are Council members and that are not party to \r\nthe Rome Statute remain beyond investigation. Such \r\nreferences are offensive to the international community. \r\nThey demonstrate the political double standards with \r\nwhich that organ operates and ignore the principles by \r\nwhich the International Criminal Court should function.\r\nThe delegation of Cuba reiterates that the activities \r\nof the International Criminal Court cannot disregard \r\ninternational treaties and the principles of international \r\nlaw. The Court must respect the principle of law \r\nregarding the consent of a State to be bound by a treaty, \r\nenshrined in article 11 of the Vienna Convention on the \r\nLaw of Treaties, of 23 May 1969.\r\nCuba wishes to reiterate its serious concern about \r\nthe precedent being established by the Court’s decisions \r\nto initiate criminal trials against nationals of States \r\nthat are not party to the Rome Statute and that have \r\nnot even accepted its jurisdiction, in accordance with \r\narticle 12 of the Convention. The jurisdiction of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court must remain independent \r\nof the political bodies of the United Nations and must \r\nalways operate in a complementary way to national \r\ncriminal jurisdictions. \r\nThe people of Cuba have suffered the most diverse \r\nforms of aggression for 50 years. The harassment and \r\naggressiveness of the Government of the United States \r\nhave injured our killed thousands of our country’s \r\npeople. Hundreds of families have lost their children, \r\nparents and siblings, and untold economic and financial \r\nassets.\r\nHowever, the definition of the crime of aggression \r\nadopted at the Kampala Conference by no means takes \r\ninto account every aspect that I have mentioned. The \r\ncrime of aggression should be broadly defined in such \r\na way that it covers all forms of aggression that are \r\nmanifested in relations between States, which in no \r\nway are limited to the use of armed force but equally \r\naffect the sovereignty, territorial integrity or political \r\nindependence of States. \r\nOur country reaffirms its readiness to fight \r\nimpunity. We remain committed to international \r\ncriminal justice, to adhering to the principles of \r\ntransparency, independence and impartiality, and to \r\nfully implementing and respecting international law.\r\nMr. Sul Kyung-hoon (Republic of Korea): At the \r\noutset, my delegation would like to express its sincere \r\nappreciation to the President of the International \r\nCriminal Court (ICC), The Honourable Judge Sang-\r\nHyun Song, for his comprehensive report on the \r\nactivities of the Court in the past year (see A/67/308). \r\nIn particular, my delegation highly commends the fact \r\nthat the joint effort of the Presidency, the Chambers, \r\nthe Office of the Prosecutor and the Registry has firmly \r\nlaid solid foundations for the effective functioning of \r\nthe Court. \r\nWe warmly welcome the notable achievements of \r\nthe Court in its involvement with several situations \r\nin countries in Africa. Among other things, we take \r\nparticular note of the fact that the Court has succeeded \r\nin reaching a historic decision in the case of The \r\nProsecutor v. Thomas Lubanga Dyilo this year. It \r\nwas the first judgment that included a final order and \r\nsentence, as well as reparations for the victims. We \r\nbelieve that the case effectively shows that the ICC is \r\nnow firmly established to ensure justice for heinous \r\ncrimes.\r\nWe may recall that, during our debate over the draft \r\nof the Rome Statute, some of us took a rather skeptical \r\nstance towards the establishment of a permanent \r\ncourt to pursue international criminal justice. Since \r\nits entry into force, in 2002, however, the number of \r\nStates parties to the Rome Statute has steadily grown \r\nto 121. During the past year, five new members joined \r\nas States parties. We hope that the momentum towards \r\nuniversality will continue in the forthcoming years.\r\nIt is also worthwhile to note that the ICC has provided \r\nsubstantial technical assistance to other tribunals, \r\nincluding the Special Court for Sierra Leone and the \r\nSpecial Tribunal for Lebanon. Such contributions not \r\nonly help to ensure the effective functioning of those \r\n12-57486 17\r\nA/67/PV.31\r\ntribunals, but also indicate the ICC’s improved capacity \r\nto become a hub for the international justice system.\r\nThe International Criminal Court was established \r\nto end impunity against the gravest crimes, such as \r\ngenocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and \r\nthe crime of aggression. The effective functioning \r\nof the Court will greatly contribute to preventing \r\nthose heinous crimes, thus laying the foundation for \r\nsustainable peace.\r\nDespite the Court’s remarkable achievements and its \r\nconstructive role in strengthening the tribunal system, \r\nthere is still a lot more to do to fulfil its mandate, which \r\nwill not be achieved by the efforts of the ICC alone. \r\nIn that context, my delegation welcomes the increasing \r\ncooperation with the United Nations, as described in \r\npart IV of the ICC report. We hope that that cooperative \r\nrelationship will be further strengthened.\r\nWithout a doubt, it will be critical for the Court \r\nto garner firm support and cooperation from all States \r\nMembers of the United Nations. Without their full \r\ncooperation, the ICC would be unable, inter alia, to \r\nexecute outstanding arrest warrants for perpetrators or \r\nconduct thorough investigations.\r\nAt the same time, the Court’s effective functioning \r\nwill be in the interest of the entire membership of the \r\nUnited Nations, as it plays an instrumental role in \r\nupholding the rule of law, which is one of the main \r\nprinciples underpinning the United Nations. In that \r\nrespect, my delegation wishes to reaffirm its full \r\nsupport for the effective and efficient operation of the \r\nCourt.\r\nMr. Stuerchler Gonzenbach (Switzerland) (spoke \r\nin French): My delegation would first like to thank \r\nPresident Sang-Hyun Song for introducing the eighth \r\nannual report (see A/67/308) of the International \r\nCriminal Court (ICC). We also wish to express our \r\nappreciation to all of the staff members of the Court \r\nfor their work and daily efforts in fulfilling their tasks, \r\nwhich continue to grow and recently resulted in the \r\nCourt’s first judgment.\r\nNot only must the Court work tirelessly to advance \r\nthe vision of the Rome Statute, but as Members of the \r\nUnited Nations we must do the same. As my delegation \r\nargued during the Security Council’s open debate on \r\npeace and security (S/PV.6849 (Resumption 1)) of \r\n17 October, the International Criminal Court and the \r\nUnited Nations have mutually reinforcing, rather than \r\nconflicting, mandates. \r\nRecently, the Government of Mali expressed its \r\nhope that the Security Council would request a possible \r\ninternational military force to support efforts to bring \r\nto justice perpetrators of serious crimes, especially \r\nthose likely to be prosecuted before the ICC. That \r\nwill require us to do everything possible in order to \r\nmaximize synergies between the two institutions. \r\nInstead of understanding peace and justice as two \r\nseparate things, we must see them as two sides of the \r\nsame coin.\r\nPeace should not, and cannot, be achieved at the \r\nexpense of justice. Switzerland continues to believe \r\nthat the situation in the Syrian Arabic Republic \r\nshould be referred to the Court’s jurisdiction. Crimes \r\ncommitted in Syria, irrespective of by whom, must \r\nnot go unpunished. We note that a growing number \r\nof Member States support our initiative to address a \r\nletter to the Security Council on Syria. We encourage \r\nMember States that have not yet done so to join in our \r\neffort.\r\nA referral to the Court is necessary not only because \r\nof the grave crimes committed in Syria; it would also \r\nclearly demonstrate the Council’s commitment to \r\nthe fight against impunity. In order to enhance the \r\ndeterrent effect of international criminal justice, the \r\nCouncil should adopt a consistent referral policy and \r\ndeterminedly follow up on referrals. A decision by the \r\nSecurity Council to refer a situation to the Court should \r\nnot signal the end of the Council’s commitment to the \r\nfight against impunity but, rather, the beginning. \r\nI have two additional points to make. First, the \r\nUnited Nations should consider funding for the Court \r\nfor referrals, as provided for in the Relationship \r\nAgreement between the United Nations and the ICC. \r\nSecondly, it should be noted that the Rome Statute does \r\nnot provide for exceptional situations, such as referrals \r\ninvolving nationals from non-State parties.\r\nWith respect to the broader relationship between the \r\nUnited Nations and the Court, my delegation welcomes \r\nthe report (A/67/378/Add.1) of the Secretary-General \r\non the implementation of article 3 of the Relationship \r\nAgreement, in which he expresses his determination \r\nto limit to absolutely essential contacts the contact \r\nof United Nations officials with persons who are the \r\nsubject of arrest warrants. That policy is important in \r\nstrengthening the credibility of both the United Nations \r\nand the Court in the fight against impunity.\r\n18 12-57486\r\nA/67/PV.31\r\nMrs. Miculescu (Romania): I would like to \r\nbegin by thanking the International Criminal Court \r\nfor all its hard work, as comprehensively reflected in \r\nits eighth annual report (A/67/308), submitted to the \r\nGeneral Assembly in accordance with article 6 of the \r\nRelationship Agreement between the United Nations \r\nand the International Criminal Court (ICC).\r\nThe report reveals the significant progress that \r\nhas marked this tenth anniversary year of activity of \r\nthe ICC, which is illustrated, among other important \r\ndevelopments, by the first verdict and sentence delivered \r\nby the Court, in the case of The Prosecutor v. Thomas \r\nLubanga Dyilo, and by the completion of the trial in \r\na second case, The Prosecutor v. Germain Katanga \r\nand Mathieu Ngudjolo Chui. This also proves that the \r\nInternational Criminal Court has become not only a \r\ncommunity of States or ideals, but a fully functional \r\ninstitution.\r\nHowever, despite the ICC’s indisputable \r\nachievements, this anniversary should also serve as \r\nan opportunity for ongoing reflection on finding the \r\nbest ways to face and overcome the challenges ahead \r\nand efficiently combat impunity related to the most \r\nserious crimes under international law. We believe that \r\nthe assessment should take into account, among other \r\naspects, best practices and lessons learned from the \r\nexperiences related to the activities of the international \r\nad hoc tribunals and special courts. In that respect, we \r\nlook forward to the debates of the forthcoming Assembly \r\nof States Parties to the Rome Statute of the ICC, in The \r\nHague, which represents an excellent opportunity for a \r\nfruitful exchange of views on the topic.\r\nWe would like to welcome the States — Cape \r\nVerde, Guatemala, Maldives, the Philippines and \r\nVanuatu — that have become party to the Rome Statute \r\nduring the reporting year. The number of States parties \r\nto this essential treaty has grown significantly to 121. \r\nHowever, despite the growing membership of the Rome \r\nStatue, we firmly believe that the quest for universality \r\nshould continue, and in that respect we encourage all \r\nStates to become party to the Rome Statute. \r\nIt is our belief that strengthening the ICC by \r\nachieving universality is the most powerful preventive \r\napproach to compliance with the most important \r\nnorms of international law, and will reduce the risk of \r\nimpunity. Given its capacity as former Vice-President \r\nof the Assembly of States Parties to the Rome Statute \r\nand current facilitator on the universality and full \r\nimplementation of the Statute, Romania remains fully \r\nThe Court should be able to count on our full support \r\nhere at the United Nations as well as in our countries. \r\nCooperation by States is fundamental. In that respect, \r\nwe regret that the high number of outstanding arrest \r\nwarrants overshadows the many positive examples of \r\ncooperation. We urge all States to increase their efforts \r\nto bring suspects to justice. The International  Criminal \r\nCourt must also be able to count on effective national \r\nimplementation legislation in each State party. The \r\ncomplementarity provided for in the Rome Statute will \r\nbe effective only if States equip themselves with the \r\ncapacity to prosecute before their national authorities \r\nperpetrators of crimes covered by the ICC.\r\nSwitzerland recently ratified the Agreement on the \r\nPrivileges and Immunities of the International Criminal \r\nCourt and is currently preparing to ratify the Kampala \r\namendments to the Rome Statute. \r\nWe commend the prompt ratifications of \r\nLiechtenstein, San Marino and Samoa. We hope that \r\nthe Court’s jurisdiction over the crime of aggression \r\nwill be activated as early as 2017. The consensus \r\nreached in Kampala was a historic one. We must now \r\nwork to give it effect as soon as possible. Switzerland \r\nalso congratulates Grenada, Tunisia, the Philippines, \r\nMaldives, Cape Verde, Vanuatu and Guatemala on \r\ntheir ratifications of the Rome Statute in the past two \r\nyears, thereby bringing the number of States parties \r\nto 121 — almost two thirds of the United Nations \r\nmembership.\r\nWith a view to the upcoming Assembly of States \r\nParties to the Rome Statute, my delegation would like \r\nto emphasize that our commitment to the Court and \r\nits mission is not only purely political; it can also be \r\ngauged by our financial support.\r\nFinally, at the recent High-level Meeting on the \r\nRule of Law at the National and International Levels \r\n(A/67/PV.3), Heads of State and Government from all \r\nregions of the world declared by consensus: \r\n“We recognize the role of the International \r\nCriminal Court in a multilateral system that aims \r\nto end impunity and establish the rule of law.” \r\n(resolution 67/1, para. 23) \r\nWe all represent the multilateral system on which \r\nthe Court depends. We all benefit from a strong and \r\neffective Court. Therefore, we should all do our utmost \r\nto support this valuable institution.\r\n12-57486 19\r\nA/67/PV.31\r\nHowever, it was the amendment on the crime of \r\naggression that determined the historic significance \r\nof the 2010 Kampala Review Conference. With the \r\ndefinition of the crime of and the conditions necessary \r\nfor the Court to exercise its jurisdiction, we fulfilled \r\nthe mandate of the Rome Statute with regard to the \r\ncrime of aggression. The Court will be able to exercise \r\nits jurisdiction over the crime of aggression one year \r\nafter the ratification or acceptance of the amendment \r\nby 30 States parties. Once they have done so, the \r\nCourt’s jurisdiction will be activated starting in 2017, \r\nin accordance with the amendment.\r\nStates parties must commit to ratifying the \r\namendments adopted in Kampala as soon as possible. \r\nArgentina is actively working on that process internally, \r\nwith a view to ratifying the amendments as soon as \r\npossible. We are pleased that other States parties are \r\nmaking similar efforts.\r\nThis year marks the tenth anniversary of the entry \r\ninto force of the Statute, and hence the establishment of \r\nthe International Criminal Court. The Court is today a \r\nmature permanent tribunal and the centre of the criminal \r\njustice system of the international community. On the \r\noccasion of the tenth anniversary, we should like to pay \r\ntribute to the negotiators of the Rome Statute from all \r\ncountries for having made the major contribution to the \r\nrule of law that is the International Criminal Court; to \r\nthe first Prosecutor, Mr. Luis Moreno-Ocampo; and \r\nto the current and past judges for their courage and \r\ncommitment to the fight against impunity. On this \r\ntenth anniversary, the international community must \r\nrecognize the value of the Court and take stock of the \r\nways in which States Members of the United Nations \r\ncan improve their participation.\r\nSince the Rome Statute entered into force, the \r\nneed for accountability for crimes under the Statute’s \r\njurisdiction has been incorporated in a tangible \r\nmanner into the work of the United Nations. The \r\nSecurity Council has also incorporated the ICC in \r\nits considerations on concrete situations. All this has \r\nstrengthened the fight against impunity. At the same \r\ntime, some challenges remain. \r\nMutual cooperation between the United Nations \r\nand the Court is crucial, with full respect for the \r\nCourt’s judicial independence. The question of \r\nnon-essential contacts with persons for whom the \r\nCourt has issued arrest warrants should be part of the \r\ncooperation between the Court and the United Nations \r\nprovided for in the Relationship Agreement. But it is \r\ncommitted to promoting the universality of the ICC \r\namong States. We can be counted on.\r\nThe report of the Court also illustrates the essential \r\npart that States continue to play in so many respects \r\nand their major role in helping the Court to fulfil its \r\nmandate. Full and rapid cooperation with the Court, \r\nincluding by execution of arrest warrants, remains \r\ncrucial for the effectiveness of the ICC Statute. The \r\nadoption of adequate national legislation is critical \r\nto an effective fight against impunity. The consistent \r\nfinancial commitment of the States is also needed in \r\norder to ensure the Court’s optimal functioning, while \r\nconsistent public and diplomatic support for its activity \r\nstrengthens its position.\r\nLet me conclude by reiterating Romania’s full \r\nsupport to the International Criminal Court and by \r\nendorsing the conclusion of the report on the ICC’s \r\nneed for the strong, consistent and ongoing support \r\nof States and the international community in order to \r\nfulfil its mandate.\r\nMs. Millicay (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nArgentina acknowledges and thanks the President of \r\nthe International Criminal Court (ICC), Justice Sang-\r\nHyun Song, for introducing the report of the Court to \r\nthe General Assembly (A/67/308).\r\nThe Rome Statute and the International Criminal \r\nCourt are among the most notable achievements of \r\nmultilateral diplomacy, and their contribution to the \r\nfight against impunity for crimes against humanity, \r\ngenocide and war crimes is evident. A little more than \r\na decade after the adoption of the Rome Statute, the \r\nCourt is a fully functioning permanent international \r\ncriminal tribunal.\r\nThis year finds the Rome Statute and the ICC much \r\nstronger. To date, 121 States have become party to \r\nthe Statute. In that respect, I would like to welcome \r\nGuatemala. Another positive development is the \r\nratification of the amendments to the Rome Statute by \r\nLiechtenstein and Samoa.\r\nRegarding the amendments to the Rome Statute, \r\nwe note that the modification of article 8 added certain \r\ncrimes to the war crimes committed in the context \r\nof armed conflicts of a non-international character. \r\nSuch amendments entail a step forward in the fight \r\nagainst impunity regarding violations of international \r\nhumanitarian law. \r\n20 12-57486\r\nA/67/PV.31\r\nCouncil. We must now address it with regard to the \r\nInternational Criminal Court. Inaction regarding \r\nthe financial resources to be provided by the United \r\nNations under article 115 of the Statute would only have \r\na negative effect on the current cases before the Court \r\nand on action taken proprio motu by the Prosecutor.\r\nThis year, which marks the tenth anniversary of \r\nthe International Criminal Court, Argentina would like \r\nto reiterate that the Court represents an outstanding \r\ncontribution to the fight against impunity. I would \r\nrecall, as the preamble of the Kampala Declaration \r\nstates,\r\n“the noble mission and the role of the International \r\nCriminal Court in a multilateral system that aims \r\nto end impunity, establish the rule of law, promote \r\nand encourage respect for human rights and achieve \r\nsustainable peace, in accordance with international \r\nlaw and the purposes and principles of the Charter \r\nof the United Nations”.\r\nOnce again, I reiterate Argentina’s fi rm commitment \r\nto the International Criminal Court.\r\nMr. Kodama (Japan): I would first like to thank \r\nPresident Sang-Hyun Song for his comprehensive and \r\nin-depth report (A/67/308) on the invaluable work of \r\nthe International Criminal Court (ICC). My delegation \r\nwould like to express its appreciation for his able \r\nleadership of the Court.\r\nJapan attaches great importance to the central role \r\nof the ICC in ending impunity and enhancing the rule \r\nof law at the international level. That role is closely \r\nlinked to the maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity through its efforts to achieve justice and \r\nprevent heinous crimes and other grave violations of \r\ninternational humanitarian and human rights law. \r\nWe should recall that there is now a serious call for a \r\nreferral of the situation in Syria to the ICC.\r\nThis year, which marks the tenth anniversary of \r\nthe entry into force of the Rome Statute, the ICC has \r\nmade significant progress. In March, it issued the first \r\njudgment in the Lubanga case, in which a warlord accused \r\nof recruiting and using child soldiers was convicted and \r\nsentenced. Japan welcomes this significant step towards \r\na fully operational international criminal justice system \r\nand the development of international criminal law.\r\nIn the past 10 years, the ICC’s credibility has \r\nincreased around the world. As noted in the President’s \r\nreport, the number of States parties to the Rome \r\ncooperation on the part of States that is fundamental \r\nto the Court’s ability to fully comply with its mandate. \r\nA permanent international justice system of necessity \r\nrequires cooperation on the part of all States Members \r\nof the United Nations. Every Member State, whether it \r\nis party to the Rome Statute or not, must cooperate with \r\nthe Court, and that obligation is particularly relevant \r\nwith regard to arrest warrants.\r\nRegarding referrals made by the Security Council, \r\nArgentina believes that the Council cannot merely \r\ntake note of the reports of the Prosecutor or the Court \r\nwithout following up on compliance with the obligation \r\nto cooperate with the Court or on situations on the \r\nground, such as the detention of ICC staff some months \r\nago. Argentina is convinced that establishing some kind \r\nof follow-up mechanism for situations referred to the \r\nCourt would substantially contribute to the Council’s \r\nresponsible collaboration with it.\r\nOther issues of concern to my delegation are, first, \r\nthe clause that, as in the two referrals that have already \r\nbeen made, seeks to exempt nationals of States that are \r\nnot party to the Rome Statute from the jurisdiction of \r\nthe Court for acts or omissions related to operations \r\nestablished or authorized by the Security Council. This \r\ncould allow the action of a political entity to weaken \r\nthe Court’s ability to render independent and impartial \r\njustice by seeking to create an exception not provided \r\nfor in the Rome Statute. This could affect the credibility \r\nof the Security Council and of the Court itself.\r\nThe other issue that concerns us, and that was also \r\nraised by the two referrals, could have a serious effect \r\non the Court. By establishing that the expenses derived \r\nfrom referrals will be defrayed not by the United \r\nNations but by the States parties to the Rome Statute, \r\nthe Council is contravening article 115 (b) of the Rome \r\nStatute and article 13 of the Relationship Agreement. \r\nWith an increasing number of cases, pressure on the \r\nresources available to the Court has grown; in practical \r\nterms, failure to address the financing of referrals could \r\nthreaten the viability of the Court over the long term.\r\nArgentina wishes to emphasize that the fight \r\nagainst impunity is a goal shared by the States parties \r\nto the Rome Statute and the United Nations. But that \r\nobjective must be accompanied by a commitment to \r\nproviding the Court with the means necessary to fulfil \r\nits mandate. Such commitment is not foreign to the \r\nUnited Nations, as it has been addressed with regard \r\nto the ad hoc tribunals established by the Security \r\n12-57486 21\r\nA/67/PV.31\r\nFinally, Japan hopes that the ICC will continue its \r\nwork in the fight against impunity and further enhance \r\nits credibility. Japan is determined to continue its \r\nsupport of the ICC and to contribute to the maintenance \r\nof international peace and security.\r\nMr. Silva (Brazil): I join others in thanking the \r\nPresident of the International Criminal Court (ICC), \r\nJudge Sang-Hyun Song, for his address and presentation \r\nof the eighth report of the Court to the General Assembly \r\n(A/67/308). I commend him and the other judges of the \r\nCourt on their decisive role in contributing to the rule \r\nof law and to the development of international criminal \r\nlaw.\r\nBrazil remains steadfast in its commitment to the \r\nRome Statute and to the cause of justice it promotes \r\nby establishing the first permanent, treaty-based court \r\nto try individuals accused of having committed the \r\nmost serious crimes of international concern. On the \r\nindependence of such an important judicial institution \r\nlies the foundation of its legitimacy in bringing accused \r\npersons to justice, with fairness and with full respect \r\nfor their rights.\r\nBrazil believes that the values enshrined in the Rome \r\nStatute are truly universal in nature, and we have always \r\nbeen staunch supporters of the Court’s universality. In \r\nthat regard, we note with satisfaction that, during the \r\nperiod covered by the report, Cape Verde, a member \r\nof the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries, \r\nGuatemala, the Philippines and Vanuatu deposited \r\ninstruments of ratification or accession, bringing the \r\ntotal number of States parties to the Rome Statute to \r\n121. We warmly welcome all of them, and we hope that \r\nmore States, of all sizes and on all continents, will ratify \r\nthe Rome Statute in the near future. In South America, \r\nas is well known, all countries are parties to the ICC \r\nand strong supporters of the Court’s contribution to the \r\ncause of international justice.\r\nIn 2012, we celebrate the tenth anniversary of \r\nthe entry into force of the Rome Statute. Earlier this \r\nyear, on 11 June, the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of \r\nthe Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) \r\nadopted a special declaration on the tenth anniversary \r\nof the ICC, underscoring the great importance that the \r\ncountries of the region attach to the Court. UNASUR \r\ncountries also highlighted the success of and their \r\nactive participation in the first Review Conference of \r\nthe Rome Statute, which took place in Kampala in 2010, \r\nand adopted by consensus the amendments related to \r\nStatute grew from 115 to 121 during the reporting \r\nperiod. Japan would particularly like to extend a warm \r\nwelcome to the Republic of Vanuatu, which became the \r\neighteenth Asia-Pacific member of the ICC at the end \r\nof 2011. Japan reaffirms its commitment to continuing \r\nto encourage those Asia-Pacific States that have not yet \r\ndone so to ratify or accede to the Statute by offering \r\nits assistance in developing legal systems and human \r\nresources.\r\nWhile commending the Court’s invaluable \r\nachievements, my delegation notes that the past 10 \r\nyears have left us with some challenges that we may \r\nhave to tackle over the next decade. One of the major \r\nchallenges facing the ICC is how to gain States’ \r\ncooperation in fulfilling the mandate given it by the \r\nRome Statute. Effective implementation of the Statute \r\ncan be achieved only on the basis of full cooperation \r\nby States. Japan calls on all States parties to cooperate \r\nfully with the ICC in accordance with their obligation \r\nunder the Rome Statute. In that regard, I would like \r\nto express our sincere appreciation to Ambassador \r\nTiina Intelmann, President of the Assembly of States \r\nParties to the Rome Statute, for her tireless efforts in \r\naddressing this issue.\r\nIn cases where situations in a non-State party are \r\nreferred to the Court by Security Council resolutions, \r\ncooperation between the Court and the Council \r\nis crucial. In that connection, we recall the ICC’s \r\nexperience in the cases of Darfur and Libya. Lack of \r\ncooperation can not only result in a failure to indict \r\nperpetrators of serious crimes, but also undermine the \r\nCourt’s credibility by betraying the expectations of the \r\nvictims and the international community. Japan also \r\nexpects dialogue and cooperation between the Court \r\nand the Security Council, including on the financial \r\nimplications of the Council’s referrals, to deepen.\r\nAnother element I want to highlight is the efficiency \r\nof the Court. The fact that its judicial independence \r\nis sacrosanct does not render the Court immune to \r\ninvestigation of its management. We must address this \r\nissue with a view to striking a good balance between \r\nthe need for strict financial discipline and the provision \r\nfor procedural legitimacy that a criminal institution \r\nrequires. In that regard, Japan welcomes the fact that \r\nStates parties are engaged in constructive discussions \r\non the budget in preparation for the coming Assembly \r\nof States Parties, and as the leading contributor would \r\nlike to continue to assist the Court in its efforts to \r\nimprove its management.\r\n22 12-57486\r\nA/67/PV.31\r\ndecides to pursue the referral track, based upon article \r\n13 (b) of the Rome Statute, it must do so rigorously \r\nand consistently, following a principled and coherent \r\napproach, thereby avoiding the risks of double standards \r\nand selectivity. Also importantly, Brazil reiterated its \r\ncommitment to the integrity of the Rome Statute and \r\nits firm opposition to any form of exemption of certain \r\ncategories of individuals from the jurisdiction of the \r\nICC.\r\nAt a time when the States parties are negotiating \r\nthe budget that will be approved by the upcoming \r\nAssembly, we would like to recall the very important \r\nissue of the financial burden of decisions of the Security \r\nCouncil to refer situations to the International Criminal \r\nCourt. Security Council referrals may entail formidable \r\nexpenses to the ICC, and such financial responsibility \r\nshould be borne by the international community as a \r\nwhole with funds provided by the United Nations, \r\nsubject to the approval of the General Assembly.\r\nIn its 10 years of existence, the ICC has already \r\ndemonstrated its importance in furthering justice \r\nand in contributing to world peace. Brazil takes this \r\nopportunity to express once again our full support to \r\nthe International Criminal Court and our appreciation \r\nto President Song.\r\nMr. De Vega (Philippines): The Philippines \r\nthanks President San-Hyun Song and his team at The \r\nHague for their comprehensive report on the work \r\nof the International Criminal Court in the past year \r\n(A/67/308).\r\nWe join this debate to affirm the commitment of \r\nthe Philippine Government and the Filipino people to \r\nfighting impunity anywhere in the word. For us, genuine \r\nglobal peace cannot be possible if it is not anchored in the \r\nprinciples underlying international criminal justice. As \r\nlong as there is impunity, the international community \r\nwill always condemn the most serious crimes of concern \r\nto the international community in the strongest terms \r\npossible. The international community will ensure that \r\nthe perpetrators account for their crimes. By so doing, \r\nthe international community will affirm that there will \r\nbe no peace without justice, not just for our generation \r\nbut also for generations yet to come. For the greater part \r\nof human history, that was not even possible. But it is \r\npossible now because for the past decade we have had \r\nthe International Criminal Court.\r\nThe current reporting period has been a milestone \r\nyear for international law in general and international \r\nthe crime of aggression and to the inclusion of the use \r\nof certain means as war crimes. The activation of the \r\nKampala amendments in 2017 will represent a major \r\ncontribution to completing the international criminal \r\njustice system adopted in Rome in 1998.\r\nI should also like to highlight that the Organization \r\nof American States also adopted a resolution on 4 June, \r\nrenewing the appeal to its member States that are not \r\nyet parties to the ICC to ratify or accede to the Rome \r\nStatute. The resolution also sent a strong message of \r\npolitical support to the Court.\r\nDuring the reporting period, the Court issued its \r\nfirst judgment, in the case of The Prosecutor v. Thomas \r\nLubanga Dyilo, in March. That represents an important \r\nstep for the victims of the crimes and sends a message \r\nof hope to all those who seek accountability for the \r\nmost serious crimes of international concern. The \r\nperiod covered by the report also shows that the Court \r\nis seized of seven open situations. The fact that there are \r\ncurrently outstanding requests for arrest and surrender \r\nissued by the Court against 12 individuals reminds us of \r\nthe crucial importance of cooperation, which involves \r\nStates parties and non-parties to the Statute, as well as \r\ninternational, regional and subregional organizations.\r\nBrazil attaches particular importance to efforts \r\naimed at reinforcing rule-of-law activities that focus \r\non prevention and that support the domestic capacity \r\nof States to prosecute serious crimes. States have a \r\nsovereign responsibility to deliver justice and promote \r\nlaw enforcement in an environment of strong national \r\ninstitutions. They must be supported in their efforts so \r\nthat the Court can function as a last resort.\r\nThe next Assembly of States Parties will hold a \r\nthematic debate under the rubric “Tenth anniversary of \r\nthe entry into force of the Rome Statute: the challenges \r\nahead”. It will certainly benefit from the insights \r\nand comments made during a very interesting and \r\nimportant debate, held a few weeks ago in the Security \r\nCouncil, on peace and justice, with a special focus on \r\nthe role of the International Criminal Court, convened \r\nby the Guatemalan presidency of the Security Council \r\n(see S/PV.6849). We commend the Government of \r\nGuatemala for that initiative. \r\nOn that occasion, Brazil and many other States \r\nparties to the ICC had the opportunity to elaborate \r\non the role the Court plays in fostering international \r\ncriminal accountability and sustainable peace. Brazil \r\ndefended the idea that when the Security Council \r\n12-57486 23\r\nA/67/PV.31\r\nanswer to the law. If national courts cannot try them, \r\nthe International Criminal Court will be ready for them.\r\nWe pay close attention to developments in the other \r\njudicial proceedings in six situations, investigations in \r\nseven situations and preliminary examinations in nine \r\ncountries.\r\nAs we know only too well, the work of justice \r\nis never easy. With respect to the Court, we are \r\nrelieved that the four members of its staff were able \r\nto safely depart from their mission in Libya. For the \r\ninternational community as a whole, justice can be \r\nparticularly difficult in countries devastated by the \r\ncycle of violence and conflict, whether sectarian or \r\notherwise. National jurisdiction is the first defence and \r\nthe first bulwark against criminal impunity. The Court, \r\nthe United Nations and the international community \r\nshould help these countries to build their domestic \r\ncapacities, including through such technical assistance \r\nas the training of judges, prosecutors, the police and \r\nthe military.\r\nHuman resource development is essential to \r\ndevising country-specific systems for the protection \r\nof citizens and their human rights. At the same time, \r\nStates parties must ensure that our respective criminal \r\njustice systems are transparent, fair, effective and \r\nrelatively speedy, allowing for the prosecution of the \r\ncrimes contemplated by the Rome Statute.\r\nTo conclude, in anticipation of the eleventh \r\nAssembly of States Parties to the Rome Statute \r\nscheduled for later this month in The Hague, we call on \r\nall United Nations States Members, all States parties \r\nand even those that are not yet States parties to sustain \r\nthe momentum of this milestone year for international \r\ncriminal justice by supporting the work of the Court \r\nthrough adequate resources, including moral, political, \r\ndiplomatic and, most of all, financial resources.\r\nMr. Osman (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): All of us \r\nrespect international justice and give it high priority. It \r\nis indispensable to our efforts to establish international \r\npeace and security. The United Nations was established \r\nfor that very reason. However, and regrettably, we find \r\nthat the Organization, which we hope will establish \r\nand enforce international justice and spare the whole of \r\nhumankind the scourge of war, is limited in its ability \r\nto even condemn aggression. That is the greatest crime \r\ncondemned by the Charter of the United Nations. \r\ncriminal justice in particular. On 24 September, for the \r\nfirst time since international law created the United \r\nNations 67 years ago, we finally devoted a High-\r\nlevel Meeting to the Rule of Law at the National and \r\nInternational Levels. \r\nWe adopted a Declaration (resolution 67/1) that \r\nrecognizes that, across and beyond the United Nations \r\nsystem, we have the institutions, the working methods \r\nand the relationships to make the rule of law relevant \r\nto peace and security, human rights and development. \r\nOne of those institutions is none other than the \r\nCourt. In paragraph 23 of the Declaration, we recognize \r\nits role in a multilateral system that aims to end impunity \r\nand establish the rule of law. Our goal is universality. \r\nIn the current reporting period,  the Philippines became \r\nthe 117th State party to the Rome Statute. We thank \r\nthose countries that have commended and congratulated \r\nus and other countries for that decision. Now we join \r\nthe call for many more countries, particularly from the \r\nAsia-Pacific region, similarly to ratify or accede to the \r\nRome Statute.\r\nOur ratifi cation of the Rome Statute was the logical \r\nfollow-up to the enactment in 2010 by the Philippine \r\nCongress of Republic Act No. 9851, also known as \r\nthe Philippine Act on Crimes Against International \r\nHumanitarian Law, Genocide, and Other Crimes \r\nAgainst Humanity. The law incorporates many of the \r\nobligations of international humanitarian law and of the \r\nRome Statute into the domestic law of the Philippines.\r\nAlso during this period, Ms. Miriam Defensor \r\nSantiago of the Philippines was elected as a judge \r\nof the Court. Her election brings women judges to \r\na majority of 13 out of 24 judges. We reiterate our \r\ngratitude for the invaluable support of States parties to \r\nher candidacy. With Fatou Bensouda’s election in June \r\nas Chief Prosecutor, the Philippines is confident that \r\ninternational criminal justice will be safer in women’s \r\nhands.\r\nPerhaps more important to note is the first judgment \r\nand sentence handed down by the Court. On 14 March, \r\nafter a three-year trial, Thomas Lubanga was found \r\nguilty of war crimes, specifically for the recruitment \r\nof child soldiers, as specified by President Sang-Hyun \r\nSong. Thus, those who have committed or are thinking \r\nof committing genocide, crimes against humanity \r\nor war crimes should take heed. Crime does not pay. \r\nThere is nowhere to hide. Sooner or later, offenders will \r\n24 12-57486\r\nA/67/PV.31\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1593 (2005) was being \r\ndeliberated, some members of the Council expressed \r\ndivergent views on the relationship between the ICC \r\nand the Council. This is shown by the report of the \r\nICC before the Assembly in its attempt to explain the \r\nCourt’s failure to discharge its task in Palestine and in \r\nillogical claims cloaked in laws and regulations.\r\nThe references in paragraph 90 of the report lead us \r\nto caution against the politicization of the Relationship \r\nAgreement between the United Nations and the ICC, \r\nas well as any effort to turn the United Nations and its \r\nmissions and peacekeeping operations into instruments \r\nin the hands of certain influential Powers and into a \r\nsecretariat for the Office of the Prosecutor and its \r\npolicies, which are not approved by the international \r\ncommunity. We stress that the specialized work of \r\nthe United Nations, which is based on the will of its \r\nMembers and on international or bilateral agreements \r\nwith individual countries, should be the sole \r\nresponsibility of the Organization and its Members. \r\nAny other arrangement runs counter to the terms of \r\nreference agreed upon between the United Nations \r\nand its Members, especially insofar as peacekeeping \r\noperations are concerned. \r\nThe references in paragraph 95 of the report to the \r\ndetention of four staff members of the Court in Zintan, \r\nLibya, by the competent authorities are yet further proof \r\nof the failure of the Court to respect the sovereignty \r\nof States. They even indicate a clear violation of the \r\nnational laws of countries. \r\nIt is clearly evident from what we have stated that \r\nthe Relationship Agreement between the ICC and the \r\nUnited Nations is defective. In the framework of the \r\nreform of the international Organization in general, \r\nand of the Security Council in particular, we call for a \r\nreview of that Agreement.\r\nThe delegation of the Sudan would like to express \r\nits full and firm confidence that peace-loving countries, \r\nguided by the true values of justice, freedom and \r\nequality, will not allow justice to be politicized in this \r\nway or the Court to be diverted from the purpose for \r\nwhich it was established. We are solidly confident that \r\nthe majority of Member States, including the parties \r\nto the Rome Statute, fully realize the justness and \r\nsoundness of the Sudan’s position. This is obvious from \r\nthe support given to the Sudan by the geographical and \r\npolitical groups to which it belongs. We are confident \r\nthat the conscience of peoples is truly aware of the \r\nhegemony of influential States over the Court and its \r\nIn this context, I regret to say that my country \r\nwas subjected to a treacherous act of aggression on \r\n24 October by the Zionist entity. The Israeli air force \r\nattacked a military plant producing conventional arms \r\nand ammunition in my country. The treacherous attack \r\ndestroyed the military plant, killed a number of innocent \r\npeople, and demolished a number of houses in the area \r\nsurrounding the factory. It led to huge material loss, in \r\naddition to the senseless loss of innocent human life. \r\nWe have heard no words spoken about those events \r\nin this international Organization. Today in the General \r\nAssembly, one of its principal organs, we have heard \r\nno condemnation of that act of aggression, even though \r\nit has been condemned by a large number of regional \r\norganizations and political groups. What kind of \r\ninternational justice are we talking about? The United \r\nNations is unable to condemn aggression. \r\nMoreover, new entities have failed to prove their \r\ncredibility in the service of international justice. They \r\nhave objected to the noble concept of international \r\njustice and set it aside, relegating it to the intricacies \r\nof politics. The best example of that is the International \r\nCriminal Court (ICC). In our opinion, it was born \r\nhandicapped because it mixed that noble concept with \r\nthe complexities of politics and politicized international \r\njustice.\r\nMy delegation has read the report of the ICC \r\ncovering the activities of the Court during the period \r\nfrom August 2011 to July 2012 (A/67/308), which was \r\nsubmitted to the General Assembly on the basis of the \r\nRelationship Agreement between the United Nations \r\nand the ICC. It actually provides nothing new. On the \r\ncontrary, it clearly indicates the increasing deviation of \r\nthe Court from the goal of its work and shows it being \r\naffected by political considerations. \r\nTherefore, the countries that participated \r\nin the United Nations Diplomatic Conference \r\nof Plenipotentiaries on the Establishment of an \r\nInternational Criminal Court in order to reach an \r\nunderstanding on the concept of impunity and the \r\nmaintenance of justice have reservations concerning \r\nthe ICC’s approach to implementing its Statute and \r\ndischarging its mandate. \r\nThe relationship between the Security Council and \r\nthe ICC is subject to many doubts and caveats, which \r\ntook shape at the time of the 1998 Conference in Rome. \r\nThis was clearly expressed in the statement by the Arab \r\nGroup and has been reiterated since then. At the time \r\n12-57486 25\r\nA/67/PV.31\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe Acting President: I would like to consult \r\nmembers regarding an extension of the work of the \r\nFirst Committee. Members will recall that, at its \r\n2nd plenary meeting, on 21 September, the General \r\nAssembly approved the recommendation of the General \r\nCommittee that the First Committee would complete \r\nits work by Wednesday, 7 November 2012. However, I \r\nhave been informed by the Chair of the First Committee \r\nthat the Committee requests an extension of its work to \r\nFriday, 9 November, in view of the significant impact \r\nof Hurricane Sandy on the work of the Committee. \r\nMay I therefore take it that the General Assembly \r\nagrees to extend the work of the First Committee until \r\nFriday, 9 November? \r\nIt was so decided. \r\nThe meeting rose at 1 p.m.\r\ntargeting of African leaders and the African continent \r\nin a manner that recalls the loathsome imperialism of \r\nall, given that most of those tried by the Court are from \r\nAfrica. At the same time, the Court is unable to deal \r\nwith many of the crimes committed in Palestine, Iraq, \r\nAfghanistan and many other places around the world.\r\nIn conclusion, the just nature of the Sudanese \r\njudiciary is a guarantee of justice. The Sudanese \r\njudiciary has long historical experience beyond our \r\nborders, and we are therefore more than capable and \r\nqualified to ensure justice in my country, a task for \r\nwhich we have sole responsibility.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on this agenda item for this \r\nmeeting. \r\n"
