Today, we wish \r\nto highlight the important activity carried out by the \r\ntribunals set up by international mandate to provide \r\njustice by trying perpetrators, whomever and wherever \r\nthey may be. Following the outrageous human rights \r\nviolations of the 1990s in Rwanda and the former \r\nYugoslavia, and the establishment of the respective ad \r\nhoc international tribunals to address those situations, \r\nthe international community finally came to understand \r\nthat an international criminal court was necessary to \r\ndeter the recurrence of such atrocities and, in the case \r\nthat they did recur, to try those responsible with the \r\nauthority of both national and international law.\r\nThis year, we are celebrating the tenth \r\nanniversary of the entry into force of the statute of \r\nthe International Criminal Court, and with it the \r\nbeginning of the end of impunity at the international \r\nlevel. In that regard, we welcome the issuing this year \r\nof the first judgment by the Court in the case of The \r\nProsecutor — which I am happy to identify as the \r\ninternational community — v. Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, \r\nas well as the conclusion of the appeal, which is now \r\nin the sentencing stage. This shows us the important \r\nwork carried out by the Court, whose results are clear \r\nto see. We therefore support the swift ratification of the \r\namendments to the statute of the Court adopted at the \r\nKampala Review Conference.\r\nOur country views with satisfaction the fact that the \r\nmembership of the Court has grown significantly since \r\nthe signing of the Rome Treaty. We welcome Guatemala \r\nfor having recently brought the number of member \r\nStates to 121. We extend our congratulations likewise \r\nto Cape Verde, Maldives, the Philippines and Vanuatu. \r\nThe total is approaching two thirds of the membership \r\nof the United Nations. We hope that this trend will \r\ncontinue and accelerate so that the membership of the \r\ntwo organizations can be equal in the not-too-distant \r\nfuture and that the jurisdiction of the Court can thereby \r\nextend fully to all of humankind.\r\nWith regard to those cases referred to the Court \r\nby the Security Council, we are satisfied that this \r\nUnited Nations A/67/PV.32\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-seventh session\r\n32nd plenary meeting\r\nTuesday, 6 November 2012, 3 p.m.\r\nNew York\r\nOffi cial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Jeremić  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Serbia)\r\n2 12-57593\r\nA/67/PV.32\r\npractice has been put to good use, and we support its \r\ncontinuation. We see the impact of armed conflicts and \r\nincreasing instances of grave human rights violations \r\ncontinue to be of great concern. In turn, we believe that \r\nthe Security Council should act in a consistent manner \r\nwhen faced with similar situations or cases.\r\nWe cannot hope for the Council to feel bound by its \r\nprior actions since it is not a judicial but a political organ. \r\nHowever, as the body to which the Charter entrusts the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security on \r\nbehalf of the international community as a whole, the \r\nCouncil should act responsibly and non-selectively in \r\nall situations where peace is threatened. We therefore \r\nagree with the group of countries that believes it is \r\nappropriate to request the Security Council to refer the \r\nviolations of human rights in Syria to the Court so that \r\ntheir perpetrators can be duly tried, regardless of who \r\nthey are or whom they represent.\r\nIn that context, we recall the proposal of the \r\ngroup, known as the five small nations, included in \r\na draft resolution this year (A/66/L.42/Rev.2), which \r\nrecommended that the permanent members of the \r\nSecurity Council refrain from using a veto to block \r\nCouncil action aimed at preventing or ending genocide, \r\nwar crimes and crimes against humanity.\r\nWe understand, that in accordance with the \r\nprovisions of article 115 (b) of the Rome Statute, the \r\nUnited Nations is obliged to contribute to expenses \r\nincurred in referrals that the Organization makes \r\nthrough the Security Council, in order to share the \r\nfinancial burden of international criminal justice. \r\nAccordingly, we hope that in keeping with article 13 \r\nof the Relationship Agreement between the two bodies, \r\nwe will see the earliest possible conclusion to the \r\narrangements that will enable such cooperation to be \r\nimplemented.\r\nOn that basis, and in conclusion, we believe that \r\nthe existing cooperation between the Security Council \r\nand the Court should be deepened, involving the \r\nestablishment of some kind of follow-up mechanism for \r\ncases referred to the Court by the Council.\r\nMr. Panin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): \r\nWe thank the President of the International Criminal \r\nCourt (ICC), Mr. Sang-Hyun Song, for his report \r\n(see A/67/308), and we welcome Ms. Fatou Bensouda to \r\nher position as Prosecutor of the Court.\r\nToday’s meeting coincides with the tenth \r\nanniversary of the founding of the ICC. We therefore \r\nhave more than sufficient grounds for taking initial \r\nstock of its activities. Over the past 10 years, the \r\nCourt has succeeded in earning a certain degree of \r\nauthority and occupying a unique niche in the system of \r\ninternational bodies. A significant event in its history \r\nwas the issuing of its first judgment in the case of \r\nThe Prosecutor v. Thomas Lubanga Dyilo.\r\nIt has not managed to do so without problems, \r\nhowever, the source of most of which can be traced to \r\nthe Rome Statute itself, which unfortunately is not a \r\ndocument of compromise. In particular, with respect \r\nto the issue of implementing arrest warrants issued by \r\nthe ICC, the problem of States’ cooperation with the \r\nCourt is at front and centre today. We hope that its \r\ndifficulties will embolden the ICC and that in such \r\na complex situation it can find the strength to fulfil \r\nits mandate effectively and impartially. Clearly, the \r\nmanner in which it addresses that task will ultimately \r\ndetermine whether it will become a universal body of \r\ninternational criminal justice.\r\nFor us, the decisive question relating to the ICC \r\nremains the recent incorporation of crimes of aggression \r\ninto its Statute. We are troubled by the fact that the \r\nKampala compromise does not take fully into account \r\nthe Charter prerogatives of the Security Council. \r\nWe feel  that it would be extremely undesirable if \r\nsituations were to arise where the Court would exercise \r\njurisdiction over crimes of aggression in the absence of \r\nan appropriate determination by the Security Council \r\nwith respect to the existence of such a crime on the part \r\nof the relevant State.\r\nMrs. Martínez Lievano (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nMexico thanks the President of the International \r\nCriminal Court for his presentation of its annual report \r\n(see A/67/308). We also welcome Ms. Fatou Bensouda, \r\nthe Prosecutor of the Court, and wish her every success \r\nin her work. One hundred and twenty-one States have \r\njoined forces towards their shared goal of international \r\ncriminal justice.\r\nTen years after the entry into force of the Rome \r\nStatute, there is no doubt that the Court has made \r\nsignificant progress in its efforts to fight impunity \r\nfor international crimes, demonstrated by its first-\r\never judgment and sentencing this year, as well as \r\nthe imminent conclusion of other highly important \r\ncases. Similarly, the clear progress made in other cases \r\nbefore the Court and the referral of other situations \r\n12-57593 3\r\nA/67/PV.32\r\ndemonstrate not only the consolidation of the system \r\ncreated by the Statute but also the growing credibility \r\nand confidence placed in it.\r\nDespite that progress, the Court’s tenth anniversary \r\nalso offers an opportunity to assess the main challenges \r\nit faces. We have called on the remaining States to ratify \r\nthe Statute as soon as possible in order to solidify that \r\nimportant instrument’s universality.\r\nMy delegation reiterates that States’ cooperation \r\nwith the Court is fundamental to its successful \r\nfunctioning. Twelve of the 19 arrest warrants issued by \r\nthe Court are still awaiting execution, despite the fact \r\nthat in some cases the whereabouts of the individuals is \r\nwidely known. Mexico laments the lack of cooperation \r\nwith the Court, implicit and explicit, that some States \r\nhave displayed, thereby undermining the system’s \r\neffectiveness and perpetuating unacceptable impunity \r\nregarding their crimes. The States parties to the \r\nStatute are obliged to comply with such requests, and \r\nthat obligation also applies to those States that are not \r\nparty to the Statute that are the subjects of referrals for \r\nsituations by the Security Council.\r\nMexico is and has been an active supporter of the \r\nCourt. We are pleased to announce that this year, as in \r\nprevious years, Mexico again introduced a resolution \r\nin the Organization of American States promoting the \r\nratification and implementation of the Statute, and \r\ncooperation with the Court, on the part of the countries \r\nof the region. The resolution was adopted by consensus.\r\nLastly, my delegation would like emphasize an issue \r\nof vital importance to the effective consolidation of the \r\nCourt, which is the allocation of sufficient resources. We \r\ncannot expect the Court to respond efficiently to more \r\ncases with fewer resources, the lack of which could lead \r\nto denial of justice for crimes of enormous significance \r\nto the international community. We therefore appeal \r\nfor the Court to be sufficiently financed to allow it to \r\ncomply effectively with its mandate. Mexico will make \r\na constructive contribution in this regard at the next \r\nAssembly of the States Parties to the Statute.\r\nMr. Errázuriz (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): I take \r\nthis opportunity to express the Chilean delegation’s \r\nappreciation to the President of the International \r\nCriminal Court, Judge Sang-Hyun Song, for the \r\ncomprehensive report he presented for the period \r\n1 August 2011 to 31 July 2012 (A/67/308). The heavy \r\nresponsibilities of the International Criminal Court and \r\nits work are worth emphasizing to the international \r\ncommunity.\r\nFor Chile, the International Criminal Court \r\ntoday represents the most advanced expression of the \r\ninternational criminal justice system and one of the \r\nmost important initiatives we have seen in recent years.\r\nIn the domain of the protection of human rights, the \r\nCourt’s creation represented great progress in the fight \r\nagainst impunity. It clearly demonstrates that the States \r\nparties and the international community are committed \r\nto that path. \r\nAccordingly, Chile firmly supports the work \r\nof the International Criminal Court and takes this \r\nopportunity to underscore the tenth anniversary of the \r\nRome Statute’s entry into force. Likewise, we highly \r\nappreciate the first judgment ever issued by the Court, \r\nin the case of The Prosecutor v. Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, \r\nthis year. We also highlight the seven investigations \r\nunder way, which represent the Court’s functionality. \r\nWe believe it important that, in fulfilling its \r\nmandate, the Court receive the material and human \r\nresources necessary  to its judicial work and important \r\nfunctions. We are convinced that the relationship \r\nbetween the International Criminal Court and the \r\nUnited Nations, through the General Assembly and the \r\nSecurity Council, promotes the rule of law, encourages \r\nrespect for human rights and contributes to achieving \r\ninternational peace and security, in accordance with \r\ninternational law and the purposes and principles of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations.\r\nWe take this opportunity to mention an important \r\nmatter, namely, the link between the Security Council \r\nand the International Criminal Court, and specifically \r\nthe powers of the former to refer situations or defer \r\ninvestigations, pursuant to articles 13 and 16 of the \r\nRome Statute. In that respect, it is our opinion that \r\nthe Security Council should exercise its power to \r\nrefer situations or defer investigations on the basis of \r\nconsistent criteria in order to show that such decisions \r\nare not arbitrary. Furthermore, we are convinced that, \r\nin addition to backing those decisions, the Council \r\nshould follow up its referrals to the Court while paying \r\nspecial attention to issues involving non-cooperation. \r\nIt would also be appropriate, when the Council refers \r\na case to the International Criminal Court, for the \r\nGeneral Assembly to evaluate the case to ensure that \r\nthe Court has the resources necessary to take on such \r\nreferral.\r\n4 12-57593\r\nA/67/PV.32\r\nWe reiterate that the cornerstone of the Rome \r\nStatute is the principle of complementarity, whereby the \r\nessential obligation of national courts is to investigate, \r\nprosecute and punish those responsible for the most \r\nserious international crimes under the terms of the \r\nRome Statute. Along those lines, the International \r\nCriminal Court is called upon to intervene in those \r\ncases in which crimes have been committed in States \r\nthat are not in a position or lack the will to undertake \r\nthe proposed judicial proceedings. In that regard, we \r\nbelieve that cooperation with the International Criminal \r\nCourt is a fundamental part of its work. For that reason, \r\nat the High-level Meeting on the Rule of Law at the \r\nNational and International Levels of 24 September (see \r\nA/67/PV.3), my country pledged to develop legislation \r\non cooperation with the International Criminal Court. \r\nWe appeal to States that have not yet done so to \r\nbecome party to the Rome Statute in order to advance \r\nits universality. Nonetheless, we underscore that there \r\nare now 121 States parties. We also call upon the States \r\nparties to adopt the amendments of the Rome Statute \r\nthat were adopted at Kampala in 2010. We also note that \r\nour country is working towards that goal.\r\nIn conclusion, it is timely to reiterate our \r\nappreciation for the commendable work of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court, as well as for its valuable \r\ncontribution to the fight against impunity.\r\nMs. Intelmann (Estonia): I am speaking in my \r\ncapacity as President of the Assembly of States Parties \r\nto the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court \r\nand as Estonia’s Ambassador-at-large. In making this \r\nstatement, Estonia aligns itself with the statement \r\ndelivered on behalf of the European Union.\r\nI would like to thank the President of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court for his report on the \r\nCourt’s activities (A/67/308). On 1 July, the Court and \r\nits States parties commemorated the tenth anniversary \r\nof the entry into force of the Rome Statute. The report \r\nreflects just how far the level of the Court’s activities \r\nhas risen during that time, and what an indispensable \r\ntool it has become in the fight against the worst crimes \r\nunder international law: genocide, war crimes and \r\ncrimes against humanity.\r\nIt has been an important year. On 14 March, the \r\nCourt rendered the first verdict in its history, in the \r\ncase of The Prosecutor v. Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, \r\nfinding Mr. Lubanga Dyilo guilty of recruiting and \r\nusing child soldiers and subsequently sentencing him \r\nto 14 years of imprisonment. Already, the case has had \r\nan impact in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and \r\nbeyond its borders. The Special Representative of the \r\nSecretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict \r\nhas stated that parties to conflicts as far away from the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo as Nepal have taken \r\nnote of the case and adjusted their behaviour for the \r\nbetter. \r\nAlthough I should note that a number of final \r\nappeals are still pending, the Court and States parties \r\nare already working together to engage in a lessons-\r\nlearned exercise to ensure that all measures are taken \r\nto make future trials more efficient. \r\nI should also like to note that on 10 July, Trial \r\nChamber I made its first-ever decision on reparations, \r\nestablishing the principles to apply to the reparations \r\nprocedure that will now be used to shape the process of \r\ngranting reparations to Mr. Lubanga’s victims. \r\nThe International Criminal Court was the first \r\nto incorporate an element of reparative justice in its \r\nproceedings — it is a key part of what makes the Rome \r\nStatute unique. Even in cases such as the present, in \r\nwhich the convicted person has no assets to be used, \r\nthe Trust Fund for Victims, utilizing States parties’ \r\nvoluntary contributions, can have an impact on the \r\nreparations process. The effective implementation of \r\nthose reparations through the Trust Fund for Victims \r\nwill be a key step in showing victims that they were \r\nright to place their trust in the Court.\r\nAs we speak today, there are 121 States parties to \r\nthe Rome Statute. Since our last meeting on the subject, \r\nVanuatu and Guatemala have joined the family of States \r\nparties. Throughout this tenth anniversary year, I have \r\nhad the pleasure of meeting officials, parliamentarians \r\nand representatives of civil society from a number of \r\nnon-States parties, particularly from the Pacific region \r\nand from Africa, including North Africa, in order \r\nto encourage them to ratify or accede to the Rome \r\nStatute. My message in the meetings has always been \r\nthe same — the Court’s record speaks for itself. It has \r\nproved itself to be the most effective international \r\njudicial institution in the fight against impunity for \r\nthe most serious crimes under international law, acting \r\nas a court of last resort in numerous situations where \r\nnational judicial systems have been unwilling or unable \r\nto investigate and prosecute. \r\nIn 2002, the International Criminal Court was a \r\ngood idea; in 2012, we see a Court that has been able to \r\n12-57593 5\r\nA/67/PV.32\r\nexecute that good idea in a professional and independent \r\nmanner. Few if any of the fears that States had before \r\nthe entry into force of the Rome Statute have proved \r\nthemselves true. Instead, joining the Rome Statute has \r\nbecome part of the acquis of international law — a key \r\nway for any State to demonstrate its commitment to the \r\nfight against impunity in a meaningful way. \r\nI call on all States that have not yet done so to ratify \r\nor accede to the Rome Statue.\r\nThe Rome Statute is a system built on State \r\ncooperation. As the report before us notes, cooperation \r\nby States parties is generally very good. Nevertheless, \r\ncooperation in perhaps its most crucial form — the \r\narrest and surrender of persons against whom warrants \r\nof arrest have been issued by the Court — leaves room \r\nfor improvement. More than 10 such individuals are \r\ncurrently at large. As was noted by several speakers \r\nin the Security Council open debate (see S/PV.6849), \r\ncooperation is especially difficult in situations that \r\nhave been referred to the Court by the Security Council. \r\nVoluntary commitment to the Rome Statute is \r\nthe driving force behind cooperation; those States \r\ncompelled by the Security Council to cooperate with \r\nthe Court have made no such commitment. Especially \r\nin those cases, effective follow-up by the Security \r\nCouncil is necessary to ensure that its own resolutions \r\nare enforced and that the Court receives the cooperation \r\nit requires. In that regard, I should like to point out that \r\nthe Assembly of States Parties has adopted procedures \r\nto follow in cases of non-cooperation, which were \r\nactivated for the first time this year. The Assembly is \r\nalso working to assist and advise States on all aspects \r\nof cooperation with the Court.\r\nIt is crucial for international organizations, \r\nincluding the United Nations, to avoid non-essential \r\ncontacts with persons against whom warrants of arrest \r\nhave been issued by the ICC.\r\nThe International Criminal Court is a court of \r\nlast resort. States have the primary responsibility for \r\ninvestigating and prosecuting those who have committed \r\nthe worst crimes under international law. Indeed, States \r\nparties are discussing, within the framework of positive \r\ncomplementarity, the steps they can take to assist one \r\nanother in fulfilling their primary responsibility. In that \r\nmatter, interaction with United Nations development \r\nactors and civil society is important. The experience \r\nof the past 10 years has proved, however, that it does \r\noccasionally become necessary for the ICC to step in. \r\nInstances of genocide, war crimes and crimes \r\nagainst humanity should not remain unpunished; \r\nneither should the crime of aggression. I am pleased \r\nthat, this year, the first two States parties have ratified \r\nthe amendments to the Rome Statute on that crime. My \r\nown country, Estonia, has pledged to pursue ratification \r\nof the amendments on the crime of aggression and on \r\narticle 8 by the end of 2013. I call on other States parties \r\nto do the same. States newly joining the Rome Statute \r\nshould consider joining the Statute, including both of \r\nthe Kampala amendments.\r\nMy country remains a steadfast supporter of \r\nthe International Criminal Court. It fulfils its legal \r\nobligations to the Court and supports it politically. We \r\nare proud of the Court’s achievements over the past 10 \r\nyears, but it is clear that such success depends on the \r\npolitical support of States Parties. States that have not \r\nyet joined the Statute also have many opportunities to \r\nsupport the fight against impunity.\r\nMr. Motanyane (Lesotho): Allow me at the outset \r\nto thank the President of the International Criminal \r\nCourt (ICC) for the informative and comprehensive \r\nreport covering the work of the Court over the past year \r\n(A/67/308). The report comes at a most befitting time, \r\nwhen the Court is celebrating 10 years of existence. It \r\nis an opportunity for us to reflect upon and consolidate \r\nthe achievements made by the Court in the past decade \r\nand to carefully assess prospects for the future.\r\nThe conviction that peace and justice are inextricably \r\nintertwined has always underpinned the efforts of \r\nthe United Nations in the area of the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security. The adoption of the \r\nConvention on the Prevention and Punishment of the \r\nCrime of Genocide in 1948, and the creation of ad hoc \r\ninternational criminal tribunals to try perpetrators of \r\nthe most heinous crimes, are some of the beacons that \r\nhighlight this truism. Indeed, the creation of the ICC \r\nin 1998 was a clear manifestation of the international \r\ncommunity’s desire to pursue a peaceful and just world.\r\nIn our view, the ICC remains a concrete expression \r\nof our collective aspiration to ensure justice for victims \r\nof atrocities and to end impunity for perpetrators of \r\nthe most serious crimes through a law-based system. \r\nIn recent years, we have witnessed the steady growth \r\nof political and diplomatic support for the ICC. That \r\nis ostensibly a genuine reflection of the international \r\ncommunity’s increasing rejection of impunity, and \r\nevidence that there is a rising tide in favour of the rule \r\nof law. \r\n6 12-57593\r\nA/67/PV.32\r\nWith the accession of Guatemala in April, there \r\nare now 121 States parties to the Rome Statute, which \r\nis clearly an indication that the ICC has become a \r\nthriving and independent judicial body that enjoys even \r\nbroader support. We welcome the new member to the \r\nICC family, and call on those States not yet party to the \r\nRome Statute to consider joining us in the fight to end \r\nimpunity.\r\nThe report of the ICC on the past year indicates that \r\nthe workload of the Court has continued to grow. Despite \r\nthat fact, it is gratifying to note that significant judicial \r\nprogress was made by the Court during the reporting \r\nperiod. Of particular interest to my delegation is the \r\nhanding down of the first judgment and sentence of the \r\nCourt since its creation, in the case of The Prosecutor \r\nv. Thomas Lubanga Dyilo. In addition, the continuation \r\nof investigations and judicial processes in seven other \r\nsituations, as well as the referral of an eighth matter \r\nby a State party, testify to the fact that the Court has \r\nindeed entered a new era of justice delivery. \r\nFurthermore, we welcome the following important \r\ninstitutional developments: the swearing-in of Ms. Fatou \r\nBensouda as the first female Prosecutor of the Court, \r\nthe election of six new judges, and the assumption of \r\noffice by the new President of the Assembly of States \r\nParties. We are pleased that the process of selecting \r\nthe candidates for the position of Deputy Prosecutor \r\nhas produced three eminently qualified candidates. \r\nUndoubtedly, the candidate who will be elected by \r\nthe Assembly of States Parties will be a welcome \r\ncomplement to the Office of the Prosecutor, during the \r\nnext phase of the Court’s development.\r\nWe are convinced that in order for the Court \r\nto achieve its mandate, it must benefit from the \r\nunwavering support and cooperation of the international \r\ncommunity and relevant international organizations. \r\nThat view was reiterated by the General Assembly in \r\nSeptember when it adopted a Declaration on the rule \r\nof law (resolution 67/1) that, inter alia, recognizes the \r\nimportance of cooperation with the Court by all States \r\nMembers of the United Nations. \r\nLesotho appreciates the difficulties that \r\nnon-execution of requests for cooperation can have \r\non the ability of the Court to fulfil its mandate. We \r\nshall therefore continue to advocate for cooperation \r\nby all States parties with the Court. However, full \r\ncooperation with the Court will continue to elude us if \r\nwe do not ensure that it is adequately insulated against \r\npoliticization. We must guarantee that there is enough \r\nprotection against politicized prosecution and other \r\nabuses. Double standards would degrade the integrity \r\nof the Court.\r\nIf the faith of the international community in the \r\nCourt is to be sustained, selective prosecutions must be \r\navoided; charges must be preferred against the mighty \r\nand the weak, against the rich and the poor, alike. By \r\nthe same token, we need to strengthen the checks and \r\nbalances mechanisms in order to enhance faith in the \r\nCourt and thereby promote the cooperation and support \r\nof all Member States.\r\nThe ICC enjoys a special legal relationship with \r\nthe Security Council. The Council is empowered \r\nto refer cases to the Court under the Rome Statute. \r\nIt also has a right to request, in deserving cases, a \r\nstay of proceedings for a certain period of time, for \r\nindividuals against whom charges have been preferred. \r\nThat arrangement has encouraged perceptions that the \r\nCourt is susceptible to abuse by the Council. The only \r\nway to thwart such perceptions is for that relationship \r\nto be carefully nurtured in a manner that preserves the \r\nindependence and integrity of the Court. It is only when \r\nthe Court is truly independent that it will be able to be \r\neffective, exercise fairness and enjoy legitimacy. \r\nThere is no doubt that an ICC that is not only \r\nindependent, but also seen to be independent, will \r\nencourage more cooperation from all stakeholders and \r\npromote the universal ratification of the Rome Statute.\r\nWe must never forget that the principle of \r\ncomplementarity lies at the heart of the creation of the \r\nICC. Ideally, it is States themselves that have the primary \r\nresponsibility to prosecute crimes committed in their \r\nterritory or by their nationals. The ICC is designed to \r\ncomplement existing national judicial systems and to \r\nact as a necessary accountability safety net in situations \r\nwhere States do not fulfil their obligations. As such, \r\nit is only in situations where a State is unwilling \r\nor for some reason unable to prosecute a matter that \r\nrecourse should be had to the ICC. There is therefore a \r\nneed to strengthen national criminal justice systems to \r\ncompetently deal with perpetrators of the most heinous \r\ncrimes, which will help to alleviate both the workload \r\non the Court and the attendant costs to States parties.\r\nOne of the characteristics that make the ICC a sui \r\ngeneris court is that it is the first international criminal \r\ncourt with the power to order individuals to pay \r\nreparation to victims. That is an ingenious innovation \r\nthat must be put to use efficiently. It is the hope of my \r\n12-57593 7\r\nA/67/PV.32\r\ndelegation that once cases have been completed and \r\nthose accused have been found guilty, the reparations \r\nprocess will be undertaken without undue delay. \r\nThat will undoubtedly go a long way towards helping \r\nvictims’ scars to heal even faster.\r\nAllow me to conclude by reiterating Lesotho’s \r\nfirm and long-standing commitment to the integrity \r\nof the Rome Statute and to an effective and credible \r\nInternational Criminal Court. A robust international \r\ncriminal justice system is an ideal that we must \r\nachieve and, indeed, the best hope that we can offer to \r\nvictims of the most atrocious crimes. Let us resolve to \r\nfurther strengthen the ICC in its capacity to effectively \r\nimplement its mandate.\r\nMs. Dwarika (South Africa): My delegation \r\ncongratulates Judge Song on his reappointment as \r\nPresident of the International Criminal Court (ICC). \r\nWe thank him for his statement (see A/67/PV.29), as \r\nwell as for the report of the ICC to the United Nations \r\n(A/67/308).\r\nAllow me to take the opportunity to congratulate \r\nall of the judges who were elected during the most \r\nrecent session of the Assembly of States Parties to the \r\nICC. We also congratulate Ambassador Intelmann on \r\nher assumption of the presidency of the Assembly of \r\nStates Parties. \r\nIt gives us particular pleasure to congratulate \r\nMs. Fatou Bensouda on her election, by consensus, to \r\nthe position of Chief Prosecutor of the International \r\nCriminal Court. We wish her well as she embarks on \r\nwhat we are certain will be a challenging but ultimately \r\nsuccessful nine-year term.\r\nSince the delivery of our statement last year under \r\nthis agenda item (see A/66/PV.44), two new States \r\nhave become party to the Rome Statute. We welcome \r\nVanuatu and Guatemala to the Rome Statute family and \r\nlook forward to working closely with them.\r\nOver and above the institutional developments, \r\nmuch has happened in terms of the fight against \r\nimpunity, in general, and the International Criminal \r\nCourt in particular. This year, the United Nations has \r\nbeen correctly concerned with promotion of the rule of \r\nlaw. On 19 January, the Security Council held a debate \r\non the rule of law in the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security (see S/PV.6705). The presidential \r\nstatement adopted that day (S/PRST/2012/1) stressed the \r\nimportance of the fight against impunity in promoting \r\nthe rule of law and recalled the ICC’s significant \r\ncontribution to the fight against impunity. Similarly, \r\non 24 September, Heads of State and Government \r\nadopted a Declaration that recognized “the role of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court in a multilateral system \r\nthat aims to end impunity and establish the rule of law” \r\n(resolution 67/1, para. 23). On 17 October the Security \r\nCouncil held a debate (see S/PV.6849) that focused on \r\nthe rule of law and the role of the ICC in that regard. \r\nAll of those actions reflect the growing acceptance of \r\nthe important role played by the ICC in promoting and \r\nstrengthening of the rule of law.\r\nWe have taken note of the important developments \r\nin the work of the ICC. We are particularly pleased that \r\nthe Court has issued its first judgment in the case of \r\nThe Prosecutor v. Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, and has also \r\nissued its first judgments on the issue of reparations \r\nfor victims. We have also noted that the trial in the \r\ncase of The Prosecutor v. Germain Katanga and \r\nMathieu Ngudjolo Chui Katanga has been completed, \r\nand we await the judgment of the Court.\r\nMy delegation notes with some satisfaction the \r\ncooperation among the various organs of the Court, \r\nStates, international organizations and civil society. \r\nNonetheless, we remain concerned about the high \r\nincidence of non-cooperation relating not only to cases \r\nof non-execution of outstanding arrest warrants, but \r\nalso to recent events surrounding the detention of ICC \r\nstaff members.\r\nAs in the past, we have taken note of the situations \r\nunder preliminary analysis by the Prosecutor. In our \r\nprevious statements, we have called upon the Office \r\nof the Prosecutor to consider these cases, with the \r\nrequisite urgency, and come to a decision as soon as \r\npossible, particularly on those situations that have been \r\npending for a long period of time. \r\nNonetheless, we do wish to express our concern \r\nabout the manner in which the decision on Palestine was \r\nmade. Given the passage of time, developments within \r\nthe United Nations system, including on the admission \r\nof Palestine as a member to the UNESCO and the sheer \r\nnumber of States, including States parties, that have \r\nrecognized Palestine, we were disappointed by the \r\nunwillingness of the Office of the Prosecutor to make \r\na firm decision.\r\nWe wish to highlight the importance of strengthening \r\nthe relationship between the United Nations and the \r\nICC, in accordance with the Relationship Agreement. \r\nWe note in that regard that when the Security Council \r\n8 12-57593\r\nA/67/PV.32\r\nestablished to dispense justice without partiality as to \r\nwho may be involved in abuse or gross violations of \r\nhuman rights. The objective of the ICC is based on the \r\nconcept that justice transcends the confines of national \r\nboundaries, that impunity must be challenged, and \r\nthat all are accountable for their actions regardless of \r\nstatus or location. The Court has fulfilled its mandates \r\nunder trying and sometimes difficult circumstances. \r\nIts actions in ensuring that its mandates are effectively \r\ndischarged are commendable. We believe that the \r\nICC stands for ensuring that the cherished principle \r\nof accountability, which helps sustain effective and \r\nlasting peace and security, is maintained.\r\nThe cooperation of States, international \r\norganizations and civil society is vital to the Court’s \r\nability to continue to discharge its role, as enshrined \r\nin the Rome Statute. To further deepen and strengthen \r\nthat function, it is imperative that unhindered access \r\nfor proper investigations, the execution of outstanding \r\nwarrants, the protection of witnesses, the enforcement \r\nof sentences and the surrender of persons indicted for \r\nwar crimes be complied with expeditiously in order \r\nto prevent the future occurrence of crimes. Most \r\nimportantly, it is essential that contributions be made \r\nto the Trust Fund established for the benefit of victims \r\nof crimes that fall within the jurisdiction of the Court \r\nand their families.\r\nWe wish to observe, however, that in order for the \r\nInternational Criminal Court to continue to be effective \r\nand enjoy the trust of the international community, its \r\nindictment system for war crimes should be independent \r\nand non-selective. In that regard, we encourage the \r\nICC’s greater engagement with the African Union (AU) \r\nin order to harmonize their positions and agree on \r\nactions affecting persons indicted in Africa. Rightly, \r\nthe AU Constitutive Act does not condone impunity. \r\nDiscussions with the AU would also afford both sides \r\nan opportunity to explore ways and means by which the \r\ncapacities of Member States to fight impunity would be \r\nstrengthened.\r\nIn our collective responsibility for ensuring the \r\ncredible applicability of the international criminal \r\njustice system, we must overcome such challenges as the \r\nissues of complementarity, non-cooperation, assistance \r\nto victims, reparation and the budget of the Court. \r\nEvidence shows that the number of cases referred by \r\nStates parties and referrals by the Security Council has \r\nincreased, and those that the Prosecutor of the Court \r\nhas initiated proprio motu, in accordance with the \r\nrefers a situation to the ICC, it does so on behalf of the \r\nUnited Nations as a whole. We are therefore convinced \r\nthat the United Nations should contribute financially to \r\nthe costs of investigations and prosecutions of situations \r\nreferred by the Council.\r\nIn conclusion, the International Criminal Court is \r\nan institution designed to create a better world through \r\nfighting impunity. We will continue to support the \r\nCourt so that it can grow in strength.\r\nMr. Sarki (Nigeria): On behalf of my delegation, \r\nI thank Judge Sang-Hyun Song for his participation in \r\nthe debate on this agenda item and his comprehensive \r\nreport to the General Assembly. \r\nWe congratulate Ms. Fatou Bensouda on her \r\nrecent election as Chief Prosecutor of the International \r\nCriminal Court (ICC) and wish her every success \r\nduring her tenure. We also extend our appreciation \r\nto the Secretary-General for the eighth annual report \r\non the activities of the ICC, contained in document \r\nA/67/308, submitted in accordance with article 6 of the \r\nRelationship Agreement between the United Nations \r\nand the International Criminal Court.\r\nWe welcome the progress recorded during the \r\nreporting period in the trials of individuals, with a \r\nview to strengthening international cooperation in the \r\nfight against impunity and other serious crimes, such \r\nas crimes against humanity. Nigeria welcomes the \r\ncelebration of the tenth anniversary of the ICC in July. \r\nWe also note the issuance of 22 warrants of arrests, 16 \r\ncases and seven ongoing investigations that are in the \r\npipeline. \r\nThis year marks a historic milestone towards ending \r\nimpunity. We express our appreciation to the President \r\nof the Assembly of States Parties, Ambassador Tiina \r\nIntelmann of Estonia, for her tremendous work in \r\ncoordinating all of the efforts to commemorate the \r\nanniversary, both within and outside of the Assembly \r\nof States Parties. \r\nWe note with particular appreciation the \r\nconsiderable increase in the number of States that \r\nhave become parties to the Rome Statute. There is no \r\ndoubt that the Court’s jurisdiction continues to expand \r\ntowards universal acceptance, and for that reason we \r\nurge those States that have yet to accede to or ratify the \r\ntreaty to do so without further delay.\r\nAs a signatory to the Statute, Nigeria remains \r\ncommitted to the ideals of the ICC, which was \r\n12-57593 9\r\nA/67/PV.32\r\nfor the entry into force of the Court’s jurisdiction over \r\nall the crimes included in the Statute.\r\nWe also welcome the specific and detailed reference \r\nto the Court in the outcome document of the High-level \r\nMeeting on the Rule of Law held on 24 September \r\n(resolution 67/1). This is an acknowledgement of its \r\nrole in combating impunity and an endorsement of the \r\nprimacy of law and justice.\r\nWe are also gratified by the fact that, among the \r\nvoluntary pledges made by States within the framework \r\nof that meeting, a large number — including Costa \r\nRica’s — were related to strengthening the International \r\nCriminal Court. In that regard, Costa Rica, in keeping \r\nwith its commitment, has already launched the national \r\napproval process for the amendments to the Rome \r\nStatute adopted in Kampala in 2010, and will pursue \r\nthat process with the aim of achieving ratification as \r\nsoon as possible. We urge other States parties to ratify \r\nthe amendment to article 8 and the reference to the \r\ncrime of aggression without delay, with the aim of \r\nachieving its entry into force in 2017.\r\nIn 2011, Costa Rica ratified the Agreement on \r\nPrivileges and Immunities of the Court. In view of the \r\nserious situation experienced by the Court’s officials \r\nin June, my delegation wishes to urge those States that \r\nhave not yet done so to proceed to signing and ratifying \r\nthe Agreement without delay.\r\nIt will be impossible to achieve meaningful results \r\nin the fight against impunity as long as we cannot count \r\non the individual and collective support of States, and \r\nas long as those States, whether or not they are party to \r\nthe Rome Statute, have not yet developed their judicial \r\nand criminal investigation systems to a level where \r\nthe principle of complementarity can be effectively \r\nimplemented.\r\nAnother subject that has us very concerned is \r\nthe repeated failure of some States parties to comply \r\nwith their clear and compelling responsibilities under \r\nthe Rome State. What is especially serious is the fact \r\nthat such failure to comply is reflected in the refusal \r\nto execute arrest warrants in force. At present, there \r\nare 11 outstanding arrest warrants, four of which were \r\nissued seven years ago. There is no valid legal reason \r\nfor persisting with such behaviour, particularly given \r\nthe defiance implied in a State party’s reception on \r\nits territory of individuals who are the subject of such \r\narrest warrants.\r\nRome Statute, require funding of expenses related to \r\ninvestigations or prosecutions. We take this opportunity \r\nto call on all States and the Security Council to consider \r\nmaking voluntary contributions to alleviate the Court’s \r\nexpenses, or to increase their contributions in order to \r\ndefray such costs. Above all, the cooperation of States \r\nthat are not parties to the Rome Statute is absolutely \r\nnecessary. Close cooperation and consultation between \r\nthe United Nations and the ICC are also indispensable \r\nin this context.\r\nEarlier this year, Nigeria acceded to the Rome \r\nStatute. In doing so, we were mindful of our international \r\nobligations and our commitment to ending impunity \r\nand upholding the rule of law. This also demonstrates \r\nour willingness to discourage any form of or support \r\nfor impunity, and recognizes the ICC’s important \r\ncontribution to the fight against impunity for the most \r\nserious crimes. In that context, my Government, through \r\nits judiciary, has put in place the machinery necessary \r\nto end the insurgency of the Boko Haram terrorist group \r\nin our country. The Government is already working on \r\ninvestigating and prosecuting any such crimes through \r\nappropriate domestic bodies, in accordance with our \r\njudicial requirements and standards.\r\nFinally, the election in December 2011 of Nigeria’s \r\ncandidate Chile Eboe-Osuji as a Judge of the ICC gives \r\ncredence to our commitment to the pursuit of peace and \r\nrespect for human rights and the rule of law, in Africa \r\nand around the world. It is a testament to Nigeria’s role \r\nin supporting global peace and stability in the comity \r\nof nations. We therefore reaffirm our continued support \r\nand commitment to the objectives of the International \r\nCriminal Court.\r\nMr. Weisleder (Costa Rica) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nCosta Rica thanks Judge Song for presenting the report \r\nof the International Criminal Court (A/67/308), in \r\naccordance with article 6 of the Relationship Agreement \r\nbetween the United Nations and the International \r\nCriminal Court.\r\nOn the tenth anniversary of the Court’s creation, \r\nwhich was undoubtedly one of the most important \r\nachievements of multilateralism, Costa Rica welcomes \r\nthe increase in the number of States parties to the \r\nCourt, and particularly welcomes the fact that the \r\nmost recent addition came from our Central American \r\nregion with Guatemala’s ratification in April. My \r\ncountry is committed to continuing to work for the \r\nuniversalization and integrity of the Rome Statute, and \r\n10 12-57593\r\nA/67/PV.32\r\nAnother issue that warrants our full attention \r\nis the financial predicament of the Court. While it is \r\ntrue that we are facing a difficult global economic \r\nsituation, we cannot allow any of the functions of the \r\nCourt to be undermined by budgetary restrictions. The \r\nactivities of the Court have increased substantially as a \r\nconsequence both of the gravity of violations of human \r\nrights and dignity, and of greater recognition of its \r\njurisdiction. That is reflected in its operating costs and \r\nin the implementation of all its programmes.\r\nFor 2013, the Court undertook an exercise aimed \r\nat streamlining costs and making more efficient use \r\nof its resources, which led to a sensible budget with \r\nminimal growth, notwithstanding the fact that it now \r\nhas to address the situation in Côte d’Ivoire and the new \r\ncase of Kenya. Costa Rica objects to any proposal that \r\nwould limit the Court’s scope or ability to act. For that \r\nreason, we cannot consider any zero-growth proposal \r\nin its budget, much less one that would require the \r\nCourt to absorb the new budget line related to paying \r\nthe leasehold on its headquarters. \r\nThe driving force of the Court should remain the \r\nquest for justice, an end to impunity for the worst \r\ncrimes, and care for victims, without overlooking its \r\noutreach and information activities. The strength and \r\nquality of concern for those functions of the Court \r\nshould not be contingent on financial concerns.\r\nWith that in mind, my delegation feels that it is \r\nespecially important to trigger the implementation of \r\narticle 115(b) of the Rome Statute, pertaining to the \r\neconomic contribution of the United Nations to the \r\nCourt, especially with respect to the costs incurred by \r\ncases referred by the Security Council. To that end, we \r\nmust take into account the provisions of article 13 of \r\nthe Relationship Agreement between the Court and the \r\nUnited Nations of 4 October 2004.\r\nCosta Rica pledges to continue supporting the \r\nuniversalization, independence and integrity of the \r\nCourt so that, in conjunction with States parties, as \r\nprovided for in the preamble of the Rome Statute, \r\nwe can guarantee respect for and compliance with \r\ninternational justice. \r\nMr. Simonoff (United States of America): We \r\nwould like to thank President Song for his report \r\n(A/67/308) and for his service to the International \r\nCriminal Court (ICC). \r\nAs we stated last month in the Security Council’s \r\nopen debate on the role of the International Criminal \r\nCourt (see S/PV.6849), strengthening accountability \r\nfor those responsible for the worst atrocities remains \r\nan important priority for the United States. Although \r\nthe United States is not a party to the Rome Statute, we \r\nrecognize that the ICC can have an important role to \r\nplay in accountability. Moreover, we remain steadfast in \r\nour commitment to ensuring appropriate accountability \r\nfor those responsible for serious violations of human \r\nrights and international humanitarian law. \r\nPresident Obama has emphasized the importance \r\nof preventing mass atrocities and genocide as a core \r\nnational security interest, as well as a core moral \r\nresponsibility, of the United States. The United \r\nStates is committed to working with the international \r\ncommunity, including through the United Nations, to \r\nbring concerted international pressure to bear in order \r\nto prevent atrocities and ensure accountability for the \r\nperpetrators of those crimes. To that end, we continue \r\nto support positive complementarity initiatives by \r\nassisting countries in their efforts to develop domestic \r\naccountability processes for atrocity crimes. \r\nAccountability and peace begin with Governments \r\ntaking care of their own people. The ICC, by its nature, \r\nis designed to pursue only those accused of bearing \r\nthe greatest responsibility for the most serious crimes \r\nwithin its jurisdiction when States are not willing or \r\nable to investigate or prosecute genuinely. Thus, even \r\nwhen the ICC investigates and prosecutes, it still only \r\nserves to complement the work of States conducting \r\nnational-level prosecutions. \r\nThe international community must continue to \r\nsupport rule-of-law capacity-building initiatives to \r\nadvance transitional justice, including the creation \r\nof hybrid structures where appropriate, and must \r\ndevelop a shared approach to recurring issues, such as \r\ncoordinated and effective protection for witnesses and \r\njudicial personnel. From the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo to Côte d’Ivoire to Cambodia, the United States \r\nis supporting efforts to build fair, impartial and capable \r\nnational justice systems. At the same time, more can \r\nbe done to strengthen accountability mechanisms at the \r\ninternational level. Particularly as the ad hoc tribunals \r\nand courts draw to a close in the coming years, the ICC \r\ncan become an even more important safeguard against \r\nimpunity. \r\nWe have actively engaged with the ICC Prosecutor \r\nand Registrar to consider specific ways in which we can \r\nsupport specific prosecutions already under way and all \r\nof the situations currently before the Court. We have \r\n12-57593 11\r\nA/67/PV.32\r\nIn October, under Guatemala’s presidency, the \r\nSecurity Council held an open debate to address the \r\nrelationship between the Council and the International \r\nCriminal Court for the first time (see S/PV.6849). The \r\nstatements made during the open debate allowed us \r\nto identify important areas in which we must delve \r\ndeeper in order to strengthen the relationship between \r\nthe Organization and the International Criminal \r\nCourt. Peru focused its statement on the following \r\nfour points: the referrals of situations by the Council \r\nto the Prosecutor, pursuant to article 13 (b) of the \r\nRome Statute; the cooperative relationship of the \r\nSecurity Council and Member States with the Court; \r\nthe financing of referrals; and the amendments to the \r\nRome Statute adopted in Kampala with regard to the \r\ncrime of aggression. As we indicated on that occasion, \r\nPeru favours an evaluation of mechanisms that allow \r\nfor a comprehensive follow-up on the matters addressed \r\nin the open debate. \r\nWe must strengthen cooperation between States and \r\nthe Court so that the latter can achieve its objectives. \r\nUnfortunately, the Court does not always enjoy the \r\nnecessary support in the areas of arrest warrants, \r\nidentification, freezing of assets, and the protection \r\nof victims and witnesses, inter alia. The cooperation \r\nof States with regard to arrest warrants in particular \r\nis an obligation based on the Statute of the Court and \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations, which in the case \r\nof referrals, is applicable to all — and we reiterate \r\nall — States under Chapter VII. \r\nWe must also give full force to the Relationship \r\nAgreement between the United Nations and the \r\nInternational Criminal Courts, including budgetary \r\nmatters related to the referral of situations by the \r\nCouncil. We underscore that the Agreement has allowed \r\nthe Court to undertake important work, disseminate \r\nits work and raise the awareness of the international \r\ncommunity with regard to its importance. We trust \r\nthat cooperation will become ever closer and more \r\ncoordinated. In that way, the Court can receive the \r\nsupport of United Nations bodies and agencies in the \r\ndischarge of its duties. \r\nThe International Criminal Court plays an \r\nimportant role in promoting the rule of law, as it is the \r\nonly permanent judicial body tasked with investigating \r\nand judging those allegedly responsible for the most \r\nserious international crimes. Along those lines, the \r\nrecent Declaration of the High-level Meeting of the \r\nGeneral Assembly on the Rule of Law at the National \r\nresponded positively to a number of informal requests \r\nfor assistance. We will also continue to work with the \r\nICC to identify practical ways in which we can work \r\nto advance our mutual goals, particularly in areas such \r\nas information-sharing and witness protection, on a \r\ncase-by-case basis and consistent with United States \r\npolicy and laws. We look forward to continuing to \r\nengage with States parties and non-party States on those \r\nand other shared issues of concern. The international \r\ncommunity should remain committed to working \r\ntowards coordinated efforts both to prevent atrocities \r\nbefore they occur and to provide accountability for \r\nthose responsible for atrocities that do happen. \r\nAlthough we as an international community have \r\nmade progress on both fronts, much work remains. \r\nThe United States, as a member of this body and a \r\npermanent member of the Security Council, remains \r\ncommitted to working in partnership with others \r\nto achieve those twin goals. We look forward to our \r\nupcoming participation as an observer at meetings of \r\nthe ICC’s Assembly of States Parties in The Hague later \r\nthis month.\r\nMr. Bonifaz (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): I wish to thank \r\nthe President of the International Criminal Court (ICC), \r\nJudge Sang-Hyun Song, for his interesting presentation \r\non the intensive work of the Court from 1 August 2011 to \r\n31 July 2012.\r\nIn the year covered by the report, there were \r\nimportant developments in the work of the Court. First, \r\nGuatemala, Cape Verde, Maldives, the Philippines \r\nand Vanuatu ratified the Rome Statute, bringing \r\nmembership to 121 States parties. That is encouraging, \r\nbut numerous States have yet to ratify or accede to the \r\nStatute. For that reason, Peru calls on those States that \r\nhave yet to do so to ratify or accede to the Statute so that \r\nit can enjoy truly universal scope and prevent impunity \r\nfor crimes of the greatest importance and gravity for \r\nthe entire international community. \r\nSecondly, the month of July saw the tenth \r\nanniversary of the entry into force of the Rome Statute, \r\nwhich was a landmark in the history of the Court and the \r\nfight against impunity. In that regard, I note that on that \r\nimportant anniversary, the Union of South American \r\nNations issued a statement through which the Ministers \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of its member States reiterated, on \r\nthe occasion of the anniversary, their decided support \r\nfor the Court and pledged to work to strengthen it.\r\n12 12-57593\r\nA/67/PV.32\r\nservice of political and interventionist agendas that \r\nhave nothing whatsoever to do with ending impunity. \r\nAnd I do not believe that those delegations could have \r\nimagined at the time that the Rome Statute would \r\none day be used as a vehicle to overthrow systems \r\nof Government or to intervene in the internal affairs \r\nof States. None of the jurists who participated in \r\ndrafting the Rome Statute would have thought that the \r\nquestion of the definition of the crime of aggression \r\nwould be diluted in the service of the aggressive State \r\nand that it would be a matter subject to interpretation, \r\naccording to the interests of some influential States \r\nand their followers. Nor could they have dreamed that \r\nStates which carry out simultaneously all of those \r\ncrimes that are subject to the jurisdiction of the Court \r\nwould exclude themselves or would be excluded from \r\naccountability and punishment, and that their conduct \r\nwould be overlooked out of considerations that are \r\nin total contradiction to the principles of justice and \r\nequality. \r\nIt is a source of concern that some would hide behind \r\nthe idea of international criminal justice in order to \r\nimplement political agendas that are far removed from \r\nthe internationally recognized legal standards and the \r\npurposes and principles upon which the United Nations \r\nwas established. It is also regrettable that some States \r\nwould mention my country, Syria, in their statements, \r\nmanipulating this forum, this agenda item and this organ \r\nto distort the facts and make unfounded accusations in \r\nan attempt to exploit the law and misuse it in the service \r\nof a crude policy of intervention in the internal affairs \r\nof other States. We would have hoped that those States \r\nthat claim to care about impunity would themselves be \r\nguided by a spirit of international criminal justice and \r\nsend an unambiguous and unequivocal message to the \r\nStates and parties behind the crimes being carried out \r\nin Syria. \r\nMy country is confronting an unprecedented \r\nwave of premeditated terrorism and bloody violence. \r\nEverybody knows the States and the groups behind \r\nthose acts. We hear their statements in the United \r\nNations as they brag about human rights, democracy and \r\ncounter-terrorism. We do not have enough time today \r\nto revisit all the details of that wave. The Government \r\nof the Syrian Arab Republic has repeatedly explained \r\nthe details of what is happening in my country, as well \r\nas the steps it has taken to restore security, stability \r\nand the rule of law to the troubled areas. However, \r\nI reaffirm once again that, in spite of all that my \r\ncountry has faced — terrorism, violence, public and \r\nand International Levels (resolution 67/1) recognized \r\nthat meaningful role within the multilateral system \r\nand underscored the importance of States’ cooperation \r\nwith the Court. Moreover, many States have made \r\nsignificant pledges to supporting the work of the Court. \r\nIt is essential that States express without ambiguity \r\ntheir decided diplomatic support for the fight against \r\nimpunity.\r\nLastly, my delegation commends the work of the \r\nliaison office of the International Criminal Court in \r\nNew York, which facilitates coordination between the \r\nCourt and the United Nations. We also reiterate our \r\nwillingness to cooperate actively and constructively \r\nwith the International Criminal Court. \r\nMr. Adi (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nMy country participated actively in the United Nations \r\nDiplomatic Conference of Plenipotentiaries on the \r\nEstablishment of an International Criminal Court, \r\nwhich led to the adoption of the Rome Statute  in 1998. \r\nWe signed and ratified the Statute on 29 November \r\n2000.\r\nThe Rome Statute was intended to help end \r\nimpunity for the perpetrators of crimes under the \r\nCourt’s jurisdication: war crimes, genocide, crimes \r\nagainst humanity and aggression. In its preamble, the \r\nStatute affirms \r\n“the Purposes and Principles of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, and in particular that all States \r\nshall refrain from the threat or use of force against \r\nthe territorial integrity or political independence of \r\nany State, or in any other manner inconsistent with \r\nthe Purposes of the United Nations”. \r\nThe preamble also affirms that \r\n“nothing in this Statute shall be taken as authorizing \r\nany State Party to intervene in an armed conflict or \r\nin the internal affairs of any State”. \r\nMoreover, the Rome Statute reaffirms that the \r\njurisdiction of the Court is established only when the \r\nnational judicial system fails to exercise its jurisdiction. \r\nThe Statute also emphasizes the principal and primary \r\nrole of national jurisdiction in the establishment of \r\njustice in the territories and the cases subject to its \r\nmandate. \r\nI do not believe that the representatives who \r\nparticipated in the Rome Conference thought that what \r\nthey aspired to — the codification of international \r\ncriminal legislation — would one day be used in the \r\n12-57593 13\r\nA/67/PV.32\r\nIn conclusion, since this crisis began my country \r\nhas sought to inform Member States and the Secretariat \r\nin detail about the events taking place there. This has \r\nbeen done by means of more than 220 official letters \r\nissued as official United Nations documents, covering \r\nevery aspect of the crisis and the steps taken by the \r\nGovernment, as well as the negative stance assumed by \r\nsome Member States in order to prolong the crisis and \r\nspread further destruction and terrorism in my country.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on agenda item 74. The General \r\nAssembly has thus concluded its consideration of \r\nagenda item 74.\r\nThe meeting rose at 4.35 p.m.\r\ndirect incitement against Syria — the Government of \r\nSyria remains committed to implementing reforms \r\nand serious changes in response to justified popular \r\ndemands in all fields, including the legal, judicial, \r\nsocial, political and legislative.\r\nI assure the Assembly that the Syrian authorities \r\nare complying with all their legal and judicial \r\nresponsibilities in their efforts to implement the law \r\nand hold accountable all those who have violated \r\nit, regardless of their position or title. The recently \r\nestablished independent judicial commission is carrying \r\nout its work of referring to national courts all those \r\nfound to have been involved in illegal acts, in order to \r\nobserve due process while preserving all the rights of \r\nthe accused and the victims throughout all trial stages.\r\n"
