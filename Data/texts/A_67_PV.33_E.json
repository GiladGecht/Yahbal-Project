In his letter, the Permanent Representative \r\nof Australia, in his capacity as Chair of the Western \r\nEuropean and other States, announces that Australia \r\nwill relinquish its seat on the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil at the end of the year 2012 for the remainder \r\nof its term in favour of New Zealand; that Germany \r\nwill relinquish its seat on the Council, also at the end \r\nof the year 2012, for the remainder of its term in favour \r\nof Austria; that Finland will relinquish its seat on \r\nthe Council, also at the end of the year 2012, for the \r\nremainder of its term in favour of Denmark; and that \r\nSwitzerland will relinquish its seat on the Council, also \r\nat the end of the year 2012, for the remainder of its term \r\nin favour of Sweden.\r\nAs a result, four vacancies will occur and new \r\nmembers must therefore be elected to fill the unexpired \r\nterms of office of Australia, Germany, Finland and \r\nSwitzerland, commencing on 1 January 2013 and \r\nexpiring on 31 December 2013 in the case of Australia, \r\nFinland and Switzerland, and on 31 December 2014 in \r\nthe case of Germany.\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 4 of resolution 2847 \r\n(XXVI) of 20 December 1971, and taking into account \r\nthat the vacancies will occur from among the Group of \r\nWestern European and other States, the new members \r\nshould therefore be elected from that region.\r\nI should like to inform the Assembly that the \r\ncandidates who receive a two-thirds majority and the \r\ngreatest number of votes by members present and \r\nvoting will be declared elected. May I take it that the \r\nGeneral Assembly agrees to that procedure?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: In accordance with rule \r\n92 of the rules of procedure, the election shall be held \r\nby secret ballot and there shall be no nominations.

The names of those five States should \r\ntherefore not appear on the ballot.\r\nBefore we begin the voting process, I should like to \r\nremind members that, pursuant to rule 88 of the rules of \r\nprocedure of the General Assembly, no representative \r\nshall interrupt the voting except on a point of order \r\non the actual conduct of the voting. In addition, ballot \r\npapers will be given only to the representative seated \r\ndirectly behind the country’s nameplate.\r\nWe shall now begin the voting process. Members \r\nare requested to remain seated until all ballots have \r\nbeen collected.\r\nI should like to remind members that, at this stage, \r\nthey are voting in the by-election for four seats for \r\nthe Group of Western European and other States.

Pursuant to rule 146 of \r\nthe rules of procedure, those countries are eligible for \r\nimmediate re-election.\r\nMembers will recall that Australia, Finland, \r\nGermany and Switzerland relinquished their seats on \r\nthe Economic and Social Council, effective 1 January \r\n2013, and that Austria, Denmark, New Zealand and \r\nSweden have just been elected to fill those vacancies.\r\nAs of 1 January 2013, the following States will \r\nbe represented on the Economic and Social Council: \r\nAustria, Belarus, Brazil, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, \r\nCameroon, China, Cuba, Denmark, the Dominican \r\nRepublic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Ethiopia, France, \r\nGabon, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Japan, Latvia, \r\nLesotho, Libya, Malawi, Mexico, New Zealand, \r\nNicaragua, Nigeria, Pakistan, Qatar, the Republic of \r\nKorea, the Russian Federation, Senegal, Spain, Sweden, \r\nTurkey and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and \r\nNorthern Ireland. The names of those 36 States should \r\ntherefore not appear on the ballots.\r\n12-57843 3\r\nA/67/PV.33\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 4 of resolution 2847 \r\n(XXVI), of 20 December 1971, and taking into account \r\nthe number of States that will remain members of the \r\nCouncil after 1 January 2013, the eighteen members \r\nshould be elected as follows: five from African States, \r\nfour from Asian and Pacific States, two from Eastern \r\nEuropean States, three from Latin American and \r\nCaribbean States, and four from Western European and \r\nother States. The ballot papers reflect that pattern.\r\nI should like to inform the Assembly that those \r\ncandidates — their number not exceeding the number \r\nof seats to be filled — that receive a two-thirds \r\nmajority and the greatest number of votes by members \r\npresent and voting, will be declared elected. Consistent \r\nwith past practice, in the case of a tie vote making it \r\nnecessary to determine the candidate that will proceed \r\nto the next round of restricted balloting, there will be a \r\nspecial restricted ballot limited to those candidates that \r\nhave obtained an equal number of votes.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly agrees to \r\nthose procedures?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: In accordance with rule 92 \r\nof the rules of procedure, the election shall be held by \r\nsecret ballot, and there shall be no nominations.\r\nRegarding candidatures of the respective regional \r\ngroups, the Secretariat has been informed of the \r\nfollowing.

For the three vacant seats from among the \r\nLatin American and Caribbean States, the Group has \r\nendorsed three candidates: the Plurinational State of \r\nBolivia, Colombia and Haiti. For the four vacant seats \r\nfrom among the Western European and other States, \r\nthe Group has endorsed four candidates: Canada, the \r\nNetherlands, San Marino and the United States of \r\nAmerica.\r\nIn accordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure, \r\nwe shall now proceed to the election by secret ballot.\r\nWe shall now begin the voting process. Ballot \r\npapers marked “A”, “B”, “C”, “D” and “E” will now \r\nbe distributed. I request representatives to use only \r\nthose ballot papers and to write on them the names of \r\nthe States for which they wish to vote. A ballot will be \r\ndeclared invalid if it contains more names of Member \r\nStates from the relevant region than the number of seats \r\nassigned to it. A ballot will also be declared invalid if \r\nnone of the names of the Member States on that ballot \r\nbelongs to the relevant region. If a ballot paper of a \r\nregion contains both the names of Member States that \r\nbelong to and that are outside of that region, the ballot \r\nremains valid but only the names of the Member States \r\nthat belong to the relevant region will be counted. The \r\nnames of Member States that do not belong to that \r\nregion will not be counted.\r\nAt the invitation of the Acting President, \r\nMrs. Cizare (Ethiopia), Ms. Ngyema Ndong (Gabon), \r\nMr. Yennimatas (Greece), Mr. Harris (Guatemala), \r\nMr. Stefanik (Poland) and Mrs. Thanarat (Thailand) \r\nacted as tellers.\r\nA vote was taken by secret ballot.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 11.35 a.m. resumed \r\nat 12.40 p.m.\r\nThe Acting President: The result of the voting is \r\nas follows:\r\nGroup A — African States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 192\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 0\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 192\r\nAbstentions: 0\r\nNumber of members voting: 192\r\nRequired two-thirds majority: 128\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nBenin 190\r\nMauritius 189\r\nTunisia 186\r\nSouth Africa 183\r\nSudan 176\r\nGroup B — Asian and Pacific States \r\nNumber of ballot papers: 192\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 0\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 192\r\nAbstentions: 0\r\nNumber of members voting: 192\r\nRequired two-thirds majority: 128\r\nNumber of votes obtained: \r\nKuwait 180 \r\nKyrgyzstan 164 \r\n4 12-57843\r\nA/67/PV.33\r\nTurkmenistan 140\r\nNepal 131\r\nSaudi Arabia 128\r\nBahrain 1\r\nCambodia 1\r\nGroup C — Eastern European States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 192\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 1\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 191\r\nAbstentions: 1\r\nNumber of members voting: 190\r\nRequired two-thirds majority: 127\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nCroatia 185\r\nAlbania 184\r\nGroup D — Latin American and Caribbean States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 192\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 1\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 191\r\nAbstentions: 0\r\nNumber of members voting: 191\r\nRequired two-thirds majority: 128\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nPlurinational State of Bolivia 186\r\nColombia 186\r\nHaiti 186\r\nGroup E — Western European and other States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 192\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 0\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 192\r\nAbstentions: 3\r\nNumber of members voting: 189\r\nRequired two-thirds majority: 126\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nSan Marino 184\r\nNetherlands 179\r\nCanada 174\r\nUnited States of America 171\r\nNorway 1\r\nAndorra 1\r\nFinland 1\r\nHaving obtained the required two-thirds majority \r\nof members present and voting and the largest \r\nnumber of votes, the following 18 States were \r\nelected members of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil for a three-year term beginning on \r\n1 January 2013: Albania, Benin, the Plurinational \r\nState of Bolivia, Canada, Colombia, Croatia, \r\nHaiti, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Mauritius, Nepal, the \r\nNetherlands, San Marino, South Africa, the Sudan, \r\nTunisia, Turkmenistan and the United States of \r\nAmerica.\r\nThe Acting President: I congratulate the States \r\nthat have been elected members of the Economic \r\nand Social Council, and I thank the tellers for their \r\nassistance in this election.\r\nThis concludes our consideration of sub-item (b) of \r\nagenda item 109.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe Acting President: As announced in today’s \r\nJournal of the United Nations, I should like to inform \r\nmembers that the revision to the programme of work \r\nand schedule of plenary meetings of the General \r\nAssembly during the main part of its sixty-seventh \r\nsession has been issued and is contained in document \r\nA/INF/67/4/Rev.1.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.45 p.m.\r\n"
