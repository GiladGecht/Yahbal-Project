We are pleased to have joined \r\nthe overwhelming majority of Member States by voting \r\nin favour of the resolution to end the embargo against \r\nCuba (resolution 67/4). Saint Lucia has consistently \r\nexpressed its concern that such unilateral measures run \r\ncounter to international law, the sovereignty of nations, \r\nfree trade and the principles embodied in the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations.\r\nAs a member of the Caribbean community, Saint \r\nLucia has cooperated with Cuba in furtherance of \r\nthe economic, social and educational advancement of \r\nthe people of our region. Cuba continues to provide \r\nnumerous scholarships for students in our region, who \r\nare studying various disciplines and will return to \r\ntheir homelands with much-needed skills to foster the \r\ndevelopment process.\r\nCuba’s contribution in providing health care in \r\nunderserved parts of the world is legendary. The \r\ntraining of doctors from developing countries also \r\nserves to help improve the overall health of the people \r\nof those countries. The embargo on Cuba only impedes \r\nthose efforts. It is unhelpful as well as an anachronism \r\nin the twenty-first century. \r\nMr. Cancela (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): As in \r\nprevious years, Uruguay voted in favour of resolution \r\n67/4, introduced by the Cuban delegation, in the belief \r\nthat the embargo against that country runs counter \r\nto the purposes and principles of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations and violates the rules of international \r\nlaw, particularly the standards regulating international \r\ntrade, which are binding on the members of the World \r\nTrade Organization.\r\nUruguay’s position is in line with the broadest \r\ncontextual definition of multilateralism, non-intervention \r\nand the peaceful settlement of disputes, all fundamental \r\nprinciples of our diplomacy. The situation also has an \r\nimpact on another fundamental principle, that of the \r\nequality of States before the law. It is precisely because \r\nof that principle that our country rejects any unilateral \r\nUnited Nations A/67/PV.36\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-seventh session\r\n36th plenary meeting\r\nTuesday, 13 November 2012, 3 p.m.\r\nNew York\r\nOffi cial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Jeremić  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Serbia)\r\n2 12-58855\r\nA/67/PV.36\r\nor extraterritorial coercive measure that contravenes \r\nthe rules of international law and the principles of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations, of which the clearest \r\ncurrent example is the unjust embargo imposed on the \r\nRepublic of Cuba.\r\nOn various occasions — and I will reiterate it on \r\nthis occasion — the Eastern Republic of Uruguay has \r\nstated its opposition to the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial blockade of Cuba, with its severe effect on \r\nthe well-being of the Cuban people. As a matter of \r\nprinciple, Uruguay rejects, and does not recognize in \r\nits national legislation, the extraterritorial enforcement \r\nof the domestic laws of other States. In that regard, we \r\ncondemn the unilateral coercive measures imposed by \r\nthe United States on Cuba, which are a form of pressure \r\nthat poses an obstacle to dialogue and to the essential \r\nrapprochement between the parties that we hope to see \r\nresumed.\r\nIn voting in favour of the resolution, Uruguay \r\nreiterates its commitment to multilateralism as a \r\nlegitimate instrument for settling disputes between \r\nStates and as an effective approach for promoting \r\ninternational cooperation, human rights, security and \r\nunderstanding between peoples.\r\nMr. Shaanika (Namibia): I would like first to join \r\nother speakers before me in conveying my deepest \r\nsympathy and condolences to the people in countries \r\naffected by Hurricane Sandy, particularly the people \r\nof our host city, New York. My delegation aligns itself \r\nwith the statements made at the 35th meeting by the \r\nPermanent Representatives of Cape Verde, the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran and Algeria on behalf of the African \r\nGroup, the Non-Aligned Movement and the Group of \r\n77 and China, respectively. I would like, however, to \r\nmake some additional comments in explanation of our \r\nvote.\r\nMy delegation voted in favour of resolution 67/4 \r\non the necessity of ending the economic, commercial \r\nand financial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica on Cuba, because we believe that sovereign \r\nnations should live in peace with one another as good \r\nneighbours and embrace the principle of open trade \r\nwithout any threat or use of coercive measures. It is \r\nclear that the imposition of the blockade against Cuba \r\nis a coercive tool that is inconsistent with the practice \r\nof tolerance and that it, in fact, defies the promise \r\nenshrined in the United Nations Charter that all \r\nMember States should be able “to practice tolerance \r\nand live together in peace with one another as good \r\nneighbours”. In the same vein, the blockade policy does \r\nnot foster the practice of tolerance or enhance peace \r\nbetween Cuba and the United States so that they may \r\nlive as good neighbours, since it undermines that spirit \r\nof good-neighbourliness.\r\nWe do not condone the use of coercive measures \r\nas a tool to influence the policies of other sovereign \r\nand peace-loving countries. For that and other reasons, \r\nNamibia remains concerned about the promulgation \r\nand application of laws and measures that constitute \r\nan unjustifiable economic, commercial or financial \r\nblockade of any peaceful country. As we have observed \r\ntoday, the blockade policy has been overwhelmingly \r\nrejected by the States Members of the United Nations, \r\nbecause it not only inflicts pain on the people of Cuba, \r\nbut also restricts their economic and social development.\r\nSimilarly, the blockade policy violates the basic \r\nhuman rights of the people of Cuba, because it causes \r\nirreparable damage to their economic, social and \r\ncultural way of life, key fundamentals to the pursuit of \r\nhappiness. Namibia maintains the firm belief that all \r\nhuman rights, be they political, cultural or economic, \r\nare inseparable and therefore intertwined. Among those \r\nrights are the right to food, to better health, to education \r\nand the right of the people of any nation to develop their \r\nown country in the way they deem fit. The blockade \r\ndenies the people of Cuba those fundamental human \r\nrights, just because they opted to pursue a different \r\npath to socioeconomic development.\r\nGuided by our conviction and conscience that the \r\nblockade against Cuba is a denial of the rights I have just \r\nhighlighted, Namibia voted in favour of the resolution \r\nand will continue to do so until the blockade is finally \r\nlifted. It is our hope that the United States will heed \r\nthe voice of the international community expressed so \r\nclearly and loudly here today.\r\nMr. Khitchadeth (Lao People’s Democratic \r\nRepublic): I would first like to extend a warm welcome \r\nto Mr. Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Republic of Cuba, and to express to him \r\nmy delegation’s full support and solidarity. I would \r\nalso like to take this opportunity to extend our deep \r\ncondolences and sympathy to the Governments and \r\npeoples of all of the countries affected by Hurricane \r\nSandy for the tragic loss of life and devastation it \r\ninflicted.\r\nLet me begin by welcoming the report submitted \r\nby the Secretary-General (A/67/118) under agenda item \r\n12-58855 3\r\nA/67/PV.36\r\n41. My delegation wishes to associate itself with the \r\nstatements made by the Permanent Representatives of \r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran and Algeria on behalf of \r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement and the Group of 77 and \r\nChina, respectively (see A/67/PV.35).\r\nFor more than four decades the innocent people of \r\nCuba have continued to endure the misery resulting \r\nfrom the economic, commercial and financial embargo \r\nimposed by the United States of America on their \r\ncountry. The embargo has also impeded their efforts \r\nto eliminate poverty, promote economic and social \r\ndevelopment and attain the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. It is disappointing to witness such unilateral \r\nand discriminatory commercial practices lingering \r\nin today’s world of interdependence and multilateral \r\ncooperation among States. The blockade violates \r\ninternational law and is against the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations. It is \r\na transgression of the right of a sovereign State to \r\npeace, development and security and is, in its essence \r\nand objectives, an act of unilateral aggression and a \r\npermanent threat to a country’s stability.\r\nIn accordance with the relevant resolutions of \r\nthe General Assembly, a Member State must neither \r\npromulgate nor enforce any law, regulation or measure \r\nthe extraterritorial effects of which would jeopardize \r\nthe sovereignty of other Member States, since every \r\nnation has the sovereign right to participate freely in \r\nthe international financial and commercial systems.\r\nBased on the universal principle of sovereign \r\nequality under the United Nations Charter and \r\ninternational law, no nation has the right to interfere \r\nin the internal affairs of others, despite their different \r\nsociopolitical systems. As a sovereign and independent \r\nnation, the Republic of Cuba has the right to choose its \r\nown political system, as well as the path of development \r\nthat is most relevant to its specific conditions.\r\nLast year, 186 Member States voted in favour \r\nof resolution 66/6, which is irrefutable proof that \r\nthe demand for the lifting of the blockade has the \r\nrecognition and support of the vast majority of the \r\ninternational community. The blockade policy is also \r\nincreasingly rejected both within the United States \r\nand by the international community. The United States \r\nmust lift it immediately and unconditionally.\r\nThe Lao People’s Democratic Republic joins the \r\nmajority of the States Member of the United Nations \r\nin reaffirming the urgent need to put an end to the \r\neconomic, financial and commercial embargo against \r\nCuba. That long-lasting blockade has already caused \r\nimmeasurable material loss and economic damage to \r\nthe Cuban people. As Members of the United Nations, \r\nwe should do as much as we can to help Cuba to fully \r\nreclaim its legitimate right to integrate into the global \r\neconomy. In that spirit, my delegation voted in favour \r\nof resolution 67/4. \r\nMs. Miguel (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines): \r\nLike the overwhelming majority of States, Saint Vincent \r\nand the Grenadines voted in favour of resolution 67/4. \r\nWe align ourselves fully with the statements made \r\nearlier today on behalf of the Caribbean Community \r\n(CARICOM), the Non-Aligned Movement, the Group \r\nof 77 and China and the Community of Latin American \r\nand Caribbean States.\r\nWe take the f loor at this time to re-emphasize our \r\ndeeply held conviction that the ongoing embargo is \r\noutmoded, ineffective and illegal. The time has long \r\nsince passed for that archaic and punitive measure to \r\nbe consigned to our history books as an unfortunate \r\nremnant of a bygone era. Previous versions of the \r\nresolution have been introduced in the past 20 \r\nsessions of the General Assembly and have enjoyed \r\nnear-unanimous support for years. There is no other \r\nexample of the international community speaking so \r\noverwhelmingly and so consistently. However, the \r\nembargo remains stubbornly in place, and its negative \r\nimpacts have intensified, particularly in the wake of the \r\nongoing global economic and financial crisis.\r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines finds it \r\nregrettable that a number of vague General Assembly \r\nresolutions on various topics — resolutions that have \r\nenjoyed less enthusiastic support than this one — have \r\nbeen seized upon by various States to justify extreme \r\ninterventionist actions. In contrast, an unambiguous \r\nexpression of international will is not acted upon. \r\nThe theories and explanations for the continuing \r\nenforcement of the embargo — from legislative inertia \r\nto the shallow political considerations of marginal \r\npolitical constituencies — are insufficient to legitimize \r\nthe suffering that continues to be visited upon the \r\nCuban people.\r\nNo country represented in this Hall has the right \r\nto tell the United States how to conduct its foreign \r\npolicy, who its friends should be, or how to determine \r\nits national interests. Even if such a right existed, Saint \r\nVincent and the Grenadines would not presume to \r\n4 12-58855\r\nA/67/PV.36\r\nexercise it against our cherished friend and neighbour to \r\nthe north. But every country in this Hall is obligated by \r\nthe United Nations Charter to oppose instances where \r\nnational foreign policy decisions become violations \r\nof international law or disregard the principles of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations, in particular the \r\nprinciples of sovereign equality and non-interference \r\nin the domestic affairs of States.\r\nFurthermore, in an era of economic globalization \r\nand international diplomatic engagement across the \r\nideological spectrum, the embargo harkens back to \r\nan isolationist, confrontational era of naval blockades \r\nand military brinksmanship that have no place in our \r\nmodern system of economic and political interaction.\r\nThroughout its extended struggle with the effects of \r\nthe embargo, Cuba has nonetheless remained a staunch \r\nand abiding partner in the development of our country, \r\neven in times of global hardship. Cuban universities \r\nhave graduated over 250 Vincentian students and are \r\ncurrently playing host to 150 more, free of charge. Its \r\nsurgeons have performed operations on over 3,000 \r\nVincentian patients, without charging them a penny. \r\nIts doctors have brought quality medical care and \r\nexpertise to the most remote areas of our country. Even \r\nas we speak, Cuban engineers, architects and workers \r\nare labouring alongside Vincentians in the construction \r\nof a modern hospital and our first international airport. \r\nOur appreciation cannot be overstated.\r\nFurthermore, in a time of increasing regional \r\nintegration and interaction, the Cuban economy and \r\nits markets and resources are a valuable component of \r\nour collective Caribbean development. To impede the \r\ndevelopment of Cuba through illegal extraterritorial \r\nmeasures is potentially to stunt the growth of Cuba’s \r\nCaribbean neighbours. As we all grapple with the \r\nfallout of the global economic and financial crisis, the \r\nneed to eliminate such developmental impediments is \r\neven more compelling.\r\nNone of the original architects of the embargo, nor \r\nthe political principals that gave rise to it, remain in \r\noffice today. Indeed, the embargo has been in existence \r\nfor longer than Saint Vincent and the Grenadines has \r\nbeen an independent nation and predates the United \r\nNations membership of every CARICOM State, with \r\nthe exception of Haiti.\r\nLet us not allow political cowardice or ideological \r\nstraitjackets to perpetuate the continuation of the \r\nunjust and harmful embargo. We continue to hope \r\nfor an evolution in the thinking and actions of our \r\nfriends in the United States on the matter, and we \r\nremain unequivocal in our call for the removal of that \r\ndevelopmental constraint on our Caribbean neighbour.\r\nMr. Sin Son Ho (Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea): Allow me first to warmly welcome Mr. Bruno \r\nRodríguez Parrilla, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the \r\nRepublic of Cuba, and acknowledge his presence in this \r\nimportant place on this particular occasion.\r\nAllow me also to sincerely congratulate Cuba for \r\nthe absolute majority support received this morning \r\nfrom the States Members of the United Nations (see \r\nA/67/PV.35). My delegation fully associates itself with \r\nthe statements made by the representatives of Algeria \r\nand Iran on behalf of the Group of 77 and China and \r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement, respectively, as well as \r\nthose by other regional groups and speakers before my \r\ndelegation.\r\nTwenty-one years have passed since the General \r\nAssembly first began deliberating today’s agenda item \r\nat its forty-sixth session. As all of us are very well \r\naware, the United States has been enforcing the full-\r\nscale blockade against Cuba for more than 50 years for \r\nthe purpose of overthrowing the Government of Cuba, \r\nwhich has caused enormous damage to the economic \r\ndevelopment and welfare of the Cuban people. The \r\nCuban Government estimates that its people have \r\nsuffered over $1 trillion in damages under the blockade. \r\nThe 1996 Helms-Burton Act extending the embargo \r\nto reach third countries trading with Cuba escalated the \r\nunilateral arbitrariness of the United States. The United \r\nStates embargo against Cuba is a serious violation of \r\nthe principles of self-determination, sovereign equality, \r\nnon-interference in internal affairs and free trade \r\nstipulated in the Charter of the United Nations. The \r\nextrajudicial, unilateral coercive measures seeking to \r\nchange the political, economic and social systems of \r\nother countries based on the values of a specific country \r\ncan never be justified in any case. \r\nThe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea \r\nconsistently opposes all forms of intervention and \r\nsanctions against sovereign States. The Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea delegation voted this \r\nmorning in favour of resolution 67/4, entitled \r\n“Necessity of ending the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba”, and strongly urges the United \r\nStates to immediately lift the embargo against Cuba, in \r\n12-58855 5\r\nA/67/PV.36\r\nconformity with the will of the overwhelming majority \r\nof the States Members of the United Nations.\r\nThe Government of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea reiterates its firm support for and \r\nsolidarity with the righteous cause of the Cuban \r\nGovernment and people to safeguard their national \r\nsovereignty.\r\nMr. Lazarev (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): The \r\ndelegation of the Republic of Belarus would like to \r\nwelcome the presence of the Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of Cuba, Mr. Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, to our \r\ndebate today. \r\nWe align ourselves with the statement delivered by \r\nthe representative of Iran on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement (NAM) at the 35th meeting. \r\nToday the General Assembly has once again adopted \r\na resolution (resolution 67/4) entitled “Necessity \r\nof ending the economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo imposed by the United States of America \r\nagainst Cuba”. Once again, the vast majority of Member \r\nStates supported the resolution urging the United States \r\nto end the blockade. We would hope that the United \r\nStates, which counts itself among the civilized States, \r\nwill finally understand the irrationality and short-\r\nsightedness of the pressure it has continued to exert for \r\nmore than half a century on Cuba.\r\nBelarus rejects sanctions and unilateral \r\nenforcement measures. Such measures contravene \r\nthe Charter and the principles of international law. \r\nUnilateral enforcement measures are a f lagrant and \r\nmassive extraterritorial violation of the human rights \r\nof the citizens of the countries against whom they are \r\nintroduced.\r\nBelarus, as a State that has itself experienced \r\nunilateral enforcement sanctions, has on many \r\noccasions indicated the need for more active steps by \r\nthe Secretary-General and the High Commissioner \r\nfor Human Rights aimed at persuading the United \r\nStates and other countries to refrain from the wanton \r\nand crude tactic of applying political and economic \r\npressure on sovereign States. It is for that reason that \r\nBelarus is calling for the establishment of the post of a \r\nspecial rapporteur to the Human Rights Council on the \r\nunacceptability of resorting to unilateral enforcement \r\nmeasures. That idea was supported at the recent \r\nsixteenth NAM Summit.\r\nBelarus states here in the General Assembly, with \r\na full sense of responsibility, that it is impossible to \r\nbend a sovereign State to one’s will by blackmail, \r\nintimidation, threats or political and economic pressure. \r\nWe therefore voted in favour of the resolution. We \r\nsincerely hope that the resolution and the appeal by the \r\ninternational community will be heeded by the United \r\nStates and other States applying unilateral enforcement \r\nmeasures.\r\nMr. Ja’afari (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke \r\nin Arabic): I would like to begin by expressing my \r\ncountry’s support for the statements delivered at the \r\n35th meeting by the representatives of Algeria, on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China, and Iran, on behalf \r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), respectively. I \r\nwould like to welcome Mr. Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Cuba, and to assure him \r\nand his friendly country of our full support.\r\nThe principles of sovereign equality among States \r\nand non-interference in their internal affairs are the \r\nmain foundations on which international law is built. \r\nFor that very reason, the Charter of the United Nations \r\nand the Organization’s decisions and resolutions \r\nhave stressed, since its creation, the sanctity of those \r\nprinciples and the need for all Member States of the \r\nUnited Nations to respect them.\r\nSince the unilateral embargo imposed by the \r\nUnited States against Cuba and the measures taken \r\nto tightly enforce it run counter to the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations and the principles of international \r\nlaw governing relations among States, human rights, \r\ninternational humanitarian law and the rules of \r\ninternational trade, the embargo is de facto illegal, \r\ninhumane and incompatible with the standards set forth \r\nby the international community as the basis of relations \r\namong States. It also represents an unprecedented \r\nchallenge to international law and to the credibility of \r\nthe legality of unilateral American policies.\r\nThe embargo that has been in force against Cuba \r\nfor more than 50 years has created a precedent that has \r\nbeen rejected as unilateral by States, as it lies outside \r\nthe bounds of international law. It is also a cause of \r\nembarrassment for the United Nations. Moreover, the \r\nembargo has subjected Cuba to all forms of economic, \r\npolitical and social harm. It has entrenched the suffering \r\nof the Cuban people and put the United States in an \r\nembarrassingly direct opposition to the unanimous \r\ninternational opposition to the embargo. It has led to \r\nfinancial losses totalling $1 trillion.\r\n6 12-58855\r\nA/67/PV.36\r\nThe General Assembly has been discussing the item \r\nfor over 20 consecutive years. It has adopted resolutions \r\nthat have enjoyed overwhelming majority support. \r\nMany specialized political and regional organizations \r\nand agencies have adopted similar decisions. However, \r\nand regrettably, the economic, financial and trade \r\nembargo imposed on Cuba is still in effect as if nothing \r\nhad happened. The fact that 188 States voted in favour of \r\nresolution 67/4 at the current session in itself confirms \r\nonce again that Member States unanimously recognize \r\nthe illegitimacy of the embargo imposed on Cuba and \r\ncall for an end to it. \r\nThe Syrian Arab Republic confirms that unilateral \r\neconomic measures, which have been imposed by the \r\nUnited States, the European Union and other States, \r\nrepresent a f lagrant violation of the principles of \r\ninternational law. They are a hegemonic tool of the \r\nWest, which is suffering from a superiority complex \r\nwith regard to other countries and peoples; that tool \r\nserves only for oppression and economic and political \r\ncoercion. Such measures aim at influencing the \r\nindependence of national political decisions and at \r\ninterfering in the internal affairs of Member States in a \r\nway that runs counter to the provisions of the Charter. \r\nIt is also a manifestation of a policy of collective \r\npunishment that those States pursue. \r\nSuch illegitimate and unjust measures can only \r\nfoment negative feelings towards the West. The majority \r\nof such measures have been imposed by Western \r\nStates, particularly the United States of America and \r\nthe States of the European Union. Such measures aim at \r\nweakening the Governments of other States Members \r\nof the United Nations or at bringing pressure to bear \r\non those Governments in order to force them to change \r\ntheir national policies. \r\nMy country would like to reiterate its condemnation \r\nof the sanctions imposed by the United States, the \r\nEuropean Union and other States. We wish to stress the \r\ntoll and adverse effects that such illegitimate unilateral \r\nmeasures have taken on the life and prosperity of the \r\nSyrian people. Those unilateral illegitimate measures \r\nprevent Syrians from meeting their basic needs, in terms \r\nof access to medications, food, medical equipment, \r\ngas for household use, fuel for heating, agricultural \r\nneeds, civil aviation transportation services and \r\ncommunications equipment. \r\nIn that context, we recall that the imposition of \r\ncoercive unilateral measures is a violation of the relevant \r\nGeneral Assembly resolutions, including resolution \r\n66/186, entitled “Unilateral economic measures as \r\na means of political and economic coercion against \r\ndeveloping countries”, and resolution 66/156, entitled \r\n“Human rights and unilateral coercive measures”, in \r\nwhich the General Assembly stressed its condemnation \r\nand rejection of unilateral economic measures, as it \r\nconsidered such measures to be an impediment to \r\nhealthy trade relations among States and an obstruction \r\nto the full realization of the rights provided for in the \r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights and other \r\ninternational human rights instruments. In that context, \r\nI would mention the right of individuals and peoples to \r\ndevelopment. \r\nSuch measures prevent the enjoyment by each and \r\nevery individual of a living standard that guarantees \r\nthe rights to health, prosperity and access to food, \r\nmedical treatment, education and the necessary social \r\nservices. The United Nations Conference on Trade and \r\nDevelopment has already stressed that the unilateral \r\nsanctions imposed on my country, Syria, have had a \r\nmajor impact on trade revenues, foreign exchange, \r\nshrinking productivity and work opportunities, and the \r\ndeterioration of the economic and social prosperity of \r\nthe population, particularly among middle- and low-\r\nincome groups. We then see the parties that impose \r\nunilateral coercive measures on my people talking about \r\nhow keen they are to protect human rights in Syria. He \r\nwho commits arson cannot also be a firefighter; that is \r\nan act of political hypocrisy that must be rejected. \r\nIn accordance with its mandate, the General \r\nAssembly is called upon to take the necessary \r\nmeasures to put an end to the unilateral, unjust and \r\nhostile embargoes and economic sanctions policies \r\nthat are being pursued by some States in violation of \r\ninternational law. \r\nIt is disadvantageous and injurious to the United \r\nStates that Israel was one of only three States that voted \r\nagainst resolution 67/4. The overwhelming majority \r\nof Member States voted in favour. In that regard, my \r\ndelegation would hope that all forms of embargo and \r\nunilateral sanctions imposed by the United States on \r\nCuba and many other States, including my country, \r\nSyria, will be brought to an end. My country also \r\nhopes that the Israeli embargo and siege imposed on \r\nthe Palestinian people will be lifted as well. We hope \r\nthat the voice of the international community expressed \r\nby the General Assembly and other international \r\ninstitutions and organizations will be respected by the \r\n12-58855 7\r\nA/67/PV.36\r\nUnited States of America and fully taken into account \r\nby its legislative institutions. \r\nSome have, in fact, felt optimistic about the fact \r\nthat the America president was re-elected for a second \r\nterm and that United States intervention in the internal \r\naffairs of States might now abate. In the light of the \r\nforegoing, my country voted in favour of resolution \r\n67/4.\r\nThe Acting President: I would like to remind \r\ndelegations that explanations of vote are limited to 10 \r\nminutes.\r\nMr. Emiliou (Cyprus): I have the honour to speak \r\non behalf of the European Union (EU). The acceding \r\ncountry Croatia; the candidate countries the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Iceland \r\nand Serbia; the countries of the Stabilization and \r\nAssociation Process and potential candidates Albania \r\nand Bosnia and Herzegovina; as well as the Republic of \r\nMoldova, align themselves with this statement. \r\nThe United States trade policy towards Cuba is \r\nfundamentally a bilateral issue. However, American \r\nlegislation such as the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 and \r\nthe Helms-Burton Act of 1996 has extended the effects \r\nof the United States embargo to third-party countries. \r\nIn the framework of the common commercial policy, the \r\nEuropean Union has firmly and continuously opposed \r\nsuch extraterritorial measures. While we acknowledge \r\nthe decision by the United States Government to lift \r\nrestrictions on remittances and family travel to Cuba, \r\nwe cannot accept that unilaterally imposed measures \r\ncould impede our economic and commercial relations \r\nwith Cuba. \r\nTo address the problem, in November 1996, the \r\nEuropean Union Council of Ministers adopted a \r\nregulation and a joint action to protect the interests of \r\nnatural legal persons residing in Europe against the \r\nconsequences of the aforementioned Acts. Furthermore, \r\nat the summit between the European Union and the \r\nUnited States held in London in May 1998, a package \r\nwas agreed that also sought to alleviate the problems \r\ncaused by extraterritorial legislation. It covered \r\nwaivers to Titles III and IV of the Helms-Burton Act, \r\na commitment by the United States Government to \r\nresist future extraterritorial legislation of that kind, and \r\nan understanding regarding discipline to strengthen \r\ninvestment protection. It is urgent that the United States \r\nimplement that agreement.\r\nThe European Union’s policy towards Cuba was \r\nset out in a Common Position in 1996. Reaffirming \r\nthe validity of that Common Position, in June 2008 the \r\nEuropean Union lifted the restrictive measures imposed \r\non Cuba in 2003. The dialogue with the authorities in \r\nHavana was resumed without preconditions and on \r\na basis of reciprocity and non-discrimination. Five \r\nministerial sessions of political dialogue have been \r\nheld with the Cuban Government, addressing issues of \r\ncommon interest, including human rights, which is a \r\nquestion at the core of relations with all third countries, \r\nincluding Cuba. We reaffirm our determination to \r\npursue a comprehensive results-oriented dialogue with \r\nthe Cuban authorities, as well as with representatives of \r\ncivil society and the peaceful pro-democracy opposition, \r\nin accordance with EU policies. We reiterate the right \r\nof Cuban citizens to decide their future independently.\r\nWe are encouraged by the release of all the political \r\nprisoners from the group of 75 imprisoned in 2003, \r\ntogether with other political prisoners. We reiterate our \r\ncall on the Cuban Government to grant its citizens full, \r\ninternationally recognized civil, political and economic \r\nrights and freedoms, including the freedoms of assembly \r\nand expression and free access to information; to ratify \r\nthe United Nations International Covenants on Civil \r\nand Political Rights and on Economic, Social, and \r\nCultural Rights and, following the visit of the United \r\nNations Special Rapporteur on the right to food, to \r\nextend invitations to other rapporteurs to visit Cuba.\r\nCuba’s restrictions on rights and freedoms \r\nundermine and offset its achievements in health care and \r\neducation. Similarly, Cuba’s domestic economic policy \r\nseriously hampers its own economic development. \r\nIn that context, we note the adoption by the Cuban \r\nParliament in August 2011 of a package of economic \r\nand social reforms, and we expect them to be extended \r\nand implemented in a manner that will address the \r\nkey concerns of the Cuban population. The economic, \r\ncommercial, and financial embargo imposed by the \r\nUnited States contributes to the economic problems in \r\nCuba, negatively affecting the living standards of the \r\nCuban people. The lifting of the United States embargo \r\nwould facilitate an opening up of Cuba’s economy to \r\nthe benefit of the Cuban people. Together, we again \r\nexpress our rejection of all unilateral measures directed \r\nagainst Cuba that are contrary to commonly accepted \r\nrules of international trade. We urge the Cuban \r\nauthorities to bring about real improvements in all the \r\nareas mentioned.\r\n8 12-58855\r\nA/67/PV.36\r\nthat country continues to be one of our closest and \r\nstrongest partners. We respect the role that the United \r\nStates has played in international relations and in the \r\nestablishment and promotion of this very body. It is a \r\nglobal leader, and we acknowledge and remain grateful \r\nfor its role in international affairs. \r\nWhile recognizing recent concessions that have \r\nbeen made on the matter of the Cuban embargo, Saint \r\nKitts and Nevis feels that they are not enough, and that \r\nmuch more should be done. As we have said before, in \r\nspite of our size we are prepared to signal wrongdoing \r\nand speak truth to power when a platform presents \r\nitself to do so. Today, we do the same in supporting and \r\nvoting for the resolution.\r\nThis is an extremely important battle that goes \r\nto the core of international relations, sovereignty, \r\nnon-intervention and the strengthened role of the \r\nUnited Nations in international affairs. For the \r\npast 21 years, Members have voted in favour of the \r\nresolution to end the embargo. This year, it continues \r\nto have the overwhelming support of the international \r\ncommunity. Saint Kitts and Nevis, in its contribution to \r\nthe Secretary-General’s report on the matter (A/67/118), \r\nadvised that we do not support or apply any laws or \r\nmeasures that restrict the free f low of international \r\ntrade. We also advised that we do not apply laws with \r\nextraterritorial effect that impinge on the sovereignty \r\nof other States and the legitimate interests of entities \r\nor persons under their jurisdiction. That is a principled \r\nposition adopted by Member States of this body.\r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis feels very strongly, therefore, \r\nabout bringing the embargo imposed on Cuba to an end. \r\nCuba is a pan-Caribbean partner. It has aided in the \r\ndevelopment of the health-care systems and other areas \r\nin Saint Kitts and Nevis. There is much from which \r\nthe international community has benefited, and can \r\nbenefit, in cooperating with Cuba, just as Saint Kitts \r\nand Nevis has benefited.\r\nIt is disheartening that, although the resolutions \r\ncalling for an end to the embargo have received \r\noverwhelming support from the international \r\ncommunity for the past 21 consecutive years, the \r\nsanctions have been maintained. That unilateral \r\ninitiative has stunted the growth of the Cuban people \r\nand has affected their social and economic development. \r\nThe embargo is wrong on all levels, but none more so \r\nthan humanitarian grounds. \r\nDespite their continued concerns about and \r\ncriticisms of the human rights situation in Cuba, \r\nthe member States of the European Union voted \r\nunanimously in favour of resolution 67/4.\r\nMs. Nyamudeza (Zimbabwe): My delegation \r\nassociates itself with the statements made at the 35th \r\nmeeting by the representatives of Cape Verde, Algeria \r\nand Iran on behalf of the African Group, the Group \r\nof 77 and China and the Non-Aligned Movement, \r\nrespectively. We are explaining our vote on resolution \r\n67/4 not just out of solidarity with the people of the \r\nRepublic of Cuba. We do it out of a sense of revulsion \r\nat the nature of the economic blockade, which is one of \r\ncollective punishment. We deplore such sanctions for \r\nthe harm they do to the people of Cuba and for their \r\nillegal application under international law.\r\nWe in Zimbabwe know well the effect of such \r\neconomic punishment. Our country is enduring an \r\neconomic blockade of similar effect and consequences. \r\nSuch unilateral measures are evil in their nature; in \r\nour case, they are based on the racist premise that \r\nAfricans should not be masters of their economic \r\npotential and should not enjoy the benefits that accrue \r\nfrom their endowment of natural resources without the \r\nmediation — nay, blackmail — of erstwhile colonizers \r\nand their fellow travellers. That is as abhorrent to us as \r\nis the unacceptable situation in which Cuba has found \r\nitself for some five decades.\r\nWe hope that those who are imposing the economic \r\nblockade on Cuba will take cognizance of the global \r\nopposition to their behaviour and that they will relent. \r\nThe Cuban people should be left alone to shape their \r\ndestiny without hindrance. We stand by them as does, \r\nclearly, a preponderant part of the world.\r\nMr. Bart (Saint Kitts and Nevis): Saint Kitts and \r\nNevis would like to add its voice in support of the \r\nresolution on agenda item 41, entitled “Necessity of \r\nending the economic, commercial and financial embargo \r\nimposed by the United States of America against \r\nCuba”, and to give our reasons for voting in favour of \r\nresolution 67/4. My delegation associates itself with the \r\nstatements made by the representatives of Barbados \r\nand Algeria on behalf of the Caribbean Community \r\nand the Group of 77 and China, respectively, and by the \r\nrepresentative of Chile on behalf of the Community of \r\nLatin American and Caribbean States (see A/67/PV.35).\r\nOver the years, Saint Kitts and Nevis has had \r\ngood relations with the United States of America, and \r\n12-58855 9\r\nA/67/PV.36\r\nprinciples will contribute to the elimination of tension \r\nand confrontation between States. We therefore believe \r\nthat the embargo and coercive measures should be \r\nreplaced by dialogue and cooperation.\r\nFor those reasons, Myanmar has once again voted \r\nin favour of the resolution on the subject.\r\nMr. Awinador-Kanyirige (Ghana): Ghana aligns \r\nitself with the statements made on behalf of the African \r\nGroup, the Non-Aligned Movement and the Group of \r\n77 plus China (see A/67/PV.35). \r\nGhana has never supported the imposition of the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo by \r\nthe United States of America against Cuba. Ghana’s \r\nposition is informed by its commitment to its obligation \r\nto adhere to the United Nations Charter. It is also \r\nmorally indefensible to deny the people of the sovereign \r\nState of Cuba the benefits derived from external trade. \r\nGhana wishes to appeal to the United States Congress \r\nto heed the clarion call repeated over the past 22 years \r\nto help rectify the major hiccup in multilateralism \r\nthat the embargo represents. Over the years, Cuba \r\nhas demonstrated the spirit of multilateralism and \r\ninternational cooperation by playing host to thousands \r\nof students from Africa, who return to their respective \r\ncountries to contribute to the development of their \r\ncountries and global progress.\r\nIt is our hope that the issue of the embargo can be \r\nresolved more expeditiously to help us put it behind us \r\nand move forward together with the friendly peoples of \r\nCuba and the United States of America.\r\nMr. Oyarzábal (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nArgentina’s vote in favour of resolution 67/4 reflects \r\nour positive stance with respect to the elimination of \r\nthe type of unilateral and illegitimate measure that the \r\nembargo represents. The Government of the Argentine \r\nRepublic is committed to fully implementing the \r\nprovisions of the resolution just adopted.\r\nArgentina maintains a strong commitment to \r\nmultilateralism as a legitimate instrument for resolving \r\ndisputes between States and as the primary means of \r\nresponding to the major challenges that require close \r\ncooperation between countries. The embargo against \r\nCuba is contrary to international law and the principles \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nArgentine legislation on the subject established, \r\nthrough Act No. 24,871 of 1997, that foreign legislation \r\nthat seeks, through the imposition of an economic \r\nWe implore all Member States to respect the \r\nsanctity of the General Assembly and the decisions it \r\ntakes. The continued failure to respect United Nations \r\ndecisions continues to undermine multilateralism \r\nand the functioning of the United Nations system. It \r\nis my delegation’s hope that the two countries, Cuba \r\nand the United States of America, can improve their \r\nrelationship and embark on a process of partnership \r\nand cooperation. Saint Kitts and Nevis believes that the \r\ndiscontinuation of the embargo would go a long way \r\ntowards improving relations and cooperation between \r\nthe two countries. The issue is now no longer seen as \r\na matter of merely bilateral interest, but of multilateral \r\nconcern, we join the call of the international community \r\non the United States to discontinue the embargo.\r\nMr. Thu (Myanmar): I am taking the f loor to \r\nexplain my delegation’s position on resolution 67/4, \r\nwhich was just adopted by an overwhelming majority \r\nof Member States. I would also like to take this \r\nopportunity to thank Mr. Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Cuba, for his important \r\nstatement.\r\nAs a member of the Non-Aligned Movement, \r\nMyanmar has steadfastly adhered to the principled \r\nposition of the Movement in strongly opposing the use \r\nof unilateral trade and economic sanctions against some \r\nmembers of the Movement for the purpose of exerting \r\npolitical pressure. In fact, they are counterproductive \r\nand undermine the cause of human rights, particularly \r\nthe right of peoples to development.\r\nAs a country confronted with similar unilateral \r\nsanctions for decades, Myanmar fully understands \r\nfrom its own experience the extent of the hardship \r\nand suffering caused by unilateral sanctions, which \r\ndirectly affect the people of the country, especially the \r\nvulnerable groups of women and children. We are thus \r\nsympathetic to the fact that the decades-long embargo \r\nimposed on Cuba has caused massive economic damage \r\nand hardship to the country and its people, preventing \r\nthe country from fully developing its economic \r\npotential.\r\nTherefore, my delegation has always taken \r\nthe principled position of joining the international \r\ncommunity every year in calling for an end to the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo against \r\nCuba in order to relieve the suffering of the people. \r\nMyanmar fully subscribes to the purposes and principles \r\nenshrined in the Charter, especially the principle of \r\nthe sovereign equality of nations. Adherence to those \r\n10 12-58855\r\nA/67/PV.36\r\nembargo or limits on investment in a given country, \r\nto have extraterritorial legal effects in order to bring \r\nabout a change of Government in a country or to affect \r\nits right to self-determination, shall be absolutely \r\ninapplicable and devoid of legal effect. Moreover, \r\nit stipulated that foreign legislation that puts limits, \r\nthrough the imposition of an economic embargo, on \r\ninvestment in a given country or imposes restrictions \r\non the free circulation of persons, services or goods, \r\nor seeks to have extraterritorial legal effects in order \r\nto bring about a change of Government in a country or \r\nto affect its right to self-determination, shall also be \r\nabsolutely inapplicable and devoid of legal effect. \r\nIt is therefore unacceptable that, despite the reiterated \r\nand practically unanimous calls from the international \r\ncommunity, in particular the General Assembly, for its \r\nelimination, the economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo against Cuba persists. We must eliminate such \r\ncoercive unilateral measures, which cause irreparable \r\nharm to the well-being of peoples. Argentina joins \r\nothers in rejecting the embargo and reiterates its stance \r\nagainst such measures and its determined support to \r\nCuba’s call to end the embargo.\r\nMr. Al Habib (Islamic Republic of Iran): At \r\nthe outset, allow me to congratulate the Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of Cuba for the overwhelming majority \r\nsupport enjoyed by resolution 67/4, which was adopted \r\nthis morning. We voted in favour of the resolution \r\njust adopted under agenda item 41 on the necessity \r\nof ending the economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo imposed by the United States of America \r\nagainst Cuba. The views of the Islamic Republic of Iran \r\non this important issue were articulated before the vote \r\nthis morning in the statement delivered on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement. However, in explaining our \r\nvote after the voting, I would like to state the following.\r\nThe unilateral embargo has an extended negative \r\neffect on companies and citizens from third countries, \r\nthereby violating their sovereign rights. The Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran reiterates its deep concern at the \r\nharmful impact on other countries resulting from \r\nthe extraterritorial nature of the embargo, which we \r\nconsider an added argument in favour of the prompt \r\nelimination of all unfounded sanctions.\r\nThe Assembly has repeatedly rejected the imposition \r\nof laws and regulations with extraterritorial impact \r\nand all other kinds of coercive economic measures \r\nthat hurt the progress and prosperity of people all over \r\nthe world. The Assembly has also called upon States \r\nto respect their obligations under the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations and international law and to repeal and \r\ninvalidate laws and measures that have extraterritorial \r\neffects on other States. The embargo, particularly \r\nthrough its extraterritorial effects, adversely affects the \r\neconomic prosperity of the targeted countries. Sanctions \r\nincrease commodity and energy prices and limit the \r\naccess of States to markets, investment, technology and \r\nfinancial services, and even scientific, educational and \r\ncultural events, and thus contribute to global economic \r\nstagnation and hamper sound and healthy relations \r\namong nations. Examples of such embargoes are the \r\nmeasures imposed unilaterally against Cuba and Iran, \r\nwhich have brought extra pressure on the targeted \r\ncountries.\r\nIt is unfortunate that, in spite of the General \r\nAssembly’s yearly rejection of the United States \r\nembargo against Cuba, the embargo remains in full \r\nforce. We see such enforcement as a violation of \r\nworld opinion and an act that severely undermines \r\nmultilateralism and the credibility of the United \r\nNations itself. Multilateralism remains the best route \r\nfor resolving disputes and guaranteeing the peaceful \r\ncoexistence of States. The Islamic Republic of Iran has \r\ntherefore supported all initiatives against embargoes as \r\na tool to exert political and economic pressure on other \r\nStates. We shall continue to support Cuba in its right \r\nto have access to global economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial exchanges in order to promote cooperation \r\nand development.\r\nOur close ties and friendship with Cuba and the \r\nCuban people lead us to vehemently oppose the blockade \r\nand emphasize the urgent need to put an end to such \r\ninhumane measures against Cuba and other developing \r\ncountries and to fully implement the resolution just \r\nadopted (resolution 67/4).\r\nMr. Mashabane (South Africa): We would like to \r\ntake this opportunity to congratulate the people and \r\nthe Government of Cuba on the adoption of resolution \r\n67/4, “Necessity of ending the economic, commercial \r\nand financial embargo imposed by the United States \r\nof America against Cuba”, with the support of almost \r\nall members of the General Assembly. The peoples of \r\nthe world have today spoken loudly and in no uncertain \r\nterms against the grave injustice being committed \r\nagainst the people of Cuba. We would also like to take \r\nthis opportunity to thank the Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of Cuba for his attendance on this historic \r\n12-58855 11\r\nA/67/PV.36\r\nin relations and cooperation and reaffirms South \r\nAfrica’s commitment and ongoing support for Cuba.\r\nThe international community recognizes Cuba’s \r\noutstanding work in the areas of health, education and \r\nbiotechnology in Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa \r\nand the underdeveloped world in particular and the \r\nworld in general. A total of 321 South Africans who \r\nhave graduated in Cuba are working as medical doctors \r\nin various South African hospitals, and a further 408 \r\nSouth African students are currently studying medicine \r\nin Cuba. Furthermore, the Extended Health Cooperation \r\nAgreement signed between the two parties on Africa \r\nDay, 25 May, in Pretoria, makes provision for, among \r\nother things, the training of an additional 1,000 South \r\nAfrican students in Cuba, in an attempt to address the \r\ncountry’s shortage of medical doctors. The embargo \r\nstif les that outstanding contribution to economic and \r\nsocial development and hinders the betterment of the \r\nlives of the poor.\r\nSouth Africa therefore supports the lifting of the \r\nUnited States of America’s embargo against Cuba, and \r\nwe refrain from recognizing unilateral measures and \r\nlaws of a coercive nature that defy the principles of the \r\nUnited Nations Charter and norms of international law. \r\nWe remain grateful for the role that Cuba and its people \r\nplayed in our struggle against colonialism, oppression \r\nand apartheid in Africa.\r\nMr. Beck (Solomon Islands): Let me begin by \r\nassociating myself with the statement delivered at \r\nthe 35th meeting by the representatives of Algeria on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China, and of Barbados, \r\nour fellow small island developing State, on behalf of \r\nthe Caribbean Community, and all those who spoke in \r\nfavour of resolution 67/4 today.\r\nMy delegation congratulates Cuba on the adoption \r\nof the resolution in the presence of Mr. Bruno Rodríguez \r\nParrilla, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Cuba. As in \r\nprevious years, the Solomon Islands voted in favour of \r\nthe 21-year-old resolution, entitled “Necessity of ending \r\nthe economic, commercial and financial embargo \r\nimposed by the United States of America against Cuba”. \r\nWe do so as the embargo continues to claim enormous \r\nlosses, including loss of life, and to work against the \r\nprinciples, letter and spirit of the Charter of the United \r\nNations.\r\nThe world annually makes an appeal to our friend \r\nand partner, the United States of America, to show \r\nsome care and to have compassion when it comes to \r\noccasion, when the General Assembly adopted this \r\ncrucial resolution.\r\nThe question of ending the economic, commercial \r\nand financial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba has been and continues to be a \r\npersistent problem for the United Nations, despite many \r\ncalls for its elimination. It is for that reason that South \r\nAfrica would like to reiterate its support for the lifting \r\nof the United States embargo against Cuba. In doing so, \r\nSouth Africa supports the resolution that has just been \r\nadopted.\r\nThe continued imposition of the embargo by the \r\nUnited States of America against Cuba is a f lagrant \r\nviolation of the principles of the sovereign equality of \r\nStates and of non-intervention and non-interference in \r\ndomestic affairs. Furthermore, the blockade constitutes \r\na violation of international law, and its imposition \r\nshows disregard for the noble principles enshrined in \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations.\r\nAs a result of the laws and regulations that define \r\nthe blockade, Cuba is unable to freely export and \r\nimport products and services to or from the United \r\nStates and cannot use United States dollars to carry out \r\nits international financial transactions or hold accounts \r\nin that currency in third countries’ banks. Cuba is \r\nalso not allowed to receive credits from international \r\ninstitutions such as the World Bank, the International \r\nMonetary Fund or the Inter-American Development \r\nBank. In addition, bilateral economic ties between \r\nCuba and South Africa in particular, and other friendly \r\nnations in general, are further hampered and restricted \r\nby United States domestic law. That has led to the \r\neconomic and social suffering of the Cuban civilian \r\npopulation, who bear the brunt of this injustice. This \r\nsituation needs to end.\r\nIt is our well-considered view that the embargo \r\nviolates the rights of the people of Cuba to socioeconomic \r\ndevelopment. It is therefore against that backdrop that \r\nSouth Africa has repeatedly joined the majority of \r\ncountries in expressing opposition to all aspects of the \r\nblockade and the unilateral action by the United States.\r\nSouth Africa is pleased to announce that an \r\nagreement in the matter of economic assistance for \r\nCuba has been duly ratified by the National Assembly \r\nof South Africa. The Agreement and ratification \r\ndocuments have been submitted to the President for \r\nfinal ratification. It is expected that all formalities will \r\nbe concluded by the end of 2012. That is a breakthrough \r\n12 12-58855\r\nA/67/PV.36\r\nOne representative has asked to take the f loor in \r\nexercise of the right of reply. May I remind him that \r\nstatements in the exercise of the right of reply are \r\nlimited to 10 minutes for the first intervention and to \r\nfive minutes for the second intervention, and should be \r\nmade by delegations from their seats.\r\nI now give the f loor to the representative of Cuba.\r\nMr. Rodríguez Parrilla (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nMr. Godard has continued to repeat the same story that \r\nhe has recounted to the Assembly every year in seeking \r\nto uphold the Bush policy and now that of President \r\nObama. That story will not become true simply through \r\nrepetition. Only four of the paragraphs that he read out \r\ntoday were not an almost word-for-word repetition of the \r\nstatement that was delivered last year (see A/66/PV.41). \r\nMr. Godard repeats himself, but the blockade does not \r\nchange. It is a remnant of the Cold War.\r\nMr. Godard lies in saying that the blockade exists \r\nout of respect for the Cuban people’s right to freely \r\ndetermine their future. We are here because the United \r\nStates Government has sought to impose its own designs \r\non Cuba over the course of a century since 1901, when \r\nthe United States imposed, through military occupation, \r\nthe Platt Amendment, which allowed it to intervene in \r\nCuba and occupy the Guantánamo naval base, which \r\nit continues to usurp. We are here because the Cuban \r\npeople have defended their right to self-determination \r\nand independence with their own blood on the shores \r\nof Playa Girón and when faced with the threat of a \r\nnuclear holocaust in the October 1962 crisis or the \r\nmissile crisis. Nobody believes that the United States \r\nGovernment is interested in the freedom of the Cuban \r\npeople, after having dishonoured that freedom for half \r\na century and lent its support to bloody dictatorships \r\nin Cuba and throughout the region. What it wishes to \r\nachieve in Cuba is a docile Government that supports \r\nits interests, and that is not going to happen. \r\nThe Cuban people gained their freedom on their \r\nown and have resolutely exercised their right to self-\r\ndetermination. They have demonstrated that will in \r\nthe popular discourse of economic and social policies \r\nand in the elections under way. They nominate their \r\nown candidates; there is a massive turnout to vote for \r\nthem and they revoke them when they choose. There \r\nare no special interests in Cuba, no corruption and no \r\npolitical manoeuvring. We do not waste $3 billion on a \r\npresidential or senatorial campaigns, and Cuba is not a \r\nplutocracy where the 1 per cent imposes its interests.\r\nthe severity of its prolonged sanctions against the \r\npeople of Cuba. When sanctions defy international and \r\nhumanitarian law, embargoes cause needless suffering, \r\nand an extraterritorial blockade restrains a country’s \r\ndevelopment aspirations, which speaks of nothing \r\nshort of a disharmonious relationship between two \r\nneighbours. In other words, the United States embargo \r\nis based on the concept that what is bad for Cuba is \r\ngood for the United States of America.\r\nA positive and engaging atmosphere is needed. In \r\nthat connection, the United Nations, as an organization \r\nresponsible for the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security, is the rightful place to address such issues. \r\nSo we welcome the resolution. The resolution stands \r\nfor peace. It speaks for respect for good-neighbourly \r\nrelations in principle, as enshrined in the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations. It is in that regard that the Solomon \r\nIslands once again humbly requests the United States \r\nto reach out and give peace a chance. \r\nThe credibility of the Organization rests on the \r\nactions we take as members of this global institution. \r\nThe lifting of the embargo, especially by a friend and \r\npartner with absolute power, will create the needed \r\npositive relationship. We, the Members of the United \r\nNations, should not embrace multilateralism only \r\nwhen it suits the United States and discard it at our \r\nconvenience; rather, we must honour and live up to our \r\nCharter responsibilities, as the people depend on it. \r\nFor more than 50 years the Cuban people \r\nhave continued to stand tall against those difficult \r\ncircumstances. We continue to recognize Cuba’s \r\nresilience, friendship and solidarity as it continues \r\nto extend assistance to countries all over the world, \r\nincluding those in the Pacific and the Solomon Islands, \r\nhelping us to achieve our Millennium Development \r\nGoals via the training of our medical students. \r\nThe suggestion made today by Cuba’s Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs (see A/67/PV.35) of submitting a \r\ndraft agenda to its neighbour the United States, aimed \r\nat normalizing relations, is welcomed by the General \r\nAssembly. My delegation hopes that Cuba’s outreach \r\nto the United States will be reciprocated by the \r\nUnited States through the unconditional lifting of the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo against \r\nCuba and the strengthening of multilateralism. We will \r\ncontinue to support the resolution as we move forward. \r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in explanation of vote. \r\n12-58855 13\r\nA/67/PV.36\r\nInternet access; put an end to illegal and subversive \r\nbroadcasting on the radio and television; allow the \r\npurchase of United States software and the training \r\nof specialists; put an end to information technology \r\nrestrictions and permit the use of those services that \r\nprovide technological support but have been prohibited \r\nto date from export to Cuba.\r\nIf they wish for more exchanges and contact \r\nbetween the peoples, then they should respect the \r\nconstitutional right and the freedom of United States \r\ncitizens to travel to Cuba, as they are free to travel to \r\nany other country, even in times of war. They should \r\nstop imposing restrictions on the granting of licences \r\nand accept that walking and listening to Cuban music \r\nand dancing are not crimes and can be part of the \r\nactivities offered by travel agencies. \r\nIf they wish to see better education for young people, \r\nthen cooperation and exchange programmes should be \r\nauthorized between universities, including grants in \r\nall realms of science and technology; an end should \r\nbe put to the subversive and illegal use of training by \r\nthe United States Interests Section in Havana; and the \r\nobstacles to international medical cooperation should \r\nbe removed.\r\nThe representative of the United States lies when \r\nhe affirms that his country is one of the leading donors \r\nof humanitarian aid to Cuba. He has used false figures, \r\nwhich include the millions of dollars that the United \r\nStates Agency for International Development uses to \r\nsubvert the constitutional order in my country, amounts \r\nfor commercial licences that have never materialized, \r\nand the small but generous and greatly appreciated \r\ndonations that non-governmental organizations, in \r\ndefiance of the policies of their Government, send \r\nto Cuba, overcoming enormous obstacles. Cuban \r\nemigrants, like other emigrants, painstakingly \r\nsave remittances from their hard work. That is not \r\nhumanitarian aid provided by the United States \r\nGovernment. \r\nMr. Alan Gross was punished under due process \r\nfor carrying out covert operations that were funded \r\nby the United States Government and made use \r\nof non-commercial technology against the Cuban \r\nconstitutional order. Those acts were provided for \r\nand sanctioned under United States law. Mr. Godard \r\nlies when he says that Mr. Gross helped the Jewish \r\ncommunity to gain access to the Internet. The United \r\nStates Government is responsible for the situation of \r\nIt would be worthwhile to listen to the people of \r\nthe United States and respect their right to decide for \r\nthemselves; to listen to the people who make up 90 per \r\ncent of the populace and not a handful of the wealthy \r\nwho benefit from the current system; to listen to those \r\nwho want to occupy Wall Street, rather than seeking \r\nto rescue the bankers who receive scandalous bonuses. \r\nThey should stop brutally repressing the Occupy Wall \r\nStreet demonstrations and put an end to the widespread \r\narrests of peaceful demonstrators and the harassment of \r\nimmigrants and minorities. \r\nI repeat that the blockade is an act of genocide. I \r\nnote that Mr. Godard did not deny that this time around. \r\nOne would have to be cynical, if one were to refer to \r\nthe human rights and the freedom, prosperity and \r\nwell-being of the Cuban people after having listened \r\nto the examples that I mentioned concerning the harm \r\nthe blockade has caused to the children of my country. \r\nThey should stop wasting the money of their honourable \r\nworkers, whose taxes are going to pay mercenaries and \r\nspecial agents, and eliminate the quadrennial budget of \r\nmore than $196 billion to create alleged dissidents. \r\nMr. Godard, who was for years was the head of the \r\nMiami Office of the Coordinator of Cuban Affairs, is \r\nfully aware of what we are talking about. The United \r\nStates Government lacks any moral authority to speak of \r\nhuman rights. Furthermore, in addition to a deplorable \r\nhistoric record of military aggressions and coups d’état, \r\nit has caused tens of thousands of disappearances, \r\nmurders and acts of torture. It is responsible for tens, \r\neven hundreds of extrajudicial executions, acts of \r\ntorture, abductions, secret f lights, secret prisons and a \r\nconcentration camp in Guantánamo. \r\nIf one believes that the economic blockade is \r\nnecessary as a pretext, one should do away with the \r\npretext and prove it. If the United States Government \r\nwishes to support Cuban agricultural purchases, then \r\nput an end to the discriminatory sale measures; allow \r\nprivate credit; accept the norms of international trade \r\nand authorize the use of vessels of other countries \r\nand do not penalize them for a six-month period; \r\nallow Cuban exports in exchange for the purchase of \r\nfoodstuffs, which have fallen drastically as a result of \r\nthe conditions that have been imposed by the United \r\nStates Government upon producers and which have \r\nled our Cuban importers to seek out better markets; \r\nadvocate a free f low of information; lift the blockade \r\nin the telecommunications sector; allow for a Cuban \r\nconnection to the submarine cables in order to improve \r\n14 12-58855\r\nA/67/PV.36\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe Acting President: I would like to make the \r\nfollowing announcement concerning the work of the \r\nplenary. Consideration of agenda item 32, “The role of \r\ndiamonds in fuelling conflict”, originally scheduled for \r\nThursday, 6 December, has been postponed to Monday, \r\n17 December.\r\nThe meeting rose at 4.35 p.m.\r\nMr. Gross, and it could start by sitting down for a serious \r\ndiscussion of the case with the Cuban Government.\r\nPresident Obama has the opportunity to make a \r\ndifference and to go down in history as having modified \r\na mistaken policy that has failed to work for more than \r\n50 years and has caused irreparable human damage \r\nand massive violations of human rights. Perhaps then \r\nMr. Godard could come back to the Assembly to say \r\nthat something has truly changed.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is the \r\nwish of the Assembly to conclude its consideration of \r\nagenda item 41?\r\n"
