It will be circulated as \r\ndocument A/67/53/Add.1 in all languages as soon as the \r\ntranslations are completed.\r\nIn connection with this item, I would like to recall \r\nthat the General Assembly, at its 2nd plenary meeting, \r\non 21 September, decided to consider agenda item 64 in \r\nplenary meeting and in the Third Committee, pursuant \r\nto resolution 65/281 of 17 June 2011.\r\nIn accordance with resolution 65/281, I now give \r\nthe f loor to Her Excellency Laura Dupuy Lasserre, \r\nPresident of the Human Rights Council.\r\nMs. Lasserre (Uruguay), President of the Human \r\nRights Council (spoke in Spanish): It is a great honour \r\nfor me to come before the Assembly today for the second \r\ntime to present the annual report of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil (A/67/53). I would also like to congratulate the \r\nnewly elected members of the Council and wish them \r\nsuccess in fulfilling their mandate.\r\nThe year 2012 marks the sixth since the establishment \r\nof the Human Rights Council and the first year since the \r\nreview of its working methods. Since then, the Council \r\nhas dealt with human rights situations in various parts \r\nof the world, aiming at addressing the root causes of \r\nhuman rights violations and raising awareness of them \r\nin the context of the different crises. This has been done \r\nthrough successful building on interregional coalitions \r\nand thanks to the strong desire of all members to deal \r\nwith human rights challenges, deteriorating situations \r\nand emergencies in a non-confrontational, consistent \r\nand coherent manner.\r\nAn example of that approach may be found in \r\nthe consideration of the human rights situation in the \r\nSyrian Arab Republic, which has dominated much of \r\nthe Council’s attention this year. We have held two \r\nspecial sessions and one emergency debate and have \r\nadopted resolutions on this in every regular session \r\nof 2012, following interactive dialogues with the \r\ncommission of inquiry. In its most recent resolution \r\non Syria, 21/26, adopted in September at the twenty-\r\nfirst session, the Council decided to extend the \r\nmandate of the commission of inquiry on Syria and \r\nto strengthen its capacity. I have therefore appointed \r\ntwo additional members to the commission, and I hope \r\nthat those additional appointments will be supported \r\nby strengthened support from the Office of the United \r\nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights for \r\nthe commission of inquiry, including through the \r\ndeployment of more staff on the ground.\r\nUnited Nations A/67/PV.37\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-seventh session\r\n37th plenary meeting\r\nWednesday, 14 November 2012, 10 a.m.\r\nNew York\r\nOffi cial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Jeremić  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Serbia)\r\n2 12-58933\r\nA/67/PV.37\r\nThe Council also adopted resolutions on Eritrea, \r\nBelarus, Myanmar, the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea, the Islamic Republic of Iran and Mali, as well \r\nas on Sri Lanka, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, \r\nHaiti, Libya, Côte d’Ivoire, Cambodia, the Sudan, South \r\nSudan, Guinea, Somalia and Yemen. With the decision \r\nto appoint a new Rapporteur for Eritrea, the Council \r\ndecided to transfer the communications that were being \r\nconsidered under the confidential complaint procedure. \r\nI wish to point out that the working methods of the \r\ncomplaint procedure have recently been improved, \r\nthanks to close cooperation between the working \r\ngroups on communications and on situations.\r\nThe Council also discussed the long-standing \r\nhuman rights situation in the occupied Palestinian \r\nterritories by, for example, establishing an international \r\nfact-finding mission to investigate the impact of the \r\nIsraeli settlements on the human rights of the Palestinian \r\npeople. The Council will consider the mission’s report \r\nat its next session, in March.\r\nI would like to emphasize that the full implementation \r\nof those and other important resolutions depends greatly \r\non the availability of additional resources, which will, I \r\nhope, be approved by the Assembly.\r\nDuring its past three regular sessions, the \r\nCouncil held, among other debates, a total of 16 panel \r\ndiscussions on subjects such as freedom of expression \r\non the Internet; sexual orientation and gender identity; \r\nreprisals; people with HIV/AIDS or living with those \r\nwith HIV/AIDS; minority rights; children’s rights and \r\nthe administration of justice; sport and the Olympic \r\nideal; the promotion and protection of human rights \r\nin a multicultural context, including by combating \r\nxenophobia, discrimination and intolerance; legal \r\nremedies and reparations for women victims of \r\nviolence; female human rights defenders; indigenous \r\npeoples’ access to justice; and technical cooperation \r\nin the context of the Universal Periodic Review \r\n(UPR). All those panels, having benefited from the \r\nexperience and perspective of a wide range of relevant \r\nactors — including States, academics, civil society, \r\nUnited Nations institutions, international and regional \r\norganizations and communications media — favoured \r\nsubstantive and constructive discussions on subjects \r\nthat at times might seem challenging or difficult to \r\ntackle.\r\nIn addition, the first high-level panel on \r\nmainstreaming a human rights perspective, held in \r\nFebruary, in which senior officials of United Nations \r\nagencies participated, focused on the area of human \r\nrights, development and cooperation. We hope that \r\nholding this panel annually will contribute to improving \r\nawareness, coordination, synergies and technical \r\ncooperation among the various relevant stakeholders, \r\nso as to address human rights challenges and have a \r\npositive impact on development efforts.\r\nThe high-level panel on mainstreaming human \r\nrights within the United Nations system, to be held \r\nduring the Council’s February session, is likely to focus \r\non human rights and the post-2015 development agenda, \r\nwith special attention to education. The panel could \r\nalso be a good opportunity to promote improvements on \r\nthe basis of the assessment of progress, achievements \r\nand challenges in mainstreaming human rights in \r\nthe United Nations system with regard to the current \r\nMillennium Development Goals. It could also provide \r\na timely input for the High-level Panel of Eminent \r\nPersons established by the Secretary-General, and for \r\nthe relevant special General Assembly event planned \r\nfor next year. Issues relating to the right to development \r\nwill therefore continue to have a prominent place in the \r\nCouncil’s work.\r\nWith regard to special procedures, the Council \r\nhas established new mandates, including two country \r\nmandates, namely, Special Rapporteurs on Belarus \r\nand Eritrea, and a thematic mandate, namely, the \r\nindependent expert on human rights obligations \r\nrelating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and \r\nsustainable environment. That brings the total number \r\nof mandates to 48.\r\nIn 2012, the Council heard for the first time the \r\nreports of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion \r\nof truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of \r\nnon-recurrence, the Independent Expert on the \r\npromotion of a democratic and equitable international \r\norder, the Working Group on the issue of human rights \r\nand transnational corporations and other business \r\nenterprises, and the Working Group on the issue of \r\ndiscrimination against women in law and in practice.\r\nThe high number of panels, together with the \r\ninteractive dialogues and general debates, provide a \r\nforum for fruitful and focused discussion on various \r\nhuman rights challenges. However, we should avoid \r\noverloading the Council’s programme of work. In \r\n2012, the Council adopted a total of 99 resolutions, \r\ndecisions and presidential statements. As already \r\nnoted, the number of interregional initiatives continues \r\nto increase, affirming the Council’s capacity to take \r\n12-58933 3\r\nA/67/PV.37\r\naction on important human rights issues. To name a few \r\nof the new cross-regional initiatives, I could mention \r\nthe safety of journalists, business and human rights, \r\ncorruption, and human rights and the environment. An \r\never-growing number of country-specific issues are \r\nalso being dealt with in this way.\r\nIn the past year, the Council addressed a wide \r\nrange of human rights issues relating to the freedom of \r\nexpression and assembly, including by adopting several \r\nresolutions in that area on, inter alia, the safety of \r\njournalists, peaceful protests and human rights on the \r\nInternet. The Council also discussed issues related to \r\nthe right to development, extreme poverty, the right to \r\nfood, maternal mortality and the enjoyment of cultural \r\nrights, as well as the rights of vulnerable groups such \r\nas the elderly. \r\nMany of the resolutions were adopted without a \r\nvote, again demonstrating the capacity of the Council \r\nto agree on issues related to the protection of those \r\nmost in need. Resolution 19/8, adopted in March, \r\non the freedom of religion and belief is of particular \r\nimportance, emphasizing that freedom of religion or \r\nbelief and freedom of expression are interdependent, \r\ninterrelated and mutually reinforcing. \r\nIn June, the Council held a constructive discussion \r\non the line between freedom of expression and \r\nincitement to hatred and violence. It was a follow-\r\nup to the historic Human Rights Council resolution \r\n16/18, adopted by consensus in March 2011, entitled \r\n“Combating intolerance, negative stereotyping and \r\nstigmatization of, and discrimination, incitement to \r\nviolence, and violence against persons based on religion \r\nor belief”. In that resolution, the Council called on all \r\nStates and other stakeholders to take concrete measures \r\nto foster a national culture of religious tolerance, peace \r\nand respect. \r\nIt should be pointed out that the Office of the United \r\nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights has \r\nalso been particularly active in that issue, organizing \r\na series of expert regional workshops on incitement \r\nto national, racial or religious hatred, as reflected in \r\ninternational human rights law. The conclusions and \r\nrecommendations stemming from those workshops \r\nwill certainly help the Council make progress on that \r\ndelicate issue.\r\nThe number of dignitaries addressing the Council \r\nduring the high-level segment of the February-March \r\nsession every year constantly increases, demonstrating \r\nthe growing interest in the work of the Council as the \r\nmain human rights body of the United Nations. That \r\nis further borne out by the increasing number of civil \r\nsociety representatives attending Council proceedings, \r\nas well as parallel events organized on its sidelines. \r\nThere has been an average of almost 200 accredited \r\nnon-governmental organizations (NGOs) and a hundred \r\nside events at each session. New features stemming from \r\nthe outcome of the Human Rights Council review have \r\nbeen implemented to facilitate remote participation, \r\nthrough video messages, by national human rights \r\ninstitutions that comply with the Paris Principles and \r\nof NGOs accredited locally by NGOs with consultative \r\nstatus at the Economic and Social Council so that they \r\ncan contribute to our work.\r\nThe active participation and contribution of civil \r\nsociety organizations are fundamental to the work of \r\nthe Human Rights Council, making it a unique forum \r\namong other United Nations intergovernmental bodies. \r\nIt is essential to the Council’s credibility that human \r\nrights defenders and other civil society actors can \r\ncontribute to the Council’s work and its mechanisms \r\nin a free, open and safe environment that protects and \r\npromotes their own human rights.\r\nIn that context, we must deeply lament the increase \r\nin the number of reported cases of intimidation or \r\nthreats, as well as physical attacks on and arbitrary \r\ndetention, torture and ill-treatment of those who have \r\ncooperated with the United Nations, including the \r\nCouncil and its mechanisms. In line with the outcome \r\nof the Council’s review, I personally have condemned \r\nintimidation measures and reprisals in the context or \r\non the margins of the Council and Universal Periodic \r\nReview  meetings. I wish to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report on reprisals (A/HRC/21/18) \r\nand for sending a clear message of support in that \r\nconnection when he personally addressed the Council \r\nin September, as well as during the panel discussion on \r\nthat topic at that same session. \r\nI would like to share a few remarks on the \r\nsecond cycle of the Universal Periodic Review. As \r\nthe Assembly knows, the first cycle ended with the \r\nreview of 193 Member States by the Working Group \r\non the UPR, which was a remarkable achievement of a \r\ntruly universal mechanism. The UPR is certainly seen as \r\na valuable tool for national dialogue and consideration \r\nof necessary actions. The second cycle, which began \r\nin May, is now considering the implementation of \r\n4 12-58933\r\nA/67/PV.37\r\nrecommendations made in the past four years and the \r\npending national challenges.\r\nThe second cycle will be crucial to consolidating the \r\nUPR as a significant tool in addressing the protection \r\nand promotion of human rights throughout the world \r\nin a non-confrontational, objective, depoliticized and \r\nconstructive way. It is essential to ensure that the \r\nmain achievements of the first cycle are preserved, \r\nin particular the 100 per cent record in terms of the \r\npresentation of reports by high-level delegations, which \r\nis a first in the United Nations system. I would like \r\nto appeal to all Member States to provide support for \r\nthat valuable universal mechanism and to ensure that it \r\nremains comprehensive during the second cycle, in line \r\nwith its legal foundations and its spirit.\r\nIn that regard, many of the participants here today \r\nhave helped to ensure the presence of delegations \r\ncoming from countries far from Geneva and without \r\na permanent mission there. In addition, bilateral and \r\nregional cooperation has also been extended for the \r\npreparation of various national reports. That has \r\nbeen particularly difficult in some cases, and I would \r\nlike to thank those delegations in particular for their \r\nendeavour. The Council has furthered its efforts to \r\nsupport the participation of least developed countries \r\nby establishing a Voluntary Technical Assistance Trust \r\nFund to Support the Participation of Least Developed \r\nCountries and Small Island Developing States in the \r\nwork of the Council, which provides, inter alia, training \r\nand capacity-building. \r\nBefore I conclude, I would like to briefly mention \r\nthe significant challenges facing the Human Rights \r\nCouncil in terms of resources required to continue its \r\nactivities. \r\nFirst, allow me to inform the Assembly that a \r\ntask force has been set up to follow up on certain \r\nissues stemming from the outcome of the Council’s \r\nreview process, including the need to enhance \r\nsecretariat services to the Council, accessibility to \r\nthe Council’s work for persons with disabilities, and \r\nthe use of information technology. While most of \r\nthe recommendations of the task force do not require \r\nadditional resources for their implementation, I would \r\nlike to emphasize in particular the need to strengthen \r\nconference services at the United Nations Office at \r\nGeneva. That could be done within existing resources \r\nby transferring existing vacant translator and editor \r\nposts from New York to Geneva. That is, indeed, most \r\nimportant in order to provide adequate conference \r\nservices for the Universal Periodic Review, which has \r\nbeen underfunded since its work began, in 2008. \r\nAs I stated last year (see A/66/PV.49), reports \r\nare increasingly not being distributed in all official \r\nlanguages before their consideration. That is a serious \r\nimpediment for meetings of bodies such as the Working \r\nGroup on the Universal Periodic Review, which relies \r\non the ability of the States to consult and review in \r\nadvance the documentation for each State under review. \r\nOther recommendations by the task force will \r\nrequire additional resources for their implementation. \r\nThey deal with, inter alia, the need to ensure sustainable \r\nwebcast coverage of Council meetings by strengthening \r\nthe capacity of the Department of Public Information in \r\nGeneva, as well as by securing regular budget resources \r\nfor the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner \r\nfor Human Rights for that purpose. Indeed, so far the \r\nOffice has relied on voluntary contributions to provide \r\nthat essential service for the Council. Bearing in mind \r\nthat the Council has no more resources for summary \r\nrecords, it would be crucial to at least be able to secure \r\nregular budget resources for the webcast, as it remains \r\nthe only official archive of the meetings of the Council \r\nand the Universal Periodic Review. \r\nAnother area where resources are also needed is \r\naccessibility of parliamentary or official documents, as \r\nwell as other fundamental documents, for persons with \r\ndisabilities. \r\nAllow me now refer to other budgetary issues \r\nconcerning the Council. This past year 29 resolutions \r\nand decisions or presidential declarations have been \r\nadopted. The ever-increasing number of special \r\nprocedures and new mandates to be supported and/\r\nor implemented by the Office of the United Nations \r\nHigh Commissioner carries significant resource \r\nimplications. The new resource requirements of \r\nHuman Rights Council mandates in 2012 — according \r\nto the preliminary estimate of the Office of the \r\nHigh Commissioner, which includes conference \r\nservices — total over $12 million. \r\nIn response to urgent mandates created by the \r\nCouncil, the Secretary-General last year submitted \r\nproposals to the Assembly on financing unforeseen \r\nand extraordinary expenses arising from the Council’s \r\nresolutions and decisions. However, the Advisory \r\nCommittee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions \r\nrecommended that the existing procedures for meeting \r\n12-58933 5\r\nA/67/PV.37\r\nthose unforeseen and extraordinary expenses not \r\nrelated to peace and security be utilized. That means \r\nthat the Secretary-General, and therefore the Council, \r\nmust explain why additional requirements cannot be \r\nimmediately absorbed within the approved existing \r\nresources. We hope, however, that despite that, the \r\nCouncil will still be able to fulfil one of its principal \r\nmandates, which is to respond in a timely manner to \r\nemerging human rights crises in the world. \r\nAlthough I am fully aware of the current financial \r\nsituation due to the crisis, I would like to rely on \r\nthe cooperation and support of all Member States in \r\nensuring that those issues are addressed, through \r\nthe Fifth Committee, by positively considering the \r\nbest options on how to tackle the funding of the new \r\nmandates that arise from the Council’s resolutions and \r\ndecisions, at the same time not forgetting the needs of \r\nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner \r\nfor Human Rights, particularly if we want it to deliver \r\nmore technical cooperation in the face of the increasing \r\nrequests from the field. \r\nI have held the presidency since June 2011, and my \r\nterm will end in December this year. I therefore wish to \r\nconvey my commitment to a successful transition of the \r\nCouncil presidency. Similarly, I hope that the General \r\nAssembly will continue to provide its full and efficient \r\nsupport to the Human Rights Council during its seventh \r\ncycle, in 2013. \r\nThis morning, on behalf of my successor, I invited \r\nthe President of the General Assembly to attend the \r\nopening of the twenty-second session of the Council, \r\non 25 February 2013, and to commemorate on that \r\noccasion the twentieth anniversary of the Vienna \r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nobserver of the European Union.\r\nMr. Vrailas (European Union): I have the honour \r\nto speak on behalf of the European Union. The acceding \r\ncountry Croatia; the candidate countries the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Iceland \r\nand Serbia; the countries of the Stabilization and \r\nAssociation Process and potential candidates Albania \r\nand Bosnia and Herzegovina; as well as the Republic \r\nof Moldova and Georgia, align themselves with this \r\ndeclaration.\r\nThe European Union (EU) would like to thank the \r\nPresident of the Human Rights Council, Ambassador \r\nLaura Dupuy Lasserre, for presenting the Human Rights \r\nCouncil’s seventh annual report (A/67/53) to the General \r\nAssembly. We also appreciated the opportunity to hold \r\nan interactive dialogue with the Council President.\r\nSince the establishment of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, the European Union has been a strong \r\nsupporter of this main United Nations human rights \r\nbody. The Council has strengthened the ability of the \r\nUnited Nations to ensure that all persons are able to \r\nenjoy all human rights. We attach great importance to \r\nits credibility and effectiveness and will continue to \r\nmake every effort to ensure that it is able to address \r\nsituations of violations of human rights, including gross \r\nand systematic violations, and to respond promptly to \r\nhuman rights emergencies, but also to improve human \r\nrights standards worldwide through systematic work on \r\nvarious thematic issues.\r\nIn view of this, the European Union is very pleased \r\nto note that the Council has maintained its leadership \r\nin addressing human rights situations. In particular, the \r\nCouncil’s prompt response to the crisis in the Syrian \r\nArab Republic is highly important, including its holding \r\nseveral special sessions and an urgent debate, as well as \r\nextending the mandate of the commission of inquiry \r\nand establishing a mandate for a special rapporteur, \r\nonce the commission’s mandate has been completed. \r\nThe Council has also demonstrated its commitment to \r\nproviding technical assistance and capacity-building \r\nto the Governments of Libya, Yemen, the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo, Guinea, Afghanistan, \r\nCambodia and South Sudan to promote human rights. \r\nThe European Union hopes that the Council will \r\ncontinue to follow situations where technical assistance \r\nand capacity-building can make a difference and take \r\naction where necessary.\r\nServing as a member of the Council entails \r\nimportant responsibilities. Assembly resolution 60/251 \r\nprovided that members elected to the Council shall \r\nuphold the highest standards in the promotion and \r\nprotection of human rights. We encourage all to pay full \r\nattention to the human rights record and human rights \r\ncommitments of States at the time of the election of \r\nmembers of the Human Rights Council and throughout \r\ntheir membership.\r\nThe European Union also attaches the greatest \r\nimportance to the special procedures, one of the most \r\nvital functions of the Council. In order to allow the \r\nspecial procedures to perform their role, it is crucial \r\n6 12-58933\r\nA/67/PV.37\r\nthat mandate holders are able to independently assess \r\nand draw the Council’s attention to human rights \r\nissues and situations. The European Union welcomes \r\nthe new mandates established on Belarus and Eritrea, \r\ngiven the deteriorating situation in those countries. \r\nWe welcome the extension of the mandates of the \r\nSpecial Rapporteurs on the situation of human rights \r\nin the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Burma/\r\nMyanmar and Iran, and the renewal of the mandates \r\nof the Independent Experts on the situation of human \r\nrights in Côte d’Ivoire, the Sudan, Somalia and Haiti.\r\nThematic special procedures play an equally \r\noutstanding role, through their research, country-\r\nspecific visits and valuable contribution to the better \r\nunderstanding of the content of specific human \r\nrights and their contribution to the enhancement and \r\nrealization of human rights standards. Among the \r\nmany thematic special procedures, the European \r\nUnion would like to highlight the new mandate of the \r\nSpecial Rapporteur on the promotion of truth, justice, \r\nreparation and guarantees of non-recurrence.\r\nThe ability of mandate holders to undertake \r\ncountry visits and establish direct contact with the \r\nrelevant governmental structures and other national \r\nand regional stakeholders, especially civil society, is \r\nof crucial importance. We regret the refusal of some \r\nGovernments to cooperate with mandate holders. \r\nAll European Union member States have extended \r\na standing invitation to the special procedures, and \r\nthe EU calls upon all United Nations Members to do \r\nlikewise and to actively cooperate with them.\r\nOver the years, the Council has also contributed \r\nto the further development and understanding of \r\ninternational norms and standards in the field of human \r\nrights. The Council is also mandated to monitor the \r\nimplementation of international human rights law \r\nand standards. Only through objective monitoring \r\nand reporting can it identify the needs of victims and \r\npossible areas for capacity-building and technical \r\nassistance to States. We are happy that activities to \r\nstrengthen international cooperation and develop \r\ncapacity-building and technical measures remained \r\nstrong areas for involvement in the Council.\r\nThe Universal Periodic Review (UPR) is a truly \r\nuniversal mechanism dealing with all human rights and \r\napplicable to all Member States without discrimination. \r\nParticipation by all States in the first cycle is to the great \r\ncredit of the process. We encourage all States to ensure \r\nthat universal participation is maintained through the \r\nsecond cycle as well. Ultimately, the outcome of the \r\nUniversal Periodic Review process depends not only \r\non the quality of the recommendations, but also on the \r\ncommitment to implement them. The European Union \r\nis committed to continuing to support countries in \r\nimplementing their UPR recommendations.\r\nThe Human Rights Council also has an important \r\nrole to play as a forum for dialogue and exchange of best \r\npractices and experiences on a wide range of thematic \r\nhuman rights issues and thus for the advancement of \r\nthe human rights agenda. The European Union wishes \r\nin particular to highlight and welcome the following \r\nimportant developments.\r\nFirst, enjoyment of human rights by women \r\nconstituted a major theme at the Human Rights Council \r\nduring the period under review. The Council strongly \r\ncondemned all acts of violence against women and girls, \r\nand it should continue working on recommendations on \r\nhow to create and strengthen linkages and synergies \r\namong the Council mechanisms and with other relevant \r\nintergovernmental processes. On the elimination of \r\ndiscrimination against women, the Council called \r\non States to ensure full representation and full and \r\nequal participation in political, social and economic \r\ndecision-making.\r\nSecondly, the Council adopted guiding principles \r\non extreme poverty and human rights as a useful tool \r\nfor States in formulating and implementing poverty \r\nreduction and eradication policies. Thirdly, the Council \r\ncontinued its important work on the rights of the child, \r\nwith a full-day annual panel discussion dedicated to \r\nthe issue of administration of justice and an omnibus \r\nresolution on the rights of the child, presented jointly \r\nby the European Union and the Latin American and \r\nCaribbean Group. Fourthly, the Council addressed the \r\nhuman right to safe drinking water and sanitation, which \r\nis derived from the right to an adequate standard of \r\nliving and inextricably related to the right to the highest \r\nattainable standards of physical and mental health, by \r\nadopting a resolution on the issue of financing.\r\nDuring the reporting period, the Council also \r\naddressed human rights on the Internet and reaffirmed \r\nthat the same rights that people have offline must \r\nalso be protected online, in particular freedom \r\nof expression. We believe that this issue deserves \r\ncontinued monitoring.\r\n12-58933 7\r\nA/67/PV.37\r\nThe European Union reiterates its strong \r\ncondemnation of acts of reprisal and intimidation of \r\ncivil society representatives attending the Human \r\nRights Council and cooperating with human rights \r\nmechanisms and the Office of the United Nations \r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights. Civil society \r\norganizations and national human rights institutions \r\nbring extremely valuable contributions to the Council’s \r\nwork. Their ability to interact with the Council must be \r\npreserved.\r\nIn conclusion, let me reiterate the European Union’s \r\nstrong commitment to contributing to the work of the \r\nHuman Rights Council and to further strengthening its \r\nrole to contribute to the development of international \r\nhuman rights law, to systematically uphold and ensure \r\nthe implementation of existing international norms and \r\nstandards, and to promote the observance by all States \r\nof all human rights and fundamental freedoms.\r\nMr. Sparber (Liechtenstein): We welcome \r\nPresident Dupuy Lasserre back to New York and \r\nthank her for her comprehensive report to the General \r\nAssembly on the work of the Human Rights Council \r\n(A/67/53). \r\nIn the past year, the Council has further consolidated \r\nits work and has again shown its readiness to address \r\nurgent and grave human rights violations. The Council \r\nhas proved, better than other United Nations bodies, \r\nthat it is a voice of accountability for the most serious \r\nhuman rights violations, in full accordance with its \r\nmandate. \r\nWe welcome the continuous engagement of the \r\nCouncil with regard to the situation in Syria and \r\ncommend the commission of inquiry for its work, in \r\nparticular in collecting evidence that can be used in \r\njudicial proceedings to hold to account those responsible \r\nfor the gravest human rights violations and violations of \r\ninternational humanitarian law. \r\nFurthermore, we welcome the Council’s call \r\non the Sri Lankan Government to fulfil its relevant \r\nlegal obligations and commitment to initiate credible \r\nand independent actions to ensure justice, equity, \r\naccountability and reconciliation for all Sri Lankans \r\nfor the serious human rights violations and violations \r\nof international humanitarian law in the final phase of \r\nthe civil war. \r\nWe also welcome the consensus decisions of the \r\nCouncil on the human rights situations in Mali and \r\nEritrea. Unfortunately, the Council did not take urgent \r\naction to the extent desirable with regard to the human \r\nrights situation in Bahrain.\r\nWe welcome the work undertaken by the Human \r\nRights Council on the safety of journalists and on the \r\npromotion and protection of human rights in transitional \r\njustice. The Council thereby shows its ability to \r\naddress current and emerging areas of concern to the \r\ninternational community with a view to strengthening \r\nsafeguards in the promotion and protection of human \r\nrights, particularly in situations of fundamental societal \r\nand political change. We believe that in executing its \r\nmandate the Council should continue to be guided by \r\nthe principles enshrined in the Vienna Declaration and \r\nProgramme of Action. The Vienna Declaration and \r\nProgramme of Action unconditionally reaffirms the \r\nuniversal nature of all human rights and fundamental \r\nfreedoms and commits States to universal respect for, \r\nand observance and protection of, all human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms for all. \r\nAgainst that background, we have followed with \r\nsome concern the discussion within the Council on \r\ntraditional values of humankind. While we understand \r\nthat there might be added value for States to consider \r\nparticular circumstances when complying with \r\ninternational human rights obligations, we are also \r\nconvinced that such circumstances cannot be invoked \r\nto alter the fundamental entitlement of any human being \r\nto the full protection of her or his human rights — an \r\nentitlement that directly derives from her or his inherent \r\ndignity as a human being. We hope that the Council \r\nwill heed those concerns in its future discussions on \r\nthe issue.\r\nThe Human Rights Council has established itself \r\nas the central standing body of the United Nations \r\nto address all dimensions of human rights questions, \r\nincluding setting standards, implementation and \r\nemergency response. This year marks a particular \r\nmoment in the Council’s existence as one of its central \r\ninstruments to promote and protect human rights — the \r\nUniversal Periodic Review (UPR) — has entered its \r\nsecond cycle. It is also a time of particular challenges \r\nfor the UPR. During its second cycle, the UPR must \r\nprove its validity in terms of concrete results and \r\nimprovements in the promotion and protection of \r\nhuman rights around the globe. \r\nProgress in the implementation of recommendations \r\nis essential to secure the legitimacy of the UPR among \r\n8 12-58933\r\nA/67/PV.37\r\nsummarizes the important role that the Council plays in \r\nstrengthening and defending human rights.\r\nMy country’s delegation expresses its sincere \r\nthanks to the States members of the General Assembly \r\nfor the trust they placed in the State of Kuwait by \r\nelecting it to the Human Rights Council for the period \r\nfrom 2011 to 2013. We emphasize the commitment of \r\nthe State of Kuwait, through its membership in that \r\nimportant body, to exerting its most sincere effort \r\nand to dedicating its full potential to strengthening \r\nand defending human rights principles and to support \r\nthe work of the Human Rights Council in combating \r\nracism, extremism and discrimination. We also value \r\nthe constructive activities carried out by Member States \r\nin that field.\r\nThe advancement of peoples and nations is measured \r\nby their respect for human rights. Furthermore, the \r\nCharter of the United Nations urges Member States to \r\nadvance the principles of human rights and protect the \r\nfundamental freedoms of the individual. That requires \r\nus all to stand side by side in our effort to achieve those \r\nprinciples, since the humanitarian aspect must rise \r\nabove all differences and thus no race, religion or sect \r\nmay prevent an individual from obtaining all of his or \r\nher rights.\r\nThe State of Kuwait emphasizes its adherence to the \r\nprinciples of human rights. The Kuwaiti Constitution \r\nof 1962 is in harmony with the rules, organizations \r\nand conventions on human rights. The Constitution \r\nhas consolidated those rights, such as the right to \r\nlife and freedom of opinion and expression. Article \r\n7 of the Constitution states that justice, freedom and \r\nequality are the pillars of society and that cooperation \r\nand compassion form the bonds linking all citizens. \r\nArticle 29 provides that all people enjoy equal human \r\ndignity, with equal rights and duties before the law and \r\nwithout discrimination based on race, origin, language \r\nor religion.\r\nThe State of Kuwait believes in the role of civil \r\nsociety institutions and in freedom of the press and \r\nexpression. It has legislated a number of relevant laws, \r\nsuch as laws no. 3/2006 and 61/2007. Both relate to \r\nregulating the work of various media outlets, including \r\nprint, television and radio, in such a way as to guarantee \r\na more open and democratic atmosphere, whereby the \r\nmedia can address any political, social and economic \r\nissues of Kuwaiti public affairs.\r\nStates and civil society. States should make a particular \r\neffort to show that a review by their peers can directly \r\nbenefit citizens of all parts of the world without \r\ndistinction. The legitimacy of the UPR is grounded not \r\nleast in the fact that every single State has been reviewed \r\nunder the process during the first cycle. Preserving \r\nthe UPR’s universality must therefore be the highest \r\npriority for States, in particular of the members of the \r\nCouncil, as well as of the Presidents of the Council \r\nand the General Assembly and the Secretary-General. \r\nStates have a collective responsibility in ensuring that \r\nthe UPR remains a cornerstone of the United Nations \r\nhuman rights architecture. \r\nRefusal to cooperate under the UPR is a direct \r\nchallenge to the universal and equal applicability of \r\nagreements in the field of human rights. Refusal risks \r\ntaking us back to an understanding that had been \r\novercome, one that plagued the Council’s precursor \r\nbody, where political interests and selectivity often \r\nprevailed. We therefore hope that all States will continue \r\nto honour the principle of inclusive and transparent \r\nmultilateralism by again submitting themselves under \r\nthe UPR.\r\nThe review if the status of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil was accomplished just over a year ago by the \r\nGeneral Assembly. Not all expectations have been met, \r\nbut a number of positive achievements can be cited. The \r\nexisting channels for funding the Council’s urgent and \r\nextraordinary decisions seem to be open, in principle, \r\nto the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner \r\nfor Human Rights, if not at all times. The consensus \r\nto preserve the current institutional relationship among \r\nthe High Commissioner, the General Assembly and \r\nthe Council has allowed for a pragmatic approach to \r\nimprove information-sharing and cooperation within \r\nthe agreed set-up. \r\nFinally, the realignment of the Council’s cycle \r\nseems to have benefited both the Council and the \r\nGeneral Assembly, while a number of practical \r\nimplications might still need to be addressed. At the \r\nvery least, the realignment has allowed us to welcome \r\nthe current President of the Council twice in New York. \r\nWe look forward to a fruitful exchange with her in the \r\nThird Committee this afternoon.\r\nMr. Alhajeri (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nGeneral Assembly is discussing today one of the most \r\nimportant items on its agenda. I would like to thank the \r\nHuman Rights Council for its report (A/67/53), which \r\n12-58933 9\r\nA/67/PV.37\r\nThe State of Kuwait believes absolutely in the \r\nrequirement to honour human rights. For its part, it will \r\nspare no effort to defend those rights. It stresses that \r\npoint in its participation in all international forums, \r\nincluding United Nations bodies and governmental \r\nand non-governmental organizations relevant to human \r\nrights. We affirm the need for sincere cooperation in \r\nthe sphere of human rights in working towards the \r\ngreater benefit and security of our peoples, to which \r\nwe all aspire.\r\nMr. León González (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nHuman Rights Council grew out of the need to confront \r\nthe double standards, confrontation and political \r\nmanipulation of its predecessor, the Commission on \r\nHuman Rights. We must prevent a return in the Council \r\nto the harmful practices that plunged the Commission \r\ninto disgrace. Cuba has clearly stated that it rejects \r\nthe imposition of those practices. However, we are \r\nconcerned about the current trend to exalt in the Council \r\nselectivity and double standards in its consideration \r\nof human rights situations when cooperation and \r\nrespectful dialogue should guide its work.\r\nGiven that reality, the Universal Periodic Review \r\n(UPR) is the only existing universal mechanism for \r\nmaking comprehensive assessments of the human \r\nrights situation in all countries. It is the main factor \r\ndistinguishing the Council from the Commission. The \r\nUPR has proved itself to be a means for international \r\ncooperation on human rights, on the basis of constructive \r\ndialogue and respect for the principles of universality, \r\nobjectivity, impartiality and non-selectivity.\r\nCuba participated energetically in the process of \r\ncreating the Council. In addition, my country was an \r\nactive and successful negotiator at every stage of the \r\nreview process of the Council, in an effort to perfect \r\nand consolidate the work accomplished in its first five \r\nyears. \r\nHowever, as we have said, double standards have \r\npermeated the Council’s work. On the one hand, many \r\ncountries have emphasized the promotion of themes \r\nmanipulated according to their own interests, such as \r\ncountry-specific resolutions, commissions of inquiry \r\nand fact-finding missions, despite the significant \r\ncost that some entail. On the other hand, those same \r\ncountries block resolutions presented by developing \r\nStates, claiming budgetary constraints and arguing that \r\nactions must be carried out within existing resources. \r\nThat dichotomy was widely spoken of in the Human \r\nArticle 31 of the Kuwaiti Constitution refers to \r\nthe protection of human beings from torture, abuse \r\nand indignities. Such an atmosphere of freedom and \r\nopenness will help to guarantee the creation of a healthy \r\nenvironment and thus generate dialogue exchange and \r\nattract visions and ideas from all walks of life. It will \r\nalso ensure popular participation in expressing and \r\ninfluencing political decision-making in the State of \r\nKuwait. That will in turn guarantee greater strength \r\nand stability in my country, leading to prosperity, \r\nadvancement and innovation.\r\nArticle 35 of the Constitution states that freedom \r\nof religion and belief is absolute. The State of Kuwait \r\nhas supported broader dissemination of the cultures \r\nof tolerance and understanding through dialogue. In \r\nthat context, I am pleased to refer to the initiative of \r\nHis Highness the Amir of the State of Kuwait, Sheikh \r\nSabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, to establish \r\nthe Universal Centrist Approach Centre, which has \r\nhosted several international conferences in support \r\nof necessary proposals to counter extremist thought. \r\nFurthermore, Government bodies have established \r\nprogrammes targeting all segments of the society with \r\na view to promoting moderate and centrist thought \r\nthroughout society.\r\nIn affirming the established principles of \r\nKuwaiti foreign policy that emphasize strengthened \r\ninternational peace and security, rejection of violence \r\nand respect for human rights, my country provides \r\nnumerous forms of humanitarian aid through \r\ngovernmental and non-governmental organizations and \r\nbodies, to all peoples, in its endeavours to strengthen \r\nhuman rights and human dignity. It has also increased \r\nannual voluntary contributions to the Office of the \r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights \r\nto support its efforts and its mission, as mandated by \r\nthe Member States.\r\nAs we discuss the issue of human rights and the need \r\nto respect the humanity of the individual, we cannot but \r\nstrongly condemn the oppressive Israeli practices and \r\npolicies that persist in violating the most basic human \r\nrights of the unarmed Palestinian people in the occupied \r\nterritories. We call on the international community to \r\ntake up its responsibility to force Israel, the occupying \r\nPower, to abide by resolutions of international \r\nlegitimacy, to cease its aggressive, tyrannical policies, \r\nand to respect international humanitarian law and the \r\nprinciples of human rights.\r\n10 12-58933\r\nA/67/PV.37\r\nRights Council during the period covered by the report \r\nbefore us (A/67/53).\r\nFor Cuba, as long as an unjust and exclusionary \r\ninternational economic and political order persists, the \r\nCouncil should continue to speak out in favour of a \r\ndemocratic and equitable international order. As long \r\nas unilateral coercive measures are imposed and harsh \r\nblockades continue, such as the one Cuba has suffered \r\nunder for more than 50 years, the Council should reject \r\nsuch practices and demand that they cease. \r\nThe special procedures of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil should be guided by respect for the principles \r\nof objectivity and impartiality and must respect the \r\ncode of conduct that was adopted during the Council’s \r\ninstitution-building process. The work of human rights \r\ntreaty bodies should also follow similar guidelines. The \r\nCouncil must ensure that the recovery of the right to \r\ninternational solidarity is not postponed, with a view \r\nto tackling the serious challenges presented by serious \r\neconomic, financial, environmental and social crises, \r\nas well as energy and nutrition crises, that plague the \r\nplanet.\r\nFaced with the tendency that the most developed \r\ncountries have succeeded in imposing on the Human \r\nRights Council, Cuba reiterates its willingness to \r\ncooperate with that body and with the human rights \r\nmechanisms of the United Nations system and its \r\nuniversal and non-discriminatory institutions. We \r\naffirm our openness to dialogue with all States, \r\nsustained through mutual respect, acceptance of equal \r\nsovereignty and recognition of the right of all peoples \r\nto choose their own political systems and institutions.\r\nMr. Kodama (Japan): I thank the President of the \r\nHuman Rights Council for her report today and for her \r\ncontinued dedication to the Council.\r\nThe Human Rights Council is responsible for \r\npromoting universal respect for the protection of all \r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms of all persons. \r\nWe would like to stress that it was established in order \r\nto address violations of human rights and to make \r\nrecommendations thereon. Since its establishment, \r\nthe Council has steadily and steadfastly established \r\nits track record in the course of actively responding to \r\nhuman rights violations\r\nWe particularly appreciate the fact that the Council \r\nhas acted to address the serious violations of human \r\nrights in Syria during its regular sessions and also in four \r\nspecial sessions. Such actions include the establishment \r\nof an independent international commission of inquiry, \r\nthe commission’s special investigation into the \r\natrocities in El-Houleh and the strengthening of the \r\ncapacity of the commission. It was a conscious decision \r\non the part of the Council to adopt several resolutions \r\non the matter in order to send strong messages to the \r\nSyrian Government.\r\nFurthermore, in a sign of progress, some country-\r\nspecific resolutions were submitted to the Council by \r\nvarious Member States or regional groups, and, upon \r\nobtaining cross-regional support, several were adopted \r\nby consensus. The Government of Japan supports the \r\nuse of such a mechanism of the Council to address and \r\nrespond to human rights violations.\r\nThe Universal Periodic Review (UPR) is a truly \r\ninnovative mechanism within the Council, which can \r\neffectively improve the human rights situations in \r\nall Member States through their voluntary follow-up \r\nactions. The second cycle of reviews started this year. It \r\nis important that we pay attention to the implementation \r\nof the accepted recommendations by each Member \r\nState from the first cycle. The second review of Japan \r\nwas conducted on 31 October, and the draft report \r\nof the Working Group was adopted on 2 November. \r\nJapan will seriously examine the recommendations by \r\nMember States, and our response will be announced \r\nin the upcoming Human Rights Council session. The \r\nspecial procedures complement the UPR by addressing \r\nparticularly serious human rights violations around the \r\nworld. In that regard, each Member State should issue a \r\nstanding invitation to the special procedures.\r\nWe highly appreciate the initiative of the High \r\nCommissioner for Human Rights to strengthen the \r\nhuman rights treaty body system, and we also welcome \r\nthe publication of her report on the matter. Japan \r\nattaches great importance to improving the efficiency \r\nof the working methods of the treaty bodies so that they \r\ncan make the most of limited resources and effectively \r\nimplement their mandates as specified in the treaties. \r\nIt is also important to ensure the independence of the \r\ntreaty bodies and their members. On the basis of the \r\ndiscussions in Geneva, Japan looks forward to engaging \r\nin the General Assembly process to craft reasonable \r\nand efficient working methods for the treaty bodies.\r\nLet us remember that the Council was also \r\nestablished to realize the mainstreaming of human \r\nrights — that is, to integrate a human rights perspective \r\ninto all activities of the United Nations. The role of \r\n12-58933 11\r\nA/67/PV.37\r\nMexico is aware that there is much room for \r\nimprovement in the way in which we address certain \r\nquestions, in particular national situations, cooperation \r\nwith special procedures and effective use of the limited \r\nexisting resources. The institutional agreements on \r\nwhich the Council is based allows for constant evolution \r\nof its procedures and mechanisms.\r\nWe must recognize that, due to inertia, there \r\nis duplication of activities and, in general, we do \r\nnot promote an adequate division of labour. The \r\nThird Committee has an important responsibility for \r\npreventing such duplication, promoting appropriate \r\ncomplementarity of efforts and seeking value added in \r\nthe way we address issues. We must ask ourselves if \r\nwe are providing due attention to and follow-up on the \r\nwork of the roughly 47 human rights procedures that in \r\nrecent weeks were subject to interactive dialogue with \r\nthe Third Committee.\r\nGiven the pressing budgetary needs, it has become \r\nnecessary to reflect on the way in which States can \r\ncontribute to an increase in and efficient distribution \r\nof the resources on which the human rights machinery \r\ndepends, as well as to the most efficient use of available \r\nresources. In that regard, we also wish to support the \r\nremarks to be made later this morning by the Turkish \r\nAmbassador on behalf of a large group of countries. \r\nMexico will continue to promote a comprehensive and \r\njoint reflection on the topic with a view to achieving \r\nconcrete results.\r\nThe President took the Chair.\r\nThe Council must continue to develop international \r\nstandards for the promotion and protection of human \r\nrights, and not fall into unnecessary legislative \r\ninflation, the results of which will not necessarily \r\nguarantee adequate protection of human rights in the \r\nlong term. We must promote greater coherence in the \r\ninternational normative framework. \r\nAnother institutional challenge for the Council is \r\nthe need to broaden technical support in its broadest \r\nsense. Above all, the Council and the Office of the \r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights \r\nmust provide States with tools to create and consolidate \r\nefficient regulatory frameworks and implement public \r\npolicies in favour of human rights.\r\nThe second cycle of the Universal Periodic \r\nReview presents a fine opportunity to promote plans \r\nfor cooperation and appropriate follow-up on the \r\nthe Third Committee of the General Assembly, as a \r\nuniversal body that includes all States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations, is also important for that purpose. We \r\nexpect the Council and the Third Committee to fulfil \r\ntheir roles by making use of their respective advantages.\r\nJapan was elected a member of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil for the 2013-2015 term at the election held \r\nin this Hall during the Assembly’s 34th meeting, on \r\n12 November. We appreciate the support and trust \r\nshown by Member States. Let me assure the Assembly \r\nthat Japan is mindful of its great responsibilities. Japan \r\nwill continue to conduct its diplomacy by promoting \r\nsuch universal values as human rights and democracy \r\nand will act for the protection and promotion of human \r\nrights in the international community.\r\nMr. De Léon Huerta (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nIn 2005, the international community recognized the \r\nneed to raise the level of treatment of human rights \r\nin our Organization by establishing a new body for \r\nstrengthening the work of the United Nations in the \r\npromotion and protection of human rights around the \r\nworld. Since then, the Human Rights Council has \r\nmade progress in fulfilling its important mandate \r\nand is developing new tools to bring meaningful \r\nchange to the lives of millions of people. The Council \r\nplays a fundamental role in promoting human rights, \r\npreventing new violations and developing guarantees \r\nfor protection and non-recurrence. It has also been able \r\nto document serious violations of human rights in order \r\nto combat impunity.\r\nA very relevant feature of the Council is the \r\ngrowing number of States that are ever more open to \r\ndiscussing the human rights challenges they face at \r\nnational and regional levels. They are also more open \r\nto sharing their progress and successful experiences. In \r\nthat context, numerous developing countries stand out. \r\nWe hope that all States without exception will adopt a \r\nsimilar attitude. States must recognize that openness \r\nand dialogue with the Human Rights Council’s \r\nmechanisms and cooperation can generate substantial \r\nimprovement in the exercise of human rights in our \r\ncountries and regions. \r\nThe Council has also shown significant progress \r\nin addressing the rights of the elderly and persons of \r\nAfrican descent, universal recognition of the rights \r\nof migrants, including the right to work, promoting \r\nregistration of births and preventing discrimination \r\nagainst women, to mention just a few issues.\r\n12 12-58933\r\nA/67/PV.37\r\nWith the successful performance of the first \r\ncycle of the UPR mechanism and the launch of the \r\nsecond cycle, it was agreed that the Universal Periodic \r\nReview constitutes a breakthrough in United Nations \r\nintergovernmental human rights activities. The \r\nrationale behind creating such a mechanism was to \r\nensure universality, objectivity, non-selectivity and \r\nimpartiality in the work of the Human Rights Council. \r\nThe real advantage of the mechanism, in a logical \r\nsetting, is to allow the human rights machinery to \r\nact beyond the control of the monopoly of a few in \r\nmonitoring the human rights situations of all Member \r\nStates. \r\nHowever, the world is still witnessing attempts \r\nby a few countries that wish to impose their own \r\nviews and interpretations on the application of certain \r\ninternationally agreed concepts and standards. The \r\nHuman Rights Council should deal with such attempts \r\nby designing innovative approaches.\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran has taken a genuine \r\nand long-term approach to safeguarding human \r\nrights by ensuring its full compliance with the \r\nrelevant international commitments, while upholding \r\nthe promotion of the principles enshrined in its \r\nConstitution. Our policy has continuously emphasized \r\nthe significance of an interactive and cooperative \r\napproach to the promotion and protection of human \r\nrights, as stipulated in the purposes and principles \r\nof the United Nations Charter, as well as avoiding \r\nconfrontation, double standards and politicization. \r\nIran’s firm commitment to the promotion and protection \r\nof human rights includes, inter alia, undertaking \r\nmeasures that lead to the further convergence of the \r\nvalues and principles held by various countries with \r\ndifferent cultural, social and historical backgrounds \r\nwith regard to the issue of human rights.\r\nWe welcome constructive cooperation with the \r\nUnited Nations human rights machinery. In their \r\nmeeting with Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon during \r\nhis recent visit to Tehran, Iranian officials expressed \r\ntheir readiness to engage constructively with the \r\nSecretary-General and the United Nations High \r\nCommissioner for Human Rights. Iran has invited \r\nthe High Commissioner to visit the country. Officials \r\nfrom the Office of the High Commissioner for Human \r\nRights made a preparatory visit in December 2011 so as \r\nto facilitate the United Nations High Commissioner’s \r\nvisit. Iran is ready to cooperate with United Nations \r\nrecommendations made. The General Assembly and \r\nother bodies of the system must grant high priority to the \r\nrecommendations of the Human Rights Council, which \r\nis the top body the Organization has to promote one of \r\nthe pillars of the Organization and thus to encourage \r\nthe incorporation of human rights in all activities of \r\nthe United Nations. It is our ongoing responsibility to \r\nstrengthen its efficacy. \r\nMr. Al Habib (Islamic Republic of Iran): I would \r\nlike to thank the President of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil for her presentation, which provided us with \r\nan overview of the developments and activities of the \r\nCouncil as well as of the challenges it is facing.\r\nThe establishment of the Human Rights Council \r\nwas one of the most significant initiatives taken at the \r\nUnited Nations, not only because of its contribution to \r\nimproving the United Nations human rights structure, \r\nbut fundamentally because of its capacity and ability \r\nto change the politicized environment of confrontation \r\nthat had characterized the former Commission on \r\nHuman Rights, which ultimately gave place to the \r\nHuman Rights Council as a forum for dialogue and \r\ncooperation.\r\nThe Human Rights Council is strongly expected \r\nto be a forum for dialogue, mutual understanding and \r\ncooperation in achieving the universal realization of \r\nhuman rights, taking into account the cultural and \r\nnational particularities of different societies. To our \r\ngreat dismay, new concerted attempts are emerging to \r\nmake the Council a mere political tool for the sake of \r\npolitical ambitions of a few countries. It is deplorable \r\nthat despite the existence of the Universal Periodic \r\nReview (UPR) mechanism in the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, certain countries still continue to submit \r\ncountry-specific resolutions in the Council and in the \r\nThird Committee of the General Assembly. It goes \r\nwithout saying that such resolutions are politically \r\nmotivated exercises aimed at satisfying the political \r\npurposes and interests of their sponsors.\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran, along with the other \r\ndeveloping countries, actively participated in and \r\npositively contributed to the reform processes of the \r\nUnited Nations human rights machinery, including \r\nthose that led to the establishment of the Council, with a \r\nview to putting an end to a long-standing politicization \r\nand manipulation of the United Nations mechanism by \r\na few countries.\r\n12-58933 13\r\nA/67/PV.37\r\nof the High Commissioner by strengthening the funding \r\nof the Office, including through coordinated efforts \r\nin the Fifth Committee and other relevant United \r\nNations bodies, such as the Advisory Committee on \r\nAdministrative and Budgetary Questions, in order to \r\nsecure a substantial strengthening of OHCHR’s regular \r\nbudget over the coming years and to ensure the timely \r\nfunding of urgent mandates. It could also be achieved \r\nby supporting the High Commissioner and her Office in \r\ntheir efforts to strengthen efficiency and to prioritize, \r\nby ensuring the necessary space in that difficult \r\nexercise for the High Commissioner to manoeuvre in, \r\nand by continuing to provide voluntary contributions in \r\norder to secure a financial base for OHCHR activities \r\nwith the help of non -earmarked contributions as far as \r\npossible. The current financial constraints should be \r\nborne in mind when mandating new activities. \r\nWe also support the High Commissioner for Human \r\nRights and her Office in their efforts to strengthen \r\ncommunication regarding resource requirements and \r\nhow they could be met, including the possible impact \r\nof different budget scenarios on the work of the Office. \r\nWe support their continued efforts to develop dialogue \r\nwith States in order to ensure transparency and easy \r\naccess to information on sources and the allocation of \r\nfunding to the Office, while preserving the independent \r\nrole of the High Commissioner.\r\nWe believe that the High Commissioner and her \r\nOffice should take a realistic and sustainable approach \r\nto budgeting and should look carefully at the work of \r\nthe Office to strengthen efficiency and to ensure that \r\nOHCHR works in areas where it can add value and has \r\na comparative advantage. The Office should continue to \r\nroll out the new performance monitoring system across \r\nall OHCHR presences in the field and the Geneva \r\nheadquarters. That is important in order to measure \r\nimpact and to identify clear and concrete data on how \r\nOHCHR is performing in different areas. In addition, \r\nthey should expand the donor base and work to achieve \r\nas wide a geographical spread of donors as possible.\r\nMr. Guerber (Switzerland) (spoke in French): \r\nSwitzerland welcomes the strengthening of the work \r\nof the Human Rights Council under the presidency of \r\nMs. Lasserre. The presence of the Secretary-General at \r\nthe Human Rights Council on 11 September was also a \r\nnotable highlight.\r\nSwitzerland approves of the cross-regional \r\napproach, which is now becoming more common. That \r\nspecial mechanisms that are comprehensive and include \r\nall Member States and not a particular group of States.\r\nIn that regard, we look forward to continuing our \r\nclose cooperation with the Human Rights Council in \r\nrealizing our shared objective of attaining greater \r\nglobal justice, equity and development through the \r\nenhancement of human rights for all.\r\nMr. Çevik (Turkey): We would like to make \r\nthis cross-regional statement on behalf of a group of \r\ncountries. The statement is identical to that delivered \r\non behalf of 35 countries in Geneva during the most \r\nrecent session of the Human Rights Council. The \r\ncountries associated with the statement are Algeria, \r\nArgentina, Australia, Austria, Botswana, Chile, Côte \r\nd’Ivoire, France, Greece, Guatemala, Honduras, \r\nIndonesia, Italy, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Maldives, \r\nMexico, Monaco, Morocco, Nigeria, Norway, Pakistan, \r\nPeru, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Switzerland, \r\nThailand, Tunisia, Turkey and Uruguay.\r\nThe Office of the United Nations High \r\nCommissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) is \r\nexperiencing new financial challenges. The High \r\nCommissioner recently indicated that the Office would \r\nhave to cut its budget by 12 per cent in 2013, given its \r\ncurrent financial situation. The financial shortcoming \r\nis partly a result of the increasing requests and need \r\nfor the support of the Office, the increasing need for \r\nSecretariat support for the human rights treaty bodies \r\nand the unprecedented number of new and expanded \r\nmandates adopted by the Human Rights Council. \r\nThe financial challenge is complicated by OHCHR’s \r\nreliance on voluntary contributions.\r\nWe all have an increasing interest in ensuring that \r\nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for \r\nHuman Rights, a leading institution in the promotion \r\nand protection of human rights in the United Nations \r\nsystem, can fulfil its mandate faced with the increasing \r\ndemands on its services. The main aim should be to \r\nestablish a more sustainable system for funding the \r\nOHCHR over the coming years in a manner that balances \r\nthe various interests of States without infringing on \r\nthe independence of the High Commissioner and \r\nher Office, which operates under the administrative \r\ndirection and authority of the Secretary-General and \r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nWith that in mind, we believe that United Nations \r\nMembers should work to establish a more sustainable \r\nsystem for ensuring adequate resources for the Office \r\n14 12-58933\r\nA/67/PV.37\r\nimportant to focus the discussion on specific issues, \r\nwhile bearing in mind the financing of the system of \r\ntreaty bodies. Switzerland believes that long-term \r\nplanning, working methods and the lack of adequate \r\nresources should be central elements of any solution.\r\nFinally, with regard to the challenges in funding \r\nthe activities of the High Commissioner for Human \r\nRights, Switzerland endorses the statement made today \r\nby the representative of Turkey. Despite the present \r\neconomic and financial climate, Switzerland calls on \r\nMember States to increase the part of the regular budget \r\nearmarked for the Office of the High Commissioner and \r\nto maintain the level of their voluntary contributions. \r\nSwitzerland welcomes the statement by the High \r\nCommissioner on the subject at the press conference of \r\n18 October in Geneva on the occasion of the renewal of \r\nthe mandate.\r\nMr. Orjiako (Nigeria): My delegation welcomes \r\nthe President of the Human Rights Council, \r\nAmbassador Laura Dupuy Lasserre, and thanks \r\nher for her presentation of the report of the Council \r\n(A/67/53) to the Third Committee and the Assembly. \r\nNigeria attaches great importance to the respect for \r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms. We are \r\ncommitted to upholding human rights, not just within \r\nour borders but in our region and across the world. We \r\nare committed to supporting the Human Rights Council \r\nas the principal body within the United Nations human \r\nrights machinery. We want to see the Council achieve \r\nits mandate, as set out in resolution 60/251. We have \r\nremained actively engaged with the Human Rights \r\nCouncil in the past six years, during which we actively \r\nserved as a member.\r\nNigeria notes with satisfaction the commencement \r\nof the second cycle of the Universal Periodic Review, \r\nwith the fourteenth session of the Working Group \r\ntwo weeks ago. Judging by the active and enthusiastic \r\nparticipation of the States so far reviewed under the \r\nsecond cycle, we believe that the cycle is off to a good \r\nstart, and it is our hope that we shall see universal \r\nparticipation in it, just as we saw during the first cycle. \r\nNigeria continues to view the review mechanism as \r\na useful mechanism in the promotion and protection \r\nof human rights, and indeed we look forward to our \r\nsecond national review in 2013 during the seventeenth \r\nsession of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic \r\nReview.\r\nThe wide range of thematic issues addressed by \r\nthe special procedures of the Human Rights Council \r\napproach improves the effectiveness of the Human \r\nRights Council and the participative and inclusive \r\nnature of the discussions in Geneva. That aspect has \r\nbeen further strengthened by the establishment of \r\na fund to support the participation of less developed \r\nnations and of island States.\r\nIt is encouraging to note that new subjects have been \r\nintroduced in the Council, notably gender orientation \r\nand sexual identity. However, the tendency that has \r\nsometimes been noted to tone down the language \r\nrelated to non-discrimination and gender equality is \r\nsomewhat worrisome.\r\nIn the aftermath of the events in the Near East and \r\nNorth Africa and the citizen movements throughout the \r\nworld, Switzerland is pleased to have put the subject \r\nof the protection of human rights during peaceful \r\ndemonstrations on the Council’s agenda. Discussion of \r\nthe subject will resume at the Council’s next session \r\nin March 2013. Switzerland is also pleased about the \r\nappointment of and the first report by the Special \r\nRapporteur on the promotion of truth, justice, reparation \r\nand guarantees of non-recurrence (A/HRC/21/46) \r\nand that on human rights and the environment \r\n(A/HRC/19/34).\r\nSwitzerland is proud of the fact that it was examined \r\nfor the second time in the framework of the Universal \r\nPeriodic Review during the previous session of the \r\nWorking Group. The interactive dialogue between \r\nSwitzerland and the States was the culmination of \r\nnational consultations organized at various phases of \r\nthe national preparation for the review. More generally, \r\ncooperation among all States during the first cycle of the \r\nreview represented one of the greatest successes of that \r\nmechanism. Switzerland calls for the continuation of \r\nthat initiative, because it is important not to undermine \r\nthe universal character of the review. In our view, the \r\nimplementation of the second cycle of the review also \r\ntook place under good conditions. We now need to place \r\nan emphasis on the follow-up of recommendations and \r\nimplementation of the relevant measures.\r\nAs for the intergovernmental discussions on the \r\nstrengthening of treaty bodies, Switzerland considers \r\nthat the aim of the process is to make the present system \r\nmore efficient, to eliminate duplication of effort and to \r\nenable the treaty bodies to fulfil their mandates more \r\neffectively, while at the same time guaranteeing their \r\nindependence. As the co-facilitators stressed in their \r\nreport to the President of the General Assembly, it is \r\n12-58933 15\r\nA/67/PV.37\r\nmagnitude of the work that is facing the Council. Now \r\nthat the dust is beginning to settle, the citizens of the \r\naffected countries are starting to enjoy greater freedom \r\nin their lives. However, there is an awareness that there \r\nis more to be done. The nascent Governments, while \r\ntrying not to repeat the missteps of the previous fallen \r\nleaders, are currently faced with the delicate task of \r\njuggling the call for progress and the need to retain \r\nsupport. Malaysia believes that the Council can play \r\na prominent role in supporting those Governments, \r\nespecially by guiding them towards a human rights \r\nstandard that is acceptable to the international \r\ncommunity.\r\nAllow me to touch on a few matters relating to the \r\nCouncil. First, on the subject of the Universal Periodic \r\nReview, Malaysia is pleased to note the success of \r\nthe first cycle of the review process. The review is a \r\nprimary human rights mechanism, premised upon equal \r\ntreatment of all countries. Malaysia wishes to report \r\nthat it is in the process of preparing its report for the \r\nsecond review in June 2013. Consultations have been \r\nundertaken with Government agencies, and further \r\ndiscussions with civil society actors will also take place \r\nbefore the final report is prepared. \r\nTo ensure the full participation of all countries in \r\nthe review process, Malaysia is of the view that the \r\nVoluntary Fund for Financial and Technical Assistance, \r\nestablished by the Council in its resolution 6/17, should \r\nbe strengthened and put to work to provide a source of \r\nfinancial and technical assistance to help countries. That \r\nwould especially benefit the least developed countries \r\nand help them to implement the recommendations \r\nemanating from their reviews.\r\nSecondly, my delegation notes the international role \r\nplayed in supporting the process of State-building and \r\nnational reconciliation in various parts of the world. We \r\nwish to reiterate our view that such processes must be \r\ndriven at the domestic level. It is important that any \r\ninvolvement of external parties must have the consent \r\nof the concerned States and should be based on the \r\nprinciples of cooperation and constructive dialogue.\r\nThirdly, Malaysia welcomes the Council’s continued \r\nattention to the human rights situation inflicted \r\nby Israel on the Palestinian people in the occupied \r\nterritories. We must never forget that the core issue for \r\nthe Palestinians is their inalienable right to statehood. \r\nMalaysia strongly supports the legitimate right of the \r\nPalestinian people to an independent State of Palestine, \r\nindicates that the notion of human rights is taking on a \r\nbroader dimension and is now being mainstreamed into \r\ndeeper aspects of human development. We are pleased \r\nto note that the appointment of the mandate holders \r\nreflects equitable geographical representation and \r\nregional spread. We commend the mandate holders for \r\nthe efforts that they have been putting into their work, \r\nand we urge them to continue to discharge their tasks \r\nimpartially and in accordance with their mandate.\r\nPeople across the world look to the Human Rights \r\nCouncil to promote and protect their human rights, and \r\none way we can assure them that the Council is there \r\nto serve their interests is by maintaining the high level \r\nof access that non-governmental organizations (NGOs) \r\nhave enjoyed in the Council. Nigeria is pleased with the \r\nparticipation of NGOs in the activities of the Human \r\nRights Council and the freedom they have to express \r\ntheir views on issues under consideration at the sessions \r\nof the Council. We believe the Council’s engagement \r\nwith NGOs provides an avenue for the voice of ordinary \r\nmen and women to be heard and for the cause of victims \r\nto be pleaded before that world body.\r\nThe considerable number of resolutions adopted \r\nby the Human Rights Council during the current year \r\nis a reflection of the wide array of issues that the \r\nCouncil has had to deal with. However, it is a fact that \r\nresolutions come with programme budget implications, \r\nwhich create challenges of funding. Cognizant of the \r\nfact that human rights represent one of the key pillars \r\nof the United Nations architecture, Nigeria supports \r\nthe call for the General Assembly to significantly \r\nstrengthen funding for the work of the Council.\r\nFinally, we wish to reaffirm our commitment to \r\ncollaborate and cooperate with all States in order to \r\nadvance the work of the Human Rights Council. As we \r\nleave the Council at the end of this year, we would like \r\nto send a clear message that our exit from that unique \r\nbody shall not in any way diminish our interest in its \r\nactivities or reduce our commitment to its noble ideals.\r\nMr. Hassan (Malaysia): My delegation warmly \r\nwelcomes the presence of Ambassador Laura Dupuy \r\nLasserre, the President of the Human Rights Council \r\nin  the General Assembly and her presentation of the \r\nreport of the Council (A/67/53).\r\nMalaysia, together with the rest of the international \r\ncommunity, has high expectations on the work of the \r\nCouncil. Events around the world, particularly in the \r\nMiddle East and North Africa, have highlighted the \r\n16 12-58933\r\nA/67/PV.37\r\nbased on the two-State solution, taking into account the \r\nsecurity concerns of both parties. We urge the Council \r\nto continue to press the issue and to ensure that the \r\nPalestinians are afforded their basic rights as human \r\nbeings, including their right to an independent State.\r\nFourthly, regarding the process of strengthening \r\nand enhancing the effective functioning of the human \r\nrights treaty body system, Malaysia appreciates the High \r\nCommissioner’s initiative in conducting consultations \r\nwith Member States on the subject. Nevertheless, \r\nwe wish to emphasize that the process should be an \r\nintergovernmental one, in which involvement by the \r\nStates parties in the various treaties in every stage is \r\nof paramount importance. We therefore look forward to \r\nthe open-ended intergovernmental process that is taking \r\nplace within the framework of the General Assembly to \r\naddress the challenges pertaining to strengthening and \r\nenhancing the effective functioning of the human rights \r\ntreaty body system.\r\nWe hope that the Council will carry on its good \r\nwork in promoting and protecting human rights for \r\nall, and that it will not yield to the agendas promoted \r\nin certain quarters. The many achievements to date, \r\nwhich include the successful implementation of the \r\nUniversal Periodic Review mechanism, put the Council \r\nin good stead in its promotion and protection of human \r\nrights for all. However, Malaysia believes that more can \r\nalways be done to ensure the promotion and protection \r\nfor the victims of human rights violations. Malaysia \r\nis committed to that end and will continue to strongly \r\nsupport the work of the Council.\r\nMr. Mahmoud (Egypt): I would like at the outset \r\nto express our appreciation for the statement by \r\nAmbassador Laura Dupuy Lasserre, President of the \r\nHuman Rights Council, before the General Assembly, \r\nfollowing her valuable statement in the general debate \r\non the report of the Council (A/67/53) in the Third \r\nCommittee, in accordance with resolution 65/281.\r\nSince its establishment by resolution 60/251, the \r\nHuman Rights Council has continuously improved \r\nits performance by unifying work standards and has \r\ncontributed through its machinery to the promotion of \r\nuniversal respect for human rights. All Member States \r\nwithout exception have the duty to implement those \r\nmechanisms, which must be applied in a fair and equal \r\nmanner on the basis of objectivity, impartiality and \r\nneutrality, devoid of double standards, politicization \r\nand selectivity.\r\nThe international community is continuously \r\nexerting and consolidating efforts to ensure respect  for \r\nand protect all human rights, and seeking to restore the \r\nbalance in international interests between economic, \r\nsocial and cultural rights, on the one hand, and civil and \r\npolitical rights on the other. Moreover, it strengthens our \r\ncommon efforts to combat all forms of discrimination, \r\nincitement to hatred and violence on the basis of \r\nrace, sex, language or religion, including through the \r\nimplementation of our commitments, in accordance with \r\nthe Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, the \r\noutcome document of the Durban Review Conference \r\nand the political declaration that the General Assembly \r\nadopted by consensus during the tenth anniversary of \r\nthe Durban Declaration in September 2011 (resolution \r\n66/3). Despite those efforts, we are still facing \r\nchallenges owing to the insistence of some countries \r\non invoking the freedom of expression and opinion to \r\njustify provocative acts that incite hatred and violence \r\non the basis of religion or belief and that have dangerous \r\nimplications for international peace and security.\r\nWe have an obligation to strengthen and respect the \r\ninstitutional balance between the roles of the principal \r\norgans of the United Nations in addressing human rights \r\nissues, with a particular emphasis on economic, social \r\nand cultural dimensions. In doing so, we must reject \r\nthe attempts of some to impose their values, concepts \r\nand perceptions, as well as the standards of their justice \r\nand legal systems, all the while promulgating certain \r\ncontroversial notions that do not take into account the \r\ndiversity of the social, cultural, religious and legislative \r\nvalues of various nations.\r\nIt is therefore incumbent on us to reiterate our \r\ncommitment not to politicize the Council and to \r\nreaffirm its central role in ensuring respect for all \r\nhuman rights and international humanitarian law for \r\nall Member States and peoples, without exception or \r\ndiscrimination, in particular in occupied territories, \r\nand most importantly, in Palestine. We have to fulfil our \r\nresponsibility to ensure full compliance by Israel, the \r\noccupying Power, with all its international obligations, \r\nincluding its commitment to cooperate fully with the \r\nCouncil’s resolutions and with the Special Rapporteur \r\nand the fact-finding missions mandated by the Human \r\nRights Council to investigate gross violations of human \r\nrights in the occupied Palestinian territories. In that \r\nregard, Egypt deplores Israel’s decision to suspend its \r\nrelation with the Human Rights Council. We consider \r\nthat a dangerous precedent, which will, unless firmly \r\n12-58933 17\r\nA/67/PV.37\r\ndealt with, undermine the effective functioning of the \r\nCouncil and its mandate.\r\nStrengthening the role of the Council requires \r\nenhancing dialogue and promoting constructive \r\ncooperation to ensure the effectiveness of the special \r\nprocedures system. That is the shared responsibility of \r\nthe mandate holders, the States and all other relevant \r\nparties, which must be based on the principles of \r\ntransparency, impartiality and mutual cooperation, \r\nwhile ensuring full respect by the special procedures \r\nof the mandates and responsibilities established by the \r\nHuman Rights Council and that Member States fulfil \r\ntheir obligation to cooperate within the respective \r\nmandates.\r\nFinally, Egypt stresses the importance of \r\nstrengthening the principles of transparency and \r\naccountability in the work of the High Commissioner \r\nfor Human Rights, whether funded from the regular \r\nbudget or from other sources. We request that the \r\nnecessary financial resources to support the activities \r\nof the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner \r\nfor Human Rights in implementing its mandate and \r\nto enable it to support and advise Member States, to \r\nfollow up on the implementation of Council resolutions \r\nand to provide the necessary assistance to Member \r\nStates in the field of capacity-building be sourced from \r\nthe regular budget of the United Nations. Voluntary \r\nconditional funding should be avoided as far as possible. \r\nAssured funding will strengthen the role of the Office \r\nin supporting the work of the Council.\r\nMr. Cho Ki-joung (Republic of Korea) (spoke in \r\nFrench): At the outset, allow me to commend the Human \r\nRights Council, under the presidency of Ms. Laura \r\nDupuy Lasserre, for the quality of its work over the past \r\nyear. \r\nThe Human Rights Council has rapidly met the \r\nurgent need with regard to human rights, particularly \r\nin Syria. The Council took the necessary decisions not \r\nonly through its regular sessions but also by organizing \r\na special session. It sent a clear message to the \r\ninternational community that any violation of human \r\nrights must be stopped immediately and responsibility \r\nmust be apportioned. Such rapid response and \r\neffectiveness have further enhanced the primary role \r\nof the Human Rights Council as a guarantor of the \r\nprotection and promotion of human rights. \r\nOn behalf of the Government of the Republic of \r\nKorea, I would like to warmly thank Ms. Laura Dupuy \r\nLasserre for her tireless and lofty efforts as President \r\nof the Human Rights Council throughout her term of \r\noffice. Furthermore, the Republic of Korea calls on all \r\nGovernments and entities involved to respect all urgent \r\nrequests of the international community through the \r\nHuman Rights Council.\r\nThe Republic of Korea would also like to stress the \r\ncrucial role of the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) \r\nprocedure. As was the case with the first cycle of the \r\nReview, the second cycle has begun very successfully. \r\nBetter still, during the second cycle, which began this \r\nyear, we have seen a number of developments. \r\nFirst, the number of participating countries has \r\nincreased considerably compared to the previous cycle. \r\nSecondly, there have been improvements with regard not \r\nonly to the number of recommendations submitted, but \r\nalso to their quality. Thirdly, the majority of delegations \r\nof those countries that have been evaluated have been \r\nheaded by a leading official of the Ministry of Justice. \r\nThat has allowed the messages of the international \r\ncommunity to be transmitted directly to the minister \r\nresponsible for implementing recommendations. \r\nHowever, to ensure the full success of the UPR \r\nprocess, it is up to each State assessed to implement \r\nthe recommendations made. While reaffirming its \r\ncommitment to the UPR process, the Republic of Korea \r\ncalls on the Governments concerned to implement all \r\nrecommendations in order to ensure that there is a \r\ntangible improvement in human rights on the ground.\r\nFinally, I would like to take this opportunity to \r\nthank all Member States that have provided their \r\nvaluable support to our country’s candidature for \r\nelection to the Human Rights Council. Through its \r\npromises and voluntary commitments, our Government \r\nhas clearly demonstrated its resolute will to play a \r\nconstructive role in promoting human rights nationally \r\nand internationally. All promises and commitments will \r\nbe respected during its term of office. The Republic of \r\nKorea will spare no effort in undertaking the work of \r\nthe Human Rights Council, while maintaining close \r\nrelations with other members and observers of the \r\nCouncil and with civil society. \r\nMs. Hernando (Philippines): At the outset, allow \r\nme to thank the President for this opportunity to speak \r\non the report of the Human Rights Council (A/67/53). \r\nThis agenda item is of particular importance to the \r\nPhilippines as a founding and current member of the \r\nHuman Rights Council. My delegation also thanks \r\n18 12-58933\r\nA/67/PV.37\r\nIt has spurred greater interest and attention to human \r\nrights at the national and international levels and has \r\nshown us that all countries, regardless of their level \r\nof development, share human rights challenges. We \r\nare optimistic that the UPR will continue to help the \r\nCouncil ensure respect for the principles of universality, \r\nobjectivity and fairness and to institutionalize \r\ncooperative and constructive dialogue on human rights \r\nin a less politicized and non-selective manner.\r\nIn May, the Philippines presented its report for \r\nthe second cycle of the UPR, which was adopted by \r\nthe Council in September. My delegation values the \r\nUPR as a continuing process, not merely a venue for \r\nscheduled reporting and review. We are convinced that \r\nthe UPR can bring about concrete positive changes \r\nin the treatment of human rights on the ground as it \r\naddresses human rights issues in a manner that takes \r\ninto consideration the views of many sectors of society.\r\nThe Philippines believes that the primary goal of \r\nthe Council is to help and to encourage all countries \r\nto build an enabling environment, both on the ground \r\nand internationally, and to better promote the human \r\nrights of their peoples in constructive cooperation \r\nwith the international community and civil society. \r\nWe are of the view that a consensual and cooperative \r\napproach in dealing with country situations can lead \r\nto a more practical and results-oriented outcome. The \r\nCouncil should therefore be a partner of all States and \r\nstakeholders in the promotion and protection of all \r\nhuman rights, with a strong focus on capacity-building \r\nand international cooperation. It must continue to \r\nwork in a constructive manner, fostering dialogue and \r\ncooperation and engaging in meaningful interaction \r\nwith States and all stakeholders at the national and \r\ninternational level.\r\nMr. Balé (Congo), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe special procedures play an important role \r\nin protecting and promoting human rights. The \r\nindependence of mandate holders is vital to their work \r\nbut, as we have repeatedly stressed in the past, it must \r\nalways be balanced with important considerations, \r\nsuch as professionalism, integrity, efficiency and \r\neffectiveness.\r\nAs a founding and current member of the Council, \r\nthe Philippines endeavours to contribute to the efficient \r\nand effective work of the Council by working with \r\nall States and stakeholders in a constructive manner, \r\nfostering dialogue and cooperation and focusing on \r\nLaura Dupuy Lasserre, President of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, for presenting the Council’s report to the \r\nAssembly.\r\nLast year marked the twenty-fifth anniversary of \r\nthe Declaration on the Right to Development, which \r\nunequivocally establishes development as a right and \r\nputs people at the centre of the development process. \r\nYet many children, women and men continue to live \r\nin dire need of fulfilment of their entitlement to a \r\nlife of dignity, freedom and equal opportunity. It is \r\nunfortunate that more than 60 years after the adoption \r\nof the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which \r\narticulates our highest aspirations for freedom from \r\nfear and want and our commitment to protecting the \r\nsanctity and dignity of every human life, regardless of \r\nsex, race or creed. Poverty, disease, lack of shelter and \r\nilliteracy remain, affecting the realization of a wide \r\nrange of civil, political, economic, social and cultural \r\nrights.\r\nAs a member of the Human Rights Council, the \r\nPhilippines is committed to continuing to support \r\nadvancing discussions on the right to development \r\nwith a view to its realization. We believe that the \r\nestablishment of the Human Rights Council, aimed \r\nat strengthening the United Nations human rights \r\nmachinery to ensure effective enjoyment by all of \r\nevery human right — political, civil, economic, social \r\nor cultural, including the right to development — is but \r\none of the manifestations of our continuing faith in and \r\nenduring commitment to the values and principles of \r\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\r\nThe reform process that led to the creation of the \r\nHuman Rights Council stemmed from the need to \r\nelevate human rights to the same level as the pillars of \r\npeace, security and equitable economic development, on \r\nwhich the United Nations was founded. Development, \r\npeace and security and human rights are interlinked and \r\nmutually reinforcing. It is only through the observance \r\nof and respect for human rights and fundamental \r\nfreedoms that we can truly attain peace and social \r\nprogress.\r\nSince its establishment in 2006, we note that the \r\nHuman Rights Council has made reasonable progress \r\nin fulfilling its mandate, as set out in resolution 60/251. \r\nThe Universal Periodic Review (UPR), with its \r\nintergovernmental and peer-review nature, remains \r\nan effective mechanism of the Council in ensuring \r\nthat States fulfil their responsibility to respect and \r\nimplement human rights and fundamental freedoms. \r\n12-58933 19\r\nA/67/PV.37\r\nfundamental rights and freedoms of the Syrian people. \r\nThe extension of the mandate of the independent \r\ninternational commission of inquiry on the Syrian Arab \r\nRepublic is also a commendable decision of the Council. \r\nWe hope that the concerned parties will cooperate with \r\nthe commission and allow it to successfully carry out \r\nits mandate.\r\nWe have taken note of the challenges and constraints \r\nof the Office of the High Commissioner, particularly in \r\nthe past year. In that regard, Botswana has continued \r\nto engage actively in the work of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil in Geneva. We have positively engaged with \r\nvarious special procedures mandate holders in support \r\nof their work despite the challenges that they face in \r\ncarrying out their mandates.\r\nWe also share the High Commissioner’s concerns \r\nabout resource constraints and the increasing workload \r\nof the Human Rights Council. Our abiding faith in \r\nand commitment to supporting the Office of the High \r\nCommissioner is demonstrated by our response to calls \r\nfor human rights appeals, both political and financial, \r\nand to the work of the special procedures and mandates \r\nthat emanate from the Human Rights Council.\r\nMy delegation is also pleased by the work carried \r\nout under the special procedures of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil. We take particular note of the report of the \r\nSpecial Rapporteur on the use of children in armed \r\nconflicts and reiterate our support to guard against \r\nimpunity and the violation of children’s rights in all \r\nsituations, including armed conflict.\r\nWe also recognize the valuable role and the \r\ncontribution of the human rights treaty bodies to \r\nthe promotion and protection of human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms. Their effective functioning \r\nremains critical. We are confident that the ongoing \r\nintergovernmental process on the strengthening of \r\nthe human rights treaty body system will enhance \r\nefficiency in the financing and working methods of \r\nsuch bodies and will complement efforts to promote the \r\ndevelopment agenda of the Human Rights Council.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation wishes to reiterate \r\nBotswana’s support for the work of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil and its mechanisms. We hope to achieve our \r\naspirations in that regard.\r\nMr. Lukiyantsev (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): At the outset, allow me to thank Ms. Laura \r\nDupuy Lasserre, President of the Human Rights \r\nthe importance of bridging national, regional and \r\ninternational human rights goals, standards and \r\nstrategies. The Philippines is the main sponsor of \r\ninitiatives in the Council on human rights and extreme \r\npoverty and on combating trafficking in persons, \r\nespecially women and children. It traditionally \r\nsponsors initiatives on the protection of the human \r\nrights of vulnerable groups, such as migrants, women, \r\nindigenous peoples and persons with disabilities, and \r\nis a member of the cross-regional Platform for Human \r\nRights Education and Training. \r\nSensitive to the current and emerging human rights \r\nchallenges and aware that the effective realization of \r\nhuman rights is vital to alleviating poverty and creating \r\na better quality of life for all, my delegation reaffirms \r\nits unwavering commitment to the protection and \r\npromotion of human rights.\r\nMr. Ntwaagae (Botswana): Botswana warmly \r\nwelcomes the President of the Human Rights Council \r\nto the sixty-seventh session of the General Assembly \r\nand thanks her for the comprehensive report that she \r\npresented to the Assembly (A/67/53).\r\nMy delegation associates itself with the statement \r\nmade earlier in the meeting by the representative \r\nof Turkey on behalf of the cross-regional group on \r\nthe financial challenges of the Office of the High \r\nCommissioner for Human Rights.\r\nAs a member of the Human Rights Council, \r\nBotswana is fully committed to the promotion and \r\nprotection of human rights, both at home and abroad. \r\nWe attach great importance to the work of the Council \r\nas we believe that it continues to make a positive \r\nimpact on Member States in fulfilling their human \r\nrights obligations. However, we believe that much more \r\nremains to be done.\r\nBotswana commends the Council for the work \r\nthat it has achieved at the recently concluded session. \r\nThe decisions taken on various thematic and country \r\nmandates will go a long way in assisting the countries \r\nconcerned to address the challenges that they face in \r\nthe protection and promotion of human rights.\r\nHowever, we are concerned about the situation of \r\nhuman rights violations in a number of countries that \r\nare on the Council’s agenda, in particular the situation \r\nin Syria. We further call on the Security Council to \r\ntake the necessary measures to compel the Government \r\nof Syria to end the impunity and violation of the \r\n20 12-58933\r\nA/67/PV.37\r\nrights situations in Member States. Russia supported \r\nthe creation of that procedure in the hope that holding \r\nsuch a review on the basis of equality and mutual \r\nrespect would help to reduce confrontation in inter-State \r\ndiscussions of human rights. We are convinced that in \r\nthe future the Universal Periodic Review must to a great \r\nextent replace the discredited practice of lopsided and \r\npoliticized resolutions on the human rights situations \r\nin individual countries. The review procedure has \r\nconsiderable potential, but that can be realized only \r\nif there is genuine universality, without exception or \r\nexemption from the general rules. \r\nOne of the most important instruments that \r\nthe Council can use to implement its mandate is the \r\nsystem of special procedures, which is a legacy of \r\nthe Human Rights Commission. Unfortunately, along \r\nwith some benefits of the special procedures system, \r\nit has shortcomings, which have been justly criticized. \r\nIt is important that the future functioning of human \r\nrights mechanisms move towards depoliticization. \r\nThat can be guaranteed by unswerving respect in the \r\nspecial procedures, a principle adopted by Member \r\nStates at the sixty-second session in resolution 62/219, \r\nsetting out the Code of Conduct for Special Procedures \r\nMandate-holders of the Human Rights Council.\r\nOn the subject of cooperation between the Human \r\nRights Council and the High Commissioner for Human \r\nRights, we believe it to be of fundamental importance \r\nto strictly follow the provisions of resolutions 48/141 \r\nand 60/251, which clearly define the place and role of \r\nthe High Commissioner and the Office of the High \r\nCommissioner in the United Nations human rights \r\nstructure. We believe that the work of the Office of \r\nthe High Commissioner should focus on enhancing \r\ndialogue and cooperation with States in order to provide \r\nthem with assistance in guaranteeing human rights and \r\nfreedoms. \r\nIn that regard, we suggest that such important \r\nmechanisms as the biennial Strategic Management \r\nPlan of the Office of the High Commissioner should \r\nbe reviewed by the Human Rights Council before \r\nbeing presented to the General Assembly. However, we \r\nshould have a genuine dialogue among Member States \r\nrather than a mere mechanism for collecting views, \r\nas was done this year. That would allow the High \r\nCommissioner to get a clearer picture of the current \r\nneeds of various States in promoting and protecting \r\nhuman rights, and the Office could thereby design its \r\nwork in a more targeted way.\r\nCouncil, for presenting the report on the work of the \r\nCouncil (A/67/53).\r\nToday, it can be confidently said that in the period \r\nsince the Council’s establishment, that body has become \r\none of the key elements of the international human \r\nrights architecture called on to help the development \r\nof constructive inter-State cooperation in that area. \r\nThe Council has specific qualities that distinguish \r\nit positively from its predecessor, the Human Rights \r\nCommission.\r\nHowever, a worrying trend increasingly seen in \r\nthe work of the Human Rights Council, in particular \r\nin recent years, is emerging. Unfortunately, its work \r\ncontinues to be characterized by the polarization of \r\nvarious groups of States, making it difficult to hold a \r\nmeaningful and constructive discussion of human rights \r\nissues. There is concern about the continuing practice \r\nof many States and groups of countries to use human \r\nrights as an instrument of political pressure, imposing \r\nforeign value systems without taking the national \r\nhistorical, economic, and sociopolitical characteristics \r\nof States into account.\r\nWe continue to see attempts to divide States into \r\ntwo categories — the bad and the good, the students and \r\nthe examiners — undermining the intergovernmental \r\nnature of the Council. Such an approach fundamentally \r\ncontradicts the initial purpose of the Council as a \r\nbody created to develop dialogue and cooperation. The \r\nCouncil must work in the interests of all Member States \r\nwithout exception and not give preference to any one \r\nnation’s individual needs. \r\nIn that regard, we would like to once again draw \r\nattention to the basic principles of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil: universality, impartiality, objectivity and \r\nnon-selectivity. We are firmly convinced that unless \r\nthose principles are respected, we cannot foster genuine, \r\nconstructive, mutually respectful international \r\ndialogue and cooperation to promote human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms, and the Council’s work as a \r\nwhole will be doomed to fail. We must recognize the \r\nfact that the primary responsibility for promoting and \r\nprotecting human rights lies with States themselves \r\nand that the basic task of the international community \r\nresides in providing them with technical, results-\r\noriented assistance. \r\nOne of the most important functions of the Council, \r\npursuant to the provisions of resolution 60/251, is to \r\nconduct the Universal Periodic Review of the human \r\n12-58933 21\r\nA/67/PV.37\r\ncontinues to ponder seriously why it is that they are \r\nexempt from prosecution and accountability.\r\nWe can only express our concern about the efforts \r\nof some parties to turn the Human Rights Council into \r\na private and prefabricated sector that works within \r\nnarrow political parameters that serve the agendas of \r\nsome influential States and contradict the spirit and \r\nmandate of the Human Rights Council itself. We say \r\nthis because some, unfortunately, have succeeded in \r\nturning back the clock to the time of the Human Rights \r\nCommission and are once again politicizing the work of \r\nthe Human Rights Council.\r\nThis was made abundantly clear when resolutions \r\nwere adopted in which the Council condemned the \r\nviolations of human rights in some developing countries \r\nbut continued to ignore and dismiss mechanisms to \r\naddress human rights situations and their violations \r\nin so-called developed States. In those States, racism \r\nis rampant, as are xenophobia, racial discrimination, \r\ndiscrimination against indigenous people and \r\nimmigrants, and inhumane and abusive treatment of \r\ndetainees and refugees. These countries have militarily \r\ninvaded sovereign States Members of the United \r\nNations and, more important, violated their right to \r\ndevelopment by adopting unilateral, coercive economic \r\nmeasures against the peoples of developing countries. \r\nThe list goes on. \r\nUnfortunately, some Western States have adopted \r\na double standard in their understanding of terrorism. \r\nThere is the terrorism that others perpetrate, which must \r\nbe fought by all means and methods. Some States have \r\neven gone to extremes in combating such terrorism and \r\nstressing the need to uproot and condemn it. That is, in \r\ntheir view, the first kind of terrorism; the second is the \r\nkind that those Western States themselves perpetrate. \r\nThat is acceptable terrorism, which can be committed \r\nwithout drawing any criticism. On the contrary, it can \r\nbe defended. This is a dangerous precedent and a stain \r\non the record of the Human Rights Council and on the \r\nlogic of international relations. \r\nI would like to provide a real example from Egypt in \r\n1906. In a small village called Denishwei, soldiers and \r\nofficers from the British occupation at the time wanted \r\nto go on a hunting trip. They violated the sanctity of \r\nwomen in that village, whose people rose in protest \r\nagainst those unwanted visitors. Many people were \r\nkilled, including one British officer. The result was \r\nthat the British occupation organized an impromptu \r\nIn order to ensure that human rights become a real \r\nelement of everyone’s lives, it is important not only to \r\nrecognize their juridical definition but to make a fresh \r\nconsideration of the moral dimension. That dimension is \r\nfirst and foremost reflected in traditional human values \r\nthat have developed in our societies over millennia and \r\nare reflected in religions, cultures and customs. I refer \r\nto such traditional values as dignity, responsibility, \r\nfreedom, work, the family and mutual respect. Such \r\nmoral principles must form the foundation of social \r\nlife and become the cement that binds nations, peoples \r\nand ethnic groups. We firmly believe that if traditional \r\nvalues are respected in the relationship between human \r\nrights and traditional human values, they will bolster \r\nrespect for human rights and their universal enjoyment. \r\nWe believe that an excellent starting point on this theme \r\nwas the discussion initiated by Russia in the Human \r\nRights Council.\r\nMr. Ja’afari (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in \r\nArabic): We welcome the President of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, Ambassador Laura Lasserre, and reaffirm our \r\ndetermination to continue our constructive cooperation \r\nwith her, working to guarantee that all human rights \r\nare addressed in a fair, impartial, equitable and \r\nnon-selective way, free of the pitfalls and ploys of \r\npoliticization and double standards that undermine \r\nmany of our accomplishments here in New York and \r\nin Geneva. \r\nMy country, as is well known, participated actively \r\nin creating the Human Rights Council in Geneva and \r\nin the consensual activities that led to its formation. \r\nTherefore, everything pertaining to human rights lies \r\nat the heart of Syrian foreign policy.\r\nWe have read with deep interest the Council’s report \r\n(A/67/53), which covers extremely important topics, \r\nespecially information about violations of human rights \r\nin the occupied Arab territories, the Syrian Golan \r\nand the Palestinian territories. The Syrian Golan has \r\nbeen under an unjust Israeli occupation for 45 years, \r\nand despite the Human Rights Council’s demands that \r\nIsrael, the occupying Power — to use United Nations \r\nlanguage — implement the resolutions of all the bodies \r\nand agencies of the United Nations, including of course \r\nthe Human Rights Council, Israel continues to f lout \r\nsaid resolutions. The Israelis continue to commit war \r\ncrimes and crimes against humanity and to openly \r\nboast of their crimes, unhindered by any punishment \r\nor accountability, while international public opinion \r\n22 12-58933\r\nA/67/PV.37\r\nRecently, The Telegraph, a British newspaper, \r\npublished an important article on a British doctor \r\nnamed Shajul Islam. He had decided to go and wage \r\njihad in Syria, so he left his career as a physician in \r\nBritain and went to Syria to wage jihad. The British \r\nnewspaper described this man as a doctor by day and \r\na terrorist by night in Syria. Yet there are those who \r\nstill insist that there is no terrorism in Syria, no armed \r\ngroups in Syria and no ships arriving from Libya laden \r\nwith weapons and endowed with Qatari funding and \r\noperational facilities from Turkey, to be used to kill the \r\nSyrian people.\r\nMy country is experiencing a humanitarian crisis, \r\nthe reasons for which are well known. Terrorism \r\nhas struck my country because of the systematic \r\nviolations perpetrated by members of terrorist armed \r\ngroups that are funded and backed from outside. The \r\nforeign backing of these armed groups and their vital \r\nrole in what is happening in Syria have been clearly \r\nproved, and evidence thereof is now in the hands of the \r\nSecurity Council, the Secretary-General and the High \r\nCommissioner for Human Rights.\r\nMy country’s Government has offered every form \r\nof cooperation with a view to arriving at a solution \r\nto the humanitarian crisis and the deteriorating \r\neconomic conditions. Damascus has received and \r\ncontinues to receive delegations from the Office for \r\nthe Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), \r\nthe International Committee of the Red Cross and \r\nmany other international delegations, whether political, \r\nspiritual or media-related. \r\nMy country has also accepted the revised response \r\nplan and granted permission to many non-governmental \r\norganizations to participate in the plan in order to \r\nrespond to humanitarian needs. We also guarantee \r\nentry visas to humanitarian aid workers and have \r\nissued licenses and eased all bureaucratic measures \r\nto allow OCHA to conduct field visits to many areas \r\ninside Syria without delay. As Council members and \r\nthe President of the Human Rights Council know, we \r\nhave participated constructively in the six meetings of \r\nthe Syrian Humanitarian Forum, held in Geneva.\r\nDespite all that, some nations that are known to \r\nsupport terrorism in my country continue to try to \r\ndemonize the Syrian Government and to portray it as \r\na killer of its own people, while completely ignoring \r\nthe presence of armed terrorist groups in Syria and the \r\nfield court in the village of Denishwei and sentenced \r\ndozens of its residents to death. That is why it is known \r\nas the massacre of Denishwei. A well-known Egyptian \r\npoet named Hafez Ibrahim was a contemporary of that \r\nmassacre. He described the massacre in a line of poetry \r\nthat says that killing an individual, even in a jungle, is \r\nan unforgivable crime, but killing peaceful people is a \r\ncontroversial issue.\r\nThe four resolutions pertaining to Syria and \r\nmentioned in the report of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil (A/HRC/RES/19/1, A/HRC/RES/19/22, \r\nA/HRC/RES/20/22 and A/HRC/S-19/2) were based on \r\nunilateral media reports. The texts of those resolutions \r\nwere drafted using misleading and hostile terms and \r\nlanguage that were without precedent in their hatefulness \r\ntowards the Syrian people and Government. They \r\ncondemn only one side — the Syrian Government. Not \r\nin a single paragraph do they demand an end to violence \r\nor to the disarming of the armed terrorist groups, or \r\nthat a national dialogue be launched to resolve the crisis \r\npeacefully on the basis of the six-point plan, the Geneva \r\ndeclaration and the Brahimi commission. \r\nThese resolutions go even further. Their sponsors, \r\nwho claim to defend the human rights of the Syrian \r\npeople, have neglected to mention the deteriorating \r\neconomic and humanitarian situation in Syria, which is a \r\nresult of the coercive unilateral economic measures that \r\nhave been imposed on the Syrian people by the States \r\nmembers of the European Union, the United States and, \r\nunfortunately, some Arab States. This occurred despite \r\nthe fact that the report of the independent international \r\ncommission of inquiry (A/HRC/21/50), which was \r\nestablished by the Human Rights Council itself, noted \r\nthe impact of the economic measures on the livelihoods \r\nof the Syrian people. Needless to say, these coercive \r\nmeasures threaten the sovereignty and independence of \r\nStates and f lagrantly violate the Charter of the United \r\nand the principles of human rights. \r\nI can only say that it is regrettable and shameful \r\nfor the League of Arab States and the Organization of \r\nIslamic Cooperation to have been the first to impose \r\nthese inhumane sanctions on the Syrian people, in direct \r\nviolation of their human rights. It is also shameful for \r\nmany of the rich countries who are members of those two \r\norganizations not to offer a single dollar in assistance \r\nto the Syrian people, while they channel millions of \r\ndollars to terrorist mercenaries and Al-Qaida elements \r\nto enable them to shed the blood of innocent Syrians \r\nand destroy the Syrian State.\r\n12-58933 23\r\nA/67/PV.37\r\nHuman Rights Council, for the introduction of the \r\nCouncil’s report (A/67/53). As we can see from the \r\nreport, in recent times continuous efforts have been \r\nmade by the Council to respond to numerous human \r\nrights situations around the world.\r\nIt has been highlighted on many occasions that \r\nhuman rights are increasingly interrelated with the \r\nefforts of the international community for peace, \r\nsecurity and economic and social development, for \r\nthe promotion of democracy and other advances. My \r\ndelegation fully shares that view. In that respect, I wish \r\nto underline the importance of actions taken by the \r\nCouncil, the special procedures and the human rights \r\ntreaty bodies, and reaffirm our full support for the \r\nefforts of the Council to fulfil its mandate.\r\nToday, we are witnessing an unprecedented \r\ninternational quest for the effective implementation of \r\nhuman rights. As we all know, our leaders reaffirmed \r\ntheir strong commitment to the protection and \r\npromotion of human rights at the High-level Meeting \r\non the Rule of Law at the National and International \r\nLevels, held last September (see A/67/PV.3). There is \r\nan impressive record of accession to and ratification of \r\ninternational human rights instruments, as well as the \r\nestablishment of national human rights machinery by \r\nmany countries. Nevertheless, numerous human rights \r\nchallenges persist, including poverty, discrimination, \r\nreligious intolerance, armed conflicts, refugee f lows, \r\narbitrary executions and the impact of the pervasive \r\neconomic and financial crisis. One of the latest examples \r\nis the ongoing conflict in Syria, with its devastating \r\nconsequences on civilians.\r\nThose challenges call on Member States to \r\nimplement sound policies at the national level and to \r\npromote enhanced cooperation at the international \r\nlevel. Moreover, the States concerned need more \r\nsubstantive support from the international community \r\nto address such issues through enhanced technical \r\nassistance and advisory services aimed at capacity-\r\nbuilding and human rights education. It is gratifying \r\nto note in that regard that the Council has made great \r\nstrides to support States in implementing their human \r\nrights obligations, to advocate the promotion and \r\nprotection of human rights and to advance the process \r\nof strengthening the treaty bodies.\r\nOver the past 20 years, Mongolia has been actively \r\nengaged in carrying out an extensive legal reform aimed \r\nat bringing national laws in line with international \r\nstandards. Thus, Mongolia is undertaking step-by-step \r\nSyrian Government’s duty to combat those groups and \r\nthose that back them.\r\nHere, I would like to stress that the solution to the \r\nhumanitarian crisis in Syria is not through the political \r\nanimosity of some States members of the Council \r\ntowards Syria in order to settle old and new scores with \r\nus. Nor will it be achieved by fanning the f lames of \r\ndiscord or by funding or harbouring armed terrorists \r\nand encouraging them to perpetrate massacres and \r\nterrorist bombings against Syrian civilians. \r\nInstead, a solution can be achieved by abiding by \r\nthe principle of providing humanitarian assistance, in \r\nparticular under resolution 46/182, which determines the \r\nmechanisms and conditions for providing humanitarian \r\nassistance to States Members of the United Nations. A \r\nsolution could be ensured if donor States and bodies \r\nwere to demonstrate the political will to provide what \r\nhas been pledged and to end the policy of imposing \r\nunilateral economic measures.\r\nThe politicized resolutions of the Security Council \r\nhamper and will continue to impede efforts to establish \r\na Human Rights Council that addresses all human \r\nrights violations in the world on the basis of clear \r\nstandards that apply to all without discrimination. Such \r\nresolutions obstruct the impartial role of international \r\nparties in putting an end to the crisis in Syria. Instead, \r\nthey actually encourage more inflexibility, the rejection \r\nof national dialogue and continued armed violence, \r\nkilling and bloodshed. They will hamper any of the \r\nsteps recently taken by Syria to foster cooperation and \r\nopenness towards international missions.\r\nIn conclusion, we hope to see Ambassador Lasserre \r\nuse and intervene with her significant moral weight, \r\nwhich we acknowledge and respect, to demand that the \r\nStates involved in harbouring, arming, supporting and \r\nfinancing the armed groups stop what they are doing \r\nto all Syrian people and the entire Syrian State and \r\nsociety. Those States are responsible for terrorizing \r\nSyrian citizens and inciting them to f lee their homes, \r\nthereby turning them into refugees, and for using armed \r\nterrorist groups as a tool to destabilize Syria, to strike \r\nat the unity and cohesion of its people, and to create a \r\nprefabricated humanitarian problem that seeks to stain \r\nSyria’s image and to harm its international record as a \r\npeople and a State.\r\nMr. Och (Mongolia): First of all, allow me to \r\njoin previous speakers in expressing our gratitude to \r\nAmbassador Laura Dupuy Lasserre, President of the \r\n24 12-58933\r\nA/67/PV.37\r\nto the Human Rights Council for the elections to \r\nbe held in 2015. It is my earnest hope that, with the \r\nsupport of fellow member States, we will succeed in \r\nour endeavours.\r\nMr. Rahman (Bangladesh): My delegation would \r\nlike to thank Ambassador Laura Dupuy Lasserre, \r\nPresident of the Human Rights Council, for having \r\npresented the Council’s annual report (A/67/53). We \r\nappreciate her able stewardship in taking forward the \r\nwork of the Council over the past year. We welcome the \r\nopportunity to interact with her and share our views on \r\nthe activities of the Council.\r\nMy delegation has had and still has high \r\nexpectations of the Human Rights Council, the principal \r\nbody of the United Nations dedicated to the promotion \r\nand protection of human rights. The Council, with its \r\ninstitutional machinery such as the Universal Periodic \r\nReview (UPR) mechanism, the special procedures, the \r\nHuman Rights Council Advisory Committee and the \r\ncomplaint procedure, is truly in a position to contribute \r\nto significant improvements in the enjoyment of human \r\nrights.\r\nBy establishing the Council, our predecessors \r\nintended to usher in a new era in the human rights \r\ndiscourse and to introduce a new culture when it comes \r\nto dealing with human rights. We are disturbed by the \r\nnews of increasing polarization in the Council. That \r\nis not a good sign. If we do not move away from that \r\npath and seek mutual respect and understanding, the \r\nbody may soon be as discredited as its predecessor, the \r\nCommission for Human Rights. \r\nIt is important to nurture the Council as a forum \r\nthat fosters dialogue and cooperation instead of \r\ndivisiveness and confrontation. We should focus efforts \r\non making human rights mechanisms more transparent, \r\naccountable and balanced so that real change can be \r\nbrought to the realm of human rights protections. As \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon has said, all victims \r\nof human rights abuses should be able to look to the \r\nHuman Rights Council as a forum and a springboard \r\nfor action.\r\nThe creation of the Universal Periodic Review \r\nmechanism was one of the most significant innovations \r\nin the area of human rights. Its greatest strength lies \r\nin its universality, with all countries facing scrutiny \r\nregardless of their region, size or influence. This peer \r\nreview mechanism aims to create an environment of \r\nmutual trust, confidence and understanding. If we can \r\nmeasures to amend the existing legislation with the aim \r\nof abolishing the death penalty in law and practice.\r\nAmong others, Mongolia attaches great importance \r\nto the implementation of its reporting obligation under \r\nthe human rights treaties. Thus, the first national human \r\nrights report of Mongolia was reviewed in 2010 under \r\nthe Universal Periodic Review, a unique mechanism for \r\npromoting human rights worldwide.\r\nWe have shown consistent support for the special \r\nprocedures of the Human Rights Council. In October, \r\nan independent group of experts appointed by the \r\nHuman Rights Council visited Mongolia to examine the \r\nhuman rights impacts of business activity in Mongolia. \r\nI am pleased to note that it was the first country mission \r\nof the Working Group on Business and Human Rights \r\nsince its establishment in June 2011. My Government \r\nattaches particular importance to the issue of examining \r\nand addressing the impacts that businesses have on the \r\nhuman rights of its people. Consequently, the emphasis \r\non human rights has been made in the action plan of the \r\nnew Government for 2012-2016.\r\nIt is gratifying to note that the Working Group \r\nfocused on identifying negative impacts, but also positive \r\nimpacts that business activities could have on the full \r\nspectrum of human rights, from creating employment \r\nto driving economic growth. As Ms. Margaret Jungk, \r\na member of the Working Group, highlighted in her \r\nstatement summarizing the work of the mission, the \r\nkey challenge for any country, especially one that is \r\nundergoing rapid economic development like Mongolia, \r\nis to maximize these positive effects and, at the same \r\ntime, minimize the negative effects.\r\nOnce again I wish to express our gratitude to \r\nthe Working Group for its important findings and \r\nrecommendations. I am confident that due attention \r\nshall be given to those recommendations and to the \r\nrespective actions taken by the Government and \r\nbusinesses in Mongolia. We also look forward to \r\nreceiving soon the final report of the Working Group, \r\nwhich is expected to be submitted to the Council in \r\nJune 2013.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate my \r\nGovernment’s commitment to continued cooperation \r\nwith the Council, as expressed by our Foreign Minister \r\nduring his meeting with the President of the Council \r\nin October in Geneva. As the Assembly is well aware, \r\nMongolia, in its desire to make an active contribution \r\nto the work of the Council, presented its candidature \r\n12-58933 25\r\nA/67/PV.37\r\non the impact of the financial crisis on human rights \r\ncouple of years ago. There should be many more such \r\nsessions on contemporary issues of importance. I could \r\nmention, for example, the incitement of hatred on \r\nthe Internet. There is an urgent need to address such \r\ndevelopments before they create further divisions in \r\nsociety and breed further intolerance and hatred.\r\nAs the workload of the Council continues to \r\nincrease, we cannot and should not ignore its financial \r\nneeds. It is a pity that the Council is not provided with \r\nsufficient money to function properly. A mechanism like \r\nthe UPR suffers due to inadequate budget provisions for \r\ntranslation services. If we want to see it work as a robust \r\nbody, we have to ensure that the requisite means are at \r\nits disposal. We would urge the General Assembly to \r\ntake this into consideration when budgetary questions \r\nare considered in the relevant Committees.\r\nMr. Ulibarri (Costa Rica) (spoke in Spanish): We \r\nthank the President of the Human Rights Council, \r\nMs. Laura Dupuy Lasserre, for the report on the work \r\nof the Council (A/67/53) and her briefing. We reiterate \r\nour unconditional support for the main body of the \r\nOrganization devoted to human rights.\r\nToday we are considering the content of the report \r\ndelivered pursuant to the agreements reached in \r\nresolution 65/281. Given the importance of this topic, \r\nwe thank the Chairman of the Third Committee for \r\nhaving refrained from scheduling Committee meetings \r\nat the same time as those of the General Assembly, and \r\nwe encourage the continuation of this practice. \r\nThe work of the Council during the reporting period \r\nhas been commensurate with the challenges faced by \r\nthe Council. This should continue and to that end we \r\nshould meet its financial needs, among other things. The \r\nsuccessful conclusion of the first cycle of the Universal \r\nPeriodic Review was an important achievement. We \r\nencourage all States to take part in the second cycle \r\nwith the same enthusiasm and to commit at the highest \r\nlevel to applying its recommendations. We need to \r\nseek recommendations that are ever more specific and \r\nconcrete and seek mechanisms for cooperation to build \r\nthe national capacities needed to implement them.\r\nCosta Rica has been a member of the Human \r\nRights Council since June 2011. It is from that position \r\nof undoubtedly great responsibility that we address \r\nthis meeting. Within and outside of the Council, our \r\ncountry cooperates actively on the promotion and \r\nprotection of human rights. We are guided by the \r\nexploit its full potential, the mechanism may change the \r\nculture of human rights discourse. With the second cycle \r\nof the UPR in motion, we expect it to be developed into \r\na more meaningful and effective mechanism so that we \r\ncan eventually get rid of naming and shaming through \r\nthe controversial country-specific mechanisms.\r\nOur delegation shares the view that the system of \r\nspecial procedures is important to ensure the effective \r\npromotion and proper protection of human rights. The \r\nstreamlined appointment procedure for mandate holders \r\ncan be mentioned in that connection. The selection \r\nprocess may be further improved, inter alia, through \r\nefficient outreach and periodic updating of the roster. \r\nWith the code of conduct in place, we believe that the \r\nspecial procedure is on the right track to garner the \r\ngreater legitimacy it has lacked. However, there are still \r\nreports of non-compliance with the code, which was \r\nvery meticulously crafted and unanimously adopted in \r\nthe Human Rights Council. We would emphasize the \r\ncritical importance that the mandate holders abide by \r\nthe code of conduct and remain within their respective \r\njurisdictions for the proper functioning and credibility \r\nof the procedure.\r\nOn the creation of new mandates, the Council \r\nshould be careful to avoid unnecessary proliferation \r\nor attaching undue importance to a particular group \r\nof rights or thematic areas. In total, there should be a \r\nbalance between the two major groups of rights. The \r\nCouncil should also avoid bringing in controversial \r\nissues or norms that are not universally accepted \r\nthrough any loopholes.\r\nThe relationship of the Office of the United \r\nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights with \r\nthe Human Rights Council remains an issue. We \r\nattach great importance to the position of the High \r\nCommissioner in promoting and protecting human \r\nrights. High Commissioners have, over the years, \r\nplayed an important role in upholding human rights \r\nall over the world. We support non-interference in her \r\nactivities. However, as is the case in other bodies of \r\nthe United Nations, the Human Rights Council should \r\nhave oversight responsibility. That issue should be \r\nconsidered at an appropriate time.\r\nThe Council is organizing ever more special \r\nsessions to deal with human right emergencies. The \r\ninitiative, nevertheless, has to date remained focused \r\non country situations. There are critical thematic issues \r\nthat deserve urgent attention. We had one such session \r\n26 12-58933\r\nA/67/PV.37\r\ninvestment in social development and the promotion of \r\neconomic, social and cultural rights. Costa Rica was \r\nthe first country to sign the International Covenant \r\non Civil and Political Rights and the International \r\nCovenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. We \r\nplayed a key role in the establishment of the Office of \r\nthe High Commissioner for Human Rights and in the \r\nadoption of the Optional Protocol to the Convention \r\nagainst Torture. \r\nMore recently, we have been working constructively \r\nand actively in Geneva and New York in the review \r\nprocess of the Human Rights Council and the process \r\naimed at strengthening the treaty bodies. We have \r\nextended an open invitation to all special procedures \r\nof the United Nations, and we are ready and willing \r\nto cooperate effectively with the human rights \r\nmechanisms.\r\nCosta Rica would like to continue to cooperate \r\nconstructively with the work of the Council and has \r\ntherefore presented its candidacy for re-election \r\nfor the period from 2014 to 2017. We are committed \r\nto remaining open to dialogue and transparency \r\nconcerning our actions in that body.\r\nMr. Sareer (Maldives): Let me first of all extend \r\nour appreciation to Her Excellency Ms. Laura Dupuy \r\nLasserre, President of the Human Rights Council, for \r\nbeing here with us today and for the presentation of the \r\nreport of the Human Rights Council (A/67/53) to the \r\nGeneral Assembly for this session. \r\nWe take note of a number of important milestones \r\nachieved in the wake of an eventful and highly \r\nproductive year for the Council and welcome the \r\nleadership role taken by the Human Rights Council \r\non the most pressing and urgent matters before the \r\ninternational community, where other United Nations \r\norgans have failed.\r\nLet me also take this opportunity to extend our \r\nsincere congratulations to all Member States that were \r\nrecently elected to the Human Rights Council for the \r\nterm from 2013 to 2016. Maldives looks forward to \r\nworking closely with those delegations in Geneva in a \r\nconstructive manner on all issues before the Council \r\nwhen they assume their seats.\r\nAs a member of the Human Rights Council, \r\nMaldives has continued to play an active part in \r\nsupporting the promotion and protection of human \r\nrights in the international arena as well as domestically. \r\nprinciples of universality, impartiality, objectivity, \r\nnon-selectivity, non-politicization, constructive dialogue \r\nand cooperation. \r\nCosta Rica is working actively in interregional \r\ngroups and seeking to build bridges and contribute \r\nto the effective implementation of the decisions and \r\nresolutions issued by the Council. Working with \r\nother countries and through long-term dialogue and \r\nnegotiations, we have focused in particular on areas \r\nsuch as human rights education and training and the \r\nrelationship between human rights, climate change and \r\nthe environment. \r\nAs part of a like-minded group of countries, we \r\nwere able to bring about the adoption of the United \r\nNations declaration on human rights education and \r\ntraining and the second phase of the World Programme \r\nfor Human Rights Education. Furthermore, at the \r\ntwenty-first session, held last September, we sponsored \r\na new and successful resolution that follows up on the \r\nProgramme (A/HRC/RES/21/14). The resolution was \r\nsponsored by 85 delegations and adopted by consensus. \r\nDuring the nineteenth session, we reached consensus \r\nin the Council on establishing the post of independent \r\nexpert on the issue of human rights obligations relating \r\nto the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable \r\nenvironment (see A/HRC/RES/19/10). \r\nWe have also sought to contribute, as Chair \r\nof the Council’s situations group, and specifically \r\nthrough Ambassador Christian Guillermet-Fernández, \r\nto fostering renewed involvement by members and \r\ngenerating greater credibility and efficacy in that body. \r\nAnother of our Council priorities has been the \r\npromotion of the human right to peace. In that regard, \r\nwe should like to highlight the resolution adopted at \r\nthe twentieth session that establishes a working group \r\nto progressively negotiate a draft declaration on the \r\nsubject (A/HRC/RES/20/15). As a country with no \r\narmy, which has entrusted its very existence to the \r\nproper functioning of the multilateral system, that \r\ncodification initiative has been of great importance.\r\nOur commitment to the cause of human rights is not \r\nmerely a key component of our foreign policy, it also \r\nhas deep roots in our national identity and practices. \r\nWe have had mandatory and free primary education for \r\nboth boys and girls since 1869. We abolished the death \r\npenalty in 1882 and our army in 1949. We continue \r\nto honour that historic tradition with a significant \r\n12-58933 27\r\nA/67/PV.37\r\nachievement in the light of the Arab Spring and the \r\nongoing efforts to promote human rights by members to \r\nadd value to the revolutionary changes on the ground.\r\nOn the domestic front, Maldives is currently \r\nengaged in a process to consolidate its newly formed \r\ndemocratic institutional framework. While the country \r\nis faced with a number of challenges in that endeavour, \r\nemphasis has been given to the most immediate \r\nmeasures, such as enhancing the administration of \r\njustice, strengthening independent institutions and \r\noversight mechanisms, and improving the capabilities \r\nof law enforcement agencies. Those reforms are aimed \r\nat ensuring that human rights and greater freedoms \r\nare effectively implemented, as stipulated under the \r\nConstitution of Maldives.\r\nThe Human Rights Council, in our view, has largely \r\nbeen a success and a force for good. In recent times, \r\nwe have all too often seen the politics of diplomacy \r\nimpede the work of United Nations bodies with little or \r\nno regard to the basic rights of ordinary people, which \r\nwe are committed to protecting. The lack of consensus \r\nand the impotence of the Security Council are one such \r\nexample demonstrating that members need to do more \r\nin working together to overcome their differences.\r\nThe work of the Human Rights Council on matters \r\nrelating to the situation of human rights in respective \r\ncountries has been commendable, and Maldives \r\nwill continue to strongly support mechanisms in the \r\nCouncil that are aimed at the independent investigation \r\nof atrocities committed in countries, especially in such \r\ntumultuous times as these, with a view to enabling \r\ntransparent, open and inclusive processes that would \r\neffectively uphold the basic tenets of why the Human \r\nRights Council was created in the first place.\r\nOn the issue of Palestine, Maldives will continue \r\nto support the creation of an independent State of \r\nPalestine, living side by side and at peace with the \r\nState of Israel. We remain, however, deeply concerned \r\nby the repeated violations of the human rights of the \r\nPalestinians living under appalling conditions in the \r\noccupied territories.\r\nIn conclusion, Maldives looks forward to an active \r\nyear in the Council, and we would like to see a continued \r\nfocus on the situation in the Middle East. We would also \r\nlike to see the active participation of all Member States \r\nin the work of the Council, especially the small island \r\ndeveloping States and the least developed countries. \r\nWe will continue to work within the Council with other \r\nMember States, United Nations bodies and civil society \r\nto ensure that universal values on the promotion and \r\nprotection of basic rights are upheld and respected by \r\nall States Members of the United Nations.\r\nSince assuming its seat on the Council in 2010, \r\nMaldives has collaborated with all delegations on \r\nnumerous issues that we deemed important to the \r\neffective functioning of the international human rights \r\nmachinery. In March, during the nineteenth session \r\nof the Council, Maldives, along with a core group of \r\ncountries, submitted a draft resolution entitled “Human \r\nrights and the environment” (A/HRC/RES/19/10), \r\nwhich established a special mandate holder to look \r\ninto the relationship between human rights and the \r\nenvironment. We believe that the protection of the \r\nenvironment and human rights are intrinsically linked, \r\nand we hope that the work of the independent expert on \r\nhuman rights and the environment will bring to fruition \r\nthe core interests of Member States at the national, \r\nregional and international levels on this important \r\nissue.\r\nMaldives also worked with a cross-regional \r\ngroup of countries to create a voluntary trust fund to \r\nsupport activities designed to enhance and improve the \r\ncapacities of least developed countries and small island \r\ndeveloping States in order to encourage their effective \r\nparticipation in the work of the Council. The resolution \r\n(A/HRC/RES/19/26), which had 113 sponsors, with \r\nbroad cross-regional support, establishes a strong \r\nmandate to encourage smaller delegations to participate \r\nmore effectively and actively in the consultative and \r\ndecision-making processes on human rights matters. \r\nThe initiative was also important to a number of \r\ndelegations that do not have diplomatic representation \r\nin Geneva. It provided them with a mechanism \r\nthrough which their contributions to the Council can \r\nbe facilitated, and it upheld the principle of universal \r\nparticipation in all matters relating to human rights.\r\nDuring the twenty-first session of the Council, in \r\nSeptember, Maldives, along with a number of other key \r\npartners, continued to support the initiative on the right \r\nto freedom of assembly and of association. This year’s \r\nresolution (A/HRC/RES/21/16) was focused on the role \r\nof civil society in promoting the freedom of assembly \r\nand association. In 2012, the same group of countries \r\ncreated the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the \r\nrights to freedom of peaceful assembly and association. \r\nWe believe that is a substantial cross-regional \r\n28 12-58933\r\nA/67/PV.37\r\nAt its most recent session, the Human Rights \r\nCouncil unanimously decided to extend the mandate of \r\nthe Independent Expert on the situation of human rights \r\nin the Sudan in order to provide technical assistance \r\nunder agenda item 10. The decision represented the \r\nCouncil’s recognition of the positive developments in \r\nthe human rights situation in the Sudan and clearly \r\nreflects the efforts of the Government of the Sudan \r\nto promote and protect human rights. My delegation \r\nwelcomes that decision and hopes that the Independent \r\nExpert will help the new national human rights \r\ncommission to become fully operational, on the basis \r\nof the Paris Principles. During the first five months \r\nof its existence, the commission has drawn up a \r\ncomprehensive plan of action to protect and promote \r\nhuman rights, in cooperation and coordination with \r\nnational and international partners. \r\nIn addition, my country has seen several positive \r\ndevelopments that will certainly contribute to the \r\nprotection and promotion of human rights in the Sudan. \r\nThey include the establishment of the Transitional \r\nDarfur Regional Authority under the Doha Darfur \r\nPeace Agreement, a special court for Darfur, and the \r\npost of special prosecutor for Darfur. \r\nThe Government has accepted the humanitarian \r\nmandate for Blue Nile and Southern Kordofan. \r\nMoreover, in an economic initiative for the two States, \r\na series of measures have been adopted to expand \r\nagriculture, including the heightening of the Roseires \r\nDam in Blue Nile province. In Abyei, the deployment \r\nof the United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei \r\nis complete, and the signing of the nine sub-agreements \r\non cooperation with our sister country, the Republic \r\nof South Sudan, represents the culmination of many \r\nefforts. \r\nIn conclusion, my delegation calls for sufficient \r\nfunds to be made available to enable the Council and the \r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights to thoroughly \r\nfulfil their responsibilities, notably by giving economic, \r\nsocial and cultural rights the same priority accorded to \r\ncivil and political rights and by opposing the tendency \r\nto exploit concept of the freedom of expression and \r\nopinion to insult religions, faiths and creeds, or to \r\njustify acts that incite hatred and violence based on \r\nreligions or creeds. We also ask the Council to avoid \r\nthe inclusion of controversial concepts in its work. \r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): In \r\naccordance with resolution 57/32 of 19 November \r\nMaldives attaches great importance to the \r\nadvancement of women and the promotion and protection \r\nof the rights of the child. During our membership of the \r\nCouncil so far, Maldives has been a strong supporter \r\nof the Universal Periodic Review process and has \r\nsupported various initiatives in the Council that would \r\nfurther enhance and improve multilateral efforts to \r\npromote human rights domestically and globally.\r\nMr. Elbahi (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): At the outset, \r\nmy delegation expresses its thanks and appreciation \r\nto Ambassador Laura Dupuy Lasserre, President of \r\nthe Human Rights Council, for the comprehensive \r\nstatement that she delivered here and the one that she \r\nwill deliver to the Third Committee later today, in \r\naccordance with resolution 65/281. We wish her every \r\nsuccess in accomplishing her tasks. \r\nThe establishment of the Human Rights Council \r\nsix years ago was an important achievement for \r\nthe General Assembly and its subsidiary organs in \r\naddressing human rights issues on the basis of the \r\nequality of all member States, and as reflected in the \r\nUniversal Periodic Review, to which all members \r\nwithout exception are subject. The Council also \r\nprovides advice, in accordance with its mandate set out \r\nin resolution 60/251, through the special procedures \r\nsystem. That is an important service provided that \r\nmandate holders adhere to the principles of impartiality \r\nand avoid politicization and selectivity, according to the \r\ntext of the mandates and the Code of Conduct for Special \r\nProcedures Mandate-holders of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, adopted by the Council in its resolution 5/2 \r\nand re-emphasized in its resolution 11/11 of June 2009.\r\nIn reiterating the Sudan’s cooperation with the \r\nHuman Rights Council, it is my pleasure to report that \r\nthe Sudan submitted its first report to the Universal \r\nPeriodic Review in Geneva last year, accepted its \r\nrecommendations and established a special mechanism \r\nto implement them. The mechanism is a high-level \r\nnational commission under the Advisory Council \r\non Human Rights, which is the highest Government \r\nauthority for the promotion and protection of human \r\nrights in the Sudan. Those positive developments, \r\nwhich were included in the report, in addition to the \r\nSudan’s signing of the Convention on the Rights of \r\nthe Child and its two Optional Protocols, have been \r\nwelcomed by the Council. My delegation reiterates \r\nonce more its readiness to abide by and implement all \r\nthe recommendations of the Universal Periodic Review.\r\n12-58933 29\r\nA/67/PV.37\r\na minimum, parliaments need to be informed of the \r\nreport and should have a possibility to debate it before \r\nit is sent to the Council in Geneva.\r\nShould members of parliament also be part of the \r\nofficial delegation presenting the report to the Council? \r\nAgain, opinions differ — largely for the same reasons as \r\nthose related to parliaments’ contributions to the drafting \r\nprocess. However, no one seems to disagree that there \r\nis great merit in allowing members of parliament, in \r\nan observer capacity as part of their official delegation \r\nor otherwise, to attend the interactive dialogue in the \r\nCouncil on their countries’ situation. As a result, they \r\nwill gain direct insight into the functioning of the UPR \r\nand get first-hand impressions of how the executive \r\nfared in the process, in particular how it responded \r\nto questions and concerns from the Council and what \r\ncommitments it decided to undertake. \r\nIdeally, parliamentarians attending the Council’s \r\nsessions should represent both the majority and \r\nopposition parties in parliament and work directly on \r\nhuman rights issues, such as members of dedicated \r\nparliamentary human rights committees.\r\nAllowing parliaments to contribute to the UPR \r\nrequires the Council to take full account of that \r\ncontribution and, where possible, seek to promote it \r\nin the course of its own deliberations. For instance, \r\nnothing is preventing the Council from questioning \r\nofficial delegations whether their parliament has seen \r\nor debated the report. In the same vein, the Council can \r\nask official delegations if they intend to subsequently \r\ninform their parliaments of the UPR recommendations.\r\nThe IPU, with the support of the presidency of \r\nthe Human Rights Council, has undertaken several \r\nactivities this year to raise awareness among Council \r\nmembers and the human rights community at large \r\nto illustrate in concrete terms how parliaments have \r\ndirectly contributed to the impact of its work at the \r\nnational level, and thus bring home the message that the \r\nCouncil has much to gain by enhancing parliamentary \r\ninvolvement in its work. The IPU intends to take those \r\ninitiatives to the next level in 2013 and to advocate for \r\nthe organization of a panel discussion of the Council, \r\nas part of its official programme, on the contribution \r\nof parliaments to the UPR and, more largely, to the \r\npromotion of human rights, so as to strengthen synergies \r\nbetween the Council and parliaments.\r\nLet me conclude by referring to resolution 66/261, \r\nwhich the Assembly adopted in May, on interaction \r\n2002, I now give the f loor to the observer of the \r\nInter-Parliamentary Union.\r\nMr. Bermeo Estrella (Inter-Parliamentary Union): \r\nThe Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) continues to work \r\nfor stronger parliamentary engagement with existing \r\nUnited Nations mechanisms to enhance respect for \r\nhuman rights. Since the beginning of the year, the work \r\nhas centred in particular on associating parliaments \r\nmore closely with the work of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, in particular its Universal Periodic Review \r\n(UPR) mechanism.\r\nThe IPU believes that parliaments have a critical \r\nrole to play to ensure that the UPR becomes ever \r\nmore effective. Parliaments, through their legislative, \r\noversight and budgetary functions, can directly \r\ncontribute to the success of the UPR. However, a \r\nstudy that we conducted in 2009 to assess the extent to \r\nwhich parliaments were involved in the UPR process \r\nfound that the vast majority were not even aware of the \r\nexistence of the UPR.\r\nThe IPU has therefore made it a priority to raise \r\nawareness among parliaments about the UPR and \r\nabout the contribution that they can make to it. From \r\nthe beginning of this year, the IPU has systematically \r\ninformed parliaments of the forthcoming examination \r\nof their countries’ national reports. We have started \r\nto organize capacity-building workshops for \r\nparliamentarians to promote a better understanding of \r\nthe UPR and of the role of parliaments. As part of those \r\nefforts, earlier this week the IPU, together with the \r\nCommonwealth Secretariat, brought together more than \r\n70 parliamentarians and staff from some 30 countries. \r\nWithout exception, participants underscored our earlier \r\nfindings that once parliaments knew about the UPR, \r\nthey wanted to be associated with it. \r\nThe question, of course, is how to do that. There is no \r\ndoubt that parliaments have a key role to play in helping \r\nto ensure that UPR recommendations are translated \r\ninto national action. However, should parliaments \r\nalso contribute to the drafting of the report? There are \r\nsome who say it should not, because it is the preserve \r\nof executive branches and because parliaments would \r\notherwise compromise its independence. However, \r\nothers believe that nothing prevents parliaments from \r\ncontributing to the report and subsequently holding \r\nGovernments to account for the implementation \r\nof the UPR recommendations. Whichever side one \r\nwould choose, there seems to be consensus that, as \r\n30 12-58933\r\nA/67/PV.37\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nGeneral Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 64. \r\nAgenda item 75\r\nOceans and the law of the sea\r\nDraft resolution (A/67/L.4)\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): Before \r\nwe proceed, I would like to remind members that the \r\ndebate on agenda item 75 and its sub-items (a) and (b) is \r\nscheduled to the place on Tuesday, 11 December. I should \r\nalso like to remind members that the commemoration \r\nof the thirtieth anniversary of the opening for signature \r\nof the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea \r\nwill take place on Monday, 10 December.\r\nWe shall now consider draft resolution A/67/L.4, \r\nentitled “Plenary meetings of the General Assembly on \r\n10 and 11 December 2012 devoted to the consideration \r\nof the item entitled ‘Oceans and the law of the sea’ and \r\nto the commemoration of the thirtieth anniversary of the \r\nopening for signature of the United Nations Convention \r\non the Law of the Sea”.\r\nI now give the f loor to the representative of the \r\nSecretariat.\r\nMr. Zhang Saijin (Department for General \r\nAssembly and Conference Management): I wish to \r\nannounce that since the issuance of document A/67/L.4, \r\nthe following countries have also become sponsors of \r\nthe draft resolution: the Bahamas, Barbados, Belgium, \r\nBelize, Denmark, Estonia, Fiji, Finland, Greece, \r\nLithuania, Madagascar, Montenegro, Poland, Portugal, \r\nSaint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, \r\nSuriname, Tonga and the United Republic of Tanzania. \r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): May I \r\ntake it that the General Assembly decides to adopt draft \r\nresolution A/67/L.4?\r\nDraft resolution A/67/L.4 was adopted \r\n(resolution 67/5).\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now give \r\nthe f loor to the representative of Argentina to make a \r\nstatement following the adoption of resolution 67/5.\r\nMs. Millicay (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nArgentina would like to acknowledge the many \r\ndelegations that have worked in a very cooperative \r\nand active way to promote the commemoration of \r\nthe thirtieth anniversary of the signing of the United \r\nbetween the United Nations, national parliaments and \r\nthe IPU and in which the Assembly encourages the IPU \r\nto provide a parliamentary contribution to the Human \r\nRights Council. \r\nI hope that my intervention has shown the Assembly \r\nthat the IPU is as determined, as ever, to play its role \r\nin ensuring greater parliamentary involvement in the \r\nHuman Rights Council and, more specifically, in the \r\nUPR, with a view to enhancing its effectiveness.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): We have \r\nheard the last speaker in the debate on agenda item 64. \r\nA representative has requested to speak in exercise \r\nof the right of reply. Before giving the f loor to that \r\nrepresentative, may I remind members that statements \r\nin exercise of the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes \r\nfor the first intervention and to five minutes for the \r\nsecond intervention and should be made by delegations \r\nfrom their seats. \r\nI now give the fl oor to the representative of Bahrain.\r\nMs. Alkhalifa (Bahrain): We take the f loor in \r\nexercise of the right of reply to the statement given by the \r\nrepresentative of the Principality of Liechtenstein. The \r\nKingdom of Bahrain would like to note that any observer \r\nof the transparent interaction and active engagement \r\nof the Kingdom with the Human Rights Council, the \r\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for \r\nHuman Rights and the various mandate holders should \r\nbe reassured of Bahrain’s commitment to the promotion \r\nand the protection of human rights.\r\nOur participation as the first country to undergo \r\nthe Universal Periodic Review (UPR) process in both \r\nits first and second cycles, in connection with which \r\nwe fully accepted 90 per cent of the recommendations \r\npresented in September, is a fact that should be \r\nwelcomed and lauded by our peers. Any doubt cast on \r\nthe commitments of the Kingdom of Bahrain reflect \r\nblatant disregard of the continuous efforts made by the \r\nKingdom to fulfil its international obligations.\r\nThe Kingdom of Bahrain will continue on its \r\npath of reform, a fact that is reflected in the various \r\nreports of our international partners. Those reports, \r\nsuch as that of the working group of the UPR, are all \r\npublic documents.
