May I take it that the Assembly takes note of \r\nthis document?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: May I take it that it is the wish of \r\nthe General Assembly to conclude its consideration of \r\nagenda item 108?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda items 30 and 117\r\nReport of the Security Council\r\nReport of the Security Council (A/67/2)\r\nQuestion of equitable representation on and \r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council \r\nand related matters\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to the President \r\nof the Security Council, His Excellency Mr. Hardeep \r\nSingh Puri, to introduce the report of the Security \r\nCouncil (A/67/2).\r\nMr. Hardeep Singh Puri (India), President of the \r\nSecurity Council: Mr. President, I would like, first of \r\nall, to congratulate you on behalf of the members of the \r\nSecurity Council on your election as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. It is an honour for me, as President \r\nof the Security Council for the month of November, \r\nto introduce the annual report of the Security Council \r\n(A/67/2). The presentation of the report is more than \r\na regular reporting exercise pursuant to the United \r\nNations Charter. The report underscores the importance \r\nof the relationship between both principal organs of the \r\nUnited Nations and provides an excellent opportunity \r\nto debate and exchange views with the general \r\nmembership on the report on the work of the Council. I \r\nam therefore grateful to you, Mr. President, for having \r\narranged today’s meeting for the consideration of the \r\nSecurity Council’s annual report.\r\nThe report covers the period from August 2011 to \r\nJuly 2012. The introduction to the report was prepared \r\nby the delegation of Colombia, which held the presidency \r\nUnited Nations A/67/PV.38\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-seventh session\r\n38th plenary meeting\r\nThursday, 15 November 2012, 10 a.m.\r\nNew York\r\nOffi cial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Jeremić  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Serbia)\r\n2 12-59129\r\nA/67/PV.38\r\nin July 2012. I wish to thank Ambassador Néstor \r\nOsorio and his team for their efforts in preparing the \r\nintroduction, to which I call the Assembly’s attention, \r\nbecause it gives a helpful overview of the different \r\nactivities under the responsibility of the Council \r\nduring the reporting period. Allow me also to thank the \r\nSecretariat, which prepared the other parts of the report \r\nnow before the Assembly.\r\nI would also like to highlight the monthly \r\nassessments by each presidency, which are mentioned \r\nin the report. They contain information, set forth on a \r\nmonthly basis, on the most relevant activities carried \r\nout by the Council on each item of its agenda, thus \r\nfacilitating the overall comprehension of the report. \r\nThose monthly assessments are an important exercise, \r\nregularly undertaken as part of the responsibility of \r\neach presidency and are aimed at informing the wider \r\nmembership about the work of the Council. I call the \r\nAssembly’s attention to them as well.\r\nDuring the reporting period, the Council adopted \r\n60 resolutions and 25 presidential statements and \r\nissued 83 statements to the press. The Council held 222 \r\nformal meetings, of which 205 were public meetings. \r\nOpen meetings, including open debates, increased the \r\ntransparency in the work of the Council and allowed for \r\nenhanced participation by the wider membership and \r\nthe international community. The presidencies of the \r\nCouncil and of the General Assembly continued to meet \r\nregularly throughout the year, and monthly briefings by \r\nthe Presidents of the Council to the wider membership \r\non the Council’s work continued to be held.\r\nMeetings with troop contributors have also taken \r\nplace as a regular practice, in particular prior to any \r\ndecision that would have an impact on United Nations \r\npeacekeeping mandates, as a way to enable the \r\ncollection of relevant inputs. Those practices represent \r\nuseful steps aimed at promoting better dialogue with \r\nthe general membership on the work of the Council. \r\nWe encourage delegations to make use of those \r\nopportunities to strengthen such interaction.\r\nThe Council continued its implementation of \r\nnote S/2010/507 on working methods and sought to \r\nundertake further reform of the Council’s working \r\nmethods wherever possible, including by better \r\nplanning and spreading out its workload, ensuring that \r\nreporting requirements were adequate to their purpose \r\nand providing for more efficient use of conference \r\nresources and more interactive exchanges among \r\nCouncil members. Presidencies have promoted useful \r\npractices aimed at increasing efficiency and expediency, \r\nsuch as streamlined introductions by the President and \r\nvideo conferences in open briefings and debates aimed \r\nat providing updates from the field. Council members \r\nhave agreed to reduce the use of speakers’ lists and \r\nbetter use of “Other matters” to discuss issues of \r\nconcern. Informal interactive dialogues were also held \r\nregularly as a useful consultation practice.\r\nDuring the period of the report, many of the \r\nactivities of the Council were centred, as in previous \r\nyears, on situations in Africa, including the Sudan, \r\nDarfur, South Sudan, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Somalia, \r\nand the question of piracy off the coast of Somalia and in \r\nthe Gulf of Guinea. The two missions conducted by the \r\nCouncil during the period under review were to Haiti, \r\nin February 2012, and West Africa — Côte d’Ivoire, \r\nLiberia, and Sierra Leone — in May. The Council also \r\nheld a consultative meeting with the African Union \r\nPeace and Security Council in New York in June.\r\nThe Security Council closely followed the \r\nunresolved disputes between the Sudan and South \r\nSudan after the latter’s independence in July 2011. \r\nFollowing the resumption of fighting on the border, \r\nthe Council adopted resolution 2046 (2012) in May to \r\nendorse the African Union road map and to demand \r\nthat the parties achieve a negotiated solution for all \r\nunresolved issues after the secession within a period \r\nof three months. The Council also continued to closely \r\nfollow the implementation of resolution 2046 (2012) \r\nand remained seized of the ongoing negotiations \r\nbetween the Sudan and South Sudan to resolve the \r\noutstanding Comprehensive Peace Agreement issues \r\nunder the auspices of the African Union High-level \r\nImplementation Panel.\r\nWith regard to Somalia, the Security Council’s strong \r\nsupport for the transition process was instrumental \r\nin bringing to power the most representative Somali \r\nleadership in decades. The joint African Union-United \r\nNations technical assessment mission resulted in a \r\nrevised concept of operations for the African Union \r\nMission in Somalia, which contributed to a significant \r\nimprovement in the security situation across the \r\ncountry.\r\nThe Council considered the events in various \r\ncountries on its agenda prior to, during and after \r\nelections that took place during the period under \r\nreview. Following developments in Libya and taking \r\nnote of the Declaration of Liberation, the Security \r\nCouncil unanimously adopted resolution 2016 (2011) on \r\n12-59129 3\r\nA/67/PV.38\r\n27 October 2011, reiterating the need for the transitional \r\nperiod to be underpinned by a commitment to democracy \r\nand respect for human rights, and terminating the \r\nmandates regarding the protection of civilians and the \r\nno-fly zone, as stipulated in resolution 1973 (2011).\r\nThe Security Council reacted repeatedly with \r\nconcern to the worsening security and humanitarian \r\nsituation in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo \r\nowing to the violence caused by the Mouvement du 23 \r\nmars and all armed groups. Following the deterioration \r\nof the security situation in Mali with the 20 March \r\nmilitary coup and the northern part of the country \r\nbeing occupied by armed rebel and terrorist groups, \r\nthe Security Council unanimously adopted resolution \r\n2056 (2012) on 5 July to set a comprehensive path to \r\nsolve all aspects of the crisis. The Security Council \r\nalso requested the elaboration and implementation \r\nof a United Nations integrated strategy for the Sahel. \r\nReiterating its strong condemnation of the 12 April \r\nmilitary coup that occurred in Guinea-Bissau, the \r\nSecurity Council unanimously adopted resolution 2048 \r\n(2012) on 18 May, demanding the restoration of and \r\nrespect for the constitutional order.\r\nDevelopments in the Middle East, including the \r\nPalestinian question and the ongoing effects of the Arab \r\nSpring, remained prominent on the Council’s agenda. \r\nThe Council held monthly briefings and consultations \r\non the situation in the Middle East, including the \r\nPalestinian question, and quarterly open debates on the \r\nissue. Members expressed concern at the continuing \r\nstalemate in the Middle East peace process and urged \r\nthe negotiated settlement of all issues. The Council \r\nalso heard briefings from the High Commissioner for \r\nHuman Rights and the Office for the Coordination \r\nof Humanitarian Affairs on the human rights and \r\nhumanitarian situation in the occupied Palestinian \r\nterritory.\r\nThe Council closely followed developments in \r\nSyria, Yemen, Iraq and Lebanon. One of the main \r\nissues considered by the Council was the application \r\nof Palestine for membership in the United Nations. \r\nFollowing the adoption of various press statements \r\nin 2011, the Council in April 2012 unanimously \r\nadopted resolution 2042 (2012), authorizing an \r\nadvance team to monitor the ceasefire in Syria, and \r\nresolution 2043 (2012), establishing the United Nations \r\nSupervision Mission in Syria to monitor and support \r\nthe implementation of the six-point proposal of the Joint \r\nSpecial Envoy of the United Nations and the League of \r\nArab States, Mr. Kofi Annan.\r\nWith respect to the situation in Yemen, the \r\nCouncil unanimously adopted resolution 2051 (2012), \r\nexpressing support to President Hadi Mansour and \r\nthe Government of National Unity of Yemen to move \r\nthe transition process forward and encouraging \r\nthe international community to provide active and \r\nincreasing support to help the Yemeni Government \r\nmeet the outstanding political, security, economic and \r\nhumanitarian challenges.\r\nThe Council also continued to monitor developments \r\nin Afghanistan and countries of the Asian region, \r\nincluding the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, \r\nMyanmar and Timor-Leste.\r\nIn Europe, the Security Council followed up \r\non its long-standing interest in exploring ways and \r\nmeans to support Bosnia and Herzegovina in its \r\ninstitutionalization process, as well as encouraging \r\ngreater progress in the negotiations in Cyprus, and \r\nmonitored the United Nations Interim Administration \r\nMission in Kosovo and the pacific settlement of \r\ndifferences through the Belgrade-Pristina dialogue.\r\nThe Security Council reaffirmed its commitment to \r\nensuring stability and security in Haiti and to assisting \r\nthat country in the rebuilding process by extending the \r\nmandate of United Nations Stabilization Mission in \r\nHaiti through resolution 2012 (2011).\r\nThe issue of the non-proliferation of weapons \r\nof mass destruction also figured prominently on the \r\nagenda.\r\nThe Council also considered issues concerning \r\nthe International Tribunals for Rwanda and the former \r\nYugoslavia, and heard reports from the Prosecutor of \r\nthe International Criminal Court and the President of \r\nthe International Court of Justice.\r\nOther priorities of the Council’s work included \r\nthematic, general and cross-cutting issues. Debates \r\nand consultations were held on peace and security in \r\nAfrica and support for the United Nations Office in \r\nWest Africa and the United Nations Regional Office \r\nfor Central Africa.\r\nThe Council commended and promoted cooperation \r\nwith sub-regional organizations and in particular with \r\nthe African Union via resolution 2033 (2012), which \r\nencourages the enhancement of the relationship.\r\n4 12-59129\r\nA/67/PV.38\r\nThe issues of children and armed conflict, women \r\nand peace and security, the protection of civilians \r\nand post-conflict peacebuilding also figured on the \r\nCouncil’s agenda, with several important debates being \r\nheld during the period. In August 2011, following \r\nan open debate on United Nations peacekeeping \r\noperations, the Council adopted a presidential statement \r\n(S/PRST/2011/17), which, among other things, sought \r\nto deepen the existing cooperation among the Council, \r\nthe Secretariat and the troop- and police-contributing \r\ncountries.\r\nDuring the reporting period, the Security Council \r\nalso approved 25 resolutions extending the mandates of \r\nvarious peacekeeping and monitoring missions.\r\nIn July, the Council held an open debate on post-\r\nconflict peacebuilding (S/PV.6805) to consider the \r\nannual report of the Peacebuilding Commission \r\n(S/2012/70), which was followed by an interactive \r\ndialogue focused on how to realize the Commission’s \r\nfull potential and bring all parties together around \r\ncommon strategies.\r\nThe Security Council remained seized of the threat \r\nposed by terrorism and heard regular briefings by \r\nthe Chairs of the Committees established pursuant to \r\nresolutions 1267 (1999) and 1989 (2011), 1373 (2001) \r\nand 1540 (2004). In press statements the Council \r\nstrongly condemned the terrorist acts that occurred in \r\nvarious locations between August 2011 and July 2012.\r\nI could go on and on about the matters that were \r\nunder the Council’s consideration during the reporting \r\nperiod. But I would rather listen to you, Mr. President, \r\nand to the representatives of other Member States. I \r\nhave therefore not mentioned several other issues that \r\nare discussed in detail in the report and that may be \r\nreferred to.\r\nThe annual report before the Assembly includes \r\na significant amount of analytical, descriptive and \r\nstatistical information on the work of the Council, the \r\npreparation of which required serious effort on the \r\npart of delegations in the Council and the Secretariat. \r\nI hope that Member States will seize this opportunity \r\nto discuss the report, and I will be glad to take their \r\nsuggestions back to my colleagues in the Council. \r\nThere is always room for improvement, and Council \r\nmembers will benefit from the Assembly’s comments \r\nand suggestions.\r\nMr. Khalil (Egypt): I have the honour to speak today \r\non behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement. At the outset, \r\nMr. President, I would like to express the Movement’s \r\nappreciation for your pledge to assist in advancing \r\nthe process of reforming the Security Council during \r\nthe sixty-seventh session of the General Assembly, \r\nand to congratulate the Permanent Representative \r\nof Afghanistan on his reappointment as chair of \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations. The Movement \r\nalso takes this opportunity to thank the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of India, the current President of the \r\nCouncil, for presenting the Security Council’s annual \r\nreport (A/67/2) for the period from 1 August 2011 to \r\n31 July 2012. We also thank the Colombian delegation \r\nfor its efforts in drafting an introduction to the report \r\nduring its presidency of the Council in July.\r\nThe Non-Aligned Movement attaches great \r\nimportance to achieving concrete results on Security \r\nCouncil reform through intergovernmental negotiations, \r\non the basis of decision 62/557 and subsequent \r\ndecisions, culminating in decision 65/554. Reform of \r\nthe Security Council should be addressed in a timely, \r\ncomprehensive, transparent and balanced manner, \r\nwithout setting artificial deadlines. It should also \r\naddress all substantive issues relating to the question \r\nof membership, regional representation, the Council’s \r\nagenda, its working methods and its decision-making \r\nprocess, including the veto. It should seek to garner \r\nthe widest possible political acceptance on the part of \r\nMember States, in line with the provisions of the Charter \r\nand the relevant decisions, particularly decision 62/557.\r\nEnlarging the Security Council and reforming \r\nits working methods should seek to make it more \r\ndemocratic, representative, accountable and \r\neffective. In that context, the sixteenth Summit of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement, held in Tehran, acknowledged \r\nthe historical injustice done to Africa with regard to its \r\nrepresentation in the Council and expressed support for \r\nits increased and enhanced representation in a reformed \r\nSecurity Council. The Summit also took note of the \r\nAfrican common position, as reflected in the Ezulwini \r\nConsensus and the Sirte Declaration.\r\nImproving the Security Council’s working methods \r\nis crucial to its effectiveness. Transparency, openness \r\nand consistency are key elements that it should maintain \r\nin all its activities. The Non-Aligned Movement \r\ncontinues to reject any attempt to use the Council as a \r\nplatform to pursue national political agendas. We stress \r\nthe importance of non-selectivity and impartiality in its \r\nwork. The Movement also reiterates its concern about \r\nthe Security Council’s continued encroachment on the \r\n12-59129 5\r\nA/67/PV.38\r\nfunctions and powers of the General Assembly and \r\nthe Economic and Social Council by addressing issues \r\nthat traditionally fall within the competence of those \r\nbodies. We reject the Council’s constant attempts to \r\nuse thematic issues under its consideration to expand \r\nits mandate into areas that do not pose a threat to \r\ninternational peace and security. The Council should \r\nkeep strictly within the powers and functions accorded \r\nto it by Member States under the United Nations \r\nCharter.\r\nThe sanctions imposed by the Security Council \r\nremain an issue of serious concern to the non-aligned \r\ncountries. The objectives of the sanctions regimes \r\nshould be clearly defined, their imposition should be \r\nfor a specific time frame, and they should be based on \r\ntenable legal grounds.\r\nThe Security Council’s accountability to the \r\nGeneral Assembly is well established in the Charter. \r\nThe Assembly’s consideration of the Council’s annual \r\nreport is a core element in the relationship between \r\nthose two principal organs. Resolution 66/294 on the \r\nrevitalization of the work of the General Assembly \r\nwelcomes the improvements that have been made in the \r\nquality of the Council’s annual reports and encourages \r\nthe Council to make further improvements as necessary. \r\nHaving examined this year’s report, the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement believes that there is still ample \r\nroom for improvement in its quality. The report should \r\nbe more explanatory and analytical in its assessment of \r\nthe work of the Council, including in those cases where \r\nthe Council has failed to act, as well as of the reasons \r\nbehind the various outcomes, whether in the form of \r\nresolutions, presidential statements, press releases or \r\nstatements to the press. It is also imperative that future \r\nannual reports should also reflect the general views \r\nexpressed by non-members of the Council during its \r\nopen debates. Issues to be covered at any briefings by \r\nthe Secretariat should be determined in coordination \r\nwith the concerned State or party and after approval by \r\nall members of the Security Council.\r\nThe Non-Aligned Movement supports increased \r\ncooperation between the Security Council and the \r\nAfrican Union Peace and Security Council within the \r\nframework of cooperation between the United Nations \r\nand the African Union.\r\nThe Movement regrets that the Security Council \r\nCommittee on the Admission of New Members was not \r\nable to issue a positive recommendation for Palestine’s \r\napplication for admission to full membership of the \r\nUnited Nations, owing to the lack of unanimity among \r\nCouncil members on the issue. The Movement fully \r\nsupports the application submitted by Palestine, which \r\nis consistent with the right of the Palestinian people to \r\nself-determination and independence.\r\nThe Non-Aligned Movement remains committed to \r\nthe ongoing process of the overall reform of the United \r\nNations, including of the Security Council. Any reform \r\nmeasures should be decided by the general membership \r\nthrough an intergovernmental process. The voice of \r\neach Member State must be heard and respected.\r\nI would now like to say a few more words in my \r\nnational capacity as the representative of Egypt. I \r\nwould first like to associate my remarks with the \r\nstatement to be delivered later on behalf of the African \r\nGroup. The consensus decision 62/557, establishing the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform, set clear parameters for that process, as well as its \r\nprinciples and framework. Paragraph (d) of the decision \r\nstates that intergovernmental negotiations should be \r\nbased only on proposals submitted by Member States. \r\nThe rationale is to maintain the intergovernmental \r\nnature of the process and avoid jeopardizing the \r\nimpartiality of the President of the General Assembly \r\nand the chair of the intergovernmental negotiations. \r\nThe main objective of the negotiations is to ensure the \r\nwidest possible political acceptance by Member States \r\nthemselves.\r\nThe five negotiables of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations have proved to be inextricably linked. \r\nThey constitute an integral, inseparable package that \r\nhas to be agreed upon in its entirety. That is why the \r\npiecemeal solutions and/or initiatives presented by \r\nsome groups have failed to garner the necessary support \r\nof Member States.\r\nThe intergovernmental negotiations should be \r\naimed at reaching a comprehensive agreement that \r\nwould have an effect on the power structure of the \r\nSecurity Council. Egypt, along with the African \r\nGroup, continues to oppose any drafting exercise that \r\nentails merging language and streamlining positions in \r\na text without agreeing on the principles and criteria \r\nunderlying the five key issues first.\r\nThe annual Security Council report under \r\nconsideration today mentions in its very first page \r\nthat “[m]any of the Council’s activities, discussions \r\nand efforts were concerned with the situation in \r\n6 12-59129\r\nA/67/PV.38\r\nseveral African countries” (A/67/2, p. 1). Despite that \r\nfact, Africa remains unrepresented in the permanent \r\ncategory and underrepresented in the non-permanent \r\ncategory of the Security Council compared to all other \r\nregions. The African Common Position, as reflected \r\nin the Ezulwini Consensus, does not seek to impose \r\nnational political interests. It aims at achieving the \r\nlegitimate aspirations of a whole continent that includes \r\n54 countries. We aim to rectify the historical injustice \r\ninflicted on Africa with respect to its representation in \r\nthe Security Council.\r\nEnhanced representation of the developing \r\ncountries in the Security Council has been one of the \r\nfundamental pillars of the reform process since the \r\nadoption of resolution 48/26. Egypt stresses the need to \r\nduly take into account the position of the members of the \r\nLeague of Arab States, who are demanding a permanent \r\nseat for the Arab Group in any future expansion in the \r\ncategory of permanent membership in the Council. We \r\nalso stress the need to take into account the position \r\nof the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, which is \r\ndemanding adequate representation of the Muslim \r\nworld in any category of membership in an expanded \r\nSecurity Council.\r\nFinally, I cannot conclude my statement without \r\noffering a practical reminder of the urgent necessity to \r\nreform the working methods of the Security Council. \r\nYesterday, Egypt requested an urgent meeting of the \r\nSecurity Council to address the alarming escalation by \r\nIsrael in Gaza. We deeply appreciate the earnest response \r\nof the President of the Security Council, Ambassador \r\nHardeep Singh Puri, in convening a meeting less than \r\nsix hours after our request (S/PV.6863). Yet the Council \r\nwas not able to agree on holding a public meeting. It \r\ndecided on the format of a private meeting. That proves \r\nthe need for more transparency in the Council’s work. \r\nIt shows that procedural issues raised by a limited \r\ncategory of Council members are able to obstruct the \r\nwork of the Council.\r\nIn conclusion, Egypt reiterates the need for political \r\nwill on the part of all of us, large and small, developing \r\nand developed, permanent and non-permanent \r\nmembers, in order to achieve an effective result that \r\ngarners the widest possible political acceptance.\r\nMr. Wolfe (Jamaica): I have the honour to speak \r\non behalf of the group of countries that sponsored draft \r\nresolution A/61/L.69/Rev.1 six years ago. The L.69 group \r\nbrings together a diverse group of developing countries \r\nfrom Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, and \r\nAsia and the Pacific that are united by a common cause, \r\nthat is, to achieve lasting and comprehensive reform of \r\nthe Security Council. The group is strongly united in its \r\nfirm conviction that expansion in both the permanent \r\nand the non-permanent categories of membership of \r\nthe Security Council is needed in order better to reflect \r\ncontemporary world realities and achieve a more \r\naccountable, representative and transparent Security \r\nCouncil.\r\nWe, the L.69 group, were instrumental in starting \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations. We remain \r\nengaged in those negotiations on the understanding that \r\nthe United Nations Charter, the rules of procedure of \r\nthe General Assembly and relevant General Assembly \r\nresolutions require the support of a two-thirds majority \r\nof the United Nations membership for any decision in \r\nthat regard.\r\nLet me at the outset place on record the group’s \r\nappreciation for the work of Ambassador Zahir Tanin of \r\nAfghanistan during the most recent General Assembly \r\nsession. He has been an integral and invaluable part of \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations since 2009. During \r\nthe eighth round of intergovernmental negotiations, \r\nheld during the previous General Assembly session, \r\nit was clear that the membership desires early reform \r\nthat includes expansion in both the permanent and the \r\nnon-permanent categories and improvements in the \r\nCouncil’s working methods.\r\nSecondly, the membership of the Assembly \r\nacknowledges the positive and constructive role that \r\nhas been and continues to be played by the L.69 group. \r\nIndeed, the fact that ours is the only group that has \r\nincreased in membership over the years testifies to the \r\ngroup’s influential role. In keeping with our tradition \r\nof active support for the reform process, we have also \r\nput forward a number of proposals for transforming our \r\ninteractions and deliberations into real negotiations.\r\nThirdly, our group has also been able to enhance \r\nconvergences with other like-minded groups, in \r\nparticular the African Group. The L.69 and the \r\nCommittee of 10 of the African Union have been \r\ncollaborating closely on the convergences between \r\nthem with regard to comprehensive reform. Let me \r\nreiterate today that the L.69 group acknowledges the \r\nAfrican Common Position. We are of one mind in \r\nstressing that the reform we envisage is far-reaching \r\nand intended to ensure that the Council’s structure and \r\nits way of doing business is fundamentally changed so \r\nas to make it ref lective of current geopolitical realities.\r\n12-59129 7\r\nA/67/PV.38\r\nOn each of the five key issues of Security Council \r\nreform there exist clear convergences. In the view of \r\nthe L.69 group, the convergences are as follows.\r\nFirst, the Security Council must be enlarged in \r\nboth the permanent and the non-permanent categories.\r\nSecondly, the new permanent members should have \r\nthe same prerogatives and privileges as those of the \r\ncurrent permanent members, including the veto.\r\nThirdly, additional seats in an expanded Council \r\nshould include permanent members from Africa, Asia, \r\nLatin America and the Caribbean region as well as from \r\nthe Western European and other States. There should \r\nbe additional non-permanent seats from Africa, Asia, \r\nthe Eastern European Group, Latin America and the \r\nCaribbean region, as well as one non-permanent seat \r\nfor small island developing States across all regions. \r\nFurther, regional groups should coordinate to ensure \r\nthat there is regular representation for small developing \r\nStates in the non-permanent category.\r\nFourthly, the number of the Council’s members \r\nshould be expanded to the mid-twenties, and it should \r\nadapt its working methods so as to increase the \r\ninvolvement of States not members of the Council in its \r\nwork as appropriate, enhance its accountability to the \r\nmembership and increase the transparency of its work.\r\nFifthly, the General Assembly’s role as the chief \r\ndeliberative policy-making and representative organ \r\nof the United Nations must be respected in both \r\nletter and spirit. It is the considered view of the L.69 \r\ngroup that intergovernmental negotiations should be \r\nstarted immediately with the aim of formalizing the \r\nconvergences that I have just articulated.\r\nIn closing, allow me to recall paragraph 30 of the \r\nMillennium Declaration (resolution 55/2), in which \r\nworld leaders resolved, inter alia, to intensify their \r\nefforts to achieve a comprehensive reform of the \r\nSecurity Council in all its aspects. I would also like \r\nto specifically highlight paragraph 153 of the 2005 \r\nWorld Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1), in which \r\nleaders further resolved to support early reform of \r\nthe Security Council as an essential element of their \r\noverall efforts to reform the United Nations in order \r\nto make it more broadly representative, efficient and \r\ntransparent and thus further enhance its effectiveness \r\nand the legitimacy and implementation of its decisions.\r\nThe L.69 Group remains committed to playing its \r\npart in ensuring that that comprehensive reform is not \r\nleft to future generations.\r\nMr. Ragaglini (Italy): I thank you, Mr. President, \r\nfor convening today’s debate, which is helping us to \r\nfocus concretely on two Security Council-related issues: \r\nthe annual report (A/67/2) and the reform process.\r\nDuring the period covered by the report, the \r\nCouncil dealt with several regional crises in Africa, \r\nparticularly those in Mali and Guinea-Bissau, following \r\nmilitary coups, and that in the Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo, resulting from the violence wrought by the \r\nMouvement du 23 mars. It also addressed the situation \r\nin the Middle East, especially in Syria and Yemen, and \r\nthe situations in Asia, namely, Afghanistan, Myanmar \r\nand Timor-Leste. Considerable time was also devoted \r\nto thematic and general issues, such as the rule of law, \r\npeacebuilding, conflict prevention, non-proliferation \r\nand cooperation with regional organizations, especially \r\nthe African Union.\r\nIn that context, we appreciate the quality of the \r\nreport and its introduction prepared by our Colombian \r\ncolleague, Ambassador Néstor Osorio, and the \r\nextensive efforts to make it more complete and detailed. \r\nWe encourage the Security Council to continue in that \r\ndirection as a way to improve its relationship with the \r\nGeneral Assembly and to promote a greater involvement \r\nof the membership in its proceedings.\r\nOn the subject of Security Council reform, let \r\nme start by thanking you, Mr. President, on behalf \r\nof the Uniting for Consensus group, for your letter \r\nof 9 November informing us of the reappointment of \r\nAmbassador Tanin as chair of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations. As the letter duly notes, there are, within \r\nthe membership, “various concerns and divergent \r\npoints of view on the different aspects of this complex \r\nand sensitive matter”. In addition, your letter rightly \r\npoints out that “predictability and full transparency \r\nremain essential ingredients in the ongoing process.” \r\nThe letter concludes by informing us of your intention \r\nto work closely with the chair.\r\nWe could not agree more. We are convinced that \r\nthe reform of the Security Council is one of the most \r\nsensitive and divisive topics at the United Nations, since \r\nit touches on the strategic interests of all 193 Member \r\nStates. We are also convinced that transparency and \r\npredictability are needed in order to build confidence \r\namong Member States. That is why we consider the \r\n8 12-59129\r\nA/67/PV.38\r\nTurning now to the process, the move from a \r\nlong-standing working group to intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations stemmed from decision 62/557, which \r\nwas adopted by consensus in 2008. That decision \r\nstates clearly that the negotiations must be based \r\non the proposals of Member States. It adds that the \r\nfive key issues or negotiables should be dealt with \r\nin a comprehensive way, and thus clearly rejects any \r\npiecemeal approach. That decision must be upheld. Any \r\nattempt to force through a piecemeal approach is bound \r\nto fail. The same fate is reserved for proposals that \r\nare not mandated by or do not originate from Member \r\nStates.\r\nIt is clear that Security Council reform is still a \r\nvery sensitive matter on which there are deep concerns \r\nand points of divergence within the membership. After \r\nalmost 20 years of failed attempts to impose contrasting \r\nvisions on one another, we all need to work together to \r\nforge a genuine compromise that can gain the widest \r\npolitical support — hence the crucial role of the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly and the chair of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations as confidence-builders \r\nwho can bring the players to the same table. Yet, \r\naccording to decision 62/557, the determination as to \r\nwhich card to play must remain in the hands of the \r\nMember States.\r\nOne constructive way to commence the session \r\nwould be to have the chair consult with Member States \r\nto agree on a predictable and transparent calendar of \r\nwork. That approach proved to be useful last year, \r\nand we encourage you, Sir, and Ambassador Tanin to \r\nrepeat that scheme. Any proposal that has not been \r\nagreed upon or mandated by the Member States risks \r\nsending us back to square one. That is not what we \r\nwant. It would also not encourage concrete progress in \r\nthe reform process.\r\nAlong those lines, Mr. President, you can count \r\non the Uniting for Consensus group’s support and \r\nf lexibility.\r\nMr. Rybakov (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): We are \r\ngrateful to the Security Council for having prepared \r\nthe report on its work over the past year (A/67/2). \r\nThe delegation of Belarus has studied the document \r\ncarefully and takes note of its comprehensive and \r\ninformative nature. We support the point of view that the \r\nreport would be of even greater value for delegations, \r\nparticularly those that are not Council members, if it \r\ncontained elements analysing the situations in various \r\nregions of the world. In our view, that could have been \r\nPresident of the General Assembly to be the ultimate \r\nand impartial guarantor of the entire process.\r\nLet me briefly summarize the philosophy underlying \r\nthe Uniting for Consensus group’s proposal. In that \r\nconnection, I wish to recall that our group is the only \r\none that entered the intergovernmental negotiations \r\nwith some fresh ideas. It was a sign of f lexibility that \r\nwas never reciprocated.\r\nThe three principles of our platform are all based on \r\nthe importance of an elected Security Council and on \r\ndecision 62/557. First, regular elections are imperative \r\nin order to ensure an accountable, accessible Security \r\nCouncil in which membership is earned as a privileged \r\nresponsibility and not granted as a permanent right \r\nto individual countries in fulfilment of their national \r\naspirations; secondly, the election process makes the \r\nCouncil f lexible and adaptable to the constant changes \r\nin the world’s political and economic landscape; \r\nthirdly, the electoral system makes the Security \r\nCouncil more representative. Permanent membership, \r\nwith no provision for periodic endorsement from the \r\nwider membership, has no representative character \r\nwhatsoever.\r\nIn line with those principles, the Uniting for \r\nConsensus group has proposed a new category of \r\nseats with longer terms of up to six years, as well as \r\nan increase in the number of regular non-permanent \r\nmembers. Our proposal also provides a quota for the \r\nrepresentation of small States in the Security Council.\r\nWe are also convinced there is a need to correct the \r\nunderrepresentation of Africa, so our proposal offers \r\na viable compromise that addresses that continent’s \r\nparticularities. Some of the specifics include Charter \r\nrecognition, size and allocation of new seats; for \r\nexample, under the proposal, 40 per cent of the new \r\nseats, in particular those with longer terms, would go to \r\nAfrica. We suggest that the African representatives be \r\nselected or rotated by the African Union or the Group of \r\nAfrican States, after which the slate would be submitted \r\nto the General Assembly for election. In that way, the \r\nambitions of a continent, rather than the aspirations of \r\nindividual Member States, would be recognized.\r\nFinally, we feel that the working methods should be \r\nimproved through greater openness and transparency, \r\nthat the Security Council should be more accountable \r\nto the General Assembly — and an elected Council \r\nwould be the best guarantee in that respect — and that \r\nthe veto should be limited, if not abolished.\r\n12-59129 9\r\nA/67/PV.38\r\nMaintaining the balance of the entire United \r\nNations system is of the utmost importance. We \r\ntherefore find inadmissible the unfounded interference \r\nby the Security Council in the areas of competence \r\nof the General Assembly, the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil and the Human Rights Council.\r\nMr. Charles (Trinidad and Tobago), Vice-President, \r\ntook the Chair.\r\nWe see a need to have non-Council members be \r\ninvolved to a greater degree when decisions are taken \r\naffecting their interests, for the expansion of the practice \r\nof holding open meetings and for the organization of \r\nclose interaction between the Sanctions Committees \r\nand the countries affected by sanctions.\r\nToday, we are faced with the important objectives \r\nof reforming the United Nations as a whole and \r\nthe Security Council in particular. Peace and the \r\ninternational order are changing at a dizzying pace. We \r\nsimply have no moral right to waste yet another year in \r\na negotiating process that is taking us nowhere. In that \r\nregard, Belarus calls on all parties to the negotiating \r\nprocess to demonstrate political will and readiness to \r\ncompromise, which are crucial for the adoptions of the \r\ndecisions needed to reform the Security Council and \r\nstrengthen the Organization as a whole.\r\nMrs. DiCarlo (United States of America): I \r\nwould like to thank the Security Council President, \r\nAmbassador Hardeep Singh Puri, for his presentation \r\nof the Council’s annual report to the General Assembly \r\n(A/67/2), and Ambassador Néstor Osorio and the \r\nColombian delegation for their preparation of the \r\nintroduction to the report during their presidency of the \r\nSecurity Council in July.\r\nThe annual report provides all Member States with \r\na transparent and comprehensive review of the Security \r\nCouncil’s intensive work. We hope that the report \r\ncontinues to facilitate the exchange of information and \r\nenhance cooperation between the two coequal principal \r\norgans of the United Nations. The United States takes \r\nseriously the importance of making sure that all Member \r\nStates are informed of and appropriately involved in the \r\nCouncil’s work. In that regard, we are pleased to see \r\nthat the Council held 222 formal meetings, of which \r\n205 were public meetings, from August 2011 to July \r\n2012. The United States is also committed to improving \r\nthe working methods of the Council, and we continue \r\nto encourage increased interaction between Member \r\nachieved by moving the elements of analysis into the \r\nmonthly report documents that are prepared by the \r\ndelegations presiding over the Security Council.\r\nIn the past year we have seen how important the \r\nrole of the Security Council is in today’s system of \r\ninternational relations. Belarus favours the maintenance \r\nand strengthening of that status. We consider the \r\nCouncil to be the major element in the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security. Unquestionably, in \r\norder to remain the cornerstone of the existing system, \r\nthe Council must act in keeping with today’s realities. \r\nIn that context, we see no alternative but to reform that \r\nbody, which was established by the Charter. Moreover, \r\nthat reform must be based on a consensus approach and \r\npromote the enhancement of the Council’s effectiveness. \r\nMaking comprehensive changes to the Council \r\nbased on the five negotiables, as set forth in decision \r\n62/557, is one of the key steps to transforming the \r\nUnited Nations into an effective mechanism for \r\nresponding efficiently to crisis situations. We cannot \r\nignore the fact that negotiations on the question of \r\nSecurity Council reform have been going on for more \r\nthan 20 years. The parties to the negotiating process \r\nhave demonstrated determination and the seriousness \r\nof their intention to achieve a final result. However, \r\nno delegation could claim that those negotiations have \r\nproduced any substantive outcome to date.\r\nTo achieve results, we need to demonstrate political \r\nwill and f lexibility. At the same time, we oppose hasty \r\nattempts to put to a vote documents that have not been \r\nstudied in detail or gained broad support from States, or \r\nthat may have a negative impact on future negotiations.\r\nWe believe that reform of the Security Council \r\nmust lead to a more balanced and just apportionment \r\nof powers. We support an expansion in the number of \r\nseats in the Council in order to give all regional groups \r\nadditional seats on the Council. We take note of the \r\nunderrepresentation of the Eastern European Group \r\namong the non-permanent members of the Security \r\nCouncil and reaffirm our stated position on enhancing \r\nthe representation of that Group among the permanent \r\nmembers of the Council.\r\nWe believe it is necessary to continue enhancing \r\nthe transparency of the activity of the Security Council. \r\nWe welcome the expansion of the practice of holding \r\nopen debates and presidential briefings, including at \r\nthe end of term. We believe that it would be useful to \r\ncontinue the development of that practice.\r\n10 12-59129\r\nA/67/PV.38\r\nStates and the Council’s Informal Working Group on \r\nDocumentation and Other Procedural Questions.\r\nThe Security Council first met in January 1946, \r\nunder Australia’s presidency. At that time, former \r\nSecretary of State and first United States Ambassador \r\nto the United Nations, Edward Stettinius, Jr., said that \r\nthe General Assembly, inter alia, was responsible for \r\nbuilding the kind of world in which lasting peace will \r\nbe possible, and that the Security Council must see to it \r\nthat the peace is kept. Nearly 67 years later, the members \r\nof the Council remain dedicated to that mission.\r\nAs the world’s principal body for dealing with \r\nglobal security cooperation, the Council needs to \r\nreflect the realities of the new century. We recognize \r\nthat various groups of Member States have presented \r\nproposals to add both permanent and non-permanent \r\nmembers, and also to add veto-wielding members. The \r\nUnited States is open in principle to a modest expansion \r\nof both permanent and non-permanent members, \r\nbut we strongly believe that any consideration of an \r\nexpansion of permanent members must be country-\r\nspecific in nature. Moreover, the United States is not \r\nopen to an enlargement of the Security Council that \r\nchanges the current veto structure. Given that up to \r\nnow no proposal has enjoyed consensus among us in \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform, we must continue to roll up our sleeves and \r\ndiscuss the way forward together.\r\nTo that end, the United States welcomes the \r\ncontinuation of the intergovernmental negotiations at \r\nthis session of the General Assembly. The United States \r\ncontinues to view those negotiations as the best forum to \r\nbuild a path toward a reformed Security Council. In our \r\nlast round of intergovernmental negotiations in July, the \r\nUnited States indicated that the way to find agreement \r\nis not through ultimatums, but through a step-by-step \r\napproach. We welcome Ambassador Tanin’s continued \r\nrole as chair of the negotiation process and trust that he \r\nwill guide us on such a path. We assure him of our full \r\ncooperation.\r\nIt remains essential that we work together through \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations to overcome our \r\ndifferences and find a comprehensive solution that \r\naddresses the common aspirations of Member States. \r\nWe very much look forward to continuing that dialogue \r\nwith all Members.\r\nMr. Benmehidi (Algeria): I have the honour to \r\npresent the position of Africa on behalf of the Committee \r\nof 10 of the African Union (AU) on the reform of the \r\nSecurity Council. I would like to thank the President \r\nfor having convened this debate on agenda item 117. \r\nAt the outset, allow me congratulate Ambassador \r\nZahir Tanin upon his reappointment as chair of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations and to express our \r\nappreciation for his efforts during past sessions.\r\nI would like to reiterate the commitment of the \r\nmember States of the African Union to this very \r\nimportant issue and state that we look forward to building \r\non the progress made during the sixty-sixth session on \r\nthe basis of General Assembly decision 65/554.\r\nWe are heartened that during the general debate of \r\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session, many \r\nheads of State and Government and heads of delegation \r\nreaffirmed the need to reform the Security Council in \r\norder to make it more representative, democratic and \r\nlegitimate. We must all therefore continue to seek \r\nthe goal of reaching an early agreement on a reform \r\nmodel that takes into account the core values of the \r\nUnited Nations, namely, inclusiveness, democracy, \r\naccountability, equality and transparency.\r\nIt is becoming increasingly clear that after nearly \r\ntwo decades of debate, we seem to be gradually \r\napproaching a point where the United Nations will \r\nlose credibility if we fail to generate the political will \r\nnecessary to make progress on this very crucial issue. \r\nWe continue to urge Member States to be f lexible in \r\nour common pursuit of a global governance system \r\nthat is more representative, more democratic and more \r\ntransparent.\r\nAfrica continues to engage in the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations with an open-door policy, aiming at \r\ncorrecting the historical injustice suffered by being the \r\nonly continent not represented in the Security Council’s \r\npermanent-member category and underrepresented in \r\nthe non-permanent category. The Council remains at the \r\ncentre of global governance in maintaining international \r\npeace and security. The 2005 World Summit Outcome \r\n(resolution 60/1) expressed the need to enhance the \r\nCouncil’s representativeness, accountability and \r\neffectiveness and the legitimacy of its decisions, as \r\nwell as the democratic nature of its decision-making \r\nprocess. Therefore, correcting the lingering historical \r\ninjustice done to the continent becomes imperative and \r\ncompelling.\r\nTo that end, we urge the wider United Nations \r\nmembership to work with Africa to urgently address \r\n12-59129 11\r\nA/67/PV.38\r\nof his proposed concise document. Thirdly, we need \r\nthe added value of the proposed high-level meeting, \r\nbecause we have not reached any agreement since \r\nthe 2005 World Summit, when heads of State and \r\nGovernment called for an early reform of the Security \r\nCouncil. In our view, it will therefore be more useful \r\nfor the facilitator to provide further clarifications on \r\nhis recommendations.\r\nCorrecting the present imbalance in the \r\ncomposition of the Council with a view to making it \r\ninto a more legitimate organ, primarily responsible for \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security, \r\nremains the collective responsibility of all Member \r\nStates. We hope that this session will build on the \r\nprogress made during the last session and will increase \r\nthe pace for a more frank and lively debate, one that \r\nwill be more f lexible, compromising and decisive and \r\nwill generate the necessary political will that would \r\nlead to a speedy reform of the Security Council, in \r\naccordance with the vision of our leaders at the 2005 \r\nWorld Summit.\r\nAllow me to conclude by thanking the President of \r\nthe Security Council, Ambassador Hardeep Singh Puri, \r\nPermanent Representative of India, for his presentation \r\nof the Council’s annual report to the General Assembly \r\n(A/67/2), covering the activities of the Council for the \r\nperiod from 1 August 2011 to 31 July 2012. We look \r\nforward to an enhanced relationship between the \r\nCouncil and the General Assembly and improvement in \r\nthe Council’s working methods.\r\nMrs. Ribeiro Viotti (Brazil): We very much value \r\nthe opportunity to discuss in the wider setting of the \r\nGeneral Assembly the recent work of the Security \r\nCouncil and to reflect on ideas to make that body more \r\nrepresentative, democratic and transparent. \r\nBrazil aligns itself with the statement delivered \r\nearlier by Ambassador Raymond Wolfe, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Jamaica, on behalf of the group \r\nof countries that sponsored draft resolution \r\nA/61/L.69/Rev.1. \r\nWe are glad to note that the annual report of \r\nthe Security Council (A/67/2) highlights some of \r\nthe efforts to increase the transparency of Council \r\nactivities. Open debates, consultations with the troop- \r\nand police-contributing countries, field missions and \r\noutreach to country-specific configurations of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission are all important attempts \r\nthis injustice. We are committed to building alliances \r\nin support of the African common position with diverse \r\ninterest groups and Member States engaged in the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations, in conformity with \r\nthe mandate of the Committee of 10, with a view to \r\nachieving an early reform of the Security Council. In \r\nthat pursuit, member States of the African Union were \r\ncalled upon to include the issue of Security Council \r\nreform among the priorities of their foreign policies.\r\nAfrica’s position is a continental aspiration, which \r\nwe believe all Member States and other stakeholders are \r\nnow very familiar with. In that regard, it is important \r\nto recall that in 1945, when the United Nations was \r\nformed, most of Africa was not represented, and \r\nwhen the first reform took place in 1963, Africa was \r\nrepresented but at the time not considered for inclusion \r\nin the permanent category. Circumstances have changed \r\nsince then, and it is merely simple justice for Africa \r\nto be fully represented in all decision-making organs \r\nof the United Nations, particularly in the Security \r\nCouncil. Full representation of Africa in the Security \r\nCouncil, according to the Ezulwini Consensus and \r\nthe Sirte Declaration, means, first, acquiring no fewer \r\nthan two permanent seats, with all the prerogatives and \r\nprivileges of permanent membership, including the \r\nright of veto if it continues to exist. Secondly, we are \r\nclaiming five non-permanent seats.\r\nIn the spirit of our commitment to address the \r\nissue of equitable representation on and increase in \r\nthe membership of the Security Council and other \r\nrelated matters, we must now seek agreement on how \r\nto move forward with revision 3 of the facilitator’s \r\ncompiled text. Various suggestions have been made \r\nabout how to proceed with the document. While the \r\nchair of the intergovernmental negotiation process \r\nhad, inter alia, called for the document to be edited, \r\nsome Member States continue to call for it to be \r\nstreamlined or shortened and/or to merge the positions. \r\nMore recently, the facilitator, in his letter of 25 July \r\n2012, recommended, among other things, the need for \r\ngenuine give-and-take based on a concise document \r\nto be drafted by him and the holding of a high-level \r\nmeeting on Security Council reform to assess the state \r\nof play and propose ways to keep the process moving \r\nforward. \r\nThus there is, first, a need for a general agreement \r\non what to do with the text. We have not yet reached \r\nthat agreement. Secondly, we need further clarification \r\nfrom the facilitator regarding the content and scope \r\n12 12-59129\r\nA/67/PV.38\r\nMr. Kim Sook (Republic of Korea): At the outset, \r\nI would like to thank the President for convening this \r\nimportant meeting of the General Assembly regarding \r\nthe annual report of the Security Council (A/67/2) \r\nand the issue of Security Council reform. Allow me \r\nto extend my deepest appreciation to the membership \r\nof the General Assembly, which rendered its valuable \r\nsupport to the candidature of the Republic of Korea for \r\na non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the \r\nterm 2013 and 2014.\r\nThe Security Council was actively engaged in \r\ntackling a great number of challenges all around the \r\nworld during the reporting period. It remained the most \r\nrelied-upon organ for the international community \r\nin the field of international peace and security. The \r\nCouncil’s vigorous engagement was indispensable \r\nin enhancing peace and moving the political process \r\nforward in such places as Somalia, the Sudan and South \r\nSudan, and Timor-Leste.\r\nWe have seen encouraging developments in \r\nSomalia, where the Council’s support for the transition \r\nprocess, in cooperation with the African Union, has laid \r\nsolid groundwork for the establishment of a legitimate \r\nGovernment.\r\nThe firm action by the Council, as envisaged in its \r\nunanimously adopted resolution 2046 (2012), countered \r\nthe escalation of violence between the Sudan and South \r\nSudan and enabled the negotiations on unresolved issues \r\nto make progress. The Republic of Korea, for its part, \r\nintends to contribute to stability and reconstruction \r\nin the region by sending a 300-member engineering \r\ncorps to the United Nations Mission in South Sudan in \r\ncoming months.\r\nIn Timor-Leste, the active involvement of the \r\nUnited Nations in the country’s efforts to achieve peace \r\nand stability since 1999 is now drawing to a successful \r\nend. We believe that such successful engagement by the \r\ninternational community in the form of United Nations \r\npeacekeeping operations — a peace investment that \r\npays off, with a clear-cut exit — needs to be emulated.\r\nThe Republic of Korea also appreciates the work \r\nof the Security Council in managing the developments \r\nduring the course of the Arab Spring in countries \r\nranging from Libya to Yemen. We note the adoption of \r\nthe Council resolutions regarding Libya, including 2009 \r\n(2011) and 2016 (2011), which offer a political basis for \r\nimproving the security situation in the country. We also \r\nto promote inclusiveness and enhance the effectiveness \r\nof the Council’s decisions.\r\nHowever, a more representative Security Council, \r\naligned with current political realities, will be \r\nachieved only through a real reform of its current \r\nstructure. That goal has been consistently advocated \r\nby a large majority of Member States, as the debates \r\non the subject held during the Assembly’s last session \r\nonce again demonstrated. A large majority has also \r\nexpressed support for an expansion of the Council in \r\nboth categories of membership and for improvement of \r\nits methods of work. \r\nTogether with its partners in the Group of Four and \r\nthe L.69 group, Brazil has been a staunch supporter \r\nof the intergovernmental negotiations since their \r\ninception. We reiterate our commitment to that process. \r\nThe time has come, however, to begin a new phase in \r\nour talks. The new phase should be result-oriented and \r\ncharacterized by real and substantive negotiations. \r\nFor that to happen, it is essential that a negotiating \r\ndocument with fewer options and a focus on ideas that \r\nhave garnered broad support from Member States be \r\nprepared. A concise negotiating document is pivotal to \r\nkick-start the process and to lead us to tangible results. \r\nIn his letter dated 25 July the chair of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations, Ambassador Zahir \r\nTanin, presented his assessment of the work undertaken \r\nduring the last General Assembly session and conveyed \r\nrecommendations that, in Brazil’s view, constitute \r\na sound basis for our future work. We commend him \r\nfor that initiative. The letter provides us with a clear \r\nset of options that may allow us to move forward and \r\nseek tangible progress. In line with his proposals, we \r\nare ready to enter into real negotiations with a view to \r\nachieving a meaningful reform.\r\nProgress in Security Council reform is long overdue. \r\nIt is our hope that the intergovernmental negotiations \r\nwill be resumed soon, building on the progress achieved \r\nso far, including the inputs offered by Member States \r\nand the recommendations presented by the chair. In this \r\nregard, we welcome the letter by the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly  dated 9 November, in which he was \r\nreappointed Ambassador Tanin to continue to chair the \r\nnegotiations in the plenary of the General Assembly. \r\nBrazil is ready to cooperate with Mr. Tanin in his work.\r\nAllow me to conclude by thanking the President \r\nfor his leadership of the General Assembly during the \r\ncurrent session.\r\n12-59129 13\r\nA/67/PV.38\r\n1718 (2006) concerning the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea, which includes the designation of \r\nadditional entities subject to sanctions measures in May \r\n2012.\r\nOn international cooperation for non-proliferation, \r\nthe Republic of Korea appreciates the growing role of \r\nthe Security Council Committee established pursuant \r\nto resolution 1540 (2004), as shown in Council \r\nresolution 2055 (2012). We also welcome the presidential \r\nstatement on nuclear security (S/PRST/2012/14), in \r\nApril.\r\nThe Republic of Korea also values the work of the \r\nSecurity Council on thematic and cross-cutting issues. \r\nWe welcome the Council’s increasing engagement \r\nin issues concerning women and peace and security, \r\nchildren and armed conflict, and post-conflict \r\npeacebuilding. We believe that the Council should make \r\ngreater efforts in identifying the linkages between \r\nthe thematic issues and country-specific situations, \r\nkeeping the issues more focused and action-oriented so \r\nas to make a substantial contribution to improving the \r\nsituation on the ground.\r\nDuring the reporting period, the Council has \r\nundertaken notable efforts to enhance the participation \r\nof the wider membership in its work, including by \r\nincreasing the number of public meetings and providing \r\nmonthly briefings by its President. It should continue \r\nto strengthen such efforts towards openness and \r\ntransparency.\r\nThe Council should also work on expanding its \r\nrelationships and enhancing cooperation with regional \r\nand subregional organizations. Cooperation with \r\nregional institutions has become all the more essential \r\nfor finding appropriate solutions to crises and conflicts \r\nand for making optimal use of resources and capacities.\r\nOn the issue of Security Council reform, the \r\nRepublic of Korea believes that the only plausible way \r\nto bring about a more representative, accountable, \r\ndemocratic and effective Council is through holding \r\nperiodic elections. Periodic elections are essential \r\nin ensuring the democratic principle, which lies at \r\nthe heart of the legitimacy of reforming the Council. \r\nReform should be firmly based on a membership-\r\ndriven and comprehensive approach, as stipulated in \r\ndecision 62/557. We look forward to the stewardship of \r\nAmbassador Tanin as chair of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on Security Council reform so that we can \r\nwelcome resolutions 2014 (2011) and 2051 (2012), on \r\nthe political transition in Yemen.\r\nSyria remains the biggest peace and security \r\nchallenge of the day. The Republic of Korea is deeply \r\nconcerned about the mass killings of civilians and \r\ngross violations of human rights in Syria. We commend \r\nthe efforts of the Joint Special Envoy of the United \r\nNations and the League of Arab States for Syria \r\nand the Security Council-mandated United Nations \r\nSupervision Mission in the Syrian Arab Republic with \r\na view to the implementation of the six-point proposal \r\nduring the reporting period. We truly hope the Council \r\nwill be able to build unity and act decisively on this \r\ntragic and long-standing issue, which has significant \r\nrepercussions for regional security.\r\nRegarding the situation in the Middle East, \r\nincluding the Palestinian question, the Republic of \r\nKorea fully supports the two-State solution, a vision \r\nin which Israel and Palestine live side by side in peace \r\nand prosperity. We hope that a peaceful, negotiated \r\nresolution to the matter will be reached in the near \r\nfuture with the support of the international community.\r\nAmong other concerns before the international \r\ncommunity are the challenges to the constitutional \r\norder in democracy. We are worried about the military \r\ncoups that occurred in Mali and Guinea-Bissau earlier \r\nthis year and welcome the firm actions by the Security \r\nCouncil, as shown in its resolutions 2056 (2012) and \r\n2048 (2012), respectively. It is also worrying that the \r\nactivities of armed elements destabilize the peace and \r\nstability in fragile regions, with the Mouvement du 23 \r\nmars — the M-23 — in the eastern part of the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo, the Lord’s Resistance Army in \r\nthe Central African region and armed rebel groups in \r\nnorthern Mali being the cases in point. We hope the \r\nSecurity Council will remain firm and vigilant in \r\nresponding to such destabilizing forces.\r\nOn the issue of non-proliferation, the Republic \r\nof Korea welcomes and supports the Council’s swift \r\nadoption of the presidential statement on North \r\nKorea’s launch of a long-range missile in April 2012 \r\n(S/PRST/2012/13). We particularly note that the \r\nstatement strongly condemned the launch, underscored \r\nthat it was a serious violation of Security Council \r\nresolutions 1718 (2006) and 1874 (2009), and expressed \r\nthe Council’s determination to take action accordingly \r\nin the event of a further launch or nuclear test by North \r\nKorea. We also take note of the work of the Security \r\nCouncil Committee established pursuant to resolution \r\n14 12-59129\r\nA/67/PV.38\r\ntoday’s world, to more closely adapt to new challenges \r\nwhile remaining in a position to fully shoulder its \r\nresponsibilities given the crises now threatening \r\ninternational peace and security, the Security Council \r\nmust undergo an ambitious reform. \r\nThe process of intergovernmental negotiations \r\nheaded by Ambassador Tanin has allowed us to \r\nmake progress in our thinking. The eighth round of \r\nnegotiations has made our debates more dynamic with \r\nrespect to the initiatives presented by Member States or \r\ngroups of Member States. That impetus must not be lost; \r\nthe path charted by the facilitator should be explored \r\nthrough a collective effort of the Member States. In that \r\nspirit, France welcomes the decision of the President of \r\nthe General Assembly to reappoint Ambassador Tanin \r\nas facilitator. We will need to work on the basis of the \r\nlatest proposals.\r\nFrance, for its part, supports the enlargement of \r\nthe Security Council in both categories of membership. \r\nOur demands have not changed — reform of the \r\nCouncil must take into account the emergence of new \r\nPowers that have both the will and the capability to \r\nshoulder responsibility for a permanent presence in the \r\nCouncil and that, in accordance with the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, are in a position to make a significant \r\ncontribution to the Council’s action in the maintenance \r\nof international peace and security. It is in that context \r\nthat France supports a strengthened presence of African \r\ncountries, including among the permanent members, as \r\nwell as the candidacies of Germany, Brazil, Japan and \r\nIndia for permanent seats. \r\nThe reform of the Security Council must not be \r\nrelegated to the background of our priorities. With \r\nthe active and much-appreciated assistance of the \r\nfacilitator, Ambassador Tanin, it is in the Assembly \r\nPresident’s power to provide a decisive impetus to the \r\ndiscussions. France, like numerous other States in the \r\nGeneral Assembly, stands ready to work actively to \r\nresolve impasses. France will make its contribution and \r\nprovide its support as we continue our work. \r\nMr. AlJarallah (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): At \r\nthe outset, my country’s delegation extends with great \r\npleasure its thanks and appreciation to the President \r\nof the Security Council for the current month, the \r\nPermanent Representative of India, for the report of \r\nthe Security Council to the General Assembly (A/67/2), \r\nas well as for the information on the activities of the \r\nSecurity Council for the past year, which indicates a \r\nnoticeable increase in the Council’s  workload. We \r\nachieve concrete progress during the current session of \r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nThe Republic of Korea, as a non-permanent member \r\nof the Security Council for 2013-2014, will spare \r\nno efforts in striving to enhance the accountability, \r\ntransparency and efficiency of the Council.\r\nMr. Visconti (France) (spoke in French): Allow me \r\nfirst to express my appreciation for the introductory \r\nstatement of the President of the Security Council, \r\nAmbassador Hardeep Singh Puri, and for his presentation \r\nof the annual report of the Security Council (A/67/2). I \r\nwould also like to thank the Permanent Representative \r\nof Colombia, who, as Council President in July, prepared \r\nthat important report to the General Assembly. With \r\nhis team, he has seen to it that the report reflects the \r\nCouncil’s work in a complete and transparent manner. I \r\nalso wish to thank the Secretariat, which supported that \r\nprocess. I take this opportunity to take note of the high \r\nquality of the Council’s new website, which contains \r\nupdated information in all languages on the activity of \r\nthe Security Council. That is also progress that benefits \r\nthe entire Organization.\r\nThe growing quality of the Council’s reports to \r\nthe Assembly is a demonstration of the continuing \r\nimprovement of Council’s working methods, to the \r\nbenefit of all States Members of our Organization. \r\nIn that context, France appreciates the work of the \r\nCouncil’s Informal Working Group on Documentation \r\nand Other Procedural Questions, which this year, under \r\nthe guidance of the Ambassador of Portugal, whom I \r\ncongratulate here, has made numerous improvements \r\npossible. In particular, we support the thinking on \r\ngenuine publicity for the debates, especially on \r\nissues of general interest, on dialogue with the troop-\r\ncontributing countries and on a better taking into \r\naccount of the fight against impunity in the Council’s \r\nwork.\r\nThe upcoming public debate on working methods \r\nunder the Indian presidency of the Council will be \r\nan opportunity to exchange views with all States on \r\nthe topic. On that occasion France will come back to \r\nthe idea of the Council’s permanent members jointly \r\nrenouncing the use of the veto when the Council is \r\nseized with mass crimes and atrocities. \r\nBeyond the improvement of its working methods, \r\nwe know that reform of the Council’s working methods \r\nis necessary. Many of us here have been saying that \r\nfor 20 years now. To further reflect the reality of \r\n12-59129 15\r\nA/67/PV.38\r\nCouncil, in order to curb the tendency to encroach on \r\ntheir areas of competence. The Council’s role must be \r\nconfined to the fulfilment of its functions as mandated \r\nby the Charter of the United Nations, in other words, \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nSecondly, any ideas for Security Council reform \r\nmust stem from the keen interests of all Members, in \r\norder to make the Council more representative of the \r\nentire membership of the United Nations and to reflect \r\ncurrent international realities, which have changed so \r\nmuch since the Organization was established in 1945.\r\nThirdly, it is crucial that we work on improving the \r\nCouncil’s methods and ways of working, making them \r\nclearer and more transparent. This should include a list \r\nof formal and permanent working procedures aimed \r\nat improving and organizing the Council’s working \r\nmethods.\r\nFourthly, the right to the veto should be codified \r\nby regulating and limiting it through, for example, \r\nexcluding the possibility of a veto except on matters \r\nthat fall under Chapter VII of the Charter.\r\nFifthly, any expansion of the number of seats on the \r\nSecurity Council must allow smaller States increased \r\nopportunities for membership and participation in the \r\nCouncil’s work. It must not overlook the rights of Arab \r\nand Muslim States, in accordance with their number \r\nand importance and the contribution they make to \r\ndefending the purposes and principles of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations.\r\nThe rapidly increasing challenges that the \r\ninternational community is facing around the world \r\nshould make us all the more determined to strengthen \r\nand revitalize the role of the Security Council so as \r\nto make it more capable and effective in meeting \r\nand overcoming those challenges and to ensure that \r\nit functions in a more representative, transparent, \r\nimpartial and credible way.\r\nMr. Seger (Switzerland) (spoke in French): We \r\nthank the President for this opportunity to discuss the \r\nannual report of the Security Council (A/67/2). As we \r\nknow, it is the only occasion on which the General \r\nAssembly can assess the Council’s work in the area of \r\npeace and security.\r\nWe have before us a 275-page document that covers \r\nthe Security Council’s activities for the past year. We \r\nfirst wish to thank Colombia for its significant effort in \r\ncompiling the report and the Permanent Representative \r\nare also pleased to congratulate the friendly countries \r\nthat have been elected new members of the Council for \r\n2013 and 2014: Argentina, Australia, Luxembourg, the \r\nRepublic of Korea and Rwanda. \r\nWe emphasize our support for the statement \r\ndelivered by the representative of Egypt on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement. We welcome and appreciate \r\nAmbassador Tanin’s efforts in leading the work of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. We hope to see in the \r\ncurrent session tangible progress on the issue of Security \r\nCouncil reform and to realize the long-awaited historic \r\nachievement that meets the expectations of all of us to \r\nenergize the Council and improve its performance. \r\nIt is appropriate that the question of equitable \r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of the \r\nSecurity Council and related matters should be one of \r\nthe most important items on the Assembly’s agenda at \r\na time when there is an urgent need to take articulated, \r\ndecisive positions that contribute to pushing forward \r\nthe process of Security Council reform. Although there \r\nis a consensus among Member States on the principle of \r\nchange and reform, we nevertheless have not yet been \r\nable to agree on the substance of the needed changes. \r\nIn that context, we emphasize the importance of \r\nrequiring that any suggestions relating to the expansion \r\nand reform of the Security Council obtain general \r\napproval from all Member States. Over the 20 years \r\nthat have passed since the opening of negotiations \r\non expanding the membership of the Council and \r\nimproving its methods of work, numerous initiatives \r\nand ideas have been put forward. However, the way \r\nremains obstructed. Political will is required for a \r\nconvergence of views that might allow us to reach the \r\ndesired goals. Repeated challenges in the international \r\npolitical arena should drive us to exert more pressure \r\nto improve the course of negotiations and affirm the \r\nimportance of collective work.\r\nIn recent years, the State of Kuwait’s position on the \r\nprocess of reforming the Security Council has remained \r\nconsistent, based as it is on the five established points. \r\nFirst, Security Council reform must be in \r\naccordance with the general perception that the process \r\nof reforming and developing all United Nations bodies \r\nshould be continued with a view to greater integration \r\nand balance in the work of the Organization. Also, the \r\nprocess must focus on the role of the Security Council \r\nin relation to other United Nations bodies such as \r\nthe General Assembly and the Economic and Social \r\n16 12-59129\r\nA/67/PV.38\r\nof India for his capable presentation. In that regard, we \r\nwould like to encourage future Council Presidents to \r\nfurnish the principal author of the report with monthly \r\nanalytical assessments that can then provide input for \r\nexchanges between the Council and Member States as \r\na whole in the framework of the report’s preparation.\r\nThe President of the Council concluded his \r\nstatement by inviting us to make suggestions for \r\nimproving the report. I would be glad to respond to \r\nthat invitation, but after reading the report and having \r\ngone over my speech from last year, I must admit that \r\nI am somewhat in the position of Senator Cato, who \r\ncontinued to repeat the same message over and over \r\nin the Roman Senate with the famous words “Ceterum \r\ncenseo” — “Moreover, I think”.\r\nMoreover, I think, first, that in particular the link \r\nbetween the geographic and thematic contexts being \r\ndealt with could be strengthened. Such subjects as \r\nchildren in armed conflict, the protection of civilians, \r\nand women and peace and security are not abstract but \r\nare directly linked to specific places and regions.\r\nMy second Ceterum censeo refers to the lack \r\nof a systematic approach to certain cross-cutting \r\nissues. To cite one example, the Council’s protection \r\narchitecture presents opportunities for improvement. A \r\nstudy by the NGO Working Group on Women, Peace \r\nand Security — a kind of shadow report supported \r\nby Switzerland — demonstrates this shortcoming. \r\nThe study also shows that such subjects become \r\nless important especially at times when there is a \r\nquestion of rapid intervention at a moment of crisis or \r\ndeterioration — exactly when the risk of serious human \r\nrights violations is greatest.\r\nTo go back to the preparation of the report itself, \r\nwe are pleased to see that discussions of structure \r\nare included and are continuing, because the report \r\nconstitutes a vital element in the reform of the \r\nSecurity Council’s working methods. In that regard, \r\nwe particularly thank Portugal for its valuable work in \r\nchairing the Informal Working Group on Documentation \r\nand Other Procedural Questions. We are also pleased \r\nthat India is organizing an open debate on the Council’s \r\nworking methods on 26 November, and we urge all \r\nMember States to participate in those discussions. It \r\nwill provide an excellent opportunity for all of us to go \r\ninto those issues in depth and in more detail.\r\nThe report reflects a year that was particularly rich \r\nin events before the Security Council. As is always the \r\ncase, there are both positive and negative points. We \r\ncommend the Council’s work on the Sudan and South \r\nSudan, as well as resolution 2046 (2012), which made \r\nit possible to ensure regular monitoring of the situation \r\nthere and which is an example of good cooperation with \r\na regional organization. It is no exaggeration to say \r\nthat the Security Council contributed in a substantive \r\nmanner to avoiding an escalation of the conflict. \r\nIn the same way, after the coups d’état in Mali and \r\nGuinea-Bissau, the Council responded with one voice. \r\nIn the Sahel region, however, much remains to be done, \r\ngiven the great tension there, and we therefore encourage \r\nthe Council to continue to follow that situation very \r\nclosely and not to give priority to a military approach \r\nover a political one.\r\nIt is important to become involved at a preliminary \r\nstage of a conflict, and that is true for every region of the \r\nworld. If the Council can react early and preventively, it \r\nshould do so. Horizon-scanning is an excellent tool for \r\nthat purpose. The monthly survey by the Department of \r\nPolitical Affairs should be used systematically by every \r\npresidency of the Council.\r\nFinally, if a conflict continues to deteriorate, as in \r\nthe case of Syria, the Council, under the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, is obliged to act, particularly by halting \r\natrocities regardless of who is committing them. I recall \r\nour firm conviction that in a situation where there are \r\nallegations of mass atrocities, the permanent members \r\nof the Council should renounce their right to the veto. \r\nI congratulate France on being willing to do that on \r\ncondition that the others do the same. Here Switzerland \r\nholds to its belief that the perpetrators of such atrocities \r\nmust be brought to justice. That is why my country has \r\ntaken the initiative of sending a letter to the Council \r\nasking it to send the Syrian situation to the International \r\nCriminal Court, so that a Syrian criminal process that \r\nis independent, equitable and transparent process could \r\nbe quickly established. \r\nI hope that the Security Council will not \r\nmerely be listening to Member States’ suggestions \r\nand recommendations, but will also take their \r\nrecommendations seriously into account and modify \r\nits working methods as a result. I would be pleased, \r\nduring the presentation of the Council’s report in 2013, \r\nto be able to abandon my role of Cato to play that of \r\nGalileo Galilei and say of the Security Council eppur si \r\nmuove — that it has, in fact, moved.\r\n12-59129 17\r\nA/67/PV.38\r\nMr. Osorio (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): I would \r\nfirst like to discuss agenda item 30, on the annual report \r\nof the Security Council (A/67/2). I am grateful for the \r\nconvening of this meeting. I would also like to thank the \r\nAmbassador of India, Mr. Hardeep Singh Puri, for his \r\npresentation of the report to the Assembly. Likewise, \r\nwe express our thanks to all members of the Security \r\nCouncil for their valuable contribution and support \r\nin the task that fell to the delegation of Colombia of \r\npreparing part of the report before us. The Secretariat \r\nmade a substantive contribution, as always, so we thank \r\nthe staff as well.\r\nThe report gives an account of a complex period in \r\nthe international context, with some situations in which \r\ninternal and external factors limited Council action. \r\nThe loss of human life we had to face is regrettable \r\nand deplorable. Nonetheless, we acknowledge that in \r\nseveral cases many other lives were saved, including \r\nwhere whole peoples were protected and respect for and \r\ndefence of fundamental rights were promoted, while \r\ninstitutions were strengthened and civilians at risk \r\nwere protected in countries where peace, stability and \r\nconstitutional order were faltering.\r\nThe results during the reporting period show that \r\ncommunication and constructive deliberations are \r\nirreplaceable tools for the prevention and resolution \r\nof conflicts. We are pleased that the dialogue with \r\nheads of State and high-level representatives from \r\naround the world was f luent and active, thanks to their \r\nparticipation in high-level Council meetings, and about \r\nthe missions carried out by Council members so that \r\nthe destiny of regions such as the Horn of Africa and \r\nCentral Africa could be viewed with greater hope. The \r\nsame can be said of the progress in democratic stability \r\nin Côte d’Ivoire, Haiti and Timor-Leste, countries in \r\nwhich the United Nations will have to step up efforts \r\nto support their social development and institutional \r\nconsolidation.\r\nSimilarly, in our opinion, consultations and \r\nunderstandings within the Council and beyond allowed \r\nfor progress in situations such as that in Libya, \r\nwhich was able to begin the process of transforming \r\ninstitutions and ensuring a democratic future for \r\nits people. The international community will have \r\nto be attentive to supporting its requirements for \r\nstrengthening its national capacities, in keeping with \r\nits sovereign decisions.\r\nDialogue was also developed with regard \r\nto thematic issues that figure ever more on the \r\nagenda. Peacekeeping and peacebuilding, the rule \r\nof law, cooperation with regional and subregional \r\norganizations, conflict prevention, children and armed \r\nconflict, the protection of civilians, women and peace \r\nand security, and peacebuilding were matters that \r\nwe consider relevant in the work of the Council. In \r\nthis regard, we remain convinced that we should pay \r\nattention to the criteria for the inclusion, consideration \r\nand scope of those thematic issues so that only those \r\nproperly falling within the Council competence are \r\ndebated by it.\r\nAs I have already mentioned, the question of unity \r\nin the Council is one and the same as the raison d’être \r\nof the Council. Without unity, paralysis prevails. We \r\nhave seen how the lack of unity affects the resolution of \r\nimportant issues. Where progress has been made, it was \r\nthanks to unity, including when there were different \r\nopinions, which shows that this is the only way to \r\nmaintain and build international peace and security \r\nwhen they are threatened or violated. The Council must \r\nwork further in this area, in the sure knowledge that in \r\ndoing so it will be able to respond more robustly to the \r\nmatters on its agenda.\r\nThe question of perfecting the working methods \r\nof the Security Council is a topic we consider ever \r\nmore necessary. Relations between the Council and the \r\nGeneral Assembly and broadening their cooperation \r\nare of crucial importance not only because of the \r\nsignificance of the political universality that the \r\nAssembly represents but also because matters before \r\nthe Council would benefit from additional perspective \r\nfor their consideration and effective solution, which \r\nwould lead to greater transparency and a virtuous \r\ncycle that would benefit both Member States and the \r\nOrganization.\r\nSimilarly, based on our own experience, we deem it \r\nadvisable that opportunities be provided for an exchange \r\nof views between the membership of the Organization \r\nand the country to which falls the responsibility to draft \r\nthe Council’s annual report. Colombia, convinced of \r\nthe usefulness of such exchange, met on 30 July with \r\na large number of countries in a public gathering so as \r\nto hear their suggestions, observations and comments.\r\nThe subsidiary bodies and the groups of experts \r\nrequire more precise regulations. They frequently \r\nencounter difficulties as a result of differing \r\ninterpretations regarding applicable practices.\r\n18 12-59129\r\nA/67/PV.38\r\nUniting for Consensus group has acknowledged on \r\nseveral occasions that Africa has a legitimate aspiration \r\nto seek a more just representation in the Council. The \r\ngroup has also shown considerable f lexibility and has \r\nrepeatedly stated that it is open to accepting compromise \r\nsolutions. For that reason, following the discussion held \r\nover the past year in the intergovernmental negotiating \r\nprocess, the members of Uniting for Consensus are \r\nmoving forward with an internal discussion that seeks \r\nto consider and evaluate the comments made by various \r\ndelegations on our model for reform.\r\nOn the other hand, the composition and categories \r\nof membership are only some of the elements covered \r\nin decision 62/557, which is a package deal, to which \r\nwe attach the greatest importance. We therefore oppose \r\nattempts to prioritize one or several of those elements to \r\nthe detriment of others as part of initiatives that, while \r\nthey may have been inspired by self less motivations, \r\nrepresent in practice an abandonment of a previously \r\nreached consensus.\r\nWe believe that in the current circumstances, \r\nit would be a step in the right direction for Member \r\nStates to discuss and agree, under the guidance of the \r\nCoordinator, on a calendar of work that would allow \r\nus to make progress in the process in a clear and \r\ntransparent way. In our capacity as a member of Uniting \r\nfor Consensus, Colombia stands ready to participate \r\nfully in that process.\r\nMr. Wittig (Germany): I would like to join my \r\ncolleagues in thanking Ambassador Hardeep Singh \r\nPuri of India for having introduced the report of the \r\nSecurity Council (A/67/2) and Ambassador Néstor \r\nOsorio of Colombia and his team for having compiled \r\nthe report presented today. Having completed the same \r\ntask last year as Security Council President in July, I \r\ncan attest to the arduous work that it entails.\r\nOf the numerous issues on the Council’s agenda \r\nover the past year, the situation in Syria stands out. \r\nUnfortunately, it does so because of what the Council \r\ndid not do, rather than what it did. We deplore the \r\nCouncil’s failure to agree on an effective common \r\napproach. That has further aggravated the plight of \r\nthe Syrian people and it led many in the international \r\ncommunity and our respective peoples to ask whether \r\nthe Security Council in its current form is still able \r\nto live up to the responsibilities entrusted to it by the \r\nCharter of the United Nations.\r\nTo close this topic, I would suggest that the Council \r\ndeepen its dialogue with bodies of the system charged \r\nwith promoting education, science, culture, agriculture, \r\neducation, health and other concerns with a view to \r\nmaking its peacebuilding actions more coherent with \r\nthe efforts, programmes, plans and projects being \r\ncarried out by those bodies in the countries leaving \r\nthe Council’s agenda. In that way the recurrence of \r\nconflicts and situations that led to the involvement of \r\nthe Council can be avoided.\r\nI will now turn to agenda item 117, regarding \r\nreform of the Council. \r\nFirst, let me thank the President of the General \r\nAssembly for his communication of 9 November \r\ninforming us of the confirmation of Ambassador \r\nZahir Tanin as coordinator of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations. On behalf of my Government, I wish to \r\ncongratulate Ambassador Tanin on his reappointment \r\nand to assure him and the President of our intention to \r\nwork at his side and to collaborate to our fullest ability \r\nto ensure that this process maintains the momentum \r\nand energy achieved in recent years. Leadership, \r\nimpartiality and neutrality are qualities of fundamental \r\nimportance for building confidence among members \r\nand ensuring that consultations are productive \r\nthroughout the process.\r\nThe Government of Colombia assigns the greatest \r\nimportance to the process of Security Council \r\nreform. For several years we have joined forces \r\nwith a representative group of countries from all \r\ncontinents having a common goal: to ensure that any \r\nmodifications to the Charter of the United Nations \r\nrelating to the composition and functioning of the \r\nSecurity Council are the product of general consensus \r\nacceptable to each and every State. Members of the \r\nUniting for Consensus group have declared that we \r\nwill work tirelessly to achieve a general agreement, \r\nwhich is the only way to achieve a reform that would be \r\nsatisfactory to the international community as a whole. \r\nAs a member of the group, Colombia has a well-known \r\nposition: we advocate the continuation of the process \r\nof intergovernmental negotiations on the basis of the \r\nconsensus achieved in 2008, as reflected in decision \r\n62/557.\r\nExperience has shown that reform must be \r\ncomprehensive, transparent, balanced and equitable \r\nand that it must reflect the interests and needs of all \r\nMember States. Developing States must be better \r\nrepresented in the Security Council. In particular, the \r\n12-59129 19\r\nA/67/PV.38\r\nA/66/PV.129). They are now on the table and form an \r\nintegral part of the negotiation process. Let us begin \r\ndiscussing those proposals and see how we can best \r\nmake them operational. We are confident that that will \r\nhelp us to finally move towards real negotiations on this \r\nimportant matter.\r\nMr. Kodama (Japan): At the outset, I would like \r\nto thank the President of the General Assembly for \r\nhaving convened the present plenary meeting to discuss \r\nSecurity Council reform, combined with the report of \r\nthe Security Council to the General Assembly (A/67/2). \r\nJapan highly appreciates the fact that the President of \r\nthe General Assembly has identified United Nations \r\nreform, which includes Security Council reform and \r\nthe revitalization of the General Assembly, as one of \r\nhis priorities during the sixty-seventh session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. I would also like to commend his \r\nreappointment of Ambassador Zahir Tanin as the chair \r\nof the intergovernmental negotiations. We sincerely \r\nhope that the President of the General Assembly and \r\nAmbassador Tanin, as chair of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations, will exercise legitimate leadership in \r\nguiding us to promote substantive and meaningful \r\ndiscussions among Member States.\r\nNo one doubts the necessity of Security Council \r\nreform. Various efforts have been made to make the \r\nSecurity Council more representative, legitimate and \r\neffective. It is regrettable, however, that the issue has \r\nnot seen much progress over the decades. Let us recall \r\nthat the 2005 World Summit and its Outcome Document \r\n(resolution 60/1) set Member States the task of realizing \r\nearly reform of the Security Council. Yet, seven years \r\non from the World Summit, we have failed to achieve \r\nany reform of the Security Council at all. In that regard, \r\nJapan would like to remind every Member State that we \r\nhave a collective responsibility to translate our political \r\nleaders’ commitment into concrete Security Council \r\nreform.\r\nThe present intergovernmental negotiation process \r\nhas been ongoing for nearly four years, and we have \r\nexhausted every conceivable discussion pertaining to \r\nitems on the agenda. Thanks to Ambassador Tanin’s \r\nleadership during the last round of negotiations, we \r\nhave already acquired a clear and deep understanding \r\nof each group’s position on this issue. And we must note \r\nthat an overwhelming majority of Member States voiced \r\nsupport for the expansion of the Security Council in \r\nboth categories of membership, the permanent and the \r\nnon-permanent. Now is the time for all Member States \r\nThat has also added to the already growing \r\nfrustration among Member States due to the deadlock \r\non Council reform. Last year, in the General Assembly, \r\neven partial, modest progress was made impossible on \r\nthe improvement of the Council’s working methods, \r\nwhich is something we sincerely deplore. Against that \r\nbackground, we would have preferred two separate \r\ndebates to be have been held, on the annual report \r\nand on Security Council reform, respectively, given \r\nthat both issues deserve the undivided attention of the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nOn 9 October, the Ambassadors of the \r\nGroup of Four (G-4) transmitted to the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly a letter containing the joint statement \r\nmade by the G-4 Foreign Ministers on the margins of \r\nthe general debate. The letter was also shared with \r\nall Member States. I therefore do not need to repeat \r\nits content in detail. Let me reiterate, however, the \r\ndedication of the G-4 Foreign Ministers to achieving \r\ntogether an early reform of the Security Council. The \r\nMinisters also called for a concrete outcome at the \r\npresent session of the General Assembly and expressed \r\ntheir commitment to continue to work towards that end \r\nin a spirit of f lexibility and in close cooperation with \r\nother Member States. Germany, individually and as part \r\nof the G-4, stands ready to continue our engagement \r\nwith the President of the General Assembly, The chair, \r\nAmbassador Tanin, and Member States.\r\nThe strong support for genuine reform of the \r\nCouncil — which is what the G-4 stands for — was \r\nagain evident during the last round of negotiations. The \r\nmajority of the delegations that took the f loor — from \r\nsmall and large countries, from the developing and the \r\ndeveloped world — clearly called for an expansion of \r\nthe Council in both categories, the permanent and the \r\nnon-permanent.\r\nWe look forward to the resumption of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations as soon as possible. We \r\nwelcome the decision to reappoint Ambassador Tanin \r\nas chair. We are confident that he will continue to steer \r\nthe process forward in an objective and results-oriented \r\nmanner.\r\nThe agenda for the negotiations is clear. The chair \r\nhas submitted his assessment of the process to date \r\ntogether with a set of constructive proposals on how to \r\nmove the process forward. The proposals were circulated \r\nby the preceding President of the General Assembly \r\nto all Member States and were acknowledged by the \r\nGeneral Assembly in its oral decision in September (see \r\n20 12-59129\r\nA/67/PV.38\r\nthe note to be followed accordingly. We believe that the \r\nreport not only strengthens relations between these two \r\nimportant organs of the United Nations but also plays \r\nan important role in ensuring the accountability and \r\ntransparency of the Council. That obviously pertains \r\nto improving the working methods of the Security \r\nCouncil, which is one of the five clusters of Council \r\nreform. In that regard, Japan welcomes the holding \r\nof the debate in the General Assembly today and the \r\ninformal consultative meeting with non-members of \r\nthe Security Council on this matter on 30 July.\r\nWith regard to the contents of the annual report, \r\nJapan considers it comprehensive and descriptive. It \r\ncomprises regional issues as well as thematic issues, \r\nsuch as post-conflict peacebuilding, children and \r\narmed conflict and some legal issues. It also contains \r\ninformation from other meetings, such as informal \r\ninteractive dialogues with non-members, other United \r\nNations organs and regional organizations. Japan \r\ncommends the format and description of the report, \r\nwhich enhance the clarity of the Council’s work in \r\nthe report and will eventually further improve the \r\ntransparency of the Council. We would have hoped to \r\nsee the inclusion in the report of greater background \r\ninformation on the events on which the Council \r\nworked. We hope that continued efforts will be made \r\nto strengthen the substantive aspects of the report, \r\nincluding by improving the monthly assessments that \r\nform the basis of the introduction. At the same time, \r\nmore efforts are needed to make the report even more \r\nconcise.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate once again \r\nJapan’s firm commitment to exert all efforts to achieve \r\na concrete reform outcome during the present session, \r\nworking in close cooperation with the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, Ambassador Tanin and all Member \r\nStates. I would also like to request that members of \r\nthe Security Council continue their efforts in ensuring \r\naccountability, transparency and effectiveness in \r\nthe Council’s work. In that regard, we commend \r\nthe contribution made by Portugal during the past \r\nyear as the Chair of the Informal Working Group on \r\nDocumentation and Other Procedural Questions.\r\nMr. Schaper (Netherlands): Thank you, Sir, for \r\ngiving me the opportunity to make a short statement \r\non behalf of the Kingdom of Belgium and the Kingdom \r\nof the Netherlands on the question of Security Council \r\nreform.\r\nto intensify the negotiations with a view to achieving a \r\nconcrete outcome in the next round — the ninth — of \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations.\r\nAt the closing of sixty-sixth session of the General \r\nAssembly, we Member States decised to roll over the \r\nissue to the current session (see A/66/PV.129), while \r\ntaking note of the recommendations by the chair of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations, contained in his letter \r\nof 25 July. In that regard, Japan believes that in order \r\nto have a meaningful and constructive negotiation in \r\nthe next round of intergovernmental negotiations, it is \r\nimportant for the negotiation to be conducted in line \r\nwith the recommendations. Japan duly acknowledges \r\nthose recommendations as “reflections” of the chair, \r\nwho has guided the process forward over the past four \r\nyears. In particular, Japan believes that one of his \r\nrecommendations — the drafting of a concise working \r\ndocument — should be carried out as a crucial step to \r\nmove the process forward to realizing the reform. To \r\nthat end, Japan requests all Member States to engage in \r\nthat important task. Of course, Japan is fully committed \r\nto contributing to that collective work.\r\nJapan’s commitment has also been demonstrated as \r\npart of the collective political will of the reform-oriented \r\nand results-driven Group of Four (G-4). The G-4 \r\nForeign Ministers met in New York on 25 September \r\nand reiterated their determination to work in close \r\ncooperation and in a spirit of f lexibility with other \r\nMember States on genuine text-based negotiations. \r\nThe Ministers also expressed their determination to \r\ninject greater political momentum into the process, \r\nincluding with a view to holding a high-level \r\nmeeting on Security Council reform, as stated in the \r\nrecommendations of the chair of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations, Ambassador Tanin. Japan is of the \r\nview that such a meeting should take place in 2013, \r\nthereby commemorating the fifth anniversary of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiation process.\r\nI shall now turn to another agenda item, namely, \r\nthe annual report of the Security Council to the \r\nGeneral Assembly. I would like to express my sincere \r\nappreciation to Ambassador Hardeep Singh Puri of \r\nIndia, President of the Security Council this month, for \r\nhis presentation of the report, as well as to Ambassador \r\nNéstor Osorio of Colombia and his staff for their work \r\nin preparing the report. Japan reiterates the importance \r\nof the annual report being improved and submitted to \r\nthe General Assembly, in keeping with presidential \r\nnote S/2010/507. We call for the relevant provisions of \r\n12-59129 21\r\nA/67/PV.38\r\nMission in Somalia and helping Somalia back onto its \r\nfeet; working with the African Union to encourage \r\nthe Sudan and South Sudan to come to the negotiating \r\ntable; and ensuring that the people of Timor-Leste can \r\nbuild sustainable peace. The Assembly has also heard \r\nof some of its failures this year, foremost among which \r\nis Syria. The failure of the Security Council to take \r\nfirm action to end the violence in Syria underlines \r\nthe crucial importance of ensuring that the Council \r\nnot only represents the modern world but is able and \r\nwilling to fulfil its core task of maintaining the world’s \r\npeace and security.\r\nThe United Kingdom expresses its gratitude to \r\nAmbassador Tanin for his tireless efforts to steer the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform over the past year. We welcome his reappointment \r\nas chair. We appreciate his commitment to working \r\nwith all Member States to make progress. While it is \r\nclear that there is not yet sufficient consensus on this \r\nissue, we are ready to continue working in the coming \r\nmonths to find elements upon which wider agreement \r\nmight be found.\r\nMember States will need to approach that task in \r\na spirit of compromise. Security Council reform is a \r\ndifficult and complex issue. We are all well aware of the \r\nmany competing and strongly held views of different \r\nMember States. But we believe that there is sufficient \r\ncommon ground on the fundamental need for reform for \r\nus to be able to move forward in the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations.\r\nThe United Kingdom’s position on Security \r\nCouncil reform is well known. We continue to support \r\npermanent membership for Brazil, India, Germany \r\nand Japan and permanent African representation. At \r\nthe same time, it is our firm view that reform must \r\nnot reduce the Council’s ability to act decisively when \r\ncalled upon to address threats to international peace \r\nand security.\r\nWhile we have our own view of what Security \r\nCouncil reform should look like, we are open to \r\nexploring the ideas of other Member States, if there is \r\nthe possibility of taking a step in the right direction. We \r\nmust all remain ready to seize opportunities to achieve \r\nconsensus. The United Kingdom is willing to work \r\nconstructively with those who believe that progress is \r\npossible.\r\nThe United Kingdom believes that the Council needs \r\nto operate in a manner that is as transparent, open and \r\nFirst of all, I would like to thank the President of \r\nthe General Assembly for his decision to reappoint \r\nAmbassador Tanin as chair of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiation process. Belgium and the Netherlands \r\napplaud that decision and will fully support Ambassador \r\nTanin in his continuing efforts to take the discussion to \r\nthe next level, both on process and on content. We call \r\nupon the membership to adopt the same attitude.\r\nIn its meeting of 13 September (see A/66/PV.129), \r\nthe General Assembly took an important step by \r\nprolonging the mandate of the open-ended working \r\ngroup, in particular by taking note of the proposals \r\nof the chair of the intergovernmental negotiations. In \r\nparticular, we would like to highlight Ambassador \r\nTanin’s recommendation to take what he called the next \r\nlogical step by having a genuine give-and-take based on \r\na concise working document. Ambassador Tanin also \r\nrecommended that such a working document should \r\nbe drafted by the chair, on the basis of consultations \r\nwith Member States, in keeping with the membership-\r\ndriven character of the process. From the perspective \r\nof Belgium and the Netherlands, that recommendation \r\ncould be a sound basis for our further work and mark \r\nthe beginning of the next phase of the negotiations.\r\nBelgium and the Netherlands are both committed \r\nto continue to support further discussion where and \r\nwhen possible, to keep up the momentum that has \r\nbeen generated, and to assist the membership to reach \r\nconcrete results at the sixty-seventh session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nOur position is not based on the wish to achieve a \r\nspecific national objective or defend a specific national \r\ninterest. What drives us is the goal of an effective, \r\nmodernized and more legitimate Security Council \r\nthat reflects the geopolitical realities of the twenty-\r\nfirst century, which in turn would also contribute to \r\na more credible United Nations and a strengthened \r\ninternational system.\r\nMr. Parham (United Kingdom): The United \r\nKingdom is pleased to make a statement in this annual \r\njoint debate on the Security Council report and the \r\nquestion of Security Council reform. We are grateful \r\nfor the efforts of our Colombian colleagues, who so \r\nmeticulously compiled this year’s report (A/67/2), as \r\nwell as for Ambassador Singh Puri’s introduction.\r\nThe Assembly has heard from the President of \r\nthe Security Council some of the achievements of the \r\nCouncil in the past year: supporting the African Union \r\n22 12-59129\r\nA/67/PV.38\r\nThat is why it is important that the annual reports \r\nof the Council not be limited to retrospective accounts \r\nof actions taken, as is the case with the document that \r\nwe have before us today. Such documents should be \r\nmore analytical, and they should include projections. \r\nThey should take a more self-critical stance, and they \r\nshould include an assessment of the effectiveness of \r\nmeasures taken by the Council and the positions taken \r\nby its members in adopting them, as well as lessons \r\nlearned, challenges and possible future strategies. \r\nIn other words, they should transmit a larger, more \r\ntransparent and more useful exercise in accountability.\r\nTo that effect, we call for the Security Council \r\nto present special reports to the General Assembly, \r\nin accordance with paragraph 3 of Article 24 of the \r\nCharter, each time the Council decides to establish a \r\nnew peacekeeping operation, substantially modifies an \r\noperation’s mandate or creates a new set of sanctions. \r\nWe also believe that the Security Council should \r\npresent a report to the General Assembly each time a \r\nresolution is vetoed and that the permanent members \r\nthat exercised the veto should explain to the entire \r\nmembership the reasons behind their decision.\r\nThat last point is particularly relevant in the \r\ncurrent global political climate, in which the promotion \r\nand strengthening of the rule of law is paramount to \r\nmaintaining international peace and security, as was \r\nevident in the Security Council’s debate of 17 October \r\n(see S/PV.6849). In the era of information and \r\naccountability, we must strive to garner the necessary \r\npolitical willingness to achieve f luid, efficient and \r\ncomprehensive communication among all of the actors \r\nin the United Nations. The legitimacy and effectiveness \r\nof the multilateral system depends in large part on such \r\ncommunication.\r\nSecurity Council reform should be an opportunity \r\nto transform the United Nations into a more effective \r\nand representative Organization. Reform should drive \r\nsound and balanced decisions, in which we can all feel \r\nthat we are the partners and sponsors. Reform should \r\nstrive to improve the capacity of the United Nations \r\nto respond effectively and legitimately to threats to \r\ninternational peace and security. It cannot and should \r\nnot be a mechanism for favouring some States over \r\nothers that are equally sovereign. It should be an \r\nexercise in f lexibility, commitment and the search for \r\nimproved representativeness. For that reason, we do \r\nnot consider it appropriate to increase the number of \r\npermanent members. We lean towards an increase in \r\nas effective as possible, which is why we continue to be \r\nat the forefront of efforts to improve Council working \r\nmethods. We actively encourage greater interaction \r\nbetween Council members during consultations and \r\nsupport the greater use of technology and social media, \r\nboth to improve the efficiency of what the Council does \r\nand to open up its workings to a wider global audience.\r\nWe shall continue to be unequivocal supporters of \r\nSecurity Council reform. I hope that, during the present \r\nsession of the General Assembly, we find the collective \r\nwill to make some progress.\r\nMr. Ulibarri (Costa Rica) (spoke in Spanish): Let me \r\nbegin by expressing our appreciation to the Ambassador \r\nof India and President of the Security Council for \r\nintroducing the Council’s annual report to the General \r\nAssembly (A/67/2). We also commend Colombia for \r\nits excellent work in writing the introduction and \r\ncompiling the report. We note the Security Council’s \r\nefforts to present a more concise document with \r\ncertain analytical elements. We encourage further \r\nprogress along those lines. We also commend the fact \r\nthat Ambassador Zahir Tanin continues to lead the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform. Costa Rica renews its commitment to working \r\ntowards and making a constructive contribution to that \r\nprocess.\r\nThroughout the world, transparency and \r\naccountability are increasingly becoming more than \r\nmere aspirations. In a positive development, they have \r\nbecome imperatives, not only for States but also for \r\ncorporations, non-governmental organizations and \r\nthe international community that is gathered here \r\ntoday. In honour of that ideal of transparency and in \r\nthe interest of the effectiveness and representativeness \r\nof the Organization, the balance of power between the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council needs, \r\nnow more than ever, to be restored, as enshrined in the \r\nCharter.\r\nAccording to the Charter, the Security Council \r\nacts on behalf of all of the Member States and has the \r\nprimary responsibility for maintaining international \r\npeace and security. It is therefore obvious that the \r\nCouncil must inform the Assembly in a timely manner \r\nof its actions, or lack thereof, so that all Member States \r\nhave the chance to exercise the necessary control and, \r\nshould the need arise, take any corrective measures \r\ncalled for.\r\n12-59129 23\r\nA/67/PV.38\r\nHowever, efforts towards that end must not impede the \r\nability of the Council to respond effectively and quickly \r\nto challenges as they arise. That is particularly relevant \r\nnow, when we are witnessing an increase in conflict \r\nsituations. It is obvious that, unless we preserve the \r\ncompact nature of the Council, it will not be possible to \r\nguarantee the speed of its reactions. The membership \r\nof that body should not exceed slightly more than 20 \r\nmembers. \r\nWe favour further improvement of the working \r\nmethods of the Security Council. We maintain our \r\nfundamental position, namely, that the Council is the \r\nmaster of its own working methods. We are convinced \r\nthat work on this matter must be carried out in an \r\natmosphere of transparency, taking into account the \r\nviews of Member States and with the understanding \r\nthat a reasonable balance must be maintained between \r\ntransparency and effectiveness. Attempts to dismantle \r\nthe reform package reflected in decision 62/557 are \r\ninadmissible. In any case, our priority is to enhance \r\nthe ability of the Security Council to implement its \r\nprerogatives under the Charter in the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nFor us, ideas that seek to impinge on the \r\nprerogatives of the present permanent members of the \r\nSecurity Council, including the historical institution \r\nof the veto, are unacceptable. It should be recalled \r\nthat that mechanism is a most important instrument \r\nand a stimulus for Council members in their search for \r\nbalanced decisions. Encroaching on that right would be \r\nan extremely rash step. \r\nWe support initiatives to step up the interaction \r\nbetween the Security Council and the General \r\nAssembly. We should not pull too tightly on the cord \r\nthat links those two major organs, but rather focus on \r\nthe areas in which real cooperation between them is \r\nnot only possible, but indispensable. There are quite a \r\nfew such areas. For example, let us take such relevant \r\nissues today as enhancing the effectiveness of United \r\nNations peacekeeping and peacebuilding. There is \r\nroom there for joint activity and for taking decisions in \r\nthe sphere of mediation to deal with problems facing the \r\nUnited Nations. The Security Council and the General \r\nAssembly can both make substantive contributions \r\nin that regard. The most important thing is for the \r\ncooperation between them to be conducted on the basis \r\nof respect for their existing prerogatives. To a great \r\nextent, that will determine the success of the reform. \r\nthe non-permanent category, with longer terms and \r\nthe possibility of re-election. That is, in essence, the \r\nposition of the Uniting for Consensus group, to which \r\nwe belong.\r\nFor Costa Rica, reform should also include \r\nregulation, limitation and the eventual elimination of \r\nthe veto power — a privilege that has often paralysed \r\nthe Council and has contributed substantially to \r\nundermining its legitimacy, especially in cases \r\ninvolving heinous crimes against humanity. We note \r\nand welcome the growing awareness in the international \r\ncommunity with regard to that subject. \r\nCosta Rica also considers it indispensable to \r\npermanently improve the Security Council’s working \r\nmethods. Such a procedural improvement should \r\nnot be conditional on a comprehensive reform. On \r\nthe contrary, such improvement should be a constant \r\nresponsibility, above all the reponsibility of the five \r\npermanent Council members but also of its elected \r\nmembers and all States Members of the United Nations.\r\nMore frequent and higher-quality reports, improved \r\ntransparency, timely accountability, more equal \r\ndistribution of internal responsibilities and basic limits \r\non the use of the veto are among the improvements in \r\nworking methods that should be relentlessly pursued. In \r\nour national capacity, as a member of the group of five \r\nsmall nations and in partnership with other Member \r\nStates, we will continue to work constructively towards \r\nthose goals.\r\nMr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): The question of Security Council reform \r\nis central to the general reform agenda of our global \r\nOrganization. That particular reform deals with one \r\nof Organization’s principal bodies, which, according \r\nto the Charter, bears the primary responsibility for the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. The \r\ndecision taken in the matter will, to a great extent, \r\ndetermine the effectiveness of the work of both the \r\nCouncil and the United Nations as a whole for the \r\nforeseeable future. \r\nDiscussions on that extraordinarily sensitive \r\nissue have been taking place within an extremely \r\ncomplex and difficult framework. During the eight \r\nrounds of intergovernmental negotiations so far it has \r\nbeen possible to make some progress, but a universal \r\ndecision that would satisfy all or at least the majority \r\nof Member States is, so far, not in sight. Russia favours \r\nmaking the Security Council more representative. \r\n24 12-59129\r\nA/67/PV.38\r\nSo far, the course of the negotiations so far does \r\nnot make it possible to say that we have come closer to \r\nworking out a universal formula for Security Council \r\nreform that might enjoy maximum broad support. We \r\nsee no alternative to continuing the painstaking work \r\nof bringing the negotiating parties closer together. \r\nWe believe that the efforts of the President of the \r\nsixty-seventh session of the General Assembly and \r\nthe coordinator of the negotiations, the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Afghanistan, will provide assistance \r\nin the negotiations, on the understanding that ownership \r\nof that process remains with the Member States \r\nthemselves. We are convinced that the work must be \r\nconducted in a calm, transparent and inclusive manner, \r\nwithout imposing any kind of artificial time frames. \r\nIn conclusion, I would like, once again, to emphasize \r\nthat progress and reform of the Security Council hinges \r\nsolely on the political will of Member States and their \r\nreadiness to achieve a reasonable compromise. \r\nMr. Sparber (Liechtenstein): Our collective failure \r\nto reform the Security Council is the single biggest piece \r\nof unfinished business. We have established a Human \r\nRights Council and made it, over time, into the effective \r\nbody it is today. We have created a Peacebuilding \r\nCommission, which, in spite of its weaknesses, fills a \r\ngap that existed in the institutional architecture of the \r\nUnited Nations. We have even made significant progress \r\nwith respect to the implementation of the responsibility \r\nto protect, much as there is left to do in that regard. On \r\nSecurity Council reform, however, tangible progress \r\nremains elusive, let alone the comprehensive reform \r\nthat we all agreed on over seven years ago. \r\nNobody underestimates the magnitude of the \r\nchallenge we are facing, and there are good explanations \r\nas to why we have so far been unsuccessful. But the \r\nmoment has long arrived when we have to ask ourselves \r\nwhether we are indeed trying or just pretending to try. \r\nMost of the time, the latter seems the case, and we \r\nthen must wonder whom we are trying to fool. We, as \r\nMember States, certainly know full well that the current \r\nprocess is not a genuine negotiation that can lead to a \r\nresult. And, in fact, we all know that consensus with \r\nrespect to Council reform can only mean very strong \r\nmajorities that are also conducive to implementing the \r\nresults — in the case of enlargement, a ratification \r\nprocess — but not necessarily unanimity. Let us \r\nface reality. For some — for too many, indeed — the \r\ncommitment to reform has essentially been lip service. \r\nThe discussions on draft resolution A/66/L.42/Rev.2, \r\nWe are convinced that the question of Security \r\nCouncil reform cannot be resolved arithmetically \r\nsimply by putting various models to a vote subject to \r\nthe minimum required two-thirds vote of the members \r\nof the General Assembly. A result achieved that way \r\nwould hardly enhance the authority of the Security \r\nCouncil and would not serve to strengthen the world \r\nOrganization. We also have doubts regarding the \r\npractice of establishing specific groups of States or \r\nassociations of countries that try at any cost to expand \r\ntheir base of support for initiatives that they have put \r\nforward or, even more dangerously, to artificially force \r\ntheir implementation. \r\nIn that regard, we fully support what has been \r\nsaid here many times from this rostrum, namely, that \r\nthe formula for Security Council reform must enjoy \r\nmaximally broad support from the Members of the \r\nOrganization. If it is not possible to achieve consensus \r\nhere, then in any case it is politically imperative to \r\nguarantee the support of a significantly larger number \r\nof Member States than the legally required two-thirds \r\nmajority of votes in the General Assembly.\r\nWe are ready to consider any reasonable option for \r\nexpanding the membership of the Security Council. \r\nWe cannot fail to recognize the existence of strong \r\nclaims to permanent seats in the Security Council, but \r\ntheir number, as announced so far, already exceeds \r\nthe maximum possible seats that have been proposed \r\nduring the intergovernmental negotiations. What is also \r\nunclear is the algorithm for determining the number \r\nof specific possible permanent member countries in \r\nthe event that a significant decision is adopted on the \r\nexpansion of members of the Council in both categories. \r\nA solution to such a difficult headache could be, in our \r\nview, an interim compromise decision, which could \r\nsatisfy the ambitions of the influential members of the \r\ninternational community who are trying to play a more \r\nactive role in the Security Council and would not lead \r\nto a split in the General Assembly. \r\nIn any case, the most important thing is for the \r\ndecision to be based on the broadest possible agreement \r\nwithin the United Nations. In the light of the above, \r\nwe believe it would be useful to devote the next round \r\nof intergovernmental negotiations to a comparative \r\nanalysis of the advantages of the basic formulas for \r\nCouncil reform and also to the problems linked to them. \r\nThat would assist us in having a clearer view of all of \r\nthe consequences of the implementation of the various \r\nmodels of reform. \r\n12-59129 25\r\nA/67/PV.38\r\nWhat is more, we strongly believe that reform of \r\nthe working methods is indispensable if there is to \r\nbe an agreement on any possible enlargement model. \r\nThere is not even a remote possibility of creating new \r\nveto powers — and Liechtenstein would not support \r\nsuch a proposal — or of eliminating the existing vetoes. \r\nIn such a situation, at the least a very modest agreement \r\non the use of the veto will be indispensable in order \r\nto move the enlargement effort forward. Ideally, that \r\nwould precede an agreement on enlargement. Changes \r\nin the current practice of the use of the veto are an \r\nurgent imperative, as we have been reminded all too \r\noften in recent months.\r\nMr. Sangqu (South Africa): We commend the \r\nPresident of the Security Council for the month of \r\nNovember, Mr. Hardeep Singh Puri, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of India, for presenting the annual \r\nreport of the Council (A/67/2) and the delegation of \r\nColombia, under the leadership of Ambassador Néstor \r\nOsorio, for preparing it.\r\nIn October 2010, the General Assembly elected \r\nand mandated South Africa to serve as an elected \r\nmember of the Security Council. Cognizant of the high \r\nresponsibility that had been bestowed upon us, we have \r\ncarried out that honourable task. As our term on the \r\nSecurity Council draws to an end, we come here today \r\nto report to the Member States that elected us to that \r\nbody and to account and reflect on our contribution to \r\nand assessment of the work of the Security Council.\r\nAs an elected member of the Security Council, \r\nmy delegation was acutely aware of the limitations \r\nthat come with being a non-permanent member of that \r\nbody, but we were determined to play a meaningful \r\nand active role in its affairs. In our experience, elected \r\nmembers of the Council are confronted by numerous \r\nconstraints that result from the dominance, in the \r\ncurrent configuration, of the non-elected permanent \r\nmembers. That dominance is experienced at the very \r\nstart of one’s tenure, when the five permanent members \r\nallocate the chairmanships of subsidiary bodies \r\nwithout themselves chairing any and with little or no \r\nconsultation with the members concerned. It further \r\npermeates the daily work of the Council, as three of the \r\npermanent members are the penholders on almost every \r\ncountry-specific mandate on the Council’s agenda. In \r\naddition, the resolutions or decisions of the Council are \r\noften drafted in small groups and presented as a fait \r\naccompli to the elected members. We support broad \r\nwhich we submitted last session (see A/66/PV.50) \r\ntogether with Costa Rica, Jordan, Singapore and \r\nSwitzerland, starkly illustrated that fact.\r\nWe hope that this session will bring about \r\ndifferent approaches and bolder attempts to advance \r\nthe discussions. That would entail a more in-depth \r\nexploration of what has been called the intermediate \r\nmodel. As is well known, we put one such model \r\nforward ourselves, but given that some quite different \r\nnotions have also been included under that heading, \r\nwe have given it a new name that makes clear what the \r\nmodel actually is. It is an enlargement model that would \r\ncreate a new category of seats: long-term, renewable \r\nseats. States could thus serve de facto permanently \r\non the Council, if re-elected, without the power of \r\nthe veto. Six such new seats would be added, either \r\ncombined with a number of new non-permanent seats \r\nor not, which would bring the total number of Council \r\nmembers to 21. That new composition would be \r\nsubject to a review after 20 years, which would include \r\nquestions such as the creation of new permanent seats, \r\nthe exercise of the veto and other key aspects of the \r\nCouncil’s work. That enlargement model has been on \r\nthe table for quite some time, and we would be happy \r\nto engage in a substantive discussion on its parameters \r\nand in particular to compare it with other models that \r\nare currently presented as intermediate.\r\nAs important as enlargement is, there can clearly \r\nbe no genuine reform of the Council without measures \r\nto make its work more transparent, accountable and \r\nlegitimate. The consensus at the 2005 World Summit \r\nconfirmed that understanding and gave all of us \r\nownership over it. But we have failed to live up to that \r\ncommitment. The two presidential notes adopted by the \r\nCouncil under the reference number 507 (S/2006/507 \r\nand S/2010/507) are a disappointing record of progress, \r\nin particular as the limited measures in those two \r\ndocuments have been inconsistently implemented and, \r\ndepending on who dictates the f lavour of the month \r\nin the Council, at times ignored. The circumstances \r\nunder which the group of five small nations had to \r\nwithdraw draft resolution A/66/L.42/Rev.2 at the last \r\nsession of the Assembly speaks volumes about the lack \r\nof accountability that the draft resolution was trying to \r\naddress. We are grateful for the strong support we were \r\ngiven in that effort and are committed to continuing our \r\nwork to that end. Working methods are as important \r\nas enlargement, probably even more so, in order to \r\ngenuinely make the Security Council a better organ.\r\n26 12-59129\r\nA/67/PV.38\r\npost-CPA issues, continue to benefit the Council as it \r\naddresses those matters. That strategic coordination \r\nwas rewarded when the two parties, which were almost \r\non the brink of war, signed a cooperation agreement on \r\n27 September that dealt with all outstanding issues.\r\nWith regard to Somalia, we recall the meeting of the \r\nSecurity Council on 11 January, under South Africa’s \r\npresidency of the Council, in which the President of the \r\nAU Peace and Security Council participated, as well \r\nas States members of the Intergovernmental Authority \r\non Development, culminating in the adoption of \r\nresolution 2036 (2012), which authorized an increase in \r\nthe troop levels of the African Union Military Observer \r\nMission in Somalia (AMISOM). That landmark \r\nresolution and the increase in AMISOM’s troop levels \r\nseverely disrupted Al-Shabaab, thus creating a security \r\nenvironment conducive to ending the political transition \r\nphase in Somalia and culminating in the recent election \r\nof the new President and Cabinet.\r\nSouth Africa is pleased that the annual consultations \r\nbetween the Security Council and the AU Peace and \r\nSecurity Council have become more structured and \r\neffective. In that regard, we are of the view that greater \r\nstrategic coordination between the United Nations and \r\nthe AU will enhance the effectiveness of the Security \r\nCouncil in addressing challenges to peace and security \r\non the continent of Africa. We are confident that that \r\ncontinued cooperation and unity between the two \r\nCouncils could be of immense benefit in addressing the \r\nchallenges that we face in the Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo, Guinea-Bissau, Mali and the wider Sahel \r\nregion.\r\nDespite those positive developments, my delegation \r\nremains concerned about the tendency in certain cases \r\nwhere the Security Council is selective in picking those \r\nelements of decisions taken by regional organizations \r\nthat advance the national interest of some members. \r\nSuch selectivity and double standards were visibly \r\ndemonstrated when the AU’s road map for Libya \r\nwas undermined and ignored by the implementers of \r\nresolution 1973 (2011). Furthermore, the views of the \r\nLeague of Arab States on the Palestinian question have \r\nbeen conveniently ignored, while its views on Libya \r\nand Syria have been fully endorsed. It is important that \r\nthe principle of subsidiarity be respected, if we are to \r\nestablish better synergies in enhancing cooperation, \r\nespecially on the African continent. We therefore call \r\nfor greater consistency on the part of the Council in \r\nengaging with regional bodies.\r\nconsultation by the Council, but its decisions should be \r\nopen to debate among all its members.\r\nDespite those limitations, we believe that we have \r\ndelivered on the mandate given to us by that body, \r\nour subregion, the Southern African Development \r\nCommunity, and the African continent. South Africa \r\nused its comparative advantage, derived from our \r\nexperience during our first tenure on the Council and \r\nour history of having been on the Council’s agenda. In \r\naddition, our active work in peacemaking, peacekeeping \r\nand peacebuilding on the continent of Africa and \r\nbeyond has equipped us to participate actively in the \r\ndeliberations of the Council. We maintain that elected \r\nmembers often come to the Council with the necessary \r\nexpertise and knowledge to provide benefits to its work.\r\nThe annual report of the Security Council before \r\nus indicates the many areas where the Council remains \r\nengaged in resolving conflicts all over the world, \r\nparticularly in Africa. The transitions from conflict \r\nto peace in countries such as Somalia, the Sudan and \r\nTimor-Leste are testimony to what the Security Council \r\ncan achieve when it assumes its Charter responsibilities. \r\nWe are pleased that, during the reporting period, the \r\nCouncil has also stimulated constructive debates on \r\nkey global issues, such as peacebuilding, the protection \r\nof civilians, women, peace and security, and children \r\nand armed conflict.\r\nSouth Africa is particularly pleased with the \r\nenhanced strategic cooperation between the Peace and \r\nSecurity Council of the African Union (AU) and the \r\nSecurity Council. In that regard, South Africa piloted \r\nthe adoption of resolution 2033 (2012), which was \r\nadopted during its presidency of the Security Council \r\nin January of this year and builds on resolution 1809 \r\n(2008), which was adopted during its presidency in \r\nApril 2008. The aims of those resolutions are to promote \r\ngreater strategic coordination between the two bodies, \r\nto secure predictable and sustainable funding for AU \r\npeacekeeping operations and to support post-conflict \r\nreconstruction and development on the continent.\r\nThe positive impact of that strategic coordination \r\nis evidenced by the subsequent adoption of resolution \r\n2046 (2012) on the Sudan and South Sudan, in which the \r\nAU Peace and Security Council road map for dealing \r\nwith the outstanding Comprehensive Peace Agreement \r\n(CPA) and post-secession issues was endorsed by the \r\nSecurity Council. The ongoing consultations between \r\nthe Council and the AU High-level Implementation \r\nPanel, which is playing a leadership role in resolving \r\n12-59129 27\r\nA/67/PV.38\r\nexpansion of its membership in both the permanent and \r\nthe non-permanent categories.\r\nReform of the Security Council remains one of \r\nthe most urgent challenges facing the United Nations \r\ntoday. We welcome the President’s promise to assist \r\nMember States in working towards the revitalization \r\nof the General Assembly, including through the reform \r\nprocess. We hope that reform process will not be \r\ntreated as merely one of many issues for consideration \r\nbut that it will be seen in the way that the vast majority \r\nof Member States see it, namely, a priority whose \r\nurgency cannot be overstated. We wish to express our \r\npleasure at the reappointment of Ambassador Zahir \r\nTanin, the Permanent Representative of Afghanistan, \r\nas facilitator of the intergovernmental negotiations. We \r\nhave confidence in his leadership, and we assure him \r\nand the President of the Assembly of our full support as \r\nwe try to make progress in the negotiations.\r\nAfter many a high and low, we find ourselves \r\ntoday in need of a breakthrough in order to \r\nrecapture the momentum of 2009 and reinvigorate \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations. My delegation \r\nis concerned about the fact that, since the launch of \r\nintergovernmental negotiations in February 2009, we \r\nhave relapsed into the open-ended working group mode \r\nof restating positions. We are convinced that the current \r\ntext before us, while a useful reference document for \r\nthe positions of Member States and groups of States, \r\ncannot help nudge us towards concrete results. What is \r\nneeded is a process or initiative that can lead towards \r\nconvergence. We believe that the various exchanges \r\nin the eighth round of negotiations have highlighted \r\nareas where convergences and compromises may lie, \r\nand that, in the main, the majority of States and groups \r\nof States are calling for expansion in both categories. \r\nThe African Group and the group associated with draft \r\nresolution A/61/L.69/Rev.2, to which we belong, share \r\nthat view.\r\nThe call for expansion in both categories is based on \r\nour belief that the fundamental objective of the reform \r\nis to ensure that the Council, consistent with the Charter \r\nvalues of universalism, collective responsibility, fairness \r\nand equity, is broadly representative and reflects the \r\ncurrent state of world affairs. Those values would be \r\ninconsistent with a Security Council in which Africa \r\nremained unrepresented in the permanent category. \r\nIn that regard, we call on the facilitator to produce a \r\nshorter text based on the positions of the overwhelming \r\nmajority of Member States. We would encourage the \r\nWe remain concerned that the Security Council has \r\nnot succeeded in bringing about any positive change in \r\nthe situation between Israel and Palestine. The failure \r\nof the Council to find a lasting solution to that crisis \r\nhas denied the hopes of millions of Palestinians and \r\nIsraelis. We also regret that the Council has delegated \r\nits responsibility to the Quartet, which has been \r\nmoribund in its handling of that issue. South Africa \r\nis most disappointed that the Security Council could \r\nnot reach consensus on supporting Palestine’s bid for \r\nmembership of the General Assembly or on visiting \r\nPalestine. In our view, the Council’s failure to act on \r\nthat matter contributes to the continued instability in \r\nthe region, thereby giving rise to the tragic events of \r\nthe past few days in Gaza that we all have witnessed.\r\nWe remain convinced that the credibility of the \r\nSecurity Council will continue to be challenged as long \r\nas the human rights of Palestinians and the people of the \r\nWestern Sahara are ignored, which has been the case \r\nfor decades. That harms the credibility of the Council \r\nas a guardian of international peace and security.\r\nThe past year has seen more improvement of the \r\nworking methods of the Council. An encouraging \r\ndevelopment has been the use of informal interactive \r\ndialogues, which has allowed the Council to interact \r\ninformally with individual Member States, the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission and subregional and \r\nregional organizations. A further improvement in the \r\nCouncil’s working methods can be seen in the fact \r\nthat elected members have been designated to serve as \r\npenholders, as with Germany on Afghanistan and South \r\nAfrica on Timor-Leste, and have also become leaders \r\nor co-leaders during Security Council missions to \r\ncountries on the Council’s agenda. Under Portugal’s able \r\nchairmanship, the Working Group on Documentation \r\nand Other Procedural Questions has actively promoted \r\ngreater transparency and efficiency in the Council’s \r\nwork. Addressing such issues — penholders, the \r\nchairing of subsidiary bodies, the preparation of the \r\nannual report and monthly assessments — has led to \r\nmodest but meaningful steps towards improving the \r\nCouncil’s work.\r\nWe welcome such positive developments and \r\nencourage the Security Council to defend the significant \r\nadvances made and to pursue further improvements. \r\nHowever, we reiterate the view that cosmetic changes \r\nto the working methods are not an adequate response \r\nto the need for fundamental reform of the Council and \r\n28 12-59129\r\nA/67/PV.38\r\nin effect, “Let us prolong these discussions without \r\nreaching any decision, as I stand to lose if country X \r\nbecomes a permanent member”. Then we hear the same \r\nvoices asking why the reform process is slow. I am \r\namazed and puzzled.\r\nMost Member States profess to want a more \r\ntransparent, inclusive and engaging Security Council. \r\nAlmost all present here today would agree that the veto \r\npower is, without a doubt, undemocratic and morally \r\nunjustified. The irony is that, while we claim to be \r\nchampions of democracy worldwide, some of us prefer \r\nan authoritarian model when it comes to the work of the \r\nSecurity Council. We have also heard suggestions that, \r\nwhile the veto is bad, new permanent members should \r\nnot be denied the right to such powers. We have heard \r\na lot of hype about improving the Council’s working \r\nmethods, but when we met in this Hall last May, we \r\nwere told that the draft resolution on the subject had \r\nbeen withdrawn (see A/66/PV.108).\r\nLet us ask ourselves: Are we really serious about \r\nwanting Security Council reform, or do we just want to \r\nseem politically correct, which is why we continue to \r\nmislead the world by claiming that we want reform of \r\nthat important organ of the United Nations? It is time \r\nfor us to re-examine our real intentions and to work \r\npositively to help the process move forward. In that \r\nconnection, for example, while we complain that the \r\nUnited Nations asks too much from Member States for \r\nthe financing of its operations, we, the Member States, \r\nare sometimes to blame for higher operational costs. \r\nThe 20-year discussion of Security Council reform, \r\nto which there seems to be no end, is a clear example \r\nof how we have contributed to an increase in United \r\nNations operating costs.\r\nWhere do we go from here? We can continue to \r\npretend that we are in a negotiating process. We can \r\nmeet once every two or three months to read statements \r\nprepared only so as to announce our individual views, \r\nand in the process we might ridicule the ideas of other \r\nparties. We can continue to take an all-or-nothing \r\napproach, as has been done for 20 years. We can \r\nalso continue to intimidate smaller countries in the \r\ndiscussions and then to claim that all Member States \r\nhave equal rights in this most democratic Assembly. To \r\nbe politically correct, we should also continue telling \r\nthe world that we want to reform the Security Council, \r\neven though deep down we know that is not what we \r\nactually want, and that we will take every possible \r\nstep — political, legal and technical — to stall the \r\nfacilitator to be guided, in producing that text, by his \r\nown assessment that expansion in both categories \r\nenjoys the support of the majority of Member States.\r\nDiscussions on the reform of the Security Council \r\nhave gone on much too long. Now is the time to show \r\nthat we are all committed to giving effect to the call of \r\nour leaders in the 2005 World Summit final document \r\n(resolution 60/1) for fundamental reform. It is our \r\ncollective responsibility to conclude those negotiations \r\nin a just and expeditious manner.\r\nMr. Haniff (Malaysia): I would like to express \r\nmy appreciation to the President for convening today’s \r\nmeeting to further elaborate on and take stock of what \r\nwe have achieved in the eight rounds of discussions on \r\nthe question of equitable representation on and increase \r\nin the membership of the Security Council. Malaysia \r\nassociates itself with the statement made by the \r\nrepresentative of Egypt on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement. I would like to limit my statement to \r\ndiscussing the issue of reform of the Security Council, \r\nwhich appears as agenda item 117 in the Assembly’s \r\nprogramme of work.\r\nWe term the discussions a negotiating process, \r\nbut we all know that what we are dealing with are not \r\nnegotiations as we normally conduct them at the United \r\nNations. No negotiations have actually been carried \r\nout. We have had statement-reading sessions, but hardly \r\nconstitutes a negotiating process. We nonetheless \r\ncontinue to meet, although deep down we may quietly \r\nadmit that the process is substantially where it was \r\n20 years ago. The eight meetings we have had on the \r\nissues of the Security Council’s working methods and \r\nits expansion have brought us no closer to a reformed \r\nCouncil. In some ways, in fact, we have drifted further \r\napart than we were 20 years ago. We have groups and \r\nMember States that have openly stated that they want \r\nthe Council to be expanded and its working methods \r\nimproved, but we now see bilateral and regional \r\nrivalries coming into play. We cannot even agree on \r\nwhat an expanded Security Council should look like.\r\nThat was evident last year, when a draft resolution \r\nof one operative paragraph that sought to expand the \r\nmembership of the Security Council, a subject on which \r\nall Member States claimed to agree, did not even see \r\nthe light of day in the Assembly (A/66/L.42/Rev.2). The \r\nwhole thing has become a zero-sum game. The opinion \r\nseems to be: “If I cannot make it into the Council, that \r\nother Member State should not be allowed to become \r\na permanent member”. I hear subtle voices saying, \r\n12-59129 29\r\nA/67/PV.38\r\nanywhere. It is time for all of us — especially the \r\nmajority of members who currently have little or no \r\nsay at all in matters related to the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security — to drop the all-or-\r\nnothing approach, and to not only talk about f lexibility \r\nbut prove that we possess it. Those of us who are part of \r\nthat majority stand to lose in the current stalemate. We \r\ncan continue in what is a political charade of the highest \r\norder, or we can choose to start real negotiations, with \r\na reasonable timeline for their conclusion. Until such \r\ntime, we have only ourselves to blame for our inability \r\nto play a more meaningful role in the work of the \r\nSecurity Council. \r\nMalaysia sincerely hopes that we will achieve some \r\nprogress as we continue to deliberate on that important \r\nissue during the current session of the General Assembly. \r\nOtherwise, we will just keep repeating ourselves.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1 p.m.\r\nwhole process and then blame other parties for their \r\nbeing inflexible.\r\nBy the way, the word “flexibility” has taken on a \r\nnew meaning in our discussions. It effectively means: \r\n“You should agree with what I said and abandon your \r\nposition”. We can all agree that such shortcomings are \r\nmaking it much more difficult for any forward motion in \r\nthe process to be achieved by Ambassador Zahir Tanin, \r\nPermanent Representative of the Islamic Republic \r\nof Afghanistan and chair of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on the equitable representation and \r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council and \r\nother matters related to the Council. While I mention \r\nhim, I wish to congratulate Ambassador Tanin on his \r\nreappointment as chair.\r\nIn closing, I reiterate that we should start genuine \r\nnegotiations, with a workable text and reasonable \r\ntimelines for the process to conclude. We have tried \r\ncompilation texts in the past. That did not get us \r\n"
