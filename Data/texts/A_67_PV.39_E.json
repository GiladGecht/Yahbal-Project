I would also like to convey \r\nour appreciation to the delegation of Colombia for \r\ncoordinating the preparation of the introduction to \r\nthe report,  a process that also involved a consultative \r\nmeeting with the general membership.\r\nPakistan supports the efforts to improve the \r\nanalytical and qualitative value of the Council’s annual \r\nreport. The statistical data and other information \r\ncontained in the report is a useful compendium for \r\nquick reference and an overview of the Council’s work \r\nduring the reporting period. We appreciate the hard \r\nwork of the Secretariat in that regard.\r\nThe interest and active participation in today’s \r\ndebate confirm the report’s value. Of course there is \r\nroom to enrich and sharpen its analytical content. The \r\ngeneral membership closely follows the Council’s \r\nproceedings. Today therefore presents an opportunity \r\nto review and comment on the Council’s performance \r\nin carrying out its primary responsibility to maintain \r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nThe report shows the range of the Security Council’s \r\nagenda, from country-specific to regional situations, \r\nfrom terrorism to non-proliferation. It also covers \r\nthematic issues such as the rule of law, the protection of \r\ncivilians, women and peace and security, children and \r\narmed conflict — issues that cut across many situations \r\non the Council’s agenda.\r\nPeacekeeping and peacebuilding have proved to \r\nbe effective tools for the Council to deal with various \r\nconflict and non-conflict situations. Sierra Leone and \r\nBurundi are success stories. We have witnessed progress \r\nin Liberia and Côte d’Ivoire. As a major participant in \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping missions, Pakistan is \r\nproud of its own contribution to international efforts in \r\nthose situations and elsewhere in Africa. \r\nRecently, we have also seen some setbacks. The \r\nCouncil has been trying to redress the difficulties \r\nin Guinea-Bissau, the recurring problems in the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and the eruption of \r\nthe crisis in Mali. The interplay of the situation in Mali \r\nwith the wider Sahel region has received the Council’s \r\nclose attention. All of those processes have reinforced \r\ncomprehensive and holistic approaches underpinned by \r\nregional cooperation and international support.\r\nThe Council’s sustained engagement with regional \r\norganizations contributed to the positive developments \r\nUnited Nations A/67/PV.39\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-seventh session\r\n39th plenary meeting\r\nThursday, 15 November 2012, 3 p.m.\r\nNew York\r\nOffi cial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Jeremić  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Serbia)\r\n2 12-59231\r\nA/67/PV.39\r\nin Somalia. The result is regional consensus and \r\ncohesion on a situation that had been abandoned as \r\nintractable. The African Union has worked in tandem \r\nwith the Security Council to resolve outstanding issues \r\nbetween the Sudan and South Sudan.\r\nThe Council’s continued engagement with Haiti \r\nremains crucial. The swift movement towards stability \r\nin Timor-Leste has enabled the country to graduate \r\nfrom the Council’s agenda. We in the United Nations \r\ncan all take pride in that achievement. It is a job well \r\ndone. In Afghanistan, the United Nations plays an \r\nimportant role, and it is poised to play an even greater \r\nrole in the years to come, especially after 2014.\r\nThe Council has been deliberating on the situation \r\nin the Middle East, a region where the quest for peace \r\nand stability continues. The situation in Syria has added \r\nnew complexities and uncertainties to the regional \r\nsituation. For its part, Pakistan will continue to support \r\nefforts for a peaceful resolution of the Syrian conflict, \r\none that reflects the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian \r\npeople. It is the international community’s collective \r\nresponsibility to prevent escalation of the Syrian \r\nsituation and its spillover to neighbouring countries.\r\nIt is regrettable that there has been no movement \r\non the agreed two-State solution for the long-standing \r\nPalestinian issue, although it has been debated \r\nfrequently in the Council. It is ironic that the Council’s \r\nown resolutions have not been respected, most \r\nnotably those on the construction of settlements in the \r\noccupied territory and the blockade of Gaza. We have \r\nconsistently urged Council members to demonstrate \r\ngreater political will to ensure implementation of the \r\nCouncil’s resolutions. Pakistan supports a sovereign, \r\nindependent, viable and contiguous State of Palestine, \r\nliving side by side with all its neighbours in peace and \r\nsecurity.\r\nDivisive approaches and positions undermine the \r\nCouncil’s authority and vitiate the environment for \r\ndecision-making. Pakistan believes that unity within \r\nthe Council will enable it to take effective collective \r\naction. We support efforts to foster consensus and \r\npromote cohesiveness in the Council, so that we can \r\nwork for the overarching goal of international peace \r\nand security.\r\nThe views of the general membership on the \r\nwork of the Security Council are of fundamental \r\nimportance for the Council itself in reviewing its \r\nperformance and making improvements where \r\nrequired. Apart from this annual debate, the general \r\nmembership should have more opportunities to give its \r\nfeedback throughout the year.\r\nAs a current non-permanent member, serving for \r\nthe seventh time in the Council, we can say candidly \r\nthat there is room for improving the Council’s working \r\nmethods, particularly with regard to transparency \r\nand inclusiveness. Non-permanent members, who are \r\nelected by the General Assembly and are therefore \r\naccountable to the general membership, have an added \r\nresponsibility to help improve the Council’s methods and \r\nprocedures. Pakistan has therefore actively contributed \r\nto the discussion on the subject in the Council and in its \r\nInformal Working Group on Documentation and Other \r\nProcedural Questions.\r\nI now turn to the second item on the agenda \r\ntoday — Security Council reform. Pakistan supports \r\na comprehensive reform that would make the Security \r\nCouncil democratic in composition, effective in \r\ndecision-making and accountable to the general \r\nmembership. We believe that Council reform should \r\ntranscend current global power politics. Reform \r\nshould not only be based on contemporary realities but \r\nshould also take into account the likely changes in the \r\nfuture. Our approach should be dynamic, not static or \r\nanachronistic.\r\nPakistan believes that modest expansion of the \r\nCouncil by adding new electable seats would make it \r\nmore representative and transparent and would ensure \r\nits relevance to present and emerging global realities. \r\nNew seats based on periodic elections would also \r\nmake the Council more equitable, diverse and plural \r\nin terms of representation, as well as more open and \r\naccountable, to reflect the aspirations of the general \r\nmembership. Such a reform model would enhance \r\nownership of the Security Council and increase its \r\ncredibility.\r\nSecurity Council reform remains a contentious \r\nissue. No single model enjoys the requisite support \r\nof Member States. To make progress, it is therefore \r\nessential to explore common middle ground through \r\nf lexibility and compromise.\r\nOriginally, Pakistan sought expansion only in the \r\nnon-permanent category. But now Pakistan, along with \r\nother members of the Uniting for Consensus group, \r\nsupports the proposal for long-term seats as explained \r\nin the Italy/Colombia proposal. The fact is that it is the \r\nonly compromise proposal on the table.\r\n12-59231 3\r\nA/67/PV.39\r\nOur proposal does not serve the interest of its \r\nauthors but rather offers a collective bargain to reform a \r\nUnited Nations organ whose membership and ownership \r\nis shared by all States. Our proposal has the capacity to \r\nabsorb and accommodate present and future realities. \r\nIn a rapidly changing global geopolitical landscape, \r\nour proposal rises above individual national ambitions. \r\nIt ref lects the political configuration of the real world, \r\nin which a few large States, a number of medium-\r\nsized States, a majority of small States and regional \r\norganizations will be able to play their role effectively \r\nto promote international peace and security. \r\nThe Italy/Colombia paper is a realistic basis for \r\nforward movement in the reform process. Unlike other \r\nproposals on the table, it is not a take-it-or-leave-it \r\noffer. It provides a framework for real dialogue on an \r\nachievable final outcome. The proposal also serves the \r\ndual purpose of modestly expanding the Council while \r\nensuring wider representation for regional and cross-\r\nregional groups such as the African Union and the \r\nOrganization of Islamic Cooperation.\r\nWith a view to building bridges, we will continue \r\nto reach out to various groups, including the Forum \r\nof Small States and the African Group. Pakistan, as a \r\nmember of Uniting for Consensus, wishes to engage \r\nclosely with diverse groups in order to share and \r\nunderstand one another’s perspectives and pursue \r\nour common objectives. We respect and support the \r\nAfrican common position. Africa’s just demand for a \r\npermanent presence on the Security Council is made \r\non behalf of the entire continent. It is therefore different \r\nfrom the demands of those seeking permanent seats \r\nfor themselves. We see adequate space in the Uniting \r\nfor Consensus reform model to accommodate the \r\nAfrican position as a special case based on a concept of \r\ncontinent-specific seats. We strongly believe that any \r\nsolution that excludes Africa or African participation \r\nwill be incomplete and therefore untenable.\r\nUnder the current Assembly presidency, real \r\nprogress towards Security Council reform is possible. \r\nWe welcome the President’s letter of 9 November and \r\nappreciate the wide consultations he has held. We agree \r\nwith him that predictability and full transparency \r\nremain essential ingredients in the ongoing process. \r\nWe welcome the reappointment of Ambassador Zahir \r\nTanin as chair of the intergovernmental negotiations. \r\nThe issues on the table are sensitive and the positions \r\ndivergent. It is our earnest hope that the Chair will be \r\nattentive to all viewpoints and concerns, and we appeal \r\nto him to be so. Transparency is a precondition for \r\neffective and inclusive work. \r\nThe intergovernmental negotiation schedule should \r\nbe formulated through consultations under the overall \r\nguidance of the President of the General Assembly. We \r\nstress the Member State-driven nature of the negotiating \r\nprocess. Proposals and recommendations that have \r\nnot been mandated or agreed on by the membership \r\ncannot form a basis for our work. An important \r\nlesson learned in the past two years of the process of \r\nintergovernmental negotiations is that divisive tactics, \r\npiecemeal approaches, showdowns on issues of choice, \r\nand majority-minority claims only prolong the impasse \r\nand vitiate the atmosphere for negotiations. We must \r\navoid such pitfalls in the current session. The reform \r\nprocess cannot be held hostage to individual national \r\npursuits of permanent seats through self-serving drafts \r\nthat have failed to garner any support. It is time to \r\nproceed in a spirit of f lexibility, based on the agreed \r\nprinciples of decision 62/557.\r\nI conclude by commending the role of the President \r\nof the Assembly in steering the process of Security \r\nCouncil reform. He has a focused, hands-on, fair, \r\nimpartial and inclusive approach. We admire it and \r\nsupport his efforts in that regard. We assure him of our \r\nfull cooperation.\r\nMr. Núñez Mosquera (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nCuba takes note of the report of the Security Council \r\n(A/67/2) and notes with concern that it continues to \r\nbe fundamentally stuck in descriptive mode, lacking \r\nthe analytic focus that Member States need for an \r\nin-depth assessment of its work. In that connection, \r\nmy delegation insists on the need for the Council to \r\npresent special reports to the General Assembly, in \r\nfulfilment of paragraph 1 of Article 15 and paragraph 3 \r\nof Article 24 of the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nThe Members of the United Nations have \r\nentrusted that body of limited membership the \r\nfundamental responsibility for acting on our behalf in \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security. \r\nHowever, in discharging those functions, the Security \r\nCouncil is obliged to act in accordance with the \r\npurposes and principles of the United Nations, as laid \r\ndown in paragraph 2 of Article 24 of the Charter. Cuba \r\nwould like to point out the Council’s responsibility to \r\ngive due account to the Assembly and to comply with \r\nthe provisions of the Charter.\r\n4 12-59231\r\nA/67/PV.39\r\nRegarding agenda item 117, Cuba reiterates the \r\nneed to accomplish an urgent and thorough reform of \r\nthe Security Council. Genuine United Nations reform \r\ncan come about only when the Council is democratized \r\nand becomes a truly transparent structure that acts \r\nin a way that is consistent with the rule of law at \r\nthe international level and deals appropriately with \r\nchallenges around the globe.\r\nSecurity Council reform cannot continue to \r\nbe postponed as a goal of the United Nations. The \r\nCouncil’s necessary transformation is an imperative for \r\nthe international community, and ignoring that demand \r\nis not only damaging but is an insult to the Member \r\nStates. Our delegation supports immediate expansion of \r\nthe Council in both membership categories, permanent \r\nand non-permanent. Other supposed alternatives, \r\nsuch as increasing only the number of non-permanent \r\nseats, would merely prolong the current problems, \r\nfurther widening the already enormous gap between \r\npermanent and non-permanent members. It is extremely \r\nunfair that currently, with its agenda plagued with \r\nitems related to Africa, the Security Council has no \r\npermanent representative from that continent, or from \r\nLatin America and the Caribbean. Nothing justifies \r\nthis lack of permanent participation on the part of the \r\ndeveloping countries in an organ of major importance \r\nin the Organization.\r\nCuba does not support discrimination of any kind \r\namong sovereign States. Our country unreservedly \r\nrespects the principles of the Charter and of international \r\nlaw, and we therefore believe that any new permanent \r\nmembers should have the same rights and obligations \r\nas the present ones. The admission of new permanent \r\nmembers without veto power would be equivalent to \r\ncreating a new category of Council members, which \r\nCuba does not favour. There is no justification for \r\ndeveloping countries entering as new permanent \r\nmembers having a lesser status than the current ones.\r\nCuba’s position has been and continues to be \r\nvery clear with regard to the veto. The veto should \r\nbe eliminated as soon as possible. That privilege has \r\nbecome anachronistic and antidemocratic. It is offensive \r\nthat the will of the international community, which \r\nis expressed through General Assembly resolutions, \r\nhas no impact in resolving global problems and that, \r\ninstead, in the Security Council, everything is reduced \r\nto the will or opinion of one country or a limited \r\nnumber of countries which, because of the right of the \r\nveto, throws out and ignores the voice of the members \r\nof the Organization.\r\nWith regard to the size of the Security Council, Cuba \r\nbelieves that an enlarged Council should include no \r\nless than 26 members. With that figure, the proportion \r\nbetween the number of Security Council members and \r\nthe overall membership of the United Nations would be \r\nsimilar to that which existed when the United Nations \r\nwas created. \r\nReform of the Security Council should encompass \r\na far-reaching transformation. We cannot transform the \r\nstructures if we do not change the working methods, \r\nprocedures and practices. The Council’s working \r\nmethods must evolve. Although some modest changes \r\nhave taken place in recent years, most of them have \r\nbeen more formal than substantive. \r\nThe reality today is that the Security Council is not \r\ntransparent, democratic or effective, much less does \r\nits work represent the interests of the international \r\ncommunity. Cuba advocates and calls for the creation \r\nof a Security Council in which closed consultations are \r\nthe exception. We hope to see a Council that deals with \r\nthe issues that properly fall to it, with an agenda that \r\nincludes genuine international challenges and does not \r\nencroach upon issues that are within the competence \r\nof other United Nations organs. Cuba wants to see a \r\nSecurity Council that takes into account the opinions \r\nof the membership of the Organization before it adopts \r\ndecisions and that ensures genuine access to States that \r\nare not members of that body.\r\nUrgent actions are required. We cannot prolong \r\nthis debate any further. Reform of the Security Council \r\nrequires urgent, genuine negotiations, in which the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly has a fundamental \r\nrole to play in promoting progress. It is imperative to \r\ntransform the current reality and eliminate the failings \r\nand the lack of transparency, democracy and efficiency \r\nin the Council’s work. We cannot afford the luxury \r\nof waiting forever for the will of the international \r\ncommunity and the mandates of the General Assembly \r\nto be fulfilled.\r\nMr. Sin Son Ho (Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea): First of all, I would like to take this opportunity \r\nto express my confidence that, under the President’s able \r\nleadership, realistic and innovative proposals aimed at \r\nreforming the Security Council will be devised through \r\nthe current intergovernmental negotiations.\r\n12-59231 5\r\nA/67/PV.39\r\nThe current agenda item provides a good \r\nopportunity for the General Assembly to assess the work \r\nof the Security Council under the Charter of the United \r\nNations and improve its working methods. The work of \r\nthe Security Council in the period under review can be \r\ncharacterized by a lack of impartiality and credibility \r\nand abuse of power. In particular, the Council continues \r\nto be misused as a tool by a few countries to ignore all \r\nprinciples of international relations, including those \r\nrelated to sovereign equality, respect for sovereignty \r\nand non-interference in the internal affairs of States, \r\nand to legitimize their unilateral actions to further their \r\nown interests. \r\nA typical example is that of the United States \r\nand its blind followers, who pressured the Security \r\nCouncil to adopt a presidential statement on \r\n16 April 2012 (S/PRST/2012/13) and condemned the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea for launching \r\na satellite for peaceful purposes. As we are all aware, \r\nthe transparency and peaceful nature of the launch of \r\nour satellite was fully covered in various media, going \r\nbeyond what is required by standard international \r\npractice in the field. The United States argument that \r\nthe satellite launch by the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea was in fact the launch of a long-range ballistic \r\nmissile was denied by the international mass media \r\nfollowing confirmation of the facts. Nevertheless, the \r\nUnited States ridiculously went on to demand that \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic not launch even a \r\npeaceful satellite. \r\nOur satellite launch was an exercise of a legitimate \r\nright granted to the States parties to the Treaty on \r\nPrinciples Governing the Activities of States in the \r\nExploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon \r\nand Other Celestial Bodies, which stands above Security \r\nCouncil resolutions. The Council has never considered \r\na single one of the innumerable launches of satellites \r\nworldwide, including of military satellites, except for \r\nour satellite launch for peaceful purposes. That clearly \r\nreflects the deeply rooted hostile policy of the United \r\nStates towards my country, the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea, and it implies extreme selectivity, \r\ndouble standards and violation of international law. \r\nThat is a stark reality today, and it serves as a tool for \r\nthe interests of the United States and other Powers, \r\ngiving rise to distrust of the Security Council’s work \r\namong the Member States, as the Council is far from \r\nhonouring its mandate to maintain international peace \r\nand security. \r\nThe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea will \r\ncontinue to exercise the sovereign right to use outer \r\nspace, as enshrined in universal international law, \r\nwhich stand above Security Council resolutions. The \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic will continue to expand \r\nand intensify its outer space development institutions. \r\nIt will launch application satellites, including the \r\ngeostationary satellites necessary for national economic \r\ndevelopment in line with its national space programme.\r\nI now come to the agenda item on the reform of the \r\nSecurity Council. The ongoing reform of the Council’s \r\nundemocratic working methods should be taken up as a \r\ntop priority and without delay. In order to play its role \r\nto the fullest as the authoritative body for maintaining \r\ninternational peace and security, the Security Council \r\nshould be impartial in its activities, as stipulated in the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. To that end, we must \r\nurgently create a mechanism whereby Security Council \r\nresolutions on sanctions and the use of armed force, \r\nwhich greatly affect international peace and security, \r\nwould come into force only when they are approved \r\nby the General Assembly, as widely requested by \r\ninternational society. \r\nFurthermore, the Security Council should enhance \r\nits credibility among Member States by respecting \r\nand reflecting the views of concerned countries in its \r\nconsideration of major issues. It is also important to put \r\nan end to the Council practice whereby it abuses issues \r\nthat fall within the mandate of the General Assembly, \r\nincluding economic, social and development issues.  It \r\ncreates obstacles to carrying out the work of the General \r\nAssembly and even weakens its authority.\r\nIntergovernmental negotiations, which are being \r\nheld for the third time this year, will provide a good \r\nopportunity to promote mutual understanding and \r\nreduce the differences between the groups through \r\nin-depth discussions on the Security Council reform \r\nproposals, including that of the group of countries \r\nthat sponsored A/61/L.69/Rev.1. My delegation is of \r\nthe view that, in order to make substantial progress \r\nin the intergovernmental negotiations on Security \r\nCouncil reform, primary attention should be paid to the \r\nfollowing issues. \r\nFirst, Security Council reform should be oriented \r\ntowards realizing the adequate representation of \r\ndeveloping countries. The basic configuration of the \r\nSecurity Council was decided 67 years ago. The Security \r\nCouncil was originally made up of 11 member States, \r\nwith six elected members and a total United Nations \r\n6 12-59231\r\nA/67/PV.39\r\nmembership of 51 States in 1945. In 1965, the number \r\nof Security Council members was increased to 15, with \r\n10 elected members. Now, the changed reality of the \r\ntwenty-first century necessitates a further increase in \r\nthe Security Council membership, in conformity with \r\nthe growth in the number of States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations to 193. \r\nThe developing countries in Asia, Africa and Latin \r\nAmerica were colonies when the United Nations was \r\ncreated. But today those countries have all gained \r\nindependence and constitute an overwhelming majority \r\nin the membership of the United Nations. Therefore, \r\nthe enlargement of the Security Council is essentially \r\nan issue of increasing the representation of developing \r\ncountries. From the viewpoint of today’s changing \r\ninternational relations, developing countries from the \r\ncontinents of Asia, Africa and Latin America should \r\nbe represented in desirable positions in the United \r\nNations, as they are the biggest political force. \r\nSecondly, the most reasonable way to reform the \r\nSecurity Council is to resolve issues on a point-by-point \r\nbasis, beginning with an issue on which an agreement \r\ncan be reached. My delegation is of the view that the \r\nmost reasonable and practical way of expanding the \r\nSecurity Council at present is to go ahead with the \r\nexpansion of the non-permanent category first, while \r\nputting off the issue of the expansion of the permanent \r\nmembership for the time being, in the light of the \r\nserious differences and different views still existing \r\namong countries. \r\nIn the case of enlargement of the permanent \r\nmembership, it is agreed that those countries that \r\nare capable of making genuine contributions to the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security should \r\nbe accepted as permanent members. In that regard, \r\nJapan cannot be regarded as eligible to be a permanent \r\nmember of the Security Council. In the past, Japan \r\ninflicted all sorts of unprecedented suffering and \r\nmisfortune upon the Asian people, including the Korean \r\npeople, but it is still reluctant to offer a sincere apology \r\nand full compensation for its crimes against humanity. \r\nFurthermore, Japan revised its middle-school history \r\ntextbooks to justify its past crimes against humanity \r\nand openly disclosed its militaristic ambitions by \r\ncontinuing to pray at the Yasukuni shrine and take \r\naction aimed at becoming a military Power. \r\nIt is crystal clear that Japan, which is moving \r\nagainst the current trend of peace and development, \r\nhas no political or moral qualifications and is totally \r\nunqualified to become a permanent member of the \r\nSecurity Council. Before seeking a permanent seat on \r\nthe Security Council, Japan should gain the trust of \r\nthe international community by, among other things, \r\nrecognizing, apologizing and compensating for the \r\ninvasion of Korea and other Asian countries and the \r\nextraordinary crimes against humanity committed in \r\nthe past. \r\nThe Security Council reform should be aimed at \r\nenabling the Council to fully discharge its primary \r\nmandate of maintaining global peace and security, \r\nbased on the purposes and principles of the Charter. \r\nIf unilateralism, high-handedness and unusual force \r\non the part of a certain country remains prevalent in \r\nthe work of the Security Council, the Council will fail \r\nto fulfil its mandate as an organ for securing peace, \r\nand eventually it will be degraded as a tool serving the \r\ninterests of the so-called super-Powers. \r\nIn conclusion, my delegation is looking forward to \r\nSecurity Council reform, in conformity with the ever-\r\ngrowing demand and aspirations of Member States to \r\ndemocratize the United Nations.\r\nMr. Manjeev Singh Puri (India): I am honoured to \r\naddress the General Assembly on behalf of my country \r\non the question of equitable representation on and \r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council and \r\nother matters related to the Security Council. At the \r\noutset, let me place on record the Indian delegation’s \r\nappreciation for the commitment that  the President \r\nhas shown towards that important issue. We welcome \r\nthe reappointment of the highly experienced and wise \r\nAmbassador Zahir Tanin of Afghanistan as chair of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. His letter of July 2012, \r\nwhich captured the main elements of the eighth round \r\nof intergovernmental negotiations that were held during \r\nthe previous General Assembly session, as well as the \r\nrecommendations contained in the letter, are worthy \r\nof in-depth consideration during the current General \r\nAssembly session. We therefore call upon Ambassador \r\nTanin, through the President of the General Assembly, \r\nto convene a meeting of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations as soon as possible. We would also \r\nlike to associate ourselves with the statement of the \r\ngroup of countries that sponsored A/61/L.69/Rev.1, \r\ndelivered by Ambassador Raymond Wolfe of Jamaica \r\n(see A/67/PV.38). \r\nIndia played an important role in ensuring that the \r\nprocess of intergovernmental negotiations on Security \r\nCouncil reform was initiated and has played an active \r\n12-59231 7\r\nA/67/PV.39\r\nrole in the deliberations ever since their commencement \r\nin 2009. The current state of play in those negotiations \r\nwas ably summed up by the Ministers for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Group of Four (G-4) countries in their \r\njoint press statement of 25 September. They stated that \r\n“an overwhelming majority of Member States \r\nvoiced support for an expansion of the Security \r\nCouncil in both categories of membership, \r\npermanent and non-permanent.” \r\nFurther, the Ministers expressed the view that \r\nthe strong support for an expansion in both categories \r\nshould be reflected in the negotiation process among \r\nMember States and called for the drafting of a concise \r\nworking document as the basis for further negotiations \r\nin line with the recommendations of the chair of the \r\nnegotiations. I would like to take this opportunity to \r\nreiterate the calls made by the G-4 Foreign Ministers \r\nand to express the determination of the Indian \r\ndelegation to work towards the realization of those \r\nends in the intergovernmental negotiations during the \r\ncurrent session.\r\nIndia is also a member of a group of developing \r\ncountries called the L.69 group. That group has been \r\nmost vocal and articulate in expressing the fervent desire \r\namong its membership for early reform of the Security \r\nCouncil in order to make it ref lective of contemporary \r\nreality and also acknowledge the manifold changes that \r\nhave taken place in the world since the Council was \r\ncreated in 1945.\r\nIt is therefore not at all surprising that the \r\nconvergences between the L.69 group and the African \r\nStates are increasing day by day. Members have heard \r\nAmbassador Raymond Wolfe clearly express the \r\nposition of L.69 group on the question of the veto. Let \r\nme reiterate that we also support African aspirations \r\nfor permanent membership with the veto. \r\nThere is also considerable convergence among \r\nthe wider membership on other aspects. We have not \r\nyet heard one dissonant voice in respect of enhanced \r\nrepresentation for Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, the \r\nLatin American and Caribbean region and Western \r\nEuropean and other States, as well as an exclusive \r\nnon-permanent seat for the small island developing \r\nStates. The reformed Council is expected to have a size \r\nin the mid-20s.\r\nFinally, the membership also wants the Council \r\nto continually improve its working methods and to \r\nsee the General Assembly transform itself into the \r\nchief deliberative, legislative, policy-making and \r\nrepresentative body of the international community.\r\nIn conclusion, let me reiterate that India is of the \r\nview that the reform and expansion of the Security \r\nCouncil are essential if it is to reflect the contemporary \r\nreality. Such an outcome will enhance the Council’s \r\ncredibility and effectiveness in dealing with global \r\nissues. The early reform of the Security Council must be \r\npursued with renewed vigour and be urgently enacted. \r\nLet me also assure the President and the rest of the \r\nmembership of our willingness to remain constructive \r\non all issues on the table in the months to come. We \r\nurge other delegations to do likewise.\r\nMs. King (Australia): I thank the President for \r\nconvening this joint debate on the annual report of the \r\nSecurity Council (A/67/2) and on Security Council \r\nreform. I also wish to thank the Security Council \r\nPresident, Ambassador Puri of India, for introducing \r\nthe report this morning, and the Colombian delegation, \r\nunder the leadership of Ambassador Osorio, for its \r\ncareful preparation of the report.\r\nThe information contained in the report \r\nis a very important catalogue of the Council’s \r\nactivity — achievements and failings alike — and, as \r\nsuch, the report is an essential element in the Council’s \r\nefforts to strengthen transparency regarding its \r\ndeliberations. However, as others have said today and \r\npreviously, strengthening the substantive elements of \r\nthe report could only further assist that transparency. \r\nAs Australia has said many times before, transparency \r\nis directly related to accountability for the Council’s \r\ndecisions.\r\nThe events of the past intensive year of work on \r\nthe part of the Council have reinforced its critical role \r\nin maintaining peace and security. How effective the \r\nCouncil is in fulfilling its fundamental remit depends \r\non the United Nations membership’s efforts to ensure \r\nthat effectiveness. The more representative, accessible \r\nand accountable the Council is, the better positioned \r\nit is to meet the globe’s complex security challenges. \r\nWe Member States need to intensify our efforts at \r\nthis General Assembly session to achieve meaningful \r\nreform.\r\nFor Australia, Security Council reform has been \r\na long-standing priority. We argued strenuously at the \r\nSan Francisco Conference in 1945 for limits on the \r\nuse of the veto. At that time, we also advocated the \r\nimportance of transparency in the Council’s work. We \r\n8 12-59231\r\nA/67/PV.39\r\nTo conclude, Australia pledges its full support for \r\nthe ongoing discussions on Security Council reform. \r\nWe are committed to working closely and pragmatically \r\nwith Ambassador Tanin and the membership to \r\novercome the current stalemate and move to genuine \r\nnegotiations. It is apparent, however, that to get to that \r\nstage delegations will have to show greater f lexibility \r\nand some creativity in order to surmount the strong \r\ngeopolitical obstacles that stand in our way.\r\nMr. Motanyane (Lesotho): I thank the President \r\nfor convening this very important meeting. I also wish \r\nto thank the Permanent Representative of India, in his \r\ncapacity as President of the Security Council for the \r\nmonth of November, for presenting the annual report of \r\nthe Council (A/67/2) before this body and the delegation \r\nof Colombia for its contribution to the production of \r\nthat report. Allow me at the outset to align myself with \r\nthe statements delivered at  the 38th meeting by the \r\nPermanent Representatives of Egypt and of Algeria on \r\nbehalf of the Non-Aligned Movement and the African \r\nGroup, respectively.\r\nPeace-loving nations came together in 1945 to \r\nunite their strength in order to maintain international \r\npeace and security. That sacred duty was conferred on \r\nthe Security Council, for the Council to exercise it on \r\nbehalf of all States Members of the United Nations. In \r\nthat light, we view the presentation of the report of the \r\nCouncil to the General Assembly not as a ritualistic \r\nevent that has to be performed in order to fulfil the \r\nrequirements of the Charter but, more importantly, as \r\nan opportunity to account for actions taken on behalf \r\nof the entire United Nations membership. Furthermore, \r\nthat presents a chance for the Council to interact with \r\nMember States and receive feedback on how to build on \r\nthe gains made in the discharge of its mandate.\r\nThe report of the Security Council for the period \r\n1 August 2011 to 31 July 2012 is not materially different \r\nfrom the Council’s previous annual reports to the \r\nGeneral Assembly. Whereas there has been a surge in \r\nthe number of open meetings held by the Council during \r\nthe reporting period, the report nevertheless offers no \r\nanalysis of the impact and influence, if any, that those \r\nmeetings have had on the decisions and resolutions that \r\nthe Council took during the period in question.\r\nOpen meetings promote transparency and \r\ninclusivity and undoubtedly afford the larger United \r\nNations membership a rare chance to contribute to the \r\nwork of the Council. It is mainly through those meetings \r\nthat the Council can get to know the views of other \r\nremain firmly committed to those principles today. As \r\nan elected member of the Security Council from 2013 \r\nfor a two-year term, Australia will advocate and support \r\ninitiatives that enhance the Council’s accessibility and \r\ntransparency. We also wish to see progress on that score \r\nat this sixty-seventh session of the General Assembly.\r\nWe welcome the advice of the President on the \r\nreappointment of Ambassador Tanin as chair of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform. We consider that, under his continued \r\nstewardship, there is and should be scope for us to \r\ncollectively gather momentum in the forthcoming \r\nrounds of the intergovernmental negotiations.\r\nIn anticipation of those negotiations, allow me \r\nto reiterate that we support an expansion of the \r\nCouncil in both the permanent and the non-permanent \r\ncategories, while balancing the need for enhanced \r\nrepresentation in the Council with the practical \r\nrequirement of maintaining decision-making cohesion \r\nand effectiveness. We remain prepared to assist the \r\nnegotiations by showing f lexibility and creativity to \r\nfind solutions. As others have said today, we have a \r\nvery clear sense of where we all stand on those issues. \r\nIt is now time to find some common ground.\r\nOn the question of membership, Australia strongly \r\nsupports the inclusion of permanent representation from \r\nAfrica on the Council. African countries comprise more \r\nthan a quarter of the United Nations membership and \r\ncontribute some two thirds of the Security Council’s \r\nagenda. It is proper that the African continent take its \r\npermanent place in the Council’s deliberations.\r\nAustralia also considers that, without prejudice to \r\nthe achievement of reform on all five aspects of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations, we can collectively \r\nrealize immediate and tangible benefits in improving \r\nthe Council’s working methods. Australia considered \r\nthat the draft resolution (A/66/L.42/Rev.2) introduced \r\nin May this year by the representative of the then group \r\nof five small nations contained some very reasonable \r\nmeasures that were consistent with our own ambitions \r\nfor a more transparent and accessible Security Council. \r\nWe were disappointed that the draft resolution was not \r\ntaken forward. We would like to see efforts this year to \r\nenhance the way in which the Council operates. In that \r\ncontext, we acknowledge the progress achieved in the \r\nCouncil’s Informal Working Group on Documentation \r\nand Other Procedural Questions and in particular thank \r\nAmbassador Cabral of Portugal for his efforts.\r\n12-59231 9\r\nA/67/PV.39\r\non Council reform are a matter of common knowledge. \r\nBut there is still discord as to what shape and size a \r\nreformed Council should take. Today’s debate gives us \r\nan opportunity to reflect on how to move the process \r\nforward without further delay.\r\nToday, there are too many factors that speak to \r\nthe necessity for Security Council reform. Nations are \r\nrising up against dictatorial regimes in defence of their \r\nbasic human rights and freedoms. People are standing \r\nup to political oppression. In some countries, that \r\nquest for freedom, human rights and democracy is met \r\nwith atrocious force and brutality. Innocent civilians, \r\nwomen and children, suffering the brunt of brutal \r\nregimes, look to the United Nations for help. Sadly, \r\nthe multilateral system is struggling to respond to such \r\nchallenges in a coordinated way. Individual interests \r\nin the Council continue to dominate the collective will \r\nof the majority. Owing to its anachronistic nature, the \r\nSecurity Council remains largely inept at fulfilling \r\nits mandate; hence the need for its reform. Double \r\nstandards have always characterized its work and have \r\nbeen a major impediment to building a safer and more \r\nsecure world.\r\nThe adoption of decision 62/557 ushered in new \r\nhope that the determination to comprehensively reform \r\nthe Council is our shared ideal. We agreed on the scope \r\nof the negotiable elements, which include the size of \r\nan expanded Council; categories of membership; \r\nregional representation; veto power; working methods \r\nand the relationship between the Council and the \r\nGeneral Assembly. It is the view of my delegation \r\nthat decision 62/557 should continue to be the basis \r\nfor Security Council reform negotiations, if we are \r\nto realize our goal of having a Council that reflects \r\nmodern geopolitical realities.\r\nWe need no reminding that Security Council reform \r\nis an integral part of strengthening the United Nations \r\nsystem. We must therefore negotiate in good faith and \r\nmutual respect. Reform must take into account the \r\ninterests and concerns of all Member States, especially \r\nthose currently underrepresented. Needless to say, \r\nthe expansion of the Council in both categories is \r\nan answer to Africa’s absence from the permanent \r\ncategory and underrepresentation in the non-permanent \r\ncategory. The reform we pursue should be genuine and \r\ncomprehensive. A piecemeal approach would only \r\nperpetuate the status quo, which is clearly untenable.\r\nWe must refrain from taking steps that could \r\nundermine the current momentum. Our goal should \r\nMember States on the issues of which it is seized. They \r\nshould not be held just for the sake of accommodating \r\nnon-Council members. My delegation urges the Council \r\nto consider reflecting, in its report, the general views of \r\nMember States on issues with which it has dealt and to \r\nwhat extent those views have been of value to its work \r\nin its future reports.\r\nMoreover, we note that the Council has continued \r\nits engagement with troop- and police-contributing \r\ncountries. We encourage continuation of that practice. \r\nThe Council may wish to consider incorporating \r\nsuch engagements into its timetable of meetings, as \r\nappropriate. By the same token, we urge the Council to \r\nconsider increasing the frequency of its engagements \r\nwith Member States and other stakeholders using \r\nplatforms such as Arria-formula meetings. Intensive \r\nengagement with Council members will foster Member \r\nStates’ confidence in the Council and thereby dispel \r\nmisunderstandings between them and the Council.\r\nWe note that the Council has had to deal with \r\ncomplex conflict situations in Africa and elsewhere. \r\nHowever, the report is largely a narration of events \r\nand meetings, along with an enumeration of decisions \r\nor resolutions adopted during the reporting period. It \r\nwould be better if the report were more detailed and \r\nanalytical with regard to the challenges that the Council \r\nhas faced in fulfilling its mandate; how its efforts affect \r\npeace processes in conflict areas; and, if the level of \r\ncompliance with its resolutions varies, what causes that \r\nvariability and how the Council intends to solve it. We \r\nare confident that the Council will rise to the occasion \r\nin future and present reports to the Assembly that will \r\nshed more light on its internal dynamics.\r\nAllow me at this juncture to turn to the question of \r\nSecurity Council reform. The President’s commitment \r\nto continuing the process of reforming the Council is \r\nindeed encouraging. We welcome the reappointment of \r\nAmbassador Tanin as chair of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations, and assure him of our support during the \r\nsixty-seventh session. We are confident that under his \r\nleadership we will make considerable progress.\r\nThe need for early reform of the Security Council \r\nwas universally agreed on by the international \r\ncommunity at the World Summit in 2005. Yet, seven \r\nyears later, negotiations on reforming the Council \r\nstill show little progress. Member States have had \r\nopportunities to state and rehash their positions \r\nduring the multiple rounds of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations held so far. Consequently, all our positions \r\n10 12-59231\r\nA/67/PV.39\r\nalways be to manage the process in such a way that \r\nwe achieve results. We must look at the larger picture \r\nand not make our individual aspirations a priority. Let \r\nus approach reform of the Council with open minds, \r\nmaking the necessary compromises, while at the same \r\ntime respecting differences of opinion. As we do so, let \r\nus ensure that all our initiatives benefit from the views \r\nof the great majority of the membership. Transparency \r\nand inclusivity in the steps we take will be key to \r\nour success. It is our hope that real negotiations will \r\ncommence soon.\r\nI wish to conclude by pointing out that, if we stay \r\nmired in our irreconcilable differences on how to reform \r\nthe Security Council, the United Nations will remain \r\nas it was 67 years ago and will become increasingly \r\nirrelevant to the modern-day world. We must therefore \r\nallow nothing to dissuade us from realizing our goal \r\nof a reformed and democratic Security Council. With \r\nrenewed political will and determination, we can give \r\nimpetus to the negotiations and thus be able to agree on \r\na reform model that reflects the realities of the twenty-\r\nfirst century.\r\nMr. Balé (Republic of the Congo) (spoke in \r\nFrench): I would first like to say that the Republic of \r\nthe Congo subscribes fully to the statements delivered \r\non behalf of the African Group and the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement. I would also like to thank Ambassador \r\nHardeep Singh Puri for his presentation of the report \r\non the activities of the Security Council for the period \r\n1 August 2011 to 31 July 2012 (A/67/2). In that regard, \r\nI would like to convey my delegation’s appreciation for \r\nthat body’s efforts to fulfil the mission entrusted to it \r\nby the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nWhile the report is exhaustive and can be said to \r\ngive a full account of the many activities undertaken by \r\nthe Security Council, it tells us little about the challenges \r\nthat that body, which bears principal responsibility for \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security, has \r\nhad to deal with during the period under consideration, \r\nparticularly in the area of preventing and managing \r\nvarious crises and conflicts. That is why my delegation \r\nconsiders that the improvements apparent in the \r\npresentation of the report do not obviate the necessity \r\nof making it more analytical and a better expression of \r\nthe views of its members, which would illuminate the \r\nchallenges more clearly.\r\nNevertheless, my delegation welcomes the creation \r\nof the United Nations Regional Office for Central \r\nAfrica as a response to the desire of the States in our \r\nsubregion to have a tool that can henceforth support \r\nthem in their efforts to prevent conflict and build peace. \r\nThat is part of a healthy trend demonstrating that the \r\nSecurity Council is involved in preventing conflict and \r\npromoting peace.\r\nSimilarly, the Republic of the Congo, as a member \r\nof the African Union Peace and Security Council, \r\nwelcomes the improved cooperation between that \r\nregional body and the United Nations Security \r\nCouncil, and hopes that that will lend momentum to \r\nthe promotion of peace and security in Africa, a region \r\nwhere more than half the issues on the Council’s agenda \r\noriginate.\r\nI take this opportunity offered by this debate \r\non fair representation in the Security Council and \r\nexpansion of its membership to commend the facilitator \r\nof the intergovernmental negotiations on Security \r\nCouncil reform, Ambassador Zahir Tanin, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Afghanistan, for his leadership and \r\nthe energy he has poured into that endeavour since \r\n2009. Our discussion of the Security Council’s report \r\ngives us yet another chance to assess the development \r\nof a process that has proven to be very challenging and \r\nto consider our future course of action. \r\nAll living organisms must evolve. The Security \r\nCouncil, which bears the primary responsibility for \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security \r\nand which we want to see become more transparent, \r\nmore energized, more democratic and more adapted to \r\nthe realities of the current world, is no exception. From \r\nthat point of view, we expect that the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations begun on 19 February 2009 on the issues \r\nof fair representation in the Security Council, the \r\nexpansion of its membership and related questions will \r\nlead, through consensus, to some concrete results and \r\neliminate the outmoded rejection of Security Council \r\nreform, which the world of today — and justice — call \r\nout for. \r\nGranted, differences of opinion among the various \r\ngroups and stakeholders persist, especially with regard \r\nto the question of the expansion of the membership in \r\nthe permanent and non-permanent categories. The issue \r\nof the veto is even more divisive. The matter of the \r\nSecurity Council’s working methods and its relations \r\nwith the General Assembly is less controversial but \r\nnevertheless impedes the global consensus that is \r\nneeded. Still, despite lingering differences of opinion, \r\nthe eighth cycle of discussions has shown that some \r\n12-59231 11\r\nA/67/PV.39\r\nColombia for its efforts in preparing the report during \r\nits presidency of the Council in July.\r\nWithout a doubt, the work of the Security Council \r\nseems every year to be more difficult than the previous \r\none, and that trend was clearly seen during the past \r\nmonths, when we faced several challenges in various \r\nparts of the world. The Council’s main task of effectively \r\naddressing challenges and maintaining international \r\npeace and security remains critical.\r\nWe are witnessing a time when the political \r\nlandscape is dramatically changing, as people around \r\nthe world demand and fight for their rights to freedom \r\nand equal opportunity. One has to recognize that \r\nfreedom of choice is a universal principle, to which \r\nthere should be no exceptions. The Council cannot \r\nremain indifferent to those developments, and it must \r\ndeal with such issues in a comprehensive way, not as \r\nisolated, unrelated problems.\r\nMy delegation strongly supports the Council’s \r\nprioritization of its engagement in conflict prevention \r\nand mediation. Ukraine considers those two tools to be \r\nindispensable items in the Security Council’s kit. That \r\napproach was one of the main drivers of Ukraine’s only \r\nterm so far in the Council as an independent State in \r\n2000-2001. At the same time, there is still some room \r\nfor the enhancement of such activities.\r\nIn that context, we appreciate the overview \r\nprovided in the Council’s report. However, my \r\ndelegation would appreciate it if non-members of the \r\nCouncil could be updated on the issues discussed in \r\nmonthly consultations. In our view, regular substantive \r\nopen updates by the Security Council presidencies \r\nwould be equally beneficial to the Council members \r\nand to the wider United Nations membership, as \r\nthey would encourage and strengthen the overall \r\nculture of prevention and mediation on the part of the \r\nOrganization.\r\nHaving carefully studied this year’s report, we must \r\nstate that there is still room to improve the prognostic \r\nand analytical components in assessing the work of \r\nthe Council. Moreover, we support the idea that future \r\nannual reports of the Council should reflect the general \r\nviews expressed by non-members of the body during its \r\nopen debates.\r\nUkraine supports developing dialogue and \r\ncooperation between the Security Council and regional \r\norganizations working in the sphere of international \r\npeace and security, in accordance with Chapter VIII of \r\nbridging of significant divides is possible and might \r\nlead to the beginning of genuine negotiations. \r\nWe all agree that the Council needs reform. \r\nBut the reform that we call for is one that takes into \r\nconsideration regional representation, especially in the \r\ncase of Africa, which, as the Council stands now, has \r\nno representation in the permanent category. Moreover, \r\nit has become clear that throughout the negotiation \r\nprocess all Member States have agreed regarding \r\nthe historical injustice done to Africa, the only \r\ncontinent not represented in the permanent member \r\ncategory of the Security Council. The resistance on \r\nthe part of some States to draw the logical conclusions \r\nabout the way to redress that injustice sadly f lies in \r\nthe face of the unanimous acknowledgement of the \r\ninjustice and betrays a curious irrationality. \r\nIt should also be noted that the agreement between \r\nthe African Group and the group associated with draft \r\nresolution A/61/L.69/Rev.1 on the question of Security \r\nCouncil reform has, without any doubt, energized the \r\nintergovernmental negotiation process and considerably \r\nwidened Member States’ support for the common \r\nAfrican position, as set out in the Ezulwini Consensus. \r\nWe particularly welcome that development.\r\nThe reformed Security Council we envision \r\nwould be more representative, more in line with the \r\ncurrent realities of the world today, more democratic, \r\nmore transparent and more responsible in fulfilling \r\nits fundamental mission. For that to come about, the \r\nCouncil must be more attentive to the aspirations of \r\nall Member States, especially developing countries, \r\nincluding small States. \r\nIn my delegation’s view, the dynamism of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiation process over the past \r\nthree years gives reason to hope that obstacles can, \r\nbit by bit, be overcome, because delegations have so \r\noften voiced their support for Security Council reform \r\nthat they clearly show genuine political will to that \r\nend. For its part, the Congo reiterates its belief in \r\nthe principles and goals of Security Council reform \r\nand will continue to work with an open mind towards \r\nthat goal. \r\nMr. Nakonechnyi (Ukraine): At the outset, let me \r\nexpress our gratitude to the President of the Security \r\nCouncil for the month of November, the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of India, for his presentation of the \r\nannual report of the Security Council to the General \r\nAssembly (A/67/2), as well as to the delegation of \r\n12 12-59231\r\nA/67/PV.39\r\ncommitment will further guide my country’s activities \r\nin the United Nations, including in event of our election \r\nto the Security Council for the term of 2016-2017.\r\nMr. Arias (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): I welcome \r\nthe opportunity to participate in this joint debate on the \r\nannual report of the Security Council to the General \r\nAssembly (A/67/2) and on the question of Security \r\nCouncil reform. \r\nI wish to thank the Permanent Representative \r\nof India for his presentation of the Council’s report \r\nat our preceding meeting. We appreciate the effort \r\nhe is making to provide information that is of higher \r\nquality and centred more on analysis than on simply \r\nrelating the facts. We encourage him to continue in \r\nthat direction in order to improve the cooperation \r\nand interaction between the Security Council and the \r\nGeneral Assembly. Essential ingredients to achieve that \r\nobjective are transparency and greater participation of \r\nall Member States in the activities and decisions of the \r\nSecurity Council, especially on issues that affect them \r\ndirectly. \r\nI now address the question of Security Council \r\nreform. I associate myself with the statement delivered \r\nby the Italian delegation at the 38th meeting in its \r\ncapacity as focal point of the Uniting for Consensus \r\ngroup. \r\nAt the outset, I would like to express to the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly, Mr. Vuk Jeremić, \r\nSpain’s full support in the fulfilment of his role as \r\nguarantor of impartiality in conducting the process \r\nof intergovernmental negotiations. We note the \r\nreappointment of Ambassador Tanin as chair of those \r\nnegotiations. Ambassador Tanin knows he can count on \r\nSpain’s utmost support in helping him in his obligation, \r\nwhich undoubtedly is a very demanding responsibility. \r\nThe leadership roles of the Assembly President and of \r\nthe coordinator are indispensable for ensuring a good \r\nresult of the process, in which Member States alone \r\nhave the ability to make proposals. With the fulfilment \r\nof that premise and the accumulated experience gained \r\nby Ambassador Tanin, I am sure we will progress on a \r\nsolid basis on this sensitive issue. \r\nI should like to share Spain’s views on Security \r\nCouncil reform. We need to adapt the Security Council \r\nto the realities and demands of the twenty-first century. \r\nWe need a Council that is more democratic, more \r\ntransparent, more efficient, more inclined to assume \r\nits responsibilities and be accountable for them. The \r\nthe Charter. We are ready to contribute to that process \r\nin our role as Chair of the Organization for Security \r\nand Cooperation in Europe in 2013. We will be glad to \r\nshare our views on that issue and our priorities at the \r\nbriefing in the Council in February 2013.\r\nLet me now turn to the issue of Security Council \r\nreform. Ukraine considers the modernization of \r\nthe Security Council to be an issue of exceptional \r\ninternational significance. Making the Security \r\nCouncil more representative and balanced and its work \r\nmore effective and transparent, especially with regard \r\nto its decision-making process, is vital for adapting the \r\nUnited Nations to the global realities of the twenty-\r\nfirst century. Security Council reform should be \r\nimplemented in strict compliance with the purposes \r\nand principles of the United Nations Charter.\r\nWe support increased representation in the Security \r\nCouncil of developing countries from Africa, Asia, \r\nLatin America and the Caribbean. We also strongly \r\nbelieve that the overall enhancement in the Security \r\nCouncil composition should be based on the existing \r\nregional groups. As pointed out by the President of \r\nUkraine in the Assembly Hall in September (see \r\nA/67/PV.9), my country is open to discussing all \r\nprogressive concepts of Security Council reform that \r\ncan lead States Members of the United Nations to \r\nthe broadest possible agreement. In that context, my \r\ndelegation holds that any existing or potential formula \r\nwill only gain in legitimacy by envisaging enhanced \r\nrepresentation of the Group of Eastern European States \r\nthrough allocation to it of one additional non-permanent \r\nseat.\r\nAs to the current state of play and the way \r\nforward, we broadly share the relevant assessments and \r\nsuggestions made by the chair of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations, Ambassador Zahir Tanin, which were \r\noutlined in his latest letter to Member States. We \r\ncongratulate Ambassador Tanin on his reappointment \r\nas chair of the negotiations, and would like to underline \r\nour delegation’s commitment to progress in those \r\nnegotiations. My delegation also welcomes the newly \r\nelected members of the Council and looks forward \r\nto progress in the area of improving the work of that \r\nimportant body.\r\nUkraine has always been an advocate of a strong \r\nUnited Nations with the Security Council, as its principal \r\norgan, entrusted with the primary responsibility for the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. That \r\n12-59231 13\r\nA/67/PV.39\r\nSpain would like to be able to receive with \r\nsufficient prior notice a programme of work for the \r\ncurrent exercise. We encourage Ambassador Tanin \r\nto work in close consultation with Member States. \r\nDecisions 62/557, 63/565 and 64/568 establish the \r\ncomprehensive and inclusive nature and the centrality \r\nof the role of States in the negotiations. Respect for \r\nthe rules of procedure and the development of a well-\r\nstructured programme of work will pave the way for \r\nachieving concrete and satisfactory results in the next \r\nnegotiating round. Spain believes that we are capable \r\nof bringing them about by working together with a \r\nconstructive spirit and avoiding maximalist approaches.\r\nMr. Estreme (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish):  First \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Security Council for \r\nintroducing the report (A/67/2) to the General Assembly \r\non the meetings and activities of the Council and of its \r\nsubsidiary bodies in the past year. \r\nMy delegation has observed a trend towards an \r\nincrease in the workload of the Security Council in the \r\nperiod under review with the persistence and emergence \r\nof new crises in Africa and in the Middle East in \r\nparticular. Argentina is following those developments \r\nwith attention, particularly since it will be joining that \r\nbody on 1 January 2013. \r\nMy delegation would also like to highlight Portugal’s \r\nleadership during this period with a view to improving \r\nthe Council’s working methods. We recognize the \r\nstrides made in this area where the outstanding \r\nissues of greater inclusiveness and transparency of \r\nthe membership are still unresolved. That is why in \r\nthe course of our mandate during the next two years, \r\nArgentina will place particular importance on trying \r\nto increase transparency with regard to the work of the \r\nSecurity Council and its subsidiary bodies.\r\nThat said, we regret once again the fact that this \r\nSecurity Council report lacks more analysis and \r\ncontinues to be limited to a great extent to an account \r\nof facts, from which we cannot make a conclusive \r\nassessment of the Council’s substantive activities. \r\nWe also regret the fact that the report was circulated \r\nvery little in advance so that delegations, including \r\nArgentina, were not able to study its content carefully.\r\nArgentina remains committed to achieving \r\nSecurity Council reform as soon as possible with a view \r\nto a more democratic, transparent and inclusive Council \r\nthat represents all regions of the world — in particular \r\nprocess of negotiations that brings us towards that \r\nhorizon must respect, in accordance with decision \r\n62/557, a global approach that would include the five \r\nkey issues and not fall into the temptation of favouring \r\nsome of them to the detriment of others. In an \r\nundertaking of this magnitude, despite the fact that the \r\nnegotiations have been protracted for far longer than is \r\ndesired, there is no room for any acceleration prompted \r\nby self-interest. The final outcome ought to be broadly \r\nsatisfactory, because otherwise the effort would be a \r\nuseless failure. \r\nMy delegation is convinced that the most democratic \r\nproposal that has been submitted for consideration by \r\nall Members is that of Uniting for Consensus, as it is the \r\nfairest and most inclusive. For that reason, and with due \r\nrespect for the other proposals, we believe that it is the \r\nonly one capable of generating a broad consensus. It is \r\nour belief that the necessary enlargement of the Security \r\nCouncil should not result in an increase in the number of \r\nits permanent members. Instead, we propose to provide \r\nformulas that facilitate and increase the opportunities \r\nfor all Member States to serve in that organ, as well \r\nas longer-term and/or more frequent participation for \r\nStates with a larger presence in the different areas of \r\nthe Organization. The idea of establishing long-term \r\nseats is aimed at this second purpose. \r\nUniting for Consensus advocates abolishing the \r\nveto or, if that is not possible, regulating it to reduce \r\nits practice to a minimum and to thus avoid the abusive \r\nand unjustifiable use of that privilege. To that end, the \r\nright of veto should be relinquished in alleged crimes \r\nof genocide, ethnic cleansing, war crimes and crimes \r\nagainst humanity, and when the veto is used, the reasons \r\nshould be publicly given. \r\nAnother key objective of this reform is to achieve \r\ngeographic representation that accords with the new \r\nreality of the international community of States. \r\nThat we need to rectify the poor representation of \r\nthe African continent is inexcusable. The proposal of \r\nUniting for Consensus takes into special consideration \r\nthe current anomaly, which should be corrected by \r\nallotting an appropriate number of long-term seats to \r\nAfrican countries. \r\nUniting for Consensus wants to improve the \r\nCouncil’s working methods by promoting its \r\ntransparency and ineraction, which will also result in \r\na smoother and more efficient relationship with the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n14 12-59231\r\nA/67/PV.39\r\nefforts in Afghanistan, Timor-Leste, Sierra Leone, \r\nHaiti and other countries. \r\nThe Council is committed to combating terrorism \r\nand to preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction. It attaches great importance to protecting \r\nthe rights and interests of women and children in armed \r\nconflict and to strengthening cooperation with regional \r\nand subregional organizations.\r\nThe Security Council has kept up with the efforts \r\nto improve its working methods in order to better fulfil \r\nits mandate and to increase the transparency of its \r\nwork. It has held many open meetings and debates and \r\nhas enhanced its exchanges with the General Assembly \r\nand other principal bodies of the United Nations, \r\nnon-Council members and countries contributing \r\ntroops to peacekeeping operations. The Council has \r\nalso conducted frequent exchanges of views with \r\nrelevant stakeholders through such innovative formats \r\nas informal interactive dialogues.\r\nChina supports the Council in its ongoing efforts \r\nto improve its working methods. At present, the \r\ninternational community is facing increasing challenges \r\nin the area of peace and security. We hope the Council \r\nwill pay greater attention to the needs and demands of \r\nAfrica and support the efforts of the African Union and \r\nregional organizations in Africa to maintain peace and \r\nsecurity on the continent. The Council should make \r\nbetter use of such means as good offices and mediation \r\nto prevent conflict and turmoil, to reform and improve \r\npeacekeeping operations and to support post-conflict \r\npeacebuilding efforts in order to further contribute to \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nChina supports the Security Council in enhancing \r\nits authority and efficiency through appropriate and \r\nnecessary reform so as to better implement the mandate \r\nof maintaining international peace and security \r\nentrusted to it under the Charter. The Council should give \r\npriority to increasing the representation of developing \r\ncountries, in particular African countries, on the \r\nCouncil. Security Council reform should be conducive \r\nto more opportunities for more countries — especially \r\nsmall and medium-sized countries, which constitute \r\nthe majority of the United Nations membership — to \r\ntake part in meetings and to participate in the Council’s \r\ndecision-making. \r\nSecurity Council reform is both complex and \r\nnecessary. It affects the vital interests of Member \r\nStates, and currently there remains a wide divergence \r\nAfrica, where the majority of the Council’s activity is \r\nfocused and which is underrepresented in that organ.\r\nThat reform should necessarily comprise five pillars \r\nand must the outcome of a consensus in line with the \r\noutcomes of the relevant General Assembly resolutions \r\nand decisions. In that framework, Argentina, which is \r\na member of the Uniting for Consensus group, remains \r\ncommitted to working with all Members and groups to \r\nachieve the common goal. We are convinced that we \r\ncan achieve that reform only if our positions become \r\nmore f lexible, as Uniting for Consensus has pointed \r\nout.\r\nThe initiatives on partial reform, or those that \r\nseek to speed up the process or that do not take into \r\naccount national ownership by Member States of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations not only will prevent \r\nus from moving forward but also are likely to push \r\nus backwards. In that respect, we warn against the \r\npotential adverse effects of partial initiatives, wherever \r\nthey come from.    \r\nArgentina and Uniting for Consensus welcome \r\nthe decision of the President of the General Assembly \r\nto work with all Members and with the chair of \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations, Ambassador \r\nTanin — whom we thank for his work — in a framework \r\nof transparency and predictability as essential \r\ningredients for a successful reform process. We trust \r\nthat under the leadership of the President we will be \r\nable to achieve tangible progress in the current session.\r\nMr. Wang Min (China) (spoke in Chinese): I thank \r\nthe representative of India for presenting the annual \r\nreport of the Security Council (A/67/2) to the General \r\nAssembly on behalf of the Council (see A/67/PV.38). I \r\nwould also like to thank the delegation of Colombia and \r\nthe Secretariat for preparing the report.\r\nIn the reporting period, the Council actively \r\nfulfilled the mandates entrusted to it under the Charter \r\nof the United Nations and made important efforts in \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security \r\nand in the peaceful settlement of disputes through \r\ngood offices, mediation, dialogue and consultations. \r\nThe Council has closely followed the developments \r\nin the situations in the Middle East and in Africa and \r\nhas endeavoured to facilitate the proper resolution of \r\noutstanding problems between the Sudan and South \r\nSudan through dialogue and negotiations. The Council \r\nhas also actively maintained security and stability in \r\nthe Sahel region and further promoted peacebuilding \r\n12-59231 15\r\nA/67/PV.39\r\nwith a balanced representation. That is essential when \r\ndecisions are made, above all when those decisions \r\ncan redefine the balance of power at the global level. \r\nAll that must be in accordance with the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nThe international political balances must respect \r\nto a certain extent the diversity of existing interests, \r\nbut most of all the well-being of all peoples. In our \r\nview, that requires greater regional representation of \r\nboth Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean in an \r\nenlarged Security Council. In that regard, we reiterate \r\nour support to the proposal made by the Group of Four, \r\nwhich is aimed at defining, in a first stage, the increase \r\nin the representation of permanent and non-permanent \r\nmembers as an essential element commensurate with \r\nthe new global geography and new international \r\nchallenges. It includes improvement in the working \r\nmethods. \r\nAs we have said in previous meetings, El Salvador \r\nagrees on the importance of reforming the Security \r\nCouncil to make it a more inclusive, democratic, \r\ntransparent and equitable organ that corresponds to new \r\nglobal challenges and is a mechanism for the peaceful \r\nsettlement of international disputes in a broadened \r\ncontext. Our delegation believes that any process which \r\ninvolves a reform or improvement of the Council must \r\nbe approached through a process of intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations and be based on the greatest possible \r\npolitical acceptance, which is naturally reflected by \r\nconsensus or at least with a majority greater than two \r\nthirds. \r\nThe Member States have expressed interest \r\nand readiness to continue to move forward with the \r\nnegotiations. Nevertheless, it has not been possible \r\nto get past the practice of just making statements of \r\nposition to come to real negotiations that yield concrete \r\nresults. Therefore, we believe that it is vital that there \r\nshould be genuine political will and f lexibility in order \r\nto move beyond this stage and have a future with an \r\norgan that is more representative and therefore more \r\neffective and legitimate in implementing its decisions. \r\nSimilarly, we consider it important that the \r\nintergovernmental negotiation process should continue \r\nand move to direct negotiations based on a concentrated \r\ntext that allows progress in this process, since the time \r\nleft for achieving agreement on this subject is running \r\nout as we face history. The international reality on the \r\nground clearly shows the need to address this reform in \r\nthe shortest term possible. \r\nof opinions on the issue. Member States should \r\ncontinue to actively work toward consensus and to meet \r\neach other half way through democratic consultations. \r\nImposing any artificial deadline for the reform or \r\ntaking forceful action when the conditions are not \r\nfavourable will not help to resolve problems but will \r\nonly lead to aggravating differences and confrontations \r\namong Member States.\r\nThe five clusters of issues under Council reform \r\nare interrelated. We should seek a comprehensive \r\npackage of solutions. A piecemeal or phased approach \r\nwill go nowhere. The efforts to reform the Council \r\nshould continue through the main channel of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. We should promote \r\ntheir orderly progress, pursuant to decision 62/557, \r\nand the principles of openness, transparency and \r\ninclusiveness. Ownership by the membership is the \r\nimportant principle guiding the negotiations. Continued \r\ncompliance with that principle is both the prerequisite \r\nfor the appropriate development of the reform process \r\nand the guarantee for successful results of the reform.\r\nImposing any solution will make it impossible \r\nto accommodate, to the greatest extent possible, the \r\nlegitimate interests and concerns of the vast majority \r\nof the membership. Without the mandate of Member \r\nStates, we should not allow any wilful attempt to \r\nstreamline the participation of Member States or to \r\nreduce the options for negotiations.\r\nChina hopes that Member States will continue \r\nto effectively take advantage of the platform of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations to galvanize mutual \r\ninterests in an effort to seek the broadest possible \r\nagreement  on Security Council reform.\r\nMr. Maza Martelli (El Salvador) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nEl Salvador welcomes the convening of this debate on \r\nSecurity Council reform. We are convinced that it is \r\nan essential and urgent issue for the strengthening of \r\nmultilateralism as the practicable way for enhancing the \r\ncapacities for legitimate action by the United Nations \r\nin order to contribute in an effective, democratic and \r\ninclusive manner to maintaining peace and security \r\nand thereby to prevent conflicts and humanitarian \r\ncrises caused by humankind’s great economic, social \r\nand environmental problems. \r\nTherefore, my delegation believes that the only \r\nway to achieve significant changes in the Security \r\nCouncil is through its genuine reconstruction. That \r\nrequires enlarging its membership in both categories, \r\n16 12-59231\r\nA/67/PV.39\r\nEl Salvador would like to highlight, and express its \r\nappreciation for, the ongoing commitment of all Member \r\nStates to continue the dialogue on this very important \r\nissue in order to ensure that we have a strengthened \r\nUnited Nations in the situation that the international \r\ncommunity is currently experiencing and the obligation \r\nto prepare ourselves for the future. El Salvador will \r\ncontinue to support proposals that allow us to improve \r\nand enhance the system of multilateral coordination and \r\nall those spaces that enable us to produce proposals that \r\nare then reflected in effective responses to overcome \r\nthe situation of inequality and injustice and to create a \r\nworld with greater solidarity and equality. \r\nMr. Çevik (Turkey): At the outset, let me thank \r\nyou, Mr. President, for convening this meeting. I would \r\nalso like to congratulate Ambassador Zahir Tanin for \r\nhis reappointment as the chair of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations. We also thank India for presenting the \r\nannual report of the Security Council (A/67/2) at our \r\npreceding meeting. \r\nTurkey would like to see a more accountable, \r\ntransparent, effective and democratic Security Council, \r\nto be reformed on the basis of decision 62/557. In that \r\nregard, we believe that the five key issues identified in \r\nthe decision, namely, the categories of membership, the \r\nquestion of the veto, regional representation, the size \r\nand working methods of the Council and the relationship \r\nbetween the Council and the General Assembly should \r\nbe addressed as a package to reach a comprehensive \r\nsolution. \r\nWe are convinced that a broad-based and \r\ncomprehensive solution can be achieved by compromise, \r\nwhich requires f lexibility. We also believe that the \r\nprimary responsibility of this process rests with \r\nthe Member States. We further believe that African \r\ncountries must be given special emphasis in the reform \r\nagenda so as to achieve a more equitable geographical \r\nrepresentation. With this perspective, the Uniting for \r\nConsensus proposal takes into account the legitimate \r\naspirations of Africa. \r\nIn closing my remarks, I would like to highlight \r\nonce again that the Uniting for Consensus group will \r\ncontinue to work constructively with all stakeholders \r\nfor a compromise and broad-based solution.\r\nMrs. Morgan (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): I would \r\nlike to thank the President for convening this joint \r\ndebate on the annual report of the Security Council to \r\nthe General Assembly and on Security Council reform. \r\nSimilarly, I wish to thank the President of the Security \r\nCouncil, the Permanent Representative of India, for \r\nintroducing the annual report of the Security Council \r\n(A/67/2), at the 38th meeting. I would like to express \r\nour special gratitude to the Permanent Representative \r\nof Colombia, since his delegation was in charge of \r\ndrafting the report. We acknowledge Colombia’s effort \r\nto make the Council’s annual report more analytical, \r\naddressing the concerns of the membership in that \r\nregard. \r\nI wish to refer to the question of Security Council \r\nreform in more detail. First of all, I would like to express \r\nappreciation for the letter of 9 November from the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly, in which he informs \r\nus of the appointment of Ambassador Zahir Tanin as \r\nfacilitator of the intergovernmental negotiations on \r\nSecurity Council reform. I congratulate Ambassador \r\nTanin on his appointment, and I reiterate to him \r\nMexico’s support for the development of an authentic \r\nprocess of intergovernmental negotiations. We agree \r\nwith the Assembly President that transparency and \r\npredictability are essential elements in this process. \r\nThe responsibility that the President of the General \r\nAssembly has entrusted to Ambassador Tanin is a very \r\nimportant one. The role of a facilitator, especially in \r\nsuch a sensitive area, consists of compiling the positions \r\nof Member States and, on that basis, defining a path \r\nthat would make it possible to generate the necessary \r\nagreements to achieve a solution that would enjoy the \r\nbroadest possible support of the Member States. In order \r\nto achieve that, the facilitator is entirely dependent \r\non the f lexibility that States show with regard to that \r\ncommon goal. Without that f lexibility or willingness \r\nto compromise, the facilitator’s room for manoeuvre \r\nis reduced to a minimum. In such circumstances, we \r\ncan only expect the facilitator to interpret positions or, \r\nworse, to discard or minimize delegations’ proposals.\r\nSince the start of the intergovernmental negotiation \r\nprocess in 2009, my delegation, together with the \r\nmembers of the Uniting for Consensus movement, has \r\nbeen actively advocating the so-called compromise \r\nproposal, whose purpose is to bring the positions \r\nof Member States closer together in order to reach a \r\nsolution acceptable to everyone. So far, however, we \r\nhave not seen the f lexibility necessary to achieve that \r\ncompromise. We once again emphasize the urgency \r\nof beginning a genuine negotiating process as soon \r\nas possible, one in which delegations do not content \r\nthemselves with reiterating their customary positions \r\n12-59231 17\r\nA/67/PV.39\r\nbut become genuinely involved in a shared consideration \r\nof concrete alternatives that make it possible to address \r\nthe concerns of the broad majority of Member States. We \r\ncannot achieve that goal while we are not ready to give \r\nup particular aspects of our original positions so as to \r\narrive at a general solution that satisfies the membership \r\nand improves the representativeness, transparency and \r\naccountability of the Security Council.\r\nMexico is ready to begin that negotiation process. \r\nTogether with Uniting for Consensus, we have presented \r\na compromise proposal that reflects our willingness \r\nto be f lexible and seek a compromise solution. We \r\nbelieve that it can be achieved if we address three \r\nessential elements: improving the Security Council’s \r\nrepresentativeness, correcting the geographic \r\nimbalance that has worsened in recent years; instituting \r\nlonger-term seats so that some States can participate \r\nfor a longer time in the Council while at the same \r\ntime preserving accountability through periodic \r\nelections; and improving and making more transparent \r\nthe Council’s working methods and decision-making \r\nprocesses, including the question of the veto. We are \r\nready to discuss the details of the proposal within \r\nthe framework of the intergovernmental negotiations \r\nand in any format, formal or informal, that seeks a \r\ncompromise solution, a solution that is the result of \r\nnegotiations and not the imposition of one option over \r\nthe rest. We hope soon to receive a clear schedule of \r\nmeetings with that goal.\r\nMr. Och (Mongolia): At the outset, my delegation \r\nwould like to thank the representative of India for \r\npresenting, at our 38th meeting, the annual report \r\nof the Security Council (A/67/2), and Ambassador \r\nNéstor Osorio and the Colombian delegation for their \r\npreparation of the report during Colombia’s presidency \r\nof the Council in July. We also take this opportunity \r\nto congratulate Ambassador Zahir Tanin, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Afghanistan, on his reappointment \r\nas chair of the intergovernmental negotiations on the \r\nquestion of equitable representation on and increase \r\nin the membership of the Security Council and other \r\nmatters related to the Council. Mongolia commends \r\nAmbassador Tanin’s efforts to conduct a more in-depth \r\ndiscussion of Member States’ initiatives on Security \r\nCouncil reform.\r\nEight rounds of intergovernmental negotiations \r\nhave taken place in the informal plenary of the General \r\nAssembly since the adoption in 2008 of its historic \r\ndecision 62/557. We have had the opportunity to discuss \r\nour principled positions, as well as some proposals, \r\non the five key issues of comprehensive reform of the \r\nSecurity Council. I believe it is very important that we \r\ncontinue our work on the issue.\r\nMongolia would like to reiterate its principled \r\nposition on advocating a just and equitable expansion \r\nin both the permanent and non-permanent categories \r\nof membership, whereby due representation of both \r\ndeveloping and developed countries, including \r\nsmall States, is ensured. We also attach paramount \r\nimportance to the need to ensure equitable geographical \r\ndistribution, with an emphasis on those groups that are \r\nunderrepresented or not represented at all, particularly \r\nfrom Africa, Asia and Latin American and the \r\nCaribbean. My delegation believes that only expansion \r\nin both the permanent and non-permanent categories \r\nof membership can ensure that the Council reflects \r\ncontemporary world realities and can ensure greater and \r\nenhanced representation of developing countries. That \r\nwill serve to achieve the goal of a more accountable, \r\nrepresentative and transparent Security Council.\r\nMongolia continues to share the view of the majority \r\nof Member States that the right to the veto needs to be \r\nabolished eventually. In the meantime, its use should \r\nbe restricted, in particular by stipulating that it should \r\nnot be used under certain circumstances. As long as the \r\nveto right exists, it must be extended to new permanent \r\nmembers, who must have the same responsibilities and \r\nprivileges as the existing permanent members.\r\nFinally, I would like to welcome the President’s \r\ndesire to assist and facilitate Member States in \r\nadvancing the common agenda, including the ongoing \r\nSecurity Council reform process. And I wish to express \r\nmy delegation’s sincere hope that, under his strong \r\nleadership, the General Assembly will make meaningful \r\nprogress in the current session towards timely reform of \r\nthe Security Council.\r\nMr. Missaoui (Tunisia) (spoke in French): I would \r\nfirst like to thank the President for making Security \r\nCouncil reform one of his priorities, and to assure him \r\nof my country’s firm support for every effort on his \r\npart to conclude that process during the current session \r\nand under his presidency. I would also like to commend \r\nthe facilitator of the intergovernmental negotiations on \r\nSecurity Council reform, the Permanent Representative \r\nof Afghanistan, Mr. Zahir Tanin, for his untiring \r\nefforts and for the way in which he has conducted those \r\nnegotiations, and to congratulate him on the renewal of \r\nhis mandate during the current session.\r\n18 12-59231\r\nA/67/PV.39\r\ncircumstances become a private club of countries with \r\nparticular privileges, or be seen as such. That would be \r\na real danger for its resolutions and their effectiveness, \r\nas well as for the legitimacy of the Council’s handling \r\nof sensitive issues such as those related to international \r\npeace and security.\r\nAt a time when the world is undergoing profound \r\ntransformations and major geostrategic changes, the \r\nCouncil’s permanent members themselves recognize \r\nthe imperative need to adapt international relations and \r\nthe dynamics that govern them. The Council, being \r\nat the heart of those dynamics as the body having the \r\nultimate task of maintaining peace and security in the \r\nworld, certainly must not be spared any adjustment \r\nor adaptation to current regional and international \r\nrealities.\r\nMr. Balé (Congo), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThose goals will be achieved only by enlarging the \r\nCouncil, particularly with respect to the developing \r\ncountries. Similarly, the size of the restructured \r\nCouncil must reflect all sensitivities of the international \r\ncommunity. \r\nIn that context, Tunisia continues to strongly \r\nsupport the position of the African Union as reflected \r\nin the Ezulwini Consensus on the reform of the Security \r\nCouncil and the Sirte Declaration. We believe that it is \r\ntime to correct the current situation, which has always \r\ndeprived the African continent of a permanent presence \r\nin the Security Council. We support any formula that \r\nwould give the developing countries in general and \r\nAfrica in particular the place they deserve in the \r\nCouncil. \r\nIn fact, Tunisia, which has participated since \r\nthe 1960s in many peacekeeping operations and has \r\ncontributed through its contingents or its diplomacy \r\nto resolving conflicts, knows very well the challenges \r\nbrought about by wars and hotbeds of tension. My \r\ncountry remains convinced that a Security Council with \r\nsuch restricted membership and such rigid mechanisms \r\nwill be unable to meet either current needs for a \r\nrapid, effective and appropriate response to emerging \r\nconflicts, or the aspirations of peoples of the world who \r\nsee in the United Nations and its executive body the \r\nonly recourse when all hope has vanished.\r\nI will conclude by raising the need to consider, in \r\nany reform effort, the relations between the Security \r\nCouncil and the other principal organs of the United \r\nNations, and the need for the Council to fully respect the \r\nRegarding the question of equitable representation \r\non the Security Council and the expansion of its \r\nmembership — the subject of my delegation’s \r\nstatement — I associate myself with the statements \r\nmade at the 38th meeting by the representatives of \r\nAlgeria and Egypt on behalf of the African Group and \r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement, respectively.\r\nTunisia believes that the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations form the only suitable institutional \r\nframework, tasked by the General Assembly with \r\ndealing with the issue of Security Council reform in an \r\nopen, inclusive and transparent manner in order to find \r\na solution and to garner the widest possible political \r\nsupport among Member States, in accordance with the \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations and \r\nthe relevant Assembly decisions, particularly decision \r\n62/557. While welcoming the results of the most recent \r\nstage of the intergovernmental negotiation process on \r\nthe question of equitable representation on the Security \r\nCouncil and expanding its membership,  results based \r\non Member States’ proposals, I would like to declare \r\nmy delegation’s complete willingness to continue \r\nits support for the progress made in the negotiations \r\nwithin the framework of a process that should continue \r\nto display the transparency, the inclusive nature and \r\nspirit of consensus that have characterized it so far.\r\nThe main goal of that process should be a Security \r\nCouncil that reflects the political and economic realities \r\nof our world today and that has the legitimacy necessary \r\nto act on behalf of the international community in \r\naccomplishing its mandate, all in accordance with \r\nthe Charter. Enhancing the Council’s legitimacy will \r\nundoubtedly lead to more effective decisions, more \r\nrealistic mandates and more consistent implementation \r\nof decisions. \r\nThe reform must be thorough, transparent and \r\nbalanced. It must ensure that the Council’s agenda \r\nreflects the needs and interests of both developed and \r\ndeveloping countries. It must also address all substantive \r\nissues concerning, inter alia, the composition of the \r\nCouncil, its regional representation, working methods, \r\nagenda and decision-making process, including, in \r\nparticular, the right of veto, in order to ensure the \r\nbroadest possible political agreement among the \r\nMember States.\r\nMy country’s delegation is of the view that the end \r\npoint of any Council reform must be the strengthening \r\nof that body’s equitable representation, credibility \r\nand effectiveness. The Council must under no \r\n12-59231 19\r\nA/67/PV.39\r\nnon-governmental organization Platform for Change, \r\nwhich aims to educate and inform the diplomatic \r\ncommunity and civil society on the important issues \r\nand events surrounding United Nations reform. \r\nThe intergovernmental negotiations have clearly \r\nshown that there is at least agreement on one issue \r\namong all States Members of the United Nations, \r\nand that is that there should be an increase in the \r\nnon-permanent category.\r\nAs to the effectiveness of the Security Council, \r\nit is crucial that the Council respond more rapidly \r\nto emerging situations by improving in its working \r\nmethods. There is a need to accelerate the work of the \r\nCouncil’s subsidiary bodies, including the sanctions \r\ncommittees and working groups, especially by giving \r\nmore attention to cases presented to them by Member \r\nStates. Regarding effectiveness, my delegation feels that \r\nthe Council must deal with issues, especially those of a \r\nlong-standing nature, in a fair and balanced way, make \r\nless use of the veto and consider the interests of the \r\nwider United Nations membership in decisions it takes. \r\nIt is recognized that many of those issues depend on the \r\npolitical will of the Council’s permanent members, as \r\nthey have the veto power to approve or to not approve \r\nany changes to the Council’s working methods. \r\nNotwithstanding, many of us believe that improving \r\nthe working methods would, in turn, have a direct and \r\npositive effect on the question of the transparency and \r\nefficiency of the Council itself. My delegation feels \r\nthat all Member States should be given the possibility \r\nof knowing more about issues and receive prompt, \r\nrelevant and current information on matters brought \r\nto the Council’s attention. In addition, to the extent \r\npossible, there should be fewer closed meetings and \r\nmore open briefings and consultations. Permanent \r\nmembers should be encouraged to work more closely \r\nwith the majority of the Member States and to consider \r\nmore seriously the suggestions for improvement in the \r\nworking methods.\r\nDecision 62/557 lays the basis for a negotiated \r\nsolution based on the five key issues. The smooth \r\ntransition of those discussions and negotiations to \r\nthe Assembly’s sixty-seventh session augurs well \r\nfor our deliberations. My delegation believes that it \r\nis important that the achievements of the Member \r\nState-driven process not be lost, and we strongly \r\nappeal to delegations not to take unilateral initiatives \r\nor piecemeal approaches that will weaken the process \r\nrather than bring us together.\r\nprerogatives and functions of each of those organs, in \r\nparticular the General Assembly. Those issues must be \r\nconsidered with the same importance as other aspects \r\nof the reform process, and in an integrated manner.\r\nMr. Grima (Malta): Few would deny the need to \r\nreform the Security Council to make it better reflect \r\nthe world of the twenty-first century. At the same \r\ntime, 20 years into a process of discussion among the \r\nOrganization’s membership, meaningful progress, \r\nregrettably, remains an elusive goal. Member States, \r\nin particular small and medium-sized States, continue \r\nto search for ways to reform the Council to make it \r\nmore representative, more efficient and effective, more \r\naccountable and more transparent in order to better \r\naddress the challenges of our time.\r\nMalta has formed part of Uniting for Consensus \r\nsince its earliest days. I wish to recall the basic \r\nprinciples underpinning our position on how best to \r\nmove our discussion forward. \r\nMalta remains of the firm view that the five key \r\nissues agreed to by consensus in decision 62/557 of \r\n15 September 2008 are interlinked. In maintaining \r\nthose five key issues as one component, we would \r\nensure that the reform of the Security Council would be \r\nconducted in a coherent and cohesive manner. In turn, \r\nthat would safeguard the interests of all Member States \r\nand provide a reformed Council with the much-needed \r\nownership of the broader membership.\r\nSecurity Council membership must be more \r\nreflective of present-day realities. Therefore, like \r\nmany others, Malta strongly believes that the Council’s \r\nmembership should be increased. I would like to recall \r\nthat since the last Security Council enlargement, in \r\n1965, 76 countries have joined our Organization as new \r\nMember States. Thus it is logical that one of the key \r\nissues that need to be resolved is the question of the \r\nenlargement of the reformed Security Council so as to \r\ntake into account the larger membership of 193 States. \r\nThe position of small and medium-sized States in an \r\nexpanded Security Council should figure prominently \r\nin our discussions. Only the Uniting for Consensus \r\nproposal has specific non-permanent seats for both \r\nsmall and medium-sized States. It is also statistically \r\nthe most advantageous proposal for all small and \r\nmedium-sized States, as well as for the great majority of \r\nlarge States. That fact is not only stated by the Uniting \r\nfor Consensus group, it is also very well reflected in \r\nthe table prepared by the recently formed independent \r\n20 12-59231\r\nA/67/PV.39\r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of the \r\nSecurity Council. Despite having worked on this topic \r\nfor more than 20 years, we have not made the progress \r\nthat the urgency of the case requires. We hope that \r\ndelegations will make a commitment to work and reach \r\nan agreement on the Security Council. We believe that \r\nwe cannot wait any longer to take action and achieve \r\nthe long-awaited reforms. Allow me to reiterate the \r\ncommitment of the Republic of Nicaragua to working \r\nactively and constructively on this very timely matter.\r\nNicaragua is pleased once again to reiterate its \r\nposition on how to achieve a Security Council that is \r\nmore democratic, equitable and representative. As we \r\nhave established on different occasions, it is urgent to \r\nreform the Council in a thorough and comprehensive \r\nway. At the Assembly’s sixty-sixth session, there \r\nwere eight rounds of exchange of positions among \r\nthe States, where the fairness of our positions was \r\nheard and where those positions gained the support \r\nof an overwhelming majority of Member States in \r\nthe intergovernmental process. During that session, \r\nMember States had the opportunity to meet with \r\ndifferent groups in order to have an overview of the \r\npositions of every region, which is indispensable \r\nfor doing good work and for coming up with a good \r\nproposal for making progress in this area and thus help \r\nto strengthen the Security Council. \r\nWe believe that the time has come to be more \r\nspecific when it comes to the future of the negotiations. \r\nIt would be regrettable if we just overlook the exercise \r\nof the last eight rounds of talks and start again in the \r\ncurrent session another round of discussions with the \r\ngroups and States repeating their same positions. \r\nNicaragua feels that it is crucial to have a fair \r\nincrease in the number of permanent and non-permanent \r\nmembers of the Security Council in order to achieve an \r\nequitable balance in the Council. The increase in the \r\nnumber of members could be between 25 and 27. The \r\nincrease in the number of permanent members should \r\ntake into account the equitable representation of all \r\nregions, especially Latin America and the Caribbean \r\nand Africa, regions which, despite the fact that they \r\nhave a large number of Members in the United Nations, \r\nhave always lacked permanent representation in the \r\nSecurity Council.\r\nWe would like to take advantage of this opportunity \r\nto refer to the veto of the permanent members. The great \r\nmajority of Member States have clearly shown their \r\npreference to abolish the veto. Nicaragua fully shares \r\nMy delegation appreciates the role that the \r\nPresident’s predecessors have played in trying to bring \r\nthe views of various delegations closer together and, in \r\nso doing, to define and agree on an approach that would \r\ndo justice to all Member States. We also appreciate the \r\nwide consultations which the President has conducted in \r\nrecent weeks with Member States on the way forward, \r\nwhich underscores his understanding and insight on \r\nwhat he so rightly described in his 9 November letter as \r\na complex and sensitive matter. \r\nI congratulate the chair of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations, Ambassador Zahir Tanin, on his \r\nreappointment. As a neutral and impartial actor, his \r\nmain role should be to build confidence among Member \r\nStates and promote consultations with predictability \r\nand full transparency. \r\nThe President’s task in guiding our deliberations \r\nin the coming weeks will certainly not be without its \r\ndifficulties, and in his effort he will have Malta’s full \r\nsupport. Uniting for Consensus has always shown \r\nflexibility and a readiness to compromise. We have \r\nacted constructively in the past and will do so in the \r\nfuture.\r\nMrs. Rubiales de Chamorro (Nicaragua) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): First of all, I would like to thank Ambassador \r\nTanin for his tireless efforts and commitment to the \r\nmatter before us. \r\nThe delegation of Nicaragua would like to align \r\nitself with the statement made at the 38th meeting \r\nby the Permanent Representative of Jamaica, \r\nAmbassador Raymond Wolfe, who spoke on behalf of \r\nthe group of countries that supported draft resolution \r\nA/61/L.69/Rev.1, which has grown to become the \r\nlargest, most diverse and most representative group in \r\nthese negotiations. At every stage of our negotiations, \r\nthe L.69 group has clearly presented its proposals and \r\nshown its interest and its willingness to look at the \r\napproaches and all existing positions in order to enter \r\nonce and for all into real negotiations and thus comply \r\nwith the decisions of the General Assembly on urgent \r\nreforms in the Security Council.\r\nThe General Assembly is the most representative \r\nand most legitimate organ of the United Nations, and we \r\nare thus grateful to be able to express our preferences \r\non this matter in this organ.\r\nNicaragua reaffirms its firm commitment \r\nto the Organization’s reform process and to the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on equitable \r\n12-59231 21\r\nA/67/PV.39\r\nthe way forward, and for that, both sides must create \r\na space for a genuine, credible and mediated political \r\ndialogue.\r\nIt is vital that the General Assembly, whose \r\nmembers entrust the Security Council with the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, have \r\na better understanding of how the Council handles \r\nmatters. While the Council’s annual report has \r\nimproved in providing the context for the various issues \r\nit considers, there is room for more analysis, with a \r\ndescription of rationales, particularly when the Council \r\ncould not take action. We therefore also support the \r\nnotion that explanations of vetoes in the Council should \r\nbe circulated to all Member States. A more meaningful \r\nCouncil report, setting out the reasoning behind its \r\nactions, will also help to elicit support for its decisions \r\namong the wider membership. Working within the \r\nmandates of the principal organs, greater transparency, \r\ninterface and cohesiveness in and among the organs \r\nwill lead to better outcomes for global peace and well-\r\nbeing.\r\nThat brings me to the second topic of today, which for \r\nus means the imperative to undertake a comprehensive \r\nreform of the Security Council that makes it effective, \r\naccountable, democratic and representative of the \r\nworld’s plurality. Indonesia supports the rollover of \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiation process to the sixty-\r\nseventh session and commends the work of Ambassador \r\nTanin. Indonesia welcomes his reappointment as Chair \r\nof the intergovernmental negotiations. We will continue \r\nto work closely with all Member States in order to \r\nachieve tangible results in the Council’s reform.\r\nUnderstandably, the stakes in the Council’s \r\nreform are high. The meetings on specific issues that \r\nAmbassador Tanin convened during the sixty-sixth \r\nsession yielded an in-depth deliberation on the specific \r\nproposals by the various groups and were useful for \r\nfurther defining and advocating their perspectives.\r\nAlthough there is more clarity on the various \r\nproposals, fundamental differences still remain, \r\nparticularly on the issues of membership categories, \r\nsize and the veto. Greater political f lexibility is required \r\nfrom all sides to move to points of convergence. A \r\nviable way to enable meaningful advancement needs \r\nto be explored. We believe that an intermediate \r\napproach with a clear review mechanism should be \r\nexplored in greater detail, as should a realistic option \r\nfor achieving tangible and consensus-based Council \r\nthat position. While negotiations are continuing on this \r\nitem, the new permanent members of the Council to be \r\nelected should have the same privileges and prerogatives \r\nas those held by current permanent members.\r\nIt is our wish that the aforementioned proposals \r\nbe taken into account and acted upon as soon as \r\npossible. Our demands are not excessive; on the \r\ncontrary, they are timely if we want to improve the \r\nOrganization. Nicaragua again commits itself to \r\nworking along those lines and to doing all that is within \r\nits reach to achieve the crucial objective that is the full \r\ndemocratization of this Organization. \r\nMr. Khan (Indonesia): I would like first to thank \r\nthe President for convening today’s important debate \r\non the two interconnected topics. We thank India, as \r\nthe current President of the Security Council, along \r\nwith other Council members, for presenting the annual \r\nreport of the Security Council (A/67/2).\r\nOn the topic of the Council’s report, Indonesia \r\nassociates itself with the statement made by the \r\nrepresentative of Egypt at the 38th meeting on behalf of \r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement.\r\nThe large number of Council resolutions, \r\npresidential statements and field visits during the \r\nperiod under review underlines the seriousness of \r\ncurrent challenges to global peace and security. It also \r\nunderlines that the Security Council’s role remains as \r\ncrucial as ever and that all members of the international \r\ncommunity should fulfil their responsibilities to assist \r\nthe Council in defusing problems and building lasting \r\npeace.\r\nIndonesia commends the Security Council for its \r\nactions in many of the cases mentioned in the report. \r\nAt the same time, it is dismayed at the lack of action \r\nand the Council’s perceived lack of evenhandedness on \r\ncertain issues.\r\nThe lingering question of Palestine is a major \r\ncase in point. We very much hope that the situation of \r\nPalestine will be dealt with equitably by the Council \r\nand that the veto will not stand in the way of enabling \r\nthe Palestinian people to realize their legitimate rights \r\nand aspirations. \r\nToo much bloodshed has occurred in Syria as well. \r\nWe reiterate that all parties in Syria must immediately \r\ncease the violence, ensure the delivery and access of \r\nhumanitarian aid, and fully observe international \r\nhumanitarian law. A Syrian-led political process is \r\n22 12-59231\r\nA/67/PV.39\r\nCouncil seats. The structural reform of the Council \r\nshould represent a modern and realistic world.  \r\nMoving the negotiations forward demands a new \r\nunderstanding to bridge the divergences among the \r\nvast majority of Member States. We need to bridge the \r\npositions of all the groups concerned. We therefore \r\ncall for a spirit of compromise and inclusiveness \r\nin order to achieve the widest possible consensus. We \r\nwould like to propose the following recommendations \r\nfor full consideration. \r\nThe proposals of the most recent intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations regarding the veto right, with all its \r\nimplications, should be carefully reviewed so that a \r\nviable solution can be found. We believe that a change \r\nin the working methods does not require an amendment \r\nto the Charter of the United Nations or a two-thirds \r\nmajority to be adopted. Kazakhstan believes that any \r\nimprovement in the working methods will not limit the \r\npower of the Council or subordinate it to the General \r\nAssembly, but rather will strengthen the Council to \r\nmake it more efficient.\r\nIn addition, Kazakhstan suggests some further \r\nsteps to achieve the outcomes we are seeking. It is \r\ncritical to have all the proposals by Member States on \r\nthe table in order to achieve greater transparency and \r\naccountability and fairer participation; increased access \r\nto information through open briefings, thematic debates \r\nand consultations with non-members of the Council; \r\nthe involvement of troop-contributing countries in the \r\ndecision-making processes on peacekeeping operations; \r\nand easy availability of provisional agendas, draft \r\nresolutions and presidential statements.\r\nIt is equally imperative to strengthen the mechanism \r\nfor cooperation between the Security Council and \r\nthe General Assembly, since the latter represents the \r\ninterests of all Member States. In particular, the most \r\ncrucial unresolved disputes in the Council could be \r\ndiscussed in the Assembly to ascertain the positions \r\nof the majority of Member States on vital issues so as \r\nto make possible a more informed adoption of Council \r\nresolutions.\r\nWe welcome the measure to increase the number \r\nof open Council meetings and to reduce the number of \r\nclosed meetings to ensure greater transparency. That is \r\nparticularly important for countries when the Council \r\ndeliberates the cases of their immediate neighbouring \r\ncountries or others in the region, given the relevant input \r\nthey can provide and in order to assess the interrelated \r\nreform. A number of countries have expressed a similar \r\nview.\r\nIndonesia emphasizes the need to consider all \r\nfive key reform issues together, as an interrelated \r\npackage. As agreed in decision 62/557, the reform \r\nshould be undertaken in a comprehensive manner \r\nthat encompasses the five key issues. The integrity \r\nof that consensus-based decision should be upheld. \r\nAny piecemeal approaches that address only one \r\nor two key reform issues and includes a particular \r\npresupposition with regard to the Council’s final shape \r\nand representation should be avoided.\r\nWe should also not generate any parallel United \r\nNations tracks, which may destabilize the already \r\nestablished negotiating framework and create further \r\npolitical hurdles. The reform of the Council should take \r\nplace through a consensus-based formula, or at least \r\nenjoy the greatest possible political acceptance, that is, \r\nwell beyond a two-thirds majority.\r\nIn conclusion, I reiterate the Indonesian delegation’s \r\ncommitment to continuing to constructively engage \r\nand contribute towards a comprehensively reformed \r\nSecurity Council.\r\nMrs. Aitimova (Kazakhstan): At the outset, \r\nmy delegation would like to thank His Excellency \r\nMr. Hardeep Singh Puri, Permanent Representative \r\nof India and President of the Security Council for \r\nthe month of November, for introducing the annual \r\nreport of the Council (A/67/2) at the preceding \r\nmeeting. It is very important to encourage better \r\ninteraction between the Council and the wider \r\nmembership. That would benefit the United Nations \r\nas a whole, particularly the developing world, which \r\nconstitutes the largest group. We also congratulate \r\nMr. Zahir Tanin, Permanent Representative of \r\nAfghanistan, on his reappointment as chair of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform and for his leadership in guiding its complex \r\ndeliberations.\r\nKazakhstan recognizes that the geographical \r\nimbalance in the Security Council and limitations in its \r\noperations still exist. Kazakhstan therefore reiterates \r\nits commitment to reform of the United Nations, \r\nprimarily the Council, on both those fronts. With a view \r\nto enhancing regional representation, my delegation \r\nreconfirms its position on increasing the Council’s \r\nmembership from the existing 15 members to 25 by \r\nestablishing six permanent and four non-permanent \r\n12-59231 23\r\nA/67/PV.39\r\nour experience is instructive and relevant to the more \r\nthan half of the membership of the United Nations \r\nthat are small States. It has also further reaffirmed the \r\nimportance of having a larger and more representative \r\nSecurity Council that can provide opportunities for all \r\ncountries, regardless of their size or economic capacity, \r\nto contribute to promoting and enhancing international \r\npeace and security.\r\nMy delegation therefore believes that the L.69 \r\ngroup’s position on each of the five key issues in \r\ndecision 62/557 provides a firm basis for greatly \r\nimproving the efficiency, transparency and legitimacy \r\nof the Security Council and bringing about a \r\ntransformation that would enable the United Nations to \r\ndeal most effectively with the challenges faced by the \r\ninternational community in the twenty-first century. \r\nBefore concluding, I wish to thank Ambassador \r\nHardeep Singh Puri, Permanent Representative of \r\nIndia, for introducing the report of the Security Council \r\n(A/67/2) on its work during the past year, as well as the \r\nAmbassador of Colombia and his team for their hard \r\nwork in putting the report together.\r\nMr. Šćepanović (Montenegro): At the outset, allow \r\nme to thank the representative of India for introducing \r\nthe annual report of the Security Council (A/67/2) at \r\nthe 38th meeting, and the delegation of Colombia for \r\npreparing it. However, I will limit my intervention \r\nto agenda item 117, entitled “Question of equitable \r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of \r\nthe Security Council and related matters”. \r\nI would like to thank the President for his efforts to \r\nadvance the Security Council reform process during the \r\nsixty-seventh session of the General Assembly. I also \r\nwish to congratulate the Permanent Representative of \r\nAfghanistan, Ambassador Tanin, on his reappointment \r\nas chair of the intergovernmental negotiations.\r\nSecurity Council reform is an ongoing process that \r\nshould neither be limited in time nor unnecessarily \r\ndelayed. That having been said, yet another round of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations is now behind us. Our \r\nexchanges within the framework of the eighth round of \r\nnegotiations proved to be very useful and practical, as \r\nthey helped us all to attain a better and more detailed \r\nunderstanding of each of the five proposals put forward. \r\nThanks to the extensive deliberations that took \r\nplace in previous rounds, especially the last, I dare to \r\nsay that there are really no more unknowns in any of \r\nthe proposals. On the contrary, we have learned about \r\nimpacts and consequences. States not members of \r\nthe Council  need to know first-hand and objectively \r\nthe decisions and positions of Council members, not \r\nthrough the lens of the mass media, with its distortions.\r\nTo conclude, I once again express Kazakhstan’s \r\ncommitment to engage in the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations and work in a spirit of compromise and \r\ncooperation in order to speedily finalize Security \r\nCouncil reform. The reform process cannot wait very \r\nmuch longer, given the new emerging global geopolitical \r\nrealities and socioeconomic developments, which call \r\nfor a realistic and results-driven approach.\r\nMrs. Namgyel (Bhutan): First of all, I would like \r\nto associate ourselves with the statement delivered \r\nat the 38th meeting by Ambassador Raymond Wolfe, \r\nPermanent Representative of Jamaica, who spoke on \r\nbehalf of the group of countries that sponsored draft \r\nresolution A/61/L.69, of which the Kingdom of Bhutan \r\nis a member. We believe that the points he made reflect \r\nnot only the views of the largest and most representative \r\ngroup working on agenda item 117 but also clearly point \r\nthe way forward on the most important tasks facing the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nWhile seven years have passed since the World \r\nSummit’s call for early reform of the Security Council, \r\neach passing day adds to the obsolescence of a system \r\ndevised for a world that, after more than 60 years, has \r\nchanged beyond recognition. My delegation recognizes \r\nthe various other groups that are also engaged in \r\ntrying to contribute to moving the process forward. \r\nIn that regard, my delegation would like to express \r\nits deep appreciation for the Herculean efforts of \r\nAmbassador Zahir Tanin of Afghanistan. We welcome \r\nhis reappointment as chair of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations.\r\nMy delegation is deeply encouraged by the progress \r\nbeing made in the intergovernmental negotiations on \r\nSecurity Council reform over the past few years. The \r\nprogress, however modest, must be seen in the light \r\nof the fact that the arrangements we agree to must \r\naccommodate the views of 193 Member States. My \r\ndelegation would therefore urge that there be greater \r\neffort and negotiations in good faith so as to arrive at \r\nconsensus on that very important issue.\r\nBhutan aspired to a non-permanent seat on the \r\nCouncil at the recent elections, and we deeply value the \r\nexperience we had in interacting with every Member \r\nState during the campaign. We firmly believe that \r\n24 12-59231\r\nA/67/PV.39\r\nLet us therefore leave behind old practices and \r\nmethods that have proved to be insufficient and \r\nineffective. We cannot gain by exploiting each other’s \r\nweaknesses. Instead, we must be innovative. We \r\nmust explore and unite our strengths and advantages, \r\nbecause a reformed and improved Security Council is \r\nour common goal and necessity.\r\nMr. Sareer (Maldives): Let me begin by \r\nexpressing our profound appreciation to Ambassador \r\nHardeep Singh Puri, Permanent Representative of \r\nIndia and current President of the Security Council, \r\nfor introducing the report of the Security Council \r\n(A/67/2) at the 38th meeting. I would also like to \r\nwelcome the reappointment of Ambassador Zahir \r\nTanin, Permanent Representative of Afghanistan, as \r\nchair of the intergovernmental negotiations. Under his \r\nchairmanship, we look forward to a very substantive \r\ndiscussion on the issue of the comprehensive reform of \r\nthe Security Council during the current session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMaldives and other Member States have, on \r\nnumerous occasions over the past decades, expressed \r\ntheir desire to see wide-ranging reforms of the Security \r\nCouncil and to make the Organization more effective. \r\nSuch reforms have now become an integral part of the \r\nOrganization as it addresses the challenges and difficult \r\ntasks before the international community today. \r\nAs we have heard during the debate, there is a clear \r\nneed to update the configuration and working methods \r\nof the Security Council to make it more representative \r\nand transparent. In that regard, comprehensive Security \r\nCouncil reform lies at the heart of our efforts to revamp \r\nan international structure that came into being more \r\nthan 67 years ago. \r\nFor the United Nations to make progress as an \r\ninstitution that is effective and credible in the eyes of \r\nthe world, the Security Council must be expanded and \r\nrestructured to reflect today’s geopolitical realities. The \r\nMaldives is of the view that including both India and \r\nJapan in any future composition of the Security Council \r\nremains an important and fundamental prerequisite for \r\nthe reform and effective functioning of the Council in \r\nthe twenty-first century.\r\nWe welcome the President’s statement on the \r\nquestion of equitable representation on and increase \r\nin the membership of the Security Council and \r\nhis commitment to finding a just and agreed-on \r\nmethodology to move things forward. My delegation \r\nand become very familiar with even their smallest \r\ndetails and particularities. For a process as complex as \r\nthat of Security Council reform, that is very important. \r\nBut there comes a time when one must ask whether \r\npursuing further deliberations in this fashion would \r\nmake any sense, because even though we call the \r\nprocess intergovernmental negotiations, we have yet to \r\nengage in real, substantive negotiations. \r\nWhat we have seen so far is a repetition of the same \r\nor slightly modified rhetoric that has led us to a point \r\nwhere we must admit that we have hardly moved from \r\nthe starting point. It is obvious and urgently important \r\nfor the relevance of the Security Council that we cannot \r\ncontinue with business as usual. It is up to us, the Member \r\nStates, together with Ambassador Tanin, to find a new \r\napproach in order to engage in a more constructive and \r\nresults-oriented manner that will bring us closer to \r\nthe desired reform, that is, a reform with the broadest \r\npossible acceptance with respect to all five of its \r\naspects. In that context, it could prove useful to strive \r\nto develop a base for a possible compromise solution \r\nwith a common denominator that could be further built \r\nupon. A building block with that orientation could \r\nbe the African common position and the historical \r\ninjustice inflicted upon the African continent.\r\nWe must constantly remind ourselves that \r\nnegotiating is a process of give and take. We all need \r\nto show a high degree of f lexibility and pragmatism \r\nin order to create an atmosphere of trust and good \r\nfaith that will allow us to take concrete steps towards \r\naccomplishing our ultimate goal. Keeping the big \r\npicture of overall reform in sight, we cannot focus just \r\non self-interest and aspirations; rather, we have to take \r\ninto account those of others as well, if we truly want \r\nto make a breakthrough. In addition, in keeping with \r\nour position, it is of the utmost importance that we \r\nbe realistic and cognizant of the fact that some of the \r\nexisting proposals, if not individually, then as part of the \r\nlarger incorporated package, are definitely not feasible \r\nand could indeed turn out to be counterproductive to \r\nthe work of Security Council.\r\nWe should be under no illusion — getting to a \r\npackage solution on Security Council reform will be \r\nextremely difficult and a rather challenging task. I \r\nbelieve that every single Member State has a stake in \r\nthis matter and wants to see the Council reformed in a \r\nway that makes it more transparent and representative \r\nand better suited to cope with the global security \r\nchallenges that are not lacking today’s world. \r\n12-59231 25\r\nA/67/PV.39\r\nfor the past 20 years. Only by working together can \r\nwe achieve a Security Council that is representative, \r\nefficient and able to deal with the complex challenges \r\nof the world we live in.\r\nMr. Gálvez (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): I would like \r\nto begin by thanking the Permanent Representative of \r\nColombia for preparing the annual report of the Security \r\nCouncil (A/67/2) and the representative of India for \r\nintroducing it, at the 38th meeting, in his capacity as \r\nPresident of the Council for the month of November. \r\nThe presentation of the report by the Security \r\nCouncil to the General Assembly is very important, as \r\nthe report is a record of the Council’s work and chiefly \r\nbecause it provides transparency with regard to the \r\nmanagement of the Council and has the potential to \r\nenable improvement in some procedures that need it.\r\nWhile recognizing the effort and progress made by \r\nthe Security Council and the delegation of Colombia \r\nin preparing the report, we are convinced that there is \r\nroom for the report to grow and recast itself as a more \r\nsubstantive document. It is a good record of meetings \r\nand issues dealt with, but in its current format it does \r\nnot enable us to understand the development of an issue, \r\nand even less to explain the logic and reasoning applied \r\nin any action undertaken.\r\nTo be sure, there have been improvements in recent \r\nyears, but we cannot be complacent about the situation. \r\nThere is nothing preventing us from moving in the right \r\ndirection and insisting, for instance, on the importance \r\nof coordinating the Security Council’s work with \r\nthat of other United Nations agencies and of regional \r\ngroups or of listening to special representatives at the \r\nright time and holding more interactive debates and \r\nconsultations. We are convinced that making progress \r\nin that direction, which allows for the smooth and \r\nf lexible exchange of information, is a good tool for \r\npreventing potential conflicts. It can make possible a \r\nglobal and comprehensive vision in which the interests \r\nand concerns of the various stakeholders involved in a \r\nparticular issue are recognized by the Security Council \r\nand can, to a greater or lesser degree, be incorporated \r\ninto its decisions.\r\nAdequate and smooth communication between the \r\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly that respects \r\ntheir particular areas of competence is fundamental to \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security, in \r\naccordance with the principles and central objectives \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations in a more complex \r\ncommends the recent positive results achieved during \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations on the matter \r\nand stresses the need to maintain the momentum in \r\naddressing specific areas of reform. The thematic \r\nrounds of discussions held during the past session, \r\ndedicated to Member States’ initiatives, were extremely \r\nhelpful. The frank and open discussions provided an \r\nopportunity for Member States to assess the various \r\nviewpoints being presented and to identify the points \r\nof convergence and divergence in the five key areas of \r\nreform.\r\nWhile the Council’s composition remains a key \r\npriority, we believe that its working methods must also \r\nbe improved with a view to restoring the Council’s \r\ncredibility, authority and legitimacy within the United \r\nNations system. In that regard, we applaud the initiative \r\ntaken by the group of five small States earlier in the \r\nyear, which put forward a useful guide in improving the \r\nworking methods of the Council (see A/66/L.42/Rev.2).\r\nWe believe that the expanded membership of the \r\nnew Council should come from both developing and \r\ndeveloped countries and should include countries that \r\nreflect the diverse membership of the United Nations. \r\nHowever, geographic representation alone should \r\nnot be a deciding factor in determining permanent \r\nmembership on the Council. Other considerations, such \r\nas a country’s ability to contribute to the maintenance \r\nof international peace and security and its commitment \r\nto the promotion and protection of human rights and \r\ndemocracy, should be taken on board.\r\nMaldives firmly believes that the Assembly must \r\nbe fully committed to implementing the provisions of \r\nits decision 62/557 and subsequent decisions, in letter \r\nand in spirit, in order to carry out comprehensive and \r\nwide-ranging reforms of the Security Council. We fully \r\nsupport the stand taken by the President of the General \r\nAssembly to advance the reform process through a \r\nconstructive and consultative process in informal \r\nplenary meetings. Furthermore, we call for the widest \r\npossible political acceptance by Member States in the \r\nnegotiation process. We believe that a failure to reach \r\nconsensus should not prevent action on these important \r\nreforms.\r\nBefore I conclude, I would like to express my hope \r\nthat consensus can be achieved on a solution to the \r\nissues of the general reform and composition of the \r\nSecurity Council. We must be united in our resolve and \r\npragmatic in our approach in order to break the impasse \r\nthat has caused United Nations reform to stagnate \r\n26 12-59231\r\nA/67/PV.39\r\nthat appeal and call for the necessary f lexibility from \r\nall parties in order to reach formulations that are \r\nacceptable to all.\r\nNotwithstanding what I have referred to, there \r\nseems to be an opinion shared by the majority on the \r\nimportance and necessity of improving the working \r\nmethods of the Security Council in order to ensure \r\ngreater transparency and inclusiveness. In that regard, \r\nmy delegation believes that nothing should prevent us \r\nfrom making progress on issues on which there is a \r\ncommon position — above all as it seems, for the time \r\nbeing, that there is no political will for comprehensive \r\nreform. Let us not make this process a futile exercise. \r\nAlthough we recognize how important working \r\nmethods are to Member States, we nevertheless appeal \r\nto delegations, in particular the permanent members \r\nof the Security Council, to work together to find or \r\ndevelop the tools that will allow us to make progress \r\non this issue. \r\nMr. Escalona Ojeda (Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela) (spoke in Spanish): We support the statement \r\nmade by the representative of Egypt on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement. \r\nThe annual report of the Security Council \r\n(A/67/2), which covers the period from 1 August 2011 \r\nto 31 July 2012, is like an inventory of the activities carried \r\nout by that organ pursuant to the powers granted to it by \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations on how to ensure the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. We \r\nbelieve that the Security Council continues to consider \r\nissues and to adopt resolutions that go above and beyond \r\nthe powers granted to it by the Charter. \r\nThe world is in the midst of a process of an imperial \r\nhegemony being imposed upon it, and that includes the \r\nUnited Nations. That colonization can be seen in the \r\n“securitization” of the General Assembly’s agenda, \r\nand it is reflected in the report that we are considering. \r\nItems include women and peace and security, the \r\npromotion and strengthening of the rule of law in \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security, \r\nthe imposition of security sector reform in some \r\ncountries and topics such as climate change, drugs and \r\norganized crime, justice and the rule of law, among \r\nothers. All of those topics have been discussed, and \r\ninstruments have been adopted that enable the Security \r\nCouncil to intervene in areas under the jurisdiction of \r\nthe General Assembly, thus impeding the democratic \r\nprocess in the Assembly. \r\nand dynamic international environment. However, we \r\nregret the decision to return to joint consideration of \r\nthe report of the Security Council and the question of \r\nequitable representation on and increased membership \r\nin the Council and related matters. In our opinion, \r\nkeeping them separate would have allowed for a better \r\ndiscussion and analysis of both.\r\nWith regard to agenda item 117, entitled “Question \r\nof equitable representation on and increase in the \r\nmembership of the Security Council and related \r\nmatters”, my country is grateful for the President’s \r\nletter of 9 November, which expresses his personal \r\ncommitment to this subject during his term. We welcome \r\nthe decision to reappoint the Permanent Representative \r\nof Afghanistan, Ambassador Zahir Tanin, to lead the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on Council reform. \r\nAfter the eighth round of those negotiations, we \r\nhope that during the current session we can show the \r\npolitical will and f lexibility that will enable us to make \r\nconcrete progress with reform that is as essential as it \r\nis desired. Ambassador Tanin can count on our support \r\nand cooperation.\r\nAs we have stated repeatedly in this forum and during \r\nthe recent intergovernmental negotiations, my country \r\nis a firm believer in an expanded Security Council and \r\nreaffirms its position on the need to have equitable \r\nrepresentation within the Council. In that regard, we \r\nsupport an increase in the number of both permanent and \r\nnon-permanent members, with a particular preference \r\nfor developing countries, even if the right to the veto \r\nis not extended to the new members. We offer bilateral \r\nsupport for the admission of Brazil, Germany, India \r\nand Japan to permanent membership in the Council. \r\nSimilarly, we believe that the underrepresentation of \r\nAfrica in the Council’s current makeup must be dealt \r\nwith. The number of African countries and the fact \r\nthat a large percentage of the matters with which the \r\nCouncil deals are related to situations in that continent \r\nmake a greater African presence essential. In addition, \r\nwe reiterate our commitment on this issue and would \r\nlike to emphasize the need for more transparent and \r\nparticipatory working methods in order to enhance the \r\ncapacity and legitimacy of the Organization. \r\nDuring the negotiations round table, we made an \r\nurgent appeal to delegations to abandon absolutist \r\npositions and make progress on the serious and broad-\r\nranging discussion that allow us to bring together the \r\nperspectives and aspirations of Member States in a \r\ndemocratic and respectful way. Today we reiterate \r\n12-59231 27\r\nA/67/PV.39\r\ndiscredits the democratic process within the United \r\nNations.\r\nThe report submitted by the Security Council \r\nshows that some members of the Council choose to \r\nuse threats to international peace and security for their \r\nown convenience, arbitrarily using Chapter VII of the \r\nCharter and blackmailing others with their military \r\nsuperiority, which makes the world more unstable and \r\nless safe. \r\nGeneral Assembly resolutions should be binding \r\nin nature, and the responsibility for international peace \r\nand security must be upheld by the General Assembly. \r\nThis body, the most universal, inclusive and democratic \r\nbody of the United Nations, should be the one that \r\nresolves such important issues.\r\nWith the presentation of the annual report of \r\nthe Security Council to the General Assembly, we \r\nmust reiterate our demand, as a Member State, that \r\nthey not continue to usurp the functions that are the \r\nsole and exclusive responsibility of the organs of the \r\nUnited Nations system. The champions of war and \r\ninterventionism are trying to weaken the role of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. In that connection, Venezuela calls \r\nfor a revamping and a democratization of the United \r\nNations so that it represents the aspirations of all \r\npeoples and so that international relations become more \r\ndemocratic, as well as to prevent global powers backed \r\nby the use of force from setting the global agenda and, \r\nin doing so, also setting the United Nations agenda. In \r\nthat way, we would be saving multilateralism and the \r\nagency of our peoples.\r\nWith regard to the question of Security Council \r\nreform, we would like to thank Ambassador Zahir Tanin \r\nof Afghanistan for his efforts as coordinator aimed \r\nat promoting negotiations towards consensus among \r\nMember States. Venezuela is convinced that the General \r\nAssembly must remain the principal deliberative body \r\nof the United Nations and maintain its independence \r\nfrom other organs. It is crucial that we reverse the trend \r\nby which the Security Council involves itself in areas \r\nnot under its jurisdiction, thereby undermining the \r\ncentral role of the General Assembly.\r\nWhen it comes to the reform of the Security \r\nCouncil, Venezuela supports the expansion of \r\nthe permanent and non-permanent categories of \r\nmembership. Council reform must ensure the inclusion \r\nof developing countries from Africa and Latin America \r\nand the Caribbean among the permanent members, as \r\nMoreover, we are very concerned to see that some \r\npeacekeeping operations receive mandates to interfere \r\nwith the sovereignty of countries that have emerged \r\nfrom violent conflicts. Taking advantage of their \r\ninstitutional weaknesses, they try to impose forms of \r\norganization, laws and institutional models that are not \r\nan innate part of those peoples’ aspirations. \r\nTopics of great importance for international peace, \r\nin the period under review, have been a source of great \r\nconcern for countries, such as my own, that promote \r\nrespect for the territorial integrity, sovereignty, \r\nindependence and self-determination of peoples and \r\nrespect for human rights and humanitarian rights. \r\nThe systematic transgression of laws by Israel as \r\nan occupying Power is treated under the item on the \r\nevolution of the situation in the Middle East, including \r\nthe question of Palestine. But that evolution is no more \r\nthan a systematic violation of human rights, especially \r\nif we bear in mind the ongoing occupation of Palestinian \r\nland. The atrocities committed by the State of Israel \r\nagainst the Palestinian people are unacceptable. They \r\nexpose the double standards of those who exercise their \r\nveto right to condemn the Palestinian people. \r\nThe report is not objective when it comes to \r\nSyria. Security Council members tried to boycott \r\nthe mediation to stop the war, for they are working \r\nto overthrow the Government. They are renouncing \r\ndemocratic procedures and violating the principle of \r\nthe self-determination of peoples in order to change the \r\ngeostrategic balance of the region, thereby deferring \r\nany possibilities for peace. \r\nPerhaps the darkest chapter in the report is the \r\nsection dealing with Libya. If a historian a few decades \r\nfrom now looks at the role of the Security Council, \r\nhe will conclude that that body was an instrument of \r\ndestruction and death in that region, where NATO \r\nplayed a nefarious role with clear international impunity. \r\nWe contiue to believe that it is extremely dangerous to \r\ncontinue to use the defence of human rights as a pretext \r\nto destroy a country, thus in fact curtailing its capacity \r\nto act as a free nation.\r\nMediation is an obstacle to war and is constantly \r\nshunned by countries that are trying to dominate us \r\nwith their belligerence. We are concerned to see that \r\nthe report overlooks the many recommendations that \r\nMember States have made during open debates, where, \r\nit seems, our ideas are falling on deaf ears. That \r\n28 12-59231\r\nA/67/PV.39\r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations on the question \r\nof equitable representation on and increase in the \r\nmembership of the Security Council and related \r\nmatters. We welcome his reappointment as chair of \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations and assure him of \r\nTanzania’s continued support in his endeavours.\r\nWe take note of the chair’s recommendations of \r\nJuly 2012, in particular with regard to the need to move \r\nto the next stage of negotiations based on a concise \r\nworking document and the convening of a high-level \r\nmeeting on Security Council reform. The chair could \r\nassist us further by elaborating on his proposals for \r\nthe sake of clarity and precision. We encourage all \r\nMember States to support the chair and the President \r\nof the General Assembly in moving the reform agenda \r\nforward during the sixty-seventh session of the General \r\nAssembly.\r\nThe need for Africa’s views and wishes to be \r\ntaken into account whenever the Security Council \r\ndecides on matters concerning the continent can never \r\nbe overemphasized. We must therefore discourage \r\nincidents where the interests and opinions of the \r\ncontinent are either circumvented or ignored. It is \r\nencouraging, however, to note that the Security Council \r\ncontinues to work closely with regional and subregional \r\norganizations as provided for under the Charter. That \r\npartnership as witnessed in Darfur, the Sudan, South \r\nSudan, Somalia and Mali is encouraging and should be \r\nstrengthened.\r\nWe value and commend the practice by the Council \r\nof holding open debates and consultations, including \r\nconsultations with the troop- and police-contributing \r\ncountries pursuant to resolution 1353 (2001). We \r\nbelieve that, looking forward, that approach is essential \r\nfor ensuring the transparency, vibrancy and relevance \r\nof the Council.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to underline the importance of \r\nthe present joint debate to consider matters of concern \r\nto the entire membership of the United Nations. We \r\nshould ensure that recommendations agreed upon by \r\nMember States are utilized to improve the efficiency \r\nand effectiveness of the work done in the Security \r\nCouncil and elsewhere.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on these items. May I take it that \r\nthe General Assembly takes note of the report of the \r\nSecurity Council contained in document A/67/2?\r\nwell as an increase in non-permanent seats for them, \r\nsuch that the expanded Security Council will ref lect \r\na numerical formula containing 25 or 26 members, \r\nwhich would give that organ greater balance in its \r\nrepresentation, incorporating the diverse geographical, \r\npolitical and cultural realities of the world, primarily \r\nfrom the developing world.\r\nMr. Manongi (United Republic of Tanzania): \r\nThe United Republic of Tanzania associates itself \r\nwith the statements delivered at the 38th meeting by \r\nthe representatives of Egypt and Algeria on behalf of \r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement and the Group of African \r\nStates, respectively.\r\nWe welcome the report of the Security Council \r\n(A/67/2) and thank His Excellency Ambassador \r\nSingh Puri of India for his introduction, as well as the \r\nPermanent Mission of Colombia for having prepared \r\nthe report. We believe that the report is one of the few \r\nways by which the General Assembly can monitor the \r\nactivities of the Security Council.\r\nWe are encourages that during the reporting period \r\nthe Council discharged its mandate satisfactorily, \r\nsave for a few instances were consensus among the \r\nPermanent Members proved elusive. It is important that \r\nthe Council should speak with one voice on matters \r\nrequiring its undivided attention and action.\r\nDespite the satisfactory operations of the Security \r\nCouncil, we believe that a comprehensive reform of the \r\nCouncil is long overdue. We must reform the Security \r\nCouncil to reflect the realities of the day, with a view \r\nto enabling it to meet the expectations of the Member \r\nStates as envisaged in the Charter.\r\nReform of the Security Council is an imperative \r\nfor the sake of its continued credibility and legitimacy. \r\nIn that regard, Tanzania has long advocated for a \r\ncomprehensive reform of the Security Council in line \r\nwith the Ezulwini Consensus, which calls for two \r\npermanent seats and five non-permanent seats for \r\nAfrica.\r\nNonetheless, we should never miss an opportunity \r\nto undertake reform on those issues which seem to enjoy \r\nthe wider backing of Member States, including the \r\nimprovement of the working methods of the Council. \r\nMy delegation strongly believes that a breakthrough to \r\nthe current impasse is urgently needed.\r\nIn that regard, we commend the work of \r\nAmbassador Zahir Tanin of Afghanistan, the chair of \r\n12-59231 29\r\nA/67/PV.39\r\nSecondly, with regard to the so-called resolutions, \r\nthe Government of the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea totally rejected them as soon as they were \r\nadopted. If the Security Council is serious about \r\npeace and security on the Korean peninsula and in the \r\nregion, it should have taken issue with, and raised the \r\nissue of, the joint hostilities of the United States and \r\nSouth Korea against the sovereignty of the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea. It should have taken issue \r\nwith their large-scale, ever-increasing aggravation of \r\ntensions on the Korean peninsula through joint military \r\nexercises, which are estimated to have involved half a \r\nmillion troops in one single exercise at the beginning \r\nof this year. But it has never taken issue with them; yet, \r\nthey have taken issue with our peaceful satellite launch, \r\nin violation of international law. We therefore regard \r\nthose exercises as illegal and totally reject them. \r\nThe nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula is the \r\nproduct of the United States hostile policy against the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea. The hostile \r\npolicy of the United States has continued for over half a \r\ncentury, with nuclear blackmail directly threatening the \r\nsurvival of the nation and threatening the sovereignty of \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Therefore, \r\nour nuclear deterrent is a war deterrent and a response \r\nto the threat and hostilities of the United States in order \r\nto defend our country and safeguard our sovereignty \r\nand our right to existence as a nation.\r\nConcerning South Korea’s allegation, it is absurd \r\nand ridiculous when one considers that the South \r\nKoreans just recently received approval from the United \r\nStates to extend the range of their missiles from 300 \r\nto over 800 kilometres, and when one also considers \r\nthat South Korea is under the nuclear umbrella of the \r\nUnited States. Therefore, South Korea has no legal or \r\nmoral justification to raise somebody else’s issues. As \r\nfar as the United States and South Korea’s extension \r\nof their missiles’ range, they have no say in what we \r\ndo now — whether we launch satellites or we launch \r\nballistic missiles. \r\nConcerning the remarks of Japan’s representative, \r\nagain we totally reject them as misleading the public and \r\nwarping reality. Japan does not have the qualifications \r\nto become a noble permanent member of the Security \r\nCouncil, which deals with international peace and \r\nsecurity. The delegation of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea would like to clarify the following \r\nposition.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: I shall now give the f loor \r\nto those representatives who wish to speak in exercise \r\nof the right of reply. May I remind members that \r\nstatements in exercise of the right of reply are limited to \r\n10 minutes for the first intervention and to five minutes \r\nfor the second intervention, and should be made by \r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Kodama (Japan): My delegation would like to \r\nexercise its right to reply in response to the statement \r\nmade by the representative of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea. \r\nJapan has been making serious efforts to contribute \r\nactively and constructively to the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security and the promotion of \r\nprosperity in the world. Indeed, Japan has been elected \r\nas a member of the Security Council 10 times since \r\nits accession to the United Nations, in 1956, and has \r\nbeen devoting the utmost effort to contribute to the \r\nCouncil in a responsible manner. Is there any better \r\nmeasure or vote of confidence in Japan shown by \r\nStates Members of the United Nations than our track \r\nrecord of being elected to the Security Council 10 \r\ntimes by a more than two-thirds majority? We believe \r\nthat our policies and actions over many decades speak \r\nfor themselves. Japan has demonstrated that it has \r\nthe determination, willingness and capacity to take \r\non further responsibility as a permanent member in a \r\nreformed Security Council. We trust in the judgment of \r\nother Member States regarding Japan’s contributions.\r\nMr. Ri Tong Il (Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea): I want to clarify the position of the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea concerning the statements \r\nof the representatives of South Korea and Japan. \r\nConcerning the representative of South Korea’s \r\nstatement on the peaceful satellite launch and nuclear \r\ntest and Security Council sanctions, all those allegations \r\nare misleading the public and are far from the true \r\nreality on the ground.  In that regard, the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea would like to clarify its \r\nposition as follows. \r\nFirst, the satellite launch of the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea was fully in exercise \r\nof its sovereign right under international law. The \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea is a State party \r\nto the Outer Space Treaty, which stipulates that it is \r\nevery country’s right to carry out peaceful activities in \r\nouter space. \r\n30 12-59231\r\nA/67/PV.39\r\nSecondly, Japan is reflected in the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations as an enemy State — a status that no \r\nother country has been left in. Japan cannot fulfil the \r\nnoble responsibility under the Charter of serving on \r\nthe Security Council. It is creating territorial disputes \r\nwith neighbouring countries, with the current Japanese \r\nGovernment openly pursuing militarism. It is hell-bent \r\non becoming a military power and it will repeat its past \r\ncrimes. Given that reality, Japan cannot be a permanent \r\nmember; it does not have any moral justification.\r\nThe Acting President: The General Assembly has \r\nthus concluded this stage of its consideration of agenda \r\nitem 30 and agenda item 117.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.20 p.m.\r\nFirst, the Japanese Government has never sincerely \r\napologized for its past crimes and never taken action \r\nto settle and provide compensation for those crimes. \r\nIt is the only country in the world that totally rejects \r\nand glorifies its crimes. On the Korean peninsula \r\nalone, during the colonial military war, Japan abducted \r\nand drafted 8.4 million Korean people; it massacred \r\n1 million people; and it abducted 200,000 Korean \r\nwomen to be comfort sex slaves for its imperial army. \r\nIn the history of the world, no army has taken those \r\nkinds of sex slaves. That is an extraordinary crime \r\nagainst humanity. Even countries allied with Japan \r\nintroduced resolutions in their Parliaments denouncing \r\nsuch an act and asking for compensation and an \r\napology. However, Japan continues to challenge the \r\ninternational community. \r\n"
