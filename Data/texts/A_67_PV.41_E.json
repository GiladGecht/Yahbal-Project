We are happy to see that \r\nthat message is reinforced by the outstandingly high \r\nnumber of delegations that have joined in sponsoring \r\nthe draft resolution. Germany, as facilitator, would \r\nlike to take this opportunity to briefly highlight four \r\nkey messages of the draft resolution that reflect those \r\ndevelopments.\r\nFirst, the draft resolution is about transition in the \r\nfield of security. We note with satisfaction that transition \r\nis progressing continuously. The implementation of the \r\nfirst three tranches of transition is currently unfolding. \r\nMindful of the many challenges in the process, we are \r\nlooking forward to its phased completion in the rest of \r\nthe country. The mid-2013 milestone, when Afghans will \r\nbe living in areas where the Afghan National Security \r\nForces (ANSF) have taken lead security responsibility, \r\nis a particularly encouraging step in that regard.\r\nThe focus of the draft resolution is on improving the \r\noperational capabilities of the Afghan National Security \r\nForces. At the Bonn Conference, the international \r\ncommunity committed itself to supporting the Afghan \r\nGovernment throughout transition and beyond to that \r\nend. Increasing emphasis will be put on training, \r\nequipping and advising the Afghan National Security \r\nForces as they gradually take over full security \r\nresponsibility throughout the country. With a view to \r\nthe end of transition at the end of 2014 and as part of \r\nthe wider objective of further empowering and enabling \r\nAfghan institutions in line with the Kabul process, that \r\nis where our priority rightly belongs.\r\nAt the NATO Summit held in Chicago earlier \r\nthis year, the priority to continue to develop the \r\nAfghan National Security Forces so that it is capable \r\nof providing security to all Afghans was reaffirmed. \r\nNATO allies and International Security Assistance \r\nForce partner countries committed themselves to work \r\ntowards establishing a training, advising and assistance \r\nmission. They also reaffirmed their commitment to play \r\ntheir part in the financial sustainability of the ANSF \r\nin the long term, with a view to the assumption of \r\nincreasing financial responsibility by the Government \r\nof Afghanistan.\r\nUnited Nations A/67/PV.41\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-seventh session\r\n41st plenary meeting\r\nTuesday, 27 November 2012, 10 a.m.\r\nNew York\r\nOffi cial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Jeremić  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Serbia)\r\n2 12-60766\r\nA/67/PV.41\r\nA stable security environment guaranteed by the \r\nAfghan National Security Forces is key to the further \r\ndevelopment of Afghanistan. In that context, long-term \r\nstrategic partnership agreements concluded between \r\nthe Government of Afghanistan and its partners will \r\ncontribute to creating an environment conducive to \r\nestablishing lasting peace, security and stability in \r\nAfghanistan and the region.\r\nSecondly, the draft resolution is about a long-\r\nterm commitment by the international community \r\nthroughout the transformation decade declared by \r\nthe Government of Afghanistan and its international \r\npartners at the Bonn Conference. During the past \r\ndecade, Afghanistan has made notable progress in \r\nmany fields of governance and development, including \r\nhealth, education and infrastructure. \r\nYet challenges remain in many fields. Afghanistan \r\nand the international community therefore renewed and \r\nreinvigorated their long-term partnership at the Tokyo \r\nConference in July. Building on a unique framework \r\nof mutual accountability, the international community \r\nhas generously pledged to provide $16 billion through \r\n2015 to support the economic and political stabilization \r\nof Afghanistan. Furthermore, the international \r\ncommunity will sustain its support at or near levels of \r\nthe past decade through 2017.\r\nIn return, the Government of Afghanistan has \r\ncommitted itself to achieving its development and \r\ngovernance goals, such as conducting credible, \r\ninclusive and transparent elections, fostering respect \r\nfor the rule of law and protecting and promoting human \r\nrights, in accordance with the stipulations of the Tokyo \r\nMutual Accountability Framework. Afghan ownership \r\nis again the foundation for the transformation decade, \r\nas clearly reflected in the principles of aid effectiveness \r\ncontained in the Accountability Framework. Today, the \r\nGeneral Assembly will send that renewed message of \r\nsolidarity to our Afghan partners.\r\nThirdly, the draft resolution is about regional \r\ncooperation. Under the able leadership of Afghanistan \r\nand with the strong support of regional and international \r\npartners, the Istanbul Process on Regional Security and \r\nCooperation for a Secure and Stable Afghanistan has \r\nshown continued momentum since the Heart of Asia \r\nMinisterial Conference held in Kabul in June. A set \r\nof six confidence-building measures will contribute \r\nto fostering regional cooperation to enhance political, \r\nsecurity and economic stability throughout the region.\r\nThe Istanbul Process is intended to bring greater \r\ncoherence to the diversity of valuable regional \r\ninitiatives. Furthermore, the Process reflects the \r\ninterconnectedness of many challenges in Afghanistan. \r\nWithin that framework, the fight against terrorism and \r\nagainst the production and trafficking of illicit drugs \r\nis complemented by confidence-building measures in \r\nthe areas of education, infrastructure and economic \r\ndevelopment that are aimed at reducing poverty and \r\ncreating alternative sources of income for the Afghan \r\npopulation.\r\nFourthly, the draft resolution is about support to the \r\npeace and reconciliation process. The appointment of \r\nSalahuddin Rabbani as the Chairman of the High Peace \r\nCouncil has revitalized the peace and reconciliation \r\nprocess after the heinous assassination of his father and \r\npredecessor in office. \r\nFor this Afghan-led and Afghan-owned process to \r\nyield sustainable results, it needs to be inclusive and \r\nmust respect the Afghan Constitution and its human \r\nrights provisions, the rights of women in particular, \r\nas well as the set of principles outlined most recently \r\nin the Bonn Conference conclusions. In that context, \r\nthe draft resolution reiterates appreciation for the \r\nefforts of the Government of Afghanistan on its path \r\nto advance the process and reaffirms the continued \r\nsupport of the international community in that regard. \r\nLast year, by establishing the Committee pursuant to \r\nresolution 1988 (2011), the Security Council set up \r\nan institutional framework conducive to fostering the \r\npeace and reconciliation process. The first results are \r\nencouraging.\r\nTo conclude, I would like to express my gratitude \r\nto all the delegations from all regions of the world \r\nthat have actively participated in this year’s informal \r\nconsultations on the draft resolution. Their tireless \r\nefforts and sense of responsibility are the foundation \r\nupon which the strong message of the draft resolution \r\nrests. We are therefore happy to suggest that the General \r\nAssembly once again adopt the draft resolution on the \r\nsituation in Afghanistan by consensus.\r\nI would like to extend my appreciation to my \r\ncolleague Ambassador Zahir Tanin, as well as to \r\nCounsellor Youssof Ghafoorzai and their colleagues, \r\nfor their excellent cooperation, trust and friendship.\r\nGermany also wholeheartedly thanks the United \r\nNations offices in Afghanistan and New York alike for \r\ntheir excellent work for the future of Afghanistan. The \r\n12-60766 3\r\nA/67/PV.41\r\nrole of the United Nations and its Assistance Mission in \r\nsupport of Afghanistan will continue to be pivotal in all \r\nthe key areas I have outlined.\r\nMr. Tanin (Afghanistan): It is an honour to be here \r\ntoday to discuss the situation in Afghanistan. Today we \r\nwill adopt a draft resolution (A/67/L.16) that reaffirms \r\nthe Assembly’s commitment to Afghanistan’s peace, \r\nstability and prosperity.\r\nI wish to take this opportunity to express my \r\nappreciation to all representatives who contributed to \r\nthe draft resolution, especially the German delegation, \r\nheaded by His Excellency Ambassador Peter Wittig, for \r\ntheir dedication and leadership throughout the process. \r\nWe extend a special thanks to Daniel Schemske for his \r\nrole in facilitating the negotiations.\r\nIn 2001, following the overthrow of the Taliban \r\nregime, Afghanistan was a broken State with an \r\neconomy in shambles, a shattered infrastructure and \r\na society wearied by years of conflict. Virtually no \r\naspect of life in our country had been untouched by \r\nwar. Afghanistan has come a long way since then, and \r\nyet we still have far to go. Our path to lasting peace \r\nand sustainable development has not been without its \r\nchallenges. On the way forward, the supporting role of \r\nthe international community will be important, and it \r\nwill have a considerable effect on how successful the \r\nAfghan Government’s efforts can be.\r\nAfghanistan is approaching the end of a chapter, \r\nwith the conclusion of the existing framework of \r\ninternational military engagement. All focus is now on \r\nthe transition to Afghan-led security, governance and \r\ndevelopment. \r\nTransition in Afghanistan did not start in a vacuum. \r\nIt took us 11 years to reach this point. International \r\ninvolvement began over a decade ago and sought \r\nto eliminate the threat posed by Al-Qaida and its \r\nregional terrorist allies to global and regional peace \r\nand security. After long years of conflict and war, a \r\nbroad international coalition became engaged, with a \r\ncommitment to see Afghanistan through on its path to \r\npeace and stability.\r\nHowever, it was not only a military effort. The \r\nmost important thing for Afghans was to rebuild an \r\neffective State. Afghanistan started its journey a decade \r\nago to regain a legitimate and peaceful internal and \r\ninternational role in the region and worldwide. Since \r\n2001, significant achievements have been made, from \r\nthe building of schools and roads to the advancement \r\nof women, continuing economic growth and the \r\nstrengthening of our security forces. Today, women are \r\nplaying a vital role across all sectors of Afghan society \r\nand are being offered more economic opportunities. \r\nMillions of Afghan boys and girls are enrolled in \r\nschools, and increasing numbers of Afghan people now \r\nhave access to basic health services.\r\nAfghanistan is in a fundamentally different place \r\nfrom where we were in 2001, a time when the control \r\nof provinces changed hands constantly, human rights \r\nwere routinely violated, violence prevailed and the \r\ncentral authority had lost its relevance and power under \r\nthe pressure of internal confrontations. Eleven years \r\nlater, Afghanistan is looking to the future with hope \r\nand is aiming to stand on its feet and move towards \r\nnormalization.\r\nIn April 2014, Afghanistan will hold its third \r\npresidential elections to choose its new leadership, \r\nand by the end of 2014 the last foreign combat forces \r\nwill have left the country. With the election and the \r\nend of the military phase of international support, \r\na new chapter in Afghanistan is unfolding that is \r\ncharacterized by consolidated national sovereignty, \r\nself-reliance and stabilization of the situation. Those \r\nsimultaneous developments represent the beginning \r\nof a decade of sustainability that involves a number \r\nof vital, interconnected elements in both the short and \r\nlong terms. Those include the withdrawal of tens of \r\nthousands of combat forces, the full transfer of security \r\nresponsibility to the Afghan national army and police, a \r\nnew arrangement of the post-2014 international military \r\nengagement, the organization of free and fair elections, \r\nreconciliation aimed at ending the violence and \r\nbringing the armed opposition into the peace process, \r\nand capacity-building for a sustainable and functioning \r\nState that is able to maintain peace, stability and \r\ndemocracy in the country for years to come.\r\nThe transition framework is therefore the only \r\npath to long-term stability in Afghanistan. It puts the \r\nAfghan people at the centre of managing the country’s \r\nsecurity, governance and development. For the success \r\nof that transition, we need strong long-term support and \r\ndelivery from the international community.\r\nOver the past two years, the transition process \r\nhas been buttressed by the establishment of new \r\npartnerships with the international community and \r\nby attempts to turn negative potential into positive by \r\nseeking new forms of cooperation in our neighbourhood \r\nand the wider region. Afghanistan has worked \r\n4 12-60766\r\nA/67/PV.41\r\nwith international partners in that period to forge \r\nagreements on strategies to face the evolving situation \r\nin the country and to address all the necessary elements \r\nof a successful transition. From Lisbon to Chicago, we \r\nworked to map out the security transition. It is about \r\nenabling Afghan forces until and after 2014, sustaining \r\nlogistical and financial support, and providing \r\nAfghanistan the necessary assistance for forces to work \r\nunder the pressure of circumstances. Those plans are \r\nnow in motion. The security transition is on track in its \r\nthird tranche, during which 75 per cent of the country \r\nwill be under the control of Afghan security forces. \r\nAfghan forces are ready to take full control, as planned, \r\nbefore the withdrawal of international forces in 2014.\r\nWe see the decision at the Chicago NATO \r\nsummit — concerning shifting the role of the \r\ninternational military to a training, advising and \r\nassisting mission — as an important indication of \r\nenduring support for the Afghan people. Although \r\nmore details are yet to be determined, it is important \r\nfor Afghanistan to have the necessary guarantee \r\nof continuing military support as it assumes full \r\nresponsibility for security in the country. \r\nThe post-2014 international military engagement in \r\nAfghanistan is part of the security agreement that we \r\nrecently began to discuss with the United States in the \r\nlight of our strategic partnership. Based on our national \r\ninterests, we would like to see those negotiations lead \r\nus to an agreement that ensures long-term peace and \r\nstability in the country. The importance of national \r\nsovereignty remains at the heart of the Afghan \r\nperspective on any talks about future engagement \r\nbetween Afghanistan and its international partners.\r\nA successful transition is about successful \r\nelections. The Government of Afghanistan is committed \r\nto organizing fair, free and democratic elections that \r\ncan generate renewed energy for consolidating peace \r\nand stability. We would like to see the international \r\ncommunity continue to support the upcoming election \r\nprocess. We are certain that the election process will \r\nhelp to bring about more certainty for the Afghan people \r\nwith regard to the political transition. Furthermore, \r\nbroader participation by the Afghan people — including \r\nwomen and men from all walks of life — and the \r\nengagement of civil society will contribute to making \r\nthe next elections a new occasion for national consensus \r\nand unity that reflects our shared vision for building a \r\nbetter future.\r\nThe elections should be seen in connection with the \r\nongoing major effort to bring about stability and end \r\nviolence — the search for a political solution. We have \r\nwitnessed visible progress in the peace process with \r\nthe Taliban and other armed opposition groups. Serious \r\nsteps are being taken to prepare the ground responsibly \r\nfor peace talks and a possible breakthrough in the \r\nreconciliation process. Let there be no doubt: our peace \r\nprocess will not continue at the expense of the hard-\r\nwon progress of the past decade, including on human \r\nrights and, in particular, the rights of women. \r\nIt is important to note that there is now consensus \r\nabout the necessity for an Afghan-led and Afghan-\r\nowned peaceful solution and about the fact that the \r\npeace process is increasingly seen as a cross-cutting \r\nissue required for the success of the transition. We are \r\nencouraged by the increasing positive thinking among \r\na growing number of the armed opposition actors \r\nand by the support of other main actors for the peace \r\nprocess. The recent visit of the delegation of the High \r\nPeace Council to Islamabad and the release of a number \r\nof Taliban prisoners by the Government of Pakistan are \r\nimportant developments for creating an atmosphere \r\nconducive to a political solution.\r\nMr. Beck (Palau), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe efforts here at the United Nations have also \r\nbeen essential steps towards building the necessary \r\ntrust and confidence in the peace and reconciliation \r\nprocess. We are happy to see the continuing focus of the \r\nSecurity Council and the greater role that the Afghan \r\nGovernment now plays in the listing and delisting \r\nefforts of the Security Council Committee established \r\npursuant to resolution 1988 (2011). The Security \r\nCouncil’s commitment was clearly displayed this \r\nweek when the Chairman of the High Peace Council, \r\nMr. Salahuddin Rabbani, was asked to brief that \r\nCommittee and the members of the Security Council \r\non the progress made in the reconciliation process. That \r\nwas an opportunity to illustrate Afghanistan’s intention \r\nto have a greater role with regard to the Committee’s \r\nwork.\r\nA successful transition will allay concerns about \r\nthe possible vacuum created by the end of the military \r\nphase. In that connection, what is essential in the long \r\nterm is the economic sustainability of the Afghan State. \r\nAssisted by its international partners, Afghanistan is \r\nworking to ensure that the Afghan State can function \r\neffectively and that it moves from a primarily aid-based \r\n12-60766 5\r\nA/67/PV.41\r\neconomy to a self-sustaining one during the transition \r\nand transformation period. \r\nAt the Tokyo Conference in July, significant steps \r\nwere taken towards addressing that issue, including a \r\nclear expression of long-term financial commitment \r\nand the presentation of a shared vision in the form of \r\nthe Tokyo Mutual Accountability Framework, which \r\naddresses the need of our Government for core funding \r\nand the need of our development partners to know that \r\nthe money will be spent well. In Tokyo, the international \r\ncommunity committed to continued engagement in \r\nAfghanistan, while the Afghan Government committed \r\nto being financially responsible and and to focus on \r\ngood governance.\r\nEnding corruption and ensuring a transparent \r\nand efficient Administration that enjoys the full trust \r\nof the Afghan people remains a high priority. In that \r\nconnection, the Afghan Government has redoubled its \r\ncommitment to the rule of law and good governance. \r\nHis Excellency President Karzai’s decree of 21 July \r\nrepresents a comprehensive approach and instructs \r\nall ministries, agencies and independent departments \r\nto implement measures and reforms to eliminate \r\ncorruption and improve transparency.\r\nGlobal engagement in the past decade has \r\nbrought about an unprecedented level of regional and \r\ninternational interaction in Afghanistan. Afghanistan \r\nhas become a meeting place for dozens of global and \r\nregional Powers and organizations. The international \r\ncommunity has been linked to the stabilization and \r\nreconstruction efforts in the country — a fact that is \r\nreflected in the level of troop contributions, financial \r\nsupport and institution-building. As we complete \r\nthe transition, the current form of involvement will \r\nbe replaced a multitude of bilateral and multilateral \r\ncooperation arrangements between the Afghan State \r\nand its global and regional partners. With that in \r\nmind, we have begun developing various mechanisms \r\nfor bringing the greater region together for political, \r\neconomic and security cooperation. \r\nAt the centre of that effort is the Istanbul Process \r\non Regional Security and Cooperation for a Secure \r\nand Stable Afghanistan. Over the course of this year, \r\nwe have seen the Istanbul Process gain noteworthy \r\nmomentum in its efforts to unite the Heart of Asia \r\ncountries around the shared goal of peace and prosperity \r\nin Afghanistan, the region and beyond. The Istanbul \r\nProcess is turning into a central forum for regional \r\ncooperation that will enhance and bring coherence to \r\nregional initiatives through the confidence-building \r\nmeasures and various mechanisms for cooperation \r\nto which we have committed. With effective regional \r\ncooperation, Afghanistan is reclaiming its historic role \r\nin the region, with the potential to serve as a trade and \r\ntransport hub and a catalyst for broader collaboration.\r\nAfghanistan’s future is about sustainability. It is \r\nabout consolidating our successes and not losing what \r\nwe have worked to achieve over the past decade. For the \r\nremainder of the transition, we must not fall behind in \r\nour efforts for even a moment. The next two years are \r\nvital for the country. The Government of Afghanistan \r\nis committed to working each day to help the Afghan \r\npeople by developing infrastructure, protecting human \r\nrights, enhancing good governance and improving the \r\ndelivery of services, as outlined in the draft resolution \r\nwe are considering here today (A/67/L.16).\r\nHowever, the continuation of a violent campaign by \r\nthe enemies of peace, stability and prosperity remains \r\nthe greatest challenge to Afghanistan’s progress. \r\nThe irresponsible, vicious attacks on innocent \r\nAfghans — women and men — by the Taliban and \r\nother extremist armed groups are aiming to undermine \r\nour hard-earned achievements. But the Afghan people \r\nwill not be deterred from their struggle to bring peace \r\nand security to the country and to eliminate sources \r\nof destabilization. It is important that this struggle be \r\nsupported by all who want to see an end to terrorism and \r\nextremism. That is why close cooperation in the region, \r\nincluding with Pakistan, is essential. As President \r\nKarzai emphasized in his letter to Pakistani leaders on \r\n13 October, there is a need for both countries to take \r\ncoordinated, collaborative and serious action with \r\nstrong determination against terrorism and extremism.\r\nThe Past decade in Afghanistan has seen historic \r\nstrides. There are some who talk about a coming disaster \r\nas the international forces leave. We do not subscribe to \r\nsuch negative interpretations, but of course the future \r\nof Afghanistan hangs on many “ifs”. We are realistic \r\nin recognizing the variables in the coming years, but \r\nit is our responsibility, together with the international \r\ncommunity, to reduce uncertainties. We do not see the \r\ntransition as a cliff that could be fallen off with just \r\none false step. The transition is more than an idea. It is \r\na concrete concept with real resources and deliberate \r\nplans — plans that can shape realities. Afghanistan looks \r\nforward to working with the international community \r\nin the coming years to achieve the noble objective of \r\n6 12-60766\r\nA/67/PV.41\r\nbringing lasting peace, stability and prosperity to the \r\ncountry.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nobserver of the European Union. \r\nMr. Vrailas (European Union): I have the honour \r\nto speak on behalf of the European Union (EU). The \r\nacceding country Croatia; the candidate countries the \r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, \r\nIceland and Serbia; the countries of the Stabilization and \r\nAssociation Process and potential candidates Albania \r\nand Bosnia and Herzegovina; the European Free Trade \r\nAssociation country Norway, member of the European \r\nEconomic Area; as well as Ukraine, the Republic of \r\nMoldova, Armenia and Georgia, align themselves with \r\nthis statement.\r\nLike others, I would like to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report (A/67/354) and the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Afghanistan for his statement. I \r\nalso thank all delegations that participated in the \r\nconsultations on the draft resolution (A/67/L.16), \r\nintroduced today by the representative of Germany. We \r\nlook forward to its adoption once again by consensus.\r\nThe international conferences held in Bonn last \r\nyear and in Kabul and Tokyo earlier this year, as \r\nwell as the summit in Chicago, have reaffirmed the \r\npartnership between the Government of Afghanistan \r\nand the international community for Afghanistan’s \r\nlong-term security, economic growth and development. \r\nThose conferences have set out the way forward for \r\nAfghanistan to progressively assume responsibility \r\nfor all aspects of policy and to achieve its security, \r\ndevelopment and governance goals.\r\nIn the EU statement at the Security Council \r\ndebate on Afghanistan in September (see S/PV.6840), \r\nwe briefly highlighted the important outcome of the \r\nTokyo Conference, in particular the principle of mutual \r\naccountability encapsulated in the Tokyo Mutual \r\nAccountability Framework, and addressed the strategic \r\nissue of regional cooperation. The implementation of \r\nthe Tokyo Framework remains paramount in achieving \r\na successful transition in Afghanistan. \r\nFor this statement, we want to focus on two topics, \r\nnamely, progress on national reconciliation, and \r\npreparations for the upcoming election.\r\nWe welcome the recent visit of the High Peace \r\nCouncil to Pakistan, and we call on all regional \r\nGovernments to use their influence to encourage all \r\ngroups to support an Afghan-led peace and reconciliation \r\nprocess. Progress will be sustainable only if the process \r\nis truly inclusive, not only engaging armed groups \r\nbut fully involving civil society, including balanced \r\nregional and gender representation from all sections of \r\nAfghan society. Both the process and its outcome must \r\nrespect the Afghan Constitution, including its human \r\nrights provisions, in particular those on the rights of \r\nwomen and girls.\r\nWe also encourage particular attention to \r\nthe progressive implementation of the law on the \r\nelimination of violence against women. In that vein, \r\nwe wish to reiterate our firm commitment to Security \r\nCouncil resolution 1325 (2000) and all subsequent \r\nresolutions on women and peace and security. We \r\nwelcome the commitment of the Afghan Government \r\nto its full implementation through the establishment \r\nof the interministerial steering committee on \r\nresolution 1325 (2000).\r\nWe welcome the announcement of the date for the \r\npresidential election. It will be critical for Afghanistan’s \r\nfuture that elections be as inclusive and transparent \r\nas possible and leading to an outcome that is widely \r\naccepted as legitimate.\r\nWe call on the Afghan authorities to engage \r\nall political parties and civil society in agreeing an \r\nelectoral reform process that will put in place a legal \r\nframework for elections that is consistent with the \r\nConstitution, has credible measures to prevent fraud \r\nand is overseen by independent bodies. Early decisions \r\nby the relevant Afghan authorities on the system and \r\nregistration process to be used for elections will be \r\nwelcome, both to enable international support for the \r\nprocess and to allow for clear communication and voter \r\neducation.\r\nAllow me to reiterate our full support for the \r\nessential role of the United Nations as we move beyond \r\ntransition. Its work will be of key importance in \r\nsupporting the preparations for the upcoming elections \r\nand for monitoring the human rights and humanitarian \r\nsituation and making coordination bodies such as the \r\nJoint Coordination and Monitoring Board work more \r\neffectively.\r\nIt is important that the international community \r\nremain strongly committed to progress in Afghanistan. \r\nThat will require sustained support beyond 2014.\r\nThe EU commitment to Afghanistan is long-term. \r\nThe EU is currently providing more than €1 billion \r\n12-60766 7\r\nA/67/PV.41\r\nin development assistance to Afghanistan annually. \r\nWe will continue to prioritize and enhance support to \r\nAfghanistan in the decade of transformation agreed at \r\nBonn. \r\nThe aim of our overall strategy in Afghanistan \r\nremains clear, namely, supporting a successful transition \r\nprocess in Afghanistan, partnering with Afghanistan \r\nbeyond transition on its path towards becoming fully \r\nself-reliant, and building a more peaceful, democratic \r\nand prosperous society for the benefit of all Afghans.\r\nMr. Kydyrov (Kyrgyzstan): It gives me great \r\npleasure to speak today as a Chair of the Shanghai \r\nCooperation Organization (SCO) on behalf of the \r\nPeople’s Republic of China, the Republic of Kazakhstan, \r\nthe Russian Federation, the Republic of Tajikistan and \r\nmy own country, the Kyrgyz Republic.\r\nThe situation in Afghanistan affects global and \r\nregional peace and stability, as the matter of counter-\r\nterrorism is one of the important issues on which the \r\ninternational community and countries of the region are \r\nfocusing their attention. Thanks to the strong support of \r\nthe international community, the situation concerning \r\npolitical reconciliation and economic reconstruction \r\nin Afghanistan is changing. The country’s economy \r\nis showing progress. Infrastructure development, \r\nincluding the construction of roads, bridges and power \r\ntransmission lines, has made headway, and health and \r\neducation have improved.\r\nYet, we must not overlook the difficulties and \r\nchallenges that Afghanistan still faces in the course \r\nof reconstruction. There is no marked improvement \r\nin the security situation. Terrorist activities continue \r\nunabated, as seen in the terrorist activity by the \r\nTaliban, Al-Qaida forces and other extremists. Illicit \r\ndrug production and trafficking are still rampant. \r\nTension and internal conflicts in Afghanistan remain \r\nprimary sources of threats to regional security and \r\nstability. We urge the Government of Afghanistan and \r\nthe International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) \r\nto combat the Afghanistan narcotics threat more \r\nvigorously, especially in view of the undeniable fact \r\nthat drug trafficking has become a major source of \r\nfunding for terrorist activities in Afghanistan.\r\nAs SCO member States are all neighbours of \r\nAfghanistan, we closely follow the developments in \r\nthat country and support the development of bilateral \r\ncooperation between Afghanistan and countries of the \r\nregion. The SCO member States support the efforts to \r\nmake Afghanistan an independent, neutral, peaceful \r\nand prosperous country that is free of terrorism and \r\ndrug-related crime. Our countries are of the view that \r\nthe national reconciliation process in Afghanistan \r\nshould be Afghan-led and Afghan-owned. That process \r\nis an important component of any Afghan settlement. \r\nWe also support the Afghan Government-led peace \r\nprocess, which aims at promoting dialogue with those \r\nelements in opposition to the Government that have \r\nrenounced violence, broken ties with Al-Qaida and \r\nother terrorist organizations, denounced terrorism and \r\naccepted the Afghan Constitution, in full respect of the \r\nimplementation of measures and procedures introduced \r\nby the Security Council in its resolutions 1267 (1999), \r\n1988 (2011) and 1989 (2011) and other relevant Council \r\nresolutions.\r\nWe have consistently supported the peaceful \r\nreconstruction of the country and have over the years \r\nprovided all feasible support and assistance to the \r\nAfghan people. The SCO member States are ready to \r\nassist with the reconstruction of Afghanistan, including \r\nthrough the implementation of infrastructure, energy \r\nand transport projects, with a view to promoting \r\nsustainable economic growth and the creation of jobs \r\nin Afghanistan. \r\nIt gives me pleasure to inform the Assembly that the \r\nSCO member States have decided to grant Afghanistan \r\nobserver status in the SCO. While emphasizing the \r\nfutility of attempting to resolve the Afghan conflict \r\nby military means, SCO member States call upon the \r\ninternational community to continue to scale up its \r\nsupport and assistance to Afghanistan, as part of the \r\ncomprehensive measures to tackle both the symptoms \r\nand root causes of the problems connected with the \r\nreconstruction of that country, which include enhancing \r\ncapacities, improving the people’s well-being and \r\nstrengthening ownership and self-development \r\ncapacities. \r\nIn the security field, the international community \r\nshould continue to foster conditions that could \r\nenable the Afghan Government to shoulder security \r\nresponsibilities. In the economic field, the international \r\ncommunity should honour its commitment to assist \r\nAfghanistan’s economic and social development. In the \r\narea of governance, the international community should \r\nhelp to enhance human resource development, while \r\nmaintaining full respect for the right of the Afghan \r\npeople to independently choose their political model of \r\ngovernance. The SCO member States will continue to \r\n8 12-60766\r\nA/67/PV.41\r\nconsistent efforts on the part of the Afghan Government \r\nand the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) \r\naimed at addressing the challenges related to drug \r\nproduction and trafficking. We stand ready to cooperate \r\nclosely with NATO on a broad range of issues, including \r\ncombating the drugs threat.\r\nCSTO member States believe that the international \r\ncommunity, under the auspices of the United Nations, \r\nshould play an active and effective role in the political \r\nsettlement process and in the recovery of Afghanistan, \r\nin close cooperation with the Afghan Government. \r\nWe support the Government’s efforts to strengthen \r\nAfghan society and transform the country into a stable \r\ndemocratic State. Member States support Afghanistan’s \r\nactive involvement in regional integration processes \r\nand in efforts to strengthen mutual trade and economic \r\nand humanitarian cooperation, as well as the swift \r\nimplementation of infrastructure projects aimed at \r\nlinking the region with Afghanistan, which will help to \r\nrestore peace, stability and socioeconomic development \r\nin Afghanistan.\r\nCSTO member States welcome the decisions adopted \r\nat the Bonn and Istanbul Conferences on Afghanistan \r\nin 2011, the fifth conference on regional economic \r\ncooperation for Afghanistan, held in Dushanbe, the \r\nKabul Conference and this year’s economic conference \r\nin Tokyo. We underscore the important role played by \r\nCSTO member States in conveying air and land transit \r\ncargo to meet the needs of ISAF forces in Afghanistan.\r\nWe support the process of national reconciliation in \r\nthe country. It is our view, however, that intra-Afghan \r\ndialogue can have a positive effect only if a leading \r\nrole in the process belongs to the Afghan Government \r\nand if there is strict compliance by the insurgents with \r\nthree basic principles, namely, they must lay down \r\ntheir weapons, recognize the Afghan Constitution and \r\ndefinitively break their ties with Al-Qaida and other \r\nextremist organizations. We believe that following the \r\ncompletion of the stabilization efforts in Afghanistan, \r\nISAF’s withdrawal should take place pursuant to a \r\ndecision of the Security Council based on a report on \r\nthe implementation of its mandate. \r\nWe note the role of other regional organizations, \r\nprimarily the Shanghai Cooperation Organization \r\n(SCO), in addressing the challenges with regard to \r\nmilitary and political stabilization and economic \r\nrecovery in Afghanistan, as well as the efforts of \r\nCARICC to combat illicit drug trafficking based \r\nstrengthen and upgrade regional cooperation within the \r\nSCO framework and other existing relevant regional \r\nformats in order to build the SCO region into one of \r\nlasting peace, friendship, prosperity and harmony.\r\nThe situation in Afghanistan is now at a crucial \r\nstage. The SCO member States support the central role of \r\nthe United Nations in coordinating international efforts \r\non Afghanistan and will assist the Afghan people with \r\ntheir national reconstruction. The SCO appreciates the \r\nactivities of the United Nations Assistance Mission in \r\nAfghanistan (UNAMA) aimed at fulfilling its mission \r\nand supports UNAMA in providing further necessary \r\nassistance for peace and for the reconstruction of \r\nthe country within its mandate. It is the sincere hope \r\nof the SCO member States that a peaceful, stable, \r\nindependent, sovereign and neutral Afghanistan that \r\nenjoys development, progress and friendship with its \r\nneighbours will emerge at an early date.\r\nMr. Rakhmetullin (Kazakhstan) (spoke in \r\nRussian): I have the honour to make this statement on \r\nbehalf of the States members of the Collective Security \r\nTreaty Organization (CSTO), that is, Armenia, Belarus, \r\nKazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, the Russian Federation and \r\nTajikistan. The CSTO member States have carefully \r\nfollowed the situation in Afghanistan, which borders \r\nthe organization’s area of responsibility. We are \r\nseriously concerned about the escalating tensions in the \r\ncountry. We support Afghanistan’s efforts to become \r\na peaceful, independent and neutral State that is free \r\nfrom terrorism and narcotic drugs.\r\nCSTO member States will help to foster \r\nAfghanistan’s sustainable and secure development with \r\na view to reducing the threats to international security \r\nfrom that country, such as terrorism, drug trafficking \r\nand religious extremism, among others. We note the \r\nimportance of CSTO capacities in countering such \r\nthreats from Afghanistan. \r\nCSTO member States consider the illicit production, \r\ntrade and trafficking of drugs from Afghanistan to be a \r\nthreat to international peace and security. We intend to \r\nstep up efforts to combat the Afghan drugs threat in line \r\nwith the decisions of the third Ministerial Conference \r\nof the Paris Pact, held in Vienna on 16 February, \r\nwhile making use of the capacities of the Central \r\nAsian Regional Information and Coordination Centre \r\n(CARICC) in combating illicit trafficking in narcotic \r\ndrugs, psychotropic substances and their precursors, as \r\nwell as while working together through the CSTO-led \r\ncounter-narcotics Operation Kanal. We look forward to \r\n12-60766 9\r\nA/67/PV.41\r\nregional trade and economic cooperation and to counter \r\nthe threats of terrorism, drugs and organized crime, as \r\nwell as to develop human resources for Afghanistan’s \r\nmilitary and civilian needs. Tajikistan is actively \r\ninvolved in the process of establishing sustainable peace \r\nand stability in Afghanistan. Given Afghanistan’s need \r\nto develop human resources for law-enforcement and \r\nmilitary bodies and to train professional specialists, my \r\ncountry has provided opportunities for training border \r\nofficers and law-enforcement and security personnel in \r\ncentres in Tajikistan, particularly the regional college \r\nof the Organization for Security and Cooperation in \r\nEurope.\r\nMore than 500 Afghan students are currently \r\nenrolled in higher-education institutions in Tajikistan. \r\nIn accordance with a decision of the Government of \r\nTajikistan, grants will be awarded to approximately \r\n1,000 Afghan citizens through 2025. Moreover, \r\nin recognition of the fundamental importance of \r\ndeveloping education and training specialists for the \r\nneeds of the economy in Afghanistan and the region, \r\nTajikistan has launched the establishment on its own \r\nterritory of a multidisciplinary professional and \r\ntechnical educational training centre.\r\nThanks to its favourable geographic location, \r\nAfghanistan can play a highly important role in \r\ndeveloping regional integration processes. In the context \r\nof globalization, the significance of Afghanistan’s \r\ngeographic position at the crossroads between the various \r\nregions of the Asian continent can only expand. In that \r\nconnection, Tajikistan fully supports the development \r\nand implementation of infrastructure projects in the \r\nareas of communications and transportation, both in \r\nAfghanistan and in the region in general. Tajikistan \r\nand Afghanistan are currently linked by five bridges \r\nspanning the  border along the Panj River. That enables \r\nthe delivery of humanitarian assistance and other cargo \r\nto remote areas of Afghanistan. It also helps to promote \r\nthe growing trade between our two countries, as well \r\nas to expand transit capacity. A projected railroad \r\nbetween Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Afghanistan, \r\nwhich would also link to an existing Uzbekistan-\r\nAfghanistan branch and to two prospective Iran-\r\nAfghanistan and Turkmenistan-Afghanistan branches, \r\nhas undergone international evaluation and is awaiting \r\nimplementation. The route is destined to become a \r\ntransit artery of regional significance that will promote \r\nthe development of regional trade and economic \r\nrecovery for Afghanistan.\r\non Afghan production. We welcome Afghanistan’s \r\nreceiving observer status in the CSO and CARICC.\r\nMr. Aslov (Tajikistan) (spoke in Russian): Allow me \r\nto express my gratitude to the President for convening \r\nthis meeting of the General Assembly. \r\nTajikistan aligns itself with the statements made by \r\nthe representatives of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan on \r\nbehalf of the Collective Security Treaty Organization \r\n(CSTO) and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization \r\n(SCO), respectively.\r\nTajikistan was pleased, once again, to join the \r\nsponsors of draft resolution A/67/L.16, entitled “The \r\nsituation in Afghanistan”. We hope that, as in previous \r\nyears, the draft resolution will be adopted by consensus. \r\nAllow me to take this opportunity to sincerely thank the \r\nGerman delegation for its work in achieving agreement \r\non the text of the draft resolution.\r\nToday, Afghanistan is at a critical juncture in its \r\nmodern history. By the end of 2014, the transition \r\nprocess should be completed. Following the withdrawal \r\nof the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), \r\nAfghan law-enforcement bodies should be able to \r\nshoulder full responsibility for security in the country. \r\nIndeed, at this important and complex stage, the \r\ninternational community should provide Afghanistan \r\nwith its full support. \r\nTajikistan is connected to Afghanistan by many \r\nhistoric and cultural links. Along those lines, our \r\ncountry is seeking to further strengthen good-\r\nneighbourly relations with Afghanistan and to \r\ndevelop and step up our bilateral, mutually beneficial \r\ncooperation. We support the international strategy for a \r\ncomprehensive settlement and the post-confl ict recovery \r\nof Afghanistan. In that context, we wholeheartedly \r\nsupport the Afghan Government’s efforts to achieve the \r\ngoals of national reconciliation. We welcome the efforts \r\nof the international community, particularly the United \r\nNations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan and the \r\nInternational Security Assistance Force, to establish \r\nlasting peace and stability in that long-suffering land.\r\nAn important factor in ensuring sustainable \r\nsocioeconomic development in Afghanistan is to \r\nget the country involved in the process of regional \r\nintegration through economic and trade cooperation \r\nwith neighbouring States. In that connection, I should \r\nlike to note the role of the Dushanbe quartet, composed \r\nof Afghanistan, Pakistan, Russia and Tajikistan, within \r\nwhose framework efforts are being made to improve \r\n10 12-60766\r\nA/67/PV.41\r\nIn the current circumstances, energy is of key \r\nimportance for rebuilding Afghanistan’s devastated \r\neconomy. The hydroelectric plants currently operating \r\nin Tajikistan, as well as those under construction, are \r\ncapable not only of meeting Afghanistan’s needs for \r\necologically clean and affordable electric power but \r\nalso of broadening its agricultural development by \r\nrestoring and improving its irrigation systems. In that \r\ncontext, I should like to note the special importance \r\nof building power-transmission-line projects through \r\nAfghanistan. Last year a 220-kilovolt transmission \r\nline began operating from Tajikistan’s Sangtuda-1 \r\nhydroelectric power station to the Afghan city of \r\nPuli Khumri. The CASA-1000 trade and transmission \r\nproject has been launched to help solve the problem \r\nof the shortage of power in Afghanistan and Pakistan \r\nby using the hydroelectric potential of Central Asian \r\ncountries. We support the projected gas pipeline to \r\nbe laid from Turkmenistan across Afghanistan to \r\nTajikistan and Pakistan, which, besides supplying the \r\nnatural-gas needs of the countries of the region, would \r\nalso create a reliable source of income for Afghanistan.\r\nThe issue of Afghanistan’s socioeconomic recovery \r\nwas covered in depth at the fifth Regional Economic \r\nCooperation Conference on Afghanistan, held in \r\nDushanbe in the spring. The Conference recommended \r\nthe implementation of about 20 projects in the areas of \r\ntransportation, communications, energy, investment, \r\neducation, building human capacity, border control and \r\nother areas, which could contribute to Afghanistan’s \r\nrestoration and socioeconomic development. \r\nEstablishing significant levels of peace and security \r\nin Afghanistan will depend on broad and effective \r\ninternational and regional cooperation and sincere, \r\nconsistent efforts on the part of the international \r\ncommunity to achieve goals that meet the aspirations \r\nand expectations of the Afghan people. We hope that \r\nthe adoption of today’s draft resolution by the General \r\nAssembly will serve that noble purpose.\r\nMr. Haniff (Malaysia): At the outset, I would \r\nlike to express my delegation’s appreciation to the \r\nSecretary-General for his latest report on the situation \r\nin Afghanistan, contained in document A/67/354.\r\nThe year 2014 will see two significant events \r\nthat will shape the next stage of Afghanistan’s future. \r\nOne is the complete withdrawal of the International \r\nStabilization Assistance Force (ISAF); the second is \r\nthe presidential elections. They are equally important \r\nand should be looked at as two sides of the same coin.\r\nOn the one side, security in Afghanistan is a \r\nprerequisite for the success of political and economic \r\nreconstruction and transformation processes across the \r\nboard. In that regard, Malaysia is encouraged that there \r\nhave been fewer security incidents and insurgent attacks \r\nthis year as compared with 2011. However, the figures \r\nare certainly not encouraging enough. The killing of \r\ncivilians and the targeting of prominent individuals \r\nremain a concern. The international community must \r\nlook at ways to counter such incidents. In doing so, it \r\nmust take special care not to give further reasons for \r\npeople to turn away from the transition process and join \r\nthe insurgents. Civilian deaths resulting from military \r\noperations by international forces must be avoided at \r\nall costs. In fact, any civilian casualties will create \r\nresentment and fuel anger among the people, making \r\nefforts to ensure peace and security that much harder.\r\nOn the f lip side, fair elections that are inclusive and \r\nfree from external interference will ensure a competent \r\nGovernment that enjoys the support of the people. The \r\nGovernment can then concentrate on efforts to establish \r\ngood governance, promote justice, human rights and \r\nrespect for the rule of law, and foster equitable social \r\nand economic development in the country. That in turn \r\nwill plant the seeds for lasting peace and stability from \r\nwithin Afghanistan itself.\r\nMalaysia appreciates the continued support that \r\nthe United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan \r\nhas given to the work of the High Peace Council and \r\nthe Afghanistan Peace and Reintegration Programme. \r\nWe welcome the appointment of Salahuddin Rabbani, \r\nwho has emphasized the need to improve inclusiveness \r\nin the High Peace Council. Malaysia is heartened to \r\nnote that the efforts of the Government of Afghanistan \r\nto engage with insurgents in order to rehabilitate \r\nand reintegrate them into society have borne fruit. \r\nWe believe that rehabilitated insurgents can help the \r\nGovernment in its efforts to restore peace through their \r\nactive participation as local community leaders.\r\nMalaysia is of the view that inclusiveness also \r\nneeds to be extended to women. By getting the support \r\nof women, the Government would, in effect, further \r\nmarginalize those who are out to create instability in \r\nthe country. Furthermore, women would contribute \r\nimmensely to development efforts. To neglect such a \r\nhuge percentage of the population would only mean \r\nunderutilizing the potential human capital available in \r\nthe country. Afghanistan certainly cannot afford to do \r\nthat.\r\n12-60766 11\r\nA/67/PV.41\r\nin humanitarian assistance and capacity-building \r\nprogrammes to Afghanistan.\r\nMalaysia is cautiously optimistic about the situation \r\nin Afghanistan. We recognize that the next few years \r\nwill be crucial for the future of the country. While \r\nwe support full Afghan leadership and ownership, the \r\ninternational community must take steps to ensure \r\nthat when ISAF leaves, the foundations have been \r\nput in place to allow Afghanistan to move forward. \r\nThe international community must also ensure that \r\nthe transition of power to the next President is done \r\nsmoothly.\r\nProgress has been made and we should capitalize \r\non it. Afghanistan cannot afford to fall back into the \r\ndespair of war. Malaysia will do its utmost to support \r\nAfghanistan’s reconciliation and reconstruction \r\nprocess. We look forward to continuing to play a \r\nmeaningful role in Afghanistan’s development towards \r\nlasting peace, stability and prosperity.\r\nMr. Al-Jarman (United Arab Emirates) (spoke in \r\nArabic): The United Arab Emirates supports the draft \r\nresolution before the General Assembly on the situation \r\nin Afghanistan (A/67/L.16). We reiterate our support \r\nfor all Afghan national efforts to expand the process \r\nof constructive and inclusive Afghan-led dialogue and \r\nreconciliation, including all segments of the populations \r\nand all political parties in the process, in order to achieve \r\nnational unity, stability and long-term development. We \r\nalso support the good offices conducted in that regard \r\nby the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, \r\nthe Mission of Norway and the Afghanistan-Pakistan \r\nJoint Commission for Reconciliation and Peace.\r\nIn that context, we emphasize the need for the \r\ninternational community to adopt an innovative \r\napproach in providing more inclusive development \r\nsupport to Afghanistan in the economic, logistical \r\nand technical fields. Such inclusive support should \r\nbe under the supervision of the United Nations and \r\ndone in cooperation with international organizations, \r\ndonor countries and other concerned parties to promote \r\nstability, strengthen national capacities and sreolve the \r\ninternal problems of Afghanistan, as well as to organize, \r\nreform and develop its national institutions. That will \r\nenable Afghanistan, through its institutions, to carry \r\nout its full responsibilities, meet the needs of its people, \r\nconsolidate security and enhance law enforcement. \r\nIn that regard, we welcome the gradual transition of \r\nsecurity tasks to the Afghan National Security Forces, \r\nMalaysia understands the need to take into account \r\nthe cultural and traditional sensitivities in Afghanistan, \r\nwhich are based on religious beliefs. It is the same for \r\nMalaysia. We continue to take various measures towards \r\nachieving gender equality and women’s development \r\nthrough various policy frameworks, legislation, \r\ncapacity-building and entrepreneurial programmes. \r\nMalaysia wishes to emphasize the importance of \r\nwomen’s education and health care and the need to \r\nchange the widely accepted stereotypical roles of \r\nmen and women in society, all the while taking into \r\nconsideration the need to protect the sanctity of Islam. \r\nIn that regard, we believe that Malaysia has much to \r\noffer, and we are willing to share our experience.\r\nMany impediments remain in the run-up to 2014. \r\nIt is obvious that the Afghan Government will need \r\nthe assistance of the international community in its \r\nefforts to forge a better future for its people. We are \r\npleased to note the success of the Tokyo Conference \r\non Afghanistan last July, which saw the international \r\ncommunity pledge $16 billion in development aid \r\nover the next four years. The number of high-level \r\nrepresentatives and the financial commitments made at \r\nthe Conference send a clear message to those who intend \r\nto derail the transition and transformation process that \r\nAfghanistan will not be abandoned and will enjoy the \r\nsupport of the international community.\r\nFor our part, Malaysia will identify the specific \r\nareas of assistance and cooperation that we are able to \r\nextend to Afghanistan and its people under the Malaysia \r\nTechnical Assistance Programme, with particular focus \r\non capacity-building and human resource development. \r\nIn addition, 40 members of the Malaysian Armed \r\nForces medical contingent for the International Security \r\nAssistance Force, which includes women doctors and \r\nnurses, were deployed in July 2010 to provide medical, \r\ndentistry and other health-care services and capacity-\r\nbuilding programmes to the Afghan people in Bamyan \r\nprovince. The team has managed to take local social \r\nand religious sensitivities into consideration while \r\nproviding health-care services.\r\nMalaysia has also been providing assistance in \r\nthe reconstruction of Afghanistan over the past 10 \r\nyears through various bilateral technical training and \r\ncapacity-building programmes in a broad range of \r\nareas. We are pleased to note that a number of Afghan \r\nofficials have benefited from the many technical \r\ncourses that Malaysia has offered. In 2011 and 2012, \r\nMalaysia has contributed a total of nearly $14 million \r\n12 12-60766\r\nA/67/PV.41\r\nThe United Arab Emirates also participated in \r\nthe implementation of several governmental and \r\nnon-governmental projects in Afghanistan. They \r\ninclude the construction of training centres, road \r\nprojects and infrastructure rebuilding, particularly \r\nin the areas of education and rural development. We \r\nparticipate as well in a demining project in Kandahar, \r\nwhich is expected to be completed within four years at \r\na cost of $28 million. The United Arab Emirates also \r\ncontributed to the international military efforts through \r\nthe International Security Assistance Force of NATO \r\nfor the purpose of reconstructing Afghanistan and \r\nproviding support and assistance to its people.\r\nWe highly appreciate the considerable efforts \r\nmade by the International Security Assistance Force \r\nin Afghanistan, under the command of NATO and the \r\nUnited Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, as \r\nwell as by other partners of the international community, \r\nto restore security and stability in Afghanistan and \r\nimprove the quality of life of its people. However, we \r\ncall for focusing international action on accelerating \r\nthe work of the implementation mechanisms of the \r\ncountry’s national comprehensive development strategy \r\nin order to develop the capacities of the key sectors in \r\nAfghanistan so as to enable them to meet the needs \r\nof the people and to consolidate peace, growth and \r\nstability in all provinces. That should include restoring \r\nAfghanistan’s traditional place both in the region and in \r\nthe international community.\r\nMr. Ragaglini (Italy): Italy aligns itself with the \r\nstatement made earlier by the observer of the European \r\nUnion and would like to make a few remarks in its \r\nnational capacity.\r\nWe welcome the draft resolution on the situation \r\nin Afghanistan (A/67/L.16) and support its adoption by \r\nconsensus. In doing so, we confirm our appreciation \r\nof the substantial contribution the United Nations is \r\nmaking to the stabilization of Afghanistan. Italy values \r\nthe continued efforts that the Secretary-General and \r\nhis Special Representative are promoting to that end \r\nand reiterates its full and convinced support for their \r\nwork. We also commend the role of the United Nations \r\nAssistance Mission in Afghanistan in leading and \r\ncoordinating the civilian efforts of the international \r\ncommunity, the importance of which will grow as the \r\nmilitary commitment gradually diminishes.\r\nOver the past year, a series of important \r\nconferences has allowed the international community \r\nand Afghanistan to better define the terms of their \r\nin accordance with the Kabul process, especially in the \r\nmatter of extending their control over all regions of the \r\ncountry, preserving national security and achieving \r\neconomic and social development by the time of the \r\nwithdrawal of most foreign troops in 2014.\r\nWe would also like to stress the importance of \r\nthe region’s role in achieving security and stability \r\nin Afghanistan. The region should seek to put in \r\nplace an inclusive package of security cooperation, \r\nconfidence-building measures and multilateral support \r\nin several areas, such as reconstruction, health and \r\neducation and in combating terrorism, extremism and \r\nthe production and trafficking of drugs. We also look \r\nforward to further initiatives of cooperation between \r\nAfghanistan and neighbouring countries in the areas \r\nof security, the economy and trade. In that context, we \r\nwelcome the ongoing, constructive bilateral cooperation \r\nbetween Afghanistan and Pakistan.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates has stood by the \r\nAfghan people from the very onset of their crisis. \r\nOver the past 10 years, we have continued to provide \r\npolitical and economic support through direct bilateral \r\ncooperation and as part of the international community. \r\nOur assistance aims to support the implementation \r\nof infrastructure projects in Afghanistan, including \r\neconomic recovery projects and reconstruction, \r\nrehabilitation and development programmes in the \r\nhealth, agricultural, social and security sectors. We \r\nalso support other multipurpose charitable projects \r\naimed at restoring security and stability in all parts of \r\nthe country, reducing the suffering of its people and \r\nimproving all aspects of their lives.\r\nThe total contributions by the Government of \r\nthe United Arab Emirates to Afghanistan since the \r\nyear 2000 to advance its national economy amount to \r\napproximately $272 million dollars. That is in addition \r\nto private assistance from United Arab Emirates \r\nhumanitarian foundations, including the Sheikh \r\nKhalifa Foundation, which, in collaboration with the \r\nBill and Melinda Gates Foundation, made an estimated \r\ncontribution of $100 million, earmarked for the mass \r\nimmunization programme for Afghan children. \r\nAlso, in July, the United Arab Emirates announced a \r\ngrant of $250 million dollars, 80 per cent of which is \r\nearmarked for building houses for Afghans, including \r\nwidows, orphans and the disabled, as well as for other \r\ndevelopment projects and the rehabilitation of a number \r\nof institutions in Kabul and other provinces. \r\n12-60766 13\r\nA/67/PV.41\r\nSecondly, the time has come for Afghanistan \r\nto turn over a new leaf in its history and overcome \r\ndecades of conflict and turbulence. The success of \r\nthe reconciliation process among the many ethnic and \r\npolitical components of Afghan society is a prerequisite \r\nfor building long-term stabilization and lasting peace. \r\nWe therefore encourage the efforts of the Afghan \r\nGovernment to advance this process. We believe that \r\nsustainable reconciliation can be achieved only through \r\nan inclusive, nationwide, collective commitment to \r\npeace, with the full participation of women and civil \r\nsociety, particularly in light of Security Council \r\nresolution 1325 (2000).\r\nThirdly, the success of the reconciliation process \r\nis key not only to the stabilization and prosperity of \r\nAfghanistan, but also to the stability of the region as \r\na whole. While fully respecting Afghan ownership \r\nof the peace process, we believe that the regional \r\nenvironment could help create the conditions for its \r\npositive advancement. In that regard, we appreciate the \r\nrecent visit of a delegation of the High Peace Council \r\nto Pakistan, as it represents an important step forward \r\nin regional dialogue and is a sign of a common will to \r\nre-energize the process. \r\nIn the same spirit, we prize the initiatives aimed \r\nat enhancing regional cooperation with Afghanistan. In \r\nparticular, we are encouraged by the progress achieved \r\nso far within the Istanbul Process on Regional Security \r\nand Cooperation for a Secure and Stable Afghanistan, \r\nunder the commendable leadership of the Afghan \r\nGovernment. We expect the action plans for the first \r\nset of confidence-building measures to be finalized \r\nsoon so that their implementation can begin, and \r\nwe reaffirm Italy’s readiness to contribute to those \r\nmeasures concerning counter-narcotics and regional \r\ninfrastructure. Meanwhile, a structured and genuine \r\npolitical dialogue among the countries of the Heart of \r\nAsia initiative remains a key component of the process, \r\nas it can strengthen mutual trust.\r\nThe upcoming elections represent a crucial test for \r\nthe f ledgling Afghan democracy. We are encouraged \r\nby the commitment shown by the Afghan Government, \r\nand we welcome the recent announcement of the date \r\nof the elections as an important step forward. It is of \r\nthe utmost importance to guarantee the credibility, \r\ninclusiveness and transparency of the whole electoral \r\nprocess, so as to lead up to a legitimate and broadly \r\naccepted outcome.\r\nrelationship, which will go well beyond the transition \r\nprocess throughout what is known as the transformation \r\ndecade. Afghanistan has made remarkable progress over \r\nthe past 10 years in such fields as institutional capacity, \r\neconomic growth, the enhancement of human rights \r\nand the development of its security forces. However, \r\nmuch remains to be done, and international support is \r\nstill needed. That is why Italy fully supports the strong, \r\ncredible, unequivocal message that has emerged from \r\nthe meetings held in Bonn, Chicago, Kabul and Tokyo, \r\nthat is, the international community will not abandon \r\nAfghanistan after 2014. \r\nAs for our national contribution, through a \r\ndecade-long presence, Italy has shown its steadfast \r\ncommitment to the stabilization and reconstruction \r\nof Afghanistan. Over the past months, we have stated \r\nour intention to stand by Afghanistan in a long-term \r\nperspective beyond 2014. The bilateral partnership \r\nagreement signed last January is the cornerstone of a \r\nrelationship that will be based less on assistance and \r\nmore on mutual commitments and cooperation on an \r\nequal footing.\r\nI would like to make three comments. \r\nFirst, while our Afghan friends must feel reassured \r\nin this perspective, it is equally important to highlight \r\nthat a new, more mature and more demanding partnership \r\nis being forged. At the Tokyo Conference all parties \r\nundertook substantial commitments: on the one hand, \r\nthe international community will continue to assure \r\nits financial and political support of Afghanistan; on \r\nthe other, the Afghan Government is expected to make \r\nfurther progress in such areas as democratic reforms, \r\ntransparency, good governance, and the protection \r\nand promotion of human rights, in particular women’s \r\nrights. \r\nAs expressed on several occasions, Italy considers \r\nthe issue of women’s conditions a top priority. We \r\nrecognize the tangible progress that the Afghan \r\nGovernment has made in that domain, enhancing the \r\nstatus of women in such important areas as education \r\nand political participation. Those hard-won gains \r\nnow need to be preserved and further consolidated. \r\nWe also believe that the full inclusion of women in \r\nAfghan society, on the basis of opportunities and rights \r\nequal to those of men, as stated in article 22 of the \r\nAfghan Constitution, will help Afghanistan achieve its \r\ndevelopment and security goals.\r\n14 12-60766\r\nA/67/PV.41\r\nNeedless to say, this entire course is inseparably \r\nrelated to the improvement of the security situation \r\nthrough the building up of the Afghan National Security \r\nForces and the advancement of the reintegration process. \r\nThey must therefore be addressed in a simultaneous \r\nand effective manner in order to achieve irreversible \r\nprogress. Given the final timeline for the security \r\ntransition, there is no more time to lose.\r\nThe peace and reconciliation process is an Afghan-\r\nled process. Japan supports the High Peace Council’s \r\nactive efforts in leading dialogues with the relevant \r\nparties and especially welcomes the developments and \r\noutcome of the recent visit of Mr. Rabbani, Chairman of \r\nHigh Peace Council, to Pakistan. It is also encouraging \r\nto see other actors, including non-governmental and \r\ncivilian institutions, being engaged in the process as \r\nwell, as we believe that such initiatives, when well \r\ncoordinated, could effectively complement the High \r\nPeace Council’s activities.\r\nLast but not least, we cannot stress enough the \r\nimportance of the upcoming presidential elections in \r\nApril 2014. The elections will be a testimony to all \r\nthe efforts and achievements of the Government of \r\nAfghanistan and its people in all spheres. A wide range \r\nof interlinked challenges persist, including concerning \r\nsecurity control, electoral law reforms, the elimination \r\nof fraud, an efficient voter registration system, \r\ninclusiveness, and others that should be addressed by \r\nthe Afghan leadership with the continued support of \r\nthe international community, headed by the United \r\nNations. We strongly hope that the election results \r\nwill lend much stronger legitimacy to the Government \r\nof Afghanistan and allow the desired advancement \r\ntowards prosperity.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate our \r\ndetermination to exert our fullest efforts for the peace \r\nand stability of Afghanistan as a Member of the United \r\nNations and the unified international community. Let \r\nus adopt this draft resolution by consensus, without \r\nhesitation.\r\nMrs. DiCarlo (United States of America): The \r\nUnited States is pleased to join other Member States \r\nin sponsoring the draft resolution on the situation in \r\nAfghanistan (A/67/L.16). The draft resolution reflects \r\nthe fact that the international community remains \r\ncommitted to supporting the Afghan people in building \r\na secure, stable and prosperous Afghanistan through \r\nthe 2014 security and political transition and beyond.\r\nLet me conclude by recalling the importance of \r\ntoday’s draft resolution. The international community \r\nis speaking with one voice and the message it \r\nis delivering is clear, that is, the stabilization of \r\nAfghanistan remains a priority and the Afghan people \r\ncan count on international support for the years to \r\ncome. The year 2014 is not the end date of international \r\ncommitment, but a turning point towards a future that \r\nis more and more in the hands of the Afghan people and \r\nGovernment.\r\nMr. Kodama (Japan): Japan is pleased to sponsor \r\nthe draft resolution (A/67/L.16) before us. The unity of \r\nthe international community in supporting Afghanistan \r\nis of particular importance for the long-term stability of \r\nthe country. Adopting the draft resolution by consensus \r\nwould send a strong message reaffirming that point. \r\nSincere appreciation is due to our colleagues from the \r\nGerman delegation, who ably led the consultations \r\nthroughout the entire process.\r\nOver the past year we have indeed witnessed a series \r\nof important international conferences with decisive \r\noutcomes based on both the Afghan Government’s \r\ndetermination to secure long-term stability and the \r\nlong-term commitments of its international partners \r\nbeyond 2014. Building on the outcomes from the Bonn \r\nConference, the NATO Chicago Summit, the Kabul \r\nMinisterial Conference and the Tokyo Conference, \r\nAfghanistan now has a road map before it leading \r\ntowards a stable future with economic growth.\r\nGiven that political and development momentum, \r\nI would like to stress the following three points, which \r\nare critical to the lasting peace and stability of the \r\ncountry.\r\nFirst, in the belief that the Tokyo Mutual \r\nAccountability Framework serves as the driving \r\nforce for allowing Afghanistan to achieve its political \r\nand development goals, Japan strongly urges the \r\nGovernment to continue making the utmost efforts \r\nto realize its commitments for a stronger and more \r\naccountable Government, as stated in the Tokyo \r\nFramework. In that connection, we welcome the Afghan \r\nGovernment’s follow-up initiatives led by the Ministry \r\nof Finance and look forward to seeing concrete actions \r\nand tangible outcomes on the ground to follow.\r\nSecondly, the road map before us will not bear \r\nfruit as planned unless it is reinforced by the sustained \r\npolitical will of the Afghan Government to proceed \r\nwith the peace and reconciliation process.\r\n12-60766 15\r\nA/67/PV.41\r\nreconciliation at the Kabul Conference that was held \r\nover the summer in support of the Istanbul Process on \r\nRegional Security and Cooperation for a Secure and \r\nStable Afghanistan.\r\nAccompanying the security transition in 2014 will \r\nbe a political transition. We welcome President Karzai’s \r\nrecent decision that elections will be held in April of \r\n2014, and we also note the strong commitments made \r\nby the Afghan Government to strengthen and improve \r\nits electoral processes. That constitutional transfer of \r\npower through a credible and inclusive presidential \r\nelection will be critical to maintaining stability and \r\npreserving support from international donors. \r\nAfghanistan today shows the tangible effects \r\nof the efforts we all have made over the past decade. \r\nKabul is now a commercial centre of over 5 million \r\npeople. Schooling and primary health care have been \r\ntransformed. According to UNICEF, 10 years ago fewer \r\nthan 1 million Afghan children attended school and \r\ntoday more than 8.2 million children will receive an \r\neducation, 3 million of whom are girls. Child mortality \r\nrates have fallen by half, and the number of health \r\nfacilities has tripled.\r\nThe United Nations role in that process remains \r\nindispensable. In supporting regional diplomacy and \r\nthrough its development and humanitarian assistance \r\nrole in Afghanistan, the United Nations continues to \r\nmake a difference in the lives of the Afghan people. \r\nCountries of the region, together with the broader \r\ninternational community, have come together with the \r\nAfghan people in support of Afghanistan’s future. In \r\nBonn, Chicago, Kabul and Tokyo we made the necessary \r\ncommitment to realize that future. We applaud those \r\nefforts and support the Afghan people in that process.\r\nSir Mark Lyall Grant (United Kingdom): I wish \r\nto thank the German delegation for the excellent work \r\nit has done in steering the negotiations on today’s draft \r\nresolution (A/67/L.16). I also thank the Government \r\nof Afghanistan for its constructive engagement in the \r\nprocess throughout.\r\nToday, I will focus on what the United Kingdom \r\nconsiders to be the key issues ahead in Afghanistan: first, \r\nthe security transition from NATO to Afghan forces; \r\nsecondly, the Afghan-led peace and reconciliation \r\nprocess; thirdly, the 2014 Afghan elections; and, \r\nfourthly, the long-term international commitment to \r\nAfghanistan.\r\nWe recognize the continued service of the United \r\nNations in Afghanistan. We also commend the brave \r\nand dedicated work of the Afghan National Security \r\nForces, the International Security Assistance Force and \r\nUnited Nations personnel who are helping to build a \r\nmore secure Afghanistan.\r\nSince we met last year, the Afghan people and \r\nthe international community have continued on the \r\npath towards a responsible security transition and an \r\nenduring commitment to Afghanistan. The meetings \r\nin Bonn, Chicago, Kabul and Tokyo clarified the path \r\nahead. The transition is on track and the international \r\ncommunity’s long-term commitment to Afghanistan is \r\nresolute.\r\nAfghanistan and international partners have charted \r\na responsible road for the transfer of full responsibility \r\nfor security back to the Afghans. The Afghan National \r\nSecurity Forces continue to grow in size and capability \r\nand should reach their goal of being 352,000-strong \r\nthis year. The Afghan army is fighting in over 90 per \r\ncent of all operations and is leading nearly half of them. \r\nThrough the third tranche of the security transition, \r\n75 per cent of the Afghan population, including every \r\nprovincial capital, will be part of the transition process. \r\nThe NATO Summit in May confirmed that the progress \r\nwill be supported by the international community \r\nbeyond 2014. NATO and its potential operational \r\npartners will continue to provide training, assistance \r\nand advisory capacity as Afghanistan moves into the \r\ntransformation decade.\r\nAfghanistan’s future will be realized not only \r\nby a strong, capable security force but also by the \r\nAfghan people’s access to economic opportunity and \r\na Government that meets their needs. The international \r\ncommunity’s total pledges in Tokyo of $16 billion in \r\neconomic assistance through 2015 meet the World \r\nBank’s estimate of Afghanistan’s requirements, just as \r\nthe Chicago Summit met its security requirements. That \r\nassistance will help Afghanistan attract private-sector \r\ninvestment and help usher in a transformation decade \r\nmarked less by aid and more by trade — all in a \r\nframework of mutual accountability, regional economic \r\nintegration and shared responsibility.\r\nThe security and economic progress will further \r\nbe bolstered by a region that sees value in peace. \r\nAfghanistan’s neighbours and near neighbours have \r\nspoken in one voice to assure Afghanistan of their \r\nsupport for an Afghan-led reconciliation process. They \r\nendorsed the principles that need to guide peace and \r\n16 12-60766\r\nA/67/PV.41\r\nFirst, with regard to transition, 2014 is drawing \r\nnear. NATO continues the important work of handing \r\nover security to the Afghan National Security Forces. \r\nThe United Kingdom remains confident in the ability of \r\nall parties to get that done within the agreed timescale. \r\nWe are confident because transition is working well \r\nand is on track. The Afghan National Security Forces \r\nare growing in strength and capability. They are taking \r\nresponsibility for their own security and doing so with \r\nenthusiasm and professionalism. But we have always \r\nrecognized that there is no purely military solution to \r\nthe situation in Afghanistan, which is why peace and \r\nreconciliation remain key.\r\nThe objective remains the same: we support the \r\nAfghan Government in its attempts to secure a peaceful \r\npolitical settlement and agree that that should be done \r\nin unity with key partners in the region. The Security \r\nCouncil’s renewal of the sanctions regime established \r\nunder resolution 1988 (2011) next month will be an \r\nopportunity to contribute further to this process. We \r\nmust ensure that designated individuals can travel \r\nto participate in reconciliation talks and that the \r\ndesignation criteria focus specifically on those who \r\npose a threat to Afghanistan’s security.\r\nSecondly, it is imperative that we continue to \r\nbuild on the momentum and achievements to date. \r\nThe United Kingdom therefore welcomes the visit of \r\nthe Afghan High Peace Council to Pakistan earlier \r\nthis month. We understand that the talks they held \r\nwere very productive, and we are encouraged by the \r\nclear commitment of both parties to the peace and \r\nreconciliation process. We welcome in particular \r\nthe call to the Taliban and other armed opposition \r\ngroups to participate in the peace process and to sever \r\nlinks with Al-Qaida and other international terrorist \r\nnetworks. The United Kingdom will continue to do all \r\nit can to support efforts by Pakistan and Afghanistan \r\nto strengthen their cooperation on this important issue.\r\nThirdly, the elections planned for 5 April 2014 will \r\nbring many challenges, but we cannot underestimate \r\ntheir importance. The United Kingdom looks forward to \r\ncredible and inclusive elections that deliver a peaceful \r\ntransition of power to a Government decided by the \r\npeople of Afghanistan. They will demand nothing \r\nless, and the international community should strongly \r\nsupport that objective. To achieve those aspirations, \r\ntransparency is key. We encourage the Government of \r\nAfghanistan to tackle the issues that have overshadowed \r\nprevious elections and ensure that the prospects for \r\nvoter fraud and violent incidents are reduced.\r\nFinally, let me reiterate the long-term commitment \r\nof the United Kingdom to Afghanistan. The United \r\nKingdom will continue to build on our excellent \r\nsecurity partnership, to further social and economic \r\nties and to form closer cultural links with Afghanistan. \r\nThe Enduring Strategic Partnership document, agreed \r\nby the United Kingdom and Afghanistan earlier this \r\nyear, provides the basis for those ambitions.\r\nThe international community as a whole has \r\nmade clear its enduring commitment to Afghanistan. \r\nWe are pleased that the draft resolution before the \r\nGeneral Assembly today (A/67/L.16) is another signal \r\nof that. The NATO Chicago Summit, followed by the \r\nTokyo Conference, provided clear evidence of that \r\ncommitment. The pledges made on both occasions \r\ndemonstrated the seriousness with which we are \r\napproaching post-2014 Afghanistan. The United \r\nKingdom will continue to meet the obligations into \r\nwhich we have entered, and we are committed to \r\nensuring that all parties do likewise. In particular, \r\nwe strongly support the Tokyo Mutual Accountability \r\nFramework as an invaluable mechanism to manage \r\nthe commitments of the international community and \r\nAfghanistan to each other.\r\nFinally, the United Nations has a crucial and \r\nenduring role to play in Afghanistan. We will continue \r\nto ensure that it has the right people, the right objectives \r\nand appropriate resources to carry out its important \r\nwork.\r\nMr. Tarar (Pakistan): I would like to thank the \r\nPresident for having convened this important debate, \r\nwhich provides the General Assembly an annual \r\nopportunity to review the progress made towards peace, \r\nstability and development in Afghanistan.\r\nAfghanistan needs the continued and active \r\nengagement of the United Nations and its Member \r\nStates. We hope that today’s meeting and this year’s \r\ndraft resolution (A/67/L.16), which Pakistan is pleased \r\nto be a sponsor of, will strengthen our collective \r\ncommitment to Afghanistan.\r\nAfter the decade-long endeavours of the international \r\ncommunity for State-building in Afghanistan, the \r\ncountry is poised to assume full responsibility for \r\nits security and governance. The transition process \r\ninitiated after the 2010 Kabul Conference generated \r\nthe optimism of having a destination in sight. Since \r\n12-60766 17\r\nA/67/PV.41\r\nthen, Afghanistan’s progress in assuming greater \r\nresponsibilities is discernible. Further progress on \r\ntransition will require sustained engagement by the \r\ninternational community. This year’s Chicago Summit \r\nand Tokyo Conference outlined the framework for \r\nsuch engagement. It is important for all pledges to be \r\nhonoured and translated into action. There should be \r\nno repeat of a situation whereby Afghanistan is left to \r\nfend for itself.\r\nThis year, the mandate of the United Nations \r\nAssistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) was \r\nreviewed with a view to aligning it with the transition \r\nprocess. We hope that will allow UNAMA to play a \r\nmore productive role.\r\nThe Afghan Government’s greater control of \r\nterritory is encouraging. It can enhance public \r\nperception of greater security and confidence in \r\ninstitutional structures, which is critical for long-term \r\nstability.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s latest report (A/67/354) \r\nincludes an assessment of post-2014 Afghanistan. We \r\nagree that security and humanitarian risks associated \r\nwith the withdrawal of the International Security \r\nAssistance Force must be addressed in a forthright \r\nmanner. Four decades of war have made it clear that \r\nthe vexing question of Afghan security does not lend \r\nitself to military solutions. Only a comprehensive \r\napproach can change the underlying dynamics of a \r\ndeep-seated cycle of conflict. The Afghan-led peace \r\nand reconciliation process is a manifestation of that \r\nrealization. It rightly seeks to address the root causes \r\nof insecurity and tackles the fundamental nature of \r\nconflict in Afghanistan.\r\nWe believe that the sustainability of the peace \r\nprocess will be ensured if all stakeholders share the \r\ngoal of reconciliation. Afghanistan’s international \r\npartners should facilitate such a convergence.\r\nExternally imposed, impracticable caveats \r\ncomplicate the peace process. Similarly, the idea of \r\ncoerced reconciliation runs counter to a fundamental \r\nlesson of Afghan history.\r\nPakistan supports an Afghan-led peace process. \r\nWe fully support the efforts of the Afghan High Peace \r\nCouncil under the able leadership of Mr. Salahuddin \r\nRabbani.\r\nPakistan has always emphasized the importance of \r\nregional unity to deal with challenges of security and \r\ndevelopment in Afghanistan. Immediate neighbours \r\nhave a special role in the stability of Afghanistan. \r\nPakistan is engaged in a number of important regional \r\ninitiatives on Afghanistan that aim to foster greater \r\nregional connectivity in order to promote economic and \r\ncommercial cooperation as well as root out narcotics, \r\nterrorism and extremism.\r\nPakistan organized this month’s regional ministerial \r\nconference on counter-narcotics, in which 13 countries \r\nparticipated. The conference declaration seeks to \r\nestablish a regional contact group on counter-narcotics \r\nas part of a comprehensive regional approach. It charts \r\na concrete road map based on agreed timelines.\r\nPakistan’s bilateral relations with Afghanistan are \r\ndriven by a sense of shared destiny. Our cooperation \r\nspans the entire spectrum of political, economic, \r\neducation and cultural relations. There are regular \r\nexchanges of visits and continuous dialogue, including \r\nat the highest levels.\r\nPakistan is engaged in several reconstruction \r\nand development projects in Afghanistan, including \r\nthe construction of hospitals, roads and educational \r\ninstitutions. In 2010 Pakistan doubled the number of \r\nscholarships offered to Afghan students for higher \r\neducation. Our official bilateral trade with Afghanistan \r\nstands at approximately $2 billion annually. The target \r\nto enhance it to $5 billion by 2015 is well within reach.\r\nIn the area of security, Pakistan has sought closer \r\nengagement with Afghanistan and its international \r\npartners on real issues that lie beyond polemics. We need \r\nfurther consolidation of our security and intelligence \r\ncooperation through the Tripartite Commission, which \r\nalso includes the United States and the International \r\nSecurity Assistance Force.\r\nThe interdiction of illegal cross-border movements \r\nis vital to countering the menaces of terrorism, drug \r\ntrafficking and commercial smuggling. It is a joint \r\nresponsibility that needs to be discharged more \r\nvigorously. Recently, Pakistan further enhanced its \r\nsecurity presence on its side of the international border \r\nwith Afghanistan, through new check-posts and regular \r\npatrolling. Our deployments along the international \r\nborder far exceed the number of international and \r\nAfghan forces present on the other side. The presence \r\nof security forces on the Afghan side of the border \r\nneeds to be enhanced. Effective measures should be \r\nin place to prevent cross-border attacks on our border \r\nposts, security patrols and border villages. The leaders \r\n18 12-60766\r\nA/67/PV.41\r\nSpain is currently the ninth-largest contributor \r\nto NATO’s International Security Assistance Force, \r\nmandated by the Security Council. Right now, there are \r\n1,500 Spanish military personnel, spread out among \r\nHerat province, where Spain operates the airport, \r\nBadghis province, which is one of the most inaccessible \r\nand disadvantaged provinces in the country and where \r\nthe headquarters for Spain’s provincial reconstruction \r\nteam is situated in Qala-i-Naw, and Kabul.\r\nSpain firmly supports the Afghan Government’s \r\nmilitary and civilian initiatives in the complex \r\ntransitional process. We are now entering the final \r\nphase of that process. In order for the transition to \r\nbe irreversible and sustainable, the international \r\ncommunity must redouble its efforts in the coming \r\nmonths, especially in the fields of governance, \r\ninstitution-building and economic development. \r\nIn Badghis the transfer of security responsibilities \r\nto the Afghan authorities is either complete or nearly so \r\nin five of the province’s six districts, leaving only the \r\nMurghab district, where most of the insurgent activity \r\nis concentrated. We are pleased with the progress of \r\nthe transition. Spain remains firmly committed to \r\nadvising, training and supporting the Afghan security \r\nforces during the transition and beyond.\r\nAs for civilian aspects of the transition, in \r\nour areas of operation we are poised to transfer to \r\nAfghans the projects we have developed in the areas \r\nof sanitation, professional training, agriculture, female \r\nempowerment and water treatment, among others. \r\nThat transfer in the social sphere will be carried out \r\nin tandem with the transfer in the security sphere. The \r\noverwhelming majority of those projects are already \r\nin the hands of Afghan personnel, and their transfer \r\nwill be formalized in agreements to be signed with the \r\nrespective Afghan ministries that will take them over. \r\nThe end of the first quarter of 2013 will mark the end of \r\nthe Spanish presence in Afghanistan, after seven years \r\nof fruitful collaboration. I underline, though, that Spain \r\nwill continue to collaborate on projects in a multilateral \r\nway, through contributions to various international \r\nagencies.\r\nDespite the difficulties of reconciliation, the recent \r\nvisit by the High Peace Council to Pakistan gives reason \r\nto hope that dialogue will soon begin to move towards \r\na sustainable, inclusive reconciliation process that \r\nbringings together not only armed groups but all sectors \r\nof Afghan society. Such a process would, and must, be \r\nof the two countries have resolved to address such \r\nmatters using appropriate forums and channels. We \r\nhope that recent bilateral commitments in that regard \r\nwill be upheld.\r\nThe humanitarian situation in Afghanistan is often \r\neclipsed by the glare of security and political challenges. \r\nThat is unfortunate, as the country continues to suffer \r\nfrom natural calamities, food insecurity and the impact \r\nof conflict. We hope that shortfalls in the humanitarian \r\naid provided by the United Nations consolidated appeal \r\nfor Afghanistan will be rectified as much as possible, so \r\nas to limit the negative impact on the most vulnerable \r\nsegments of the population.\r\nIn hosting more than 3 million Afghan refugees, \r\nPakistan is easing the humanitarian burden on \r\nAfghanistan at considerable economic and social \r\ncost to itself. During the past 10 years, Pakistan’s \r\naverage annual budget for Afghan refugees has nearly \r\ndoubled. After 10 years of internationally assisted \r\nState-building efforts in Afghanistan, more refugees \r\nshould be repatriated to the country. Creating pull-\r\nfactors in Afghanistan is part of the Solutions Strategy \r\nfor Afghan Refugees agreed to in Geneva this year. We \r\nlook forward to its smooth implementation.\r\nI will conclude by emphasizing Pakistan’s abiding \r\ncommitment to a peaceful and stable Afghanistan. \r\nNo country has suffered more than Pakistan from the \r\nconflict and instability in Afghanistan. No country \r\nstands to gain more than Pakistan from normalcy in \r\nAfghanistan. We are confident that, through unity \r\nand genuine reconciliation, the valiant people of \r\nAfghanistan will surmount all pressing challenges to \r\nusher in a brighter and prosperous future. Pakistan will \r\nremain their committed and steadfast partner.\r\nMr. Arias (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): My delegation \r\naligns itself with the statement made by the Head of the \r\nDelegation of the European Union, and I would like to \r\nadd a number of comments in my national capacity.\r\nThis year we are celebrating the eleventh \r\nanniversary of the international community’s \r\ncommitment to Afghanistan. Spain has shared in that \r\ncommitment since its inception, contributing a sizable \r\nmilitary and civilian force in an unequivocal desire to \r\nhelp stabilize and reconstruct the country. The human \r\ncost to Spain’s military contingent up to now has been \r\nhigh — 98 killed, 13 in action.\r\n12-60766 19\r\nA/67/PV.41\r\nMr. Wang Min (China) (spoke in Chinese): China \r\nendorses the statement made earlier this morning \r\nby the representative of Tajikistan on behalf of the \r\nShanghai Cooperation Organization. China welcomes \r\nthe report of the Secretary-General on the situation \r\nin Afghanistan (A/67/354). China also hopes that the \r\nrelevant draft resolution (A/67/L.16) will once again be \r\nadopted by consensus.\r\nIn recent years, with the help of the international \r\ncommunity and thanks to the tireless efforts of \r\nthe Afghan people, the peaceful reconstruction of \r\nAfghanistan has seen progress. The achievements in \r\nthe political, economic, social and development areas \r\nof the country are recognized by all. With the effective \r\nstrengthening of the Afghan National Security Forces, \r\na good basis has been established for the full handover \r\nof security responsibilities.\r\nChina firmly supports the efforts of Afghanistan \r\nto maintain its national sovereignty, independence and \r\nterritorial integrity and to achieve lasting peace and \r\nstability. We welcome the achievements of the people \r\nand Government of Afghanistan in all areas. The \r\nAfghan peace process is now at a crucial juncture. The \r\nestablishment of a peaceful, stable, independent and \r\ndeveloped Afghanistan in the future requires the joint \r\nefforts of that country and the international community.\r\nChina supports the leading role of the United \r\nNations in coordinating international efforts to resolve \r\nthe situation in Afghanistan. We hope that the United \r\nNations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan will \r\ncontinue to strengthen its cooperation and coordination \r\nwith the Government of Afghanistan. In that connection, \r\nI would like to underscore the following four points. \r\nFirst, efforts to achieve peace, stability and \r\ndevelopment in Afghanistan must be fully owned and \r\nled by the Afghan people. We support steps by the \r\nAfghan Government to strengthen its capacity-building. \r\nWhile observing full respect for Afghanistan’s national \r\nsovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, \r\nthe international community must support the efforts \r\nof that country to increase its capacity-building and \r\nimprove its governance in order to meet the objective \r\nof an Afghanistan governed by Afghans as soon as \r\npossible.\r\nSecondly, the reconstruction of Afghanistan \r\nmust continue and progress in its political process, \r\nand economic development, security, stability and \r\nnational reconciliation must be ensured. It is crucial \r\nin the spirit of the Afghan Constitution, especially in \r\nmatters of human rights, particularly those of women \r\nand children.\r\nThe year 2012 has been one of significant \r\ninternational milestones with regard to Afghanistan. \r\nThe Chicago NATO Summit in May saw agreement \r\non the strategic plan for Afghanistan, which sketched \r\na new allied mission after 2014  focused exclusively on \r\ntraining. The Summit also generated the general outline \r\nof how the international community could support \r\nthe sustainability of the Afghan National Security \r\nForces post-2014. The Kabul ministerial conference in \r\nJune pledged that the Istanbul Process — the goal of \r\nwhich is to promote regional cooperation and security \r\nand to achieve peace and stability in Afghanistan in \r\na regional environment conducive to security and \r\nprosperity — would be steadfastly urged forward. \r\nFinally, at the Tokyo Conference on Afghanistan in \r\nJuly, the groundwork was laid for supporting financial \r\nsecurity, which is clearly necessary in order to sustain \r\nthe current democratic regime. For its part, the \r\nGovernment of Afghanistan renewed its commitments \r\nin the areas of governance, development, the rule of \r\nlaw, human rights and the fight against corruption.\r\nThe presidential elections scheduled for April 2014 \r\nwill be a rigorous test of logistical organization, as we \r\nall know. The international community should provide \r\nall possible support to Afghanistan, which, in turn, \r\nmust ensure the holding of inclusive, transparent and \r\ndemocratic elections with whose outcome the Afghan \r\npeople can fully identify. The work and assistance of \r\nthe United Nations will be of paramount importance in \r\nthose elections.\r\nIn conclusion, allow me to underscore the great \r\nimportance that Spain attaches to the role that the \r\nEuropean Union can play in providing assistance to the \r\nAfghan authorities in capacity-building in areas such \r\nas governance, transparency, the rule of law and the \r\ntraining of Government, police and judicial officials and \r\nthose related to the country’s general socioeconomic \r\ndevelopment.\r\nFor all those reasons, Spain fully supports the \r\nongoing negotiation of an ambitious partnership and \r\ndevelopment cooperation agreement between the \r\nEuropean Union and the Afghan Government. That \r\nagreement will undoubtedly guide relations between \r\nthe two parties in the coming years.\r\n20 12-60766\r\nA/67/PV.41\r\nsecurity in its immediate geographic surroundings, \r\nas well as regionally and internationally. From \r\nthat perspective, Egypt supports the efforts of the \r\nGovernment of Afghanistan to exercise full control \r\nover its entire territory by 2014 — the deadline for the \r\ndeparture from Afghanistan of the international forces. \r\nEgypt is certain that the active and ongoing bilateral \r\ncooperation between the two countries to enhance the \r\ncivilian capacities of the Government of Afghanistan \r\nwill help accomplish that goal.\r\nEgypt underscores the importance of national \r\nAfghan ownership of all programmes established to \r\nenhance its capacities, with particular emphasis on \r\nthose that affect the daily lives of Afghan citizens, given \r\nthat such programmes will enable the Government \r\nof Afghanistan to undertake all tasks entrusted to it \r\nby the end of 2014. Increasing national ownership by \r\nthe Government of Afghanistan of those programmes \r\nwill enable the Afghan people to reap the dividends of \r\npeace, security and stability after decades of conflict \r\nand suffering. Taking a long-term approach will help \r\nachieve sustainable development in Afghanistan, which \r\nis the best means for achieving social stability in the \r\ncountry.\r\nEgypt supports the efforts of the international \r\ncommunity to help the Government of Afghanistan, \r\nespecially the international conferences held during \r\nthe past year aimed at intensifying cooperation and \r\ncommunication among Afghanistan and its neighbours \r\nand to raise the necessary international support and \r\nfunding for building the capabilities of the Afghan \r\nNational Security Forces so that they can extend their \r\ncontrol over the whole of the country’s territory. Egypt \r\nreiterates that it is crucial that Afghanistan’s national \r\nreconciliation process be inclusive of all tribes and \r\nfactions. As such, the Afghan experience in reconciling \r\ndisparate social elements could be held up as a role \r\nmodel of the ability of different factions and tribes \r\nto live together, putting the national interests of their \r\ncountry above other considerations.\r\nIn conclusion, the problems that face Afghanistan \r\nare deeply rooted. The experience of past years proves \r\nthat finding solutions to those problems will require a \r\ncollective international effort enlisting the participation \r\nof all countries. We look forward to a prosperous future \r\nfor Afghanistan, based on democracy, pluralism and \r\nsafeguarded human rights for the Afghan citizens, \r\nwho have struggled to achieve stability, security and \r\nimproved living conditions.\r\nthat the upcoming general election go ahead smoothly. \r\nChina welcomes the preparations in that regard by \r\nthe Government of Afghanistan. We support the \r\nleading role of the Afghan Government in the peace \r\nand reconciliation process. The transfer of security \r\nresponsibilities to the Afghan security forces must take \r\nplace in a gradual and orderly manner and with the goal \r\nof ensuring peace and stability in Afghanistan.\r\nThirdly, the reconstruction of Afghanistan requires \r\nthe international community’s ongoing support and \r\nassistance. The international community must meet its \r\ncommitments to assist the socioeconomic development \r\nof that country by turning the $16 billion pledged into \r\nconcrete actions. That assistance must fully respect the \r\npriority areas identified by the Afghan Government \r\nand must support full implementation of the national \r\ndevelopment strategy.\r\nFourthly, the Chinese Government fully supports \r\nthe establishment of friendly relations with countries in \r\nthe region on the basis of the principles of mutual respect, \r\nequality and mutual benefit. At the June summit of the \r\nShanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) in Beijing, \r\nthe Afghan issue was discussed and Afghanistan was \r\ngranted SCO observer status.\r\nChina is carefully following the developing situation \r\nin Afghanistan. We have always actively participated \r\nin the development process of the country. We support \r\nAfghanistan’s efforts to achieve its development, to \r\nimprove the well-being of its people and to ensure its \r\npeaceful reconstruction in line with the Kabul process. \r\nChina will continue to support the Government of \r\nAfghanistan as far as possible. \r\nChina and Afghanistan are friendly neighbours. \r\nThe Chinese people have strong friendly sentiments \r\ntowards the people of Afghanistan. China sincerely \r\nhopes that Afghanistan will soon achieve peace, \r\nstability, independence and development. China is \r\nready to work with the international community and \r\nto make its own contribution in order to achieve those \r\ngoals.\r\nMr. Abdrabbo (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): I \r\nwould like to extend our thanks to Mr. Ján Kubiš, \r\nSpecial Representative of the Secretary-General for \r\nAfghanistan, for his efforts, as well as those of his \r\nteam, in the past years to achieve greater stability in \r\nAfghanistan. \r\nEgypt stresses that stability in Afghanistan has a \r\ndirect and positive impact on international peace and \r\n12-60766 21\r\nA/67/PV.41\r\nnation deserves our help as it seeks to take full charge \r\nof its destiny.\r\nAnother challenge for Afghanistan is the increase \r\nin the cultivation of narcotic drugs. According to the \r\nAfghanistan Opium Survey 2012, released in early \r\nNovember by the United Nations Office on Drugs \r\nand Crime (UNODC), total opium poppy cultivation \r\nhas increased by 18 per cent and now covers 154,000 \r\nhectares, up from 131,000 hectares in 2011. UNODC \r\nwarns that the rise in cultivation has occurred despite \r\nthe Afghan Government’s latest increase in efforts \r\nto destroy poppy fields and to help farmers find \r\nalternative sources of income. At the same time, the \r\nreport indicates that prices for opium have remained \r\nrelatively high throughout 2012, at $196 per kilogram. \r\nThat provides a strong incentive for farmers to expand \r\ntheir poppy cultivation. \r\nThe Survey sends a strong message that the \r\ninternational community cannot afford to remain \r\ncomplacent in the face of the problem. A strong \r\ncommitment is needed from both Afghan and \r\ninternational partners to curb the menace of drug \r\ncultivation and drug trafficking, which breed extremism. \r\nIn that regard, we commend initiatives to fight drugs \r\nand the help in that fight offered by the United Nations \r\nOffice on Drugs and Crime. We welcomed the triangular \r\ninitiative among Afghanistan, the Islamic Republic of \r\nIran and Pakistan within the framework of the region’s \r\ncounter-narcotics efforts. We also welcomed the \r\nregional ministerial conference on counter-narcotics \r\nheld in Islamabad on 12 and 13 November, which aimed \r\nat enhancing regional cooperation to counter narcotics. \r\nTaking those efforts into account, what remains is to \r\nimplement measures to alleviate the serious concerns \r\nof neighbouring countries, transit countries of the drug \r\ntraffic and countries of destination.\r\nThe issue of refugees is also a challenge, not only \r\nfor Afghanistan but also for neighbouring States and \r\nthe international community. Additional efforts must \r\nbe undertaken in order to repatriate refugees and ensure \r\nthat they are reintegrated into Afghan society. In that \r\nregard, we welcomed the International Conference on \r\nthe Solutions Strategy for Afghan Refugees held in \r\nGeneva in May and the joint communiqué it issued, \r\naimed at the increased sustainability of returns and \r\ncontinued support for host countries. \r\nAt present, more than 1 million Afghan refugees \r\nare registered in Iran, while an even greater number \r\nMr. Al Habib (Islamic Republic of Iran): I would \r\nlike to start by expressing our appreciation for the \r\nconvening of this discussion on a subject of great \r\nsignificance to us, our region and the world. Let me also \r\nconvey a warm welcome to Special Representative of \r\nthe Secretary-General Ján Kubiš. We thank him for his \r\nwork as Head of the United Nations Assistance Mission \r\nin Afghanistan (UNAMA). We also thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his comprehensive report detailing the work \r\nof UNAMA and offering his analysis of the situation in \r\nAfghanistan (A/67/354). I also express my thanks to the \r\nGerman delegation for coordinating and facilitating the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations that have led us to the \r\nannual draft resolution on the situation in Afghanistan \r\n(A/66/L.16).\r\nThere were significant political developments \r\nin Afghanistan during the past year. One important \r\npolitical development is the gradual drawdown of \r\nforeign forces. As foreign forces prepare to withdraw \r\nfrom Afghanistan by the end of 2014, our efforts should \r\nfocus on providing assistance and helping Afghanistan \r\nin its Afghan-led transition to a stable country. We \r\nneed concerted international and regional support \r\naimed at laying the foundations for sustainable peace \r\nand stability in Afghanistan. Progress on security \r\nand development is the key for peace, progress and \r\nstability in Afghanistan. Economic cooperation should \r\nbe speeded up, along with political, security and other \r\nconfidence-building measures, in order to ensure peace \r\nand stability for Afghanistan, and thereby for the entire \r\nregion.\r\nThe withdrawal of foreign military forces from \r\nAfghanistan should be genuine. Obviously, the \r\nexperience of the recent decades of foreign military \r\npresence in Afghanistan has taught the lesson that the \r\nconflict in Afghanistan cannot be resolved by military \r\nmeans. The continued presence of military forces, \r\nunder any excuse or pretext, would only add to the \r\ninstability and violence. The violence in Afghanistan \r\nhas had a drastic effect on the security and well-\r\nbeing of its citizens. The violence is not caused just \r\nby armed extremists, inasmuch as a growing number \r\nof civilian casualties in Afghanistan have been \r\ncaused by NATO operations. All sides should strictly \r\nabide by international humanitarian law and relevant \r\ninternational law, so as to effectively protect civilians. \r\nAfghanistan is passing through an important phase \r\nin its history. The Afghan people are inspired by the \r\nprospect of a future free from violence and war. The \r\n22 12-60766\r\nA/67/PV.41\r\nand reconstruction and to realize, at an early date, the \r\nobjective of an Afghanistan governed by Afghans.\r\nMr. Ružička (Slovakia): Slovakia is pleased \r\nto be one of the sponsors of the draft resolution on \r\nthe situation in Afghanistan (A/67/L.16). We thank \r\nGermany for steering the negotiations and facilitating \r\na consensus on the draft resolution, which we hope we \r\nwill adopt shortly. In our view, it represents a renewed \r\nmessage of encouragement for the Afghan authorities \r\nand people, as well as a commitment on the part of the \r\ninternational community. The text covers every aspect \r\nof the country’s achievements, while acknowledging \r\nthe challenges that still remain.\r\nSlovakia aligns itself with the statement made \r\nearlier on behalf of the European Union. I would also \r\nlike to highlight some aspects of the issue that are \r\nparticularly important to my country.\r\nAfghanistan remains a top operational priority \r\nfor the Slovak Republic. Our troops will continue to \r\nbe deployed there for as long as the situation requires. \r\nIn order to help build up Afghan security forces, the \r\nNational Council of the Slovak Republic has enacted \r\na new mandate extending our contribution to the \r\nInternational Security Assistance Force until 2014. We \r\nare also changing the makeup of our forces to better \r\nreact to and reflect the evolving situation. We are \r\nreducing our engineering and guard capabilities and \r\ndeploying a greater number of instructors, mentors \r\nand special forces. The main focus of the changes is on \r\nthe building and deployment by May 2014 of a special \r\noperations task group, which will advise the Afghan \r\narmy and police.\r\nWe also need to continue to build functional and \r\ncredible Afghan National Security Forces. Now that \r\nthe National Security Forces have almost reached the \r\nanticipated numbers, it is crucial to focus on their \r\nquality. As we see it, the main challenge is insider \r\nattacks, which have multiple negative effects on the \r\noverall situation. The Slovak Republic is ready to \r\nconsider the possibility of sending civilian experts \r\nto the region if required. Our national legislation on \r\nthe subject, which would allow civilian experts to be \r\nsent to participate in international crisis management \r\nactivities outside the territory of the Slovak Republic, \r\ncame into force this year.\r\nApart from our engagement in the area of peace \r\nand security, we are expanding all the components of \r\nour comprehensive assistance to Afghanistan, which \r\nof unregistered Afghans are also living in our country. \r\nAfghan nationals have continued to enjoy Iran’s \r\neducational and welfare facilities, among others, \r\nand to benefit from the same subsidies that our own \r\npeople receive. We once again urge the international \r\ncommunity to continue to strengthen and expedite its \r\nefforts to create conditions conducive to the sustainable \r\nrepatriation of refugees and their full rehabilitation and \r\nreintegration in their homeland. \r\nThe Istanbul Conference and the recent series \r\nof high-level meetings have strengthened the long-\r\nterm partnership between Afghanistan and its \r\nneighbours, as well as with its international partners. \r\nThe process was further crystallized at the Heart of \r\nAsia Ministerial Conference in Kabul in June, which \r\nset confidence-building measures as a priority. The \r\nmeetings provided an opportunity to exchange views \r\non how to move forward with regard to establishing \r\na stable and prosperous Afghanistan. We hope that \r\nthe confidence-building mechanism devised at the \r\nConference and its follow-up meetings will promote \r\nresults-oriented cooperation among all the countries \r\nof the region, aimed at developing Afghanistan’s \r\ninfrastructure in line with the wishes of its people, \r\nand paving the way for their long-cherished goal of \r\nachieving self-reliance and greater economic prosperity \r\nfor Afghanistan. The United Nations has a key role in \r\ncoordinating international and regional efforts in that \r\nregard and enjoys our full support.\r\nWe believe that capacity-building for Afghan \r\ninstitutions must remain at the heart of international \r\nefforts aimed at enabling the Government of Afghanistan \r\nto exercise its sovereign authority in all its functions. \r\nWe are confident that more coherent and coordinated \r\nregional efforts, and the fulfilment of their obligations \r\nby international stakeholders, will contribute to \r\nensuring Afghanistan’s sustainable development and \r\nits people’s prosperity. Building a sustainable, stable \r\nnation is crucial, not only for the future of the Afghan \r\npeople but also for peace and stability in the region, \r\nAsia and the world.\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran has always firmly \r\nsupported Afghanistan in its efforts to maintain its \r\nnational sovereignty, independence and territorial \r\nintegrity and to realize enduring peace and stability. \r\nWe hope that the international community will adhere \r\nto the principle of an Afghan-led and Afghan-owned \r\nprocess and continue to support the Government and the \r\npeople of Afghanistan in their efforts to achieve peace \r\n12-60766 23\r\nA/67/PV.41\r\nbeen held in Istanbul, Bonn, Kabul, Chicago and \r\nTokyo have enabled the international community to \r\ndemonstrate its commitment to ensuring the security, \r\nstability and long-term development of a democratic \r\nAfghanistan. For its part, the Afghan Government is \r\ncommitted to enhancing transparency, responsibility \r\nand respect for human rights and the rule of law. This \r\nyear’s draft resolution reiterates and further enhances \r\nthose mutual commitments. We are encouraged to \r\nsee that it is once again to be adopted by consensus. \r\nThat consensus is of particular importance during the \r\ntransitional phase, whose success depends upon the \r\ncooperation and support of all partners in Afghanistan. \r\nThis year’s draft resolution recognizes the role \r\nthat the regional community plays in the transition and \r\ncalls upon Afghanistan’s neighbours to increase their \r\ncooperation in order to combat the Taliban. Paragraph \r\n83 refers in particular to the critical role that regional \r\ncooperation plays in ensuring peace, security, stability \r\nand socioeconomic development in Afghanistan, \r\nwhile paragraph 85 recognizes the important need to \r\nstrengthen trust and cooperation between Afghanistan, \r\nneighbouring countries and regional partners so that, \r\ntogether, they can combat the Taliban, Al-Qaida and \r\nother extremist groups, including the Islamic Emirate \r\nof Afghanistan, the Taliban, Al-Qaida, the Quetta and \r\nPeshawar Shuras and the Haqqani network.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nThat language makes clear the critical role that \r\nAfghanistan’s neighbours play in the stability and \r\nlong-term prosperity of the country. Indeed, those who \r\ndo not support stability in Afghanistan are working \r\nagainst the interests of peace and freedom, and may \r\nalso be in contravention of Security Council resolution \r\n1368 (2001). Canada also emphasizes the importance \r\nof holding free and fair elections in Afghanistan. We \r\nrecognize that the Government of Afghanistan has \r\nalready taken steps to reform its electoral system, \r\nin the hope of ensuring that future elections will be \r\ndemocratic, transparent, credible and inclusive. Yet \r\nmore must be done.\r\nWe urge the Government of Afghanistan to \r\ntake immediate action to continue to strengthen its \r\nelectoral laws and processes in order to ensure that the \r\nirregularities and attempted fraud that took place in its \r\nmost recent presidential and parliamentary elections do \r\nnot recur. We also urge the international community \r\nand donors in Afghanistan to work actively to prevent \r\nis among the top three priority country programmes \r\nfor Slovak official development assistance. For a more \r\nobjective picture, the amount of our aid should be \r\ncompared to the size of our country.\r\nWe are aware that Afghanistan will need help \r\nfrom the international community even after 2014. \r\nThere has rightly been a focus on working on longer-\r\nterm plans, and commitments are in place to help build \r\nAfghanistan’s political, security and development \r\nself-sufficiency. To mention some examples of Slovak \r\nengagement, since 2004 we have approved 22 projects \r\nfor Afghanistan, aimed at building schools in rural \r\nareas, providing education for girls and women, and \r\nsupporting small enterprises, local TV broadcasting, \r\ncapacity-building and civil society.\r\nThe Government of the Slovak Republic has already \r\napproved full debt relief for Afghanistan, and is ready \r\nto fulfil the pledge it made at the Tokyo Conference \r\nearlier this year, which it has since reiterated on several \r\noccasions through bilateral channels. We are ready to \r\nmaintain the levels and modalities of our assistance \r\nin years to come while concentrating on the sectors \r\nof health care, rural and socioeconomic development \r\nand building civil society and security institutions. \r\nWe believe that through targeted projects that are well \r\ncoordinated and in line with the Afghan Government’s \r\npriorities we can improve the daily lives of the Afghan \r\npeople. Step by step, we can help to reach our common \r\ngoal of a secure, stable and prosperous country.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to take this opportunity \r\nto express our sincere gratitude to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and his Special Representative, Mr. Kubiš, for \r\nthe dedicated and outstanding work being carried out by \r\nthe United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan. \r\nWe encourage the Afghan people and Government \r\nto strengthen their relations with the United Nations \r\nand to use the opportunity for cooperation with the \r\nOrganization to its full potential. We believe that \r\nthe central role of the United Nations remains one of \r\nthe key factors in promoting peace and stability in \r\nAfghanistan.\r\nMr. Husain (Canada) (spoke in French): Canada is \r\npleased to be a sponsor of the draft resolution introduced \r\ntoday on the situation in Afghanistan (A/67/L.16), and \r\nwe thank the German delegation for coordinating the \r\nprocess.\r\nThe past year was particularly important for \r\nAfghanistan’s transition. The conferences that have \r\n24 12-60766\r\nA/67/PV.41\r\nrural development, support women’s empowerment and \r\nstrengthen civil society.\r\nMy country is also determined to maintain strong \r\nsupport for the reform and further development of \r\na sustainable civilian police force and rule-of-law \r\ninstitutions through the European Union Police Mission \r\nin Afghanistan. Lithuania has been contributing to that \r\nMission and will continue to do so. The Mission, which \r\nis fully integrated into the wider international efforts \r\nto reform the Afghan national police, has been working \r\nclosely to that end with key partners, including the \r\nUnited Nations. Our goal is make sure that its efforts \r\ndeliver substantial results in the country’s provinces. \r\nWe are convinced that the Afghan National Security \r\nForces are capable of maintaining security in their \r\ncountry, as it is their responsibility and their right to do.\r\nSince 2010, Lithuania has focused on training and \r\nproviding assistance to Afghan provincial security \r\nforces. In line with the objective of handing over full \r\nresponsibility for security to Afghans by the end of \r\n2014, my country will continue to support Afghanistan \r\non its path towards self-reliance and security. In \r\nthat regard, our Government has decided to allocate \r\n$500,000 annually to supporting the Afghan National \r\nSecurity Forces for a period of three years, from 2015 \r\nto 2017.\r\nAfghanistan must maintain the pace of reforms. \r\nThe development and smooth implementation of \r\nnational priority programmes, improved transparency \r\nand accountability, the fight against corruption, and \r\nrespect for human rights — in particular the rights and \r\nempowerment of women — remain essential elements \r\nif international assistance and domestic transformation \r\nefforts are to succeed. Prosperity and security grow \r\nwhen neighbours trust each other. Lithuania encourages \r\nAfghan efforts to foster international cooperation \r\nthrough the Afghan-led Istanbul Process. In September \r\n2012, my country hosted an international conference \r\nunder the theme “Afghanistan and the region: practical \r\napproaches for sustainable development,” which brought \r\ntogether high-level participants from Afghanistan, \r\nCentral and South Asia and the Nordic/Baltic region. \r\nThe conference was an opportunity to share best \r\npractices and successful examples of regional integration \r\nand cooperation. One of the conclusions drawn by \r\nparticipants in the conference was that free-trade \r\nagreements were essential between Afghanistan and its \r\nclosest neighbours. Gains in education at the national \r\nlevel could be further supported through a regional \r\nfraud before, during and after the elections. That will \r\nhelp ensure that the people of Afghanistan have a voice \r\nin the future of their country and that indecision does \r\nnot prevent the Afghan Government from meeting the \r\ndemands of civil society and of legitimate political \r\nactors.\r\nTransparency and accountability will be essential \r\nas we move towards transition, so as to ensure that \r\ninternational assistance is delivered responsibly, \r\nefficiently and effectively. Canada reiterates its \r\nexpectation that the Government of Afghanistan \r\nwill demonstrate tangible results with the assistance \r\nprovided by the international community. Specifically, \r\nAfghanistan must follow through on the commitments \r\nit made during the Tokyo Conference on Afghanistan to \r\ncombat corruption and increase transparency in order to \r\nestablish more effective and accountable administration \r\nat the national, provincial and local levels.\r\nMs. Murmokaite (Lithuania): I would like to thank \r\nthe Secretary-General for his regular critical reporting \r\non the situation in Afghanistan. I also thank Germany \r\nand the sponsors of draft resolution A/67/L.16. We look \r\nforward to its adoption by consensus.\r\nLet me reiterate how much importance we attach \r\nto the United Nations efforts in Afghanistan. Given \r\nthe reconfiguration of the United Nations Assistance \r\nMission in Afghanistan and the decrease in resources, a \r\ncontinued debate on the role and responsibilities of the \r\nUnited Nations in Afghanistan is necessary. \r\nWe welcome the further consolidation of the \r\ncommitments to partnership and mutual accountability \r\nmade by the Afghan Government and the international \r\ncommunity at the Tokyo Conference on Afghanistan. \r\nIn Tokyo, Lithuania reconfirmed its commitment \r\nto continue political support for, and assistance to, \r\nAfghanistan in the run-up to 2014 and beyond. Over the \r\npast seven years, Lithuania has provided approximately \r\n€4.5 million in funding for a wide range of projects. We \r\nare determined to keep our development assistance at \r\nthe current level and to support civilian and military \r\ncapacity-building efforts after the transition has been \r\ncompleted. Education, health care, good governance \r\nand the rule of law are some of the areas in which \r\nthe Afghan Government has achieved considerable \r\nprogress and which remain critical for the future of \r\nthe country. We will continue to work with the Afghan \r\nauthorities to build administrative capacities, promote \r\n12-60766 25\r\nA/67/PV.41\r\n“Little has changed in the underlying dynamics \r\nto mitigate a deep-seated cycle of confl ict. \r\nFurthermore, a diminished international presence \r\nwill have a signifi cant fi nancial impact in many areas \r\nthat, at least in the short term, may even exacerbate \r\npredatory behaviour”. (A/67/354, para. 62)\r\n Afghanistan continues to face an existential threat \r\nfrom terrorism, which draws upon ideological, financial \r\nand logistical support from beyond its borders. The \r\nsecurity situation remains fragile, and there has been \r\na sharp increase in the variety, spread and intensity of \r\nattacks by the Taliban and their backers. Moreover, the \r\ncross-border shelling of the past few months has caused \r\nlarge-scale disruptions to normal life and has sparked \r\npublic outrage. The Afghan National Security Forces are \r\nill-equipped to repel that challenge without substantial \r\nassistance from the international community. We need \r\nconcerted action to isolate and root out the syndicate \r\nof terrorism, which includes elements of Al-Qaida, \r\nthe Taliban, Lashkar-e-Taiba and other terrorist and \r\nextremist groups. \r\nAs Afghanistan takes forward the task of national \r\nreconciliation, in accordance with the criteria laid down \r\nin the Kabul Communiqué, we fully support regional \r\nconfidence-building efforts as a critical component \r\nof international efforts to support the country. \r\nRegional cooperation and connectivity are critical for \r\nAfghanistan’s political and economic progress. The \r\nIstanbul Heart of Asia Process is an important step in \r\nthat direction. To strengthen that cooperation, India has \r\ntaken the lead in two commercial confidence-building \r\nmeasures under the Istanbul Process.\r\nWe are fully cognizant that the economic viability \r\nof Afghanistan depends on its fuller integration into \r\nits neighbourhood so that it can regain its historical \r\nrole as a land bridge between South Asia, Central \r\nAsia, the Middle East and Eurasia. The development \r\nof transport infrastructure and transit arrangements \r\nlinking Afghanistan to the north, south, east and west, \r\nincluding through the Chabahar port, would benefit \r\nnot only Afghanistan but also the entire Central \r\nAsian region by creating trade, transit and investment \r\nlinkages.\r\nAfghanistan and India have a long shared history \r\ngoing back over millennia. The two countries are \r\nnatural strategic partners by virtue of geography and a \r\ncommon vision of peace and cooperation in the region. \r\nOur bilateral relationship is extensive, multifaceted \r\nand characterized by high-level interaction. President \r\nnetwork of universities. Regional projects in the areas \r\nof energy, communications, border management, the \r\nenvironment and other spheres would bind communities \r\nand people together. Free media also remain essential \r\nfor fostering understanding and a sense of community. \r\nPolitical dialogue must be driven by the future agenda \r\nrather than past history.\r\nIn conclusion, our commitment to Afghanistan and \r\nour support for that country’s stability, security and \r\ndevelopment remains firm now and will continue to be \r\nso after the transition period. \r\nMr. Hardeep Singh Puri (India): At the outset, \r\nI would like to express India’s appreciation to the \r\nPresident for scheduling this discussion. I also avail \r\nmyself of this opportunity to commend the German \r\ndelegation for coordinating the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations in an excellent manner, which has brought \r\nus the annual draft resolution on the situation in \r\nAfghanistan. As we have for the past several years, we \r\nare happy to sponsor draft resolution A/67/L.16, which \r\nhas traditionally been adopted by consensus.\r\nMajor international and regional conferences on \r\nAfghanistan were held during the past year against \r\nthe backdrop of the ongoing security transition. The \r\ninternational community renewed its commitment to \r\npeace, security and development in Afghanistan at \r\nconferences in Bonn, Chicago and Tokyo, as well as at \r\nthe regional level in Istanbul and Kabul.\r\nAs the Afghan Government assumes responsibility \r\nfor security and governance, with the drawdown of the \r\nInternational Security Assistance Force (ISAF) by the \r\nend of 2014, we welcome the pledges of $16 billion in \r\nfinancial aid through 2015 that were made at the Tokyo \r\nConference on Afghanistan, as well as the commitment \r\nto sustain support through 2017 at, or near, the levels \r\nof the past decade. At the same time, we are conscious \r\nthat those figures represent the baseline, or minimum \r\nrequirement, for Afghanistan to sustain itself.\r\nThe Delhi Investment Summit of 28 June, hosted \r\nby India, was an important endeavour in directing the \r\nfocus of regional and international attention towards \r\ninvesting in Afghanistan and its potential to provide \r\neconomic development and stability to Afghanistan \r\nduring the transition period.\r\nAmid the drawdown of ISAF and the accompanying \r\neconomic downturn, it is indeed worrisome that the \r\ninfrastructure of terror is still intact in the region. The \r\nSecretary-General’s latest report notes: \r\n26 12-60766\r\nA/67/PV.41\r\nOver the course of 2012, the partnership between \r\nthe international community and Afghanistan has \r\nfurther strengthened, while the Afghan Government’s \r\nownership and its growing role in security and economic \r\nplanning have been steadily increasing. \r\nThe international community has demonstrated \r\nits renewed commitment to the Afghan people beyond \r\n2014. At the Chicago Summit in May and the Tokyo \r\nConference in July, the international community took \r\nsteps to provide long-term financial support to the \r\nAfghan people in their efforts to establish sustainable \r\npeace and security and to rebuild their country.\r\nFor its part, the Afghan Government committed \r\nitself to achieving more efficiency and transparency in \r\nits governance at the Tokyo Conference. Efforts have \r\nalso been made over the past months to enhance its \r\nsecurity capability and to formulate its development \r\nstrategy. In particular, the Government of the Republic \r\nof Korea welcomes the Afghan presidential decree \r\nissued on 27 July to implement Afghan commitments \r\nunder the Tokyo Mutual Accountability Framework. It \r\nis our hope that concrete actions will be followed and \r\npositive changes made on the ground. We also welcome \r\nthe appointment of the new Chair of the High Peace \r\nCouncil in April as an important step in the Afghan-led \r\nand Afghan-owned peace and reconciliation process.\r\nAs stated in the Secretary-General’s report \r\n(A/67/354), the transfer of responsibility for security \r\narrangements to the Afghan authorities is progressing \r\nas planned. As of now, 75 per cent of Afghanistan’s \r\npopulation lives in areas where the Afghan Government \r\ntakes the lead for security. By mid-2013, the Afghan \r\nforces will take the lead in ensuring security nationwide.\r\nAs we prepare for the mid-2013 milestone, closer \r\ncooperation between the international community \r\nand the Afghan Government will become all the more \r\nimportant so that the transition process does not hinder \r\npeace and stability in Afghanistan. In that regard, we are \r\ndeeply concerned about the increasing insider attacks, \r\nas they could further affect the long-term prospect for \r\nstability in the country. While the Afghan Government \r\nshould make serious efforts to prevent such attacks, the \r\nunwavering support of the international community \r\nwill be needed more than ever.\r\nAt the same time, political reform and good \r\ngovernance by the Afghan Government will continue \r\nto remain vital to the successful transition. Building \r\nregional cooperation will underpin the stability and the \r\nKarzai visited India earlier this month. That visit \r\noffered an opportunity to review the entire gamut of \r\nthe bilateral relationship and to discuss regional and \r\ninternational issues of mutual interest. During the visit, \r\nPrime Minister Manmohan Singh reiterated India’s \r\nsupport for Afghanistan during the crucial period of \r\ntransition up to the end of 2014 and thereafter. \r\nThe implementation of the strategic partnership \r\nagreement of October 2011 between the two countries \r\nhas already been set in motion with the convening of \r\nthe first meeting of the Partnership Council on 1 May. \r\nDuring the past decade, India pledged up to $2 billion \r\nin development and humanitarian assistance. We have \r\nmanaged to carry out some of the most economical and \r\ncost-effective projects in Afghanistan. The $500 million \r\nassistance announced by the Prime Minister of India in \r\nMay 2011 is being spent from 2012 to 2015. The projects \r\nunder consideration will be in line with the projects \r\nsuggested under the national priority programmes of \r\nthe Government of Afghanistan. The pace and nature \r\nof the utilization of present and future Indian assistance \r\nwill be determined by the preference, comfort level and \r\nabsorptive capacity of the Afghan Government.\r\nIndia remains unwavering in its commitment to \r\nassist the people of Afghanistan in their endeavour to \r\nbuild a peaceful, stable, democratic and prosperous \r\nnation. We support the good work done by the United \r\nNations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA). \r\nIt is important that amid the cutback in United Nations \r\nfootprint in Afghanistan and the reconfiguration of \r\nUNAMA due to budgetary constraints, all efforts \r\nshould be made to avoid an adverse impact on its \r\noperational effectiveness. \r\nMoving forward, we need to create an enabling \r\nenvironment in which the Afghan people can live in \r\npeace and security and decide their future themselves, \r\nwithout outside interference, coercion or intimidation. \r\nThe international community must continue to work \r\nwith renewed vigour and unity of purpose to strengthen \r\nthe efforts of the Afghan Government in seeking \r\nsolutions that are inclusive and are led by the Afghan \r\npeople themselves.\r\nMr. Shin Dong Ik (Republic of Korea): At the \r\noutset, my delegation would like to pay tribute to the \r\nUnited Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, the \r\nparticipating members of the International Security \r\nAssistance Force and other international agencies, as \r\nwell as civil society, all of whom are playing vital roles \r\nin building a peaceful and democratic Afghanistan. \r\n12-60766 27\r\nA/67/PV.41\r\nthat establishes a broad framework for bilateral \r\ncooperation beyond the transition. In July, Afghan and \r\nAustralian ministers also signed the Memorandum of \r\nUnderstanding on Development Cooperation. \r\nAustralia has increased its fi nancial and development \r\nassistance beyond 2014. Our development assistance \r\nwill increase from $165 million to $250 million per year \r\nby 2015, and we will provide $100 million per year to \r\nsustain Afghan National Security Forces sustainment \r\nfrom 2015 to 2017.\r\nThroughout the transition period, Australia will \r\ncontinue to provide support to Afghanistan, centred \r\non Uruzgan province, where we lead the provincial \r\nreconstruction team and where, in October, we assumed \r\ncommand of the combined team. In the latter framework, \r\nAustralian troops, diplomats and aid workers cooperate \r\nand work in partnership with their Afghan counterparts \r\non a daily basis.\r\nIn 2012, the Afghan Government itself has made \r\nsignificant commitments. The year ahead will see \r\nAfghanistan implement reforms to improve governance, \r\nprepare for the presidential and parliamentary elections \r\nin 2014 and 2015, bolster anti-corruption efforts and \r\npromote and protect human rights. We commend the \r\nrevitalization of the High Peace Council and its efforts \r\nto work towards a political solution, including through \r\nthe Afghanistan Peace and Reintegration Programme. \r\nThe international community, particularly the United \r\nNations, has a key role to play in supporting those \r\nefforts, and the peace process must include all sectors \r\nof Afghan society and involve the active participation \r\nof women.\r\nAustralia welcomes the agreement between \r\nAfghanistan and the international community enshrined \r\nin the Tokyo Mutual Accountability Framework. \r\nImplementing those principles and goals should guide \r\nour partnership next year, in 2014 and throughout the \r\nnext decade.\r\nAfghanistan has already shown demonstrable \r\nprogress. We welcome the Independent Election \r\nCommission’s announcement, endorsed by President \r\nKarzai, that the presidential election will be held on \r\n5 April 2014. A credible, inclusive and transparent \r\npresidential election will be essential to political \r\ntransition in Afghanistan and will mark the significant \r\nprogress made over the last decade.\r\nlivelihoods of the Afghan people. Furthermore, in the \r\nlight of the Afghan presidential election to be held in \r\n2014, it is even more important to make headway in the \r\npolitical process.\r\nThe Government of the Republic of Korea has been \r\nactively supporting Afghanistan’s capacity-building, \r\nespecially since setting up a provincial reconstruction \r\nteam in Parwan province in 2010. To continue such \r\nefforts, following last year’s contribution of $50 million \r\nto the Afghan National Army Trust Fund, the Korean \r\nGovernment will this year contribute an additional \r\n$50 million to the Fund, as well as another $50 million \r\nto the Law and Order Trust Fund for Afghanistan.\r\nAgainst that backdrop, my delegation welcomes \r\ntoday’s draft resolution on the situation in Afghanistan \r\n(A/67/L.16), which embodies the political will of all \r\nMember States that support the Afghan people in \r\ntheir political and national reconstruction process. \r\nIt is in that vein that the Republic of Korea joined in \r\nsponsoring the draft resolution as a way of underlining \r\nour unwavering support. I would like to reiterate \r\nthat the Republic of Korea will remain committed to \r\nworking with the Afghan people and their Government, \r\nas well as with the international community, to build a \r\nmore prosperous, secure and democratic Afghanistan.\r\nMs. King (Australia): Australia welcomes the \r\nopportunity to sponsor the General Assembly’s draft \r\nresolution on Afghanistan (A/67/L.16) again in 2012. \r\nThis was a crucial year for the partnership between \r\nAfghanistan and the international community, during \r\nwhich we made strong commitments to support \r\nAfghanistan’s future. That partnership rests on \r\nmutual assurances between the Afghan Government \r\nand the international community — that the Afghan \r\nGovernment will lead its people towards a stable, secure \r\nand self-sufficient State, and that the international \r\ncommunity will continue to support Afghanistan \r\nduring the transition and beyond.\r\nAs Australian Prime Minister Gillard noted in her \r\nspeech to our Parliament last month, 2012 has seen \r\nsignificant progress in planning beyond transition, \r\nwith a comprehensive international framework for \r\nsupporting Afghanistan beyond 2014 now in place. \r\nAustralia too has made significant commitments in \r\nthat regard. We have established important agreements \r\nthis year to underpin and strengthen bilateral relations. \r\nPrime Minister Gillard and President Karzai signed \r\na comprehensive long-term partnership in May \r\n28 12-60766\r\nA/67/PV.41\r\nMy Government has made Afghanistan’s \r\ndevelopment and stability a key priority. Australia’s \r\nterm on the Security Council will coincide with a \r\ncritical time of transition in Afghanistan and with \r\nour continued efforts to implement a comprehensive \r\nframework for Afghanistan’s future. Australia remains \r\ncommitted to working with the Afghan Government, \r\nthe Afghan people and international partners to achieve \r\nthe common goal of a peaceful, secure and stable \r\nAfghanistan.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on agenda item 38. The Assembly \r\nwill now take a decision on draft resolution A/67/L.16.\r\nI give the f loor to the representative of the \r\nSecretariat.\r\nMr. Botnaru (Department for General Assembly \r\nand Conference Management): I would like to announce \r\nthat, since draft resolution A/67/L.16 was submitted, \r\nthe following countries have also become sponsors: \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Cambodia, \r\nChina, Eritrea, Greece, Haiti, Indonesia, Malta, \r\nMicronesia, Morocco, New Zealand, Palau, Peru, the \r\nPhilippines, Serbia, Switzerland, Turkmenistan, the \r\nUnited Kingdom, the United Republic of Tanzania and \r\nUzbekistan. \r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that the \r\nAssembly decides to adopt draft resolution A/67/L.16? \r\nDraft resolution A/67/L.16 was adopted \r\n(resolution 67/16). \r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is \r\nthe wish of the General Assembly to conclude its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 38? \r\nIt was so decided. \r\nThe meeting rose at 1.20 p.m.\r\nWe are pleased to see that the General Assembly \r\ndraft resolution before us welcomes the recent progress. \r\nBut it also realistically highlights the challenges that \r\nAfghanistan and the international community continue \r\nto face. At the most fundamental level, we must continue \r\nto ensure that Afghanistan will never again become a \r\nsafe haven for international terrorism. We all have a \r\nstake in preventing the return of international terrorism \r\nto Afghanistan. \r\nWe also need to continue the fight against narcotics \r\nand drug trafficking. We must persist in efforts to \r\npromote regional cooperation through bodies such as \r\nthe Heart of Asia group of countries. And we must \r\ncontinue to encourage anti-corruption reforms.\r\nAustralia welcomes the emphasis placed in the draft \r\nresolution on support for Afghanistan’s efforts to protect \r\nhuman rights, particularly those of women and girls, to \r\norganize elections and, of course, to provide security to \r\nthe Afghan people. All of those efforts will be Afghan-\r\nled, and the draft resolution rightly emphasizes that. \r\nBut it also demonstrates the international community’s \r\nongoing support for Afghanistan’s own efforts.\r\nThe United Nations continues to play a critical role \r\nin Afghanistan’s long-term development and stability. \r\nWe welcome the central role of the United Nations in \r\ncoordinating international efforts to support human \r\nrights, governance and the rule of law, preparations for \r\nelections, humanitarian assistance, reintegration and \r\ncounter-narcotics efforts.\r\nWe again welcome the Secretary-General’s \r\nassurances in his quarterly report (A/67/354) that, \r\ndespite the reconfiguration of the United Nations \r\nAssistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), coupled \r\nwith a significant reduction in its resources, the United \r\nNations commitment to Afghanistan remains steadfast. \r\nAustralia continues to strongly support UNAMA’s \r\nmandate.\r\n"
