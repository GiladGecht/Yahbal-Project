On behalf of the Group of \r\nFriends, I would also like to welcome our new members, \r\nJapan and Denmark.\r\nThe year 2011 marked the tenth anniversary of \r\nthe mandate of the Special Adviser to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on Sport for Development and Peace and \r\nof that Office within the United Nations. The efforts \r\nled by the Special Advisers, Mr. Ogi and Mr. Lemke, \r\nduring the past 10 years have helped to establish the \r\nrecognition of sport as a tool for promoting the goals \r\nof peace and development, as enshrined in the ideals \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations. Sport has adopted \r\nvalues that tend to promote social inclusion, gender \r\nequality, tolerance, respect for rules and health through \r\nits striving to outdo itself. Support for such values \r\nis fundamental and should be encouraged in a world \r\ndealing with new challenges every day.\r\nIn the context of the duty we bear to strive for a \r\npeaceful, better world, we must put to good use all of \r\nthe means available to us, and sport is one of them. \r\nWe can all use sport, collectively or individually, in \r\nmany situations, as the report of the Secretary-General \r\n(A/67/282) emphasizes. That is because, where politics \r\nsometimes fail and life discriminates, sport can bring \r\ndivided and devastated peoples and communities \r\ntogether and include everybody, regardless of social \r\nclass, age, race and even disability.\r\nThis year’s biennial draft resolution introduces \r\na new programme oriented towards the work of the \r\nOffice of the Special Adviser, to whom I would like to \r\nexpress our sincere congratulations on his leadership \r\nand the determination with which he has been working \r\non the ground, both concretely and effectively, to \r\nfurther our goals. He has succeeded in meeting the \r\nchallenge of integrating sport as an instrument capable \r\nof responding to a large number of cross-cutting \r\nissues relating to implementation of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. In many situations he has shown \r\nthat sport can contribute significantly to dealing with \r\nsociety’s problems.\r\nThe draft resolution also highlights the crucial \r\nand growing importance of women in sport and how \r\nessential it is to empower them, if we are to achieve \r\nlasting development. Similarly, it seeks to encourage \r\nthe full participation of developing countries, especially \r\nthe least developed, in efforts to develop national sports \r\nUnited Nations A/67/PV.42\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-seventh session\r\n42nd plenary meeting\r\nWednesday, 28 November 2012, 10 a.m.\r\nNew York\r\nOffi cial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Jeremić  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Serbia)\r\n2 12-61261\r\nA/67/PV.42\r\ninstitutions and capacities that will enable them to take \r\nadvantage of economic opportunities.\r\nIn the light of the success and enormous popularity \r\nof some of the great recent sporting events, the draft \r\nresolution seeks to acknowledge and strengthen \r\nprivate-public partnerships in sport, which can \r\nhave very positive effects on the development of \r\nsocial and institutional infrastructures. The draft \r\nresolution also welcomes the numerous partnerships \r\nestablished between the United Nations system and the \r\nInternational Olympic Committee since its attainment \r\nof observer status in the General Assembly. It also \r\naffirms the contribution that the Olympic movement \r\nhas made to establishing sport as a unique means of \r\npromoting peace and development, particularly through \r\nthe Olympic Truce.\r\nIn my national capacity, I would also like to \r\nrecall the Principality of Monaco’s commitment to \r\nfurther strengthening the power of sport. Their Serene \r\nHighnesses Prince Albert II and Princess Charlene, \r\nthemselves both Olympians, are determined to promote \r\nsport as a tool for development and peace. Both within \r\nthe Group of Friends of Sport for Development and \r\nPeace, which we are pleased to say is mentioned in the \r\ntext of the draft resolution for the first time, and in its \r\ngeneral policies, Monaco seeks to promote dialogue \r\nand facilitate and encourage the integration of sport in \r\norder to achieve the goals of the United Nations.\r\nSport’s unprecedented ability to mobilize people \r\ngives us this opportunity, now fully recognized, to \r\ndefend our ideals and share our ambitions to fight \r\npoverty and achieve peace. It is in that spirit that the \r\nInternational University of Monaco and the University \r\nfor Peace have formed a partnership, which, supported \r\nby Peace and Sport, a global initiative under the high \r\npatronage of Prince Albert II, enables students to take \r\nmaster’s degrees in innovative subjects such as lasting \r\npeace through sport. I would also like to recall the sixth \r\nPeace and Sport International Forum, which just took \r\nplace in Sochi in the Russian Federation and which \r\ndiscussed the effectiveness of the Olympic Games as a \r\ndiplomatic platform.\r\nI cannot close without offering the Government \r\nof Monaco’s hearty congratulations to the British \r\nauthorities for the magic moments they gave us during \r\nthe Olympic and Paralympic Games in London. On \r\na technical point, I would also like to thank all the \r\nsponsors of the draft resolution and note, for those \r\nwishing to become sponsors, that the list will be open \r\nuntil the end of the debate on this agenda item.\r\nMrs. Harbaoui (Tunisia) (spoke in French): I would \r\nfirst like to express my delegation’s satisfaction with the \r\npublication of the Secretary-General’s report entitled \r\n“Sport for development and peace: mainstreaming a \r\nversatile instrument” (A/67/282), and to welcome the \r\nactivities undertaken during the past year within the \r\nUnited Nations system, particularly by the Office on \r\nSport for Development and Peace. I would also like \r\nto emphasize my delegation’s appreciation for the \r\nuntiring and continuing efforts of Mr. Wilfried Lemke, \r\nSpecial Adviser to the Secretary-General on Sport for \r\nDevelopment and Peace. We wish him every success in \r\nhis worthy task and assure him of our full support in \r\nhis efforts to maximize the success of programmes to \r\npromote sport around the world.\r\nSport is a determining element in setting norms \r\nof good citizenship and therefore plays a special role \r\nin promoting the coherence of a healthy social fabric. \r\nWe believe that access to sport is a fundamental social \r\nright and that sport is an important agent for social \r\ncohesion and development. It promotes high values and \r\ncontributes to a solid education for our children and \r\nyoung people.\r\nSport has become part of the United Nations value \r\nsystem — an effective tool to be included from now on \r\nas one of our Organization’s main themes. I reiterate \r\nTunisia’s resolve to take steps to enlist sport’s capacity \r\nto promote communication and understanding and \r\nmake it a powerful national and international agent \r\nfor inclusion and development, as well as a means to \r\npromote solidarity, tolerance and cultural and personal \r\ndiversity. I also welcome the interest shown in sport \r\nby the whole of our membership and the general belief \r\nin its worldwide utility as a tool for promoting peace, \r\ndevelopment, education and health.\r\nI take this opportunity to voice our warm \r\ncongratulations to the United Kingdom on having \r\norganized the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games in \r\nLondon. Those two events solidified the principle of the \r\nOlympic Truce and the ideals of the United Nations and \r\nthe Olympic movement — friendship among peoples, \r\nharmony, non-violence and non-discrimination. \r\nThey also clearly demonstrated sport’s ability to \r\npromote unity and friendship and the shared spirit of \r\nsportsmanship among athletes and fans, no matter what \r\ntheir origins, political leanings or faiths. I also want \r\n12-61261 3\r\nA/67/PV.42\r\nto congratulate the Russian Federation on its upcoming \r\nWinter Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2014 in \r\nSochi and the Brazilian Government for its selection to \r\nhost two major sporting events, the 2014 International \r\nFederation of Association Football World Cup and the \r\nOlympic and Paralympic Games in 2016.\r\nGiven the potential of sport to inspire and its vital \r\ncontribution in energizing new generations avid for \r\nphysical and mental health, Tunisia urges Member \r\nStates to take all measures necessary to address the \r\ndangerous phenomenon of doping, which threatens not \r\nonly athletes’ health but also the image and credibility \r\nof sporting events. We welcome the growing number \r\nof Member States that have signed the International \r\nConvention against Doping in Sport. It is also important \r\nto ensure that education systems and civil society \r\norganizations educate young people about the ethics \r\nof sport and sportsmanship, so as to prevent sports \r\narenas and events from being used to promulgate racist, \r\nxenophobic and exclusionary slogans.\r\nZealous to nurture the tradition of sportsmanship \r\nand to utilize sport in the promotion of universal shared \r\nvalues for the benefit of future generations, my country \r\njoins Monaco in introducing draft resolution A/67/L.26, \r\nentitled “Sport as a means to promote education, health, \r\ndevelopment and peace”, on behalf of the Group of \r\nFriends of Sport for Development and Peace and the \r\nsponsors.\r\nThe draft resolution urges all concerned parties to \r\ncooperate with the Special Adviser to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in expanding awareness of the importance \r\nof including sport in development programmes, and \r\nencourages Member States to name focal points on \r\nsport for development and peace, as well as to create \r\ninnovative partnerships with the United Nations Office \r\non Sport for Development and Peace. I hope that the \r\ndraft resolution will enjoy the support of all Member \r\nStates, which would send a strong message to the men \r\nand women working nobly to promote the practice of \r\nsport and raise the cheer of all athletes.\r\nMr. León González (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nThe Charter of the United Nations, drafted in San \r\nFrancisco, set out principles for what was to be a new \r\nsystem of international relations that would prevent a \r\nrepetition of the horrific experiences of the twentieth \r\ncentury’s two World Wars. The primary challenge set \r\nout in the first sentence of the Preamble is “to save \r\nsucceeding generations from the scourge of war” and \r\nto create a democratic, equitable world order based on \r\nequal respect for the dignity of all people.\r\nThe Organization that we belong to today was \r\ncreated for those purposes, with the stated goal of \r\nmaintaining international peace and security, based \r\non the ideals of the sovereign equality of all Members, \r\nthe peaceful settlement of international disputes, the \r\nnon-use or threat of use of force and non-intervention \r\nin the internal affairs of States. The promise was also \r\nheld out that all peoples would achieve economic and \r\nsocial progress.\r\nHowever, after more than six decades of the \r\nOrganization’s existence, we are witness to a \r\ndismal economic and social picture, characterized \r\nsimultaneously by the economic and financial crisis, \r\nthe food and energy crises and the harmful impact \r\nof climate change, every day further endangering the \r\nhuman race. As a result of those problems, themselves \r\nthe result of the current unjust and inequitable \r\ninternational order, the efforts of the countries of the \r\nSouth to achieve progress and development have been \r\nhampered. Today more than ever we must forge a climate \r\nof international peace, through solidarity, cooperation \r\nand multilateralism as our fundamental values.\r\nSport is an important aspect of national and \r\ninternational development. Cuba believes that the \r\npractice of sport strengthens solidarity and friendship \r\namong nations — elements critical to peace, development \r\nand cooperation among nations. Following the triumph \r\nof the Cuban Revolution in 1959, sport ceased to be an \r\nexclusive activity in our country, becoming instead \r\na right enjoyed by all. In order to exercise that right, \r\nwe have promoted an educational system that includes \r\nphysical education as an integral component of human \r\ndevelopment at all stages. That has led to resounding \r\nsuccesses in regional and international competitions. \r\nAn example is Cuba’s success in the 2012 London \r\nOlympic Games, in which our small developing country \r\nranked sixteenth in the number of medals won. We \r\nare one of the first developing countries to rank that \r\nhigh. Similarly, Cuba ranked fifteenth in this year’s \r\nParalympic Games, in its best performance to date, \r\nwinning nine gold medals.\r\nWe strive for early sports training for our children, \r\nallowing us to nurture unique talents destined to meet \r\nand raise the standards set by our country on the \r\ninternational sports stage. At the same time, we oppose \r\nan athletic spirit motivated purely by financial gain. We \r\n4 12-61261\r\nA/67/PV.42\r\ntherefore condemn the theft of athletic talent, which \r\nnegatively impacts developing countries.\r\nFor years the Cuban sport movement, led by the \r\nCuban Olympic Committee and the National Institute of \r\nSport, Physical Education and Recreation, has provided \r\nimpartial assistance to various countries of the South \r\nbased on bilateral agreements, sending technicians, \r\ntrainers and teachers, who, in their own modest way, \r\nhave conveyed our training methods in the field of \r\nsport and have enhanced the success and increasing \r\ninvolvement in sport in those countries, thereby forging \r\nstrong ties of brotherhood and friendship between \r\npeoples.\r\nWe have also strengthened international cooperation \r\nby making available to countries of the South the Institute \r\nfor Sports Medicine and the Anti-doping Laboratory, \r\nto help fight the scourge of drugs that is corrupting \r\nathletes and that impedes fair play and the education \r\nand culture of athletes and trainers. Furthermore, Cuba \r\nfounded the International School of Physical Education \r\nand Sports, which is devoted to training professionals \r\nwhose fundamental value is solidarity and who are \r\nable to transform physical education and sports in their \r\ncountries.\r\nWe would also like to highlight that the countries \r\nof the South also deserve to host the Olympic Games, \r\na forum for brotherhood and solidarity in sports that \r\nis free from commercial interests. We are certain that \r\nthe 2016 Olympic Games, to be held in Rio de Janeiro, \r\nBrazil, will be a success for all the South.\r\nWe shall further develop international cooperation \r\nand solidarity through the Olympic ideal. Let us invest \r\nin projects of education, culture, sports and health, \r\ninstead of spending billions on weapons. Much could \r\nbe done for the right to development of billions of \r\npeople worldwide using relatively few resources, if all \r\ncountries had the genuine political resolve to do so.\r\nFor its part, Cuba reiterates its decision to keep \r\nsharing, to the best of our ability, our principal \r\nresource, namely, the human capital created by the \r\nCuban Revolution and our best experiences.\r\nMrs. Dunlop (Brazil): Mr. President, I wish to \r\nthank you for convening today’s debate. I also thank \r\nthe Secretary-General for his report (A/67/282).\r\nThe practice of sports is deeply rooted in Brazilian \r\nculture and society. Access to sports constitutes a \r\nfundamental social right enshrined in our Constitution. \r\nThe Brazilian Government firmly believes in the \r\npotential of sport as an important factor for social \r\ninclusiveness and development. We also consider it \r\na tool for fostering role-model values concurrently \r\nwith a solid upbringing for all our children and youth. \r\nAccordingly, sport in Brazil is traditionally regarded \r\nas being instrumental in forging good standards of \r\ncitizenship, thereby playing a special role in maintaining \r\na healthy social fabric\r\nIt is therefore with the utmost satisfaction that Brazil \r\nwelcomes the imminent adoption of draft resolution \r\nA/67/L.26 on sport as a means to promote education, \r\nhealth, development and peace, which we gladly \r\nco-sponsor. That effort seems to be in close harmony \r\nwith chief initiatives and programmes undertaken \r\nby Member States and international organizations in \r\nrelation to the advancement of sport in an integrated \r\nmanner consistent with measures for equitable and \r\ninclusive social and economic development.\r\nThe Brazilian Government envisages sport as part of \r\na broader set of policy objectives that also encompasses \r\naccess to education and health. We believe that dealing \r\nwith sport in such an integrated and holistic way \r\ncontributes to creating conditions conducive to peace \r\nand development.\r\nBearing that in mind, the Brazilian Government has \r\nlaunched a series of initiatives that focus on multi-stake \r\npartnerships with representative institutions from across \r\nour civil society. For instance, we have undertaken a \r\nprogramme that employs 12,000 inmates from State \r\nprisons in manufacturing sports equipment, whose \r\noutput is used in other educational sports programmes \r\ncarried out by the Brazilian Government. In addition, \r\nthe so-called Second Half programme, which benefits \r\nmore than one million people, proposes part-time \r\nsports activities to children and youngsters enrolled \r\nin public schools. Likewise, pursuant to previous \r\nrecommendations on the subject, Brazil develops \r\ninternational sports cooperation projects in partnership \r\nwith other developing countries, such as Benin, \r\nBotswana, Kenya, Palestine, South Africa, Tanzania, \r\nUganda and Zambia. We remain engaged in increasing \r\nand expanding the scope of those programmes with \r\nother countries as well as in launching initiatives \r\nin cooperation with United Nations agencies and \r\nprogrammes.\r\nWe find ourselves at the beginning of an exciting \r\nsport-centred decade. Over the next few years, Brazil \r\nwill host three sports mega-events — the International \r\n12-61261 5\r\nA/67/PV.42\r\nFederation of Association Football (FIFA) World Cup \r\nin 2013, next year, the FIFA World Cup in 2014, and the \r\nOlympic and Paralympic Games in 2016. In the coming \r\nyears, sports will be at the top of the Brazilian social, \r\npolitical and economic agenda. We welcome all to the \r\naforementioned events in Brazil.\r\nMr. Charles (Trinidad and Tobago), Vice-President, \r\ntook the Chair.\r\nThe decision to host these mega-events is consistent \r\nwith the priority granted to the promotion of sustainable \r\ndevelopment and social inclusiveness. Hence the \r\nBrazilian Government remains committed to fostering \r\nand adopting public policies that ensure that hosting \r\nthose events will help generate more jobs, improve our \r\nnationwide infrastructure and increase opportunities \r\nfor Brazilian youth. Brazil also hopes that the mega-\r\nevents will provide an opportunity for us to share \r\nexperience in promoting sports as a means to achieve \r\nsocial inclusiveness and enhance the development of \r\npartnerships with other nations, especially developing \r\nones.\r\nMr. Ulibarri (Costa Rica) (spoke in Spanish): Baron \r\nPierre de Coubertin believed that building peace and \r\na better world required providing young people with a \r\nsports education and opportunities to get involved with \r\nsports. Thus it would be possible to create a lifestyle \r\nbased on the happiness that comes from effort, from the \r\neducational value of a good example and from respect \r\nfor the fundamental ethical principles. That legacy \r\nremains in full force, as was demonstrated by the \r\nimpeccable Olympic and Paralympic Games in London, \r\nwhere maximum effort, unity, friendship and fair and \r\nhealthy competition filled our lives to overflowing and \r\nf lourished as common values of humankind.\r\nSport plays a relevant role in the promotion of \r\nsocial development and is a means par excellence \r\nfor communication between peoples and for the \r\nmaintenance of world peace. That is why Costa Rica \r\nwelcomes the fact that the United Nations has included \r\nit on its agenda.\r\nOur country recognizes the potential of sport \r\nas a universal practice that contributes to educating \r\npeople in the values of respect, diversity and tolerance. \r\nWe also recognize the value of sport as a means to \r\ncombat all forms of discrimination. Accordingly, we \r\nmust make the necessary efforts to ensure that sport \r\nis fully included in our national development agendas. \r\nSports and physical activity must not be omitted or \r\nsidelined from the challenges that a country faces, \r\nQuite the contrary, they should be part of the process \r\nof transformation for a country’s full development. The \r\norganizing committees of major international sports \r\nevents have recognized the legacy that games can leave \r\nby raising awareness on matters such as social inclusion \r\nand human rights and by fostering opportunities to \r\ncreate and transform infrastructure with positive long-\r\nlasting effects.\r\nLast year, the General Assembly unanimously \r\nadopted resolution 66/5, entitled “Building a peaceful \r\nand better world through sport and the Olympic ideal”. \r\nEven more significant was the fact that it was the first \r\ntime in history that a resolution was co-sponsored by \r\nthe 193 States Members of the United Nations. Only \r\nsport has been able to achieve that feat.\r\nSport is more than a luxury or a form of \r\nentertainment; it is more than just winning medals. \r\nAccess to and participation in sport and in physical \r\nactivity are essential to lead a full and healthy life. \r\nMoreover, sport has also proved to be an instrument for \r\nthe most disadvantaged, for public health and for social \r\ninclusion, in particular when focused on education and \r\nprevention. It empowers minorities and enables them \r\nto have a dignified place in society, as the Paralympic \r\nmovement and streetfootballworld have accomplished.\r\nSport also has a strong impact on the global economy \r\nin the creation of employment, in the development of \r\nnew undertakings and in public investment. The United \r\nNations and other international entities, including the \r\nInternational Olympic Committee and the international \r\nsports federations, have begun to recognize, beyond elite \r\nsports, the enormous potential of widely participatory \r\nsports as a generator of social change. Athletes can be \r\na valuable instrument in promoting social stability, \r\nreconciliation and dialogue. As models for behaviour, \r\nthey can help raise awareness of matters such as \r\nparticipation, non-discrimination, gender equality and \r\nthe rights of persons with disabilities.\r\nFor the first time in its history, San José, the capital \r\nof Costa Rica, will host in February 2013 the Central \r\nAmerican Games, which were established just a few \r\nyears ago. The President of the Republic and the Mayor \r\nof San José have expressed their total commitment to \r\nthe organization of those Games, as they are an excellent \r\nopportunity to use sports to promote the values of \r\npeace, human security and social development among \r\nthe Central American family.\r\n6 12-61261\r\nA/67/PV.42\r\nIn addition to that effort, our country continues to \r\nwork shoulder to shoulder with various international \r\norganizations related to sport. Along with the Special \r\nAdviser to the Secretary-General on Sport for \r\nDevelopment and Peace, Mr. Wilfried Lemke, and with \r\nother Member States, we are promoting the initiative \r\nto organize in Geneva a group of friends of sport for \r\ndevelopment and peace to replicate the group that already \r\nexists in New York. Together with the International \r\nOlympic Committee and the National Olympic \r\nCommittee of Costa Rica, we are seeking opportunities \r\nfor cooperation using sport as an instrument of social \r\nprevention. Together with the United Nations Office on \r\nDrugs and Crime, we are promoting the organization of \r\na programme for young people at social risk. Working \r\nwith the Alianza A Ganar, we have developed a \r\nprogramme for training and employing youth through \r\nsport. With the non-governmental organization Peace \r\nand Sport, we are working to establish a regional forum \r\nfor peace and sport in Costa Rica. With regard to gender \r\nmatters, in 2011 we signed the Brighton Declaration on \r\nWomen and Sport.\r\nWe trust that the international community will \r\ncontinue on its steady path towards achieving the ideals \r\nthat were outlined by Baron de Coubertin more than \r\none hundred years ago for the benefit of humankind.\r\nMr. Stone (Australia): Australia is committed to \r\nthe principles of sport for development and peace and to \r\nthe role the United Nations can play in furthering those \r\nprinciples. We welcome the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on this subject introduced this morning \r\n(A/67/282) and would like to take this opportunity to \r\nthank the Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on \r\nSport for Development and Peace, Mr. Wilfried Lemke, \r\nfor his ongoing efforts to promote the United Nations \r\nwork in this field. We would also like to thank Monaco \r\nfor introducing draft resolution A/67/L.26, which is \r\nbefore us today. Australia is pleased to co-sponsor the \r\ndraft resolution.\r\nSport’s popularity, its capacity as a communication \r\nplatform and its ability to connect people make it a \r\ntool that can be used to meet a range of development \r\nobjectives, including contributing to the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. Australia, with a reputation as a \r\nsporting nation, is well placed to use sport as a vehicle \r\nto contribute to targeted development outcomes. The \r\nAustralian Sports Outreach Programme supports major \r\nprogrammes in seven countries and provides grants for \r\nsmaller activities in over 40 countries in Africa, the \r\nCaribbean, Asia and the Pacific.\r\nThe Australian Government’s approach to using \r\nsport to meet development objectives identifies specific \r\ndevelopment outcomes in two key areas where we \r\nbelieve we can make a real difference and deliver real \r\nresults.\r\nThe first regards reducing the risk of \r\nnon-communicable diseases (NCDs), such as heart \r\ndisease, diabetes and stroke, which place a significant \r\nburden on health systems in developing countries already \r\nstruggling to cope. They also reduce productivity and \r\nhousehold income, keeping poor people poor. Sport \r\ncan play a powerful role in addressing the risk factors \r\ncausing NCDs, including physical inactivity, unhealthy \r\ndiets and harmful tobacco and alcohol use.\r\nIn March 2012, Australia, in collaboration with \r\nthe World Health Organization and the Secretariat of \r\nthe Pacific Community, convened a Healthy Islands \r\nThrough Sport Forum in Brisbane. This regional \r\nmeeting of senior officials of Pacific ministries of health \r\nand sport aimed to facilitate ongoing collaboration and \r\nmultisectoral action to address the risk factors that \r\ncause non-communicable diseases.\r\nSecondly, the Australian Government programmes \r\nemphasize the role of sport in enhancing the lives of \r\npeople with disabilities. Sport can foster the inclusion \r\nand well-being of persons with disabilities and facilitate \r\nsocial inclusion. For instance, Australian activities \r\nhave been provided to increase community awareness \r\nabout people with disability in Fiji, where the Inspiring \r\nFijians rugby team – a combined rugby team from Fiji’s \r\nspecial schools — playing in front of large crowds \r\nand inclusive community sports festivals have helped \r\npromote more positive attitudes towards people with \r\ndisability.\r\nAustralia also has a number of programmes to \r\naddress the involvement of women and girls in sport-\r\nrelated activities. These include the sport leadership \r\ngrants for women, which provide opportunities for \r\ntraining and skills development to enable women to \r\ntake on leadership and decision-making roles in sport.\r\nAustralia recognizes the need for all parties around \r\nthe world to be vigilant in protecting the integrity of \r\nsport. Issues such as doping in sports and illegal sports \r\nbetting have great potential to undermine the ability of \r\nsport to be used as a vehicle for development.\r\n12-61261 7\r\nA/67/PV.42\r\nMr. Williams (United Kingdom): The United \r\nKingdom delegation welcomes the report of the \r\nSecretary-General on sport for development and \r\npeace (A/67/282), as well as the latest draft resolution \r\n(A/67/L.26) on sport as a means to promote education, \r\nhealth, development and peace.\r\nThe year 2012 has been special for the United \r\nKingdom, as London played host to the summer \r\nOlympic and Paralympic Games. We were proud that \r\nthe Games set many new records: sporting records \r\nand records for crowds, for television audiences and \r\nfor unbridled spirit. Throughout our Olympic and \r\nParalympic Games campaigning we hoped to ensure that \r\nthe Games would leave a lasting legacy. We were proud \r\nand grateful to see parts of that legacy — specifically \r\nthe International Inspiration sports legacy programme \r\nand General Assembly resolution 66/5 on the Olympic \r\nTruce — mentioned in the Secretary-General’s report. \r\nWe would like to share some additional information \r\nabout those actions and their follow-up.\r\nInternational Inspiration is London 2012’s \r\ninternational sports legacy programme. At the \r\nSingapore bidding event in 2005, we vowed to work \r\ntowards reaching out to young people around the \r\nworld to connect them to the inspirational power of \r\nthe Games, in order to inspire them to choose sport. \r\nSo far, International Inspiration has enriched the lives \r\nof at least 11 million children in 20 countries around \r\nthe world, through high-quality and inclusive physical \r\neducation, sport and play and is on course to reach its \r\ntarget of 12 million children by 2014.\r\nThe United Kingdom is also proud to have had \r\nthe opportunity to sponsor the 2011 resolution on the \r\nOlympic Truce. We were extremely grateful to all \r\n193 Member States for their sponsorship. The United \r\nKingdom’s aspiration has been to mobilize the Olympic \r\nTruce resolution around the world. We hope to show \r\nthat there are many aspects of the resolution that can be \r\ndeveloped to promote peace.\r\nWith that in mind, we saw an opportunity to mobilize \r\nsport and the ideals of the Olympic Truce through the \r\nconflict prevention work of our diplomatic missions. \r\nWorking in partnership with Member States, National \r\nOlympic Committees, parliamentarians and civil \r\nsociety, including faith groups and non-governmental \r\norganizations, we were able to deliver over 80 Olympic \r\nTruce activities on every continent. Examples include \r\norganizing a range of activities in collaboration with \r\nthe Northern Uganda Youth Development Centre to \r\ncelebrate the impact of peace on young people, including \r\nsporting events, a peace march and work within the \r\ncommunity; and co-hosting a football tournament and \r\nclinic bringing people together from a diverse range of \r\ncommunities in the Philippines, in order to help bridge \r\nthe gap between Christians and Muslims.\r\nHowever, none of that would have been possible \r\nwithout the participation and cooperation of many \r\ndifferent partners. We would like to give special thanks \r\nto the Secretary-General, the President of the General \r\nAssembly and Mr. Wilfried Lemke, Special Adviser to \r\nthe Secretary-General on Sport for Development and \r\nPeace, for their support for the Olympic Truce work. \r\nThe Secretary-General joined the British Foreign \r\nSecretary on the eve of the opening ceremony of the \r\n2012 London Games, on 27 July, where both recognized \r\nthe importance of the Olympic Truce.\r\nThe United Kingdom would also like to extend our \r\nwarm wishes to future Games hosts. This month, British \r\nGovernment ministers visited both Moscow and Rio for \r\nhigh-level meetings as part of my country’s Olympic \r\nhandover and commitment to a long-term legacy. We \r\nwelcome our agreements with Russia, Brazil and the \r\nInternational Olympic Committee to support promotion \r\nof the ideals of the Olympic Truce, and we remain ready \r\nand willing to continue that work into the future. We \r\nencourage all Member States to support and promote \r\nthe ideals of the Olympic Truce internationally and \r\ndomestically. Finally, we encourage all Member States \r\nto support Mr. Lemke’s mandate and his work.\r\nMr. Karev (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): \r\nThe Russian Federation highly commends the work \r\nof the United Nations in promoting international \r\nsport cooperation and contributing to enhancing \r\nmutual understanding among peoples and achieving \r\nunderstanding among civilizations. We are witnessing \r\na difficult period in international relations in terms \r\nof globalization and dealing with the consequences \r\nof the global financial and economic crisis, along \r\nwith increasing social, intercultural and international \r\nconflicts and bouts of extremism.\r\nGiven those issues, the international community \r\nmust, more than ever before, continue its efforts aimed \r\nat ensuring that sport — with its massive potential to \r\npromote unity — becomes a motor for comprehensive \r\neconomic and social development and a means for \r\nachieving solidarity, tolerance and cultural diversity.\r\n8 12-61261\r\nA/67/PV.42\r\nenvironmental protection and in creating an inclusive \r\nenvironment. We are convinced that the upcoming \r\nOlympic Games will foster further economic growth \r\nin the region and enable Sochi to become a world-\r\nclass resort and business centre. That, in turn, will \r\nensure the improvement of the living conditions of the \r\npeople throughout the entire region. The Olympic and \r\nParalympic Games will serve to further positive change \r\nin Russian society. More attention will be provided to \r\nprotecting the environment and integrating people with \r\ndisabilities into the active life of society.\r\nSport is a universal language of communication. \r\nOrganized sport competitions bring together \r\nrepresentatives from various countries, cultures and \r\nreligions, which reveals the major unifying potential of \r\nsport as an effective channel for advancing the culture \r\nof peace and dialogue among civilizations, and we \r\nshould take full advantage of that potential.\r\nMr. Ovsyanko (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): In \r\nOctober 2011, the General Assembly unanimously \r\nadopted resolution 66/5, “Building a peaceful and \r\nbetter world through sport and the Olympic ideal”, \r\nsponsored by 193 States. In adopting that resolution, \r\nthe Member States affirmed their commitment to \r\nthe Olympic ideals, one of the most important of \r\nwhich is non-discrimination. As it is set out in the \r\nOlympic Charter, any form of religious or political \r\ndiscrimination is incompatible with belonging to the \r\nOlympic Movement.\r\nThe resolution called for reconciliation during the \r\nOlympic Games through the establishment of peaceful \r\nconditions and safe travel and participation for the \r\nathletes and others taking part in the Games. In practice, \r\nthe experience of the most recent Olympiad showed \r\nthat not every State fulfilled its proper obligations as \r\nlaid down by the General Assembly and the Olympic \r\nMovement. It is regrettable to note the trend, which \r\nwas vividly apparent during the Olympic Games in \r\nLondon, of exploiting international sports events for \r\nthe purposes of putting pressure on sovereign States. \r\nSuch acts not only undermine the spirit and letter of the \r\nOlympic Charter and General Assembly resolutions, \r\nthey also devalue the principles of the Olympics and of \r\nsport as a whole.\r\nIt is also disturbing to see the trend that turned sport \r\nfrom being an expression of the great achievements \r\nand triumphant potential of the human body, will \r\nand mind to being a contest between sponsors and \r\nWe believe that sport is a powerful tool for \r\neducating young people in mutual respect, tolerance, \r\nand rejection of xenophobia. Of particular importance \r\ntoday, it can protect young people from the influence \r\nof destructive forces that provoke negative phenomena, \r\nincluding terrorism.\r\nThe Russian Federation supports the idea that \r\nsport should develop according to its own rules and \r\nindependently of the political situation. In particular, it \r\nshould not serve as a pretext for intrigues or blackmail. \r\nIn that regard, we welcome draft resolution A/67/L.26, \r\nsubmitted by Monaco and Tunisia, the chairs of the \r\nGroup of Friends of Sport for Development and Peace, \r\non sport as a means to promote education, health, \r\ndevelopment and peace. In our view, the document refers \r\nto the efforts currently under way by Member States \r\nand international entities aimed at developing sport and \r\nenhancing its contribution in addressing many serious \r\ncontemporary problems. The Russian Federation is \r\npleased to have sponsored the draft resolution. The \r\nintegration of sports ties into development efforts is an \r\nimportant priority in the Russian Federation’s foreign \r\npolicy and is constantly borne in mind by the Russian \r\nGovernment.\r\nAs is well known, the Russian city of Sochi has \r\nbeen selected as the site of the XXII Winter Olympic \r\nGames and the XI Winter Paralympic Games in \r\n2014. We consider that selection to be a very positive \r\nassessment by the international community of the \r\nachievements of Russian sport and recognition of the \r\nRussian Federation’s successful social, economic and \r\npolitical development efforts in recent years. We hope \r\nthat the Winter Olympic Games in Sochi will go down \r\nin history as one of the most innovative ever.\r\nMany of the preparation efforts are being carried \r\nout for the very first time, and whatever remains will \r\nbecome part of the legacy of the Olympic Games. One \r\nof the innovations is the close proximity of the sporting \r\nand infrastructure sites, which will facilitate movement \r\nand avoid transportation problems. We are building \r\nmodern sporting installations in Sochi, especially for \r\nthe 2014 Olympic Games, with the use of cutting-edge \r\ntechnology and construction aimed at protecting the \r\nenvironment.\r\nWe remain hopeful that the Sochi Olympic \r\nGames will set new standards for the hosting of \r\nmajor international sporting events and will help to \r\nintroduce cutting-edge technology in construction and \r\n12-61261 9\r\nA/67/PV.42\r\nCup stretches beyond the obvious tangibles such as \r\nthe stadiums, roads, airports, new equipment acquired \r\nfor the police, emergency medical services and \r\nother Government services. In South Africa we have \r\nexperienced how sport can serve as an inspiring force \r\nfor unity and peaceful change. Sport also supports local \r\neconomic development and the creation of jobs through \r\nthe numerous income-generating activities linked to \r\nits practice. Before the beginning of the World Cup, \r\nPresident Jacob Zuma initiated the 1Goal campaign, \r\nwith a view to advancing efforts towards achieving \r\neducation for all.\r\nSouth Africa views sport as an important part \r\nof education, and the campaign is part of a range of \r\nnational activities aimed at achieving universal access \r\nto education. In recognition of that initiative and South \r\nAfrica’s prioritization of education, Secretary-General \r\nBan Ki-moon invited President Zuma to be one of the 10 \r\ninaugural Member State Champions for the Education \r\nFirst Initiative, whose purpose is to provide support to \r\nthe Secretary-General in ensuring that the initiative \r\nenjoys global visibility and success.\r\nAs is clearly highlighted in the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport, South Africa’s national sport and recreation \r\nplan emphasizes the health benefits of an active nation. \r\nWithin the plan there is a special focus on youth, with \r\nthe understanding that increased physical fitness can \r\nimprove children’s resistance to some diseases and that \r\nsport can help reduce the rate of adolescent pregnancies, \r\nwhich bring with them higher risks. The programmes \r\nproposed in the plan can also be used to reduce stigma \r\nand increase the social and economic integration of \r\npeople living with HIV and AIDS.\r\nIn implementing our mass participation programme, \r\nSport and Recreation South Africa, our experience has \r\nbeen that using sport to promote peace is extremely \r\neffective in programmes at the community level, since \r\nthey directly involve those affected by conflict and \r\nsocial tension. Sport also offers a sense of normality, \r\nespecially to young people, in times of instability. As \r\nan example, the programme Peace Players International \r\nused basketball to help with the positive development \r\nof the young people of KwaZulu-Natal. Trained \r\ncoaches served as mentors, as well as educators, and \r\nused interactive games to reach children in discussing \r\nsensitive topics, such as HIV and AIDS prevention, \r\ngender roles and drugs and alcohol awareness.\r\nThe South African Department of Sport and \r\nRecreation and the German Development Bank have \r\npharmacological giants. Partial judges, doping scandals \r\nand international Olympic officials who vote using \r\ndouble standards — all of that conspires to prevent \r\nsport’s greatest achievements from working for the \r\nharmonious development of humankind and the creation \r\nof a peaceful society concerned with preserving human \r\ndignity. We are convinced that the combined efforts of \r\nthe international community, when it demonstrates the \r\nnecessary political will, are capable of putting an end to \r\nsuch negative trends.\r\nWe call for strengthening the role of the General \r\nAssembly and its leadership in the effort to develop \r\nthe international Olympic Movement, combat such \r\nnegative influences in sport and support initiatives to \r\nexpand human development through sport. We believe \r\nthat the time has come to create clear mechanisms \r\nfor cooperation between the leadership of the United \r\nNations, including the President of the General Assembly \r\nand the Secretary-General, and the International \r\nOlympic Committee, with the goal of working together \r\nto observe the Olympic Truce among Member States \r\nand enhancing international cooperation.\r\nMr. Milubi (South Africa): It is an honour and \r\nprivilege for South Africa to participate in this \r\nimportant debate on sport as a means to promote \r\neducation, health, development and peace, and we \r\nthank the Secretary-General for his latest report on \r\nsport for development and peace (A/67/282). We have \r\nnoted the tremendous initiatives and national policies \r\nand strategies that some Member States have developed \r\nto enable sport to act as a catalyst for achieving many \r\npositive aspects of development.\r\nThis debate comes just a few months after the \r\n2012 London Olympic and Paralympic Games. As the \r\nSecretary-General’s report clearly states, the London \r\nOlympics, just as other sporting events have done,\r\n“brought together diverse communities affected \r\nby conflict to participate in sporting, cultural \r\nand educational activities to promote conflict \r\nprevention and peace” (A/67/282, para. 6).\r\nWe are also meeting on the eve of the African Cup of \r\nNations soccer tournament, to be held in South Africa \r\nin January 2013. We hope it will be an opportunity \r\nto foster greater understanding and tolerance among \r\ndifferent peoples in the spirit of nurturing peace.\r\nIt is worth mentioning that the legacy of the 2010 \r\nInternational Federation of Association Football World \r\n10 12-61261\r\nA/67/PV.42\r\nbegun to roll out the South Africa Sport for Change \r\nprogramme. It showcases sport as a catalyst for change \r\nwith great potential for youth development, using sport \r\nas a medium to create positive behaviour and attitudes \r\nand to reduce the factors conducive to the social ills that \r\naff lict young people and society. Sport is an important \r\ntool for bringing people around the world together to \r\nshare their talents, regardless of race. It has the power \r\nto help get young people and others off the streets \r\nand at the same time to promote health, education, \r\ndevelopment and peace.\r\nSport has been recognized as a powerful tool \r\nthrough its contributions to the achievement of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral has said that sport has a crucial role to play in \r\nthe efforts of the United Nations to improve the lives \r\nof people around the world; it builds bridges between \r\nindividuals and across communities, providing fertile \r\nground for sowing the seeds of development and peace. \r\nIn South Africa, sport has played a crucial role in the \r\ndemise of the apartheid system and the creation of a \r\nnew society since 1994.\r\nIn conclusion, South Africa supports the adoption \r\nof the draft resolution entitled “Sport as a means to \r\npromote education, health, development and peace” \r\n(A/67/L.26) by the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Wolfe (Jamaica): It is indeed an honour for \r\nme speak on agenda item 12, “Sport for peace and \r\ndevelopment”. Jamaica has, in spite of its relatively \r\nsmall size, enjoyed a long tradition of excellence in \r\nsport, which predates the 1948 Olympics and the \r\nHelsinki Games of 1952, when our sprint relay team \r\nstruck gold. The magnificent world-class performance \r\nof our athletes in 2008, which was repeated at this year’s \r\nLondon Olympics, truly showed the power of sport \r\nto unite the world and its potential for development. \r\nThat significant achievement by our athletes takes \r\non added significance as this year marks the fiftieth \r\nanniversary of our independence. It is with that history \r\nand tradition in mind that Jamaica decided to become, \r\nonce again, a sponsor of the draft resolution on this \r\nagenda item (A/67/L.26). In that connection we have \r\nalso become a member of the Group of Friends of Sport \r\nfor Development and Peace.\r\nIn spite of the limited resources in our region and \r\nthe relatively small population groups, there is an \r\nurgent need to develop strategies throughout the region \r\nto maximize resources and ensure the greatest positive \r\nimpact among the population. Notwithstanding those \r\ncircumstances, it is critical that sport become the \r\nfocal point around which to stage our development \r\nprogramme. It has tremendous potential for all members \r\nof society, in particular the youth. It is also important \r\nto ensure that Government policies are aligned with \r\nthat objective and that the potential for the development \r\nbenefits of sports is duly recognized.\r\nSport has transcended the borders of the race tracks \r\nand indoor facilities. The reality is that it involves \r\nissues of health, tourism, social development and \r\neconomic advancement, which are of common interest \r\nto us all. More importantly, sport provides a vehicle and \r\na strategy, not only for Government but also for various \r\nother sectors of society, to systematically reduce \r\npoverty, build peace, reduce conflict and create wealth \r\nwithin communities.\r\nMuch has been done to institutionalize and \r\nformalize successful initiatives in Jamaica over the \r\nyears. To that end, sport for development has become a \r\nnational priority, as demonstrated by the urgency being \r\ngiven by the Government in finalizing the revised \r\nNational Sports Policy. The National Sports Policy for \r\nJamaica highlights the critical importance of sport in \r\nthe achievement of Jamaica’s development goals and \r\nnational growth. Sport is viewed by the Government of \r\nJamaica as a cross-cutting vehicle that will contribute \r\nto achieving national development and a healthy \r\nsociety. Sport is also considered a sustainable process \r\nthat builds leadership and supports healthy behaviour \r\nand lifestyles as well as peaceful coexistence among \r\ncommunities.\r\nWomen continue, of course, to excel in most \r\nsporting events. They are integrally involved in the \r\ndecision-making process relating to sport policies \r\nand are included in a number of executive boards and \r\ncoaching staffs. At the community level, sport has been \r\nused as a major vehicle for mobilizing residents for \r\nvarious community development programmes, and, in \r\nJamaica, sport has become an ingrained component of \r\nour daily lives.\r\nSport is included in the school curriculums in \r\nJamaica, from the elementary level to the tertiary level. \r\nThe University of the West Indies offers post-graduate \r\nprogrammes in sports medicine and other critical areas. \r\nThe University of Technology now hosts the Caribbean \r\nSchool of Sport Sciences, which offers three bachelor of \r\nscience electives, namely, coaching, sports management \r\n12-61261 11\r\nA/67/PV.42\r\nPeace, Mr. Wilfried Lemke, for bringing together \r\nand coordinating the various actors in the field of \r\nsport and development — multilateral actors such as \r\nthe United Nations entities, national Governments, \r\nnon-governmental organizations and civil society \r\norganizations. The Office on Sport for Development \r\nand Peace plays a key role in connecting people, \r\npromoting peace and mutual understanding and driving \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals through sport.\r\nAs a member of the Group of Friends for Sport \r\nfor Development and Peace, we clearly see the added \r\nvalue of the Office’s work. That is the reason why the \r\nGerman Government decided to support the Special \r\nAdviser and the United Nations Office on Sport for \r\nDevelopment and Peace. As we know, the Special \r\nAdviser covers sport in all its dimensions, from major \r\nworld sport events, such as the Olympic and Paralympic \r\ngames in London, to the grass-roots activities and \r\nnon-governmental organizations in many developing \r\ncountries. The Youth Leadership Camps developed by \r\nthe Office are, in our view, a showcase of what such \r\ncooperation between the various actors in achieving the \r\ncommon goal can look like, and it shows how important \r\nthe work of the Office and the Special Adviser is for the \r\ndevelopment of programmes as well as the coordination \r\nof the various actors. Germany is proud to be one of the \r\nhosts of the Youth Leadership Camps in 2012.\r\nWe have also been, as I said, one of the main \r\nsupporters of the Office’s activities since 2008, and \r\nour clear intention is to continue with our support in \r\nthe future. However, the predictability of funding is \r\nof utmost importance, and we would therefore like to \r\ntake the opportunity of this debate to express our full \r\nsupport for Mr. Lemke’s approach, which he outlined \r\nin the main lines of action in the report, in order to \r\nbroaden financial support for his Office. I think it is \r\nvery important that many Member States, as we have \r\nseen in today’s debate, are very much interested in this \r\ntopic and support sport. They also support the Office \r\nand the work of the Special Adviser.\r\nIn May 2013 in Berlin Germany will organize a \r\nWorld Sport Minister Conference, where we would like \r\nto welcome all Member States. I would like to encourage \r\nMember States that share the same objectives as the \r\nOffice for Sport for Development and Peace to consider \r\nbecoming a member of the Group of Friends. I am \r\nconvinced that a large and active group can contribute \r\nsignificantly to achieving our common goals.\r\nand athletic training, which focuses on physiology and \r\nphysiotherapy. Our specialist institution, the G. C. Foster \r\nCollege of Physical Education and Sport, maintains a \r\nhigh standard of excellence in a wide-ranging set of \r\nprogrammes that seek to address the gaps that now \r\nexist in sport-related professions.\r\nIt is clear that in order to maximize the potential \r\nof sport being used as a means to promote education, \r\nhealth, development and peace, there is a need to \r\nredesign the image and understanding of the term \r\n“sport”. It must address the means by which initiatives \r\ncan be implemented through the provision of the \r\nnecessary resources. That may be achieved through \r\npublic- and private-sector partnership. In realization \r\nof the important role that sport plays in society, it is \r\nalso imperative that its integrity be preserved. It is for \r\nthat reason that the Jamaica Anti-Doping Commission \r\npromotes the development and maintenance of a \r\ndope-free environment. Finally, Jamaica fully endorses \r\nthe recommendation to strengthen the work in each \r\nState in the area of sport as a vehicle for the promotion \r\nof education, development and peace and pledges to \r\nwork collaboratively with other countries in that regard.\r\nMr. Berger (Germany): The report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral entitled “Sport for development and peace: \r\nmainstreaming a versatile instrument” (A/67/282) \r\nunderlines once again the important role that sport \r\ncan play in the different areas of development and \r\npeacebuilding.\r\nSport activities bring together people from different \r\nregional, cultural and religious backgrounds and help \r\nto overcome cultural, linguistic and other barriers. \r\nSport plays a valuable role in contributing to social \r\ncohesiveness and rapprochement between cultures and \r\npeoples. Moreover, sport programmes can foster social \r\ninclusion and help overcome discrimination against, \r\nand the marginalization of, women and disabled \r\npersons. Sport can also help to promote the achievement \r\nof the internationally agreed development goals. Sport \r\nprogrammes can support social integration, especially \r\nafter periods of conflict, and such programmes can, \r\nfor example, play a major role in the rehabilitation \r\nand reintegration of child soldiers and other youths, \r\nan aspect that Germany follows closely as Chair of \r\nthe Security Council Working Group on Children and \r\nArmed Conflict.\r\nWe are grateful to the Special Adviser to the \r\nSecretary-General on Sport for Development and \r\n12 12-61261\r\nA/67/PV.42\r\nThe Sports Authority within the Culture and Sports \r\nMinistry operates multicultural sport activities in line \r\nwith the Ministry’s vision, which regards sport as an \r\nimportant cultural stimulus that minimizes differences \r\nwhile stressing commonalties. In that spirit, the Office \r\nregularly organizes activities that bring together \r\nIsraelis, Palestinians and Jordanians. Two successful \r\nprogrammes are Football 4 Peace and Ultimate Peace \r\nFrisbee.\r\nIsraeli civil society also prides itself on its sport-\r\nfor-peace accomplishments. The Twinned Peace Sport \r\nSchools programme at the Peres Center for Peace in Tel \r\nAviv is the longest-running coexistence sport project \r\nin the Middle East. Every year, it hosts sports leagues \r\nfor nearly 2,000 children from twinned communities \r\nacross Israel and the Palestinian Authority to foster \r\ncoexistence and mutual respect.\r\nThe Israeli non-governmental organization Mifalot \r\noversees more than 300 programmes that use football to \r\nfoster peace and tolerance across our region. Mifalot’s \r\nannual sporting event brings together 20,000 youths \r\nfrom Israel, the Palestinian Authority and Jordan as \r\npart of an effort to change perceptions and stereotypes. \r\nOn the heels of its remarkable success in Israel, the \r\nprogramme has expanded to Cameroon, Rwanda, Haiti \r\nand many other countries.\r\nIn Israel, Mifalot also promotes gender equality in \r\nminority communities. For example, in Bedouin villages \r\nin southern Israel, initiatives aimed at empowering \r\nyoung girls have enjoyed significant success. Maryam \r\nAbu-Ghanem, a resident of Tel Sheva, became Israel’s \r\nfirst female Bedouin sports coach this year.\r\nFinally, on behalf of my country, I would like to \r\nthank the Special Adviser on Sport, Mr. Wilfried \r\nLemke, for his continuing dedication to the noble \r\nideal of using sport to promote tolerance and mutual \r\nunderstanding. Israel continues to value the importance \r\nof sport in promoting awareness, mutual understanding \r\nand a culture of peace. As our President, Shimon Peres, \r\nonce said, “You do not wait for peace in order to use \r\nsport for peace; you can use sport to achieve peace”.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on agenda item 12.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft \r\nresolution A/67/L.26, entitled “Sports as a means to \r\npromote education, health, development and peace”.\r\nLet me finish by thanking the co-facilitators, \r\nMonaco and Tunisia, for preparing the draft resolution \r\nwe will adopt today.\r\nMrs. Davidovich (Israel): The State of Israel \r\nstrongly supports promoting sport to advance \r\neducation, health, development and peace, and we are \r\na proud sponsor of the draft resolution to be adopted \r\ntoday. My delegation appreciates the report of the \r\nSecretary-General on this important subject (A/67/282) \r\nand welcomes the new Action Plan on Sport for \r\nDevelopment and Peace proposed therein.\r\nThroughout history, sport has played a vital role \r\nin the lives of people around the world. Sport acts \r\nas a platform for engaging youth, women and people \r\nwith disabilities, promoting dialogue and coexistence \r\nand fostering development. Sport promotes universal \r\nvalues such as honour, teamwork and tolerance. It helps \r\nus transcend our differences and reminds us of our \r\ncommonalities.\r\nSport has also been a powerful tool for progress \r\nand development. It has played an important role \r\nin advancing the Millennium Development Goals, \r\nincluding the promotion of gender equality. Sport \r\nfosters empowerment and self-esteem; it provides \r\nwomen with a chance to come together, learn new \r\nskills and develop leadership abilities. Israel welcomes \r\nthe Thematic Working Group on Sport and Gender, \r\nof the Sport for Development and Peace International \r\nWorking Group, which highlights best practices and \r\ncontributes to advancing gender equality around the \r\nworld.\r\nIsrael deeply recognizes the value of sport. In \r\n2009, the Israeli Government created the Culture \r\nand Sports Ministry in order to better harness the \r\nbenefits of sport for Israeli society. In 2011, Israel, \r\ntogether with the Government of Germany, hosted the \r\nfirst international conference on “Sport as a mediator \r\nbetween Cultures”, with the support of UNESCO and \r\nother organizing partners, including Football for Peace \r\nInternational. The United Nations Special Adviser \r\non Sport for Development and Peace, Mr. Wilfried \r\nLemke, attended, as did ministers, academics, and \r\nrepresentatives of civil society and the private sector \r\nfrom around the world. It was an important platform to \r\ndevelop an understanding of how sport can contribute \r\nto education, social development, peacebuilding and \r\ncross-culture reconciliation. It was also an important \r\nopportunity to bring and devise strategies for using \r\nsport in those fields.\r\n12-61261 13\r\nA/67/PV.42\r\nentitled “Education for Democracy”. The list of \r\nsponsors is long, but let me quickly read out all of them. \r\nTheir names are worthy of being announced loudly and \r\nproudly, as if we were still at the unforgettable and \r\ngrandiose opening of the outstanding Olympic Games \r\nin Beijing and London. They are Belgium, Bulgaria, \r\nCanada, Chile, Costa Rica, the Czech Republic, \r\nDenmark, El Salvador, Estonia, Finland, Germany, \r\nGreece, Hungary, India, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, \r\nItaly, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Mexico, \r\nMoldova, Monaco, Montenegro, the Netherlands, \r\nNigeria, Norway, Peru, the Philippines, Poland, \r\nPortugal, the Republic of Korea, Romania, Serbia, \r\nSlovenia, Sweden, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkey, the \r\nUnited States of America, Uruguay and, of course, my \r\nown country, Mongolia.\r\nMongolia extends its sincere thanks to all \r\nthe sponsors for their unwavering support. I am \r\nalso grateful to China, Cuba, Egypt, Iran, South \r\nAfrica, Venezuela and other Member States for their \r\nstrong interest, active participation and substantive \r\ncontributions to disseminating and improving the draft \r\nduring consultations.\r\nAs the former Chair of the International Conference \r\nof New or Restored Democracies and as the current \r\nChair of the Community of Democracies, Mongolia \r\nhas made education for democracy the top priority \r\nduring its chairmanship. In line with that priority, \r\nwe have submitted the draft resolution on the subject \r\nand conducted numerous informal consultations with \r\nMember Governments in order to seek their views and \r\nimprove the text so that it could become a consensus \r\nresolution. All delegations that took part in those \r\nconsultations expressed their support.\r\nThe text before us is not ideal, and I know that the \r\nsponsors and other participating countries are not fully \r\nsatisfied. Nevertheless, a f lexible reading of the current \r\ntext should reveal that all concepts and interpretations \r\nwith respect to education for democracy that Members \r\nwanted to include from their perspective are present, \r\nalthough some explicit language may be missing. We \r\ntherefore consider that the text is balanced and meets \r\nthe basic needs of all countries. We have substantially \r\nscaled back our own initial ambitions in order to \r\naccommodate the interests of all.\r\nThe importance of the subject under consideration \r\nis well known. As Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has \r\nnoted, developing a culture of democracy and fostering \r\nglobal citizenship are becoming part of the most \r\nI now give the f loor to the representative of the \r\nSecretariat.\r\nMr. Nakano (Department for General Assembly \r\nand Conference Management): I should like to announce \r\nthat since the submission of the draft resolution, the \r\nfollowing countries have also become sponsors of the \r\ndraft resolution: Andorra, Argentina, the Bahamas, the \r\nPlurinational State of Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, \r\nBulgaria, Burkina Faso, Canada, China, Croatia, \r\nEgypt, Eritrea, Granada, Guinea, Haiti, Jamaica, \r\nJapan, Lithuania, Madagascar, Mongolia, Montenegro, \r\nNorway, Portugal, the Republic of Korea, the Republic \r\nof Moldova, the Russian Federation, Samoa, San \r\nMarino, Serbia, South Africa, Switzerland, Thailand, \r\nTurkey, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Viet Nam.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that the \r\nAssembly decides to adopt A/67/L.26?\r\nDraft resolution A/67/L.26 was adopted (resolution \r\n67/17).\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is \r\nthe wish of the General Assembly to conclude its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 12?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 14 (continued)\r\nIntegrated and coordinated implementation of \r\nand follow-up to the outcomes of the major \r\nUnited Nations conferences and summits in the \r\neconomic, social and related fields\r\n(a) Notes by the Secretary-General (A/67/82 \r\nand A/67/270)\r\n(b) Draft resolution (A/67/L.25)\r\nAgenda items 113 and 119\r\nFollow-up to the outcome of the Millennium Summit\r\n(a) Reports of the Secretary-General (A/67/201 \r\nand A/67/257)\r\n(b) Note by the Secretary-General (A/67/373)\r\nUnited Nations reform: measures and proposals\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Mongolia to introduce draft resolution \r\nA/67/L.25.\r\nMr. Badral (Mongolia): It is my honour to present \r\nto the General Assembly draft resolution A/67/L.25, \r\n14 12-61261\r\nA/67/PV.42\r\nThe MDGs are central to EU development \r\nefforts. The €1 billion EU MDG Initiative, designed \r\nspecifically to increase impact and boost tangible \r\nprogress on the most off-track MDG targets, has now \r\nbeen implemented. The new EU Agenda for Change \r\ndevelopment framework aims to ensure the most \r\neffective and long-lasting impact by concentrating \r\nour actions where they bring added value and can be \r\na catalyst for more sustainable and inclusive growth in \r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nSecondly, looking beyond 2015, we recognize the \r\npower that the MDG framework has had in catalysing \r\nworldwide action on development. We should build on \r\nthat achievement. A solid assessment of the current \r\nMDGs needs to be undertaken in view of the September \r\n2013 special event to follow up on efforts made towards \r\nachieving the MDGs.\r\nWe believe that the Millennium Declaration \r\n(resolution 55/2) and the set of related United Nations \r\ndocuments, as well as the outcome document of the \r\nUnited Nations Conference on Sustainable Development \r\n(resolution 66/288, annex), provide a comprehensive \r\nand ambitious foundation for the post-2015 period. \r\nThe post-2015 development agenda could build on \r\nand improve the MDG framework, modernizing it and \r\nstrengthening weak or missing issues.\r\nIn that context, without diverting efforts from the \r\nachievement of the MDGs, we would like to stress \r\nthe importance of developing SDGs — sustainable \r\ndevelopment goals — that are coherent with and \r\nintegrated into the United Nations development \r\nagenda beyond 2015, with a view to an overarching \r\nframework for the post-2015 period. They need to \r\naddress the key global challenges in the years to \r\ncome and fully encompass the three dimensions of \r\nsustainable development in a balanced and synergistic \r\nway. They should be linked to possible concrete \r\ntargets and indicators and be universal and applicable \r\nto all countries, while allowing for differentiated \r\napproaches among countries. We also consider it \r\nvery important that the upcoming process to design \r\nthe sustainable development goals be inclusive, with \r\nthe full contribution and engagement of all relevant \r\nstakeholders.\r\nImproving the current framework while keeping it \r\nsimple will be our common challenge. I think that we \r\ncan all agree that goals are useful only if limited in \r\nnumber, action-oriented and easily communicable, and \r\npressing priorities of the international community. All \r\nthat embraces education for democracy. The sponsors \r\nstrongly believe that the main outcome of the draft \r\nresolution will be to launch a focused discussion on \r\nhow to help educate our people in the culture of peace \r\nand democracy and a culture of tolerance of and respect \r\nfor different civilizations and religions, as well as in \r\nupholding the values of freedom and human rights. \r\nThe draft resolution, once adopted, will contribute to \r\nfostering global citizenship, with all Members equally \r\nplaying a proactive role and globally sharing their own \r\nnational best practices in education for democracy \r\nthrough a common platform.\r\nOn behalf of the sponsors, I ask the General \r\nAssembly to adopt the draft resolution without a vote.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the f loor to the \r\nobserver of the European Union.\r\nMr. Beviglia Zampetti (European Union): I will \r\naddress the follow-up to the outcome of the Millennium \r\nSummit, and then I will add a few words on the note by \r\nthe Secretary-General in A/67/373.\r\nWith regard to the Millennium Summit outcome, \r\nI have the honour to speak on behalf of the European \r\nUnion (EU) and its member States. The acceding \r\ncountry Croatia; the candidate countries the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Iceland \r\nand Serbia; the countries of the Stabilization and \r\nAssociation Process and potential candidates Albania \r\nand Bosnia and Herzegovina; as well as the Republic of \r\nMoldova, Georgia and Ukraine, align themselves with \r\nthis declaration.\r\nWe welcome the Secretary-General’s report \r\nentitled “Accelerating progress towards the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals: options for sustained and inclusive \r\ngrowth and issues for advancing the United Nations \r\ndevelopment agenda beyond 2015” (A/67/257) and are \r\ngrateful for the opportunity to exchange views on the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs).\r\nWe believe that our first priority must be to increase \r\nthe impact of our development cooperation in order to \r\nmake as much progress as possible on the MDGs before \r\n2015. There has been encouraging progress. However, \r\nit has varied significantly both among MDG targets and \r\namong regions. With developing countries in the lead, \r\nwe must continue our common efforts towards that end, \r\nfocusing on the MDGs that are the most off-track and \r\nthe most vulnerable.\r\n12-61261 15\r\nA/67/PV.42\r\ncomplex and multifaceted. The key is to strengthen both \r\ninternational and multi-stakeholder collaboration and \r\nto ensure a coordinated, system-wide response through \r\na health-in-all-policies approach. We believe that \r\nthat response should be delivered within the existing \r\nresources, and we consider that WHO is uniquely \r\nplaced to provide leadership on that critical challenge \r\nfor global health and development.\r\nMr. Goddard (Barbados): On behalf of the \r\n14 member States of the Caribbean Community \r\n(CARICOM), I wish to deliver this statement on agenda \r\nitem 113, “Follow-up to the outcome of the Millennium \r\nSummit”.\r\nAt the outset, the Caribbean Community expresses \r\nits appreciation for the note by the Secretary-General \r\n(A/67/373), which transmitted, in a timely manner, \r\nthe report of the Director-General of the World \r\nHealth Organization on options for strengthening and \r\nfacilitating multisectoral action for the prevention \r\nand control of non-communicable diseases through \r\neffective partnership. While the Caribbean Community \r\nnotes that the report does not emphasize the importance \r\nof regional coordination mechanisms and the efforts \r\nto address the fundamental challenges posed by \r\nnon-communicable diseases (NCDs), we are of the view \r\nthat the report is a good analysis of the experiences of \r\nusing multisectoral mechanisms to address other health \r\nissues.\r\nThe Caribbean Community strongly agrees that \r\ncoordinating mechanisms are important at all levels \r\nfor the effective implementation of national, regional \r\nand global multisectoral plans to address NCDs. In \r\nour subregion, for example, thus far two States have \r\nestablished national commissions and another has \r\ndeveloped a partners forum with a view to addressing \r\nthe incidence and prevalence of those diseases.\r\nCARICOM also avails itself of this opportunity to \r\ncommend the World Health Organization (WHO) on \r\nthe creation of the Global Non-communicable Disease \r\nNetwork, NCDnet. It recognizes that that mechanism \r\nis an excellent starting point for bringing together \r\nactors to raise awareness about, begin action towards \r\nand assist the implementation of the Global Action Plan \r\nfor the Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable \r\nDiseases.\r\nWith particular reference to the five options put \r\nforward in the report, the Caribbean Community \r\nis especially supportive of option 3, which relates \r\nif they can operationalize agreed principles and shared \r\nobjectives on the ground.\r\nLet me close my statement by saying that the \r\nEuropean Union and its member States look forward \r\nto continued and constructive discussions and dialogue \r\nwith all partners in the run-up to September 2013.\r\nI would also like to say a few words with regard to the \r\nnote by the Secretary-General in A/67/373. The EU and \r\nits member States thank the Secretary-General for the \r\nnote, which transmits the report of the Director-General \r\nof the World Health Organization (WHO) on options \r\nfor strengthening and facilitating multisectoral action \r\nfor the prevention and control of non-communicable \r\ndiseases through effective partnership.\r\nWe believe that, before being considered in the \r\nGeneral Assembly plenary in New York, those options \r\nshould be discussed further in Geneva in the context \r\nof the development of the WHO global action plan on \r\nnon-communicable diseases. In addition, that is where \r\nthe relevant public-health expertise resides.\r\nThe Director-General’s report presents six \r\nnecessary functions relating to collaboration and \r\npartnerships. However, rather than an analysis of them, \r\nwe are presented with a number of questions that have \r\na wider scope. Furthermore, those functions seem to \r\nbe based on a vertical, disease- or treatment-based \r\napproach. We think that more emphasis should be put \r\non health determinants and preventive public policy \r\nmeasures, which can be developed in consultation \r\nwith targeted stakeholders, including civil society. \r\nWe also wish to stress the need for a broader scope of \r\nresearch for public health interventions, policies and \r\ncapacities — not only research and development efforts \r\nfor specific products.\r\nHowever, we appreciate that the report addresses \r\nthe necessity of coordination. We could not agree more. \r\nWe would like to see the prevention and control of \r\nnon-communicable diseases taking a more strategic, \r\nsystemic and global approach, driven by policies \r\nacross all relevant sectors, under WHO leadership and \r\nguidance and as articulated through the global action \r\nplan to be adopted at the World Health Assembly in \r\nMay next year.\r\nFinally, we would like to acknowledge the role of \r\nthe WHO as the directing and coordinating authority \r\nfor health within the United Nations system. The \r\nchallenges posed by non-communicable diseases are \r\n16 12-61261\r\nA/67/PV.42\r\nto forming a coordinated network. We believe that \r\nthat option is both the most appropriate and the most \r\nfeasible in the short term, given the scope, scale and, \r\nmost important, the urgency of the rising prevalence \r\nof NCDs. The option presents many features necessary \r\nfor a successful partnership to promote multisectoral \r\napproaches to addressing the issue of NCDs.\r\nIn that regard, CARICOM supports the key role \r\nthat the WHO could and should play in such a global \r\npartnership as the technical lead on health. We also hold \r\nthe view, however, that the technology of partnership \r\nrequires resources, innovation and creativity in order \r\nto facilitate its effective functioning. Therefore, both \r\nresources and technical assistance would be required \r\nto ensure the effectiveness and desired impact of \r\nany partnership. Should adequate resources become \r\navailable to support the required partnership, the \r\nCaribbean Community could also consider a centralized \r\nand formalized partnership, as presented as option 5 in \r\nthe aforementioned report.\r\nThe Caribbean Community also wishes to \r\ncommend the WHO for the timely development of \r\nthe second global action plan, for 2013 to 2020, as it \r\nwill serve, along with the Political Declaration of the \r\nHigh-level Meeting of the General Assembly on the \r\nPrevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases \r\n(resolution 66/2, annex), as the principal multisectoral \r\ncompass for the global coordinating mechanism. We \r\nalso applaud the WHO for identifying and promoting \r\nthe “25 by 25” target — to reduce non-communicable \r\ndiseases by 25 per cent by 2025 — and for the extensive \r\nprocess completed to develop a global monitoring \r\nframework. The Caribbean Community looks forward \r\nto the presentation of the elements of that framework \r\nto the General Assembly in the not-too-distant future.\r\nThe Caribbean Community agrees that there \r\nis a need for multisectoral plans and policies, to be \r\ndeveloped and implemented at the national level, and \r\nfor a partnership to assist in that regard. We also share \r\nthe view that they should be tailored in keeping with \r\nnational settings as well as with political, technical \r\nand operational needs. At the same time, those efforts \r\nare to be complemented by a global partnership \r\nthat will support and enhance the development and \r\nimplementation of such policies nationally, regionally \r\nand globally.\r\nThe Caribbean Community also wishes to recall the \r\nGeneral Assembly’s request, in the previously mentioned \r\nPolitical Declaration, for a report to be submitted at its \r\nsixty-eighth session, in preparation for a comprehensive \r\nreview and assessment in 2014 of the progress achieved \r\nin the prevention and control of non-communicable \r\ndiseases. In that connection, CARICOM expresses its \r\npreference to receive the report during the sixty-eighth \r\nsession, at the end of December 2013, in order to ensure \r\nthat it contains the most current information and that \r\nthere is sufficient time for its consideration and so that \r\nit can contribute to preparations for the comprehensive \r\nreview of the progress achieved in the prevention and \r\ncontrol of NCDs.\r\nWe are aware that further discussions are required \r\non this issue. CARICOM is therefore of the view that all \r\nMember States should have the opportunity to participate \r\nin discussions to determine the scope of, and further \r\ndetails related to, the partnership. Within this context, \r\nhowever, should there be overwhelming support for \r\noption 3, the Caribbean Community would encourage \r\ninternational solidarity with respect to obtaining the \r\ninitial resources necessary for the commencement of \r\nthe process by the WHO, in collaboration with other \r\nrelevant United Nations agencies.\r\nAs we conclude, the Caribbean Community \r\nurges delegations to recall that 60 per cent of deaths \r\nworldwide — 80 per cent of which are in developing \r\ncountries — are due to non-communicable diseases. \r\nThe percentage of deaths due to NCDs is also expected \r\nto increase in some parts of the world in the near future. \r\nNCDs can therefore be seen as a critical challenge to \r\ndevelopment and to health in general. Consequently, \r\nthe Caribbean Community supports the inclusion of \r\nNCDs as one of the issues to be discussed in relation \r\nto the post-2015 development agenda in the context of \r\nglobal health challenges.\r\nMs. Saban (United States of America): We realize \r\nthat there are a number of important items being \r\ndiscussed today. Our comments will pertain only to \r\nagenda item 113 and the report of the World Health \r\nOrganization Director-General on non-communicable \r\ndiseases, transmitted in the note by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral (A/67/373).\r\nThe United States strongly believes that \r\nmultisectoral action is critical to both preventing \r\nnon-communicable diseases (NCDs) and managing \r\ntheir long-term consequences. The United States is \r\ncurrently implementing its first multisectoral national \r\nprevention strategy. The National Prevention Council, \r\n12-61261 17\r\nA/67/PV.42\r\nled by our Surgeon General, works across the United \r\nStates Government and with private and public \r\npartners to actively engage all sectors and levels of \r\nsociety in improving the health and well-being of our \r\ncommunities.\r\nThe High-level Meeting of the General Assembly \r\non the Prevention and Control of Non-communicable \r\nDiseases and associated meetings were important \r\nopportunities for Member States to consider best \r\npractices for multisectoral action and to convene and \r\ncollaborate with civil society and the private sector. \r\nEnergy and momentum to follow through on the spirit \r\nof the Political Declaration of that meeting (resolution \r\n66/2, annex) and to deliver on its major outcomes have \r\nbeen sustained through the engagement of the many \r\nstakeholders.\r\nThe Political Declaration requested that the \r\nSecretary-General, in close collaboration with the \r\nWorld Health Organization (WHO), develop options \r\nto strengthen and facilitate multisectoral action. The \r\nUnited States welcomes the report’s exploration of \r\nthose options, appropriately focused on national-level \r\naction and the leadership role of Governments in \r\npartnerships with civil society, the private sector and \r\nother stakeholders.\r\nCountry-level implementation of evidence-based, \r\ncost-effective interventions will be central to reducing \r\npremature deaths from NCDs by 25 per cent by 2025, \r\nin concert with other voluntary global targets. To reach \r\nthose targets, there is a need for greater dissemination \r\namong Member States of guidelines, best practices and \r\nlessons learned on practical, effective, sustainable and \r\nwidely applicable approaches to multisectoral action \r\nat the national level. At all levels, partnerships should \r\nserve to foster an environment conducive to public \r\nhealth and to healthy choices.\r\nThe United States fully endorses the leadership \r\nrole of the WHO, as the primary specialized United \r\nNations agency on health, in facilitating coordinated \r\naction among United Nations agencies, development \r\nbanks and other regional or international organizations. \r\nThe United States notes the various options for global \r\ncollaboration to promote and accelerate country action. \r\nWe agree with the report’s statement that a single, \r\nstand-alone partnership would not be sufficient to \r\ncover the scope and scale of NCDs. Rather, multiple \r\ninnovative partnerships, collaborations and coordinated \r\nindependent efforts are needed to address diverse \r\naspects of the challenge and engage the landscape of \r\nactors inside and outside the health sector. Additionally, \r\nf lexible options that allow for the evolution of the global \r\nresponse to NCDs should be pursued.\r\nAlong with the recently finalized global monitoring \r\nframework, the updated WHO Global Action Plan on \r\nthe Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable \r\nDiseases 2013-2020, to be adopted at the World Health \r\nAssembly in May 2013, is expected to provide guidance \r\non key activities and to help elaborate how the global \r\ncommunity can put into motion the multisectoral \r\napproaches highlighted by the Political Declaration. The \r\nWHO Action Plan will increase the impact and efficacy \r\nof existing global partnerships, alliances and results-\r\noriented collaborative arrangements. More information \r\nis needed on the proposal for an inter-agency task force \r\non NCDs, which would report to the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil, including the proposed terms of reference, \r\nfunction, role and responsibilities, and associated costs. \r\nWe would again like to stress our support for WHO as \r\nthe overall lead on NCDs, and would like to understand \r\nhow the work of that inter-agency group would be \r\nharmonized under the auspices of WHO leadership. \r\nAgain, the United States is committed to multisectoral \r\naction as an integral part of the prevention and control \r\nof non-communicable diseases, and we appreciate the \r\nreport of the Secretary-General.\r\nMr. Versegi (Australia): Australia is committed to \r\nadvancing the work on all agenda items discussed here \r\nthis morning, and we thank the Secretary-General for \r\nhis comprehensive reports and notes on those items. As \r\nthe Secretary-General’s report in document A/67/257 \r\nclearly emphasizes, a comprehensive and coherent \r\ndevelopment effort is needed if we are make further \r\nprogress towards the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs) by 2015.\r\nAustralia understands that aid is an important part \r\nof that effort, but we also know that policies to promote \r\nopen trade and market access for developing countries, \r\ninvestment and private-sector growth, as well as \r\nopportunities for the sharing of ideas and experience \r\nthrough South-South and triangular cooperation, also \r\nplay a vital role in helping to eradicate poverty and \r\nachieve sustainable growth.\r\nAs a co-chair of the MDG Advocacy Group and \r\na champion of the Secretary-General’s Education \r\nFirst initiative, Australia’s Prime Minister is seized \r\nof the importance of ensuring continued international \r\n18 12-61261\r\nA/67/PV.42\r\nnext three years. We urge Member States, the United \r\nNations and international organizations, regional \r\norganizations, civil society and the private sector to \r\nwork together to address inequalities and inequities \r\nin access to services and development opportunities. \r\nWe must do more to accelerate progress on the MDGs \r\nin conflict-affected and fragile States, and we must \r\nincrease and sustain a focus on the peacebuilding, \r\nsecurity and development needs of those countries.\r\nAnd now, in the development of the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda, we must do more to recognize \r\nthe needs of women, girls and persons with disabilities. \r\nWe would highlight the important work of UN-Women \r\nin strengthening the role of the United Nations in \r\npromoting gender equality and women’s empowerment, \r\nand the role of women in peace and security. We look \r\nforward to continuing our close engagement with \r\nUN-Women over the coming year, including as a \r\nmember of the Executive Board.\r\nAustralia is fully committed to making a strong \r\ncontribution to the formulation of the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda, but we will not deviate from our \r\nfirm resolve to help accelerate efforts towards attaining \r\nthe current MDGs over the next three years. We look \r\nforward to the special event in 2013, which will be a key \r\nopportunity for the international community to assess \r\nprogress on the MDGs and to commit to strategies and \r\nactions that will help in the final push to 2015.\r\nWe appreciate the ideas provided by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the way forward with the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda and we commend the steps already \r\nunderway to ensure a strong consultative process with \r\na wide range of stakeholders. It will be important for \r\nthe process towards the development of the post-2015 \r\nagenda to be clear and coherent, and we welcome steps \r\nto ensure that the relevant processes converge onto a \r\ncommon track.\r\nMrs. Dunlop (Brazil): I wish to thank President \r\nVuk Jeremić for convening this joint debate on the \r\nimplementation of and follow-up to the outcomes of \r\nthe major United Nations conferences and summits in \r\nthe economic and social fields and to the Millennium \r\nSummit, as well as on United Nations reform. I would \r\nalso like to thank the Secretary-General for submitting \r\nall his reports and notes, which provide very useful \r\ninputs for our debate.\r\nThe hard-won progress achieved in some of the \r\ntargets of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \r\nattention to the achievement of the current set of goals. \r\nAs an international community, we cannot afford to \r\ntake our eyes off that unfinished work while we also \r\ngive attention to the development agenda that will \r\nfollow.\r\nAs we said during the debate a year ago (see \r\nA/66/PV.72), we must take the knowledge gained from \r\nthe MDG successes in many countries and apply those \r\nlessons to support the countries and communities that \r\nstill face a long and difficult road ahead in achieving \r\nthe targets. Let us not lose sight of the fact that we have \r\ncome a long way and made considerable progress at the \r\nglobal level on several of the MDGs, but let us learn \r\nfrom that progress and harness the knowledge for the \r\nbenefit of all.\r\nFor example, important gains in primary school \r\nenrolments and improvements in the enrolment of \r\ngirls are to be celebrated, but we still have more to \r\ndo to improve enrolments and focus on the quality of \r\neducation to ensure that children are actually learning. \r\nWe commend the Secretary-General’s Education First \r\ninitiative for putting a clear focus on the need to put \r\nevery child into school and to ensure that they are able to \r\ncomplete their education with strong learning outcomes. \r\nWe must now focus on effectively implementing that \r\ninitiative effectively.\r\nCommitments on HIV prevention and treatment, as \r\nwell as on malaria, have yielded impressive results. But \r\nas important as those gains are, we cannot afford to be \r\ncomplacent on the health MDGs.\r\nAs the Executive Director of the United Nations \r\nFund for Population Activities highlighted during his \r\nvisit to Australia earlier this week, promoting women’s \r\nand girls’ rights and empowerment, including through \r\naccess to family planning, remains central to achieving \r\nthe MDGs.\r\nAs we prepare to mark World AIDS Day, we are \r\nreminded of the need to do more to reach the targets of \r\nzero new infections, zero AIDS-related deaths and zero \r\ndiscrimination by 2015. And we need to keep working \r\nto reduce the number of malaria cases, including by \r\naddressing the emergence of drug-resistant malaria \r\nin the Mekong region. That is why Australia recently \r\nconvened a major international conference on malaria \r\nin Sydney.\r\nThe MDGs provide the international community \r\nwith a clear and vital development framework for the \r\n12-61261 19\r\nA/67/PV.42\r\nin this year’s Ministerial Declaration of the Economic \r\nand Social Council.\r\nBased on our national experience and as indicated \r\nin report A/67/257, we believe that universal health \r\nsystems can play an important role as an effective \r\nsocial protection policy by ensuring access to health \r\nservices and medicine and reducing economic and \r\nsocial inequalities.\r\nAlthough limited in scope, the MDG framework \r\nrepresents a successful experience in mobilizing \r\nresources and focusing the international community’s \r\nattention on a number of key areas for human \r\ndevelopment. It has also helped to strengthen the \r\nrelevant role of the United Nations as a priority partner \r\nin development cooperation.\r\nThe unequivocal message from the United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development is that we must \r\nincorporate and place the sustainability paradigm at the \r\ncentre of our analysis when looking at the development \r\nagenda for the twenty-first century. Economic \r\ndevelopment, social inclusion and the rational use and \r\nconservation of natural resources have to be considered \r\non an equal footing and cannot be disassociated from \r\neach other.\r\nThe goals to be considered in the negotiations for \r\nthe post-2015 development agenda must build on and \r\nbe improved and enriched by the current MDGs. They \r\nshould also aim at consolidating the achievements \r\nmade under the MDGs by broadening the scope of the \r\nimplementation to integrate the three pillars, with a \r\nview to fostering sustainable development.\r\nAn inclusive, open and transparent Member \r\nState-driven process of consultations must be held in \r\norder to define which goals will be included in the post-\r\n2015 agenda, how progress will be measured and what \r\nthe means of implementation will be. We are following \r\nwith interest the initiatives of the Secretary-General to \r\nlaunch preparations for the process of defining the post-\r\n2015 agenda, especially the work of the task force led \r\nby the Department of Economic Affairs and the United \r\nNations Development Programme, and the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s High-level Panel of Eminent Persons.\r\nWe are of the view that all those initiatives must \r\nconverge in the intergovernmental process, so as to \r\nallow for the adoption of a legitimate development \r\nagenda that embraces different views and priorities, \r\nbut represents shared expectations and common \r\nis heartening, especially if we consider the difficulties \r\ncreated by the financial and economic crisis. The \r\ndecline in the number of people living in extreme \r\npoverty, the improvement in access to drinking water \r\nand in conditions for those living in slums, along with \r\nthe advances in gender equality and the empowerment \r\nof women, should encourage us to move quickly and \r\nmore decisively towards the achievement of all the \r\nMDGs and other internationally agreed development \r\ngoals in the final stretch to 2015.\r\nAs a Member State champion of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s Global Education initiative, we believe that by \r\nraising education to the highest level on the international \r\nagenda we will be contributing to progress in virtually \r\nall other items and challenges we face in the twenty-\r\nfirst century. Universal access to quality education is \r\nkey if we are to overcome poverty and inequality.\r\nThe international community has the responsibility \r\nto make good on its commitments. Although we \r\nrecognize the efforts made by some donor countries \r\nto meet their official development assistance (ODA) \r\ncommitments, we note with concern that current overall \r\nODA levels are well below half of 0.7 per cent of the \r\ngross national income of developed countries.\r\nWe must take concrete steps to revamp the \r\ndevelopment-oriented Doha Round of trade negotiations \r\nand to promote the transfer of technology and the \r\nsharing of good practices, knowledge and experiences to \r\nsupport national capacity-building, especially for those \r\nthat are lagging behind. We must also ensure access \r\nto affordable, effective, safe and quality medicine, \r\nincluding through the full use of the f lexibilities of the \r\nWorld Trade Organization Agreement on Trade-Related \r\nAspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), as \r\nrecognized in the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS \r\nAgreement and Public Health.\r\nIn facing the dire consequences of the current \r\ncrisis and struggling to make progress on our collective \r\ndevelopment goals, developing countries need policy \r\nspace and f lexibility to make use of macroeconomic \r\ntools, especially countercyclical fiscal policies and \r\nother stimulus measures. It is fundamental that we focus \r\nour economic recovery efforts on the promotion of a \r\njob-centred, socially inclusive economic model. The \r\nUnited Nations system must give particular attention to \r\nsupporting the Global Jobs Pact and to the creation and \r\nstrengthening of social protection f loors, as called for \r\n20 12-61261\r\nA/67/PV.42\r\nWith regard to non-communicable diseases (NCDs), \r\nas projected by the World Health Organization, \r\nNCD-related deaths will increase by 17 per cent over \r\nthe next decade. Three in five deaths in South-East Asia \r\nare caused by NCDs. An estimated 8 million people die \r\nof NCDs each year in the region, accounting for 22 per \r\ncent of global deaths caused by those diseases.\r\nIndonesia is grappling with the double threat of \r\ncommunicable and non-communicable diseases. We \r\nhave given priority to minimizing the common risk \r\nfactors: tobacco use, alcohol abuse, an unhealthy \r\ndiet and physical inactivity. We established in 2006 a \r\nspecial unit in the Ministry of Health with the task of \r\nstrengthening the legal framework and implementing \r\nour policy on NCDs. Indonesia also is committed \r\nto implementing the 2008-2013 Action Plan for the \r\nGlobal Strategy for the Prevention and Control of \r\nNon-communicable Diseases.\r\nThe scale and virulence of non-communicable \r\ndiseases require unprecedented political commitment \r\nat the highest political levels to address that global \r\nissue. That commitment must therefore be incorporated \r\ninto the global agenda of the international community. \r\nThe convening of the High-level Meeting of the \r\nGeneral Assembly on the Prevention and Control of \r\nNon-communicable Diseases in September last year \r\nand the adoption of the Political Declaration on NCDs \r\n(resolution 66/2, annex) highlighted that commitment. \r\nThe mobilization of resources and the building of a \r\ngenuine global partnership with civil society, private \r\nsectors, philanthropies and even influential individuals \r\nare therefore essential. We also call on the international \r\ncommunity to include progress in the fight against \r\nNCDs as a component of the post-2015 development \r\nagenda.\r\nTurning to women’s issues, Indonesia commends \r\nthe efforts that UN-Women has made in Indonesia to \r\ndate. Indonesia would like to reiterate its commitment \r\nto and support for the work of UN-Women, including \r\nits strategic plan 2011-2013. We urge UN-Women to \r\ncontinue providing appropriate and strategic support \r\nto middle-income countries, which, despite their recent \r\neconomic achievements, still face challenges in the \r\narea of gender equality and women’s empowerment.\r\nAs a member of the Executive Board of UN-\r\nWomen, Indonesia will continue its core contributions. \r\nAt the same time, efforts to identify a sustainable \r\npredictable and innovative financing path for the \r\naspirations. We need tools that provide a sense of \r\ndirection to our common efforts while preserving the \r\nnecessary f lexibility for each country to pursue its \r\nown development path. Building on the success of the \r\nMDGs, we also believe that they can provide guidance \r\nto all relevant actors within and outside the United \r\nNations system.\r\nMr. Percaya (Indonesia): In contributing to the \r\njoin debate, the delegation of Indonesia wishes to \r\nparticularly focus on agenda item 113, “Follow-up \r\nto the outcome of the Millennium Summit”. We also \r\nthank the Secretary-General for the reports before us.\r\nThe international community is committed to \r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \r\nby 2015, to addressing existing obstacles, gaps and \r\nchallenges, and to taking advantage of opportunities. \r\nIndonesia is fully committed to meeting all its MDG \r\ntargets. Indonesia recognizes that a concerted national \r\neffort is critical to ensuring the attainment of the MDG \r\ntargets at the national and global levels.\r\nThe MDGs framework, however, has been viewed as \r\nhaving certain constraints, including being too focused \r\non human development while not giving adequate \r\nattention to the need to generate general economic \r\ngrowth and development. Today, it is increasingly \r\nrecognized that countries that have not experienced \r\nsustained or inclusive growth will have difficulties in \r\nmeeting their poverty reduction targets and the other \r\nMDGs by 2015.\r\nIt is in this context that resolution 65/10 stressed \r\nthat the promotion of sustained, inclusive and equitable \r\neconomic growth is necessary for accelerating \r\nprogress towards achieving the MDGs, as well as \r\npromoting sustainable development. Greater emphasis \r\non growth will help to create more jobs and provide \r\nsocial protection aimed at protecting and empowering \r\npeople and communities, the most vulnerable groups in \r\nparticular.\r\nThe world will not stop in 2015, however. We must \r\nundertake further steps to advance the United Nations \r\ndevelopment agenda beyond 2015. Incorporating \r\nthe development concept of sustained, inclusive and \r\nequitable economic growth and development as an \r\nintegral part of a post-2015 development framework \r\ncould greatly contribute to achieving not only existing \r\ndevelopment goals, but also new goals that could be set \r\npost-2015.\r\n12-61261 21\r\nA/67/PV.42\r\n12 December, upon the initiative of President Putin, \r\nan international high-level conference on the issue of \r\ndecent work will be held in Moscow. We are convinced \r\nthat this important event will give a powerful impulse \r\nto coordinating multilateral efforts to implement \r\nthe International Labour Organization’s concepts of \r\ndecent work and sustainable development based on \r\nwide-ranging and equitable economic growth.\r\nRussia ascribes particular importance to the \r\nglobal efforts to combat non-communicable diseases \r\n(NCDs). A key role in advancing international dialogue \r\nin that area was played by the first global ministerial \r\nconference on healthy lifestyles and non-communicable \r\ndisease control held in Moscow, the High-level Meeting \r\nof the General Assembly on the Prevention and Control \r\nof Non-communicable Diseases, and the World \r\nHealth Organization (WHO) Global Strategy for the \r\nPrevention and Control of NCDs. We hope that there \r\nwill be an agreement within WHO this year on common \r\nobligations on non-communicable diseases and that a \r\nnew plan of action in that area will be drawn up for the \r\n2014-2020 period.\r\nRussia continues to step up its participation \r\nin global health. Our contribution to the WHO \r\nnon-communicable diseases project for 2012-2013 \r\nexceeds $7 million. We plan to contribute more \r\nthan $36 million to programmes to help developing \r\ncountries to combat non-communicable diseases. Our \r\nfuture plans include the opening in our country of a \r\nlocal WHO office on non-communicable diseases. We \r\nbelieve that the Russian national system being set up \r\nto monitor those diseases and related risk factors will \r\nin time become part of the global information system \r\nunder WHO auspices.\r\nWe welcome the efforts of the Secretary-General \r\nto pay consistent attention to the issue of reforming \r\nthe management mechanisms of the United Nations \r\nin order to increase their effectiveness. At the same \r\ntime, we note that reform is not an end in itself. Its \r\nimplementation should be based on close consultation \r\nwith Member States and meet their interests and those \r\nof the United Nations as a universal Organization.\r\nWe are concerned to note the conclusions of \r\nthe Board of Auditors that a number of substantive \r\nmanagement reforms currently being implemented \r\nsuffer from major shortcomings. I would refer to the \r\nintroduction of the enterprise resource planning project \r\n(Umoja), the transition to the International Public \r\nentity are vital for the long term. We look forward to \r\nthe result of the UN-Women’s comprehensive resource \r\nmobilization strategy to deepen and broaden the donor \r\nbase. We urge UN-Women to continue to improve its \r\nrole and contribution at the country level by developing \r\nits tool for the comprehensive assessment of the overall \r\ncapacity of United Nations country teams.\r\nIndonesia appreciates and supports UN-Women’s \r\nnew regional architecture initiative which is a \r\nreflection of the entity’s efforts aimed at carrying out its \r\nmandates and at making further progress in achieving \r\ngender equality and women’s empowerment. We are \r\nof the view that any proposal on regional architecture \r\nshould include an impact assessment to help strengthen \r\noperational activities at the regional and country levels.\r\nFinally, Indonesia emphasizes the importance of a \r\nstrong oversight and monitoring mechanism to sustain \r\nthe coordination of and normative and operational \r\nlinkages among all levels in order to strengthen unity \r\nwithin UN-Women.\r\nMr. Maksimychev (Russian Federation) (spoke \r\nin Russian): We thank the Secretary-General for \r\nhis informative report on the achievement of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals and recommendations \r\nfor advancing the United Nations development agenda \r\nbeyond 2015 (A/67/257).\r\nThe report stresses support for gradual and \r\ncomprehensive economic growth and job creation. The \r\nexperience of recent years shows that the consequences \r\nof the global financial and economic crisis can be \r\novercome at the lowest cost by those countries that \r\nimplement development strategies aimed at ensuring \r\nsocial equality, full and productive employment, and \r\ndignified work for all. Unemployment, as is rightly \r\npointed out by the Secretary-General, often becomes \r\na key factor in political instability and armed conflict. \r\nWe are convinced that the task of job creation and \r\nensuring decent work environments should be one of \r\nthe central elements of the global social and economic \r\nagenda for post-2015.\r\nRussia has significant practical experience in \r\ndeveloping social and employment institutions. Much \r\nhas been done in such areas as improving labour laws, \r\nregulating the labour market, reforming pension systems, \r\nand professional training and retraining, particularly \r\nfor vulnerable population groups. We are ready to share \r\nour best practices with the international community, as \r\nthey have clearly proven their effectiveness. On 11 and \r\n22 12-61261\r\nA/67/PV.42\r\ninequity remain present within its membership and \r\nvoting patterns. Yet we have to understand that global \r\ngovernance goes beyond the United Nations to other \r\ninstitutions and agencies, including the World Trade \r\nOrganization and the Bretton Woods institutions.\r\nMy delegation believes that, in addition to \r\nregional groups, a particular emphasis needs to be \r\ngiven to non-State actors that have been ever-present \r\nin development and policy dialogues. The global \r\ngovernance system should be more capable of dealing \r\nwith interconnected socioeconomic challenges, more \r\ncoherent and coordinated, and supported by institutions \r\nthat are representative, inclusive and effective.\r\nIn view of the principle of common but differentiated \r\ntreatment, Maldives believes that the multilateral \r\nframework should capture and respond to specific \r\nregional needs and demands, especially those of small \r\nvulnerable States. Smaller and poorer countries are \r\noften the most affected by global rules, yet we have \r\nthe least amount of say in their design. Regional \r\narrangements can help to provide better representation \r\nfor smaller and least developed countries, promoting \r\ngreater ownership and engagement with global policy.\r\nMaldives recognizes the universality of the United \r\nNations and reaffirms its support and commitment to \r\nthe ongoing efforts to strengthen the Assembly. In this \r\nregard, Maldives notes with satisfaction the continuing \r\ninteraction of the General Assembly with international, \r\nregional and subregional forums, including groups \r\ndealing with global matters, to achieve and promote \r\nbroader consensus. It is our hope that these interactions \r\nwill ultimately lead to identifying and addressing the \r\npresent deficiencies in global governance. It is our hope \r\nthat the leadership of the United Nations shall be able \r\nto bring inclusive and effective responses to matters \r\nof global concern. It is through strengthened global \r\ngovernance that our visions for the future, including for \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals and the post-2015 \r\nprocess, will be realized.\r\nAs a nation, Maldives has had much success in \r\nmeeting the Millennium Development Goal targets, \r\nhaving eradicated extreme poverty, achieved universal \r\nprimary education, reduced child mortality and fought \r\ndeadly diseases. We are now pioneering aggressive \r\ncampaigns for equity, sustainability and development. \r\nIt is with these existing frameworks that Maldives looks \r\nto the future — to both the framing and the eventual \r\nimplementation of the sustainable development goals.\r\nSector Accounting Standards, the global field support \r\nstrategy and human resource reform. All of those \r\nprojects suffer from the absence of a well-designed, \r\nlong-term strategy, a vision of the final outcome and a \r\ndeficit of any internal oversight.\r\nAs we know, the Secretariat is preparing a series \r\nof other proposals for significant internal reforms. \r\nWe are ready to consider proposals that we receive, \r\nin particular those that fully take into account the \r\nviews and priorities of Member States on management \r\nprocesses at the United Nations, as well as the need not \r\nto allow any interruption in its effective work.\r\nMr. Waheed (Maldives): The Republic of Maldives \r\ngives sincere thanks for the work of the Secretariat and \r\nto the Secretary-General for his reports on the follow-\r\nup to the outcome of the Millennium Summit (A/67/257) \r\nand on strengthening the institutional arrangements for \r\nsupport of gender equality and the empowerment of \r\nwomen (A/67/201).\r\nMaldives believes that the United Nations holds an \r\nunquestionable and unique position in the multilateral \r\nsystem. There is no doubt that the world has in recent \r\nyears entered a new era, with new challenges facing \r\nthe global community. Economic instability, climate \r\nchange, food and nutrition security are all issues that \r\nhave gained a new-found prominence in today’s world.\r\nIn the light of our growing interdependence, a \r\ncollective and holistic approach is required and, whether \r\nthe solution is political or socioeconomic, isolationism \r\nis no longer an option. Finding multilateral solutions \r\nto the aforementioned emerging challenges lies at the \r\nheart of global governance. The multilateral system \r\nshould be inclusive, transparent and effective. It must \r\nhave the capacity to respond and remain relevant and \r\nresponsive to emerging challenges.\r\nMaldives believes that governance institutions \r\nshould tackle global economic imbalances, promote \r\nsustained, inclusive and equitable growth, advance \r\nmultilateral trade agreements, enhance food and \r\nenergy security, provide social protection for the poor \r\nand the vulnerable, and strengthen mechanisms aimed \r\nat reducing inequalities. Effective global governance \r\nis essential for the implementation of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and the formulation and \r\nimplementation of the post-2015 development agenda.\r\nMaldives notes with concern the infrastructure \r\nof global governance. Both decentralization and \r\n12-61261 23\r\nA/67/PV.42\r\nas separate from social development, and gone are the \r\ndays when national policies could be developed outside \r\nof global prerogatives.\r\nWith the restructuring of our global governance \r\nsystems through a focus on sustained and equitable \r\nbetterment, we shall overcome the challenges we face \r\ntoday and those we will face in the future. Though the \r\nroad is long, this is a journey worth making, and the \r\nprinciples of betterment and equity will be fructified \r\non the tree of our common destiny.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe Acting President: I should like to consult \r\nmembers regarding an extension of the work of the \r\nSecond Committee. Members will recall that, at its \r\nsecond plenary meeting, on 21 September, the General \r\nAssembly approved the recommendation of the General \r\nCommittee that the Second Committee should complete \r\nits work by Friday, 30 November. However, I have \r\nbeen informed by the Chair of the Second Committee \r\nthat the Committee requests an extension of its work \r\nto Thursday, 13 December, which would facilitate \r\nreaching consensus on the draft resolutions pending \r\nbefore the Committee. May I therefore take it that the \r\nGeneral Assembly agrees to extend the work of the \r\nSecond Committee until Thursday, 13 December?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.55 p.m.\r\nAs a member of the Executive Board of UN-Women \r\nfor the upcoming term, Maldives looks forward to more \r\nefficient gender mainstreaming across United Nations \r\nentities. We also want to stress the importance of \r\naddressing women’s underrepresentation in governance \r\nstructures and political participation. Maldives believes \r\nthat the Entity’s presence in the field and coordination \r\nwith Member States must be given priority, and that \r\ncapacity and operations in the field must be increased \r\nto meet the ever-prevalent demand.\r\nAlthough the global community is faced with an \r\nera of new challenges, the United Nations has cultivated \r\na global atmosphere for enhanced development, \r\nsecurity and human rights, and these have coalesced \r\ninto tangible results for more of the world’s population \r\nthan ever before. Democracy and good governance are \r\nspreading. Commitments to reducing conflict, poverty, \r\ndiscrimination, economic isolation and economic \r\nvulnerability endure in the psyche of the larger \r\ncommunity of nations.\r\nYet the strides that have been made to bring \r\nforward the development situations of many countries \r\ncannot be allowed to be reversed. Though we face one \r\nof the worst financial crises of our time, principles \r\nof equitable globalization, with economic growth \r\nand sustained legal empowerment for vulnerable \r\npopulations, including the poor, should be promoted \r\nwhile ensuring that there is greater coherence in \r\nachieving different but interrelated goals. Gone are the \r\ndays when we could consider economic development \r\n"
