In our efforts to \r\naccelerate progress towards the MDGs, we need to \r\ntake into account the results of surveys and studies \r\nundertaken by various United Nations agencies and \r\nresearch centres. In that connection, according to a \r\nreport launched this year by the United Nations Fund \r\nfor Population Activities — State of World Population \r\n2012 — ensuring the availability of voluntary family \r\nplanning to everyone in developing countries would \r\nreduce the costs for maternal and newborn health care \r\nby $11.3 billion annually. The report also emphasizes \r\nthat family planning is more than merely an economic \r\nissue and is connected to human rights and access to \r\neducation. It also estimates that 3 million fewer babies \r\nwould die in their first year of life if 120 million more \r\nwomen had access to family planning.\r\nMy delegation also wishes to express its gratitude to \r\nthe Director-General of the World Health Organization \r\n(WHO) for the report contained in document A/67/373, \r\nwhich was prepared and submitted for consideration \r\nUnited Nations A/67/PV.43\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-seventh session\r\n43rd plenary meeting\r\nWednesday, 28 November 2012, 3 p.m.\r\nNew York\r\nOffi cial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Jeremić  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Serbia)\r\n2 12-61412\r\nA/67/PV.43\r\nunder the agenda item entitled “Follow-up to the \r\noutcome of the Millennium Summit”. That report \r\nstates that non-communicable diseases threaten the \r\npopulation and fiscal health of all nations, and that \r\ngreater action in all countries and by all stakeholders \r\ntherefore remains imperative. The outcome document of \r\nthe Rio+20 United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, entitled “The future we want” \r\n(A/CONF.216/16), also acknowledges that the global \r\nburden of non-communicable diseases constitutes one \r\nof the major challenges for development today.\r\nIt is obvious that the primary role in, and \r\nresponsibility for, responding to the challenge of \r\nnon-communicable diseases resides with national \r\nGovernments. But the complexity of the challenges \r\nposed by such diseases calls for actions of a multisectoral \r\nnature and for multi-stakeholder partnerships beyond \r\nGovernments. My delegation therefore believes \r\nthat the five models for global partnerships against \r\nnon-communicable diseases proposed in the report \r\nshould be given due consideration.\r\nThe report provides interesting examples of \r\ncross-sectoral Government engagement to reduce the \r\nrisk factors for non-communicable diseases, which \r\nare tobacco use, physical inactivity, alcohol abuse \r\nand an unhealthy diet. According to the report, a \r\nsurvey conducted by WHO in 2010 found that 86 per \r\ncent of countries have some form of partnerships or \r\ncollaborations for implementing key activities. Eighty-\r\nthree per cent of countries address tobacco use, 81 per \r\ncent address diabetes, 77 per cent address unhealthy \r\ndiet, 77 per cent address cancer and 75 per cent address \r\nphysical inactivity.\r\nIn Mongolia, particular efforts are also being made \r\nto reduce the risks of alcohol abuse, which has serious \r\nimplications for our country and the health of future \r\ngenerations. It has become one of the major factors \r\ncontributing to accidents, traffic injuries, crime, \r\nviolence and unemployment. Studies in Mongolia \r\nhave shown that alcohol abuse is also associated with \r\npoverty. Our efforts in that regard include, among \r\nothers, the nationwide promotion of public education \r\nagainst alcohol consumption and an increase in the \r\ntaxes on alcohol. In 2011, the President of Mongolia \r\nissued an appeal calling for abstention from alcohol, \r\nwhich received wide support from the Government, the \r\nprivate health sector and civil society organizations.\r\nI would like to inform this body that, last year, \r\nduring the High-level Meeting on the prevention and \r\ncontrol of non-communicable diseases, Mongolia \r\nput forward an idea for developing an international \r\nconvention on the control of alcohol consumption, \r\nsimilar to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco \r\nControl. We earnestly hope that that idea will receive \r\ndue consideration within the framework of WHO \r\nin the coming years. My Government remains fully \r\ncommitted to cooperating on that matter.\r\nWhile accelerating our efforts towards achieving \r\nall of the MDGs worldwide, we must also work on the \r\nUnited Nations development agenda beyond 2015. My \r\ndelegation highly appreciates the steps undertaken by \r\nthe Secretary-General in that regard. We believe that \r\nthe work of the United Nations System Task Team on \r\nthat topic greatly contributes to the ongoing processes \r\nof consultation at various levels. \r\nFour interconnected core dimensions proposed by \r\nthe Task Team can serve as the basis for the definition \r\nof the goals and targets of future agendas. To support \r\nthe implementation of the agenda, as the Secretary-\r\nGeneral highlighted in his report, the global partnership \r\nfor development would need to be strengthened as a \r\nresponsibility shared by all countries and involving \r\nall stakeholders through a well-defined accountability \r\nframework. We also look forward to the report of the \r\nHigh-Level Panel of Eminent Persons on the topic in \r\n2013.\r\nFurthermore, we believe that greener and more \r\nsustainable economic development should be adequately \r\nreflected in the post-2015 development agenda in order \r\nto address the widely shared need to work towards \r\na single unified global development agenda with \r\nsustainable development at its core. We also support \r\nthe observation that we should have an inclusive, \r\nopen and transparent process with multi-stakeholder \r\nparticipation through national, regional and global \r\nforums, other intergovernmental processes and special \r\nGeneral Assembly meetings on development. In that \r\nrespect, we are looking forward with great expectation \r\nto the outcome of a special event to be convened during \r\nthe sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly in \r\nSeptember 2013.\r\nOur national implementation of the MDGs has \r\nbeen evidenced by our fourth national report, which \r\nnoted that 77.9 per cent of the targets had been met, thus \r\nproviding a positive effect on the nation’s development.\r\nUnfortunately, regression has been seen in terms \r\nof some of the targets, and it is expected that some will \r\n12-61412 3\r\nA/67/PV.43\r\nnot be met if the current pace continues. Those targets \r\ninclude MDG 1, on halving poverty, and MDG 7, on \r\nensuring environmental sustainability and eliminating \r\npollution, which have become issues of concern for \r\nevery Mongolian. That calls for stepped-up national \r\naction and a greater focus on multilateral partnership. \r\nFurthermore, the implementation of our MDGs-based \r\ncomprehensive national development strategy up to \r\n2021 is expected to lay the foundation for strengthened, \r\ninclusive, equitable and sustainable development in \r\nMongolia beyond 2015.\r\nIn conclusion, may I reiterate my delegation’s strong \r\nresolve to work together with fellow Member States \r\ntowards strengthening the United Nations system, so \r\nthat it remains an effective centre for advancing the \r\ndevelopment agenda around the world in the years to \r\ncome.\r\nMr. Wangchuk (Bhutan): I shall confine my \r\ncomments to agenda item 14, entitled “Integrated and \r\ncoordinated implementation of and follow-up to the \r\noutcomes of the major United Nations conferences and \r\nsummits in the economic, social and related fields”, and \r\nthe follow-up to resolution 65/309. \r\nThe fundamental goal of every person is to lead \r\na fulfilling, meaningful and happy life is. In fact, \r\nthat is what makes us human. It was therefore fitting \r\nthat, on 19 July 2011, through the unanimous adoption \r\nof resolution 65/309, entitled “Happiness: towards a \r\nholistic approach to development”, this body resolved \r\nthat it was time to accept well-being and happiness \r\nas a fundamental and universal goal that binds all \r\nof humankind with a common vision and the quest \r\nfor a holistic, sustainable and inclusive approach to \r\ndevelopment. \r\nA few months ago, the General Assembly also \r\ndeclared 20 March as the International Day of Happiness \r\n(resolution 66/281). That day is an opportunity for \r\nhumankind to celebrate every precious component \r\nthat makes life worth living and to strive for genuine \r\nhappiness.\r\nMandated by resolution 65/309, Bhutan was \r\nhonoured to host a meeting on 2 April, at United Nations \r\nHeadquarters, on the theme “Happiness and well-being: \r\ndefining a new economic paradigm”. The meeting was a \r\ngathering of 800 extraordinary minds, including world \r\nleaders, members of academia and concerned citizens, \r\nmoved by the urgent need for change to a global path \r\nthat focuses more on human well-being and happiness.\r\nPursuant to the recommendation of that meeting, \r\nHis Majesty King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck \r\nestablished an international expert working group, \r\nmade up of 50 thought leaders of the world. They have \r\nbeen given the crucial responsibility of elaborating the \r\ndetails of the proposed new development approach in \r\nthe coming two years. Simultaneously, His Majesty the \r\nKing also appointed a national steering committee to \r\nguide and support the process. \r\nThe working group will elaborate and refi ne the four \r\nthemes, namely, well-being and happiness, ecological \r\nsustainability, fair distribution and the efficient use \r\nof resources. It will prepare a detailed report on how \r\nthe new development approach can work in practice. It \r\nwill also explore accounting and assessment systems, \r\nregulatory and financial mechanisms, and trade, \r\ngovernance and institutional arrangements. We believe \r\nthat the findings will complement and contribute to \r\nthe current efforts of the Secretary-General’s High-\r\nlevel Panel of Eminent Persons and the open working \r\ngroup on sustainable development goals and the United \r\nNations post-2015 development agenda.\r\nWe welcome with appreciation the note of the \r\nSecretary-General on the pursuit of well-being and \r\nhappiness, which is available via the website of the \r\nDepartment of Economic and Social Affairs. We \r\nare greatly encouraged by the number of initiatives \r\nundertaken by Member States and international \r\norganizations.\r\nBhutan remains fully committed to the promotion \r\nof a sustainable and progressive human civilization \r\nwithin a peaceful and secure environment. To advance \r\nthat endeavour, Bhutan is prepared to further share its \r\nexperience and modest development achievements. \r\nIn that regard, Bhutan would like to initiate a draft \r\nprocedural resolution on well-being and happiness \r\nin the plenary of the sixty-seventh session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. The draft resolution will pursue the \r\nallocation of a new agenda sub-item on the topic under \r\nsustainable development. We seek the valuable support \r\nof the Assembly in adopting a consensus resolution to \r\nbetter capture the importance of the universal goal of \r\nevery human being, namely, the pursuit of well-being \r\nand happiness.\r\nMr. Hardeep Singh Puri (India): I take the f loor to \r\nspeak on the report of the Secretary-General contained \r\nin document A/67/201. At the outset, I would like to \r\nthank the Secretary-General and to compliment him \r\n4 12-61412\r\nA/67/PV.43\r\nfor his extremely informative and well analysed report \r\non strengthening the institutional arrangements for the \r\nsupport of gender equality and the empowerment of \r\nwomen.\r\nWhen we established the edifice of the United \r\nNations Entity for Gender Equality and the \r\nEmpowerment of Women (UN-Women), last year, \r\nthrough resolution 64/289, we had envisaged it to be \r\nan ambitious, results-oriented and dynamic entity \r\nadvancing the cause of gender equality and women’s \r\nempowerment globally. Today, as we near the second \r\noperational year of UN-Women, my delegation is happy \r\nto note the significant milestones that the entity has \r\nachieved under the dynamic leadership of Ms. Bachelet, \r\nin such a short span of time.\r\nThe ways in which UN-Women has been able to \r\ninfluence policy narratives across the globe, whether on \r\nissues such as women’s rights in developing countries, \r\nservices for gender-based violence survivors in the \r\noccupied Palestinian territory, or in championing the \r\nrights of indigenous women in Ecuador, have certainly \r\nachieved small, yet significant, milestones in a brief but \r\nimportant journey.\r\nIn the South Asia region, UN-Women’s work \r\nin areas ranging from political participation and \r\nleadership, economic empowerment, ending violence \r\nagainst women and gender responsive annual budgeting \r\nhas been enabling critical factors in terms of shaping \r\nnational policy narratives.\r\nIn that regard, allow me to place on record the \r\nsincerest appreciation for UN-Women of my nodal \r\nMinistry, namely, the Ministry of Women and \r\nChild Development, for their active partnership and \r\nconstructive advice in the working group on our twelfth \r\nplan’s chapter on women’s agency and empowerment. \r\nIts agenda of making gender equality a lived reality \r\nfinds resonance in the overall policy approach of \r\nthe Government of India. That agenda has also been \r\noutlined in the twelfth five-year plan of my country.\r\nUN-Women, in partnership with the Government \r\nof India, has enabled more than half a million elected \r\nwomen representatives in five States of India to realize \r\ntheir rights and develop their leadership skills through \r\nthe Promoting Women’s Political Leadership and \r\nGovernance in India and South Asia programme. By \r\nthe end of this year, nearly 365 million Indian women \r\nwill have been empowered by the programme, which \r\nis designed to build the capacity of those women. \r\nThey are now equipped with the knowledge and skills \r\nto participate in local governance. UN-Women’s \r\nprogramme on the Dalit Women’s Livelihood \r\nAccountability Initiative has been assessed as highly \r\neffective in increasing women’s access to entitlements \r\nprovided as part of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural \r\nEmployment Guarantee Act and in securing livelihoods \r\nfor many underprivileged families.\r\nIn the field of political empowerment, in States with \r\nthe largest proportion of women in the population, such \r\nas Bihar and Orissa, UN-Women has helped women \r\ncandidates to file nominations and manage electoral \r\ncampaigns in local Panchayat elections through a \r\ncampaign assisted by civil society partners.\r\nIn terms of macropolicy partnerships within the \r\nGovernment, support from UN-Women to the Gender \r\nResponsive Budgeting initiative of the Ministry \r\nof Women and Child Development has also helped \r\nvarious ministries develop in-house expertise. Through \r\nUN-Women’s training programmes and continuous \r\ninteraction, more than 500 Government counterparts \r\nhave been trained in gender budgeting.\r\nAs we draw close to the end of the second \r\noperational year of UN-Women, my delegation is \r\nsatisfied to note the progress achieved by that entity as \r\nit scales up its operations and embarks on the pursuit \r\nof its mandate. While we are fully conscious that the \r\ntask at hand is enormous, my delegation is encouraged \r\nby the progress made in reinstating the leading role of \r\nthe United Nations in pursuing gender equality and the \r\nempowerment of women under the able leadership of \r\nMs. Michelle Bachelet.\r\nIndia is home to more than 500 million women, \r\nand we are firmly convinced that ensuring the rightful \r\nplace of women in society is not only a moral imperative \r\nbut also an essential prerequisite for achieving peace, \r\nprosperity and sustainable development.\r\nOur well-recognized success in the political \r\nempowerment of women is transforming the traditional \r\nand entrenched power dynamic in both rural and urban \r\nIndia. Women are finding their rightful place in all \r\nwalks of professional and political life, ranging from \r\nthe highest echelons of the corporate empire to the \r\nGovernment bureaucracy. They occupy the highest \r\noffices in India, including, at present, those of the \r\nSpeaker of the lower house of Parliament and the leader \r\nof the opposition and, until a few months back, the Office \r\nof the President of India. More importantly, today, \r\n12-61412 5\r\nA/67/PV.43\r\nmore than 1 million women serve on local Government \r\nbodies, where they exercise decision-making authority \r\non an almost daily basis.\r\nLet me conclude by reaffirming India’s steadfast \r\ncommitment to the global, regional and national \r\nefforts to achieve gender equality, the empowerment \r\nof women and gender mainstreaming, as outlined in \r\nthe Secretary-General’s report. We assure members \r\nthat India will not be found wanting in support and \r\ncooperation in realizing the shared vision that Member \r\nStates envisaged in the creation of UN-Women.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): In \r\naccordance with resolution 57/32, of 19 November 2002, \r\nI now call on the observer of the Inter-Parliamentary \r\nUnion.\r\nMr. Johnsson (Inter-Parliamentary Union): I take \r\nthe f loor to speak on agenda item 113, on the follow-\r\nup to the outcome of the Millennium Summit. When \r\nthe Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2) was \r\nadopted in 2000, it was greeted with great hope. An \r\nimportant highlight was, of course, the establishment \r\nof the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) as a set \r\nof commitments that all countries could realistically \r\nachieve within the span of 15 years.\r\nWith only three years left until the target date for \r\nthe implementation of the MDGs, the record is mixed. \r\nGlobally, some of the Goals appear to be on track but \r\nthe picture becomes less clear the moment we look at \r\nthe individual scorecards of most countries. With only \r\na short time left before 2015, we cannot afford to waste \r\na day. We must all collectively continue to work hard to \r\nfill significant gaps.\r\nFor several years now, the Inter-Parliamentary \r\nUnion (IPU) has helped raise awareness of the MDGs \r\namong parliamentarians. We have done that through \r\na number of debates and resolutions that provide a \r\nconsensus approach to the various Goals. We have \r\nalso achieved that by helping parliaments strengthen \r\ntheir capacities to oversee Government action, adopt \r\nenabling legislation and make budgetary decisions that \r\nare in alignment with the development priorities of \r\neach country. \r\nWhile recognizing that all of the Goals are \r\nimportant, we have chosen to focus particularly on the \r\nhealth-related Goals, that is, those on maternal and \r\nchild mortality and HIV/AIDS, which, in our view, \r\nplay a key role in removing a number of significant \r\nobstacles. In support of Goal 3, on gender equality \r\nand women’s empowerment, we continue to invest \r\nconsiderable resources in promoting the participation \r\nof women in politics. We are also working to strengthen \r\ndevelopment cooperation as a key to the realization of \r\nthe MDGs and, indeed, of the development agenda as a \r\nwhole. That can be seen, for instance, in our very active \r\nengagement within the Development Cooperation \r\nForum and, more recently, in the Busan Partnership for \r\nEffective Development Cooperation.\r\nFinally, and most critically, we have been working \r\nto evaluate some of the institutional mechanisms, such \r\nas parliamentary committees or caucuses, which may \r\nhelp parliaments organize their work around the MDGs \r\nthrough their key functions of oversight, legislation \r\nand representation. In many of those activities, we \r\nhave enjoyed a good partnership with the United \r\nNations, particularly the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme and its Millennium Campaign.\r\nWhile acceleration towards achieving the MDGs \r\nmust remain our primary obligation at this critical \r\njunction, it is also important to take stock of lessons \r\nthat we should have learned by now as the international \r\ncommunity begins to chart a new post-2015 \r\ndevelopment framework. From the IPU perspective, \r\nthe most important lesson has been that of ensuring \r\nthe early involvement of parliaments in the shaping of \r\ndevelopment goals. That is critical in order to ensure \r\nnational ownership and accountability across the board \r\nand will, eventually, also help support implementation \r\nthrough the whole legislative process. That is why \r\nwe are very pleased to see that the resolution adopted \r\nin June on interaction between the United Nations, \r\nnational parliaments and the IPU contains a clear \r\nreference to encouraging parliaments to contribute to \r\nthe design of the next generation of development goals \r\n(resolution 66/261).\r\nIn order to deliver on that call, the IPU has begun \r\nto work with parliaments to facilitate their involvement \r\nin the post-2015 development consultations now \r\nunder way, both globally and at the country level. We \r\nwelcome the Secretary-General’s High-level Panel of \r\nEminent Persons, which has already begun its work, \r\nas well as the open working group that is tasked with \r\nfocusing specifically on a new generation of sustainable \r\ndevelopment goals. Pursuant to both of those processes, \r\nwe are planning a series of consultations with \r\nparliamentarians that will, hopefully, inject a strong \r\nparliamentary perspective into the deliberations.\r\n6 12-61412\r\nA/67/PV.43\r\nAmong other things, the IPU is working with \r\nthe Millennium Campaign and other United Nations \r\npartners at the regional and the subregional levels to \r\nhelp gather the views of parliaments, with due regard \r\nfor regional particularities. Consultations have already \r\ntaken place in Africa and are under way in Asia. Another \r\nimportant building block in the process is the 128th IPU \r\nAssembly, to be held in Ecuador in March of next year \r\nand whose theme will be rethinking the development \r\nmodel in terms of well-being, rather than in terms of \r\neconomic growth alone. Again, in cooperation with \r\nour United Nations partners, we will use the Assembly \r\nin Quito to compile a survey of parliamentarians and \r\nto discuss specific aspects of the future development \r\nframework at various moments during the general \r\ndebate, as well as through a specialized workshop. \r\nMeanwhile, we are looking for practical ways to engage \r\nparliamentarians in the national consultations that are \r\nexpected to take place by the end of next March, as well \r\nas in a number of electronic consultations that are in \r\nthe pipeline at various United Nations sites. All of those \r\nefforts will culminate in next year’s joint parliamentary \r\nhearing at the United Nations, here in New York, where \r\nparliamentarians from around the world will review the \r\nconcrete proposals that are expected to emerge from \r\nthe various United Nations processes.\r\nAs with Governments, the views of parliamentarians \r\non the contents of a post-2015 development agenda \r\ncan be expected to range widely both in scope and \r\nin direction. However, some issues have already \r\narisen in our discussions, namely, the central roles of \r\ndemocracy and development cooperation. The problem \r\nof development is not only economic but also political. \r\nUnequal access to and participation in decision-making, \r\nwhich often f lows out of an unequal distribution of \r\nincomes and wealth, confrontational politics where \r\nthe winner takes all, and other such imbalances, are \r\nthe root caused of many development failures. Because \r\ndemocratic governance must underpin all areas of \r\ndevelopment policy, it must also then find expression in \r\nthe future sustainable development goals with clearly \r\ndefined indicators or objectives. We propose to come \r\nback to the General Assembly at a future date with \r\nsome suggestions as to how that can be done.\r\nEqually important, the post-2015 development \r\nframework will have to be accompanied by a clear \r\ncommitment to financing. Just as the MDGs have \r\nbeen handicapped by financing of both poor quality \r\nand insufficient quantity, the success of the future \r\nsustainable development goals will depend in part on \r\nthe formulation of a successor goal to current MDG 8, \r\non developing a global partnership for development. \r\nThe new goal, however formulated, will of course \r\nneed to reflect the current landscape of development \r\ncooperation, with its multiplicity of public and private \r\nactors and corresponding f lows.\r\nIn conclusion, the next three years will be decisive, \r\nnot only for the implementation of the current MDGs as \r\na key platform of the original Millennium Declaration \r\nbut also for the definition of a common vision of the \r\nfuture. As it became most evident at the Rio Conference \r\non Sustainable Development last June, the world \r\ncommunity is at a turning point in more ways than one, \r\nand strong leadership will be required as we approach \r\nsome very difficult decisions. The Assembly can rest \r\nassured of the support of the IPU in the journey ahead.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): In \r\naccordance with General Assembly resolution 58/83 of \r\n9 December 2003, I now call on the observer for the \r\nInternational Institute for Democracy and Electoral \r\nAssistance.\r\nMr. Tommasoli (International Institute for \r\nDemocracy and Electoral Assistance): The International \r\nInstitute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance \r\n(International IDEA) commends Mongolia for the \r\nleadership role that it has played in the promotion of \r\nthe draft resolution on education for development \r\n(A/67/L.25), and welcomes the consideration of \r\nthe draft resolution and its adoption. We strongly \r\nsupport the draft resolution’s encouragement of the \r\nintegration of education for democracy into national \r\neducation standards and the development of national \r\nand subnational programmes through both curricular \r\nand extracurricular activities. Furthermore, given the \r\nmobility of students, existing regional institutional \r\neducation frameworks and the limited harmonization \r\nof curricula, cooperation and collaboration in the field \r\nof education for democracy at the regional level should \r\nalso be strengthened.\r\nThere is solid evidence that doing so can contribute \r\nto citizens’ empowerment and their participation \r\nin political life and policymaking at all levels. Our \r\nexperience, as well as the work of many United Nations \r\nfunds, agencies and programmes, and other international \r\norganizations, shows that investing in education is \r\nimportant for both democracy and development. It \r\nis possibly the most effective way of simultaneously \r\n12-61412 7\r\nA/67/PV.43\r\ngenerating impacts on human development and the \r\nconsolidation of democratic institutions and processes.\r\nThe truth of that assertion can be seen from two \r\ndifferent and interlinked perspectives: the right to \r\neducation and the transformative power of education \r\nfor the development of democratic governance. \r\nAs regards the first perspective, any democratic \r\nconstitution enshrines and guarantees the right \r\nto education. That is a fundamental issue for the \r\nassessment of whether economic and social rights are \r\nequally guaranteed for all. For example, the state-of-\r\ndemocracy assessment methodology developed by \r\nInternational IDEA and applied by citizens groups and \r\norganizations in over 20 countries, contains a question \r\non how extensive and inclusive the right to education, \r\nincluding education in the rights and responsibilities of \r\ncitizenship, is in a given country. As witnessed by the \r\ndebates on the constitutional reforms accompanying \r\npolitical transitions, not least in the Arab region, the \r\nconstitutional dimension of the right to education is \r\none of the most important issues addressed. It has a \r\ndirect impact on an inclusive concept of citizenship, \r\nespecially in relation to gender equality.\r\nThe second perspective — the transformative power \r\nof education for democracy — is particularly important \r\nfor democracy-building and democracy assistance. In \r\nthe electoral field it has a direct impact on democratic \r\nvalues, practices and behaviours. In fact, education \r\nfor democracy is directly linked to voter education \r\nand therefore contributes to one of most visible and \r\ntraditional forms of democratic participation. But \r\nit is equally important in other areas of democracy-\r\nbuilding, like parliamentary support and political \r\nparty development. In fact, education for democracy \r\nand the consolidation of a democratic constitutional \r\nculture shape the institutions and the substance of \r\ndemocratic dialogue among political stakeholders. It \r\nshould ultimately contribute to effective legislative and \r\nexecutive action within the framework of democratic \r\naccountability.\r\nInternational IDEA, in partnership with the United \r\nNations and other international actors, has developed \r\na global training curriculum on electoral processes, \r\nknown as Building Resources for Democracy, \r\nGovernance and Elections (BRIDGE), which is widely \r\nused in political transitions for training election \r\nadministrators using adult education techniques. It is \r\nno coincidence that one of the key modules of BRIDGE \r\nfocuses on civic education, covering such areas as the \r\nrationale for citizen participation in the democratic \r\nprocesses; strategies for increasing the participation \r\nof key stakeholder groups and beneficiaries, including \r\nyouth, media, women, and people with disabilities; and \r\ntechniques for identifying the different educational \r\nneeds of all stakeholders in civic education processes \r\nby considering both community-based and school-\r\nbased civic education. That example underscores \r\nthe importance of adult education alongside formal \r\neducation for the attainment of the objectives set in the \r\nresolution that is being considered today. Education for \r\ndemocracy is, in fact, a lifelong endeavour.\r\nIn conclusion, International IDEA welcomes the \r\nrecognition by the draft resolution that education is \r\nkey to the strengthening of democratic institutions, the \r\nrealization of human rights and the achievement of all \r\ninternational goals, including the MDGs. In the MDG \r\ncontext, education is an enabler at many levels. At the \r\nsame time, education is also one of the goals of the MDG \r\nframework, with specific indicators and targets, and a \r\ncrucial factor for the consolidation and development of \r\ndemocratic institutions and the achievement of the other \r\nMDGs. International IDEA thinks that the interlinkages \r\nbetween education, democratic institutions and the \r\nMDGs should be further stressed in the ongoing policy \r\ndebates regarding the post-2015 development agenda.\r\nInternational IDEA stands committed to \r\nstrengthening its partnership with the United Nations \r\nto promote education for democracy.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nGeneral Assembly will now proceed to consider \r\ndraft resolution A/67/L.25, entitled “Education for \r\ndemocracy”.\r\nI now give the f loor to the representative of the \r\nSecretariat.\r\nMr. Nakano (Department for General Assembly \r\nand Conference Management): In connection with \r\ndraft resolution A/67/L.25, entitled “Education for \r\ndemocracy”, I wish to put on record the following \r\nstatement of financial implications on behalf of the \r\nSecretary-General, in accordance with rule 153 of the \r\nrules of procedure of the General Assembly.\r\nIn paragraphs 7 and 9 of the draft resolution, the \r\nGeneral Assembly would invite the United Nations \r\nSpecial Rapporteur on the right to education to \r\nseek, in close cooperation with Member States, the \r\nviews of Governments, United Nations agencies \r\n8 12-61412\r\nA/67/PV.43\r\nI give the f loor to the representative of the \r\nSecretariat.\r\nMr. Nakano (Department for General Assembly \r\nand Conference Management): I should like to announce \r\nthat, since the submission of the draft resolution and \r\nin addition to those delegations listed in document \r\nA/67/L.25, the following countries have also become \r\nsponsors of the draft resolution: Austria, Belgium, \r\nCosta Rica, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, \r\nEstonia, France, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Latvia, \r\nMexico, Monaco, Montenegro, Nigeria, Norway, Peru, \r\nthe Republic of Korea, the Republic of Moldova, San \r\nMarino, Serbia, Slovenia, Thailand, Tunisia and Turkey.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): May \r\nI take it that the Assembly decides to adopt draft \r\nresolution A/67/L.25?\r\nDraft resolution A/67/L.25 was adopted (resolution \r\n67/18).\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): \r\nThe Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its \r\nconsideration of agenda items 14, 113 and 119.\r\nThe meeting rose at 3.55 p.m.\r\nand programmes, civil society and other relevant \r\nUnited Nations mandate holders, in order to consider \r\nincluding, in his next report to the General Assembly \r\nat its sixty-ninth session, an update on Member States’ \r\nefforts in the field of education for democracy; and \r\ninvite Governments, agencies and organizations of \r\nthe United Nations system, and intergovernmental \r\nand non-governmental organizations, to intensify \r\ntheir efforts to promote education for democracy; \r\nand request the Secretary-General, within existing \r\nreporting obligations, to report to the General Assembly \r\nat its sixty-ninth session on the implementation of the \r\npresent resolution.\r\nThe request for documentation contained in \r\nparagraphs 7 and 9 will constitute an addition to the \r\ndocumentation workload of the Department for General \r\nAssembly and Conference Management corresponding \r\nto an estimated amount of $113,200, which would be \r\nincluded in the proposed programme budget for the \r\nbiennium 2014-2015. Hence the adoption of the draft \r\nresolution contained in document A/67/L.25 would \r\nnot entail any additional appropriation under the \r\nprogramme budget for the biennium 2012-2013.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now take a decision on draft resolution \r\nA/67/L.25.\r\n"
