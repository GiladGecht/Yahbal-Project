The reports \r\nare contained in documents in documents A/67/401 \r\nthrough A/67/419. \r\nIn response to the General Assembly’s appeal, the \r\nFirst Committee continued to fully utilize its existing \r\nresources and was able to conclude its work at the \r\ncurrent session in four weeks, in full accordance with \r\nthe planned completion date, with 22 formal meetings. \r\nThe work of the Committee at the present session \r\ncould be characterized as very efficient, procedurally \r\nsmooth and substantively constructive, especially \r\nin the light of the ongoing efforts of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and Member States to re-energize the process \r\nof disarmament in multilateral forums. \r\nAs the Assembly knows, the work of the First \r\nCommittee, as well as that of the other Main Committees, \r\nwas negatively affected by Hurricane Sandy, which \r\nseverely limited the time available to delegations during \r\nthe second stage of the Committee’s work, that is, the \r\nthematic debate. Despite those difficulties and owing \r\nto the great leadership of the Chair, Ambassador Desra \r\nPercaya of Indonesia, and to the full cooperation of all \r\ndelegates, the Committee was successful in finishing \r\nits work on time. It is worth noting that in that time \r\nof distress, on the initiative of the Chair, the First \r\nCommittee arrived collectively at the so-called Sandy \r\nformula, whereby delegations took the f loor for short \r\ninterventions, while their full statements were placed \r\non the First Committee web portal. The application of \r\nthat formula contributed to the spirit of congeniality and \r\nenabled the Committee to complete its work as planned.\r\nThe First Committee had before it 53 draft \r\nresolutions and six decisions under various disarmament \r\nand related international security agenda items for \r\nits consideration. Of 59 adopted draft resolutions and \r\ndecisions, 34, or 57 per cent, were adopted without a \r\nvote. This year the nuclear issues were again at centre \r\nstage of the general debate in the First Committee. Of \r\n59 adopted draft resolutions and decisions, 21 were \r\non nuclear issues and four on other weapons of mass \r\ndestruction. The draft resolutions on The Hague Code \r\nof Conduct against Ballistic Missile Proliferation, the \r\nComprehensive Test-Ban Treaty and the fissile material \r\ncut-off treaty were adopted with overwhelming support \r\nfrom Member States.\r\nUnited Nations A/67/PV.48\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-seventh session\r\n48th plenary meeting\r\nMonday, 3 December 2012, 10 a.m.\r\nNew York\r\nOffi cial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Jeremić  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Serbia)\r\n2 12-62440\r\nA/67/PV.48\r\nVisible progress in the area of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction in general and on nuclear weapons in \r\nparticular did not obscure the importance of such \r\nvital disarmament and international security issues \r\nas small arms and light weapons, the universalization \r\nof existing legal instruments or on the role assigned \r\nto multilateralism in disarmament. On the contrary, \r\ndraft resolutions on various aspects of small arms and \r\nlight weapons enjoyed increased support from Member \r\nStates. \r\nThe overwhelming majority of delegations \r\nexpressed their deep concern at the failure of the \r\ninternational community to adopt the arms trade treaty \r\nin July 2012. On the other hand, the success of the \r\nsecond Review Conference on the Small Arms and \r\nLight Weapons Programme of Action gave us hope \r\nthat the good momentum in the area of conventional \r\nweapons could contribute in the future to consensus on \r\nthat important aspect of disarmament.\r\nThe overall tone and results-oriented approach \r\nwere clearly evident during the thematic discussion \r\nstage. Panel discussions and interactive dialogues, with \r\nthe participation of the high-level officials of major \r\ninternational disarmament bodies — the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency, the Preparatory Commission \r\nfor the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban-Treaty \r\nOrganization, the Organization for the Prohibition of \r\nChemical Weapons, the Conference on Disarmament, \r\nthe Disarmament Commission and others — explored \r\nthe conceptual as well as the practical aspects of \r\nnational and international security.\r\nAnother contributing factor was the sustained \r\nsupport of civil society for greater progress on a wide \r\nrange of disarmament issues. Although the Committee \r\nwas unable to hear statements from the representatives of \r\ncivil society due to Hurricane Sandy, their contribution \r\nto disarmament was hailed by many delegations. Many \r\nside events were appreciated, and the daily documents \r\nproduced by Reaching Critical Will were widely read.\r\nThe First Committee was assigned 20 agenda items \r\nfor the current session. In the course of the general debate, \r\nmore than one hundred delegations, including observers \r\nand representatives of international organizations, \r\nmade statements. Among those, seven spoke on behalf \r\nof various groups. About 150 short statements were \r\nmade within the framework of thematic discussions, \r\nbased on the Sandy formula. Both those numbers are \r\nunprecedented. The large number of statements in the \r\nthematic discussions again demonstrated the relevance \r\nof the Committee as an annual venue for deliberations. \r\nMany speakers who spoke in the general and \r\nthematic debates expressed concern with respect to the \r\ncontinuing impasse at the Conference on Disarmament. \r\nBy adopting a number of decisions and resolutions, the \r\nCommittee was able to point to possible ways out of the \r\ncurrent deadlock.\r\nTo conclude, I would like to pay a well-deserved \r\ntribute to all delegations for their active participation \r\nin the work of the Committee and their spirit of \r\ncooperation in the common search for a better, safer \r\nand more stable world. I should like to express special \r\ngratitude to the Chair of the First Committee, Mr. Desra \r\nPercaya of Indonesia, who, with his vast experience \r\nin disarmament and international security matters, \r\nskilfully led the proceedings of the Committee with \r\nvision and great leadership.\r\nLet me also, on behalf of the Committee and \r\nmy own behalf, extend our sincere gratitude to the \r\nCommittee’s Vice-Chairs, Mr. Salim Mohamed Salim \r\nof Kenya, Mr. Dovydas Špokauskas of Lithuania \r\nand Mr. Alexis Aquino of Peru, for their valuable \r\ncontribution to its work. I also wish to express my \r\nappreciation to Ms. Angela Kane, High Representative \r\nfor Disarmament Affairs, and to Mr. Jean-Jacques \r\nGraisse, Acting Head of the Department for General \r\nAssembly and Conference Management, for their \r\nleadership and contribution, as well as to the Secretariat \r\nstaff that assisted the Committee.\r\nFinally, special thanks go to the Secretary of the First \r\nCommittee, Mr. Sergei Cherniavsky, whose invaluable \r\ninstitutional experience and encyclopedic knowledge \r\nof disarmament issues made a significant contribution \r\nto the successful outcome of the Committee’s work. \r\nSince it was the Committee’s last session before his \r\nretirement, I would like to wish him success in all his \r\nfuture endeavours. On a very personal note, I can say I \r\nhave been around in the First Committee for many, many \r\nyears, and I would like to thank Sergei Cherniavsky for \r\nalways being forthcoming and service-minded, giving \r\nus good advice. It has been a great pleasure to work \r\nwith him through all these years, and I really appreciate \r\nhis contribution to the First Committee. I wish him all \r\nthe best for the future.\r\nI should also like to express my gratitude to Ms. Sonia \r\nElliott, to Ms. Jullyette Ukabiala and to Mr. Ioan \r\nTudor, Special Assistant to the High Representative \r\n12-62440 3\r\nA/67/PV.48\r\nfor Disarmament Affairs, as well as to other officers \r\nof the Secretariat for their valuable assistance to the \r\nCommittee. Again speaking personally, I highly \r\nappreciated their contributions and their hard work.\r\nWith those remarks, I present the reports of the \r\nFirst Committee, as contained in documents A/67/401 \r\nthrough A/67/419, to the General Assembly for its \r\nconsideration and adoption.\r\nThe Acting President: I thank the Rapporteur of \r\nthe First Committee.\r\nIf there is no proposal under rule 66 of the rules \r\nof procedure, I shall take it that the General Assembly \r\ndecides not to discuss the reports of the First Committee \r\nwhich are before the Assembly today.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: Statements will therefore \r\nbe limited to explanations of vote. The positions of \r\ndelegations regarding the recommendations of the First \r\nCommittee have been made clear in the Committee and \r\nare reflected in the relevant official records.\r\nMay I remind members that, in accordance with \r\nGeneral Assembly decision 34/401,\r\n“a delegation should, as far as possible, explain its \r\nvote only once, that is, either in the Committee or \r\nin plenary meeting, unless that delegation’s vote \r\nin plenary meeting is different from its vote in the \r\nCommittee”,\r\nand that explanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes \r\nand should be made by delegations from their seats.\r\nBefore we begin to take action on the \r\nrecommendations contained in the reports of the First \r\nCommittee, I should like to advise representatives that \r\nwe are going to proceed to take decisions in the same \r\nmanner as was done in the Committee, unless notified \r\notherwise in advance. That means that where separate \r\nor recorded votes were taken, we will do the same. I \r\nalso hope that we may proceed to adopt without a vote \r\nthose recommendations that were adopted without a \r\nvote in the First Committee. \r\nBefore proceeding further, I would like to draw \r\nthe attention of members to a note by the Secretariat, \r\nin English only, entitled “Situation reports of the First \r\nCommittee on agenda items 86 to 102, 116 and 131”, \r\nwhich has been circulated as document A/C.1/67/INF/3. \r\nThe note has been distributed desk to desk in the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall as a reference guide for action \r\non draft resolutions and decisions recommended by \r\nthe First Committee in its reports. In that connection, \r\nmembers will find, in the second column of the note, \r\nthe numbers of the draft resolutions and decisions of \r\nthe First Committee, with the corresponding numbers \r\nof the reports for action in the plenary in the fourth \r\ncolumn of the same note. \r\nFurthermore, members are reminded that \r\nadditional sponsors are no longer accepted, now that \r\ndraft resolutions and decisions have been adopted by \r\nthe Committee. Any clarification about sponsorship \r\nin the Committee reports should be addressed to the \r\nSecretary of the Committee.\r\nAgenda item 86\r\nReduction of military budgets\r\nReport of the First Committee (A/67/401)\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that the \r\nAssembly wishes to take note of the report of the First \r\nCommittee contained in document A/67/401? \r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is \r\nthe wish of the General Assembly to conclude its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 86?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 87\r\nAfrican Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty\r\nReport of the First Committee (A/67/402)\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly has before it \r\na draft resolution recommended by the First Committee \r\nin paragraph 7 of its report. We will now take a decision \r\non the draft resolution. The First Committee adopted \r\nthe draft resolution without a vote. May I consider that \r\nthe Assembly wishes to do the same? \r\nThe draft resolution was adopted (resolution 67/26). \r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is \r\nthe wish of the General Assembly to conclude its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 87? \r\nIt was so decided. \r\n4 12-62440\r\nA/67/PV.48\r\nAgenda item 88\r\nMaintenance of international security — \r\ngood-neighbourliness, stability and development \r\nin South-Eastern Europe\r\nReport of the First Committee (A/67/403)\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly has before it \r\na draft decision recommended by the First Committee \r\nin paragraph 7 of its report.

We will now take action \r\non the draft resolution. The First Committee adopted it \r\nwithout a vote. May I take it that the Assembly wishes \r\nto do the same? \r\nThe draft resolution was adopted (resolution 67/28).\r\nThe Acting President: I give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Israel in explanation of vote on the \r\nresolution just adopted.\r\nMr. Yanouka (Israel): Israel once again joined the \r\nconsensus on the resolution entitled “Establishment of \r\na nuclear-weapon-free zone in the region of the Middle \r\nEast”, resolution 67/28, notwithstanding our ongoing \r\nsubstantive reservations regarding certain elements \r\ncontained in it. They include the reference to the \r\nnon-consensual resolution of the General Conference \r\nof the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) \r\nentitled “Applications of IAEA safeguards in the Middle \r\nEast”. We did so because Israel remains committed to a \r\nvision of the Middle East developing eventually into a \r\nzone free of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons, \r\nas well as of ballistic missiles. \r\nNonetheless, Israel has always maintained that \r\nthe issue at hand, like all other such regional security-\r\nrelated issues, can be realistically addressed only within \r\nthe regional context. Israel’s perspective and policy \r\nin the field of regional security and arms control has \r\nalways been a pragmatic and realistic approach. It is \r\nrooted in its belief that all security concerns of regional \r\nmembers should be taken into account and addressed \r\nwithin the regional context. \r\nThe disturbing realities in the Middle East \r\nmandate a practical, step-by-step approach, bearing \r\nin mind the goal of achieving peaceful resolutions \r\nand reconciliation among all the States of the region. \r\nThat process is inherently an incremental one. It can \r\nrealistically begin only with modest arrangements for \r\nconfidence- and security-building measures in order to \r\nbuild the stable infrastructure and the necessary trust \r\nfor more ambitious cooperative security undertakings.\r\nAt present, no regional dialogue exists in the \r\nMiddle East, nor is there a forum in which to develop \r\nconfidence-building measures and defuse tensions. The \r\ncountries of the Middle East have no regional forum \r\nin which they can directly communicate with each \r\nother and have dialogue on core issues that affect their \r\nsecurity. At the beginning of the 1990s, the arms control \r\nand regional security talks were the appropriate forum \r\nto promote confidence and address security issues and \r\nchallenges in the area. Such a mechanism is lacking \r\n12-62440 5\r\nA/67/PV.48\r\ntoday in that there is no channel for direct discussion \r\nbetween the States in the Middle East. \r\nNo majority vote or one-sided resolution in \r\ninternational forums can be a substitute for a broad \r\nregional dialogue and cooperation. Our vision of what \r\nwe can do in the space between aspiration and reality \r\nbegins with the need to establish confidence-building \r\nmeasures and genuine efforts to reduce tensions in the \r\narea with our neighbours through greater dialogue.\r\nThe region of the Middle East is undergoing historic \r\nand signifi cant transformational changes. The current \r\nturmoil in the Arab world gives a clear example of how \r\nfragile and unstable the region is today. Unfortunately, \r\nIsrael does not enjoy peace with the region as a whole, \r\nand at times we feel that our existence and survival \r\nare put into question. Countries in the area, like Iran, \r\nthat threaten to wipe Israel off the map and terrorist \r\norganizations, like Hamas and Hizbullah, that do not \r\naccept Israel’s right to exist and continuously engage \r\nin the massive acquisition of rockets and missiles \r\nstill pose fundamental security threats. Any regional \r\nsecurity dialogue has to focus on actual threats, like \r\nrockets and missiles, which are a vital component of \r\nany regional disarmament. \r\nDespite the current situation, Israel positively \r\nengaged, in July 2011, in the European Union (EU) \r\nseminar convened in Brussels entitled “Promoting \r\nconfidence-building in support of a process aimed at \r\nestablishing a zone free of weapons of mass destruction \r\nand means of delivery in the Middle East”. Israel \r\nis planning to participate in the second EU seminar, \r\nwhich will convene in Brussels next week. Israel also \r\nparticipated in the IAEA Director General’s forum in \r\nNovember 2011, in which participants from the Middle \r\nEast and other interested parties could learn from the \r\nexperience of other regions, including with regard to \r\nconfidence-building relevant to the establishment \r\nof a nuclear-weapon-free zone. That stems from our \r\nunderstanding that only direct dialogue between the \r\nparties could move us to a more stable architecture of \r\nregional security. \r\nIt has been Israel’s long-standing position that \r\nthe essential preconditions for the establishment of \r\nthe Middle East as a mutually verifiable zone free of \r\nweapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems \r\nare comprehensive and durable regional peace and \r\nfull compliance by all regional States with their arms \r\ncontrol, disarmament and non-proliferation obligations. \r\nIn that context, it should be recalled that in the \r\nMiddle East, unlike other regions in the world where \r\nnuclear-weapon-free zones have been established, there \r\nare continuing threats against the very existence of one \r\nState, namely, Israel. Those threats are significantly \r\nexacerbated by the irresponsible behaviour of certain \r\nStates, in the region and beyond, and concern the export \r\nof materials, technologies and know-how related to \r\nweapons of mass destruction and the very substantive \r\ndiscrepancies between States’ non-proliferation \r\ncommitments and their actual behaviour. The \r\ninternational community should not overlook the \r\nfact that four of the five widely acknowledged cases \r\nof gross non-compliance with the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons involved Middle \r\nEastern States, while the country concerned in the \r\nfifth case, namely, the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea, is deeply involved in nuclear proliferation to \r\nthe Middle East. \r\nIsrael sincerely hopes that the future will yield \r\na more stable and secure Middle East, where an \r\nenvironment of peace and reconciliation prevails. In \r\nthat context, we hope that the positive implications of \r\nthe democratization process that have been budding \r\nin the region may offer an opportunity for a better \r\natmosphere, one which could be conducive to building \r\ntrust and confidence among the regional parties. \r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is \r\nthe wish of the General Assembly to conclude its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 90?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 91\r\nConclusion of effective international arrangements \r\nto assure non-nuclear-weapon States against the use \r\nor threat of use of nuclear weapons\r\nReport of the First Committee (A/67/406)\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly has before it \r\na draft resolution recommended by the First Committee \r\nin paragraph 7 of its report.

It is our view that the unequivocal undertaking \r\nof nuclear disarmament made during the 2000 NPT \r\nReview Conference lays the foundation for a process \r\nthat would reduce the threat posed by nuclear weapons, \r\nde-emphasize their importance and lead to their \r\nelimination. \r\nWhile South Africa therefore fully supports the \r\nbroad thrust of resolution 67/60, we abstained on it due \r\nto our belief that the concrete nuclear disarmament steps \r\nmust still be undertaken by the nuclear-weapon States \r\nand those that maintain nuclear-weapon arsenals pending \r\nthe conclusion of a universal, non-discriminatory, \r\nlegally binding agreement banning the production, use, \r\nstockpiling and development of nuclear weapons and \r\nthat should contain clearly defined benchmarks and \r\ntimelines for their complete elimination. \r\nAs such, the steps I have mentioned still to be \r\nundertaken by the nuclear-weapon States are distinct \r\nand separate from a future legally binding multilateral \r\nlegal instrument on the elimination of nuclear weapons \r\nyet to be negotiated. In that regard, one preambular \r\nparagraph and two operative paragraphs in resolution \r\n67/60, dealing with the framework of time relating \r\nto a phased programme for the complete elimination \r\nof nuclear weapons, unfortunately contradict South \r\nAfrica’s position on this specific issue. \r\nIt is for that reason that my delegation abstained in \r\nthe voting on resolution 67/60.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is the \r\nwish of the General Assembly to conclude this stage of \r\nits consideration of agenda item 94?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 95\r\nReview and implementation of the Concluding \r\nDocument of the Twelfth Special Session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nReport of the First Committee (A/67/410)\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly has before \r\nit eight draft resolutions recommended by the First \r\nCommittee in paragraph 24 of its report.\r\nThe General Assembly will now take a decision \r\non draft resolutions I to VIII, one by one.

While the Islamic Republic of Iran \r\nand all Arab countries announced their intention \r\nto participate in the conference, the United States \r\nclaims that “the States in the region have not reached \r\nagreement on acceptable conditions for a conference”. \r\nBut the truth is that the Israeli regime was the only \r\nparty that refused to participate in the conference, a fact \r\nthat even the United States itself could not cover up. In \r\nits statement, the United States said that it “would not \r\nsupport a conference in which any regional State would \r\nbe subject to pressure or isolation”. \r\nIn fact, to avoid such isolation, the United States, \r\nunder the pretext of “appropriate guidelines on security \r\nissues in the Middle East which provide the necessary \r\nassurances that a State can attend the conference”, \r\nironically conveys the preconditions of the Israeli \r\nregime for participation in the 2012 conference. \r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran strongly rejects any \r\nprecondition whatsoever and by whomsoever regarding \r\nthat conference, including for participation therein, and \r\nit stresses that there should be strong pressure on that \r\nregime to participate in the conference without any \r\npreconditions. \r\nWe fully associate ourselves with the statement \r\nissued recently by the Non-Aligned Movement on the \r\n2012 conference on the establishment of a Middle East \r\nzone free of nuclear weapons and all other weapons \r\nof mass destruction, in which the Movement strongly \r\nrejected the alleged impediments presented by the \r\nDraft resolution VI was adopted (resolution 67/68).\r\nThe Acting President: Draft resolution VII is \r\nentitled “United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and \r\nDisarmament in Africa”. The First Committee adopted \r\nit without a vote. May I take it that the Assembly wishes \r\nto do the same? \r\nDraft resolution VII was adopted (resolution 67/69).\r\nThe Acting President: Draft resolution VIII is \r\nentitled “Regional confidence-building measures: \r\nactivities of the United Nations Standing Advisory \r\nCommittee on Security Questions in Central Africa”. \r\nThe First Committee adopted it without a vote. May I \r\ntake it that the Assembly wishes to do the same? \r\nDraft resolution VIII was adopted (resolution \r\n67/70).\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is \r\nthe wish of the General Assembly to conclude its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 95? \r\nIt was so decided. \r\nAgenda item 96 \r\nReview of the implementation of the \r\nrecommendations and decisions adopted by the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its tenth special session\r\nReport of the First Committee (A/67/411) \r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly has before \r\nit two draft resolutions recommended by the First \r\nCommittee in paragraph 9 of its report. We will now \r\ntake a decision on draft resolutions I and II. \r\nWe turn first to draft resolution I, entitled “Report \r\nof the Disarmament Commission“.

These are the two regional States \r\nthat are undergoing investigation by the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA) owing to their \r\nclandestine activities in contravention of their NPT \r\nobligations. It cannot be overemphasized that those \r\ncountries have been the subject of numerous resolutions \r\nadopted by the Security Council and the IAEA Board \r\nof Governors.\r\nAt a minimum, Israel would expect a call for \r\ncompliance by all States of the region with their \r\nrelevant international non-proliferation obligations. \r\nLamentably, this resolution chooses to ignore relevant \r\nIAEA and Security Council resolutions, as well as the \r\nevidence contained in IAEA reports regarding Iran’s \r\nand Syria’s gross violations.\r\nAdopting such an ill-motivated and unbalanced \r\nresolution, which aims to single out Israel in a biased \r\nmanner, will not serve the greater objective of curbing \r\nproliferation in the Middle East, nor will it contribute \r\nto the role and standing of this body in advancing peace \r\nand security in the Middle East. Similarly, it will not \r\nbe consistent with the responsible behaviour we expect \r\nof regional States and the international community at \r\nlarge if there is true interest in regional security.\r\nFinally, the fact that the sponsors choose to include \r\nin this anti-Israeli resolution language referring to the \r\n2012 conference proves, above all, the ill intent of the \r\nArab States with regard to that proposed conference. \r\nMr. Hallak (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in \r\nArabic): I would like to explain our vote on resolution \r\n67/73, entitled “The risk of nuclear proliferation in the \r\nMiddle East”.\r\nDuring the general debate and the substantive \r\ndebate in the First Committee at this sixty-seventh \r\nsession, many of the statements made welcomed the \r\nconvening of a conference aimed at creating a zone \r\nfree of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass \r\ndestruction in the Middle East. The conference was \r\nto be held in Finland in December 2012. However, \r\nsuch optimism was unwarranted, as the international \r\ncommunity, represented by this Organization, had \r\nnot foreseen that the holding, or not holding, of the \r\nconference would be subject to the whim of just one \r\nparty from the region. That party possesses nuclear \r\nwarheads and the delivery systems for them and is far \r\nfrom being in compliance with obligations under the \r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \r\nAbstaining:\r\nAustralia, Cameroon, Côte d’Ivoire, Ethiopia, \r\nIndia, Panama\r\nThe draft resolution, as a whole, was adopted by \r\n174 votes to 6, with 6 abstentions (resolution 67/73).\r\nThe Acting President: I shall now give the f loor \r\nto representatives who wish to speak in explanation of \r\nvote following the voting. May I remind delegations \r\nthat explanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes and \r\nshould be made by delegations from their seats. \r\nMr. Yanouka (Israel): My explanation of vote \r\nrefers to resolution 67/73, just adopted under agenda \r\nitem 97, “The risk of nuclear proliferation in the Middle \r\nEast”.\r\nEvery year we question the motivation of the authors \r\nbehind the draft resolution entitled “The risk of nuclear \r\nproliferation in the Middle East” and the motivation of \r\nthe States who vote in favour of it. We cannot help but \r\nwonder whether the distance between New York and \r\nthe Middle East is not stretched unnaturally, to such \r\nan extent that their vision has been irreparably blurred. \r\nThere is no question regarding the risk of nuclear \r\nproliferation in the Middle East. Israel continuously and \r\nconsistently points to this danger. With four of five widely \r\nacknowledged cases of gross non-compliance with \r\nobligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \r\nof Nuclear Weapons (NPT) taking place in the Middle \r\nEast and the fifth case — the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea — being heavily involved in nuclear \r\nproliferation to the Middle East, this seems to require \r\nno great cognitive powers. \r\nAll these cases fundamentally challenge Israel’s \r\nsecurity and cast a dark shadow on the prospects for \r\nembarking upon a meaningful regional security process. \r\nThey also demonstrate the cynical way in which some \r\nregional States treat their international commitments \r\nin the nuclear domain, while they and others exploit \r\nthe multilateral arena and the automatic majority that \r\nexists against Israel. \r\nIn that context, we wonder whether the current \r\nturmoil and transformation processes under way in \r\nthe region will shed light on the full extent of the real \r\nproliferation risks in the region.\r\nIsrael expects that, under the item “The risk \r\nof nuclear proliferation in the Middle East”, the \r\ninternational community will closely look at the cases \r\n34 12-62440\r\nA/67/PV.48\r\ncreation of a zone free from nuclear weapons and other \r\nweapons of mass destruction in the Middle East. \r\nWe have just heard the representative of Israel \r\ndeliver a statement that was like a piece of absurdist \r\ntheatre. With lies and false arguments, he accused \r\ncertain parties in order to distract us from the true \r\ndanger of Israeli nuclear proliferation. Israel refuses to \r\nadhere to the international resolutions on this matter, to \r\naccede to the NPT and to submit its nuclear installations \r\nto IAEA safeguards and oversight. It is an open secret \r\nthat Israel pursues an aggressive nuclear-weapon policy \r\nwith an enormous nuclear arsenal, including delivery \r\nsystems, that is larger than those of the United Kingdom \r\nand France, for example. Israel has nuclear weapons \r\nbut likes to remain silent, through a policy of nuclear \r\nambiguity, on the threat they pose. The representative of \r\nIsrael makes false statements while his country refuses \r\nto live up to the relevant international resolutions and \r\nto submit its nuclear installations to IAEA inspections. \r\nThis is ironic. \r\nWe call upon the international community to \r\npressure Israel to accede to the NPT as a non-nuclear \r\nparty, and ultimately to get rid of its nuclear arsenal, \r\nincluding delivery systems, in order to achieve security \r\nand stability in our region.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is \r\nthe wish of the General Assembly to conclude its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 97?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 98\r\nConvention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the \r\nUse of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May \r\nBe Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have \r\nIndiscriminate Effects\r\nReport of the First Committee (A/67/413)\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly has before it \r\na draft resolution recommended by the First Committee \r\nin paragraph 8 of its report. We will now take a decision \r\non the draft resolution. The First Committee adopted it \r\nwithout a vote. May I take it that the Assembly wishes \r\nto do the same? \r\nThe draft resolution was adopted (resolution 67/74).\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is \r\nthe wish of the General Assembly to conclude its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 98?\r\n(NPT). Those weapons and their delivery systems \r\nthreaten international and regional peace and security. \r\nShaul Chorev, Director General of the Israeli \r\nAtomic Energy Commission, in his statement at \r\nthe annual conference of the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna, underscored that \r\nit was premature to hold an international conference \r\nfor the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone \r\nin the Middle East. He used as a pretext the idea that \r\ncreating a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle \r\nEast would require preconditions and a change in the \r\ncurrent direction in the region. He thereby f louted the \r\ninternational consensus and the outcome of the 2010 \r\nNPT Review Conference and denied the fact that his \r\ncountry was the only country in our region that poses \r\na nuclear threat. \r\nBut that is not all. The United States, one of the \r\nsponsors of the conference, just a few days ago issued \r\na statement through the official spokesperson of the \r\nState Department, informing us that the United States \r\nregretted to announce that the conference would not \r\ntake place given the current situation in the Middle East \r\nand the fact that the countries of the region were not \r\nable to reach agreement on acceptable conditions for \r\nits convening. \r\nWe are surprised that the irresponsible statements \r\nby Israel and the United States — which stood by \r\nIsrael, as it traditionally does — were not condemned \r\nby countries that usually call for the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security, democracy, equality, \r\nrespect for the principles of international law, nuclear \r\nnon-proliferation and for upholding the sacred nature of \r\nthe NPT. Those countries saw fit to remain suspiciously \r\nsilent when those statements were made. That is in itself \r\na threatening and dangerous precedent that undermines \r\nthe principles of the Organization. About seven decades \r\nago, we all committed to respect these principles of the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\nIsrael has declared that it does not wish to \r\nparticipate in the conference. The United States called \r\nfor its cancellation. This is a strange and inappropriate \r\nway to abandon one’s collective commitments, which \r\napply to all States, in accordance with the resolution \r\non the Middle East and the Final Document of the 2010 \r\nNPT Review Conference (NPT/CONF.2010/50 (Vol. \r\nI)).

It \r\nis the long-standing position of Israel that the CTBT and \r\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \r\n(NPT) are not linked. An attempt to artificially force \r\nsuch a linkage, especially through a reference to the \r\nNPT Review Conference — a forum that Israel is not a \r\nmember of — would only jeopardize the CTBT and its \r\nnoble causes, as well as any prospect for better regional \r\nsecurity in the Middle East. \r\nIsrael’s signing of the CTBT in 1996 reflected its \r\nlong-standing policy of bringing itself closer, wherever \r\npossible, to international norms on nuclear safety, \r\nsecurity and non-proliferation. Since the establishment \r\nof the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive \r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO), Israel \r\nhas actively participated in the development of all \r\nelements of the CTBT verification regime. Israel also \r\ntransmits data from its certified seismic station to the \r\nInternational Data Centre and actively participates in \r\nvarious activities related to on-site inspections. \r\nWe are pleased to announce that Israel’s radionuclide \r\nlaboratory supporting the International Monitoring \r\nSystem was recently certified. That substantive and \r\nintensive involvement demonstrates the importance \r\nIsrael attributes to the CTBT and its contribution to the \r\nenhancement of international peace and security. \r\nIsrael appreciates the significant progress made \r\nin the development of the CTBT verification regime, \r\nwhose completion is a prerequisite to the entry \r\ninto force of the Treaty. However, completing the \r\nverification regime still requires further efforts.

We will now take a decision \r\non the draft resolution. The First Committee adopted it \r\nwithout a vote. May I take it that the Assembly wishes \r\nto do likewise?\r\nThe draft resolution was adopted (resolution 67/77).\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is \r\nthe wish of the General Assembly to conclude its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 101?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 102\r\nRevitalizing the work of the Conference on \r\nDisarmament and taking forward multilateral \r\ndisarmament negotiations\r\nReport of the First Committee (A/67/417)\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly has before it \r\na draft decision recommended by the First Committee \r\nin paragraph 7 of its report.

I also wish to take this opportunity to commend \r\nthe outgoing Executive Secretary, Ambassador Tibor \r\nTóth, for his leadership and efforts in connection with \r\nthe verification regime. \r\nFor Israel, the regional security situation in the \r\nMiddle East, including adherence to and compliance \r\nwith the Treaty by States in the region, is a major \r\nconsideration for ratification. It is Israel’s view that the \r\nTreaty’s verification regime should be robust enough \r\nto detect non-compliance with its basic obligations, be \r\nimmune to abuse and at the same time allow each State \r\nsignatory to protect its national security interests. \r\nFor Israel, the completion of the verification regime \r\nconstitutes a major consideration for ratification, as we \r\nwould like to ensure that there is adequate coverage \r\nof the Middle East by the International Monitoring \r\nSystem. In addition, Israel’s status in the policymaking \r\norgans of the Treaty, including those connected to the \r\ngeographical regions of the Middle East and South \r\nAsia, and in the Executive Council of the future \r\nCTBTO, must be addressed. Sovereign equality, which \r\nis a cornerstone of multilateralism, must be ensured.\r\nPending its entry into force, we believe that the \r\nCTBT should be advanced further by States taking upon \r\nthemselves the following commitments and activities. \r\nThey must maintain the commitment not to carry out \r\nany nuclear-weapon test explosion, in line with the \r\nTreaty’s basic obligations, and complete as soon as \r\npossible the CTBT verification regime. States must \r\noperate, maintain and test the International Monitoring \r\nSystem and International Data Centre in order to gain \r\nexperience and provide early detection capabilities \r\nand, where there are coverage gaps of International \r\nMonitoring System stations, take temporary measures \r\nto fill those gaps, such as operating auxiliary seismic \r\nstations as primary ones until all primary stations are \r\neffectively functioning and transferring data. And \r\nStates must maintain the technical and apolitical nature \r\nof the work of the Preparatory Commission and respect \r\nits rules and procedures. \r\nAs we have done in previous years, Israel voted in \r\nfavour of this resolution. Our voting pattern stems from \r\n38 12-62440\r\nA/67/PV.48\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly has thus \r\nconcluded this stage of its consideration of agenda item \r\n131.\r\nOn behalf of the General Assembly, I would like to \r\nthank the Chair of the First Committee, His Excellency \r\nMr. Desra Percaya of Indonesia, the members of \r\nthe Bureau, the Secretary of the Committee and \r\nrepresentatives for a job well done.\r\nThe Assembly has thus concluded its consideration \r\nof all the reports of the First Committee before it, with \r\nthe exception of draft resolution IV, entitled “The \r\narms trade treaty”, contained in document A/67/409. \r\nAs noted earlier, the Assembly will take action on \r\ndraft resolution IV as soon as the report of the Fifth \r\nCommittee on its programme budget implications is \r\navailable.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.25 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 116\r\nRevitalization of the work of the General Assembly\r\nReport of the First Committee (A/67/418) \r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly has before it \r\na draft decision recommended by the First Committee \r\nin paragraph 5 of its report. We will now take action \r\non the draft decision, entitled “Proposed programme of \r\nwork and timetable of the First Committee for 2013”. \r\nThe Committee adopted it without a vote. May I take it \r\nthat the Assembly wishes to do likewise?\r\nThe draft decision was adopted.\r\nThe Acting President: The General Assembly has \r\nthus concluded this stage of its consideration of agenda \r\nitem 116.\r\nAgenda item 131\r\nProgramme planning\r\nReport of the First Committee (A/67/419)\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that the \r\nGeneral Assembly takes note of the report of the First \r\nCommittee?\r\n"
