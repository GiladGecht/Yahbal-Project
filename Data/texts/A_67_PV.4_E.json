On behalf of \r\nSwitzerland, I would like to thank you for organizing \r\nthis High-level Meeting on the Rule of Law at the \r\nNational and International Levels. \r\nThe rule of law is a basic principle that must be at the \r\nroot of all our actions and endeavours to achieve lasting \r\npeace and prevent conflict. It is also a precondition \r\nfor ensuring respect for human rights. Preserving the \r\nrule of law requires constant effort from which no \r\none is exempt. No State or institution, however well-\r\ndeveloped, can take it for granted. Quite the contrary, \r\nthe rule of law needs constant care. We are here today \r\nto actively reflect on how we want and are able to \r\nstrengthen the rule of law. Above all, however, we are \r\nalso here to ensure that our thoughts and commitments \r\nare put into concrete action. I wish to highlight four \r\nareas in which it seems particularly vital that we take \r\ncommon action.\r\nFirst, in order to bring about what the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has called the “age of accountability”, I would \r\nlike to underline the fundamental role of the fight \r\nagainst impunity and transitional justice. That is why \r\nSwitzerland is committed to working with all States \r\nMembers of the United Nations to strengthen best \r\npractices in the field. Transitional justice is a crucial \r\ninstrument for strengthening the rule of law in the \r\ncontext of massive human rights violations. The truth \r\nabout violations, the adjudication of perpetrators, \r\nreparations for victims and the reform of institutions \r\nare indispensable to achieving lasting reconciliation \r\nand avoiding the recurrence of atrocities. \r\nWords alone are not enough; we must also be \r\nready to act decisively to ensure that perpetrators \r\nbe held accountable. That is why Switzerland calls \r\non the Security Council to refer the situation in the \r\nSyrian Arab Republic to the International Criminal \r\nCourt so that the Court can investigate crimes under \r\nits jurisdiction that may have been committed by any \r\nparty to the conflict. \r\nSecondly, we must find a way to strengthen \r\nan area of the law that is particularly important to \r\nSwitzerland — international humanitarian law, or \r\nthe law of armed conflict. At last year’s International \r\nConference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent, the \r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations expressed his \r\nappreciation for Switzerland’s commitment to exploring \r\nand identifying concrete means of strengthening the \r\nUnited Nations A/67/PV.4\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-seventh session\r\n4th plenary meeting\r\nMonday, 24 September 2012, 3 p.m.\r\nNew York\r\nOffi cial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Jeremić  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Serbia)\r\n2 12-51943\r\nA/67/PV.4\r\napplication of international humanitarian law and \r\nreinforcing dialogue on international humanitarian \r\nlaw issues among States and other interested actors, in \r\ncooperation with the International Committee of the \r\nRed Cross. Switzerland is greatly encouraged by the \r\nmany statements of support it has received and will \r\npursue its efforts to strengthen respect for international \r\nhumanitarian law.\r\nThirdly, we believe that the rule of law should also \r\napply to international organizations, particularly the \r\nUnited Nations. In that regard, one of Switzerland’s \r\nhighest priorities is ensuring that United Nations \r\nprocedures are increasingly credible, legitimate and \r\neffective. In our view, this means that all United \r\nNations organs must comply with the principles of the \r\nrule of law. That is why Switzerland remains committed \r\nto promoting the establishment of fair and transparent \r\nprocedures within the Organization. It is also why we \r\nhave argued for improving the working methods of \r\nthe Security Council and for greater respect for the \r\nprinciples of due process in the Council’s sanctions \r\nprocedures. Only an organization that upholds the \r\nhighest standards itself can be credible in promoting \r\nthose standards elsewhere.\r\nFinally, it is time to recognize the fundamental role \r\nplayed by the rule of law in the area of development. \r\nNo society can prosper if its members lack confidence \r\nin the law or the knowledge that it will be enforced. \r\nThis is especially true of societies that are emerging \r\nfrom armed conflict or where there have been gross \r\nviolations of human rights. In that context, Switzerland \r\nemphasizes the importance of coherent action on the \r\npart of the United Nations in the area of the rule of law. \r\nWe want international aid designed to support national \r\nefforts to reinforce the rule of law to be more effective, \r\ncoordinated and coherent. In particular, transitional \r\njustice mechanisms must be better coordinated with \r\nstrategies aimed at strengthening the rule of law. We \r\nalso need to improve the capacities of Member States \r\nand promote the exchange of best practices among \r\nthem. This will help us to strengthen our common \r\ncommitment, while acknowledging that there is no \r\nsingle approach to promoting the rule of law.\r\nAs we can see, there is still much to be done. \r\nWhile it is certainly important to reaffirm our shared \r\ncommitment to supporting the rule of law, our focus \r\nmust now be on how to translate that commitment \r\ninto concrete action, both at home and in cooperation \r\nwith other countries. The individual and collective \r\npledges made today by so many States demonstrate \r\nthat we all have the power to change things. Resolution \r\n67/1,  adopted today, is the first of its kind for the \r\ninternational community. We look forward to seeing \r\nour commitments put into practice and to measuring \r\nthe impact of our joint efforts in building a more just \r\nand secure world for all, based on the rule of law. We \r\nhope that this High-level Meeting will be a starting \r\npoint in our efforts to fully implement the principle of \r\nthe rule of law.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Otto Fernando Pérez \r\nMolina, President of the Republic of Guatemala.\r\nPresident Pérez Molina (spoke in Spanish): I am \r\npleased to participate in this High-level Meeting on the \r\nrule of law. While the topic is enormously important, \r\nthe time available allows us only a few comments. I \r\nshould like to use those few minutes to describe how the \r\nState of Guatemala and the United Nations have joined \r\nforces to strengthen the rule of law in my country.\r\nI am referring to the creation of the International \r\nCommission against Impunity in Guatemala, known as \r\nCICIG, a one-of-a-kind arrangement that, while born of \r\nour domestic administrative and juridical institutions, \r\ngrants to the Secretary-General the power to designate \r\nits Commissioner, and grants to the Commissioner the \r\nright to recruit the international and national staff of \r\nthe Commission. The Commission, which is financed \r\npartially with contributions from the international donor \r\ncommunity, was conceived as an interim arrangement \r\nwhose main purpose was to strengthen the national \r\ninstitutions charged with criminal prosecution, law \r\nenforcement and the administration of justice. While the \r\nagreement signed between the United Nations and the \r\nGovernment of Guatemala allows the Commission to \r\nact in certain instances as a complementary prosecutor \r\nin parallel with the work of the Public Prosecutor, its \r\nmain function is to strengthen our security and justice \r\nsystems through technical assistance, training and \r\nsupport.\r\nWhile the Commission by its nature is \r\nindependent — which is its chief strength — it should \r\nbe pointed out that this independence was deliberately \r\nbestowed on it by the State of Guatemala to ensure its \r\nability to fulfil its mandate. Up to now, the Commission \r\nhas helped us to resolve various paradigmatic cases \r\nrelating to transnational organized crime and bring the \r\nperpetrators of illicit activities to justice. In addition, \r\nit has transferred capacities to the office of our Public \r\n12-51943 3\r\nA/67/PV.4\r\nmembers of one society in relation to those of others, \r\nand for implementing a sound framework of inter-State \r\nrelationships in the globalized world. More important is \r\nthat the rule of law should prepare the basis for human \r\nsociety to proceed towards the realm of freedom, ending \r\nall forms of exploitation of men by men. We firmly \r\nbelieve that ensuring the rule of law at the international \r\nlevel has as much importance as it does at the national \r\nlevel because it provides essential tools and principles \r\nfor peaceful coexistence and cooperation among States.\r\nThe rule of law, however, should not be used as \r\na cover for domination of one country by another. \r\nPractising a double standard in its application should \r\nbe avoided. When we endeavour to establish the rule of \r\nlaw at the international level, it is extremely important \r\nto create a level playing field where all States can \r\nparticipate in an equitable manner. The accumulation \r\nof wealth amidst despicable poverty and an absence of \r\nresources at the cost of the very existence of our planet \r\ncannot be in line with the rule of law.\r\nNepal believes that the United Nations is the most \r\nwell-placed and legitimate multilateral institution to \r\npromote the rule of law at the national and international \r\nlevels. Having been established in principle and \r\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, \r\ninternational law and the promotion of multilateralism \r\nin handling all international issues of common concerns \r\nplay a pivotal role in the promotion of the rule of law in \r\na plural context.\r\nNepal places high importance on the revitalization \r\nof the General Assembly to make it the most \r\nlegitimate and competent organ for the development of \r\ninternational norms, standards and legal instruments. \r\nNepal remains committed to promoting the rule of law \r\nat the international level by adhering to the Charter \r\nof the United Nations and fulfilling its obligations \r\nemanating from international treaty bodies to which it \r\nis a party. \r\nThe rule of law at the national level is more \r\nimportant for countries emerging from conflict, where \r\nthe strengthening of administrative law enforcement, \r\njudicial institutions and other governance mechanisms \r\nmust be accorded top priority. An enhanced level of \r\ninternational support under the aegis of the United \r\nNations would help such countries in grappling with \r\nthe establishment of an environment conducive to \r\nencouraging and ensuring the rule of law. National \r\nownership and capacity-building need to be at the core \r\nof our efforts as we seek to establish and sustain the \r\nProsecutor, and worked closely with our judicial and \r\nlegislative organs in adapting the country’s legislation \r\nand standards in order to strengthen the security and \r\njustice sectors. As a important by-product of this \r\neffort, the Public Prosecutor and the Ministry of the \r\nInterior have worked closely in the areas of criminal \r\ninvestigation and prosecution.\r\nMr. Salam (Lebanon), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair.\r\nIn conclusion, an example of close cooperation \r\namong our State institutions was offered in a meeting \r\nheld in this same building barely two weeks ago, when \r\nthe presidents of the judicial and legislative organs \r\nand the Vice-President of the Republic of Guatemala, \r\ntogether with the Commissioner of the CICIG, the \r\nPublic Prosecutor and the Ministers of the Interior \r\nand of Foreign Affairs, came together to affirm the \r\ncommitment and programme of work of the Commission \r\nfor the coming year, and to prepare the groundwork for \r\na possible two-year extension. We therefore believe that \r\nGuatemala, with the help of the United Nations, has a \r\nsuccess story to present in the area of strengthening the \r\nrule of law.\r\nI would be remiss in not thanking Mexico and \r\nDenmark for their outstanding roles as facilitators in \r\nguiding our efforts towards the high-level Declaration \r\n(resolution 67/1), adopted this morning, which we fully \r\nsupport.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I now give \r\nthe f loor to His Excellency Mr. Narayan Kaji Shrestha \r\n“Prakash”, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Federal Democratic Republic  of \r\nNepal.\r\nMr. Shrestha (Nepal): My delegation wishes to \r\nexpress its sincere appreciation to the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly for organizing this important High-\r\nlevel Meeting on the Rule of Law at the National and \r\nInternational Levels. I hope that the Declaration that we \r\nadopted today (resolution 67/1) will be able to advance \r\nour commitment and responsibility for upholding the \r\nhopes and aspirations of billions of people yearning for \r\na more just, equitable, inclusive and prosperous world.\r\nThe concept of the rule of law, which is indelibly \r\nlinked to democracy and fundamental freedoms, evolved \r\nover the course of the historical development of human \r\nsociety in its struggle against feudalism and autocracy. \r\nThe rule of law is important for the protection of the \r\nrights of individual citizens in relation to the State and \r\n4 12-51943\r\nA/67/PV.4\r\nnecessary legal and institutional infrastructures. The \r\nrule of law must seek to promote inclusive, just and \r\nequitable societies if we are to address the root causes \r\nof conflict, such as poverty, exclusion, marginalization \r\nand deprivation in the political, economic and social \r\nspheres.\r\nNepal is committed to strengthening the rule \r\nof law at the national level as part of its historic \r\ntransformational process. In fact, the historic struggle \r\nof all the Nepalese people, entailing the sacrifice of \r\nthousands of lives, was for the purpose of establishing \r\nthe rule of law along with equity and justice. Thus, \r\nNepal is committed to ensuring the rule of law, the \r\npromotion and protection of human rights, and ending \r\nimpunity.\r\nThe provisions of the Comprehensive Peace Accord \r\nsigned in 2006, which was a key turning point in our \r\nhome-grown peace process, and the interim Constitution, \r\nwhich is a transitional justice mechanism necessary to \r\ntake the peace process to its logical conclusion, were the \r\noutcomes of broad consultations among stakeholders. \r\nThey meet the national and international requirements \r\nfor durable peace, justice and reconciliation in a holistic \r\nmanner. I hope that the international community, which \r\nis very supportive of our peace process, understands \r\nthe sensitivity of that process and our main task to end \r\nthe conflict forever. Nepal has ratified major human \r\nrights instruments, including seven out of nine core \r\nhuman rights instruments, in recent years. A number \r\nof initiatives have been taken to reform governance and \r\nestablish the rule of law.\r\nIn Nepal, the National Human Rights Commission \r\nis a designated constitutional body working as a \r\nwarden of human rights protection and promotion. \r\nThe capacity of the institution is being built as a \r\nreal custodian of human rights for all the people. A \r\nmechanism for effective adjudication of the decisions \r\nand recommendations of the National Human Rights \r\nCommission and judgements of the Supreme Court have \r\nbeen established at the Office of the Prime Minister \r\nand Council of Ministers.\r\nReforms in legal aid, judicial reform, reforms \r\nin police laws, and a number of other reforms \r\nand amendments to legislation that were deemed \r\ndiscriminatory have come into effect. Other important \r\ninitiatives, started with earnest objectives, are under \r\nway. For least developed countries emerging from \r\nconflict, an enhanced level of support with adequate \r\nresources, know-how and technical capacity-building \r\nare needed in a coordinated and coherent manner to \r\nstrengthen the rule of law.\r\nThe international community should deliver \r\neffective support measures to promote national \r\nownership and capacity-building for those countries, \r\nfor the advancement of the rule of law. I also call \r\nfor adherence to multilateralism and respect for the \r\nguiding principles and standards of international law at \r\nthe international level.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I now \r\ngive the f loor to His Excellency Mr. Miroslav Lajčák, \r\nDeputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof the Slovak Republic.\r\nMr. Lajčák (Slovakia): It is a distinct honour and \r\npleasure for me to address the Assembly at the outset \r\nof its sixty-seventh session. This High-level Meeting \r\non the Rule of Law at the National and International \r\nLevels provides us with an excellent opportunity to \r\nshare our views and experiences on the rule of law, \r\nas a core principle of governance that ensures justice \r\nand fairness, which are values essential to humankind \r\ntoday and in the future. Slovakia fully subscribes to \r\nthe statement delivered by the observer of the European \r\nUnion earlier today.\r\nThe foreign policy of Slovakia is based on respect \r\nfor core democratic values, international law and \r\neffective multilateralism. We therefore welcome and \r\nsupport the convening of this meeting on the rule of law. \r\nThis topic is even more important in being based on the \r\npresumption of governance in which all stakeholders, \r\npersons, public and private institutions and entities, \r\nand States themselves are accountable to laws \r\npublicly promulgated, equally enforced, independently \r\nadjudicated, and consistent with international norms \r\nand principles. At the international level, it is of the \r\nutmost importance to ensure the equality of States, full \r\ncompliance of their actions with international law, and \r\ntheir responsibility to individuals on their territories \r\nand under their sovereignty. \r\nOn the other side, at the national level, the rule of \r\nlaw is a key principle that interacts with society at every \r\nlevel, guarantees the protection of human rights and \r\nthe fair resolution of disputes between individuals, and \r\nprovides legitimate tools of recourse in case of abuses \r\nof power. Slovakia is fully committed to respecting the \r\ngeneral legal principles enshrined in the United Nations \r\nCharter, including sovereign equality, the peaceful \r\nsettlement of international disputes and refraining \r\n12-51943 5\r\nA/67/PV.4\r\nfrom the threat or use of force against the territorial \r\nintegrity or political independence of any State. It is \r\nalso committed to fulfilling its obligations arising from \r\nvarious international instruments. \r\nEnsuring national implementation of the existing \r\ninternational legal framework remains today’s \r\nchallenge. States are facing different obstacles in \r\nensuring that implementation at the national level, thus \r\ncontributing to non-compliance with their international \r\nobligations. Therefore, we commend the readiness of \r\nthe Secretary-General to provide an integrated response \r\nto requests of States for assistance in that area.\r\nFurthermore, an eminent part of the principle of \r\nthe rule of law is to ensure the existence of adequate \r\nadjudicative mechanisms whereby States can make \r\ntheir claims in case of disagreement. In that regard, any \r\ninternational dispute among States should be resolved \r\nby means of peaceful settlement. The key role of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, the principal judicial \r\norgan of the United Nations, should be strengthened \r\nthrough acceptance of its compulsory jurisdiction \r\nby all States Members of the United Nations. The \r\nCourt’s jurisprudence in contentious cases and \r\nadvisory proceedings contributes to the development of \r\ninternational law and the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security. Slovakia strongly supports the \r\napplication of that principle in conflict and post-conflict \r\nsituations, where the rule of law is indispensable \r\nboth to the restoration and the maintenance of peace \r\nand stability and to the establishment of integral \r\ngovernmental systems and well-functioning public \r\ninstitutions, including in the spheres of justice and \r\nsecurity. \r\nWhile addressing the topic of the rule of law, we \r\ncannot forget to stress the importance of strengthening \r\nthe international human rights legal framework. In \r\nparticular, the most vulnerable among us deserve \r\nour attention. Slovakia, as a strong promoter of \r\nthe protection of human rights, was one of the main \r\ninitiators of the adoption of the third Optional Protocol \r\nto the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a \r\ncommunications procedure, which was opened for \r\nsignature in February this year. That Protocol not \r\nonly represents a new juridical instrument that will \r\nstrengthen and broaden the implementation, recognition \r\nand representation of the rights of the child, but also \r\nconstitutes a new remedy for children to invoke their \r\nrights. It will provide individual children with the \r\nopportunity to submit complaints on the violation of \r\ntheir rights to the Committee on the Rights of the Child \r\nafter the exhaustion of local remedies, or directly, \r\nwhen national mechanisms for such complaints are not \r\nin place or inefficient. We call on all United Nations \r\nMember States to become parties to the Protocol.\r\nIn that regard, I would like to report that Slovakia \r\nhas joined other States that have submitted their national \r\npledges with the aim of strengthening their support of \r\nthe rule of law. Slovakia undertakes to ratify by the end \r\nof 2013 the Optional Protocol of the Convention on the \r\nRights of the Child on a communications procedure \r\nand the Council of Europe Convention on preventing \r\nand combating violence against women and domestic \r\nviolence. In addition, Slovakia will strengthen its legal \r\nand institutional framework in order to recognize \r\nwomen’s right to be free from all forms of violence \r\nand discrimination, in compliance with international \r\nhuman rights law. Furthermore, Slovakia fully \r\nsupports the fight to end impunity for perpetrators of \r\nthe most serious crimes under international law, such \r\nas genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. \r\nOur everyday life confirms that abuses of law occur \r\nboth at the national and international levels. Those cases \r\nvery often arise at the expense of justice. I wish to raise \r\na question. Has the time not yet come to focus our joint \r\nefforts on the further enhancement of the principle of \r\nthe rule of justice, since it forms an equal and indivisible \r\npart of the rule of law? Our common ambition for the \r\nfuture is not only the pragmatic application of the \r\nrule of law in individual cases but more importantly \r\nstrategic compliance with that principle, which goes \r\nhand in hand with the principle of the rule of justice. \r\nSlovakia is prepared to contribute actively to effective \r\ndiscussion in that regard. \r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I now give \r\nthe f loor to Her Royal Highness Princess Bajrakitiyabha \r\nMahidol of the Kingdom of Thailand.\r\nPrincess Bajrakitiyabha Mahidol (Thailand): I \r\nhave the honour to speak on behalf of the 10 nations of \r\nthe Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). \r\nDue to time constraints, the full statement is being \r\ndistributed.\r\nWith the entry into force of the ASEAN Charter \r\nin 2008, ASEAN is now becoming a rules-based, \r\npeople-centred community. The Charter clearly \r\nexpresses the group’s firm commitment to enhancing \r\nthe rule of law, good governance, democracy and \r\nconstitutional government. Adherence to the rule of \r\n6 12-51943\r\nA/67/PV.4\r\nlaw is a core principle under the Charter that binds all \r\nASEAN member States. ASEAN leaders recognize \r\nthe crucial role of the rule of law in ensuring justice, \r\nequality, stability and sustainable prosperity, and, at \r\nthe international level, respect for the fundamental \r\nprinciples of international law, including that of the \r\nsovereign equality of States.\r\nASEAN countries reiterate their commitment to \r\nimplementing their obligations under international \r\ntreaties to which they are party. The institutional and \r\nlegal framework of ASEAN has been strengthened \r\nthrough the adoption of a number of legal documents \r\nand mechanisms. ASEAN strengthened its cooperation \r\nwith the United Nations through the adoption of the \r\nJoint Declaration on Comprehensive Partnership \r\nbetween ASEAN and the United Nations in 2011, aimed \r\nat expanding cooperation in areas including human \r\nrights, good governance, democracy and the rule of \r\nlaw through consultation, information-sharing and \r\ncapacity-building.\r\nI shall now deliver the following Thai national \r\nstatement. My delegation fully supports the convening \r\nof this High-level Meeting, which demonstrates the \r\ninternational community’s commitment to promoting \r\nthe rule of law and the major role that the United \r\nNations plays on this important subject. For Thailand, \r\nthe rule of law is an indispensable foundation of a more \r\npeaceful, prosperous and just world as it provides an \r\nessential framework for our societies, domestically and \r\ninternationally.\r\nThe Constitution of Thailand provides that the \r\nhuman dignity, rights and liberties, as well as the \r\nequality, of the people shall be protected and that \r\nthey are entitled to equal protection before the law, \r\nirrespective of race, gender or religion. In 2011, the \r\nThai Government set up an Independent National Rule \r\nof Law Commission to ensure that all State organs \r\nperform their duties based on the rule of law.\r\nIn addition, Thailand reaffirms the importance of \r\nmainstreaming gender sensitivity and a rights-based \r\napproach into the criminal justice system. In too many \r\nsocieties, women are subject to discrimination, both \r\novert and subtle. That is why we believe it is important \r\nto integrate such an approach into criminal justice \r\nsystems.\r\nTwo years ago, we launched the United Nations \r\nRules for the Treatment of Women Prisoners and \r\nNon-custodial Measures for Women Offenders, or the \r\nBangkok Rules. Thailand is determined to implement \r\nthose rules in correctional facilities throughout the \r\ncountry. We hope to share our best practices with other \r\ncountries for the benefit of female inmates around \r\nthe world. We are also determined to implement the \r\nupdated Model Strategies and Practical Measures on \r\nthe Elimination of Violence against Women in the Field \r\nof Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice.\r\nAt the international level, Thailand is firmly \r\ncommitted to complying with all treaties to which it \r\nis a party, especially with respect to the seven major \r\ninternational human rights treaties.\r\nThailand recognizes the rule of law as an essential \r\nelement in addressing issues of global concern such as \r\ncorruption, transnational organized crime, terrorism, \r\ndrug trafficking and trafficking in persons. We also \r\nattach importance to the promotion and protection of \r\nthe rights of the child and access to effective remedies \r\nbased on the rule of law. I am therefore pleased to \r\nreport that, at the treaty event to be held tomorrow, \r\nThailand will sign and ratify the Optional Protocol \r\nto the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a \r\ncommunications procedure.\r\nAddressing the link between crime and development \r\nis important in promoting the rule of law. Crime \r\nhinders sustainable development, but development can \r\nhelp reduce crime. Sustainable alternative development \r\nis one example: strengthening community capacity to \r\ndevelop alternative, legitimate means of income has \r\nhelped reduce opium cultivation. The rule of law and \r\nsustainable socio-economic development are thus two \r\nforces that work together for the betterment of society.\r\nIn that connection, Thailand invites all Member \r\nStates to consider supporting the General Assembly \r\ndraft resolution entitled “Strengthening the rule of \r\nlaw and the reform of criminal justice institutions, \r\nparticularly in the areas related to the United Nations \r\nsystem-wide approach to fighting transnational \r\norganized crime and drug trafficking”. That will send \r\na clear message to the effect that the robust rule of law \r\nis needed to rid the world of crime while promoting \r\nsustainable development and peace.\r\nStrengthening the rule of law is our common \r\nresponsibility. Let us all work to fulfil that goal \r\nby promoting the rule of law at the national and \r\ninternational levels under the United Nations umbrella \r\nto bring about a just world.\r\n12-51943 7\r\nA/67/PV.4\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I now give \r\nthe f loor to His Excellency Mr. Jean Asselborn, Deputy \r\nPrime Minister of Luxembourg.\r\nMr. Asselborn (Luxembourg) (spoke in French): \r\nWe are gathered here today for an event whose \r\nimportance cannot be overestimated. The High-level \r\nMeeting of the General Assembly on the Rule of Law at \r\nthe National and International Levels is indeed the first \r\nof its kind, and we are grateful to the Secretary-General \r\nfor having launched this important initiative.\r\nAs the Secretary-General points out in paragraph \r\n1 of his report (A/66/749) on strengthening the rule of \r\nlaw, in the face of the innumerable challenges that our \r\nworld is confronted with today, “robust principles are \r\nneeded to underpin the management of our future”.\r\nIn order to provide the broadest possible foundation, \r\nsuch robust principles must overcome our ideological, \r\ncultural and confessional divides. The rule of law \r\ntakes a central place in this approach; it is understood \r\nas a principle of governance in which all persons and \r\ninstitutions, including the State itself, are accountable \r\nto laws that are consistent with human rights.\r\nThe rule of law applies to both the national level \r\nand the international level. Those two levels are not in \r\ncontradiction; they complement each other. The State \r\nremains the cornerstone of that system, which is why it \r\nbears a particular responsibility for the implementation \r\nof the rule of law. At the same time, the principle of \r\nthe rule of law predicates the peaceful coexistence of \r\nnations, and it is thus only natural that this forum — the \r\nUnited Nations — should be the platform for giving the \r\nnecessary impetus to strengthening the rule of law.\r\nFor the sake of coherence, our Organization must \r\nfirst apply to itself the remedy that it advocates. In both \r\ntheir policies and activities, United Nations bodies must \r\nrespect the entirety of the rules of international law.\r\nFinally, civil society, too, has an important role to \r\nplay. It is paramount that civil society be associated \r\nwith the strengthening of the rule of law wherever it \r\ncan provide added value.\r\nThe rule of law is a cross-cutting principle; it \r\nunderpins a large number of activities that concern a \r\nmultitude of stakeholders. It is not possible to list them \r\nall, so I shall give only a few examples. This year, as we \r\nare celebrating the tenth anniversary of the entry into \r\nforce of the Rome Statute, I would like to raise the issue \r\nof the importance of the International Criminal Court \r\nand its crucial role in the fight against impunity for the \r\nmost serious crimes, namely the crime of genocide, \r\ncrimes against humanity, war crimes and the crime of \r\naggression. I am pleased to announce that Luxembourg \r\nhas pledged to complete, by early next year, the process \r\nof the ratification of the amendments to the Rome \r\nStatute contained in the resolutions adopted at the June \r\n2010 Kampala Review Conference. Those amendments \r\nhave already been implemented in our penal code.\r\nWe also highly value the role of the International \r\nCourt of Justice. Luxembourg was one of the very first \r\nStates to recognize the jurisdiction of the Court as \r\ncompulsory.\r\nStrengthening the rule of law is particularly \r\nimportant for countries emerging from conflict. In order \r\nto ensure sustainable peace, the State must restore the \r\ntrust of its citizens and create an enabling environment \r\nin which the rights of all are respected and protected. \r\nIn that context, Luxembourg pledges to continue \r\nsupporting the Peacebuilding Fund by contributing at \r\nleast 1 million euros for the period 2012-2014.\r\nI have stressed the role of Member States in \r\nstrengthening the rule of law. International rules and \r\nnorms may well exist, but it is up to Member States to \r\nimplement them by ratifying the relevant international \r\ntreaties. I would like to take this opportunity to announce \r\nthat Luxembourg pledges to ratify, as soon as possible, \r\nthe third Optional Protocol to the Convention on the \r\nRights of the Child, on a communications procedure.\r\nIn the Declaration (resolution 67/1) adopted this \r\nmorning (see A/67/PV.3), which was so ably facilitated \r\nby the Permanent Representatives of Denmark and \r\nMexico, we solemnly reaffirm our commitment to the \r\nrule of law. It is my hope that this High-level Meeting \r\nwill provide the impetus for proactive collective \r\naction in order to give the strengthening of the rule of \r\nlaw its rightful place in a transparent and just global \r\ngovernance for the future.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I now give \r\nthe f loor to Mr. Eric Holder, Attorney General of the \r\nUnited States of America.\r\nMr. Holder (United States of America): I am \r\nhonoured to represent the United States at this historic \r\nmeeting on the rule of law, and I want to thank all of \r\nthe leaders gathered here for bringing their voices, their \r\nperspectives and their commitment to this very critical \r\ndiscussion.\r\n8 12-51943\r\nA/67/PV.4\r\nmust continue to be a top priority. It is also why I am \r\nproud to say that, at the international level, the United \r\nStates will continue to support United Nations-led \r\nefforts to expand access to legal aid, to more effectively \r\ncombat drug trafficking and organized crime alongside \r\nour international partners, and to build on United \r\nNations initiatives in the rule of law sector that focus \r\non conflict and post-conflict situations.\r\nWithin our own borders, particularly as we \r\napproach the fiftieth anniversary of the United States \r\nSupreme Court decision guaranteeing indigent criminal \r\ndefendants the right to counsel, the United States also \r\npledges to take steps to improve access to justice for \r\nthose who cannot afford representation. Additionally, \r\nwe are committed to launching a new domestic \r\nviolence prevention initiative, strengthening safety net \r\nprogrammes that help increase the availability of legal \r\naid, and enhancing our focus on protecting the essential \r\nrights of women, as well as girls. \r\nIn those and our other efforts to strengthen the rule \r\nof law and to encourage cooperation on an international \r\nscale, from our work together under the landmark \r\nUnited Nations conventions against crime, terrorism \r\nand corruption to our capacity-building, prosecutorial \r\ntraining and regional assistance efforts, the Department \r\nthat I am privileged to lead and the nation that I am \r\nhonoured to serve are proud to stand with the leaders in \r\nthe Hall. Like those present, we approach the challenges \r\nbefore us with resolve, humility and an eagerness to \r\nreinforce old friendships and to forge new ones. We are \r\neager to join Member States as true and equal partners \r\nin driving this critical work into the future.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I now \r\ngive the f loor to His Excellency Mr. Nikola Poposki, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the former Yugoslav \r\nRepublic of Macedonia.\r\nMr. Poposki (former Yugoslav Republic of \r\nMacedonia): I join other speakers in welcoming this \r\nhigh-level debate aimed at streamlining international \r\nefforts to strengthen the rule of law at both the national \r\nand the international levels. I would also like to join \r\nothers in welcoming the Secretary-General’s report \r\nto the General Assembly of 16 March (A/66/749) and \r\nthe proposals contained therein, inter alia, for the \r\nGeneral Assembly to adopt a programme of action for \r\nthe rule of law, to agree to a process to develop clear \r\nrule of law goals and to adopt various mechanisms to \r\nenhance stakeholder dialogue on the subject, including \r\nHistory has proved that the establishment and the \r\nenforcement of the rule of law is essential in protecting \r\nthe security and civil liberties of our citizens, in \r\ncombating violent crime, public corruption and terrorist \r\nthreats, and in strengthening civil society. In recent \r\ndays, we have been reminded, in the most painful and \r\ntragic of ways, of just how vital the rule of law is to \r\nensuring freedom, opportunity, justice and peace.\r\nI am here to pledge not only the commitment of the \r\nUnited States to these principles, but also our support \r\nfor the robust efforts of the United Nations to strengthen \r\nthe rule of law worldwide.\r\nI would like to assure all participants that my \r\ncolleagues and I are determined to stand with Member \r\nStates and with any nation that strives to ensure integrity, \r\nto foster innovation and to create opportunities for \r\nprosperity and progress. We will also stand with those \r\nGovernments that cherish the benefits of a free, fair and \r\nopen society and that seek to eradicate the corrupt and \r\nabusive activities that can weaken political institutions, \r\nthreaten the democratic process, undermine the \r\nstrength and promise of civil society, and diminish the \r\nquality of life for countless individuals, families and \r\ncommunities. We must all truly serve the people whom \r\nwe are privileged to represent.\r\nFrom our national systems to the United Nations \r\nwork in advancing the goals of international peace and \r\nsecurity, human rights for all people, including women, \r\nlesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals and \r\npersons with disabilities, economic development and \r\njob creation, we have seen time and time again that \r\nthere is a strong link between fostering democratic \r\nvalues and supporting the rule of law. In recent years \r\nin particular, our commitment to the rule of law has \r\nhelped to inform, augment and re-energize our work \r\nin confronting a range of challenges: from fighting \r\ncrime, corruption and terrorism and promoting global \r\nsecurity and good governance to ensuring equality and \r\nfair opportunity for all.\r\nToday’s meeting underscores the fact that such \r\nwork must remain at the centre of how nations approach \r\ndevelopment, especially in conflict-affected or fragile \r\nStates. As the World Bank’s recent 2012 World \r\nDevelopment Report highlighted, it also reaffirms that, \r\nin today’s world, the greatest threat to development and \r\nrecovery is a weak rule of law.\r\nThat is why the promise that we have gathered to \r\nfulfil and the pledges that we are here to make are and \r\n12-51943 9\r\nA/67/PV.4\r\nmain pillars of United Nations action — peace and \r\nsecurity, human rights and development.\r\nLet me conclude by quoting Thomas Hobbes: \r\n“Ignorance of the law is no good excuse, where every \r\nman is bound to take notice of the laws to which he is \r\nsubject.” The same applies to States.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I now \r\ngive the f loor to His Excellency Mr. Enrique Castillo, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Costa \r\nRica.\r\nMr. Castillo (Costa Rica) (spoke in Spanish): I \r\ncome to this meeting today to reiterate the unwavering \r\ncommitment of Costa Rica to the rule of law as the \r\nnorm that anchors democratic life, a driving force for \r\nhuman rights, a key factor in development, a guiding \r\ninstrument for peaceful coexistence among peoples and \r\nnations and the cornerstone of the multilateral system. I \r\nalso come with the commitment to continue cooperating \r\nwith the United Nations to promote the rule of law at \r\nthe national and the international levels. That objective \r\nis a priority of our society and of our foreign policy.\r\nWe are satisfied that, following intense and \r\nconstructive negotiations, today’s meeting has adopted \r\nan outcome Declaration (resolution 67/1), on which, \r\nas Member States, we can all agree.  Costa Rica had \r\ngreater ambitions for the Declaration’s content, yet we \r\naccept it nonetheless with satisfaction, recognizing \r\nthat it represents a clear step forward in this matter. \r\nIt is, moreover, a base on which we must continue to \r\nbuild, within the Organization and, above all, within \r\nour respective countries.\r\nI would like to recognize and thank the intense, \r\ntransparent and effective efforts undertaken by the \r\nco-facilitators of the document, Ambassadors Luis-\r\nAlfonso de Alba of Mexico and Carsten Staur of \r\nDenmark. We would like to welcome yet again the \r\nprogramme of action to strengthen the rule of law at \r\nthe national and international levels, presented by the \r\nSecretary-General in his report (A/66/749). In that \r\nrespect, the work of the Secretariat and in particular \r\nits Rule of Law Unit has been pivotal. However, very \r\nlittle could be achieved without the participation and \r\nconviction of Member States. \r\nFor Costa Rica, national law is the explicit \r\nmanifestation of our social contract as an unarmed \r\ndemocracy and defender of human rights. International \r\nlaw, in turn, is the foundation of our external security \r\nand the cornerstone of our relations with other \r\ndeveloping corresponding benchmarks and indicators \r\nto measure progress.\r\nThe Republic of Macedonia is fully committed \r\nto the purposes and principles of the United Nations \r\nCharter and international law. We firmly believe that \r\nan international order based on the rule of law is a \r\nprerequisite for a more just and prosperous world \r\nand to ensuring peaceful relations among States and \r\ntheir peaceful settlement of disputes. In that regard, \r\nUnited Nations States Members and the Organization’s \r\nprincipal organs share the same responsibility to abide \r\nby the principles enshrined in the Charter.\r\nEnsuring a stronger rule of law at the international \r\nand national levels entails creating mechanisms to \r\nstrengthen international adjudicative dispute resolution, \r\nin particular the role of the International Court of \r\nJustice as the principal judiciary organ of the United \r\nNations, by ensuring the effective implementation of \r\nits decisions by all parties concerned. The Republic of \r\nMacedonia clearly supports respecting international \r\ncommitments and the judgements of the Court. \r\nFurthermore, we support the recommendation \r\nof the Secretary-General that, for the International \r\nCourt of Justice to strengthen its role in international \r\nrelations and to increase the legitimacy and compliance \r\nof actions taken by the principal organs of the United \r\nNations with international law, where appropriate, those \r\nbodies should make greater use of the ability to request \r\nadvisory opinions from the Court so as to ensure that \r\nthe international legal system is equally accessible and \r\nthat international law is not selectively applied.\r\nThe Republic of Macedonia supports the efforts \r\nof the Secretary-General to launch a campaign to \r\nincrease the number of Member States that accept the \r\ncompulsory jurisdiction of the International Court \r\nof Justice, pursuant to Article 36 of the Statute. By \r\naccepting its compulsory jurisdiction, my country is \r\nfully aware that such optional declarations are the best \r\nway to ensure that international disputes are settled \r\npeacefully in accordance with international law.\r\nMy country welcomes the Declaration that we \r\nhave adopted at this High-level Meeting, which was \r\ndrafted in an extensive and inclusive consultative \r\nprocess over the past couple of months (resolution \r\n67/1). The Declaration is action-oriented and provides \r\na comprehensive platform for further activities to \r\nbe carried out at international and national levels to \r\nstrengthen the rule of law and its impact on the three \r\n10 12-51943\r\nA/67/PV.4\r\ncountries. The local and global dimensions of legality \r\nare indivisible. Hence, the synergy between the national \r\nand international rule of law must go beyond the \r\nratification of multilateral agreements. That synergy \r\nalso requires the development of domestic legislation \r\nand institutions in order to strengthen democracy, \r\npromote peace, respect human dignity and drive \r\ndevelopment that is dynamic, sustainable and inclusive.\r\nAchieving consistency between obligations \r\nunder international conventions and national laws \r\nand practices is the responsibility of all States. The \r\nConstitution of Costa Rica grants international human \r\nrights instruments constitutional rank. Furthermore, \r\nour constitutional jurisprudence confers on those \r\ninstruments a supra-constitutional value, insofar as \r\nthey grant greater rights or guarantees. In 1973, our \r\ncountry accepted the compulsory jurisdiction of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, the highest body for \r\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes between States. \r\nToday we reiterate our trust in the Court and recall that \r\nabiding by its decisions, fully and without exception, \r\nis an obligation of every State, emanating from the \r\nCharter of the United Nations.\r\nDemocracy is the philosophical foundation that \r\nlegitimizes constitutional and legal norms. Freely \r\nelected parliaments are its principal bulwarks, as \r\nrepresentatives of the principle of popular sovereignty. \r\nCompliance with norms should be equally applicable to \r\nall citizens and entities. No one should be above the law, \r\nand leaders have a particular duty to fulfil those norms \r\nand be accountable for their actions. Transparency is \r\npart of legality.\r\nImpunity, however, is a mockery of the rule of \r\nlaw, and that mockery is an offence to justice when \r\nthe worst crimes against humanity go unpunished. \r\nCosta Rica is therefore profoundly committed to the \r\nInternational Criminal Court, which is one of the \r\ngreatest achievements of the multilateral system since \r\nthe creation of the United Nations. \r\nThe universal values of justice provide not only \r\na conceptual basis for the organization of States, but \r\nthey are also a necessity for every human being and \r\nall peoples of the United Nations. We must focus our \r\nattention, our commitment and our work towards them. \r\nCosta Rica reiterates its commitment to do just that.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I now \r\ngive the f loor to His Excellency Mr. Didier Reynders, \r\nDeputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nand Institutional Reform of the Kingdom of Belgium.\r\nMr.  Reynders (Belgium) (spoke in French): The \r\nrule of law, human rights and democracy are inextricably \r\nlinked and are mutually reinforcing. They lie at the very \r\nheart of the values and principles of the United Nations. \r\nWhile being a value and goal in itself, the rule of law \r\nis also an instrument guaranteeing the sustainability \r\nof our other core values: human rights and democracy. \r\nThe rule of law is, therefore, decisive in strengthening \r\nthe three pillars of our Organization, namely, peace and \r\nsecurity, economic and social development and human \r\nrights.\r\nWith regard to international peace and security, \r\nevery day the news reminds us of the human cost of \r\nfailure to respect international rules and norms. Do we \r\nneed reminding of the intolerable suffering inflicted \r\nby the Syrian regime on its own population? Those \r\ndespicable acts are an insult to the global conscience. \r\nInternational law must be respected and applied by all. \r\nOtherwise the international community, including the \r\nSecurity Council, must assume its responsibilities. \r\nI call on all parties to conflicts to respect \r\ninternational humanitarian law in all circumstances \r\nand to refrain in particular from any forms of violence \r\nagainst women and children and sexual violence. Just a \r\nfew weeks ago I witnessed at first hand the unspeakable \r\nsuffering of the populations in the combat zones of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and in the Great \r\nLakes region. Strengthening the rule of law is, in my \r\nopinion, a key component of preventing conflicts and \r\nmass atrocities. \r\nIn that connection, one of the most crucial \r\nresponsibilities of each State is to protect its own \r\npopulation from the most serious crimes. But the \r\nrule of law, including transitional justice, plays a \r\ndefining role in creating lasting peace in post-conflict \r\nsituations. There can be no sustainable development \r\nwithout genuine rule of law. Businessmen and investors \r\nneed legal security and a climate conducive to business. \r\nIf corruption reigns and justice cannot function \r\nindependently, then the economy cannot develop.\r\nThe economic and social costs of the law of “might \r\nis right” are enormous. Such exercise of power does \r\nnothing but cripple the economic progress of societies. \r\nThat is why Belgium wants that facet of the rule of law \r\nto be clearly reflected in the post-2015 international \r\ndevelopment agenda. Well-established rule of law is \r\n12-51943 11\r\nA/67/PV.4\r\namendments adopted in Kampala. I call on other States \r\nparties to do likewise. \r\nBy virtue of the complementarity that underpins \r\nthe Statute of the Court, States bear primary \r\nresponsibility for prosecuting the perpetrators of the \r\nmost serious crimes. With a view to contributing to \r\nefforts to enhance national capacities in that respect, \r\nBelgium, with Slovenia and the Netherlands, proposes \r\nto improve the international framework for judicial aid \r\nand extradition through the negotiation and adoption \r\nof a new international legal instrument. I call on the \r\ncomity of States to support that initiative. Belgium \r\nremains ready to cooperate with the United Nations and \r\nother Member States, through strengthening the rule of \r\nlaw at all levels, to build a more just, more prosperous, \r\nmore peaceful and more humane world.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I now \r\ngive the f loor to His Excellency Mr. Titus Corlăţean, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Romania.\r\n Mr. Corlăţean (Romania): It is a great honour \r\nfor me to address some of the key aspects of the topic \r\nchosen for the High-level Meeting this year: the rule of \r\nlaw. As a lawyer and former minister of justice, I am \r\npersonally attached to this value.\r\nIt is Romania’s firm belief that respect for and \r\npromotion of the rule of law are outstanding objectives \r\nthat must guide all our endeavours. At the national \r\nlevel, the rule of law translates, on a conceptual \r\nbasis, the need for a stable and predictable legal and \r\nconstitutional framework respected by all actors of \r\nsociety and guarded by an independent justice system. \r\nAt the international level, the concept of the rule of law \r\ncreates an adequate framework for political dialogue, \r\ncooperation, peace and security.\r\nAllow me to share certain aspects of Romania’s \r\nexperience in strengthening the rule of law. \r\nOver the past two decades, we have been engaged \r\nin steadfast endeavours to promote and consolidate \r\nthe principles encompassed by the concept, such as \r\nsupremacy of law, separation of powers, equality before \r\nthe law, accountability to the law, legal certainty and \r\ntransparency. This process is continuing, with a focus \r\non furthering the implementation of these fundamental \r\nprinciples. It is our firm commitment to strengthen the \r\nrule of law, building upon the results obtained so far, \r\nin order to achieve more social justice and  to ensure \r\nsustainable development of society as a whole.  I have \r\nindispensable to achieving equitable, inclusive, just and \r\nlasting economic growth. In that respect, the rule of \r\nlaw specifically means establishing robust institutions \r\naccessible to all, operating with transparency and \r\nguided by just laws. That requires the adoption \r\nand implementation of stable, predicable social and \r\ncommercial legislation that stimulates business and \r\nemployment. \r\nThe rule of law is fundamental to respect for \r\nhuman rights. The many treaties and conventions \r\nare safeguards for setting the rules of the game and \r\nprotecting the most vulnerable in our societies. The \r\nprescriptive role of the United Nations should be noted \r\nin that context. But there is no doubt that what is \r\nimportant is the specific application of the law. More \r\nand more citizens worldwide have the right to freely \r\nchoose their representatives. That must be commended. \r\nHowever, true rule of law cannot be confined to only \r\nelection day. It involves a process where election day \r\nis but the culmination. In that context, I condemn any \r\nattempt to call into question the system of checks and \r\nbalances.\r\nIn all of those spheres we, as political leaders, \r\nbear a major responsibility. It is our duty to ensure \r\nrespect for and strengthening of the rule of law in \r\nall its dimensions, both in our own societies and in \r\ninternational relations. Belgium therefore thanks the \r\nSecretary-General for having placed this key question \r\nhigh on the General Assembly’s agenda. His excellent \r\nreport (A/66/749) has provided us with an ambitious \r\nvision of a more just world. My country supports that \r\nvision unconditionally. However, we regret that the \r\noutcome document (resolution 67/1) does not fully \r\nreflect the proposed level of ambition.\r\nIt is our fervent hope that the mobilization generated \r\nby the high-level event can receive concrete follow-up \r\nwithin the United Nations system and, above all, on \r\nthe ground. Along those lines, Belgium has answered \r\nthe call of the Secretary-General and has drawn up \r\n17 specific commitments in the field of rule of law.\r\nWhile fully associating myself with the statement \r\nmade by the President of the European Commission, \r\nMr. Barroso, on behalf of the European Union, I \r\nwould like to conclude my intervention by reaffirming \r\nBelgium’s commitment in the fight against impunity. \r\nThe International Criminal Court has shown that \r\nit can contribute to the inauguration of the age of \r\nresponsibility. Cooperation of all States with the Court \r\nis vital. Belgium is committed to ratifying by 2015 the \r\n12 12-51943\r\nA/67/PV.4\r\nto peace and stability, is undisputed. Romania, for its \r\npart, is a firm supporter of the Court. I am happy to \r\nannounce our intention to initiate an internal debate \r\nconcerning the possibility of accepting the compulsory \r\njurisdiction of the Court.\r\nI would like to recall the words of one of the greatest \r\nRomanian diplomats and jurists of the interwar period, \r\nVespasian V. Pella, who contributed greatly to the idea \r\nof a permanent international criminal court and to the \r\nfoundation of international criminal law. As early as \r\n1925, Vespasian Pella stated that,\r\n(spoke in French)\r\n“the fundamental axiom so often repeated, that \r\ncriminals exist and will always exist in national \r\nsocieties as well as within international societies, \r\nconfirms to us the need for an international \r\ncriminal policy.” \r\n(spoke in English)\r\nToday it appears more evident than ever that \r\nconsolidating the International Criminal Court and \r\nenhancing its universality are the necessary means for \r\nfostering a preventive approach towards compliance \r\nwith the most important norms of international law. It \r\nis our belief that the role of the United Nations is and \r\nshould remain central in boosting the efforts of Member \r\nStates in strengthening rule of law at the global level. \r\nI also wish to underline the need for a cross-\r\nthematic dialogue on the rule of law within the General \r\nAssembly in pursuit of greater coherence in future \r\nUnited Nations activities related to the rule of law. \r\nI also welcome and support the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s initiative to create a United Nations platform \r\nfor voluntary pledges, and I would like to announce \r\nRomania’s pledges. \r\nI can only conclude by remarking on the dynamism \r\nof the concept of the rule of law, which is, in essence, \r\nthe result of significant historic evolutions in the field \r\nof cooperation among States in a desire to ensure peace \r\nand security, stability and prosperity, as well as a great \r\nrespect for human rights.\r\nAs a European Union member State, we align \r\nourselves with the statement delivered earlier today on \r\nbehalf of the European Union.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I now \r\ngive the f loor to the representative of the Republic of \r\nthe Sudan. \r\nchosen four directions of action that can prove our \r\ndetermination. \r\nThe fi rst is to fi ght corruption and promote integrity. \r\nAlthough the process is long-term and comprehensive, \r\nI can state that just recently, stronger legislation to \r\npromote public integrity and the comprehensive 2012-\r\n2015 National Anti-Corruption Strategy have been \r\nadopted.\r\nThe second direction is the stability and \r\npredictability of the legal framework. An important \r\nresult of Romania’s ambitious legislative agenda is the \r\nadoption of four new codes in criminal and civil law, in \r\nview of the need to modernize the judicial process and \r\nenhance legal certainty. \r\nThe third direction, and maybe the most important, \r\nis the independence of justice. Today, I am more \r\nconvinced than ever that an independent and reliable \r\njustice system is of utmost importance for the \r\nfunctioning of the State. Recent debates in our country \r\nhave shown that full compliance by all legal and \r\npolitical actors with the decisions of the highest court, \r\nthe Constitutional Court, is the fundamental pillar of a \r\ndemocratic society based on rule of law.\r\nThe fourth direction, transparency towards citizens \r\nand civil society, has been highlighted as one of the \r\nbasic principles of the Government’s 2012 Programme. \r\nI wish to continue by sharing Romania’s view on \r\nthe concept of the rule of law at the international level. \r\nThe rule of law contains significant relevant elements \r\nthat regulate the conduct of relations among States \r\nand constitutes a core, universal and indivisible value \r\nof the United Nations. States must comply with their \r\nobligations arising from the Charter of the United \r\nNations, treaties and customary international law, thus \r\nensuring predictability in international relations.\r\nI commend the recent report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral (A/66/749). I consider that each and every \r\nrecommendation it contains  is very important for \r\nachieving tangible progress in the United Nations \r\nagenda on the rule of law. It is our firm belief that in \r\nthe efforts to consolidate the rule of law, the role of \r\nthe international courts and tribunals should also be \r\nstrengthened.\r\nThe role of the International Court of Justice \r\nin promoting the rule of law, through applying the \r\nprinciples and norms of international law and thus \r\ncontributing to friendly relations among States and \r\n12-51943 13\r\nA/67/PV.4\r\nfocusing on the more vulnerable groups by allowing \r\nthem to have equal access to justice. \r\nWith regard to promoting the rule of law at the \r\ninternational level, we believe in the importance of \r\nrespecting international law and its principles. We stress \r\nthe principles of the Charter of the United Nations. We \r\nbelieve in the right of the State to guarantee justice and \r\nits sovereignty. We also believe in the importance of the \r\npeaceful settlement of international disputes. We stress \r\nthe role of the International Court of Justice, whose \r\nrole we must promote. Regional and international \r\ncooperation, on the basis of the principles of national \r\nsovereignty and renouncing unilateral actions taken \r\nby some States against others, is of fundamental \r\nimportance. Such action is considered a violation \r\nof international law. We reiterate the importance of \r\nreforming international institutions, including the \r\nUnited Nations. We need to promote the principles of \r\ntransparency and democracy through the participation \r\nof the States in the adoption of resolutions. In that \r\nregard, we must improve the adoption of resolutions in \r\nthe Security Council. The Council must play its role \r\nin upholding international security. Avoiding those \r\nprinciples only exacerbates international conflicts.\r\nWe meet today to promote the rule of law and \r\njustice. We endorse what was said by those countries \r\nthat voiced their concerns about the politicization \r\nof international justice and the use of the principles \r\nof justice as a means of fomenting political conflict \r\nbetween States with a view to sanctioning the weak and \r\nignoring violations committed by the strongest. \r\nI wish to make an appeal for this occasion to be a \r\ncall for support for the oppressed, those living under \r\nthe yoke of occupation in many parts of the world, \r\nespecially in Palestine. We support equality for all \r\nbefore the law.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I now give \r\nthe f loor to His Excellency Mr. Pascal Canfin, Minister \r\nDelegate for Development of France. \r\nMr. Canfin (France) (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of France, I welcome the initiative taken by \r\nthe General Assembly to organize this first High-\r\nlevel Meeting on the Rule of Law at the National and \r\nInternational Levels. As underscored in the Declaration \r\nadopted today (resolution 67/1), this event concerns all \r\nindividuals, institutions, public and private entities and \r\nthe State itself. It will have made it possible to show \r\nthat there is international consensus on the following \r\nMr. El-Nor  (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): Allow me \r\nto speak on behalf of His Excellency Mr. Ali Ahmed \r\nKarti, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of \r\nthe Sudan. It is my pleasure to address Member States \r\nat this High-level Meeting of the General Assembly \r\non the Rule of Law at the National and International \r\nLevels, which voices the concerns of the world’s leaders \r\nwith regard to the law and the principle of justice, in \r\naddition to the collective efforts that are being made \r\nwith a view to promoting the rule of law at the national \r\nand international levels.\r\nThe Sudan believes in the importance of the \r\nrule of law as a principle of governance whereby all \r\nindividuals and institutions are on equal footing under \r\nthe absolute authority of independent justice. The \r\nSudan has experienced several legal and legislative \r\ndevelopments in recent years. Those changes have \r\nshown that the State and society are moving towards \r\nenshrining the culture of peace and the importance of \r\nlaw at the international and national levels in order to \r\nconsolidate peace, justice and respect for human rights, \r\nwith a view to peacefully resolving differences in all \r\ntheir aspects while respecting justice. Those changes \r\nhelped us to adopt a transitional Constitution in 2005, \r\nas well as  laws ensuring respect for international legal \r\nnorms. \r\nThe legal political parties in the Sudan are working \r\nintensively and in broad consultations with various \r\nsectors of Sudanese society, both with the Government \r\nand with civil society, with a view to achieving a \r\npermanent constitution in the light of the recent political \r\ndevelopments in our country, including the separation \r\nof South Sudan. Through a new a constitution, we seek \r\nto enshrine the values of freedom and the rule of law, \r\nin addition to the independence of the justice system \r\nand the protection of human rights, while respecting \r\nnorms, conventions and international agreements \r\nthrough international law. We are pleased to say that \r\nwe have always been an effective actor at regional and \r\ninternational levels in various fields, above all when \r\nit comes to human rights conventions and combating \r\nterrorism and corruption, as well as with regard to arms \r\nconventions and nuclear proliferation instruments. We \r\nhave incorporated most of those conventions into our \r\nnational law through legislative action. \r\nWe are endeavouring to improve legislative \r\nperformance and legal training through strategies to \r\nimprove traditional justice mechanisms. That is taking \r\nplace concurrently with the work of the State and while \r\n14 12-51943\r\nA/67/PV.4\r\ngender identity among the foreign policy priorities of \r\nthe new French Government. We have set the abolition \r\nof the death penalty as an absolute priority by launching \r\na global campaign for its universal abolition.\r\nThe second topic that I would like to underscore is \r\nthe role of the rule of law in the development agenda. \r\nThe Secretary-General has set up a high-level panel, \r\nwhich will make to him recommendations on post-\r\n2015 development. We will certainly not prejudge a \r\ndiscussion that is under way. However, it is no longer \r\nconceivable that such discussions do not include the \r\nrule of law dimension. National and international \r\ndevelopment strategies must necessarily be founded on \r\na robust normative framework that respects the rights \r\nof all.\r\nState-building, legal security conducive to \r\nexchange and the ability of everyone to participate in \r\nthe decision-making process are crucial conditions for \r\ndevelopment. In our view, that is also the direction of the \r\nArab Spring. Our Declaration had therefore to make that \r\nlink between the rule of law and development. Thanks \r\nto the efforts of the Mexican and Danish co-facilitators, \r\nour Declaration reflects such associations among the \r\nrule of law, the fair provision of basic public services \r\nand development.\r\nIn its bilateral projects, France ensures respect for \r\nthe principles of the rule of law, namely, human rights, \r\nan independent judiciary and access to justice for all. \r\nGiving priority to such universal precepts does not, \r\nhowever, mean imposing or setting any single model. \r\nWe must, of course, unite both common standards \r\nand the diversity of national experiences. We must \r\ntake into account the multiple sources of law, as we \r\nare doing in Afghanistan and in a law centre project \r\nin Senegal, for example. We involve all actors — civil \r\nsociety, parliamentarians, academics and journalists \r\nactors — and propose responses adapted to local \r\nrealities, such as in the area of land. \r\nEstablishing the rule of law specifically means \r\nenabling the user, the taxpayer and the defendant to \r\ndemand that public officials be accountable. Such \r\ncitizen power, such accountability, is a prerequisite \r\nfor transparency, the fight against corruption and, \r\nultimately, sustainable development. France supports \r\nthe work of non-governmental organizations in that \r\nregard, including the “Publish what you pay” coalition. \r\nThe third topic, which stems from the two preceding \r\nones, is the criminal responsibility of those who contest \r\nfundamental principles: the right of all citizens to equal \r\nprotection before the law, without any discrimination, \r\nand the responsibility of the State and of Governments, \r\nwhich must be accountable to their peoples. \r\nOn behalf of France, I would like to mention three \r\nkey topics for our discussion. The first topic is the \r\nimportance of having an international legal framework. \r\nSince 1945, States have set up a body of exceptional \r\ninternational standards. The Geneva Conventions \r\nare universal instruments. The two International \r\nCovenants on Human Rights; the Convention on the \r\nPrevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide; \r\nthe Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, \r\nInhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment; \r\nthe Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of \r\nDiscrimination against Women; and the Convention on \r\nthe Rights of the Child are a framework of reference \r\nfor Governments, as well as for civil society, tribunals, \r\nparliaments, heads of State, and mere citizens.\r\nThe usefulness of today’s event consists in \r\nmobilizing us to strengthen that normative framework \r\nand its implementation, for there are still entire realms \r\nof activity without any legal security. International law \r\nis lacking when it comes to the plundering of natural \r\nresources, for example, or the trafficking in wildlife. The \r\nSecretary-General has proposed a programme of action \r\nto complement and better implement international law. \r\nFrance thanks him for that and we would like to pay \r\ntribute to his personal commitment. We also welcome \r\nthe way in which United Nations organs, such as the \r\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly, have \r\nbeen mobilized in recent months to apply the law and \r\nto respond to the democratic aspirations of Libyan \r\ncitizens, as well as the battered Syrian people. The \r\nUnited Nations must remain central in the promotion \r\nof the rule of law. We will support Deputy Secretary-\r\nGeneral Eliasson in his role as coordinator of such a \r\nsystem.\r\nFor its part, bearing in mind the recommendations \r\nof the Secretariat, France has committed to considering \r\nratifying certain protocols and of withdrawing \r\nsome reservations and interpretative declarations. \r\nWith Argentina, we have sponsored the most recent \r\ninternational instruments, namely, the International \r\nConvention for the Protection of All Persons from \r\nEnforced Disappearance. Today, France is committed \r\nto promoting the universality of that instrument. We \r\nhave also included the fight against violence and \r\ndiscrimination as a result of sexual orientation or \r\n12-51943 15\r\nA/67/PV.4\r\ninternational level underpins the Charter of the United \r\nNations.\r\nIn our view, the promotion of and respect for the \r\nrule of law at the international level involve gradual \r\nand universal acceptance of international law by \r\nStates and their subsequent compliance with their \r\nobligations under that law. In that connection, respect \r\nfor international treaties is fundamental, with which \r\nStates parties, in addition to being bound by them, must \r\ncomply in good faith. In that regard, we underscore the \r\nneed for compliance with border treaties and for the \r\nstability of such boundaries.\r\nThe universal acceptance of multilateral \r\ninternational treaties, which govern matters of interest \r\nto the international community as a whole, should be an \r\nobjective of States Members of the United Nations. The \r\nGeneral Assembly must play a role in that regard by \r\nencouraging States to conclude, ratify and/or accede to \r\nsuch treaties. That will constitute specific action by the \r\nAssembly to promote the rule of law and international \r\nlaw.\r\nIn addition, enhancement of the rule of law at the \r\ninternational level necessarily means the strengthening \r\nand use of the means to peacefully settle disputes \r\nprovided for in the Charter on the basis of the principle \r\nof free choice of those means. In that context, we \r\nunderscore the work of international courts, in particular \r\nthe International Court of Justice, the principal judicial \r\norgan of the United Nations, both in its adversarial \r\nwork and in exercising its advisory functions. Chile \r\nacknowledges the work of the Court and its contribution \r\nto international law through its valuable jurisprudence.\r\nWe also welcome the existence of and the work done \r\nby important special courts, such as the International \r\nTribunal for the Law of the Sea, regional human rights \r\ncourts, ad hoc international criminal courts and the \r\nInternational Criminal Court. The latter is today \r\nthe most advanced expression of the development of \r\ninternational criminal justice. For my Government, it \r\nis one of the most significant recent initiatives. From \r\nthe point of view of the protection of human rights, \r\nthe establishment of the Court is a milestone in the \r\nfight against impunity and a clear demonstration that \r\nits States parties are committed to the international \r\ncommunity moving forward in that direction.\r\nWe also recognize the importance of the rule of \r\nlaw at the national level. It is inconceivable that such \r\na precept should be developed only at the international \r\nthe principles of the rule of law and bring to trial the \r\ncitizens whom they should serve. For some years, this \r\nOrganization has entered a period that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral calls the age of responsibility. It is the era \r\nof the Rome Statute of the International Criminal \r\nCourt, which came into force in 2005, and the age of \r\nthe responsibility to protect, declared in 2005 in the \r\nWorld Summit Outcome Document (resolution 60/1). \r\nThe fight against the impunity of those who commit \r\nhuman rights violations is not only a moral and legal \r\nobligation. It is also a new way to approach conflicts \r\nby denying the perpetrators of genocide, crime against \r\nhumanity and war crimes any legitimacy.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to recall the six \r\ncommitments made by France at the Summit: promoting \r\nthe Convention on enforced disappearance; supporting \r\nthe International Criminal Court, working for the right \r\nto truth; implementing action plans against racism and \r\nanti-Semitism and against discrimination on the basis \r\nof sexual orientation and gender; campaigning for the \r\nabolition of the death penalty; and ensuring the respect \r\nand promotion of international humanitarian law in all \r\ncircumstances. That is an ambitious programme, for \r\nwhich we, for our part, are ready to be accountable in \r\nfuture debates before this Assembly.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I now \r\ngive the f loor to His Excellency Mr. Alfredo Moreno \r\nCharme, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic \r\nof Chile. \r\nMr. Moreno Charme (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nOne of the greatest challenges to the international \r\ncommunity in the twenty-first century is strengthening \r\nthe international legal order and the rule of law. \r\nChile attaches the greatest importance to this High-\r\nlevel Meeting on the Rule of Law at the National and \r\nInternational Levels. The rule of law is essential to \r\nthe peaceful coexistence of peoples, their governance, \r\nrespect for human rights and the economic and social \r\ndevelopment of all peoples. \r\nFor our country, the rule of law must prevail both in \r\ninternational relations and within States. Its observance \r\nat the international level is crucial to the peaceful \r\ndevelopment of relations among peoples, peace and \r\nthe stability of nations. The rule of law, reflected in \r\nthe respect of international law and international \r\ntreaties, and the pacific settlement of disputes are part \r\nof the foundation of international coexistence. As the \r\nSecretary-General has stated, the rule of law at the \r\n16 12-51943\r\nA/67/PV.4\r\nlevel without, at the same time, being observed at the \r\nnational level. That is a prerequisite for internal peace \r\nand, at the same time, strengthens international peace. \r\nThe rule of law at the domestic level is intrinsically \r\nlinked to the rule of law at the international level. The \r\ntwo cannot be separated. There will be respect for \r\ninternational law if the rule of law at the domestic level \r\nis allowed to develop in the normal fashion. Ultimately, \r\ninternational law can function properly only if the \r\nrule of law functions effectively and properly at the \r\ndomestic level.\r\nMoreover, the rule of law at the domestic level is \r\nessentially nurtured by representative democracy, the \r\nvalue that ensures most exactly its proper exercise. \r\nAs stated in the Inter-American Democratic Charter, \r\ndemocracy is strengthened and deepened by permanent, \r\nethical and responsible participation of the citizenry \r\nwithin a legal framework conforming to the respective \r\nconstitutional order. Respect for human rights is part \r\nof that.\r\nThe appropriate establishment and functioning \r\nof national organs and institutions, as well as the \r\nsubordination of all authorities and judiciaries to \r\ndomestic regulations, are essential for the normal \r\ndevelopment of the rule of law at the domestic level. It \r\nis also essential to have an autonomous and independent \r\njudicial system, with legitimacy to act. The very \r\nexistence of the relevant responsibilities, in accordance \r\nwith which all persons, whatever their rank, answer to \r\njudicial authorities who apply the law equally to all, is \r\nalso an essential prerequisite.\r\nThe United Nations, particularly the General \r\nAssembly, must continue to promote reflection on this \r\nissue. It must also promote the conditions under which \r\nits Members can respect the rule of law at the domestic \r\nlevel and the means and mechanisms through which \r\nthey are able to do so. In this connection, we support \r\nthe idea of States working effectively together. The \r\npromotion of dialogue is crucial in this respect.\r\nOur country reiterates its firm commitment to \r\nstrengthening the rule of law at the national and \r\ninternational levels and announces that it will continue \r\nto work towards this goal.\r\nMy Government believes that the promotion of \r\nand respect for the rule of law should be reflected in \r\nconcrete actions. We therefore welcome the idea that \r\nStates make pledges at this high-level meeting. In this \r\nconnection, my country pledges to work actively to \r\ndevelop national legislation to implement the Rome \r\nStatute, specifically by submitting draft legislation on \r\ncooperation with the International Criminal Court to \r\nthe National Congress by 30 June 2013.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I now \r\ngive the f loor to His Excellency Mr. Zalmai Rassoul, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Afghanistan. \r\nMr. Rassoul (Afghanistan): Afghanistan welcomes \r\ntoday’s high-level meeting, which is a manifestation of \r\nour shared conviction that strengthening the rule of law, \r\nnationally and internationally, is to our mutual benefit. \r\nOver the course of the past six decades, the United \r\nNations has made great progress in securing peace, \r\nsafeguarding fundamental freedoms and assisting \r\ncountries emerging from conflict. The rule of law has \r\nbeen a fundamental basis for all those achievements. \r\nIn short, we can say that the rule of law is the very \r\nbedrock on which peaceful, stable and harmonious \r\nsocieties f lourish.\r\nFor Afghanistan, upholding the rule of law is an \r\nessential component of our transition from a society \r\nravaged by decades of conflict and war to one where \r\nwe are working to take on the security, development \r\nand justice challenges that remain. Our efforts to \r\nrebuild began with State institutions that were either \r\nnon-existent or severely weakened.\r\nOver the past years, we have made progress in \r\nbuilding the capacity of our justice sector to ensure \r\nimproved rule of law. This principle is embedded in \r\nthe Afghanistan National Development Strategy. We \r\nhave taken wide-ranging measures in support of an \r\nindependent, more transparent, impartial and credible \r\njustice sector, including the adoption of a Constitution \r\nthat safeguards the rights of all citizens; an overhaul of \r\nour national legal framework; and the development of \r\nnational action plans to restructure and build capacity \r\nin our ministries.\r\nEnding impunity is an important step in building \r\npublic confidence and trust in our justice and security \r\nsectors. To that end, the newly drafted criminal \r\nprocedure code was presented this year to the National \r\nAssembly and is expected to be placed on the legislative \r\nagenda soon. Several working groups have also been \r\ncontinuing their efforts to revise the penal code in \r\norder to strengthen the protection of all citizens, with \r\nparticular focus on the rights of women and children. \r\nWe have made considerable progress in broadening \r\nparticipation in education, in particular higher education, \r\n12-51943 17\r\nA/67/PV.4\r\nwhere the judges and lawyers of tomorrow will be \r\ntrained. Through these gains and many others, we \r\nare rebuilding the necessary tools and institutions to \r\nensure the rule of law as a solid basis on which to build \r\nsustainable peace.\r\nThe chance to live in peace and security is a \r\nfundamental right of all peoples. The people of \r\nAfghanistan desire nothing more than the chance to \r\nlive in a violence-free environment. In that regard, \r\nAfghanistan’s security sector reform, initiated in 2001, \r\nhas led to the formation of a national army and police in \r\nwhose ranks the diversity of the country is represented. \r\nConsistent with the transition process, our security \r\nforces are taking increased responsibility — backed by \r\npublic confidence in them — to meet the security needs \r\nof our people in our villages, towns and provinces.\r\nFor the past decade, we have been studiously \r\nengaged in combating corruption, an ill that has had \r\na drastic effect on our governance, stability and \r\nprosperity. It harms Afghans first and foremost. \r\nDefeating the menace of corruption therefore remains \r\na high priority for my Government. We have taken a \r\nnumber of measures to achieve a fully transparent \r\nadministration, the most recent of which was the \r\nissuance of a presidential decree this past July directing \r\nall ministries, agencies and independent directorates to \r\nundertake comprehensive reforms and other measures \r\nto defeat corruption and strengthen transparency.\r\nAfghanistan is party to a multitude of relevant \r\ntreaties and conventions that seek to uphold and \r\npromote the rule of law in a wide array of spheres. \r\nWe recognize that signing and ratifying treaties is not \r\nenough and that rights and obligations arising from \r\ninternational instruments must be implemented through \r\nnational legislation. It is for that reason that President \r\nKarzai has instructed the Ministry of Justice to actively \r\ntake forward the process of ensuring that our national \r\nlegislation is in full conformity with our international \r\ncommitments.\r\nThe Secretary-General has announced strengthening \r\ncompliance in the context of the United Nations a \r\npriority in the field of the rule of law at the international \r\nlevel. Achieving a reformed Security Council with a \r\nview to increasing its representation and transparency \r\nand furthering its effectiveness is of utmost importance. \r\nAfghanistan has taken a lead role in chairing the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform, and we stand ready to ensure that this vital \r\nreform of the Security Council strengthens and \r\nenhances the United Nations ability to promote and \r\nuphold the rule of law at the international level.\r\nWe highlight the importance of the International \r\nCriminal Court (ICC) in promoting international \r\ncriminal justice and addressing the most serious \r\ncrimes as a court of last resort. As a State party to the \r\nRome Statute of the ICC, we welcome the continuing \r\nincrease in the number of States joining the Statute. \r\nThis illustrates that the Court’s work and influence is \r\ngaining momentum.\r\nWhile this high-level dialogue is significant in that \r\nit is engaging Member States on this important issue, we \r\nmust ensure that we do not stop at dialogue. Our agreed \r\noutcomes must be implemented at both the national and \r\ninternational levels. Afghanistan will continue to do its \r\npart to help strengthen, as part of the global effort, the \r\nrule of law at the national and international levels.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I now \r\ngive the f loor to His Excellency Mr. Mathias Meinrad \r\nChikawe, Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs \r\nof the United Republic of Tanzania.\r\nMr. Chikawe (United Republic of Tanzania): The \r\nUnited Republic of Tanzania welcomes the importance \r\nthat the United Nations has placed on promoting the \r\nrule of law at all levels of governance. Let me first \r\nwarmly commend the Secretary-General for initiating \r\nthis timely and pertinent High-level Meeting on the \r\nRule of Law at the National and International Levels. It \r\nis indeed relevant and important for the United Nations \r\nto discuss this topic in the General Assembly in support \r\nof the initiatives of the Sixth Committee.\r\nTanzania is committed to upholding and promoting \r\nthe rule of law nationally, regionally and internationally. \r\nAt the national level, the rule of law is at the heart of \r\nthe social contract between the State and the individual. \r\nThe Constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania of \r\n1977 has been our Magna Carta in providing guidance \r\nand measures to ensure adherence to the rule of law. In \r\nthis regard, the principles of equality before the law, \r\naccountability to the law and separation of powers \r\nare embodied in our Constitution. Realizing that the \r\nConstitution emanates from the people and reflects \r\nwhat the people want, Tanzania is currently involved \r\nin a thorough, all-inclusive review of its Constitution \r\nfor the purpose of developing a new constitution, as the \r\ncurrent one has served the country for the past 50 years.\r\nMr. Charles (Trinidad and Tobago), Vice-President, \r\ntook the Chair.\r\n18 12-51943\r\nA/67/PV.4\r\nand adheres to the purposes and the principles of the \r\nUnited Nations Charter. Likewise, we attach great \r\nimportance to the need to reform the Security Council, \r\nwhich is an important pillar of international peace \r\nand security, which also hinge on international law. \r\nThe governing structures of the United Nations must \r\ntherefore give equal comfort to all its Members.\r\nAt the international level, Tanzania has ratified a \r\nnumber of multilateral treaties that bestow extensive \r\nobligations upon Member States to observe the rule of \r\nlaw. Tanzania hosts the African Court of Justice and \r\nHuman Rights, the African Union Advisory Board on \r\nCorruption and the Institute on International Law in \r\nEast Africa. Tanzania is among the African countries \r\nthat voluntarily subscribed to the African Peer Review \r\nMechanism and has agreed to be reviewed on four \r\nthematic areas: democracy and political governance, \r\neconomic governance and management, corporate \r\ngovernance, and socio-economic development.\r\nRecently, Tanzania committed to joining the \r\nOpen Government Partnership. This initiative is \r\naimed at making Government business more open \r\nto its citizens. It is also aimed at improving public \r\nservice delivery, public/private partnerships and \r\nGovernment responsiveness; combating corruption; \r\nand implementing measures to enhance transparency \r\nand build greater trust. The Partnership also provides \r\nan opportunity for Tanzania to enhance and promote \r\nthe rule of law and good governance.\r\nSuccess in the implementation of the rule of law \r\ndepends on how we are able to translate and transform \r\nthis process into concrete action. We are mindful of the \r\nfact that this requires sustained effort and political will.\r\nIn conclusion, let me once again reiterate my \r\nGovernment’s commitment to spearheading these \r\nefforts at the national level and appeal for continued \r\ninternational cooperation in making possible a just, \r\nfair, secure and peaceful world.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Kairat Umarov, Acting Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Kazakhstan.\r\nMr. Umarov (Kazakhstan): In a time of major \r\neconomic, social and political upheaval, respect for \r\nthe rule of law takes on paramount importance for the \r\nworld community. Kazakhstan welcomes the increased \r\nattention paid by the United Nations to this issue and \r\nexpresses its deep appreciation for the organization of \r\nthe first meeting on the subject at such a high level.\r\nThe Constitution also provides for the establishment \r\nof national institutions with mandates to ensure that not \r\nonly is the rule of law observed, but that citizens’ rights \r\nare protected. One such institution is the Commission \r\nfor Human Rights and Good Governance, which, over \r\nthe years, has done and continues to do a commendable \r\njob.\r\nAdherence to the principles of protection and \r\npromotion of human rights, access to justice and \r\nequality, good governance and the rule of law in the \r\ncountry has also been well-captured in our county’s \r\nDevelopment Vision 2025 and National Strategy for \r\nGrowth and Reduction of Poverty. \r\nStrengthening our justice system has been one of \r\nthe top priorities of our five-year national development \r\nplan. In this regard, the Government has made deliberate \r\nefforts to increase the number of judges and magistrates, \r\nbuilding new courts and renovating old ones. The \r\nmodernization of the judiciary services — inter alia, by \r\nintroducing tele-justice — is under way. The number \r\nof advocates in private practice has also been steadily \r\nincreased with the establishment of the Law School of \r\nTanzania, which has made representation and access \r\nto justice in Tanzania a reality. The establishment of \r\ncase-flow management committees to speed up the \r\nadjudication of civil and criminal cases is another \r\nmeasure designed to ensure the availability of timely \r\nand speedy justice for all.\r\nTanzania is also committed to becoming a \r\ncorruption-free society. We have established the \r\nPrevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau. The \r\nBureau is mandated to prevent and combat corruption, \r\neducate society on the effects of this menace and \r\nenforce the law against corruption.\r\nInternational law and the rule of law are the pillars \r\nof the international system. The rule of law at the \r\ninternational level becomes manifest in treaties and \r\ncustomary international law as applied and interpreted \r\nby international courts, including the International \r\nCourt of Justice, the International Criminal Court \r\nand ad hoc tribunals, which have enriched and \r\ndeveloped international law. It is an effective tool for \r\naddressing global challenges in promoting democracy, \r\nhuman rights, the eradication of poverty, sustainable \r\ndevelopment, the fight against international crimes and \r\nthe promotion of justice and peace for all. \r\nThe United Republic of Tanzania attaches great \r\nimportance to the rule of law at the international level \r\n12-51943 19\r\nA/67/PV.4\r\nand will continue to work for the promotion of the rule \r\nof law at all levels.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Audronius Ažubalis, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of Lithuania.\r\nMr. Ažubalis (Lithuania): My delegation fully \r\naligns itself with the statement delivered earlier today \r\non behalf of the European Union. I will touch upon \r\ntwo points of particular importance from our national \r\nperspective and to which we pay particular attention in \r\nLithuania’s bid for a non-permanent seat on the Security \r\nCouncil for the term 2014-2015.\r\nFirst, Lithuania has relevant experience in the \r\nfield of the rule of law and is willing to share it with \r\nothers. Since the restoration of independence, more \r\nthan 20 years ago, Lithuania has had to overcome \r\nserious challenges while building a modern democratic \r\nState based on the principles of the rule of law. In that \r\neffort we did not find ourselves alone, but could count \r\non the support of the international community. Today \r\nLithuania, like other States with modern experience \r\nin comprehensive reform-making, is ready to assist \r\nother countries in their efforts to reform legal and \r\nadministrative systems in order to enhance the rule of \r\nlaw. In that connection, I would like to mention that \r\nwe have already included the rule of law aspect in our \r\ndevelopment cooperation activities.\r\nSecondly, Lithuania continues to pursue the \r\nhighest standards in the field of the rule of law. In the \r\narea of our international relations, I would like to say \r\nthat compliance with voluntarily accepted international \r\nobligations and respect for the universally recognized \r\nprinciples and norms of international law is the legal \r\ntradition in Lithuania as well as a principle of our \r\nConstitution. We therefore attach great importance to \r\nthe legitimacy of our own actions and expect the same \r\nfrom others. We also believe that those elements, in \r\ncombination with the settlement of disputes by peaceful \r\nmeans referred to in Chapter VI of the United Nations \r\nCharter, are central in maintaining international peace \r\nand security.\r\nIn order to reinforce its international commitments \r\nand international legal accountability and to contribute \r\nto the strengthening of international judicial \r\nmechanisms, Lithuania has decided to recognize the \r\ncompulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of \r\nJustice in accordance with Article 36, paragraph 2, of \r\nthe Court’s Statute. The relevant declaration, together \r\nWe are deeply convinced that the rule of law \r\nmanifests itself primarily through strict adherence to \r\nits norms and principles in all areas of public life. At \r\nthe same time, the United Nations, which has been \r\nmandated to be a focal point for harmonizing nations’ \r\nactions to achieve the common objectives set out in its \r\nCharter, should play a coordinating role here. In this \r\nregard, I would like to thank the Secretary-General \r\nfor his comprehensive report on the subject of today’s \r\ndiscussion (A/66/749), which not only reflects the \r\ncurrent challenges in the area of the rule of law, but \r\nalso offers constructive ways to meet them.\r\nThe Republic of Kazakhstan has consistently called \r\nfor strict compliance with universally accepted legal \r\nnorms by all members of the international community. \r\nWe fully share the view that, at the international \r\nlevel, the rule of law ensures the predictability and \r\nlegitimacy of actions taken by States, promotes their \r\nsovereign equality, and provides the basis for a State’s \r\naccountability to all individuals within its territory \r\nwho are subject to its jurisdiction.\r\nOver the past 20 years of nation-building, the \r\nRepublic of Kazakhstan has carried out reforms \r\nin virtually all areas of public and social life. The \r\nConstitution of the country includes all the guarantees \r\nneeded for the promotion of constitutional legality \r\nand the further strengthening of existing pillars of \r\na democratic, secular, rule-of-law and social State. \r\nKazakhstan is party to more than 190 universal \r\ninternational treaties and conventions, primarily in \r\nthe area of human rights. There is an ongoing process \r\nof improving the mechanisms that ensure public \r\nparticipation in the set-up and exercise of State power \r\nand the involvement of citizens in State governance. \r\nLegislative measures have been taken to ensure \r\ncomprehensive political pluralism and enhance the \r\nrole and status of women in social and political life. \r\nKazakhstan has been progressively implementing \r\nits strategy for gender equality and has enacted laws \r\non the prevention of domestic violence and on State \r\nguarantees of equal rights and equal opportunities for \r\nmen and women.\r\nWe hope that today’s meeting will be a starting \r\npoint for the further development of mechanisms to \r\nensure and consolidate the principle of the rule of law. \r\nAs for Kazakhstan, let me assure the Assembly that the \r\ncountry will, as always, support efforts to enhance the \r\ncapacity and role of the United Nations legal machinery \r\n20 12-51943\r\nA/67/PV.4\r\nselectivity, in order to arrive at a world characterized \r\nby justice, stability and opportunities for all without \r\ndiscrimination. There is an urgent need to press ahead \r\nwith effective cooperation and coordination between \r\nthe United Nations, Member States and all relevant \r\nactors, focusing on the juncture between the national \r\nand international levels, in order to fulfil our national \r\nand international obligations and to face up to grave \r\nviolations of international law when they are committed. \r\nThat enhances our confidence and the relations among \r\nStates and adds to the predictability of international \r\nrelations based on the principles of complementarity, \r\nequality and justice.\r\nTunisia, which inspired the Arab revolutions, intends \r\nto press ahead with efforts to lay solid foundations \r\nfor a democratic, civil State. Our watchword is to do \r\naway with the past and to build on the gains made thus \r\nfar in a manner that perpetuates multilateralism, the \r\nsovereignty of the people and respect for human rights, \r\nand to build a State that cherishes the values of equity, \r\nresponsibility and equality before the law. Tunisia \r\nemphasizes its national commitment to streamlining \r\nits legislation to bring it in line with international \r\ninstruments, in accordance with its pledges. That \r\ngoal is reflected in our adoption and ratification of \r\nseveral international instruments that emphasize the \r\nsupremacy of international rules and principles, which \r\nare to be implemented without discrimination and with \r\nfull equity. \r\nTo further give expression to that belief, we would \r\nlike to emphasize our intention to include equality \r\nbetween men and women in our Constitution. That has \r\nbecome a concrete fact in society, in which we take \r\npride. \r\nWe are keen on supporting further legislative and \r\nsocial gains. I would like to highlight the completion of \r\nthe legislative framework by the National Commission \r\nagainst Torture in accordance with the Optional \r\nProtocol to the Convention against Torture, which will \r\nbe discussed nationally and subsequently ratified. \r\nOn 23 October 2011, we entered a new institutional \r\nphase with the holding of free, impartial and \r\ntransparent elections, which represents a tremendous \r\nhistoric achievement that enabled the establishment of \r\na national Constituent Assembly and the formation of \r\na Government deriving its legitimacy from the people \r\nas well as from the Assembly, which is writing a social \r\npact for the country. That Constitution safeguards our \r\nwith instruments of accession to the Optional Protocols \r\nto the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations \r\nand the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations \r\nconcerning the Compulsory Settlement of Disputes, \r\nwill be deposited during this year’s United Nations \r\ntreaty event.\r\nThat will be a major addition to the long list of \r\nspecific treaties in respect to which Lithuania has \r\nalready recognized the Court’s jurisdiction. It also \r\nindicates increased reliance on the international judicial \r\nsystem. On the basis of that national decision, I want to \r\ntake this opportunity to join those who call for wider \r\ninternational efforts to encourage recognition of the \r\nCourt’s jurisdiction.\r\nThe Republic of Lithuania, on the occasion of \r\nthis High-level Meeting, expresses its deep concern \r\nabout recent attacks on the United States and German \r\ndiplomatic and consular offices in some countries. We \r\nstrongly condemn the outrageous attack on the United \r\nStates diplomatic facility in Benghazi, Libya, which \r\ntook the lives of four people, including Ambassador \r\nChris Stevens. It should definitely be stressed that such \r\nattacks are also unacceptable from the perspective of \r\nthe rule of law.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Rafik Ben Abdessalem, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of Tunisia.\r\nMr. Abdessalem (Tunisia) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nAt the outset, I would like to extend our sincerest \r\ncongratulations to the President of the General Assembly \r\non his election to preside over the Assembly at its sixty-\r\nseventh session. I am also pleased to extend my thanks \r\nand appreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban \r\nKi-moon, and to Mr. Nasser Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, the \r\noutgoing President of the Assembly.\r\nThe Arab revolutions erupting out of an \r\noverwhelming desire for change indicate that the main \r\nconcern of Governments should be to safeguard their \r\npeoples’ sovereignty, respect human rights and provide \r\nthe necessary conditions to guarantee impartial and \r\nfree elections, justice and equality at all levels. They \r\nremind us all that comprehensive and strict adherence \r\nto international law in the policies of the State and in \r\ntheir exercise is fundamental, as is the enhancement of \r\nthe universal values represented in the supremacy of \r\nlaw and human rights. \r\nThat has led to efforts to consolidate the rule \r\nof law and implement it on a wider basis, with no \r\n12-51943 21\r\nA/67/PV.4\r\nThe theme of this meeting is the rule of law, and \r\nit has been assiduously prepared for over the last two \r\nyears. It presents an opportunity for Member States to \r\nreaffirm their commitment to continuing to promote \r\nthe rule of law at the national and international levels. \r\nIt is an opportunity to evaluate the efforts made and \r\nsteps taken by the Organization and to take stock of \r\nour national experiences, with a view to developing \r\na multilateral consensus on the ways of improving \r\nthe effectiveness of related activities, so that the \r\ninternational community can maintain a firm belief \r\nin the importance of the rule of law. This meeting \r\nembodies our intensive participation in the debates \r\naround that important theme.\r\nMorocco is firmly committed to promoting the \r\nrule of law and the respect for human rights and to \r\ndisseminating the values of tolerance at the national, \r\nregional and international levels. We reiterate our \r\ncommitment to establishing a multilateral international \r\norder based on international law, an arena for which \r\nthe United Nations is the most appropriate framework \r\nin our collective endeavours aimed at creating an \r\ninternational community that enjoys lasting peace and \r\nrespect for human rights. Realizing that vision demands \r\na holistic approach, based on the commitment to respect \r\nall these principles. The rule of law is a fundamental \r\npillar of United Nations efforts aimed at preventing \r\narmed conflicts and at safeguarding international peace \r\nand security, especially through the promotion of those \r\nprinciples in post-conflict situations.\r\nIn that context, Morocco, in accordance with its \r\ncommitment to support such efforts, has increased its \r\nparticipation in peacekeeping operations, and supports \r\nsuch missions around the world. Those efforts enjoy \r\nthe support of our national institutions, which seek \r\nto expand respect for the rule of law in all sectors. In \r\nthat regard, only a few days ago in the city of Rabat, \r\nMorocco, together with the United Nations, Qatar \r\nand Norway, hosted a workshop designed to highlight \r\nthe importance of national capacity-building in post-\r\nconflict situations and affording the participants an \r\nopportunity to exchange views and experiences.\r\nAt the international level, as things stand politically \r\nand economically, it is vital to place people at the \r\nheart of every undertaking by establishing a close \r\nlink between the rule of law and respect for human \r\nrights. For that we must intensify our efforts in order to \r\nmeet the Millennium Development Goals in full. The \r\ninternational community is also duty-bound to continue \r\npeople’s rights as citizens based on our revolution of \r\nfreedom, justice and dignity.\r\nWe emphasize the need for a democratic transition, \r\nwhich can be achieved by taking full account of the \r\nresponsibility of the former regime as well as of the \r\nimportance of avoiding the repetition of its crimes \r\nby working to establish a judiciary with integrity and \r\nindependence. We emphasize the importance of taking \r\na consultative, consensual, clear-cut approach that \r\ninvolves all parties and components of civil society \r\nas well as the victims, in order to define our goals \r\nand priorities and thus formulate a regional and legal \r\nframework designed to ensure transitional justice. That \r\nframework will be drafted by the Ministry of Human \r\nRights and Transitional Justice in cooperation with \r\nmembers of society and through a national dialogue. We \r\nare committed to enacting a transitional justice law in \r\nconsultation with civil society and with the cooperation \r\nof all parties.\r\nWe will continue to move forward in our irreversible \r\ndrive towards comprehensive reform in all areas and \r\nsectors. History teaches us, through the experience of \r\nothers, that such stages bring with them considerable \r\nsocio-economic challenges. It also shows us that while \r\nwe must rely on our own domestic capacity and will \r\nto prevail, we still need the continuing backup and \r\neffective support of the international community.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate my country’s \r\neagerness to cooperate with all its international partners \r\nin a way that helps us to benefit from the experience \r\nof others, strengthens our capacity to respond to the \r\naspirations of our citizens and opens up new horizons \r\non the path to freedom, justice, equality, accountability \r\nand peace.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Saad-Eddine El Othmani, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs and Cooperation of Morocco.\r\nMr. El Othmani (Morocco) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nI would first like to offer my sincere congratulations \r\nto the President on his accession to the presidency of \r\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. We \r\nare confident that his remarkable diplomatic qualities \r\nwill help crown our work with success. I would also \r\nlike to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for \r\nhis commitment to promoting the role of the United \r\nNations in the establishment of the rule of law and for \r\nhis participation in this meeting.\r\n22 12-51943\r\nA/67/PV.4\r\nMr. Dookeran (Trinidad and Tobago): This High-\r\nlevel Meeting on the rule of law is a timely expression \r\nof the principal premise on which the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations is predicated. It is a principle that is the \r\ncornerstone for the conduct of international relations \r\namong States and the anchor of the quest for good \r\ngovernance within our nations.\r\nThe path to growth and development, the promotion \r\nof human rights and the policy strategy to tackle issues \r\nsuch as climate change, poverty and the peaceful \r\nresolution of conflicts are dependent on adherence to \r\nthe rule of law.\r\nIn the midst of the global economic and financial \r\ncrisis, the challenge of good governance in an \r\nincreasingly diverse society and the search for a \r\nsustainable peace initiative, observance of the rule of \r\nlaw offers the most durable and reliable basis for lasting \r\nsolutions.\r\nIndeed, deficits in the practice of the rule of law \r\nexist. We have a golden opportunity to work together to \r\naddress the implementation deficit in the fulfilment of \r\nour domestic and international legal obligations, which \r\nhas had an impact on the maintenance of the rule of law.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago acknowledges that the \r\nresponsibility for strengthening the rule of law lies \r\nprimarily with individual Member States. Consequently, \r\nour Republican Constitution recognizes that the rule of \r\nlaw lies at the heart of the social contract which subsists \r\nbetween the State and its citizens.\r\nThe fundamental rights and freedoms of the \r\nindividual are protected and entrenched in our \r\nConstitution, without discrimination by reason of race, \r\norigin, colour, religion or sex.\r\nProvisions relating to equality before the law and \r\nthe protection of the law are also safeguarded under the \r\nsupreme law of Trinidad and Tobago. Moreover, those \r\nare buttressed by the various international human rights \r\nand other instruments to which Trinidad and Tobago is \r\na State party.\r\nAdditionally, our institutions or entities, whether \r\npublic or private, are accountable to and not above the \r\nlaw, and disputes are adjudicated by an independent \r\njudiciary which is free from the influence or control of \r\nthe executive and the Parliament.\r\nNotwithstanding our efforts over the past 50 years \r\nas an independent nation, Trinidad and Tobago also \r\nits efforts, based on the principle of joint responsibility, \r\nto deal with new trans-border threats, including \r\nterrorist  and rebel movements and organized crime \r\nnetworks, whose activities threaten every country in \r\nthe world, especially those in Africa, which has seen \r\na resurgence of such threats. While the United Nations \r\nand its specialized agencies have launched programmes \r\ndesigned to improve national capacities in the area of \r\nthe rule of law, such efforts will be futile unless they \r\nare based on a integrated, strategic approach that takes \r\ninto account the priorities of the countries concerned \r\nand their cultural and national specifics.\r\nMorocco, under the leadership of King Mohammed \r\nVI, has therefore, in order to meet the aspirations of \r\nthe Moroccan people, undertaken to strengthen the rule \r\nof law through an integrated, inclusive approach that \r\nhas allowed us to launch a major reform initiative to \r\nestablish the rule of law and democratic institutions, as \r\nwell as to promote the role of women.\r\nWe have also launched a national development \r\ninitiative aimed at strengthening national solidarity \r\nby addressing human rights violations. That reform \r\ninitiative culminated in the adoption of a new \r\nConstitution that reaffirms Morocco’s commitment to \r\nestablishing a democratic State governed by law and by \r\nthe separation of powers, and which also guarantees the \r\nindependence of the judiciary and enshrines respect for \r\nhuman rights and economic and political governance. \r\nThe Moroccan approach in that respect ensures a \r\npositive correlation between the values that are deeply \r\nembedded in Moroccan society and universal values.\r\nIn conclusion, we would like to reiterate our \r\ndeep conviction that the promotion of the rule of law \r\nand international governance are dependent on the \r\nenhancement of national capacities, so that States can \r\ndischarge their functions effectively and meet their \r\nobligations to their citizens.\r\nMorocco is committed to continuing dialogue with \r\nMember States and the United Nations bodies taking \r\npart in this first High-level Meeting on the rule of law \r\nand to follow up on the outcome of the Meeting. Here \r\nwe reaffirm our commitment to support all regional, \r\nsubregional and international stakeholders that seek to \r\npromote the values of the rule of law and civil peace.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Winston Dookeran, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of Trinidad and Tobago.\r\n12-51943 23\r\nA/67/PV.4\r\nI pledge the support of the Government of the \r\nRepublic of Trinidad and Tobago to work more closely \r\nwith the United Nations and other partners to combat \r\nillicit trade in narcotics, small arms and light weapons, \r\nas well as other transnational organized crimes, which \r\npose a serious threat to the rule of law within the \r\nCARICOM region, and hence to the peace, security and \r\nstability of our region.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. John Luk Jok, Minister of Justice of \r\nSouth Sudan.\r\nMr. Jok (South Sudan): The Republic of South \r\nSudan greatly appreciates the invitation to participate \r\nin this important meeting of the General Assembly to \r\ndeliberate on a common catchphrase and important \r\nsubject of modem times, namely, the rule of law at both \r\nthe national and international levels.\r\nThe Republic of South Sudan, as the Assembly is \r\naware, is the newest Member of the United Nations \r\nfamily, having only attained sovereign independence \r\nlast year, after several decades of bitter struggle for \r\nself-determination, justice, human rights, human \r\ndignity, peace and freedom. The independence of South \r\nSudan came about as a result of a peaceful, democratic \r\nand internationally monitored national referendum \r\nheld in January 2011. The outcome of the referendum \r\nwas 98.7 per cent in favour of the creation of a new \r\nindependent State of South Sudan. In effect, the people \r\nof South Sudan have chosen peace and freedom instead \r\nof costly and perpetual civil wars and conflicts with \r\nthe people of the Sudan, to the north, whose dream has \r\nalways been to build an Arab Islamic identity in the \r\nRepublic of the Sudan, which was the predecessor State.\r\nSouth Sudan has now embarked upon the dual task \r\nof State- and nation-building as a peace-loving member \r\nof the African Union and the United Nations family. \r\nSouth Sudan is committed to building a democratic State \r\nfor all of its ethnically diverse people. It is committed \r\nto promoting justice, freedom, human dignity and the \r\nrule of law, not only at the national level but also at the \r\ninternational level, together with the other Members of \r\nthe United Nations.\r\nWe are therefore pleased to participate in this \r\nmeeting of the sixty-seventh session of the General \r\nAssembly, dedicated to the important topic of the rule \r\nof law. We hope our contribution to this meeting will \r\nprovide more understanding of the developments in the \r\nnew Republic of South Sudan, particularly as it pertains \r\nrecognizes the interdependence between the rule of \r\nlaw at the national and international levels. That is the \r\ncardinal principle on the basis of which we conduct our \r\nforeign relations, whether in the bilateral or multilateral \r\nspheres. Adherence to the rule of law has also inspired \r\nus to establish very productive relationships with \r\ncountries in our subregion and hemisphere and further \r\nafield, through the conclusion of several initiatives \r\ngeared towards the achievement of the sustainable \r\neconomic and social development of our people.\r\nOne of the most important of those schemes is \r\nthe revised Treaty of Chaguaramas, establishing the \r\nCaribbean Community (CARICOM), including the \r\nCARICOM Single Market and Economy.\r\nWe robustly support the Affirmation of \r\nCommonwealth Values and Principles, which was \r\nadopted by the Commonwealth Heads of Government \r\nat their meeting held in Trinidad and Tobago in 2009. \r\nThat affirmation, among other things, indicates that \r\naccess to justice and an independent judiciary are \r\nfundamental to the rule of law, enhanced by effective, \r\ntransparent, ethical and accountable governance.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago, as a founding State of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court, also asserts that all \r\nStates are obligated to investigate and, where there \r\nis sufficient admissible evidence, prosecute persons \r\naccused of crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court.\r\nTo that end, we have enacted legislation to give \r\nfull effect domestically to the provisions of the Rome \r\nStatute, in order to prevent impunity for the perpetrators \r\nof such crimes, thereby protecting the rule of law.\r\nThere is no doubt that the rule of law is indispensable \r\nto the achievement of the three main pillars of the work \r\nof the United Nations: peace and security, human rights \r\nand development.\r\nAccordingly, the Assembly, at the beginning of this \r\nMeeting (see A/67/PV.3), adopted a strong Declaration \r\n(resolution 67/1) which promotes the rule of law through \r\neffective coordination between the United Nations, \r\nMember States and all other stakeholders. \r\nTrinidad and Tobago also supports the call for \r\nthe Secretary-General to put the necessary measures \r\nin place to enable the General Assembly to engage \r\nin follow-up work with a view to developing a \r\ncomprehensive approach to strengthening the rule of \r\nlaw at both the national and international levels.\r\n24 12-51943\r\nA/67/PV.4\r\ncommission was established with due regard to gender \r\nand the political, social and regional diversity of South \r\nSudan, in recognition of the need for inclusiveness, \r\ntransparency and the equitable participation of all our \r\npeople.\r\nThe rule of law is enshrined in the transitional \r\nConstitution of the Republic of South Sudan of 2011, \r\nwhich is the supreme law of the land, from which \r\nauthority at all levels of Government is derived and \r\nto which all State constitutions must conform. The \r\nConstitution vests sovereignty in the people, and the \r\nState exercises that sovereignty through its democratic \r\nand representative institutions, established under \r\nthe Constitution and the law. Most important, the \r\nConstitution proclaims that South Sudan is founded \r\non justice, equality, respect for human dignity and \r\nthe advancement of human rights and fundamental \r\nfreedoms.\r\nThe supreme law of our country embodies a bill \r\nof rights that is a covenant among the people of South \r\nSudan and between them and their Government at every \r\nlevel, and a commitment to respect and promote human \r\nrights and fundamental freedoms guaranteed in the \r\nConstitution. The bill of rights is taken seriously as the \r\ncornerstone of social justice, equality and democracy \r\nby all institutions of Government and the people.\r\nThe independence of the judiciary, including \r\nfinancial independence, is guaranteed by the \r\nConstitution. The judiciary is the custodian of the \r\nConstitution and has the power to review any executive \r\nor legislative act that does not conform with the \r\nConstitution.\r\nConsistent with international human rights law, the \r\ntransitional Constitution embodies a bill of rights that \r\nguarantees the sanctity of rights and freedoms — the \r\nright to life, human dignity, personal liberty; freedom \r\nfrom slavery, servitude, and forced labour; equality \r\nbefore the law; the right to found a family; the rights of \r\nwomen; the rights of the child; freedom from torture; \r\nthe right to a fair trial and litigation; restriction on the \r\ndeath penalty; the right to privacy; religious rights; \r\nfreedom of expression and media; freedom of assembly \r\nand association and to form political parties; the right \r\nto participate in public life and to vote; freedom of \r\nmovement and residence; the right to own property; the \r\nright to education; the rights of persons with special \r\nneeds and the elderly; public health care; the right of \r\naccess to information; the rights of ethnic and cultural \r\ncommunities; and the right to housing.\r\nto the rule of law at both the national and international \r\nlevels.\r\nThe Republic of South Sudan takes cognizance \r\nand recognizes the importance of the rule of law at \r\nthe international level, based on the development, \r\npromotion and implementation of international norms \r\nand standards in relevant fields of international law. As \r\na new Member of the United Nations, the Republic of \r\nSouth Sudan declares its commitment to the rule of law \r\nand to an international legal order in which the conduct \r\nof States in their international relations is based on the \r\nrule of law, respect for the sovereign equality of States \r\nand the principles and ideals of the Charter of the United \r\nNations for the maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity. The Republic of South Sudan furthermore \r\ntakes note of the ongoing work on the rule of law under \r\nthe auspices of the Secretary-General. We particularly \r\nacknowledge the framework and precise definitions \r\nprovided in the Secretary-General’s 2004 report on the \r\nrule of law and transitional justice in conflict and post-\r\nconflict societies, which states that \r\n“The ‘rule of law’ is a concept at the very heart \r\nof the Organization’s mission. It refers to a principle \r\nof governance in which all persons, institutions \r\nand entities, public and private, including the State \r\nitself, are accountable to laws that are publicly \r\npromulgated, equally enforced and independently \r\nadjudicated, and which are consistent with \r\ninternational human rights norms and standards. \r\nIt requires, as well, measures to ensure adherence \r\nto the principles of supremacy of law, equality \r\nbefore the law, accountability to the law, fairness \r\nin the application of the law, separation of powers, \r\nparticipation in decision-making, legal certainty, \r\navoidance of arbitrariness and procedural and legal \r\ntransparency.” (S/2004/616, para. 6)\r\nThat definition certainly summarizes the basic \r\nconcepts that underpin the historical and philosophical \r\nfoundations of the concept of the rule of law from its \r\nearly origins in history to this day.\r\nUpon independence, on 9 July 2011, South Sudan \r\npromulgated a transitional Constitution under which \r\nour country is to be governed until 2015, when a new \r\nconstitution shall be established through a democratic, \r\ninclusive and participatory process. Currently, a \r\nnational constitutional review commission is at work \r\ncollecting views and suggestions from all stakeholders \r\nin the country on the text of the future constitution. The \r\n12-51943 25\r\nA/67/PV.4\r\nBuilding rule-of-law institutions remains one of \r\nthe most challenging tasks our country is undertaking. \r\nAs our nation is just one year old, it is still challenged \r\nby various difficulties, as it lacks capacity in the areas \r\nof the rule of law. In that regard, South Sudan is seeking \r\nthe support of the United Nations so that in promoting \r\nthe noble idea of the rule of law we have the capacity \r\nto carry out our obligations under the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nWith regard to the International Court of Justice \r\nand strengthening its role, South Sudan recognizes \r\nthe importance of the international dispute resolution \r\nmechanisms. South Sudan is therefore committed to \r\nutilizing the forum of the International Court of Justice \r\nand other adjudicative bodies and mechanisms for the \r\npeaceful resolution of disputes. From its inception, the \r\nComprehensive Peace Agreement, which led to the \r\nindependence of South Sudan, was brokered through \r\nsuch international mechanisms. Moreover, South Sudan, \r\neven before its independence from the Sudan, agreed to \r\na settlement by the Permanent Court of Arbitration at \r\nThe Hague on the Abyei boundary dispute between it \r\nand the Sudan. Furthermore, South Sudan fully accepts \r\nthe recommendations of Security Council resolution \r\n2046 (2012) and has agreed to peaceful negotiations \r\nwith the Sudan, facilitated by the African Union High-\r\nlevel Implementation Panel under the leadership of \r\nPresident Thabo Mbeki.\r\nAs for strengthening the rule of law at the national \r\nlevel, the transitional Constitution of the Republic of \r\nSouth Sudan incorporates important principles that \r\nguarantee access to services for marginalized and \r\nvulnerable groups. The Constitution also requires all \r\nlevels of Government to enact laws to combat harmful \r\ncustoms and traditions that undermine the dignity and \r\nstatus of women and to promote the rights of women to \r\nown property and share in the estates of their deceased \r\nhusbands together with any surviving heirs. It requires \r\nthe provision of maternity care, child care and medical \r\ncare for pregnant and lactating women. Furthermore, \r\nthe Constitution also provides for the right of the child \r\nto life, survival and development and not to be subjected \r\nto exploitative practices or abuse, nor to be required to \r\nserve in the army or permitted to perform work that \r\nmay be hazardous or harmful to the child’s education, \r\nhealth or well-being. \r\nAs I said, the Assembly will definitely acknowledge \r\nthat I represent the youngest Member of the United \r\nNations. So I appeal to the President to allow me to \r\nThose rights are guaranteed in our Constitution. \r\nThat bill of rights is justiciable before courts of law, \r\nand therefore enforceable.\r\nTo ensure national implementation, South Sudan, \r\nfollowing independence last year, embarked on the \r\nenormous task of building its legal system from \r\nthe ground up following its disconnection from the \r\nold Sudanese legal system. While building those \r\nlegal frameworks, we are also currently engaging \r\nin a process of identifying multilateral and regional \r\ntreaties and agreements for the purpose of their \r\nratification, or for the Republic of South Sudan to \r\naccede to those international treaties and agreements, \r\nin accordance with the procedures and requirements \r\nof our Constitution. That process will facilitate the \r\nincorporation into domestic law of relevant international \r\ntreaties, covenants, agreements and protocols in order \r\nto ensure their national enforcement. \r\nSouth Sudan has so far acceded to a number \r\nof important international treaties and agreements, \r\nincluding the four Geneva Conventions of 1949 and \r\ntheir additional Protocols, and agreements relating \r\nto the International Monetary Fund and World Bank \r\nGroup institutions. South Sudan has incorporated \r\nthose instruments into its domestic laws. There is \r\nongoing work between the Ministry for Foreign Affairs \r\nand the Ministry of Justice to update the situation so \r\nthat our country accedes to all international human \r\nrights conventions and treaties in the coming months. \r\nAlready, with the support of the United Nations Mission \r\nin our country, we have been able to hold workshops \r\nto address procedures for accession to, and ratification \r\nof, treaties. We are grateful for the cooperation of the \r\nUnited Nations Mission in South Sudan.\r\nIn spite of the progress made so far, South Sudan \r\nwill continue to require more capacity-building \r\nsupport, possibly through bilateral and multilateral \r\nassistance and the integrated response provided by the \r\nSecretary-General. In strengthening the treaty bodies, \r\nas I have already mentioned, the Republic of South \r\nSudan is working with the United Nations Mission in \r\nSouth Sudan and other multilateral bodies to develop \r\nstrong and effective institutions in the area of the rule \r\nof law by providing training to the rule of law sectors, \r\nincluding the judiciary, the Ministry of Justice, the \r\ncorrectional services and the police. The support of the \r\nUnited Nations, although limited in nature, is greatly \r\nappreciated. \r\n26 12-51943\r\nA/67/PV.4\r\nassociation and the right to participation and voting. The \r\nGovernment has already established legal frameworks \r\nfor political parties, elections and electoral law. The \r\nlegal and institutional framework for the professional \r\nassociations of lawyers and other civil society and \r\nprofessional groups is also under way. The Government \r\nrecognizes its partnership with civil society. \r\nEven before South Sudan’s independence, civil \r\nsociety organizations were actively involved in \r\naddressing many social and public needs within \r\nsouthern Sudan. The Government is committed to \r\nsupporting civil society organizations in their efforts \r\nto effectively strengthen the voice of the citizens by \r\nempowering them.\r\nIn terms of traditional and informal justice \r\nsystems, the Constitution recognizes customary \r\nlaw and traditional institutions, allowing them to \r\nfunction alongside formal justice sector institutions. \r\nThe traditional and informal sector is functioning in \r\naccordance with the Constitution and the law. Under \r\nthe Local Government Act, customary law councils and \r\ncourts are established with appointed judges. However, \r\nthere still remain major conflict areas between the \r\ntraditional justice mechanisms and the formal legal \r\nsystem. \r\nIn supporting peace and security in conflict and \r\npost-conflict situations, as a nation emerging from \r\na long civil war, security continues to be a concern \r\nfor the Government of South Sudan, especially with \r\nregard to interference coming from the north from \r\nour former compatriots in the Sudan. The impact \r\nof continued armed conflict in parts of the country \r\naffects the implementation of rule-of-law programmes, \r\nthe security of citizens and human rights. Moreover, \r\nin the aftermath of conflict, South Sudan lacks the \r\ncapacity and financial resources required to implement \r\ninitiatives and programmes within justice sector \r\ninstitutions to mitigate the causes and consequences of \r\ninsecurity.\r\nHowever, we are in dialogue with our neighbour \r\nthe Sudan, in order to resolve all outstanding issues \r\nthrough peaceful means, in accordance with the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. Together with the United \r\nNations Mission in the Republic of South Sudan, South \r\nSudan is currently providing training for justice sector \r\ninstitutions to increase their presence throughout the \r\ncountry, improve their efficiency and effectiveness \r\nand gradually improve overall peace and security \r\nthroughout the country.\r\nfinish my statement as a privilege for the youngest \r\nmember of the community here. \r\nOur Constitution requires all levels of Government \r\nto guarantee the right of persons with disabilities or \r\nspecial needs to participate in society and to enjoy \r\nrights and freedoms, especially access to public \r\nfacilities, suitable education and employment. All \r\nlevels of Government are also required to ensure that \r\nthe elderly and persons with special needs are accorded, \r\nwith dignity, the medical services and care necessary \r\nfor their health.\r\nWith regard to accountability, the Government of \r\nSouth Sudan recognizes that the basic principles of open \r\nGovernment are key to achieving public confidence \r\nin Government. To that end, the Government has \r\nestablished legal and institutional frameworks in the \r\nareas of anti-corruption efforts, public financing, \r\naccounting and management, anti-money-laundering, \r\npublic auditing and public employee grievance \r\nmechanisms. In addition to those legal frameworks, \r\nnew legislation pertaining to the public’s right of access \r\nto information has been presented to, and is under \r\ndeliberation by, our Parliament.\r\nNevertheless, significant funding and technical \r\nassistance for design, planning and implementation \r\nin areas such as the programme for the protection of \r\nwhistle-blowers and witness protection is required if \r\nthey are to be made active. However, in its development \r\nplan, the Government ensures that public participation \r\nand engagement in policy and decision-making \r\nprocesses are an integral part of good governance, the \r\nrule of law and accountability.\r\nWith regard to national data collection, South Sudan \r\nis committed to strengthening its service delivery by \r\nimproving the organizational management of rule of \r\nlaw institutions, including the establishment of policies \r\nfor the improvement of services. Work is already under \r\nway through the South Sudan judiciary action plan \r\n2011-2014, the Ministry of Justice strategic framework \r\n2012-2013, and the Ministry of the Interior action plan \r\nfor 2012. However, as a new nation emerging from \r\nconflict, there is enormous need for technical support, \r\ncapacity development and programming to ensure \r\neffectiveness and efficiency in policy development and \r\nimplementation.\r\nIn terms of civil society, the transitional \r\nConstitution of the Republic of South Sudan includes \r\nprovisions relating to the freedom of assembly and \r\n12-51943 27\r\nA/67/PV.4\r\ndecision-making institutions for women. Thanks to that \r\npolicy, South Sudanese women currently participate in \r\nvarious areas of public life through social networks, \r\nwomen’s groups, political parties, and in the executive \r\nand legislative bodies of our Government. With regard \r\nto empowering children, our Constitution and bill of \r\nrights provides for the protection of the child, including \r\nthe right to life, survival and development, and name \r\nand nationality. The Constitution also protects children \r\nfrom all forms of discrimination, corporal punishment \r\nin schools, cruel and inhuman treatment, and from \r\nbeing subjected to negation or harmful cultural \r\npractices that affect child health. In short, we have \r\nalready incorporated the United Nations Convention on \r\nthe Rights of the Child into our domestic law. \r\nIn conclusion, as a new nation, South Sudan is \r\ncommitted to strengthening the nexus between the rule \r\nof law at the national, regional and international levels \r\nin order to ensure accountability for perpetrators of \r\ninternational crimes and other gross violations of human \r\nrights. We stand ready to cooperate in investigations \r\nand prosecutions of international crimes. However, at \r\npresent, due to inadequate capacity within our domestic \r\ninstitutions, assistance is needed to support our rule-of-\r\nlaw institutions in investigating, prosecuting and trying \r\nperpetuators of international or transboundary crimes. \r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker for this meeting.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.05 p.m. \r\nWith respect to sustainable human development, \r\neven prior to independence, South Sudan had continually \r\nendeavoured to develop and promote legal frameworks \r\nfor business and to foster an enabling environment that \r\nsupports entrepreneurship and the growth of small- and \r\nmedium-size enterprises. Some of the legal frameworks \r\nalready developed to boost private sector investment \r\ninclude investment promotion, consumer protection \r\nlaws and regulations relating to companies, cooperative \r\nsocieties, the sale of goods, import and export, \r\nregistration of businesses, partnerships, contracts and \r\nagencies, to mention but a few. Recently, South Sudan \r\nacceded to a variety of conventions and other legal \r\nframeworks through membership in the International \r\nMonetary Fund and the World Bank Group institutions. \r\nHowever, South Sudan is still hampered by severe \r\ncapacity deficits in its efforts to foster an enabling \r\nenvironment for sustainable human development.\r\nWith respect to fighting corruption, as a new \r\nState, South Sudan has limited legal frameworks \r\nfor dealing with that problem, but it has taken major \r\nsteps to develop mechanisms and create institutions \r\nby which accountability can be ensured. We have \r\nan anti-corruption commission within the Ministry \r\nof Justice and other bodies whose role is to check \r\ncorruption in public life.\r\nFinally, I would be remiss if I did not mention the \r\nrights of women and children. Our Constitution includes \r\naffirmative action specifically designed to empower \r\nwomen. We set aside 25 per cent of the seats in all \r\n"
