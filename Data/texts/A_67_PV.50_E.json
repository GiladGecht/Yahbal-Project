The oceans influence all of human \r\nactivity and support much of our transportation, and \r\nthe exploitation of the resources they contain is vital \r\nto States.\r\nThe United Nations Convention on the Law of \r\nthe Sea is considered to be one of the most important \r\nmultilateral instruments in history. It was the result \r\nof a great collective effort, to which our countries \r\ncontributed significantly. There are currently 164 \r\nStates parties to the Convention. In fact, the Convention \r\nwas opened for signature in 1982 in a country of our \r\nregion, Jamaica, in Montego Bay, and came into force \r\nin 1994 after the sixtieth instrument of ratification was \r\ndeposited by Guyana, another country in our region. \r\nOur region also played a very active role during the \r\nnegotiation process and contributed significantly to the \r\ndevelopment of the norms that today govern the law of \r\nthe sea. The positions taken and proposals made by the \r\ncountries of our region had a decisive influence during \r\nthe three preparatory conferences convened by the \r\nUnited Nations on the subject.\r\nThe countries of our region have demonstrated a \r\nnotable interest in the development of the law of the \r\nsea, due to its significance for, among other things, the \r\nexpansion of trade, transportation and as a source of \r\nfood. The contribution of some Latin American and \r\nCaribbean countries has been particularly relevant in \r\nthe establishment of the legal regime of the territorial \r\nsea, the exclusive economic zone and the continental \r\nshelf. The 200-nautical-mile limit was a legal notion \r\nthat emerged from our region, supported by a new \r\nconcept: the sea as a factor in development. The goal \r\nwas to preserve and protect marine resources and to \r\nensure permanent sovereignty over those resources and \r\ntheir use for the benefit of the peoples.\r\nUnited Nations A/67/PV.50\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-seventh session\r\n50th plenary meeting\r\nMonday, 10 December 2012, 3 p.m.\r\nNew York\r\nOffi cial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Jeremić  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Serbia)\r\n2 12-63751\r\nA/67/PV.50\r\nThe Convention incorporated new institutions, \r\nsuch as the exclusive economic zone. It established \r\ndefinitions, such as that of the archipelagic State, \r\nobligations for protecting the marine environment, \r\nand freedom of scientific research, among others. \r\nFurthermore, it created a juridical regime regulating \r\nactivities on the seabed and subsoil thereof, which were \r\ndeclared the common heritage of humankind. Another \r\nnoteworthy point was the recognition of landlocked \r\ncountries’ right of access to the sea and freedom of \r\ntransit. In that context, we encourage all States parties \r\nto implement Part X of the Convention, on the right \r\nof access of landlocked States to and from the sea and \r\nfreedom of transit.\r\nAs a result, we arrived at an international \r\ninstrument for the regulation of a common heritage of \r\nhumankind, as proposed by Ambassador Arvid Pardo \r\nof Malta, to whom we also pay tribute on this occasion. \r\nThere has been significant progress in achieving the \r\nobjectives of the Convention, and our region is proud \r\nof having participated actively in its negotiation. We \r\ntherefore salute the negotiators from all countries, and \r\nthe Convention itself.\r\nMrs. Perceval (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nArgentina is pleased to participate in this \r\ncommemoration of the thirtieth anniversary of the \r\nopening for signature of the United Nations Convention \r\non the Law of the Sea, which took place in Montego \r\nBay, Jamaica, on 10 December 1982. One look at a \r\nmap reveals Argentina’s connection to the sea in its \r\nextensive coastline and a continental shelf that slopes \r\ngently into the sea, with an outer edge that extends, for \r\nmost of that coastline, beyond 200 miles.\r\nThe evolution of the law of the sea as it functions \r\ntoday has close connections to coastal States, \r\nparticularly developing coastal States, including our \r\ncountry, Argentina. Until the 1930s, the law of the \r\nsea was traditionally marked by freedom of the seas, \r\nas Grotius defined it in the seventeenth century, but \r\nby the 1940s, countries with major seacoasts began \r\nparallel efforts aimed at changing the focus of the law \r\nof the sea from one centred on the absolute freedom of \r\nuse of the seas to one that would take into account the \r\ninterests, especially economic, of coastal States. That \r\ndecade witnessed the first claims, through declarations \r\nor national legislation, to maritime areas adjacent to the \r\nterritory of a State beyond its territorial sea.\r\nI recall that Argentina’s was the first of those \r\nclaims. In 1944, my country proclaimed the Argentine \r\nepicontinental sea, which included the water column \r\nand the seabed and subsoil beyond the territorial sea. \r\nIn 1945, the well-known Truman Declaration was \r\nissued. It was followed by many internal norms and \r\nclaims in the form of declarations by Mexico, Chile, \r\nPeru, Iceland, the Dominican Republic, Cuba and other \r\nStates. It was pressure from coastal States, not content \r\nwith a strip of sovereignty over the sea only three miles \r\nwide, that seriously shaped the negotiations that began \r\nin the 1970s.\r\nThe final impetus needed for the negotiation of a \r\nUnited Nations conference that, unlike the two previous \r\nones, would address all aspects of the law of the sea was \r\nthe concern that arose because the deep seabed, with \r\nits enormous mineral deposits known as polymetallic \r\nnodules, was the setting for an arms race in a time of \r\ncold war. The declaration of the ocean f loor beyond \r\nthe limits of national jurisdiction and its resources as \r\nthe common heritage of humankind, influenced by \r\nthe dominating new international economic order, led \r\ndirectly to the convening of the Third United Nations \r\nConference on the Law of the Sea. I would therefore \r\nlike to endorse the well-deserved tribute to Ambassador \r\nArvid Pardo of Malta for his visionary speech here in \r\n1967 (see A/C.1/PV.1515).\r\nThe 1973 Conference on the Law of the Sea set \r\nseveral records. It was the first conference with massive \r\nparticipation of new United Nations Members that had \r\nacquired their independence through the process of \r\ndecolonization. It was the first conference in which \r\nnon-governmental organizations took part and at which, \r\nall elements being so closely linked, negotiations were \r\nby consensus on the basis of a gentlemen’s agreement \r\ncalled the package deal. It was also the first conference \r\nto provide a comprehensive regime for the protection \r\nand preservation of the environment — in this case, the \r\nmarine environment.\r\nThe Convention adopted in 1982 fully met its \r\nobjective to “settle … all issues relating to the law \r\nof the sea” in a single instrument. Its relevance is \r\ntruly remarkable. Allow me to recall just some of the \r\nnoteworthy aspects of the Convention.\r\nThe sovereignty of the coastal State over the \r\nexploration for and exploitation of natural resources and \r\nits jurisdiction regarding protection and preservation of \r\nthe marine environment in a 200-mile-wide strip — since \r\nthen known as the exclusive economic zone — was \r\none of the most significant concepts enshrined in \r\n12-63751 3\r\nA/67/PV.50\r\nthe Convention. Another was the crystallization, \r\nunder the Convention, of the exclusive sovereignty \r\nof the coastal State over its entire continental shelf \r\nindependent of occupation, effective or notional, or of \r\nany express proclamation. In addition, the legal system \r\nfor marine scientific research provided for in Part XIII \r\nof the Convention does nothing more than reaffirm the \r\nsovereign rights of the coastal State regarding those \r\ntwo marine areas.\r\nHowever, the truly revolutionary element was \r\nthe legal system for the area. The preamble to the \r\nConvention sets out the objective:\r\n“to develop the principles embodied in resolution \r\n2749 (XXV) … in which the General Assembly of \r\nthe United Nations solemnly declared inter alia that \r\nthe area of the seabed and ocean f loor and the subsoil \r\nthereof, beyond the limits of national jurisdiction, \r\nas well as its resources, are the common heritage of \r\nmankind, the exploration and exploitation of which \r\nshall be carried out for the benefit of mankind as a \r\nwhole”. \r\nPart XI sets out a legal system for the exploration for \r\nand exploitation of minerals, but its principles, which \r\nemanate from resolution 2749 (XXV), apply to the \r\nwhole Area, for “the Area and its resources are the \r\ncommon heritage of mankind”.\r\nAnother revolutionary dimension of the Convention \r\non the Law of the Sea, which reaffirms its comprehensive \r\nnature as the entire legal system for oceans and seas, \r\nwas the establishment of three institutions. \r\nThe Commission on the Limits of the Continental \r\nShelf has worked tirelessly since its establishment. \r\nArgentina recognizes the efforts of the Commission’s \r\nmembers and the support provided by the Secretariat. \r\nIt encourages all necessary support measures for the \r\nCommission to work expeditiously and effectively.\r\nThe International Seabed Authority continues \r\nto develop norms, on the basis of the standards of \r\nthe Convention, for prospecting and exploring for \r\nand exploiting minerals in the Area. It has also made \r\nprogress in developing norms for the protection \r\nand preservation of the Area’s marine environment, \r\npursuant to the mandate arising from article 145 of the \r\nConvention.\r\nFinally, I would like to stress that the International \r\nTribunal for the Law of the Sea has already tried 20 \r\ncases, involving different aspects of the law of the sea. \r\nAmong them, the 2011 advisory opinion issued by the \r\nSeabed Disputes Chamber, On Responsibilities and \r\nObligations of States sponsoring persons and entities \r\nwith respect to activities in the Area, represents the \r\nfirst time that those two bodies established by the \r\nConvention were connected in the way foreseen in \r\narticle 191. The advisory opinion clearly shows the \r\ncommitment of States to the legal system established \r\nfor the Area by the Convention and the centrality of \r\nthe Tribunal as an institution. Argentina welcomes the \r\nfact that the Tribunal has been strengthening its body \r\nof law as the specialized tribunal for the law of the sea \r\nenvisaged when the Convention was negotiated and, \r\nas the latest events show, that it has a leading role in \r\nmaintaining the integrity of international law, an aspect \r\non which we agree with the President of the Tribunal, \r\nMr. Yanai. \r\nToday, the Convention has 164 parties, a meeting \r\nof States parties ever more dynamic with regard to \r\nsubstantive issues, and follow-up by the General \r\nAssembly and its working groups. The Convention \r\nrepresents a delicate balance of rights, obligations and \r\ninterests that we must continue to preserve. To that end, \r\nthe General Assembly, the specialized agencies with \r\ncompetence in ocean issues, regional organizations and \r\nthe Secretariat must continue to keep their activity in \r\nline with the Convention.\r\nIn June this year, the twenty-second Meeting of \r\nStates Parties to the Convention adopted a special \r\ncommemorative declaration that recalls \r\n“the pre-eminent contribution provided by the \r\nConvention to the strengthening of peace, security, \r\ncooperation and friendly relations among all nations \r\nin conformity with the principles of justice and \r\nequal rights and to the promotion of the economic \r\nand social advancement of all peoples of the world, \r\nin accordance with the purposes and principles of \r\nthe United Nations as set forth in the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations, as well as to the sustainable \r\ndevelopment of the oceans and seas”.\r\nOur country, Argentina, and our Mission to the \r\nUnited Nations wishes to pay tribute to the members \r\nof the Argentine delegation to the Third Conference \r\non the Law of the Sea, the negotiators of all countries, \r\nthe public officials of Argentina and all countries that \r\nworked for the ratification of the Convention, and to the \r\nSecretariat, represented today by the efficient Division \r\nfor Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea.\r\n4 12-63751\r\nA/67/PV.50\r\nMr. Charles (Trinidad and Tobago): Trinidad \r\nand Tobago is honoured to participate in this event \r\ncommemorating the thirtieth anniversary of the opening \r\nfor signature of the 1982 United Nations Convention on \r\nthe Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). \r\nWe align ourselves with the statement delivered \r\nearlier today by the representative of Jamaica on behalf \r\nof the States members of the Caribbean Community \r\n(see A/67/PV.49). \r\nTrinidad and Tobago signed the Convention on \r\n10 December 1982, when it was opened for signature \r\nat the close of the Third United Nations Conference \r\non the Law of the Sea in Montego Bay, Jamaica. Our \r\ndelegation to that Conference was led by the late Lennox \r\nBallah, who was one of the staunchest advocates of \r\nthe Convention and who later became a judge of the \r\nInternational Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS). \r\nTrinidad and Tobago was therefore among the first \r\ngroup of States to have signaled its intention to be \r\nbound by this landmark treaty, which we accept as the \r\nconstitution of the oceans and seas. In 1986, Trinidad \r\nand Tobago ratified the Convention, thereby expressing \r\nits consent to be bound by that instrument, which \r\nentered into force for the country on 16 November 1994.\r\nOver the past 30 years, much has happened in the life \r\nof the Convention for Trinidad and Tobago and the other \r\nmembers of the international community as a whole. We \r\nhave witnessed the almost universal reach of a treaty, \r\nwhich more than any other agreement has established a \r\nfirm basis for the preservation and promotion of the rule \r\nof law in our oceans and seas. Today 164 States parties \r\nrely on the Convention as the basis for the conduct of all \r\nof their activities in the maritime areas both within and \r\nbeyond national jurisdiction. Trinidad and Tobago also \r\nenacted legislation in 1986 to give domestic legal effect \r\nto the provisions of the Convention.\r\nAs a State party, having satisfied the criteria \r\nlaid down in Part IV of the Convention, Trinidad and \r\nTobago was able to declare itself an archipelagic State \r\nand is recognized globally as having that status. The \r\ncreation of the 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic \r\nzone together with the regime of the continental shelf \r\nunder the Convention has allowed Trinidad and Tobago, \r\nas one of the oldest producers of hydrocarbons in the \r\nworld, to expand its production beyond land-based \r\nsources and areas closer to the shore to areas farther \r\nout on the continental shelf. \r\nIt is our expectation that jurisdiction over our \r\ncontinental shelf will extend even further. We await a \r\nrecommendation from the Commission on the Limits \r\nof the Continental Shelf based on our submission to it \r\nin 2009. That submission seeks to establish the outer \r\nlimits of Trinidad and Tobago’s continental shelf in \r\naccordance with article 76, paragraph 8 and annex II, \r\narticle 4 of the Convention.\r\nOver the past three decades, we have relied on \r\nthe provisions of the Convention as the basis for \r\nengagement in matters beyond the exploitation of the \r\nliving and non-living resources of the maritime zones \r\nover which we exercise jurisdiction in accordance with \r\ninternational law. For example, Trinidad and Tobago has \r\nbeen able to conclude agreements relating to maritime \r\nboundary delimitation and the sustainable use of \r\nfisheries resources with neighbouring coastal States, in \r\nkeeping with the provisions of the Convention. Those \r\nbilateral treaties have been either concluded through \r\nnegotiations or settled by arbitration, as provided for \r\nunder Part XV and annex VII of the instrument. We in \r\nTrinidad and Tobago have also established an Institute \r\nof Marine Affairs to assist in the creation of mechanisms \r\nto preserve and protect the marine environment, as well \r\nas to engage in scientific research in the maritime zones \r\nunder our jurisdiction. \r\nTrinidad and Tobago’s commitment to honouring \r\nits obligations that f low from the Convention was \r\nfurther demonstrated in 2007, when we deposited with \r\nthe Secretary-General a declaration pursuant to article \r\n287 of the Convention accepting the jurisdiction of \r\nITLOS for the settlement of disputes concerning the \r\ninterpretation and application of the Convention.\r\nMore than any other international treaty, the \r\nConvention is a reflection of the will of the global \r\ncommunity to conclude a framework agreement that not \r\nonly recognizes the sovereignty and sovereign rights \r\nof coastal States, but also the rights of other States to \r\nbenefit from the resources of our oceans and seas. \r\nIn the Assembly today, we are privileged to have \r\namong us some of the founding fathers who were \r\npresent in Montego Bay in 1982 and who helped \r\nto shape what is widely regarded as one of the most \r\nsignificant treaties adopted under the auspices of the \r\nUnited Nations. Trinidad and Tobago recognizes the \r\nheroic and pioneering efforts of Ambassador Tommy \r\nKoh of Singapore, President of the Third United Nations \r\nConference on the Law of the Sea, and our good friend \r\n12-63751 5\r\nA/67/PV.50\r\nAmbassador Satya Nandan of Fiji, former Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the International Seabed Authority, who \r\nalso played a major role in the creation of the 1994 \r\nAgreement relating to the implementation of Part XI of \r\nthe Convention. Those illustrious international lawyers \r\nand diplomats, and others as well, ensured that the \r\nConvention also reflected and protected the interests, \r\nneeds and aspirations of developing countries.\r\nDue to natural or geographic factors, not all \r\nStates are similarly circumstanced. Not all countries \r\nare coastal States. Some are landlocked, others \r\ngeographically disadvantaged. The Convention, \r\nhowever, makes provisions for such States to benefit \r\nfrom, for example, the resources of the seabed and \r\nsubsoil in the areas beyond national jurisdiction, which \r\nis widely accepted as the common heritage of mankind. \r\nToday, therefore, the international community owes a \r\ndebt of gratitude to the late Ambassador Arvid Pardo of \r\nMalta for his vision in bringing to the fore this concept, \r\nwhich has become one of the most seminal norms in \r\ninternational law.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago accepts that the Convention \r\nis not a perfect instrument. However, we submit that it \r\nis an accord unlike any other. Over the next 30 years, \r\nthe international community must quicken the pace \r\ntowards global adherence to UNCLOS. We must also, \r\ninter alia, ensure that article 82 of the Convention is \r\nimplemented in an equitable manner, in keeping with \r\nthe object and purpose of the Convention. In this regard, \r\nwe commend the International Seabed Authority for \r\ndoing the preparatory work on that dormant article. \r\nWe also commend the Authority for the efficient \r\nmanagement of the resources entrusted to it, enabling \r\nit to produce codes, which can be used as guides for \r\nStates parties in exploring and prospecting for mineral \r\nresources in the Area for the benefit of humankind as a \r\nwhole. The international community must also agree on \r\nthe conclusion of an implementation agreement under \r\nthe Convention to cover marine biodiversity in areas \r\nbeyond national jurisdiction, so that those resources \r\nwill be explored and exploited for the benefit of all \r\nhumanity and not solely for benefit of a few States.\r\nIn closing, Trinidad and Tobago wishes to renew \r\nits commitment to working with States parties and \r\nother States for the full and effective implementation \r\nof the provisions of the Convention in order to enable \r\nthe resources of our oceans and seas to be utilized in a \r\nsustainable manner for the benefit of current and future \r\ngenerations.\r\nMr. Haase (Australia): On behalf of Australia, I \r\nwish to express our warm appreciation for this plenary \r\nmeeting devoted to the oceans and the law of the sea. \r\nThirty years ago today, the United Nations Convention \r\non the Law of the Sea was opened for signature in \r\nMontego Bay, Jamaica. It was a triumph of international \r\ndiplomacy and international law, resulting from the \r\nThird United Nations Conference on the Law of the \r\nSea, one of the longest and most complex lawmaking \r\nnegotiations in history.\r\nToday, 30 years on, the Convention and the norms \r\nit embodies can be counted among the core group of \r\ninternational instruments that we call “universal”. The \r\npromise of the Convention is a framework within which \r\nall States can be secure and prosper through interaction \r\non the basis of an agreed, rules-based system.\r\nAustralia is the sixth largest country in land area \r\nand the world’s largest island State, with the third-\r\nlargest marine jurisdiction in the world. We straddle \r\nthree oceans — the Pacific, the Indian and the Southern. \r\nWe are home to one of the world’s largest repositories \r\nof marine biodiversity — the Great Barrier Reef. And \r\nwe rely on maritime transport for over 80 per cent of \r\nthe volume of our international trade. For Australia, \r\nthe rules, institutions and principles established \r\nthrough the Convention are of crucial importance to \r\nour national security, our continuing prosperity and \r\nour relationships with other countries, particularly our \r\nneighbours.\r\nThirty years ago, Australia signalled its strong \r\ncommitment to the Convention by signing it in Montego \r\nBay immediately upon its opening. We were the third \r\ncountry to become a party to both the Convention and \r\nthe 1994 Agreement relating to the implementation of \r\nPart XI of the United Nations Convention on the Law of \r\nthe Sea of 10 December 1982, which together embody \r\nour constitution for the oceans.\r\nTime and again throughout the world, Australia has \r\ndemonstrated its commitment to that system through \r\nour actions. Through technical and legal assistance \r\nwe are helping countries in our region and beyond to \r\nrealize the economic potential of their continental shelf \r\nresources. Since our own submission to the Commission \r\non the Limits of the Continental Shelf, which defined \r\nthe outer limits of our 2.54-million square kilometre \r\nextended continental shelf, we have worked with over \r\n20 States in that way. Through information exchange, \r\noutreach and on-the-water cooperation, we are working \r\n6 12-63751\r\nA/67/PV.50\r\nwith our Pacific and Southern Ocean partners to \r\npromote compliance with the Convention and to thwart \r\nthe theft of valuable but finite marine resources. \r\nThrough financial assistance we are helping developing \r\ncountries to implement the 1995 Agreement for the \r\nImplementation of the Provisions of the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December \r\n1982 relating to the Conservation and Management \r\nof Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish \r\nStocks in order to enhance fisheries management \r\nthrough a recognition of the role of fisheries and \r\naquaculture in livelihoods and food security.\r\nWe have shown our commitment through \r\nmultilateral pledges to support food security, poverty \r\nalleviation and environmental initiatives, including \r\n$25 million for the Pacific Oceanscape Framework and \r\n$13 million for the Coral Triangle Initiative on Coral \r\nReefs, Fisheries and Food Security.\r\nWe supported the interests of small island \r\ndeveloping States and coastal States at the United \r\nNations Conference on Sustainable Development \r\n(Rio+20) held in June 2012, and we worked to ensure \r\nthat the Rio+20 outcome recognized the importance of \r\noceans for sustainable development. We have worked \r\nto strengthen the ability of competent organizations \r\nat the local, regional and national levels to better \r\ndeal with oceans and the law of the sea, such as by \r\nboosting the capacity of regional fisheries management \r\norganizations so as to promote sustainable management \r\nof fisheries and better oceans management.\r\nAs we reflect on where we have come from and \r\nwhere we are going with the Convention, one thing is \r\ncertain — the international law of the sea has not stood \r\nstill and cannot stand still. It continues to evolve as new \r\nchallenges emerge.\r\nClimate change and the need to achieve genuinely \r\nsustainable fisheries across the globe, as demand for \r\nfood increases, are just two of many challenges that \r\nwe face. As the drafters of the Convention wrote in its \r\npreamble, we need to be “conscious that the problems \r\nof ocean space are closely interrelated and need to \r\nbe considered as a whole”. That should be a guiding \r\nprinciple going forward.\r\nIn that context, Australia welcomes the urgent call \r\nissued at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment to address matters relating to the \r\nconservation of marine biodiversity beyond national \r\njurisdiction. We are encouraged that States agreed on \r\na time frame in which a decision on whether to develop \r\nan international instrument under the Convention \r\nshould be taken.\r\nAustralia is confi dent that the Convention — a \r\nfundamental, pioneering, visionary legal instrument  — \r\ncan continue to develop in response to emerging \r\nchallenges, and we will continue to play a strong and \r\nconstructive role in that endeavour, over the next 30 \r\nyears and beyond.\r\nMr. Jacovides (Cyprus): I consider it a privilege \r\nto represent the Republic of Cyprus at this significant \r\nevent marking of the thirtieth anniversary of the signing \r\nof the United Nations Convention on the Law of the \r\nSea (UNCLOS). Having led my country’s delegation \r\nduring that Conference, I had the honour of signing the \r\nresultant Convention on behalf of Cyprus at Montego \r\nBay in Jamaica, together with my colleague James \r\nDroushiotis, who is also participating in this meeting.\r\nThe Conference was rightly described as the most \r\nsignificant multilateral lawmaking undertaking since \r\nthe United Nations Charter was adopted in 1945, and \r\nthe Convention is seen as the veritable constitution of \r\nthe seas and oceans. All those who value international \r\nlegal order and who toiled long and hard to bring \r\nabout that result — and I am pleased to see many of \r\nthem gathered here today, including President Tommy \r\nKoh — well deserve the satisfaction that they justly \r\nderived from that major accomplishment.\r\nThe Conference was aimed at re-examining, and, \r\nwhere appropriate, recasting virtually all aspects of the \r\nlaw of the sea. It combined the element of codification \r\nwith that of progressive development, with emphasis \r\non the latter. It was thus a lawmaking conference in \r\nthe full sense of the word. New and revolutionary \r\nconcepts were introduced and elaborated, such as the \r\ncommon heritage of humankind, the archipelagic State \r\nand — something of particular significance to Cyprus \r\nin light of recent discoveries of hydrocarbons — the \r\nexclusive economic zone. On the other hand, it has been \r\nfound that other aspects of the law of the sea, such as \r\nfreedom of the high seas and the regime of islands, \r\nhave stood the test of time and should remain as before, \r\nthus demonstrating that novelty is not necessarily \r\nsynonymous with progress. On the whole, the third \r\nUnited Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea was \r\ncharacterized by a judicious blending of elements of \r\nprogressive or even revolutionary change in some \r\nrespects, with those of stability and continuity in other \r\n12-63751 7\r\nA/67/PV.50\r\nrespects, thus helping to preserve a balance between \r\nconflicting claims and interests.\r\nThe Conference was convened against a \r\nbackground of the then recent transformation of the \r\ninternational community, caused by many new States \r\ncoming into existence with the end of the colonial \r\nempires and advances in technology, which brought \r\nopportunities for obtaining new resources from the sea \r\nand the seabed. Newly independent States — Cyprus \r\namong them — which did not have the opportunity \r\nto participate in the formulation of the traditional \r\nlaw of the sea, felt that they should play a full role in \r\nmoulding the contemporary law of the sea in a way that \r\nsafeguarded and promoted their political and economic \r\ninterests.\r\nCyprus, an island State that is at the crossroads of \r\nthree continents — namely, Europe, Asia and Africa — is \r\nvitally concerned with the legal regulation of the uses of \r\nthe sea in a just and orderly manner, ensuring fairness \r\nand predictability. According to legend, it was off the \r\ncoast of Cyprus that Aphrodite, the goddess of love and \r\nbeauty, was born rising from the glittering foam of the \r\nblue sea, near Paphos. According to geology, the island \r\nof Cyprus arose from the seabed, emerging as a result \r\nof the tectonic plates of Africa pushing north and of \r\nAsia Minor pushing south. According to history, our \r\nseafaring tradition and involvement with the sea go \r\nback more than 3,000 years. Today shipping and ship \r\nmanagement are still a major industry. There was a \r\ntime in the eighth century B.C. when Cyprus, with its \r\nample supply of timber for shipbuilding, was known \r\nas the “mistress of the seas”, and in the fourth century \r\nB.C., the Cypriot kingdoms built the bulk of the f leet of \r\nAlexander the Great. \r\nOur past, present and future are inexorably meshed \r\nwith the sea and its uses, most recently the ample supply \r\nof hydrocarbons in our exclusive economic zone. In the \r\nEuropean context, Cyprus, through its presidency of \r\nthe Council of the European Union, which is coming \r\nto a close at the end of this month, has promoted the \r\nIntegrated Maritime Policy, culminating in the adoption \r\nof the Limassol Declaration on a marine and maritime \r\nagenda for jobs and growth. The Limassol Declaration \r\nhas been described as the point of departure for the \r\nsustainable growth of a blue economy and for achieving \r\na good environmental status of marine waters by 2020.\r\nOn occasions such as this, one might be permitted a \r\nbrief look backwards, because of sentiment as well as of \r\nreason, and view our aims and objectives from a broad \r\nperspective, including when the Conference began and \r\nto what extent those aims have been met, both in terms \r\nof the substantive provisions and the peaceful settlement \r\nof disputes, as the issues of primary concern to Cyprus. \r\nIt can be said with conviction and, perhaps, with a \r\ncertain amount of satisfaction that those objectives \r\nhave, to a large extent, been met, both in terms of our \r\nnational interest and from the broader perspective of \r\nthe interests of the international community.\r\nIn order to very briefly indicate some of those \r\nconcerns, I will cite the extent of the territorial \r\nwaters, which, under article 3 of the Convention, is \r\nbased on the general rule of 12 nautical miles, which \r\nCyprus had already claimed since 1964; the position of \r\nislands, which, under article 121, clearly vindicates our \r\nstrongly held view that islands are fully entitled to all \r\nthe zones of maritime jurisdiction, namely, territorial \r\nsea, contiguous zone, exclusive economic zone and \r\ncontinental shelf, no less than any other land territory; \r\nthe question of enclosed and semi-enclosed seas, \r\narticles 122 and 123; the question of the delimitation \r\nof the zones of maritime jurisdiction between States \r\nwith opposite or adjacent coasts, articles 15, 74 and \r\n83; questions on the protection of archaeological and \r\nhistorical objects found at sea, articles 149 and 303; \r\nand the protection of the environment, and so forth. \r\nLikewise, the system for the peaceful settlement of \r\ndisputes, very important, especially for the protection \r\nof small States, while not as far-reaching as we would \r\nhave preferred, marks a significant advance from the \r\npreviously existing situation.\r\nHaving played an active role during the Conference, \r\nCyprus was among the first to sign and ratify the \r\nConvention and subsequent agreements. With 164 \r\nStates parties and, hopefully, more to come soon, \r\nthe Convention has achieved near universality, and \r\nit is generally acknowledged that its provisions have \r\nacquired the status of customary rules of international \r\nlaw and are therefore binding on all States. In that \r\ncontext, we were pleased to hear this morning the \r\nstatement by the United States.\r\nIndeed, the Convention could not and did not \r\nfully satisfy all delegations in all respects, despite the \r\nclarity that it provides on issues of jurisdiction. One \r\ncould point to ambiguities where there should have \r\nbeen clarity, to complexities where there could have \r\nbeen streamlining, and to exceptions where there could \r\nhave been general rules. But it had to be accepted that \r\n8 12-63751\r\nA/67/PV.50\r\nthis major accomplishment in multilateral lawmaking \r\ndeserves to be celebrated for what was achieved at \r\nthe time and what has been achieved since through \r\njudicial practice — and we heard this morning from \r\nJudge Greenwood and Judge Yanai — and the practice \r\nof States, towards the rule of law in the seas and oceans \r\nand the peaceful resolution of disputes among States.\r\nMrs. Niang (Senegal) (spoke in French): At the \r\noutset, I would like to thank the Secretary-General for \r\npreparing the report contained in document A/67/79 \r\nand addenda 1 and 2, on oceans and the law of the sea. \r\nThese documents provide us with valuable information \r\nconcerning developments in maritime and law of the \r\nsea issues.\r\nThe consideration of this agenda item coincides \r\nthis year with the thirtieth anniversary of the opening \r\nfor signature of the United Nations Convention on \r\nthe Law of the Sea. Allow me therefore, on behalf of \r\nthe Senegalese delegation, to pay exuberant tribute \r\nto the pioneers — both men and women — who \r\nworked tirelessly over many years on the drafting and \r\nratification of the Convention. That legal instrument \r\nhas ultimately convinced even the most skeptical of its \r\nrelevance, usefulness and benefit to all humankind and \r\nnow enjoys accession by 162 States parties, representing \r\nthe overwhelming majority of States.\r\nThus, and thanks in large part to the Convention, the \r\nlaw of the sea is now one of the most complete bodies of \r\ninternational law. It plays a crucial role in establishing \r\na safe international environment through its use in the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes by such international \r\ntribunals as the International Court of Justice and the \r\nInternational Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. With a \r\nview to achieving the noble goals underpinning the \r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, it is \r\nessential that all bodies established under it be provided \r\nwith sufficient resources to effectively carry out their \r\nmandates.\r\nThe oceans and seas cover the largest part of our \r\nplanet’s surface and continue to represent enormous \r\neconomic potential and a true factor of development for \r\nthe entire world. Indeed, their great wealth of natural \r\nresources contributes enormously to global prosperity \r\nand food security, while remaining the best platform for \r\ninternational trade. That is why, from an international \r\nperspective in which the world is increasingly \r\nconfronted with recurring acute and multifaceted crises \r\nthat further undermine and strain economic prospects, \r\ncompromises, necessitated by the need to arrive at \r\nconsensus, had to be the price for reaching a successful \r\nconclusion to a complicated and ambitious undertaking. \r\nThe Convention and its dispute settlement system go a \r\nlong way in an imperfect world to meeting this need. \r\nCyprus, in compliance with the Convention, \r\nproclaimed its exclusive economic zone in 2004 and, \r\npursuant to article 74, signed delimitation agreements \r\nof its zone with three of its neighbouring countries \r\nto the south and east on the basis of the medial line \r\nand with a provision for arbitration if needed. Based \r\non the proclamation of the exclusive economic zone \r\nand the relevant delimitation agreements, Cyprus \r\nexercises sovereign rights and jurisdiction in relation \r\nto areas beyond and adjacent to its territorial sea for the \r\npurposes set out in article 56 of the Convention, which \r\nalso reflects customary international law. \r\nIn addition, Cyprus has, as a matter of international \r\nlaw, inherent sovereign rights over the continental shelf \r\ncovering the same area, which it exercises in conformity \r\nwith article 77. In particular, in relation to hydrocarbon \r\nresources, the Republic of Cyprus has exclusive sovereign \r\nrights, inter alia, for the purpose of exploration and \r\nexploitation in its exclusive economic zone and over its \r\ncontinental shelf and has already embarked on drilling \r\nactivities for hydrocarbon exploration in the southern \r\npart of its exclusive economic zone’s continental shelf. \r\nAs in all countries in the world, the sovereign rights in \r\nthe exclusive economic zone belong to internationally \r\nrecognized Governments, not to national communities \r\nor minorities within a State.\r\nIt is our firm belief that all States should mutually \r\nrespect the lawful exercise of their neighbours’ rights \r\nin the sea areas where each State has sovereignty or \r\nsovereign rights and exercises jurisdiction in accordance \r\nwith the Convention. On that basis, Cyprus already \r\npromotes peaceful cooperation on the exploration and \r\nexploitation of natural resources, in accordance with \r\nthe Convention, with and between all the States in \r\nthe south-eastern Mediterranean, in order to achieve \r\nsustainable development and prosperity for the entire \r\nregion. Cooperation, in that respect, can contribute to \r\nregional integration and conflict resolution, and we \r\nstrongly call on all States in the region to refrain from \r\nacting or threatening to act in violation of Article 2, \r\nparagraph 4, of the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nTo conclude, as I began, on a positive note, today’s \r\nevent marking the thirtieth anniversary of the signing of \r\n12-63751 9\r\nA/67/PV.50\r\nrepresent serious threats to sustainable fisheries and \r\nthe preservation of marine ecosystems. In depleting \r\nfish stocks and destroying marine habitats and \r\ntheir natural renewal cycles, illegal, unreported and \r\nunregulated fishing remains the most worrisome \r\nproblem, in particular for developing countries lacking \r\nthe necessary mechanisms to control their maritime \r\nareas. Consequently, supplementary measures are \r\nneeded to further combat that growing phenomenon \r\nand its devastating consequences. \r\nAnother problematic area is the legal status of \r\nnew resources, particularly of deep seabed genetic \r\nresources, which remains a subject of dispute between \r\nMember States. In that regard, in accordance with the \r\nspirit of the relevant international conventions, we \r\nreiterate our consistent position and belief that those \r\nresources should be governed by the principle of the \r\ncommon heritage of humankind in order to ensure their \r\nfair and equal use by all peoples of the world.\r\nMr. León González (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): Cuba \r\njoins in the commemoration of the thirtieth anniversary \r\nof the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea \r\n(UNCLOS), which is a fundamental landmark in the \r\ncodification of international law that has been ratified \r\nby the vast majority of the States Members of the United \r\nNations. The Convention is of fundamental importance \r\nin maintaining and strengthening peace, stability and \r\nthe sustainable development of the oceans and the seas. \r\nIt embodies an appropriate and universally recognized \r\nlegal framework under which all activities involving \r\nthe oceans and seas should be carried out.\r\nThe Cuban delegation believes that matters of such \r\ngreat importance as those related to the oceans and \r\nthe law of the sea should be permanently supervised \r\nby the General Assembly in order to guarantee the \r\nstrengthened coordination of those activities to the \r\nbenefit of all Member States. Cuba highlights the \r\nimportant and continued assistance role of the United \r\nNations Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the \r\nSea. \r\nGiven that Cuba is an island located in the fragile \r\necosystem of the Caribbean Sea, matters relating to the \r\nseas and oceans are of particular interest to us. Despite \r\nsuffering from an economic, trade and financial \r\nblockade for more than 50 years, my country has pursued \r\nits determined effort to implement national strategies \r\non the sustainable development and protection of the \r\nmarine environment aimed at the efficient, effective \r\nthe sustainable management and use of oceans and their \r\nresources today appear key to the survival of a large \r\nsegment of current and future generations. From that \r\npoint of view, our actions and approach must continue \r\nto lead us to unite our forces and coordinate our efforts \r\nin order to transform the sustainable management of \r\noceans and seas into reality.\r\nI am pleased to note that, in that spirit, we have \r\nestablished the Open-ended Informal Consultative \r\nProcess on Oceans and the Law of the Sea, based on the \r\nprovisions of the 1982 United Nations Convention on \r\nthe Law of the Sea and the goals of chapter 17 of Agenda \r\n21, thereby responding to the concern to strengthen and \r\nimprove international coordination and cooperation \r\nin the area of oceans and seas, among others. The \r\nprocess serves as an important instrument to support \r\nthe sustainable development of seas and oceans, and \r\nseeks to develop an integrated, multidisciplinary and \r\nintersectoral approach comprising various relevant \r\naspects. \r\nFor that reason, the discussions of the thirteenth \r\nmeeting of the Consultative Process, held in New \r\nYork in June, were focused on renewable marine \r\nenergies. The ocean and seas, because of their immense \r\npotential in that area, constitute an important vector \r\nfor developing related energy sources to deal with a \r\nworrisome energy crisis that risks deteriorating even \r\nfurther in the decades to come, absent significant \r\nprogress in developing alternative energy. \r\nIn terms of sustainable development efforts and \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals, \r\nrenewable energy today appears to be increasingly \r\nnecessary in our struggle for universal access to energy \r\nand enhanced economic and social development. We \r\nwould hope that the recommendations that resulted \r\nfrom the meeting and were transmitted to the General \r\nAssembly will be the object of that body’s particular \r\nattention. \r\nIn managing the finite resources of the oceans \r\nand seas, we must always keep in mind the balance \r\nnecessary to fully meet our needs while safeguarding \r\nthe interests of future generations. Along those lines, \r\nthe protection of the marine environment and the \r\nsustainable and responsible conservation and use of \r\nmarine biological resources are essential.\r\nFrom that perspective, such harmful practices \r\nas illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, \r\nunsustainable fishing or even marine pollution \r\n10 12-63751\r\nA/67/PV.50\r\nand progressive application of the provisions of the \r\nConvention.\r\nCuba has sound national legislation addressing \r\ncrimes that take place at sea, in particular the illicit \r\ntrafficking of narcotic drugs and psychotropic \r\nsubstances, illegal human trafficking and piracy. \r\nMy country is also endowed with an institutional \r\nbody devoted not only to ensuring compliance with \r\ninternational norms, but also to protecting and \r\npreserving of ecosystems and the environment.\r\nCuba has worked intensively to strengthen bilateral \r\nand regional cooperation based on provisions of \r\ninternational law, with due respect for safeguarding \r\nStates’ sovereign jurisdiction over their territorial seas \r\nand the management of resources in their exclusive \r\neconomic zone. We advocate the broad exchange of \r\nscientific and technical knowledge, as well as the free \r\ntransfer of sustainable technologies and increased \r\nfinancial and technical assistance to developing \r\ncountries.\r\nIt is important to preserve the integrity of the \r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and \r\nthe implementation of its provisions as a whole. It is \r\nnot acceptable for Member States to address matters of \r\nvital importance, such as those relating to the seas and \r\noceans, through parallel initiatives outside the General \r\nAssembly and the United Nations system.\r\nCuba further believes that it is necessary to \r\ncontinue to work to guarantee that all States without \r\nexception will benefit from the resources in the Area, \r\nincluding its biodiversity and genetic resources. It is \r\nour responsibility to work to realize the principle of the \r\ncommon heritage of humankind for those resources, as \r\nclearly established in the United Nations Convention \r\non the Law of the Sea. We cannot allow them to be \r\npatented by transnational enterprises. Those resources \r\nare not the exclusive patrimony of a group of States \r\nwith the material and financial resources to develop \r\nthe wealth of the Area. The international community \r\nmust work to ensure that benefits are equitable and not \r\naffect the marine environment or ecosystems. We must \r\nalso protect the ability of a State to exercise sovereignty \r\nover the resources in its exclusive economic zone and \r\ncontinental shelf.\r\nWe are therefore concerned about policies and \r\ninitiatives that undermine the regime of the Convention \r\nand that may lead to decisions being taken outside \r\nof the General Assembly. An example of that is the \r\ncurrent approach to new sustainable uses of the oceans, \r\nincluding the conservation and management of the \r\nbiological diversity in the seabed beyond the limits of \r\nnational jurisdiction. Cuba believes that, on that issue, \r\nStates must be governed by the principles established in \r\nthe Convention, which provides that marine scientific \r\nresearch in the area must be carried out exclusively for \r\npeaceful purposes and the benefit of humankind as a \r\nwhole.\r\nOur country has repeatedly voiced its concern \r\nat various summits and meetings about the dramatic \r\nconsequences of climate change for humankind. \r\nOcean systems are no exception to that reality. The \r\nlaw of the sea should become the tool of choice for \r\nthe international community in avoiding irreparable \r\ndamage to marine ecosystems. Irresponsible human \r\nactivity in the natural environment and the unbridled \r\nexploitation of natural resources in various ecosystems \r\nhave led to many natural disasters. The continuous \r\nrise in sea level, for example, threatens the territorial \r\nintegrity of many States, especially that of small island \r\nStates, some of which are destined to disappear unless \r\nimmediate measures are adopted.\r\nThe international community is called upon to \r\ntake immediate action on those issues. Developed \r\ncountries must meet their financial obligations, honour \r\ntheir assistance commitments, and in particular reduce \r\nactivities and practices that have affected and continue \r\nto affect the delicate ecological balance of the world.\r\nWe cannot conclude without first expressing \r\nthanks for the efforts of the coordinators of the draft \r\nresolutions on this subject. They have done excellent \r\nwork despite the technical complexity and sensitivity \r\nof the subjects for Members of the Organization. Cuba \r\nreiterates its support for the draft resolutions before \r\nus and reiterates its commitment and willingness to \r\nwork in outreach on matters relating to the law of the \r\nsea and on the unfettered application of the norms of \r\ninternational law on the subject.\r\nMr. De Vega (Philippines): At the outset, my \r\ndelegation associates itself with the statement made by \r\nthe representative of the Republic of Korea on behalf of \r\nthe Group of Asia-Pacific States.\r\nA few minutes are never enough to talk about \r\nthe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea \r\n(UNCLOS), but as the eleventh ratifying State party \r\nthe Philippines wishes to say a few words.\r\n12-63751 11\r\nA/67/PV.50\r\nsea and contiguous zone, the continental shelf, the high \r\nseas, and fishing and conservation of living resources \r\nof the high seas. However, the second was largely a \r\nfailure due to Cold War politics. By 1967, 66 nations \r\nhad set a 12-mile territorial sea limit, while only 25 still \r\nused the old three-mile limit. A few claimed a 200-mile \r\nlimit.\r\nIn the context of those contending claims, we \r\nremember Ambassador Arvid Pardo of Malta. His \r\nstirring speech on 1 November 1967, given in this \r\nvery Hall, led to the third and final United Nations \r\nConference on the Law of the Sea (see A/C.1/PV.1515). \r\nIn the spirit of the anniversary of that date, we pause \r\nto remember him and the men and women from the \r\nPhilippines and from all States parties who actively \r\ncontributed to the vision of peace at sea and of a just \r\nand comprehensive rule for the world’s oceans and its \r\nresources. Ambassador Pardo’s vision of the common \r\nheritage of humankind, which should help bankroll a \r\nfund that would help close the gap between rich and poor \r\nnations, is now enshrined in article 136 of UNCLOS.\r\nUsing the consensus process, the third Conference \r\nmade headway on setting territorial and maritime limits, \r\nfreedom of navigation, archipelagic status, exclusive \r\neconomic zones, continental shelf jurisdiction, deep \r\nseabed mining, the exploitation regime, the protection \r\nof the marine environment, scientific research and the \r\nsettlement of disputes.\r\nOn 24 September, we held the High-level Meeting \r\non the Rule of Law at the National and International \r\nLevels. We adopted a Declaration (resolution 67/1) \r\nthat recognizes the institutions, working methods and \r\nrelationships available to make the rule of law relevant \r\nto peace and security, human rights and development. \r\nThose institutions include the treaty bodies of UNCLOS.\r\nWe reiterate our full support and confidence in \r\nthose treaty bodies: the International Tribunal for the \r\nLaw of the Sea, the International Seabed Authority and \r\nthe Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, \r\ntogether with their leaders, members and secretariats, \r\nwho are bringing life to the vision of those who went \r\nbefore us. We also express our appreciation to the \r\nDivision for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea.\r\nThe Philippines views the rule of law at the \r\ninternational level through the prism of paragraph 1 of \r\nArticle 1 of the United Nations Charter, which states \r\nthat the purposes of the United Nations are:\r\nFirst of all, we call on all States that have not \r\nyet done so to ratify UNCLOS and contribute to its \r\nuniversality. UNCLOS has withstood the test of time. \r\nFor us, that constitution for the oceans anchors the rule \r\nof law as it governs the rights and responsibilities of \r\nnations — large and small, rich and poor, coastal and \r\nlandlocked — in their use of the world’s oceans. Let us \r\nremember that UNCLOS became necessary to ensure \r\nglobal and regional peace, cooperation and stability \r\nthrough the just and sustainable use of marine natural \r\nresources.\r\nIf respected fully by all States parties, UNCLOS \r\nprevents the use or the threat of use of force over \r\nour shared resource, which until recently had led to \r\ninequity, injustice and even bloodshed. The cooperation \r\nfor common development that UNCLOS envisions will \r\nsucceed only if the agreed maritime zones it carefully \r\ndemarcates are honoured in good faith.\r\nIn the fifteenth century, European Powers launched \r\nthe Age of Discovery, or the Age of Exploration, by \r\nseeking alternative trading routes to Asia through the \r\nseas. That allowed the global mapping of the world, \r\nand thus the modern era was born. But along with \r\nexpanding trade, the great exchange of culture and \r\nscientific knowledge between East and West and the \r\nfounding of the nation State also came the creation of \r\ncolonial empires supported by the slave trade with its \r\nunfortunate legacy.\r\nThrough it all, the sea was the conduit for both \r\nthe good and the not-so-good. In 1609, the great Hugo \r\nGrotius published Mare Liberum, his seminal treatise \r\non the free sea. Grotius proposed that the sea was \r\ninternational territory and the common property of all \r\nnations, and not susceptible to occupation. All nations \r\nwere free to use it, and no nation could deny others \r\naccess to it. And yet the inequality among nations \r\nmeant inequality in the use of the sea. Nations sought to \r\nextend their claims ostensibly to protect fish stocks and \r\nenforce pollution controls, but also to take advantage \r\nof mineral resources in the continental shelf. In 1945, \r\nUnited States President Harry Truman set off the race \r\nto the depths of the seas, citing customary international \r\nlaw to extend United States control over its continental \r\nshelf.\r\nThrough deft diplomacy, the three United Nations \r\nConferences on the Law of the Sea were convened in \r\n1956, 1960 and 1973. The first Conference succeeded \r\nin adopting four separate conventions on the territorial \r\n12 12-63751\r\nA/67/PV.50\r\nMrs. Dunlop (Brazil): As we gather here today to \r\ncelebrate the thirtieth anniversary of the opening for \r\nsignature of the United Nations Convention on the Law \r\nof the Sea (UNCLOS), the near universal membership \r\nof the Convention is in and of itself a vehement \r\ntestimony to the relevance of UNCLOS to settling, in \r\na spirit of mutual understanding and cooperation, all \r\nissues relating to the law of the sea and its important \r\ncontribution to the maintenance of peace, justice and \r\nprogress for all peoples of the world.\r\nThe Convention is considered by some to be the \r\nculmination of thousands of years of international \r\nrelations, conflict and now nearly universal adherence \r\nto an enduring order for ocean space that is the most \r\nsignificant achievement for international law since \r\nthe United Nations Charter. The principle of equity, \r\nas applied in the Convention, provides a vantage point \r\nfrom which to underscore its transformative character, \r\nfor UNCLOS consolidated the vision that the problems \r\nof ocean space are closely interrelated and need to be \r\nconsidered as a whole. It aimed at a legal order for \r\nthe seas and oceans that would facilitate international \r\ncommunication and promote the peaceful uses of the \r\nseas and oceans, the equitable and efficient utilization \r\nof their resources, the conservation of their living \r\nresources and the study, protection and preservation of \r\nthe marine environment.\r\nThe principle of equity is widely applied in \r\nUNCLOS in resolving maritime issues. The terms \r\n“equity” and “equitable” appear about 32 times in \r\nUNCLOS, especially in the areas of maritime boundary \r\ndelimitation; the sharing of benefits and resources; \r\nconflict resolution; and the rights of landlocked \r\nand geographically disadvantaged States. It can be \r\nargued that like the 1967 Outer Space Treaty before \r\nit, UNCLOS, in enshrining in its Part XI the principle \r\nof the common heritage of humankind as applicable to \r\nthe Area and its resources, consecrated equity as the \r\nguiding principle for international cooperation beyond \r\nareas of national jurisdiction.\r\nAt the same time, the Convention also recognizes in \r\nPart XI the rights and legitimate interests of any coastal \r\nState across whose jurisdiction resource deposits in \r\nthe Area lie, including the right to take such measures \r\nconsistent with the relevant principles of Part XII as \r\nmay be necessary to prevent, mitigate or eliminate \r\ngrave and imminent danger to its coastline.\r\n“to bring about by peaceful means, and in conformity \r\nwith the principles of justice and international law, \r\nadjustment or settlement of international disputes \r\nor situations which might lead to a breach of the \r\npeace”.\r\nThis is the very rationale of the 1982 Manila Declaration \r\non the Peaceful Settlement of International Disputes, \r\nthe thirtieth anniversary of which the General Assembly \r\nis also commemorating this year. \r\nUNCLOS has never been more important to \r\ndeveloping countries like the Philippines than today, \r\nwhen overlapping maritime claims in our part of the \r\nworld threaten as never before peace and prosperity in \r\nour part of the world. UNCLOS provides the proper \r\nand proven mechanism for the peaceful settlement \r\nof disputes to resolve such claims, in order to ensure \r\nglobal and regional peace, cooperation and stability \r\nin the just and sustainable use of marine natural \r\nresources. We believe that the rules-based approach in \r\nUNCLOS is the way forward in addressing maritime \r\ndisputes, including in our own region. We acknowledge \r\nAmbassador Tommy Koh of Singapore for his statement \r\nregarding the role of the International Tribunal for the \r\nLaw of the Sea and the International Court of Justice in \r\nthe settlement of disputes. \r\nOur position is clear — we seek calm, peace, free \r\nnavigation and trade in our region. We renew our call \r\non those involved to avail themselves of the dispute \r\nsettlement mechanism provided for in UNCLOS, even \r\nas we ask them to sustain the dialogue and continue \r\nexploring opportunities for cooperation to fulfil our \r\nshared aspirations. \r\nIn this day and age, the sea should no longer be a \r\nsource of conflict. If there is anything that the rule of \r\nlaw and UNCLOS teach us, it is that the weak, if their \r\ncause is just, should have no fear of the mighty. It is \r\nthat, through the work of the United Nations, the rule \r\nof law in international relations has a chance to prevail. \r\nIt is that, through the rule of law, we can demonstrate \r\nthat right is might.\r\nUltimately, great economic, political and even \r\nmilitary power should be used with care, wisdom, \r\ncompassion and generosity for those who have less. \r\nThe beginning of moral leadership, one that seeks and \r\nbuilds peace, is none other than responsibility. That is \r\nthe foundation both of regional harmony and stability \r\nand of international peace and security.\r\n12-63751 13\r\nA/67/PV.50\r\nan efficient and timely manner, and bearing in mind \r\nthe human and financial resources that coastal States, \r\nparticularly developing ones, have to deploy in order to \r\nprepare and submit information to the Commission on \r\nthe limits of their respective continental shelves beyond \r\n200 nautical miles.\r\nAlso noteworthy is the International Seabed \r\nAuthority’s completion, as warden of the common \r\nheritage of humankind, of three mining codes; its \r\napproval of five new plans of work for exploring minerals \r\nin the deep oceans, bringing the number of active \r\nexploration contracts it has issued to 17, compared with \r\nonly eight in 2010; and the environmental management \r\nplan for the Clarion-Clipperton Zone.\r\nWe pay homage all those who have contributed \r\nthrough their leadership to the efficient and effective \r\nfunctioning of the three bodies established under \r\nthe Convention, represented by Judge Shunji Yanai, \r\nPresident of ITLOS; Lawrence Folajimi Awosika, \r\nChairman of the Commission on the Limits of the \r\nContinental Shelf; and Nii Allotey Odunton, Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the International Seabed Authority. We also \r\ngreatly appreciate the presence of Judge Christopher \r\nGreenwood, representing the International Court of \r\nJustice, at today’s celebration.\r\nFinally, we wish to commend the initiative of the \r\nGeneral Assembly in holding this celebration and the \r\nunstinting efforts deployed by the Division of Oceans \r\nand the Law of the Sea of the Office of Legal Affairs of \r\nthe United Nations in organizing it. We also welcome \r\nthe many activities organized by States parties to mark \r\nthis anniversary.\r\nMr. Tladi (South Africa): The United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea is an impressive, \r\nmonumental achievement of lawmaking. It is therefore \r\nnot surprising that it has been hailed as a constitution \r\nfor the oceans and the framework within which \r\nall activities in the oceans are to be governed. Its \r\nmomentous comprehensiveness is matched only by the \r\ntireless efforts of the negotiators during the third United \r\nNations Conference on the Law of the Sea. Many States, \r\nand indeed many individuals, contributed immensely \r\nto its success, and it is fitting that we pay tribute to \r\nthem by commemorating the thirtieth anniversary of its \r\nbirth. \r\nSince December 1982, many States and individuals \r\nhave also contributed immensely to its continuing \r\ngrowth. All of them — whether acting as representatives, \r\nWe must also celebrate today the vision of those \r\nwho made the Convention a monument to international \r\ncooperation in treaty-making. Arvid Pardo claimed that \r\nthe concept of the common heritage of humankind, as \r\nenshrined in Part XI of the Convention, challenges the \r\nstructural relationship between rich and poor countries \r\nand amounts to a revolution not merely in the law of the \r\nsea, but also in international relations.\r\nOne can also argue that the general obligation \r\nof States, expressed in article 192 of Part XII of the \r\nConvention, to protect and preserve the maritime \r\nenvironment is a reflection within UNCLOS of the \r\ncentral principle of sustainable development — that of \r\nintergenerational equity. The fulfilment of that general \r\nobligation is a condition for enabling the sustainable \r\nuse of resources not only by present generations but \r\nalso by future ones, and for averting the foreclosure of \r\napplications for resources that the present generation \r\nhas not yet appreciated but could be valuable for future \r\ngenerations.\r\nIn retrospect, that reflects what happened when \r\nthe Convention was negotiated. At that time, the value \r\nof marine biological diversity had not yet been fully \r\nappraised. Today, we know that the applications of \r\nthose resources, particularly in the pharmaceutical \r\nindustry, can benefit humankind as a whole. That is \r\nwhy we are convinced of the urgent need to develop \r\nan implementing agreement under the Convention \r\napplicable to the conservation and sustainable use \r\nof the biological diversity of areas beyond national \r\njurisdiction.\r\nIn conclusion, we should bear in mind that \r\nUNCLOS is 30 years young and very much a living \r\ndocument. Some recent developments attest to that and \r\nto the relevant role of the three bodies established by \r\nthe Convention within their respective mandates.\r\nThe first advisory opinion issued by the \r\nInternational Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) \r\nintroduced elements that would be of help to parties not \r\nonly in interpreting the issue of the responsibility of the \r\nsponsoring State for activities in the Area, but also in \r\ninterpreting the precautionary principle.\r\nOf particular relevance is the ongoing work of \r\nthe Commission on the Limits of the Continental \r\nShelf in considering the large number of submissions \r\nby coastal States. The Commission must continue to \r\nenjoy adequate support to enable it to fulfil its mandate \r\nunder paragraph 8 of article 76 of the Convention in \r\n14 12-63751\r\nA/67/PV.50\r\nmeasures designed to promote inter-generational \r\nequity, protect life on Earth, and ensure that our \r\npenetration into the oceans does not mark the end of life \r\nas we know it. The intra-generational provisions of the \r\nConvention, designed to promote a better life for all of \r\nEarth’s inhabitants, are equally well known and include \r\nthe provisions of article 59 and, most importantly, the \r\ncommon heritage of humankind regime extablished in \r\nPart XI of the Convention.\r\nWhile the principle of the common heritage of \r\nhumankind is the most important contribution that \r\nthe Convention has made to international law, perhaps \r\nits most enduring quality is its constitution-like \r\ncharacter. That character derives not purely from its \r\ncomprehensiveness, but also from the hierarchy it \r\ncreates — the quintessential quality of constitutionalism. \r\nLike any constitution, the Convention reserves for itself \r\na place of primacy. However, it creates the possibilities \r\nfor a detailed normative mosaic established by States \r\nand organizations through agreement.\r\nAs we stand back and take stock of all that has \r\nbeen achieved in the past 30 years, we should also seek \r\nto enrich this mosaic by ensuring that the twin vision \r\nof Ambassador Pardo continues to live on through the \r\nframework of the Convention. The process initiated by \r\nthe General Assembly in resolution 66/231, together \r\nwith the commitment of our world leaders to reaching \r\na decision on an implementing agreement by the end of \r\nthe Assembly’s sixty-ninth session, provide an excellent \r\nopportunity to enrich our mosaic in this way.\r\nTo that end, I would like to restate what we said in \r\n2009. The common heritage of mankind principle is not \r\nsolely about benefit-sharing; it is just as much about \r\nconservation and preservation. The principle is about \r\nsolidarity not only in the preservation and conservation \r\nof a good we all share and therefore should protect, but \r\nalso in ensuring that this good, which we all share, is for \r\nthe benefit of us all. Our continued and steadfast call for \r\nan implementing agreement for the Convention on the \r\nconservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity \r\nin areas beyond national jurisdiction is rooted in our \r\ndesire to contribute to that mosaic of the Convention in \r\nfaithful fulfilment of Ambassador Pardo’s vision.\r\nMr. Zegers Santa Cruz (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nI speak on the occasion of the thirtieth anniversary of \r\nthe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea \r\n(UNCLOS) and the great Conference that prepared it, \r\nat which I had the honour to lead the Chilean delegation \r\nmembers of the various institutions created to oversee \r\ndifferent aspects of the Convention, academics \r\ncontributing to its understanding and development, \r\nmembers of civil society pushing its boundaries in \r\na way that ensures its continued effectiveness, the \r\nSecretariat, whose contributions are felt but often \r\nunrecognized — should be paid tribute to today.\r\nIt was once said that the \r\n“dark oceans were the womb of life: from the \r\nprotecting oceans life emerged. We still bear in \r\nour bodies — in our blood, in the salty bitterness \r\nof our tears — the marks of this remote past. \r\nRetracing the past, man, the present dominator of \r\nthe emerged earth, is now returning to the ocean \r\ndepths. His penetration of the deep could mark the \r\nbeginning of the end for man, and indeed for life as \r\nwe know it on this earth; it could also be a unique \r\nopportunity to lay solid foundations for a peaceful \r\nand increasingly prosperous future for all peoples” \r\n(A/C.1/PV.1515, para. 7).\r\nIn the powerful 1967 speech from which that \r\nbeautiful and poetic passage was drawn, Ambassador \r\nArvid Pardo spoke both of the potential benefits and \r\nof the incalculable dangers that technological advances \r\nin deep-sea capabilities held. I have quoted from this \r\nbeautiful, poetic passage not only because it is beautiful \r\nand poetic; I have quoted from this passage not only \r\nto pay tribute to the man on whom the title of “father \r\nof the Convention” is bestowed, although that is surely \r\none of the reasons. We have quoted from it also because \r\nin it we see what inspired him and consequently what \r\nthe founding rationale for the Convention is — the twin \r\ndesires of ensuring both the survival of life on Earth \r\nand a better life for all who live in it. Those desires \r\ntranslate into inter- and intra-generational equity and \r\nconstitute the essence of sustainable development.\r\nAs we mark the thirtieth anniversary, it is important \r\nthat we remember that this is what is at the heart of \r\nthe Convention. Indeed, the Convention, in living up \r\nto its constitutional character, contains an impressive \r\ncatalogue of provisions designed to give effect to those \r\ntwo desires while also creating institutions to oversee \r\nits objectives. The many environmental provisions of \r\nthe Convention contained in Part XII are well known \r\nand need not be restated. To those we can add the \r\nregime-specific environmental provisions in Parts \r\nV, VII, XI and XIII of the Convention, which add to \r\nthe richness of the body of environmental protection \r\n12-63751 15\r\nA/67/PV.50\r\nocean activities that relate to the oceans and seas. It \r\ncompletely covers their use, including communication, \r\neconomic exploitation, fishing, scientific research, \r\npollution and general matters of peace and security. \r\nIt has appropriately defined and described maritime \r\nterritory and the scope of national jurisdiction and the \r\nfreedom of the seas. \r\nIt is worth highlighting some of the key \r\nachievements within its broad ambit. These include the \r\nestablishment of an unprecedented mandatory dispute \r\nsettlement system that guarantees stability, compliance \r\nwith the Convention’s mandates, as well as its fair \r\nimplementation; a regime and an Authority charged \r\nwith governing the seabed beyond national jurisdiction \r\nbased on its designation as the common heritage of \r\nhumankind, a topic that has been widely discussed \r\nat this commemorative meeting; and a regime for the \r\neconomic exploitation of the seas and oceans based on \r\nan exclusive economic zone of 200 miles for coastal \r\nStates and the freedoms of the high seas. I would like \r\nto dwell for a moment on that fundamental institution, \r\nwhich is the core of the new law of the sea.\r\nThe Convention defined the reach of territorial \r\nsovereignty as up to 12 miles or the territorial sea; \r\nan exclusive economic zone of 200 miles over which \r\nthe coastal State exercises sovereign rights and \r\njurisdiction without affecting international freedom of \r\ncommunication; and the high seas, where traditional \r\nfreedoms are preserved. In the exclusive economic \r\nzone, the coastal State exercises sovereign rights \r\nover resources and other economic uses, and holds \r\njurisdiction over scientific research, pollution and other \r\nmatters. Third States enjoy freedom of navigation and \r\noverflight.\r\nThe universal force of that institution has allowed \r\nfor peaceful cooperation and greater order in the \r\noceans, greater care of the marine environment, \r\nand improved conservation and more equitable use \r\nof fishing resources. Latin America, including my \r\ncountry, may be said to have played a decisive role in \r\nthe conception, negotiation and success of the 200-\r\nmile exclusive economic zone, including through an \r\nimportant contribution of my country.\r\nIn 1947, Chile was the first State in the world to \r\ndeclare a 200-mile maritime area under its jurisdiction, \r\nwhich it subsequently designated as an economic zone. \r\nThe 1952 Declaration on the Maritime Zone between \r\nChile, Peru and Ecuador established a 200-mile \r\nfrom the preparatory stage up to its signing in Montego \r\nBay.\r\nThe United Nations Convention on the Law of \r\nthe Sea (UNCLOS) is a monumental diplomatic and \r\nlegal achievement. It regulates human activity in more \r\nthan two-thirds of the planet, stating the basic rules \r\ngoverning the seas and oceans, and covering their \r\nwidespread uses. It is truly, as it has been called, the \r\nconstitution of the oceans.\r\nThe Third United Nations Conference on the Law \r\nof the Sea was the largest and certainly one of the most \r\nimportant meetings of its kind in the twentieth century; \r\nit was a notable success of international cooperation, \r\nthe United Nations and the history of codification. \r\nPractically all of the world’s nations participated \r\nin the preparation of the Convention and are now \r\noperating under its legal force. Through conventional \r\nor customary law it is the law of the sea; through the \r\nConvention it can be said to have become universalized \r\nas the law of the sea.\r\nDespite its breadth and content, it was negotiated \r\nby consensus, as manifested by its general acceptance \r\nby the vast majority of States that are party to it as \r\nwell as by those few that still are not, as we heard \r\nearlier in this Hall. That long, participatory negotiating \r\nprocess and its outcome constitute a valuable model \r\nfor other exercises in the progressive development of \r\ninternational law.\r\nThe Convention enjoys general consensus, and its \r\ncentral rules have become part of international custom. \r\nIt is respected and implemented by most States, and \r\nis applied by international courts. It has given rise \r\nto a genuine legal system. Other instruments have \r\nbeen forged under its auspices, including the 1995 \r\nAgreement for the Implementation of the Provisions \r\nof the United Nations Convention on the Law of the \r\nSea of 10 December 1982 relating to the Conservation \r\nand Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly \r\nMigratory Fish Stocks, and the regional fisheries \r\nmanagement arrangements; the development of law \r\nconcerning the seabed beyond national jurisdiction; \r\nagreements or understandings on port use; numerous \r\ninstruments concerning pollution and scientific \r\nresearch, along with other legal texts related to the \r\nmajor subjects of such research, as well as extensive \r\ncase law, doctrine and international practice. \r\nAs was clearly noted at the Meeting of the Parties, \r\nthe Convention is a binding legal framework for all \r\n16 12-63751\r\nA/67/PV.50\r\nmaritime zone inter se and universally. Other separate \r\ndeclarations of jurisdiction followed that South Pacific \r\npact, which was joined by Colombia. Subsequently, in \r\n1970 and thereafter, during the regional meetings held \r\nin Lima, Montevideo and Santo Domingo, a 200-mile \r\nmaritime zone was defined, with economic implications \r\nfor almost the entire region.\r\nHowever, it was thanks to the deep involvement of \r\nthe countries of the South Pacific and Latin America \r\nthat the new law was conceived, developed and finalized \r\nas part of the great Conference whose anniversary we \r\ncelebrate today. \r\nBetween 1970 and 1973, during what we could \r\ncall the pre-Conference era, and then in the Seabed \r\nCommittee and the Preparatory Committee, the concept \r\nof a 200-mile economic zone was outlined, developed \r\nand supported. There was growing support for a legal \r\nconcept that would provide an international solution \r\nto adequately address appropriate fishing and other \r\neconomic uses, while ensuring equitable treatment of \r\nall stakeholders, the protection of the environment and \r\nits resources, and freedom of navigation and overflight \r\nand their consequences. \r\nDuring that period, an informal regional group \r\nof coastal States was formed to work to develop the \r\nnew concept. Beyond Latin America, the concept was \r\ndiscussed in the Asian-African Legal Committee and \r\nbecame the subject of numerous African proposals, \r\nlegal theses, consultations, comments and writings \r\nfrom a variety of sources. The notion was added to \r\nthe list of subjects and issues — or pre-conference \r\nagenda — for the Preparatory Committee of the \r\nConference. The resolution calling for a broad, unified \r\nand comprehensive conference that would address \r\nall the problems of the seas and oceans gave due \r\nimportance to that legal concept and to the need for its \r\nsubsequent development.\r\nDuring that same preparatory period, in what \r\nwould come to be a decisive moment, the Evensen \r\nGroup, named for the Norwegian jurist who informally \r\nconvened a small group of experts from around the \r\nworld to represent different realities and stakeholders. \r\nThe group narrowed and modified positions that later \r\ninformed successive informal negotiating texts that, \r\nin turn, formed the basis of the extensive work by \r\nconsensus of the Conference.\r\nThe African presidents’ agreement of \r\n1973 — which, based on a text from Kenya, declared a \r\n200-mile economic zone as a regional definition — was \r\na decisive element in the international negotiations. \r\nWith that precedent, when the actual Conference started \r\nin 1974 there was already a majority that favoured some \r\nform of a maritime zone of 200 miles with a sovereign \r\nbut economic content, without affecting international \r\ncommunication. That was then reflected in a draft \r\nsubmitted by a dozen countries, including Chile, from \r\nall regions during the first substantive session of the \r\nConference in 1974. The draft set out the elements \r\nof what would become the final solution, namely, a \r\nterritorial sea of 12 miles, an economic zone of 200 \r\nmiles and, beyond that, the high seas with all their \r\nfeatures. It included the basic characterization of the \r\nexclusive economic zone.\r\nIn the subsequent informal texts presented by \r\nthe presidents of the Commissions starting in 1975, \r\nwhich formed the basis of the future Convention, the \r\n200-mile exclusive economic zone was developed \r\nand fine-tuned until its final terms were established \r\nin the draft Convention that was adopted and signed \r\nin 1982. Years before the end of the Conference, and \r\nas a result of it, the exclusive economic zone of 200 \r\nmiles was considered to be part of the law of the sea \r\nand international custom — as the International Court \r\nof Justice itself acknowledged.\r\nThe United Nations Convention on the Law of \r\nthe Sea is alive and operational, as was reaffirmed \r\nby the Meeting of the Parties and now by the General \r\nAssembly. It legally governs the seas and the oceans and \r\nhas led to a broad and working system of law. This is \r\na welcome commemoration of its thirtieth anniversary, \r\nwhich must be extended to the unforgettable and ever \r\npresent third United Nations Conference on the Law of \r\nthe Sea.\r\nTribute is due to the almost 150 States that participated \r\nin negotiating the Convention, as well as to the United \r\nNations, within which it was negotiated. Tribute is also \r\ndue to the respective individuals — representatives and \r\nmembers of the Secretariat alike — who led the complex \r\nand ambitious negotiations, which lasted 14 years, to \r\na successful conclusion. In these few minutes, I can \r\nonly commend them by naming Conference Presidents \r\nHamilton Shirley Amerasinghe and Tommy Koh, who \r\nwe heard speak this morning, and Under-Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ambassador Bernardo Zuleta.\r\nChile is a maritime and fishing country and \r\na constant participant in the Conference and the \r\n12-63751 17\r\nA/67/PV.50\r\nConvention, as well as an active party and beneficiary \r\nof the new law, especially of the 200-mile exclusive \r\neconomic zone, which it was the first country in the \r\nworld to declare. It therefore participates and applauds \r\nthis just and important commemoration, as well as the \r\nsignificance and influence of the Convention on the \r\npresent and future reality of the seas and the oceans.\r\nMr. Nishida (Japan): At the outset, I would like \r\nto express my sincere congratulations on the thirtieth \r\nanniversary of the United Nations Convention on the \r\nLaw of the Sea (UNCLOS). Japan, as a State party to \r\nUNCLOS, takes pleasure in today’s commemorative \r\nmeeting, held on the 10 December, the very day when \r\nUNCLOS was opened for signature 30 years ago.\r\nJapan, as a maritime State surrounded by the \r\nsea, has held significant stakes in the various uses of \r\nthe ocean, including fishing, transportation and the \r\nutilization of marine resources. Japan firmly believed \r\nthat in order to achieve the full utilization of the rich \r\npotential of the sea over the long term, the establishment \r\nof a framework for the orderly shared use of the seas \r\nand oceans would serve the interests of Japan and those \r\nof the international community as a whole.\r\nWith regard to the third United Nations Conference \r\non the Law of the Sea, based on that conviction and \r\nbearing in mind the emerging needs of the era as well \r\nas the particular interests and needs of developing \r\ncountries, Japan worked hard with a view to establishing \r\na new, stable and fair legal order of the sea. Memorial \r\nessays by the Japanese fathers of UNCLOS contained in \r\nthe commemorative booklet published by the Division \r\nfor Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea show how \r\nactively Japan engaged at that Conference.\r\nThe level of interest in UNCLOS and the law of \r\nthe sea remains very high in Japan. In this thirtieth \r\ncommemorative year, a number of conferences \r\nand symposiums have been held by private-sector \r\norganizations and academic societies.\r\nIn the 30 years since the opening for signature of \r\nUNCLOS, and during the 18 years since its entry into \r\nforce, the international community has steadily made \r\nefforts to establish a legal order for the seas and oceans \r\nunder the Convention. In that regard, I would like to \r\nexpress my heartfelt praise to the three organs that \r\nwere established under the Convention, namely, the \r\nInternational Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS), \r\nthe International Seabed Authority and the Commission \r\non the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS).\r\nJapan has actively contributed to the work of those \r\norgans since their establishment — for example, by \r\nproviding resources for the judges of the Tribunal and \r\nmembers for the CLCS. Similarly, Japan recently made \r\ncontributions totalling approximately $350,000 to the \r\ntrust fund for the purpose of defraying the costs of \r\nparticipation in meetings of the CLCS by members from \r\ndeveloping States. We hope that Japan’s contributions \r\nwill facilitate efficient work by the Commission, which \r\nis required to deal with the numerous submissions \r\nmade by States.\r\nJapan has promoted the rule of law in the \r\ninternational society. At the High-level Meeting on the \r\nRule of Law at the National and International Levels, \r\nheld at Headquarters on 24 September, Mr. Koichiro \r\nGemba, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Japan, firmly \r\nreiterated the importance of international courts and \r\ntribunals as a means to settle international disputes \r\npeacefully in accordance with the law (see A/67/PV.5). \r\nIn order to facilitate the use of international courts \r\nand tribunals, Minister Gemba called upon all States \r\nthat had not yet done so to accept the compulsory \r\njurisdiction of the International Court of Justice and to \r\naccede to UNCLOS.\r\nIt goes without saying that, in order to enhance the \r\nrule of law in the oceans, it is of crucial importance that \r\nthe peaceful dispute settlement mechanism of UNCLOS \r\nbe effectively operated. With regard to ITLOS, which \r\nwas established under UNCLOS, we are pleased to see \r\nthat, with the issuance of an advisory opinion by its \r\nSeabed Dispute Chamber and the rendering a judgment \r\nin a dispute related to the delimitation of maritime \r\nzones, the Tribunal is steadily expanding its activities \r\nin various fields of law of the sea. Very recently, the \r\ntwentieth case was brought before the Tribunal, which \r\nreflects, in our view, the ever-growing trust of the \r\ninternational community in the Tribunal.\r\nToday we celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of \r\nUNCLOS, to which there are a total of 164 parties, \r\nincluding the European Union. For the past 30 years, \r\nUNCLOS has continuously faced new challenges arising \r\nfrom exigencies of the era. Having passed the test of \r\ntime for 30 years, UNCLOS has attained, both in name \r\nand in substance, its status as the “constitution for the \r\noceans”, serving as the very basis of the international \r\nlegal order for the oceans.\r\nJapan believes that, with a view to maintaining legal \r\nstability, it is crucially important for the international \r\n18 12-63751\r\nA/67/PV.50\r\nOn this important commemorative occasion, \r\nThailand wishes to note in particular those aspects \r\nof UNCLOS that we find to be groundbreaking. First \r\nof all, the Convention clearly defines the rights and \r\nduties of coastal and non-coastal States with specific \r\nscopes of jurisdiction by clearly dividing maritime \r\nzones into five categories: internal waters, territorial \r\nsea, exclusive economic zone, continental shelf and \r\nhigh seas. At the same time, it integrates well-balanced \r\nprovisions concerning the rights of developed States, \r\ndeveloping States, geographically disadvantaged States \r\nand landlocked States. It also provides an overarching \r\nframework for the conservation and protection of the \r\nmarine environment and natural resources. In addition, \r\nit enhances cooperation among States, regardless of \r\nwhether they are potentially capable of exploiting natural \r\nresources or not, by establishing the International \r\nSeabed Authority to oversee the management of those \r\nresources. Finally, UNCLOS should be recognized as \r\nan exceptional law of the sea convention for stipulating \r\nseveral optional and compulsory procedures in its \r\ndispute settlement regime.\r\nThailand wishes to continue to be an integral \r\npart of the development of UNCLOS, in step with \r\nthe International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, the \r\nCommission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf and \r\nthe International Seabed Authority. In that connection, \r\nlet me express Thailand’s sincere appreciation for the \r\nhigh quality of work of the International Tribunal, the \r\nCommission and the International Seabed Authority, as \r\nwell as their invaluable contributions to the development \r\nof the law of the sea.\r\nFinally, on this important thirtieth anniversary, \r\nwe would also like to encourage States that have yet \r\nto ratify UNCLOS to consider becoming parties to \r\nthe Convention. We hope and expect that UNCLOS \r\nwill become the first convention ratified by the largest \r\npossible number States. We believe that is well within \r\nthe realm of possibility, as the underlying principle of \r\nUNCLOS is that the seas and oceans should be reserved \r\nfor peaceful and sustainable use. We therefore hope to \r\nsee the seas and oceans connect and bind all members \r\nof the international community in good faith, cordiality, \r\ntrust and cooperation.\r\nMrs. Morgan (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): It is an \r\nhonour to participate in this meeting commemorating \r\nthe thirtieth anniversary of the opening for signature of \r\nthe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea \r\n(UNCLOS).\r\ncommunity to continue to address emerging issues \r\nregarding the law of the sea within the framework \r\nof UNCLOS. I would like to conclude my statement \r\nby reiterating Japan’s determination to continue to \r\ndevote its utmost efforts to continue to support the \r\nestablishment and maintenance of a stable and fair \r\ninternational legal order of the sea.\r\nMr. Sinhaseni (Thailand): Thailand joins in \r\ncommemorating this important anniversary of the \r\nopening for signature of the United Nations Convention \r\non the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) 30 years ago.\r\nAt the outset, Thailand associates itself with \r\nthe statement delivered by the representative of the \r\nRepublic of Korea at the 49th plenary meeting on behalf \r\nof the Group of Asian and Pacific States.\r\nMy delegation welcomes in particular the presence \r\nof Ambassador Tommy Koh of Singapore, President of \r\nthe third Conference. Let me also thank the Division \r\nfor Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea of the \r\nSecretariat for its initiative in convening this special \r\ncommemorative meting.\r\nUNCLOS is recognized as one of the most \r\nsophisticated and comprehensive Conventions. In \r\nestablishing the law of the sea framework, it successfully \r\nintegrates all aspects of the law of the sea, including \r\nmaritime zones, navigation, natural resources, the \r\nmarine environment and marine scientific research. \r\nThe Convention is rightly praised for its inclusiveness \r\nand comprehensiveness in all marine-related aspects \r\nand is aptly known as the “constitution for the oceans”. \r\nFor all of us, the conclusion of UNCLOS was indeed a \r\nmilestone for the law of the sea. The increasing number \r\nof State parties reflects its importance and relevancy \r\n30 years on.\r\nThailand is proud to be one of the countries that \r\nactively took part in the drafting process of the law \r\nof the sea conventions. His Royal Highness Prince \r\nNarathip Prabhanbongse was President of the first two \r\nUnited Nations Conferences on the Law of the Sea, \r\nheld in 1958 and 1960, respectively. Thailand was also \r\nvery active in contributing to the third United Nations \r\nConference on the Law of the Sea, held between 1973 \r\nand 1982, which led to the conclusion of UNCLOS. \r\nLast year, we became the one hundred and sixty-second \r\nState member of UNCLOS. We are happy to note that \r\nthat number now stands at 164.\r\n12-63751 19\r\nA/67/PV.50\r\nLikewise, the success of this legal instrument \r\nis reflected in Part XI of the Convention, whose \r\nimplementation through the 1994 Agreement wisely \r\nintegrates the current world situation with a vision of \r\nthe future to ensure that the concept of the common \r\nheritage of humankind will become a reality today. \r\nIn that context, we commend the determination of the \r\nInternational Seabed Authority to fulfil the goals of \r\nthose instruments.\r\nThe opening for signature of the “constitution on \r\nthe oceans” at the time represented the height of the \r\nspirit of cooperation needed to achieve unprecedented \r\nlegal progress. Participating countries were privileged \r\nwitnesses as obstacles to close and effective cooperation \r\namong nations were eliminated, thereby providing one \r\nof the most successful examples of global governance.\r\nHowever, the oceans regime continues to pose \r\nsignificant challenges in areas including the protection \r\nof the marine environmen, access to living resources, \r\nmaritime security, promoting capacity-building, \r\ncoordination and cooperation, and sustainable \r\ndevelopment, including as it pertains to marine \r\nbiodiversity beyond national jurisdictions.\r\nMexico is convinced that the Convention remains \r\nthe fundamental framework in efforts to confront \r\nthose challenges, with its unique, meaningful historic \r\nrole in ensuring that future generations will benefit \r\nfrom the oceans as a common heritage of humankind, \r\nas envisaged by Ambassador Arvid Pardo, and as an \r\nessential contribution in the maintenance of peace, \r\njustice and progress for all of the peoples of the world. \r\nMr. Heidar (Iceland): The United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea is, without doubt, \r\none of the greatest achievements in the history of the \r\nOrganization. The Convention, which is the first and \r\nonly comprehensive treaty in this field, provides the \r\nlegal framework for all uses of the oceans, as well as \r\ntheir superjacent air space and subjacent seabed and \r\nsubsoil. \r\nProbably no other treaty adopted after the \r\nestablishment of the United Nations has contributed so \r\nmuch to peace, security and the rule of law in the world. \r\nIt is difficult to imagine what the situation would be like \r\ntoday on the oceans and seas without the Convention.\r\nToday we pay tribute to the framers of the \r\nConvention from all States that participated in the \r\nthird United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. \r\nThe Convention is one of the most important \r\ninternational legal instruments of the Organization \r\nand serves as the basis upon which all activities on the \r\noceans and seas must be developed FOR the good of \r\nhumankind.\r\nAs one of the first signatories and the third \r\ncountry to ratify the Convention, Mexico welcomes the \r\nuniversal character of the Convention, which includes \r\ncountries in both hemispheres, island States, coastal \r\nStates and landlocked countries. At the same time, we \r\nreiterate our commitment to the principles and values \r\npromoted by the Convention and reaffirm the validity \r\nof the regime of the oceans, which has contributed to \r\nthe rule of law and to the creation of a space for peace, \r\ndevelopment and cooperation. \r\nAdvances made in dispute settlement and the \r\npeace and security of the oceans under the framework \r\nof the Convention are universally recognized. At \r\nthis commemorateive meeting, Mexico would like to \r\nhighligh the importance of the institutional framework \r\nestablished by the Convention and the work of other \r\nbodies that have contributed to its objectives. Those \r\ninclude the International Seabed Authority, the \r\nInternational Tribunal for the Law of the Sea and the \r\nCommission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, \r\nwhich have played a crucial role in guaranteeing the \r\nunity and coherence of the oceans regime.\r\nFor Mexico, it is highly gratifying to witness the \r\ngrowing judicial and advisory activity of the Tribunal \r\nas a dispute-settlement body under the Convention. \r\nFurthermore, the Commission is functioning \r\ndynamically and effectively, given the interest in \r\nestablishing the limits of the continental shelf beyond \r\n200 nautical miles.\r\nAlong with those institutions, we must also \r\nrecognize the roles of others that have been strategic \r\nfactors in the development of the legal regime on the \r\noceans, such as the International Court of Justice, \r\nin terms of the peaceful settlement of disputes; the \r\nInternational Maritime Organization, in the area of \r\nmaritime security and the protection of the marine \r\nenvironment; the Intergovernmental Oceanographic \r\nCommission, in the area of marine scientific research \r\nand the transfer of marine technology; and the Food \r\nand Agriculture Organization of the United Nations \r\nand regional fisheries organizations, in terms of \r\nthe conservation and development of living marine \r\nresources.\r\n20 12-63751\r\nA/67/PV.50\r\nThe Commission has already made 18 recommendations \r\nto coastal States. We welcome the decision of the \r\nCommission taken at its thirtieth session, in August, \r\nregarding the workload of the Commission, including \r\nextending the duration of its sessions here in New York \r\nnext year to 21 weeks in total, a well as taking measures \r\nto ensure that six subcommissions can actively consider \r\nsubmissions at any given time.\r\nAlthough the Commission is not a decision-making \r\nbody, its recommendations carry particular weight, as \r\nthey form the basis for the establishment of final and \r\nbinding outer limits of the continental shelf by a coastal \r\nState. \r\nIt should be highlighted that, according to article \r\n76, paragraph 8, of the Convention, the Commission \r\nshall make recommendations to coastal States on \r\n“matters related to the establishment of the outer limits \r\nof their continental shelf”. It is important to bear in \r\nmind that that includes not only recommendations \r\non the actual outer limits, but also the precursory \r\ntest of appurtenance, namely, examining whether the \r\ncontinental shelf reaches beyond 200 nautical miles or \r\nnot. That important function is the prerogative of the \r\nCommission.\r\nA crucial part of promoting the Law of the Sea \r\nConvention and preserving its integrity is through \r\neducation and capacity-building. \r\nI want to take this opportunity to draw attention to \r\nthe Rhodes Academy of Oceans Law and Policy, which \r\nannually offers a renowned three-week summer course \r\nin Rhodes, Greece. The basic objective of the Rhodes \r\nAcademy is to promote the rule of law in the world’s \r\noceans through education on the provisions of the Law \r\nof the Sea Convention and related instruments. The \r\nRhodes Academy is a cooperative undertaking by five \r\ninstitutions — the Centre for Oceans Law and Policy, \r\nCharlottesville, Virginia — and I am happy to recognize \r\nits Director, Mr. Jonathan Moore, who is here with us \r\ntoday; the Aegean Institute of the Law of the Sea and \r\nMaritime Law in Rhodes, the Law of the Sea Institute \r\nof Iceland in Reykjavik, the Max Planck Institute for \r\nComparative Public Law and International Law in \r\nHeidelberg and the Netherlands Institute for the Law \r\nof the Sea in Utrecht. The Centre for International Law \r\nin Singapore and the Korea Maritime Institute in Seoul \r\nare associate sponsors of the Rhodes Academy. The \r\nRhodes Academy has, in the past 18 years, graduated \r\nalmost 700 students from more than 130 countries. It is \r\nUnder the leadership of the late Hans G. Andersen, \r\nIceland played an important role in the evolution of the \r\nlaw of the sea in the second half of the past century. \r\nThat evolution took place both on the oceans and in the \r\nconferences, in particular at the third Conference. Ever \r\nsince that time, Iceland has been a strong proponent \r\nof the Law of the Sea Convention and was the first \r\nWestern country to ratify it, in 1985.\r\nAs we commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of \r\nthe Law of the Sea Convention, we can affirm that \r\nthe Convention has stood the test of time. We must, \r\nhowever, never take the Convention for granted and \r\nstay conscious of the need to preserve its integrity \r\nand implement its provisions to the fullest. Issues that \r\nwere settled at the third Conference should not be \r\nreopened. It must be borne in mind that the conclusions \r\nof the Conference were regarded as a package; while \r\nindividual States prevailed in some areas, in others they \r\nhad to give in.\r\nWe welcome the recent ratifications of the \r\nConvention by Ecuador and Swaziland, bringing \r\nthe total number of States parties to 164, and call \r\non those States that have not yet done so to ratify \r\nthe Convention in order to fully achieve the goal of \r\nuniversal participation. In that regard, I was happy to \r\nhear the statement made by the representative of the \r\nUnited States this morning.\r\nOn this joyous occasion, it is a source of particular \r\nsatisfaction that the three institutions established under \r\nthe Convention are all functioning well and are more \r\nactive in their work than ever before. The International \r\nSeabed Authority has concluded a growing number \r\nof contracts for the exploration for polymetallic \r\nnodules and sulphides, is attending to the drafting of \r\na mining code and is elaborating rules, regulations and \r\nprocedures to ensure the effective protection of the \r\nmarine environment in the Area.\r\nThere is also substantial growth in the judicial \r\nactivities of the International Tribunal for the Law of \r\nthe Sea, not only in terms of the number of cases but \r\nalso as regards the complexity and variety of matters \r\nbefore the Tribunal.\r\nThe Commission on the Limits of the Continental \r\nShelf has received 61 submissions from coastal States, \r\nincluding Iceland, regarding the establishment of the \r\nouter limits of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical \r\nmiles, as well as 45 preliminary information notes. \r\nFurther submissions are expected in the near future. \r\n12-63751 21\r\nA/67/PV.50\r\nof the United Nations, in particular its Committee on \r\nFisheries. Iceland attaches great importance to the \r\nAgreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and \r\nEliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing, \r\nwhich the first global treaty focused specifically on the \r\nproblem of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.\r\nIn the negotiations of the draft resolution on \r\noceans and the law of the sea, a considerable amount \r\nof time was devoted to discussing UN-Oceans, the \r\ninter-agency coordination mechanism on ocean and \r\ncoastal issues within the United Nations system, and \r\nthe Oceans Compact — Healthy Oceans for Prosperity, \r\nthe initiative of the Secretary-General. Member States \r\nconsidered the draft terms of reference for UN-Oceans \r\nand made preliminary comments focused on the need \r\nto strengthen the central role of DOALOS and to \r\nenhance transparency and reporting of the activities of \r\nUN-Oceans to Member States. As reflected in the draft \r\nresolution, UN-Oceans is requested to draft revised \r\ndraft terms of reference for its work for consideration \r\nand approval by the General Assembly at its next \r\nsession. As far as the Oceans Compact is concerned, the \r\nAssembly requests the Secretary-General to undertake \r\nopen and regular consultations with Member States on \r\nall aspects of that initiative.\r\nIceland has taken an active part in the meetings of \r\nthe Ad Hoc Open-ended Informal Working Group to \r\nstudy issues relating to the conservation and sustainable \r\nuse of marine biological diversity beyond areas of \r\nnational jurisdiction. The draft resolution provides for \r\nthe convening of two back-to-back workshops in May \r\nnext year, one on marine genetic resources and the \r\nother on conservation and management tools, including \r\nArea-based management and environmental impact \r\nassessments. The workshops serve to improve the \r\nunderstanding of those complex issues and to clarify \r\nkey questions as an input to the work of the Working \r\nGroup, which will hold its next meeting in August next \r\nyear.\r\nIceland welcomes the Outcome Document of the \r\nUnited Nations Conference on Sustainable Development \r\nentitled “The future we want” (resolution 66/288, \r\nannex), in which the international community stressed \r\nthe importance of the conservation and sustainable \r\nuse of the oceans and seas and of their resources \r\nfor sustainable development. States recognized the \r\nsignificant contribution of fisheries to the three \r\ndimensions of sustainable development and stressed the \r\ncrucial role of healthy marine ecosystems, sustainable \r\nperhaps the clearest sign of the success of the Academy \r\nto see how many Rhodes graduates represent their \r\ncountries regularly at meetings on ocean affairs and \r\nthe law of the sea here at the United Nations, including \r\ntoday.\r\nTurning now to the draft resolutions to be \r\nconsidered at this session on oceans and the law \r\nof the sea (A/67/L.21) and on sustainable fisheries \r\n(A/67/L.22), I want to thank my colleagues for the \r\nexcellent cooperation and good spirit during the \r\nnegotiations of both draft resolutions. I note with \r\nparticular satisfaction the convergence of views that \r\ncharacterized this year’s negotiations. I would like to \r\nexpress my thanks to the two coordinators, Ambassador \r\nEden Charles of Trinidad and Tobago and Ms. Alice \r\nRevell of New Zealand, each of whom conducted the \r\ninformal consultations on the draft resolutions for the \r\nfirst time. They each did so in his or her own way, but \r\nboth successfully. Furthermore, I would like to express \r\nmy appreciation for the high standard of assistance \r\nprovided to Member States by the Division for Ocean \r\nAffairs and the Law of the Sea (DOALOS) through the \r\npreparation of reports and other activities. The Director \r\nof the Division, Mr. Sergey Tarasenko, who will retire \r\nearly next year, deserves special tribute.\r\nBeing so overwhelmingly dependent upon the \r\noceans, Iceland attaches great importance to the long-\r\nterm conservation, management and sustainable use of \r\nliving marine resources and to the obligation of States to \r\ncooperate to that end in accordance with international \r\nlaw, in particular the Law of the Sea Convention and the \r\nUnited Nations Fish Stocks Agreement. We welcome \r\nthe reaffirmation of those goals in the draft resolution \r\non sustainable fisheries.\r\nThe United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement is \r\nof paramount importance, as it provides the legal \r\nframework for the conservation and management of \r\nstraddling and highly migratory fish stocks by regional \r\nfisheries management organizations. The effectiveness \r\nof the Agreement depends upon its wide ratification \r\nand implementation, in particular by fishing States. \r\nWe therefore welcome the recent ratifications of the \r\nAgreement by Morocco and Bangladesh, which bring \r\nthe total number of States parties to 80, and call on those \r\nStates that have not yet done so to ratify the Agreement \r\nin order to achieve the goal of universal participation.\r\nI would like to express my country’s appreciation for \r\nthe work done by the Food and Agriculture Organization \r\n22 12-63751\r\nA/67/PV.50\r\nMr. Ceriani (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): Today, \r\nas we celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of the opening \r\nfor signature of the United Nations Convention on \r\nthe Law of the Sea, we wish to confer well-deserved \r\nrecognition to that very important international treaty, \r\ngiven its impact, importance and significance in the \r\ninternational sphere, and particularly in encouraging \r\nthe progressive development of international law \r\nin accordance with the provisions of Article 13, \r\nsubparagraph 1 (a) of the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nFrom the juridical point of view, we can say that \r\nthe Convention is a true “constitution for the sea”, with \r\nthe goal of regulating the largest physical area on the \r\nplanet, and we emphasize the universal and unique \r\ncharacter that has shaped it into a legal framework \r\nwithin which every activity in and on the oceans and \r\nthe seas must be carried out. To accomplish that task, \r\nthe Convention distinguishes between different areas, \r\naccording to the volume and surface of water in their \r\nmakeup, as well as in the seabed and subsoil, giving each \r\na specific and unique legal system, established through \r\nthree bodies: two of a technical nature dealing with the \r\nseabed and ocean f loor, the Commission on the Limits \r\nof the Continental Shelf and the International Seabed \r\nAuthority, and one jurisdictional, the International \r\nTribunal of the Law of the Sea.\r\nWe should note that the Convention also established \r\ninnovative legal concepts, such as the consideration of \r\nthe seabed and the ocean f loor as the common heritage \r\nof humankind. The legal framework provided by the \r\nConvention, to be interpreted alongside the Charter \r\nof the United Nations, is a continually evolving \r\nnormative system reflected in the actions of the \r\nentities it encompasses: the International Tribunal of \r\nthe Law of the Sea, which hands down judgments and \r\nadvisory opinions; the International Seabed Authority, \r\nwhich regulates and authorizes; and the Commission \r\non the Limits of the Continental Shelf, which makes \r\nrecommendations.\r\nThrough those actions, the regulations and \r\nprocedures designed to improve the law of the sea \r\nare being built and strengthened. Today we can say \r\nwith certainty that in the course of these 30 years, the \r\nConvention has proved adequate to the pursuit of its \r\ngoal, which itself is the fundamental goal of the Charter \r\nof the United Nations, the consolidation of peace \r\namong nations. For that reason, we should congratulate \r\nthose who instigated and achieved the adoption of the \r\nConvention in the period leading up to its opening for \r\nfisheries and sustainable aquaculture for food security \r\nand nutrition and in providing for the livelihoods of \r\nmillions of people. The outcome relevant to oceans and \r\nseas is properly reflected in the two draft resolutions.\r\nIn “The future we want”, States noted with concern \r\nthat the health of oceans and marine biodiversity was \r\nnegatively affected by marine pollution, including \r\nmarine debris, from a number of marine and land-\r\nbased sources. They also committed to taking action \r\nto reduce the incidence and impacts of such pollution \r\non marine ecosystems, including through the effective \r\nimplementation of the relevant conventions adopted \r\nin the framework of the International Maritime \r\nOrganization and the follow-up of the relevant \r\ninitiatives such as the Global Programme of Action for \r\nthe Protection of the Marine Environment from Land-\r\nbased Activities.\r\nIn Rio, States also agreed to call for support for \r\ninitiatives that address ocean acidification and the \r\nimpacts of climate change on marine and coastal \r\necosystems and resources and, in that regard, reiterated \r\nthe need to work collectively to prevent further ocean \r\nacidification and to support marine scientific research, \r\nmonitoring and observation of ocean acidification and \r\nparticularly vulnerable ecosystems. In that context, \r\nIceland welcomes the choice of topic for the fourteenth \r\nmeeting of the United Nations Open-ended Informal \r\nConsultative Process on Oceans and the Law of the \r\nSea, to be held in June next year, which will focus its \r\ndiscussions on the impacts of ocean acidification on the \r\nmarine environment.\r\nFinally, the famous British writer Arthur C. Clarke \r\nonce commented: “How inappropriate to call this \r\nplanet Earth, when it is quite clearly Ocean.” Oceans \r\nare constantly growing in importance in the work of the \r\nUnited Nations, along with an increased awareness that \r\noceans, seas and coastal areas form an integrated and \r\nessential component of the Earth’s ecosystem and are \r\ncritical to sustaining it.\r\nThere are many challenges ahead in the field of \r\nocean affairs and the law of the sea; I have touched \r\nupon just a few of them here. It is my sincere hope that \r\nwe will be able to deal with those issues in the same \r\nspirit of cooperation and consensus that characterized \r\nthe negotiations of the draft resolutions this year. \r\nWe would then be following in the footsteps of our \r\nforefathers who 30 years ago adopted the “constitution \r\nof the oceans”, the United Nations Convention on the \r\nLaw of the Sea.\r\n12-63751 23\r\nA/67/PV.50\r\nThe universal character of the Convention on the \r\nLaw of the Sea is evidenced not only in its universal \r\nlanguage and purpose and in its commitment to settle \r\nall law-of-the-sea issues on the basis that they are \r\ninterrelated and should be considered as a whole, \r\nbut also and primarily in its unprecedented, almost \r\nuniversal, participation. To date, 164 States parties, \r\nincluding the European Union, are bound by its \r\nprovisions. In addition, international jurisprudence has \r\nlong accepted that most of its provisions either embody \r\nor reflect customary international law.\r\nThe view has occasionally been expressed that the \r\nConvention is not capable of dealing with new challenges \r\nsuch as piracy, illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs or \r\nhuman beings, the protection of marine biodiversity in \r\nareas beyond national jurisdiction or genetic resources. \r\nWe do not share that view, nor do we agree with those \r\nwho say that there are gaps in the Convention. There \r\nmay be inadequacies and shortcomings or an absence \r\nof specific regulation, which is inevitable when we \r\nare dealing with new uses that did not exist at the time \r\nthat the Convention was adopted; but there are no legal \r\ngaps. The Convention on the Law of the Sea deals with \r\neach jurisdictional zone separately, and in addition \r\nto its specific provisions, it has residual regimes. For \r\nexample, in the area of internal waters, the territorial \r\nsea and archipelagic waters, the residual regime is that \r\nof territorial sovereignty; in the area of the high seas, \r\nthe freedom of the seas and the exclusive economic \r\nzone, the residual rule is that of article 59. In other \r\nwords, activities that are not specifically regulated by \r\nthe Convention are not carried out in a legal vacuum; \r\non the contrary, they are governed by general principles \r\nor residual rules.\r\nIt would be unrealistic to expect a framework \r\nconvention such as the Convention on the Law of the \r\nSea to incorporate all the detailed provisions that \r\nmay be required for regulating a specific activity. It \r\nshould be recalled, however, that with respect to the \r\nprotection of the marine environment, the Convention \r\nincorporates by reference the international rules and \r\nstandards established through whatever may be the \r\ncompetent international organization or diplomatic \r\nconference.\r\nIn some cases, general principles may be \r\ninadequate to deal with new realities, therefore new \r\nrules must be developed. Indeed, the adoption of the \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea has not stopped, \r\nand could not stop, the development of international \r\nsignature on 10 December 1982. Among that group of \r\nmen and women from all over the world, Uruguay would \r\nlike to recall two of its citizens who played a prominent \r\npart in the long and arduous process demanded by \r\nthe adoption of the Convention — Mr. Julio Cesar \r\nLupinacci and Mr. Felipe Paolillo — and, along with \r\nthem, all the participants in this major effort. \r\nDuring this session of the General Assembly, in \r\nwhich we held the High-level Meeting on the Rule \r\nof Law at the National and International Levels, may \r\ntoday’s commemorative event serve to remind us of the \r\nirreplaceable value of our international legislature as \r\na key actor in the process of establishing legal norms \r\nand peacefully settling disputes among the nations of \r\nthe world.\r\nMr. Caramitsos Tziras (Greece): Today we \r\ncommemorate the thirtieth anniversary of the opening \r\nfor signature, in 1982, of the United Nations Convention \r\non the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which has been \r\ndescribed by the President of the third United Nations \r\nConference on the Law of the Sea as a monumental \r\nachievement of the international community, second \r\nonly to the Charter of the United Nations and a \r\n“constitution for the oceans” that would stand the test \r\nof time. Truer words were never spoken. The drafters \r\nof the Convention, to whom we pay tribute today, not \r\nonly succeeded in adopting a comprehensive treaty \r\ndealing with almost every aspect of the oceans, they \r\nalso created a treaty capable of adapting to new realities \r\nand challenges, whether involving new uses of the seas \r\nor traditional ones that have acquired new importance \r\nor are the result of new conditions, new technological \r\ndevelopments and even new needs.\r\nBy establishing the legal framework within which \r\nall activities in the oceans and seas must be carried \r\nout, the Convention promotes the stability of the law \r\nas well as the maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity. Among other things, it has replaced a plethora \r\nof conflicting claims by coastal States with universally \r\nagreed limits on the territorial sea, the contiguous \r\nzone, the exclusive economic zone and the continental \r\nshelf; it has unequivocally accepted that islands enjoy \r\nthe same status, and therefore the same maritime rights, \r\nas other lands; it has encouraged the development of \r\nimportant new rules for protecting and preserving the \r\nmarine environment from pollution; and strengthened \r\nthe international community’s interest in freedom of \r\nnavigation; the peaceful settlement of disputes and the \r\nprevention of the use of force.\r\n24 12-63751\r\nA/67/PV.50\r\npeaceful use of the sea. The Government of Sweden \r\nunderlined that UNCLOS established a delicate balance \r\nbetween the rights and obligations of States — on the \r\none hand, the interest of the coastal State in controlling \r\nactivities in areas off its coast and, on the other hand, \r\nthe right of all States to enjoy and to use the high seas \r\nwithout unnecessary limitations.\r\nSince the adoption of UNCLOS, Sweden has \r\nbeen a strong supporter of the Convention and the \r\nbodies established by it, namely, the Commission on \r\nthe Limits of the Continental Shelf, the International \r\nSeabed Authority and the International Tribunal for the \r\nLaw of the Sea.\r\nAs one of the most extensive and comprehensive \r\ninstruments adopted by the United Nations to date, \r\nUNCLOS covers a wide range of issues related to the \r\npeaceful use of the sea. It has proved to be a reliable \r\ntool as the legal framework applicable for areas of great \r\nimportance, such as the Arctic Ocean and the Pacific \r\nregion. \r\nWith few exceptions, the Convention reflects \r\nexisting customary law. However, it is important not \r\nto underestimate the value and power of a binding \r\ninternational convention. The risk of creeping \r\njurisdiction is more easily avoided if States are bound by \r\na convention that clearly defines rights and obligations. \r\nAlso, it is beneficial to international peace and security \r\nwhen a large number of States of the world are bound by \r\nidentical international rules. Sweden therefore actively \r\nencourages States to accede to UNCLOS and welcomes \r\nall States that have done so. More than once, UNCLOS \r\nhas proved to be a powerful instrument in avoiding and \r\nsettling disputes. Sweden would like to underline the \r\nimportance of the peaceful settlement of international \r\nmaritime disputes in accordance with the principles \r\nenshrined in UNCLOS.\r\nThe protection of the marine environment is a \r\nmatter that is close to Sweden’s heart. In that respect, \r\nUNCLOS is a powerful and comprehensive instrument \r\nthat creates a binding treaty obligation to protect and \r\npreserve the marine environment and to cooperate in \r\nthat regard.\r\nLet me take a moment to look towards the future \r\nand the challenges that may lie ahead in the years to \r\ncome. With the scientific and technical developments \r\nthat are under way, we will be able to access and to \r\nexploit the resources of the oceans to a much larger \r\nextent than the negotiators of the Convention could \r\nlaw; on the contrary, the Convention addresses its \r\nrelationship with other international agreements, both \r\nexisting and potentially in the future. Therefore, if new \r\nrules have to be developed, they may take the form of \r\nan implementing Agreement, such as that relating to \r\nthe implementation of Part XI of the Convention, the \r\n1995 United Nations Straddling Fish Stocks Agreement \r\nor the proposed adoption, currently being considered, \r\nof a new UNCLOS implementing agreement on the \r\nconservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity \r\nin areas beyond national jurisdiction.\r\nGreece has always been a keen supporter of the \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea, which constitutes \r\nan important pillar of its foreign policy and a reference \r\npoint in its bilateral relations on marine issues. Along \r\nwith our European Union partners, we firmly believe \r\nthat the United Nations Conference on the Law of the \r\nSea is a factor for stability, peace and progress and that \r\nit has special importance in a difficult international \r\ncontext. It is therefore important to preserve the \r\nConvention’s integrity and its pre-eminent role as the \r\nlegal framework for all ocean issues and ocean-related \r\nactivities by calling upon all States that have not done \r\nso to become parties to the Convention in order to \r\nachieve the goal of universal participation.\r\nTurning now to the two draft resolutions on oceans \r\nand the law of the sea (A/67/L.21) and sustainable \r\nfisheries (A/67/L.22) that will be considered at this \r\nsession, we would like to express our appreciation to \r\nthe coordinators for their tireless efforts during the \r\nnegotiations to reach consensus, and to all delegations \r\nfor their cooperative spirit. We also wish to express our \r\ngratitude to the Secretariat Division for Ocean Affairs \r\nand the Law of the Sea for the work done during the \r\nyear, including the preparation of the annual report on \r\noceans and the law of the sea (A/67/79).\r\nThis year’s omnibus draft resolution has particular \r\nsignificance in that it marks the thirtieth anniversary \r\nof the opening for signature of the Convention. The \r\nrenewed commitment of all States to respecting the \r\npublic order of the oceans and the rule of law is therefore \r\nmore appropriate and relevant than ever.\r\nMs. Burgstaller (Sweden): On 10 December 1982, \r\nSweden was among the 158 States to sign the United \r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). \r\nSweden ratified the Convention on 25 June 1996. In its \r\nbill to Parliament, the Government of Sweden described \r\nUNCLOS as a nearly complete set of rules for the \r\n12-63751 25\r\nA/67/PV.50\r\nmanaged to set aside their differences. They assembled \r\nand created law and order with regard to the use of the \r\noceans, their resources and the marine environment.\r\nIndonesia is proud to have been a part of the \r\ntreaty-making process from 1958 to 1982, in which \r\ntwo of my predecessors, Ambassador Hasjim Djalal, \r\nformer Minister for Foreign Affairs, and Mr. Mochtar \r\nKusumaatmadja played instrumental roles establishing \r\nthe Convention. We are forever indebted to them for the \r\npart that they played.\r\nThe world has changed since 1982. New challenges \r\nhave emerged, while some long-standing problems still \r\nneed to be addressed. However, even after 30 years, the \r\nConvention is still relevant today. Maritime boundaries \r\nwere a sensitive issue that needed to be addressed \r\nbetween countries. We are content that the process \r\nis being undertaken peacefully through the legal \r\ncorridors provided in the Convention, which include \r\nbilateral negotiations, international judicial judgements \r\nand utilization of the three main institutions of the \r\nConvention.\r\nThe Convention also provides general rules for \r\naddressing marine environmental degradation, which \r\nhas indeed become a new problem of the oceans. As \r\nthe main source of regulation for the oceans, numerous \r\nenvironmental conventions, such as the Convention on \r\nBiological Diversity and the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change, have based their rules \r\non the marine environment on the 320 articles of the \r\n1982 Convention and its nine annexes. However, the \r\ngeneral rules need to be complemented by further \r\nstrengthening cooperation at the regional and global \r\nlevels. Indonesia believes that the first step in that \r\nregard is to comprehensively implement the Convention, \r\nincluding its ratification by countries that have yet to \r\ndo so.\r\nThis year, the Secretary-General introduced the \r\nOceans Compact. It is, as he puts it, an initiative to \r\nstrengthen United Nations system-wide coherence \r\nto deliver on its oceans-related mandates. Indonesia \r\nwelcomes this initiative. We are ready to support the \r\nUnited Nations efforts to summon collaboration and \r\naccelerate progress in the achievement of the common \r\ngoal of healthy oceans for prosperity. The messages \r\nconveyed by the Secretary-General’s initiative are of \r\nparticular importance for Indonesia, but important for \r\nother nations as well. Oceans are able to absorb excess \r\nheat, and thus contribute to the moderation of global \r\nhave envisaged. The technical possibility of exploiting \r\nthe mineral resources in the Area must be accompanied \r\nby careful environmental and biological considerations. \r\nAlso, developments in the modern fishing industry \r\nhave made it possible to fish further from the coast and \r\nto facilitate larger catches. Fish are an important source \r\nof income for many States, and the sustainability of \r\nfish stocks worldwide represents a key source of food \r\nin many parts of the world. Sweden therefore attaches \r\ngreat importance in the ongoing process relating to the \r\nconservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity \r\nbeyond areas of national jurisdiction and urges all States \r\nto contribute constructively to that joint undertaking, \r\nwhich is our common responsibility.\r\nLet me conclude by wishing UNCLOS a happy \r\nthirtieth anniversary. \r\nMr. Khan (Indonesia): I thank the President for \r\nconvening today’s meeting on the commemoration of \r\nthe thirtieth anniversary of the opening for signature \r\nof the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of \r\nthe Sea. \r\nBefore I proceed, my delegation wishes to fully \r\nassociate itself with the statement delivered earlier \r\ntoday by the representative of the Republic of Korea on \r\nbehalf of the Asia-Pacific Group.\r\nThe 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law \r\nof the Sea is a landmark document that provides a \r\nuniversal legal framework for the world’s oceans and \r\nseas, including the sustainable development of its \r\nresources. It is indeed the “constitution of the oceans”. \r\nMy delegation is therefore pleased to see that the \r\nnumber of States party to the Convention is increasing \r\nsignificantly.\r\nBefore the adoption of the Convention, the world \r\nfaced many problems and conflicts relating to the use of \r\nthe seas and oceans, either with regard to the maritime \r\nspace or their resources. There were difficulties \r\nwhen many States unilaterally claimed extensive \r\nmaritime zones and countries declared themselves to \r\nbe archipelagic States without considering their land-\r\nto-water ratio. Such claims were generally opposed by \r\nother countries that continued to rely on the principle \r\nof the freedom of the sea, either with regard to their \r\nresources or the use of their maritime space.\r\nNonetheless, our great predecessors were able to \r\nturn those difficulties into an opportunity. Realizing \r\nthe lack of international rules on the oceans, they \r\n26 12-63751\r\nA/67/PV.50\r\nand societies affected by autism spectrum disorders \r\nand other developmental disorders”, on Wednesday, \r\n12 December 2012, originally scheduled as a joint \r\ndebate, will now be conducted separately in the \r\nnumerical order of the items.\r\nConsideration of agenda item 118, “Strengthening \r\nof the United Nations system”, and its sub-item (a) will \r\nnow be held on Monday, 17 December, as the first item.\r\nConsideration of agenda item 32, “The role of \r\ndiamonds in fuelling conflict”, originally scheduled for \r\nMonday, 17 December, will now be held on Tuesday, \r\n18 December, after the consideration of the reports of \r\nthe Special Political and Decolonization Committee \r\n(Fourth Committee).\r\nConsideration of agenda item 39, “The situation \r\nin the occupied territories of Azerbaijan”, originally \r\nscheduled for Monday, 17 December, has been \r\npostponed to a later date, to be announced.\r\nBefore concluding, I would like to announce that \r\nthis is the last meeting of the General Assembly for \r\nMs. Meriem Heddache, Meeting Services Assistant \r\nin the General Assembly Affairs Branch of the \r\nDepartment of General Assembly and Conference \r\nManagement. Ms. Heddache has worked at the United \r\nNations for more than 30 years. In the past few years, \r\nshe has been responsible for the list of speakers in the \r\nplenary of the General Assembly. Her ability to manage \r\nthat demanding task and her contribution to the smooth \r\nconduct of the meetings of the Assembly has been \r\ntruly significant. I would like to ask the Assembly \r\ngive her a round of applause in appreciation. We wish \r\nMs. Heddache all the best. \r\nThe meeting rose at 6.05 p.m.\r\nwarming. Oceans are also the source of more than half \r\nthe oxygen we breathe, and among the most promising \r\nanswers for our food security strategy.\r\nAlong those lines alone, Indonesia feels \r\ncompelled to push forward the idea of the sustainable \r\ndevelopment of the oceans. For the sake of our future \r\ngenerations, a balance between the economic, social \r\nand environmental aspects of the oceans must become \r\nour immediate agenda. While the strategies that are \r\nset out in the Compact are familiar in tone, we need to \r\nestablish the Convention as the hig hest source of rules, \r\nand thus conduct our actions based on the Convention \r\nitself, including respect for State sovereignty.\r\nLooking to the future, it is important for countries to \r\naccelerate the proper implementation of the Convention \r\nin their respective national legislations. Countries \r\nalso need to refrain from using force to resolve their \r\nmaritime boundary disputes, and focus instead on \r\nnegotiations based on the set of rules provided in the \r\nConvention. We believe that oceans and the law of \r\nthe sea will continue to be an important issue to be \r\ndiscussed in the United Nations. The Assembly can rest \r\nassured of the support and active role of the delegation \r\nof Indonesia.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe Acting President: I should like to remind \r\nmembers that, as announced in the Journal, the \r\nfollowing changes to the programme of work have been \r\nmade. \r\nConsideration of agenda items 123, “Global \r\nhealth and foreign policy”, and 127, “Addressing \r\nthe socioeconomic needs of individuals, families \r\n"
