Marine pollution is still a major \r\nconcern. The high number of offshore drilling incidents \r\nand leakages indicates that the marine environment is \r\nhighly vulnerable to pollution resulting from accidents \r\nlinked to activities at sea.\r\nEgypt emphasizes the need to further enhance \r\nefforts and programmes seeking to tackle the threats \r\ncaused by higher sea temperatures, sea-level rise \r\ncaused by climate change and ocean acidification \r\nto marine life, coastal and island communities and \r\nnational economies. At the core of those efforts lies \r\nthe need to build the capacity of States to implement \r\nrelevant international instruments, particularly through \r\nchannelling additional funding to support efforts to \r\nmitigate and adapt to the adverse effects of climate \r\nchange.\r\nWe further emphasize the importance of work at \r\nthe international level to strengthen and develop the \r\nfield of marine scientific research, particularly in the \r\ncontext of the International Seabed Authority, and the \r\nstudy of the effects of mining activities on the marine \r\nenvironment at sea bottom. \r\nAdditional progress is needed in resolving disputes \r\nconcerning maritime boundary delimitation, in \r\nparticular those with a potential to become sources of \r\ntension and conflict. The United Nations Convention \r\non the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) provides a sound \r\nUnited Nations A/67/PV.52\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-seventh session\r\n52nd plenary meeting\r\nTuesday, 11 December 2012, 3 p.m.\r\nNew York\r\nOffi cial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Jeremić  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Serbia)\r\n2 12-64324\r\nA/67/PV.52\r\nbasis for such situations, and Member States should \r\navail themselves to the fullest extent possible of the \r\ninternational judicial bodies such as the International \r\nTribunal for the Law of the Sea and the International \r\nCourt of Justice.\r\nTurning to maritime security, Egypt notes with great \r\nrelief the reduction in reported incidents of piracy and \r\narmed robbery against ships off the coasts of Somalia \r\nduring the first six months of 2012, in comparison \r\nwith past years. The reduction in such attacks could \r\nbe partially attributed to a number of factors, such as \r\nthe application of best management practices by the \r\nshipping industry and a continuing naval presence. \r\nHowever, such international efforts have so far dealt \r\nwith only one part of the problem, as the focus is on \r\ncombating acts of piracy at sea instead of directing \r\ngreater attention to the fundamental underlying causes \r\non the mainland. Egypt has warned against a partial \r\napproach and has always emphasized, particularly \r\nthrough its participation in the Contact Group on \r\nPiracy off the Coast of Somalia and its chairmanship \r\nof the Working Group on Electronic Commerce, the \r\nimportance of adopting a comprehensive approach \r\nthat takes into account the root causes of the problem \r\nand addresses its political, security, economic and \r\nhumanitarian dimensions in Somalia.\r\nMoreover, we also express our continued concern \r\nabout the incidents of piracy and armed robbery against \r\nships in the Gulf of Guinea, off West Africa, and the \r\nadverse effects that such incidents have on African \r\nmaritime trade. We call on the international community \r\nto give due attention to that issue. \r\nAs for sustainable fisheries, Egypt emphasizes \r\nthe need for more efforts to protect endangered fish \r\nspecies, fight illegal, unreported and unregulated \r\nfishing, and refrain from destructive fishing practices \r\non the seabed.\r\nEgypt reaffirms that the States parties to the 1995 \r\nFisheries Agreement should review its provisions to \r\ntake into consideration the reservations by non-parties, \r\nespecially developing countries, including those \r\nprovisions relating to boarding and searching fishing \r\nvessels. That would enable the latter group of countries \r\nto become parties and to enhance cooperation in order \r\nto protect sustainable fisheries and to work for their \r\ndevelopment.\r\nAs this year marks the thirtieth anniversary of the \r\nopening for signature of UNCLOS, Egypt reiterates \r\nits conviction as to the overarching significance of \r\nthe Convention in the strengthening of international \r\npeace and security, international cooperation and the \r\nsustainable development of the oceans and seas.\r\nMr. De Vega (Philippines): The Philippines \r\nwelcomes and is greatly encouraged by the importance \r\nthat the General Assembly continues to give to the \r\nissue of oceans and the law of the sea. This meeting, \r\nheld immediately following our commemoration of the \r\nthirtieth anniversary of the opening for signature of \r\nthe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, \r\nhighlights the importance of the Convention. \r\nWe note with appreciation the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on oceans and the law of the sea, contained in \r\ndocuments A/67/79, A/67/79/Corr.1, A/67/79Add.1 and \r\nAdd.2, as well as the report on the work of the Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group of the Whole, contained in document \r\nA/67/87. Those documents present the various efforts \r\nand the latest developments relating to oceans and the \r\nlaw of the sea in a comprehensive and detailed manner.\r\nThis session’s draft resolution on oceans and the law \r\nof the sea (A/67/L.21), which we will consider today, is \r\na testament to the continued interest and value placed \r\nby Member States in the sustainable use of oceans and \r\ntheir resources, anchored on the rule of law.\r\nThe United Nations Convention on the Law of the \r\nSea is heralded as the constitution of the oceans, in that \r\nit establishes the legal framework governing all aspects \r\nof ocean use and development. It establishes a legal order \r\nthat guarantees and safeguards not only the exercise of \r\nthose rights but, just as important, compliance with \r\nobligations. In a world of competing interests and of \r\nnations with varying degrees of political, economic \r\nor military stature, that legal framework is not just \r\nimportant but absolutely necessary. It gives nations an \r\nequal voice and provides nations an equal legal footing.\r\nAs an archipelago and a maritime nation that \r\nrelies on the oceans for its continued development, \r\nthe Philippines attaches the utmost importance to \r\na just, orderly and meaningful legal regime for our \r\nseas and oceans. We note the continuing development \r\nof international law as it relates to ocean use and \r\njurisdiction, through the decisions of the International \r\nTribunal on the Law of the Sea. We await with keen \r\ninterest the decisions of the Commission on the Limits \r\nof the Continental Shelf and the International Seabed \r\nAuthority. We note the recent relevant decisions of \r\nthe International Court of Justice. We likewise look \r\n12-64324 3\r\nA/67/PV.52\r\nforward to next year’s Meeting of States Parties to the \r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, as it \r\nholds promise for a meaningful discussion on law of the \r\nsea issues involving States parties and observers alike.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report highlights the \r\nincreasing cooperative activities, cross-cutting in all \r\nregions and sectors from marine scientific research and \r\nmarine environmental protection to search-and-rescue \r\nat sea and combating piracy and other maritime crimes. \r\nThat is clear evidence that States parties are conscious \r\nof the governing principle expressed in the Convention \r\nthat the problems of ocean space are closely interrelated \r\nand need to be considered as a whole.\r\nDespite all efforts at cooperation, however, \r\nproblems still exist in many areas. Marine pollution \r\nand destructive fishing methods continue to threaten \r\nthe fragile ocean environment. Piracy remains a threat \r\nto the safety of navigation, and other maritime crimes \r\ncontinue to threaten our security. All nations are \r\ncontinually challenged by the oceans and even by the \r\napplication and development of international norms and \r\nconventions governing its uses and the management of \r\nits resources and environment.\r\nThe Philippines welcomes the fact that in this year’s \r\nomnibus draft resolution on oceans and the law of the \r\nsea (A/67/L.21), attention is once again drawn to the \r\nimpact of piracy on the safety and welfare of seafarers. \r\nIndeed, piracy is a menace to the world. It disrupts \r\nglobal trade and poses genuine security threats. It has a \r\ndirect impact on the lives of seafarers and their families. \r\nThe Philippines, with an estimated 350,000 sailors, \r\naccounts for nearly a quarter of the world’s seafarers. \r\nWe know full well how each incident of piracy cuts \r\nthrough the lives of every seafarer and his family. We \r\nwelcome the attention given to capacity-building with \r\nregard to the safety and security of seafarers.\r\nThe Philippines also welcomes the developments \r\non the marine environment and marine resources \r\nreflected in Section X of the draft resolution. It also \r\ngives attention to the outcomes of the United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development in “The future \r\nwe want” (resolution 66/288, annex), particularly to \r\nthe concern that the health of the oceans and marine \r\nbiodiversity are negatively affected by marine pollution \r\nfrom a number of marine and land-based resources. \r\nInternational marine scientists have widely regarded \r\nthe Philippines’ waters as a centre of global marine \r\nbiodiversity. It is in everyone’s interests that such \r\ndiversity be protected from those who ignore their \r\nresponsibilities, to the detriment of our generation and \r\nposterity.\r\nAs the Secretary-General points out in his report \r\n(A/67/79), the importance of marine biodiversity, \r\nincluding in areas beyond national jurisdiction, for \r\nglobal food security and for healthy, functioning marine \r\necosystems, economic prosperity and sustainable \r\nlivelihoods cannot be overstated. We welcome the first \r\nmeeting of the Ad Hoc Open-ended Informal Working \r\nGroup, convened in May in accordance with paragraph \r\n168 of resolution 66/231, with a view to ensuring that the \r\nlegal framework for the conservation and sustainable \r\nuse of marine biodiversity in areas beyond national \r\njurisdiction effectively addresses these issues.\r\nThe Philippines notes that certain advances have \r\nbeen made on key issues and concerns in today’s \r\ndraft resolution, and wishes to highlight the continued \r\nimportance of its Section V, on the peaceful settlement \r\nof disputes. UNCLOS has never been more important \r\nthan today for developing countries such as our own, \r\nwhen overlapping maritime claims in our part of the \r\nworld threaten us as never before. It provides a proper \r\nand proven mechanism for peacefully resolving such \r\nclaims so as to ensure global and regional peace and \r\ncooperation and stability in the just and sustainable \r\nuse of marine natural resources. We believe that the \r\nrules-based approach in UNCLOS is the way forward \r\nin addressing maritime disputes, including in our own \r\nregion.\r\nThe theme of our session this year is the adjustment \r\nor settlement of international disputes by peaceful \r\nmeans. This year we also commemorate the thirtieth \r\nanniversary of the Manila Declaration on the Peaceful \r\nSettlement of International Disputes. Against this \r\nbackdrop, we are afforded a singular opportunity to \r\nrenew our pledge and demonstrate our commitment to \r\nabide by our obligations as responsible members of the \r\ninternational community. It is on that demonstration of \r\ncommitment to the rule of law that the success of the \r\nConvention rests. On that demonstration of commitment \r\nto the rule of law rests the success of all our efforts to \r\nsecure for ourselves and posterity the benefits derived \r\nfrom the responsible use of our world’s oceans.\r\nBefore concluding, I would like to express our \r\nappreciation for the statement made in the 51st meeting \r\nby the Permanent Representative of Palau on behalf of \r\nthe Pacific Islands Forum, which mentioned the effects \r\nof climate change and related issues, such as sea-level \r\nrise. We saw such effects in Typhoon Bopha, which \r\n4 12-64324\r\nA/67/PV.52\r\nstruck my country recently, causing great loss of life \r\nand property. Indeed, ocean experts and experts on the \r\nlaw of the sea should definitely consider this issue as \r\nsomething that needs to be addressed. \r\nAs a country that has a keen interest in the \r\noceans and their resources, the Philippines once again \r\nexpresses its commitment to being a constructive and \r\nactive partner in this draft resolution, fully aware of the \r\npromise it holds for the maintenance of legal order on \r\nthe oceans and for our responsibility and duty to ensure \r\nthat we comply with it.\r\nMs. Prince (United States of America): My \r\ndelegation has the honour to co-sponsor the draft \r\nresolutions on oceans and the law of the sea (A/67/L.21) \r\nand on sustainable fisheries (A/67/L.22).\r\nAs the host country, we were pleased to participate \r\nin yesterday’s commemoration of the thirtieth \r\nanniversary of the opening for signature of the United \r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea, and we \r\nare pleased to have the f loor today to discuss related \r\nmatters: the annual draft resolutions on oceans and the \r\nlaw of the sea and on sustainable fisheries.\r\nAs the world community recognized in Rio this \r\npast summer, oceans, seas and coastal areas form an \r\nintegrated and essential component of the Earth’s \r\necosystem and are critical to sustaining it. In fact, \r\nhealthy oceans and coasts, and their resources, are \r\nnecessary for global prosperity. International law, as \r\nreflected in the Convention on the Law of the Sea, \r\nprovides the legal framework for the conservation and \r\nsustainable use of the oceans and their resources. The \r\nannual General Assembly resolutions on oceans and \r\nfisheries that we are debating today serve as important \r\nopportunities for the global community to identify key \r\nmarine-related issues and develop constructive ways \r\nforward to address them.\r\nWe would like to highlight two aspects of this \r\nyear’s draft resolution on oceans. \r\nFirst, we are very pleased that the draft resolution \r\nreflects the many important oceans commitments \r\nin the outcome document of the United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development, “The future \r\nwe want” (resolution 66/288, annex). We believe those \r\ncommitments demonstrate the importance of the oceans \r\nand their resources for sustainable development. \r\nIn particular, we look forward to further work on \r\ninitiatives to address ocean acidification, including \r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency’s new Ocean \r\nAcidification International Coordination Centre, \r\nin Monaco. We believe it is critical to increasing \r\ninternational collaboration on ocean acidification \r\nresearch, monitoring and observation, particularly with \r\nregard to the effects of acidification on shell-forming \r\norganisms, marine biodiversity and food security. That \r\nnew Coordination Centre will serve as an important \r\nmeans to develop a more comprehensive understanding \r\nof the global effects of ocean acidification. Also in \r\nthat regard, we were very pleased by the selection of \r\nthe topic of the impacts of ocean acidification on the \r\nmarine environment for next year’s United Nations \r\nOpen-ended Informal Consultative Process on Oceans \r\nand the Law of the Sea. We look forward to fruitful \r\nexchanges on this important matter in that forum.\r\nThe second important aspect of this year’s ocean \r\nresolution that we wish to highlight relates to progress \r\ntowards the highly anticipated publication of the \r\nfirst global integrated marine assessment, or the \r\nworld ocean assessment, under the Regular Process \r\nfor Global Reporting and Assessment of the State of \r\nthe Marine Environment, including Socio-economic \r\nAspects. The Regular Process was established at the \r\n2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development in \r\nJohannesburg. It is an initiative we have all endorsed, \r\nthrough the General Assembly, as a means to improve \r\nour understanding of the oceans and the efficacy of \r\nthe decisions we make to conserve and manage its \r\nresources. We were pleased to host, last month, a very \r\nsuccessful world oceans assessment workshop for the \r\nwider Caribbean. \r\nWe recognize and appreciate the hard work and \r\ndedication of the Group of Experts of the Regular \r\nProcess. We look forward to working with all of our \r\npartners to establish a robust pool of experts from \r\naround the globe to write and review that ground-\r\nbreaking report on the state of the oceans by 2014.\r\nWe would also like to highlight two key aspects \r\nin this year’s draft resolution on sustainable fisheries \r\n(A/67/L.22).\r\nFirst, we are pleased that it ref lects the many \r\nimportant commitments with regard to fisheries, \r\nconservation and management in the outcome document \r\nof the United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, “The future we want” (resolution 66/288, \r\nannex). We believe those commitments demonstrate \r\nthe importance of sustainable fisheries resources \r\nfor small-scale fisherfolk and women fish workers, \r\n12-64324 5\r\nA/67/PV.52\r\nindigenous peoples, developing countries and small \r\nisland developing States. In addition, they illustrate \r\nthe importance for the international community of \r\nworking collaboratively to eliminate illegal, unreported \r\nand unregulated fishing, to ensure transparency and \r\naccountability in fisheries management by regional \r\nfisheries management organizations, and to enhance \r\nprotection of vulnerable marine ecosystems from \r\nsignificant adverse impacts.\r\nFor several years, the sustainable fisheries \r\nresolutions have urged States to ensure the conservation \r\nand management of sharks and their long-term \r\nsustainable use. Therefore, the second important aspect \r\nof the draft resolution that we wish to highlight is that it \r\nnotes with satisfaction the adoption of the Conservation \r\nPlan for the Memorandum of Understanding on \r\nthe Conservation of Migratory Sharks, under the \r\nConvention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals. \r\nThe United States places significant importance on that \r\ndevelopment and very much welcomes the recognition \r\nby the General Assembly of the important action taken \r\nby the signatories to that agreement.\r\nThe United States would like to thank Director \r\nSergey Tarasenko and the staff of the Division for \r\nOcean Affairs and the Law of the Sea for their expertise \r\nand support on both resolutions. We would also \r\nlike to thank Ambassador Eden Charles of Trinidad \r\nand Tobago for his coordination of the oceans draft \r\nresolution and Ms. Alice Revell of New Zealand for her \r\ncoordination of the fisheries draft resolution. Both did \r\nan outstanding job.\r\nFinally, I would like to conclude by expressing \r\nappreciation for delegations’ hard work and cooperation \r\nin crafting both resolutions. It is our hope that that spirit \r\nof cooperation will characterize our efforts to address \r\nthe numerous and complex issues that lie ahead in the \r\nnew year.\r\nMr. Le Hoai Trung (Viet Nam): Viet Nam joins \r\nother delegations in commending the outstanding \r\ndevelopments in the management and utilization of the \r\noceans and seas in the framework of the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) in various \r\nparts of the world. In full acknowledgement of the \r\ncritical role of the oceans and seas in providing global \r\nfood security and sustaining economic prosperity and \r\nthe well-being of many nations in the world, Viet Nam \r\nsupports the continued due attention of the General \r\nAssembly to the promotion of the sustainable use and \r\ndevelopment of the oceans and seas and their resources.\r\nWe would like to thank the Secretary-General for \r\nthe comprehensive reports contained in documents \r\nA/67/79 and A/67/79/Add.1, which provide the Assembly \r\nwith an excellent review of the developments related to \r\nocean affairs and the law of the sea in the past year for \r\nits discussions on the agenda item.\r\nMy delegation appreciates the outcome of the \r\nhard work done in the past year by the mechanisms \r\nestablished by the General Assembly in connection with \r\nthis item. We encourage the Assembly to consider and \r\nendorse the recommendations and outcomes of the fifth \r\nmeeting of the Ad Hoc Open-ended Informal Working \r\nGroup to study issues relating to the conservation and \r\nsustainable use of marine biological diversity beyond \r\nareas of national jurisdiction, the thirteenth meeting of \r\nthe United Nations Open-ended Informal Consultative \r\nProcess on Oceans and the Law of the Sea, and the \r\nthird meeting of the Ad Hoc Working Group of the \r\nWhole on the Regular Process for Global Reporting and \r\nAssessment of the State of the Marine Environment, \r\nincluding Socioeconomic Aspects. We also note with \r\nappreciation the achievements of the bodies established \r\nby UNCLOS, including the International Seabed \r\nAuthority, the International Tribunal for the Law \r\nof the Sea and the Commission on the Limits of the \r\nContinental Shelf.\r\nWe gather here today to celebrate the thirtieth \r\nanniversary of the opening for signature of UNCLOS, \r\nwhich was undoubtedly an outstanding outcome of the \r\nprogressive codification of international law of the sea. \r\nUNCLOS embodies the aspiration of the international \r\ncommunity for a just international legal order in the \r\noceans and has received almost universal acceptance. \r\nThe constitution for the oceans, as it has been aptly \r\ntermed, sets out a comprehensive legal framework \r\nwithin which all activities in the oceans and seas must \r\nbe carried out. It constitutes the principal basis for \r\nthe maintenance of peace and stability, the promotion \r\nof maritime economic development and the rational \r\nexploitation and conservation of marine natural \r\nresources and the environment in all maritime areas \r\nunder or beyond national jurisdiction. \r\nIn addition, UNCLOS sets up a new mechanism \r\nof dispute settlement, which offers the States parties \r\nadditional important means of peaceful solution to their \r\ndisputes in relation to the interpretation and application \r\nof the Convention.\r\nUNCLOS provides a fine balance of rights and \r\nduties of States parties. It does not allow reservations \r\n6 12-64324\r\nA/67/PV.52\r\nto be made to any provision. States parties to the \r\nConvention are therefore obliged to implement it fully, \r\nin good faith and in a responsible manner. They are to \r\nrespect the legitimate rights to which coastal States \r\nparties are entitled in their territorial seas, contiguous \r\nzone, exclusive economic zone and continental shelf. \r\nThey are to cooperate in the development of marine \r\nscientific research, the optimum exploitation of living \r\nresources and conservation of the marine environment, \r\nand to manage the international seabed in the interest \r\nof mankind.\r\nViet Nam actively and constructively participated \r\nin the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of \r\nthe Sea in Montego Bay, Jamaica. Viet Nam was among \r\nthe 100 States to sign the Convention on 10 December \r\n1982, immediately after its adoption. Since its \r\nratification of UNCLOS in 1994, Viet Nam has made \r\ngreat efforts to implement the Convention, as shown in \r\nthe report on Viet Nam’s implementation of UNCLOS \r\nsubmitted to the Secretary-General for circulation as \r\nan official document of the sixty-seventh session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly under agenda item 75 (a), “Oceans \r\nand the law of the sea”. \r\nFurthermore, in line with the provisions of \r\nUNCLOS and related State practices, Viet Nam adopted \r\nthe Law of the Sea of Viet Nam in June. The Law is a \r\nsignificant legislative effort to harmonize the provisions \r\nof UNCLOS into our national law, contributing to the \r\nimprovement of the national legal framework relating \r\nto the sea and the islands of Viet Nam. For the first \r\ntime, we have a law of the highest legal effect under \r\nthe Constitution that contains a comprehensive legal \r\nregime for Viet Nam’s maritime zones and islands. The \r\nLaw of the Sea of Viet Nam provides the country and \r\nforeign entities and individuals operating in the marine \r\nareas under Viet Nam’s jurisdiction a fundamental legal \r\nbasis for the use, management and protection of marine \r\nareas and resources, including cooperative activities \r\nwith other countries on marine economic development. \r\nAs a country with 3,260 kilometres of coastline \r\nfacing the South China Sea, known as the Eastern Sea in \r\nVietnamese, Viet Nam’s interest in the sea is significant. \r\nWe care very dearly about the maintenance of peace \r\nand stability, including maritime security, as well as the \r\npromotion of prosperity and friendly cooperation in the \r\nSouth China Sea in accordance with international law, \r\nin particular UNCLOS. In that connection, Viet Nam \r\ncalls on all signatory States to fully implement, and \r\nother States to support the implementation of, the 2002 \r\nDeclaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China \r\nSea adopted by the Association of Southeast Asian \r\nNations (ASEAN) and China and the 2012 statement of \r\nASEAN Foreign Ministers on its Six-Point Principles \r\non the South China Sea. Viet Nam stands ready to work \r\ntowards the early conclusion of a code of conduct in \r\nthe South China Sea, with a view to further promoting \r\npeace, stability and cooperation in the region.\r\nMs. Picco (Monaco) (spoke in French): “The \r\nfuture we want” (resolution 66/288, annex), the outcome \r\ndocument adopted by the United Nations Conference \r\non Sustainable Development (Rio+20 Conference) in \r\nJune, pays particular attention to issues related to the \r\noceans, their resources and the threats facing them. In \r\ndoing so, that important document highlights the vital \r\npolitical aspect of the General Assembly’s role in its \r\nannual deliberations on oceans and the law of the sea. \r\nThe statements made at the commemorative meetings \r\nheld in this Hall on the thirtieth anniversary of the \r\nadoption of the United Nations Convention on the Law \r\nof the Sea recall the commitment of States to that true \r\nconstitution of the oceans.\r\nMonaco celebrated that event by hosting \r\nthe colloquium “The Law of the Sea 30, Years \r\nAfter Montego Bay: Economic Opportunities and \r\nEnvironmental Challenges” last October. This year, \r\nvarious innovative initiatives were also submitted and \r\nimplemented. The World Bank launched the Global \r\nPartnership for Oceans and submitted the Declaration \r\nfor Healthy and Productive Oceans to Help Reduce \r\nPoverty to the Rio+20 Conference. The international \r\nexposition in Yeosu, Republic of Korea, under the \r\ntheme of “The Living Ocean and Coast”, provided the \r\nframework for the third edition of the Monaco Blue \r\nInitiative on the theme of “Marine Protected Areas: a \r\nwin-win for biodiversity and economic development”. \r\nSuch areas are useful tools in combating overfishing \r\nand reconstituting fish stocks.\r\nIn a protected and regulated environment, \r\nsustainable tourism, aquaculture and development \r\nactivities can be undertaken successfully without \r\nharming the environment.  The Yeosu exposition also \r\nsaw the launching of the Secretary-General’s “Oceans \r\nCompact — Healthy Oceans for Prosperity” initiative.\r\nUnder the leadership of His Serene Highness Prince \r\nAlbert II, the Principality of Monaco is continuing its \r\nlong-standing commitment and redoubling its efforts \r\nto promote awareness of the need to protect oceans \r\non account of their vital role in ensuring sustainable \r\n12-64324 7\r\nA/67/PV.52\r\ndevelopment. The strategic importance of the \r\ncontribution of oceans in the areas of food security, \r\ntourism, the protection of marine biodiversity and \r\nenergy compels us to implement the parameters of a blue \r\neconomy. It also requires that, together, we appreciate \r\nthe social, economic and environmental value of the \r\noceans and organize our cooperation in line with the \r\nrealities that we all face.\r\nTo that end and in the post-2015 context, Monaco \r\nwill support the defining of a sustainable development \r\ngoal on the oceans, which should unify our action. \r\nSuch cooperation should be established with all actors, \r\nincluding the private sector, and should be based on the \r\nknowledge provided by the scientific community.\r\nWe can only note that, every year, there is an \r\nincreasing need to mitigate the effects of climate \r\nchange, in particular ocean acidification. The issue of \r\nocean acidification, which has appeared in the General \r\nAssembly resolution since its sixty-first session, \r\nreceives increased attention this year. The Government \r\nof Monaco welcomes the establishment of the Ocean \r\nAcidification International Coordination Centre within \r\nthe Environmental Laboratories of the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Monaco. The \r\nsetting up of the Centre was declared by the American \r\nauthorities and the IAEA on the margins of the Rio+20 \r\nConference.\r\nThat cooperation platform will make it possible to \r\nbetter understand acidification, to deepen research, to \r\nfollow developments in various regions of the world \r\nthat are not affected in the same way and to define \r\nsolutions for the most vulnerable organisms, including \r\ncrustaceans and corals.\r\nThe second International Workshop on the \r\nacidification of oceans, held in Monaco from 11 to \r\n13 November, was devoted to the socioeconomic impact \r\nof ocean acidification on fishing and aquaculture. Fifty-\r\nfive experts from 19 countries and representatives of \r\ninternational organizations met at the invitation of the \r\nIAEA and of the Scientific Centre of Monaco, which \r\nhas been working on ocean acidification for several \r\nyears.\r\nWe also welcome the fact that the Open-Ended \r\nInformal Consultative Process on Oceans and the Law \r\nof the Sea has been extended for a new period of two \r\nyears and that its fourteenth meeting in June 2013 will \r\nfocus on the effects of ocean acidification on the marine \r\nenvironment.\r\nThe Principality of Monaco supports the urgency \r\nstated in Rio of taking a decision before the end of the \r\nsixty-ninth session of the General Assembly on drawing \r\nup an international instrument on the conservation and \r\nsustainable exploitation of marine biodiversity in areas \r\nbeyond national jurisdiction in the context of the United \r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea.\r\nI would like to warmly thank the representatives of \r\nTrinidad and Tobago and New Zealand, who efficiently \r\nconducted the consultations on the two draft resolutions \r\nthat Monaco sponsors (A/67/L.21 and A/67/L.22). Our \r\nthanks also go to the Division for Ocean Affairs and \r\nthe Law of the Sea, the specialized institutions of the \r\nUnited Nations and the other bodies working in the area \r\nof oceans and the law of the sea, whose work provide \r\nthe basis for our annual debates. \r\nMr. Yamazaki (Japan): Let me first join other \r\nrepresentatives in thanking the coordinators of the \r\ntwo draft resolutions (A/67/L.21 and A/67/L.22), \r\nAmbassador Eden Charles, Deputy Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Trinidad and Tobago, and Ms. Alice \r\nRevell, Legal Adviser of the Permanent Mission of \r\nNew Zealand, for their tremendous work. I also wish to \r\nthank all Member States that have worked together in a \r\nspirit of cooperation during the informal consultations \r\non the draft resolutions. My appreciation also goes to \r\nthe United Nations Secretariat for its assistance.\r\nWith regard to agenda item 75 (a), entitled “Oceans \r\nand the law of the sea”, Japan would like to point out \r\nthat it is a maritime State surrounded by water and \r\ndependent on maritime transport for nearly all imports \r\nof energy resources, including oil and minerals. The \r\nadoption of draft resolution A/67/L.21, which deals \r\nwith crucial issues for the maintenance of peace and \r\nsecurity in the world, such as the peaceful settlement \r\nof disputes, the freedom of navigation, safety at sea \r\nand compliance with international laws, including \r\nthe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea \r\n(UNCLOS), is extremely important to maritime States, \r\nsuch as Japan, and to the international community as \r\na whole. In that regard, Japan is pleased to co-sponsor \r\nthat draft resolution, which is entitled “Oceans and \r\nthe law of the sea”. Japan would also like to take this \r\nopportunity to welcome the accession of Ecuador and \r\nSwaziland to UNCLOS.\r\nWith respect to the International Tribunal for the \r\nLaw of the Sea, Japan highly appreciates the important \r\nrole played by the Tribunal in terms of the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes, as well as the maintenance \r\n8 12-64324\r\nA/67/PV.52\r\nby members of the Commission from developing \r\nStates. Japan firmly believes that through voluntary \r\ncontributions to the trust funds by State parties and \r\nthe steady implementation of the measures decided last \r\nyear to solve the issue of the heavy workload of the \r\nCommission, the smooth and expeditious consideration \r\nof submissions by the Commission, to which members \r\nwere newly elected in June, will be possible.\r\nRegarding the maritime safety and security issue, \r\npiracy off the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden, \r\nwhich is now spreading to areas off the East Africa \r\ncoast and the Indian Ocean, continues to pose a serious \r\nthreat to maritime security. Japan is of the view that \r\na multilayered approach that includes assistance to \r\nmaritime enforcement capacity-building in Somalia \r\nand its neighbouring countries and other medium- to \r\nlong-term efforts to strengthen stability in Somalia, in \r\naddition to operations by naval vessels, must be pursued \r\nto suppress piracy.\r\nJapan has currently deployed escort ships and patrol \r\naircraft to the region, and works together with other \r\ncountries to deal with piracy. In addition, Japan has so far \r\ndisbursed $14.6 million and $3.5 million, respectively, \r\nto the International Maritime Organization Djibouti \r\nCode of Conduct Trust Fund, which is a multi-donor \r\ntrust fund that Japan initiated, and to the Trust Fund to \r\nSupport Initiatives of States Countering Piracy off the \r\nCoast of Somalia. Japan also continues to play a leading \r\nrole within the framework of the Regional Cooperation \r\nAgreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery \r\nagainst Ships in Asia. \r\nWith regard to agenda item 75 (b), entitled \r\n“Sustainable fisheries”, Japan would like to state that, as \r\na responsible fishing State and a State party to UNCLOS \r\nand the 1995 Agreement for the Implementation of \r\nthe Provisions of the United Nations Convention on \r\nthe Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to \r\nthe Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish \r\nStocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks, Japan is \r\ncommitted to addressing the promotion of sustainable \r\nuse through the conservation and management \r\nof marine living resources and the appropriate \r\nconservation of the marine ecosystem, in cooperation \r\nwith the parties concerned, through bilateral fisheries \r\nagreements, the Food and Agriculture Organization of \r\nthe United Nations and regional fisheries management \r\norganizations.\r\nJapan welcomes recent developments in the \r\nmanagement of high-seas bottom fishing, including the \r\nand development of the rule of the law at sea. Japan \r\nwelcomes the fact that cases have been continually \r\nsubmitted to the Tribunal since its establishment. \r\nJapan also welcomes the Tribunal’s first maritime \r\ndelimitation judgement, which was delivered in March \r\nof this year, following the first advisory opinion of the \r\nSeabed Disputes Chamber of the Tribunal, issued in \r\nFebruary 2011, pursuant to a request by the Council of \r\nthe International Seabed Authority. Japan is pleased to \r\nsee that the Tribunal’s work covers various fields. Japan \r\nis committed to continuing its contribution to and full \r\nsupport for the valuable work of the Tribunal, under the \r\nleadership of President Yanai.\r\nWith regard to the International Seabed Authority, \r\nJapan welcomes the adoption in July of the Regulations \r\non Prospecting and Exploration for Cobalt-rich \r\nFerromanganese Crusts in the Area, following the \r\nadoption of the Regulations on Prospecting and \r\nExploration for Polymetallic Nodules in the Area \r\nin 2000 and the Regulations for Prospecting and \r\nExploration for Polymetallic Sulphides in the Area in \r\n2010.\r\nIn view of the importance of ensuring a well-\r\nbalanced approach between exploration and \r\nenvironmental protection in the Area, Japan highly \r\nvalues the workshops on such issues organized by the \r\nAuthority. Japan has been supporting the activities \r\nundertaken by the Authority in various ways, including \r\nthrough the Japanese contractor for the exploration of \r\npolymetallic nodules and other relevant organizations. \r\nI would like to affirm Japan’s intention to continue its \r\nsupport to the Authority.\r\nWith regard to the Commission on the Limits of the \r\nContinental Shelf, I wish to pay tribute to its consistent \r\nwork on a total of 61 submissions, which has led to \r\nthe adoption of 18 recommendations, including on the \r\nsubmission of Japan. In the light of the considerable \r\nnumber of submissions, Japan is confident that the \r\nseveral measures adopted by the Commission, including \r\non the extended duration of the Commission’s sessions \r\nin 2013, on the basis of decisions taken through last \r\nyear’s resolution under this agenda item (resolution \r\n66/231), will help solve the Commission’s workload \r\nissue.\r\nFollowing its pledge at the twenty-second Meeting \r\nof States Parties to UNCLOS, held in June, Japan made \r\nan additional disbursement of approximately $352,000 \r\nto the trust fund at the end of November for the purpose \r\nof defraying the costs of participation in its meetings \r\n12-64324 9\r\nA/67/PV.52\r\nf lexible to ensure that it could be successfully \r\nimplemented in practice over an extended period of \r\ntime. Today, we can say with pride that the principles \r\non which that universal international document is based \r\nhave proved their worth. The Convention is a living and \r\ncontemporary instrument of great importance to the \r\ninternational community. \r\nThe significance of the world’s oceans for \r\nhumankind continues to increase. It is highly \r\nimportant today to ensure the sustainability of marine \r\nactivity, maritime safety, the management of marine \r\nresources, and a healthy marine environment for future \r\ngenerations. We stress that States themselves should \r\nplay the main role in addressing problems. The scale \r\nand complexity of the problems we face in this sphere \r\nrequire us to focus our efforts on developing a unifying \r\nagenda. In that context, we note the understanding on \r\nmarine issues that was achieved during the United \r\nNations Conference on Sustainable Development in Rio \r\nde Janeiro in June. \r\nThe Russian Federation calls for the conservation \r\nand sustainable use of marine resources, in accordance \r\nwith the Convention. At the same time, in the absence \r\nof reliable science and a solid legal basis we cannot \r\nsupport initiatives that may lead to the arbitrary \r\nlimitation of marine activities. \r\nWe welcome the progress achieved in the Ad Hoc \r\nOpen-ended Informal Working Group to study issues \r\nrelating to the conservation and sustainable use of \r\nmarine biological diversity beyond areas of national \r\njurisdiction. We suggest that the Group should be \r\nthe primary forum for reviewing issues of biological \r\nocean resources. We welcome the General Assembly’s \r\ndecision to hold two thematic workshops in 2013 to \r\nwork towards a better understanding of problems in \r\nthat sphere.\r\nThe successful functioning of the bodies set up \r\npursuant to the Convention inspires hope. States must \r\ntake further measures to create favourable conditions \r\nfor their work. In that regard, particular attention \r\nshould be given to the Commission on the Limits of the \r\nContinental Shelf, which has a considerable workload. \r\nIn our view, the Commission is fulfilling its functions \r\nvery well, and we commend the measures aimed at \r\nspeeding up the processing of State communications \r\nwithout any loss in the quality of the reviews.\r\nWe note the high quality of the work of the Division \r\nfor Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea, under \r\nconclusion of arrangements establishing new regional \r\nfisheries management organizations, which reflects \r\nearlier resolutions on sustainable fisheries, especially \r\nthose adopted in 2006 and 2009. Japan will further \r\npromote the management of high-seas bottom fishing \r\nby mobilizing support for the earliest entry into force \r\nof those arrangements in cooperation with other parties \r\nand related organizations.\r\nBefore concluding, Japan wishes to express its \r\nhope that the two draft resolutions before us, which \r\nare the result of intensive negotiations among Member \r\nStates in a spirit of cooperation during the informal \r\nconsultations, will be duly adopted at this session of \r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nMr. Panin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): \r\nWe speak with special feeling in today’s meeting on the \r\nissue of the international law of the sea, on the occasion \r\nof the thirtieth anniversary of the opening for signature \r\nof the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea \r\nin 1982. We echo words spoken yesterday and today \r\non the historic significance of the Convention and its \r\nrole in ensuring effective international cooperation in \r\nthe use of the world’s oceans. We pay tribute to those \r\nwho were present at the birth of the Convention and \r\ncontributed to its drafting.\r\nGiven the number of parties to the Convention \r\nfrom all regions of the world, it can be said without \r\ndoubt that this international treaty, encompassing all \r\naspects of marine activity, has become a genuinely \r\nglobal instrument. It is important that we vigilantly \r\nmaintain the integrity of the legal regime established \r\nby the Convention and the multilateral, conscientious \r\nimplementation of its provisions, in the interest of stable \r\nand predictable relations among States in maritime and \r\nmarine matters.\r\nOf course, the world is changing. It is developing, \r\nand international law is also developing. Recently, we \r\nhave heard ideas about expanding some provisions of \r\nthe Convention. In some cases, those ideas are based on \r\nsituations that actually exist, and we must not back away \r\nfrom making comprehensive, in-depth studies of such \r\nproposals. At the same time, however, we must refrain \r\nfrom taking steps that would change the Convention’s \r\ntime-tested norms. \r\nWe must also bear in mind that the Convention \r\nwas adopted as a package decision and a multifaceted \r\ndocument that reflects a very delicate balance of \r\ninterests. The Convention was intentionally made \r\n10 12-64324\r\nA/67/PV.52\r\nDirector Sergey Tarasenko. We believe that, given the \r\nincreased workload of the Division and other relevant \r\nentities, States should offer additional support. We \r\nwelcome the increasing activity of the International \r\nTribunal for the Law of the Sea, which demonstrates \r\nthe trust States place in the Tribunal as an effective \r\ninstrument of international justice. We highly commend \r\nits contribution to developing jurisprudence on the law \r\nof the sea and the positive trend in its work. We hope \r\nthat will continue in the future. \r\nThe Russian Federation pays particular attention to \r\nmeasures to conserve and manage fish resources. We \r\nwelcome the increase in measures to combat illegal, \r\nunreported and unregulated fishing. We are pleased to \r\nnote the consistent steps being taken to bolster controls \r\nby f lag States, and the increasingly effective measures \r\nimplemented by port States. The Russian Federation \r\nwill continue to actively participate in measures to \r\nprotect vulnerable marine ecosystems, both on its own \r\nand within the framework of relevant regional fisheries \r\nmanagement organizations.\r\nIn conclusion, we thank Ambassador Eden Charles \r\nand Ms. Alice Revell, coordinators of the informal \r\nconsultations on draft resolution A/67/L.21 on oceans \r\nand the law of the sea and draft resolution A/67/L.22 on \r\nsustainable fisheries, for their work to create consensus. \r\nMrs. Daniel (Nauru): At the outset, let me align \r\nmy delegation with the statements delivered by \r\nthe representative of Palau on behalf of the Pacific \r\nIsland Forum and by the representative of Samoa on \r\nbehalf of the Pacific small island developing States \r\n(see A/67/PV.51).\r\nThe topic of this meeting is an important one to \r\nNauru. Marine and coastal resources are critical to \r\nour economy, our food security and our culture. The \r\nsustainable use of our marine resources is one of our \r\nprimary tools for eradicating poverty, and we hope to \r\nensure healthy oceans and access to their resources not \r\nonly for ourselves but for future generations as well. \r\nUnfortunately, there are many challenges to that hope.\r\nMarine, ocean, coastal and fisheries resources \r\nare the foundations of the economies of Pacific small \r\nisland developing States (SIDS) and represent a critical \r\npathway to future growth. However, current benefits to \r\nthe Pacific from the utilization of those resources are \r\ninequitable, as is the conservation burden. That must \r\nchange.\r\nThe capacity of developing States, including \r\nthe least developed among them, and of small island \r\ndeveloping States to participate in straddling and highly \r\nmigratory fisheries has to be built or enhanced, and \r\nwe must take the measures necessary for developing \r\nStates participating in regional fisheries management \r\norganizations to enjoy a greater and fairer share of \r\nfishing opportunities. To that end, we look forward \r\nto the identification and mainstreaming by 2014 of \r\nstrategies that will assist our people to realize the \r\nbenefits of sustainable fisheries, including through \r\nimproved market access. We remind all of the need to \r\nensure access to fisheries and markets for countries \r\nlike Nauru, as agreed to in the 1995 Agreement for the \r\nImplementation of the Provisions of the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December \r\n1982 relating to the Conservation and Management \r\nof Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish \r\nStocks, and reiterated in draft resolution A/67/L.22, \r\non sustainable fisheries, which we have come here to \r\nadopt.\r\nThe 2014 timeline for that work will be especially \r\nimportant, given the upcoming International Conference \r\non SIDS to be held that year in the Pacific. As noted in \r\ndraft resolution A/67/L.21, the omnibus text on oceans \r\nand the law of the sea, the Conference will consider, \r\namong other issues, the challenges SIDS face in the \r\nconservation and sustainable use of marine resources \r\nand in the preservation of the marine environment. We \r\nthank our neighbour Samoa for hosting that historic \r\nmeeting, and we look forward to working with others \r\nto ensure its success.\r\nWe are deeply concerned by the numerous \r\npressures being put on the oceans. One critical example \r\nis overfishing. Scientists have repeatedly stated that \r\noverfishing is one of the major threats to ocean health. \r\nIllegal, unreported and unregulated fishing further \r\nexacerbates the threat, while destructive fishing \r\npractices such as bottom trawling cause enormous \r\ndamage to marine ecosystems. \r\nThe issues are not new, but innovative approaches, \r\nrenewed commitment and urgent implementation of \r\nstrategies to combat unsustainable and destructive \r\nfishing must be at the forefront of building a resilient \r\nocean, thereby safeguarding food security and a \r\nsustainable future for countries like Nauru. We are \r\ntherefore pleased that the international community has \r\ncommitted to maintaining or restoring stocks to levels \r\nthat can produce maximum sustainable yield by the \r\n12-64324 11\r\nA/67/PV.52\r\nthat provide shelter for fish in the open ocean. Setting \r\npurse-seine nets around these devices often results in \r\ncatches of juvenile bigeye tuna that have not yet had \r\na chance to breed, contributing to overfishing of the \r\nspecies. In the context of its national plan of action, \r\nNauru is proud to state that we were among the first to \r\ninstitute controls on industrial fish-aggregating devices. \r\nWe are pleased to see that the international community \r\nnow also recognizes the need to quantify and control \r\nthe use of these devices, and we look forward to the \r\nimplementation of such action.\r\nOne of our biggest problems at the moment is not \r\nwith highly migratory and straddling stocks — which \r\nwe feel are coming under control in the tropical \r\nwestern Pacific — but with artisanal reef fisheries. The \r\ninformation needs of those local fisheries are of an order \r\nof magnitude more complex than those of tuna fisheries, \r\nand yet in our region the development resources devoted \r\nto them by the international community are, in fact, of \r\nan order of magnitude less. \r\nThose are national issues and, of course, require \r\nnational action, but we would ask that international \r\ninitiatives and regional agencies not lose sight of the \r\nfisheries that are so important to our people at the \r\nlocal level and that they not concentrate their efforts \r\nexclusively upon the straddling and highly migratory \r\nfisheries, with respect to which they can get the most \r\nrecognition or obtain the easiest wins. \r\nI am not talking about increased basic research on \r\nreef ecosystems; we have enough species lists to last us \r\na lifetime. What we need is more attention to fishing \r\nitself — building systems that work at the local level \r\nby talking to fishers, compiling hard information on \r\ntheir activities and needs, and helping them to work out \r\nsocially applicable solutions to any overfishing that is \r\nidentified. We would urge that those considerations be \r\ntaken under advisement in the work of our partners and \r\nof the United Nations system.\r\nIn the outcome document of the United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development, “The \r\nFuture We Want” (resolution 66/288, annex), leaders \r\ncommitted themselves to protecting and restoring \r\nthe health, productivity and resilience of oceans and \r\nmarine ecosystems, enabling their conservation and \r\nsustainable use for present and future generations. We \r\nbelieve that we will have moved in the correct direction \r\nwith the adoption of the draft resolutions here today. We \r\nlook forward to further advancing that work through \r\n2015 deadline, as agreed to under the Johannesburg \r\nPlan of Implementation. We hope that those will not be \r\nempty words.\r\nWe in Nauru are proud that the biomass of all the \r\nhighly migratory and straddling fish stocks assessed by \r\nthe Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission \r\n(WCPFC) are above the levels capable of producing \r\nmaximum sustainable yield, as qualified by relevant \r\nenvironmental and other factors, and that none of those \r\ntropical regional fish stocks require rebuilding, thanks \r\nlargely to effective cooperation among coastal States of \r\nthe region. \r\nWe do, however, have concerns that the biomass \r\nof bigeye tuna might be reduced below maximum \r\nsustainable yield by 2015 if high levels of fishing \r\nmortality continue on the tropical Pacific high seas. We \r\nhope that the collective membership of the WCPFC will \r\nfollow the lead of the parties to the Nauru Agreement in \r\nimposing compulsory limits on the vessels under their \r\njurisdiction, particularly longliners. The nations that \r\nare parties to the Nauru Agreement will be applying an \r\noverall effort to limit longline fishing in their combined \r\nexclusive economic zones — an area of nearly 14 million \r\nsquare kilometres — from 1 January 2013.\r\nAnother issue of deep concern is ocean acidification. \r\nThe combined impacts of climate change — namely, \r\nsea-level rise, increased sea-surface temperature and \r\nintensified storm activity — and the adverse effects \r\nof ocean acidification caused by increased dissolved \r\ncarbon dioxide heighten the threat to ocean health. \r\nCoral reef ecosystems are particularly susceptible to \r\nclimate change and ocean acidification and may be the \r\nfirst marine ecosystems to collapse without urgent, \r\nincreased mitigation action.\r\nUrgent and deep reductions in greenhouse-gas \r\nemissions are a global imperative. In addition, given \r\nexisting levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and \r\noceans, building the resilience of vulnerable marine \r\necosystems to the impacts of climate change and \r\nocean acidification is essential to enabling sustainable \r\ndevelopment and eradicating poverty. We look forward \r\nto the increased focus on that issue at the upcoming \r\nmeeting of the Informal Consultative Process on \r\nOceans and the Law of the Sea.\r\nWe would also like to highlight the new text in this \r\nyear’s draft resolution on sustainable fisheries on the \r\nneed to quantify and control the use of large-scale fish \r\naggregating devices, which are man-made structures \r\n12 12-64324\r\nA/67/PV.52\r\nthe Commission in finding appropriate solutions to the \r\nproblems related to its workload, and we congratulate \r\nits members on their election. \r\nSecondly, the Chinese delegation congratulates the \r\nInternational Seabed Authority on its achievements \r\nover the past year, and Mr. Nii Allotey Odunton on \r\nhis re-election as Secretary-General of the Authority. \r\nThe Chinese Government has continuously and firmly \r\nsupported the work of the Authority and the effective \r\nand full participation of developing countries in \r\ninternational seabed affairs. \r\nIn July, China made a further donation of $20,000 \r\nto the Authority’s voluntary trust fund to facilitate the \r\nparticipation of developing countries in meetings of \r\nthe Legal and Technical Commission and the Finance \r\nCommittee. Last month, a Chinese research institute \r\nand the Authority jointly convened an international \r\nworkshop in Beijing on the implementation of article 8 \r\nof the Convention. The Authority has begun formulating \r\nregulations on the exploitation of resources in the \r\nArea. China is of the view that such formulating work \r\nshould be progressive, aligned with technological and \r\nindustrial advances, and reflect an appropriate balance \r\nbetween resource utilization and environmental \r\nprotection, and between exploitation interests and those \r\nof the international community as a whole.\r\nThirdly, China notes the increasing activities of \r\nthe ITLOS in terms of both its caseload and number \r\nof decisions, the increasing topical coverage of cases, \r\nand the Tribunal’s growing influence, which indicate \r\nthat the judicial body has entered a new phase of \r\ncomprehensive implemention of its mandate under \r\nthe Convention. The Tribunal is also playing an active \r\npart in assisting the capacity-building of developing \r\ncountries, which China greatly appreciates. China \r\nvalues and supports the important role of the Tribunal \r\nin the peaceful settlement of maritime disputes, and the \r\nmaintenance of the international maritime order and \r\nin raising awareness on issues concerning the law of \r\nthe oceans and seas. We will continue to support the \r\nefforts of the Tribunal to enhance the capacity-building \r\nof developing countries.\r\nFourthly, the Chinese side supports the adoption by \r\nthe General Assembly of the concrete recommendations \r\nof the Ad Hoc Open-ended Informal Working Group to \r\nstudy issues related to the conservation and sustainable \r\nuse of marine biological diversity beyond areas of \r\nnational jurisdiction. China is of the view that since \r\nthe high seas and international seabed Area involve \r\nthe eventual adoption of a sustainable development goal \r\non oceans.\r\nMr. Li Baodong (China) (spoke in Chinese): \r\nOceans and seas cover 71 per cent of the Earth’s \r\nsurface and are closely linked to the survival and \r\ndevelopment of humankind. The maritime order is a \r\nsignificant component of the international order. As \r\nan important legal document governing contemporary \r\ninternational maritime order, the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), with \r\ndue regard for the sovereignty of all States, establishes \r\nnorms on fundamental maritime issues, including the \r\nlegal status of various parts of the ocean, the rights \r\nand obligations of States, the utilization of maritime \r\nresources, environmental protection of the oceans and \r\nseas, maritime demarcation and dispute settlement.\r\nIn a stroke of creative genius, it has designated \r\ninternational seabed areas beyond national jurisdictions \r\nas the common heritage of humankind and established \r\ninstitutions, such as the International Seabed Authority, \r\nthe Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf \r\n(CLCS) and the International Tribunal for the Law of the \r\nSea (ITLOS), to effectively manage the exploitation of \r\ninternational seabed resources, the delimitation of the \r\nouter limits of the continental shelf, and the settlement \r\nof maritime disputes. The Convention affirms that \r\nmatters not regulated by it continue to be governed by \r\nthe rules and principles of basic international law, thus \r\nensuring its inclusiveness and openness.\r\nTo date, the Convention has earned worldwide \r\nrecognition and has been widely supported and upheld \r\nby the international community. On the occasion of \r\nthe commemoration of the thirtieth anniversary of the \r\nopening for signature of the Convention, I wish to pay \r\nthe highest tribute to those who contributed to the birth \r\nof the Convention, particularly the late Ambassador \r\nArvid Pardo of Malta and the late Ambassador Hamilton \r\nShirley Amerasinghe, of Sri Lanka. \r\nI wish to take the opportunity to elaborate on China’s \r\nposition and views on various aspects of the oceans and \r\nthe law of the sea. First, China highly commends the \r\nCLCS for its contribution to the balanced handling of \r\nthe legitimate rights and interests of coastal States and \r\nthe overall interests of the international community. \r\nWe support the Commission’s ongoing fulfilment of its \r\nmandate in accordance with the Convention and its own \r\nrules of procedure, in order to maintain the quality and \r\nprofessionalism of its consideration of submissions. We \r\ncall on the international community to continue to assist \r\n12-64324 13\r\nA/67/PV.52\r\nmaintenance of a harmonious maritime order under \r\nwhich the international community must emphasize \r\nboth the proper protection of the ocean and its rational \r\nuse; strike a balance between the interests of coastal \r\nStates and the overall interests of the international \r\ncommunity; properly accommodate the legitimate rights \r\nand freedoms of all countries, especially developing \r\ncountries, landlocked countries and geographically \r\ndisadvantaged countries, with respect to the use of the \r\nocean; and promote the peaceful settlement of maritime \r\ndisputes in accordance with the purposes and principles \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations and of international \r\nlaw, including the UNCLOS.\r\nChina has consistently pursued an independent \r\nforeign policy of peace and good-neighbourliness \r\nby building friendships and partnerships with \r\nneighbouring countries.\r\nAs to international insular and maritime disputes, \r\nChina maintains its position that sovereign States \r\ndirectly concerned should seek a peaceful settlement \r\nthrough friendly consultation and negotiation based \r\non international law, including the Convention. China \r\nbelieves that establishing and maintaining a harmonious \r\nmaritime order will enable all countries to benefit from \r\nthe opportunities offered by the ocean, seek common \r\nresponses to the challenges of the ocean, and further \r\nthe common development of marine areas. In that \r\ncontext, such order is in the interest of the international \r\ncommunity as a whole.\r\nFinally, I thank Ambassador Eden Charles of \r\nTrinidad and Tobago and Ms. Alice Revell of New \r\nZealand for their contributions as facilitators of draft \r\nresolutions A/67/L.21 and A/67/L.22. \r\nMr. Shapoval (Ukraine): At the outset, I would \r\nlike to thank the Secretary-General for his extensive \r\nand helpful report on the subject of oceans and the law \r\nof the sea (A/67/79). Aligning itself with the statement \r\nof the European Union, my delegation would like to \r\ntake the f loor in its national capacity.\r\nThese days, we are celebrating the thirtieth \r\nanniversary of the opening for signature of the 1982 \r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea \r\n(UNCLOS). I am proud that my delegation is among \r\nthose that have put their signatures to that historic \r\ndocument, which has indeed become a constitution \r\nfor the oceans. An affirmative answer will respond \r\nto the question raised by Ambassador Tommy Koh \r\nof Singapore 30 years ago: yes, the Convention has \r\nthe interests of the entire international community, the \r\nproper handling of marine biodiversity of those areas is \r\ncrucial to the maintenance of an equitable and rational \r\ninternational maritime order. Relevant work should \r\ntherefore proceed incrementally and fully accommodate \r\nthe legitimate needs of all countries, especially \r\ndeveloping countries, for marine bioresources. \r\nIn addition, China notes with satisfaction the \r\nestablishment of the institutional framework of the \r\nRegular Process for Global Reporting and Assessment \r\nof the State of the Marine Environment, including \r\nSocioeconomic Aspects, as well as the positive progress \r\non various aspects of the Regular Process. Under United \r\nNations auspices, in February China hosted a workshop \r\nin Sanya on the eastern and south-eastern Asia seas, \r\nthereby contributing to regional capacity-building in \r\nmarine environmental assessment. China considers the \r\nsmooth progress of the Regular Process important and \r\nlooks forward to its anticipated outcomes. We support \r\nenhancing the Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law \r\nof the Sea as the secretariat of the Regular Process.\r\nFifthly, China continues to attach high importance \r\nto the issue of greenhouse-gas emissions from ships, \r\nand has taken note of the relevant work carried out \r\nby the International Maritime Organization. China \r\nbelieves that the key to addressing that question is \r\nto uphold the principle of common but differentiated \r\nresponsibilities established by the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change. At present, \r\nwork on that issue should focus on facilitating the \r\ntechnological advancement of developing countries \r\nthrough technology transfer and capacity-building with \r\na view to improving the energy efficiency of ships.\r\nSixthly, as a responsible fishing nation, China takes an \r\nactive part in the work of various international fisheries \r\norganizations and is committed to strengthening the \r\nconservation and management of fisheries resources. \r\nChina will continue to work with the countries \r\nconcerned to promote the development and refinement \r\nof the international fisheries management regime and \r\nthe regulation of fishing activities in order to achieve \r\nthe sustainable use of marine bioresources, conserve \r\nthe marine ecological balance, and ensure the sharing \r\nof fisheries benefits by all countries. \r\nChina advocates enhanced international cooperation \r\nand coordination in line with the spirit of the Convention \r\nin order to safeguard the peace, security and openness \r\nof the oceans and to promote the common development \r\nof all countries. We advocate the establishment and \r\n14 12-64324\r\nA/67/PV.52\r\nof which piracy is the most pressing. Ukraine stands \r\nready to further actively engage in this subject matter \r\nwithin the framework of the United Nations and other \r\ncompetent entities, and welcomes Member States’ \r\ninitiatives and suggestions in this regard.\r\nAs one of the major States of seafarers’ origin, \r\nUkraine notes with appreciation that the comprehensive \r\nannual resolution on the law of the sea has continuously \r\nencouraged Member States, the International Maritime \r\nOrganization, the International Labour Organization \r\nand other actors to develop measures aimed at \r\nprotecting the welfare of seafarers who are victims \r\nof pirates, including measures for their post-incident \r\ntreatment and reintegration into society. We highly \r\nappreciate the work carried out in this field, including \r\nthe development of guidance to address care for \r\nseafarers who have suffered from attacks and capture \r\nby pirates. We urge f lag States and ship owners to do \r\ntheir utmost in ensuring the security of crew members.\r\nOur highest appreciation goes to the Division for \r\nOcean Affairs and the Law of the Sea for providing us \r\nexcellent conference services and support throughout \r\nthe year. We are also profoundly grateful to the \r\ncoordinators of both draft resolutions for their valuable \r\nstewardship during the negotiations. \r\nMr. Neo (Singapore): My delegation is privileged \r\nto address the General Assembly under agenda item 75, \r\n“Oceans and the law of the sea”. We thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his comprehensive reports on oceans and \r\nthe law of the sea (A/67/79) and on sustainable fisheries \r\n(A/67/315). We also thank the coordinators of draft \r\nresolutions A/67/L.21 and A/67/L.22, Ambassador \r\nEden Charles of Trinidad and Tobago and Ms. Alice \r\nRevell of New Zealand, for their able stewardship of the \r\nconsultations. We also express our appreciation to the \r\nstaff of the Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of \r\nthe Sea for their support on these drafts.\r\nYesterday, the General Assembly commemorated \r\nthe thirtieth anniversary of the signing of the United \r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). \r\nSingapore is grateful that our own Ambassador Tommy \r\nKoh was given the honour of presiding over the Third \r\nUnited Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, \r\nwhich gave birth to that constitution of the oceans, \r\nwhich has stood for three decades.\r\nIn many ways, UNCLOS created a new global \r\norder. It struck a balance between increasing the \r\njurisdictional claims of coastal States over adjacent \r\nstood the test of time. Moreover, that monumental \r\nachievement of the international community is about \r\nto achieve universality, with 164 States parties as of \r\ntoday. I would like to reiterate my country’s strongest \r\ncommitment to the Convention as a comprehensive \r\nlegal framework covering all aspects of the activities \r\nrelated to oceans and seas.\r\nI now turn to the draft resolutions before us \r\ntoday. Ukraine is grateful to all delegations for their \r\ncooperation during the consultations. We appreciate \r\nthe fact that this year’s omnibus draft resolution on \r\noceans and the law of the sea (A/67/L.21) highlights the \r\nimportance of keeping up efforts aimed at providing \r\nsafety and security in international maritime shipping. \r\nOne of the major challenges in this field is piracy \r\nand armed robbery at sea. Although considerable gains \r\nhave been made thus far in combating this threat, a \r\nlot of work is still ahead of us. Noting that the current \r\ndeclining trend in the number of attacks is reversible \r\nand predominantly dependent on the international \r\nnaval patrol, my country has decided to make its own \r\ncontribution in this regard. The decision has been \r\ntaken by the Government of Ukraine to send the frigate \r\nHetman Sahaidachny, a f lagship of the Ukrainian Naval \r\nForces, to the waters off the Horn of Africa as a part of \r\nNATO Operation Ocean Shield. The frigate, equipped \r\nwith a deck helicopter, is currently undergoing final \r\npreparations to head for the waters off the Somali coast.\r\nThe fight again piracy cannot be successful without \r\nthe fight against impunity for its perpetrators and \r\norganizers. In this respect, Ukraine welcomes the fact \r\nthat this year’s draft resolution once again encourages \r\nMember States to make efforts to bring pirates and \r\ntheir sponsors to justice. Current statistics in this \r\nrespect are very encouraging; 1,186 individuals are \r\nbeing prosecuted or awaiting prosecution in 21 States. \r\nBuilding on this initial success will not be possible \r\nwithout a sufficient legal basis for the apprehension and \r\nprosecution of those who are alleged to have committed \r\nthose crimes. International law, as reflected in the \r\nConvention, enables us to apprehend and prosecute \r\npirates. The key role in this process is played by our \r\nnational legislation. \r\nIn this regard, my delegation is very pleased \r\nthat, upon its proposal, the omnibus draft resolution \r\ncalls upon States to actively cooperate with a view to \r\ndeveloping their national anti-piracy legislation. Our \r\nnational legal tools have to correspond to the current \r\nchallenges and threats to maritime safety and security, \r\n12-64324 15\r\nA/67/PV.52\r\nthe balance of uses in the oceans and seas, but also the \r\npeaceful order that we have enjoyed therein. We must \r\nresist the temptation to put undue emphasis on certain \r\naspects of the Convention that may be of keen national \r\ninterest at a particular point of time, and risk reading \r\ninto the Convention interpretations that the drafters \r\nnever intended.\r\nWe must therefore remind ourselves that UNCLOS \r\nwas drafted as a package, and no selectivity should be \r\nexercised in its application. It is critical to maintain the \r\nindivisibility of the Convention, which is the sole and \r\noverarching legal framework for the oceans and seas. \r\nSome of the new challenges we face are explicitly dealt \r\nwith in the Convention’s text; others are not. But it is \r\nmy delegation’s firm view that the Convention contains \r\nboth the core set of principles that should be applied \r\nand the necessary scope for us to successfully address \r\nall emerging issues relating to the oceans and seas.\r\nThe international community reached an important \r\nand significant milestone on sustainable development \r\nin June this year in Rio de Janeiro. Our leaders agreed \r\nto the outcome document of the United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development (resolution \r\n66/288, annex), which built on the Rio Declaration on \r\nEnvironment and Development and on Agenda 21. Our \r\nleaders committed to addressing, on an urgent basis, \r\nthe issue of the conservation and sustainable use of \r\nmarine biological diversity beyond areas of national \r\njurisdiction, including by taking a decision on the \r\ndevelopment of an international instrument under the \r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. \r\nOur leaders also urged all parties to UNCLOS \r\nto fully implement their obligations under the \r\nConvention, recognizing that we should be careful not \r\nto undermine freedom of navigation and other equally \r\nimportant interests. It bears repeating that the careful \r\ncompromises embodied in UNCLOS have served us \r\nwell. As the international community charts the future \r\nof our oceans, it is imperative that we do so without \r\nundermining the integrity of the Convention.\r\nMrs. Mørch Smith (Norway): The United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) sets \r\nforth the legal order for the world’s seas and oceans. It \r\nprovides a solid foundation for the peaceful, responsible \r\nand predictable management of the oceans. The peaceful \r\nand sustainable use of the oceans and sound fisheries \r\nmanagement remain key priorities for Norway.\r\nsea areas and preserving the important rights of the \r\ninternational community in areas claimed by coastal \r\nStates, including the freedom of navigation. UNCLOS \r\nalso entrenched the concept of the common heritage \r\nof humankind in international law, which safeguarded \r\nthe collective rights of nations over parts of the oceans \r\nthat were beyond claims that coastal States could \r\nlegitimately make. Just as importantly, UNCLOS \r\nestablished a comprehensive set of dispute-settlement \r\nmechanisms that enabled States to resolve their \r\ndifferences peacefully through bilateral negotiations, \r\narbitration or third-party adjudication. That has \r\nhelped to maintain peace, order and discipline in the \r\ngovernance of our oceans.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the two new ratifications \r\nof the Convention during the period under review, \r\nbringing the total number of parties to 164. For the \r\nmost part, the Convention already reflects customary \r\ninternational law. However, we encourage the \r\nminority of non-party member States to give serious \r\nconsideration to accession so that the Convention will \r\nachieve universal membership.\r\nSingapore is committed to the full and complete \r\nimplementation of the law of the sea. We are a small \r\nisland nation strategically located at the junction of the \r\nStraits of Malacca and Singapore and the South China \r\nSea, the gateway between the Indian and Pacific Oceans. \r\nWe are also one of the three littoral States bordering the \r\nStraits of Malacca and Singapore. As our total trade \r\nis three times our gross domestic product, freedom of \r\nnavigation is of critical importance to Singapore. \r\nToday, 90 per cent of global trade is carried by sea. \r\nAbout half of that passes through the Straits of Malacca \r\nand Singapore. It is therefore in the interest of all States \r\nto continue to preserve the freedom of navigation and \r\npassage rights through these and other waters, and \r\neven more so in these uncertain economic times, as the \r\nfreedom of navigation has a direct and tangible impact \r\non global trade.\r\nNew possibilities and challenges have emerged \r\nsince the adoption of UNCLOS 30 years ago. New \r\ntechnologies have made possible the exploration and \r\nexploitation of resources in areas beyond national \r\njurisdiction. At the same time, increasing coastal \r\npopulations have put pressure on coastal and marine \r\necosystems. Some of these challenges may prompt fresh \r\ndebate over the sufficiency or proper application of \r\nUNCLOS. The international community has to respond \r\nto these challenges in a way that maintains not only \r\n16 12-64324\r\nA/67/PV.52\r\nAnother Norwegian priority is global food \r\nsecurity. Oceans are critical to global food security, \r\nand sustainable and responsible marine management \r\nis of vital importance if the oceans are to continue to \r\nbe a source of human food. Norway supports measures \r\nto strengthen sustainable fisheries management and \r\nactions to protect vulnerable marine ecosystems from \r\ndestructive fishing practices. The regional fisheries \r\nmanagement organizations play a key role in that \r\ncontext. \r\nWe welcome the adoption of the outcome document \r\nof the United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 66/288, annex) earlier this \r\nyear, which stressed the crucial role of healthy marine \r\necosystems, sustainable fisheries and sustainable \r\naquaculture for food security and nutrition and in \r\nproviding for the livelihoods of millions of people. The \r\nGeneral Assembly emphasizes those important issues \r\nin this year’s draft resolution on sustainable fisheries \r\n(A/67/L.22) and encourages the Food and Agriculture \r\nOrganization of the United Nations to give due priority \r\nto those issues in its future work. \r\nOver the past few years, we have become concerned \r\nabout the connections between international organized \r\ncrime and fisheries crime. We support the ongoing \r\nwork of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime \r\nand INTERPOL, and welcome the fact that there is \r\ngreater awareness of those links in General Assembly \r\ndiscussions.\r\nIt is essential to protect biological diversity in order \r\nto maintain the living networks and systems that are \r\nthe basis of our existence. There is an urgent need to \r\nimplement effective measures to combat threats to \r\nmarine biodiversity. It is important to underline that \r\nthis also applies to areas under national jurisdiction and \r\nthat every coastal State is responsible for implementing \r\neffective measures. \r\nWe welcome the work of the Ad Hoc Open-ended \r\nInformal Working Group to study issues relating to the \r\nconservation and sustainable use of marine biological \r\ndiversity beyond areas of national jurisdiction. We \r\nsupport and remain committed to the decision taken in \r\nRio earlier this year to address on an urgent basis the \r\nissue of the conservation and sustainable use of marine \r\nbiodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction. It \r\nis important that all negative impacts on biodiversity \r\nbe examined. Furthermore, possible gaps in the legal \r\nframework and in the implementation of existing \r\ninstruments should be identified, and a decision should \r\nbe taken on the possible development of an international \r\ninstrument under the United Nations Convention on the \r\nLaw of the Sea. We welcome the opportunity to address \r\nthose issues further at the inter-sessional workshops in \r\nMay 2013 and at the meeting of the Ad Hoc Open-ended \r\nInformal Working Group in August 2013.\r\nNorway firmly believes that regional organizations \r\nplay a crucial part in protecting marine biodiversity in \r\nareas beyond national jurisdiction. Impacts on marine \r\nbiodiversity may differ from region to region; different \r\nchallenges require different solutions. Priority should \r\nbe given to improving the effectiveness of regional \r\nmanagement bodies.\r\nNorway is concerned about the impact on the marine \r\nenvironment of increased concentrations of greenhouse \r\ngases in the atmosphere. We know that elevated levels \r\nof anthropogenic carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are \r\nrapidly changing ocean chemistry, leading to ocean \r\nacidification. This may have dramatic consequences \r\nfor the marine environment and ecosystems. There \r\nis a need for a fuller understanding of the effects of \r\nocean acidification on marine organisms. The outcome \r\ndocument of the United Nations Conference on \r\nSustainable Development calls for support for initiatives \r\nthat address that issue. Norway therefore supports the \r\nproposal for the United Nations Open-ended Informal \r\nConsultative Process to focus on ocean acidification \r\nduring discussions at its fourteenth meeting.\r\nMr. Sharma (India): At the outset, I wish to take \r\nthis opportunity to thank the President for convening \r\nthis meeting to consider agenda item 75, “Oceans and \r\nthe law of the sea”, which holds great significance for \r\nthe international community as a whole.\r\nThis year, the subject of oceans occupies a special \r\nplace as the United Nations commemorates the \r\nthirtieth anniversary of the opening for signature of the \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea. I congratulate the \r\ninternational community on this occasion.\r\nOceans play a vital role in supporting life on \r\nEarth. The outcome document of the United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development held in Rio de \r\nJaneiro, Brazil, in June, entitled “The future we want” \r\n(resolution 66/288, annex), recognized oceans and seas \r\nas integrated and essential components of the Earth’s \r\necosystem that are critical to sustaining it. That will be \r\npossible, however, only through the proper management \r\nand use of ocean resources and the preservation and \r\n12-64324 17\r\nA/67/PV.52\r\nprotection of the marine environment. The oceans \r\nare facing a number of challenges that include illegal, \r\nunreported and unregulated fishing, the deterioration \r\nof the marine environment, biodiversity loss, climate \r\nchange, and problems related to maritime safety and \r\nsecurity, including acts of piracy.\r\nWe would like to express our serious concern over \r\npiracy and armed robbery at sea, particularly off the \r\ncoast of Somalia. Piracy is a grave threat to freedom of \r\nthe seas, maritime trade and the security of maritime \r\nshipping. It endangers the lives of seafarers, affects \r\nnational security and territorial integrity, and hampers \r\nthe economic development of nations. India is actively \r\ncooperating with international efforts to combat \r\npiracy and armed robbery at sea. We support the joint \r\nand concerted efforts of the international community \r\nto tackle that menace. In that regard, we express our \r\ndeep appreciation to the Contact Group on Piracy off \r\nthe Coast of Somalia which, since its establishment \r\nin January 2009, has served as an excellent forum for \r\ninternational cooperation and coordination in the fight \r\nagainst piracy off the coast of Somalia.\r\nThe 1982 United Nations Law of the Sea Convention \r\nis the key international instrument governing ocean \r\naffairs. It sets out the legal framework for activities \r\nin oceans and seas and is of strategic importance as \r\nthe basis for national, regional and global action in the \r\nmarine sector. With 164 parties, the Convention enjoys \r\nnear-universal acceptance. Swaziland and Ecuador \r\nbecame the latest States to accede after joining the \r\nConvention on 24 September.\r\nWe thank the Secretary-General for his report \r\n(A/67/79) and its two addenda on issues concerning \r\noceans and the law of the sea. We also welcome the \r\nreport (A/67/120) of the co-Chairs of the thirteenth \r\nmeeting of the United Nations Open-ended Informal \r\nConsultative Process on Oceans and the Law of the Sea, \r\nduring which deliberations were held on the topic of \r\nmarine renewable energies. \r\nThe oceans have significant potential for \r\ncontributing to meeting energy needs, improving \r\neconomic well-being and reducing greenhouse-gas \r\nemissions. However, while marine renewable energies \r\noffer opportunities, they also pose environmental \r\nand economic challenges, especially to developing \r\ncountries, including in the areas of the conduct of \r\nscientific research and acquisition of technological \r\nknowledge, which can be successful only with effective \r\ninternational cooperation and coordination.\r\nWe welcome the report on the work of the Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group of the Whole on the Regular Process \r\nfor Global Reporting and Assessment of the State of \r\nthe Marine Environment, including Socioeconomic \r\nAspects (A/67/87). We commend the Working Group’s \r\nefforts towards producing the first global integrated \r\nassessment of the state of the marine environment and \r\nlook forward to its completion by 2014. We also welcome \r\nthe report of the work of the Ad Hoc Open-ended \r\nInformal Working Group to study issues relating to the \r\nconservation and sustainable use of marine biological \r\ndiversity beyond areas of national jurisdiction and \r\nco-Chairs’ summary of discussions (A/67/95, annex). \r\nThe meetings have revealed a number of gaps in the \r\nregulation, implementation, governance, coordination \r\nand information-sharing in the current regime for the \r\nconservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity \r\nin areas beyond national jurisdiction. We are confident \r\nthat the Informal Working Group’s efforts will help to \r\nfind ways and means for filling those gaps, including \r\nthrough developing a legal framework.\r\nThe effective and unhindered functioning \r\nof the institutions established under the \r\nConvention — the International Seabed Authority, the \r\nInternational Tribunal for the Law of the Sea and the \r\nCommission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf — is \r\nkey to achieving the goal of the fair and equitable use \r\nof oceans and their resources, including through the \r\neffective implementation of the provisions of the \r\nConvention. We note with satisfaction the progress \r\nmade by those institutions in their respective areas, \r\nand support all efforts towards ensuring their smooth \r\nfunctioning. While we are fully aware of, and concerned \r\nabout, the heavy workload of the Commission on the \r\nLimits of the Continental Shelf due to the great number \r\nof claims submitted, we are hopeful that increasing the \r\nnunmber of the Commission’s work weeks will help it \r\nto manage.\r\nIn addition to the initiatives and processes that \r\nexist under the Convention on the Law of the Sea \r\nfor the implementation of its provisions, and the \r\nstudies being undertaken in various working groups \r\nmandated by the General Assembly, this year we have \r\nalso noted the launch of the Secretary-General’s new \r\n“Oceans Compact — Healthy Oceans for Prosperity”. \r\nIt is important that the initiative’s requirements and \r\nobjectives be established through open and regular \r\nconsultation with Member States. We would also like \r\n18 12-64324\r\nA/67/PV.52\r\nAt the outset, my delegation would like to express its \r\nsincere gratitude to the Division of Oceans and the Law \r\nof the Sea for its important work and unwavering support \r\nin facilitating the work of the informal negotiations. \r\nWe are also grateful for the Secretary-General’s \r\ncomprehensive annual reports on oceans and the law \r\nof the sea (A/67/79, A/67/79/Corr.1, A/67/79/Add.1 and \r\nA/67/79/Add.2). We give special thanks to the two \r\ncoordinators, Ambassador Eden Charles of Trinidad \r\nand Tobago and Ms. Alice Revell of New Zealand, for \r\nconducting the informal consultations on the two draft \r\nresolutions before us (A/67/L.21 and A/67/L.22). My \r\ndelegation is a proud sponsor of them.\r\nThis year marks the thirtieth anniversary of the \r\nopening for signature of the Convention on the Law \r\nof the Sea (UNCLOS). It remains as valid today as it \r\nwas 30 years ago. Indeed, we have much to celebrate \r\nin having achieved substantial progress in the areas \r\nof oceans and the law of the sea. We can rightly use \r\nthis occasion to honour those individuals and parties \r\nwho had the wisdom and foresight to get nations to \r\ncommit to what is now known as the “constitution for \r\nthe oceans”.\r\nMicronesia is part of a blue continent. The oceans \r\nbring us together and sustain us, and their resources \r\nenrich us. They are part of our homeland, and our \r\npeople’s livelihood, culture and way of living depend \r\non a blue economy. \r\nOf increasing and serious concern is the health of \r\nthe oceans. Pollution and the transboundary movement \r\nof hazardous waste negatively impact our oceans. The \r\nadverse impacts of climate change, including rising water \r\ntemperature, influence the movement of our fish stocks \r\nfrom our waters, and ocean acidification is eroding our \r\ncoral reefs. Destructive fishing methods — including \r\noverfishing and illegal, unreported and unregulated \r\nfishing — require States to cooperate in taking greater \r\nenforcement measures. \r\nWe must therefore treat our oceans accordingly \r\nand defend them just as strongly. In that regard, \r\nmy delegation urges all Member States to fulfil the \r\ncommitments they made in June in Rio. The United \r\nNations Conference on Sustainable Development \r\n(Rio+20) affirmed the important role the Convention \r\non the Law of the Sea plays in achieving sustainable \r\ndevelopment. We welcome the new elements in this \r\nyear’s draft resolutions, which ensure the conservation \r\nand sustainable use of the oceans and their resources.\r\nto stress that any duplication of the work of ongoing \r\ninitiatives and processes should be avoided.\r\nI would like to thank Ambassador Eden Charles, \r\nthe Deputy Permanent Representative of Trinidad and \r\nTobago, who has very ably coordinated this year’s \r\nconsultations for the draft omnibus resolution on \r\noceans and the law of the sea (A/67/L.21). It addresses \r\na wide range of issues, including those concerning \r\nthe implementation of the Convention and related \r\nagreements, capacity-building, maritime safety \r\nand security, marine scientific research, the marine \r\nenvironment and marine resources.\r\nWe would also like to thank Ms. Alice Revell \r\nof New Zealand for successfully coordinating the \r\nconsultations on the draft resolution on sustainable \r\nfisheries (A/67/L.22). The fishery sector occupies an \r\nimportant place in the socioeconomic development \r\nof a great number of countries, including India. We \r\nsupport the international community’s concerted \r\nefforts towards achieving sustainable fisheries by, inter \r\nalia, adopting measures to prevent and combat illegal, \r\nunreported and unregulated fishing by effectively \r\nimplementing the 1995 Fish Stocks Agreement and \r\nthe relevant instruments at the regional level, and by \r\npreventing overfishing. We consider the role of the Food \r\nand Agriculture Organization of the United Nations \r\nto be crucial in conserving fishery resources and the \r\nmanagement and development of fisheries.\r\nOur thanks also go to the whole staff of the Division \r\nfor Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea, particularly \r\nits Director, Mr. Tarasenko, for all its arrangements for \r\nthe meetings and its constructive cooperation.\r\nIndia, given its geography as a country, with a vast \r\ncoastline and numerous islands, has a traditional and \r\nabiding interest in maritime and ocean affairs. It is a \r\nparty to the Convention, the Implementing Agreement, \r\nand the Fish Stocks Agreement. We take a keen interest \r\nin all matters pertaining to ocean affairs and believe \r\nit is in the interests of the international community \r\nas a whole to continue to cooperate fully in the \r\nefforts towards ensuring the proper management and \r\nsustainable use of the oceans and seas.\r\nMrs. Chigiyal (Micronesia): The Federated States \r\nof Micronesia aligns itself with the statement delivered \r\nby the representative of Samoa on behalf of the Pacific \r\nsmall island developing States (SIDS), as well as the \r\nstatement delivered by the representative of Palau on \r\nbehalf of the Pacific Island Forum countries.\r\n12-64324 19\r\nA/67/PV.52\r\nLaw of the Sea for its continued support and dedicated \r\nwork on oceans issues.\r\nThe Maldives would first like to begin by taking \r\nnote of this year’s debate on this agenda item, which \r\ncoincides with the thirtieth anniversary of the opening \r\nfor signature of the United Nations Convention on the \r\nLaw of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the twentieth anniversary \r\nof the United Nations Conference on Environment and \r\nDevelopment. These two anniversaries remind us of the \r\nimportance of emphasizing the linkage between those \r\ntwo fields, as well as the need to stress the importance \r\nof conservation and the sustainable use of the oceans.\r\nThe Maldives, like many other small island \r\ndeveloping States, is a coastal State whose economy \r\ndepends on its marine resources. Given that tourism and \r\nfisheries remain our two biggest industries, preserving \r\nour oceans constitutes the basis for our country’s \r\neconomic, social and environmental development. We \r\nare pleased that the section on the oceans and seas of \r\nthe outcome document (resolution 66/288, annex) of the \r\nUnited Nations Conference on Sustainable Development \r\n(Rio+20) took note of the importance of oceans and the \r\nlegal framework provided by UNCLOS. The provisions \r\non sustainable tourism and the protection of coral reefs \r\nare particularly welcome, as the Maldives continues \r\nto fight the effects of anthropogenic climate change, \r\nwhich include sea-level rise, coastal erosion, ocean \r\nacidification and coral bleaching. We remain deeply \r\nconcerned about overfishing; illegal, unreported and \r\nunregulated fishing; discards, by-catch and perverse \r\nGovernment subsidies; ineffective fisheries governance; \r\novercapacity and biodiversity loss.\r\nThe Maldives welcomes the Secretary-General’s \r\nocean initiative, launched on 12 August in the \r\nRepublic of Korea, to deliver oceans-related mandates \r\nconsistent with Rio’s outcome document in a more \r\ncoherent and effective manner. We hope that this \r\ninitiative will create a platform for all stakeholders at \r\nthe national and international levels to collaborate and \r\naccelerate progress in the achievement of our common \r\ngoals. Preserving the oceans through protection and \r\nsustainable use is vital to the well-being of our future \r\ngenerations.\r\nThe Maldives is deeply concerned that current \r\ninternational efforts are not enough to meet the target \r\nof restoring fish stocks to their maximum sustainable \r\nyields by 2015, including the reversal of biodiversity \r\nloss in the oceans and the elimination of destructive \r\nfishing practices decided in the World Summit on \r\nMy delegation joins many others in repeating \r\nthe call made at Rio+20 to address issues relating \r\nto biological diversity in areas beyond national \r\njurisdiction, which need to be addressed through an \r\nimplementing agreement under UNCLOS as soon as \r\npossible. We are convinced that this will provide legal \r\ncertainty in the conservation and sustainable use of \r\nmarine biodiversity in the high seas, thereby earning \r\nlegitimacy and credibility.\r\nGiven the vulnerability and limited capacity \r\nof Micronesia as a small island developing State, \r\nwe particularly welcome the references in the draft \r\nresolutions stressing the need to identify and mainstream \r\nstrategies by 2014 that assist SIDS in developing their \r\ncapacity to conserve, sustainably manage and realize \r\nthe benefits of sustainable fisheries. The invitation \r\nto States and international financial institutions to \r\ndevelop special financial mechanisms or instruments \r\nto assist SIDS in developing their national capacity to \r\nexploit fisheries resources must also be recognized and \r\ncommended.\r\nIn our part of the Pacific, we have taken the lead \r\nin preserving healthy fish stocks and protecting our \r\nenvironment. We have created innovative tools to \r\nkeep our stocks at a level producing at least maximum \r\nsustainable yield based on the best available science. \r\nWe encourage our partners to join us in that endeavour. \r\nThe parties to the Nauru Agreement are taking that \r\nresponsible approach, and we encourage other regions \r\nof the world to follow suit.\r\nIn 2014, the Third International Conference on \r\nSIDS will be held in our Pacific island neighbour, the \r\nIndependent State of Samoa. Micronesia looks forward \r\nto discussions on how to further address the challenges \r\nfaced by small island developing States, including in \r\nthe area of conservation and sustainable use of ocean \r\nresources.\r\nIn conclusion, I want to emphasize that we are \r\nall responsible for the future health of our oceans. \r\nEngaging actively in the sustainable use, management \r\nand conservation of the world’s oceans is not just a \r\npractical, but also a moral obligation that we all need \r\nto fulfil. \r\nMr. Shihab (Maldives): I am delighted to be \r\nmaking this statement today on behalf of the delegation \r\nof Maldives under agenda item 75, “Oceans and the law \r\nof the sea”. At the outset, I would like to express our \r\nappreciation to the Division for Ocean Affairs and the \r\n20 12-64324\r\nA/67/PV.52\r\nour urgent call for assistance in the development of \r\nmarine renewable energy.\r\nIn conclusion, the protection and sustainable use of \r\nmarine resources for SIDS like the Maldives represent \r\na key part of our sustainable development. It is by now \r\na well-recognized fact that oceans play a part in the \r\neconomy of every State across the globe. It is therefore \r\ninexcusable for any State to ignore its duty to ensure \r\nthe protection of these resources and their sustainable \r\nuse for the benefit of our future generations.\r\nMs. Flores (Honduras) (spoke in Spanish): We are \r\nextremely pleased to participate in this important debate \r\ndevoted to oceans and the law of the sea, especially \r\nas we consider the adoption of two important draft \r\nresolutions on the subject (A/67/L.21 and A/67/L.22). \r\nMy delegation also wishes to express its satisfaction \r\nwith regard to the ceremony that took place yesterday to \r\ncommemorate the thirtieth anniversary of the opening \r\nfor signature of the United Nations Convention on the \r\nLaw of the Sea, of which we are a party. We underscore \r\nimportance of the Agreement for the Implementation \r\nof the Provisions of the United Nations Convention on \r\nthe Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to \r\nthe Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish \r\nStocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks, which since \r\n1995 has maintained the regime for their conservation \r\nand sustainable development.\r\nHonduras confirms its support for the draft \r\nresolutions to be adopted today. In that regard, and \r\nwishing to contribute to the conservation of our species, \r\nwe recall that in 2011 we declared our national waters \r\nto be a sanctuary for the protection of the shark species. \r\nWith regard to the United Nations Convention on \r\nthe Law of the Sea, with its 164 States parties and a \r\nconstantly developing normative system, we highlight \r\nthat its provisions are implemented with the assistance \r\nof several organs, including the International Seabed \r\nAuthority, which allows States parties to organize and \r\ncontrol activities related to the mineral resources of \r\nthe international seabed; the International Tribunal \r\nfor the Law of the Sea in Hamburg, which resolves \r\ndisputes over the interpretation or implementation of \r\nthe Convention; and the Commission on the Limits of \r\nthe Continental Shelf, which contributes to establishing \r\nthe outer limits of the continental shelf where that part \r\nof the submerged land of the territory of a coastal State \r\nextends to 200 nautical miles from its coastline. The \r\nConvention, known as the constitution of the oceans, \r\nSustainable Development. The world has missed the \r\n2010 target to achieve a significant reduction of the \r\ncurrent rate of biodiversity loss at the global, regional \r\nand national levels. Current trends show that the loss of \r\nspecies will continue throughout this century, with an \r\nincreasing risk of dramatic shifts in ecosystems. The \r\nMaldives therefore calls upon all Member States to \r\nrenew their political commitment to finding an urgent \r\nsolution to biodiversity loss.\r\nIn that regard, Maldives declared Baa Atoll a \r\nUNESCO biosphere reserve on 28 June 2011. The \r\ndesignation of Baa Atoll as a biosphere reserve signals \r\nthe commitment of the people to managing it sustainably \r\nby achieving the three functions of the biosphere \r\nreserve: conservation, sustainable development and \r\nlearning. In addition, President Waheed announced at \r\nRio+20 that we will make the whole of the Maldives a \r\nbiosphere reserve by 2017. The initial work needed to \r\nachieve that ambitious goal is ongoing.\r\nThe Maldives believes that there is a need for \r\nfurther commitment on the part of States to enforcing \r\nregional agreements on the management of ocean \r\nresources. This could provide capacity to regional \r\nfisheries management organizations and make them \r\nbetter equipped to ensure the sustainable management \r\nof our oceans. Given the strategies contained in the \r\nOceans Compact, we are keen to see results that display \r\nan increase in the sustainable management of ocean \r\nresources and a general improvement in the health of \r\nour oceans.\r\nWe take note of the Secretary-General’s report, \r\ncontained in document A/67/79, focusing on the \r\nimportance of marine renewable energy. The report \r\nstresses the fact that small island developing States \r\n(SIDS) are well placed to benefit from ocean thermal \r\nenergy conversion and focuses on the fact that there \r\nhas been a requirement for the development of marine \r\nrenewable energy since the United Nations Conference \r\non Environment and Development, held in Rio in 1992. \r\nThe call for the development of renewable energy \r\nalternatives is, indeed, a viable option to escape climate \r\nchange and rising oil prices and answers increasing \r\nenergy demands. Unfortunately, SIDS like the Maldives \r\ndo not have sufficient resources to ensure a complete \r\ntransition to a green economy and therefore remain \r\nin dire need of outside investment to develop those \r\nrenewable energy options, which  could sustain the \r\ngreening of our economy. For this reason, we reiterate \r\n12-64324 21\r\nA/67/PV.52\r\nshall be informed that all matters relating to the \r\nGulf of Fonseca shall be addressed by the trinational \r\ncommission. The declaration was signed by the heads \r\nof State of Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua.\r\nOne of the major challenges we face in the twenty-\r\nfirst century is protecting the oceans, which are a source \r\nof life. Climate change, pollution, destructive fishing \r\npractices, ocean acidification and the extraction of \r\nmarine species, which cause biodiversity loss and hurt \r\nthe ecosystem, all affect the survival and the well-being \r\nof our planet. A world that wishes to live in harmony \r\nmust pool its efforts and coordinate its political will \r\nin order to guarantee that its resources will be used \r\nin the framework of sustainable and balanced ocean \r\ndevelopment that, in meeting present and future needs, \r\nhusbands the wealth of the sea as a legacy of future \r\ngenerations.\r\nThe Acting President: In accordance with \r\nresolution 51/6 of 24 October 1996, I now call on \r\nthe Secretary-General of the International Seabed \r\nAuthority.\r\nMr. Odunton (International Seabed Authority): \r\nAllow me first of all to congratulate Mr. Vuk Jeremić \r\non his election to the presidency of the sixty-seventh \r\nsession of the General Assembly. I have every \r\nconfidence in his ability to guide the Assembly to its \r\nsuccessful conclusion. \r\nI wish to refer to the two draft resolutions before \r\nthe General Assembly (A/66/L.21 and A/66/L.22) and \r\nexpress my appreciation to Member States for their \r\nreferences to the work of the International Seabed \r\nAuthority contained in draft resolution A/67/L.21, \r\nespecially under part VI, which is entitled “The Area”. \r\nI also express appreciation for the very comprehensive \r\nreport of the Secretary-General (A/67/79), which as \r\nalways provides detailed background material for our \r\nconsideration. I wish to commend the Division for \r\nOcean Affairs and the Law of the Sea for its continued \r\noutstanding efforts in the preparation of this report \r\nover the years. \r\nDraft resolution A/67/L.21 welcomes two major \r\nachievements of the Authority during 2012. The first \r\nis the adoption by the Council at the eighteenth session \r\nof the Authority of the regulations for prospecting \r\nand exploration for cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts \r\nin the Area. I am pleased to say that after many years \r\nof debate and negotiation, those regulations were \r\nadopted by consensus. The adoption of the regulations \r\nestablishes the seabed and the ocean f loor as the \r\ncommon heritage of mankind. \r\nIn thanking the Secretary-General for his reports \r\non these issues (A/67/79 and A/67/315), I wish to \r\nrecall his important message during the first official \r\ncelebration of World Oceans Day, on 8 June 2009. “Our \r\noceans, our responsibility” emphasizes our individual \r\nand collective duty to protect the marine environment \r\nand carefully manage its resources. Safe, healthy and \r\nproductive seas and oceans are integral to human well-\r\nbeing, economic security and sustainable development. \r\nIn that connection, the world’s peace and security \r\namong nations and, of course, among coastal States \r\nare vital to the social and economic development of our \r\npeoples. Everything that contributes to the development \r\nand promotion of trust among neighbouring countries \r\nand peoples undoubtedly contributes to maintaining \r\nthe peace that we so desire. For us, as founding States \r\nMembers of the United Nations, the full implementation \r\nof the international legal norms on oceans is reflected \r\nin the judgments of the International Court of Justice. \r\nWe peace-loving States turn unreservedly to those \r\ninternational courts to resolve our differences. \r\nRespectful of their binding decisions, we accept them \r\nwithout hesitation.\r\nI am pleased to inform the Assembly that at the \r\nManagua summit on 4 December, following a regional \r\npresidential meeting among the three States that have \r\na shared interest in the Gulf of Fonseca — Honduras, \r\nEl Salvador and Nicaragua — we agreed to establish \r\na trilateral commission for the purpose of maintaining \r\nthe Gulf of Fonseca as a zone of peace, sustainable \r\ndevelopment and security. The commission will be \r\ntasked with the following functions: reviewing the \r\nstatus of implementation of the 1992 Judgment of \r\nthe International Court of Justice in the case of El \r\nSalvador v. Honduras; updating and implementation of \r\nthe protocol on the role of naval forces in the Gulf of \r\nFonseca, in order to guarantee peace and tranquillity \r\nin that zone; and accelerating the execution of the \r\nintegral development strategy for the Gulf of Fonseca, \r\npresenting a portfolio of projects in the areas of \r\nsustainable economic development, environment and \r\nsecurity, with the aim of mobilizing the resources \r\nnecessary for their implementation. The Ministries of \r\nForeign Affairs of the respective countries shall preside \r\nover the trinational commission and shall jointly agree \r\non the composition of its working groups and present a \r\npreliminary report to the Presidents within 90 days. The \r\nthree States declared that the international community \r\n22 12-64324\r\nA/67/PV.52\r\nsign a 15-year exploration contract for polymetallic \r\nsulfides exploration in the Area with the Ministry \r\nof Natural Resources and the Environment of the \r\nRussian Federation. I wish to take this opportunity \r\nto congratulate the Government and the people of the \r\nRussian Federation on that important achievement.\r\nWith the increased pace of activity in the Area, \r\nmuch work lies ahead for the Authority in order for \r\nit to succeed in its task of managing the resources of \r\nthe Area for the benefit of humankind as a whole. That \r\nincludes the task of developing fair and reasonable \r\nfinancial terms for the future exploitation of minerals. \r\nIt is thus more important than ever that all States \r\nparties attend the annual meetings of the Assembly and \r\nCouncil and participate fully in all aspects of the work \r\nof the Authority. I therefore look forward to the widest \r\npossible participation by all members in the nineteenth \r\nsession of the Authority in July 2013.\r\nThe Acting President: In accordance with General \r\nAssembly resolution 54/195, of 17 December 1999, I \r\nnow call on the observer for the International Union for \r\nConservation of Nature. \r\nMr. Cohen (International Union for the \r\nConservation of Nature): The International Union for \r\nConservation of Nature (IUCN) welcomes the draft \r\nresolutions put forward for the General Assembly’s \r\nconsideration this year (A/67/L.21 and A/67/L.22). \r\nWe were encouraged that Heads of State and \r\nGovernment and high-level representatives, meeting \r\nin Rio de Janeiro from 20 to 22 June, with the full \r\nparticipation of civil society, renewed a global \r\ncommitment to sustainable development and to \r\nensuring the promotion of an economically, socially \r\nand environmentally sustainable future for the planet \r\nand for present and future generations. The outcome \r\ndocument, entitled “The future we want”, adopted \r\nby the heads of State and Government and high-level \r\nrepresentatives in Rio and subsequently endorsed \r\nby the General Assembly through resolution 66/288, \r\nincludes many important paragraphs with respect to \r\nthe world’s oceans. It notes that oceans and coastal \r\nareas form an integrated and essential component of \r\nthe Earth’s ecosystem. Also noted is the need to ensure \r\nthe conservation and sustainable use of the oceans and \r\nseas and of their resources for sustainable development, \r\nincluding through their contributions to poverty \r\neradication, sustained economic growth, food security \r\nand creation of sustainable livelihoods and decent work, \r\nwhile at the same time protecting biodiversity and the \r\ncompletes the Authority’s regulatory code governing \r\nprospecting and exploration for the three main types \r\nof mineral resources found in the Area. I believe that it \r\nis a significant achievement. Since the adoption of the \r\nregulations, two applications for exploration for cobalt-\r\nrich ferromanganese crusts have already been filed. \r\nThey will be considered by the Legal and Technical \r\nCommission at its meeting in February 2013 and \r\nsubsequently by the Council at its nineteenth session \r\nin July 2013.\r\nThe second major achievement, also referred to in \r\nparagraph 48 of the draft resolution, was the decision by \r\nthe Council of the Authority to recognize the designation \r\nof nine representative areas in the nodule-bearing \r\nprovince of the Pacific Ocean, covering 1.6 million \r\nsquare miles as areas of particular environmental \r\ninterest where no activity should take place.\r\nThe draft resolution also refers to the rapid \r\nincrease in exploration activity that has taken place \r\nin the past two years. In 2012, five new applications \r\nfor exploration contracts were approved by the \r\nCouncil of the Authority, bringing the total number \r\nof active exploration contracts in the Area to 17. The \r\napplications approved in 2012 included applications by \r\nState and private-sector enterprises sponsored by the \r\nfollowing States parties: Belgium, France, Kiribati, the \r\nRepublic of Korea and the United Kingdom. I wish to \r\ncongratulate those States and their sponsored entities \r\non their decision to join the growing group of States \r\nwith active exploration interests in the seabed beyond \r\nnational jurisdiction and to foster the development of \r\nthe common heritage of humankind. \r\nAs envisaged by the framers of the Convention, \r\ncontractors with the Authority include States parties, \r\nState enterprises sponsored by States parties and \r\nprivate-sector interests sponsored by States parties. \r\nSponsoring States include not only the developed \r\nindustrialized States but also developing States, \r\ntaking advantage of the provisions of Part XI that \r\nwere designed to allow them equal access to seabed \r\nresources. This is an important achievement that \r\ndemonstrates that the system set out in the Convention \r\nand in 1994 Implementation Agreement work.\r\nIn 2011, the Authority approved the first-ever \r\ncontracts for exploration for polymetallic sulfides \r\nin the Area. Contracts were awarded to entities \r\nsponsored by the People’s Republic of China and the \r\nRussian Federation. I wish to inform the Assembly \r\nthat, in Moscow on 30 October, I had the honour to \r\n12-64324 23\r\nA/67/PV.52\r\nseas biodiversity. Such an agreement could identify, \r\ndesignate and effectively manage a global network \r\nof fully comprehensive, adequate and representative \r\nhigh-seas marine protected areas, including reserves \r\nand other effective spatial management areas. It could \r\nrequire comprehensive prior environmental impact \r\nassessments and strategic environmental assessments, \r\ntogether with ongoing monitoring of the marine \r\nenvironment. It could ensure the provision of, access \r\nto and dissemination of information and transparency \r\nin decision-making processes. It could consider the \r\nquestion of the sharing of benefits derived from marine \r\ngenetic resources in areas beyond national jurisdiction \r\nand require application of the precautionary approach, \r\nas set out in principle 15 of the Rio Declaration on \r\nEnvironment and Development, and the ecosystem \r\napproach in decision-making and management. It could \r\ncall for the effective monitoring, control, surveillance \r\nand compliance and enforcement measures that ought to \r\nbe implemented to support the long-term conservation \r\nand sustainable use of high seas biodiversity.\r\nIn “The future we want”, it is noted with concern \r\nthat the health of oceans and marine biodiversity are \r\nnegatively affected by marine pollution, including \r\nmarine debris, especially plastics, and by persistent \r\norganic pollutants, heavy metals and nitrogen-based \r\ncompounds, from a number of marine and land-based \r\nsources. Leaders committed to taking action to achieve \r\nsignificant reductions in marine debris in order to \r\nprevent harm to the coastal and marine environment \r\nby 2025. \r\nMy delegation hopes that significant reductions can \r\nbe achieved much earlier in order to protect the marine \r\nenvironment and its biodiversity. In that regard, I note \r\nthat the Global Partnership for Oceans, established by \r\nthe World Bank and in which IUCN is a partner, will \r\nbe working to reduce pollution to levels not detrimental \r\nto ecosystem function and biodiversity, and will be \r\nsupporting the implementation of the global programme \r\nof action to reduce pollution, particularly from marine \r\nlitter, waste water and excess nutrients.\r\nIn “The future we want”, concern is expressed \r\nabout the impacts of ocean acidification and climate \r\nchange on marine and coastal ecosystems and \r\nresources. The document reiterates the need to work \r\ncollectively to prevent further ocean acidification, to \r\nenhance the resilience of marine ecosystems and of \r\ncommunities whose livelihoods depend on them, and \r\nto support marine scientific research, monitoring and \r\nmarine environment and addressing the impacts of \r\nclimate change. \r\nLeaders committed to protecting and restoring \r\nthe health, productivity and resilience of oceans and \r\nmarine ecosystems, maintaining their biodiversity, \r\nenabling their conservation and sustainable use for \r\npresent and future generations, and effectively applying \r\nan ecosystem approach and a precautionary approach in \r\nthe management of oceans. The importance of capacity-\r\nbuilding to ensure that developing countries are able to \r\nbenefit from the conservation and sustainable use of the \r\noceans was recognized. \r\nIUCN members met this year at the World \r\nConservation Congress in Jeju, Republic of Korea, \r\nfrom 6 to 15 September and adopted resolutions and \r\nrecommendations to guide the governance of the Union \r\nfor the next four years. Under the Jeju declaration, \r\nentitled “Nature+: Towards a New Era of Conservation, \r\nSustainability and Nature-based Solutions”, it was \r\nnoted that the conservation of biological diversity is \r\nvitally important to human life. Nature is a major part \r\nof the solution to some of our most pressing challenges \r\nin climate change, food security, economic and social \r\ndevelopment and sustainable energy. Nature-based \r\nsolutions build upon the proven contribution of well-\r\nmanaged and diverse ecosystems to enhance human \r\nresilience and to provide additional development \r\nopportunities for all. At Jeju, our members adopted \r\na number of resolutions with respect to oceans, \r\ntheir conservation, management and equitable and \r\nsustainable use. \r\nIn “The future we want”, the importance of the \r\nconservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity \r\nbeyond areas of national jurisdiction was explicitly \r\nrecognized. Leaders and Governments committed to \r\nbuilding on work done under the auspices of the Ad \r\nHoc Open-ended Informal Working Group to study \r\nissues relating to the conservation and sustainable use \r\nof marine biological diversity beyond areas of national \r\njurisdiction, and to addressing the issue on an urgent \r\nbasis before the end of the sixty-ninth session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, including by taking a decision on \r\nthe development of an international instrument under \r\nthe Convention. \r\nIn Jeju, our Members called on States to \r\naddress ocean governance gaps in the protection \r\nand conservation of biodiversity in areas beyond \r\nnational jurisdiction through the negotiation of a new \r\nimplementing agreement for the protection of high-\r\n24 12-64324\r\nA/67/PV.52\r\n“By 2020 ... 10 per cent of coastal and marine \r\nareas, especially areas of particular importance for \r\nbiodiversity and ecosystem services, are conserved \r\nthrough effectively and equitably managed, \r\necologically representative and well-connected \r\nsystems of protected areas and other effective area-\r\nbased conservation measures.”\r\nIUCN’s members at Jeju emphasized the importance \r\nof achieving that Target, through the establishment \r\nof representative networks of marine protected areas, \r\nranging from no-take reserves to multiple use zones, \r\nwhere the pressures of extractive use on marine \r\nspecies and habitats are minimized, consistent with \r\ninternational law, including customary international \r\nlaw, as reflected in the Convention, and based on the best \r\nscientific information available. They also stressed the \r\nimportance of developing other effective management \r\nand protection tools to complement those efforts in the \r\noceans, addressing areas within and beyond national \r\njurisdiction, as appropriate.\r\nIUCN members in Jeju welcomed progress towards \r\ncompletion of the first global integrated assessment \r\nof the state of the marine environment by 2014, and \r\nwelcomed the sharing of information, data and best \r\npractices through that process.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the \r\nlast speaker in the debate on agenda item 75 and its \r\nsub-items (a) and (b).\r\nThe Assembly will now consider draft resolutions \r\nA/67/L.21 and A/67/L.22.\r\nI shall now give the f loor to the representative \r\nwho wishes to speak in explanation of vote before the \r\nvoting. May I remind delegations that explanations of \r\nvote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by \r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nI give the f loor to the representative of the \r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela. \r\nMs. Diaz Mendoza (Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela) (spoke in Spanish): My delegation wishes \r\nto address the draft resolution contained in document \r\nA/67/L.21, on oceans and the law of the sea, under \r\nagenda item 75 (a), which is before the General \r\nAssembly for consideration. \r\nI take this opportunity to recall once again \r\nthat Venezuela is not a party to the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). For \r\nthis reason, the norms mentioned in that instrument, \r\nobservation of ocean acidification and its effects on \r\nparticularly vulnerable ecosystems. In that regard, my \r\ndelegation stresses the importance of protecting coral \r\nreefs and natural blue carbon sinks, such as mangroves, \r\nsea grasses and salt marshes, through the careful \r\napplication to coastal and marine areas of ecosystem-\r\nbased management, the creation of resilient networks \r\nof marine protected areas and effective marine spatial \r\nplanning. We welcome discussion during the United \r\nNations Open-ended Informal Consultative Process \r\nnext year of the impact of ocean acidification on the \r\nmarine environment, including socioeconomic impacts. \r\n“The future we want” also addresses various \r\nimportant fisheries issues. My delegation urges \r\nimmediate action to meet the Johannesburg Plan of \r\nImplementation target to maintain or restore fish \r\nstocks to levels that can produce maximum sustainable \r\nyield by 2015. To do so — or even to approach the \r\ntarget — will require immediate action, including \r\nby reducing or suspending fishing catch and fishing \r\neffort to an extent commensurate with the status of \r\nthe relevant fish stocks. We note the need to carefully \r\nmanage by-catch, discards and other adverse ecosystem \r\nimpacts from fisheries, including through the effective \r\nuse of impact assessments. We note the need to protect \r\nvulnerable marine ecosystems from significant adverse \r\nimpacts. All fishing should be subject to the collection \r\nand sharing of data, to allow for proper assessment of \r\nthe effects of fishing effort on the marine environment \r\nand for the provision of scientific advice for future \r\nactivities. States should eliminate subsidies that \r\ncontribute to overcapacity and overfishing, as those \r\nactivities are not sustainable.\r\nIn “The future we want”, leaders recognize the \r\nneed for transparency and accountability in fisheries \r\nmanagement by regional fisheries management \r\norganizations (RFMOs). Welcoming efforts undertaken \r\nby RFMOs to conduct independent performance \r\nreviews, my delegation urges all RFMOs to undertake \r\nsuch reviews and to make publicly available the results \r\nand any actions taken to address those results. The \r\nGeneral Assembly may wish to consider the adequacy \r\nand outcomes of the reviews and to provide advice as to \r\nhow they may be strengthened and improved.\r\nIn “The future we want”, leaders affirm the \r\nimportance of area-based conservation measures, \r\nincluding marine protected areas. Aichi Biodiversity \r\nTarget 11 states: \r\n12-64324 25\r\nA/67/PV.52\r\nIn this regard, my country attaches the highest \r\nimportance to the sustainable exploitation of \r\nbiodiversity-related resources beyond national \r\njurisdiction being governed by a distinct international \r\ninstrument that is separate from UNCLOS and the \r\nConvention on Biological Diversity. My delegation \r\nexpresses its hope that future decisions on the subject, \r\nincluding the negotiation of a multilateral instrument, \r\nwill be guided by a spirit of inclusion. \r\nThe delegation of the Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela reiterates the arguments put forward in the \r\nmost recent Consultative Process, which are closely \r\nrelated to the reasons that prevented and continue \r\nto prevent my country from being a party to the \r\nConvention. In this regard, our lack of objection to the \r\ntexts adopted at Rio+20 and other aspects of the draft \r\nresolution cannot be interpreted as a change of position \r\non the part of my country towards UNCLOS, including, \r\ninter alia, its relevance with regard to the definition of \r\na possible legal regime applicable to marine resources \r\nbeyond national jurisdiction. \r\nFinally, the lack of consensus on various issues \r\naddressed in the draft resolution, not to mention \r\npractices that are contrary to jurisprudence, highlight \r\nthe need to review any future updating of the terms of \r\nthe Convention, including a review of those matters \r\nthat prevent this instrument from being truly universal. \r\nThere are new situations for it to address. The forced \r\nextension of the principles, norms, criteria and \r\nprocedures of UNCLOS has proved at the very least \r\nto be insufficient, if not counterproductive. This has \r\naffected the development of a regime that should address \r\nthe most important contemporary issues relating to the \r\noceans and seas in an inclusive and equitable manner. \r\nIn view of all of this, the Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela will abstain in the voting.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the only \r\nspeaker in explanation of vote before the voting.\r\nWe turn first to draft resolution A/67/L.21, entitled \r\n“Oceans and the law of the sea”. \r\nI now give the f loor to the representative of the \r\nSecretariat.\r\nMr. Zhang Saijin (Department for General \r\nAssembly and Conference Management): I would like \r\nto announce that, since the submission of the draft \r\nresolution, in addition to those delegations listed in \r\ndocument A/67/L.21, the following countries have \r\nincluding those that could be characterized as \r\ncustomary law, are not applicable, except for those \r\nthat the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela recognizes \r\nexpressly. We reiterate that Venezuela is not a party to \r\nthe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea \r\n(UNCLOS) since it cannot contravene fundamental \r\nprinciples and basic rights to which it adheres and that \r\nremain valid and relevant to this day. \r\nVenezuela has fulfilled its international obligations \r\nunder the law of the sea. It has advocated the \r\ncomprehensive development of the law of the sea with \r\na view to ensuring justice and has emphasized that all \r\nnegotiations related to that law should reflect criteria \r\nand principles related to sustainable development and \r\nthe preservation and sustainable use of the marine \r\nenvironment and its resources for future generations. \r\nIn that spirit, my delegation has cooperated with \r\nefforts to promote coordination on matters pertaining \r\nto the oceans and the law of the sea, in accordance \r\nwith international law, and in that regard participated \r\nconstructively in consultations on the draft resolution. \r\nHowever, and despite the efforts and the f lexibility \r\nshown by some delegations to ensure that the text of the \r\ndraft resolution would reflect the concerns and interests \r\nof all Member States and allow for the legal freedom \r\nof States not parties to UNCLOS, the text produced \r\nduring the recently concluded Open-ended Informal \r\nConsultative Process does not reflect the consensus of \r\nall Member States on issues pertaining to oceans and \r\nthe law of the sea. In particular, it was not possible to \r\nreflect in the text those issues that could affect sensitive \r\ninterests of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. \r\nTherefore, in this statement my delegation ratifies \r\nits historical position on the United Nations Convention \r\non the Law of the Sea, which it has expressed in various \r\ninternational forums, that this instrument should not \r\nbe considered the sole legal framework governing all \r\nactivities related to oceans and seas, and that it cannot \r\nbe characterized as a universal instrument. Thus, \r\nthe Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela believes that, \r\nalthough the text before us contains elements that we \r\nare able to endorse, it also contains elements that led my \r\ncountry to withhold support from the outcome document \r\n(resolution 66/288, annex) of the United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20), \r\nincluding matters relating to marine biodiversity that \r\nare reflected in section XI, and particularly paragraphs \r\n181 and 183, of the draft resolution. \r\n26 12-64324\r\nA/67/PV.52\r\nAbstaining:\r\nColombia, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, \r\nVenezuela (Bolivarian Republic of)\r\nDraft resolution A/67/L.21 was adopted by 125 \r\nvotes to 1, with 4 abstentions (resolution 67/78).\r\n[Subsequently, the delegation of Greece advised the \r\nSecretariat that it had intended to vote in favour.]\r\nThe Acting President: We now turn to draft \r\nresolution A/67/L.22, entitled “Sustainable fisheries, \r\nincluding through the 1995 Agreement for the \r\nImplementation of the Provisions of the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December \r\n1982 relating to the Conservation and Management \r\nof Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish \r\nStocks, and related instruments ”. \r\nI give the f loor to the representative of the \r\nSecretariat.\r\nMr. Zhang Saijin (Department for General \r\nAssembly and Conference Management): I would like \r\nto announce that, since the submission of the draft \r\nresolution, in addition to those delegations listed in \r\ndocument A/67/L.22, the following countries have \r\nbecome sponsors: Barbados, Belgium, Canada, \r\nGreece, Honduras, Madagascar, the Federated States \r\nof Micronesia, Monaco, Montenegro, the Philippines, \r\nPortugal, the Republic of Moldova, Samoa, Slovenia, \r\nTonga, Ukraine and the United States of America. \r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that the \r\nAssembly decides to adopt draft resolution A/67/L.22?\r\nDraft resolution A/67/L.22 was adopted \r\n(resolution 67/79).\r\nThe Acting President: I shall now give the f loor  to \r\nthose representatives who wish to speak in explanation \r\nof vote. May I remind delegations that explanations of \r\nvote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by \r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nMs. Diaz Mendoza (Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela) (spoke in Spanish): The delegation of the \r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela would like to comment \r\non resolution 67/79, which the General Assembly has \r\njust adopted under agenda item 75 (b), entitled “Oceans \r\nand the law of the sea: Sustainable fisheries, including \r\nthrough the 1995 Agreement for the Implementation \r\nof the Provisions of the United Nations Convention on \r\nthe Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to \r\nthe Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish \r\nbecome sponsors: Argentina, Barbados, Belgium, \r\nCameroon, Chile, Greece, Ecuador, Honduras, \r\nIndonesia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Madagascar, \r\nMalaysia, Malta, the Federated States of Micronesia, \r\nMontenegro, the Philippines, Portugal, the Republic \r\nof Moldova, Romania, Samoa, Slovenia, South Africa, \r\nSweden, Tonga, Ukraine and the United States of \r\nAmerica. \r\nThe Acting President: A recorded vote has been \r\nrequested. \r\nA recorded vote was taken.\r\nIn favour:\r\nAlbania, Algeria, Andorra, Angola, Antigua and \r\nBarbuda, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Bahamas, \r\nBahrain, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belgium, Belize, \r\nBhutan, Bolivia (Plurinational State of), Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina, Brazil, Brunei Darussalam, Burkina \r\nFaso, Cambodia, Canada, Chile, China, Costa Rica, \r\nCuba, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Djibouti, \r\nEcuador, Egypt, Eritrea, Estonia, Fiji, Finland, \r\nFrance, Germany, Grenada, Guatemala, Guyana, \r\nHonduras, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, \r\nIreland, Israel, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Kuwait, \r\nKyrgyzstan, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, \r\nLibya, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, \r\nMadagascar, Malaysia, Maldives, Malta, Marshall \r\nIslands, Mauritius, Mexico, Micronesia (Federated \r\nStates of), Monaco, Montenegro, Morocco, \r\nMozambique, Myanmar, Nauru, Netherlands, New \r\nZealand, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Norway, Oman, Palau, \r\nPanama, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Poland, \r\nPortugal, Qatar, Republic of Korea, Republic of \r\nMoldova, Romania, Russian Federation, Saint \r\nLucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, \r\nSan Marino, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Singapore, \r\nSlovakia, Slovenia, Solomon Islands, South Africa, \r\nSpain, Sri Lanka, Suriname, Sweden, Switzerland, \r\nThailand, the former Yugoslav Republic of \r\nMacedonia, Timor-Leste, Togo, Tonga, Trinidad \r\nand Tobago, Tunisia, Tuvalu, Uganda, Ukraine, \r\nUnited Arab Emirates, United Kingdom of Great \r\nBritain and Northern Ireland, United Republic \r\nof Tanzania, United States of America, Uruguay, \r\nVanuatu, Viet Nam, Yemen, Zambia\r\nAgainst:\r\nTurkey\r\n12-64324 27\r\nA/67/PV.52\r\nto the Agreement. This is particularly relevant in the \r\ncase of States, including Argentina, that disassociated \r\nthemselves from those recommendations. As it did at the \r\nsixty-sixth session, therefore, Argentina disassociates \r\nitself from the consensus reached by the Assembly with \r\nregard to the paragraphs of the resolution referring to \r\nthe recommendations of the Review Conference on the \r\n1995 Agreement.\r\nAt the same time, Argentina wishes to point out \r\nthat current international law allows neither regional \r\nfisheries management organizations or arrangements \r\nnor their member States to adopt any measure with \r\nrespect to vessels whose f lag States are not members \r\nof such organizations or arrangements or have not \r\nexpressly consented that such measures may be \r\napplied to the vessels f lying their f lag. Nothing in the \r\nresolutions of the General Assembly, including that just \r\nadopted, can be interpreted as in any way contrary to \r\nthat conclusion.\r\nIn addition, conservation measures, the pursuit of \r\nscientific research, or any other activity recommended \r\nin the resolutions of the General Assembly, in \r\nparticular resolution 61/105, are to be implemented \r\nwithin the irreplaceable framework of international \r\nlaw of the sea already in force, as reflected in the \r\nConvention, including its article 77 and Part XIII. The \r\nimplementation of such resolutions cannot therefore \r\nbe claimed as an alleged justification for ignoring or \r\ndenying the rights established under the Convention, \r\nand nothing in the resolution adopted today or others \r\nadopted by the General Assembly is of a nature to \r\naffect the sovereign rights of coastal States over their \r\ncontinental shelf or the exercise of jurisdiction by \r\ncoastal States with regard to their continental shelf, in \r\naccordance with international law.\r\nParagraph 137 of the resolution we have just \r\nadopted contains an extremely relevant reminder of that \r\nconcept, as reflected in resolution 64/72 and subsequent \r\nresolutions. In that vein, paragraph 138 recognizes the \r\nadoption by coastal States, including Argentina, of \r\nmeasures to address the impacts of bottom fishing on \r\nvulnerable marine ecosystems in the whole extent of \r\ntheir continental shelf as well as their efforts to ensure \r\ncompliance with those measures.\r\nFinally, we reiterate that the growing differences \r\nconcerning the contents of the resolution on sustainable \r\nfisheries seriously compromise the possibility of its \r\nconsensus adoption in the future.\r\nStocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks, and related \r\ninstruments”.\r\nThe topic of sustainable fisheries is a priority for my \r\ndelegation and represents a sector of great importance. \r\nThat is why significant initiatives have been undertaken \r\nto promote and implement programmes for the \r\nconservation, protection and management of marine \r\nbiological resources within our national legislative \r\nframework, which seeks to harmonize the legal order \r\nwith the criteria applied in this sphere by the countries \r\nof the region.\r\nThe Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela is not party \r\nto the United Nations Convention on the Law of the \r\nSea (UNCLOS), including the 1995 Agreement for the \r\nImplementation of the Provisions of the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December \r\n1982 relating to the Conservation and Management \r\nof Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish \r\nStocks. The standards of those international instruments \r\nare not applicable in the national context, except where \r\nexpressly recognized by the Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela or where they may be so in the future.\r\nHowever, for the sake of consensus, my delegation \r\ndid not oppose the resolution on sustainable fisheries \r\nadopted today. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela \r\nnonetheless reaffirms its established position regarding \r\nUNCLOS and related agreements, wherefore we express \r\nour reservations on the content of the resolution.\r\nMr. Martinsen (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nMy explanation of vote refers to resolution 67/79, on \r\nsustainable fisheries. While Argentina joined in the \r\nconsensus adoption of the resolution, I wish to state \r\nonce again that none of the recommendations in the \r\ntext can be interpreted as meaning that the provisions \r\nof the 1995 Agreement for the Implementation of the \r\nProvisions of the United Nations Convention on the \r\nLaw of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to the \r\nConservation and Management of Straddling Fish \r\nStocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks can be \r\nconsidered as binding on States that have not explicitly \r\nexpressed their consent to fulfilling obligations under \r\nthe Agreement.\r\nThe resolution we have just adopted contains \r\nparagraphs relating to the implementation of the \r\nrecommendations of the Review Conference on \r\nthe Agreement. Argentina reiterates that those \r\nrecommendations cannot be considered applicable, \r\neven as recommendations, to States that are not parties \r\n28 12-64324\r\nA/67/PV.52\r\nAs for resolution 67/79 on sustainable fisheries, \r\nadopted under sub-item (b) of agenda item 75, I \r\nwould like to state that Turkey is committed to the \r\nconservation, management and sustainable use of \r\nmarine living resources, and attaches great importance \r\nto regional cooperation to that end. In that context, \r\nTurkey supported the resolution; however, we dissociate \r\nourselves from references made in the resolution to \r\ninternational instruments to which Turkey is not a party. \r\nThose references should therefore not be interpreted as \r\nrepresenting any change in Turkey’s legal position with \r\nregard to those instruments.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is \r\nthe wish of the General Assembly to conclude its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 75 and its sub-items (a) \r\nand (b)?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.05 p.m.\r\nMr. Şahinol (Turkey): Turkey voted against \r\nresolution 67/78, entitled “Oceans and the law of the \r\nsea” under agenda item 75 (a). I would like to recall \r\nthat the reasons that have prevented Turkey from being \r\na party to the United Nations Convention on the Law \r\nof the Sea remain valid. Turkey supports international \r\nefforts to establish a regime of the sea that is based on \r\nthe principle of equity and acceptable to all States. \r\nHowever, in our opinion the Convention does not \r\nprovide sufficient safeguards for special geographical \r\nsituations and, as a consequence, does not take into \r\nconsideration conflicting interests and sensitivities \r\narising from special circumstances. Furthermore, \r\nthe Convention does not allow States to register \r\nreservations to its articles. Although we agree with the \r\nConvention in its general intent and with most of its \r\nprovisions, we are unable to become a party to it owing \r\nto those prominent shortcomings. That being the case, \r\nwe cannot support a resolution that calls on States to \r\nbecome parties to the United Nations Convention on \r\nthe Law of the Sea and to harmonize their national \r\nlegislation with its provisions.\r\n"
