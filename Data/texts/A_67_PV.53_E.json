The draft resolution \r\ncontained in document A/67/L.34 reflects the state of \r\nplay in the field. A major step in the effort to return or \r\nrestitute cultural property was the convening, in June \r\nin Paris, of the second meeting of the States parties \r\nto the 1970 Convention on the Means of Prohibiting \r\nand Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer \r\nof Ownership of Cultural Property. The adoption of \r\nthe rules of procedure for that meeting contained two \r\nimportant decisions: the decision to convene every two \r\nyears, thereby granting a necessary periodicity to the \r\nmeetings, and the creation of a subsidiary committee \r\nto promote the purposes of the Convention. More \r\nspecifically, the subsidiary committee will, inter \r\nalia, review national reports and prepare and submit \r\nto the meeting of States parties guidelines aiming at \r\nimproving the implementation of the 1970 Convention.\r\nDespite concerted international efforts to tackle \r\nthe problem, the illicit traffic of cultural property \r\ncontinues to pose a serious threat to the cultural \r\nheritage of States. The threat is higher in situations \r\nUnited Nations A/67/PV.53\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-seventh session\r\n53rd plenary meeting\r\nWednesday, 12 December 2012, 10 a.m.\r\nNew York\r\nOffi cial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Jeremić  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Serbia)\r\n2 12-64420\r\nA/67/PV.53\r\nof crisis and conflict, when cultural objects are often \r\nsmuggled outside their countries of origin. The draft \r\nresolution under consideration today condemns recent \r\nattacks against world cultural heritage sites and calls \r\nfor an immediate end to such acts by reminding States \r\nparties to the Convention of their obligations under it.\r\nAwareness-raising and capacity-building are \r\ncritical to the success of the efforts undertaken in \r\nthe context of the return or restitution of cultural \r\nproperty. As is highlighted in the draft resolution, \r\nUNESCO — along with INTERPOL, the International \r\nInstitute for the Unification of Private Law and other \r\nmajor stakeholders — continues to drive a systematic \r\ncampaign to increase the visibility of the available \r\ntools and to organize joint action for the effective \r\nprotection of cultural heritage. Furthermore, the \r\ndraft resolution welcomes the presentation of model \r\nlegislative provisions on undiscovered cultural objects, \r\nwhich is another important step towards combating \r\nthe phenomenon of illegal excavations and ensuring \r\nthat ownership of unearthed archaeological objects \r\nremains in their countries. Moreover, interaction with \r\nthe international art market with a view to improving \r\npractices in various areas of expertise — such as \r\nprovenance, investigation, ethics and procedures of \r\nrestitution — has proved to be of paramount importance.\r\nRecent restitution cases, either in the framework \r\nof the 1970 Convention or under the auspices of the \r\nIntergovernmental Committee, show the importance \r\nof international cooperation in facing the challenge. \r\nThe restitution from Canada to Bulgaria of 21,000 \r\ncoins, jewels and other artifacts that had been illicitly \r\nimported to Canada and seized by the Canadian \r\npolice, and the restitution of the Boğazköy Sphinx to \r\nTurkey, to mention only two cases, are clear examples \r\nof the successful use of available tools, be they legal \r\ninstruments or bilateral agreements.\r\nIts cultural heritage is the mirror of a country’s \r\nhistory and therefore lies within the very core of its \r\nexistence, since it represents not only specific values \r\nand traditions but also the unique way that a people \r\nperceives the world. Whether it is a Makonde mask, an \r\nEtruscan vase or a Parthenon frieze, each is a testimony \r\nto a nation’s path in time. But if they are to continue to \r\nserve their artistic, aesthetic and social raisons d’être, \r\nthey must be protected against illicit acts and use and, \r\nin such cases, be restored and returned to their natural \r\nenvironment, outside of which they can no longer \r\ninspire the collective conscience of humanity. That is \r\nprecisely the reason for which the objectives of this \r\ndraft resolution should leave no State indifferent.\r\nMr. Estreme (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nArgentina wishes to express its support for the adoption \r\nof draft resolution A/67/L.34, intended to protect and \r\nsafeguard the historical and cultural heritage of States. \r\nThe cultural heritage of a State bears clear, unequivocal \r\nwitness to its identity. For that reason, Argentina is \r\nfirmly committed to combating the unlawful trafficking \r\nof cultural property, which can no longer be considered \r\nbooty but is rather a fundamental element of a people’s \r\ncivilization and culture.\r\nArgentina is party to the 1970 UNESCO \r\nConvention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing \r\nthe Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership \r\nof Cultural Property. That valuable international \r\ninstrument has now been in force for 40 years and \r\nrepresents a milestone. In coordination with the \r\ncountries of its region, Argentina has promoted the \r\nadoption of measures and mechanisms to foster the \r\neffective application of the Convention and to address \r\nthe challenges connected with the protection of cultural \r\nproperty in today’s world, to analyse strengths and \r\nweaknesses, and to identify future challenges. \r\nIn 2013, Argentina hopes to join the recently \r\nestablished committee for follow-up to the Convention, \r\nwith an eye to promoting initiatives to ensure a better \r\nand more effective implementation of its provisions. \r\nThat hope is in keeping with our membership in both \r\nthe Intergovernmental Committee for Promoting the \r\nReturn of Cultural Property to its Countries of Origin \r\nor its Restitution in Case of Illicit Appropriation and in \r\nthe UNESCO Committee for the Protection of Cultural \r\nProperty in the Event of Armed Conflict. We are party \r\nto the International Institute for the Unification of \r\nPrivate Law Convention on Stolen or Illegally Exported \r\nCultural Objects, the Convention on the Protection of \r\nthe Archaeological, Historical and Artistic Heritage \r\nof the American Nations, and all other international \r\ninstruments relating to the protection of national \r\ncultural heritage. \r\nOur devotion to protecting the cultural heritage \r\nof peoples has led us to create national mechanisms \r\nto combat unlawful trafficking in cultural property, \r\nin particular the Argentine Committee to Combat the \r\nUnlawful Trafficking of Cultural Property, which is an \r\ninterministerial entity to establish the procedures and \r\nmechanisms necessary to preventing and combating \r\n12-64420 3\r\nA/67/PV.53\r\nunlawful trafficking in such property. The Committee \r\nworks in close coordination with INTERPOL, which \r\nmaintains a database of stolen cultural goods. Among \r\nthe entities that have recently joined the Committee, we \r\ncall attention to the Financial Information Unit, which \r\nis responsible for preventing and investigating money-\r\nlaundering and has established clear standards for the \r\nlawful purchase and sale of cultural property.\r\nGiven its geographic location in South America, \r\nArgentina is very sensitive to the trafficking of \r\narchaeological items from the pre-Hispanic era. \r\nHowever, I want to draw attention to recent positive \r\ndevelopments, such as the return of archaeological \r\nproperty to Peru in Buenos Aires in February. Forty-\r\nsix ceramic pieces and a necklace were returned under \r\nthe bilateral convention on the matter. Similarly, in \r\nNovember 2011 the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation returned \r\nto the Brazilian authorities an important collection \r\nthat had been illegally brought into Argentina. Other \r\nexamples of note are the return of Argentine fossils by \r\nthe United States in 2008 and by Australia in 2010. \r\nThe illicit traffic in cultural property has become \r\na serious, increasingly sophisticated world problem \r\nthat is linked to other illegal trade. Moreover, modern \r\ntechnologies have created sophisticated networks of \r\ncontraband and illegal traffic through the Internet. \r\nFighting it requires the development of common \r\nstrategies to detect and prevent such transactions.\r\nCooperation among States through bilateral \r\nagreements on restitution of cultural property \r\nshould absolutely be encouraged. Similarly, States’ \r\nactive involvement in the work of UNESCO through \r\nparticipation in the conventions on the subject and \r\nthe enactment of national legislation reflecting those \r\ninternational commitments would be an effective way \r\nto reduce the pernicious effects of illegal traffic in \r\ncultural property on the living historical heritage of \r\nnations.\r\nMr. Emiliou (Cyprus): The issue of the return or \r\nrestitution of cultural property to the countries of origin \r\nconstitutes an area in which international relations are \r\nput to the test — a noble test, I would say — to ensure \r\nthat cooperation among State and non-State actors \r\ncan positively affect the lofty goal of protecting the \r\ncultural heritage of humankind. My delegation attaches \r\nparticular importance to the issue and to the efforts of \r\nthe United Nations in general, and the United Nations \r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization \r\n(UNESCO) in particular, for the considerable work \r\nbeing done on the subject. In that respect, we welcome \r\nthe report of the Director-General of UNESCO, \r\ncontained in document A/67/219.\r\nCyprus, as a State party to the 1954 Hague \r\nConvention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the \r\nEvent of Armed Conflict, and a signatory of its Second \r\nProtocol, follows with interest the work undertaken to \r\naddress the illicit sale of cultural objects on the Internet \r\nand the need for Member States to adopt appropriate \r\ninternational legislation in the field. The combating \r\nof illicit trafficking in cultural property is a task that \r\nrequires perseverance and multifaceted collaborative \r\nefforts. One of the major efforts to that end is the \r\npromotion of international documentation for recording \r\ndata of cultural property and the dissemination of \r\ninformation in order to assist in its recovery.\r\nCyprus also takes the view that, in order to stop \r\nillicit trafficking, States should ensure that customs and \r\nborder control officials are fully trained in their duties \r\nto apply the rules of the UNESCO Convention on the \r\nMeans of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, \r\nExport and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property \r\nof 1970, and to report any cases of illicit activity to the \r\nappropriate authorities of the State party concerned.\r\nMy country is fortunate to have 9,000 years of \r\nrecorded civilization, which have left us with an immense \r\nstock of cultural heritage which we have an obligation \r\nto protect and bequeath to future generations. By virtue \r\nof its geographical position at the crossroads of three \r\ncontinents and many civilizations, Cyprus’ cultural \r\nheritage has, through the millennia, been continuously \r\nenriched and provides a unique insight into the many \r\ncivilizations that have existed on the island during \r\nits long and eventful history. Many of the artefacts of \r\nthis rich cultural history can be viewed in museums \r\nthroughout the world. Many more, unfortunately, have \r\nbecome the objects of illicit trafficking, especially \r\nthose removed illegally from the territory of the island \r\nunder occupation since 1974.\r\nThe devastation in the occupied areas of Cyprus \r\nis systematic and widespread. Churches, chapels, \r\nmonasteries, cemeteries, libraries, museums and \r\nprivate collections of religious art and antiquities have \r\nbeen destroyed and looted. The illicit trade operating \r\nfrom the occupied area of Cyprus has been illustrated \r\nby a number of cases brought to courts around the world \r\nby the Church of Cyprus, which is the rightful owner of \r\nmany of those artefacts.\r\n4 12-64420\r\nA/67/PV.53\r\nOne well-known case with international \r\nrepercussions was the removal and illegal export of the \r\nKanakaria Church mosaics, a rare work of art dating to \r\nthe sixth century A.D. A lawsuit filed by the Orthodox \r\nChurch of Cyprus in the United States District Court of \r\nIndianapolis resulted in a judgement in 1989 whereby \r\nthe mosaics were returned to their rightful owner, the \r\nChurch of Cyprus, two years later. A related case filed \r\nbefore a German court led to a court decision in 2010 \r\nthat opened the way for the repatriation to Cyprus of \r\nartefacts looted from Kanakaria and other churches and \r\nmonasteries.\r\nPrevention, customs training, criminal justice \r\nresponses and international cooperation lie at the heart \r\nof our strategy on this exceptionally important topic. We \r\nreiterate our unwavering determination to use all legal \r\nand political means necessary to repatriate cultural \r\ntreasures that were illegally obtained from us. We look \r\nto the international community to extend its solidarity \r\nand support to our efforts to protect an invaluable part \r\nof the cultural heritage of humanity.\r\nMr. Ragaglini (Italy): I congratulate Greece on \r\nproposing to the General Assembly once again the \r\nuniversally important theme of safeguarding cultural \r\nheritage and the return of cultural property to the \r\ncountries of origin. Italy is one of the traditional \r\nsponsors of the important resolution under this agenda \r\nitem. With 47 sites on the UNESCO World Heritage \r\nList, we are home to a large share of the planet’s \r\ncultural, artistic and landscape heritage. It is the fruit \r\nof the ancient civilizations that traveled through and \r\nsettled in Italy over the millennia, leaving behind a \r\nunique legacy of different cultures and identities.\r\nThe safeguarding, promotion and appreciation of \r\ncultural and artistic heritage have universal value. In \r\nthe words of the great Italian writer Giorgio Bassani, \r\na forefather of the conservationist movement in Italy: \r\n“Artistic heritage is the proof, the timely witness, to \r\nthe spiritual process that has changed the profile of \r\ncivilization”. There can be no common progress and \r\nno mutual respect between peoples without a profound \r\nunderstanding of the spiritual process to which Bassani \r\nrefers. There is an unbreakable bond — both local \r\nand universal — between cultural properties and \r\ntheir place of conception and creation. The return of \r\ncultural properties to their countries of origin thus has \r\na fundamental historic, spiritual and political value.\r\nUNESCO and the International Institute for the \r\nUnification of Private Law (UNIDROIT) are driving \r\nforces in this common effort, as is well described in the \r\nexcellent report transmitted by the Secretary-General \r\n(A/67/219) for which we are extremely grateful. With \r\nrenewed energy, we must continue initiatives to develop \r\nlegal, practical and awareness-raising tools to improve \r\nthe implementation of the universal legal framework \r\nand international cooperation with governmental \r\nand non-governmental organizations, the art market, \r\ncultural and educational institutions, museums and \r\ncivil society.\r\nThe General Assembly’s adoption by consensus of \r\ndraft resolution A/67/L.34 will send a clear message \r\nthat the protection of cultural assets and their return to \r\ntheir States of origin must remain high on the United \r\nNations agenda. We are pleased by the insertion of new \r\nlanguage, such as the invitation to Member States to \r\nadopt appropriate legislation and to consider trafficking \r\nin illicitly acquired exported cultural properties as a \r\nserious crime. The definition of “serious crime”, we \r\nwere pleased to note, refers explicitly to the Palermo \r\nConvention. Finally, I applaud paragraph 15, which \r\nurges the establishment of national, regional and \r\ninternational databases inventorying cultural property.\r\nIn recent decades, Italy has developed good practices \r\nfor the recovery of illicitly acquired cultural properties \r\nand shared its experience with the international \r\ncommunity. In 1969, Italy became the first country in \r\nthe world to have a specialized police division — the \r\nCarabinieri Art Squad — to address trafficking in \r\ncultural properties. The Squad has created a national \r\ndatabase that carefully documents stolen works in more \r\nthan 400,000 photographs, offering a valuable resource \r\nfor law enforcement agencies as well as purchasers of \r\nartworks. Over the years, the Carabinieri Art Squad has \r\nachieved remarkable results in the recovery and return \r\nof illegally acquired and exported cultural properties, in \r\ncooperation with States Members of the United Nations, \r\nUNESCO, INTERPOL, UNIDROIT and the United \r\nNations Office on Drugs and Crime. It has also trained \r\nspecialized police forces and protected cultural heritage \r\nsites in Albania, Afghanistan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, \r\nEthiopia, Jordan and Iraq. This past summer, the Italian \r\nauthorities and UNESCO held a unique exhibition \r\nof some 30 stolen and recovered cultural items, to \r\nhighlight the importance of international cooperation \r\nin combating trafficking in cultural property.\r\nIn conclusion, Italy remains fully committed to \r\nparticipating in the common efforts of Member States to \r\nfight trafficking in cultural property and facilitate the \r\n12-64420 5\r\nA/67/PV.53\r\nreturn of illicitly-appropriated assets to the countries \r\nof origin.\r\nMrs. Sucuoğlu (Turkey): We would like to express \r\nour full support for draft resolution A/67/L.34, entitled \r\n“Return of restitution of cultural property to the \r\ncountries of origin”.\r\nDespite the increasing awareness and capacity-\r\nbuilding efforts to tackle illicit trading of cultural \r\nheritage, the problem has been ongoing, not least in \r\nthe Mediterranean region. In situations of conflict \r\nor instability, the risk of illicit trafficking of cultural \r\nproperty is even higher. \r\nTo remove artefacts from their natural and historical \r\ncontext is to commit a crime against humankind. Illicit \r\ntrading in cultural property falls into the same category \r\nas illegal arms trading, drugs and human trafficking. \r\nWe strongly believe that cultural assets will find their \r\nreal value by being protected on their own soil.\r\nInternational efforts to combat the illicit trade in \r\ncultural properties require the active involvement of \r\nall Member States, cultural and education institutions, \r\nmuseums and civil society. At the core of the efforts to \r\nprotect cultural heritage lies the active involvement of \r\nUNESCO. We would like to express our appreciation to \r\nUNESCO for its valuable efforts to that end.\r\nThe need to enhance international cooperation in \r\nthis area is reflected in the draft resolution before us. \r\nIt highlights initiatives set forth at the international \r\nlevel through treaties, conventions and the policies of \r\nUNESCO. It promotes cooperation between nations \r\naiming to preserve the cultural heritage of humankind. \r\nIt provides for the return and restitution of cultural \r\ntreasures illegally removed from their place of origin. \r\nWe therefore support all activities and efforts which \r\nwill contribute to international cooperation in this area. \r\nIn that context, Turkey supports the draft resolution \r\nsubmitted by Greece.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\ntake a decision on draft resolution A/67/L.34.\r\nI give the f loor to the representative of the \r\nSecretariat.\r\nMr. Botnaru (Department for General Assembly \r\nand Conference Management): Since the submission \r\nof the draft resolution, and in addition to those \r\ndelegations listed in document A/67/L.34, the following \r\ncountries have become sponsors: Albania, Azerbaijan, \r\nBangladesh, Burundi, the Central African Republic, \r\nCosta Rica, Djibouti, the Dominican Republic, \r\nHonduras, Iceland, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Mauritania, \r\nParaguay, Peru, Qatar, the Russian Federation, Sri \r\nLanka, Suriname, the former Yugoslav Republic of \r\nMacedonia, Timor-Leste, Uganda, Ukraine, the United \r\nRepublic of Tanzania, Yemen and Zimbabwe.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it that \r\nit is the wish of the General Assembly to adopt draft \r\nresolution A/67/L.34?\r\nDraft resolution A/67/L.34 was adopted \r\n(resolution 67/80).\r\nThe Acting President: May I also take it that it \r\nis the wish of the General Assembly to conclude its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 10?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 123\r\nGlobal health and foreign policy\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/67/377)\r\nDraft resolution (A/67/L.36)\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of France to introduce draft resolution \r\nA/67/L.36.\r\nMr. Araud (France) (spoke in French): I have the \r\nhonour to introduce draft resolution A/67/L.36, under \r\nagenda item 123,  “Global health and foreign policy”, \r\non behalf of the seven members of the diplomacy \r\nand health group: Brazil, France, Indonesia, Norway, \r\nSenegal, South Africa and Thailand.\r\nI thank the Secretary-General for his note \r\ntransmitting the report of the Director-General of the \r\nWorld Health Organization, pursuant to resolution \r\n66/115 of 12 December 2011 (A/67/377).\r\nSince 2007, the initiative on global health and \r\nforeign policy has sought to strengthen the place given \r\nto health among the priorities of the international \r\ncommunity and to raise the profile of global health in \r\nthe development of foreign policy. To that end, each year \r\nour group introduces a draft resolution on emerging \r\nglobal health problems.\r\nFor the sixty-seventh session of the General \r\nAssembly, we are introducing the topic of universal \r\nhealth coverage, in the light of its crucial impact \r\n6 12-64420\r\nA/67/PV.53\r\non improving the level of health around the world, \r\neffectively fighting poverty and promoting sustainable \r\ndevelopment.\r\nI would first like to observe that, despite the \r\nprogress that has been made, many tasks remain to \r\nbe achieved for us to attain the three health-related \r\nMillennium Development Goals. Beyond those \r\nenduring challenges, the international community \r\nhas taken on the issue of non-communicable diseases, \r\nwhich now affect all countries. One billion people do \r\nnot have access to health services when they need them, \r\na fact that is compromising the effectiveness of our \r\nefforts to improve global health.\r\nTo respond to these challenges, universal health \r\ncoverage is a comprehensive, inclusive and dynamic \r\nobjective. It is a comprehensive objective because \r\nuniversal health coverage contributes to improving \r\naccess for populations to the health services they \r\nneed, including maternal and child health services, \r\nsexual and reproductive health services, the fight \r\nagainst HIV and AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, and \r\nthe prevention of non-communicable diseases. By \r\nstrengthening health systems through a cross-cutting \r\napproach, universal health coverage contributes to the \r\nrealization of specific goals. That is why it is promoted \r\nby the initiative of the Secretary-General for women’s \r\nand children’s health. These two axes — horizontal and \r\nvertical — are complementary.\r\nIt is an inclusive objective because universal health \r\ncoverage helps to ensure fairness and reduce poverty. \r\nThe World Health Organization estimates that 100,000 \r\npeople fall below the poverty line each year due to illness \r\nor health-care costs. Universal health care coverage \r\nwould allow everyone to receive the services they need, \r\nincluding access to medications, without running the \r\nrisk of falling into poverty. The draft resolution is built \r\naround these two forms of protection: access to health \r\nservices and financial protection.\r\nIt is also a dynamic objective because it seeks to \r\nmove towards universal coverage for populations in \r\nterms of health services and related costs. The draft \r\nresolution recognizes the urgency of that process, but \r\nit does not impose any model, as the financing system \r\nselected will depend on the context of each country. \r\nIt encourages strengthened cooperation among States \r\nto promote the implementation of universal health \r\ncoverage.\r\nAs a comprehensive, inclusive and dynamic \r\nobjective, universal health coverage seems particularly \r\nwell adapted to the post-2015 agenda. The United \r\nNations Conference on Sustainable Development \r\nmarked the key role of social protection in combating \r\npoverty. It recognized the central role of health as \r\na precondition, consequence and indicator of the \r\nthree dimensions of sustainable development. The \r\ndraft resolution therefore encourages States to adopt \r\nmultisectoral approaches to reduce inequalities and \r\npromote sustainable development.\r\nThe draft proposes follow-up action within the \r\nframework of discussions on the post-2015 development \r\nagenda in the Economic and Social Council in 2013 \r\nand in the General Assembly. It builds on the work \r\non universal health coverage by the World Health \r\nAssembly and by regional conferences held this year in \r\nBangkok, Mexico City and Tunis, which demonstrated \r\nthe growing interest in the subject.\r\nThe draft resolution entitled “Global health and \r\nforeign policy” is the fifth on the topic since 2008. It \r\nurges States to consider health issues in the formulation \r\nof foreign policy.\r\nI thank all delegations that participated in the \r\nconsultations and sponsored the draft resolution.\r\nMrs. Martínez Lievano (Mexico) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): We wish to thank the Director-General of \r\nthe World Health Organization (WHO), Ms. Margaret \r\nChan, for her report (see A/67/377), which was prepared \r\npursuant to resolution 66/115 and which develops \r\nthe links between health and the environment and \r\nbetween health and natural disasters. We also welcome \r\ndraft resolution A/67/L.36, submitted by the health \r\nand foreign policy group, which reflects the desire of \r\nMember States to work for universal health coverage. \r\nMexico views both the report and the draft resolution \r\nas further steps in the impetus the international \r\ncommunity has given to discussions of health matters \r\nat the global level. \r\nAmong the advances made in recent years, we \r\nnote the outcomes of the High-level Meeting of the \r\nGeneral Assembly on the Prevention and Control of \r\nNon-communicable Diseases, the High-level Meeting \r\non HIV/AIDS, and the World Conference on Social \r\nDeterminants of Health, as well as resolutions on \r\nthe subject adopted by the World Health Assembly \r\nin Geneva. In that respect, the inclusion of health \r\nissues in the outcome document of the United Nations \r\n12-64420 7\r\nA/67/PV.53\r\nConference on Sustainable Development (resolution \r\n66/288, annex) is very significant. My delegation \r\napplauds the acknowledgment of health as an intrinsic \r\npart of sustainable development that is cross-related \r\nto the three pillars of development: the economic, the \r\nsocial and the environmental spheres. \r\nA ministerial forum on sustaining universal health \r\ncoverage, sharing experiences and supporting progress \r\nwas held on 2 April in Mexico City, with the participation \r\nof Ms. Chan and representatives of 21 countries \r\nfrom five continents and the six regions of the World \r\nHealth Organization.  On that occasion, delegations \r\nstressed their points of convergence with a view to \r\ncrafting a shared vision and political message aimed \r\nat strengthening universal health coverage as a means \r\nof addressing the continuous and growing challenges \r\nof sustainable social development. The Mexico City \r\nPolitical Declaration on Universal Health Coverage \r\nmade it clear that universal health coverage should \r\nbe a central element of the international development \r\nagenda and supported by Governments, international \r\norganizations, civil society and the private sector. \r\nOn behalf of my delegation, I wish to make several \r\nremarks on universal health coverage as a tool for \r\nsustainable development at the global level. \r\nFirst, our discussions have shown that our \r\nGovernments and societies need to invest more in \r\nhealth, even in a context of scarce available resources. \r\nSecondly, in order to make that a reality, political \r\nsupport for the issue of health is critical as an expression \r\nof the will and vision that the international community \r\nbrings to the task of improving the coverage and quality \r\nof the health services our people receive. Thirdly, \r\nresources allocated to universal health coverage \r\nconstitute one of the most profitable investments in the \r\nfuture of our countries, as they contribute not only to \r\neconomic growth but also to the well-being, equality \r\nand sustainable development of our peoples. \r\nToday, a growing number of countries around the \r\nworld, representing all levels of development, have \r\nsome form of universal health coverage.  In Mexico, the \r\ncreation of the social health-care system — commonly \r\nreferred to as the people’s health insurance — has given \r\nequal access to more than 106 million Mexicans.  The \r\nchallenge to those countries that have made universal \r\nhealth coverage a fundamental goal for the well-\r\nbeing of our societies is to ensure its sustainability. To \r\nthat end, it is very important to continue sharing the \r\nbest international practices on matters of financing, \r\nimplementation, coordination and evaluation. In that \r\nregard, we believe that the issue of health, and universal \r\nhealth coverage in particular, should be given serious \r\nconsideration in our upcoming discussions on the post-\r\n2015 international development agenda.  \r\nThe international community needs to address \r\nthe challenge of achieving the full implementation, \r\nimprovement, continuity and sustainability of \r\nhealth services in our countries.  Mexico affirms its \r\ncommitment to continuing to work on the points of \r\nconvergence between the health sector and foreign \r\npolicy within the framework of those discussions. \r\nMs. Prince (United States of America): The \r\nexpansion of health care coverage has been at the \r\nforefront of our domestic agenda, and we believe that it \r\nis appropriate for the international community to begin \r\nputting it at the forefront of its agenda as well.\r\nUniversal health coverage is fundamentally about \r\nall people having equal access to care. President Obama \r\nhas made access to health care a landmark issue of his \r\nAdministration through the Affordable Care Act, which \r\nseeks to dramatically expand Americans’ access to \r\nhealth-care services. The Affordable Care Act advances \r\nthat goal for the United States and includes numerous \r\nprovisions to keep-health care costs low, promote \r\nprevention, and ultimately expand health coverage to \r\n30 million Americans who are currently living without \r\ncoverage.\r\nThe United States believes that health coverage is \r\na national-level concern and responsibility and that, in \r\norder to ensure progress and sustainability, national \r\nGovernments must take on the fundamental challenges \r\nof moving towards more inclusive access. That is \r\nparticularly relevant at a time when the economies of \r\nmany low- and middle-income countries are undergoing \r\nunprecedented economic transition. Half the countries \r\nthat were low-income in the year 2000 have already \r\nbecome or will become middle-income by 2020.\r\nDraft resolution A/67/L.36, which we are about \r\nto adopt, acknowledges the diversity of approaches to \r\nfinancing and sustaining health-care systems that seek \r\nto achieve universal health coverage. The United States \r\nthanks France and the core group of sponsors for the \r\nopen and inclusive way in which they developed this \r\nsession’s draft resolution on global health and foreign \r\npolicy and moving towards universal health coverage. \r\nWe recognize the relevance of the topic and are pleased \r\nto be a sponsor of that important draft resolution.\r\n8 12-64420\r\nA/67/PV.53\r\na crucial role in economic and social development. We \r\nappreciate the fact that the draft resolution encourages \r\nuniversal health coverage in an inclusive and fiscally \r\nsustainable manner. \r\nMany societies in the world are rapidly ageing. \r\nAs the population gets older, the burden on the aged, \r\ntheir families and their societies is expected to increase \r\nrapidly because of the rise in the number of older \r\npeople with non-communicable diseases and mental \r\ndisorders. Japan is experiencing the ageing of society \r\nahead of others around the world. In order to prepare \r\nfor this unprecedented situation, Japan has introduced \r\nvarious measures, such as long-term-care insurance \r\nand comprehensive health promotion measures, in \r\ncooperation with relevant entities. Thanks to these \r\nefforts, Japan has been able to attain high marks for \r\nits population, with increasingly good health, including \r\nlong life expectancies.\r\nOne of the factors that contributed to the success \r\nin Japan is the fact that we were able to attain universal \r\nhealth coverage. That situation was brought about 50 \r\nyears ago by establishing a public health insurance \r\nsystem for the whole nation. The following three \r\ncharacteristics of our experience with the system \r\nshould be pointed out. First, all people have access \r\nto high-quality medical services, regardless of their \r\noccupation or income. Secondly, patients can choose \r\nwhichever medical institution they wish to visit for the \r\nsame price. And finally, we have managed to control \r\noverall medical expenses.\r\nJapan is proud to be able to provide such access \r\nto medical services for the entire nation. In order to \r\nshare that experience with other countries, Japan has \r\ncollaborated with the World Bank on research into \r\nmethods for financing universal health insurance \r\ncoverage. We look forward to sharing the results of that \r\nresearch with all Member States and other interested \r\nparties in the near future.\r\nAlthough only two years remain until the target \r\ndate of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), \r\nchallenges remain on issues such as maternal health \r\nand water sanitation. Those areas require more effort on \r\nour part if we are to attain the MDGs. We believe that \r\nuniversal health coverage will be crucial to achieving \r\nthe MDGs. In order for an entire nation to access \r\nadequate and high-quality medical services, it will be \r\nindispensable to strengthen a sustainable health system \r\nfor that nation. My delegation has mentioned that point \r\non various occasions.\r\nWe recognize the importance of access to medicine \r\nand further note that countries have a wide array \r\nof policies and actions that may be appropriate in \r\npromoting the progressive realization of the right to \r\nenjoy the highest available standard of physical and \r\nmental health care. We therefore think that the draft \r\nresolution should not try to define the content of that \r\nright. Furthermore, to the extent that it is implied in the \r\ndraft resolution, the United States does not recognize \r\nthe creation of any new right that we have not previously \r\nrecognized, the expansion of the content or coverage of \r\nexisting rights, or any other change in the current state \r\nof treaty or customary international law.\r\nThe United States acknowledges the importance \r\nof universal health coverage as a means of addressing \r\nglobal health challenges as we seek to achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals and discuss the \r\npost-2015 development agenda. We also welcome \r\nthe continued focus on health as a critical foreign \r\npolicy issue, and we are enhancing the United States \r\nState Department’s capabilities to conduct diplomacy \r\nin support of global health, including through the \r\nupcoming naming of a global health ambassador.\r\nThe United States is committed to partnering \r\nwith countries in their efforts to strengthen health \r\nsystems in areas that help expand access, reduce health \r\ndisparities and strengthen capacities. We do this by \r\nimproving health-resource tracking to enable countries \r\nto understand the dynamics and gaps in current health \r\nfinancing arrangements as a first step to improving \r\nthem. Our development assistance helps countries \r\nlay the foundations for universal health coverage \r\nby strengthening and increasing human resources \r\nfor health, identifying and scaling up high-impact \r\ninterventions, improving the quality and efficient \r\npurchasing of medicines, strengthening institutional \r\nand management capacities, and improving and \r\ninstitutionalizing quality of care. \r\nThe need is plain and the challenge to our \r\nGovernments is real, both domestically and \r\ninternationally. Advancing global health for all remains \r\na top priority for the United States. Today’s important \r\ndraft resolution confirms the centrality of the challenge \r\nand the opportunity before us.\r\nMr. Yamazaki (Japan): It gives me great pleasure to \r\nbriefly state my Government’s position on global health \r\nissues, including universal health coverage, on the \r\noccasion of the adoption of draft resolution A/67/L.26, \r\nentitled “Global health and foreign policy”. Health plays \r\n12-64420 9\r\nA/67/PV.53\r\n(resolution 66/288, annex) affirmed the importance \r\nof universal health coverage in achieving sustainable \r\ndevelopment. This year, therefore, we have fully \r\nsupported and sponsored draft resolution A/67/L.36, \r\nintroduced by the representative of France, which \r\nfocuses on moving towards universal health coverage.\r\nIt is obvious that on the one hand, poverty \r\ncontinues to be the main cause of health problems. On \r\nthe other hand, poverty alleviation is closely linked to \r\npublic health interventions. Therefore, we underscore \r\nthe need to attain universal access to quality health \r\nservices. That entails providing preventive measures, \r\ncare, treatment and medical products without imposing \r\na huge cost burden on the people. \r\nAchieving that objective, however, requires the \r\nrobust implementation of the 10 priority areas stipulated \r\nin the Oslo Declaration, and the outreach programme to \r\nnon-members of the foreign policy and global health \r\ngroup be pursued. Today, we would like to inform \r\nthe Assembly that Indonesia is honoured to assume \r\nthe position of coordinator of the foreign policy and \r\nglobal health group meetings in 2013. In assuming that \r\nresponsibility, we will ensure that the foreign policy \r\nand global health group will continue to be active in \r\npromoting and raising health issues in the formulation \r\nof foreign policy. \r\nIt is widely recognized that autism symptoms in \r\nchildren have been on the rise for some time. In Indonesia \r\nitself, the incidence of autism has significantly increased \r\nin the past few years and is worrying. Despite the lack \r\nof official data on the number of people with autism in \r\nIndonesia, it is assumed that for every 10,000 births, \r\nthere are 15 to 20 children born with autism. Until now, \r\nin Indonesia, as in most developing countries, dealing \r\nwith autism has been very complicated. \r\nPsychologists and therapists agree that autism is \r\nnot a type of ailment or form of mental retardation. \r\nIndeed, children with autism spectrum disorder often \r\nshow extraordinary cognitive potential. According to \r\nsome studies, a number of structural difficulties have \r\nbeen identified in dealing with problems of autism in \r\nIndonesia, such as lack of professional personnel, the \r\npublic view of autism, costly treatment, the failure of \r\ninsurance to cover autistic children, and problems at \r\nschool. However, as part of its efforts to create greater \r\nunderstanding for children with autism, Indonesia has \r\ncontinuously made the efforts necessary, including \r\nin collaboration with civil society organizations and \r\nFurthermore, the Government of Japan believes \r\nthat universal access to simple and effective health \r\ninterventions, such as vaccination, is also important \r\nfor global health. At the moment, the challenge of polio \r\neradication is at an important stage. Japan will continue \r\nto support efforts to bring results in the field of polio \r\neradication.\r\nFinally, my delegation is aware that the value of \r\nhealth has been increasing in modern society, where \r\nsituations change quite rapidly. In that regard, it is useful \r\nto address health issues from the viewpoint of human \r\nsecurity, which calls for people-centred, comprehensive, \r\ncontext-specific and prevention-oriented responses \r\nthat strengthen the protection and empowerment of all \r\npeople and all communities.\r\nThe world continues to face many challenges in \r\nthe field of global health and therefore requires global \r\ncooperation. In that regard, it is important that we \r\ncontinue the discussions on global health and foreign \r\npolicy. As a member of the global health community, \r\nJapan will be able to contribute to the efforts to strive \r\nfor universal health coverage and intends to continue to \r\nparticipate in the discussion actively.\r\nMr. Khan (Indonesia): At this meeting, Indonesia \r\nwould like to address issues under agenda items 123 \r\nand 127.\r\nWe all are aware that global health remains one of \r\nthe biggest challenges facing the world. We continue to \r\nbelieve that pandemic issues, such as avian influenza, \r\nHIV/AIDS, malaria and severe acute respiratory \r\nsyndrome, in addition to being health problems, \r\ncan threaten a country’s economy and security. \r\nConsequently, Indonesia affirms the need for the \r\nForeign Policy and Global Health Initiative to redouble \r\nefforts to improve the state of global health. In that \r\nregard, there is a need to clearly define our priorities in \r\nstrengthening global health in the context of the post-\r\n2015 development agenda.\r\nIndonesia would suggest that some elements of \r\nthe Oslo Ministerial Declaration — including the \r\navailability and affordability of basic needs, including \r\nhealth services; improved capacity; ensured services in \r\nemergency situations; and the linkage between global \r\nhealth and environment — be incorporated into the \r\npost-2015 development agenda.\r\nWe recall that the outcome document of the United \r\nNations Conference on Sustainable Development \r\n10 12-64420\r\nA/67/PV.53\r\nfoundations, among others, by organizing seminars and \r\ntraining for teachers and parents and creating caring \r\ncommunities in targeted cities for those with autism. \r\nAs part of our outreach and awareness programme, \r\non the occasion of the commemoration of the World \r\nAutism Day in April, the Ministry of Health, in \r\ncollaboration with the Cabinet Ministers’ Wives Club, \r\njointly organized the Walk for Autism and the Autism \r\nExpo 2012. Indonesia believes that a coordinated and \r\nmulti-pronged global response to autism, particularly \r\nwith a view to developing funding and building capacity, \r\nwould greatly advance the interests and well-being of \r\nmillions of individuals and families living with autism. \r\nIn view of the foregoing, Indonesia wholeheartedly \r\nsupports and sponsors draft resolution A/67/L.33, \r\non autism spectrum disorders and developmental \r\ndisabilities, initiated by Bangladesh. \r\nMr. Lee (Singapore): Singapore welcomes draft \r\nresolution A/67/L.36, on moving towards universal \r\nhealth coverage, and thanks the foreign policy and \r\nglobal health group for its excellent work on the text. \r\nSingapore further welcomes the note by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on global health and foreign policy (A/67/377), \r\ntransmitting the report of the Director-General of the \r\nWorld Health Organization analysing the challenges \r\nStates face in achieving universal health coverage. \r\nThe issue of universal health coverage has gained \r\nincreasing traction with the international community in \r\nrecent years. All countries — developed and developing \r\nalike — agree that universal health coverage brings \r\nbenefits to society and the economy. Within multilateral \r\nsettings, the World Health Organization has been active \r\nin promoting universal health coverage. In that context, \r\nthe submission of a draft resolution on moving towards \r\nuniversal health coverage at the sixty-seventh session is \r\na timely endeavour. \r\nHowever, the path to achieving universal health \r\ncoverage is complex and there is no universal formula. \r\nInstead, Member States should adopt different \r\nsolutions tailored to their own unique circumstances. \r\nJust as every sovereign State embarks on its own path \r\nof development, every sovereign State should craft its \r\nown approach to achieving universal health coverage. \r\nIn that context, we would like to highlight the fact \r\nthat universal health coverage needs to be not only \r\naccessible and effective, but also sustainable. \r\nTo be successful, such health coverage needs to \r\nsatisfy the following criteria. First, the coverage it \r\nprovides should be universal, ensuring that the sick and \r\npoor are not denied good-quality health care because of \r\ntheir inability to pay. Secondly, it must be affordable for \r\nboth present and future generations. Thirdly, it should \r\nencourage doctors and patients to choose health care \r\nthat is effective and appropriate to their needs. \r\nIn Singapore’s case, we have tried over the \r\nyears to progressively put in place a sustainable \r\nhealth financing system. We are acutely aware of the \r\ndangers of borrowing against our children’s future to \r\nfinance our present needs. In that regard, in the 1980s \r\nSingapore introduced medical savings accounts, known \r\nas Medisave, not to replace but to ensure the long-term \r\nsustainability of universally available Government \r\nsubsidies in our public hospitals. With a rapidly ageing \r\nsociety, we have anticipated that our future generations \r\nwill face an increasingly heavy burden in financing \r\nsuch universal health coverage. In setting up Medisave, \r\nwe ensure that those who can afford to do so set aside \r\nsufficient resources for themselves, freeing up subsidies \r\nto those who most need it. \r\nSingapore’s health financing system is also \r\ndesigned to encourage patients and doctors to make \r\nthe appropriate treatment choices, with supply-side \r\ncost containment and demand-side cost sharing in the \r\nform of user fees and patient co-payments. Government \r\nsubsidies for public hospitals are given out on the basis \r\nof diagnosis-related groups rather than a fee-for-service \r\nmodel. That has reduced overservicing and increased \r\nhospital efficiency. Our national health insurance \r\nscheme, MediShield, is designed to include deductibles \r\nand co-payments. Such patient cost-sharing features \r\ninstil a sense of individual responsibility when making \r\nhealth care decisions and prevent f lagrant abuse. The \r\nSingapore Government has also worked to ensure that \r\nco-payments are not overly onerous in order to avoid \r\ncreating a financial burden on the patient and his family. \r\nBy and large, Singapore has achieved reasonably \r\ngood outcomes on providing universal health coverage \r\nto our citizens while ensuring a sustainable financing \r\nsystem. Nevertheless, our system is not perfect and will \r\ncontinue to evolve as our health-care needs change over \r\ntime. \r\nI offer the aforementioned examples not to \r\nhighlight Singapore’s modest achievements but to point \r\nto the challenges of achieving sustainable and effective \r\n12-64420 11\r\nA/67/PV.53\r\nZambia’s health-care financing policy treats basic \r\nhealth care as a fundamental human right of its citizens. \r\nThe policy assumes the ideal existence of a well-\r\ndefined and systematically implemented basic health-\r\ncare package, although that is far from being realized. \r\nTo ensure sustainable financing of the health sector, the \r\nGovernment has steadily been increasing the budgetary \r\nallocation from domestic resources to health services. \r\nPublic-private partnerships are integral to Zambia’s \r\nhealth care financing strategy and help to maximize \r\ndomestic resources for health services. However, \r\nexternal financing remains an equally important factor \r\nin our resource mobilization.\r\nUniversal health coverage is not just about Member \r\nStates’ capacity to enrol the entire citizenry in health \r\ncare programmes; it involves both quantitative and \r\nqualitative services, universally provided, when and \r\nwhere required. It therefore demands investment in \r\ninfrastructure development and capacity-building at all \r\nlevels of service provision.\r\nThe World Health Organization’s World Health \r\nReport recommends improving the coordination, \r\ncoherence and effectiveness of governance for global \r\nhealth, as well as addressing the interlinkages between \r\nhealth and the environment and health and natural \r\ndisasters. Its recommendations call for multidisciplinary \r\ncoherence and a re-examination of health care as more \r\nthan a social issue, an entity that does not just cut across \r\nthe three pillars of sustainable development but that is \r\nthe fundamental basis of sustainable development.\r\nForeign financing for universal health coverage \r\nshould encourage a holistic, comprehensive and \r\nintegrated approach to the management of illnesses, \r\nincluding tackling the environmental and social \r\ncauses of ill health as well as managing the diseases \r\nof longevity. Foreign financing mechanisms that spell \r\nout stovepiped conditions of disease specificity have \r\nresulted in the rigid compartmentalization of the \r\nhuman body by health personnel, despite the fact that \r\npeople are whole and interconnected organisms. Global \r\nhealth-care financing should strive to work within \r\nhost countries’ existing structures in order to improve \r\nefficiency and reduce overhead costs and duplication \r\nof efforts.\r\nZambia has made great strides towards achieving \r\nthe health-related Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs), although it is not likely to meet two of the three \r\ntargets. Zambia hopes that the post-2015 development \r\nuniversal health coverage. More importantly, I wish to \r\nillustrate the broader point that each country needs to \r\ndesign its own path to achieving that goal. There is no \r\none-size-fits-all health-care financing system, whether \r\nit be tax-financed, based on social insurance or a \r\nmedical-savings funded model. There are strengths and \r\nweaknesses in each system. What is critical is that we \r\nbe able to objectively judge each system on its merits, \r\nadopt features that work, and refine them to respond to \r\nthe evolving environment.\r\nMs. Kasese-Bota (Zambia): I am grateful for this \r\nopportunity to speak on the important subject of global \r\nhealth and foreign policy, moving towards universal \r\nhealth coverage.\r\nZambia notes with appreciation the outcomes of \r\nthe major United Nations conferences and summits \r\nthat have helped to advance the global health agenda. \r\nThey include, among others, the outcome document \r\nof the United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, entitled “The future we want” (resolution \r\n66/288, annex); the Political Declaration of the High-\r\nlevel Meeting on the Prevention and Control of \r\nNon-Communicable Diseases, adopted on 19 September \r\n2011 (resolution 66/2); the Political Declaration on \r\nHIV/AIDS: Intensifying Our Efforts to Eliminate HIV/\r\nAIDS, adopted on 10 June 2011 (resolution 65/277); \r\nthe Rio Declaration of the World Conference on Social \r\nDeterminants of Health held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in \r\nOctober 2011, as well as the World Health Report of the \r\nWorld Health Organization and the recommendations \r\nit contains on improving the coordination, coherence \r\nand effectiveness of governance for global health and \r\naddressing the interlinkages between health and the \r\nenvironment and health and natural disasters. Zambia \r\nis also cognizant of the World Health Assembly \r\nresolutions WHA58.33 and WHA64.9, on “Sustainable \r\nhealth financing universal coverage and social health \r\ninsurance” and “Sustainable health financing structures \r\nand universal coverage”, respectively.\r\nZambia is aware of its primary responsibility for \r\nensuring the health of its people; hence its vision of a \r\nnation of healthy and productive people. To that end, the \r\nGovernment of Zambia promotes the implementation \r\nof policies and programmes that aim to provide equity \r\nof access to quality and cost-effective health services \r\nas close to the family as possible. However, attaining \r\ncompletely universal access to quality health care still \r\nremains a big challenge.\r\n12 12-64420\r\nA/67/PV.53\r\nstates that a community must provide basic health care \r\nthrough a communal fund aimed at caring for the sick. \r\nWhen the State of Israel was established in 1948, a \r\nsignificant national health infrastructure was already \r\nin place. We have given high priority to developing \r\ninnovative and effective solutions to meet the range of \r\nhealth challenges facing our diverse population. In fact, \r\nIsrael was a pioneer in the practice of universal health \r\ncare, and our system has been used as a model for many \r\nother countries.\r\nIn 1995, the National Health Insurance Law went \r\ninto effect. The law Sets forth the State’s responsibility \r\nto provide health services for all residents of the country, \r\nnot only its citizens. It stipulates that a standardized \r\nbasket of medical services, including hospitalization, \r\nwill be supplied to all, whether they live in urban \r\ncentres or outside them. Israel’s national health-care \r\nsystem takes into account the two important and \r\ninterrelated components of universal health coverage: \r\ncoverage for everyone who needs health services, \r\nincluding prevention, promotion, treatment and \r\nrehabilitation, and protection from financial risk. Our \r\nsystem is holistic and comprehensive, and uses online \r\ntools to ensure greater and more frequent access to \r\nhealth services and to help patients manage their health \r\nmore effectively.\r\nPromoting good health is also one of the key \r\npriorities that guide us in our international development \r\nwork. For decades, Israel has provided its expertise, \r\ntechnology, medicine and training in the field of health \r\ncare, to developing countries. That important work \r\nis carried out by MASHAV — Israel’s agency for \r\ndevelopment cooperation — in partnership with the \r\nMinistry of Health, civil society and the private sector.\r\nAllow me to provide a few recent examples of that \r\nwork. In July, a cooperation agreement was signed \r\nbetween the Vinnytsia City Council in Ukraine and \r\nMASHAV, aimed at improving local medical and \r\nhealth care services. Within the framework of the \r\nagreement, MASHAV established a modern diagnostic \r\ncentre, which included the renovation of infrastructure \r\nand installation of medical equipment, including CT \r\nscanners and radiological and ultrasound facilities. \r\nMASHAV also provided professional training for the \r\noperation and maintenance of the new centre.\r\nIsrael is closely engaged in reducing child mortality \r\nand maternal health around the world. Just over one \r\nyear ago, MASHAV sent an obstetrics and gynaecology \r\nexpert, Dr. Hanna Shapira, with a medical crew to \r\nagenda will utilize both the weaknesses and the \r\nsuccesses of the MDGs to inform its trajectory, as well \r\nas to maintain and sustain the momentum gained in the \r\nrace to the 2015 MDG targets. Zambia remains grateful \r\nto global partners who continue to support our health \r\nsector.\r\nMrs. Davidovich (Israel): At the outset, I would \r\nlike to express Israel’s appreciation to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for transmitting the important report of the \r\nDirector-General of the World Health Organization \r\non global health and foreign policy (A/67/377). The \r\nlinks between health, prosperity, environmental \r\nsustainability and security are well established. \r\nHealthy people are more likely to seek higher levels \r\nof education, to be financially independent and to \r\ncontribute positively to the societies in which they live. \r\nPromoting global health undeniably helps to reduce \r\npoverty and inequality, advance economic progress and \r\ngrowth and lay a foundation for increased stability and \r\nsecurity.\r\nThose issues are at the very core the mission of the \r\nUnited Nations. When it comes to the health challenges \r\nwe face, cooperation is key. In our globalized world, \r\nhealth issues that were once confined to a single region \r\nhave the potential to threaten millions of citizens \r\neverywhere. Many of the greatest health issues we face \r\ntoday are global in scope and call for global responses.\r\nDraft resolution A/67/L.36, which we shall adopt \r\nlater today, focuses specifically on the importance \r\nof universal health coverage. At the United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development earlier \r\nthis year, world leaders recognized the importance \r\nof universal health coverage for enhancing health, \r\nsocial cohesion and sustainable human and economic \r\ndevelopment. They pledged to strengthen health \r\nsystems towards the provision of equitable universal \r\nhealth coverage. The ultimate goal for universal health \r\ncoverage is enabling everyone to obtain the high-quality \r\nhealth services they need without the risk of suffering \r\nsevere financial hardship when using them. Universal \r\nhealth coverage helps to break the vicious cycle in \r\nwhich lack of access to health services impoverishes \r\npeople when poor health renders them unable to work, \r\nwhile health services can impoverish them because of \r\ntheir costs.\r\nThe duty to heal the sick is a deep moral imperative \r\nin the Jewish tradition.

The negotiated title of the \r\ndraft resolution, contained in document A/67/L.33, is \r\n“Addressing the socioeconomic needs of individuals, \r\nfamilies and societies affected by autism spectrum \r\ndisorders (ASD), developmental disorders (DD) and \r\nassociated disabilities”.  \r\nBefore I introduce the draft resolution, I would \r\nlike to mention the names of the Member States that \r\nwere on the list of sponsors as of yesterday. They are \r\nAfghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Angola, Argentina, \r\nAzerbaijan, the Bahamas, Bahrain, Belarus, Benin, \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Burundi, \r\nthe Central African Republic, Chile, China, Costa Rica, \r\nCyprus, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Eritrea, \r\nGeorgia, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, India, Indonesia, the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran, Israel, Jordan, Kazakhstan, \r\nKenya, Madagascar, Malaysia, Maldives, Nepal, \r\nNigeria, Panama, Peru, the Philippines, the Republic \r\nVanuatu, in response to the high stillbirth and maternal \r\nmortality rates facing the small island nation. Although \r\nthe team’s mission concluded after four months, Dr. \r\nShapira continues her work to this day, roaming \r\nbetween the islands by light plane and small motorboat, \r\narmed with a portable, battery-operated ultrasound \r\nmachine. Given that the machine is often the only one \r\navailable in certain areas, it is also used to diagnose \r\nproblems in men.\r\nFor more than 50 years, Israel has sponsored \r\neye clinics in countries where health facilities are \r\ninadequate. Israeli eye doctors travel throughout the \r\ndeveloping world to treat people who suffer from \r\nblindness and poor eyesight resulting from cataracts, \r\nmalnutrition, trauma and infection. These clinics have \r\nbeen set up around the world — in Liberia, Kenya, \r\nMalawi, Mauritania, Mozambique, Namibia, Georgia, \r\nSri Lanka, Viet Nam, Uzbekistan and many other \r\ncountries. This past summer, MASHAV, in cooperation \r\nwith the non-governmental organization Eye from \r\nZion, organized an eye camp in Bamenda, located in \r\nnorth-western Cameroon. During the mission, the \r\nIsraeli medical team conducted sight-restoring and \r\noculoplastic surgery.\r\nAs a proud sponsor of the important draft resolution \r\nbefore us, Israel will continue to play an active role in \r\nthe debate on the intersection between global health \r\nand foreign policy. Against the backdrop of growing \r\nrisks and emerging challenges, increased cooperation, \r\ninvestment and action are needed to achieve better \r\nhealth outcomes for all people. We must put people and \r\ntheir health at the centre of global policies. Together, let \r\nus pledge to improve the health of every family, every \r\ncommunity and every nation — laying the foundation \r\nfor a more secure, more prosperous and more peaceful \r\nplanet.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on agenda item 123. \r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft \r\nresolution A/67/L.36. \r\nI give the f loor to the representative of the \r\nSecretariat.\r\nMr. Zhang Saijin (Department for General \r\nAssembly and Conference Management): I should \r\nlike to announce that, since the submission of the \r\ndraft resolution and in addition to those delegations \r\nlisted in the document, the following countries have \r\nbecome sponsors of draft resolution A/67/L.36: \r\n14 12-64420\r\nA/67/PV.53\r\nautism spectrum disorders, developmental disabilities \r\nand associated disabilities, thus increasing the \r\nopportunities to lead a quality life with the ability to \r\nparticipate in the greater community and the increasing \r\nlikelihood that the individual will need lower levels of \r\nsupport later in life.\r\nIn another preambular paragraph, the General \r\nAssembly realizes that the challenges of meeting the \r\nneeds of individuals with autism spectrum disorders, \r\ndevelopmental disorders and associated disabilities is \r\nparticularly acute in the developing world, resulting \r\nin increased difficulties for individuals and their \r\nfamilies, as well as for the health, education and \r\nsocial welfare systems trying to meet their needs. \r\nIn that vein, the Assembly recognizes that the full \r\nenjoyment by persons with autism spectrum disorders, \r\ndevelopmental disorders and associated disabilities \r\nof their human rights and their full participation will \r\nresult in significant advances in the social and economic \r\ndevelopment of societies and communities as a whole. \r\nWith that aim in mind, the General Assembly \r\nrecognizes in paragraph 2 that, in order to develop and \r\nimplement feasible, effective and sustainable intervention \r\nprogrammes for addressing autism spectrum disorders, \r\ndevelopmental disorders and associated disabilities, an \r\ninnovative, integrated approach would benefit from a \r\nfocus, inter alia, on increasing public and professional \r\nawareness of autism spectrum disorders, developmental \r\ndisabilities and associated disabilities and reducing  the \r\nstigma associated with these conditions; enhancing \r\nand increasing research expertise and service delivery, \r\nincluding through international collaboration, by \r\ntraining researchers, service providers as well as \r\nnon-professionals in early diagnosis and interventions \r\nwithin health and other relevant sectors; enhancing \r\ninclusive educational programmes suited to infants, \r\nchildren and adults with autism; emphasizing the \r\nunique needs of each person with autism across a \r\nspectrum of different characteristics and experiences; \r\nand increasing awareness of the advantages of the \r\ninclusion of individuals with autism spectrum disorders, \r\ndevelopmental disabilities and associated disabilities in \r\nthe society through occupational and leisure activities.\r\nFinally, the General Assembly requests the \r\nSecretary-General to bring the present draft resolution \r\nto the attention of all Members States and United Nations \r\norganizations  as a contribution to the preparations for \r\nthe high-level meeting of the General Assembly on \r\nthe realization of the Millennium Development Goals \r\nof Korea, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, \r\nSri Lanka, Suriname, Tajikistan, the former Yugoslav \r\nRepublic of Macedonia, Timor-Leste, Trinidad and \r\nTobago, Turkey, Ukraine and Uganda.\r\nI understand that quite a number of Member \r\nStates are ready to join the list of sponsors of the draft \r\nresolution today. I hope that they will, and request \r\nthem to manifest their desire to do so by signing the \r\nsponsorship form with the Secretariat.\r\nThe text we agreed during negotiations includes \r\nsome editorial and technical amendments made by \r\nthe Secretariat to the final version. For the sake of \r\ninformation and transparency, I would like to mention \r\nthose corrections. \r\nIn the fifth preambular paragraph, the word “the” \r\nhas been inserted before the phrase “human rights of \r\nall persons with disabilities”. The first lines of the \r\nfourteenth preambular paragraph now read, “Recalling \r\nthat early diagnosis, appropriate research and effective \r\ninterventions are vital”. In the seventeenth preambular \r\nparagraph, the word “passed” has been replaced by the \r\nwords “adopted by the sixty-fifth”. In the nineteenth \r\npreambular paragraph, “international public concerns” \r\nhas been replaced by “international public concern”. \r\nWe have agreed to use the phrase “ASD, DD \r\nand associated disabilities” throughout the text for \r\nconsistency. However, if States give their approval to \r\nthe English text, that might be problematic for other \r\nlanguages, especially the non-Roman alphabetic ones. \r\nSo the technical and secretarial staffs are advised that \r\nthe whole aggregate phase, that is, “autism spectrum \r\ndisorders (ASD), developmental disorders (DD) and \r\nassociated disabilities” may be used in other languages \r\nin such circumstances.\r\nThe finally agreed draft of the resolution contains \r\n20 preambular paragraphs and seven operative \r\nparagraphs. In the preambular section, Member \r\nStates express their concern that persons with autism \r\nspectrum disorders, developmental disabilities and \r\nassociated disabilities continue to face barriers in their \r\nparticipation as equal members of society and reaffirm \r\nthat discrimination against any person on the basis of \r\ndisability is a violation of the inherent dignity and worth \r\nof the human person. The Assembly also recalls that \r\nearly diagnosis and appropriate research and effective \r\ninterventions are vital to the growth and development \r\nof the individual, emphasizing that early intervention is \r\ncrucial for addressing the needs of the individual with \r\n12-64420 15\r\nA/67/PV.53\r\nus to better understand who is affected by autism and \r\nwhat the risk factors are, and to promote early detection.\r\nWhile there is a great deal going on in the \r\nUnited States, we have also established international \r\ncollaborations with many countries across the world. \r\nPuzzles can often best be solved by partnerships, and so \r\nit will be with autism and deepening the understanding \r\nof what puts our children at risk.\r\nThe United States is pleased to be able to join the \r\nconsensus on draft resolution A/67/L.33, now before \r\nus for adoption. In supporting the draft resolution, we \r\nbear in mind that autism is one of many different kinds \r\nof disabilities, and while we credit the sponsors’ good \r\nintentions for highlighting the needs of individuals, \r\nfamilies and societies affected by autism, we note that \r\na number of the issues raised here are also applicable \r\nto many people with a variety of different disabilities. \r\nIssues of stigma, discrimination and exclusion are all \r\ntoo common an experience for people, regardless of the \r\nnature of their specific disabilities. \r\nIt is for that reason that the Convention on the \r\nRights of Persons with Disabilities addresses such \r\nissues in an inclusive and cross-disability manner. \r\nWe are concerned that resolutions focused on only \r\none specific disability may lead to such targeted \r\nresponses that opportunities are missed to develop \r\ncomprehensive, systemic solutions that could benefit \r\nbroader populations. Rather, our preference remains \r\nto adopt disability-themed resolutions on issues of \r\nrelevance to the entire disability community, and \r\nto be inclusive of persons with disabilities in other \r\nresolutions, as appropriate.\r\nIt is also extraordinarily important, in this as in \r\nall resolutions, to be fully mindful of the language \r\nused in order to ensure that it is respectful of those \r\nindividuals who are the focus of the text. We understand \r\nthat certain terminology may be commonly used in \r\nmedical and health-focused forums. However, in light \r\nof the paradigm shift catalysed by the Convention \r\non the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, we call \r\nupon delegations to ensure that we utilize language \r\nthat embodies a human-rights-focused approach to \r\ndisability. In addition, we believe it important to \r\nnote that there are many individuals with autism who \r\nproudly self-identify as autistic and we recognize the \r\nimportant contributions that they make to society, while \r\nrecommitting ourselves to combating societal barriers \r\nthat hinder their full enjoyment of human rights and \r\ninclusion in society.\r\nand other internationally agreed development goals for \r\npersons with disabilities in September 2013.\r\nWith that hope and aspiration, we sincerely believe \r\nthat the draft resolution will stand out in the high-\r\nlevel event on disabilities next year, and its provisions \r\nwill receive due recognition towards its successful \r\nimplementation. In that venture, we need everybody to \r\njoin in support of the draft resolution. By sponsoring \r\nthe draft resolution, they will manifest their ownership \r\nof that holy gesture. We humbly appeal for an increased \r\nnumber of sponsors. \r\nI conclude by offering my sincere thanks \r\nand gratitude to all Member States for agreeing \r\noverwhelmingly and consensually to the adoption of \r\nthe draft resolution today.\r\nMs. Prince (United States of America): It is an \r\nhonour to be here today to speak about addressing \r\nthe socioeconomic needs of individuals, families and \r\nsocieties affected by autism and other developmental \r\ndisabilities. \r\nToday, there is more support for Americans with \r\nautism than ever before. Autism is no longer hidden. \r\nAs recently as the 1990s, scientists believed that autism \r\nwas rare, affecting only 1 in every 2,000 children. As \r\nwe all know now, the truth is very different. Now that \r\nwe can begin to see the extent of the issues, we can \r\nfocus our efforts.\r\nIn the United States, a big step to support those \r\naffected by autism and their families came with the \r\nAffordable Care Act in March 2010, which requires \r\nnew insurance plans to cover autism screening and \r\ndevelopmental assessments for children at no cost to \r\ntheir parents. Insurers in the United States are no longer \r\nallowed to deny children coverage for pre-existing \r\nconditions like autism or to set arbitrary lifetime or \r\nannual limits on benefits. That new law and other \r\nlegislative protections allow us to continue important \r\nresearch and to develop and refine vital treatments.\r\nThrough the innovative programmes of the United \r\nStates Government, my country is working to address \r\nkey questions and provide quality support and services \r\nto all families affected by autism. The Centers for \r\nMedicare \u0026 Medicaid Services are working with states \r\nto shape their Medicaid programmes to help children \r\nand adults with autism get the home care assistance \r\nthey need to take control of their own lives and thrive. \r\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention closely \r\ntrack autism in communities across the nation, allowing \r\n16 12-64420\r\nA/67/PV.53\r\nAs President Obama said last year on World Autism \r\nAwareness Day, \r\n“let us recommit to improving the lives of \r\nindividuals and families impacted by ASDs and \r\ncreating a world free from discrimination where all \r\ncan achieve their fullest potential.”\r\nMr. Al-Mouallimi (Saudi Arabia): We support \r\nthe unanimous adoption of draft resolution A/67/L.33, \r\nentitled “Addressing the socioeconomic needs \r\nof individuals, families and societies affected by \r\nautism spectrum disorders (ASD), developmental \r\ndisorders (DD) and associated disabilities”. Saudi \r\nArabia is proudly associated with this draft resolution \r\nas a sponsor. We would like to thank Bangladesh for its \r\nvaluable efforts, which have resulted in the anticipated \r\nunanimous adoption of this initiative. We are confident \r\nthat the draft resolution, when adopted, will be an \r\nimportant milestone on the path towards raising \r\nawareness and helping take further steps to address the \r\nnumerous socioeconomic problems faced by individuals \r\nsuffering from autism and developmental disorders. \r\nThe international community has a collective \r\nresponsibility to address this important issue. The \r\nrecognition by the General Assembly of 2 April as \r\nWorld Autism Awareness Day, the High-level Special \r\nEvent on Autism and Disabilities held on 19 November, \r\nas well as the anticipated adoption of today’s draft \r\nresolution reflect our increasing focus on this issue. \r\nWe express hope that autism and other developmental \r\ndisorders will continue to receive our due attention and \r\nconsideration as we prepare for the high-level meeting \r\non disability and development in 2013.\r\nThe number of people diagnosed with autism \r\nhas increased dramatically over the years, with an \r\nestimated 1 in every 88 children diagnosed with this \r\ndisability. This is a particularly acute problem in \r\ndeveloping countries that have neither the resources nor \r\nthe expertise to deal with a problem of this magnitude. \r\nThat is why we have given specific reference and \r\nattention to autism in the draft resolution before us. \r\nSuch individuals and their families continue to \r\nsuffer a sense of isolation from society due to a lack \r\nof awareness and a lack of opportunities to integrate \r\ninto mainstream society. Individuals suffering \r\nfrom these disorders need societal understanding \r\nand governmental support throughout their lives. \r\nIndividuals with disabilities have an equal right to \r\nenjoy a full and decent life in conditions that ensure \r\ntheir dignity and their integration into society.\r\nAs the draft resolution about to be adopted \r\nrightly emphasizes, those suffering from autism and \r\ndevelopmental disorders need dedicated and professional \r\nsupport services and robust public and professional \r\nawareness programmes aimed at the integration of \r\nthese individuals into society and at an inclusive and \r\nlife-long learning process, with a particular emphasis \r\non imparting life and social developmental skills and on \r\ntaking advantage of the special abilities that those who \r\nare affected by autism often are able to demonstrate. \r\nThat will require a coherent framework for international \r\ncooperation, awareness-raising programmes and the \r\nprovision of adequate funding.\r\nIn the Arab world, autism is a growing concern. \r\nThe situation has been augmented by the limited \r\nnumber of specialists and experts available to deal with \r\nsuch disorders, as well by a lack of adequate funding \r\nfor programmes to deal with the issue. Saudi Arabia \r\nis actively engaged in the fight against autism and its \r\nsocioeconomic repercussions. Several initiatives have \r\nbeen taken by the Kingdom in recent years in that \r\nregard, including the formation of a charitable society \r\nfor individuals with autism spectrum disorders, as well \r\nas the establishment in 2010 of the first Saudi assembly \r\nto address the needs of such individuals and their \r\nfamilies. Recent legislation also recognizes the rights \r\nof the victims of autism and their families to life-long \r\nsupport. Numerous specialized centres for care and \r\ndevelopment have been established throughout the \r\nKingdom. We will continue to support all international \r\nefforts aimed at addressing and highlighting this \r\nimportant issue in all forums.\r\nMrs. Furman (Israel): Israel welcomes the \r\nimminent adoption of today’s draft resolution \r\nA/67/L.33. We are a sponsor of the draft resolution \r\nbecause Israel is committed to raising awareness \r\nabout autism and to addressing the challenges faced \r\nby autistic individuals and their families. The draft \r\nresolution reflects our deep commitment to advancing \r\nthe rights of these individuals. The draft resolution \r\nappropriately recognizes the leading role played by the \r\nWorld Health Organization in this regard. Israel will \r\nparticipate in the debate both here in New York and at \r\nthe World Health Organization in Geneva.\r\nFive years ago, Israel supported the adoption of \r\nresolution 62/139, which designated 2 April as World \r\n12-64420 17\r\nA/67/PV.53\r\nAutism Awareness Day. Our Mission has organized \r\nside events at the United Nations to mark this day every \r\nyear. We have hosted film screenings, lectures and \r\ninteractive dialogues. \r\nThere is a clear need to raise awareness about \r\ndisabilities, particularly disabilities that are not \r\nimmediately visible. Since autism is invisible to the \r\nnaked eye, it is often misunderstood or misdiagnosed. \r\nCountries must educate their people about autism. They \r\nmust provide resources for developmentally disabled \r\nchildren and adults so that they can fully participate in \r\nsociety. All individuals deserve a life that is dignified, \r\nregardless of who they are or where they live.\r\nIsrael recognizes the importance of providing \r\nresources for autistic children and their families. Israel’s \r\nnational insurance provides grants and subsidies to \r\nchildren with autism so that families can cope with the \r\nadditional costs of raising an autistic child. Autistic \r\nchildren within the Israeli educational system receive \r\nfree education from the age of 3 until they are 21. They \r\nalso enjoy a longer school year and attend school six \r\ndays per week. This provides a more constructive \r\nlearning environment and eases the burden felt by their \r\nfamilies.\r\nIsrael’s vibrant civil society has played a major \r\nrole in advancing these initiatives. The Israel National \r\nAutism Association (ALUT) has launched many \r\neffective public awareness campaigns and advocated \r\nextensively for innovative public policies on autism. \r\nAlong with other non-governmental organizations, \r\nALUT has implemented effective and individualized \r\neducational programmes for autistic children. It \r\nhas allowed thousands of autistic individuals to be \r\nintegrated fully into society.\r\nAs we speak, parents of autistic children in Israel \r\nare launching a campaign to enact an integrative \r\nautism law that will provide Government assistance to \r\nautistic individuals in all aspects of their lives, from \r\ninfancy to old age. Israel is working on this issue at the \r\ninternational level as well. In August, an international \r\nconference was hosted in Jerusalem, bringing together \r\npolicymakers and scientists from around the world \r\nto discuss the latest autism research. These kinds \r\nof collaborations are critical to addressing autism \r\neffectively.\r\nAutism awareness is a global issue. It affects people \r\nin countries around the globe, regardless of gender, \r\nrace or socioeconomic status. Many autistic children \r\ncontinue to go undiagnosed and face tremendous \r\nstigmatization in their societies. The United Nations has \r\na vital role to play, not only in New York, but around the \r\nworld. We must work to ensure that autistic individuals \r\nacross the globe have an opportunity to achieve their \r\nfull potential.\r\nMr. Momen (Bangladesh): The Bangladesh \r\nChairperson of the National Advisory Committee on \r\nAutism, Ms. Saima Wazed Hossain, was supposed to \r\nbe here this morning. Unfortunately, she is not yet here, \r\nand therefore, with due permission, I have the privilege \r\nto take the f loor. \r\nI would like to begin by sharing the following \r\nnames, which everyone here knows: Mozart, \r\nBeethoven, Albert Einstein, Bob Dylan, Bill Gates \r\nand Stephen Hawking. All of these icons and many \r\nmore were, in their childhood, neglected or dubbed \r\n“prodigal” children by their parents because they were \r\non the autism/Asperger’s spectrum. However, all of \r\nthem achieved great success in their life. Their minds \r\nworked differently than those of traditional learners. \r\nAs they found their place in the world, they engaged \r\ntheir strengths and really enriched all of us and this \r\nworld. That is why we are here today. We have a whole \r\npopulation whose talents go undiscovered and whose \r\ngifts go unshared. Their place in the world has been \r\ncarved out only in niches.\r\nToday, in the United States alone, autism is \r\ndiagnosed in 1 out of every 88 children. In a recent \r\nstudy in South Korea, the rate of occurrence was found \r\nto be 2.6 per cent in school-age children. It is true that \r\nwe now have a better understanding of the disorder, our \r\nscreening and diagnostic tools and protocols are more \r\nsensitive and standardized, and more professionals are \r\nable to diagnose it.\r\nHowever, since the disorder was first described \r\nin the early 1940s by Leo Kanner and Hans Asperger, \r\nthe combinations of symptoms have largely remained \r\nthe same. It is still a condition characterized by core \r\nimpairments of social communication, an inability or \r\nloss in language development, motor skills deficits, \r\nhypersensitivity to sensory stimulation, stereotypical \r\nand/or repetitive mannerisms, and restricted interests. \r\nWhat could be the reason for this developmental \r\ndisorder? We still do not know for sure, although, \r\nthrough research, we are identifying an increasing \r\nnumber of genetic and environmental risk factors. Since \r\nit is a neglected area, research funding is still very low.\r\n18 12-64420\r\nA/67/PV.53\r\nthe draft resolution and would issue a humble appeal \r\nto others to rise to the occasion and sponsor the draft \r\nresolution before its adoption.\r\nOur efforts to address the needs of individuals and \r\nfamilies with autism in Bangladesh over the past two \r\nto three years have made us realize that, in order to \r\nfully meet the needs of those with neurodevelopmental \r\ndisorders such as autism, our approach has to be \r\nmultifaceted, comprehensive and integrated with \r\nother community-based programmes. If our solutions \r\nare to be effective and sustainable, treatment needs \r\nto be evidence-based, culturally sensitive and \r\neconomically feasible. There has to be cross-sectoral \r\nand interministerial coordination and collaboration, \r\nso that early-detection programmes and intervention \r\nservices can be incorporated into the existing health, \r\neducational and social systems. We urgently need to \r\nremove the stigma that is associated with disabilities in \r\ngeneral and neurodevelopmental disorders specifically, \r\nand empower parents so that they can be partners in \r\nthe treatment process and informed advocates for their \r\nloved ones. We have to invest in research and training \r\nfor clinical professionals and other professional and \r\npara-professional service providers in the latest \r\ndiagnostic and treatment tools. We also need to create \r\nnew policies and procedures that ensure that those with \r\nautism spectrum disorders are no longer marginalized \r\nbut included in mainstream society throughout their \r\nlives.\r\nCollaborative partnerships that transcend \r\ngeopolitical boundaries are no longer just an option, but \r\na very real necessity. An increasingly globalized world \r\ncertainly presents many challenges, but it also offers \r\nus unprecedented opportunities to accelerate progress \r\nand speed the delivery of answers to our community. \r\nScience has given us the understanding and the tools \r\nnecessary to improve the outcome for these individuals \r\nand their families. We all need to work together to \r\nlessen the stigma they face on a daily basis, develop new \r\nevidence-based solutions that are appropriate given the \r\nlimitations in resources and cultural differences, and \r\ndisseminate and implement existing best practices so \r\nthat all of our children, adolescents and adults with \r\nautism can live a life of dignity and opportunity in \r\norder to fulfil their true potential as happy, independent \r\nand productive members of society.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on agenda item 127.\r\nHowever, what we do know is that, every 15 \r\nminutes, a person is diagnosed with autism and every \r\nyear more children are diagnosed with an autism \r\nspectrum condition than with AIDS, diabetes and \r\ncancer combined. The most effective intervention is \r\nearly detection followed by intensive, evidence-based \r\nbehavioural therapy. The challenge, therefore, is to \r\nmitigate the health, social and economic impacts of \r\nthis global public health crisis around the world, and to \r\nalleviate the suffering of children, adults and families \r\nliving with autism by implementing these best practices \r\nin systematic, feasible and sustainable ways, especially \r\nin countries like Bangladesh, where resources are very \r\nlimited.\r\nIt is also a fact that the vast variety of the needs \r\nof individuals with autism spectrum disorders, \r\ndevelopmental disorders and associated disabilities \r\npose a substantial challenge in terms of addressing \r\nthe disability and providing the appropriate services \r\nfor treatment and care by governmental and \r\nnon-governmental organizations. In addition, children \r\nwith autism spectrum disorders, developmental \r\ndisorders and associated disabilities in all regions \r\nof the world experience challenges in accessing \r\nlong-term health care, education, training and \r\nintervention programmes undertaken by Governments, \r\nnon-governmental organizations and the private sector. \r\nIt goes without saying that persons with autism \r\nspectrum disorders, developmental disorders and \r\nassociated disabilities continue to face barriers in \r\ntheir participation as equal members of society, and \r\ndiscriminating against any person on the basis of \r\ndisability is a violation of the inherent dignity and \r\nworth of a human being.\r\nThat is why it is so important for all United Nations \r\nmember countries to sponsor draft resolution A/67/L.33. \r\nWe need to continue to build capacity to provide care \r\nfor those affected. We need more research to unearth \r\nthe cause and the cure. We need to raise awareness \r\nbecause many of the young people on the spectrum \r\nare so talented and so gifted, yet much of the world \r\nstill dismisses them simply because it is something \r\nthat many of us do not understand. There is a whole \r\npopulation of such children with gifts that have yet to \r\nbe shared with the world. Adopting the draft resolution \r\nwill be a critical step in ensuring that our children \r\nhave a fair and equal chance of leading a happy and \r\nmeaningful life. In this connection, I would once again \r\nthank those colleagues who have already sponsored \r\n12-64420 19\r\nA/67/PV.53\r\nsponsors and will be announced by the representative \r\nof the Secretariat later.\r\nOver the past 12 years, the resolutions adopted by \r\nthe General Assembly on this matter have continuously \r\nreflected the trend of increasingly close cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and the Council of \r\nEurope. The draft text presented today to the General \r\nAssembly, enriched with several new paragraphs, \r\nrecognizes the ever-increasing role of the Council of \r\nEurope in the protection and strengthening of human \r\nrights and fundamental freedoms, the promotion of \r\ndemocracy and the upholding and strengthening of \r\nthe rule of law through its standards, principles and \r\nmonitoring mechanisms, as well as in the effective \r\nimplementation of its legal instruments. It also \r\nreaffirms the commitments and aspirations of both \r\norganizations to further enhancing their cooperation in \r\nfields of common interest.\r\nIn this regard, I would like to express my satisfaction \r\nregarding the consensus reached on language regarding \r\ninternational obligations of Member States, in particular, \r\nwhere applicable, those defined in the Rome Statute of \r\nthe International Court of Justice. We consider it part \r\nof the maturity and increased affirmation of the role of \r\nthis institution with regard to the application of rule of \r\nlaw and fight against impunity at both the national and \r\nthe international levels.\r\nThe new draft reflects the fact that the Council of \r\nEurope now has a wider outreach, far beyond its member \r\nStates’ perimeters. Over the past years, through policies \r\nelaborated, adopted and implemented in its immediate \r\nneighbourhood, the Council of Europe has enhanced \r\nthe promotion of dialogue and cooperation with the \r\ncountries and regions in the vicinity of Europe that \r\nrequest the Council’s assistance, based on the common \r\nvalues of human rights, democracy and the rule of law, \r\nas well as through its numerous legal instruments with \r\na universal vocation.\r\nI should also mention the success of the first \r\nWorld Forum for Democracy, which was convened \r\nin Strasbourg, France, from 5 to 11 October, with the \r\nparticipation of more than 200 experts from around the \r\nglobe and 1,500 participants representing 120 countries \r\nto discuss democracy. The Secretary-General was a \r\nkeynote speaker at that event.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on \r\ndraft resolution A/67/L.33, entitled “Addressing the \r\nsocioeconomic needs of individuals, families and \r\nsocieties affected by autism spectrum disorders \r\n(ASD), developmental disorders (DD) and associated \r\ndisabilities”.\r\nI now give the f loor to the representative of the \r\nSecretariat.\r\nMr. Zhang Saijin (Department of General \r\nAssembly and Conference Management): I would like to \r\nannounce that, in addition to those delegations listed in \r\ndraft resolution A/67/L.33, as well as those mentioned \r\nduring the introduction of the draft resolution, the \r\nfollowing countries have become sponsors: Kyrgyzstan, \r\nQatar, the United Arab Emirates and Uruguay. \r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that the \r\nAssembly decides to adopt draft resolution A/67/L.33?\r\nDraft resolution A/67/L.33 was adopted (resolution \r\n67/82).\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is \r\nthe wish of the General Assembly to conclude its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 127?\r\nIt was so decided. \r\nAgenda item 121 (continued)\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and \r\nregional and other organizations\r\n(h) Cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nthe Council of Europe\r\nDraft resolution (A/67/L.14/Rev.1)\r\nThe Acting President: Members will recall that \r\nthe Assembly held the debate on agenda item 121 and \r\nits sub-items (a) to (w) at its 40th plenary meeting, on \r\n19 November 2012.\r\nI now give the f loor to the representative of Albania \r\nto introduce draft resolution A/67/L.14/Rev.1.\r\nMr. Hoxha (Albania): Based on the mandate given \r\nby the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe \r\nto the Albanian chairmanship of the Council for the \r\nperiod from May to November 2012, I have the honour \r\nto introduce draft resolution A/67/L.14/Rev 1, entitled \r\n“Cooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nCouncil of Europe”, on behalf of the 40 sponsors listed \r\nin the document and other countries that have joined as \r\n20 12-64420\r\nA/67/PV.53\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is \r\nthe wish of the General Assembly to conclude its \r\nconsideration of sub-item (h) of agenda item 121?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\n(n) Cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nthe League of Arab States\r\nDraft resolution (A/67/L.35) \r\nThe Acting President: Members will recall \r\nthat the Assembly concluded its consideration of \r\nsub-item (n) of agenda item 121 at its 40th plenary \r\nmeeting on 19 November. In order for the Assembly \r\nto take action on draft resolution A/67/L.35, it will be \r\nnecessary to reopen its consideration of sub-item (n) of \r\nagenda item 121.\r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of the General \r\nAssembly to reopen its consideration of sub-item (n) of \r\nagenda item 121?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\ntake a decision on draft resolution A/67/L.35. May I \r\ntake it that the Assembly decides to adopt it?\r\nDraft resolution A/67/L.35 was adopted (resolution \r\n67/11 B)\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is \r\nthe wish of the General Assembly to conclude its \r\nconsideration of sub-item (n) of agenda item 121?\r\nIt was so decided. \r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe Acting President: I would like to draw the \r\nattention of members to the date of recess of the current \r\nsession. Members will recall that, at its 2nd plenary \r\nmeeting, on 21 September, the General Assembly \r\ndecided that the sixty-seventh session would recess on \r\nTuesday, 18 December. However, in view of the work \r\nthat remains to be completed in this part of the session, \r\nI would like to propose to the Assembly that it postpone \r\nthe date of recess to Friday, 21 December. \r\nIf there is no objection, may I take it that the \r\nAssembly agrees to postpone the date of the recess to \r\nFriday, 21 December?\r\nIt was so decided. \r\nDespite the fact that the text has been clearly \r\nenriched with renewed language, we regret the absence \r\nof appropriate references to certain important issues, \r\nincluding the abolition of the death penalty. This \r\nissue is of particular importance to all members of the \r\nCouncil of Europe. Indeed, it is an emblematic issue for \r\nthe Council. Compromising 47 members, the Council \r\nof Europe represents the only region in the world to \r\nhave abolished the death penalty — an important fact \r\nthat we should have liked to have seen acknowledged \r\nin the text. \r\nDespite the great f lexibility shown in the \r\nconsultations on this question, we once again had no \r\nchoice but to sacrifice references to this issue in order \r\nto arrive at an agreed text that would be adopted by \r\nconsensus. The Council of Europe remains fully \r\ncommitted to advancing the best values for protecting \r\nand promoting human rights and remains open to \r\ncontinuing dialogue with States members of the General \r\nAssembly to further consolidate our common work. \r\n(spoke in English)\r\nIn conclusion, I take this opportunity to thank all \r\nmembers of the Council of Europe for their cooperation \r\nand support during our chairmanship and all other \r\ndelegations that were actively and constructively \r\nengaged during the two-month process of consultations, \r\nenabling us today to have a text that we hope can be \r\nadopted by consensus, as on previous, similar occasions.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\ntake a decision on draft resolution A/67/L.14/Rev.1.\r\nI now give the f loor to the representative of the \r\nSecretariat.\r\nMr. Zhang Saijin (Department for General \r\nAssembly and Conference Management): I should \r\nlike to announce that  since the submission of draft \r\nresolution A/67/L.14/Rev.1, and in addition to those \r\ndelegations listed in the document, the following \r\ncountries have become sponsors: Azerbaijan, Belgium, \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, Mexico, Portugal, Romania, \r\nSan Marino, Serbia and Slovenia.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that the \r\nAssembly decides to adopt draft resolution A/67/L.14/\r\nRev.1?\r\nDraft resolution A/67/L.14/Rev.1 was adopted \r\n(resolution 67/83).\r\n12-64420 21\r\nA/67/PV.53\r\nThursday, 20 December, in the view that such an \r\nextension would facilitate reaching a consensus on the \r\npending draft resolutions before it.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly agrees to \r\nextend the work of the Fifth Committee until Thursday, \r\n20 December?\r\nIt was so decided. \r\nThe meeting rose at 12.25 p.m. \r\nThe Acting President: I would also like to \r\nconsult members regarding an extension of the work \r\nof the Fifth Committee. Members will recall that, at \r\nits 2nd plenary meeting, on 21 September, the General \r\nAssembly approved the recommendation of the General \r\nCommittee that the Fifth Committee complete its \r\nwork by Friday, 14 December. However, I have been \r\ninformed by the Chair of the Fifth Committee that \r\nthe Committee requests an extension of its work to \r\n"
