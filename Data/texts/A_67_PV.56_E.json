The Assembly \r\nallocated to the Committee 17 substantive and three \r\nprocedural agenda items. Except for the item relating \r\nto the election of officers, all these agenda items fall \r\nunder three headings, corresponding to the priorities \r\nof the Organization, namely, “Promotion of justice and \r\ninternational law”; “Drug control, crime prevention and \r\ncombating international terrorism in all its forms and \r\nmanifestations”; and “Organizational, administrative \r\nand other matters”.\r\nI will introduce the reports of the Sixth Committee \r\non the various items in the order in which they fall \r\nunder these three headings.\r\nI shall begin with the first heading, “Promotion of \r\njustice and international law”, under which the Sixth \r\nCommittee considered nine agenda items and adopted \r\n11 draft resolutions.\r\nThe Sixth Committee considered agenda item 76, \r\n“Criminal accountability of United Nations officials \r\nand experts on mission”. The report on this agenda \r\nitem is contained in document A/67/464, and the draft \r\nresolution recommended to the General Assembly for \r\nadoption is reproduced in paragraph 9 thereof. The draft \r\nresolution confirms the various measures, adopted in \r\nprevious resolutions, aimed at ensuring the criminal \r\naccountability of United Nations officials and experts \r\non mission, and preserves the reporting mechanisms set \r\nforth in those resolutions.\r\nUnder the terms of the draft resolution, the \r\nAssembly would also include the item in the provisional \r\nagenda of the sixty-eighth session, while deciding that \r\nthe consideration of the report of the Group of Legal \r\nExperts, in particular its legal aspects, would be \r\ncontinued at the seventieth session in the context of a \r\nworking group of the Sixth Committee.\r\nThe report on agenda item 77, “Report of the United \r\nNations Commission on International Trade Law on \r\nthe work of its forty-fifth session”, is contained in \r\ndocument A/67/465. The Sixth Committee recommends \r\ntwo draft resolutions for adoption by the General \r\nAssembly, which are reproduced in the report. Under \r\nthe terms of draft resolution I, the General Assembly \r\nwould commend the Commission for finalization and \r\nadoption of a Guide to Enactment of the United Nations \r\nCommission on International Trade Law Model Law on \r\nPublic Procurement and its recommendations to assist \r\narbiter institutions and other interested bodies with \r\nregard to arbitration under the Commission’s Arbitration \r\nRules as revised in 2010. Draft resolution II pertains to \r\nUnited Nations A/67/PV.56\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-seventh session\r\n56th plenary meeting\r\nFriday, 14 December 2012, 10 a.m.\r\nNew York\r\nOffi cial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Jeremić  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Serbia)\r\n2 12-64939\r\nA/67/PV.56\r\nthese recommendations, of which the Assembly would \r\nrecommend the use in the settlement of disputes arising \r\nin the context of international commercial arbitration.\r\nThe report on agenda item 78, “United Nations \r\nProgramme of Assistance in the Teaching, Study, \r\nDissemination and Wider Appreciation of International \r\nLaw”, is to be found in document A/67/466, and the \r\ndraft resolution recommended to the General Assembly \r\nfor adoption is reproduced in paragraph 7 thereof. Under \r\nthe terms of the draft resolution, the General Assembly \r\nwould reaffirm that the Programme constitutes a core \r\nactivity of the United Nations and that there is an increase \r\nin demand for international law training, which creates \r\nnew challenges for the Programme. The Assembly \r\nwould authorize the Secretary-General to carry out the \r\nactivities specified in his reports on the Programme \r\nin 2013; reiterate its request to the Secretary-General \r\nto provide to the programme budget for 2014-2015 \r\nthe resources necessary for the Programme to ensure \r\nits continued effectiveness and further development; \r\nand to decide to consider the viability of voluntary \r\ncontributions as a sustainable method for funding the \r\nUnited Nations Regional Courses in International Law \r\nand the Audiovisual Library of International Law and \r\nthe need to provide a more reliable funding method.\r\nThe report on agenda item 79, “Report of the \r\nInternational Law Commission on the work of its \r\nsixty-third and sixty-fourth sessions”, is contained \r\nin document A/67/467, and the draft resolution \r\nrecommended to the General Assembly for adoption is \r\nreproduced in paragraph 8 of the report. Under the draft \r\nresolution, the General Assembly would, among other \r\nthings, express its appreciation to the Commission for \r\nthe work accomplished at its sixty-fourth session, in \r\nparticular for the completion of the first reading of the \r\ndraft articles on the expulsion of aliens. The Assembly \r\nwould also decide that the consideration of chapter IV \r\nof the report of the International Law Commission on \r\nthe work of its sixty-third session (A/66/10, paragraphs \r\n51 to 76, and A/66/10/Add.1), dealing with the topic \r\n“Reservations to treaties”, would be continued at the \r\nsixty-eighth session of the General Assembly, during \r\nthe consideration of the report of the Commission on \r\nthe work of its sixty-fifth session. Furthermore, the \r\nAssembly would take note with appreciation of the \r\ninclusion by the Commission of two new topics in its \r\nprogramme of work, namely, the topics “Formation \r\nand evidence of customary international law” and \r\n“Provisional application of treaties”, and encourage \r\nthe Commission to continue the examination of the \r\ntopics that are in its long-term programme of work; \r\ninvite the Commission to continue to give priority to \r\nthe topics “Immunity of State officials from foreign \r\ncriminal jurisdiction” and “The obligation to extradite \r\nor prosecute (aut dedere aut judicare)”; and take note \r\nof the tentative work programme of the Commission for \r\nthe remainder of the five-year period.\r\nThe Sixth Committee also considered agenda \r\nitem 80, “Status of the Protocols Additional to the \r\nGeneva Conventions of 1949 and relating to the \r\nprotection of victims of armed conflicts”. The report \r\non this agenda item is contained in document A/67/468, \r\nand the draft resolution recommended to the General \r\nAssembly for adoption is reproduced in paragraph 8 \r\nthereof.\r\nThe report on agenda item 81, “Consideration of \r\neffective measures to enhance the protection, security \r\nand safety of diplomatic and consular missions and \r\nrepresentatives”, is contained in document A/67/469, \r\nand the draft resolution recommended to the General \r\nAssembly for adoption is reproduced in paragraph 7 of \r\nthe report.\r\nThe report on agenda item 82, “Report of the \r\nSpecial Committee on the Charter of the United \r\nNations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the \r\nOrganization”, is contained in document A/67/470. \r\nThe two draft resolutions recommended to the General \r\nAssembly for adoption appear in paragraph 12 thereof. \r\nUnder the terms of draft resolution I, the Assembly \r\nwould encourage all Member States to commemorate \r\nthe thirtieth anniversary of the adoption of the Manila \r\nDeclaration on the Peaceful Settlement of International \r\nDisputes. Under draft resolution II, the Assembly \r\nwould request the Special Committee to continue its \r\nconsideration of all proposals concerning the question \r\nof the maintenance of international peace and security \r\nand of the questions of the implementation of the \r\nprovisions of the Charter of the United Nations related \r\nto assistance to third States affected by the application \r\nof sanctions, and to continue to consider, on a priority \r\nbasis, ways and means of improving the Committee’s \r\nworking methods and enhancing its efficiency.\r\nThe report on agenda item 83, “The rule of law \r\nat the national and international levels”, is contained \r\nin document A/67/471. Under the terms of the draft \r\nresolution recommended to the General Assembly \r\nfor adoption, the Assembly would, inter alia, recall \r\nits high-level meeting held on the topic during the \r\nhigh-level segment of the present session, and the \r\n12-64939 3\r\nA/67/PV.56\r\nDeclaration adopted at that meeting. The Assembly \r\nwould also decide to include the item in the provisional \r\nagenda of its sixty-eighth session and to invite Member \r\nStates to focus their comments in the upcoming Sixth \r\nCommittee debates on the subtopics “The rule of law \r\nand the peaceful settlement of international disputes” \r\nat the sixty-eighth session and “Sharing States’ national \r\npractices in strengthening the rule of law through \r\naccess to justice” at the sixty-ninth session.\r\nThe report on agenda item 84, “The scope and \r\napplication of the principle of universal jurisdiction”, \r\nis contained in document A/67/472. Under the draft \r\nresolution recommended for adoption, which is \r\nreproduced in paragraph 9 of the report, the General \r\nAssembly would decide that the Sixth Committee shall \r\ncontinue its consideration of the matter next year, \r\nincluding in the context of a working group of the \r\nSixth Committee, which would undertake a thorough \r\ndiscussion of the item.\r\nThe Sixth Committee adopted the draft resolutions \r\nunder the first heading without a vote, and it is my hope \r\nthat the General Assembly will be in a position to do \r\nthe same.\r\nI shall now turn to the heading “Drug control, crime \r\nprevention and combating international terrorism in all \r\nits forms and manifestations”. \r\nThe Sixth Committee considered agenda item \r\n105, “Measures to eliminate international terrorism”, \r\nunder this heading. The relevant report is contained \r\nin document A/67/473, and the draft resolution \r\nrecommended to the General Assembly for adoption \r\nis reproduced in paragraph 10 thereof. Should the \r\nAssembly adopt the draft resolution, it would, inter \r\nalia, decide that the Ad Hoc Committee established \r\nby General Assembly resolution 51/210 shall meet \r\nfrom 8 to 12 April 2013 in order to, on an expedited \r\nbasis, continue to elaborate the draft comprehensive \r\nconvention on international terrorism and to discuss \r\nthe item included in its agenda by resolution 54/110 \r\nconcerning the question of convening a high-level \r\nconference under the auspices of the United Nations. \r\nFuture meetings of the Ad Hoc Committee would be \r\ndecided upon subject to substantive progress in its \r\nwork. \r\nThe Sixth Committee adopted the draft resolution \r\nwithout a vote, and it is my hope that the Assembly will \r\nbe able to do the same. Following previous practice, \r\nwhen an Ad Hoc Committee is anticipated to report \r\nback during a session in the event of progress, the \r\npresent item will remain open in the agenda of the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nUnder the third and final heading, “Organizational, \r\nadministrative and other matters”, the Sixth Committee \r\nconsidered seven substantive and two procedural \r\nitems. It should be recalled that agenda item 141, \r\n“Administration of justice at the United Nations”, was \r\nallocated both to the Fifth and Sixth Committees. The \r\nviews of the Sixth Committee on this item are reflected \r\nin a letter, dated 23 October 2012, addressed by the \r\nChairman of the Sixth Committee to the President of \r\nthe General Assembly. That letter appears as an annex \r\nto document A/C.5/67/9.\r\nThe report on agenda item 165, “Report of the \r\nCommittee on Relations with the Host Country”, \r\nis contained in document A/67/477, and the draft \r\nresolution recommended to the General Assembly for \r\nadoption appears in paragraph 8 of the report.\r\nFurthermore, the Sixth Committee considered five \r\nrequests for observer status in the General Assembly. It \r\nrecommended that the General Assembly grant observer \r\nstatus to the Andean Development Corporation, under \r\nagenda item 168, and to the European Organization for \r\nNuclear Research, under agenda item 170.\r\nThe Sixth Committee recommended that the \r\nGeneral Assembly defer decisions on the requests for \r\nobserver status in the Assembly for the Cooperation \r\nCouncil of Turkic-speaking States, under agenda item \r\n166; the International Conference of Asian Political \r\nParties, under agenda item 167; and the International \r\nChamber of Commerce, under agenda item 169, to \r\nthe sixty-eighth session of the Assembly. The reports \r\nconcerning each of the requests for observer status \r\nare found in documents A/67/480, A/67/556, A/67/478, \r\nA/67/479 and A/67/481, respectively. The relevant \r\ndraft resolutions and draft decisions are reproduced in \r\nparagraph 7 of documents A/67/480 and A/67/556, and \r\nin paragraph 8 of documents A/67/478, A/67/479 and \r\nA/67/481.\r\nUnder the third heading, the Sixth Committee \r\nalso considered two procedural items, namely, agenda \r\nitem 116, “Revitalization of the work of the General \r\nAssembly”, and agenda item 131, “Programme \r\nplanning”. The report under agenda item 116, containing \r\nthe provisional programme of work of the Sixth \r\nCommittee at the sixty-eighth session, is to be found \r\nin document A/67/474. The draft decision by which the \r\n4 12-64939\r\nA/67/PV.56\r\nGeneral Assembly would take note of the provisional \r\nprogramme of work is reproduced in paragraph 7 of \r\nthe report. The report on agenda item 131 is contained \r\nin document A/67/475, and no further action by the \r\nGeneral Assembly is recommended.\r\nThe draft resolutions and draft decisions relating \r\nto the agenda items under this third heading were also \r\nadopted by the Sixth Committee without a vote, and \r\nit is my hope that the General Assembly will be in a \r\nposition to do the same.\r\nFinally, I wish to inform the Assembly that there \r\nis no report in respect of agenda item 5, “Election of \r\nthe officers of the Main Committees”. Consistent with \r\nprevious practice, the election of the officers of the \r\nSixth Committee for the sixty-eighth session will be \r\ntaken up at a later stage in the course of the current \r\nsession.\r\nThis concludes my introduction of the reports of \r\nthe Sixth Committee. Let me take this opportunity \r\nto express my gratitude to the Chairman of the Sixth \r\nCommittee, Mr. Yuriy Sergeyev of Ukraine, for his \r\ndedicated work and for the commendable leadership \r\nthat he provided to the Committee, and the other \r\nmembers of the Bureau — Mr. Martin Huth of Germany, \r\nMr. Gonzalo Bonifaz of Peru and Mr. Ismail Chekkori \r\nof Morocco — for their cooperation. I also wish to thank \r\nall representatives and colleagues for their valuable \r\ncontributions to the success of the session. Finally, I \r\nwould like to express my gratitude and appreciation to \r\nthe secretariat of the Sixth Committee, backed by the \r\nCodification Division of the Office of Legal Affairs, \r\nfor its efficient and valuable support and for the \r\ncompetent and professional advice provided throughout \r\nthe session.\r\nThe President: If there is no proposal under rule 66 \r\nof the rules of procedure, I shall take it that the General \r\nAssembly decides not to discuss the reports of the Sixth \r\nCommittee that are before it today.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: Statements will therefore be limited \r\nto explanations of vote. The positions of delegations \r\nregarding the recommendations of the Sixth Committee \r\nhave been made clear in the Committee and are reflected \r\nin the relevant official records.\r\nMay I remind members that, under paragraph 7 of \r\ndecision 34/401, the General Assembly agreed that: \r\n“When the same draft resolution is considered \r\nin a Main Committee and in plenary meeting, a \r\ndelegation should, as far as possible, explain its \r\nvote only once, that is, either in the Committee or \r\nin plenary meeting, unless that delegation’s vote \r\nin plenary meeting is different from its vote in the \r\nCommittee.” \r\nMay I also remind delegations that explanations of \r\nvote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by \r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nBefore we begin to take action on the \r\nrecommendations contained in the reports of the Sixth \r\nCommittee, I should like to advise representatives \r\nthat we are going to proceed to take decisions in the \r\nsame manner as was done in the Committee, unless the \r\nSecretariat is notified otherwise in advance. I should \r\ntherefore hope that we may proceed to adopt without a \r\nvote those recommendations that were adopted without \r\na vote in the Committee.\r\nMembers are reminded that additional sponsors \r\nare no longer accepted now that draft resolutions and \r\ndecisions have been adopted by the Committee. Any \r\nclarification about sponsorship should be addressed to \r\nthe Secretary of the Committee.\r\nAgenda item 76\r\nCriminal accountability of United Nations officials \r\nand experts on mission\r\nReport of the Sixth Committee (A/67/464)\r\nThe President: The Assembly has before it a draft \r\nresolution recommended by the Sixth Committee in \r\nparagraph 9 of its report.

May I take it that the Assembly wishes \r\nto do the same? \r\n8 12-64939\r\nA/67/PV.56\r\nof the Bureau, the Secretary of the Committee and \r\nrepresentatives for a job manifestly well done. \r\nThe General Assembly has thus concluded its \r\nconsideration of all the reports of the Sixth Committee \r\nbefore it.\r\nAgenda item 110 (continued)\r\nElections to fill vacancies in subsidiary organs and \r\nother elections\r\n(a) Election of seven members of the Committee for \r\nProgramme and Coordination\r\nNote by the Secretary-General \r\n(A/67/125/Rev.1/Add.1)\r\nThe President: Pursuant to decision 42/450, of \r\n17 December 1987, and upon their nomination by \r\nthe Economic and Social Council, the Assembly \r\nelects the members of the Committee for Programme \r\nand Coordination. Members will recall that, at its \r\n34th plenary meeting held, on 12 November, the General \r\nAssembly elected five members to the Committee for a \r\nthree-year term of office beginning on 1 January 2013.\r\nMembers will also recall that by its decisions \r\n2012/201 A and B, the Economic and Social Council \r\npostponed the nomination of one member from Latin \r\nAmerican and Caribbean States and one member from \r\nWestern European and other States for a term beginning \r\non 1 January 2013 and expiring on 31 December 2015.\r\nIn that connection, the Assembly has before it a \r\nnote by the Secretary-General contained in document \r\nA/67/125/Rev.1/Add.1. As indicated in that document, \r\nby its decision 2012/201 C of 26 November 2012, the \r\nEconomic and Social Council nominated El Salvador \r\nto fill an outstanding vacancy in the Committee for \r\na term beginning on 1 January 2013 and expiring on \r\n31 December 2015.\r\nIn accordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure, \r\nall elections should be held by secret ballot and there \r\nshall be no nominations. However, I should like to \r\nrecall paragraph 16 of General Assembly decision \r\n34/401, whereby the practice of dispensing with the \r\nsecret ballot for elections to subsidiary organs when \r\nthe number of candidates corresponds to the number \r\nof seats to be filled should become standard, unless \r\na delegation specifically requests a vote on a given \r\nelection. In the absence of such a request, may I take it \r\nthat the Assembly decides to proceed to the election on \r\nthe basis of dispensing with the secret ballot?\r\nThe draft resolution was adopted (resolution \r\n67/101). \r\nThe President: May I take it that it is the wish of \r\nthe Assembly to conclude its consideration of agenda \r\nitem 168?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 169\r\nObserver status for the International Chamber of \r\nCommerce in the General Assembly\r\nReport of the Sixth Committee (A/67/481)\r\nThe President: The Assembly has before it a \r\ndraft decision recommended by the Sixth Committee \r\nin paragraph 8 of its report. We will now take action \r\non the draft decision. The Sixth Committee adopted it \r\nwithout a vote. May I take it that the Assembly wishes \r\nto do the same? \r\nThe draft decision was adopted.\r\nThe President: May I take it that it is the wish of \r\nthe Assembly to conclude its consideration of agenda \r\nitem 169?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 170\r\nObserver status for the European Organization for \r\nNuclear Research in the General Assembly\r\nReport of the Sixth Committee (A/67/556)\r\nThe President: The Assembly has before it a draft \r\nresolution recommended by the Sixth Committee in \r\nparagraph 7 of its report. We will now take a decision \r\non the draft resolution. The Sixth Committee adopted \r\nthe draft resolution without a vote. May I take it that the \r\nAssembly wishes to do the same? \r\nThe draft resolution was adopted (resolution \r\n67/102). \r\nThe President: May I take it that it is the wish of \r\nthe Assembly to conclude its consideration of agenda \r\nitem 170?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI would like to thank Mr. Yuriy Sergeyev of Ukraine, \r\nChairman of the Sixth Committee, the members \r\n12-64939 9\r\nA/67/PV.56\r\nthe United States of America and the Bolivarian \r\nRepublic of Venezuela. Therefore, those 30 States are \r\nalso not eligible for election.\r\nThe General Assembly will now proceed to the \r\nelection of one member to replace those members \r\nwhose terms of office will expire on 7 July 2013.\r\nIn accordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure, \r\nthe election shall be held by secret ballot and there shall \r\nbe no nominations.\r\nI should like to recall, however, paragraph 16 of \r\ndecision 34/401, whereby the practice of dispensing \r\nwith the secret ballot for elections to subsidiary organs \r\nwhen the number of candidates corresponds to the \r\nnumber of seats to be filled should become standard, \r\nunless a delegation specifically requests a vote on a \r\ngiven election.\r\nIn the absence of such a request, may I take it that \r\nthe Assembly decides to proceed to this election on the \r\nbasis of dispensing with the secret ballot?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: With regard to candidatures, I \r\nshould like to inform members that, for the one seat \r\nfrom among the Western European and other States, the \r\nGroup has endorsed Canada.\r\nSince there is one candidate from the regional \r\nGroup and one seat to be filled from that Group, may \r\nI take it that the General Assembly wishes to declare \r\nCanada elected for a six-year term of office beginning \r\non 8 July 2013?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: I would now like to draw the \r\nattention of members to document A/67/572, in which \r\nthe Permanent Representative of the Czech Republic \r\nto the United Nations informs the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly that, according to the agreement \r\namong the members of the Group of Eastern European \r\nStates to rotate their membership in the United Nations \r\nCommission on International Trade Law among \r\nthemselves, the Czech Republic shall relinquish its \r\nseat in favour of Belarus on the last day prior to the \r\nbeginning of the forty-sixth session of the Commission, \r\nin July 2013.\r\nAs a result, a vacancy has occurred and a new \r\nmember must therefore be elected to fill the unexpired \r\nterm of office of the Czech Republic that will commence \r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: May I therefore take it that the \r\nAssembly wishes to declare El Salvador elected \r\na member of the Committee for Programme and \r\nCoordination for a term of office beginning on 1 January \r\n2013 and expiring on 31 December 2015?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: Members are reminded that the \r\nEconomic and Social Council postponed the nomination \r\nof one member from the Group of Western European \r\nand other States for a term beginning on 1 January 2013 \r\nand expiring on 31 December 2015. \r\nThe Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its \r\nconsideration of sub-item (a) of agenda item 110.\r\n(b) Election of thirty members of the  \r\nUnited Nations Commission on International \r\nTrade Law\r\nLetter dated 7 November 2012 from the \r\nPermanent Representative of the Czech Republic \r\nto the United Nations addressed to the President \r\nof the General Assembly (A/67/572)\r\nThe President: Members will recall that, at its \r\n37th plenary meeting, on 14 November, the General \r\nAssembly elected the following 29 States as members \r\nof the United Nations Commission on International \r\nTrade Law for a six-year term of office beginning on \r\n8 July 2013: Armenia, Bulgaria, Cameroon, China, \r\nCôte d’Ivoire, Denmark, Ecuador, El Salvador, France, \r\nGermany, Greece, Honduras, Hungary, Indonesia, \r\nJapan, Kuwait, Liberia, Malaysia, Mauritania, Mexico, \r\nNamibia, Panama, the Republic of Korea, the Russian \r\nFederation, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Switzerland, the \r\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, \r\nand Zambia.
