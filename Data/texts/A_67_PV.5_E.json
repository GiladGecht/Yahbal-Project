The essence of the rule of law is the supremacy \r\nof law over power, ensuring that all power is exercised \r\nfor the purpose of people’s survival and happiness.The \r\nidea of the rule of law can be found universally. That \r\nis because the survival of humankind is maintained by \r\nvirtue of mutual love, discourse and mutual support. \r\nWhere there is society, there is law.\r\nThe philosophy of the rule of law has a long history \r\nin Asia, including Japan. Buddhism came to Japan \r\nin the sixth century. Mahayana Buddhist scriptures \r\ntaught that kings who uphold the law to do good shall \r\nbe protected, but kings who ignore the law to do evil \r\nand oppress people shall perish. In Japan, in the seventh \r\ncentury, Prince Shotoku, a philosopher-politician, \r\nestablished the Seventeen-article Constitution, Japan’s \r\nfirst body of constitutional law.\r\nThe rule of law is a universal philosophy. It is \r\nnot something unique to Europe, and that should not \r\ncome as a surprise. That is because while there may be \r\ndifferences in culture or history between the East and \r\nthe West, human society in itself should be the same.\r\nIn my view, the people of Europe have made two \r\ngreat contributions towards establishing the rule of \r\nlaw as a universal political truth for mankind.\r\nThe first was to create democracy, a system to \r\nestablish laws through discussions. Laws must not be \r\narbitrarily forced upon the people; they must be created \r\nthrough dialogue. Today, parliamentary democracies \r\nhave been widely established in the world, and the laws \r\nare made by duly elected peoples’ representatives.\r\nMs. Flores (Honduras), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair.\r\nThe second was to create international law, the \r\napplication of the rule of law in inter-State relations. \r\nInternational law is also created through discourse \r\nand agreement among States. The wisdom of settling \r\ndisputes between States peacefully, in accordance \r\nwith the law, really took root in the latter half of the \r\ntwentieth century.\r\nAs the representatives of today’s international \r\ncommunity, we have the responsibility to further \r\npromote the philosophy of the rule of law which we \r\nhave inherited from the past. However, we cannot yet \r\nclaim that the rule of law has been fully established in \r\nUnited Nations A/67/PV.5\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-seventh session\r\n5th plenary meeting\r\nMonday, 24 September 2012, 6 p.m.\r\nNew York\r\nOffi cial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Jeremić . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Serbia)\r\n2 12-51951\r\nA/67/PV.5\r\nthe international community today. There are so many \r\ncauses of tension, such as international terrorism, the \r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and issues \r\nrelated to national territories. Now in particular, the \r\nacts of violence committed by the Syrian Government \r\nagainst innocent civilians must not be tolerated in the \r\ncontext of the rule of law. We must strive to find ways \r\nto solve these issues peacefully, on the basis of the rule \r\nof law.\r\nI would like to reiterate today the importance of \r\ninternational courts as a means of settling international \r\ndisputes peacefully, in accordance with the law. In that \r\nregard, in order to facilitate the use of international \r\ncourts, I call upon all States that have not yet done so to \r\naccept the compulsory jurisdiction of the International \r\nCourt of Justice.\r\nI also call upon States to accede to the United \r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea and to the \r\nRome Statute of the International Criminal Court.\r\nI should also like to reiterate the importance of \r\ninternational cooperation in advancing the rule of law at \r\nthe national level. Assistance to developing countries is \r\nespecially important. In that connection, it is essential \r\nto develop legal systems and human resources in each \r\nState. Based on its own experience, Japan has been \r\nextending support in various forms in this area and \r\nremains committed to doing so.\r\nLooking back at the twentieth century, we see \r\nthat the driving force of human society was not just \r\nthe massive economic dynamism created after the \r\nindustrial revolution, nor was it just modern military \r\npower, including nuclear weapons. In the end, the \r\ngreatest driving force behind history is the will of the \r\npeople to pursue peace, liberty and equality.\r\nMankind has now understood the truth that when \r\nthe will of the people is elevated to the level of norms, \r\nsuch norms become laws, and laws bind power. That \r\nis a truth that we must not forget, as we are the ones \r\nresponsible for the fate of mankind in the twenty-first \r\ncentury.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the f loor to His Excellency Mr. Villy Søvndal, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Denmark.\r\nMr. Søvndal (Denmark): I wish at the outset to \r\nalign myself with the statement made by the observer \r\nof the European Union.\r\nToday, with the adoption of the Declaration \r\n(resolution 67/1), the international community has \r\nexpressed its will to strengthen the rule of law so as to \r\npromote global peace, security and stability.\r\nToday we have also affirmed that the rule of law is \r\nstrongly interlinked with the obligations of our States \r\nto respect and promote respect for international human \r\nrights and humanitarian law, and to provide legal \r\nprotection for all without discrimination.\r\nToday, confronted with the global challenges of \r\nrecovering from the financial crisis and eradicating \r\npoverty, we have highlighted the important \r\ninterrelationship between the rule of law and \r\nthe generation of economic growth, sustainable \r\ndevelopment, employment and better opportunities.\r\nAllow me to thank President Jeremić for having \r\ntrusted the representatives of Denmark and Mexico \r\nwith the task of co-facilitating the Declaration adopted \r\ntoday. For both our countries, the rule of law is a core \r\nvalue and a principle of governance. I wish also to thank \r\nthe Secretary-General for his vision of advancing the \r\nrule of law as a critical enabler of the three main pillars \r\nof the United Nations: international peace and stability, \r\ndevelopment and human rights.\r\nSeen from the perspective of Denmark, as a smaller \r\nState, the rule of law provides a common framework \r\nfor addressing problems that transcend borders. The \r\nrule of law is a fundamental condition for creating a \r\nlevel playing field and for preventing and addressing \r\nconflict.\r\nDenmark is convinced that a rights-based approach \r\nto development is necessary. That approach is clearly \r\nreflected in the new Danish strategy for our bilateral \r\ndevelopment assistance, entitled “The right to a better \r\nlife”.\r\nThe strategy recognizes in particular the \r\nimportance of ensuring that women, children and \r\nvulnerable groups have unhindered and equal access to \r\njustice, decision-making, resources and opportunities.\r\nDenmark views the fight against impunity as an \r\nimportant element of the rule of law. This year we are \r\ncelebrating the tenth anniversary of the entry into force \r\nof the Rome Statute. The International Criminal Court \r\n(ICC), through hard work and the support of the current \r\n122 States parties, has gained an important foothold in \r\nthe fight to ensure that those responsible for the most \r\nserious international crimes are held accountable. But \r\n12-51951 3\r\nA/67/PV.5\r\noverstated. It is not just a technical matter to define \r\nthe crime of aggression in international law, and it was \r\nno small thing for States parties to the Rome Statute \r\nto agree on the conditions under which the ICC can \r\ninvestigate and prosecute perpetrators. The ICC would \r\nbe prosecuting leaders who are responsible for the most \r\nserious forms of the illegal use of force against other \r\nStates. Ultimately, what the Kampala compromise did \r\nwas to establish a new mechanism to enforce Article \r\n2, paragraph 4, of the Charter of the United Nations, \r\nwhich prohibits States from using force against another \r\nState in any manner inconsistent with the purposes of \r\nthe United Nations. The ICC will thus bring justice and \r\nits deterrent effect to a whole new place. It will protect \r\nStates from aggression by other States. It will protect \r\nand enforce the United Nations Charter.\r\nLiechtenstein was proud to be the first State to \r\nratify the amendments on the crime of aggression, on \r\n8 May, the anniversary of the end of the Second World \r\nWar in Europe. We will support the ongoing ratification \r\nprocess through advocacy and with technical assistance, \r\nand we are willing to receive requests for assistance at \r\nany time. We are convinced that more States parties \r\nwill ratify the amendments in the coming years in \r\norder to strengthen the implementation of the United \r\nNations Charter and enable the activation of the Court’s \r\njurisdiction in 2017.\r\nOur second pledge is to continue to promote the \r\nstrengthening of political support for the ICC by \r\nconvening an informal ministerial network. I will \r\nlaunch that initiative in two days, here in New York, with \r\na number of ministers who have personally committed \r\nto the ICC. I believe that such an informal network at \r\nthe political level is precisely what the Court needs as \r\nit continues to carry the f lag of justice in a challenging \r\ninternational environment. It goes to the core of the \r\ndilemma that the Court is confronted with — the ICC \r\nis a purely judicial institution that mainly stands up \r\nfor itself by delivering professional, independent and \r\nnon-political investigations and prosecutions. It is \r\nnot designed to have the necessary tools to withstand \r\npolitical headwinds, and therefore it does not have \r\nthem. That is particularly true in situations where \r\nit is mandated by the Security Council to undertake \r\ndelicate investigations, and even more so when the \r\nSecurity Council fails to fully support the Court after \r\nit refers a situation. We supporters must therefore stand \r\nup for the Court in the political arena. Have we done \r\nenough in that regard in recent years? In my view, far \r\nthe Rome Statute system is still in its early days and \r\nin need of continuing political support. Denmark calls \r\nupon all Member States to lend their full support to the \r\nICC and for those Member States that have not yet done \r\nso to join the Rome Statute.\r\nWhile we work to make the International Criminal \r\nCourt a universally recognized and effective body, it \r\nmust be remembered that the primary responsibility \r\nfor prosecution rests with the countries themselves. \r\nInternational courts such as the ICC are complementary. \r\nThey constitute a last resort, when national authorities \r\nfail to act. We therefore encourage States to strengthen \r\nnational judicial systems and institutions.\r\nOn behalf of Denmark, I want to thank all Member \r\nStates for their contributions to our joint Declaration. \r\nDenmark believes that there is a need for an ongoing \r\nprocess to see how the rule of law can help meet the \r\nevolving global challenges we face. States will pursue \r\nthat work, but civil society also has much to contribute \r\nto advancing the rule of law and human rights.\r\nI welcome the many pledges made at today’s High-\r\nLevel Meeting. Denmark has also made several pledges \r\ntoday. Denmark looks forward to engaging in advancing \r\nthe rule of law in cooperation with Member States, the \r\nUnited Nations and civil society organizations.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the f loor to Her Excellency Ms. Aurelia Frick, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, Minister for Justice, and \r\nMinister for Cultural Affairs of the Principality of \r\nLiechtenstein.\r\nMs. Frick (Liechtenstein): In 2006, Mexico and \r\nLiechtenstein jointly requested the inclusion of an item \r\nentitled “The rule of law at the national and international \r\nlevels” in the agenda of the General Assembly. Since \r\nthen, much progress has been made. We applaud \r\nthe hard work of the United Nations Rule of Law \r\nCoordination and Resource Group and we are confident \r\nthat under the leadership of Deputy Secretary-General \r\nJan Eliasson the Group will rise to new levels.\r\nI would like to focus on the pledges that \r\nLiechtenstein has made.\r\nOur first pledge is to continue to promote the \r\nratification and implementation of the provisions of \r\nthe Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court \r\n(ICC) with regard to the crime of aggression. The \r\nimportance of the 2010 Kampala compromise for \r\nthe rule of law and for the United Nations cannot be \r\n4 12-51951\r\nA/67/PV.5\r\nfrom it — and that is why we are launching this new \r\ncollaboration in support of the ICC.\r\nOur third pledge is to submit to the Security \r\nCouncil suggestions on ways to strengthen the United \r\nNations sanctions system. We have been working with \r\nlike-minded countries for several years to improve \r\nthe listing and delisting processes and to bring some \r\nmeasure of due process to targeted sanctions. We \r\napplaud the Security Council for the improvements \r\nmade in some areas, in particular by establishing an \r\nombudsperson for individuals and entities that have \r\nbeen identified as being associated with Al-Qaida. We \r\nalso acknowledge that those procedural improvements \r\nwere not easy to make, because the Security Council \r\nwas not designed to deal with individuals when it was \r\ncreated.\r\nToday, fair and clear procedures for sanctions \r\nlisting and delisting are no longer an experiment. \r\nHigher standards for listing and the ombudsperson \r\nprocess have improved the accuracy of the Al-Qaida \r\nsanctions list, and therefore its credibility. It is a prime \r\nexample of how promoting the rule of law is not just \r\nsomething for lawyers, but a tremendous political tool. \r\nNow is the time for the Security Council to learn the \r\nlessons from those early developments and to apply \r\nthem to other sanctions regimes as well. We look \r\nforward to working with our like-minded partners to \r\nmake concrete suggestions in that regard.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the f loor to the representative of Ecuador.\r\nMs. Espinosa (Ecuador) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nMy delegation wishes to express the pleasure of my \r\nGovernment for the organization of today’s High-level \r\nMeeting.\r\nAs Article I of the Political Constitution of Ecuador \r\nstates that my country is a constitutional State of \r\nrights and justice — social, democratic, sovereign and \r\nindependent. Under those premises, we consider the \r\nrule of law to be a pillar for peaceful coexistence among \r\ncitizens and nations. We therefore defend the equality \r\nof citizens before the law and the sovereign equality of \r\nStates as established under the Charter of the United \r\nNations, whereby no motivation or circumstance would \r\nbe a reason for violating human rights or the sovereignty \r\nof States. At the national level, Ecuador recognizes for \r\nall citizens, men and women, national and foreign, the \r\nsame rights and obligations, affirming the equality \r\nbefore the law of all citizens and guaranteeing access \r\nto an efficient and transparent judicial administration \r\nsystem.\r\nMy Government believes that it is extremely \r\nimportant to comply with the international conventions \r\nand instruments that protect human rights and ensure \r\ntheir implementation at home. Ecuador is a signatory \r\nto all the universal human rights conventions and \r\ninstruments, because we believe that protecting those \r\nguarantees without distinction is a vital element \r\nof peaceful coexistence and the full enjoyment of \r\ndemocracy. Ecuador therefore not only defends those \r\nrights internationally but puts them into practice as part \r\nof its foreign policy in the area of, for instance, the right \r\nto asylum and refuge.\r\nThe rule of law should help us deal with society’s \r\nevolution and with emerging problems that affect \r\nhumankind. The current environmental and climate \r\ncrisis forces us to think about the need for an international \r\nbody of law that guarantees the rights of nature, as my \r\ncountry’s Constitution does. In that regard, Ecuador \r\nproposes that the international community begin the \r\nprocess of producing a universal declaration on the \r\nrights of nature. The rule of law is also a basic tool \r\nfor the development of peoples and for establishing \r\nclear rules for encouraging foreign investment that are \r\nresponsible and respectful of labour and environmental \r\nlaws. We therefore favour the development of national \r\nstandards and mechanisms that will ensure the full \r\nenjoyment of democracy and put in place mechanisms \r\nthat can more effectively ensure its operation.\r\nWe respect the right of every people to decide its \r\nown political system. Ecuador therefore believes that \r\nit is crucial that we encourage reform of the Security \r\nCouncil, a body whose structure is still based on the \r\nrealities of half a century ago and which upholds \r\nprivileges for some States to the detriment of others. \r\nEcuador therefore renews its call to the international \r\ncommunity to conclude the negotiations on Security \r\nCouncil reform, which should not only reflect the \r\nnew international scene and geopolitical situation but \r\nshould also ensure that its operations are democratic \r\nand transparent.\r\nWe also believe in respect for the sovereignty \r\nand territorial integrity of States, a principle that is \r\na fundamental and irreplaceable pillar of the rule of \r\nlaw. We do not believe that the pretext of protecting \r\nnational security justifies encouraging the violation of \r\nnational sovereignty or a State’s territorial integrity. \r\nWe therefore firmly repudiate the so-called extra-\\\r\n12-51951 5\r\nA/67/PV.5\r\nterritorial application of national laws as a serious \r\nviolation of the rule of law at the international level.\r\nSimilarly, any unilateral means adopted outside \r\nthe framework of the United Nations Charter are \r\nclear violations of the rule of law at the international \r\nlevel. Peaceful coexistence among the community of \r\nsovereign States is founded on rules freely accepted by \r\nall; thus the will of one State cannot legally validate \r\nthe use of force as a way of resolving disputes. Nor \r\ncan we use the excuse of protecting national security \r\nor combating transnational threats to contravene the \r\nprovisions of the Charter.\r\nIt is vital that we strengthen regional mechanisms \r\nthat support democracy and the rule of law, since \r\nthereby we strengthen the democratic existence of \r\nGovernments that are legitimately constituted. Latin \r\nAmerica has made great progress in that area. In that \r\nregard, I would like to highlight the existence of the \r\ndemocracy clause agreed on by the heads of State of \r\nthe Union of South American Nations, which aims to \r\nguarantee democracy in the region.\r\nWith regard to strengthening the rule of law \r\nnationally, the Government of Ecuador attaches great \r\nimportance to a complete overhaul of the judicial code \r\nthrough comprehensive modernization that makes use of \r\nthe most up-to-date technology, meritocracy, efficiency \r\nand transparency in its operations. Similarly, the \r\nexistence of accountability mechanisms, transparency \r\nin public funding, public access to information and the \r\nstrengthening of monitoring agencies that enable us to \r\nprevent and correct abuses and ensure proper spending \r\nof financing for public judicial bodies are all essential \r\nto the administrative justice system in Ecuador. My \r\nGovernment is firmly committed to making progress \r\nin this area.\r\nLastly, it is essential to ensure that the alternative \r\nmechanisms for the administration of justice based \r\non the law of indigenous peoples are compatible with \r\nthe traditional systems, ensuring that such alternative \r\nsystems respect the human rights of those governed, \r\nas covered by the conventions and international \r\ninstruments ratified by a State.\r\nMy delegation attaches great importance to \r\ndeveloping the rule of law, both nationally and \r\ninternationally. We have full confidence in the work \r\nbeing done by the Sixth Committee, whose role cannot \r\nbe replaced by high-level committees, groups of experts \r\nor forums outside the Assembly, which is the highest \r\nlegislative body of the Organization and the only \r\ninternational forum whose purview allows it to lead the \r\nprocess of developing and strengthening the rule of law.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the f loor to His Excellency Mr. Pierre Moukoko \r\nMbonjo, Minister for External Relations of Cameroon.\r\nMr. Moukoko Mbonjo (Cameroon) (spoke in \r\nFrench): I take the f loor on behalf of the President \r\nof our Republic, His Excellency Mr. Paul Biya, \r\nwhom circumstances have unfortunately detained in \r\nCameroon. He has asked me to deliver the following \r\nmessage to the General Assembly.\r\n“I would first like to thank the President of \r\nthe General Assembly for convening this High-\r\nlevel Meeting on the Rule of Law at the National \r\nand International Levels. I would also like to \r\nwelcome Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s efforts \r\nin this important area, and particularly the report \r\nhe delivered at the Assembly’s sixty-third session \r\n(A/63/226).\r\n“Seven years after the 2005 World Summit, our \r\nmeeting today gives us the opportunity to evaluate \r\nand reaffirm our joint commitment concerning \r\nthe issue of the rule of law at the national and \r\ninternational levels, as a fundamental value of the \r\nOrganization. In the light of the many political crises \r\nthat have recently rocked the world, particularly in \r\nAfrica, the concept of the rule of law has become a \r\nmatter of special concern for States emerging from \r\nconflict. In that regard, we are seeing an ongoing \r\nsearch in which every country, including those of \r\nthe Old World, is engaged.\r\n“Intimately linked to the respect for human \r\nrights and the equality of all before the law, the rule \r\nof law today has become part of what determines \r\nthe legitimacy of public power. However, it should \r\nnot be confused with a simple instrument for the \r\npolitical and legal protection of the individual; it \r\nmust also be seen as a way of enriching humankind \r\npolitically, economically and socially. We must \r\nnever forget that one of the greatest injustices a \r\nperson can endure is to be unable to feed or clothe \r\nhimself, to find shelter, to be cared for or live in \r\nsafety. In a word, the first function of the rule of \r\nlaw is to act as a defence for individuals against \r\nbeing deprived of the basic requirements for human \r\ndignity.\r\n6 12-51951\r\nA/67/PV.5\r\n“We must also keep in mind that the full \r\nprotection of individual rights and freedoms \r\nis impossible except through the principle of \r\nindivisibility and an equitable application of all \r\nhuman rights, including civil and political rights, \r\neconomic, social and cultural rights and the right \r\nto development. In our view, that is the correct \r\nperspective to guide the actions of the United \r\nNations and Member States in promoting the rule of \r\nlaw at the national and international levels.\r\n“The track record of the Organization shows that \r\nit is increasing its actions at the international level. \r\nIt is in the interest of the international community \r\nfor the United Nations not only to recommit to the \r\nfounding principles of the Charter but also to stress \r\nthe obligation of States to abide by international \r\nlaw. The United Nations should promote equality \r\nbefore the law, both nationally and internationally. \r\nIt is in everyone’s interest for States not to approach \r\ninternational law by means of the unequal exercise \r\nof power.\r\n“It would be paradoxical for the community of \r\nnations to work to sow democracy and the rule of \r\nlaw in the internal political and judicial workings \r\nof States while ignoring those values in its own \r\ninternational intervention mechanisms. From that \r\npoint of view, the much-anticipated reform of the \r\nSecurity Council takes on a crucial urgency. We \r\nshould recall that one potential source of dysfunction \r\nat the national and international levels is the lack of, \r\nor disregard for, regulatory mechanisms. The best \r\nway to ensure the primacy of international law in the \r\nsettlement of disputes, which is the special theme \r\nof this session, and more generally in relations \r\namong States, lies in strengthening the International \r\nCourt of Justice. The 2005 World Summit Outcome \r\n(resolution 60/1) focused on the important role of \r\nthe principal judiciary organ of the United Nations \r\nand urged all countries that had not yet done so \r\nto accept its jurisdiction. The International Court \r\nof Justice plays a critical role in consolidating the \r\nrule of law internationally. It is a principle to which \r\nwe attach great significance, as evidenced by our \r\nhandling of the Bakassi peninsula dispute.\r\n“In Cameroon the rule of law is tied to both \r\nindividual and collective development, as shown in \r\nour adoption and implementation of development \r\nprogrammes and policies that are both ambitious and \r\nrealizable, alongside promoting democratic values \r\nin our sociopolitical life. In the sphere of political \r\ninstitutions, we tirelessly pursue democratization, \r\nwith an eye to fostering pluralism and citizen \r\nparticipation at all levels of public affairs. We are \r\nalso continuing to bolster civil liberties, especially \r\nfreedom of the press and other media.\r\n“As for good governance and the fight against \r\ncorruption and embezzlement, we are strengthening \r\nour efforts to stabilize and clean up the public \r\nsector. Finally, in the realm of economic and social \r\ndevelopment, we are engaged in a programme for \r\nmajor works, working to fulfil the economic rights \r\nof our citizens. Cameroon reaffirms its chosen path \r\nof peace and stability, without which any attempt \r\nto enact the rule of law is meaningless. without the \r\nrule of law there can be no human dignity.”\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the f loor to His Excellency Mr. Arnold Nicholson, \r\nDeputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nand Trade of Jamaica.\r\nMr. Nicholson (Jamaica): The Government of \r\nJamaica welcomes the initiative of the United Nations \r\nin convening this High-level Meeting on the Rule of \r\nLaw at the National and International Levels, given the \r\nacknowledged importance of the subject at both the \r\nnational and the international levels. History has shown \r\nthat being faithful to the primacy of the rule of law is \r\na sine qua non for proper democratic practices in the \r\nsearch for a just and peaceful society and, by extension, \r\ngeopolitical stability.\r\nThe Jamaican Constitution came into effect 50 \r\nyears ago on the occasion of our independence. It is \r\nthe highest law in Jamaica and it is the very foundation \r\non which our value systems and ideals are built. \r\nThe Constitution treats a number of time-honoured \r\ndemocratic fundamentals, such as citizenship, basic \r\nhuman rights and freedoms and the three branches \r\nof Government, the executive, the legislative and \r\nthe judiciary. Full adherence to, and the effective \r\nprotection of, the rights enshrined in those provisions \r\nare crucial to upholding the rule of law at the national \r\nlevel. In recognition of that, we have amended Chapter \r\nIII of our Constitution, which contained provisions on \r\nfundamental rights and freedoms, and replaced it with \r\na more comprehensive Charter of Fundamental Rights \r\nand Freedoms. That Charter, which came into effect in \r\nApril 2011, now provides for a more modern approach to \r\ncertain fundamental freedoms, as well as to established \r\ncivil and political rights.\r\n12-51951 7\r\nA/67/PV.5\r\nWe remain mindful that the rule of law is not \r\nrestricted to the national level. The foundation \r\nprinciples of justice, fairness, accountability and \r\ntransparency are inextricably linked to its effective \r\nenforcement at the international level. To that end, \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations represents a body of \r\nprinciples, which we all solemnly pledged to uphold \r\nupon becoming a part of the Organization. Those \r\nprinciples speak to the sovereign equality of all its \r\nMembers and the development of friendly relations \r\namong nations, based on respect for the principle of \r\nequal rights. They beckon us to refrain from the use or \r\nthreat of force and to settle disputes by peaceful means, \r\nto promote and encourage respect for human rights and \r\nfor fundamental freedoms and to foster international \r\ncooperation in facing international challenges of an \r\neconomic, social, cultural or humanitarian nature.\r\nThe Government of Jamaica is of the view that a \r\nstrengthened General Assembly and the continued \r\nreform of the Security Council will contribute in a more \r\npositive manner to the advancement of the rule of law at \r\nthe international level. In that regard, we are convinced \r\nthat a more representative, efficient, accessible and \r\ntransparent Security Council will further enhance both \r\nthe effectiveness and the legitimacy of the Council.\r\nIn my own country we face the ever-strengthening \r\nchallenge of armed violence that is linked to the illicit \r\ntrade in small arms and light weapons and the illegal \r\ndrug trade. The threat posed by organized crime not \r\nonly attacks the sovereignty of the State but constrains \r\nour capacity to protect civilians. That therefore has \r\nimmediate implications for our ability to uphold the rule \r\nof law.\r\nInternational cooperation and assistance, then, are \r\ncrucial in allowing countries to meet their own national \r\nobjectives that are inherent in upholding the rule of law. \r\nThose include the implementation of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and enhanced cooperation with our \r\nbilateral partners.\r\nThe complex nature of, and the increase in, highly \r\nsophisticated illegal activities, such as cybercrime, \r\nhave underscored the importance of compliance with \r\ninternational obligations, including those related to \r\nterrorism, narco-trafficking and organized criminal \r\nenterprise. In addition, however, technical assistance is \r\nneeded to tackle those and other new challenges, such \r\nas those related to financial crimes.\r\nIn conclusion, we urge the United Nations to \r\nsustain its engagement on those issues in an inclusive \r\nand transparent manner. We pledge our commitment to \r\nupholding the rule of law at the national level and to \r\nworking with our partners at the bilateral, regional and \r\ninternational levels in what inevitably must be a global \r\nendeavour.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the f loor to His Excellency Mr. Mourad Medelci, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria.\r\nMr. Medelci (Algeria) (spoke in French): The theme \r\nof the rule of law at the national and international levels, \r\nwhich brings us together today, gives us an opportunity \r\nto renew our common ambition to give priority to \r\nthe preeminence of the rule of law. This meeting is \r\nan opportunity to reaffirm our desire to strengthen \r\ninternational law and the universal principles and \r\nobjectives of the Charter, which are the basis of the \r\ninternational system.\r\nAlgeria is prepared to make its contribution to that \r\ncommunity of the future, enriched by the diversity \r\nof our national realities, which enshrine the equality \r\nof large and small countries in participating in \r\nmultilateral deliberations. The new challenges of this \r\nperiod of transition emphasize the urgency of putting \r\nat the centre of our concerns the imperatives of justice, \r\ndevelopment, responsibility and accountability. We \r\nall know that improving the rule of law is a perpetual \r\nrequirement. Without that, impunity, injustice and \r\nthe policy of double standards will continue to erode \r\nthe moral authority of the multilateral system and of \r\ninternational law.\r\nFrom that standpoint, the General Assembly must \r\nrearrange its prerogatives and the Security Council \r\nmust be democratized. Likewise, there has to be \r\nmore coordination between the United Nations and \r\nmultilateral institutions in the economic and financial \r\nareas. In that regard, Algeria deplores the lack of a \r\nsettlement to the Palestinian problems, which are more \r\nthan 60 years old. That failure acutely demands the \r\napplication of the right to self-determination, a cardinal \r\nprinciple of the Charter and a legitimate aspiration \r\nof the Palestinian people. The same applies to the \r\nSaharaoui people.\r\nFurthermore, the rule of law cannot accommodate \r\nhateful and xenophobic manifestations, which in \r\nparticular include the phenomenon of Islamophobia. \r\nConsequently, how can we accept that the freedom of \r\n8 12-51951\r\nA/67/PV.5\r\nnations, which is valid alike for war and in war”, thereby \r\nlaying the foundation of modern international law. I do \r\nnot quote Grotius without reason. The Netherlands has \r\ncontributed to international law for centuries. In 1899 \r\nand 1907, The Hague Peace Conferences were held, and \r\nnot long afterwards the Peace Palace opened its doors. \r\nInternational law is practised in the Netherlands to this \r\nvery day in the Peace Palace, as well as in many other \r\ninternational courts and tribunals.\r\nPromoting international law is dear to our \r\nhearts. As an open society and an open economy, the \r\nNetherlands depends upon a strong international order, \r\nand therefore we do need the rule of law.\r\nChallenging impunity is a vital part of promoting \r\nthe rule of law. It is important that the perpetrators of \r\ncrimes against humanity be held to account, regardless \r\nof their positions — whether they are heads of State \r\nor other prominent people. The recent sentencing of \r\nformer head of State Charles Taylor by the Special Court \r\nfor Sierra Leone demonstrates that the international \r\ncommunity has made great progress in this area.\r\nIt is preferable to prosecute perpetrators in the \r\ncountry where crimes were committed; but if a State \r\nis unable or unwilling to do so, the duty falls on the \r\ninternational community. We therefore firmly support \r\nthe International Criminal Court, and we call upon \r\nStates to ratify the Rome Statute. The Netherlands \r\nalso supports effective investigation and prosecution \r\nof international crimes at the national level. Therefore, \r\ntogether with Belgium and Slovenia, we will launch an \r\ninitiative for a new international instrument on mutual \r\nlegal assistance and extradition.\r\nThe Netherlands is firmly committed to the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes. The International \r\nCourt of Justice, for instance, certainly needs to be \r\nstrengthened through the universal acceptance of \r\ncompulsory jurisdiction. The Government of the \r\nNetherlands therefore supports the campaign launched \r\nby the Secretary-General in his rule of law report last \r\nMarch (A/66/749).\r\nWe are also promoting the rule of law at home \r\nby establishing in the Netherlands a new institute for \r\nhuman rights to further promote the cause of the rule \r\nof law.\r\nIn the Netherlands we continue to take seriously \r\nthe importance of the rule of law. Former Secretary-\r\nGeneral Boutros Boutros-Ghali was the first to call The \r\nHague “the legal capital of the world”, and we are proud \r\nexpression dear to us all is set up as an end in itself, \r\nin the name of which defamatory acts are authorized \r\nagainst religions, including Islam? Algeria suggests \r\nthat a mechanism be established under United Nations \r\nauspices to examine the ways and means to put \r\nan end to such tendencies and to make sure that the \r\nfreedom of expression will be at the service of mutual \r\ncomprehension and the advent of a more united and \r\nfraternal world.\r\nUrgent and effective solutions are also required \r\nto address the new transnational threats. Algeria is \r\nworking with the countries of the Sahel to strengthen \r\nthe rule of law, security and peace in the region. \r\nRegional cooperation has been undertaken to combat \r\nunderdevelopment, corruption and terrorist groups and \r\ntheir interconnections with organized crime networks.\r\nAt the national level, Algeria, encouraged by the \r\ngains of the national reconciliation policy, is confidently \r\npursuing its reform programme to establish democracy \r\nand the promotion of fundamental rights, including \r\nthe participation of women in decision-making. In that \r\ncontext, pride of place is given to schools, which of all \r\npublic services specifically help to train citizens.\r\nIn Algeria the enjoyment of political freedoms is \r\nenhanced by the equitable redistribution of wealth. The \r\nprotection of democracy is also ensured by the State’s \r\nhelp for citizens in need.\r\nI should like to congratulate the President and \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for organizing \r\nthis High-level Meeting on an extremely important \r\ntheme, the results of which will certainly contribute \r\nto consolidating the rule of law nationally and \r\ninternationally.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the f loor to His Excellency Mr. Uri Rosenthal, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of the \r\nNetherlands.\r\nMr. Rosenthal (Netherlands): Early this morning, \r\nwe had a side event on the peaceful settlement of disputes, \r\nwith the participation of, among others, the President \r\nof the International Court of Justice and the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the Permanent Court of Arbitration. The \r\nside event was attended by many people who share the \r\ncommon notion that the peaceful settlement of disputes \r\nis an important part of the promotion of the rule of law.\r\nDutch legal scholar Hugo Grotius was far ahead of his \r\ntime. In 1625 he wrote, “There is a common law among \r\n12-51951 9\r\nA/67/PV.5\r\nthe Security Council adapt the mandate of the United \r\nNations Organization Stabilization Mission in the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, whose activity we \r\nwelcome, to the realities and needs on the ground.\r\nThe accomplishments of the Democratic Republic \r\nof the Congo in promoting the rule of law include the \r\nfollowing.\r\nThe Congolese Government held a referendum \r\nleading to the adoption of the Constitution of 18 February \r\n2006, which lays the foundation for the reform of our \r\njustice system as the engine for restoring the rule of law, \r\naffirms the independence of the judiciary, and defines a \r\nnew organization of Congolese justice. In addition, more \r\nspecifically, that reform seeks to promote and encourage \r\nthe implementation of judicial policy through improved \r\naccess to justice, a stronger framework for promoting \r\nand protecting human rights, enhanced capacities, and \r\nimproved performance of actors in the justice system \r\nand the fight against corruption and impunity.\r\nMoreover, the Democratic Republic of the Congo \r\nhas ratified almost all international treaties on human \r\nrights and, since 1999, has had in place a national plan \r\nfor the promotion and protection of human rights, \r\nwhich was updated in 2009. Along the same lines, at \r\nan institutional level, the Congolese Government has \r\nestablished a human rights liaison entity.\r\nWith respect to the promotion of women’s rights, \r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo has ratified \r\nthe Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of \r\nDiscrimination against Women and has adhered to the \r\nBeijing Programme of Action. It also has a national \r\nprogramme to promote Congolese women, a national \r\ngender policy and an action plan to combat gender-\r\nbased and sexual violence.\r\nWith respect to the promotion and protection of \r\nchildren’s rights, on 10 January 2009 the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo enacted a law to protect children \r\nthrough the creation of courts for children, whose \r\ninstallation commenced in 2011.\r\nWith regard to promoting democracy, the \r\nConstitution adopted by referendum on 19 December \r\n2005 enabled the successful holding of the first general \r\nelections, on 30 July 2006, which were free, transparent \r\nand democratic, with a term that expired in November \r\n2011.\r\nAs for transnational organized crime, the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo has ratified a number \r\nof that. Next August, the Peace Palace in The Hague \r\nwill celebrate its centennial. To mark that milestone, \r\nthe Netherlands will organize a meeting to promote \r\nand advance the peaceful settlement of disputes, thus \r\nshowing the world that we still want to play a leading \r\nrole in promoting international law, as we did when \r\nHugo Grotius wrote his famous work On the Law of \r\nWar and Peace so many centuries ago.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now give \r\nthe f loor to Her Excellency Wivine Mumba, Minister of \r\nJustice and Human Rights of the Democratic Republic \r\nof the Congo.\r\nMs. Mumba (Democratic Republic of the Congo) \r\n(spoke in French): In preparing for this meeting, the \r\nSecretary-General said in his report that “Respect for \r\nthe rule of law at the international and national levels is \r\ncentral to ensuring the predictability and legitimacy of \r\ninternational relations, and for delivering just outcomes \r\nin the daily life of all individuals” (A/66/749, summary). \r\nHow then can one not condemn the disrespect by \r\none State for the intangible principles of the national \r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of another State, \r\nespecially when the result is to prevent the latter from \r\nfirmly establishing the rule of law?\r\nThe presence of Rwanda in the east of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo is therefore doubly \r\nto be condemned, because it violates international law \r\nand undermines the progress made in promoting the \r\nrule of law in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. \r\nIt has triggered the massive displacement of whole \r\ngroups of people, in particular of women and children, \r\nand has caused the resurgence of massive human \r\nrights violations, including the recruitment of child \r\nsoldiers and acts of violence against women such as the \r\nabduction of women and girls by armed groups, who \r\nforce them into sexual slavery, which infects them with \r\nHIV/AIDS and causes a surge in atrocities of every \r\ntype, comparable to war crimes and crimes against \r\nhumanity. In any case, the seriousness of the crimes \r\ndemands an appropriate legal response. However, the \r\nresponse to this situation requires concerted action by \r\nthe Congolese State and the international community.\r\nAs the Secretary-General has said, it is the \r\nresponsibility of Member States and their citizens to \r\nstrengthen the rule of law. The United Nations is ideally \r\npositioned to uphold the action of its Member States and \r\nto offer comprehensive and effective support. In practice, \r\nin order for that support to be truly comprehensive and \r\neffective, it is imperative that the United Nations and \r\n10 12-51951\r\nA/67/PV.5\r\nof international instruments to combat terrorism \r\nand transnational organized crime and is currently \r\nreviewing a number of laws, including the law on the \r\nfight against money-laundering and the financing of \r\nterrorism, as well as one on combating corruption.\r\nIn the light of what I have mentioned, the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo is contributing to \r\npromoting the rule of law by adhering to the primary \r\njudicial instruments of the United Nations and its own \r\ninternal plans for reform. In line with that policy, the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo has made a series of \r\ncommitments.\r\nWe are accelerating the legislative reforms \r\ncurrently under consideration, in particular those \r\nregarding compensation to the victims of sexual \r\nviolence, implementation modalities for women’s rights \r\nand equality, and the modification and repeal of certain \r\ndiscriminatory provisions of the family code.\r\nWe are accelerating the adoption of the draft \r\nlegislation on establishing a national human rights \r\ncommision. We are reactivating a moratorium on \r\nthe death penalty, reducing duration of preventive \r\ndetention, formalizing the procedure of presidential \r\nclemency, and reducing the number of crimes for which \r\nthe death penalty can be imposed. We are making \r\na commitment to sign, jointly with the special team \r\nof the United Nations, an action plan to combat the \r\nrecruitment and use of children as well as other grave \r\nviolations of the rights of children by armed groups and \r\nsecurity services. We are establishing machinery and \r\na strategy to combat corruption. We are implementing \r\nthe Rome Statute in the context of the International \r\nCriminal Court.\r\nIn so doing, the ongoing reform process of our legal \r\nsystem shows that the Democratic Republic of Congo \r\nremains determined to establish and maintain a system \r\nof justice that is fair, reliable, moral and effective, in \r\naccordance with the Charter of the United Nations and \r\ninternational law, so as to support the principles of a \r\npermanent rule of law.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the f loor to His Excellency Mr. Dato Sri Anifa \r\nAman, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Malaysia.\r\nMr. Aman (Malaysia): On 13 September 2006, \r\nthe General Assembly decided to include in its agenda \r\nan item entitled “The rule of law at the national and \r\ninternational levels” with the broad support of all \r\nMember States.\r\nToday, we convene the inaugural High-level \r\nMeeting on the Rule of Law, which reflects our resolve \r\nto strengthen the rule of law at both the national and the \r\ninternational levels.\r\nI wish to thank the President of the General \r\nAssembly for convening this important meeting. I \r\nalso wish to align my statement with that made by the \r\nrepresentative of Thailand on behalf of the Association \r\nof South-East Asian Nations.\r\nThe Declaration (resolution 67/1) that we adopted \r\nearlier today symbolizes our collective commitments \r\nto strengthening the rule of law in areas of mutual \r\ninterest, such as ending impunity for violations of \r\ninternational humanitarian and human rights laws, as \r\nwell as democracy, justice and human rights, among \r\nothers. There is a symbiotic relationship between the \r\nrule of law at the national and international levels; we \r\nmust thereforefore ensure that equal emphasis is given \r\nto both.\r\nAt the domestic level, Malaysia believes that \r\nStates must, among other things, honour international \r\nobligations in good faith, ensure the domestic \r\nimplementation of their international obligations, \r\npromote and protect human rights and fundamental \r\nfreedoms, and ensure the effective administration of \r\njustice.\r\nAllow me to share some of our initiatives in \r\nstrengthening the rule of law at the national level. The \r\nfoundation of the rule of law in Malaysia is its federal \r\nConstitution, which is the supreme law of our nation. \r\nBased on the fundamentals therein, Malaysia continues \r\nto take measures to enhance and improve its laws, using \r\nthe principles of democracy, equality before the law \r\nand the rules of natural justice.\r\nThis year, the Internal Security Act of 1960 \r\nwas repealed and replaced by the Security Offences \r\nSpecial Measures Act of 2012. Changes that have \r\ntaken place in the country over the past decade do \r\nnot justify the continued application of the older law. \r\nThat demonstrates that, while the Government remains \r\ncommitted to ensuring that security is constantly \r\nsafeguarded, the rights of the people are upheld. The \r\nGovernment has also enacted a Peaceful Assembly Act \r\nof 2011, which was done to ensure adequate and proper \r\nregulations regarding the right to peaceful assembly, as \r\nenshrined in the federal Constitution. In upholding the \r\nrule of law, there is a delicate balance between safety \r\nand security, on the one hand, and rights and freedom, \r\n12-51951 11\r\nA/67/PV.5\r\nthe violators are. No one should be above the law. \r\nFurthermore, for situations involving crimes, such \r\nas genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes \r\nand serious and gross violations of international \r\nhumanitarian and human rights laws, the exercise of the \r\nveto in the Security Council should be avoided. Only \r\nthen can we effectively stop those crimes from being \r\ncommitted, stop impunity, uphold the rule of law and \r\nmake the United Nations relevant and effective.\r\nMalaysia highly values this meeting and believes \r\nthat it advances our agenda on the rule of law. The \r\ninternational community, through the United Nations, \r\nmust continue to lead the way for nations to follow.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the f loor to His Excellency Mr. Kim Sung-hwan, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic \r\nof Korea.\r\nMr. Kim Sung-hwan (Republic of Korea): Ever \r\nsince global leaders made a landmark commitment to \r\nthe rule of law at the 2005 World Summit, we have \r\nwitnessed an increase in the promotion of the rule of \r\nlaw at both the national and the international levels. \r\nIn that respect, the Republic of Korea welcomes and \r\nembraces the efforts made by the United Nations to \r\nstrengthen its role in ensuring the rule of law. I wish to \r\ntake this opportunity to convey my deep appreciation \r\nto Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his continuing \r\nefforts to that end.\r\nIt is well known that there are divergent views \r\nand understandings about the concept of the rule of \r\nlaw, including formalistic and substantive definitions. \r\nDespite such diversity, however, we are convinced \r\nthat the rule of law should be deeply rooted in certain \r\nessential elements, such as justice, morality, territorial \r\nintegrity and sovereignty. Without due consideration \r\nof those elements, the rule of law can be abused as a \r\npretext for the strong to impose their will upon the \r\nweak, which we have all too often witnessed in the past \r\namong States.\r\nWe wish to stress that the rule of law applies to \r\nall States equally. Respect for and the promotion of the \r\nrule of law and justice should be the guiding principles \r\nfor stable international relations. As such, we recognize \r\nthe important contributions that the United Nations, \r\nincluding the International Court of Justice, has made in \r\npromoting the rule of law. In particular, and in the light \r\nof the critical role that the Court plays in that area, we \r\nare of the view that the Court should continue to reflect \r\non the other. That is what the legislation aims to \r\nachieve. Laws cannot be broken under the pretext that \r\none is exercising fundamental rights. That certainly \r\ngoes against the very notion of the rule of law.\r\nStates have legal obligations to abide by international \r\ntreaties and conventions, based on the fundamental \r\nprinciple of pacta sunt servanda. Treaties are binding \r\non the parties to them and must be performed in good \r\nfaith. That obligation also extends to the national \r\nlevel. Treaty obligations should be transformed or \r\nincorporated into domestic legal systems. Malaysia \r\nensures that its international treaty obligations are \r\ntransformed into necessary legislation, policies and \r\naction plans to fulfil treaty obligations. That is how we \r\nensure domestic compliance with international treaties \r\nand uphold the rule of law.\r\nThere may not be one single definition for the \r\nrule of law, but there are certain core elements that we \r\ncan identify. At the international level, for instance, \r\nmany of those elements are important principles of \r\ninternational law. Malaysia attaches importance to \r\nthe following in strengthening the rule of law at the \r\ninternational level: the commitment to an international \r\norder based on international law; the obligation of \r\nthe international community to enforce international \r\nlaw in a non-selective manner; the duty of all States \r\nto refrain from the threat or use of force and to settle \r\ndisputes by peaceful means; and respect for the \r\nprinciples of sovereign equality, territorial integrity \r\nand non-interference.\r\nClear examples of the importance of strengthening \r\nthe rule of law at the international level are situations \r\nwhere there have been persistent violations of \r\ninternational law. We need to put an end to impunity \r\nand hold those responsible accountable for their \r\nactions. Big or small, strong or weak, the rule of law \r\nshall apply to all. There will be no meaning in our \r\nefforts if there are no tangible outcomes to address \r\nthose types of situations. In that regard, the inclusion \r\nof strong language on ending impunity for violations \r\nof international humanitarian law and gross violations \r\nof human rights laws in the Declaration is very \r\nappropriate. However, for it to work, action must be in \r\nconformity with international law and the decisions of \r\nthe United Nations.\r\nWhat do we do when those responsible continue \r\nto violate international law and ignore United Nations \r\ndecisions? The United Nations should take a decision \r\non non-compliance and enforce it, regardless who \r\n12 12-51951\r\nA/67/PV.5\r\nMr. Lavrynovych (Ukraine): Ukraine welcomes \r\nthis High-level Meeting of the General Assembly, the \r\nfirst in United Nations history to be dedicated to the \r\nimportant issue of the rule of law at the national and \r\ninternational levels.\r\nUkraine believes that respect for the rule of law at \r\nthe international level is the basis of international peace \r\nand stability, a key precondition for the prevention and \r\nsettlement of conflicts, and a guarantee of predictability \r\nand legitimacy in international relations.\r\nIn that regard, Ukraine emphasizes the need to \r\nenhance the role and effectiveness of international \r\njudicial bodies in addressing issues related to \r\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes. After all, the \r\neffectiveness of such mechanisms is, in our opinion, the \r\nkey to their increasingly widespread use by members of \r\nthe international community and an important factor in \r\nstrengthening the rule of law at the international level.\r\nUkraine is moving steadily along the path of \r\nreforms aimed at strengthening the rule of law at \r\nthe national level. Furthermore, the rule of law as a \r\nprinciple is stipulated in the Constitution of Ukraine. \r\nUnfortunately, Ukraine has become a frequent subject \r\nof criticism by certain international organizations \r\nand Governments with regard to compliance with that \r\nprinciple. However, in the past few years a number of \r\nsteps have been taken to establish guarantees of the \r\nrule of law in different areas.\r\nIn that regard, I would mention public administration \r\nreform, judicial reform, large-scale anti-corruption \r\nprogrammes and comprehensive criminal procedure \r\nreform, which was a crucial challenge for the Ukrainian \r\nauthorities for years.\r\nThe steps taken by the Ukrainian authorities aimed \r\nat achieving maximum openness and transparency in \r\nthe decision-making process are reflected not only in \r\nnational legislative initiatives but also in the voluntary \r\ninternational commitments of our country, such as \r\nour participation in the international initiative “Open \r\nGovernment Partnership”.\r\nToday we reaffirm the determination of Ukrainian \r\nleaders to fulfil the commitments made by Ukraine \r\nin the field of ensuring effective methods of public \r\nadministration, promoting equal access to justice for \r\nall, fighting corruption and involving civil society in \r\nthe process of defining and implementing State policy.\r\nthe legal diversity of the international community. \r\nFurthermore, we believe that no State should ever take \r\nadvantage of international legal procedures for political \r\npurposes.\r\nWe have been a strong supporter of full compliance \r\nwith and the progressive development of international \r\nlaw. Korea has been serving in various international legal \r\nbodies, including the International Law Commission, \r\nthe International Criminal Court and the International \r\nTribunal for the Law of the Sea. Furthermore, we are \r\nfully committed to continuing our contributions to \r\nvarious rule-of-law initiatives for disseminating and \r\npromoting a wider appreciation of the rule of law.\r\nWithout a doubt, respect for the law in the \r\ninternational sphere should also be reinforced and \r\ncomplemented by a commitment to the rule of law at the \r\nnational level. Peace, democracy, good governance and \r\nsustainable development will not be possible without \r\ndue respect for the rule of law. The principle of legality, \r\nan independent judiciary, respect for human rights and \r\naccess to justice for all are also at the very core of the \r\nrule of law at the national level.\r\nMy country has been able to achieve material \r\ndemocracy, economic development and the \r\nenhancement of human rights in less than half a \r\ncentury. That would not have been possible without our \r\nresolute commitment and strenuous efforts to foster \r\nand reinforce the principle of the rule of law.\r\nThe rule of law has served as a check against \r\nthe abuse of power and the arbitrary application of \r\nlaws. It has helped raise awareness of peoples about \r\ndemocratic values and fundamental rights. For Korea, \r\nthe rule of law has been instrumental in establishing \r\nan environment in which entrepreneurship can grow \r\nand f lourish. Higher education and an efficient public \r\nsector have also been key contributing factors to the \r\nrule of law, taking deep root within our society.\r\nFinally, I would like to stress that the objectives \r\nof the rule of law can be achieved only through active \r\ncoordination and cooperation among all relevant actors, \r\nincluding States, international organizations and civil \r\nsociety. We will continue to support the efforts of the \r\ninternational community to enhance the rule of law at \r\nthe national and international levels.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I \r\nnow give the f loor to His Excellency Mr. Oleksandr \r\nLavrynovych, Minister for Justice of Ukraine.\r\n12-51951 13\r\nA/67/PV.5\r\nIf the rule of law breaks down or becomes \r\ninequitable, the balance of international peace and \r\nsecurity among the international community will be \r\ndisrupted. It is therefore pointless to seek to promote \r\nthe rule of law only at the national level or at the \r\ninternational level. Rather, it should be strengthened \r\nand promoted at all levels.\r\nToday, we must seek to restore confidence in the \r\nrule of law, especially at the international level. It is not \r\neasy to stress the rule of law from the perspective of \r\nan international community that is ruled by force and \r\nconflicting interests. Indeed, events and practices that \r\nundermine such confidence are numerous.\r\nRevisiting the achievements we have made since \r\nthe mid-twentieth century towards establishing an \r\ninternational order based on laws and the principles \r\nof international legitimacy and historical global \r\ninstruments, not least of which is the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, will restore confidence in the rule of \r\nlaw.\r\nDebating the rule of law issue is not intended \r\nmerely to uphold such a regime symbolically, but to \r\nrealize that the rule of law is crucial for achieving all of \r\nour collective goals. Those who seek peace and security \r\nshould abide by the conditions for peace and security, \r\nforemost among which is the rule of law.\r\nThose who seek to achieve development should \r\nunderstand that ensuring the rule of law is one of its \r\ncomponents. Those who strive to guarantee human \r\nrights must also establish the rule of law. While the \r\nrule of law is a prerequisite to the achievement of many \r\ngoals, achieving the rule of law requires many elements \r\nand a principled foundation.\r\nGiven that conviction, the State of Qatar has taken \r\naction at various levels and in various sectors aimed at \r\nachieving good governance, by promoting the principle \r\nof the rule of law as a tool in organizing the economic, \r\npolitical and social lives of its citizens. Hence, the rule \r\nof law has become an essential element in our national \r\nstrategy. We always strive to uphold the law, equality \r\nbefore the law, accountability under the law and justice \r\nin the application of the law.\r\nIn order to uphold the law under the wise \r\nleadership of His Highness Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa \r\nAl-Thani, Amir of the State of Qatar, a commission \r\non administrative control and transparency was \r\nestablished, fully empowered and provided with all \r\nnecessary resources to fulfil its mandate. In addition, \r\nUkraine deeply appreciates the efforts and active \r\nparticipation of the United Nations in dealing with \r\nthe wide range of global challenges facing us today, \r\nwhich range from climate change, terrorism, human \r\nrights protection and the settlement of armed conflict, \r\neach of which is closely linked to the issue of the rule \r\nof law. Thus, given the existence of that significant \r\ninternational experience, we believe that the United \r\nNations should remain the centre of international \r\nefforts to strengthen the rule of law.\r\nWe believe that in future one of the priority \r\ntasks in strengthening the rule of law should be to \r\nincrease the effectiveness of international judicial and \r\nquasi-judicial institutions. It is crucially important \r\nto give new impetus to the process of global nuclear \r\ndisarmament and the establishment of a nuclear \r\nnon-proliferation regime. To that end, one of the key \r\nelements of such a regime should be to ensure legal \r\nsecurity guarantees for States that have renounced \r\nnuclear weapons.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the f loor to His Excellency Mr. Ali Bin Fahad \r\nAl-Hajri, Minister of State for Political Affairs of Qatar.\r\nMr. Al-Hajri (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nlegitimacy of a law-abiding State is built upon the \r\nrule of law. It is clear that the broader meaning of the \r\nrule of law extends beyond mere respect for law to the \r\nsubstance of the law itself. With regard to the need to \r\nprotect human rights, therefore, national legislatures \r\nmust not breach those fundamental rights recognized as \r\nnecessary for the establishment of a law-abiding State \r\nwith democratic institutions.\r\nThere is no doubt that the supremacy of the law \r\nover the State is linked to respect for the rights \r\nand freedoms of citizens. In that regard, the Qatari \r\nConstitution confirms and guarantees many rules that \r\ncompel executive authorities to ensure the protection of \r\nvarious rights and freedoms, in order that no individual \r\nauthority might encroach upon or interfere with the \r\npublic domain of guaranteed fundamental human \r\nrights.\r\nThe situation at both the national and the \r\ninternational levels should not differ. Relations among \r\nStates should be subjected, as a matter of equity, to \r\nthe rule of law. The political discourse of States must \r\ncoincide with the provisions of international law and \r\nall of its guarantees of the human rights and freedoms \r\nof peoples.\r\n14 12-51951\r\nA/67/PV.5\r\nThrough successful work in Australia’s own region, \r\nwe have sought to assist our neighbours in Papua New \r\nGuinea, Solomon Islands and Timor-Leste to build \r\ntheir own lasting and enforceable rule of law cultures. \r\nAs chair-in-office of the Commonwealth of Nations, \r\nan organization comprised of fully one third of all of \r\nthe world’s peoples, Australia recognizes the strong \r\ncommitment of all of the nations of the Commonwealth \r\nto the rule of law as a core value.\r\nThe rule of law is inextricably linked to the three \r\npillars of the United Nations — security, development \r\nand human rights, which are the high ideals that guide \r\nour efforts to achieve practical progress. Delivering \r\ntraining for courts, correctional services, police and \r\nother justice agencies; assisting with legal, judicial \r\nand constitutional reforms; and ensuring free and easy \r\naccess of civilian populations to legal information to \r\nhelp secure their rights — none of that can be taken \r\nfor granted. It requires sustained commitment and the \r\nsharing of hard-won lessons.\r\nAustralia is pleased to be able to do all of that \r\nthrough the United Nations and its Peacebuilding \r\nCommission, including as part of the Burundi, Sierra \r\nLeone and Liberia country-specific configurations.\r\nSupport for the rule of law is also a central part \r\nof Australia’s development assistance programme. \r\nWe have dedicated more than $300 million this year \r\nto helping strengthen the rule of law in developing \r\ncountries, and by 2016 we will have trained 14,000 \r\nlaw and justice officials. Australia recognizes that \r\nthe rule of law is itself a vital condition for extending \r\nfreedom, expanding development, preventing conflict \r\nand building peace. When all those efforts fail — and, \r\nin the worst cases, when atrocities are committed — the \r\nrule of law ensures that impunity does not prevail.\r\nLet us therefore ensure that the work of this High-\r\nlevel Meeting leads to practical progress towards \r\nthe highest ideals of the United Nations for security, \r\ndevelopment and human rights for all the peoples of the \r\nworld.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the f loor to His Excellency Archbishop Dominique \r\nMamberti, Secretary for Relations with States of the \r\nObserver State of the Holy See.\r\nArchbishop Mamberti (Holy See): I would like to \r\nbegin by expressing our appreciation for the references \r\nin the Secretary-General’s report (A/66/749) and in \r\nthe Declaration adopted this morning (resolution 67/1) \r\nthe third Conference of the States Parties to the United \r\nNations Convention against Corruption was hosted in \r\nDoha, and a rule of law and anti-corruption centre has \r\nbeen opened in that city.\r\nThe State of Qatar continues to develop its laws \r\nand regulations, to join international conventions \r\nand to promote a culture of respect for national and \r\ninternational law, through seminars, workshops and \r\nother means.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the f loor to His Excellency Mr. Richard Marles, \r\nParliamentary Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs of \r\nAustralia.\r\nMr. Marles (Australia): The rule of law is the \r\nhighest and best guarantee of the freedom and dignity \r\nof all people. It protects people from the arbitrary \r\nuse of power and gives victims access to justice. It \r\nprovides the transparency necessary for business and \r\nthe protection of property. It ensures that disputes can \r\nbe resolved fairly and peacefully.\r\nSustainable peace especially needs trusted and \r\ncredible institutions, processes and Governments. In \r\nturn, development and long-term peacebuilding require \r\nconfidence in the rule of law. Only then can human \r\nliberty f lourish.\r\nAustralia understands that today, just as we did in \r\n1948 when our then Foreign Minister, Mr. H. V. Evatt, \r\npresided over the General Assembly as it adopted the \r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights.\r\nIn Australia, our commitment to the rule of law \r\nunderpins our social stability and our prosperity. We \r\nvalue those concepts so deeply that our whole national \r\nethos is based upon a universal ideal of equality and \r\nopportunity, which in the Australian vernacular is \r\nknown simply as “a fair go”.\r\nSadly, as an international community we too often \r\nsee the terrible price paid by ordinary people when \r\nthe rule of law breaks down. We see people made \r\nvulnerable to disadvantage and discrimination. We see \r\ncommunities that do not trust their police, courts or, \r\nindeed, their leaders. And we see development held \r\nback owing to conflict and insecurity.\r\nOver many years, Australia has worked to \r\nstrengthen the rule of law in conflict-affected societies. \r\nSince we joined the first peacekeepers in 1947, 65,000 \r\nAustralians have served on more than 50 United Nations \r\nand multilateral peace and security operations.\r\n12-51951 15\r\nA/67/PV.5\r\nmay, however, be grasped by philosophical reasoning, \r\na process whereby we ask ourselves about the meaning \r\nof human existence and the universe, and about what \r\noffers a true and solid basis for the rule of law. Faith \r\nin the transcendental dignity of the human person \r\ndoes become the fundamental and indispensable key \r\nfor understanding the rights codified in the founding \r\ndocuments of the United Nations. It offers a secure \r\nbasis for the rule of law, because it corresponds to the \r\ntruth about man as a creature of God’s making, and it \r\nallows the rule of law to pursue its true purpose: the \r\npromotion of the common good.\r\nThese conclusions lead to the unavoidable premise \r\nthat the right to life of every human being, from \r\nconception to natural death, should be considered \r\nand protected as an absolute and inalienable value. To \r\nthat right should be added all the other components of \r\nhuman rights, without distinction, as envisioned by \r\nthe principles of indivisibility and universality, thus \r\nmaking it possible to say that the integral promotion of \r\nall people, without any exception as to time or place, is \r\na true guarantee of full respect for everyone. Among \r\nthose rights, freedom of religion merits a particular \r\nmention, as the right to seek the truth in matters \r\nreligious without coercion and in full freedom of \r\nconscience. The guarantee of such freedom, apart from \r\nits actual views, is an inalienable hinge of the rule of \r\nlaw for believer and non-believer alike.\r\nThis High-level Meeting on the Rule of Law is \r\nan important opportunity to reaffirm the will to find \r\npolitical solutions, applicable at the global level, with \r\nthe aid of a juridical order solidly based on the dignity \r\nand nature of humanity. That is the best path to follow if \r\nwe wish to realize the grand designs and purpose of the \r\nUnited Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration \r\nof Human Rights.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I should \r\nnow like to consult members with a view to giving the \r\nf loor to the Chair of the United Nations Commission \r\non International Trade Law, Mr. Hrvoje Sikirić. If there \r\nis no objection, may I take it that it is the wish of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, and without setting a precedent, to \r\ninvite the Chair of the United Nations Commission on \r\nInternational Trade Law to make a statement at this \r\nmeeting?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): In \r\naccordance with the decision just taken, I now give the \r\nto the unbreakable link between the rule of law and \r\nrespect for human rights.\r\nThe Holy See wishes above all to underline the \r\nneed to go beyond the simple fixation on procedures \r\nthat guarantee a democratic basis for standards, to one \r\nthat seeks to promote true justice. On its own, formal \r\nrespect is not sufficient to guarantee the national and \r\ninternational rule of law, especially when, through the \r\nproliferation of norms and procedures, the certainty of \r\nlaw itself may be placed in jeopardy. Juridical disorder, \r\non the one hand, and anthropological jurisdiction, on \r\nthe other, compromise the ultimate and essential goal \r\nof all law: to promote and guarantee the dignity of the \r\nperson.\r\nIn order not to be reduced to a sterile tautology, to a \r\nmere rule of the rules, as Pope Benedict XVI said in his \r\nspeech to the Bundestag just a year ago, the rule of law \r\nmust be based on a unified and comprehensive vision of \r\nman, appreciative of the richness of how people relate \r\nto one another and granting certainty and stability to \r\njuridical relationships. Moreover, the concept of law \r\nshould be understood as justice — that which is just, \r\nthat which is a just thing, an element that belongs to and \r\nis inalienable from the nature of every human being, \r\nfamily and State.\r\nThe achievements and declarations of human rights \r\noffer us important points of reference in that direction, \r\nbut they are not in themselves sufficient unless they are \r\nread in the spirit in which they were formulated. Indeed, \r\nsuch declarations are the result of a lengthy juridical \r\nand political process, which began with the encounter \r\nbetween the theoretical and philosophical reasoning of \r\nGreek culture and the juridical and practical reasoning \r\nof the Romans, to which were added other elements, \r\nsuch as Judeo-Christian wisdom, the laws of other \r\nEuropean peoples, canon law and its developments, the \r\nmedieval and Renaissance work of Jewish, Arab and \r\nChristian philosophers, and, lastly, the contribution \r\nof the thinking of the Enlightenment and the political \r\ndevelopments due to the revolutions of the eighteenth \r\ncentury. It is only in the light of this complex, rich and \r\nintricate edifice, which is simultaneously historical, \r\njuridical and philosophical, that the inviolable and \r\ninalienable rights of human beings can and must be \r\nappreciated as the essence of the law, and to which the \r\nrules must refer.\r\nThe United Nations Charter underlines the need \r\nto reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights. The \r\nworld of faith usually indicates the transcendent, which \r\n16 12-51951\r\nA/67/PV.5\r\nf loor to the Chair of the United Nations Commission on \r\nInternational Trade Law.\r\nMr. Sikirić (United Nations Commission on \r\nInternational Trade Law): I thank the Assembly for \r\ngiving the United Nations Commission on International \r\nTrade Law (UNCITRAL) the opportunity to address \r\nthis meeting. At its forty-fifth annual session this \r\nsummer, UNCITRAL instructed me to transmit to this \r\naudience the following message.\r\nFirst, as the core United Nations entity in the \r\nfield of commercial law, UNCITRAL views this event \r\nas providing a unique opportunity to promote the \r\nconsideration of the rule of law from a perspective \r\nnot commonly associated with it, that is, from a \r\ncommercial and trade point of view. For UNCITRAL, \r\nits work on modernizing and harmonizing international \r\ncommercial and trade law is key to the conduct of \r\ncommercial activity on the basis of transparent and \r\npredictable rules that will assist economic development \r\nby encouraging trade and investment. In UNCITRAL’s \r\nview, the rule of law is not only about issues of public \r\ninternational law, human rights, criminal law and \r\ntransitional justice, which are clearly important. The \r\nrule of law is also about the capacity of States to mobilize \r\nresources to invest in such rule-of-law fundamentals \r\nas due process and judicial and legal infrastructure, \r\nincluding well-trained lawyers and judges. It is about \r\nthe recognition and enforcement of property rights and \r\ncontracts. It is also, of course, about guaranteeing the \r\nlegal security required to promote entrepreneurship, \r\ninvestment and job creation. That is exactly what the \r\nwork of UNCITRAL seeks to achieve.\r\nSecondly, the Commission was unanimous that any \r\noutcome document from today’s meeting should refer to \r\nthe work of UNCITRAL and recognize its contribution \r\nto promoting the rule of law in the economic field as \r\nan essential element of the promotion of the rule of \r\nlaw in the broader context. Such a desired outcome is \r\nconsistent with the General Assembly’s recognition \r\nof the multifaceted impact of UNCITRAL’s work on \r\ndevelopment, peace, stability and the well-being of all \r\npeoples — and, consequently, on the promotion of the \r\nrule of law in the broader context.\r\nThe premise is that the rule of law and economic \r\ndevelopment are mutually reinforcing. The promotion of \r\nthe rule of law in commercial relations must become, as \r\nthe General Assembly has acknowledged on numerous \r\noccasions, an integral part of the broader agenda of \r\nthe United Nations to promote the rule of law at the \r\nnational and international levels. Advancing the rule of \r\nlaw must be an inclusive and comprehensive process \r\nthat avoids focusing on only some areas of legal reform \r\nto the detriment of others that might be less visible or \r\nrequire specialized technical expertise.\r\nThirdly, recognizing that business practices are \r\nconstantly evolving in a rapidly changing world, \r\nStates must develop the capacity to modernize their \r\ncommercial laws in response to those practices, and \r\nalso establish legal environments that support and \r\nenable trade and commerce. Legislative reforms must \r\nbe accompanied by appropriate institutional reforms to \r\nensure the effective implementation and enforcement \r\nof laws.\r\nUnfortunately, experience shows that, amid \r\npressures to address other priorities, local needs for \r\ncommercial law reform are often overlooked and \r\nresources are often allocated to other areas. Those local \r\ndeficiencies are aggravated by unfilled capacity gaps \r\nin United Nations field operations. As reports of those \r\noperations suggest, the challenges posed by the need \r\nfor economic revitalization, employment generation \r\nand private sector development are often not adequately \r\nmet.\r\nUNCITRAL can rely on 20 years of experience \r\nin implementing technical assistance and capacity-\r\nbuilding programmes. Nevertheless, it cannot hope \r\nto address the constantly increasing challenges alone \r\nwith the limited resources at its disposal. Achieving the \r\neffective deployment of UNCITRAL’s modern trade \r\nlaw standards and technical expertise where they are \r\nmost needed requires the long-term involvement not \r\nonly of UNCITRAL but also of States and the United \r\nNations system as a whole, together with external \r\nassistance providers.\r\nUNCITRAL hopes that today’s High-level Meeting \r\nwill become the pivotal point in achieving increased \r\nrecognition by the international community of the \r\nessential role that effective commercial law frameworks \r\ncan play in advancing the rule of law. At stake is the \r\ncapacity of States to continue engaging in commercial \r\nlaw reform, not only at the country level but also through \r\nparticipation in regional and international bodies, \r\nthereby strengthening rule of law in the economic field.\r\nThe United Nations has the huge potential, through \r\nUNCITRAL and other entities, to respond to the \r\nneeds of States by building or enhancing capacity to \r\npromote the rule of law in a comprehensive manner. \r\n12-51951 17\r\nA/67/PV.5\r\nThe goal is to ensure that rule-of-law activities include \r\nthe modernization of commercial law and developing \r\ncapacities to engage States that most need it in that \r\nmodernization. The question is whether the United \r\nNations as a whole will design and conduct its future \r\nrule-of-law activities in a sufficiently comprehensive \r\nmanner. We at UNCITRAL truly hope that it will. We \r\nremain at the service of the international community to \r\nassist in overcoming that challenge.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now give \r\nthe f loor to the Director-General of the International \r\nDevelopment Law Organization.\r\nMs. Khan (International Development Law \r\nOrganization): As the Director-General of the \r\nInternational Development Law Organization (IDLO), \r\nwhich is the only intergovernmental organization \r\nexclusively devoted to advancing the rule of law, I am \r\ndeeply honoured to have the opportunity to address \r\ntoday’s High-level Meeting. I am also grateful for the \r\nchance given to IDLO to contribute to the substantive \r\npreparations for the Meeting and its outcome (resolution \r\n67/1).\r\nIDLO believes that the Declaration of the High-level \r\nMeeting opens a path for further reflection and action \r\nby the international community on the centrality of the \r\nrule of law in addressing the many complex political, \r\nsocial, economic and environmental challenges of our \r\ntimes. The renewed commitment to the rule of law \r\nthrough the adoption of the Declaration and today’s \r\nHigh-level Meeting is both significant and timely.\r\nThere is a global crisis of the rule of law, reflected \r\nin a dangerous deficit of public trust in institutions and \r\na deep disconnect between the formal mechanisms of \r\nthe rule of law and people’s lived experience of justice \r\nand equity. Restoring people’s confidence in justice \r\nsystems is an enormous challenge confronting national \r\nGovernments and the international community today.\r\nTransforming institutions is a long-term endeavour, \r\nwhile the international community’s attention span tends \r\nto be short-term. Many developing countries appreciate \r\nthe need to build effective legal systems. However, \r\nchange is hard because of resource constraints, lack of \r\ncapacity and vested interests.\r\nThe level of aid is nowhere near the level of \r\ndemand. If there is to be real progress towards the \r\ngoals embodied in the Declaration, then international \r\nassistance for the rule of law must be significantly \r\nexpanded. Institutions of law and justice must be made \r\nto work for people. In supporting national ownership, \r\nIDLO would like to underline the importance of \r\nengaging not only authorities but also civil society, and \r\nof empowering local communities. The focus must be \r\non the end users of justice.\r\nIDLO’s experience shows that the best results come \r\nabout when legal and institutional reforms are tailored \r\nto meet local needs and, at the same time, are firmly \r\nanchored in international standards and values. The \r\nvalues and norms of the rule of law are universal and \r\nmust be universally respected; but fairness, impartiality, \r\ntransparency, integrity and accountability can be \r\ninterpreted in different ways by different legal cultures. \r\nAcknowledging the plurality of legal systems, as indeed \r\nthe Declaration does, is key to local ownership.\r\nIDLO appreciates the Declaration’s recognition \r\nof informal justice systems. They are often the \r\nonly means by which many women and poor and \r\nmarginalized communities can gain access to justice. \r\nReform initiatives must therefore tackle the inequitable \r\npractices inherent in informal systems, but they must \r\ndo so in ways that do not undermine local ownership.\r\nIDLO welcomes the emphasis that the Declaration \r\nplaces on gender equality and women’s access to \r\njustice. But legal reform alone will not produce justice \r\nfor women. Policy initiatives and, even more important, \r\npolitical will, are needed to fight social discrimination \r\nand cultural prejudice and to promote the economic and \r\npolitical empowerment of women. For our part, we have \r\npledged to enhance the role of women in the justice \r\nsector and to support women in overcoming the legal \r\nbarriers they face in accessing justice and realizing \r\ntheir human rights.\r\nFinally, as the post-2015 international agenda begins \r\nto take shape, IDLO believes that the international \r\ncommunity has a unique opportunity to strengthen \r\nsustainable development strategies by supporting rule \r\nof law frameworks and rights-based approaches. The \r\nDeclaration provides the opening for that.\r\nThe challenge to which we must all rise is to create \r\na culture of justice. That entails three interrelated \r\ncomponents: well-functioning and responsive legal \r\ninstitutions based on well-recognized principles of the \r\nrule of law; citizens who are empowered and aware of \r\ntheir rights; and a legal system that enables development \r\noutcomes to be fair and sustainable. For our part, we \r\npledge to support efforts to improve the quality and \r\nintegrity of legal and judicial institutions; to support \r\n18 12-51951\r\nA/67/PV.5\r\narbitrariness: laws must be public, they must have been \r\nproperly enacted by a competent authority, they must \r\nnot be retroactive, and it must be possible to comply \r\nwith them. We could call that rule by law.\r\nUnder the rule by law concept, the content of \r\nthe law does not really matter so long as the formal \r\nrequirements are met. So as to prevent arbitrariness, \r\nit also requires that laws be properly enforced in a \r\nnon-discriminatory manner, which includes, of course, \r\nthe acclaimed principle that no one is above the law. \r\nLike the idea of law and order, rule by law has a certain \r\nattraction. It conveys a sense of fairness and protection \r\nfrom the capricious exercise of power, but it still falls \r\nshort of what the modern understanding of the rule of \r\nlaw should offer.\r\nThe real rule of law is substantive, and it \r\nencompasses many human rights requirements. It \r\nref lects the idea of equality in a substantive way — not \r\njust that no one is above the law, but that everyone is \r\nequal before and under the law and is entitled to its equal \r\nprotection and equal benefit. Only that understanding \r\nof the rule of law would prevent a law being enacted \r\nto regulate the use of torture, for example. Under the \r\nsubstantive understanding of the rule of law, that would \r\nbe impossible, no matter how well promulgated the law \r\nwas, nor how equitably it was enforced.\r\nProperly understood in that fashion, the rule of \r\nlaw would also prohibit the enactment of a law that \r\nwould deprive women of the right to vote or otherwise \r\noffend fundamental human rights guarantees. Under \r\nthat substantive understanding of the rule of law, rules \r\nserve a higher purpose than the mere orderly regulation \r\nof human conduct. Laws must also enhance liberty, \r\nsecurity and equality and strive to attain a perfect \r\ncoincidence between law and justice. That is a tall \r\nagenda at the national and the international levels, but \r\nit is one that the rule of law commands. It requires that \r\nlaws be just and justly enforced.\r\nThe enforcement of the rule by law and law and \r\norder models, rather than the real substantive rule of \r\nlaw, does not merely fall short of its objective. It runs \r\nthe risk of subverting its purpose entirely.\r\nThe robust enforcement of laws that violate \r\nfundamental human rights can entrench authoritarians \r\nand, worse still, give them the additional veneer of \r\nrespectability associated with respect for the rule of law. \r\nThere can be no worse perversion of a legal and political \r\nGovernments that uphold human rights and empower \r\npeople to claim them; and to facilitate legal solutions \r\nthat promote sustainable development and economic \r\nopportunity.\r\nWe look forward to exploring innovative and \r\ndiverse partnerships with the United Nations system \r\nand other stakeholders and to bringing our advocacy \r\nand our convening capacity to supporting the United \r\nNations in following up the Declaration in order to \r\nbuild consensus on the intrinsic and instrumental value \r\nof the rule of law.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the f loor to the representative of the International \r\nCrisis Group.\r\nMs. Arbour (International Crisis Group): \r\n“Between the rich and the poor, between the master \r\nand the servant, between the strong and the weak, it \r\nis freedom that oppresses and the law that sets free”. \r\nSo said Henri-Dominique de Lacordaire, a French \r\necclesiastic, preacher, journalist and political activist \r\nwho re-established the Dominican Order in post-\r\nrevolutionary France in 1848. And he was right.\r\nThe purpose of the law in a free and democratic \r\nsociety is to liberate, not to restrain. It is to create a \r\nsafe and just environment in which human conduct is \r\nregulated and power is constrained, so that maximum \r\nfreedom and safety is attained by all.\r\nIn our eagerness to promote the rule of law, we \r\noften confuse three competing visions of it. One is \r\ninstitutional, one is procedural, and one is substantive.\r\nThe institutional rule of law is the most familiar; \r\nit is concerned mostly with law enforcement and it is \r\nreflected, for example, in the way the rule of law is \r\ncurrently housed in the Department of Peacekeeping \r\nOperations as the Office of Rule of Law and Security \r\nInstitutions. It has under it a police division, a mine \r\naction service, a disarmament, demobilization and \r\nreintegration section and a criminal law and judicial \r\nadvisory division. It is functionally interested in law \r\nand order and is heavily reliant on ideas of security and \r\nsecurity institutions. In fact, we should call it law and \r\norder, rather than rule of law.\r\nThe second understanding of the rule of law is \r\nprocedural. It ref lects a formal understanding of the \r\nconcept and emphasizes the preference for rules over \r\nhuman arbitrariness. The rules themselves are subject \r\nto formal requirements designed to further restrict \r\n12-51951 19\r\nA/67/PV.5\r\nit is important not to compromise or diffuse the broad \r\noperational designs of the new initiative by assigning \r\ndifferent aspects to difference agencies and bodies \r\nin order to accumulate bureaucratic interests. The \r\ndiffusion of rule of law activities between different \r\nUnited Nations bodies and agencies is likely to \r\npresent the challenge to the effective implementation \r\nand execution of those programmes. There is already \r\nsome diffusion of the administration of rule-of-law \r\nprogrammes within the United Nations system, and that \r\nhas produced a limitation on its effectiveness. Further \r\ndiffusion of those important initiatives is going to be a \r\nfurther challenge.\r\nIt is therefore recommended that a special counsel \r\nor committee within the Office of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral be established to coordinate the programmes of \r\nall United Nations agencies and bodies involved in the \r\nfunding and administration of rule-of-law initiatives. \r\nThe counsel or committee should represent all United \r\nNations agencies and bodies working on rule-of-\r\nlaw issues, with a special focus on developing and \r\napplying best policies and practices across the United \r\nNations system, as well as promoting cooperation and \r\nsynergy, where appropriate, with intergovernmental \r\nand non-governmental organizations. In addition, the \r\ncounsel or committee should establish systems, such as \r\ndatabase systems of national and international experts \r\nas well as experienced professional and administrative \r\npersonnel, to be used by United Nations agencies and \r\nbodies working on rule of law initiatives. The counsel \r\nor committee should also include representatives of \r\nintergovernmental and non-governmental organizations \r\nin order to make use of their experiences and resources, \r\nas well as to enhance cooperation and synergies, where \r\nappropriate, between themselves and those other \r\nagencies.\r\nThe ultimate purpose should not be to enhance \r\ninternational participation in the rule of law, but \r\nrather to support the development of national rule of \r\nlaw programmes as well as to enhance the efforts of \r\ndonor States, intergovernmental and non-governmental \r\norganizations, especially by sharing best practices and \r\npromoting cooperation and synergies.\r\nWith regard to fact-finding missions and special \r\nprocedures, the Office of the High Commissioner for \r\nHuman Rights, in cooperation with the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, should undertake the necessary steps to \r\nidentify best policy and practices and to apply them, as \r\nwell as to ensure greater uniformity in the operations \r\nconcept that holds so much for the advancement of \r\nindividual freedom and of proper collective governance.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the f loor to the representative of the International \r\nInstitute of Higher Studies in Criminal Science.\r\nMr. Bassiouni (International Institute of Higher \r\nStudies in Criminal Science): It is our privilege to \r\nrepresent international civil society in expressing support \r\nfor the efforts of the Secretary-General, the various \r\nagencies and bodies of the United Nations system, as \r\nwell as the many governmental, intergovernmental and \r\nnon-governmental organizations that have supported \r\nthe rule of law both in its broadest sense, which \r\nencompasses the higher values of law and justice, and in \r\nits implementation at the legal and administrative levels. \r\nThe rule of law in its broadest sense encompasses many \r\nof the functions that international, intergovernmental, \r\ngovernmental and non-governmental organizations \r\nengage in. The rule of law is also about providing \r\nsupport for an effective legal, administrative and social \r\ninfrastructure, whose ultimate purpose is to ensure the \r\nprotection of the higher values of life, liberty, human \r\ndignity, equality and justice. That approach to the rule \r\nof law is indispensable to sustaining democracy and \r\nfreedom.\r\nHistorically, the rule of law has been interpreted as \r\naddressing laws and legal institutions, specifically law \r\nenforcement, prosecution, the judiciary, correctional \r\nservices and administrative legal services. But it also \r\nencompasses the prevention of wrongs and providing \r\nremedies for victims, as reflected in the Basic Principles \r\nand Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation \r\nfor Victims of Gross Violations of International Human \r\nRights Law and Serious Violations of International \r\nHumanitarian Law. In that respect, it also means \r\nensuring accountability and putting an end to impunity.\r\nThe time has come to focus on the rule of law as \r\na capacity-building mechanism within the United \r\nNations in order to increase the effectiveness of the rule \r\nof law, rather than to expand its scope to include every \r\nvalue and goal of international and national societies. \r\nIn order for that initiative to be successful, the United \r\nNations must avoid the generalities and vagueness that \r\nseem to pervade the present trend in the rule of law. \r\nInstead, United Nations agencies and bodies need to \r\nembrace specificity in their rule of law programmes.\r\nNothwithstanding the interests of United Nations \r\nagencies and bodies engaged in rule of law programmes, \r\n20 12-51951\r\nA/67/PV.5\r\ncould only be translated into reality, the peoples of the \r\nworld would not suffer the many injustices they still \r\nsuffer from, which include not only hunger, disease and \r\nignorance, but impunity for those who have committed, \r\nand who continue to commit, such crimes as genocide, \r\ncrimes against humanity, war crimes, torture, rape, \r\nabuse of children in so many ways, human trafficking \r\nand many other forms of criminal conduct.\r\nThe rule of law has reached its highest rhetorical \r\nlevel. The time has come for us to translate that \r\nrhetorical commitment into reality and action at the \r\ninternational and national levels.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): We have \r\nheard the last speaker for the High-level Meeting.\r\nI now declare closed the High-level Meeting of the \r\nGeneral Assembly on the Rule of Law at the National \r\nand International Levels.\r\nThe meeting rose at 8.20 p.m.\r\nof fact-finding missions and special procedures. That \r\nincludes, but is not limited to, developing a common \r\nstandardized database system, which would make the \r\nwork of fact-finding missions and special procedures \r\nmore uniform and more streamlined. Those steps \r\nshould also develop greater synergies between bodies \r\ndealing with the same subject.\r\nIt is self-evident that the rule of law is foundational \r\nto democracy, human rights and justice. The term “rule \r\nof law” reflects values which in turn are embodied in the \r\nmodalities that are needed to convert these values into \r\nactualization. Admittedly, the rule of law has reached \r\na high level of recognition in international and national \r\ndiscourse, as was evident in the 77 statements heard \r\ntoday and made by many heads of State and Cabinet \r\nofficers. But the question remains, with regard to civil \r\nsociety and the world’s masses, particularly those in the \r\nbottom 2 billion of the world who are struggling for their \r\ndaily survival — if the torrent of support heard today \r\n"
