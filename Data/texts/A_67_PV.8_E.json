This session of the General Assembly, \r\nwhich will address the theme of the settlement of \r\ndisputes by peaceful means, offers us an opportunity \r\nto reflect on the course of the history of our countries \r\nand humankind, and to showcase the issues that the \r\nworld’s peoples need to solve. The peaceful settlement \r\nof conflicts is an essential part of how we strengthen \r\nour democratic institutions and the rule of law in a \r\nworld that has not yet consolidated peace.\r\nFor various reasons that we need not go into, \r\nwe are witnessing violations of the principle of \r\nnon-interference — through various mechanisms \r\nthat are not necessarily military — of our countries’ \r\nconstitutions and our own international treaties, as well \r\nas various manifestations of intolerance, xenophobia \r\nand other attitudes that provoke violence and foment \r\nconflict. Hard as it is to believe, we still see political \r\nparties, leaders, intellectuals and representatives of the \r\nmedia who continue to see global realities through Cold \r\nWar eyes, as if the last half-century had not produced \r\nenormous changes in the international political map.\r\nSuch outdated positions hinder the progress of our \r\npeoples and nations in strengthening and broadening \r\ntheir democratic borders. My country, El Salvador, is a \r\nclear example of such contradictions, finding itself as \r\nit does stuck between a process that is strengthening \r\nthe rule of law and the persistence of conservative \r\nforces that still entertain the fantasy of communism.\r\nI bring these thoughts to this forum because I \r\nbelieve that El Salvador’s young democracy is a good \r\nexample of how to settle disputes through dialogue. It \r\nis also a good example of structures that are mired in \r\nbackwardness, privilege and the Manichaean view that \r\nbelongs to the Cold War. As is well known, El Salvador \r\nendured a long armed conflict that lasted 12 years and \r\ncost more than 80,000 lives. Our emergence from \r\nthat conflict has been a model of the effectiveness of \r\ndialogue and negotiation for my country and the entire \r\nworld.\r\nWe took a giant step forward as a nation \r\n20 years ago when, on 16 January 1992, we signed the \r\nUnited Nations A/67/PV.8\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-seventh session\r\n8th plenary meeting\r\nTuesday, 25 September 2012, 6 p.m.\r\nNew York\r\nOffi cial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Jeremić . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Serbia)\r\n2 12-52041\r\nA/67/PV.8\r\nChapultepec, Mexico, peace accords that brought the \r\narmed conflict to a definitive end. The United Nations \r\nitself acted as mediator; the then Secretary-General, \r\nMr. Javier Pérez de Cuellar, in consultation with the \r\nSecurity Council, appointed the Peruvian diplomat \r\nÁlvaro de Soto as mediator. I would like, if I may, to \r\npay tribute to Mr. De Soto’s work, as it is an example of \r\nhow even exceedingly difficult disputes can be settled \r\nthrough dialogue. In that regard, he proved to be a true \r\narchitect of peace. We can say that, beginning in 1992, \r\nSalvadorans launched a new process that has gradually \r\nconsolidated our democracy and created modern \r\ninstitutions.\r\nThree years ago El Salvador passed another \r\nmilestone signaling a step forward in the strengthening \r\nof our democracy. After 20 years of Governments led by \r\nthe same political forces, we witnessed a political change \r\nthat brought in the current Government to administer the \r\nState. This was not simply a change of political party; it \r\nopened the way to a movement of renewal that has been \r\nexpressed in various issues of enormous importance \r\nfor the rule of law and for reinforcing the work of \r\nour democratic institutions. The long-term control of \r\nour country’s Government by a single political party \r\nfor two decades gave absolute power to a small group \r\nover the organs of State — executive, legislative and \r\njudicial — and over other institutions such as the Court \r\nof Accounts, the Office of the Prosecutor General and \r\nthe Public Ministry, among others.\r\nAs change and the break with absolute control \r\ntook place, they began to permit genuine independence \r\nin the branches of Government, which in turn began \r\nto lead to the genuine f lowering of democracy that \r\nthe people had demanded. Those changes, far from \r\nchanging the rules of the game, effectively guaranteed \r\njudicial certainty and eliminated the privileges that \r\nhad protected Governments in the past. On behalf \r\nof the State, the Government asked for forgiveness \r\nfor the crimes committed by State agents during the \r\narmed conflict, and has undertaken and continues to \r\nundertake concrete efforts to make moral and material \r\nreparations to the victims of barbaric atrocities and \r\ntheir families. This was a debt to the Salvadoran people \r\nand the international community that had not been \r\nsettled by previous Governments.\r\nNot long ago, our country experienced an \r\ninstitutional crisis whose nature and scope were \r\nvery different from those of the armed conflict, but \r\nnonetheless put Salvadoran democracy to the test. \r\nI am referring to the recent crisis that arose between \r\nthe constitutional chamber of the Supreme Court of \r\nJustice and the Legislative Assembly in my country. At \r\nno time did the crisis cause political instability; rather, \r\nit brought two State bodies in conflict and, in that \r\nrespect, it was an example of the independence of those \r\ntwo branches of Government in our country today. \r\nThe conflict, arising from different and conflicting \r\ninterpretations of the Republic’s Constitution, lasted \r\nalmost five months. It was a protracted crisis that \r\ngenerated opposing positions within our country, and \r\nthe lack of agreement between the parties drove the \r\nLegislative Assembly to call for a settlement through \r\nthe Central American Court of Justice. The conflict and \r\nthat decision of the parliamentary majority set off strong \r\nreactions from groups on either side. Unfortunately, \r\nit was also exploited by foreign groups, including by \r\ncampaigning United States senators who blew the \r\nconflict out of proportion without understanding it \r\nfully. \r\nTherefore, with no agreement to resolve the crisis, \r\nthe President of the Republic offered to mediate and \r\nfacilitate the dialogue. After 17 long days of meetings \r\nwith representatives of the different political camps in \r\nthe Legislative Assembly, the longed-for agreement was \r\nfinally reached. In the end, that agreement led to the \r\nappointment of a new President of the Supreme Court \r\nof Justice and the normalization of the administration \r\nof justice in our country. \r\nI wished to share with the Assembly this brief \r\nsketch of events in order to underscore that once again \r\nEl Salvador was able to find a felicitous solution to an \r\ninstitutional crisis through dialogue and as the fruit of \r\nnegotiation. In short, it was a new triumph of the young \r\nand ever-stronger Salvadoran democracy. Of course, \r\nmany challenges lie ahead, such as that of promoting \r\na process of constitutional reform that will lead to an \r\nunequivocal interpretation of our Magna Carta so that \r\nwe do not once again suffer conflicts such as the one \r\nwe saw recently. We also must move to update State \r\ninstitutions in the light of what we have learned over \r\nthe past two decades. \r\nEl Salvador resolved on its own an institutional \r\nconflict that in other eras would have led to coups \r\nd’état and breaches of constitutional order with serious \r\nhuman, economic, political and social consequences for \r\ncountries that suffered such situations. We found the \r\nsolution through dialogue, which is a fine example of \r\nthe theme for this session of the General Assembly. At \r\n12-52041 3\r\nA/67/PV.8\r\nclose ties to my country. That is due to a phenomenon \r\nthat we have been experiencing for more than half \r\na year and that has brought a significant drop in \r\nviolence and crime. El Salvador was the second most \r\nviolent country on the American continent until a few \r\nmonths ago. We had 15 murders per day on average, \r\nas a result of violence, crime and infighting among \r\ncriminal organizations, in particular among gangs. By \r\nSeptember, the average had fallen to 3.8 murders per \r\nday. We have seen drops in other crime rates that, while \r\nless significant, are still steady and substantial. \r\nFor the past three years, El Salvador has been \r\nundertaking a policy of civic security that has been \r\nbearing fruit. Recently, a truce signed between rival \r\ngangs, with the Catholic church as intermediary and \r\nfacilitated by the Government, contributed decidedly to \r\nthat crime reduction process. However, let me also say \r\nthat if violence and organized crime are to disappear \r\nin our  countries, we must modify the conditions for \r\nmillions of young people who live without hope and \r\nwithout opportunity. These are tasks that are incumbent \r\nupon the Governments and societies of each of our \r\ncountries. \r\nHowever, there is more. As we have said on other \r\noccasions, without the strong and decided support of the \r\ndrug-consuming countries, and without an unequivocal \r\ncommitment from those large markets, we cannot wage \r\nthis good fight successfully. Central America, together \r\nwith Mexico and Colombia, have agreed upon joint \r\npolicies to wage that battle. We need the support of \r\nthe Government and people of the United States in that \r\nbattle. It is essential. \r\nEl Salvador has launched a massive campaign to \r\nraise awareness and mobilize our people against gender \r\nviolence in the understanding that violence against \r\nwomen is violence against all of society. If gender-based \r\nviolence is a problem throughout all of our societies, \r\nit is one that we should address and that is even more \r\npressing in societies where there is a strong tradition of \r\ntolerance of violence and chauvinism against women. \r\nGovernments bear the biggest responsibility, but \r\nsocieties should also show solidarity and commit to \r\nthose efforts. We are certain that the differences that \r\ndivide us within our countries can be overcome only \r\nthrough dialogue. That is the manner in which we must \r\nresolve conflicts. Dialogue, consensus and agreement \r\nare the guidelines for the road maps that will lead to \r\nsocieties that are more fair and prosperous. \r\nthe same time, we are aware that the strengthening of \r\ndemocratic processes — which, happily, is the one-way \r\nroad on which Latin America is now travelling — should \r\nbring profound changes in the economic and social \r\nstructures of our countries, which must clearly be based \r\non the rule of law. \r\nThe fact that there are people who are marginalized \r\nand excluded from the progress and goods that only a \r\nsmall portion of humankind is able to enjoy remains \r\nan open wound that we cannot and should not continue \r\nto tolerate. We live from crisis to crisis, ever more \r\nfrequent and ever deeper, which lead to a system and \r\nmodels based essentially on the accumulation of wealth \r\nin the hands of a tiny minority, leaving large majorities \r\nin poverty and backwardness. The phenomenon of \r\nmigration, which we once addressed in this forum, is \r\nthe child of that planet-wide inequality and an striking \r\nreflection of the need to change and change quickly. \r\nLatin America has taken important steps in that \r\ndirection. We are leaving behind a perverse model that \r\nhad impoverished our people and turned our region into \r\nthe most unfair of the planet — not the poorest, but \r\nthe most unfair. Today, we are aware that no model is \r\nsuccessful if it leaves out vast majorities. With all the \r\npeople involved we can achieve much, but without the \r\npeople we can achieve nothing. That is the road that we \r\nhave begun to travel in our region. Without a doubt, it \r\nwill be a difficult and long road, full of progress and \r\nsetbacks, but in the end, and I stress this, it is the only \r\nroad that will allow for certain success. \r\nThe unfair distribution of wealth and goods, the \r\nconstant aggression against the environment, and the \r\nlack of global control over financial f lows that leads \r\nto recurring crises — which are always paid for by the \r\npeople and never by those who are responsible — are \r\nrealities that do not arise from any ideology. The problem \r\nis not one of ideology. These are realities that we must \r\nchange in order to establish a climate of peace and \r\nsecurity in which we see the domestic changes that give \r\nour peoples better living conditions and access to the \r\nmaterial and cultural goods that produce progress in \r\nour global society. \r\nI do not wish to conclude without first alluding to \r\na topic that we have also addressed in this forum and \r\nthat is a source of ongoing concern for the international \r\ncommunity. I am referring to civic security and the \r\nfight against organized crime and all forms of violence. \r\nEl Salvador is today the focus of the region, multilateral \r\norganizations and the countries that historically have \r\n4 12-52041\r\nA/67/PV.8\r\nI should therefore like to conclude my remarks \r\nby sending along a warm greeting to the people and \r\nGovernment of Colombia for their efforts to attain a \r\ndefinitive peace in their country. For several decades, \r\nour sister Republic of Colombia has suffered an armed \r\nconflict that has limited its possiblities and clearly \r\nhindered its economic growth and the well-being of its \r\npeople. For that reason, the dialogue and negotiation that \r\nhave been launched by President Juan Manuel Santos \r\nCalderón deserve the full support of the international \r\ncommunity, and in particular of the Latin American \r\ncountries. We congratulate the Colombian people and \r\nwish them the greatest success on the road that they \r\nhave taken towards peace and national concord. \r\nAlong the same lines, we hail the process of \r\neconomic reforms undertaken by the sister Republic \r\nof Cuba, which is bringing about a transformation \r\nthat is worthy of our support and encouragement. We \r\ntherefore reiterate the call we made last year in this \r\nHall. The blockade against Cuba must be lifted. It is \r\nan anachronism from a past that has been overcome in \r\nour America. \r\nPeace, unity and change are essential values when \r\nit comes to working for the happiness of our peoples.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I thank the President of the \r\nRepublic of El Salvador for the statement he has just \r\nmade.\r\nMr. Carlos Mauricio Funes Cartagena, President \r\nof the Republic of El Salvador, was escorted from \r\nthe General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Joseph Kabila Kabange, President \r\nof the Democratic Republic of the Congo\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will hear an address by the President of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo.\r\nMr. Joseph Kabila Kabange, President of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, was escorted \r\ninto the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Joseph Kabila \r\nKabange, President of the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Kabila Kabange (spoke in French): At \r\nthe outset, I should like to join previous speakers in \r\ncongratulating Mr. Vuk Jeremić and the other members \r\nof the Bureau on his election to the presidency of \r\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. I \r\nshould like also to congratulate Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz \r\nAl-Nasser for the work that he accomplished during \r\nhis mandate, and Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \r\nfor his commitment to defending the ideals of our \r\nOrganization. \r\nThe holding of a session of the General Assembly \r\noffers each of us an opportunity to participate in a \r\ncollective process of reflection on ways and means of \r\nensuring the success of efforts aimed at peace, security \r\nand development in each of our States and throughout \r\nthe world.\r\nPresident Jeremić has rightly recommended \r\nthat interventions during this general debate focus \r\nin particular on the adjustment or settlement of \r\ninternational disputes by peaceful means. That \r\nrecommendation is particularly wise because this is an \r\nissue whose relevance and timeliness are immutable \r\nand which is part and parcel of the process of tirelessly \r\nseeking peace through means other than the use of \r\nforce.\r\nWorld history makes clear the operational validity of \r\nthe principle of the peaceful settlement of international \r\ndisputes. It also teaches us that processes of dialogue \r\nand negotiation, in order to remain credible as ways of \r\nresolving conflicts and disputes, must be based on truth \r\nand respect for the law and the values and universally \r\nrecognized principles. They should guard against both \r\nhasty action and stalemate, and they should demonstrate \r\neffectiveness by producing the hoped-for results, even \r\nif this is done in a gradual manner.\r\nIt must be noted that more than 60 years after the \r\nfounding of the United Nations, the world continues \r\nto witness many situations of war and instability. \r\nTerrorism is increasing instead of decreasing. Maritime \r\npiracy, which we thought had been eradicated, is once \r\nagain becoming one of the main threats to peace \r\nand security. The Middle East is today a hotbed of \r\ntension. Syria is in the throes of bloodshed, and Mali is \r\nwitnessing attempts at separatism.\r\nMore broadly, as peace is more than just the absence \r\nof war, many scourges still affect humanity. Many are \r\ndevoting their creativity and energy to destabilization \r\nand destruction, by means of drug trafficking, \r\n12-52041 5\r\nA/67/PV.8\r\ntrafficking in persons and other violations of the rights \r\nand freedoms of human beings, instead of working for \r\nthe prosperity and for individual and collective well-\r\nbeing.\r\nIn addition, for the sake of more than two thirds of \r\nhumanity, there is an increasingly urgent need to fight \r\npoverty, ignorance, violence, injustice and diseases of \r\nall kinds, particularly HIV and malaria.\r\nAfter years of difficulties, my country, the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, is in the process \r\nof consolidating of peace and security. To that end, no \r\neffort has been spared, and remarkable progress has \r\nbeen made. Begun for the first time only 10 years ago \r\nin a country that has had independence for 50 years, \r\ntireless efforts towards democratization, the building \r\nof a State based on the rule of law, the development of \r\nthe socioeconomic infrastructure, and the improvement \r\nof the living conditions of our people continue, which is \r\nproof of the determination of the Congolese people and \r\nof its leaders to be a factor of peace and stability. \r\nThat momentum, unfortunately, is now under \r\nthreat by the enemies of peace. Since March 2012, the \r\nprovince of North Kivu, in the Democratic Republic \r\nof the Congo, where the concepts of peace, stability, \r\nreconciliation, work and human dignity had begun \r\nto regain a foothold, has, sadly, once again gained \r\nnotoriety, not because of the incomparable beauty \r\nof its landscape or the extraordinary richness of its \r\nbiodiversity, but as an example of the profound evil \r\nthat selfishness, extremism, communal violence and \r\nthe philosophy of “might makes right” can wreak on \r\na society.\r\nEven as I address the Assembly today, hundreds \r\nof thousands of children, women and men in North \r\nKivu are deprived of peace and are being subjected to \r\ninhuman and degrading treatment by negative forces, \r\nled by unrepentant elements with a vast capacity to do \r\nharm and who benefit from external support. Children \r\nare unable to attend school and are forced to carry \r\nand use firearms to kill other children, even their own \r\nbrothers and sisters. That situation is unacceptable. It \r\nshould be condemned and should give rise to sanctions. \r\nWe expect that the community of nations will shoulder \r\nits responsibilities in that respect and that the Security \r\nCouncil will ensure compliance with its resolutions. \r\nThat is a condition for those resolutions to be effective \r\nand remain credible.\r\nWe are aware that it is up to us, the Congolese \r\npeople, to defend our country and ensure law and order \r\nand security throughout our national territory. We are \r\ndetermined to assume that responsibility and we intend \r\nto dedicate all of our human, material and financial \r\nresources to that end, even sacrificing our legitimate \r\nambitions for the emergence of Congo. We also remain \r\ndetermined to guarantee national cohesion and ensure \r\nequal protection for all Congolese citizens. \r\nAt the same time, it is my hope to see the Organization \r\nencourage all Member States, in particular those that are \r\ntempted by violence, to respect the guiding principles \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nIn conclusion, I would like to thank all those who, \r\nfrom afar or from close by, bilateral or multilateral \r\npartners, including the United Nations, have assisted us \r\nin our efforts to build at the centre of Africa a Congo \r\nthat is united and prosperous and that lives in peace \r\nwith itself and with all of its neighbours. I would like \r\nto assure the Assembly of one thing: the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo is a safe investment. \r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I thank the President of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo for the statement he \r\nhas just made. \r\nMr. Joseph Kabila Kabange, President of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, was escorted \r\nfrom the General Assembly Hall. \r\nMr. Gaspar Martins (Angola), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nAddress by Mr. Ali Bongo Ondimba, President of \r\nthe Gabonese Republic\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now hear \r\nan address by the President of the Gabonese Republic. \r\nMr. Ali Bongo Ondimba, President of the Gabonese \r\nRepublic, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Ali Bongo Ondimba, \r\nPresident of the Gabonese Republic, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly. \r\nPresident Bongo Ondimba (spoke in French): I \r\nwarmly congratulate the President on his election as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh \r\n6 12-52041\r\nA/67/PV.8\r\nsession. His election demonstrates the esteem in which \r\nhe and his country, Serbia, are held on the international \r\nscene. I can assure him that he has the support of \r\nmy country, Gabon. I also commend the outstanding \r\nwork done by his predecessor, Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz \r\nAl-Nasser, during his presidency of the Assembly at its \r\nsixty-sixth session. And I would like to reiterate our \r\nconfidence in the efforts that Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon is undertaking as the head of the Organization. \r\nOur world more than ever needs a dialogue \r\nof civilizations and cultures. In order to build a \r\nmore peaceful world, it needs more tolerance, more \r\nunderstanding and more respect among peoples. During \r\nthis session, we are called upon to redefine the outlines \r\nfor better management of global challenges. I would \r\nlike to welcome the theme chosen by the President for \r\nthis session, namely, “Bringing about adjustment or \r\nsettlement of international disputes or situations by \r\npeaceful means”, which will remain at the heart of our \r\ncommon efforts and is indeed an ongoing quest. \r\nThe debate we held yesterday on the rule of law \r\nat the national and international levels was also a \r\ndiscussion of the conditions for peace in our countries \r\nand around the world. By maintaining our focus on \r\nthat goal and working together, we can better tackle \r\nthe challenges of an international context that is still \r\nmarked by multifaceted crises, illustrated by many \r\nhotbeds of tension around the world. That is shown by \r\nthe situations in the Middle East and Africa, which are \r\nstill of concern to us.\r\nThe Syrian crisis, which arose as an extension of \r\nthe Arab Spring last year, is having a destabilizing \r\nimpact on several countries of the Middle East region. \r\nWe hope that the efforts undertaken by the Joint Special \r\nRepresentative, Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, will help put a \r\nstop to confrontation and will open up a dialogue.\r\nWith respect to the situation in Mali, we condemn \r\nthe attempts to divide the country and the destruction of \r\nthe World Heritage sites in Timbuktu. Gabon supports \r\nthe efforts of the new transitional Government, the \r\nEconomic Community of West African States and the \r\nAfrican Union to try to re-establish territorial integrity.\r\nI urge the Security Council and Member States \r\nto support the United Nations integral regional \r\nstrategy on the Sahel, which addresses issues of \r\nsecurity, governance, development, human rights and \r\nhumanitarian concerns. \r\nWhen we served on the Security Council, we \r\njoined other members in responding to the appeals of \r\nthe Libyan people. The situation there is still dire, and \r\nwe encourage the United Nations to continue to work to \r\npromote political stability and reconstruction efforts. \r\nWe reiterate our condemnation of the attack on the \r\nUnited States Consulate in Benghazi. \r\nWith regard to the ongoing tensions in the eastern \r\npart of our brother country the Democratic Republic \r\nof the Congo, our collective support for the Congolese \r\nState must be maintained in security, political and \r\nhumanitarian matters.\r\nI welcome the progress made in Somalia with the \r\nadoption of its provisional Constitution and the election \r\nof the new President, Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, whom \r\nI congratulate and commend. Gabon will continue to \r\nhelp Somalia, as it did last year with humanitarian \r\ncontributions. I commend United Nations and African \r\nUnion involvement in Somalia. Thanks to the African \r\nUnion Mission in Somalia and to Government forces, \r\nsecurity is improving even far outside Mogadishu. I \r\nhave the highest praise for the country, whose troops \r\npay a heavy price on the ground.\r\nI honour the memory of the first Prime Minister of \r\nEthiopia, Meles Zenawi, who passed away on 22 August. \r\nAll of us know of his work for peace in Somalia and the \r\nSudan, his commendable tenures as Chair of the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development Heads of State \r\nand Government Orientation Committee and his focus \r\non climate change.\r\nIt goes without saying that the crises and conflicts \r\nthat continue to ravage the world constitute a profound \r\nbetrayal of the cry-from-the-heart aspirations of all \r\npeoples for peace and security, justice, development \r\nand the equal sovereignty of States. Those cries come \r\nfrom the people of Palestine and Cuba, who long for a \r\nbetter future. One wants recognition of a State living in \r\npeace and security with its neighbours, within secure, \r\ninternationally recognized borders, while the other \r\nwants an end to the economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo it suffers under. The General Assembly has \r\nmany times spoken out on the side of those two peoples’ \r\naspirations, through numerous resolutions, which my \r\ncountry has unequivocally supported.\r\nTo fulfil the aspirations of all peoples, we need global \r\ngovernance that is more balanced, more democratic, \r\nbetter structured and based on the principles of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. Such governance must \r\n12-52041 7\r\nA/67/PV.8\r\nbe founded on the primacy of international law and \r\nrespect for the sovereignty of States in their quest for \r\ndemocracy and development.\r\nThroughout the coming sixty-seventh session we \r\nwill focus on certain priority issues, starting with \r\nvarious reforms of the Organization, especially the \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly, to make it better \r\nable to play its part given the changes and current realities \r\nin the world. We must strengthen the Assembly’s role \r\nas an active force and as the premier forum for global \r\ndemocracy. Likewise, in its commitment to Security \r\nCouncil reform, Gabon continues to support permanent \r\nand equitable representation for Africa.\r\nAs we did during our recent tenure on the Council, \r\nwe will continue our focus on mediation, prevention \r\nand the peaceful resolution of disputes and conflicts. \r\nWe believe action must be taken before disputes \r\nescalate into armed conflict, sparing the heavy expense \r\nof peacekeeping operations. But current realities force \r\nus to focus also on new, cross-cutting threats to peace \r\nand security, including trafficking in small arms and \r\nlight weapons and maritime piracy, which is ravaging \r\nthe Gulf of Guinea. \r\nThat is why we are working along with \r\nother countries in Central Africa to put in place \r\nconfidence-building measures, including the early \r\nwarning mechanism for Central Africa. We greatly \r\nappreciate the support offered by the United Nations \r\nRegional Office for Central Africa, which my country \r\nhosts, in promoting peace.\r\nDuring my tenure as Acting Chairman of the \r\nEconomic Community of West African States, I will \r\nemphasize regional integration as a means to common \r\neconomic development and strengthening peaceful \r\nconnections among member States.\r\nWe know that the conflicts shaking the world have \r\nnumerous and complex causes. Any lasting settlement \r\nof those crises requires an approach that combines \r\nsupport for institution-building and governance in the \r\naffected countries with initiatives to revitalize their \r\neconomies. Gabon will therefore follow with great \r\ninterest the issue of an increased role for the Economic \r\nand Social Council. \r\nMany countries remain concerned with economic \r\nconditions. We must therefore rethink our approaches \r\nto sustainable development initiatives. We must reflect \r\nclearly on the post-2015 development agenda, especially \r\non how to coordinate the Millennium Development \r\nGoals and the sustainable development goals enunciated \r\nin the outcome of the United Nations Conference on \r\nSustainable Development (Rio+20) (resolution 66/288). \r\nIt is also crucial to break the impasse in the \r\nWorld Trade Organization by rethinking the basis for \r\nnegotiations. We will thereby be better able to promote \r\nthe tripartite model of aid together with investment and \r\ntrade towards sustainable development. \r\nDuring last year’s session I referred to work \r\nin progress in my country towards the goal we set \r\nfor ourselves to become an emerging country by \r\n2025. Since then that initiative has begun to produce \r\nresults in the creation of strategic infrastructures, \r\nstrengthening the rule of law and social, political \r\nand economic reforms. We continue to take steps to \r\ndiversify our economy through local promotion of the \r\nnatural resources we export, which encourages wealth \r\ncreation and employment. Those efforts must be based \r\non sustainable management of our forests and their \r\nbiodiversity, which plays an important role in the global \r\nenvironment. In that vein we are fighting poaching and \r\nthe illegal trafficking in protected species. \r\nI am also pleased at the adoption, on 21 June, of \r\nthe outcome of the Rio+20 Conference, which reflects \r\nthe international community’s recognition of the need \r\nto work together to promote sustainable development \r\nthrough the joint efforts of individuals, Governments, \r\ncivil society and the private sector. Along those lines I \r\nhave instructed my Government to rethink our country’s \r\ninstitutional framework for sustainable development, \r\nwith an eye to enacting legislation on the subject. \r\nGabon is also pursuing the opportunities offered by a \r\ngreen economy in eradicating poverty.\r\nWe are also continuing to develop our human \r\nresources, our financial services capabilities, new \r\ninformation technologies and ecotourism. Given \r\ncurrent economic challenges, I recently instituted \r\nmeasures to improve the daily lives of my fellow \r\ncitizens by tackling the cost of living — for instance, \r\nby suspending customs duties and the value added-tax \r\non several basic items and building materials. \r\nIn the social arena, we have put in place a national \r\nsystem of health coverage for all strata of Gabonese \r\nsociety. That coverage, which is part of our fight against \r\nHIV/AIDS, includes free antiretrovirals and prenatal \r\nand maternal care for all infected pregnant women.\r\nAt the political level, we have introduced biometrics \r\nto improve the organization of the next elections. We \r\n8 12-52041\r\nA/67/PV.8\r\nThe United Nations and its General Assembly are a \r\nunique tool, the one and only global forum that provides \r\nroom for dialogue to discuss strategic visions and to \r\nseek policy-level solutions to the problems that we are \r\njointly confronted with at the international, regional \r\nand national levels. It is our obligation and moral duty \r\nto search together for ways of bringing peace and \r\nprosperity to all humankind. Conflicts do not stop at \r\nborders. The world we live in is so interconnected that \r\nevery problem is a problem for all of us and every threat \r\nis a threat faced by all. At the same time, every success \r\nis of benefit to all of us.\r\nBesides numerous indisputable benefits, the \r\nprocess of globalization introduces new challenges. I \r\nwill mention just three challenges encountered in the \r\nearly twenty-first century: the global economic crisis, \r\nenvironmental change and man-made threats, including \r\nterrorism and weapons of mass destruction. We need \r\nglobal partnership and cooperation. We need strong \r\nmultilateralism. We need a proactive United Nations that \r\ncan lead effectively on all fronts: political, economic, \r\nmilitary, social and civil. We need a trustworthy United \r\nNations that people can rely upon to save them from the \r\nscourge of war. We need to work together towards our \r\ncommon goal: peace, security and dignity for all.\r\nThe Organization’s primary objective is to preserve \r\npeace and security in the world. We have been through \r\nan extremely challenging year full of unexpected twists \r\nand turns, including some severe new conflicts, grave \r\nviolations of human rights, disease, famine, terrorism \r\nand extremism, as well as other threats to peace and \r\nsecurity, which, unfortunately, we cannot always \r\nsuccessfully prevent. Attacks have even occurred \r\nagainst diplomats and diplomatic missions, which we \r\nresolutely condemn as totally unacceptable.\r\nIt is the way we go about resolving constantly \r\noccurring conflicts and the effectiveness of our \r\nresponses to new threats that tells us how successful \r\nwe are in meeting the objectives of the United Nations. \r\nViolence can never be the right way to settle a dispute. \r\nOpen dialogue, respect for mutual differences and a \r\njoint search for solutions by peaceful means is the only \r\nway to proceed; there is no alternative. Therefore, we \r\nappreciate the appeal to concentrate specifically on \r\nthat crucial aspect of international relations. We are \r\nall obliged under the Charter of the United Nations to \r\nresolve disputes by peaceful means so that peace and \r\nsecurity are not at risk.\r\ncontinue our efforts to talk with all leading players in \r\nthe nation, in particular through the National Council \r\nfor Democracy.\r\nTogether, those actions strengthen the climate of \r\npeace bequeathed to us by my illustrious predecessor, \r\nthereby creating an environment conducive to the well-\r\nbeing of citizens and to the security of investments \r\nneeded for the development of the country. We are \r\ntherefore ready to welcome diversified and mutually \r\nbeneficial partnerships and look forward to doing so.\r\nOur countries and the international community as \r\na whole must today overcome considerable challenges. \r\nOur efforts can fulfil the aspirations of our peoples only \r\nif we cooperate to achieve global governance based on \r\nrespect for the rule of law, dialogue among peoples, \r\nconflict prevention, protection of the environment and \r\nbiodiversity. Our ultimate goal must be, above all, the \r\nwell-being of our peoples.\r\nIt is in that spirit that my country will continue to \r\nmake its contribution both in our Organization and in \r\nour common work for peace, security, development and \r\nprosperity for all.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I thank the President of the Gabonese \r\nRepublic for the statement he has just made. \r\nMr. Ali Bongo Ondimba, President of the Gabonese \r\nRepublic, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Ivan Gašparovič, President of the \r\nSlovak Republic\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Slovak Republic.\r\nMr. Ivan Gašparovič, President of the Slovak \r\nRepublic, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Ivan Gašparovič, President \r\nof the Slovak Republic, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Gašparovič (spoke in Slovak; English \r\ntext provided by the delegation): At the outset, I wish \r\nto convey thanks and appreciation to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his true commitment to the fulfilment of \r\nthe purposes and principles of the United Nations.\r\n12-52041 9\r\nA/67/PV.8\r\nin particular, that they are aware of their responsibility \r\nfor global development and the sustainability of \r\nsocial stability in the world. This is not only about the \r\napplication of the principle of social solidarity; it is \r\nabout the self-preservation of humankind.\r\nWe therefore have to pursue a common target: \r\nto transform the United Nations into an effective \r\nOrganization with a leading role in a new international \r\nenvironment. We need a political willingness on the \r\npart of all Members and a clear vision to adapt the \r\nUnited Nations to the global demands of the twenty-\r\nfirst century.\r\nOne of the instruments for preventing conflicts is \r\nthe elimination of poverty and ensuring sustainable \r\ndevelopment for all, and in all aspects. The United \r\nNations has the necessary tools in its hands. At a time \r\nof fiscal constraints, we have to use the existing tools \r\nmore effectively. We do not need to create new parallel \r\nor duplicate structures.\r\nAt the United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (Rio+20), we agreed that we needed an \r\ninclusive, strong multilateral system that will be able \r\nto effectively address threats in the area of sustainable \r\ndevelopment. Such a system is crucial for enduring \r\npeace and, of course, for security.\r\nWe support Sustainable Energy for All, an \r\ninitiative launched by the Secretary-General. In the \r\nspirit of the initiative, we emphasize, among other \r\nthings, the positive aspects of the use of nuclear energy \r\nin the energy and health care sectors. I am convinced \r\nthat priority investments in research to increase the \r\noperational safety and security of nuclear power plants \r\nwould be more useful than massive investment in the \r\nclosure of functioning power plants.\r\nSlovakia is prepared to intensively and constructively \r\ncooperate with partners in order to maximize the \r\neffective functioning of the United Nations system in \r\nthe economic, social, environmental and other areas. \r\nWe support strengthening the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil and more effective cooperation of the Council \r\nwith the General Assembly and other entities across the \r\nUnited Nations system.\r\nSlovakia takes seriously its moral duty to help \r\ndeveloping countries and countries in distress. We have \r\nless than three years to go to accomplish the United \r\nNations Millennium Development Goals. We need \r\nto step up our efforts. As a donor country, Slovakia \r\ncontributes its share to addressing the pressing problems \r\nThe Charter provides us with a range of options, \r\nincluding negotiation, enquiry, mediation, conciliation, \r\narbitration and other peaceful means, which must \r\nbe used effectively. Mediation under the auspices \r\nof the United Nations is key to resolving conflicts \r\nby peaceful means. Reinforcing United Nations \r\nmediation capacities, confidence-building, improved \r\nimplementation of the Charter and enhanced respect for \r\nits provisions are central.\r\nWhile the nature of conflicts evolves and changes, \r\ntheir essence remains the same — achieving goals by \r\nviolence. I refer not just to military battles. Famine \r\nand thirst have even more devastating consequences \r\nthan weapons. Unfair distribution of wealth, social \r\nimbalances, poverty and the feeling of injustice remain \r\nbreeding grounds for conflicts and disputes. Persons \r\nwhose basic needs are met do not seek conflict; rather, \r\nthey seek ways of making the best of their lives. In that \r\ncontext, I think that prevention is the most effective \r\ntool for ensuring peace, sustainable growth and a life \r\nof dignity.\r\nIt is crucial to eliminate the primary causes \r\nof conflicts, including through poverty reduction, \r\nsustainable development, respect for human rights, the \r\nrule of law and respect for its instruments, building of \r\ndemocratic institutions, and arms control. Those are \r\nthe basic building blocks of peace and prosperity. The \r\nUnited Nations, with its multipurpose focus, possesses \r\nthe potential to effectively assist its Members in all \r\nthose areas. But it must be adequately empowered to \r\ndo so.\r\nHowever, we still differ considerably on what the \r\nUnited Nations should do, and how. Terrorism poses an \r\nimminent threat to every one of us, yet we are unable \r\nto find common grounds to describe its characteristics. \r\nClimate change has brought about crucial changes with \r\nconcrete impacts on agricultural production, yet the \r\nproduction of greenhouse gases and emissions does \r\nnot decline. The gap between the wealthy and the poor \r\nhas been growing. An increasingly important role is \r\nbeing played by non-State actors — multinational \r\ncorporations and speculative investors.\r\nThe crisis has shown that even the strongest \r\neconomies are vulnerable. They are vulnerable when \r\nthey live on credit, when the moral hazard goes beyond \r\nwhat is sustainable. The crisis has shown that peace \r\nhas its limits in every society, whether that society is \r\nmore or less advanced. It is important for the global \r\neconomy that the strongest economies are stable and, \r\n10 12-52041\r\nA/67/PV.8\r\nof global development. Despite its tight budget, Slovakia \r\nincreases its total contribution to official development \r\nassistance every year.\r\nA secure and stable environment conducive to \r\ndevelopment cannot be achieved without effective arms \r\ncontrol and universal disarmament as the fundamental \r\ninstruments of conflict prevention. Slovakia is an \r\nadvocate of a comprehensive, universal and binding \r\narms trade treaty. Our objective is to curb irresponsible \r\ndealing in arms and to prevent their transfer to the hands \r\nof terrorists, criminals and other illicit groups. I regret \r\nthat the years-long efforts of States, in cooperation with \r\ncivil society, were not crowned with success at the July \r\n2012 Conference on the Arms Trade Treaty. I believe \r\nthat further negotiations will lead to a consensus on an \r\neffective agreement.\r\nA world free of nuclear weapons is one of the \r\npriorities long pursued by the international community. \r\nAlthough we have made some progress in this respect \r\nin recent years, there are still countries that are not \r\nparties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \r\nWeapons.\r\nWe appreciate that a conference on a Middle East \r\nzone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass \r\ndestruction has been scheduled for December 2012 in \r\nHelsinki. We believe that despite the regrettable turmoil \r\nin the region and the unwillingness of some countries to \r\ncooperate, we will overcome the differences and jointly \r\nbring the conference to a successful conclusion, for the \r\nsake of our common goal, namely, peace and security \r\nin the Middle East without the fear of nuclear weapons.\r\nSuccess of the conference would also support long-\r\nlasting efforts to drive away concerns over the Iranian \r\nnuclear programme. Rocket tests performed by Iran \r\ndo not contribute to belief that its nuclear programme \r\nserves a peaceful purpose.\r\nWith regard to further improvements in the \r\nwork of peacebuilding missions and increasing their \r\neffectiveness, I would like to mention three aspects \r\nthat I consider crucial: first, cooperation among United \r\nNations missions; secondly, the protection of civilians \r\nand the contributions to monitoring human rights; and, \r\nthirdly, the need to prepare a strategy for the transition \r\nfrom peacekeeping to peacebuilding, that is, increased \r\neffectiveness in the implementation of security \r\nsector reform. More intensive cooperation among \r\npeacekeeping missions will allow for effective sharing of \r\nfunds, equipment and personnel between neighbouring \r\nmissions, as well as contribute to improving the \r\ncapabilities of United Nations peacekeeping forces \r\nto adequately respond to unforeseen situations. The \r\nprotection of civilians is one of the main objectives \r\nunder the mandates of peacekeeping operations. It will \r\nenable the restoration of political processes in a country, \r\nincluding the implementation of measures aimed at \r\nthe disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of \r\ncombatants, as well as of ordinary people affected by the \r\nconflict, including children. As the road from conflict \r\nto enduring peace is complicated, it is important that \r\nwe prepare strategies for the peacekeeping forces to \r\nanticipate and transfer responsibility for peacekeeping \r\nin a host country with the aim of eliminating duplicate \r\ninstruments and procedures.\r\nLast year, the international community devoted \r\nconsiderable attention and funds to support Afghanistan \r\non its road towards responsibility for its own security \r\nand for meeting its obligations. Afghanistan remains \r\nthe top-priority foreign military operation for Slovakia. \r\nOur troops will stay in Afghanistan as long as necessary. \r\nSecurity and stability also depend on a stable \r\neconomy. Therefore we also wish to intensify our \r\ninvolvement in the area of development assistance. \r\nAfghanistan remains one of the three primary recipients \r\nof Slovakia’s official development assistance. At the \r\nsame time, we support the central role of the United \r\nNations and the United Nations Assistance Mission in \r\nAfghanistan in capacity-building and stabilization in \r\nAfghanistan. Wherever in the world human lives are at \r\nrisk, the international community should be prepared \r\nto take resolute action.\r\nAllow me to express my deepest regret over the \r\nthousands of victims of the conflict in Syria. The Slovak \r\nRepublic has joined the initiative requesting that the \r\nmost serious crimes under international law committed \r\nin Syria be investigated by the International Criminal \r\nCourt. The primary responsibility for the protection \r\nof its citizens is always borne by the Government and \r\ndemocratic institutions of a country. The aim is to \r\nbuild a country governed by the rule of law, respecting \r\ninternational principles and at the same time reflecting \r\ntraditional common law. \r\nSlovakia is committed to the United Nations \r\nprinciples set out in the Charter. We believe that the key \r\nto resolving global problems in today’s interconnected \r\nworld is an inclusive and effective multilateralism. \r\nGlobal threats to security, the economy, the environment \r\n12-52041 11\r\nA/67/PV.8\r\nSince then, we have witnessed considerable \r\nprogress and also some setbacks. Knowing that the \r\nfuture remains uncertain and perilous, we have always \r\nbelieved that much more needs to be done to protect \r\nour gains, including developing new strategies for \r\npreventing and resolving conflicts.\r\nThe situation in Syria, which continues to weigh on \r\nthe collective conscience of the world, is a case in point. \r\nEvery day since the conflict began, innocent people \r\ncontinue to lose their lives and livelihoods, while tens \r\nof thousands of others f lee into neighbouring countries \r\nseeking refuge. I seize this opportunity to call on \r\nthe Syrian people, in the face of a seeming lack of \r\nconcerted positive international action, to pause and \r\nfind a solution to the crisis in a way that will benefit \r\nthe Syrian nation.\r\nIndeed, it was in the context of tackling the many \r\ncrises that plagued our world that I proposed the \r\nestablishment of a conflict mediation commission, under \r\nthe Secretary-General’s Office, to further strengthen \r\nthe early warning and peacebuilding initiatives of the \r\nUnited Nations. Experience elsewhere gives us reason \r\nto believe that there is value in the creation of such a \r\nmechanism. Nigeria stands ready to work with other \r\ncountries to make the protection of innocent civilians \r\ncaught in conflict situations a priority of the United \r\nNations.\r\nI see a consonance between the theme of the sixty-\r\nsixth session and that of sixty-seventh session — the \r\nadjustment or settlement of international disputes or \r\nsituations by peaceful means. Both are concerned with \r\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes. This consonance, in \r\nmy view, is evidence of the United Nations continuous \r\nand justifiable preoccupation with issues of peace and \r\nsecurity.\r\nMembership in the Security Council in 2010 and \r\n2011 afforded Nigeria an opportunity to work with \r\nothers to promote the complex peace and security agenda \r\nof the United Nations. It was indeed a privilege for us \r\nto contribute to the United Nations and international \r\nefforts to make the world a safer and better place.\r\nNigeria and other emerging nations continue to \r\ndemonstrate the capacity to add value to the work of \r\nall the organs of the United Nations, including the \r\nSecurity Council. For that reason, we must now commit \r\nourselves to accelerating the long-overdue reforms of \r\nthe Security Council. They will no doubt make the \r\nCouncil more equitable, more inclusive and more \r\nor society know no borders and are so extensive that no \r\ncountry and no regional organization can alone respond \r\nto or defend against them effectively.\r\nWe believe that, together, we will make progress \r\non our agenda during the current session of the General \r\nAssembly. That is what our citizens expect from us.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Slovak \r\nRepublic for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Ivan Gašparovič, President of the Slovak \r\nRepublic, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, \r\nPresident of the Federal Republic of Nigeria\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Federal Republic \r\nof Nigeria.\r\nMr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, President of the \r\nFederal Republic of Nigeria, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, \r\nPresident of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Jonathan: Let me start by congratulating \r\nMr. Jeremić on his election as President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-seventh session. I have no doubt \r\nthat under his able leadership the work at this session \r\nwill progress to a successful conclusion. I also wish \r\nto acknowledge the excellent work of his predecessor, \r\nAmbassador Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, who guided \r\nthe affairs of the sixty-sixth session with diligence \r\nand consummate skill. I must seize this opportunity to \r\napplaud Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for the able \r\nmanner in which he has continued to guide and lead the \r\nSecretariat of our Organization. \r\nWhen I addressed the Assembly last year on the \r\ntheme of the role of mediation in the settlement of \r\ndisputes by peaceful means (see A/66/PV.11), the world \r\nwas witnessing important and dramatic changes. The \r\nArab Spring had broken out, setting new political \r\nstandards for social contracts between Governments \r\nand the governed. Also, South Sudan, today sitting at \r\nthe family table of the United Nations, had just gained \r\nindependence.\r\n12 12-52041\r\nA/67/PV.8\r\nand Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, including the \r\nunprecedented adoption of an outcome document under \r\nNigeria’s presidency. We expect that those positive \r\nachievements will have an impact on the entire United \r\nNations disarmament process, including the Conference \r\non Disarmament, the Disarmament Commission and \r\nother disarmament mechanisms. \r\nThe correlation between disarmament, peace \r\nand security, and development is axiomatic and \r\nself-evident. The work of the United Nations \r\nCommission on Life-saving Commodities for \r\nWomen and Children — which I have the honour to \r\nco-chair with Mr. Jens Stoltenberg, Prime Minister of \r\nNorway — recognizes the need to serve and improve \r\nthe health of women and children for the benefit \r\nof the future progress of the world. That is indeed a \r\nlaudable achievement, for which we commend the \r\nvision of the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon. \r\nThe Commission’s overarching objective is to provide \r\nmedical resources and other life-saving commodities \r\nin a more affordable, accessible and timely manner, \r\nthereby saving the lives of at least 4 million women and \r\nchildren worldwide by 2015 and helping to achieve the \r\nhealth-related targets of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs). Concerned with the unflattering \r\nstatistics on maternal and child mortality in Nigeria, \r\nmy Government has adopted measures for reversing \r\nthat unhappy trend, in close collaboration with the \r\nCommission and the related Every Woman Every Child \r\nmovement. \r\nWe believe, therefore, that it is time that the world \r\nlooked beyond 2015 to the post-MDG era. The year \r\n2015 is not a destination but only a milestone on the \r\nlong journey to a better, safer, healthier and more caring \r\nworld. It is in that spirit that Nigeria will participate in \r\nthe forthcoming intergovernmental process to consider \r\nthe development of specific and action-oriented \r\nsustainable development goals beyond 2015. \r\nSustainable development and progress are two \r\nultimate aspirations of any nation, and they cannot be \r\nachieved without peace and security. Guided by that \r\nrealization, Nigeria has committed and shall continue \r\nto commit itself to the attainment of regional and \r\ninternational peace and security, in close collaboration \r\nwith the United Nations, the African Union and \r\nthe Economic Community of West African States \r\n(ECOWAS). \r\nRecently, however, our subregion has suffered \r\nsome setbacks in terms of unconstitutional change of \r\neffective. Nigeria believes that a reformed Security \r\nCouncil with expanded permanent membership would \r\nbenefit from the unique experiences and capacities that \r\nregional representatives could bring to bear on its work.\r\nIt is a matter of great concern that many regions \r\nof the world, including the West African subregion, \r\nare plagued by political crises and insurgency. In \r\nsome parts of my own country, for instance, we are \r\nexperiencing threats from extremist and militant \r\nactivities with quasi-terrorist tactics. Our response has \r\nbeen multifaceted, as we seek to address the root causes \r\nof those threats, exploring opportunities for dialogue \r\nand improving law enforcement to ensure public safety \r\nand security.\r\nInternational cooperation has also been a key factor \r\nin tackling our security challenges. We have signed \r\nbilateral agreements with our neighbours: Cameroon, \r\nthe Republic of the Niger and Chad. On the multilateral \r\nfront, the Lake Chad Basin Commission has been an \r\nexcellent platform for cooperation. Those efforts are \r\naimed at safeguarding the security of our individual \r\ncountries and denying extremists the use of our region \r\nas sanctuary. We are confident that those measures will \r\nstem the f low of and access to small arms and light \r\nweapons, which have indeed become Africa’s weapons \r\nof mass destruction and the most potent source of \r\ninstability. Indeed, the free f low of small arms and light \r\nweapons from the developed countries that manufacture \r\nthem to Africa is one of the greater challenges the \r\ncontinent is facing in the contemporary world. \r\nNigeria continues to regard the General Assembly \r\nas a veritable platform for collective action to address \r\nissues of common interest to all nations. One such issue \r\ndeserving the serious attention of the United Nations \r\nis the adoption of a legally binding arms trade treaty. \r\nI believe that important instrument could galvanize \r\nthe international community to regulate the transfer \r\nof conventional weapons and curb the illicit trade in \r\nsmall arms and light weapons. There is no doubt that \r\nthe absence of a global consensus on controlling the \r\nf low of such weapons, including small arms and light \r\nweapons, is fuelling conflicts, constraining growth and \r\ndevelopment and increasing human rights violations. \r\nA ray of hope was offered early this month with \r\nthe successful conclusion of the second United \r\nNations Conference to Review Progress Made in the \r\nImplementation of the Programme of Action to Prevent, \r\nCombat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms \r\n12-52041 13\r\nA/67/PV.8\r\nI cannot end my statement without alluding to the \r\nimportance of the support that Nigerians are continuing \r\nto give to the United Nations in not only advancing but \r\nalso upholding international peace and security. We \r\nshall strengthen and deepen our cooperation with the \r\nUnited Nations in peacekeeping operations around \r\nthe world. We shall remain focused and committed to \r\nensuring a meaningful and effective contribution to \r\nits presence and, if need be, to crucial peacekeeping \r\noperations, particularly in Africa.\r\nThe events of recent weeks have demonstrated how \r\nincreasingly interconnected our world has become and \r\nthe extent to which an incident in one area can cause \r\nreverberations in others. The lesson is that freedom \r\nof expression should not be construed as a licence to \r\nincitement. The freedom that we all hold dear and true \r\nshould be exercised wisely and consciously. Freedom of \r\nexpression and religious tolerance must not be mutually \r\nexclusive but should be complementary to each other. \r\nWe eschew violence and deplore needless loss of lives \r\nand destruction of property. We condemn the deliberate \r\ndenigration of religious and cultural beliefs and \r\nsensitivities, which in turn leads to counter-reactions.\r\nAs the world grows in knowledge and prosperity, \r\nso must humankind grow in maturity and wisdom. Care \r\nand compassion for our fellow beings must inform all \r\nour actions. We must ensure that no nation and no part \r\nof the world is left behind in terms of human progress. \r\nWorking together with commitment and common \r\npurpose, we can succeed in building an inclusive, safer \r\nand prosperous world for present and future generations. \r\nThe United Nations must lead that effort with renewed \r\ncommitment.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Federal \r\nRepublic of Nigeria for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, President of the \r\nFederal Republic of Nigeria, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Christopher Jorebon Loeak, \r\nPresident of the Republic of the Marshall Islands\r\nThe Acting President: The General Assembly will \r\nnow hear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nthe Marshall Islands.\r\nMr. Christopher Jorebon Loeak, President of the \r\nRepublic of the Marshall Islands, was escorted into \r\nthe General Assembly Hall.\r\nGovernments and the emergence of insurgency, among \r\nothers. In Mali, the political crisis stemming from that \r\nreality has escalated to an insurgency that is threatening \r\nthe unity of the country. Nigeria and ECOWAS are \r\nworking in concert to address that threat, which has the \r\npotential to spill over into neighbouring countries and \r\ndestabilize the entire region.  Guinea-Bissau is another \r\nf lashpoint of instability in the subregion in which \r\nNigeria and the Economic Community of West African \r\nStates are engaged. Indeed, the contact group, headed \r\nby Nigeria, was set up by the authority of the Heads of \r\nState and Government of ECOWAS to help establish \r\na transitional Government with a view to returning \r\nthat country to political and constitutional order. In \r\nfurtherance of that objective, Nigeria provided the sum \r\nof $10 million to the interim Government in Guinea-\r\nBissau to assist in the stabilization of the country.\r\nThe overall security situation in the West African \r\nsubregion should continue to be a matter of interest and \r\nconcern to the rest of the international community. I \r\nbelieve I speak for many in the Assembly when I state \r\nthat West Africa can ill afford renewed insurgency. \r\nAlthough ECOWAS is taking measures to address the \r\nsituation in Mali, particularly in the north, the urgent \r\nassistance of the United Nations and the support of \r\nother partners will be needed to build on recent gains \r\nto secure peace and stability in Mali and across the \r\nsubregion.\r\nNigeria’s long-standing commitment to the \r\npromotion of issues of particular concern to Africa \r\nis widely acknowledged. Nigeria has stood firm and \r\nplayed critical roles in all the recent developments in \r\nAfrica, including the struggle for independence and \r\nself-determination and the fight against apartheid, \r\ncolonialism and discrimination. \r\nToday, we are in the vanguard of the fight against \r\nextremism, terrorism and all forms of mindless \r\nviolence. We shall remain undeterred and unflinching \r\nin our resolve to protect our citizens and other persons \r\nliving within our borders and to extend such protection \r\nwherever we can to other countries in our region. \r\nWe know that no country has unilaterally defeated \r\nthe dark forces of violence and terrorism. They \r\nevidently represent an evil that requires international \r\ncollaboration. We therefore call upon the international \r\ncommunity and all like-minded stakeholders to address \r\nthe matter with all the seriousness it deserves.\r\n14 12-52041\r\nA/67/PV.8\r\nand the Pacific Islands Forum and its regional agencies, \r\nto respond. Next year I hope to present the Assembly \r\nwith a report not about our plight but about our progress.\r\nIt is easy, and indeed rightful, to place blame on \r\nthe international community, especially concerning \r\nclimate change and fisheries, spheres where the open \r\npolitical assurances of our partners too often fall victim \r\nto their own self-interest once the negotiating doors \r\nclose. Yet the ultimate burden for achieving greater \r\nnational success must be on the Marshall Islands \r\nGovernment and the Marshallese people. However \r\nunfair multilateral outcomes may be to the smallest \r\nnations, we must and will do whatever is in our national \r\npower to assure a viable future. Nothing will stand in \r\nour way.\r\nThe Marshall Islands is far from alone. Many \r\nnations in the Pacific islands region share similar \r\nchallenges. Our collective Pacific progress must be a \r\nkey pillar of the 2014  global conference on small island \r\ndeveloping States, to be held in the Pacific. The next \r\nsummit of the Pacific Islands Forum will be held next \r\nyear in the Marshall Islands, and this meeting will \r\nreveal firm and dramatic progress not only towards \r\nbasic social and environment goals, but also how a very \r\nreal expansion of public-private partnership will be \r\njump-started in the Pacific.\r\nSince 1954, Marshallese leaders have visited the \r\nUnited Nations to address the ongoing impact of the 67 \r\nnuclear tests conducted on our lands during our status \r\nas a United Nations Trust Territory. That is our first \r\nforeign policy issue, and it is more than a historical \r\nlegacy. It is a contemporary reality for our local \r\ncommunities. The United Nations authorized many of \r\nthose tests through two resolutions, in 1954 and 1956, \r\nwhich also made assurances of our basic human rights \r\nand our full and safe return to our land, while today too \r\nmany Marshallese remain nuclear nomads, still unable \r\nto safely resettle. While I acknowledge the important \r\nefforts taken to date, the half-life of radioactive material \r\nremains for generations, and much more needs to be \r\ndone.\r\nBut today, for the first time since the trusteeship \r\nresolution of 1956, the United Nations has finally spoken. \r\nEarlier this month, Mr. Calin Georgescu, Special \r\nRapporteur on human rights and toxic wastes, presented \r\nhis report regarding the nuclear testing programme \r\nin the Marshall Islands (A/HRC/21/48/Add.1) to \r\nthe Human Rights Council in Geneva. The Special \r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Christopher Jorebon Loeak, \r\nPresident of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and \r\nto invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Loeak: I bring the Assembly the warm \r\ngreeting of “Yokwe” from the Marshall Islands. \r\nThe Republic of the Marshall Islands was born first \r\nin the hearts and minds of the Marshallese people, but \r\nwe also forged our nationhood under the auspices of the \r\nUnited Nations f lag. The United Nations is truly our \r\nsecond home. Our unique story, from United Nations \r\nTrust Territory to Member State, deserves reflection \r\nby the international community, two decades after we \r\nwere welcomed as a United Nations Member.\r\nThe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) will \r\nbe reviewed in three years’ time. The Marshall Islands \r\nis now firmly committed to making stronger progress, \r\nespecially with regard to achieving full access to \r\nadequate education and decent employment and to \r\nensuring a sustainable environment. The MDGs are \r\nnot distant figures or statistics. The MDGs are in the \r\nfaces of our Marshallese children; the MDGs are in our \r\nclassrooms and hospitals. One of the most immediate \r\nand necessary steps is to better integrate our bilateral \r\nand regional development pathways with the MDGs, to \r\nensure that all efforts move in the same direction and \r\ntowards the same common goals.\r\nAs the Asia-Pacific region rises in the global \r\nspotlight, so also must the Marshall Islands. Our \r\nnational future is still within our grasp, and our future \r\nneed not be so difficult if we and our partners undertake \r\nthe hard actions needed to change it.\r\nToday, the Marshall Islands commits to being a key \r\nsuccess story in the Pacific. We will move with specific \r\nactions to make firm and measurable progress towards \r\nthe MDGs and towards economic independence resting \r\non an expanded private sector, especially in regard to \r\nour primary drivers of fisheries and tourism. We simply \r\nhave no other alternative but to rewrite our future.\r\nWe look to the future with targets in mind instead of \r\ngeneralities. I have asked my Government for specific, \r\nquantifiable development goals. I have also asked my \r\nGovernment to list the necessary actions, to be taken by \r\nourselves and by our partners, needed to achieve them. \r\nToday I am encouraging bilateral partners, especially \r\nour closest partners, as well as the Secretary-General \r\n12-52041 15\r\nA/67/PV.8\r\nto be seen if key distant-water fishing nations will \r\ncontinue to join us in forging a landmark sustainable \r\nfishery or if they will choose to be left on the sidelines.\r\nThe Republic of the Marshall Islands is among \r\nthe low-lying nations in the world, and sea-level-rise \r\nprojections of more than a metre pose complex risks to \r\nour future statehood, risks that we are only beginning \r\nto unpack and address. Last year’s watershed agreement \r\non the Durban Platform, prepared at the 2011 United \r\nNations Climate Change Conference, has moved the \r\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange (UNFCCC) into a new chapter of a single, \r\nlegally binding protocol applying to all nations by 2020. \r\nIt has also redoubled urgent efforts needed to close the \r\nglobal mitigation gap. The time for endless North-\r\nSouth division is now over, and the all-too-predictable \r\nfinger-pointing must end.\r\nBut the world can no longer wait for negotiators. \r\nWe must do more than pat ourselves on the back if \r\nwe are serious about reducing the risks to our future. \r\nMore action is needed by all nations and all actors in \r\nall possible settings and negotiation forums. As the \r\nMarshall Islands, we have a national energy plan and \r\nUNFCCC target to cut our own emissions, boost our \r\nefficiency and pursue new technology, such as ocean \r\nthermal energy conversion, which can make us a \r\ncarbon-negative nation. I ask the rest of the world, will \r\nit also meet us in increasing that ambition? Will it come \r\nsoon enough?\r\nClimate adaptation poses perhaps the most complex \r\nchallenges for a low-lying nation, but we must overcome \r\nthem nonetheless. We cannot rely only on an uncertain \r\narchitecture of global climate finance to address the \r\nvery critical adaptation efforts that will be necessary \r\nfor our continued survival. In the large scale — up to \r\n$100 billion a year — of the future Green Climate Fund \r\nand other efforts, our relatively modest needs can easily \r\nbe overlooked. Our increasingly urgent needs on the \r\nground can no longer be met with paper studies and \r\ndisconnected pilot projects. Yet the Marshall Islands is \r\nat present heavily reliant on international assistance. We \r\nhave little other means to provide for adaptation. The \r\ngrowing belief, however wrong, that we must finance \r\nsome of our own adaptation efforts is perhaps the most \r\ncompelling reason to rapidly expand our private sector. \r\nWe must also create financial security through the debt \r\nfor adaptation swap being pursued by the Marshall \r\nIslands and other small island nations.\r\nRapporteur has presented significant findings that \r\nindicate that the pain, mistrust, progress and failures \r\nof the Marshallese people over decades have a human \r\nrights dimension and that the international community \r\nmust respond with more than silence. The Marshallese \r\npeople have paid too heavy a price for the only instance \r\nin which the United Nations explicitly authorized the \r\nuse of nuclear weapons.\r\nI urge all relevant actors  —  the United States and \r\nthe wider international community and its agencies — to \r\njoin with the Marshall Islands and the Pacific Islands \r\nForum members in welcoming the Special Rapporteur’s \r\nspecific recommendations as a way forward to ensure \r\nprogress on regaining the very human rights that \r\nshould never have been lost. The Special Rapporteur’s \r\nreport must not be allowed to only collect dust on the \r\nshelf; it should instead be a foundation for new efforts, \r\nparticularly with key international agencies. We have \r\nno more time for well-worn accusations. The Marshall \r\nIslands must not fail to advance the human rights of its \r\nown citizens. Where old solutions have not worked, we \r\nmust not fail to find new ones.\r\nWe are not only a small island State, but truly a \r\nlarge-ocean nation. Our sustainable fisheries represent \r\na primary pathway to the very economic strength \r\nand social development I have just called for today. \r\nYet our aspirations are too often undermined by the \r\nnarrow commercial self-interests of those nations at the \r\nWestern and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission that \r\nmight otherwise seek to embrace us as close political \r\npartners. For us, our collective Pacific development is \r\nnot an isolated issue bound in technical jargon. It is the \r\nvery hope and economic survival of our entire nation, \r\nand indeed the whole Pacific region. We realize only a \r\npenny of true benefit for every dollar of fishing activity, \r\nand despite scientific warnings, pressure on key fish \r\nstocks has only increased, not diminished. Decades of \r\nglobal lip service at the United Nations to sustainable \r\ndevelopment seems to be lost on some of our fishing \r\npartners.\r\nThe parties to the Nauru Agreement have become \r\na watershed political movement, recently achieving \r\ncertification of a sustainable fishery by the Marine \r\nStewardship Council, which is perhaps the largest such \r\nfishery in the world. In the Pacific, we are already \r\ndeep into advancing the very sustainable development \r\nmeasures agreed to at the United Nations Conference on \r\nSustainable Development (Rio+20), and we are growing \r\nour own Pacific-driven commercial brand. It remains \r\n16 12-52041\r\nA/67/PV.8\r\nThe United Nations cannot fail the needs of the most \r\nvulnerable nations and must better harness the efforts \r\nof all necessary actors. The Marshall Islands urges \r\nother nations to facilitate the meaningful participation \r\nof Taiwan within the United Nations system and the \r\ninternational community. Taiwan should be able to \r\nparticipate as an observer in the UNFCCC and the \r\nInternational Civil Aviation Organization, as it does \r\nin the World Health Assembly, and its potential for \r\nmeeting the MDGs should be recognized.\r\nThe international community must not fail to act, \r\nnot only to address long-term threats, but also to ease \r\nthe most immediate security concerns. Recent tension \r\nin the broader Pacific Rim is an important matter for \r\nthe Pacific Islands region, which can grow only when \r\nthere is security and stability. I urge that those issues, \r\nincluding that of the East China Sea, be peacefully \r\naddressed through an inclusive dialogue involving all \r\nkey actors.\r\nThe smallest nations in the world, many of which \r\nare in the Pacific, are beginning to play important and \r\nunique roles on the international stage. But nations \r\nsuch as the Marshall Islands also depend greatly on \r\nfirm multilateral action. Accordingly, they must be able \r\nto rely on the United Nations and its Members for more \r\nthan symbolism. It is decisive and bold leadership that \r\nare so urgently needed in this international hour.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof the Marshall Islands for the statement he has just \r\nmade.\r\nMr. Christopher Jorebon Loeak, President of the \r\nRepublic of the Marshall Islands, was escorted \r\nfrom the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Sprent Arumogo Dabwido, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Nauru\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nNauru.\r\nMr. Sprent Arumogo Dabwido, President of the \r\nRepublic of Nauru, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Sprent Arumogo Dabwido, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Nauru, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident Dabwido: Allow me to congratulate \r\nMr. Jeremić on his assumption of the presidency of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-seventh session and also \r\nto commend his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Nassir \r\nAbdulaziz Al-Nasser, for his effective leadership during \r\nthe sixty-sixth session. The President can be assured of \r\nmy delegation’s full support and cooperation during his \r\ntenure.\r\nThis body was a very different place when Minister \r\nPaul-Henri Spaak, another presidential predecessor, \r\nopened the first session of the General Assembly. The \r\nworld had just emerged from the most devastating \r\ncarnage it had ever seen, and the United Nations \r\nhad the enormous task of stitching civilization back \r\ntogether again. Finding common purpose among the \r\noriginal 51 Member States promised to be a Herculean \r\neffort — a similar endeavour had faltered only a decade \r\nearlier — but the stakes were far too high for failure to \r\nbe an option. Accordingly, the Organization embarked \r\nin earnest on the long process of strengthening the \r\nrule of international law based on the principles of \r\nnon-aggression and the sovereign equality of all nations.\r\nIt is a testament to the  success of those early \r\nefforts that the membership of the United Nations has \r\nswelled to 193 countries and the past 67 years have \r\nbeen a period of relative stability. While the benefits \r\nof multilateralism during this time were often shared \r\nunequally, as were the costs, the promise of a more \r\nstable and secure future for all imbued the United \r\nNations with the legitimacy it needed to pursue its \r\nambitious mandate. But we must never forget that the \r\nlegitimacy underpinning our essential work here is not \r\na birthright; we must earn it. When our words become \r\nhollow, that legitimacy is threatened.\r\nThe work of our early predecessors was one of \r\nconstruction. The task at hand today, perhaps even \r\nmore challenging, is one of restoration. We are awash in \r\nunfulfilled promises stretching back decades. Barring \r\na brief resurgence in the early 1990s, multilateralism \r\nhas for the most part deteriorated into a scramble for \r\nfinite resources, a destructive fight for a bigger piece \r\nof the economic pie, sugarcoated with empty rhetoric. \r\nLook at the beginning of any international agreement \r\nand you will find reaffirmation upon reaffirmation of \r\nour non-binding commitments to live up to our lofty \r\nideals. Perhaps their greatest value is as a reminder \r\n12-52041 17\r\nA/67/PV.8\r\nof how often very little has been achieved. Our words \r\nmust have meaning if our multilateral institutions are \r\nto remain effective in addressing emerging global \r\nchallenges. Once again, the stakes are too high for \r\nfailure to be an option.That dynamic could not be more \r\nevident than it was in the climate change negotiations. \r\nThis summer, we were treated to a new round of truly \r\nterrifying news. Arctic sea ice dropped to its lowest \r\nextent in recorded history, shattering the previous \r\nrecord by a jaw-dropping 18 per cent. Some scientists \r\nare now predicting that the Arctic Ocean could be \r\nice-free during summer in as little as five years. The ice \r\nmelt is already wreaking significant havoc on weather \r\npatterns around the globe and has probably contributed \r\nto the historic heat waves that struck many places this \r\nyear.\r\nJust last week, a new study found that half of all \r\ncoral reefs could be lost with a temperature rise above \r\n1.2 degrees Celsius. The scientists further concluded: \r\n“There is little doubt... coral reefs will no longer be \r\nprominent within coastal ecosystems if global average \r\ntemperatures exceed 2 degrees Celsius...” That would \r\nbe devastating for the economies of small islands and \r\ncoastal communities around the world, not to mention \r\nthe staggering and irrevocable loss of biodiversity \r\nthat would be incurred by our shared natural heritage. \r\nMore and more studies are concluding that the door to \r\nlimiting temperature rise to even 2 degrees is rapidly \r\nclosing, if it has not closed already. \r\nMeanwhile, greenhouse-gas emissions continue \r\nto climb higher each year, with no end in sight. Small \r\nislands may be the canary in the coal mine, but we all \r\nare staring a global catastrophe right in the face.\r\nIt is revealing just how much our ambition to \r\naddress the crisis has been downscaled in just three \r\nyears. The fifteenth session of the Conference of the \r\nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention \r\non Climate Change, held in Copenhagen, was the \r\nconference to save the world. The United Nations \r\nClimate Change Conference, held in Cancún, Mexico, \r\nwas the conference to save the process. The Conference \r\nof the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to \r\nthe Kyoto Protocol, held in Durban, South Africa, it \r\nseems, was the conference to save the rest for later.\r\nInstead of increasing the urgency of our work to \r\nrespond to the growing climate crisis, we have instead \r\nseen the steady dismantling of the international \r\nregime and a concerted effort to delay additional \r\naction until 2020. Such an outcome is unacceptable. If \r\nmultilateralism is to have any credibility, then we must \r\nmove to an emergency footing, and those countries \r\nwith the greatest capacity must immediately begin \r\nmobilizing the significant resources necessary to \r\nremake the energy infrastructure that powers the global \r\neconomy. That must begin at the eighteenth session of \r\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange in Doha with the reprioritization of pre-2020 \r\nmitigation ambition and the  mobilization of means \r\nof implementation, including finance, technology and \r\ncapacity-building.\r\nNauru’s delegation will arrive in Doha prepared \r\nto make its contribution to the global effort. We have \r\nadopted a very ambitious renewable energy goal of \r\n50 per cent by 2015. We think we can achieve it, but \r\nwe will need climate financing from international \r\nsources to do so. As with most developing countries, \r\nobtaining the means of implementation will be the key \r\nto unlocking our ambition.\r\nThe ultimate objective of the Convention on Climate \r\nChange is to stabilize greenhouse gases at a level that \r\naverts dangerous interference with the climate system so \r\nthat ecosystems can adapt naturally, food production is \r\nnot threatened and economic development can proceed \r\nin a sustainable manner. We should stop pretending that \r\nthis is still within reach.\r\nWe must realize that we have polluted the \r\natmosphere so much that many dangerous climate \r\nchange impacts are now unavoidable. Therefore, \r\nthe United Nations system must begin analysing and \r\naddressing the security implications of climate change. \r\nClimate change will become an increasing driver \r\nof conflict in the future if we do not take steps now. \r\nIncreased competition over dwindling natural resources, \r\nfood and water insecurity, and forced migration are \r\njust a few of the security issues that climate change \r\nis expected to exacerbate. For that reason, the Pacific \r\nsmall island developing States (SIDS) have called for \r\nthe appointment of a special representative on climate \r\nand security, supported by adequate resources, to \r\nbegin analysing the security threats of climate change \r\nand to work with interested Member States to build \r\ntheir resilience. In addition, the Secretary-General of \r\nthe United Nations should be requested to conduct an \r\nassessment of the United Nations system’s capacity \r\nto respond to the various security implications of \r\nclimate change. Member States, particularly the most \r\nvulnerable, must have confidence that the international \r\n18 12-52041\r\nA/67/PV.8\r\nis to be held in the Pacific in 2014. The Conference will \r\nprovide an opportunity for the international community \r\nto make good on the promises of the Barbados \r\nProgramme of Action and the Mauritius Strategy for \r\nImplementation by setting specific goals and mobilizing \r\nreal resources. We call on the international community \r\nto provide support for the Conference and to summon \r\nthe political will necessary to make it a success. It was \r\nagreed at the first Earth Summit that the sustainable \r\ndevelopment of SIDS would be the first test of the \r\nglobal partnership. We must demonstrate to the world \r\nthat this partnership means something.\r\nA central aspect of that work must be enhancing \r\nthe international system to better target the unique \r\ncombination of challenges faced by SIDS, which \r\nshould include the creation of a formal SIDS category \r\nat the United Nations. It is clear from 20 years of \r\nexperience that the current arrangements for improving \r\nthe sustainabIe development prospects of SIDS are \r\nineffective. We must demonstrate that the multilateral \r\nsystem is nimble enough to evolve in response to the \r\nshortcomings that have been identified.\r\nNauru welcomes the attention that the theme of \r\nthis year’s general debate brings to the need to address \r\ndisputes by peaceful means, and it commends the \r\nefforts made by Taiwan and China to reduce tensions \r\nand increase cooperation. I call on Member States to \r\nsupport continuing dialogue between the two sides of \r\nthe Taiwan Strait and the parties concerned in the East \r\nChina Sea dispute to recognize Taiwan’s positive role \r\nin consolidating peace and stability in East Asia. Nauru \r\nurges a rapid and peaceful settlement of the situation \r\nin South Ossetia and Abkhazia in a manner that treats \r\nthose affected with dignity and that respects their rights \r\nas a sovereign nation.\r\nNauru continues to support the right of Israel to live \r\nfree from the fear of terrorism. We also acknowledge \r\nPalestine’s right to statehood as part of a two-State \r\nsolution, which can be achieved only through peaceful \r\nmeans.\r\nThe challenges facing the international community \r\nare great and can be solved only by concerted \r\nmultilateral action. President Jeremić’s task and ours \r\nis to begin the process of rebuilding the Organization. \r\nThat process must restore the integrity of the institution \r\nentrusted with the protection of human dignity. It \r\nwas accomplished once before in the aftermath of a \r\ncatastrophe. This time, our goal must be to prevent one. \r\nI pledge Nauru’s full support in that endeavour.\r\ncommunity has the tools and resources to respond to \r\nthe crisis.\r\nSome countries have been sceptical of Security \r\nCouncil involvement in climate change. That is \r\nunderstandable because the Council’s current \r\ncomposition does not accurately reflect the diversity \r\nof United Nations membership. The time has come for \r\nthis to be remedied. However, reform should not be \r\nlimited merely to membership. The Council must also \r\nprovide a forum for addressing the security challenges \r\nof all countries, not just those of concern to the most \r\npowerful.\r\nThe United Nations sustainable development \r\ninitiatives have been graced with an abundance of \r\nlofty rhetoric but few resources. Many countries, \r\nincluding my own, are not on track to meet their \r\nMillennium Development Goals, and in some cases \r\nhave suffered setbacks because of the recent global \r\neconomic downturn. At the same time, the f low of \r\nofficial development assistance from some channels \r\nhas diminished, further jeopardizing our ability to \r\nachieve our MDGs.\r\nWe often forget that oceans cover 70 per cent of \r\nthe Earth’s surface and that healthy marine ecosystems \r\nare vital to the sustainable development and sustainable \r\nlivelihoods of small islands. For many of us, the only \r\nvaluable natural resource we have is our fish. It forms \r\nthe cornerstone of our efforts to eradicate poverty and \r\nprovide livelihoods for our people. For us, fishing is \r\nnot just another economic sector — it is often the only \r\nsignificant economic sector, and we must jealously \r\nguard our modest natural wealth so that it can provide \r\nfor many generations to come.\r\nWhile the outcome document of the United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development in Rio had \r\nfew concrete deliverables, it did capture the Pacific \r\nSIDS vision of a blue economy. If fully implemented, \r\nthe new provisions could help stem the steep decline \r\nin fish stocks. We welcome the recognition of ocean \r\nacidification as an emergent threat, and we must work \r\ncollectively to build the resilience of marine ecosystems \r\nto climate change impacts. The commitments made in \r\nRio must be backed by real resources so they can be \r\ntranslated into concrete results on the ground.\r\nRio also infused new energy into making islands \r\na model for sustainable development by agreeing to \r\nconvene the third Global Conference on the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States, which \r\n12-52041 19\r\nA/67/PV.8\r\nforce of negotiations rather than international teams \r\nor former political figures from abroad. The mandate \r\nof the negotiating parties must be rooted as firmly as \r\npossible in domestic conditions and local traditions. \r\nExternal observers must not succumb to the temptation \r\nof imposing the settlement that they themselves regard \r\nas the right one, but which is not in line with long-\r\nterm natural developments in the country or region \r\nin question. For a number of reasons, those inevitable \r\npreconditions are often not met in attempts at peaceful \r\nconflict resolution. It is therefore no wonder that we \r\noften see the opposite results to those that the architects \r\nof a particular settlement would have wished.\r\nWe must ask ourselves what successful peace \r\ntalks and international missions are. Do external \r\ninterventions improve the situation or do they make it \r\nworse by hindering spontaneous processes that could \r\nreintroduce stability in the region, possibly with smaller \r\nsacrifices compared to the price paid through external \r\nintervention? For instance, are the developments in \r\nIraq, the unresolved Cyprus issue or the independence \r\nof Kosovo a success of the United Nations or not?\r\nLet me say a few words about Syria. As a country \r\nthat has recent historical experience of a transition \r\nto democracy, the Czech Republic wishes Syria to be \r\nable to take the same path. However, we do not see \r\na feasible solution now. Our immediate effort must \r\nfocus on helping the people affected by the current \r\ntragic situation in the country. The Czech Republic has \r\nalready sent humanitarian aid to Syria and to Syrians \r\nf leeing into neighbouring countries. We have set up a \r\nmedical evacuation programme for wounded Syrian \r\nrefugees. Czech experts took part in the United Nations \r\nobserver mission in Syria. Our Embassy in Damascus \r\nis also providing assistance. Two months ago, the Czech \r\nRepublic accepted the request of the United States for \r\nrepresentation in diplomatic and consular matters in \r\nSyria.\r\nThere is no doubt that we must look at the situation \r\nin Syria from a broader and longer-term perspective. \r\nWe should know what needs to be done tomorrow and \r\nthe day after tomorrow. I am afraid that that is the most \r\nimportant lesson learned from other similar issues, \r\nsuch as the recent military intervention in Libya.\r\nAllow me to affirm that the Czech Republic will \r\ncontinue to be an active United Nations Member. The \r\nCzech Republic observes and applies the principles \r\nand standards of international law in its foreign policy \r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Nauru for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Sprent Arumogo Dabwido, President of the \r\nRepublic of Nauru, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Václav Klaus, President of the \r\nCzech Republic \r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Czech Republic.\r\nMr. Václav Klaus, President of the Czech Republic, \r\nwas escorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Václav Klaus, President of \r\nthe Czech Republic, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Klaus: I would like to congratulate \r\nPresident Jeremić on his election to serve as the highest \r\nrepresentative of the General Assembly at its sixty-\r\nseventh session. In recent decades, his country has gone \r\nthrough a difficult period. I am sure his experience as \r\nthe Serbian Minister for Foreign Affairs who saw the \r\nconsequences of one kind of peacefully negotiated \r\nsettlement and armed international intervention will \r\nbenefit this year’s General Assembly and contribute \r\nto making our deliberations less formal and more \r\npractical.\r\nMr. Tanin (Afghanistan), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair.\r\nThe Czech Republic firmly believes that \r\ninternational disputes and conflicts can and should \r\nbe settled by peaceful, not military, means. We have \r\nbeen systematically demonstrating that for a long time. \r\nWhen the division of Czechoslovakia was taking place \r\n20 years ago and the situation was emotionally strained \r\nand painful for us, it never crossed the mind of any of our \r\npoliticians that the problem should be addressed by any \r\nother than peaceful means. The difficult negotiations, \r\nundertaken solely by our own representatives, resulted \r\nin achieving a settlement that political representatives \r\nand, especially, citizens in both the newly established \r\nStates considered then and still consider to be a positive \r\nsolution.\r\nOur experience affirms that it is the domestic \r\npoliticians, in particular, who should be the driving \r\n20 12-52041\r\nA/67/PV.8\r\nleaders in the West, both among politicians and in the \r\nmedia, to confront Islamophobia in all its many forms \r\nand manifestations. It is incumbent on us all to advance \r\nthe cause of dialogue and cooperation, to fight the \r\nforces of division and hatred and to fulfil the promise \r\nof a better and brighter future for future generations. \r\nWe must work to defeat the forces that foment conflicts \r\namong civilizations, and to support the voices of \r\ntolerance and understanding.\r\nMy country, Afghanistan, is testament to the \r\nbenefits of multilateral cooperation and international \r\nsolidarity. It was a little over a decade ago that many \r\ncountries from around the world joined the Afghan \r\npeople in our struggle for peace and against the forces \r\nof extremism and terrorism. At the time, Afghanistan \r\nwas a country decimated in every way. For decades we \r\nhad suffered, unnoticed, from violence, deprivation \r\nand sinister foreign intervention. Long before terrorism \r\nbecame a security threat to the whole planet, Afghans \r\nwere victims of atrocities inflicted by terrorist \r\nnetworks from various parts of the world that had made \r\nAfghanistan their haven.\r\nLooking back 10 years, Afghanistan has undergone \r\na remarkable transformation. Democracy has taken \r\nroot; health services are accessible to the majority of \r\nthe population in every corner of the country; millions \r\nof students, boys and girls, are enrolled in primary and \r\nhigher education. Our achievements have not come \r\nabout easily, though. The aspirations of the Afghan \r\npeople for security and peace have yet to be realized. As \r\nthe global fight against terrorism continues unabated, \r\nthe Afghan people continue to pay a bigger price than \r\nany other nation, in both life and treasure.\r\nTerrorism is not rooted in Afghan villages and \r\ntowns; it never was. Its sources and support networks \r\nall exist beyond Afghanistan’s borders. Thus while \r\nthe security of the international community is being \r\nprotected from the threat of terrorism, the people of \r\nAfghanistan must no longer be made to pay the price \r\nand endure the brunt of the war. It is in deference to the \r\nimmense sacrifices of the Afghan people, and to the \r\nprecious lives lost from the international community, \r\nthat the campaign against terrorism must be taken to \r\nthe sources of terrorism and be results-oriented.\r\nToday in Afghanistan, we are pursuing the cause of \r\npeace and an end to violence as a matter of great urgency. \r\nSince peace is the greatest desire of the Afghan people, \r\nand since we are convinced that military efforts alone \r\nare not an adequate strategy for ensuring security, we \r\nand promotes their international application. We \r\nwill support United Nations activities in the fields \r\nof disarmament and the non-proliferation of nuclear \r\nweapons. Those issues are among our security policy \r\npriorities. The Czech Republic will continue to take \r\npart in United Nations peacekeeping operations, as \r\nwell as in humanitarian and development programmes. \r\nIt also supports efforts to reform the United Nations, \r\nincluding the Security Council, which in 2005 began to \r\nwork towards responding to our changed international \r\nenvironment and promoting a more balanced \r\nrepresentation of individual regions and States.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Czech \r\nRepublic for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Václav Klaus, President of the Czech Republic, \r\nwas escorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Hâmid Karzai, President of the \r\nIslamic Republic of Afghanistan\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Islamic Republic \r\nof Afghanistan.\r\nMr. Hâmid Karzai, President of the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Afghanistan, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Hâmid Karzai, President of \r\nthe Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Karzai: As we speak today, the world \r\nis being shaken by the depravity of fanatics who \r\nhave committed acts insulting the faith of more than \r\n1.5 billion Muslims. We strongly condemn such \r\noffensive acts, whether they involve the production \r\nof a film, the publication of cartoons or indeed any \r\nother insults and provocations. Such acts can never \r\nbe justified as manifestations of freedom of speech \r\nor expression. Equally, they cannot become a reason \r\nfor genuine protests to be used to incite violence and \r\nterrible losses of innocent lives.\r\nIt is a matter for grave concern that our world \r\nremains strewn with daily outbreaks of violence, hatred \r\nand injustice. In particular, the menace of Islamophobia \r\nis a worrying phenomenon that threatens peace and \r\ncoexistence among cultures and civilizations. I call on \r\n12-52041 21\r\nA/67/PV.8\r\nApart from advancing transition and pursuing the \r\npeace process, the past year has been one of significant \r\nprogress for consolidating international commitment \r\nand partnership. In Chicago in May, we received the \r\nlong-term commitment of NATO and other countries to \r\ntraining, equipping and ensuring the sustainability of \r\nthe Afghan National Security Forces. In Tokyo this past \r\nJuly, the international community reaffirmed its strong \r\ncommitment to Afghanistan’s social and economic \r\ndevelopment during the transformation decade, for \r\nwhich we are grateful.\r\nThe Mutual Accountability Framework adopted in \r\nTokyo sets in place a clear structure for a more results-\r\noriented partnership and cooperation. We welcome the \r\ninternational community’s readiness to align aid with \r\nour national priorities and channel assistance through \r\nthe Afghan budget. For our part, we have reiterated our \r\ndetermination to improve governance and to collaborate \r\nwith our international partners to wipe out the cancer of \r\ncorruption, whether it is in the Afghan Government or \r\nthe international aid system.\r\nWe recognize that Afghanistan’s destiny is tied to \r\nthe region that surrounds it, with respect both to our \r\ncommon threats, such as terrorism, extremism and \r\nnarcotics, and to the opportunities we must grasp to \r\ngrow and prosper. In that context, the Istanbul Process \r\npresents a new agenda for security, confidence-building \r\nand cooperation across the region of which Afghanistan \r\nis the centre. We will spare no effort to build strong and \r\nlasting relations with our neighbors near and extended.\r\nTurning to the international arena, Afghanistan \r\nviews the situation in Syria with much concern. \r\nOver the course of the past year, thousands of our \r\nSyrian brothers and sisters have lost their lives due \r\nto an escalating cycle of violence. We welcome the \r\nappointment of the new Joint Special Representative \r\nfor Syria of the United Nations and League of Arab \r\nStates, Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi. We know him very well. \r\nMr. Brahimi is well respected in Afghanistan, and he \r\nbrings vast experience and a unique ability to the task \r\nbefore him. Here, I say to the people of Syria that we \r\nAfghans have experienced violence ourselves, and we \r\nknow what it takes to rebuild a country. I hope very \r\nmuch, on behalf of the Afghan people, that the Syrians \r\nwill sit down together as soon as possible and find a \r\nway to end the violence, since it will be not easy to \r\nrepair.\r\nhave initiated a peace and reconciliation process, which \r\naims to induce all elements of the armed opposition to \r\ntake up peaceful lives in our country.\r\nAt this time last year, my visit to the General \r\nAssembly was cut short by the tragic assassination of \r\nProfessor Burhanuddin Rabbani, the then Chairman \r\nof the High Peace Council. A terrorist posing as a \r\npeace emissary took his life, and by doing so dealt our \r\npeace process a serious blow. This year, however, and \r\nfortunately, the late Professor’s son, Mr. Salahuddin \r\nRabbani, who stepped up to take the Chair of the High \r\nPeace Council, is part of the Afghan delegation and \r\npresent in the Assembly today.\r\nI have often said that our hand of peace and \r\nreconciliation remains extended not only to the Taliban \r\nbut also to all other armed opposition groups who wish \r\nto return to dignified, peaceful and independent lives \r\nin their own homeland. What we ask of them in return \r\nis simple: bringing an end to violence, cutting ties \r\nwith terrorist networks, preserving the valuable gains \r\nof the past decade and respecting the Constitution of \r\nAfghanistan. To help facilitate the peace process, I am \r\nasking the Security Council to give its full support to \r\nour efforts. In particular, I urge the Security Council \r\nCommittee established pursuant to resolution 1988 \r\n(2011), the Taliban sanctions committee, to make more \r\nactive efforts to delist Taliban leaders, as a step towards \r\nfacilitating direct negotiations.\r\nIn pursuing the path of peace, we remain hopeful \r\nabout the critical role that our fraternal neighbour the \r\nIslamic Republic of Pakistan has to play. Over recent \r\nyears, we have engaged our brothers in Pakistan in a \r\nclose dialogue in support of the Afghan peace process. \r\nIt is a dialogue that we believe is critical for Pakistan’s \r\nown security and for the security of the wider region \r\nand beyond. We are deeply committed to our brotherly \r\nrelations with Pakistan, but we are aware of the \r\nchallenges that may strain our efforts to build trust \r\nand confidence. Such incidents as the recent shelling \r\nof Afghan villages risk undermining the efforts of both \r\nGovernments to work together in the interest of our \r\ncommon security and prosperity.\r\nFor the past two years, our national priority has \r\nbeen to have Afghanistan’s own security forces assume \r\nfull responsibility for the security of our country and \r\nour people. The transition process will be completed \r\nby mid-2013 and NATO and International Security \r\nAssistance Force forces withdrawn from our country \r\nby the end of 2014.\r\n22 12-52041\r\nA/67/PV.8\r\nSsekandi, Vice-President of the Republic of Uganda, \r\nand inviting him to address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Ssekandi (Uganda): Uganda joins other \r\ndelegations in congratulating Mr. Jeremić on his \r\nelection as President of this body. My delegation has full \r\nconfidence in his ability to steer our deliberations, and \r\nhe can count on our support. I also wish to commend \r\nMr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser for his effective \r\nleadership during the last session.\r\nThe international community has made significant \r\nprogress in reducing conflicts around the world over \r\nthe two decades since the end of the Cold War and \r\nthe eventual freedom of South Africa from apartheid. \r\nHowever, we still face challenges arising from conflicts \r\nthat take a heavy toll on nations and people around the \r\nworld. The theme for this session’s debate is therefore \r\ntimely and pertinent. We are again seeing an increase \r\nin conflicts brought about by unconstitutional changes \r\nof Governments, disputed elections, social tensions, \r\nextremist ideologies and territorial or border disputes, \r\namong other causes. We must redouble our efforts to \r\nresolve conflicts and disputes through peaceful means \r\nand in conformity with justice and international law, as \r\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nFrom Uganda’s experience over the years, conflicts \r\nare best handled, first and foremost, by the political \r\nactors and citizens of the countries in question, \r\nfollowing democratic principles and guided by the \r\nprinciple of equality of all persons before the law. In \r\ncases where national actors for some reason cannot \r\nresolve the problem, then subregional organizations \r\nshould step in. In the case of Africa those include the East \r\nAfrican Community, the Intergovernmental Authority \r\non Development, the International Conference on the \r\nGreat Lakes Region (ICGLR), the Southern African \r\nDevelopment Community, the Economic Community \r\nof West African States and others. The United Nations \r\nand the international community would then provide \r\nthe necessary support to subregional and regional \r\ninitiatives. \r\nOur recent achievements in the peace processes in \r\nBurundi, the Sudan, South Sudan and Somalia, among \r\nothers, attest to the progress we can achieve by working \r\ntogether. The advantages of such an approach include \r\nthe use of local actors who have more discerning \r\nknowledge of the problems and those in close proximity \r\nand with a greater stake in getting the problems \r\nresolved. In addition, there is the international support \r\nThe continuing plight of the Palestinian people \r\nhas been a source of deep distress for Afghanistan and \r\nthe rest of the international community. The people of \r\nPalestine have suffered immensely for far too long. We \r\nremain in full support of the realization of the rights \r\nof our brothers and sisters in Palestine, including their \r\nright to an independent Palestinian State. The time has \r\ncome for an end to the occupation and for realizing the \r\njust aspirations of the people of Palestine.\r\nFinally, reform of the United Nations remains an \r\nimportant item on the international agenda. Since its \r\ninception in 1945, the United Nations has exercised \r\na key role in promoting a safer and more secure \r\nworld, improving the lives of citizens worldwide, \r\nand safeguarding and promoting human rights. \r\nNevertheless, in view of our ever-changing world, we \r\ncannot deny the fact that the Organization is in dire \r\nneed of comprehensive reform, enabling it to better \r\nreflect the new challenges and realities of our time. \r\nThe reform of the Security Council is long overdue. \r\nAchieving a reformed Council that is more inclusive, \r\nrepresentative and transparent must remain a priority. \r\nWe welcome the ongoing progress within the framework \r\nof the intergovernmental negotiations.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Afghanistan for the statement he has just \r\nmade.\r\nMr. Hâmid Karzai, President of the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Afghanistan, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nMr. Kanda (Ghana), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mr. Edward Kiwanuka Ssekandi, \r\nVice-President of the Republic of Uganda\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Vice-President of the Republic \r\nof Uganda.\r\nMr. Edward Kiwanuka Ssekandi, Vice-President \r\nof the Republic of Uganda, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Edward Kiwanuka \r\n12-52041 23\r\nA/67/PV.8\r\nbe a recipe for long-term turmoil and instability in the \r\naffected countries and neighbouring regions.\r\nIn our view, in situations of armed conflict the \r\nfirst priority should be securing a verifiable ceasefire, \r\nfollowed by a political process involving an all-inclusive \r\ndialogue without preconditions. It is up to the parties, \r\nwith the assistance of a mediator or facilitator, to reach \r\na settlement that addresses their interests.\r\nThere is no doubt that resolving conflicts requires \r\nidentifying and addressing their underlying causes, \r\nwhich include social, political and economic factors \r\nthat are often deeply entrenched and interwoven. In \r\nseeking to resolve any conflict, national, regional and \r\ninternational actors need to adopt approaches that take \r\ninto account the following complexities. \r\nFirst, it is important to address the substantive issues \r\nthat give rise to conflicts in the first place, such as lack \r\nof access to or inequitable distribution of resources, \r\nsocial or political exclusion and other grievances. \r\nThe linkage between development and security in \r\npeacebuilding is now widely recognized, and once \r\nconflicts are resolved, the affected communities need \r\npeace dividends in terms of delivery of basic services \r\nsuch as health and education as well as opportunities \r\nfor employment.\r\nSecondly, efforts should be made to defuse the fear, \r\nhatred and other negative emotions that make conflicts \r\nintractable and often violent. We must collectively \r\nspeak out against intolerance and extremism in order \r\nto advance mutual respect and understanding of the \r\nvalues and beliefs of others. Uganda condemns all acts \r\nof terrorism and violence. We strongly condemn the \r\nrecent spate of violence and attacks, including targeting \r\ndiplomatic missions of the United States and other \r\nMember States.\r\nThirdly, political leaders and all actors need \r\nto forge national reconciliation, including through \r\ntransitional justice mechanisms, as well as establishing \r\ntruth and reconciliation mechanisms, which play a key \r\nrole in promoting durable peace. We would also like \r\nto reiterate the need to increase the role of women and \r\nyouth in the peaceful settlement of disputes, given the \r\nsignificant contribution they can make.\r\nOn the Israeli-Palestinian question, Uganda \r\ncontinues to call upon both parties to negotiate and \r\nreach a peaceful settlement based on a two-State \r\nsolution, with a Palestinian State living side by side \r\nwith Israel in peace, security and mutual recognition.\r\nand legitimacy that the United Nations provides. The \r\ncurrent ICGLR initiative on the situation in the east \r\nof the Democratic Republic of the Congo is based on \r\nsuch experience. We call upon the Security Council \r\nand the international community to give the necessary \r\nsupport to the decisions of the ICGLR summit held in \r\nKampala on 8 September. That regional initiative is \r\naimed at addressing the root causes of the conflict in \r\neastern Congo, deploying a neutral international force \r\nand responding to the humanitarian crisis.\r\nOur preference for home-grown solutions is \r\npremised on the realization that external influences \r\nor interventions do not necessarily offer sustainable \r\nsolutions for the resolution of conflicts. On the contrary, \r\nexternal interventions often contribute to a cycle of \r\ndestabilizing tendencies — which is why we are still \r\ngrappling with situations like the one in eastern Congo. \r\nThe African Union (AU) has shown strong political \r\nwill to resolve conflicts on the continent peacefully and \r\nto contribute to the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security. We call upon our partners to support the \r\ndispute resolution mechanisms, as well as the peace and \r\nsecurity efforts of the AU and subregional organizations. \r\nUganda’s participation in and contribution to conflict \r\nresolution in our subregion, on the African continent \r\nand on the international scene are guided by that \r\napproach, which has proved to be largely successful in \r\nresolving conflicts and wars.\r\nRegional initiatives need to be complemented by \r\ninternational support, including assisting countries \r\nemerging from conflict to build the requisite capacities \r\nfor the consolidation of peace. It is also important that \r\nsuch support include provision of immediate post-\r\nconflict humanitarian assistance and material input \r\nfor reconstruction and development. We welcome the \r\ncontinuing deepening of cooperation between the United \r\nNations and regional and subregional organizations \r\nin the resolution of conflicts and the maintenance of \r\npeace and security. This positive trend should continue, \r\nand every effort should be made to avoid repeating the \r\nmistakes of the past.\r\nUganda strongly believes that conflicts that might \r\narise between and within countries should be resolved \r\nthrough dialogue among all the parties concerned. In \r\nthe recent past we have witnessed regrettable instances \r\nin which peace initiatives have been frustrated through \r\nthe intransigence of the parties, with support from some \r\nmembers of the international community. That can only \r\n24 12-52041\r\nA/67/PV.8\r\nSpain’s resolve to work in the Council with an open and \r\nconstructive spirit, committed to peace and international \r\nsecurity, the promotion and protection of human rights, \r\nand the search for sustainable development for all.\r\nIn addition to the serious economic and financial \r\nsituation, the international community is facing today \r\nmore numerous and more complicated challenges \r\nthan ever before. The Organization and its General \r\nAssembly are key if we are to confront them. Year after \r\nyear, we discuss those problems here and their possible \r\nsolutions. For that reason, I believe that we should ask \r\nourselves today if we have improved since last year. \r\nWhile it might seem otherwise, I believe we have.\r\nIn one year, we have witnessed the unbreakable \r\nwill of the Arab citizens to consolidate democratic \r\nsystems in their countries. In Spain, we went through a \r\ndifficult but successful transition to democracy. Hence, \r\nwe know that the road is not and will not be easy. Our \r\nexperience can be useful for all Arab countries that \r\nare going through transition processes. I reaffirm our \r\ncommitment to building open, inclusive and democratic \r\nsocieties whose institutions satisfy the yearnings for \r\ndignity and for the development of its citizens. In those \r\nprocesses, there is no room for movements that promote \r\nviolence, whatever its justification. Any attack or \r\naggression against people or institutions is unacceptable \r\nand deserves our most full-throated condemnation.\r\nLast year, we also dedicated our efforts to finding \r\nsolutions to the crisis in the Horn of Africa, and \r\nespecially to the situation in Somalia. The difficulties \r\npersist, but Somalia is advancing towards normality. \r\nCooperation in the fight against piracy in the Indian \r\nOcean is stronger than ever, and during our recent \r\npresidency of the Contact Group on Piracy off the \r\nCoast of Somalia, we moved forward in the search of \r\nan international response to that criminal phenomenon. \r\nSimilarly, humanitarian efforts in that region have \r\nallowed for an improvement of the situation. Four \r\nmonths ago, Spain and the World Food Programme \r\n(WFP) signed an agreement to locate the largest food \r\nstorage facility in the world in the Canary Islands. \r\nThe WFP facility will allow faster and more efficient \r\nresponses to food emergencies on the African continent.\r\nAfghanistan continues moving forward in the \r\ndirection of stability — a road that Spain has pursued \r\ntogether with the Afghan people for more than a \r\ndecade. In that effort, we have bequeathed resources, \r\ninfrastructures and, unfortunately, the life of many \r\nFinally, we affirm our commitment to the peaceful \r\nsettlement of conflicts and to fostering international \r\ncooperation based on the principles of sovereign \r\nequality, justice and adherence to international law.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I thank the Vice-President of the Republic of \r\nUganda for the statement he has just made. \r\nMr. Edward Kiwanuka Ssekandi, Vice-President \r\nof the Republic of Uganda, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\nAddress by Mr. Mariano Rajoy Brey, President \r\nof the Government of the Kingdom of Spain\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Government of \r\nthe Kingdom of Spain. \r\nMr. Mariano Rajoy Brey, President of the \r\nGovernment of the Kingdom of Spain, was escorted \r\nto the rostrum. \r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Mariano Rajoy Brey, \r\nPresident of the Government of the Kingdom of Spain, \r\nand inviting him to address the General Assembly. \r\nMr. Rajoy Brey (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): Allow \r\nme to begin by congratulating Mr. Vuk Jeremić on \r\nhis election as President of the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-seventh session. I am convinced that with \r\nhis leadership and drive, this lofty institution will be \r\ncapable of facing the numerous challenges that will \r\narise in the next 12 months.\r\nI also wish to express my gratitude to his \r\npredecessor, Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser. I join \r\nothers in congratulating him on his work and wish him \r\nall the best in his new endeavours.\r\nSpain believes that the United Nations has a \r\nfundamental role to play. That is why I wished to \r\nparticipate in this general debate, the first since I took \r\nthe oath of office as President of the Government of \r\nSpain. It is always an honour for a Head of Government \r\nto address the General Assembly. I do so today on behalf \r\nof a country that is committed to the international \r\ncommunity and to the pursuit of joint solutions to the \r\nproblems we face.\r\nThe result of that commitment is our desire to serve \r\nonce again in the Security Council for the period 2015-\r\n2016. In my statement, I shall refer to the reasons for \r\n12-52041 25\r\nA/67/PV.8\r\nFirst of all, I would like to mention the crisis in \r\nSyria. A year ago, in the General Assembly, an urgent \r\nappeal was made to the Syrian regime to halt the abuses \r\nand crimes against its people. Despite the international \r\ncommunity’s efforts, the situation has not ceased \r\nto deteriorate. Thousands of innocent victims, the \r\nunbearable suffering of the civilian population and the \r\nserious risk of the conflict expanding to neighbouring \r\ncountries compel us to act. Today, I reiterate the call to \r\nend all violence in Syria and urge President Al-Assad \r\nto accept his responsibility and make way for a political \r\nprocess that will allow a peaceful resolution to the \r\nconflict. We support the efforts of the Joint Special \r\nRepresentative, Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, to reach this \r\ngoal. The international community, the United Nations, \r\nthe League of Arab States and the European Union \r\ncontinue to be prepared, through different mechanisms, \r\nto come to Syria’s aid.\r\nIn this uncertain regional scenario, Lebanon has so \r\nfar managed to keep itself on the margin of the spiral of \r\nviolence, an achievement that has been reached in good \r\nmeasure thanks to the contingent of United Nations \r\nInterim Force in Lebanon, in which Spain is an active \r\nparticipant.\r\nAnother year has passed without progress in the \r\nMiddle East peace process. We defend the idea that \r\nthe solution to the conflict in the Middle East lies \r\nin the existence of two States, the Israeli State and \r\nthe Palestinian State, living in peace and security. \r\nAny delay in achieving that goal leads to growing \r\nfrustration that will affect the rest of the world. The \r\ninternational community, and, above all, the actors \r\ninvolved must have the courage to adopt the measures \r\nand decisions needed to achieve that comprehensive, \r\njust and durable peace that responds to the legitimate \r\nyearnings of both peoples. My Government, committed \r\nto the goal of peace, is convinced that the creation of a \r\nviable Palestinian State is a key element in the solution \r\nof the conflict. It will bring beneficial effects for the \r\nsecurity and welfare of Israel, for the normalization \r\nof regional relations and, finally, for the international \r\ncommunity as a whole. Until then, the parties must \r\navoid endangering the viability of a two-State solution.\r\nThe situation in Mali and the entire Sahel region \r\nis particularly serious. The humanitarian crisis has \r\nbeen aggravated by political instability and an armed \r\nrevolt, which has deteriorated into terrorist movements \r\nthat have caused considerable harm to the population \r\nin northern Mali. Spain unreservedly condemns \r\nof our fellow citizens. My country will continue to \r\ncontribute to the development of Afghanistan and its \r\nsearch for much-needed stability and security.\r\nThis year, in Rio de Janeiro, we reaffirmed \r\nour common vision in favour of an economically, \r\nsocially and environmentally sustainable future. \r\nSince their conception, Spain has been committed to \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) with \r\nthe largest cooperation programme in its history, \r\nvalued at almost $1 billion, implemented through the \r\nSpain-United Nations Development Programme MDG \r\nAchievement Fund. Negotiations are under way to set \r\nnew goals for sustainable development and to bring the \r\ninstitutional structure in step with that commitment. \r\nSpain will maintain an active and constructive presence \r\nin the process.\r\nThe fight against international impunity has also \r\nseen important advances this year. The International \r\nCriminal Court initiated its first case against a Head of \r\nState, demonstrating that the international community \r\nis closer than ever to ending impunity for serious \r\ncrimes. I would like to reiterate today the call for the \r\nuniversal ratification of the Rome Statute.\r\nI would like to make special mention of the valuable \r\nand increasing role that Latin America has played \r\nin the development of the multilateral system. The \r\nachievements and progress that the region has attained \r\nin the consolidation of democracy, economic growth \r\nand regional integration are reflected in its greater \r\ninternational presence.\r\nLatin America has shown its potential by \r\nstrengthening the multilateralism promoted by the \r\nOrganization. Spain is proud to share in that spirit at \r\nthe Ibero-American summits and will be hosting this \r\nyear’s summit in Cádiz, Spain. That forum reflects the \r\nIbero-American community’s wager on the promise of \r\ndialogue, equality and mutual respect, with our eyes \r\nfirmly set on the future.\r\nI believe that those steps forward, among others, \r\nattest to an encouraging year, despite its difficulties. It \r\nis proof that the multilateral system is responding to the \r\npresent crisis and promoting respect for and the active \r\nprotection of human rights, as well as the presence and \r\nparticipation of women in all areas regions. But, of \r\ncourse, there are problems on which there has been little \r\nor no progress at all or that have emerged throughout \r\nthe present year. Those problems deserve as much if not \r\nmore of our attention in the 12 months that lie ahead.\r\n26 12-52041\r\nA/67/PV.8\r\ntroops and through the United Nations operational \r\nfield support base at Quart de Poblet, in Spain. Our \r\ncommitment to the United Nations will remain firm, \r\nas we actively participate in those initiatives that we \r\nhave been supporting in the past few years because we \r\nbelieve that they are key to achieving the future we \r\ndesire.\r\nDisarmament and non-proliferation must be shared \r\nobjectives for the entire international community. We \r\nbelieve that it is necessary to reactivate the Conference \r\non Disarmament with an ambitious programme of \r\nwork. Spain also supports renewing the General \r\nAssembly mandate to proceed with the negotiations \r\nof an arms trade treaty. We will continue to work for \r\na solid, effective and legally binding document that \r\nreflects the defence of human rights and international \r\nhumanitarian rights.\r\nAs a member of the Human Rights Council, we will \r\ncontinue to defend the undeniable link between respect \r\nfor human rights and peace and security in the world. \r\nWe will also continue to work towards a universal \r\nmoratorium on the death penalty.\r\nMy country will continue to support negotiations \r\nwithin the United Nations of a comprehensive \r\nconvention on international terrorism. Terrorism is a \r\nvicious trait that unfortunately Spain knows very well. \r\nI would like to take a moment today to remember and \r\npay tribute to all the victims of terrorism. In July, a \r\nHigh-Level Conference on Victims of Terrorism \r\nwas held in Madrid in the framework of the Global \r\nCounterterrorism Forum. There we reiterated that \r\nvictims can plan an  important role in the complete \r\ndelegitimization, in both social and moral terms, of \r\nterrorism. I wish to acknowledge the support of  the \r\nSecretary-General and of the President of the General \r\nAssembly in this task.\r\nWe will continue to promote the goals of \r\nUN-Women, after a first year full of work and results. \r\nIn that regard, Spain, which has been the biggest \r\ndonor to this entity during its first year, maintains its \r\ncommitment to equality between men and women and \r\nto the efforts to put an end to violence against women \r\nand girls.\r\nMy country is a firm defender of dialogue and \r\nthe use of peaceful means to resolve controversies. \r\nFor that reason, next Friday, together with Morocco, \r\nwe will present an initiative to promote mediation \r\nand to develop national and local capacities in the \r\nviolence and supports the efforts of the United Nations, \r\nthe African Union, and the Economic Community of \r\nWest African States to reach a solution to the crisis. \r\nThose efforts must count on the decisive support of \r\nthe countries of the region, whose people also endure \r\ninsecurity caused by the situation. And above all, the \r\nprocess must be led by the people of Mali themselves, \r\nwho need to overcome their institutional crisis and \r\nre-establish the territorial integrity of their country.\r\nOn other matters, I would like to highlight the \r\nefforts of the international community in general and of \r\nthe E3+3 Group in particular to relaunch conversations \r\nwith Iran with the goal of eliminating all doubts raised \r\nby the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) \r\nregarding its nuclear enrichment programme. Those \r\nconversations are sustained by the desire to reach a \r\npolitical and diplomatic solution and are an opportunity \r\nthat we hope all actors involved will take advantage \r\nof. We reiterate our appeal to Iran to comply with \r\nthe relevant resolutions without delay and to ratify \r\nand observe the additional protocol of the IAEA’s \r\ncomprehensive safeguards agreement.\r\nI would also like to express our support for the Six-\r\nParty Talks as a framework for finding a diplomatic \r\nsolution to the crisis raised by the nuclear programme of \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. We consider \r\nthat the country must put a stop to its nuclear activities \r\nwith military aims in a complete and verifiable manner, \r\nand it must comply with all Security Council resolutions \r\non the matter and respect its commitments to the Treaty \r\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.\r\nThis year we have moved towards a more peaceful, \r\njust and sustainable world. However, as reflected in \r\nthe cases I have just mentioned, much remains to be \r\ndone. To achieve this, Spain will continue to work with \r\nthe United Nations, for we believe that only through \r\na concerted effort of the international community can \r\nwe find solutions. My country’s wish to serve on the \r\nSecurity Council in 2015 and 2016 responds precisely \r\nto the conviction that in the Council Spain can continue \r\nplaying an active role in the search for joint solutions \r\nto common problems. That conviction is supported by \r\nSpain’s accomplishments to date, by our demonstrated \r\ncommitment to multilateralism and by the initiatives \r\nled by our country in the search for international \r\nunderstanding and sustainable development.\r\nSpain will continue to contribute, to the best of \r\nits ability, to peacekeeping operations by providing \r\n12-52041 27\r\nA/67/PV.8\r\nwe will continue to be open to dialogue on this issue, \r\nand we hope that, under the leadership of President \r\nJeremić, we will be able to find common ground among \r\nthe different positions on the issue on which we can \r\nbuild a new Security Council that is more effective, \r\ninclusive, representative and responsible to the General \r\nAssembly.\r\nWe are facing many challenges. Spain is strongly \r\ndetermined to contribute to those efforts so that in 12 \r\nmonths, when we meet here again, the list of problems \r\nbefore us is shorter and we can have a United Nations \r\nthat is more effective and efficient than it was a year \r\npreviously. The United Nations will continue to be a \r\nguarantor of international peace and security, and a \r\ndriving force for the protection of human rights and the \r\npromotion of sustainable development for our future \r\nand that of our children. The General Assembly can \r\ncount on Spain to participate in that endeavour with the \r\nsame determination as always.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the \r\nGovernment of the Kingdom of Spain for the statement \r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Mariano Rajoy Brey, President of the \r\nGovernment of the Kingdom of Spain, was escorted \r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Kay Rala Xanana Gusmão, \r\nPrime Minister of the Democratic Republic \r\nof Timor-Leste\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Democratic \r\nRepublic of Timor-Leste.\r\nMr. Kay Rala Xanana Gusmão, Prime Minister \r\nof the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Kay Rala Xanana \r\nGusmão, Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of \r\nTimor-Leste, and inviting him to address the General \r\nAssembly.\r\nMr. Gusmão (Timor-Leste) (spoke in Portuguese; \r\nEnglish text furnished by the delegation): It is a great \r\npleasure for me to address this great General Assembly \r\nfor the second year in a row.\r\nMediterranean basin. The initiative will be the first \r\nembodiment in that region of resolution 65/283 and of \r\nthe work of the Secretary-General and the Group of \r\nFriends of Mediation.\r\nSpain maintains its active commitment to a just, \r\nenduring and mutually acceptable political solution to \r\nthe dispute in Western Sahara, a solution that provides \r\nfor the self-determination of the Saharan people in \r\naccordance with the principles and objectives of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. As a member of the \r\nGroup of Friends, Spain firmly supports the work of the \r\nSecretary-General, his Personal Envoy and the United \r\nNations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara.\r\nBetween countries that are friends and allies, as \r\nis the case between Spain and the United Kingdom, \r\na direct and sincere dialogue should make it possible \r\nto overcome any differences. Therefore, I would \r\nlike to call upon the United Kingdom to renew the \r\nbilateral dialogue on the decolonization of Gibraltar in \r\naccordance with the parameters indicated by the United \r\nNations and enshrined in the Brussels Declaration of \r\n1984. We have already lost too many years.\r\nThe efforts of the Member States of the United \r\nNations will not be sufficient if they are not accompanied \r\nby the necessary adaptation of the United Nations to the \r\ncurrent world. The Secretary-General has launched a \r\nprocess aimed at reforming the Organization, which my \r\ncountry is following closely. I would like to reiterate \r\nthat Spain supports his efforts, and we call upon the rest \r\nof the Member States to continue their open dialogue on \r\nhis proposals, analysing them without any prejudices \r\nand showing sufficient courage to break with the status \r\nquo when necessary.\r\nIn that regard, I should like to reiterate our support \r\nfor the reforms of the Secretary-General in the area of \r\npeacekeeping operations. Likewise, Spain is a strong \r\ndriving force behind the Delivering as One initiative, \r\nwhich is an essential undertaking aimed at modernizing \r\nthe United Nations system, improving its effectiveness \r\nand efficiency in the fight against poverty and \r\ninequality, and thereby making it possible to do more \r\nwith less. Proof of Spain’s commitment to that initiative \r\nis the fact that my country has been the largest donor \r\nthereto, providing more than half of the total funding.\r\nLastly, the Security Council must also adapt, \r\nas quickly as possible, to the realities of the twenty-\r\nfirst century, which are very different from those that \r\nexisted when it was created. In the coming months, \r\n28 12-52041\r\nA/67/PV.8\r\nThe landmark moment of the celebrations was the \r\nconstitutional transfer of power from the then President \r\nof the Republic, Mr. José Ramos-Horta, to the new head \r\nof State, in a highly dignified manner for our young \r\ndemocracy.\r\nOn 7 July, the Timorese people were called to vote \r\nonce again, and on 30 July, the new Parliament took \r\noffice. As a result of those elections, three parties \r\nwere chosen to ensure the governance of Timor-Leste \r\nfrom 2012 to 2017. Consequently, on 8 August the \r\nFifth Constitutional Government was sworn in and \r\ngiven the mission of continuing to consolidate the vital \r\ninstitutions of a peaceful and democratic nation. In that \r\nway, we will also be continuing the work done by the \r\nprevious Government, which consisted of a five-party \r\ncoalition and undoubtedly sowed the seeds for national \r\npeace and stability, in addition to boosting our economy.\r\nDuring the course of this year, we have also been \r\nhonoured with visits by several eminent personalities, \r\nincluding two high-level dignitaries: in August, the \r\nSecretary-General, His Excellency Ban Ki-moon, \r\ndecided to see for himself the changes that had taken \r\nplace in our country since his last visit five years ago. \r\nHis visit was a magnificent gesture of support by a man \r\nwith a broad vision of peace and development, a vision \r\nthat is shared by the Timorese people. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral acknowledged the progress made and spoke \r\nwords of encouragement regarding the strengthening of \r\nthe ties of cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nTimor-Leste in an important undertaking, Education \r\nFirst, which is part of his global education initiative.\r\nMore recently, we also had the pleasure of hosting the \r\nUnited States Secretary of State, Mrs. Hillary Clinton. \r\nThat was the first time that a senior representative of \r\nthe United States Government had visited our young \r\ncountry. Mrs. Clinton also conveyed an important \r\nmessage of confidence and solidarity, praising the \r\nstrong commitment by Timor-Leste to the values and \r\nprinciples of democracy and good governance. Those \r\nevents are even more important given that UNMIT and \r\nthe International Stabilization Force will withdraw by \r\nthe end of 2012. That will mark the end of peacekeeping \r\noperations in Timor-Leste.\r\nAll this has instilled in the hearts of the Timorese \r\npeople a very special feeling of accomplishment and \r\nnational pride. I would like to convey that feeling of joy \r\nand thankfulness to all countries Members of the United \r\nNations and to the various international organizations \r\nLast September, I tried to convey to the Assembly \r\na message of progress and hope. Today I bring from \r\nthe people of Timor-Leste a message of both joy and \r\nthankfulness.\r\nThe United Nations has been in Timor-Leste \r\nsince the difficult times of our emancipation, having \r\nled the popular consultation of 1999. Since then, \r\nit has been enormously challenging to build from \r\nscratch the foundations of a new State under the rule \r\nof law, based on democratic governance and respect \r\nfor human rights. As such, after the United Nations \r\nMission in East Timor, we had missions such as the \r\nUnited Nations Transitional Administration in East \r\nTimor, the United Nations Mission of Support in East \r\nTimor, the United Nations Office in Timor-Leste and \r\nthe United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste \r\n(UNMIT) accompanying us in this crucial journey \r\nof State-building, as well as in the creation of an \r\natmosphere of reconciliation and harmony, with a view \r\nto achieving peace and stability.\r\nIn our still-brief existence as a State, we have been \r\ntrying to learn from the errors of the past. Today I \r\ncan say that we have decisively moved away from the \r\ndifficult circumstances that characterize post-conflict \r\ncountries or, in other words, countries with recent \r\nhistories of conflict and violence.\r\nWe have come to understand — along with several \r\ncountries — that peace and stability are essential \r\nprerequisites for State-building. This year, 2012, \r\ntherefore marks not exactly the end of a chapter in our \r\nhistory of peacebuilding but, more particularly, the \r\nstart of a new one — a chapter of ongoing institutional \r\nstrengthening with the goal of boosting national \r\ndevelopment.\r\nAfter two rounds of presidential elections, in March \r\nand April, our people elected as the third President \r\nof the Republic Major-General Taur Matan Ruak, a \r\nhistoric figure in the struggle for liberation, who has \r\nbeen serving the motherland since 1975. Taur Matan \r\nRuak led the armed resistance and became Chief of \r\nDefence Forces in 1999.\r\nIn May, we had the pleasure of hosting five heads \r\nof State and many delegations from friendly countries \r\nto celebrate with us the tenth anniversary of the \r\nrestoration of our independence. That took place within \r\nan atmosphere of peace, stability and confidence in the \r\nfuture.\r\n12-52041 29\r\nA/67/PV.8\r\nWe will continue to invest in social capital with the \r\naim of building capacity and of dignifying Timorese \r\ncitizens by maximizing the quality of and access to \r\nhealth, education, professional training, information, \r\nsocial justice and culture. We will invest in basic \r\ninfrastructures, which will be the driving force of the \r\ncountry’s development. We will develop the economic \r\nsector to make better use of our potential and to create \r\nemployment. We will encourage the growth of the \r\nprivate sector, both local and foreign. We will continue \r\nour efforts to consolidate the institutional framework \r\nso as to improve the functioning, management and \r\nimplementation of programmes. That includes a strong \r\npublic sector, good governance and a credible system \r\nof justice.\r\nMeanwhile, we will improve the social programmes \r\nthat cater to our most vulnerable citizens, including the \r\ndisabled, the elderly, and women and children at risk, in \r\norder to ensure that no Timorese citizen is marginalized \r\nor socially excluded. We will also continue to dignify \r\nour veterans.\r\nToday we have a plan, a vision and a goal: to \r\ntransform Timor-Leste from a low-income country to \r\na medium-high-income one by 2030. We want to be a \r\nprosperous and safe nation with a healthy and educated \r\npopulation, a country that provides skilled employment \r\nfor all.\r\nHowever, in the short term, by 2015, Timor-Leste \r\nwill not meet the Millennium Development Goals. \r\nThe current major challenge for Timor-Leste is the \r\nfight against poverty — a challenge that we share \r\nwith over one billion people in our planet. Regrettably, \r\naround 20 per cent of the world’s population live in \r\nconditions of extreme poverty. Hunger and the lack of \r\naccess to water sources will remain insurmountable \r\nchallenges. Mothers and children throughout the world \r\nwill continue to die tragically due to lack of access to \r\nservices to meet the most basic needs.\r\nUnfortunately, those are the current projections for \r\n2015. For that reason, it was very timely of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to create a high-level panel to help establish \r\nnew guidelines for beyond 2015. Here, I must confess \r\nthat we were proud to see a Timorese woman — our \r\nMinister of Finance, Emilia Pires — deservingly chosen \r\nas a panel member. Timor-Leste wants to contribute \r\nto the debate on that issue in a clear and constructive \r\nmanner. It is urgent to address the structural factors \r\nthat have provided us with ongoing support in terms of \r\nconsolidating peace, democracy and human rights.\r\nThe President of the Republic, Taur Matan Ruak, \r\nhas asked me to make public that on 20 May 2013 the \r\nTimorese State will be honouring, with the highest \r\ninsignia of Timor-Leste, all countries and parties \r\nthat have taken part in missions in Timor-Leste, \r\nstarting with the General Assembly and the Security \r\nCouncil. For our people, that will be an act of profound \r\nrecognition, expressing the wish that from now on the \r\nUnited Nations will pay more attention to our brothers \r\nand sisters in need. The success of Timor-Leste belongs \r\nto everyone — to the international community for their \r\ndedicated support and solidarity, and to the Timorese \r\npeople for the courage to acknowledge their mistakes \r\nand for their firmness and determination in correcting \r\nthem.\r\nThroughout the past four years, our people have \r\nclearly said no to conflict in order to fully embrace the \r\naspirations of their own development. The Timorese \r\npeople were also able to display a high degree of political \r\nmaturity by expressing, in a peaceful and constructive \r\nmanner, renewed confidence in their elected leaders \r\nand in State institutions. All of this is essential for \r\nreaffirming that, today more than ever, we are ready \r\nto continue leading the national development process, \r\nincluding the full establishment of our democratic State \r\nunder the rule of law and the gradual implementation of \r\nthe Strategic Development Plan 2011-2030.\r\nHowever, we want to maintain strong ties with \r\nthe United Nations and other partners under a new \r\ncooperation framework, taking as a starting point \r\nthe current needs of the country in both institutional \r\nstrengthening and in the development sector. Based on \r\nthe principles of the New Deal, which are advocated \r\nby the group of seven plus (g7+), we hope to see \r\nrelationships of cooperation being established in an \r\ninnovative, dynamic and effective manner.\r\nAfter overcoming the main obstacles in terms of \r\nState-building, Timor-Leste is now looking to the \r\nfuture with optimism. Consequently, the Government’s \r\nprogramme for the 2012-2017 mandate, which has \r\nalready been endorsed by Parliament, establishes short-\r\nterm — five years — activities, lists sectors where \r\nactivities can be started in order to have impacts in the \r\nmedium term of 5 to 10 years, and includes objectives \r\nfor the long term of 10 to 20 years , to be implemented \r\naccording to priorities and execution time.\r\n30 12-52041\r\nA/67/PV.8\r\nof social and political peace and stability. We want to \r\ncontribute in a way that is sound and based on actual \r\nexperiences in the g7+ itself. We are a small country \r\nthat is still fragile in some aspects, but we share the \r\nsame huge concerns of the 17 nations that make up our \r\ngroup, with a total population of more than 300 million \r\npeople.\r\nWe have seen how intolerance causes irreparable \r\ndestruction in several parts of the world, particularly \r\nin the daily lives of innocent people. The brunt of the \r\nimpact is borne by women, mothers, children and the \r\nelderly, making them even more vulnerable. Intolerance \r\nbreeds hatred and the desire for vengeance. The world \r\nis not changing so much as it is destroying itself.\r\nConsolidating the gains of the Arab Spring is \r\nproving to be difficult. Syria is a terrible example of \r\ninternal conflict. Iraq and Afghanistan do not present \r\nbetter perspectives of being able to solve their internal \r\ndifferences, which are becoming deeper.\r\nMy good friend Mr. Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, \r\nthe President of the Republic of Indonesia, has been \r\nhosting the Bali Democracy Forum, which has been \r\nattracting greater interest each year, along with an \r\nincreasing number of participating countries. We \r\nhave always maintained in that Forum that democracy \r\ncannot be imposed upon people, for the same reasons \r\nthat solar panels cannot be imposed on homes without \r\nfood, which therefore have no prospect of sustainability. \r\nDemocracy must be an internal process. The process is \r\nsometimes long, but it is vital for a lasting solution. \r\nThe most recent, dynamic and inspirational example \r\ncomes from Myanmar. I commend Aung San Suu Kyi, a \r\nwoman with an unshakeable character, a born leader, a \r\nresolute democrat and a defender of peaceful solutions, \r\nwho is today an advocate for internal reconciliation. \r\nI also commend the leaders of Myanmar for their \r\ncourage in making changes in the country. On behalf \r\nof the people of Timor-Leste, I also salute the people \r\nof Myanmar and wish them prosperity, and I appeal for \r\ndialogue, reconciliation and tolerance.\r\nToday’s world faces very serious problems and \r\nis sliding towards an increasingly dangerous lack of \r\ncontrol. In addition to a recent atmosphere of regional \r\ninstability, environmental threats continue to grow, \r\nhindering the legitimate aspirations of emerging and \r\ndeveloping countries to benefit from their natural \r\nresources. In the Pacific region, some island States see \r\ntheir very survival at risk.\r\nthat have hindered the efforts that so many people of \r\ngoodwill have made without obtaining tangible results.\r\nWe have a historical opportunity to change things. \r\nWe can learn from the lessons of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals process, analysing what worked \r\nand what did not, in order to do better in the future. \r\nStrengthening the role of the United Nations is essential. \r\nHowever, it will require the courage to break with \r\nthe old way of handling things. We need new action \r\nparadigms and new coordination mechanisms so that \r\nprogrammes may truly benefit the people of the more \r\naffected countries.\r\nThe g7+ was created in April 2010 in Dili, during \r\nthe preparation for the International Dialogue on \r\nPeacebuilding and Statebuilding, which took place in \r\nTimor-Leste. Prior to the creation of the g7+, there was \r\nno mechanism whereby fragile States with common \r\nconcerns about peace and development could discuss \r\nsuch matters in a less subservient way than in their \r\nrelationships with donors and development agencies.\r\nIt is quite common for recipient countries to \r\nconsider that the international assistance they receive \r\nis not the most appropriate to meet their real needs. \r\nCountries complain of the lack of an accountability \r\nsystem in relation to the money that is actually spent \r\non the poor, compared to the amounts spent to improve \r\nthe well-being of those who manage the projects and \r\nthose who manage the reports on the projects, long \r\ndocuments that are irrelevant because they are out of \r\ntouch with the reality on the ground. For those reasons, \r\nin a true spirit of openness and sharing, with a common \r\ndesire to improve the living conditions of their people \r\nand to contribute to sustainable peace and development, \r\nfragile countries created the g7+ as an international \r\ngroup through which they could speak with one voice. \r\nYes, we say one voice. Speaking as one, we will be able \r\nto demand responsibility from the leaders of beneficiary \r\ncountries and also accountability to the taxpayers of the \r\ndonor countries.\r\nThose are the same reasons why we are advocating \r\nthe New Deal, which seeks to ensure better coordination \r\nand ownership of international assistance by recipient \r\ncountries. We want assistance to have genuine impacts \r\non the people and to correspond better to the true needs \r\nof the beneficiary populations. \r\nTimor-Leste is fully committed to leading the g7+, \r\nbringing the same commitment it showed when moving \r\nfrom a situation of conflict and fragility to a situation \r\n12-52041 31\r\nA/67/PV.8\r\ncommitments and responsibilities reflecting the current \r\nsituations in today’s world.\r\nTimor-Leste has been walking the corridors of \r\nthe United Nations for 38 years. In the beginning, we \r\nwanted to mobilize public opinion in favour of our \r\ncause and to warn the world that our fundamental \r\nrights were being violated. Today, we are informing \r\nthe international community of our setbacks and \r\nachievements in the construction of a sovereign State. \r\nWhen we were guerrilla fighters in the mountains, we \r\nheard about a new world order. Today, many people \r\nare still oppressed because they suffer in one way or \r\nanother. We are here to speak in favour of dialogue and \r\nfair decision-making. Human dignity must be at the \r\ncore of decisions on problems affecting our planet. We \r\nmust have an overall sense of the existence, the fears, \r\nthe suffering, the despair and the fight for survival of \r\nmen and women around the world.\r\nToday we are here to ask for honest, constructive \r\nand unceasing dialogue to solve the problems that \r\ntrouble the world — a dialogue encompassing problems \r\nlarge and small, conflicts large and small and nations \r\nlarge and small. \r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of Timor-Leste for the statement \r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Kay Rala Xanana Gusmão, Prime Minister \r\nof the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe meeting rose at 9.50 p.m.\r\nFood security concerns are also coming to the \r\nforeground as a further result of climate changes, \r\nrequiring careful thought and an immediate and broad \r\nstrategy. In several parts of the world we see an immoral \r\nincrease in inequality, with a rich and powerful elite \r\ndominating the globe with impunity while the poor \r\nbecome even poorer and eternally dependent on \r\nwasteful assistance. What is more, it is difficult to \r\nknow from where that assistance will come.\r\nIn order to meet these challenges, we need a strong \r\nand efficient United Nations that cooperates more \r\neffectively with international and regional organizations \r\nand that operates with great respect for the sovereignty \r\nof each State. The United Nations, which consists of \r\nall of us here today, has a duty to humanity. We should \r\nall acknowledge that we are the privileged agents of \r\nthe necessary collective change to a better and safer \r\nworld. Our collective efforts to preserve peace, security \r\nand human dignity must be translated from altruistic \r\nidealism to a more interventionist plan. That in turn \r\nmeans replacing a reactive agenda with a proactive one. \r\nIt also means reducing the dominance of political and \r\neconomic interests in favour of social and humanitarian \r\ninterests.
